40|$|From an {{analysis}} of the available national allocation plans for the first period (2005 - 2007) of the EU emissions trading scheme (EU ETS), it can be inferred that (i) the total allocation to installations covered under the EU ETS is rather generous and (ii) most EU Member States ban the <b>transfer</b> of <b>allowances</b> (banking) into the second period (2008 - 2012). In this article, we explore the cost-efficiency issues associated with such a generous allocation of allowances to the trading sectors in combination with the ban on banking. It is argued that allocation to the trading sectors is higher than implied by a cost-minimization approach. Moreover, due to the reduced level of flexibility, a ban on banking increases overall compliance costs. In addition, the results of a simulation game conducted with real company participants and with a student control group suggest that a generous primary allocation in the first phase combined with a ban on banking also leads to a cost-inefficient choice of abatement measures within periods. The results of the simulations are also consistent with the conjecture that forward markets and auctioning off a part of the total quantity of allowances result in more reliable price signals and more cost-efficient outcome...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the paper is to analyse how {{earmarking}} of tax revenue affects the politico-economic equilibrium, in an overlapping generations economy. Two taxes (capital, and labour) and two types of <b>transfers</b> (income <b>allowance</b> and social security) and public goods provision are analysed. Predetermined fractions of the different taxes are used for public goods provision, which affects the utility of both generations, and the remaining fractions for social security to the old generation. Individuals within each generation differ in abilities. This intragenerational difference gives rise to different preferences over the tax rates and the resulting level of public goods provision and level of social security. The fiscal policy decision is endogenised through majority voting on representatives. Among the results are: in an economy without the labour income tax the earmarking {{does not affect the}} tax rate on capital income, nor the level of public goods. The more the taxes are earmarked to social security (as opposed to public goods) the greater is the wage tax, the smaller is the steady-state capital stock, and the greater is the social security.

The results suggest a negative and economically significant effect of the program on female labor force participation. The disincentive to participate is present for married women, while the effect is not statistically significant for unmarried women with children. We also find evidence on the heterogeneity of the effect depending on woman’s education, husband’s employment status, number and age of children, and whether the woman is the main responsible of domestic chores. The relatively large value of the benefit {{and the fact that}} transfers are mostly directed to mothers may explain the sizeable effect of the program on female labor supply.

For example, the tax content of public expenditures, the sales and fee revenues collected directly to cover the expenditures, and the size of EU subsidies – flowing through the budget – vary considerably from one country to the next.

We argue that companies that are able to advance their production and to store the produced goods are induced to shift production activities partially prior to the banking prohibition and, thereby, imitate the banking of emission allowances by storing their output. Since this leads to a temporal demand shift on the allowance market, the anticipated price jump in the first Kyoto period might be mitigated. Perfect arbitrage, however, will not be possible because utilities, which account for more than two-thirds of the CO 2 -emissions, are unable to store their output and companies from other industry sectors only dispose of limited storage capacities.

Powell (2002), for example, examines {{the impact of}} child care prices and wage rates on the joint employment and child care decisions of married mothers in Canada. She finds that wages {{have a positive impact}} on the probability of choosing any of the working states and that child care prices for centre, sitter, and relative care reduce the probability of working and using each respective mode of care. Connelly and Kimmel (2009) extend the model proposed by Kimmel and Connelly (2007) considering the effect of spouse’s characteristics on time devoted to leisure, child care, and home production of married mothers and fathers. Their results show little effect of one spouse on the unpaid time use of the partner, while the relative wage does not affect time use choices. In Russia, Lokshin et al (2000) and Lokshin (2004) focus again on mothers, modelling simultaneously household demand for child care, mothers’ labour force participation and mothers’ working hours. Both studies do not restrict the sample to single unit households, so the inclusion of multi-nuclear families implies the need to control for not only the wage of the husband, but also the average wage of all other family members.
