40|$|Exposure to impacts and {{vibrations}} {{has been}} shown to be detrimental to cross country mountain bike performance and health. Therefore, any strategy aimed at attenuating such exposure is useful to participants and/or industry. The purpose of this study was to assess the influence of <b>tyre</b> <b>size</b> and <b>tyre</b> inflation pressure on exposure to impacts. Participants completed nine trials of a technical section (controlled for initial speed and route taken) including nine separate conditions involving three <b>tyre</b> <b>sizes</b> and three <b>tyre</b> inflation pressures normalised per tyre. Performance was determined by time to negotiate the technical section while triaxial accelerometers recorded accelerations (128 [*]Hz) to quantify impact exposure and the subsequent effects on soft tissue response. Increases in <b>tyre</b> <b>size</b> within the range used improved performance P< 0. 0001 while changes to tyre inflation pressure had no effect P= 0. 6870 on performance. Larger <b>tyre</b> <b>sizes</b> and lower <b>tyre</b> inflation pressures significantly P< 0. 0001 reduced exposure to impacts which could be augmented or negated due to an interaction between <b>tyre</b> <b>size</b> and inflation pressure P< 0. 0001. It is recommended that mountain bikers use larger tyres, inflated to the moderate pressures used within this study, in order to increase performance and reduce the risk of overuse injuries...|$|R

40|$|The {{selection}} of appropriate <b>tyre</b> <b>size</b> and inflation pressure {{for a particular}} load and soil condition are crucial to minimising soil compaction and ensuring soil sustainability. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the changes in soil bulk density from soil deformation data, produced by a selected range of combine-harvester tyres, inflated to the recommended inflation pressures, and at high axle load (10. 5 tonnes) to provide a valuable indicator for tyre selection. Results showed that the initial soil strength was the main factor influencing soil deformation and soil bulk density changes beneath the tyres. In addition, increased <b>tyre</b> <b>size</b> and low inflation pressure reduced both soil deformation and the resultant increase in soil bulk density. The increases in soil bulk density after one passage of the tyres over the soil were approximately 25 % for the low bulk density soil (1. 20 g cm - 3) and between 2. 3 % and 5 % for the high bulk density soil (1. 60 g cm - 3). The advantage of increasing <b>tyre</b> <b>size</b> and lowering inflation pressure was also reflected in the results obtained from penetrometer resistance: at the centre of the wheeling, the tyre with the highest inflation pressure (2. 5 bar) gave a significantly higher increase in penetration resistance compared with the tyres with lower inflation pressures (2. 2 bar and 1. 9 bar). Linear relationships between drop-cone penetration and maximum rut depth were established; these data were subsequently related to those obtained from penetration resistance and initial soil bulk density; therefore, the increase in soil bulk density induced after driving a tyre over the soil can be determined for various tyre configurations and initial soil conditions. ...|$|R
