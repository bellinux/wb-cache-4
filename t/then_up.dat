5|$|The fulvous {{whistling}} duck has a {{very large}} range extending across four continents. It breeds in lowland South America from northern Argentina to Colombia and <b>then</b> <b>up</b> to the southern US and the West Indies. It is found in a broad belt across sub-Saharan Africa {{and down the east}} of the continent to South Africa and Madagascar. The Indian subcontinent is the Asian stronghold.|$|E
5|$|Because the {{territorial}} boundary {{line between the}} U.S. and British North America (specifically, the province of Quebec until 1791 and Upper Canada thereafter) ran {{through the middle of}} Lake Erie and <b>then</b> <b>up</b> the Detroit River, combined with the prevailing belief regarding the location of the southern tip of Lake Michigan, the framers of the 1802 Ohio Constitution believed it was the intent of Congress that Ohio's northern boundary should certainly be north of the mouth of the Maumee River, and possibly even of the Detroit River. Ohio would thus be granted access to most or all of the Lake Erie shoreline west of Pennsylvania, and any other new states carved out of the Northwest Territory would have access to the Great Lakes via Lakes Michigan, Huron, and Superior.|$|E

5|$|Focusing on the {{cultural}} and political use of the architecture at Framlingham, historian D. Plowman has put forward a revisionist interpretation of the castle's architecture in the late medieval period. Plowman suggests that the castle {{was intended to be}} entered from {{the north end of the}} Lower Court, passing through the ornamental gardens, with travellers then entering through the gate by the Prison Tower – in this interpretation, more of a barbican than a tower – and <b>then</b> <b>up</b> into the Inner Court. This would have provided high status visitors with dramatic views of the castle, reinforcing the political prestige of the owners. Historian Magnus Alexander disputes the practicality of this arrangement, although agrees that the route would have been more practical for hunting parties proceeding to the local parklands.|$|E
5|$|From Campobello, Eddy sailed up the Saint John River to Maugerville, where 27 {{men were}} recruited, and <b>then</b> <b>up</b> to the Maliseet {{settlement}} at Aukpaque (just upriver from present-day Fredericton). There {{he learned the}} bad news that Pierre Tomah, the main Maliseet chief, {{was not interested in}} taking up the hatchet. Eddy was able to convince Ambroise St. Aubin, one of Tomah's competitors, and 15 men to join the expedition in exchange for an agreement with the Maugerville community to support the families of those men. In another disappointment, none of the local Acadians joined, contrary to assertions St. Aubin had made to Eddy during a previous visit to the area.|$|E
5|$|In October 1834 Richard Weobley, the Clerk of Works, {{received}} {{instructions from}} Treasury officials {{to clear the}} old tally sticks while parliament was adjourned. He decided against giving the sticks away to parliamentary staff to use as firewood, and instead opted to burn them in the two heating furnaces of the House of Lords, directly below the peers' chambers. The furnaces had been designed to burn coal—which gives off a high heat with little flame—and not wood, which burns with a high flame. The flues of the furnaces ran up {{the walls of the}} basement in which they were housed, under the floors of the Lords' chamber, <b>then</b> <b>up</b> through the walls and out through the chimneys.|$|E

PFC Gonsalves accompanied the 22nd Marines to Kwajalein, to Guadalcanal, back to Kwajalein and Eniwetok, <b>then</b> <b>up</b> to Guam in July, where he took part in Battle of Guam.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after his}} second inauguration on March 4, 1901, William and Ida McKinley {{undertook}} a six-week {{tour of the}} nation. Traveling mostly by rail, the McKinleys were to travel through the South to the Southwest, and <b>then</b> <b>up</b> the Pacific coast and east again, to conclude with a visit on June 13, 1901, to the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo, New York. However, the First Lady fell ill in California, causing her husband to limit his public events and cancel a series of speeches {{he had planned to}} give urging trade reciprocity. He also postponed the visit to the fair until September, planning a month in Washington and two in Canton before the Buffalo visit.|$|E

In order to secure a peaceful passage through {{the land of the}} Khazars, the Rus' promised the Khazars half of their spoils. They sailed down the Dnieper River into the Black Sea, then into the Sea of Azov, <b>then</b> <b>up</b> the Don River past the Khazar city of Sarkel, and then by a portage reached the Volga, which led them into the Caspian Sea.|$|E
5|$|When Blake {{finds the}} bodies, he calls Nelson, who {{comes out to}} {{identify}} them. After Blake angrily demands an explanation, Nelson reluctantly reveals West's condition. Nelson believes West is somehow getting stronger the more his body decomposes. Back at Nelson's house, West attacks and kills Perry, although Judy is not harmed. Nelson and Blake arrive just as West escapes. West then stumbles upon {{the home of a}} married couple (played by Jonathan Demme and Janus Blythe). West kills the man and attacks his wife, but she drives him away after chopping his arm off with a cleaver. Blake receives a call about the attack and takes Nelson with him to investigate. They follow West to a giant power plant, and <b>then</b> <b>up</b> several flights of outside stairways.|$|E

5|$|Rouget's {{division}} and Paris' brigade apparently {{began to pull}} back after Darmagnac's retreat. Seeing a gap open between Rouget and Taupin, Wellington ordered the 52nd Foot to advance from the Roman Camp and drive a wedge into the French defensive line. The unit's commander John Colborne led his men across some marshy ground and <b>then</b> <b>up</b> the slope toward the Luc knoll, followed by Wellington and his staff. They won a foothold {{at the top of}} the ridge on Taupin's left flank. With both its flanks turned, Taupin's division hurriedly retreated to the northeast, the last French unit to be dislodged. The mauled division never rallied, though it managed to save all but two of its cannons. At some position to the rear, Rouget's {{division and}} Paris' brigade joined together and fought a hard battle against the pursuing Allies.|$|E
5|$|The sixth set of episodes also stayed {{below the}} 4 million mark, {{but in an}} evening that saw ITV beat BBC One's {{audience}} share in the evening by 19.6% to 19%, including the earlier episode of Red of Black? gaining 3.8m viewers, while the later show was viewed by slightly more with 3.9m. However, in direct competition with the later show was BBC One's Would I Lie to You? which had slightly more viewers, with 4m tuning in. On the return of Red or Black? to Saturday night, the show climbed above 4 million {{for the first time}} in three days, to 4.63m for the first show and <b>then</b> <b>up</b> to 5.67m for the second. This enabled ITV to beat BBC One in the primetime ratings overall, by 23.3% to 21%, even though the first episode of series 8 of Strictly Come Dancing was broadcast on BBC. However Red or Black? individually placed behind both Strictly and Doctor Who, with the overnights for the BBC shows being 7.6 and 6.0 million, respectively. Overall through the week the main ITV channel had a higher share of the ratings during primetime than BBC One on five out of the seven occasions, a turnaround from the previous week where it only won on a single evening.|$|E
5|$|The strepsirrhine rhinarium {{can collect}} {{relatively}} non-volatile, fluid-based chemicals (traditionally categorized as pheromones) and transmit {{them to the}} vomeronasal organ (VNO), which is located below {{and in front of}} the nasal cavity, above the mouth. The VNO is an encased duct-like structure made of cartilage and is isolated from the air passing through the nasal cavity. The VNO is connected to the mouth through nasopalatine ducts (which communicate via the incisive foramen), which pass through the hard palate at the top, front of the mouth. Fluids traveling from the rhinarium to the mouth and <b>then</b> <b>up</b> the nasopalatine ducts to the VNO are detected, and information is relayed to the accessory olfactory bulb, which is relatively large in strepsirrhines. From the accessory olfactory bulb, information is sent to the amygdala, which handles emotions, and then to the hypothalamus, which handles basic body functions and metabolic processes. This neural pathway differs from that used by the main olfactory system.|$|E

5|$|While {{talking about}} Chris's {{situation}} with Lois, Peter is suddenly {{confronted by the}} Giant Chicken. This is the third fight between the two. Their epic battle ranges from the Griffin house, through the sewers, onto a subway train, over the girders of a high-rise construction site, and <b>then</b> <b>up</b> into a biplane, crashing into a giant Ferris wheel, which is dislodged from its platform and rolls through the streets. The fight continues atop the rolling wheel until it demolishes a ten-story apartment building. Emerging from the wreckage, Peter and the Chicken realize that neither has any idea what they are fighting about. They apologize to each other, and the Chicken invites Peter to join him and his wife, Nicole, for dinner. At the restaurant, the three have just finished a lovely meal when the check arrives, and both Peter and the Chicken (named Ernie) insists on paying the tab--Peter insists on paying since his order was kind of expensive while Ernie insists on paying {{as a way of}} apologizing to Peter. As they face off, the fight resumes and leads them into the restaurant kitchen. Peter subdues Ernie with a pot of boiling water and beats him unconscious. Peter staggers home, and back in the kitchen, Ernie lies lifeless on the floor, but in a sudden close-up, Ernie's left eye opens as dramatic music plays, foreshadowing another chicken fight. Peter goes home and resumes his conversation with Lois.|$|E
5|$|With {{the ongoing}} {{conflict}} with Chart House {{on the mind}} of the company's board in 1978, Burger King hired McDonald's executive Donald N. Smith to help revamp the company. Smith initiated a restructuring of all future franchising agreements. New owners were barred from living more than an hour's drive from their restaurants, corporations were not permitted to own franchises, and franchisees could no longer operate other chains. This new policy effectively limited the size of franchisees and prevented larger franchises from challenging Burger King as Chart House had. It also became a requirement for the corporation to own the properties of any new store and lease them to franchisees. This policy would allow the company to take over the operations of failing stores or evict those owners who would not conform to the company guidelines and policies. Beyond the changes to the franchise system, Smith also restructured Burger King's corporate operations to better compete against his former employer as well as <b>then</b> <b>up</b> and coming chain Wendy's. He broadened the product offering by adding the Burger King specialty sandwich line in 1979, and also added many non-hamburger sandwiches including new chicken and fish offerings. The new line {{was one of the first}} attempts by a major fast food chain to target a specific demographic, in this case adults aged between 18 and 34 years, members of which were presumably willing spend more on a higher quality product. The new products were successful and the company's sales increased by 15%.|$|E
