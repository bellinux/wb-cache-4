5|$|For {{its first}} 13 years, PNC Park sold Pepsi products, a {{contrast}} from its predecessor Three Rivers Stadium, which sold Coca-Cola products, {{as well as}} Heinz Field and Mellon Arena. In right field, several versions of the Pepsi Globe {{as well as a}} Pepsi bottle were displayed on large posts behind <b>the</b> <b>stands</b> <b>and</b> lit up every time the Pirates hit a home run. In 2014, the Pirates switched to Coca-Cola. The Pepsi signage in right field was converted into advertising for locally based health insurance company Highmark.|$|E
5|$|In 1936 the Belgian, Romain Maes, {{appeared}} to win but judges declared Frenchman Georges Speicher the winner and Maes second. Shouting began in <b>the</b> <b>stands</b> <b>and</b> {{for a moment}} it looked as though fighting would start, but calm returned and the result was upheld. A Belgian may not have won but there were seven Belgians in the first ten.|$|E
5|$|On 26 March 2005 Nea Salamina {{played a}} {{friendly}} against the Turkish Cypriot Yenicami at Ammochostos Stadium, defeating them 6–0; {{it was the}} first match between Greek and Turkish Cypriot clubs in 50 years. About 2,500 fans sat together in <b>the</b> <b>stands,</b> <b>and</b> the match was attended by political leaders, local sports authorities and representatives of the Church of Cyprus.|$|E

5|$|The fight {{began with}} a {{flagrant}} foul by Knicks guard Mardy Collins on Nuggets guard J. R. Smith in the closing seconds of the game. Several players joined in the confrontation, and began to make physical contact. The fight briefly spilled into <b>the</b> <b>stands,</b> <b>and</b> also stretched {{to the other end}} of the court. All ten players on the floor at the time were ejected after the altercation was finished. When suspensions were announced, seven players were suspended without pay for a combined total of 47 games.|$|E
5|$|The stadium was {{designed}} by {{a team led by}} Bob Sheard at Lobb Sport Architecture, who later merged with HOK Sport to become Populous. The building contractor was Laing and the structural engineers were WS Atkins. Mike Otlet of WS Atkins designed the stadium's retractable roof. Cimolai S.p.A. from Italy fabricated and erected the 72 steel plane frames for <b>the</b> <b>stands</b> <b>and</b> all the 4,500 components of the roof.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>stands</b> <b>and</b> {{terraces}} {{were arranged}} in a haphazard manner due to space constraints, and by 1920 the club had outgrown the cramped venue. A decision to seek an alternative venue was hastened in November 1920, when the Main Stand was destroyed by fire. Manchester City moved to the 80,000-capacity Maine Road in 1923, and Hyde Road was demolished shortly afterward. One structure from the ground is still in use in the 21st century, a section of roofing which was sold for use at The Shay, a stadium in Halifax.|$|E

5|$|Drogba {{suffered}} {{a string of}} injuries {{early on in the}} 2008–09 season and struggled to regain fitness, missing games from August to November due to knee problems. He scored his first goal of the season in mid-November but there was little reason to celebrate: he incurred disciplinary action and a three-match ban for throwing a coin back into <b>the</b> <b>stands</b> <b>and</b> Chelsea {{suffered a}} League Cup defeat against Burnley. Drogba scored his second goal of the season in a 2–1 victory against CFR Cluj in the UEFA Champions League, while his first Premier League goal of the season came in a 2–0 win against West Bromwich Albion in late December 2008. Having missed many games through injury and suspension, Drogba had lost his first team place and manager Scolari favoured playing Nicolas Anelka as a lone striker rather than pairing the two. However, he resolved to regain his position in the squad.|$|E
5|$|Ninety {{seconds after}} Wallace shoved Artest, most of both teams' {{players and coaches}} were huddled at midcourt, {{attempting}} to calm down Wallace (Tayshaun Prince was the only player on either team to not leave the bench during the entire incident; others became automatically eligible for one-game suspensions). While Artest {{was lying on the}} table, Wallace threw a towel at him, causing Artest to briefly stand up before being held back by coaches. A spectator, John Green, then threw a plastic cup of Diet Coke at Artest, hitting him in the chest. Artest jumped off the table, ran into <b>the</b> <b>stands,</b> <b>and</b> grabbed a man, Michael Ryan, who he mistakenly believed was responsible. Boyle stood up to try and hold back Artest and was trampled in the effort, suffering five fractured vertebrae and a gouge on his head. Jackson followed Artest into <b>the</b> <b>stands</b> <b>and</b> punched a fan, William Paulson, in the face in retaliation for the man throwing another drink in Artest's face while he was being restrained by other spectators. Pacers players Eddie Gill, David Harrison, Reggie Miller (who was not dressed for the game due to injury), Fred Jones, and Jamaal Tinsley, the Pistons' Rasheed Wallace, and numerous personnel (including Pistons radio analyst and former player Rick Mahorn) also quickly entered the stands to retrieve Artest and Jackson, and to break up the fighting. Green punched Artest twice in the head from behind, as did Ben Wallace's brother, David, to Jones. More fans then began throwing drinks and other objects, while a number of fans spilled out onto the court.|$|E
5|$|The {{stage and}} {{associated}} props took twenty-four semi-trailer trucks to transport. The setup {{consisted of a}} main stage with three elevators and a turntable (which rose and lowered), a central runway with LED and strobe lights connected to a central stage with a LED view screen in the construction and an elevator. The two secondary runways were raised up into <b>the</b> <b>stands</b> <b>and</b> also had view screens inside the construction. Two projection screens were raised above the audience so those who couldn't get {{a clear view of}} the stage could still see the performance. There were also 3 LED screens that moved around during the performance, including one semicircular transparent screen lowered onto the stage during the video interludes.|$|E

5|$|In {{the cross}} country events, {{the heat of}} 45°C (113°F), caused all but 15 of the 38 {{competitors}} to abandon the race. Eight finishers were taken away on stretchers. One athlete began to run in tiny circles after reaching the stadium, until setting off into <b>the</b> <b>stands</b> <b>and</b> knocking himself unconscious. Early leader Wide {{was among those who}} blacked out along the course, and was incorrectly reported to have died at the hospital. Nurmi exhibited only slight signs of exhaustion after beating Ritola to the win by nearly a minute and a half. As Finland looked to have lost the team medal, the disoriented Liimatainen staggered into the stadium, but was barely moving forward. An athlete ahead of him fainted 50 metres from the finish, and Liimatainen stopped and tried to find his way off the track, thinking he had reached the finish line. After having ignored shouts and kept the spectators in suspense for a while, he turned into the right direction, realised his situation and reached the finish in 12th place and secured team gold. Those present at the stadium were shocked by what they had witnessed, and Olympic officials decided to ban cross country running from future Games.|$|E
5|$|The Ravens {{opened the}} game with Ray Rice gaining a 47-yard run, his longest of the year {{up to that point}} (his {{previous}} highest in 2013 was 14 yards), which led to Rice's 1-yard run with 9:58 in the first. The Ravens added to the score with Justin Tucker's 52-yarder, bringing the score to 10–0. With 4:51 left in the first quarter, the game was suspended due to inclement weather, which included a tornado watch, which was eventually elevated to a tornado warning. Fans were ordered to evacuate <b>the</b> <b>stands</b> <b>and</b> enter the covered concourses, while the teams returned to the locker rooms. The evacuation marked the first time Soldier Field had an evacuation since the stadium's opening in 1921. The game resumed play at 3:25p.m. ET, after a 1-hour, 53 minute-delay. In the second quarter, Robbie Gould kicked a 20-yard field goal, and eventually, rookie defensive end David Bass escaped a chop block by Rice and intercepted Flacco, scoring on a 24-yard return and tying the game. The Ravens eventually scored on Torrey Smith's five yard touchdown catch, and after Flacco had a pass intercepted by Jon Bostic, Gould ended the half kicking a 46-yarder. After a scoreless third period, Matt Forté caught a 14-yard pass from McCown and scored with 10:33 in the fourth, the Bears finally taking the lead 20–17. Now behind by three, the Ravens engineered an 82-yard drive to Chicago's 2-yard line, but Rice failed to score twice, and a botched snap from Gino Gradkowski slowed down the Ravens, and Flacco's pass towards Smith was overthrown. As a result, the Ravens resorted to a 21-yard field goal with three seconds in regulation to force overtime. In overtime, Flacco's pass for Tandon Doss fell incomplete, and the Ravens punted to the Bears. McCown then completed a 43-yard pass to Martellus Bennett, and Gould kicked the game-winning 38-yard field goal with 8:41 remaining to win the game 23–20, which lasted five hours, 16 minutes.|$|E

25|$|On October 21, 2012 {{during a}} regular season game at Buck Shaw Stadium, several LA Galaxy fans were arrested after violent altercations erupted in <b>the</b> <b>stands</b> <b>and</b> smoke bombs were set off during half time.

25|$|The record {{crowd at}} the ground was on 29 April 1967 when 51,455 watched the Second Division title decider against Wolverhampton Wanderers. This was more than 6,000 more than the {{previous}} record set against Aston Villa in 1938. Many people who were at that game suggest the attendance was a lot higher, possibly over 60,000. Supporters climbed onto the roofs of <b>the</b> <b>stands</b> <b>and</b> up the floodlights.|$|E

25|$|Edwards {{recovered}} it on {{its first}} bounce as Pisarcik unsuccessfully attempted to fall on it. Kotar, who could have blocked him or fallen on the ball himself, never even saw the fumble, according to Edwards. Once Edwards got it, he sprinted 26 yards untouched {{into the end zone}} for a 19–17 Eagles victory. There was stunned silence from <b>the</b> <b>stands</b> <b>and</b> the Giants' sideline. The only noise came from the celebrating Eagles.|$|E
25|$|In January 2014, Barcelona's {{board of}} {{directors}} rejected the option of building a new stadium and will instead remodel the Camp Nou to bring the capacity up to 105,000. The project is expected to cost around £495 million (€600 million) with work beginning in 2017 with a completion date of early 2021. A refinement of the plan was released on 26 May 2015, showing plans to add a canopy over <b>the</b> <b>stands,</b> <b>and</b> showing the plans for seating expansion in greater detail.|$|E
