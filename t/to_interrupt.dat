5|$|Along with {{visiting the}} music school in Savonlinna, Turunen began serious {{classical}} vocal training at 17. After school, she began studying music (with a specialization in church music) at the Sibelius Academy. Due to her commitment with Nightwish, she had <b>to</b> <b>interrupt</b> her academic studies.|$|E
5|$|Grameen Bank {{is founded}} on the {{principle}} that loans are better than charity <b>to</b> <b>interrupt</b> poverty: they offer people the opportunity to take initiatives in business or agriculture, which provide earnings and enable them to pay off the debt.|$|E
5|$|A chavrusa {{helps the}} student stay awake, keep his mind {{focused on the}} learning, sharpen his {{reasoning}} powers, develop his thoughts into words, and organize his thoughts into logical arguments. This type of learning also imparts precision and clarity into ideas that would otherwise remain vague. Having to listen to, analyze and respond to another's opinion inculcates respect for others. It is considered poor manners <b>to</b> <b>interrupt</b> one's chavrusa. The chavrusa relationship also strengthens the student's personal commitment to his studies, as he is loathe to disappoint or cancel on his chavrusa.|$|E

5|$|In {{front of}} the Royal Crescent is a Ha-ha, a trench on which the inner side of which is {{vertical}} and faced with stone, with the outer face sloped and turfed, making the trench, in effect, a sunken fence or retaining wall. The ha-ha is designed not <b>to</b> <b>interrupt</b> the view from Royal Victoria Park, and to be invisible until seen from close by.|$|E
5|$|Masashi Kishimoto {{originally}} created Shikamaru {{in order}} {{for him to be}} the only winner of an early Naruto arc: the Chunnin Exams, based on his high intelligence. However, recommendations from his editors resulted in Kishimoto <b>to</b> <b>interrupt</b> the fighting tournament between the ninjas in order to focus on a recently new introduced villain, Orochimaru. Nevertheless, Shikamaru ends becoming the only ninja from the original test to achieve a higher rank during Part I of the series.|$|E
5|$|News {{anchor and}} {{political}} commentator Chris Matthews' show entitled Hardball with Chris Matthews is referenced by Stewie when he suggests Brian {{is getting a}} big head, with the guest, United States Senator Harry Reid, then appearing on Matthews' forehead, suggesting Matthews is self-centered. After Reid continues <b>to</b> <b>interrupt</b> him, however, Matthews cuts to actor Kurtwood Smith, in which Matthews appears on Smith's forehead instead.|$|E
30|$|Asynchronous {{operations}} have higher priority: they {{interrupt the current}} execution (even tasks), and they are related <b>to</b> <b>interrupts.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Interrupt Descriptor Table (IDT) is a data {{structure}} {{used by the}} x86 architecture <b>to</b> implement an <b>interrupt</b> vector table. The IDT {{is used by the}} processor to determine the correct response <b>to</b> <b>interrupts</b> and exceptions.|$|R
5000|$|Responding <b>to</b> an <b>interrupt</b> {{involves}} {{saving the}} registers to a stack, and then branching <b>to</b> the <b>interrupt</b> handler code. In a stack machine, most parameters {{are already on}} a stack. Therefore, {{there is no need}} to push them there. Often stack machines respond more quickly <b>to</b> <b>interrupts.</b> [...] Some register machines deal with this by having multiple register files that can be instantly swapped but this increases costs and slows down the register file.|$|R
5|$|Only {{five days}} later, on July 31, Paykull reached the {{outskirts}} of Warsaw with his army and in a surprise attack attempted <b>to</b> <b>interrupt</b> the coronation of Stanisław. In the ensuing battle of Warsaw the much smaller Swedish force under Carl Nieroth guarding the city won a decisive victory. Paykull was captured along with secret documents which informed the Swedes of a possible attack on Warsaw by a larger Russian army under Peter.|$|E
5|$|A band {{formed by}} the American musicians Thomas Jude on guitars, Paul Morris on keyboards, Nick Douglas on bass and Tom Coombs on drums was {{assembled}} for the supporting tour. Doro was a more commercial offering than the previous album, but resulted in a flop in the US. On the contrary, it sold well in Europe, accelerating PolyGram's decision <b>to</b> <b>interrupt</b> the publication of Doro's albums in America, where the commercial appeal of glam metal and classic rock acts was rapidly declining in favor of grunge and alternative rock. Doro concluded 1990 playing some dates in Germany, opening for Scorpions.|$|E
5|$|After {{receiving}} the post-touchdown kickoff, Auburn {{began to run}} out the clock. The Tigers failed {{to pick up a}} first down, and after going three and out, punted the ball back to Virginia Tech. The Hokies started their drive at their two-yard line, and Randall began it successfully by completing a 20-yard pass, rushing for 10yards, then completing a five-yard pass to bring the Hokies near midfield. On the fourth play of the drive, however, Randall was intercepted by Auburn's Derrick Graves. The Tigers, their offense again on the field, began running out the clock again. Tech attempted <b>to</b> <b>interrupt</b> Auburn's clock management by calling timeouts after each play, stopping the clock with each timeout. Virginia Tech forced Auburn into a three and out, and the Tigers again punted the ball away with 2:13 remaining.|$|E

5000|$|The {{existing}} {{control and}} status register definitions support RISC-V's error and memory exceptions, {{and a small}} number of interrupts. For larger systems, the specification also defines an interrupt controller. Interrupts always start at the highest-privileged machine level, and the control registers of each level have explicit [...] "forwarding" [...] bits <b>to</b> route <b>interrupts</b> <b>to</b> less-privileged code. For example, the hypervisor need not include software that executes on each <b>interrupt</b> <b>to</b> forward an <b>interrupt</b> <b>to</b> an operating system. Instead, on set-up, it can set bits <b>to</b> forward the <b>interrupt.</b>|$|R

5|$|At {{the end of}} August, 1916, Döblin {{was awarded}} the Fontane Prize (including a {{monetary}} award of 600 Marks) for The Three Leaps of Wang Lun (Die drei Sprünge des Wang-lun). Following this recognition, Döblin set himself {{to work on his}} historical novel Wallenstein, set during the Thirty Years' War. Döblin had <b>to</b> <b>interrupt</b> work on the novel in March 1917 because he had caught typhus, but was able to use the university library at Heidelberg during his convalescence in April and May to continue researching the Thirty Years' War. Back in Saargemünd he came into conflict with his superiors due to the poor treatment of the patients; on 2 August 1917 he was transferred to Hagenau (Haguenau) in Alsace, where the library of nearby Strassbourg helped complete Wallenstein by the beginning of 1919.|$|E
5|$|Dishonoreds stealth {{system was}} {{originally}} {{based on that}} of the Thief series, which uses level lighting and shadows to determine whether an enemy can detect the player character's presence. However, {{it was decided that}} it was unrealistic that an enemy could stand directly in front of a player hiding in shadows and not detect them. It was also considered that making certain areas dark hid the designers' work and contrasted poorly with well-lit areas. Much of the ambient dialogue was written to be lengthy and add background detail to the game world and to entertain stealth players who may be in a single area for a long time. Conversely, main story dialogue was written to be short to compensate for the player being able <b>to</b> <b>interrupt</b> or kill the character who is speaking.|$|E
5|$|During {{conversations with}} characters, Mass Effect 2 employs a radial command menu, called Dialogue Wheel, where the player's {{dialogue}} options depend on wheel direction. The {{left side of}} the wheel is normally reserved for options that will continue the conversation in depth, while options on the right side tend to move the conversation towards completion. Responses at the top are generally more polite and selfless, while those at the bottom are more aggressive and hostile. The game also introduces a context-sensitive interrupt system, allowing players <b>to</b> <b>interrupt</b> the conversation with direct actions at certain times. Dialogue choices impact how others react to Shepard, the rewards for completing missions, possible discounts from merchants, romances and, most importantly, the Commander's morality.|$|E

30|$|To {{reduce the}} {{possibility}} of call drop, higher priority is given <b>to</b> <b>interrupted</b> SUs over new SUs, i.e., SUs with initial service requirement; thus, interrupted SUs will be put before new SUs in the low-priority sub-queues.|$|R
5|$|During early pregnancy, type 1 lobules {{quickly become}} type 2 lobules because {{of changes in}} {{estrogen}} and progesterone levels. Maturing into type 3 and then reaching full differentiation as type 4 lobules requires an increase of human placental lactogen (hPL) which occurs {{in the last few}} months of pregnancy. According to the abortionbreast cancer hypothesis, if an abortion were <b>to</b> <b>interrupt</b> this sequence then it could leave a higher ratio of type 2 lobules than existed prior to the pregnancy. Russo and Russo have shown that mature breast cells have more time for DNA repair with longer cell cycles, accounting for the slightly reduced risk of breast cancer for parous women against the baseline risk for women who have never conceived and those who have conceived and terminated their pregnancies.|$|E
5|$|George {{was born}} July 19, 1893 in Somerville, Massachusetts, to Horace and Susan E. George. He {{attended}} George Washington University, but decided <b>to</b> <b>interrupt</b> his studies when the United States became {{directly involved in}} World War I. George joined the United States Army and on May 21, 1917, received his commission as second lieutenant in the Cavalry as a reserve officer. A month later, he went on active duty with the Cavalry at Fort Myer, Virginia, and married Anna Virginia Helms on August 10. In October George resigned his reserve commission to become a flying cadet with the Aviation Section, U.S. Signal Corps.|$|E
5|$|In 1974 Jacques' {{sons were}} arrested for {{possession}} of cannabis, and her house was searched by police. In the same week that the two boys appeared in court, she received official notification of the intention to appoint her as an OBE. In order to protect her sons from further press intrusion she declined the honour. Later that year, while filming the third series of Sykes, she suffered a cancer scare and lost {{a considerable amount of}} weight. Despite this she refused <b>to</b> <b>interrupt</b> the busy production schedule; when filming was completed on 5 December she underwent surgery at Charing Cross Hospital for what proved to be benign tumours on her kidneys.|$|E
50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 25-30 mm. Adults have {{pure white}} wings, the wing markings limited <b>to</b> <b>interrupted</b> orange-yellow <b>to</b> brown antemedial and postmedial lines. Adults are on wing from April to September in one generation per year.|$|R
30|$|MicroBlaze also {{supports}} reset, interrupt, user exception, break and hardware exceptions. For interrupts, MicroBlaze supports only one external <b>interrupt</b> source (connecting <b>to</b> the <b>interrupt</b> input port). If multiple interrupts are needed, an interrupt controller {{must be used}} <b>to</b> handle multiple <b>interrupt</b> requests <b>to</b> MicroBlaze. An <b>interrupt</b> controller is available for use with the Xilinx EDK software tools. The processor will only react <b>to</b> <b>interrupts</b> if the interrupt enable (IE) bit in the MSR is set to 1. On an interrupt the instruction in the execution stage will complete, while the instruction in the decode stage {{is replaced by a}} branch <b>to</b> the <b>interrupt</b> vector (address 0  ×  10). The interrupt return address (the PC associated with the instruction in the decode stage {{at the time of the}} interrupt) is automatically loaded into general-purpose register R 14. In addition, the processor also disables future interrupts by clearing the IE bit in the MSR. The IE bit is automatically set again when executing the RTID instruction.|$|R
50|$|The $k0 and $k1 {{registers}} ($26-$27) {{are reserved}} for kernel use {{and should not be}} used by applications since these registers can be changed at any time by the kernel due <b>to</b> <b>interrupts,</b> context switches or other events.|$|R
5|$|Mary Wilson's {{brother died}} {{unexpectedly}} {{that night in}} Hull; although {{she and her husband}} did not attend for a second day's racing, they asked all the other guests not <b>to</b> <b>interrupt</b> the plans, and the remainder of the party attended, watching the St. Leger Stakes. During the journey to the racecourse, Lycett Green asked Edward Somerset his advice, telling the peer that several members of the party were convinced of Gordon-Cumming's guilt. Edward Somerset decided to consult his cousin, Arthur Somerset, and the two men suggested that Lycett Green inform the prince's senior courtier, Lord Coventry.|$|E
5|$|Neuner competed at the Summer Biathlon World Championships for {{the first}} time in September 2009 when they were held in Oberhof. She only reluctantly agreed <b>to</b> <b>interrupt</b> {{training}} and participate in the summer event, which is contested on roller ski, however she went on to win gold in all three competitions (sprint, pursuit and mixed relay). Neuner missed the first World Cup of the 2009–10 season due to a cold in December 2009. She returned at the following races in Hochfilzen, but was still affected by her cold and finished outside the top 20. Her first podiums of the winter came in Pokljuka, finishing third in the sprint and second in the pursuit race. Thereby she secured her Olympic qualification within the German team.|$|E
5|$|Over the Rainbow is {{the debut}} {{album of the}} child singer Connie Talbot, and was {{released}} 26 November 2007 by Rainbow Recording Company. Talbot, who had entered the public eye after her appearance on the first series of Britain's Got Talent at age six, signed with Rainbow, an independent label, after briefly recording with Sony BMG. Over the Rainbow consists entirely of covers of pop and Christmas songs, and was recorded primarily in a spare {{room in the house}} of Talbot's aunt, in an attempt not <b>to</b> <b>interrupt</b> Talbot's childhood by disrupting her regular activities. Although public appearances were initially kept to a minimum, Talbot did make appearances to promote the album, and performed in public several times after the British release.|$|E
50|$|Also, {{although}} some later ISA devices {{were capable of}} automatic configuration, it was common for PC ISA expansion cards to limit themselves to {{a very small number}} of choices for interrupt request lines. For example, a network interface might limit itself <b>to</b> only <b>interrupts</b> 3, 7, and 10, while a sound card might limit itself <b>to</b> <b>interrupts</b> 5, 7, and 12. This results in few configuration choices if some of those interrupts are already used by some other device.|$|R
50|$|Leeuwenberg sank {{several species}} (see Synonyms) as macrostachya {{owing to the}} {{similarity}} of the individual flowers, whilst acknowledging that {{the structure of the}} inflorescences varied, from continuous (e.g. B. cylindrostachya) <b>to</b> <b>interrupted</b> (e.g. B. hookeri); he also considered macrostachya very closely allied to B. forrestii.|$|R
5000|$|Two {{separate}} register files, {{which could}} be quickly switched, to speed up response <b>to</b> <b>interrupts</b> such as fast asynchronous event handlers or a multitasking dispatcher.
