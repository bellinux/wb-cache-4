5|$|The {{improvement}} process continued {{throughout the}} production run, {{though they were}} not immediately implemented in <b>the</b> <b>production</b> <b>line,</b> but were instead incorporated in a fourth prototype for evaluation. This aircraft first flew on 29 October 1940 and was a significant improvement over the I-200s then in production. It passed its State acceptance trials and its improvements were incorporated in <b>the</b> <b>production</b> <b>line</b> from the 101st I-200. These were designated as the MiG-3 on 9 December, although the first production MiG-3 was not completed until 20 December 1940.|$|E
5|$|The first {{customer}} delivery {{occurred in}} June 1992, and production rates averaged one car per day. The last XJ220 rolled off <b>the</b> <b>production</b> <b>line</b> in April 1994; the factory was {{then transferred to}} Aston Martin and used for the assembly of the Aston Martin DB7 until 2004.|$|E
5|$|Angel's Bakery {{opened its}} {{landmark}} factory store {{adjacent to the}} Givat Shaul plant in 1984. The store offers a full selection of packaged breads, rolls, and muffins, bourekas, danishes, fancy cakes, handmade pastries, coffee and soft drinks. For many years, visitors could watch bakers braid challahs through a large side window. At {{the end of the}} Passover holiday, a long line of customers traditionally forms outside the store after midnight, waiting to buy the first bread off <b>the</b> <b>production</b> <b>line.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{bombing of}} the Eder Dam on 17 May 1943 had no {{significant}} effect on <b>the</b> <b>production</b> <b>lines.</b> Only light buildings like barracks were damaged, and {{a few weeks later}} <b>the</b> <b>production</b> <b>lines</b> were working like before.|$|R

5|$|In 1879, Karl Benz {{was granted}} the first patent on a {{reliable}} gasoline-powered engine in Germany. In 1885, he produced the first true gasoline automobile, the Benz Patent Motorwagen. The new invention was quickly refined and gained popularity in Germany and France, and interest {{grew in the}} United Kingdom and the United States. In 1902, Ransom Olds created <b>the</b> <b>production</b> <b>line</b> concept for mass-producing lower-cost automobiles. Henry Ford soon refined the concept so that by 1914, middle-class laborers could afford automobiles built by Ford Motor Company.|$|E
5|$|On 3 November 2015, Erick Scarecrow of Esc-Toy Ltd. {{launched}} an official Kickstarter campaign, together with Hato Moa and Devolver Digital, asking for $25.000 {{to create a}} production line of three characters from the Hatoful Boyfriend universe, namely, Shuu, Ryouta and Okosan. During the campaign, all stretch goals were reached, the last ending at $75.000, adding seven more characters to <b>the</b> <b>production</b> <b>line.</b> The campaign ended on 6 December 2015, {{with a total of}} $145.015 pledged.|$|E
5|$|The Arrow was the {{culmination}} of a series of design studies begun in 1953 examining improved versions of the Avro Canada CF-100 Canuck. After considerable study, the RCAF selected a dramatically more powerful design, and serious development began in March 1955. The aircraft was intended to be built directly from <b>the</b> <b>production</b> <b>line,</b> skipping the traditional hand-built prototype phase. The first Arrow Mk. I, RL-201, was rolled out to the public on 4 October 1957, the same day as the launch of Sputnik I.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{deals with}} the selection-control problem of a system which {{consists}} of a flexible manufacturing cell, M <b>production</b> <b>lines</b> and an assembly machine. The flexible manufacturing cell feeds <b>the</b> <b>production</b> <b>lines,</b> and <b>the</b> <b>production</b> <b>lines</b> feed <b>the</b> assembly machine. Sufficient conditions on optimal feedback selection-control strategies, that maximize the expected value of the total time that all the buffers concerned are simultaneously nonempty, are derived. Also, a simple feedback selection-control strategy is proposed...|$|R
50|$|The showrunners for {{the season}} were John Altschuler and Dave Krinsky. The {{majority}} of episodes in this season are leftover episodes from <b>the</b> 9ABE <b>production</b> <b>line,</b> {{as well as one}} episode from <b>the</b> 8ABE <b>production</b> <b>line</b> ("Bystand Me"). <b>The</b> AABE <b>production</b> <b>line</b> (much like <b>The</b> Simpsons 3G <b>production</b> <b>line</b> for seasons eight and nine) is a short-lived line and only lasts for five episodes (four airing this season and the fifth airing as a leftover episode next season).|$|R
30|$|It {{is noted}} that, the repair {{strategy}} presented in “Crossover 1 –crossover operation applying to resource allocation part” is used again here in Step 7 {{to adjust the}} lengths of <b>the</b> <b>production</b> <b>lines</b> to make <b>the</b> offspring feasible.

Due to the changes in <b>the</b> <b>production</b> <b>lines,</b> their lengths are changed accordingly as illustrated in Tables  4 and 6.|$|R
5|$|The Australians {{were already}} {{preparing}} to produce radar sets locally. Oliphant persuaded Professor Thomas Laby to release Eric Burhop and Leslie Martin {{from their work}} on optical munitions to work on radar, and they succeeded in building a cavity magnetron in their laboratory at the University of Melbourne in May 1942. Oliphant worked with Martin {{on the process of}} moving the magnetrons for the laboratory to <b>the</b> <b>production</b> <b>line.</b> Over 2,000 radar sets were produced in Australia during the war.|$|E
5|$|The Cadillac Converj is a plug-in hybrid {{concept car}} first {{unveiled}} at the 2009 North American International Auto Show which incorporated the propulsion {{system from the}} Chevrolet Volt, including the Voltec powertrain. In August 2011, General Motors announced its decision to produce the Converj as the Cadillac ELR. The first 2014 ELRs rolled off <b>the</b> <b>production</b> <b>line</b> in late May 2013. These were pre-production units destined for testing purposes and production for retail customers started {{at the end of}} 2013. The ELR was released to retail customers in the U.S. in December 2013.|$|E
5|$|The Citroën AX was {{launched}} without a twin in 1986, {{and the only}} other Talbot in development, the Arizona family hatchback, {{was launched}} instead as the Peugeot 309 {{at the end of}} 1985. Production of the Samba ended in May 1986, by which time 270,555 had been made, signalling {{the beginning of the end}} of the Talbot brand for passenger cars, the death knell finally sounding the following year when the last Horizon rolled off <b>the</b> <b>production</b> <b>line</b> in Finland, although the brand survived on commercial vehicles until 1994.|$|E
50|$|In total two prototypes and 200 {{production}} aircraft were built before <b>the</b> <b>production</b> <b>lines</b> changed to building the four-engine Lancaster.|$|R

5|$|The E-1s {{came off}} <b>the</b> <b>production</b> <b>line</b> in February 1938, {{in time for}} a number of these {{aircraft}} to serve in the Condor Legion during the Spanish Civil War in March 1938. The RLM thought that because the E variant could outrun enemy fighters in Spain, {{there was no need to}} upgrade the defensive weaponry, which would prove to be a mistake in later years.|$|E
5|$|The first {{pre-production}} {{test car}} {{based on the}} final Volt design was built in June 2009, in Warren, Michigan, and by October 2009, 80 Volts had been built and were tested under various conditions. On March 31, 2010, the first factory-built Volt was produced at the Detroit Hamtramck Assembly Plant {{in order to test}} <b>the</b> <b>production</b> <b>line</b> and for quality control purposes, both of the tooling and the pre-production vehicles produced before regular production began.|$|E
5|$|Upon its {{retirement}} from service, the 747 number two in <b>the</b> <b>production</b> <b>line</b> was dismantled {{and shipped to}} Hopyeong, Namyangju, Gyeonggi-do, South Korea where it was re-assembled, repainted in a livery {{similar to that of}} Air Force One and converted into a restaurant. Originally flown commercially by Pan Am as N747PA, Clipper Juan T. Trippe, and repaired for service following a tailstrike, it stayed with the airline until its bankruptcy. The restaurant closed by 2009, and the aircraft was scrapped in 2010.|$|E
30|$|It {{is noted}} {{that once again}} the repair {{strategy}} presented in “Crossover 1 –crossover operation applying to resource allocation part” is used in Step 6 to adjust the lengths of <b>the</b> <b>production</b> <b>lines</b> to make <b>the</b> chromosome feasible. The feasible offspring chromosome would look like as shown in Table  8.

5|$|Enzyme inhibitors {{also occur}} {{naturally}} and {{are involved in}} the regulation of metabolism. For example, enzymes in a metabolic pathway can be inhibited by downstream products. This type of negative feedback slows <b>the</b> <b>production</b> <b>line</b> when products begin to build up and is an important way to maintain homeostasis in a cell. Other cellular enzyme inhibitors are proteins that specifically bind to and inhibit an enzyme target. This can help control enzymes that may be damaging to a cell, like proteases or nucleases. A well-characterised example of this is the ribonuclease inhibitor, which binds to ribonucleases in one of the tightest known protein–protein interactions. Natural enzyme inhibitors can also be poisons and are used as defences against predators or as ways of killing prey.|$|E
5|$|In the 1990s, Boeing and BAE Systems assumed {{management}} of the Harrier family following corporate mergers that saw Boeing acquire McDonnell Douglas and BAe amalgamate with other defense companies to form BAE Systems. Between 1969 and 2003, 824 Harriers of all models were delivered. In 2001, Flight International reported that Taiwan might meet its requirement for a short take off and vertical landing (STOVL) aircraft by purchasing AV-8Bs, outfitted with the F-16 Fighting Falcon's APG-66 radar. A Taiwanese purchase would have allowed <b>the</b> <b>production</b> <b>line</b> to stay open beyond 2005. Despite the possibility of leasing AV-8Bs, interest in the aircraft waned as the country switched its intentions to procuring the F-35 and upgrading its fleet of F-16s.|$|E
5|$|Production of the German Leopard 2 {{and the new}} 120mm {{tank gun}} began in 1979, {{fulfilling}} an order for the German Army. Although the American M1 Abrams was originally armed with the M68A1 105mm gun (a version of the L7), the United States Army had planned to fit the tank with a larger main gun at a later date, and the tank's turret had been designed to accommodate a larger 120mm gun. The larger gun was integrated into the M1A1 Abrams, with the first vehicle coming off <b>the</b> <b>production</b> <b>line</b> in 1985 The gun, known as the M256, {{was based on the}} L/44 tank gun, although manufactured at Watervliet Arsenal and modified to increase the resistance of the barrels to fracture and fatigue. Tanks armed with versions of Rheinmetall's gun produced under licence include Japan's Type 90 and South Korea's K1A1. The gun had made a huge turn in technological history.|$|E

5|$|Star Breweries {{invested}} {{over four}} million euros into improving its {{factories in the}} 2009-11 period, resulting in a 20% increase in production capacity. These improvements included refurbishing <b>the</b> <b>production</b> <b>line</b> equipment, including higher performing mixers and belts and a new bottle conveyor system. The Coca-Cola Company issued international HACCP certification to Star Breweries in 2010, confirming its adherence to international quality standards in beverage production. In 2011, Coca-Cola also awarded Star Breweries the Gold Medal among 27 competing African countries for the company's standards of quality and environmental protection {{in the production of}} its beer and other beverages. Frequent brownouts resulting from the overtaxed national power grid produce power cuts to the THB breweries that have negatively affected the volume and cost effectiveness of production since the early 2000s.|$|E
5|$|The M32 was {{considered}} inadequate for {{its role as}} an armored recovery vehicle, especially during the Korean War, because of the narrow tracks which gave the vehicle insufficient flotation to wade through water and the horsepower of the engine was insufficient to pull large tanks, such as the M26 Pershing. Some M32B1s were also shipped to Britain under Lend-Lease, where they were designated the ARV Mark III by the British Army. The Ordnance Department attempted to replace the M32 with the T12 Armored Recovery Vehicle in 1944 in M26 Pershing companies, but the T12 became too expensive, and so was never put on <b>the</b> <b>production</b> <b>line.</b> The M32 was also planned to have mine-exploding equipment, such as the T1E1 Earthworm and the T2E1 Mine Exploder. However, only the T1E1 had any service with the vehicle.|$|E
5|$|With 16,000 employees, the Glasgow factory {{was one of}} {{the largest}} {{industrial}} operations in Scotland. Unlike the Derby and Crewe plants which relied significantly on external subcontractors, it produced almost all the Merlin's components itself. Engines began to leave <b>the</b> <b>production</b> <b>line</b> in November 1940, and by June 1941 monthly output had reached 200, increasing to more than 400 per month by March 1942. In total 23,675 engines were produced. Worker absenteeism became a problem after some months due to the physical and mental effects of wartime conditions such as the frequent occupation of air-raid shelters. It was agreed to cut the punishing working hours slightly to 82 hours a week, with one half-Sunday per month awarded as holiday. Record production is reported to have been 100 engines in one day.|$|E
