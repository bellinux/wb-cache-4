5|$|Cattle grazing in <b>the</b> <b>Trout</b> Creek Mountains {{began in}} the late 19thcentury, and the BLM {{currently}} oversees grazing allotments in the area. Cattle can be found grazing in some areas during the spring and summer months. The effects of grazing on the local environment were the subject of controversy in the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Trout</b> Creek Mountains are {{composed}} mostly of basalt from a shield volcano that once stood where Steens Mountain is today. Crustal thinning and the Yellowstone hotspot, {{which was then}} beneath southeastern Oregon, induced eruptions from Steens and nearby vents about 17million years ago, in the Miocene. The vents produced a series of lava flows that spread across the land now known as <b>the</b> <b>Trout</b> Creek Mountains. Eruptions from the Steens volcano lasted for about one million years, and at least 70 separate lava flows occurred. Under the resulting basalt rock lie much older metamorphic rocks that {{may be related to}} some of the Triassic age formations of the Blue Mountains in northeastern Oregon. Within these metamorphic rocks are diorite and granodiorite intrusive bodies which were presumably intruded during the Cretaceous Period.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> tiger <b>trout</b> (Salmo trutta × Salvelinus fontinalis) is a sterile, {{intergeneric}} {{hybrid of}} <b>the</b> brown <b>trout</b> (Salmo trutta) and <b>the</b> brook <b>trout</b> (Salvelinus fontinalis). <b>The</b> name {{derives from the}} pronounced vermiculations, which evoke the stripes of a tiger. The fish is an anomaly in the wild, with <b>the</b> brook <b>trout</b> having 84 chromosomes and <b>the</b> brown <b>trout</b> 80. [...] Records show instances {{as far back as}} 1944. The cross itself is unusual in that the parents are members of different genera.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> California golden <b>trout,</b> {{or simply}} <b>the</b> golden <b>trout</b> [...] (Oncorhynchus mykiss aguabonita), is a {{subspecies}} of <b>the</b> rainbow <b>trout</b> native to California. <b>The</b> golden <b>trout</b> {{is native to}} Golden Trout Creek (tributary to the Kern River), Volcano Creek (tributary to Golden <b>Trout</b> Creek), and <b>the</b> South Fork Kern River. It is the state fish of California.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Old <b>Trout</b> Puppet Workshop is {{a puppet}} theatre company, {{founded on a}} ranch in {{southern}} Alberta in 1999. The company's first year of operation was an experience of intense collaborative isolation - <b>the</b> <b>Trouts</b> lived together, cooked together, and worked together. They collected eggs, fed the pigs, and premiered their first show to a bunkhouse full of cowboys and Hutterites. A year later, they moved to Calgary, having exhausted the joys {{of living in a}} coal-heated shack. <b>The</b> <b>Trouts</b> now travel <b>the</b> world, performing at festivals that celebrate the art of the extraordinary.|$|R
5|$|There {{are eight}} {{species of fish}} in the park: Northern pike and European perch are the most common, others include grayling, common minnow, burbot, three-spined stickleback and the least common, brown trout. <b>The</b> <b>trout</b> came up Pasvikelven about 8000 BC. The other species arrived after the last glacial period from Lake Inari and {{ultimately}} from the ten fresh-water Baltic Sea.|$|E
5|$|A 2005 {{study showed}} the {{potential}} for using probiotics for controlling S.iniae infection in trout. This study used the gastrointestinal contents of rainbow trout to scan for bacteria that inhibited growth of S.iniae and Lactococcus garvieae. They identified Aeromonas sobria as a potential candidate for control of S.iniae and L.garvieae infections in aquaculture. A.sobria, given live in the feed, protected <b>the</b> <b>trout</b> when challenged with S.iniae or L.garvieae.|$|E
5|$|The {{mountains}} {{are characteristic of}} the Great Basin's topography of mostly parallel mountain ranges alternating with flat valleys. Oriented generally north to south, <b>the</b> <b>Trout</b> Creek Mountains consist primarily of fault blocks of basalt, which came from an ancient volcano and other vents, on top of older metamorphic rocks. The {{southern end of the}} range, however, features many granitic outcrops. As a whole, the faulted terrain is dominated by rolling hills and ridges cut by escarpments and canyons.|$|E
50|$|While <b>the</b> silver <b>trout</b> is {{most likely}} lost, success stories like the Pyramid Lake (Nevada) Lahontan {{cutthroat}} <b>trout</b> and <b>the</b> Sunapee golden <b>trout</b> exist, and there may still be hope for <b>the</b> silver <b>trout.</b>|$|R
50|$|Fishes are {{generally}} abundant in water {{bodies in the}} zec. Recreative fishing is widespread for the following species which are subject to quotas: <b>the</b> brook <b>trout</b> (speckled <b>trout),</b> <b>the</b> lake <b>trout</b> (trout), walleye and pike.|$|R

5|$|The terrain in <b>the</b> <b>Trout</b> Creek Mountains {{varies from}} broad, flat basins and rolling ridges to high rock escarpments cut by deep canyons. The canyons have steep walls with loose talus slopes at the bottoms. There are meadows around springs in the mountains, {{although}} most streams {{in the range}} do not flow year-round. Major streams that flow off the north slopes of the mountains include (from west to east) Cottonwood Creek, Trout Creek, Willow Creek, and Whitehorse Creek. These streams all flow into endorheic basins in Harney County, Oregon. Trout Creek and Whitehorse Creek are {{the largest of the}} four. The Kings River and McDermitt Creek each drain an area on the south slopes of <b>the</b> <b>Trout</b> Creek Mountains. The Kings River begins in The Granites and flows south into Nevada, where it meets the Quinn River, which evaporates in the Black Rock Desert. McDermitt Creek begins in Oregon a few miles north of The Granites and flows generally east, crossing the Oregon–Nevada border five times before disappearing into the floor of the Quinn River Valley south of McDermitt.|$|E
5|$|Aquatic midges (Chironomidae) {{provide the}} highest {{proportion}} of the fly life of the lake. <b>The</b> <b>trout</b> (Salmonidae) will feed at the surface on these and water boatmen (Corixidae), and below the surface on the caddisfly (Trichoptera) larvae and pupae; they will also take the adult caddisflies when they emerge. Other aquatic fauna including daphnia and snails are {{also found in the}} lake. Large populations of dragonflies, including migrant hawker (Aeshna mixta) and significant numbers of ruddy darter (Sympetrum sanguineum), occur at the lake. Eleven species of wainscot moth make their home in the reed beds, including the nationally local brown-veined wainscot (Archanara dissoluta), twin-spotted wainscot (Archanara geminipuncta) and silky wainscot (Chilodes maritimus).|$|E
5|$|Near Tupper Lake, it skirts the {{boundary}} between Franklin and Saint Lawrence for a considerable distance before entering Tupper Lake and intersecting NY3. The two routes overlap to Harrietstown, where NY30 splits from NY3 and heads north along a series of lakes, including Upper Saranac Lake and Meacham Lake. North of Duane, NY30 exits Adirondack Park and heads north towards Malone. Within the village, NY30 briefly overlaps US11. The Adirondack Trail ends at {{the east end of}} the overlap. The route continues north out of the village to the Canada–US border in Constable, where it becomes Route138 upon entering Quebec at <b>the</b> <b>Trout</b> River Border Crossing.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> Sunapee <b>trout</b> {{also called}} blueback trout, Sunapee Golden trout or Quebec red trout (Salvelinus alpinus oquassa) is a {{putative}} subspecies of Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus) {{native to the}} northeast United States, Québec, and New Brunswick. Originally described as three separate species--S. oquassa, <b>the</b> blueback <b>trout</b> of Lake Oquassa in Maine (1854), S. aureolus <b>the</b> golden <b>trout</b> of Sunapee lake in New Hampshire (1888) and S. marstoni <b>the</b> Quebec red <b>trout</b> (1893).|$|R
5|$|Telopea oreades is {{not listed}} under Commonwealth {{environmental}} legislation {{and is not}} considered by respective state authorities to be rare or threatened in Victoria or New South Wales. The species does occur in the threatened Cool Temperate Rainforest Community in Victoria that is protected under the Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act, {{and it is a}} component of the threatened Southern Escarpment Wet Sclerophyll Forests of far southern New South Wales. Furthermore, planted specimens are frequently stolen from bush regeneration sites as they are desirable garden plants. Conversely in New Zealand, there is a report of T. oreades escaping into kanuka scrub from <b>the</b> <b>trout</b> hatchery gardens on the Tongariro River south of Lake Taupo.|$|E
5|$|The PGC {{established}} the Northcentral State Game Farm in 1945 {{on part of}} State Game Lands 134 to raise wild turkey. The farm was converted to ringneck pheasant production in 1981, and, as of 2007, {{it was one of}} four Pennsylvania state game farms that produced about 200,000 pheasants each year for release on land open to public hunting. The Northcentral State Game Farm is chiefly in the Plunketts Creek valley, just south of Proctor and north of the bridge. The opening weekend of <b>the</b> <b>trout</b> season brings more people into the village of Barbours at the mouth of Plunketts Creek than any other time of the year.|$|E
5|$|The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) administers most land in <b>the</b> <b>Trout</b> Creek Mountains, {{but there}} are also some private lands and some roads in the area. The private lands are mainly used for {{ranching}} along mountain streams, while the BLM lands include large grazing allotments for local ranchers' cattle. At least 100 mining claims in the mountains have been recorded since 1892, some of which were staked for gold exploration. Commercial mining has occurred in some areas, mostly near the McDermitt Caldera, where uranium and large amounts of mercury have been extracted. Mines in what was called the Opalite Mining District produced 270,000 flasks of mercury—"the richest supply of mercury in the western hemisphere"—from cinnabar extracted from the caldera in the 20thcentury. The two leading mercury-producing mines in North America were the Cordero and McDermitt mines {{on the edge of the}} caldera in Nevada. Together, they operated from 1933 to 1989. The McDermitt Mine, the last mercury mine in the United States, closed three years later, in 1992. However, mineral exploration has continued at the Cordero Mine in the 21stcentury, and waste containing mercury and arsenic was returned there from the community of McDermitt as part of a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency cleanup project.|$|E

5|$|The adult {{stage of}} a caddisfly may only survive for a few weeks; many species do not feed as adults and die soon after breeding, but some species are known to feed on nectar. The winged insects are nocturnal and provide food for night-flying birds, bats, small mammals, {{amphibians}} and arthropods. The larval stage lasts much longer, often for one or more years, and has a bigger impact on the environment. They form {{an important part of}} the diet of fish such as <b>the</b> <b>trout.</b> The fish acquire them by two means, either plucking them off vegetation or the stream-bed as the larvae move about, or during the daily behavioural drift; this drift happens during the night for many species of aquatic larvae, or around midday for some cased caddisfly species, and may result from population pressures or be a dispersal device. The larvae may drift in great numbers either close to the bottom, in mid-water or just below the surface. The fish swallow them whole, case and all.|$|E
25|$|Once {{the hook}} has been removed, return <b>the</b> <b>trout</b> into the water. Support <b>the</b> <b>trout</b> until it stabilizes. This {{includes}} holding {{the fish in}} water deep enough to submerge its gills. After long fights, {{it may be necessary}} to manually move water past its gills. This can be done either by holding <b>the</b> <b>trout</b> in moving water with its head facing upstream, or, in calm water, moving <b>the</b> <b>trout</b> backwards and forwards repeatedly. Once stabilized, <b>the</b> <b>trout</b> will swim off on its own. If released prematurely, <b>the</b> <b>trout,</b> not having enough energy to move, will sink to the bottom of the river and suffocate. Take however long is necessary to revive a trout.|$|E

25|$|Inland grizzlies may eat fish too, {{most notably}} in Yellowstone grizzlies eating Yellowstone {{cutthroat}} trout. The relationship with cutthroat trout and grizzlies is unique {{because it is the}} only example where Rocky Mountain grizzlies feed on spawning salmonid fish. However, grizzly bears themselves and invasive lake trout threaten the survival of <b>the</b> <b>trout</b> population and there is a slight chance that <b>the</b> <b>trout</b> will be eliminated.|$|E

50|$|Today, {{the main}} risk to <b>the</b> Apache <b>trout</b> is its easy {{hybridization}} with <b>the</b> rainbow <b>trout</b> and major forest fires. Cutthroat trout are also genetically similar and cross-breed with Apache <b>trout,</b> compromising <b>the</b> genetic purity of each species. The range of <b>the</b> Apache <b>trout</b> remains limited, which puts it at risk, {{but it is}} now common enough that limited fishing is permitted.|$|R
50|$|For {{most of the}} 19th and 20th centuries, <b>the</b> Dolly Varden <b>trout</b> (S. malma) and <b>the</b> bull <b>trout</b> (S. confluentus) were {{considered}} the same species. Additionally, the Arctic char (S. alpinus) along with <b>the</b> bull <b>trout</b> have ranges that overlap and are remarkably similar in appearance, thus complicating identification. In 1978, inland forms of <b>the</b> Dolly Varden <b>trout</b> were reclassified as Salvelinus confluentus, retaining the common name bull trout. It appears that the first recorded use of the Dolly Varden name for fish referred to S. confluentus, now commonly known as <b>the</b> bull <b>trout.</b> This was likely due to overlapping ranges and similar appearances {{among members of the}} two species.|$|R
