5|$|When the Welsh {{family moved}} to Los Angeles, the Earps {{accepted}} an invitation to stay with <b>them</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> in their top-floor apartment until the Earps found a place to rent. After Earp and Sadie moved into a bungalow nearby, Charlie Welsh's daughter, Grace Spolidora, recalled that Sadie, who had never had many domestic skills, did very little housekeeping or cooking for Wyatt. She and her sister Alma {{were concerned about the}} care Sadie gave Wyatt. Though he was at times very ill, she still did not cook for him. Spolidora, her sisters, and her mother brought in meals.|$|E

The Skraelings fire {{missiles}} at <b>them</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> and then retreat. Thorvald receives a fatal wound and is buried in Vinland. His crew returns to Greenland.|$|E
25|$|With the Flower Maiden gone, {{the wolves}} {{have no reason}} to stay in the city. Despite some initial misgivings and suspicions, they decide to stay {{together}} and follow Kiba in his search for the Flower Maiden and Paradise. As they pursue Cheza, the wolves travel through various cities and the remnants of former habitations. Cher joins the city's army to try to recover Cheza, while Cher's ex-husband Hubb Lebowski searches desperately for Cher, and Quent continues his relentless pursuit of the wolves. When Blue eventually encounters Cheza, it awakens her wolf blood from dormancy and causes her to leave Quent and take on her own human form. She joins the wolves and travels with <b>them</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while,</b> developing an intense and close romantic relationship with Hige, and meanwhile Hubb finds himself traveling with Quent, who is now searching for Blue as well as the wolves. Hubb eventually finds Cher and from there they continue their pursuit of the wolves to find Cheza.|$|E

25|$|Next up Sabu {{took part}} in WWA European tour of November–December 2002. This {{included}} the Retribution PPV in Glasgow, which was broadcast two months later in February 2003. On this tour and PPV he fought former fellow ECW stars Perry Saturn and Simon Diamond in a three-way hardcore match. Sabu took the victory {{in each of these}} matches, usually gaining the pinfall over Diamond after Saturn left the match to defend his companion. His final appearance for the WWA came in their last PPV, The Reckoning, in New Zealand. During this tour he first fought Shane Douglas but due to injury he did not face him at the PPV. Instead Douglas came to the ring and eventually allowed Joe E Legend to face Sabu instead. Sabu won this match, his second and last WWA match ever. When the All World Wrestling League began in April 2003 (a spin-off of Big Time Wrestling), which was run by Eddie & Tom Farhat, Sabu joined <b>them</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while,</b> before he left for another territory.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "In My Place" [...] was {{directed}} by Sophie Muller. It debuted on 17 June 2002 on AOL. It features a by-the-numbers band performance, in which Coldplay are playing in a huge, nearly empty room. The two women in the background {{were members of the}} video crew: a makeup artist/wardrobe assistant and the video commissioner. The video starts off with band playing; while they play, Chris Martin, who is sitting in a corner, gets up and joins them in the song. During the video, Martin sings directly to the camera. During the guitar solo, Martin runs up to the two women in the background, talks to <b>them</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while,</b> and then returns to sing the rest of the song. The video concludes with the band finishing the song.|$|E
2500|$|Banding {{together}} with the Hulk and Namor the Sub-Mariner during these wanderings, the Surfer forms the [...] "Titans Three", a group dedicated to battling evil on Earth. Soon, Doctor Strange joins the group and it becomes [...] "The Defenders." [...] Surfer stays with <b>them</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while,</b> but his overwhelming desire {{to be free of}} Earth and his frequent collisions with Galactus' energy-draining barrier eventually drives him to leave the group.|$|E

2500|$|Johnson {{organised}} small raiding parties, {{which were}} sent against the settlements of the French and their Indian allies. In accordance with New York's Scalp Act of 1747, Johnson paid bounties for scalps, although he realised this encouraged the scalping of non-combatants {{of all ages}} and both sexes. In June 1748, Johnson was made [...] "Colonel of the New York levies", a position that gave him additional responsibility for the colonial militias at Albany. In July 1748, word was received of a peace settlement. The Mohawk had suffered heavy casualties in the war, which lessened Johnson's prestige among <b>them</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while.</b>|$|E
2500|$|As in {{the first}} game, the player {{must be aware of}} [...] "heat" [...] at all times. Shooting rival family members in public, killing {{innocent}} people, or attacking police officers will all raise heat levels. If the level gets too high, police will fire upon the player on sight. To avoid this, the player can bribe police to ignore <b>them</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while.</b> The game also introduces witnesses. When the player commits a crime, a yellow circle appears on the mini-map. This is the crime scene, and police will soon arrive to investigate. On occasion, a member of the public will be willing to identify the player to the police. If this happens when the player is still within the yellow circle, the police will attack. To avoid this, the player can either intimidate or bribe witnesses into not talking before the police arrive on the scene.|$|E
2500|$|As well as vendetta levels, {{the player}} {{must also be}} aware of [...] "heat" [...] during the game. Shooting rival family members in public, killing {{innocent}} people, or attacking police officers will all raise heat levels. If the level gets too high, police will fire upon the player on sight. To avoid this, the player can bribe police to ignore <b>them</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while.</b> Bribing a police captain will earn the player more time during which the police {{turn a blind eye}} than bribing a street cop. In the Xbox 360, Wii and PlayStation 3 versions, bribed police will often fight on the player's side in shootouts with rival families. Also in the Xbox 360, Wii and PlayStation 3 versions, the player can blackmail rather than bribe the captain, but only if certain information has been learned from an NPC about the captain's activities.|$|E

2500|$|In {{their earlier}} appeals, {{the defense was}} limited to the trial record. The Governor's Committee, however, was not a {{judicial}} proceeding, so Judge Thayer's comments outside the courtroom could be used to demonstrate his bias. Once Thayer told reporters that [...] "No long-haired anarchist from California can run this court!" [...] According to the affidavits of eyewitnesses, Thayer also lectured members of his clubs, calling Sacco and Vanzetti [...] "Bolsheviki!" [...] and saying he would [...] "get them good and proper". During the Dedham trial's first week, Thayer said to reporters: [...] "Did you ever see a case in which so many leaflets and circulars have been spread...saying people couldn't get a fair trial in Massachusetts? You wait till I give my charge to the jury, I'll show them!" [...] In 1924, Thayer confronted a Massachusetts lawyer at Dartmouth, his alma mater, and said: [...] "Did you see what I did with those anarchistic bastards the other day. I guess that will hold <b>them</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while....</b> Let them go to the Supreme Court now and see what they can get out of them." [...] The Committee knew that, following the verdict, Boston Globe reporter Frank Sibley, who had covered the trial, wrote a protest to the Massachusetts attorney general condemning Thayer's blatant bias. Thayer's behavior both inside the courtroom and outside of it had become a public issue, with the New York World attacking Thayer as [...] "an agitated little man looking for publicity and utterly impervious to the ethical standards one has the right to expect of a man presiding in a capital case." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Yepanchins' {{visit is}} rudely {{interrupted}} {{by the arrival of}} Burdovsky, a young man who claims to be the illegitimate son of Myshkin's late benefactor, Pavlishchev. The inarticulate Burdovsky is supported by a group of insolent young men. These include the consumptive seventeen-year-old Ippolit Terentyev—a friend of Kolya's—who surprises everyone with his shrill, hysterical voice; the nihilist Doctorenko, who is Lebedyev's nephew; and Keller, an ex-officer who, with the help of Lebedyev, has written an article vilifying the Prince and Pavlishchev. They demand money from Myshkin as a [...] "just" [...] reimbursement for Pavlishchev's support, but their arrogant bravado is severely dented when Gavril Ardalionovich, who has been researching the matter on Myshkin's behalf, proves conclusively that the claim is false and that Burdovsky has been deceived. The Prince tries to reconcile with the young men and offers financial support anyway. Disgusted by the young men and the Prince's conciliatory attitude, Lizaveta Prokofyevna loses all control and furiously attacks both parties. This causes Ippolit to laugh and Lizaveta Prokofyevna seizes him by the arm. Ippolit breaks into a prolonged fit of coughing, but he suddenly becomes calm, informs them all that he is near death, and politely requests that he be permitted to talk to <b>them</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while.</b> He awkwardly attempts to express his need for their love, eventually bringing both himself and Lizaveta Prokofyevna to the point of tears. But as the Prince and Lizaveta Prokofyevna discuss {{what to do with the}} invalid, another transformation occurs and Ippolit, after unleashing a torrent of abuse at the Prince, leaves with the other young men. The Yepanchins also leave, both Lizaveta Prokofyevna and Aglaya deeply indignant with the Prince. Only Yevgeny Pavlovich remains in good spirits, and he smiles charmingly as he says good-bye. At that moment, a magnificent carriage suddenly pulls up at the dacha, and the ringing voice of Nastassya Filippovna calls out to Yevgeny Pavlovich. In a laughing, familiar tone she tells him not to worry about all the IOUs as Rogozhin has bought them up. The carriage departs, leaving everyone, particularly Yevgeny Pavlovich and the Prince, in a state of shock. Yevgeny Pavlovich claims to know nothing about the debts, and Nastassya Filippovna's motives become a subject of anxious speculation.|$|E

60|$|This {{gave them}} {{something}} to do and made <b>them</b> happy <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while,</b> and Dot was profoundly grateful <b>for</b> <b>a</b> period of rest and quiet; but she feared the dolls would break forth into more mischief before the day passed, and so it proved.|$|R
60|$|So Rosamund came forward, {{and without}} a word gave her right hand to Godwin and her left to Wulf, and {{suffered}} that they should press their lips upon <b>them.</b> So <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> this {{was the end of}} their asking of her in marriage.|$|R
50|$|When Landsborough arrived {{he learned}} that his {{brothers}} had taken up land at Tenningering, about fifty miles south-west of today’s city of Bundaberg.

6000|$|After Sir James had seated himself, the two {{standing}} facing him, {{he regarded}} <b>them</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> in silence. [...] "How now, Walter Blunt," [...] said he at last, [...] "what is to do?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Drive them a long distance, hide <b>them</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while,</b> and then, {{when they}} get the chance, sell them. Of course they don't expect to get full value for them, but they'll get a neat sum." ...|$|E
60|$|He drew {{nearer to}} her, {{and now he}} put his arms about her and clasped her to his bosom; nor did she say him nay. Swanhild saw and lifted herself up behind <b>them,</b> but <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> she heard nothing but the beating of her heart.|$|R
60|$|And {{now there}} was music and dancing {{throughout}} the whole town of Mansoul, and that because their Prince had again granted to them his presence and the light of his countenance; the bells also did ring, and the sun shone comfortably upon <b>them</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> great <b>while</b> together.|$|R
60|$|So {{they went}} fast as their swift steeds would carry <b>them,</b> but <b>for</b> <b>a</b> little <b>while</b> Ayesha still sat lost in thought.|$|R

60|$|Tarzan of the Apes watched <b>them</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> {{from his}} lofty perch {{in the great}} tree. There was much in their {{demeanor}} which he could not understand, for of superstition he was ignorant, and of fear of any kind he had but a vague conception.|$|E
