40|$|Laboratory animals {{exposed to}} feeding <b>ticks</b> develop <b>resistance</b> which is {{reflected}} by {{a decline in}} tick engorgement weight, egg-laying by adults and reduced egg viability. Serum antibodies from these hosts and their reaction with tick antigens have been detected by different methods, including precipitation techniques, immunofluorescent techniques, ELISA and Western blots. However, {{little is known about}} the effects of antibodies on ticks that engorge on resistant hosts, or which tissues of the tick body are possibly immunogenic. Some researchers, using immunohistochemistry, have detected host antibodies in the gut, salivary glands and haemolymph of ticks engorged on resistant animals. The same technique has helped considerably in determining antigenic sites or antibody targets in other arthropods. Consequently, immunohistochemistry techniques were used in this study to detect cross-reactivity between sera raised against Amblyomma cajennense (Fabricius, 1787) with Amblyomma hebraeum (Koch, 1844), and vice versa. The results show the existence of shared antigens between the 2 tick species. In general, our results point more to a 1 -way cross-reactivity of A. hebraeum with A. cajennense than a reciprocal crossreactivity, suggesting that A. hebraeum is more immunogenic than A. cajennense...|$|R
40|$|In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} renewed {{interest}} in the adaptation of cattle to challenging environments, largely driven by advances in genomic methods. The current interest in <b>tick</b> <b>resistance</b> is understandable given the major production and welfare implications of tick infestation in tropical and subtropical zones where around 70 % of beef cattle are located. Heritability for tick burden in cattle has been shown to range about 0. 30, which is sufficient to result in the success of some programs of selection for <b>tick</b> <b>resistance</b> in cattle. Gene-expression studies strongly indicate that both immune and non-immune mechanisms are associated with <b>tick</b> <b>resistance</b> in cattle. Recent quantitative-trait mapping studies have identified chromosome segments and single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with tick burden, but no causal variant has been identified so far. Most of the genetic markers identified for tick burden explain a relatively small proportion of the variance, which is typical of markers for quantitative traits. This leads to the conclusion that panels of multiple markers for <b>tick</b> <b>resistance</b> rather than a single marker will most likely be developed, possibly involving specific panels for zebu or taurine breeds, which could be used for future selection and breeding programs in cattle...|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanisms}} underlying <b>tick</b> <b>resistance</b> {{within and}} between cattle breeds have been studied for decades. Several previous papers on bovine immune parameters contributing to <b>tick</b> <b>resistance</b> discussed findings across DNA, RNA, protein, cellular, and tissue levels. However, the differences between bovine host species, tick species and the experimental layouts were not always taken into account. This review aims to (a) give a comprehensive summary of studies investigating immune marker differences between cattle breeds {{with varying degrees of}} <b>tick</b> <b>resistance,</b> and (b) to integrate key findings and suggest hypotheses on likely immune-regulated pathways driving resistance. Experimental issues, which may have skewed conclusions, are highlighted. In future, improved experimental strategies will enable more focused studies to identify and integrate immune markers and/or pathways. Most conclusive thus far is the involvement of histamine, granulocytes and their associated pathways in the tick-resistance mechanism. Interestingly, different immune markers might be involved in the mechanisms within a single host breed in contrast to between breeds. Also, differences are evident at each tick life stage, limiting the level to which datasets can be compared. Future studies to further elucidate immune molecule dynamics across the entire tick life cycle and in-depth investigation of promising markers and pathways on both molecular and cellular level are in dire need to obtain a scientifically sound hypothesis on the drivers of <b>tick</b> <b>resistance...</b>|$|E

Weight of egg mass (73. 98 %), number of deposited eggs (74. 55 %), and the egg conversion factor (33. 9 %). The resistance to the feeding of immature stages was characterized by significant reduction in the nymphal engorgement weight (61. 45 %) and larval-nymphal moultability (42. 5 %). The viability of eggs and larval nymphal feeding period were not affected by the repeated feeding of <b>ticks.</b> The <b>resistance</b> induced by repeated adult feeding lead to significant protection of rabbits against subsequent larval-nymphal feeding. Meanwhile, immunological resistance induced by feeding of immature stages did not protect rabbits against subsequent adult feeding.

The indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) test proved to be a valuable means of monitoring the serological response of vaccinated animals and detecting the sero-conversion of animals exposed to tick infection. On one hand, there was good correlation between the febrile reaction and the results of the IFA test on the sera of vaccinated and control cattle challenged with the heartwater agent, in that all sero-positive animals were resistant to challenge.

Genetic variation between Bos taurus and Bos indicus to <b>tick</b> <b>resistance</b> and molecular biology tools might allow for the identification of molecular markers linked to resistance traits {{that could be used}} as an auxiliary tool in selection programs. The objective of this work was to identify QTL associated with tick resistance/susceptibility in a bovine F 2 population derived from the Gyr (Bos indicus) × Holstein (Bos taurus) cross. Results Through a whole genome scan with microsatellite markers, we were able to map six genomic regions associated with bovine <b>tick</b> <b>resistance.</b> For most QTL, we have found that depending on the tick evaluation season (dry and rainy) different sets of genes could be involved in the resistance mechanism. We identified dry season specific QTL on BTA 2 and 10, rainy season specific QTL on BTA 5, 11 and 27. We also found a highly significant genome wide QTL for both dry and rainy seasons in the central region of BTA 23. Conclusions The experimental F 2 population derived from Gyr × Holstein cross successfully allowed the identification of six highly significant QTL associated with <b>tick</b> <b>resistance</b> in cattle.

Resistant hosts {{were characterized by}} allowing significantly fewer larvae to engorge than non-resistant hosts. Larvae engorging on non-resistant hosts had a mean weight six times that of larvae obtained from resistant hosts {{at the end of}} a 5 -day infestation. This immunologically based resistance was previously shown to have a cell-mediated and a humoral component. In an attempt to ascertain the role of complement in the resistance response, cobra venom factor (CoF) was administered to guinea-pigs producing prolonged (85 – 95 per cent) depletion of complement titres. CoF was administered during an initial infestation with tick larvae to determine if complement depletion altered the acquisition of <b>tick</b> <b>resistance.</b> CoF was also administered to tick-resistant hosts in an attempt to determine if the expression of <b>tick</b> <b>resistance</b> and the development of the basophil-packed lesion, characteristic of the tick-attachment site in resistant hosts, could be altered by complement depletion. CoF did not alter the acquisition of resistance when complement levels were reduced during a primary infestation. However, complement depletion of an animal which had acquired <b>tick</b> <b>resistance</b> blocked the expression of that resistance during a challenge infestation. In addition to increased numbers and weights of larvae engorging on tick-resistant animals depleted of complement, the basophil packed lesion at the tick attachment site was greatly reduced.

A cross-sectional survey was conducted and 110 farmers in four villages in the sour and sweet velds of the Eastern Cape Province, South Africa were interviewed. The associations among area (municipality), gender, age, level of education, employment and religion were computed using Chi-square tests. The majority of the respondents had on average 4 bulls, 4 cows, 4 heifers, 4 calves, and 4 oxen. Milk was considered as the major (28. 3 %) reason for keeping cattle. Most farmers owned non-descript (72. 6 %), and Nguni (45. 3 %) cattle because of their heat tolerance (54. 7 %), <b>tick</b> <b>resistance</b> (54. 7 %), and milking ability (28. 2 %) traits.

Lack of access to efficacious long-lasting vaccination regimes and increases in <b>tick</b> acaricide <b>resistance</b> have led to the investigation of targets for the development of novel tick vaccines and treatments. In vitro tick feeding has been used for many tick species to study the effect of new acaricides on the transmission of tick-borne pathogens. Few studies have reported the use of in vitro feeding for functional genomic studies using RNA interference and/or the effect of specific anti-tick antibodies. In particular, in vitro feeding reports for the cattle tick are limited due to its relatively short hypostome. Previously published methods were further modified to broaden optimal tick sizes/weights, feeding sources including bovine and ovine serum, optimisation of commercially available blood anti-coagulant tubes, and IgG concentrations for effective antibody delivery. Ticks are fed overnight and monitored for ~ 5 - 6 weeks to determine egg output and success of larval emergence using a humidified incubator. Lithium-heparin blood tubes provided the most reliable anti-coagulant for bovine blood feeding compared with commercial citrated (CPDA) and EDTA tubes. Although > 30. mg semi-engorged ticks fed more reliably, ticks as small as 15. mg also fed to repletion to lay viable eggs. Ticks which gained less than ~ 10. mg during in vitro feeding typically did not lay eggs. One mg/ml IgG from Bm 86 -vaccinated cattle produced a potent anti-tick effect in vitro (83 % efficacy) similar to that observed in vivo.

In the cattle <b>tick,</b> Boophilus microplus, <b>resistance</b> {{to a variety of}} acaricides is widespread. The most commonly used assay for resistance, the larval packet test, takes at least two, but generally six weeks for a one-host tick like B. microplus to complete and may take up to three months to complete for three-host ticks. Here we describe a test for resistance to organophosphate acaricides that can be used on larvae and adult ticks which takes less than 24 hours. The test measures the difference in acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in homogenates of ticks in the presence and absence of propoxur, a carbamate acaricide. We found clear discrimination of organophosphate-susceptible and organophosphate-resistant adults with 100 mu M propoxur. AChE from susceptible ticks had almost no activity at this concentration of propoxur whereas AChE from resistant ticks had 67 % of its potential activity. AChE from heterozygote ticks could also be distinguished from AChE from homozygous-susceptible and homozygous-resistant ticks. This is the first biochemical test for resistance to an acaricide. Rapid, sensitive tests like ours will allow resistance to organophosphates to be detected soon after it develops in the field, thus, the spread of resistance might be slowed and the useful life of acaricides extended...|$|R

We identified dry season specific QTL on BTA 2 and 10, rainy season specific QTL on BTA 5, 11 and 27. We also found a highly significant genome wide QTL for both dry and rainy seasons in the central region of BTA 23. Conclusions: The experimental F 2 population derived from Gyr x Holstein cross successfully allowed the identification of six highly significant QTL associated with <b>tick</b> <b>resistance</b> in cattle. QTL located on BTA 23 might be related with the bovine histocompatibility complex. Further investigation of these QTL will help to isolate candidate genes involved with <b>tick</b> <b>resistance</b> in cattle.

40|$|Resistance to acaricides in ticks is {{becoming}} increasingly widespread throughout the world; therefore, <b>tick</b> control requires <b>resistance</b> monitoring for each tick species. The aims {{of this study were}} to monitor the susceptibility status of the cattle tick, Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) annulatus (Acari: Ixodidae), against pyrethroid acaricides from Mazandaran Province, northern Iran, and where resistance was evident, and establish the possible underlying mechanisms. Fully engorged adult R. (B.) annulatus females collected on cattle from Mazandaran Province. Twenty-nine tick populations produced 10 – 18 days old larvae and bioassayed with cypermethrin and λ-cyhalothrin by larval packet test and the levels of detoxification enzymes were measured. Population AM- 29 had a maximum resistance ratio (RR 99) of 20. 21 to cypermethrin and 53. 57 % of the tick populations were resistant at LC 99 level. With λ-cyhalothrin, 17. 86 % of the tick populations were resistant and AM- 29 was the most resistant population with RR 99 = 4. 54. AM- 29 also showed significant elevation of cytochrome P 450 monooxygenase (P 450) and glutathione S-transferase (GST) (2. 76 - and 2. 39 -fold, respectively) (P < 0. 001). Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) annulatus showed resistance to pyrethroid insecticides with elevated levels of P 450, GST and para-nitrophenyl acetate (p-NPA) in resistant populations. Operational failure was noted in controlling R. (B.) annulatus by pyrethroid insecticides, therefore alternative pest management measures should be adopted in Iran. For the first time, a new estimate of insecticide resistance based on effective dose recommended by the pesticide manufacturer termed Operational Dose Ratio (ODR) is defined and discussed...|$|R
40|$|Proceedings of the 2011 Georgia Water Resources Conference, April 11, 12, and 13, 2011, Athens, Georgia. From {{the early}} 1900 s to 1961, cattle ranchers in Southern states, {{particularly}} Arkansas, Georgia, Florida, and Texas, {{were required to}} control ticks on cattle to prevent Texas Cattle Fever, a disease that impacted cattle in the South. A United States Department of Agriculture program provided for the construction and operation of over 3, 200 cattle dip vats. Solutions containing arsenic were initially used, until the <b>ticks</b> developed a <b>resistance</b> to the arsenic solution. Around the mid- 1940 s, arsenical pesticides were replaced by organochlorinated pesticides. The historic operations of cattle dip vats have lingering impacts on groundwater and soil that {{pose a threat to}} human health and the environment. Geosyntec Consultants has contracted with the Florida Department of Environmental Protection to evaluate groundwater and soil impacts associated with historic cattle dip vats that are located in the Florida State Park System. A multi-faceted approach was used to characterize contaminant migration in groundwater and soils with respect to historical site operations, archaeological preservation, and environmental health. Several case studies at state parks located across Florida are presented, including methods of delineation and remediation. The approaches employed in these studies will assist others in future investigations of historic cattle dip vats that exist across the South, including Georgia.

40|$|Rhipicephalus microplus {{belongs to}} the Ixodidae, the largest family of ticks, which are of great {{economic}} importance due to their negative socio-economic impact on agriculture (BROUQUI 2011; PORTO NETOA et al. 2011; SONENSHINE 1991). Acaricides {{have been the first}} choice in tick control for cattle farmers, but R. microplus rapidly acquires resistance to these chemicals. Replication slippage and recombination drive genetic diversity in tick populations (BAFFI et al. 2007; GUERRERO et al. 2007; LI et al. 2007); generating point mutations and frame shifts within the genes targeted by acaricides, resulting in resistance (BAFFI et al. 2007; HERNANDEZ et al. 2002; HERNANDEZ et al. 2000; JONSSON et al. 2010; MORGAN et al. 2009). In addition, resistance can quickly accumulate in a population due to the pangamy mating structure of ticks (CHEVILLON et al. 2007 b; CUTULLÉ et al. 2010) and their ability to produce multiple generations within one season (BUDELI et al. 2009; LI et al. 2007). Vaccines have become increasingly important to control <b>ticks,</b> as acaricide <b>resistance</b> can be acquired by field tick populations within two years (RODRIGUEZ-VIVAS et al. 2011). Although Bm 86 has been successful against multiple-acaricide resistant ticks, recent reports indicate that the Bm 86 vaccine has become ineffective, possibly due to resistance (PARIZI et al. 2009). Also, Bm 86 vaccines display great variability in terms of their efficacy against ticks isolated across Argentina (GARCIA-GARCIA et al. 2000; PARIZI et al. 2009). This is hypothesised to be due to the genetic variability between R. micoplus populations. The majority of phylogenetic studies on ticks have been based on slow evolving sequences, such as 18 S or 28 S rRNA, which provide genus-level resolution. The COI, D 3, ANT and ITS 2 genes have the potential to resolve intra-specific and interspecies variation, and may assist with the identification of cryptic speciation within R. microplus of South Africa (ANSTEAD et al. 2011; BARKER 1998; CAREW et al. 2009; MURRELL et al. 2000; SONGA et al. 2011). Phylogeography is a multidisciplinary field that utilises phylogenetic (molecular evidence of speciation) and population genetic principles (coalescence theory), in combination with additional data (such as geography and population history), to determine the genetic relationships of populations within a species (AVISE 2009) {{and was one of the}} main aspects of this study. The phylogenetic and population genetic structure of R. microplus will provide valuable information to geneticists, farmers and acaricide/vaccine suppliers about the different R. microplus tick populations of South Africa. The information will facilitate more efficient and targeted tick control whether acaricide or vaccine based as opposed to the inefficient approaches generally adopted to tick control.
