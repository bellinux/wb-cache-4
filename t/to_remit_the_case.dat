25|$|Goran Jelisic, in 1999, {{pleaded guilty}} to the charges of crimes against {{humanity}} and violating the laws and customs of war and {{pleaded not guilty to}} genocide. The Trial Chamber found that, despite discriminatory intent and the commission of acts within the definition of the actus reus of genocide, Jelisić did not have the requisite intent to destroy {{in whole or in part}} the Muslim group from Brčko. He was sentenced to 40 years imprisonment. The Appeals Chamber, among other things, held that the Trial Chamber’s erroneous application of the standard under Rule 98 bis(B) led to an incorrect assessment of the evidence as insufficient to sustain a conviction for genocide, but it did not consider it appropriate to reverse the acquittal and <b>to</b> <b>remit</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> for further proceedings, since a retrial would only be limited to the question of whether Jelisić possessed the genocidal intent, and thus it affirmed the sentence. On 29 May 2003, Jelisić was transferred to Italy to serve the remainder of his sentence with credit for time served since his arrest on 22 January 1998.|$|E

The Tribunal erred, because (1) it could not be discrimination to treat all employees in the same way (2) the appropriate comparator was a hypothetical someone who disliked gay people without it being due to a religious belief (3) looking at the plain words of regulation 5 it was clear that Ladele had not been harassed.|$|E

50|$|Following a {{conviction}} under solemn proceedings in a sheriff court, Section 195 of the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995 allows a sheriff <b>to</b> <b>remit</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> to the High Court for sentencing, should the sheriff believes their powers of sentencing to be inadequate {{for the crime}} committed. A sheriff in solemn proceedings can impose a maximum sentence of up to 5 years imprisonment or an unlimited fine, and the High Court can impose a life sentence (unless a lesser maximum sentence is prescribed by statute) {{as well as an}} unlimited fine. Once a case is remitted, the High Court can treat the case {{as if it had been}} tried before a Lord Commissioner of Justiciary.|$|E
5000|$|On 25 December 2008, {{prosecutors}} of {{the same}} counsel appealed {{for the second time}} for continued detention of the former President. In this second appeal, the prosecution urged the Taiwan High Court to decide to detain or release Chen rather than remit the case to Judge Chou Chan-chun (周占春) again. Reversing their initial decision not to appeal, Special Counsel prosecutors submitted their written appeal to the Taiwan high court, requesting that Chen be detained. The grounds for the detention remain the same (fear that the former President might leave the country, conspire with witnesses or destroy evidence). The chances are that the High Court will pass the buck back to Chou, who said in releasing Chen for the second time, he hopes he would not have to hand down the same ruling again. One reason for the appellate court <b>to</b> <b>remit</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> again is that the Special Counsel failed to elaborate on the possibility of Chen’s intimidation of other defendants. Rather it kept on elaborating on the possibility of Chen’s escape alone. Another piece of evidence produced to sustain this second appeal was the fact that bodyguards stay overnight {{on the ground floor of}} the Paolai Estate in Taipei, where the Chens live in an 11th floor apartment. [...] "There is little chance the bodyguards would know what is happening on the 11th floor," [...] the new appeal says.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the plight of}} the innocent person who has been wrongly convicted. It starts from the premise that such a fate is abhorrent and that the criminal justice system should have effective mechanisms in place to correct such errors. The Court of Appeal (Criminal Division) (CACD) has stated that it is not part of its function to consider ‘innocence’. Only the safety of a conviction is within its purview. The Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC) cannot correct an error itself, but can invite the CACD to consider doing so if it, CCRC, considers that there is a ‘real possibility’ of the CACD quashing the conviction. My hypothesis was that, in the light of these stated positions, neither the CACD nor CCRC does treat ‘innocence’ as a discrete criterion in determining appeals and applications respectively. I tested this hypothesis by examining CACD judgments delivered in 2009 and judgments on CCRC conviction referrals in the period 1997 - 2011. I examined 404 case files at CCRC. I found that neither body gave consideration explicitly to whether the applicant/appellant was ‘innocent’. I then considered whether ‘innocence’ could and should be an explicit consideration for either body. I argue that while ‘innocence’ could be designated a material consideration it should not be. The most important change that Parliament should make is to CACD’s application of the appeal test: that is the real obstacle for appellants who claim they are innocent. I propose that the CACD should be required by statute to receive fresh evidence more readily, and in some fresh evidence cases required <b>to</b> <b>remit</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> for retrial. Such changes would impact positively upon CCRC, which would then be able to refer more cases in which the applicant might be innocent...|$|E
