Typical traditional music instruments belong to the tamburica and bagpipe family. The tamburica is the most representative musical instrument associated with Slavonia's <b>traditional</b> <b>culture.</b> It developed from music instruments brought by the Ottomans during their rule of Slavonia, becoming {{an integral part of}} the traditional music, its use surpassing or even replacing the use of bagpipes and gusle. A distinct form of traditional song, originating in Slavonia, the bećarac, is recognized as an intangible cultural heritage by UNESCO.|$|E

5|$|With {{the growing}} {{industrialization}} that accelerated during the 20th and 21st century, Italian society gradually moved from an agricultural base to an urban and industrial center. This change weakened <b>traditional</b> <b>culture</b> {{in many parts}} of society; a similar process occurred in other European countries, but unlike them, Italy had no major initiative to preserve traditional musics. Immigration from North Africa, Asia, and other European countries led to further diversification of Italian music. Traditional music came to exist only in small pockets, especially as part of dedicated campaigns to retain local musical identities.|$|E
5|$|Although Poedjangga Baroe {{writers were}} united by nationalism, they had {{different}} views on <b>traditional</b> <b>culture.</b> Some, such as Armijn and Alisjahbana, considered {{an understanding of}} Western culture and history key to development. Others, such Sanusi, emphasized the need for Eastern values, though they accepted some aspects of Western culture. Writers for Poedjangga Baroe did not share religious views. Main contributors, including the founders, came from religious backgrounds ranging from near-secularism to orthodox Islam. Stemming from these conflicting cultural views, between September 1935 and June 1939, numerous polemics {{were published in the}} magazine, discussing the best course of action for Indonesian cultural development.|$|E
5|$|Djajakusuma often {{included}} traditional arts in his films, {{and two of}} them (Lahirnja Gatotkatja and Bimo Kroda) {{were based}} on traditional wayang stories and used wayang-inspired costumes and tempos. This focus on aspects of <b>traditional</b> <b>culture</b> fell out of the mainstream after 1965, having been replaced by films about city life. Djajakusuma's theatrical productions experimented with new storytelling techniques, adapting the traditional styles for the modern world. As a lecturer teaching screenwriting and the history of theatre, Djajakusuma focused on Indonesian arts. He argued that Indonesians should rely on local culture, not continuously look towards the West. In other areas he was mostly apolitical.|$|E

5|$|Plunging {{itself through}} an active process of Westernization during the Meiji Restoration in 1868, Japan adopted Western political, {{judicial}} and military institutions and Western cultural influences integrated with its <b>traditional</b> <b>culture</b> for modern industrialization. The Cabinet organized the Privy Council, introduced the Meiji Constitution, and assembled the Imperial Diet. The Meiji Restoration transformed the Empire of Japan into an industrialized world power that pursued military conflict {{to expand its}} sphere of influence. After victories in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895) and the Russo-Japanese War (1904–1905), Japan gained control of Taiwan, Korea and the southern half of Sakhalin. Japan's population grew from 35 million in 1873 to 70 million in 1935.|$|E

Before marriage, young women would be secluded and unable to interact with any men except for the ones chosen to be their husbands.

At Gambir, he also meets with his old friend Hartono, a political activist with the political party Partindo, who enquires about Tini. On a later date, Hartono visits Tono's home and meets Tini. It is revealed that Tini was romantically involved with Hartono while {{the two of them}} were in university, where Tini surrendered her virginity to him; this action, unacceptable in <b>traditional</b> <b>culture,</b> made her disgusted with herself and unable to love. Hartono had made the situation worse by breaking off their relationship through a letter. When Hartono asks her to take him back, Tini refuses.|$|E
5|$|By {{succeeding}} her husband, Ranavalona {{became the}} first female sovereign of the Kingdom of Imerina {{since its founding in}} 1540. Her rise to power occurred in a cultural milieu that favored men over women in the political sphere. In the <b>traditional</b> <b>culture</b> of Imerina, rulers were specially endowed with the power to innovate in circumvention of established norms and customs. Sovereigns often mobilized innovation through the creation of new forms of kinship, the traditional basis of the political order. Women, however, were associated with the household, a rigid kinship unit in opposition to the innovating role and power of the sovereign, and so were not viewed as suited to rule. Although female rulers had once been common among the Vazimba, described in oral histories as the original inhabitants of Madagascar, this tradition ended in the central highlands with the reign of Andriamanelo (1540–1575), founder of the Kingdom of Imerina and successor to his Vazimba mother, Queen Rafohy (1530–1540).|$|E
5|$|Contributors to Poedjangga Baroe were {{influenced}} by the Tachtigers, a Dutch literary movement from the 1880s. Sutherland suggests that the romantic theme prevalent in their works was adapted by the authors to escape the changing realities of Indonesian society. As opposed to earlier works published by Balai Pustaka such as Marah Rusli's Sitti Nurbaya (1922), which emphasized regional cultural values, prose published in Poedjangga Baroe focused on national identity, and writers included areas {{that they had never}} visited. Old themes, such as forced marriage, were abandoned. According to Sutherland, most contributors to Poedjangga Baroe kept a sense of ambivalence towards the Dutch colonial government as well as <b>traditional</b> <b>culture</b> as a central theme in their works. Although they rejected Dutch control of the archipelago, these nationalist writers embraced Western culture; Sutherland writes that some of the most staunchly nationalist writers were also the most westernized.|$|E

5|$|Taoism was the {{official}} {{religion of the}} Tang. Buddhism, originating in India {{around the time of}} Confucius, continued its influence during the Tang period and was accepted by some members of imperial family, becoming thoroughly sinicized and a permanent part of Chinese <b>traditional</b> <b>culture.</b> In an age before Neo-Confucianism and figures such as Zhu Xi (1130–1200), Buddhism had begun to flourish in China during the Northern and Southern dynasties, and became the dominant ideology during the prosperous Tang. Buddhist monasteries played an integral role in Chinese society, offering lodging for travelers in remote areas, schools for children throughout the country, and a place for urban literati to stage social events and gatherings such as going-away parties. Buddhist monasteries were also engaged in the economy, since their land property and serfs gave them enough revenues to set up mills, oil presses, and other enterprises. Although the monasteries retained 'serfs', these monastery dependents could actually own property and employ others to help them in their work, including their own slaves.|$|E
5|$|The {{cultural}} heritage of Slavonia represents {{a blend of}} social influences through its history, especially {{since the end of}} the 17th century, and the <b>traditional</b> <b>culture.</b> A particular impact was made by Baroque art and architecture of the 18th century, when the cities of Slavonia started developing after the Ottoman wars ended and stability was restored to the area. The period saw great prominence of the nobility, who were awarded estates in Slavonia by the imperial court in return for their service during the wars. They included Prince Eugene of Savoy, the House of Esterházy, the House of Odescalchi, Philipp Karl von Eltz-Kempenich, the House of Prandau-Normann, the House of Pejačević and the House of Janković. That in turn encouraged an influx of contemporary European culture to the region. Subsequent development of the cities and society saw the influence of Neoclassicism, Historicism and especially of Art Nouveau.|$|E
5|$|Ranavalona's {{succession}} initially {{resulted in}} a relaxation of state control over Christianity. A printing press, which was imported by LMS missionaries {{at the end of}} Radama's reign, was only effectively put into operation in 1828. The press was in heaviest use during the first several years of Ranavalona's reign, when thousands of hymnals and other materials were transcribed and printed. Translation of the New Testament was completed in the second year of her reign, and 3,000 copies were printed and distributed between 1829 and 1830. From the beginning of her reign, Ranavalona forbade the distribution of books within the military to prevent subversion and preserve discipline. She allowed missionaries free rein in operating the printing press, however, and exempted from military service all Malagasy personnel trained to operate the press. In 1835, translation of the Old Testament was completed and the first copies were printed. The freedom allowed to LMS and Malagasy Christians to print religious materials and teach religion in the state schools during the first six years of Ranavalona's reign allowed the religion to become firmly established among a small but growing group of converts in and around the capital. In 1831 Ranavalona authorized Malagasy attendance at church services, administration of the sacrament, and baptism of her subjects. Within a year, the first 100 Malagasy were baptized out of an estimated 200 practicing Christians total; these converts were drawn from all social classes, including slaves, commoners, respected elders, court officials and even sampy guardians, who were considered the bulwarks of <b>traditional</b> <b>culture.</b>|$|E
