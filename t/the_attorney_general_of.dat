In 2001 Kalokola, ostensibly on behalf of the Lihau family, filed a complaint against unknown persons with <b>the</b> <b>attorney</b> <b>general</b> <b>of</b> Kinshasa, claiming that Lihau had been murdered. He based his assertion on a strange visit that Lihau supposedly had with someone the day {{after the death of his}} wife and on unusual signs that were observed on Lihau's body when it was brought to Kinshasa.|$|E

The state of Wisconsin was represented by Bronson La Follette, <b>the</b> <b>Attorney</b> <b>General</b> <b>of</b> Wisconsin. La Follette argued that the plain language of the termination act not only ended federal supervision of the tribe, but extinguished the tribe and with it all treaty rights. He argued that the Court of Claims ruling was incorrect and should be reversed, and that the tribe was due compensation from the federal government. The United States was again represented by Claiborne, who reiterated his earlier argument.|$|E

5|$|Prior {{to being}} {{involved}} in federal politics, he spent ten years in provincial politics. He was elected in the Vancouver-Kensington riding in 1991 {{as a member of}} the British Columbia New Democratic Party (BC NDP) and re-elected there in 1996. He served as <b>the</b> <b>Attorney</b> <b>General</b> <b>of</b> British Columbia from August 1995 to February 2000. When the leader of his party resigned in 1999, Dosanjh put himself forward as a candidate and won the leadership vote. With the win he became Canada's first Indo-Canadian provincial leader.

5|$|After {{a four-month}} investigation, the {{criminal}} justice branch of <b>the</b> <b>Attorney</b> <b>General</b> <b>of</b> British Columbia announced formal charges of assault causing bodily harm against Bertuzzi on June 24, 2004. With the charge, Bertuzzi faced up to one-and-a-half years in prison. Bertuzzi pleaded guilty to the assault charge on December 22 after arranging a plea bargain with prosecutors. He was given a conditional discharge requiring 80 {{hours of community service}} and one year's probation that additionally prohibited him from playing in any hockey game Moore was competing in. Under Canadian law, Bertuzzi's successful completion of his probationary period precluded him from a criminal record. Moore expressed disappointment regarding Bertuzzi's discharge and was upset that he was unable to attend the court date, having to issue a written victim statement instead. Moore's lawyer, Tim Danson, was given one day's notice of the court date following Bertuzzi's plea bargain, which he said was insufficient time for Moore to travel to Vancouver.|$|E
5|$|Evans' {{service as}} Imperial Wizard {{proved to be}} a lucrative position, {{allowing}} him to maintain a large residence in a prestigious Atlanta neighborhood. In the mid-1930s, however, Klan funds dwindled, and he worked for a Georgia-based construction company selling products to the Georgia Highway Board. At the same time, he was a staunch supporter of Georgia governor Eurith D. Rivers, whom he had previously employed as a lecturer. Owing to the political support that he provided the administration, Evans was allowed to sell to the highway board without bidding against other contractors. In 1940, the state of Georgia charged Evans {{and a member of the}} state highway board with price fixing. <b>The</b> <b>Attorney</b> <b>General</b> <b>of</b> Georgia, Ellis Arnall, directed legal proceedings against Evans that resulted in a $15,000 fine.|$|E

5|$|In July 2000 it was {{announced}} that Punch magazine was to be prosecuted for contempt of court after publishing an article by former MI5 agent David Shayler. Shayler's article claimed MI5 could have stopped the Bishopsgate bombing, which a spokesman for Attorney General Lord Williams claimed was a breach of a 1997 court injunction preventing Shayler disclosing information on security or intelligence matters. In November 2000 Punch and its editor were found guilty and fined £20,000 and £5,000 respectively. In March 2001 the editor successfully appealed against his conviction and fine, with an appeal judge accusing <b>the</b> <b>Attorney</b> <b>General</b> <b>of</b> acting like a press censor and ruling that the 1997 injunction was in breach of the European Convention on Human Rights. In December 2002 this decision was overturned at the House of Lords, with five law lords ruling that editor James Steen's publication of Shayler's article was indeed in contempt.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1970s {{a period of}} {{financial}} and leadership disputes occurred within the church hierarchy, with church treasurer, Stanley Rader, {{at the center of}} many of the disputes. The gravest incident was the church bwing placed in financial receivership by <b>the</b> <b>Attorney</b> <b>General</b> <b>of</b> California, George Deukmejian, an action that was later disallowed in court. Tkach took {{an active role in the}} defense of Armstrong, Rader, and the church headquarters' operations. He rallied the WCG membership to take action against the court proceedings. Armstrong recognized his effectiveness and subsequently ordained him to the rank of evangelist on September 27, 1979. See Evangelists of the Worldwide Church of God. In March 1981 Armstrong appointed him to the WCG's advisory council of elders, and eventually, Armstrong named him Director of Church Administration, one of the most prominent administrative positions other than Armstrong himself.|$|E
5|$|It was {{reported}} that Rosaviakosmos had taken out an insurance policy worth 200 million US dollars to cover damage caused by falling debris. The risk of debris from the station reaching land {{was estimated to be}} 3%. Countries located near the target zone monitored events surrounding the deorbit to determine whether precautions should be taken. In New Zealand the Satellite Reentry Committee was responsible for this, whilst Emergency Management Australia handled preparations in Australia. The head of the Japanese Defense Agency, Toshitsugu Saito, postponed a trip to the United States in case any debris fell on Japan, as the station was scheduled to pass over several Japanese islands on its final orbit. Residents of Okinawa were warned to stay indoors as the station passed overhead. Members of the South Pacific Forum requested assurance from Russia {{that they would not be}} hit by falling debris.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Attorney</b> <b>General</b> <b>of</b> West Virginia is {{the chief}} legal advisor to the West Virginia state {{government}} and is the state's chief law enforcement officer. The office was created by Article VII, Section 1 of the first Constitution of West Virginia in 1863. Under the current state constitution (1872), {{the attorney general is}} an executive department-level state constitutional officer, along with the governor, secretary of state, auditor, treasurer, and commissioner of agriculture. The attorney general is the ex officio reporter of the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia. The constitution further specifies that the attorney general shall reside in the seat of state government, Charleston, during their term of office.

As of 2012, the attorney general receives a salary of $95,000 per year.|$|E
5|$|The {{verdict was}} treated with scepticism by much of the {{international}} media and the U.S. government of President Jimmy Carter. On 2 February 1978, {{based on the evidence}} given at the inquest, <b>the</b> <b>attorney</b> <b>general</b> <b>of</b> the Eastern Cape stated that he would not prosecute the officers. After the inquest, Biko's family brought a civil case against the state; at the advice of their lawyers, they agreed to a settlement of R65,000 (US$78,000) in July 1979. Shortly after the inquest, the South African Medical and Dental Council initiated proceedings against the medical professionals who had been entrusted with Biko's care; eight years later two of the medics were found guilty of improper conduct. The failure of the government-employed doctors to diagnose or treat Biko's injuries has been frequently cited {{as an example of a}} repressive state influencing medical practitioners' decisions, and Biko's death as evidence of the need for doctors to serve the needs of patients before those of the state.|$|E
5|$|There are {{a variety}} of {{advantages}} to charity status. Within English trusts law, a standard express trust has a relationship between the trustees and the beneficiaries; this does not apply to charitable trusts, partially because of the special definition of trustee used and partially because there are no individual beneficiaries identified in a charitable trust. Instead, <b>the</b> <b>Attorney</b> <b>General</b> <b>of</b> England and Wales sues on behalf of beneficiaries to enforce a charitable trust. Because of this lack of a relationship, the trustees' powers are far wider-ranging, only being regulated by the Charity Commission and actions brought by the Attorney General; the beneficiaries have no direct control. Charitable trusts are also exempt from many formalities when being created, including the rule against perpetuities. The trustees are also not required to act unanimously, only with a majority.|$|E
