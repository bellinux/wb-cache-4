Although, many initiatives being implemented to improve <b>technology</b> usage but <b>audit</b> <b>technology</b> usage among the auditors are still low and auditors are not attaining sufficient progress in the use of technology. This implies that <b>technology</b> enabled <b>audit</b> performance may not lead to the expected outcomes in achieving the effective, efficient and quality audit task. Furthermore, it also indicates that the current strategies and policies may not effectively support the technology implementation. In the same vein, the under-utilisation of technologies was reported due to inadequate governance.

With the ever-increasing demands of customers, organisations have been forced to be agile in order to adapt to sudden changes. Now more than ever, technology {{can be used as a}} powerful tool. For organisations to be profitable and grow, they need to have a management team that is competent to manage the organisation in turbulent times.

In March 2013, two research institutes were created by presidential decree to foster the development of alternative energy sources in Uzbekistan, with funding from the Asian Development Bank and other institutions: the SPU Physical−Technical Institute (Physics Sun Institute) and the International Solar Energy Institute. Three universities have been set up since 2011 to foster competence in strategic economic areas: Nazarbayev University in Kazakhstan (first intake in 2011), an international research university, Inha University in Uzbekistan (first intake in 2014), specializing in information and communication technologies, and the International Oil and Gas University in Turkmenistan (founded in 2013). Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan are both generalizing the teaching of foreign languages at school, in order to facilitate international ties. Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan have both adopted the three-tier bachelor’s, master’s and PhD degree system, in 2007 and 2012 respectively, which is gradually replacing the Soviet system of Candidates and Doctors of Science.
