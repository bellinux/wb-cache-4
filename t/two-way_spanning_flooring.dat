40|$|Sandwich {{composites}} {{are widely}} used in various industries such as aeronautical, mechanical, automotive, marine and others. However, most of the existing sandwiches are not suitable and cost effective for applications in civil infrastructure. An innovative fibre composite sandwich panel made of glass fibre rein-forced polymer skins and a modified phenolic core material was developed for building and other structural applications. The behaviour of this new generation sandwich panel was studied to assist the technical persons and the construction crews in better understanding its properties for an efficient use in flooring applications under different loading conditions. If a fibre composite sandwich panel is placed not in the main fibre direction, an adverse effect on its performance may occur. This paper discusses an experimental investigation on this innovative sandwich for its one and <b>two-way</b> <b>spanning</b> <b>floor</b> applications under uniformly distributed loading. The experimental result showed that the stiffness of the sandwich {{is affected by the}} fibre orientation of the sandwich skins. Also, no major effect was observed for variation of fixity between slab and joist...|$|R

40|$|Here, the {{acceleration}} response spectrum {{of a long}} <b>span</b> <b>floor</b> under human walking loads was studied. Three hundreds and twenty experimental measurements of walking load curves were applied to a long <b>span</b> <b>floor</b> to obtain a 10 -second root-mean-square acceleration response spectrum in the vertical vibration direction, based on it a simplified calculation expression was suggested for the root-mean-square acceleration response of the floor within the frequency range of 3 - 20 Hz. The effects of several parameters including higher order vibration modes, boundary condition, <b>floor</b> <b>span,</b> stride length and damping ratio on the spectrum were studied and the corresponding modifying measures were suggested. The detailed implementation procedure of the suggested response spectrum was presented. The feasibility and applicability of the suggested spectrum were validated by comparing the prediction results with field measurements of an existing long <b>span</b> <b>floor.</b> Department of Civil and Environmental Engineerin...|$|R

50|$|Arching or {{compressive}} membrane action (CMA) in {{reinforced concrete}} slabs occurs {{as a result}} of the great difference between the tensile and compressive strength of concrete. Cracking of the concrete causes a migration of the neutral axis which is accompanied by in-plane expansion of the slab at its boundaries. If this natural tendency to expand is restrained, the development of arching action enhances the strength of the slab. The term arching action is normally used to describe the arching phenomenon in one-way spanning slabs and compressive membrane action is normally used to describe the arching phenomenon in <b>two-way</b> <b>spanning</b> slabs.|$|R

50|$|Completed in 1932, the two-lane Ben Williamson Bridge connects Coal Grove, Ohio to Ashland, Kentucky, {{crossing}} the Ohio River. Named for Senator Ben M.

In 1989, the bridge was closed and renovated during which time traffic in both directions was diverted to the Willis Bridge.

40|$|Cross Laminated Timber (CLT) {{construction}} {{is now considered}} a viable and sustainable alternative to traditional building techniques within the multi-storey building sector. This is primarily due to {{the high level of}} prefabrication possible with CLT construction, its high strength-to-weight ratio and its potential as a carbon negative building material. As a result, an increasing number of developers and architects are requesting a CLT design option for multi-storey buildings using CLT wall and floor panels. The latter, especially long <b>span</b> <b>floors,</b> provides a challenge for engineers. Long <b>span</b> CLT <b>floors</b> have a lower natural frequency and are light in weight, which can cause noticeable vibrations. This paper examines existing analytical design procedures available to calculate floor vibrations and provides a preliminary design for <b>floors</b> <b>spanning</b> 9 m. Innovations in CLT panels are introduced, including increased connection rigidity and the use of hardwood timber species, resulting in increased panel stiffness and reduced floor vibrations. Whilst CLT has been extensively researched and tested in Europe and Canada, only limited research has occurred within Australia and New Zealand. This paper also discusses Australian and New Zealand standards and codes and the use of locally grown soft and hardwood timber species for CLT panels...|$|R

40|$|This book chapter {{identifies}} {{some important}} ideas and inventions that were bypassed by mainstream engineering {{in the mid-nineteenth}} century, only to be developed independently as fruitful ideas and structural solutions almost a Century later. William Bridges Adams is identified as a key visionary who succeeded in breaking away from ideas of linear structural framing, based upon mimicking previous structural forms in timber and stone, seeing the potential of <b>two-way</b> <b>spanning</b> structures in iron that heralded modern day space-frames. In his conceptual breakthroughs, Adams was able to understand many of the structural advantages offered by such structures. He was clear about distributed load-paths and saw the potential of repetition of small-scale components for struts and node elements. Sadly, his ideas coincided with {{at a time when}} simpler and more conventional linear framing systems such as triangulated trusses had recently become calculable through mathematical formulas and graphic analysis...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{the application of}} non-linear structural analysis methods to address archaeological questions concerning {{the reconstruction of the}} ancient city of Pompeii after a major earthquake that occurred 17 yr prior to the famous eruption of Mt. Vesuvius in 79 AD. It presents preliminary findings in an effort to develop an approach to modelling the two-way out-of-plane behaviour of unreinforced masonry walls, including comparison studies with published analytic and experimental results for one-way loaded walls, plus a trial analysis for a <b>two-way</b> <b>span</b> condition. The approach requires the application of computationally intensive non-linear analysis techniques, since the linear analysis methods used in conventional design and education are inadequate to model the behaviour of unreinforced masonry. Developing an understanding of the two-way behaviour of unreinforced masonry has implications not only for archaeological investigation of ancient structures, but also for modern renovation of historic structures. ...|$|R

40|$|A new GFRP {{sandwich}} {{floor panel}} {{has been developed}} {{in the last few}} years to replace the traditional timber panel. This panel has acceptable structural mechanical properties to be used in civil engineering applications. The present work focuses on the free vibration behaviour of the one-way, two-way, and continuous GFRP sandwich floor panels. Few different variables were considered in this study; span of the panel, single spanning, continuous spanning, panel restrain types at supports, and skin fibre orientations. The restraints types considered are free, screws, and glue. A 3 D numerical finite element model was developed to find the mode shape of different panels. It was found that the natural frequency of this panel is non-linear with respect to span variations. The orientation 0 °/ 90 ° gives higher frequency than ± 45 ° in the case of one-way spanning panel, and the orientation ± 45 ° gives higher frequency than 0 °/ 90 ° in the case of <b>two-way</b> <b>spanning</b> panel. ...|$|R
