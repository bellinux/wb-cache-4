The concept is like what service providers offer their own customers and having television, voice, and Internet service bundled into one package. Any competitor may rent office space in an incumbent's central office, place equipment to interconnect with their network, or purchase other related services. The company can offer the same deal to a competing company requesting use of their network and facilities. The new entrant has a right to purchase access to the incumbent on an unbundled basis. Getting unbundled services means the new entrant has the opportunity to invest in its own network and therefore spend less on buying everything wholesale. They are able to make a profit using their own equipment and do not have to spend it all on the incumbent hardware and software provided.|$|E

40|$|The main {{characteristic}} of 4 th Generation (4 G) Networks is being {{based on all}} IP architecture, operating mainly on IPv 6. <b>This</b> <b>includes</b> <b>services</b> such as voice, video, and messaging. LTE {{is considered to be}} a 3 rd Generation (3 G) network and one of 4 th Generation (4 G) roadmap mobile access technologies. LTE-Advanced (LTE-A), on the other hand, is a 4 G technology concept with evolving features. Therefore LTE is the key feature in the understanding of LTE-A evolution. The main focus of LTE is the enhancement of the packet-switched (PS) mechanisms on top of the UMTS enhancements, based on All IP Network (AIPN). IPv 6 networking provides maximum service delivery flexibility, user decoupling, and scalability improvements, while leveraging the existing IETF standards. This requires major focus on network simplification, end-to-end delay reductions, optimal traffic routing, seamless mobility, and IP-based transport provisioning. This chapter aims to present a survey and highlight specific IPv 6 -based features presented mostly in the 3 GPP standard literature, and to provide a high-level discussion on the LTE-IPv 6 requirements...|$|E

Clients provided data for 14 discrete videoconferencing sessions. Clinicians provided 51 instances of evaluation data for the 14 sessions. Three aspects of the videoconferencing process were evaluated: (1) quality of the work carried out; (2) satisfaction with the process and outcomes as evaluated by clients; and (3) by rehabilitation clinicians. Results indicate that all clients were very highly satisfied with the services they received, and that this was true for all sessions, including their very first experience. In general, both host and remote clinicians were also pleased with the videoconferencing. Nevertheless, there were mino...|$|E
