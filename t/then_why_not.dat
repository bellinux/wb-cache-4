500|$|Audiences {{and critics}} were {{unfavorable}} of the storyline, outraged that Delia was killed off. Jeevan Brar of MSN TV asked the rhetorical question: [...] "If Y was {{so intent on}} killing off a child and an Abbott, <b>then</b> <b>why</b> <b>not</b> Johnny Abbott?", pointing out {{that it would have}} been a more [...] "symbolic" [...] storyline for different reasons. Shortly after her death, Delia's corneas were given to Connor Newman, the newborn son of Chloe's best friend Chelsea Lawson (Melissa Claire Egan) and her ex-husband Adam Newman (Michael Muhney), who was in desperate need of a cornea transplant. Coincidentally, Adam happens to be the driver of the car that killed Delia.|$|E
500|$|Negative reviews {{revolved}} around the theme's classic Bond sound. LAUNCHcast's James Poletti called the song a [...] "perfectly competent Bond theme", but [...] "the formula seems a little too easy. Perhaps {{they would have done}} better to rise to the challenge of doing something a little different, something a little more knowingly tongue-in-cheek." [...] Melody Maker stated, [...] "You know what this sounds like before you hear it. If the people in charge want Garbage, <b>then</b> <b>why</b> <b>not</b> let them do what Garbage do?" [...] In its review of Absolute Garbage, Pitchfork called the song a [...] "predictable 'Goldfinger' permutation signaling the band's limitless affinity for big-budget theatrics." ...|$|E
2500|$|There {{used to be}} {{only one}} RS model in {{production}} at a time, but recently Audi has revised its policies and decided to make more than one RS model at a time, claiming that [...] "customers want them, <b>then</b> <b>why</b> <b>not</b> give it to them". However, RS models are not available in all markets; for instance the North American market only has the RS7 available and not the RS6 Avant.|$|E

2500|$|Eventually von Braun and {{the others}} were won over. As von Braun stated: [...] "It sounded reckless, but George Mueller's {{reasoning}} was impeccable. Water ballast in lieu of a second and third stage would require much less tank volume than liquid-hydrogen-fuelled stages, so that a rocket tested with only a live first stage would be much shorter than the final configuration. Its aerodynamic shape and its body dynamics would thus not be representative. Filling the ballast tanks with liquid hydrogen? Fine, but <b>then</b> <b>why</b> <b>not</b> burn it as a bonus experiment? And so the arguments went on until George in the end prevailed." ...|$|E
2500|$|At the time, {{the idea}} that newly {{isolated}} human genes of unknown function could prove useful for drug development was widely criticized. Haseltine's experience with HIV taught him that knowledge of the genome without prior knowledge of function was useful and had led {{to the discovery of}} new and useful drug targets and new and effective drugs. Haseltine argued that if one new human gene were discovered, the techniques of modern biology would allow its natural function and potential medical use identified. If that were true for one gene, <b>then</b> <b>why</b> <b>not</b> all the human genes? New tools had been developed that allowed what had been tedious hard work of gene isolation and characterization to be replaced by highly automated instruments and the data regarding the structure, tissue and cell location and the results of functional tests to be stored and easily accessed using advanced computer technologies. He summarized these views [...] with the statement [...] "Genomics is not necessarily Genetics". It was not until the Human Genome Science approach was validated by its own work and [...] the work of its partners that it was ultimately adopted by the scientific community. Today, the approach pioneered by Human Genome Sciences is one of the principal tools used today for the discovery and characterization of novel human genes and as well as the genes of other species.|$|E

6000|$|Your fifth {{argument}} is, 'If Christ {{himself was}} made manifest {{to be the}} SENT of God by baptism, as appears (Mark 1:9,10), <b>then</b> <b>why</b> may <b>not</b> baptism, as the first fruits of faith, and {{the first step of}} gospel-obedience, as to instituted worship, be a manifesting discovering ordinance upon others who thus follow Christ's steps.' ...|$|R

6000|$|Your {{eleventh}} argument is, 'If unbaptized persons must {{be received}} into churches, only because they are believers, though they deny baptism; <b>then</b> <b>why</b> may <b>not</b> others plead for the like privilege, that are negligent in any other gospel ordinance of worship, from the same ground of want of light, let it be what it will.
