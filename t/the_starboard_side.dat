5|$|All battleships are top {{heavy and}} tend to settle upside down when they sink. Arkansas settled upside down, but a 1989 diver's sketch of the wreck shows hardly any of <b>the</b> <b>starboard</b> <b>side</b> of the hull, making it look like the ship is lying on her side. Most of <b>the</b> <b>starboard</b> <b>side</b> is present, but {{severely}} compacted.|$|E
5|$|Prince of Wales fired unopposed {{until she}} began a port turn at 05:57, when Prinz Eugen took her under fire. After Hood {{exploded}} at 06:01, the Germans opened intense and accurate fire on Prince of Wales, with 15-inch, 8-inch and 5.9-inch guns. A heavy hit was sustained below the waterline as Prince of Wales manoeuvred through {{the wreckage of}} Hood. At 06:02, a 15-inch shell struck <b>the</b> <b>starboard</b> <b>side</b> of the compass platform and killed {{the majority of the}} personnel there. The navigating officer was wounded, but Captain Leach was unhurt. Casualties were caused by the fragments from the shell's ballistic cap and the material it dislodged in its diagonal path through the compass platform. A 15-inch diving shell penetrated the ship's side below the armour belt amidships, failed to explode and came to rest in the wing compartments on <b>the</b> <b>starboard</b> <b>side</b> of the after boiler rooms. The shell was discovered and defused when the ship was docked at Rosyth.|$|E
5|$|She {{was given}} a more {{extensive}} refit from January to May 1939 that removed her 5.5-inch guns and palisades, mounted AA guns on her flying-off deck, plated in the doors at the forward end of the upper hangar, {{and gave her a}} small island on <b>the</b> <b>starboard</b> <b>side.</b> Furious resumed her training duties after the completion of the refit and continued them until October 1939.|$|E

50|$|When the Titanic {{began to}} founder, Lee {{was ordered to}} man {{lifeboat}} No. 13, which was launched from <b>the</b> ship's <b>starboard</b> <b>side</b> at 1:30 a.m. As a result, Lee survived the sinking, as did Fleet.|$|R
5000|$|This mount was the {{standard}} installation on battleships, cruisers, early destroyer leader classes (these mounts on the DL's were single-purpose/anti-surface ship only), and later destroyers. It {{was also used}} on <b>the</b> island (<b>starboard)</b> <b>side</b> of <b>the</b> s.|$|R
5|$|The {{secondary}} armament for Montana and {{her sisters}} was to be 20 /54 cal guns housed in 10 turrets along the island of the battleship; five on <b>the</b> <b>starboard</b> <b>side</b> and five on the port. These guns, designed specifically for the Montanas, were to be the replacement for the /38 cal secondary gun batteries then in widespread use with the US Navy.|$|E
5|$|Edward Fletcher as Sixth Officer James Moody: The ship's only junior {{officer to}} {{have died in the}} sinking. The film depicts Moody admitting Jack and Fabrizio onto the ship only moments before it departs from Southampton. Moody is later shown {{following}} Mr. Murdoch's orders to put the ship to full speed ahead, and informs First Officer Murdoch about the iceberg. He is last seen clinging to one of the davits on <b>the</b> <b>starboard</b> <b>side</b> after having unsuccessfully attempted to launch collapsible A.|$|E
5|$|In June 1956 {{some more}} {{wreckage}} from G-ALYP was accidentally trawled up {{from an area}} about 15 miles south of where the original wreckage had been found. This wreckage was from <b>the</b> <b>starboard</b> <b>side</b> of the cabin just above the three front windows. Subsequent examination at Farnborough suggested that the primary failure was probably near to this area {{rather than at the}} rear automatic direction finding window {{on the roof of the}} cabin as had been previously thought. These findings were kept secret until the details were published in 2015.|$|E

5|$|In the event, Titanics heading changed {{just in time}} {{to avoid}} a head-on collision, but the change in {{direction}} caused the ship to strike the iceberg with a glancing blow. An underwater spur of ice scraped along <b>the</b> <b>starboard</b> <b>side</b> of the ship for about seven seconds; chunks of ice dislodged from upper parts of the berg fell onto her forward decks. A few minutes later, all of Titanics engines were stopped, leaving the ship facing north and drifting in the Labrador Current.|$|E
5|$|Melbournes {{service is}} commemorated with a stained-glass {{window at the}} Garden Island Naval Chapel. One of the ship's anchors is {{incorporated}} into a memorial to naval aviation at Nowra, New South Wales. Another anchor and <b>the</b> <b>starboard</b> <b>side</b> ship's bell are {{on display at the}} RAN Heritage Centre at Garden Island. Memorabilia from Melbournes voyages with the Fleet Air Arm embarked, and examples of all the types of aircraft deployed on Melbourne, are on permanent static display in the Fleet Air Arm Museum at HMAS Albatross.|$|E
5|$|The {{fuselage}} of {{the aircraft}} is built around the cannon. The GAU-8/A is mounted slightly to the port side; the barrel in the firing location is on <b>the</b> <b>starboard</b> <b>side</b> at the 9 o'clock position so it is aligned with the aircraft's centerline. The gun's 5-foot, 11.5-inch (1.816 m) ammunition drum can hold up to 1,350 rounds of 30mm ammunition, but generally holds 1,174 rounds. To protect the GAU-8/A rounds from enemy fire, armor plates of differing thicknesses between the aircraft skin and the drum are designed to detonate incoming shells.|$|E
5000|$|South Dakota, like Enterprise, had {{suffered}} major damage. She {{had taken a}} bomb hit {{on one of her}} 16 in gun turrets, had been torn by shrapnel, and had collided with the destroyer USS [...] during the battle. The destroyer had not only holed <b>the</b> battleship's <b>starboard</b> <b>side,</b> but had left an anchor in the wardroom. Even though Vestal repair parties were busy with Enterprises urgent repairs, they also went to work on the damaged South Dakota, listing her over to patch the hole on <b>the</b> battleship's <b>starboard</b> <b>side</b> at <b>the</b> waterline. Her craftsmen repaired the wardroom (removing Mahans anchor in the process), patched shrapnel holes, and put sprung hatches and damaged fire mains in order. She was back in action in a scant five days.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT:In this study, a local ice {{pressure}} prediction {{has been}} conducted by using measured data from two ice breaking tests that was conducted for a relatively big ice floe at Amundsen Sea in the Antarctica from January 31 to March 30 2012. The symmetry of load was considered by attaching strain gauges on the same sites inside the shell plating of ship at the port and <b>the</b> <b>starboard</b> <b>sides</b> in <b>the</b> bow thrust room. Using measured strain data, after the ice pressure was converted by the influence coefficient method and the direct method, the two values {{were found to be}} similar...|$|R
5|$|The torpedo {{struck the}} after portion of <b>the</b> <b>starboard</b> <b>side</b> of the Houston, blowing 20 men {{overboard}} and spreading gasoline {{fires in the}} waters around the cruiser. Initially unsure whether the ship would hold together, the captain ordered the evacuation of 300 crew members while the ship's condition was ascertained. In {{the end it was}} determined she would stay afloat. Towing continued as before, slowly moving the task group towards the Navy base at Ulithi.|$|E
5|$|In 1977, British Airways and Singapore Airlines {{shared a}} Concorde for flights between London and Singapore International Airport at Paya Lebar via Bahrain. The aircraft, BA's Concorde G-BOAD, was painted in Singapore Airlines livery {{on the port}} side and British Airways livery on <b>the</b> <b>starboard</b> <b>side.</b> The service was {{discontinued}} after three return flights because of noise complaints from the Malaysian government; it could only be reinstated on a new route bypassing Malaysian airspace in 1979. A dispute with India prevented Concorde from reaching supersonic speeds in Indian airspace, so the route was eventually declared not viable and discontinued in 1980.|$|E
5|$|Losing {{power and}} speed, Roma {{began to fall}} out of the battle group. Around 16:02, another Fritz X slammed into <b>the</b> <b>starboard</b> <b>side</b> of Romas deck, between frames 123 and 136. It most likely detonated in the forward engine room, {{sparking}} flames, and causing heavy flooding in the magazines of main battery turret number two and the fore port side secondary battery turret, and putting even more pressure upon the previously stressed hull girder. Seconds after the initial blast, the number two 15-inch turret was blown over the side by a massive explosion, this time from the detonation of that turret's magazines.|$|E

5|$|The {{ship was}} given a more {{extensive}} refit from January to May 1939 that removed her 5.5-inch guns and palisades, mounted anti-aircraft guns on her lower flying-off deck, plated in the doors at the forward end of the upper hangar, {{and gave her a}} small island on <b>the</b> <b>starboard</b> <b>side.</b> Furious resumed her training duties after the completion of the refit and continued them until October 1939. As a deck-landing training carrier in 1939 Furious embarked 767 Squadron, flying Shark, Swordfish and Fairey Albacore torpedo bombers and reconnaissance aircraft, and 769 Squadron, flying Blackburn Skua, Blackburn Roc, and Gloster Sea Gladiator fighters.|$|E
5|$|When the Corregidor {{entered the}} minefield, {{there was a}} large {{explosion}} on <b>the</b> <b>starboard</b> <b>side</b> of the vessel. The overcrowded ship quickly began to sink, with many people trapped below-deck. Survivors stated that the ship sank so quickly that {{there was no time for}} large-scale panic to set in. Searchlights from Corregidor Island illuminated the scene which aided the rescue effort. Sailors of MTB Squadron 3 posted at Sisiman Cove heard the explosion and left on three PT boats (PT-32, PT-34 and PT-35) to investigate. When the boats arrived they found survivors in the water and were able to retrieve 282 survivors. Seven of the rescued passengers later died from their injuries.|$|E
5|$|Around noon, as {{a result}} of poor {{coordination}} and signaling, the Swedish line unexpectedly turned toward the allied fleet. When the flagship Kronan came about in the maneuver it suddenly heeled over and began to take in water. According to master gunner Anders Gyllenspak, the sails were not reefed and the ship leaned over so hard that water flooded in through the lower gunports. As the ship was leaning over, a gust of wind pushed the ship on her side, bringing her masts and sails down in line with the surface of the sea. Shortly afterwards, the gunpowder store exploded and ripped the forward section of <b>the</b> <b>starboard</b> <b>side</b> apart. Kronan quickly lost buoyancy and sank, taking most of her 850-man crew with her.|$|E
50|$|About {{one-half}} {{hour before}} sunrise {{on the morning}} of 10 January, a Japanese plane - a single-engined fighter - pushed over in a dive and dropped a bomb which exploded off <b>the</b> destroyers <b>starboard</b> <b>side,</b> close aboard. Fragments, scything through the air, wounded 15 sailors topside and punctured the ship with a few small holes.|$|R

5|$|Assigned to the American Patrol Detachment, Schurz {{departed}} Charleston {{toward the}} end of April and, for the next two months, conducted patrols and performed escort duty and towing missions along the east coast and in the Caribbean. On 19 June, she departed New York for Key West. At 04:44 on the 21st, southwest of Cape Lookout lightship, she was rammed by the merchant ship Florida. The ship hit Schurz on <b>the</b> <b>starboard</b> <b>side,</b> crumpling that wing of the bridge, penetrating the well and berth deck about 12 feet, and cutting through bunker no. 3 to the forward fire room. One of Schurzs crewmen was killed instantly; twelve others were injured. Schurz was abandoned and sank three hours later. The ship was struck from the Navy list on 26 August 1918.|$|E
5|$|At 22:00, while {{avoiding}} three drifting fireships, the overladen 120-gun flagship Oc√©an ran aground and was badly scorched by a fireship which struck the stern. To prevent explosion the stopcocks were {{opened and the}} magazine flooded. As the crew wrestled with this threat, the drifting Tonnerre and Patriote loomed out of the darkness. Patriote turned away in time, but Tonnerre crashed into <b>the</b> <b>starboard</b> <b>side</b> of the flagship and caused considerable damage, although fortunately detached soon afterwards. Oc√©ans crew then held the blazing ship alongside long enough that the drifters could escape before releasing the fireship to drift on shore. During this effort at least 50 men tumbled to their deaths in the fiery chasm between the ships {{as they tried to}} prevent the fire spreading on board.|$|E
5|$|Gromoboi {{suffered}} 87 {{dead and}} 170 wounded; {{far more than}} Rossias 44 dead and 156 wounded. This was attributable to Rossias captain's policy of ordering the gun crews for his quick-firing guns on the engaged side to lie down and those on the unengaged side to go below, {{in contrast to the}} Gromoboi keeping her light guns manned at all times. Gromoboi was hit fifteen times on <b>the</b> <b>starboard</b> <b>side</b> of her hull and seven times on her port side, plus other hits in her funnels, boats and decks. She also suffered a fire caused by the ignition of excess propellant charges. Despite this number of hits, she was not badly damaged because her waterline belt was not penetrated. She was repaired within two months by the rudimentary facilities available at Vladivostok.|$|E
