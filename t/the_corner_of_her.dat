25|$|On March 26, 2007, Patrick and Robin {{argue over}} her {{decision}} to not move back into their apartment with him. She then goes over to Wyndemere to see Nikolas and asks if she can stay with him. Nikolas is not home at the time, and as she searches through his desk to find a paper to leave a note, she is stopped by Mr. Craig (Sebastian Roche), the head gunman from the Metro Court hostage crisis, and finds out he is blackmailing Nikolas for a new identity. When Nikolas returns home, he finds Robin tending to Craig's wound and finds out that Craig had decided Robin might be useful in his blackmail plot. Craig instructs Robin to go about her normal life and not {{to draw attention to}} herself. Also, she cannot not tell anybody—especially Patrick—and he makes numerous threats against Patrick to keep her in line. Robin goes about his instructions and gets into a fight with Patrick. On March 29, 2007, Patrick goes over to Wyndemere and demands that Nikolas tell him what is going on. Nikolas hesitates and Robin walks in. She can see Craig out of <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> eye, holding a gun. She fears for Patrick's safety, so she lies to him and tells him they are over. Later, Craig decides that a good cover story for Robin living at Wyndemere will be to have Robin and Nikolas play out a very public love affair. They agreed, fearing for their loved ones' lives. At the end of the day, Alexis (Nancy Lee Grahn) walks into Wyndemere, stopping dead in her tracks when she sees Robin and Nikolas in a very delicate position on the couch. The two brush it off as though it is nothing, but Alexis is clearly suspicious. Robin and Patrick are reunited following an almost deadly confrontation with Mr Craig. Once Nik is in the clear for good, Robin and Patrick go home together.|$|E
2500|$|At {{some point}} before 1855, Celia began a romantic {{relationship}} with George, one of Newsom’s other slaves. In 1855, Celia was pregnant {{for a third time}} with a child that was likely fathered by either George or Newsom. At some point, George gave Celia an ultimatum, telling her “he would have nothing more to do with her if she did not quit the old man." [...] After this, Celia attempted to plead with Newsom’s family members and with Newsom himself. Sometime on or around June 23, 1855, Celia begged Newsom to leave her alone because she was sick and pregnant. Newsom refused, and told her “he was coming down to her cabin that night.” Celia threatened Newsom, telling him that she would hurt him if he tried to rape her again. After her conversation with Newsom, Celia went and found a large stick, which she placed in <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> cabin.|$|E
2500|$|Bathsheba at Her Bath is a reinterpretation of two antique reliefs {{familiar}} to Rembrandt through engravings. A print by Tobias Stimmer {{may have been}} influential, as it includes the pillar, a curtain drawn across the background and Bathsheba's downcast gaze. It was begun around 1647 and altered and repainted until its completion in 1654. Originally the canvas may have been larger and of a vertical format. It might have been trimmed some ten centimeters at the left and at least 20 centimeters in height; It is speculated that Rembrandt cut the canvas himself in order to intensify {{the impact of the}} figure. [...] show that at some point late in the painting process, he lowered Bathsheba's head from its initial more upward angle, thereby increasing the sense of the figure's withdrawal into reverie. Initially she appeared to be looking out of <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> eye, as if watching David; in the present version her gaze is softened, {{in the general direction of}} her maid but focused on no particular object, imparting a feeling of solemnity and contemplation. There was no letter in her hand in the original conception, and it is also possible that her lap, thighs, and right arm were once draped.|$|E
60|$|Once {{more the}} subtlest of smiles flickered at <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> lips.|$|R
60|$|Her eyebrows were gently raised, <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> mouth quivered, {{her eyes}} fell.|$|R

2500|$|Although {{both girls}} were repulsed by their father's antics, Mae—having once endured Fred's {{throwing}} {{a vacuum cleaner}} at her when she remonstrated against his fondling her—would develop a mechanism whereby she would succinctly tolerate Fred's sexually fondling her before jokingly brushing aside any efforts he made to take the molestation further, whereas in her autobiography, Mae recollected that Heather, [...] "was affected quite badly by all of this. [...] more than me." [...] A strong suspicion remains that, by 1985 or 1986, Heather {{had been forced to}} engage in intercourse with her father, as by the mid-1980s, she is known to have developed classic symptoms of the distress felt by victims of child abuse: these included habits of her biting her nails until they bled; drinking alcohol; of warily watching her father through <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> eye wherever she was sitting or standing; expressing nervous fragility whenever in the presence of males; her sleep being repeatedly broken by nightmares; and her repeatedly bouncing back and forth as she sat on any chair. This distressful behaviour led to both Fred and Rose suspecting Heather held lesbianic inclinations, and also resulted in the girl becoming the increasing recipient of taunts from her father (who had never particularly held a liking toward Heather) that she was [...] "ugly" [...] and a [...] "bitch". On the occasions Heather remonstrated about the abuse to her mother, Rose would simply laugh at her distress.|$|E
60|$|And, blowing {{her eyes}} on <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> shawl, Maud shot away like a comic.|$|E
60|$|She shrugged her shoulders, whilst a {{slightly}} contemptuous curl appeared at <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> mouth.|$|E
60|$|She {{looked at}} him with a little twitch at <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> lips.|$|R
60|$|Eleanor {{said nothing}} further on the subject, but <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> mouth rearranged themselves.|$|R

60|$|Mrs. Riddel {{gave her}} head a toss, and {{regarded}} him from <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> eyes.|$|E
60|$|JENNY [appearing at {{the shelter}} door with a plaster on <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> mouth] Yes, Major.|$|E
60|$|She {{gave him}} a quick look, and a smile quivered at <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> mouth.|$|R
60|$|She sighed as {{she took}} it, and a wistful smile {{invested}} <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> mouth.|$|R
60|$|Celia's rare tears had {{got into}} <b>her</b> eyes, and <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> mouth were agitated.|$|R
60|$|Aunt Philippa {{looked at}} me out of <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> eye and disdained any {{skirmish}} of flippant epigram.|$|E
60|$|After some search Mrs. Holl {{produced}} from <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> capacious pocket the seal, carefully {{wrapped up in}} paper.|$|E
60|$|When {{the train}} {{pulled out of}} the station into the clearer light, she turned her face from him toward the forward window, and <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> mouth, which her half-averted profile gave him, had a kind of piteous droop which smote him to keener regret. Once it lifted in an upward curve, and a gay light came into <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> eye; then the mouth drooped again, and the light went out.|$|E
60|$|Virginia did not deign {{a direct}} reply to this, save by <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> mouth.|$|R
60|$|She became indiscreet. She {{looked at}} him with a little smile at <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> lips.|$|R
60|$|She {{looked at}} him out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> black eyes. This Adrian knew too much.|$|R
60|$|But Miss Pinnegar, {{a regular}} old, grey, {{dangerous}} she-puss, eyed him from <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> pale eye, {{as he turned}} tail.|$|E
6000|$|... "Were those women--Mrs. Thomas and Mrs. Hammond--good to you?" [...] asked Marilla, {{looking at}} Anne out of <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> eye.|$|E
60|$|She {{watched him}} as {{he walked down the}} garden, and then sighed deeply, wiping away a tear from <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> eyes.|$|E
60|$|Eva {{took it and}} smiled, {{though there}} was still a nervous twiching about <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> mouth.|$|R
60|$|Mary cast down <b>her</b> eyes, and <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> mouth twitched {{as if with}} {{a slight}} smile.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. McCaskey arose heavily, {{and went}} toward the dish closet, with <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> mouth drawn down.|$|R
60|$|Ralph gave it, {{with his}} thirsty eyes fixed, expectant, on {{something}} round <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> head, and the smile, which never moved, on his cheeks.|$|E
6000|$|... "You shall talk to him," [...] Sara remarked, with {{a little}} smile at <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> lips. [...] "I am sure {{that he will be}} interested." ...|$|E
60|$|She {{wiped her}} arms, which still bore traces of soap-suds, and then, {{with a gesture}} natural and unashamed, lifted <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> apron to her eyes.|$|E
60|$|Her eyes drew his. He almost fancied {{that the}} quiver at <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> lips was <b>of</b> mirth.|$|R
60|$|She halted {{and half}} turned, and I thought I saw a slight droop at <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> mouth.|$|R
60|$|She {{was silent}} for a moment, her eyes fixed upon vacancy, a faint smile at <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> lips.|$|R
