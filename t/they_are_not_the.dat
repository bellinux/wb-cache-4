5|$|A {{cluster is}} a group of loosely coupled {{computers}} that work together closely, so that in some respects they can be regarded as a single computer. Clusters are composed of multiple standalone machines connected by a network. While machines in a cluster {{do not have to be}} symmetric, load balancing is more difficult if <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>not.</b> <b>The</b> most common type of cluster is the Beowulf cluster, which is a cluster implemented on multiple identical commercial off-the-shelf computers connected with a TCP/IP Ethernet local area network. Beowulf technology was originally developed by Thomas Sterling and Donald Becker. The vast majority of the TOP500 supercomputers are clusters.|$|E
5|$|The ACLU {{continues}} to defend individuals who feel abused or improperly {{treated by the}} government. Often the American Civil Liberties Union is the group {{to stand up for}} an individual when being discriminated against because of their religion, sex, gender, sexuality, race, or class, even when <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> popular opinion. The Reproductive Freedom Project, however, goes deeper than the ACLU. The Project promotes sexual and reproductive health by providing lessons about contraception, knowing about one's reproductive rights and assisting with the financial burdens of abortions and all of the logistics that may go into that.|$|E
50|$|Even {{though the}} Wrights were early owners of Saybrook Township, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> first settlers. The first settler in Saybrook Township was George Webster, a New Yorker {{who came in}} 1810.|$|R
50|$|Exile Parade's debut studio album, Hit the Zoo, was {{released}} on 3 February 2012. In 2014, the band parted ways, citing their belief that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> right kind of band for the current market.|$|R
25|$|Nebraska {{also has}} had five undefeated seasons in which <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> {{national}} champions: 1902, 1903, 1913, 1914, and 1915. Between 1912 and 1916, a 34-game unbeaten streak was recorded by head coach Ewald O. Stiehm.|$|R
5|$|The book {{argues that}} artists have been scapegoated by those advocating censorship, {{as a method}} of {{deflecting}} debate away from the suppression of human rights. The author asserts that censorship of works deemed obscene {{has been used as a}} tactic throughout history to suppress women's rights. Heins argues that even if the perceived negative impacts of pornography,hip hop music, and violent films were factually accurate (and she asserts <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>not),</b> <b>the</b> ends would not justify the means of degrading the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. She emphasizes that education should be used to help guard against potentially dangerous notions, instead of censorship and suppression of dissent.|$|E
5|$|The {{right to}} object to false {{attribution}} is {{the oldest of the}} statutory moral rights, originating (albeit in a limited form) in the Fine Arts Copyright Act 1862. Found in Section 84 of the 1988 Act, the {{right to object}} to false attribution allows individuals to avoid being named on works <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> author of, and applies to literary, dramatic, musical or artistic works, as well as films. It only applies to acts of false attribution perpetrated after 1 August 1989, and lasts for 20 years after the death of the person falsely attributed with authorship. It is infringed whenever an individual issues copies of a work to the public, exhibits them in public or broadcasts them with a false attribution.|$|E
5|$|Curtis Brumfield (Windell Middlebrooks) and Ethan Gross (Geoffrey Arend) {{begin to}} believe that Noah is being held by fresh water, so the search is narrowed. Bud is also cleared of {{voluntary}} manslaughter, and him, Curtis, Megan and Kate Murphy (Jeri Ryan) suspect that the kidnapping may be an inside job, meaning that someone close to Noah kidnapped him. Bud checks his parents, Tom (Stephen Barker Turner) and Jennifer (Keira Naughton) but <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> culprits. They then find that Helen's friend, Jason's girlfriend, Rena Talbot (Wrenn Schmidt) looked after Noah whilst Helen was on {{taking care of her}} boyfriend Oscar Mendez who had been injured badly in a fight. They find Rena, and result in finding Noah, who is sick but alive, and is reunited with his parents. Whilst Rena is arrested, Derek asks Megan to have a ride on her motorbike, to which she rejects and instead goes to see Joan, having a conversation about her father.|$|E
50|$|In 1857, three {{orange trees}} were planted in Old San Bernardino. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> Washington Navel Orange {{that would later}} achieve great fame; they came in 1873 from Brazil to Riverside, California, then a part of San Bernardino County.|$|R
5|$|On October10, another {{tropical}} depression formed {{further to the}} north of the previous storm. It possibly developed from the same tropical wave that spawned the previous depression, although <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> same system. The depression maintained a general northward movement throughout its duration, dissipating on October12.|$|R
25|$|In all the turmoil, many early pioneers {{are nearly}} forgotten. In 1891, John William Lambert built a three-wheeler in Ohio City, Ohio, which was {{destroyed}} in a fire the same year, while Henry Nadig constructed a four-wheeler in Allentown, Pennsylvania. It <b>is</b> likely <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> only ones.|$|R
25|$|Sometimes {{stops and}} {{diaphragms}} are called apertures, even when <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> aperture stop of the system.|$|E
25|$|Ornithischia, as {{the name}} indicates, was coined for the birdlike pelvic girdle, {{although}} <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> ancestors of birds.|$|E
25|$|The {{couplings}} {{between the}} position variables {{have been transformed}} away; if the Q and Î  were Hermitian (which <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>not),</b> <b>the</b> transformed Hamiltonian would describe N uncoupled harmonic oscillators.|$|E
25|$|The CFIA later {{clarified}} {{that these}} specific items had <b>been</b> seized because <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> versions that <b>are</b> formulated {{for sale in}} Canada and which met all Canadian food regulations. Canadian versions of Marmite and the other products would still be permitted to be sold in Canada.|$|R
25|$|England won by 3 wickets and Ian Chappell and Dennis Amiss {{were made}} {{the two men}} of the match for their {{entertaining}} innings, even though <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> top scorers. Oddly, the result was almost {{a mirror image of}} the first One Day International, when England had made 190 and Australia 191/5.|$|R
25|$|The Ferraris of Alain Prost and Jean Alesi were {{expected}} to be the strongest team, but their V-12s and 7-speed semi-automatic gearboxes <b>were</b> <b>not</b> well suited to the tight turns and short straights of the street circuit. As it turned out, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> only ones plagued by gearbox problems throughout the race.|$|R
25|$|In December 2006, writs {{were served}} in the London High Court by Tina Treadwell, {{daughter}} of George and Faye, against Mark Lundquist and Philip Luderman Drifters UK Ltd, alleging <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> rightful controllers of the Drifters.|$|E
25|$|Humans are the {{dominant}} {{species of the}} surface world. They are identical to real humans, except <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> first or only intelligent race to arise in the world. Humanity's survival has been placed at risk many times, just as other dominant species have been eliminated in the past.|$|E
25|$|No {{fewer than}} 20 Chick tracts have Catholicism {{as their subject}} or as a major theme, {{including}} Are Roman Catholics Christians? (arguing that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>not),</b> <b>The</b> Death Cookie (a polemic against the Catholic Eucharist), and Why is Mary Crying? (arguing that Mary {{does not support the}} veneration Catholicism gives her).|$|E
25|$|Coupled {{with all}} this, {{materials}} such as celluloid have been recognised as highly flammable since early days of its usage, and acts such as the Celluloid and Cinematograph Films Act 1922 and the Cinematograph Act 1952 gave the fire brigade powers to take samples of film and test them for flammability even though <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> enforcing authority.|$|R
25|$|At one time, she {{was thought}} to be , who was presumed to have run away from her adoptive parent's house in Hamilton, Michigan on March 11, 1989, but DNA {{profiling}} via her mother Cathy, demonstrated that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> same person. Missing persons such as Aundria, Tina D'Ambrosio, and Karen Wells have been ruled out.|$|R

25|$|Long series {{drill bits}} are unusually long twist drill bits. However, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> best tool for {{routinely}} drilling deep holes, as they require frequent withdrawal {{to clear the}} flutes of swarf and to prevent breakage of the bit. Instead, gun drill bits are preferred for deep hole drilling.|$|E
25|$|The {{motion of}} such balls {{is far from}} being very rapidâ they have even been {{observed}} occasionally to pause in their course, but <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> less destructive for all that. A ball of lightning which entered the church of Stralsund, on exploding, projected a number of balls which exploded in their turn like shells.|$|E
25|$|Some {{people with}} schizoid {{personality}} features may occasionally experience instances of brief reactive psychosis when under stress. The personality disorders that most frequently co-occur with SPD are schizotypal, paranoid and avoidant PD. The relationship between alexithymia (the inability {{to identify and}} describe emotions) and SPD seems to be strong but <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> same condition.|$|E
50|$|Default {{passwords}} (or other default credentials) {{can function}} as backdoors if <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> changed by <b>the</b> user. Some debugging features can also act as backdoors if <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> removed in <b>the</b> release version.|$|R

25|$|The Abydos {{boats were}} {{discovered}} in October 2000. Initially, {{they appeared to be}} a white, âghostlyâ fleet of 14 boat images in the desert sand. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> oldest boat remains to be discovered in Egypt as is sometimes proclaimed, but they have proved to be important to the history of Egyptian boat design and nautical architecture.|$|E
25|$|The gonads (ovaries and testicles) {{are very}} {{sensitive}} to radiation. They may be unable to produce gametes following direct exposure to most normal treatment doses of radiation. Treatment planning for all body sites is designed to minimize, if not completely exclude dose to the gonads if <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> primary area of treatment. Infertility can be efficiently avoided by sparing at least one gonad from radiation.|$|E
25|$|According to the Census definition, White Americans are the {{majority}} racial group {{in almost all}} of the United States. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> majority in Hawaii, many American Indian reservations, parts of the South known as the Black Belt, the District of Columbia, all US territories, and in many urban areas throughout the country. Non-Hispanic whites are also not {{the majority}} in several southwestern states.|$|E
