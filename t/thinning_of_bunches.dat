40|$|Devido à importância social e econômica do Cabernet Sauvignon no processo da expansão da área cultivada na região da Serra Catarinense, hoje com mais de 150 {{hectares}} implantados, e à pouca disponibilidade da informação com relação à evolução do maturação e da caracterização da uva realizou-se este trabalho. O experimento foi realizado na Vinícola Villa Francioni, na safra de 2005 com 800 plantas marcadas previamente de um vinhedo de cabernet - sauvignon formado em 2001 sobre um porta enxerto Paulsen 1103. O vinhedo foi conduzido no sistema no tipo trellis de Y e o espaçamento entre as plantas estavam de 1. 2 m e entre fileiras de 3. 0 m. O acompanhamento da maturação foi feito com cinco coletas realizadas nas datas de 28 / 02 / 05, de 07 / 03 / 05, de 14 / 03 / 05, de 21 / 03 / 05 e de 28 / 03 / 05. O experimento consiste no raleio de cachos ao nível de 6, 9, 12, 15 cachos por planta e mais a testemunha sem raleio com os grupos ± 18 cachos por planta, dando uma produção aproximadamente de 2360, 3530, 4700, 5880, e 7060 kg ha- 1 respectivamente. Para SST, os tratamentos 6, 9, 12, e 15 cachos /planta tiveram uns valores maiores o tratamento testemunha, e para Fenóis totais e Acidez total não teve a diferença entre os tratamentos. Para o pH do mosto, os valores observados acima de 3. 7 para todos os tratamentos, o que não é desejável, indicou a possibilidade para antecipar a colheita em uma semana. Para o peso das bagas, o tratamento com 15 cachos/planta teve uma correlação linear crescente; nos outros tratamentos uma diminuição do peso das bagas é observada a partir da data da 4 °coleta, indicada pela equação polinomial do grau 2 °. Um comportamento similar foi observado para os índices da antocianina, onde apenas o tratamento com 9 grupos propiciou um aumento nos índices da antocianinas que a partir da 4 ° coleta. Os resultados indicam que o raleio de cachos não apresentou diferença significativa no teor de antocianina, solúveis totais, acidez total e taninos nos cachos remanescentesDue to {{the social}} economical importance of the Cabernet Sauvignon in the processo f expansion of the cultivated área in the mountain region of Santa Catarina, today with more than 150 implanted hectares, and the little availability of information {{in relation to the}} maturation evolution and the characterization of the grape, the presente work took place in the headquarters of the Villa Francioni Vineyards, in the crop of 2005 with 800 pnats previously marked of a vineyard of Cabernet Sauvignon formed in 2001 grafted on Paulsen 1103. The vineyard was conducted in the system in Y type trellis and the spacing between the plants was of 1, 5 m and between rows of 3, 0 m. the accompaniment of maturation was made with five samplings in the dates of 28 / 02 / 05, 07 / 03 / 05, 14 / 03 / 05, 21 / 03 / 05 and 28 / 03 / 05. The treatments were the <b>thinning</b> <b>of</b> <b>bunches</b> at the level of 6, 9, 12, 15 bunches by plant and more the witness without thinning with +- 18 bunches, giving a forecast production of 2360, 3530, 4700, 5880, and 7060 kgha¯¹ respectively. For TSS, the 6, 9, 12, and 15 bunches had greater vakues than the treatment without thinning, and for total phenols and acidity it didn t have difference among the treatments. For the pH of the juice, starting from the 4 ° collection date, it was observed values above 3, 7 for all the treatments, what is not desirable, indicating the possibility to anticipate the crop in one week. For berries weight, the treatment with 15 bunches had a growing lineal correlation; in the other treatments a decrease of the berries weight is observed starting from the 4 ° collection date, indicated by the polynomial equation of 2 ° degree. A similar beavior was observed for the anthocyanin contentes, where just the anthocyanin contentes, where just the treatment with 9 bunches propitiated na increase in the anthocyanin contentes starting from the 4 ° date. The results indicate that thecluster thinning did not presente significant difference in the anthocyanin text, soluble totals, total acidity and tanning barks in the remaining cluster...|$|E

Four thinning treatments included control, no <b>thinning</b> <b>of</b> strands (T 1), 1 / 3 shortening of the total strands from the tips (T 2), 1 / 3 removal of the central strands (T 3), 1 / 3 shortening plus 1 / 3 removal of central strands (T 4). All the thinning treatments improved the fruit quality with respect to fresh fruit weight, fruit flesh weight, reducing sugar and non-reducing sugar contents as compared to the control treatment. Among the various thinning treatments, T 4 (combination of 1 / 3 shortening and 1 / 3 removal of central strands) produced the best fruit weight, flesh percentage, reducing and non-reducing sugars contents of date fruit. Whereas the total date palm yield and bunch weight were significantly reduced by the same treatment (combination of the shortening and central removal of strands). However, the date fruit quality was identical for T 2 and T 3 (i. e., 1 / 3 removal of central strands and 1 / 3 shortening of total strands) treatments. There was no significant difference of date palm yield and bunch weight obtained in control treatment than that of strands removing and shortening treatments.

40|$|In this thesis, I {{explain the}} concept <b>of</b> <b>bunching</b> around kink {{points in the}} tax schedule, and {{investigate}} whether such bunching may be occurring at the kink point created by the Norwegian wealth tax. I conclude that {{there seems to be}} no evidence <b>of</b> such <b>bunching,</b> after examining the distribution of taxpayers around the kink point in several ways. Theoretically, bunching at kink points should occur when there is an increase in the marginal tax rate, as the change in marginal payoff will lead to an uneven distribution of taxpayers around the kink point. This could also be further affected by different assets being treated differently for tax purposes. I present such a model, explaining the various mechanisms that affect the amount <b>of</b> <b>bunching,</b> and explain how it can occur. There have been other studies <b>of</b> <b>bunching,</b> with some that found evidence <b>of</b> <b>bunching</b> and some that did not. Very few such studies have examined wealth taxation, with the exception of a recent Swedish study (Seim 2012) that found evidence <b>of</b> <b>bunching</b> around a kink point created by the Swedish wealth tax. No such studies have been previously done for Norway, however. Examining tax data for the year 2012, I observe that the distribution of taxpayers appears to have no trace <b>of</b> <b>bunching,</b> with various methods for observing potential bunching leading to the same conclusion. Furthermore, a look at the composition of wealth gave no indication that taxpayers responded to the wealth tax at all around the kink. It is particularly difficult to point to any strong reason for the different findings, given the similarity between Norway and Sweden in most aspects related to taxation. There are some methodological differences however, that are worth taking into account...|$|R
