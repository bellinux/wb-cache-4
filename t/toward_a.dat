5|$|For {{a decade}} after World War II, Piłsudski was either ignored or {{condemned}} by Poland's communist government, along with the entire interwar Second Polish Republic.

5|$|Albert {{was seriously}} ill with stomach cramps in August 1859.

One of the horses was killed in the collision, and Albert was badly shaken, though his only physical injuries were cuts and bruises. He told his brother and eldest daughter that he sensed his time had come.|$|E
5|$|As far as Westmoreland was concerned, however, all {{he needed}} to know was that the NVA had massed large numbers of troops for a set-piece battle.

The opportunity to engage and destroy a formerly elusive enemy that was moving <b>toward</b> <b>a</b> fixed position promised a victory of unprecedented proportions.|$|E

5|$|At its height, Nagar {{encompassed}} most of {{the southwestern}} half of the Khabur Basin, and was a diplomatic and political equal of the Eblaite and Mariote states. The kingdom included at least 17 subordinate cities, such as Hazna, and most importantly Nabada, which was a city-state annexed by Nagar, {{and served as a}} provincial capital. Nagar was involved in the wide diplomatic network of Ebla, and the relations between the two kingdoms involved both confrontations and alliances. A text from Ebla mention a victory of Ebla's king (perhaps Irkab-Damu) over Nagar. However, a few years later, a treaty was concluded, and the relations progressed <b>toward</b> <b>a</b> dynastic marriage between princess Tagrish-Damu of Ebla, and prince Ultum-Huhu, Nagar's monarch's son.|$|E

5|$|Claiming that {{corporations}} and government {{are planning to}} track every move of consumers and citizens with RFID as the latest step <b>toward</b> <b>a</b> 1984-like surveillance state, consumer privacy advocates, such as Katherine Albrecht and Liz McIntyre, have become Christian conspiracy theorists who believe spychips must be resisted because they argue that modern database and communications technologies, coupled with point of sale data-capture equipment and sophisticated ID and authentication systems, now {{make it possible to}} require a biometrically associated number or mark to make purchases. They fear that the ability to implement such a system closely resembles the Number of the Beast prophesied in the Book of Revelation.|$|E

5|$|Continuing south-southwest, {{the river}} {{along with the}} parkway and trailway enter Hastings-on-Hudson, its {{greenbelt}} the only major break in the village's dense suburban development. It slowly veers <b>toward</b> <b>a</b> more southerly heading, and enters the Nepera Park neighborhood of Yonkers after one mile (1.6km), just south of Farragut Parkway. Once in the neighborhood, the Saw Mill River flows through a Yonkers sewage treatment plant, the other impoundment of the river. After leaving the plant, 1.5 miles (2km) {{to the south of}} where the river entered Yonkers, the parkway and trailway diverge from the river after , to climb over the watershed divide to Tibbetts Brook.

5|$|During {{the early}} 20th century, {{improvements}} in regional transport infrastructure precipitated {{the decline of}} Salford's existing industries, including those at the Salford Docks. Increased foreign competition began to undermine the competitiveness of local textile processing businesses. Rising unemployment during the Great Depression of the 1920s and '30s, and a significant economic decline in the decades following the Second World War contributed <b>toward</b> <b>a</b> fall in Salford's population. By 1939 local coal mining had almost stopped, and cotton spinning had by 1971 ceased completely. Between 1921 and 1939, the population of Salford decreased by 29%, from 234,045 to 166,386, far greater than the rate of decline within the whole of North West England.|$|E

On 4 August, convinced that the government in Montevideo was unwilling to work <b>toward</b> <b>a</b> settlement, a frustrated Saraiva delivered an ultimatum, which the Uruguayans rebuffed.
