50|$|With the {{improvement}} in the defensive capabilities of armor in the High and Late Middle Ages, the cross-section of the sword blade adapted to suit the needs of warriors.

Accordingly, the heating cycle is much longer with a lower mean temperature, compared to those of macro machining. In addition, the proposed deformation field leads to loss of constraints ahead of the <b>cutting</b> grits, <b>and</b> possibly reducing the thrust to cutting force ratio.

40|$|Approximate {{solutions}} from classical plasticity have in {{the past}} been used to describe the process of orthogonal machining. Recently, numerical methods using more complex constitutive models have provided more accurate data on the state of deformation near the tool tip and the generated new surface in a conventional machining process. In this study we have used a viscoplastic material model and an efficient finite element approach to examine the process of orthogonal ultraprecision machining. In contrast to previous numerical studies the cutting thickness to tool tip radius ratio is finite, which requires the use of highly refined finite clement meshes to produce accurate solutions. Results are presented showing the effects of tool edge geometry, material constants, the coefficient of friction, and depth of cut.

40|$|Abstract. This paper reports {{experimental}} {{data on the}} wear of high-speed steel bimetal bandsaw blades cutting austenitic 17 - 7 stainless steel bars. Several different methods of assessing the wear modes and mechanisms are evaluated; Cutting <b>and</b> <b>thrust</b> force components, Set width, Kerf width, “Out-of-square ” <b>cutting,</b> Wear modes <b>and</b> mechanisms and Chip characteristics. The wear mode established in the current work when bandsawing austenitic stainless steel with a bimetal blade is flank and corner wear together with formation of a cutting edge radius. The cutting edge radius increases as the wear progresses, reaching 25 - 50 mm after 300 cut sections. The established wear mechanism for {{the initial stages of}} wear is mild adhesive wear of the flank surface together with built-up edge formation and break-down. As the wear reaches steady-state the mechanism is adhesive wear of the flank surface with tempering/softening of high-speed steel layers. When the wear reached the steady-state region the level of <b>thrust</b> <b>and</b> <b>cutting</b> force were equal and relatively high. The kerf width appears to be less than the total set width of the blade, meaning that there is compression of the set teeth as they pass through the kerf. There is segmented chip formation with an increasing amount of vibration as the teeth wear, probably due to the increasing size of cutting edge radius.

5000|$|The word [...] "rapier" [...] is a German word to {{describe}} what {{was considered to be}} a foreign weapon. The word rapier was not used by Italian, Spanish, and French masters during the apogee of this weapon, the terms spada, espada, and épée (or espée) being instead the norm (generic words for [...] "sword"). Because of this, as well as the great variation of late-16th and 17th century swords, some like Tom Leoni simply describe the rapier as a straight-bladed, two-edged, single-handed sword of that period which is sufficient in terms of both offense and defence, not requiring a companion weapon. To avoid the confusion of lumping all swords together, some categorize such swords by their function and use. For example, John Clements categorizes thrusting swords with poor cutting abilities as rapiers, and swords with both good <b>thrusting</b> <b>and</b> <b>cutting</b> abilities as cut <b>and</b> <b>thrust</b> swords. Some, however, look at the rapier in its entire time-line and see that it never truly fits into any single definition. Across Europe, the weapon changed based on culture and the fighting style that was prescribed; be it Italian, Spanish, or some other instruction on the weapon's use, so that lengths, widths, hilt designs and even the lack or placement of an edge or edges differed at the same time. One might wear a rapier with a swept hilt and edges on the same day as another might wear one with a cup hilt and an edgeless blade.|$|R

40|$|Despite {{the wide}} range of {{applications}} of reamers in manufacturing industries, the theoretical work in this area is very limited. An initial survey of the reaming process indicated that there was very limited work carried out in reaming. Therefore 2 avenues were investigated to improve the understanding of the reaming process [...] an experimental program to understand the reaming process and a theoretical analysis of the reaming process. Experimental work carried out has revealed that there are three components of force and torque which are developed in a reaming operation. <b>Thrust</b> force <b>and</b> <b>cutting</b> torque which both are constant during a reaming operation are generated as the result of material removal by the chamfer of the reamer. The chamfer section of the reamer removes material from an initially drilled hole to bring the hole to more accurate size. A rubbing component of torque is also developed as the result of contact between the helical part of the reamer and the hole. This rubbing torque {{has been found to be}} a function of the distance that the reamer has travelled into the workpiece. Rubbing action by the helical part of the reamer is performed to create a better surface finish. Two theoretical models are developed in order to predict the <b>thrust</b> force, <b>cutting</b> torque <b>and</b> the rubbing torque in reaming. The model developed for the <b>cutting</b> torque <b>and</b> <b>thrust</b> uses the variable flow stress theory of machining. In this work the reamer cutting edges are subdivided into individual <b>cutting</b> edge <b>and</b> analysed as a single point tool with a cutting geometry. The model predicts the values of <b>thrust</b> <b>and</b> <b>cutting</b> torque for each <b>cutting</b> edge <b>and</b> the total value is obtained by multiplying the values by the number of cutting edges. This model takes into consideration parameters such as the tool geometry, <b>cutting</b> conditions <b>and</b> the work material variable flow stress properties. The rubbing model is based on the latest theories of wave formation in friction and is able to predict the values of rubbing torque in reaming. Existence of the wave has been verified using SEM analysis. The rubbing model takes into account parameters such as, tool geometry, wave size, lubrication condition and the coefficient of friction between the helical part of the reamer and the hole.

Experiments were carried out at the National Institute of Standards and Technology, in {{collaboration}} with The Boeing Company, to obtain force and temperature data {{as a function of}} feed, speed, and fiber orientation angle (FOA), for validation of finite element simulations of composite machining. The outer diameter portions of disks of unidirectional. carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) laminates were cut orthogonally. Tabs were machined into the outer diameter (OD) to cause cutting to begin at a FOA of 0 degrees and end at a FOA of 90 degrees. Cutting forces were measured using a dynamometer and the chip morphology was recorded using a high speed camera. It was observed that the variation of cutting force with FOA depended on the feed. For large feed, the cutting force increases with FOA until an angle of 90 degrees, whereas for low feed the cutting force decreases beyond 65 degrees. The chip morphology also changes with FOA and feed. Significant tool flank wear is noted even in these short duration experiments, which causes the <b>thrust</b> <b>and</b> <b>cutting</b> forces to increase significantly for FOA from 0 degrees to 60 degrees. For 65 degrees- 80 degrees FOA, force signals change cyclically. A small spike in the cutting force seems to be correlated with fibers being pulled out in clumps, and is followed by lower forces in subsequent revolutions while the pitted surface is machined.

5000|$|War scythes were {{a popular}} {{weapon of choice}} and {{opportunity}} of many peasant uprisings throughout history. The ancient Greek historian Xenophon describes in his work (Anabasis) the chariots of Artaxerxes II, which had projecting scythes fitted. Later, Jan Žižka's Hussite warriors, recruited mostly from peasantry, used modified scythes. Called originally 'kůsa -scythe' and later “sudlice,” it doubled as both a stabbing <b>and</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>weapon,</b> developing later into the “ušatá sudlice”—Bohemian earspoon, more suitable for combat—thanks to side spikes (ears), acting as end stops, it did not penetrate too deep, and so was easier to draw from fallen foes. War scythes were widely used by Polish and Lithuanian peasants during revolts in the 18th and 19th centuries. Polish peasants used war scythes during the 17th-century Swedish invasion (The Deluge). In the 1685 battle of Sedgemoor, James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth, fielded a 5000 strong peasant unit armed with war scythes. They {{were used in the}} 1784 Transylvanian peasants' Revolt of Horea, Cloşca and Crişan, in the war in the Vendée by royalist peasant troops, in the 1st War of Schleswig in 1848 in Denmark, and again in various Polish uprisings: the Kościuszko Uprising in 1794 and the battle of Racławice, in which scythe wielders successfully charged and captured Russian artillery. In that year Chrystian Piotr Aigner published a field manual, Short Treatise on Pikes and Scythes, detailing the training and operation of scythe-equipped forces, the first and probably only such book in the history of warfare. War scythes were later used in the November Uprising in 1831, January Uprising in 1863, and Silesian Uprising in 1921. The description of a fighting unit as “scythemen” was used in Poland as late as 1939; however, the Gdynia [...] "kosynierzy" [...] were armed with hunting guns rather than scythes.|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Mechanical EngineeringAs {{the use of}} {{composites}} increases, {{more problems}} arise with processing and manufacturing {{of this type of}} material {{in order to make it}} a more durable and reliable for today’s applications. One of the most important problems in the cutting of composites is the poor quality of the machined surface and unknown status of the machining forces. Knowing the status of forces during the final machining process helps reduce such defects as delamination and fiber-matrix debonding. This research attempted to develop a fully theoretical model for edge trimming of composites for fiber orientations greater than 90 degrees. The energy method was used as the approach, and the machining forces were compared to the experimental results. A series of experiments were conducted to validate the theoretical foundations. Composite coupons with different fiber orientations and tool rake angles were prepared for the machining experiments, <b>and</b> the <b>cutting</b> forces were measured using a four-component dynamometer. In addition, a finite element model (FEM) was built to model the depth of damage along the fibers. The theoretical depth of damage compared to the FEM analysis showed that they were in good agreement. The parameters affecting the machining forces of composites can be divided into three categories: tool geometry, material properties, and machining conditions. The effect of all of these parameters is reflected in the formula. In addition to the <b>thrust</b> <b>and</b> <b>cutting</b> forces, the depth of damage along the fibers can be calculated. It was concluded that the material properties and machining conditions, more than the geometry of an orthogonal cutting tool, are more influential in affecting the processing and manufacturing of composite materials...|$|R
