There, State Highway Route 26A continued, splitting onto a new alignment to stay northwest of the railroad, ending at Van Dyke Avenue.

50|$|In 1898 the Minnesota Constitution was amended so {{the state}} could fund road {{construction}} and other internal improvements. The Minnesota Legislature passed a bill allowing county boards <b>to</b> <b>designate</b> <b>state</b> roads and receive tax funding. The section of road crossing the Cannon River, known as Cannon Bottom Road, was designated State Road 3. With tax revenue available, the county constructed new bridges in 1911 and 1915, and they regraded and graveled the road in 1919. In 1920, a constitutional amendment established a state trunk highway system, and State Road 3 became Trunk Highway 3. A new bridge over the Cannon River was built in 1921. The Minnesota Highway Commissioner found fault with the road's alignment, though, so a completely new alignment was constructed to the west in 1931. This section of road, now part of U.S. Highway 61, shortened the distance by 0.35 mi and is still in use today. The old road reverted to the jurisdiction of Burnside Township, which was subsequently annexed {{by the city of}} Red Wing in 1971.|$|E

40|$|We use {{a single}} trapped-ion qutrit to {{demonstrate}} the violation of an input-state-independent non-contextuality inequality using a sequence of randomly chosen quantum non-demolition projective measurements. We concatenate 54 million sequential measurements of 13 observables, and violate an optimal non-contextual bound by 214 standard deviations. We use the same dataset to characterize imperfections including signaling and repeatability of the measurements. The experimental sequence was generated in real time with a quantum random number generator integrated into our control system to select the subsequent observable with a latency below 50 Î¼s, {{which can be used}} to constrain hidden-variable models that might describe our results. The state-recycling experimental procedure is resilient to noise, self-correcting and independent of the qutrit state, substantiating the fact that quantumness is connected to measurements as opposed <b>to</b> <b>designated</b> <b>states.</b> Comment: 6 + 5 pages; 4 + 7 figure...|$|R
