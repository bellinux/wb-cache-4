5|$|Goffman's book Stigma: Notes on the Management of Spoiled Identity (1963) {{examines}} how, {{to protect}} their identities when they depart from approved standards of behavior or appearance, people manage impressions of themselves – mainly through concealment. Stigma pertains to the shame that a person may feel {{when he or she}} fails to meet other people's standards, and to <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> discredited – which causes the individual not to reveal his or her shortcomings. Thus, a person with a criminal record may simply withhold that information from fear of being judged by whomever that person happens to encounter.|$|E

Ostensibly, it is to help the government and its military research survival skills and battle readiness - in actuality, it is meant to instill terror and distrust in all of Japan's citizens to curb any attempts at rebellion, by showcasing the government's power and ability to target citizen's families and preying on <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> killed by a friend.|$|E
25|$|The dowry {{system in}} India {{is another reason}} that is given for female infanticide. Although India has taken steps to abolish the dowry system, the {{practice}} persists, and for poorer families in rural regions female infanticide and gender selective abortion is attributed to <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> unable to raise a suitable dowry and then being socially ostracised.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> {{identified}} as gay {{can be considered}} as a form of social homophobia. Theorists including Calvin Thomas and Judith Butler have suggested that homophobia can be rooted in an individual's fear of being {{identified as}} gay. Homophobia in men is correlated with insecurity about masculinity. For this reason, homophobia is allegedly rampant in sports, and in the subculture of its supporters that is considered stereotypically male, such as association football and rugby.|$|E
25|$|After the war the Manning {{government}} passed {{several pieces}} of restrictive legislation that limited labor's ability to organize workers and to call strikes. The enforcement of labor law also reflected an anti-union bias. Social Crediters, {{who had a}} penchant for conspiracy theories, believed union militancy {{was the product of}} an international Communist conspiracy. Their labor legislation sought to foil the conspiracy's plans in Alberta and incidentally to reassure potential investors, particularly in the oil industry, of a good climate for profit taking. The path for such legislation was made smoother by the conservatism of one wing of the labor movement in the province and <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> tarnished with the Communist brush by the other wing.|$|E

25|$|Gender roles within social {{hierarchies}} {{are concerned}} with the question of agency in the conduct of physical violence. Men are expected to exert violence, while women are victimized by it. In conflict situations, rape against men dissolves this relationship and puts men in the ‘receiving’ role of the victim. Similarly, the ‘penetrating’ role of men as opposed to the ‘receiving’ role of women in (conventional) sexual intercourse illustrates this constructed power relationship. Hence, male rape victims experience the worst possible ‘humiliation’ with regards to the ingrained social roles they are traditionally expected to fulfill. Moreover, their stigmatization takes on particularly severe dimensions within conservative social environments in which homosexual intercourse – regardless of consent – is punished harshly. For example, Ugandan male rape victims explain their choice to not speak out with <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> branded homosexuals. As homosexuality is widely condemned in Uganda, male victims of sexual violence often struggle to get proper support because they are accused of being gay. In certain cases, gender roles concerning violence and sexual conduct are so deeply ingrained that the mere existence of male rape is denied.|$|E
25|$|If the {{requirements}} were not met they were punished. Punishments by the Muchachos were very severe and brutal. Common punishments including flogging, hanging, and {{being put into}} a cepo. When the workers were put into a cepo they were chained in pain inflicting positions and left without food and water for an extensive amount of time. More extreme punishments included the shooting of workers if they tried to escape or they became too ill to work. The pay for their hard labor was minimal. They were put on what was called a debt-penoage where they had {{to work for a}} long period of time in order to gain funds to pay back debt they owned to the Caucheros for supplies that were given to them for their daily tasks such as tools to work, clothes, and food. It most commonly lead them to work their whole life for the rubber barons due to the fact that very little money was compensated for their labor. They usually received a small item that they were able to keep such as a hammock, the rest was given straight to the employer. Government intervention was minimal to none because of bribery that lead local officials to overlook what was occurring and <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> attacked by the Indians.

50|$|During {{the ongoing}} Syrian civil war, the Druze {{inhabitants}} of Qalb Loze have refrained {{from participating in}} the fighting between opposition rebels and government forces. This is partially due to <b>the</b> <b>fears</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> involved in <b>the</b> civil strife and the insistence of rebel leaders that they remain neutral. Relations between the village's residents and the Sunni Muslim majority {{in the area are}} strong and most oppose the government of Bashar al-Assad. Qalb Loze has provided a safe haven for Druze defectors from the Syrian Army, clinics for wounded rebels, and has provided shelter for local refugees fleeing the violence in their towns and villages.

500|$|As Richard {{struggled}} {{both with}} the need to find a purpose to his post-retirement life and <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> forgotten, he attached his name to numerous endeavours.

He continued to use his name as a promotional vehicle for over 30 years after his retirement. Richard briefly returned to hockey in 1972 as head coach for the Quebec Nordiques of the World Hockey Association. He lasted only two games, a win and a loss, before finding himself unable to handle the strain of coaching. Richard reconciled with the Canadiens in 1981 and resumed his team ambassador role.|$|E

[...] She also spoke about her emotional crisis, saying, [...] "For two or three years I was away from all social interaction.

500|$|The {{first act}} was {{completed}} by March 1890; {{the rest of the}} opera was not composed in chronological order, as had been Verdi's usual practice. The musicologist Roger Parker comments that this piecemeal approach may have been [...] "an indication of the relative independence of individual scenes". Progress was slow, with composition [...] "carried out in short bursts of activity interspersed with long fallow periods" [...] partly caused by the composer's depression. Verdi was weighed down by <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> unable to complete the score, and also by the deaths and impending deaths of close friends, including the conductors Franco Faccio and Emanuele Muzio. There was no pressure on the composer to hurry. As he observed at the time, he was not working on a commission from a particular opera house, as he had in the past, but was composing for his own pleasure: [...] "in writing Falstaff, I haven't thought about either theatres or singers". He reiterated this idea in December 1890, a time when his spirits were very low after Muzio's death that November: [...] "Will I finish it ? Or will I not finish it? Who knows! I am writing without any aim, without a goal, just to pass a few hours of the day". By early 1891 he was declaring that he could not finish the work that year, but in May he expressed some small optimism, which by mid-June, had turned into: ...|$|E

500|$|The {{report was}} {{promoted}} {{as an effort}} [...] "to present the whole truth about crimes committed in Srebrenica region regardless nationality of perpetrators of crimes and {{time when they were}} committed [...]" [...] It asserted that no more than 2,000 Bosniaks (Bosnian Muslims) had died at Srebrenica – all armed soldiers, not civilians – and that 1,600 of them had died in combat or while trying to escape the enclave. It consistently referred to the [...] "alleged massacre", attributed the deaths of about 100 Bosniaks to [...] "exhaustion" [...] and concluded: [...] "the number of Muslim soldiers who were executed by Bosnian Serb forces for personal revenge or for simple ignorance of international law [...] would probably stand less than 100." [...] The report dismissed as [...] "mentally disturbed" [...] a Bosnian Serb soldier who had admitted participating in the killings, and claimed that the survivors' stories were a product of their imaginations: [...] "To walk for almost 20 days in an area that might be full of landmines, without any food and water, under <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> shot from any direction was such a trauma that soldiers sometimes mixed reality with illusions.

500|$|In {{his opening}} speech on 26 September 2001, Garnham said that race {{may have played}} a part in the case, {{due to the fact that}} a black child was murdered by her black carers, and the social worker and police officer most closely {{involved}} in the case were black. He said that <b>the</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> accused of racism may have led to the inaction. In the hearings, Arthurworrey, who is African-Caribbean, admitted that her assumptions about African–Caribbean families influenced her judgement, and that she had assumed Climbié's timidness in the presence of Kouao and Manning stemmed not from fear, but from the African–Caribbean culture of respect towards one's parents. Ratna Dutt, director of the Race Equality Unit (now the Race Equality Foundation), a charity that provides race-awareness training to social workers, later said, [...] "the implicit message is that it's acceptable for ethnic minorities to receive poor services under the guise of superficial cultural sensitivity. This is absolutely shameful, as it allows people to argue that good practice is compromised by anti-racism"; and, contrasting the outcomes of the white and black staff members involved, [...] "for a large number of black frontline staff if the finger of blame is pointed at them they don't end up in jobs in other local authorities. That's how institutional racism operates". Jacqui Smith, Home Secretary from 2007, said: [...] "I have not seen widespread evidence that social workers are not taking action", and, [...] "there are no cultures that condone child abuse.
