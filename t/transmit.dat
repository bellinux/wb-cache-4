5000|$|The exact {{voltages}} for {{a logical}} 0 or 1 {{depend on the}} physical layer used, but the basic principle of CAN requires that each node listens to the data on the CAN network including the <b>transmitting</b> node(s) itself (themselves). If a logical 1 is <b>transmitted</b> by all <b>transmitting</b> nodes at the same time, then a logical 1 is seen {{by all of the}} nodes, including both the <b>transmitting</b> node(s) and receiving node(s). If a logical 0 is <b>transmitted</b> by all <b>transmitting</b> node(s) at the same time, then a logical 0 is seen by all nodes. If a logical 0 is being <b>transmitted</b> by one or more nodes, and a logical 1 is being <b>transmitted</b> by one or more nodes, then a logical 0 is seen by all nodes including the node(s) <b>transmitting</b> the logical 1. When a node <b>transmits</b> a logical 1 but sees a logical 0, it realizes that there is a contention and it quits <b>transmitting.</b> By using this process, any node that <b>transmits</b> a logical 1 when another node <b>transmits</b> a logical 0 [...] "drops out" [...] or loses the arbitration. A node that loses arbitration re-queues its message for later transmission and the CAN frame bit-stream continues without error until only one node is left <b>transmitting.</b> This means that the node that <b>transmits</b> the first 1 loses arbitration. Since the 11 (or 29 for CAN 2.0B) bit identifier is <b>transmitted</b> by all nodes {{at the start of the}} CAN frame, the node with the lowest identifier <b>transmits</b> more zeros at the start of the frame, and that is the node that wins the arbitration or has the highest priority.|$|R
40|$|Questions: Can {{vertically}} <b>transmitted</b> parasites (VTPs) {{serve as}} indirect mutualists by excluding more virulent, horizontally <b>transmitted</b> parasites (HTPs) ? How does {{the efficiency of}} vertical transmission affect: (1) the equilibrium number of hosts infected by each type of parasite; (2) {{the total number of}} hosts in the population; and (3) virulence of the horizontally <b>transmitted</b> parasite? How does reproductive output by the horizontally <b>transmitted</b> parasite affect the frequency of infection by both parasite types? Methods and assumptions: We used a deterministic computer simulation to determine host-population dynamics following introduction of a vertically <b>transmitted</b> parasite. We assumed that the vertically <b>transmitted</b> parasite precludes infection by the horizontally <b>transmitted</b> parasite. We allowed for the possibility that virulence of the horizontally <b>transmitted</b> parasite depends on host density. Conclusions: Vertically <b>transmitted</b> parasites can serve as indirect mutualists by excluding more virulent horizontally <b>transmitted</b> parasites. As such, selection would be expected to favour VTP strains that most efficiently exclude horizontally <b>transmitted</b> parasites. In addition, the total number of hosts at equilibrium increases (and HTP frequency decreases) with the efficiency of vertical transmission. Increasing the reproductive output of the horizontally <b>transmitted</b> parasite has little effect on the frequency of that parasite at equilibrium, but greatly increases the frequency of hosts infected with the vertically <b>transmitted</b> parasite. When virulence of the horizontally <b>transmitted</b> parasite is density dependent, the vertically <b>transmitted</b> parasite indirectly increases virulence by increasing host density at equilibrium...|$|R

5|$|Common {{blackbirds}} {{spend much}} of their time looking for food on the ground where they can become infested with ticks, which are external parasites that most commonly attach to the head of a blackbird. In France, 74% of rural blackbirds were found to be infested with Ixodes ticks, whereas, only 2% of blackbirds living in urban habitats were infested. This is partly because it is more difficult for ticks to find another host on lawns and gardens in urban areas than in uncultivated rural areas, and partly because ticks are likely to be commoner in rural areas, where a variety of tick hosts, such as foxes, deer and boar, are more numerous. Although ixodid ticks can <b>transmit</b> pathogenic viruses and bacteria, and are known to <b>transmit</b> Borrelia bacteria to birds, {{there is no evidence that}} this affects the fitness of blackbirds except when they are exhausted and run down after migration.|$|E
