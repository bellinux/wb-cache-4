5|$|Eurogamer noted <b>the</b> <b>annoyance</b> of {{returning}} to defend over 20 towns each with recurring zombie problems, but said that the game mechanic is never too bothersome and even appreciated its element of time management, {{similar to that of}} the Dead Rising game series. IGN thought that the lack of fast travel was an impediment. Reviewers also noted technical issues with moving Marston's character, especially when climbing ladders and outrunning zombies.|$|E
5|$|Garfield {{thought the}} land grants given to {{expanding}} railroads was an unjust practice. He also opposed some monopolistic practices by corporations, {{as well as}} the power sought by workers' unions. Garfield supported the proposed establishment of the United States civil service as a means of ridding officials of <b>the</b> <b>annoyance</b> of aggressive office seekers. He especially wished to eliminate the common practice whereby government workers, in exchange for their positions, were forced to kick back a percentage of their wages as political contributions.|$|E
5|$|Initially overjoyed at the {{prospect}} of marrying, Marguerite Louise's ebullience faded to dismay when she discovered her half-sister, despite initially favouring the Tuscan match, then changed her mind. In reaction, Marguerite Louise's behaviour became erratic: she shocked the court by going out unaccompanied, a grievous offence in contemporary French society, with her cousin Prince Charles of Lorraine, who soon became her lover. Her marriage by proxy, on 19 April 1661, did nothing to change her attitude, much to <b>the</b> <b>annoyance</b> of Louis XIV's ministers. On the day she was supposed to meet diplomats offering their congratulations on the wedding, she attempted to abscond and go hunting, only to be stopped by the Duchess of Montpensier.|$|E

This approach {{will be used in}} a decision support system to help managers of public spaces to reduce <b>annoyances</b> and improve <b>the</b> life quality of the townsmen.

5|$|Kelsey wanders {{from the}} tour and {{attempts}} to phone Maria, but disturbs an unknown beast, the Bane Mother, to <b>the</b> <b>annoyance</b> of the staff, to which Wormwood orders the alarms switched off and Sarah Jane killed. Maria attempts to phone Kelsey, but sets off the alarms again, causing the Archetype to escape, transferring the focus upon him. Maria, while escaping, encounters him, who just mimics her, and they escape into a women's bathroom. Sarah Jane then enters, and although they are surprised to see each other, they manage to escape the factory, albeit without Kelsey. When they arrive back on Bannerman Road, Sarah warns Maria not to get involved as her life is too dangerous.|$|E
5|$|Nicky is {{persuaded to}} drop out of {{university}} and work for corrupt local politician Austin Donohue (Alun Armstrong), swayed by Donohue's apparent idealism and desire to change Newcastle for the better. This is much to <b>the</b> <b>annoyance</b> of Nicky's trade unionist father Felix (Peter Vaughan), who does not want his son to waste opportunities that he never had when he was Nicky's age. Nicky's relationship with Mary ends when she becomes pregnant by Tosker and later marries him, which means she also drops out of university. On the run from a pregnant girlfriend himself and his abusive alcoholic father, Geordie leaves for London, where he falls in with seedy underworld baron Benny Barrett (Malcolm McDowell).|$|E
5|$|On 4 August Thorpe, {{along with}} Holmes {{and two of}} Holmes's associates, were charged with {{conspiracy}} to murder Scott. Thorpe was additionally charged with incitement to murder, {{on the basis of}} his alleged 1968 discussions with Bessell and Holmes. After being released on bail, Thorpe declared his innocence and his determination to refute the charges. Although he remained North Devon's MP he withdrew almost completely from public view, except for a brief theatrical appearance at the Liberals' 1978 annual assembly on 14 September—to <b>the</b> <b>annoyance</b> of the party's leaders who had asked him to stay away.|$|E

5|$|Over the summer, Stephen {{intensified}} the long-running siege of Wallingford Castle {{in a final}} attempt to take this major Angevin stronghold. The fall of Wallingford appeared imminent and Henry marched south {{in an attempt to}} relieve the siege, arriving with a small army and placing Stephen's besieging forces under siege themselves. Upon news of this, Stephen gathered up a large force and marched from Oxford, and the two sides confronted each other across the River Thames at Wallingford in July. By this point in the war, the barons on both sides seem to have been eager to avoid an open battle. As a result, instead of a battle ensuing, members of the church brokered a truce, to <b>the</b> <b>annoyance</b> of both Stephen and Henry.|$|E

Herman Katzenback is then killed after attempting to fix the main stage when the machinery malfunctions. Penny is appointed both stage manager and director due to Walt Jr. and Katzenback's deaths.

However, she breaks up with Munch after the fish, a Jack Dempsey, ends up eating all her other fish. The now lonely Munch turns to Bolander for comfort, but finds the tables have turned and that Bolander has met a local waitress named Linda (Julianna Margulies). The two get along very well and bond over their mutual love of music. The episode ends with Linda and Bolander getting together to play music: Linda plays the violin, while Bolander plays the cello.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the next}} summer, Stephen massed troops {{to renew the}} siege of Wallingford Castle in a final attempt to take the stronghold. The fall of Wallingford {{appeared}} imminent and Henry marched south to relieve the siege, arriving with a small army and placing Stephen's besieging forces under siege themselves. Upon news of this, Stephen returned with a large army, and the two sides confronted {{each other across the}} River Thames at Wallingford in July. By this point in the war, the barons on both sides were eager to avoid an open battle, so members of the clergy brokered a truce, to <b>the</b> <b>annoyance</b> of both Henry and Stephen. Henry and Stephen took the opportunity to speak together privately about a potential end to the war; conveniently for Henry, Stephen's son Eustace fell ill and died shortly afterwards. This removed the most obvious other claimant to the throne, as while Stephen had another son, William, he was only a second son and appeared unenthusiastic about making a plausible claim on the throne. Fighting continued after Wallingford, but in a rather half-hearted fashion, while the English Church attempted to broker a permanent peace between the two sides.|$|E

SpongeBob then gets nervous and almost reconsiders applying for {{a job at the}} restaurant until his best friend, a starfish named Patrick Star, convinces him otherwise. Humored with SpongeBob's vulnerability, gullibility, and impenetrable enthusiasm and innocence, both Squidward and the restaurant's proprietor, Mr. Eugene Krabs, decide to manipulate SpongeBob, whom they secretly consider unqualified for the position, by sending him on an impossible errand to purchase a seemingly non-existent high-caliber spatula.|$|E
5|$|Clearly, {{some sort}} of {{flexible}} bag was required to contain an explosive gel so {{that it did not}} matter how the bomb landed on the target. However, a flexible bag is hard to throw and trials had not been at all satisfactory. Discussions of the problem in Macrae's office were overheard by Gordon Norwood, a master printer who Macrae had recruited from his former magazine publishing employer, but he was not directly working on the weapon. Norwood suggested that what was needed was a frangible container and to <b>the</b> <b>annoyance</b> of the War Office store keeper he obtained a 150 W light bulb with which to demonstrate his point: a spherical glass flask inside a sock of woven wool is rigid when thrown, but on contact the glass breaks and the bomb deforms to the required shape. Experiments with glass flasks filled with cold porridge confirmed that this was the way to go. The grenade needed a delay for the thrower to get clear, so the woollen sock was covered in a sticky substance ensuring that the bomb stayed in place for a few seconds before detonating. Having covered the bomb in glue, a non-sticky handle was required. In the handle, a delay fuse was ignited by releasing a sprung lever so that a five second time delay starts as the grenade leaves the thrower's hand (just like the levers found on a conventional Mills bomb type hand grenade).|$|E

5|$|In Part 2, Phoebe {{tries to}} contact someone by phone to warn them about Rachel, {{eventually}} getting through to Joey {{at the hotel}} and stirring up homesickness in him. At the rehearsal dinner, Ross introduces his parents, Jack and Judy (Elliott Gould and Christina Pickles) to Emily's, Steven and Andrea (Tom Conti and Jennifer Saunders). Jack and Judy have volunteered to pay for half of the wedding expenses but when they discover extravagant costs Ross spends much of the evening trying to bargain down his future in-laws. Chandler makes a toast that is not well received by the guests and Monica is taken aback when a drunken guest mistakes her for Ross's mother. She and Chandler console each other over alcohol and wake up in bed together the next morning. Rachel eventually boards a plane, after forgetting her passport, and annoys other passengers (including guest star Hugh Laurie) by telling them about her relationship with Ross. At the hall, she sees how happy Ross is with Emily and just wishes him luck. Phoebe phones Joey to hear the wedding, to <b>the</b> <b>annoyance</b> of Ross. As Ross says his vows, he accidentally says Rachel's name rather than Emily's, registrar to ask Emily if he should continue, while the camera shoots from character to character, settling on a shocked Rachel.|$|E
5|$|When the Griffin family {{decide to}} go for a hike in the local woods, Chris and Stewie get lost while chasing after a {{floating}} butterfly. As a result, they go missing for several days, with only limited supplies. As Lois is at her wits' end, she decides to see a psychic medium who assures her of the children's safety and well being. Eventually the boys are found and rescued by Bruce, and returned to their home in Quahog which only furthers Lois's psychic obsession to <b>the</b> <b>annoyance</b> of a skeptical Brian. In defiance of Lois's assertion that extrasensory perception exists, Brian has Peter perform a cold reading on a passerby in the park in order to demonstrate that psychic readings are purely an act, and not real. However, Peter is struck by his success as a medium, convincing himself that he actually has extrasensory perception, and decides to capitalize on it by opening his own psychic readings business and performing in front of a live audience. Soon after, Peter's bluff is finally called when Joe requests his help in a frantic search for a missing person who has been strapped to a bomb. Peter stalls for time during the search (as he just wants to feel the victim's daughter's breasts), eventually resulting in a gruesome death when the bomb explodes, prompting Peter to flatly admit that he actually has no psychic powers whatsoever.|$|E
5|$|Fortunately for Metternich the Tsar's dual {{proposal}} for the St Petersburg meetings, a settlement of the Eastern Question favourable to Russia and limited autonomy for three Greek principalities, was a pairing unpalatable to the other European powers, and potential attendees like British Foreign Secretary George Canning slowly turned away, much to <b>the</b> <b>annoyance</b> of Alexander. Metternich believed for several months afterward that he had gained a unique level of influence over the Tsar. Meanwhile, he renewed the conservative program he had outlined at Karlsbad five years before and sought to further increase Austrian influence over the German Federal Diet. He also informed the press {{they could no longer}} publicise the minutes of Diet meetings, only its rulings. In January 1825 he began to worry about his wife Eleonore's health and he reached her sickbed in Paris shortly before her death on 19 March. Mourning sincerely for her, he also took the opportunity to dine with the Paris elite. Unfortunately, an aside he made about the Tsar there was reported back and did not enhance his reputation. He left Paris for the last time on 21 April and was joined by the Emperor in Milan after arriving on 7 May. He declined the Pope's invitation to become a cardinal of the church. There was also a short trip to Genoa. Early in July the court dispersed and Metternich visited his daughters Leontine (fourteen) and Hermine (nine) in the quiet town of Bad Ischl. Despite the seclusion he received constant reports, including those of ominous developments in the Ottoman Empire, where the Greek revolt was rapidly being crushed by Ibrahim Ali of Egypt. He also had to deal with fallout from St. Petersburg where the Tsar, although unable to convene a full congress, had talked with all the major ambassadors. By mid-May it was clear the allies could not decide on a course of action and, as such, the Holy Alliance was no longer a viable political entity.|$|E
