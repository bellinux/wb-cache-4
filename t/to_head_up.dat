5|$|In 1995, Doggett {{graduated}} from the FBI Academy and assumed the position of FBI Special Agent in the Criminal Investigations Division. In 2000, Agent Doggett was assigned by Deputy Director Alvin Kersh <b>to</b> <b>head</b> <b>up</b> the manhunt to find Special Agent Fox Mulder. The manhunt was unsuccessful and Doggett was demoted {{to work on the}} X-Files with Special Agent Dana Scully.

5|$|Despite initial {{difficulties}} {{in finding a}} producer willing {{to take charge of}} the debut album of a newly signed band, Don Gilmore ultimately agreed <b>to</b> <b>head</b> <b>up</b> the project, with Andy Wallace hired as the mixer. Recording sessions, which mostly involved re-recording the songs off the demo tape, began at NRG Recordings in North Hollywood, California in early 2000 and lasted four weeks. Shinoda's rapping sections in most of the songs were significantly altered from the original, while most choruses remained largely unchanged. Due to the absence of Dave Farrell and Kyle Christener, {{who took part in the}} 1999 extended play, the band hired Scott Koziol and Ian Hornbeck as stand-in bassists; Delson also played bass throughout most of the album. The Dust Brothers provided additional beats for the track “With You”.|$|E
5|$|Mulder goes to {{investigate}} the facility Sheriff Frass mentioned. Before breaking in, he and Scully discuss the odd behavior of the roaches, with Scully hypothesizing that the roaches could be an invasive species. Inside the facility, which resembles a typical house, Mulder sees the walls rippling and is quickly surrounded by roaches. He is then confronted by Dr. Bambi Berenbaum (Bobbie Phillips), a researcher from the Department of Agriculture who is studying cockroaches to develop more effective methods of pest control. Berenbaum has great interest in insects and, incidentally, believes that some UFOs are actually insect swarms flying through electrically charged airspaces. Yet another death occurs in Mulder's hotel, with the individual being found covered in roaches that quickly flee. At this point, Mulder believes that the individual simply died of fright, though Scully begins to wonder {{what is going on}} and decides <b>to</b> <b>head</b> <b>up</b> there herself.|$|E

5|$|The {{buildup of}} {{vehicles}} and men {{trying to use}} the crossing at Wolfheze caused a bottleneck and made progress slow. Rather than wait, brigade headquarters, the KOSB and 156 Para chose <b>to</b> <b>head</b> <b>up</b> and over the railway embankment on foot. Once south of the railway line Support and 'B' Company, 156 Para became mixed up with 10 Para making towards Wolfheze, while the battalion headquarters and other two companies headed further south. At 20:30 divisional headquarters issued orders for all units to fall back on a position around the Hartenstein Hotel in Oosterbeek. The Germans continued to pressure 4th Parachute Brigade and 10 Para dug in around Wolfheze. 156 Para to their south came under constant attack leading to fighting at close quarters throughout the night and into the next morning.|$|E
5|$|Under Wild, Ops (B) was {{expanded}} and {{divided into two}} sections – Operations and Intelligence. It received greater power, including control of the information flowing to double agents. Wild used this to help with planning for Operation Fortitude, the major segment of the Bodyguard plan.

Strangeways and Wild clashed on a personal and professional level. Eventually, Strangeways rewrote large portions of the Fortitude South plan, and pushed Ops (B) into a more supporting role.|$|E
5|$|Between October 1953 and February 1954, the RAAF {{underwent}} major organisational change, as it transitioned from a geographically based command-and-control {{system to}} {{one based on}} function, resulting {{in the establishment of}} Home (operational), Training, and Maintenance Commands.
