25|$|From August 11, 2013, to September 29, 2013, eight {{episodes of}} the live talk show, Talking Bad, aired on AMC, {{following}} Breaking Bad.

25|$|Not {{only did}} it face its sister Mark Goodson-packaged game Classic Concentration on NBC, but the new Now You See It faced a vastly changed {{television}} market {{from the days of}} the original. Syndicated talk shows such as Donahue and Sally Jessy Raphael had become popular and made games like Now You See It seem tame and quaint by comparison. Further, daytime viewership had declined greatly overall since 1975, thanks to a surge in cable and pay channels giving the viewer more choices than just the three major networks. With a greater possibility for local advertising revenue from <b>the</b> <b>talk</b> <b>shows,</b> numerous stations passed on the game despite the solid performance of its lead-in, Family Feud.|$|E

One of the founder members of Genesis FM is also {{the founder of the}} legendary Reggae Sound System Saxon Sound. The station suffered constant attacks by the authorities, but was still regularly on the FM. In 2005 Genesis FM {{was one of the first}} pirate stations to go on the internet and became less consistent and unreliable on the FM, sometimes going months without being on the FM. Genesis FM often used the slogan 'Black power station' and 'the people's station'. Like Galaxy FM, many of <b>the</b> <b>talk</b> <b>shows</b> on Genesis FM are very political and controversial discussions are dealt with. [...] In 2010, Lewisham Lib Dem Councillor Duwayne Brooks, who was present when his friend Stephen Lawrence was killed by racists in 1993 urged the police to engage with unlicensed stations such as Genesis FM to help bring community cohesion and crack down on hard crime. Duwayne Brooks also mentioned growing up listening to Genesis FM and described the station as a tool for people to have a platform to speak, where otherwise their voices are silenced or excluded.|$|E
