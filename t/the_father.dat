5|$|At the Post's home, Hal Dunton {{sits down}} with his love {{interest}} Sue Post, cautiously {{checking to see if}} they are alone. Hal then proposes to Sue and in the excitement, her father comes into the room. He is outraged and believes his daughter is too young to be married and promptly makes Hal leave before scolding his daughter. Before departing, Hal meets and pleads with <b>the</b> <b>father</b> as he takes the daughter away by car. <b>The</b> <b>father</b> refuses and Hal is knocked down before <b>the</b> <b>father</b> and daughter depart to a boarding school. <b>The</b> <b>father</b> meets with the mistress and leaves Sue in her care, much to Sue's distress.|$|E

Hal arrives at the boarding school and the disguise works, claims Sue and drives away. Seconds later <b>the</b> <b>father</b> arrives and confronts the mistress, departing to pursue in a fit of anger. Hal and Sue go to the parson's house to be immediately wed. <b>The</b> <b>father</b> is delayed for a short time by car trouble, but quickly arrives before the two are wed. He bursts in and sees his double and both he and Hal laugh. <b>The</b> <b>father</b> relents and approves the marriage as Hal removes his disguise in front of the stunned Parson.|$|E

5|$|The {{system worked}} as follows. <b>The</b> <b>father's</b> semen and <b>the</b> mother's menses have {{movements}} that encode their parental characteristics.

5000|$|In the diaspora, {{this method}} is {{sometimes}} dropped in favor of adopting the grandfather's name (<b>the</b> <b>father's</b> [...] "last name") as a surname in accordance with Western naming conventions. In contemporary Eritrea (post-Independence from Ethiopia), a person's legal name consists of their given name, followed by the given name of a parent and the given name a parent of that parent. Meanwhile in modern Ethiopia, a person's legal name includes both <b>the</b> <b>father's</b> and grandfather's names (<b>the</b> <b>father's</b> full name), so that <b>the</b> <b>father's</b> name becomes <b>the</b> child's [...] "middle name".|$|R
5|$|The {{first set}} of {{relatives}} that had claim to an epikleros were the paternal uncles and any heirs of the uncles. Next in line were any sons of the sisters of <b>the</b> <b>father</b> and any of their heirs. Third in line were the grandsons of the father's paternal uncles, and following them the grandsons of the paternal aunts of <b>the</b> <b>father.</b> After these paternal relatives were exhausted, then the half-brothers of <b>the</b> <b>father</b> by the same mother were in line, then sons of the maternal half-sisters of <b>the</b> <b>father.</b> Seventh in line were the grandsons of maternal uncles of <b>the</b> <b>father</b> and then grandsons of maternal aunts of <b>the</b> <b>father.</b> It appears {{that if there were}} two or more relatives that were related in the same degree, the eldest of the similarly-related relatives had priority in claiming the epikleros.|$|E

40|$|In general {{there is}} very little {{research}} on the coping styles that <b>the</b> <b>fathers</b> of children suffering from Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD) use in order to cope with the day-to-day demands and stressors that result from their child‘s unique condition. The research study focuses on <b>the</b> <b>fathers</b> of children on the autistic spectrum and how they cope with the stressors resulting from their children‘s condition on daily basis. The study made use of Bronfenbrenner‘s Ecosystemic Theory of Human Development as the guiding theoretical framework in exploring and describing this specific research domain. This was a qualitative study and it was phenomenological, descriptive and analytical in nature. The reason for this was to hear the voices of <b>the</b> <b>fathers</b> and explore in-depth how they deal with the daily stressors resulting from their children‘s condition. Semi-structured interviews were utilised where <b>the</b> <b>fathers</b> {{were asked to respond to}} an open-ended question. The data that was obtained from <b>the</b> <b>fathers</b> was analysed by means of content analysis. The sample size of the study was small (n= 5) and other limitations included a small number of previous studies done on <b>the</b> <b>fathers</b> of children on the autistic spectrum. The literature that is available that focused on <b>the</b> <b>fathers</b> of ASD children are often old and might possibly be out dated. However, this study aimed to hear the voices of <b>the</b> <b>fathers</b> of children on the autistic spectrum and explore how they cope with the daily stressors. Therefore, this study will contribute to the literature on <b>the</b> <b>fathers</b> of ASD children...|$|R

40|$|The Anglican {{study of}} <b>the</b> <b>Fathers</b> was {{primarily}} {{in relation to}} controversies that Anglicanism had to face {{in the aftermath of}} the Reformation and the struggle for Anglican identity, rather than for their own sake. Throughout these controversies it is <b>the</b> <b>Fathers</b> who speak, not only in the defence of Anglicanism, but in defence of themselves and an improper use of their writings. In this sense there is a kinship with <b>the</b> <b>Fathers</b> and <b>the</b> search for Anglican identity, in that, it was the controversies of their own times that gave birth to their writings The thesis divides into three parts. The first part, <b>The</b> <b>Fathers</b> in <b>the</b> English Reformation, examines the way in which the Reformers used <b>the</b> <b>Fathers</b> chiefly as a means of proving what had and what had not been primitive doctrine and practice and as a valuable authority secondary to the Bible. They used <b>the</b> <b>Fathers</b> in two ways, negatively, to prove the absence of Roman doctrines, and positively, to promote a right interpretation of Scripture and demonstrate a Scriptural way of life for the Church. This is demonstrated in relation to two Reformers, Thomas Cranmer and John Jewel, and then in relation to Anglican foundation documents. <b>The</b> second part, <b>Fathers</b> and Carolines, demonstrates how the Anglican divines of the seventeenth century, building on the scriptural and patristic foundation laid by the Reformers, go farther and use the thought and piety of <b>the</b> <b>Fathers</b> within <b>the</b> structure of their own theological vision. Their theology finds its centre in the Incarnation, a kinship shared with <b>the</b> Nicene <b>Fathers,</b> and characterised by a vision of the Church that embraces East and West, a consequence of their immersion in Greek and Latin divinity. Again it is a theological vision that is wrought in controversy, in relation to Puritanism and Calvinism on the one side, and Roman Catholicism on the other. Part Three, Objections and Responses, examines the Anglican response to objections brought against <b>the</b> <b>Fathers.</b> <b>The</b> first series are Direct Objections, and came from such people as John Daille, the controversy surrounding the authenticity of the Ignatian Epistles, and John Barbeyrac. These were attempts to discredit the reputation and authority of <b>the</b> <b>Fathers</b> as having any relevance for the contemporary Church. A second series, Indirect Objections, came in the form of a new Arianism, its associations with Socinianism and its English expression in Unitarianism. It attacked the catholic doctrines of Incarnation and Trinity, some of its advocates using <b>the</b> <b>Fathers</b> to justify their attacks upon orthodoxy. An Appendix has been added to include The Tew Circle, a group of individuals, who were not so much directly attacking <b>the</b> <b>Fathers,</b> but questioning <b>the</b> appeal to antiquity in their search for a simplification of theological method. The presence and voice of <b>the</b> <b>Fathers</b> at <b>the</b> heart of Anglicanism gives to the Church of England what Dr. Jebb, the Bishop of Limerick described as The Peculiar Character of the Church of England. The Oxford Movement has been omitted, since this would need a thesis in itself. Certain nineteenth century theologians equally concerned with the renewal of patristic study, are considered. The names of such people include Henry Gary, John Collinson, J. J. Blunt, their concern being to free <b>the</b> <b>Fathers</b> from <b>the</b> misrepresentations of Daille and Barbeyrac, encourage young divines to read <b>the</b> <b>Fathers</b> and discover <b>the</b> peculiar character of the Church of England, and thereby free themselves from the ruts of modern theology. J. B. Lightfoot is included in relation to the The Ignatian Controversy...|$|R
