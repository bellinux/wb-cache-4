40|$|Measurements of {{the rates}} of {{pressure}} rise and a photo&raphic study of the flames emerging from the maximum experimental safe gap apparatus have shown that although relief venting may reduce the maximum explosion pressure it may increase the rate of pressure rise within the time interval when the reaction zone and following hot combustion products are flowing <b>through</b> the <b>flange</b> gap.

40|$|Abstract: Sulphur hexafluoride (SF 6) is an inert and {{non-toxic}} gas {{with excellent}} properties for arc quenching and electrical insulation applications. The main drawback is its high greenhouse potential. In high voltage apparatuses {{it is used}} in sealed volumes e. g. in the interrupting chamber of a circuit breaker. Even so, <b>through</b> <b>flanges</b> and o-rings we encounter always {{a small amount of}} gas leakage. Therefore monitoring the leakage rate becomes an inevitable duty. Unfortunately the detection of small gas leakages in SF 6 switchgear is not an easy task due to thermally originated fluctuations in the pressure or density signals. For ISH 2007 we presented a new theoretical approach to detect small gas leakages in SF 6 switchgear. In the meanwhile this approach has been modified which lead to a significant reduction of necessary computational power and therefore allows to handle the necessary calculation by a standard personal computer. At the same time the accuracy of the model has been increased to 0. 3 %...|$|R

Rotating actuator turns the disc either parallel or perpendicular to the flow.

5000|$|The final panel {{fabrication}} process, after {{achieving the}} correct surface contour, {{is some kind}} of edge treatment, such as flanging (sheet metal) or wire edging.

Typically, there is {{too much or too little}} metal in the flange, which pulls the panel out of shape after the flange is turnedâ€”so it must be stretched or shrunk to correct the surface shape. This is most easily done using Eckold shrinking and stretching, but can be done using heat shrinking or cold shrinking, by tucking and beating the tucked metal into itself, or by using a cold shrinking hammer and dolly. Stretching or shrinking the flange requires a correct profile hammer and dolly. The hammer and dolly must match the desired flange shape at the point of contact <b>through</b> the <b>flange,</b> (known as ringing the dolly) with the hammer.

30|$|Our rate of hinge {{fractures}} (50 Â %) (TableÂ  2) is high {{compared with}} the 10 â€“ 20 Â % reported after closing-wedge HTO [25]. One {{of the main reasons}} for this difference may lie in the correction. For example, in six of the sixteen osteotomies the correction angle was greater than 8 Â°; the risk of a hinge fracture gets higher when the correction angle increases due to the limited plasticity of the cortical (supracondylar) bone [26]. None of the fractured hinges displaced and, by using a temporary bicortical lag screw compression over the osteotomy, including the hinge, stability was restored.

The objectives of the test campaign were to measure anhydrous ammonia concentrations in a range of few meters to 2 kin from the release, in order to generate data to be used to improve 2 -phase discharge and dispersion modelling. The discharges were released from a 6 -tonne storage tank of pressurised liquid ammonia and through a discharge device with an outlet diameter of 2 in. Fifteen trials were carried out with various release configurations corresponding to industrial situations (impinging jets on the ground and on a wall at various distances, release <b>through</b> a <b>flange</b> without seal [...] .). The quantity of ammonia discharged from the liquid phase varied according to the tests, from 1. 4 to 3. 5 tons for durations between 7 and 14 min and, therefore, at flow rates between 2 and 4. 5 kg/s. Approximately 200 sensors were settled downwind to measure ammonia concentrations and temperature in the plume. These tests showed that for discharges with identical flow rates the distances corresponding to the same concentration vary a lot according to the configurations. These distances tend to be reduced by the presence of obstacles or retention dikes that collected liquid ammonia. In the paper, the main experimental results are presented.

40|$|The {{prediction}} of the behaviour of beam-to-column connections {{can be obtained}} by means of the so- called Â¿component methodÂ¿, largely used in research studies and currently codified in Eurocode 3. The main feature of this approach is its ability to account for any kind of connection, provided that the basic components of deformability and strength are properly identified and modelled. The most important components of beam-to-column joints can be modelled by means of equivalent T-stubs, i. e. two equivalent T-shaped elements connected <b>through</b> the <b>flanges</b> by means of one or more bolt rows. In order to predict the T-stub behaviour, simplified theoretical models are provided by Eurocode 3 which allow to evaluate the T-stub stiffness and resistance. Conversely, there are no codified rules to predict the plastic deformation capacity. Therefore, methods for predicting the T-stub ductility in have been proposed in previous works. Other mechanical model for modelling of stiffness of bolted T-stub connection components have been illustrated. In addition also the modelling of the T-stub cyclic behaviour has been investigated. It can be observed that, even though theoretical models are very important in order to recognize the parameters which govern the stiffness, resistance and ductility of bolted T-stubs, they are not easy to be applied for predicting the overall monotonic and cyclic behaviour. For this reason, in this paper, a simple 2 D FEM model representing the T-Stub behaviour has been developed using SAP 2000 computer program and the accuracy of this approach has been verified by means of a comparison with available experimental results. In addition, the comparison between the proposed FEM model and the theoretical models previously proposed has been performed...|$|R
40|$|A {{system for}} the NDI' testing of the {{integrity}} of conposite materials and of adhesive bonds has been developed to meet industrial requirements. The vibration techniques used {{were found to be}} applicable to the development of fluid measuring transducers. The vibrational spectra of thin rectangular bars were used for the NDT work. A machined cut in a bar had a significant effect on the spectrum but a genuine crack gave an unambiguous response at high amplitudes. This was the generation of fretting crack noise at frequencies far above that of the drive. A specially designed vibrational decrement meter which, in effect, measures mechanical energy loss enabled a numerical classification of material adhesion to be obtained. This was used to study bars which had been flame or plasma sprayed with a variety of materials. It has become a useful tool in optimising coating methods. A direct industrial application was to classify piston rings of high performance I. C. engines. Each consists of a cast iron ring with a channel into which molybdenum, a good bearing surface, is sprayed. The NDT classification agreed quite well with the destructive test normally used. The techniques and equipment used for the NOT work were applied {{to the development of the}} tuning fork transducers investigated by Hassan into commercial density and viscosity devices.

By moving the bellows using vertical and horizontal screws, the SQUID chip is positioned roughly with respect to the sapphire window before precise adjustments are made using the micrometer spindle. The SQUID is a simple washer-type magnetometer fabricated on a 1 Â mmÂ Ã—Â  1 Â mm silicon substrate. The washer is 200 Â Î¼mÂ Ã—Â  200 Â Î¼m with an inner hole of 30 Î¼mÂ Ã—Â  30 Â Î¼m. The SQUID chip is glued onto the tip of the sapphire rod and electrically connected to the electrodes patterned on the rod. We used a low-drift FLL to allow measurements with low-frequency drift noise up to several tens of hours. The field noise was 1.1 Â pT/Hz 1 / 2 at 1 Â Hz, and the low-frequency temperature drift was ~ 10 Â pT/Â°C. The liquid He boil-off rate was reduced significantly from the initial value of 3.1 Â L/day (Kawai et al. 2016) to 2.5 Â L/day after improving the thermal insulation. The SQUID microscope can operate stably for about 4 Â days on 10 Â L of liquid He before the reservoir becomes empty.|$|R
