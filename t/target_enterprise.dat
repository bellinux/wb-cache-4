50|$|Windows Embedded Compact 7 (formerly {{known as}} Windows Embedded CE 7.0) is the seventh major release of Windows Embedded CE {{operating}} system. Windows Embedded Compact 7 is a real-time OS, {{separate from the}} Windows NT line, and is designed to <b>target</b> <b>enterprise</b> specific tools such as industrial controllers and consumer electronics devices such as digital cameras, GPS systems and also automotive infotainment systems. Windows Embedded Compact is designed to run on multiple CPU architectures and supports x86, SH (automotive only), and ARM. During development, a Microsoft employee working in this division claimed that Microsoft was working hard on this release and that it shares the underlying kernel with Windows Phone. Microsoft officially confirmed this and said that Windows Phone 7 is based on Windows Embedded CE 6.0 R3 with some features borrowed from Windows Embedded Compact 7, thus making it a hybrid solution. Windows Embedded Compact 7 was released on March 1, 2011.|$|E

40|$|Although several {{approaches}} {{have been developed}} to evaluate the <b>target</b> <b>enterprise</b> of merger and acquisition (M&A) such as classical net present value (NPV) evaluation model and real options techniques, the logic of pricing processes in all these approaches is still faulty. The classical approach of NPV perspective to price the <b>target</b> <b>enterprise</b> of M&A has been replaced by integration of contemporary perspectives such as NPV perspective, real options perspective, game perspective, and so on. In this paper, the dynamic analyses model to price the <b>target</b> <b>enterprise</b> of M&A is developed from the perspective of real options integrated with game theory under stochastic surroundings. The synergy multiplication coefficient is introduced into the evaluation model to reflect the synergy management process of M&A, and the equilibrium price formula is proposed by applying the famous offer-counteroffer Rubinstein theorem, which is improved to fit for the stochastic surroundings. The price formula is further discussed on condition that the operating cost is more than or less than profit flow, which is assumed to follow geometric Brownian motion process. The numeric simulations show that the proposed formulas in this paper can perfectly well reflect the realistic practice of M&A.

Although Data Mining (DM) {{has been}} applied {{extensively}} in information systems and identified as a crucial tool for automatic data analysis and enterprise knowledge inference, still the practicability of DM has been little explored {{in the construction industry}} in particular. This study is conducted using data from actual practice in the customer service department of the <b>target</b> <b>enterprise.</b> Starting with data preparation, decision tree analysis and domain knowledge inference, practical verification is performed and previously unknown knowledge is discovered. Two practical barriers to enterprise information mining are found: the separation of information among various information systems and lack of key information attributes. Hence, there is a significant limitation on practical information data mining to generate new information, and only with a proper information integration one can benefit from the potential practical application of DM...|$|E

Secondly, it also allows for specifying the domain of authority of the system administrators, and hence provides mechanism to distribute the administrative authority over multiple domains within the enterprise.
