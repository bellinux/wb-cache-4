5|$|The Veneto–Papal {{alliance}} eventually {{expanded into}} the Holy League, which drove the French from Italy in 1512; disagreements about {{the division of}} the spoils, however, led Venice to abandon the alliance in favor of one with France. Under the leadership of Francis I, who had succeeded Louis to the throne, the French and Venetians would, through victory at Marignano in 1515, regain the territory they had lost; the treaties of Noyon and Brussels, which ended the war the next year, would essentially return the map of Italy <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>status</b> <b>quo</b> of 1508.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{collapse}} of the Imperial army, the battle proved to be of little strategic significance. At the insistence of Francis I, the French army resumed the siege of Carignano, where Colonna held out for several weeks. Soon after the city's surrender, Enghien was forced to send twenty-three companies of Italian and Gascon infantry—and nearly half his heavy cavalry—to Picardy, which had been invaded by Charles V. Left without a real army, Enghien was unable to capture Milan. D'Avalos, meanwhile, routed a fresh force of Italian infantry under Pietro Strozzi and the Count of Pitigliano at the Battle of Serravalle. The end of the war saw a return <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>status</b> <b>quo</b> in northern Italy.|$|E

A few days later, the PVA 34th Division and the ROK 9th Infantry Division {{were engaged in a}} seesaw battle on Sniper Ridge on December 2 and 3 but it failed to produce any territorial gains for either side. On December 15, with the PVA 29th Division taking over the control of the battlefield from the 34th Division, the 12th Corps withdrew from the area and the 15th Corps settled back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>status</b> <b>quo</b> prior to October 14.|$|E

5|$|Maximilian held out, making {{another attempt}} to invade Lombardy; his army failed to reach Milan before turning back, and by December 1516, he had entered into {{negotiations}} with Francis. The resulting Treaty of Brussels not only accepted French occupation of Milan, but also confirmed Venetian claims to {{the remainder of the}} Imperial possessions in Lombardy (except for Cremona), effectively ending the war with a return <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>status</b> <b>quo</b> of 1508. The peace, however, would last only four years; the election of Charles V as Holy Roman Emperor in 1519 caused Francis, who had desired the position for himself, to begin the Italian War of 1521–26. The Italian Wars, thus reignited, would then continue until 1530 without significant interruption.|$|E
5|$|Passport to Pimlico {{explores the}} spirit and unity of wartime London in a post-war context and offers an {{examination}} of the English character. Like other of the Ealing comedies, the film pits a small group of British against a series of changes <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>status</b> <b>quo</b> from an external agent. The story was an original concept by the screenwriter T. E. B. Clarke. He was inspired by an incident during the Second World War, when the maternity ward of Ottawa Civic Hospital was temporarily declared extraterritorial by the Canadian government so that when Princess Juliana of the Netherlands gave birth, the baby was born on Dutch territory, and would not lose her right to the throne.|$|E

Sweden had come close to dominating the Baltic, which was not {{in the interest of the}} major powers. England, France and to a lesser extent the Netherlands all favored a return <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>status</b> <b>quo</b> of the Roskilde peace. In Denmark, the war resulted in sweeping social changes. Frederick III browbeat the nobility which had long held power in Denmark into accepting a hereditary and absolute monarchy.|$|E

5|$|By 1678, Frederick William {{had cleared}} Swedish Pomerania and {{occupied}} most of it, {{with the exception}} of Rügen which was held by Denmark–Norway. This was followed by another success against Sweden, when Frederick William cleared Prussia of Swedish forces in {{what became known as the}} Great Sleigh Drive. However, when Louis XIV of France concluded the Dutch War by the Nijmegen treaties, he marched his armies east to relieve his Swedish ally, and forced Frederick William to basically return <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>status</b> <b>quo</b> ante bellum by the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1679). Though the Scanian War resulted only in minor territorial gains, attaching a small strip of the Swedish Pomeranian right bank of the lower Oder to Brandenburg-Prussian Pomerania, the war resulted in a huge gain of prestige for the elector.|$|E
5|$|Common public {{explanations}} for the college's closure include student radicalism, lack of discipline, administrative issues, and financial issues. The Nations Eliseo Vivas blamed its lack of grades as detrimental to student incentive, and judged the effort to create self-motivated students through freedom to be a failure. In School and Society, Professor Grant Showerman also credited the college's freedoms and lack of compulsions with its demise. Proponents of the Experimental College painted it as the foil of a conservative, standard college, and blamed educational stagnation on the existing order. Meiklejohn believed in a liberal education's power to change society through imagining alternatives <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>status</b> <b>quo.</b> He aimed to produce students who could counterbalance society with independence of thought, but admitted {{that he did not}} know how to facilitate this.|$|E
5|$|With the Peace of Basel, the {{relations}} between the Old Swiss Confederacy and the empire returned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>status</b> <b>quo</b> ante from before the Diet of Worms in 1495. The imperial ban was dropped silently. Maximilian had to accept the refusal of the cantons and to abandon implicitly the Habsburg claims on their territories, acknowledging their independence. Consequently, the then ten members of the Swiss Confederacy remained exempt from the jurisdiction of the Reichskammergericht. The Swiss henceforth exercised also the high justice over the Thurgau. The war had not caused any territorial changes, except in the area around Schaffhausen, where the city had succeeded to assert its hegemony over some places that had formerly belonged to the Bishop of Constance.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} a market which is protected against entry through legislation. While one lobby aims at opening the market so that prices decrease, the other lobby wants <b>to</b> maintain <b>the</b> <b>status</b> <b>quo.</b> <b>The</b> decision whether <b>to</b> open <b>the</b> market {{or not is}} made by a legislature that convenes every period and can be influenced through bribes. We analyze the strategic timing of lobbying, {{which is similar to}} investment decisions under uncertainty: For the deregulation lobby, is it better <b>to</b> attack <b>the</b> <b>status</b> <b>quo</b> today, or rather to wait? Similarly, how much should the incumbent lobby spend in order <b>to</b> defend <b>the</b> <b>status</b> <b>quo</b> against an attack, if one occurs? We derive the equilibrium of this game, and find the associated “attack threshold”. The main results are that the attack threshold is considerably lower than in a comparable one period game, and that the expenditure level necessary <b>to</b> change <b>the</b> <b>status</b> <b>quo</b> is low in comparison <b>to</b> <b>the</b> prize; this provides a possible solution for Tullock’s (1989) “rent seeking paradox”...|$|R

5|$|In 1658 Charles X Gustav {{decided that}} instead of {{returning}} to the remaining Swedish strongholds in Poland–Lithuania, he would rather attack Denmark again. This time, Denmark withstood the attack and the anti-Swedish allies pursued Charles X Gustav to Jutland and Swedish Pomerania. Throughout 1659, Sweden was defending her strongholds in Denmark and on the southern Baltic shore, while little was gained by the allies and a peace was negotiated. When Charles X Gustav died in February 1660, his successor settled for the Treaty of Oliva with Poland–Lithuania, Habsburg and Brandenburg in April and the Treaty of Copenhagen with Denmark in May. Sweden was to keep most of her gains from Roskilde, the Duchy of Prussia became a sovereign state, and otherwise the parties largely returned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>status</b> <b>quo</b> ante bellum. Sweden had already concluded a truce with Russia in 1658, which {{gave way to a}} final settlement in the Treaty of Cardis in 1661.|$|E
5|$|In about 1143 Foliot {{wrote an}} account of the {{proceedings}} of the council in a letter to one of Matilda's supporters. No action was taken on her claim, and no conclusion was reached as to its validity. The papacy continued to accept Stephen as king, and the pope ordered the English Church to make no changes <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>status</b> <b>quo.</b> According to Foliot's letter the council's deliberations centred on the legitimacy of the marriage between Matilda's parents. Matilda's mother, Edith-Matilda, had been educated at a convent, and there was some uncertainty over whether she had taken vows before her marriage to Henry I. At the time of the council, the question caused some concern, although in time most were persuaded that the marriage was valid because Anselm of Canterbury had performed the ceremony. Foliot seems to have had some doubts in 1139, but before writing his letter of 1143 he had come to believe that Matilda was indeed the legitimate heiress, and he supported the Angevin cause, as Matilda's claim was known.|$|E
