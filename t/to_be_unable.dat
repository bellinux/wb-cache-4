5|$|Apotropaics—items able to {{ward off}} revenants—are common in vampire folklore. Garlic is a common example, a branch of wild rose and {{hawthorn}} plant are said to harm vampires, and in Europe, sprinkling mustard seeds {{on the roof of}} a house was said to keep them away. Other apotropaics include sacred items, for example a crucifix, rosary, or holy water. Vampires are said <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>unable</b> to walk on consecrated ground, such as that of churches or temples, or cross running water.|$|E
5|$|Despite improvements, {{several aspects}} of the {{transport}} sector were still riddled with problems due to outdated infrastructure, lack of investment, corruption and bad decision-making by the central authorities. The demand for transport infrastructure and services was rising, but the Soviet authorities proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>unable</b> to meet the growing demand of the people. The underdeveloped Soviet road network, in a chain reaction, led to a growing demand for public transport. The nation's merchant fleet {{was one of the}} largest in the world.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the keys}} for the Hokie defense would be linebacker Brandon Manning, who {{attended}} the Air Force Academy's preparatory school before deciding to walk on to Virginia Tech's football team instead of attending the Academy. Manning was Tech's No.3 tackler in terms of statistics, accumulating 70tackles {{during the course of}} the regular season. Virginia Tech defensive tackle Jimmy Williams injured his ankle twodays prior to the game, causing him <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>unable</b> to play. Tech's Richard Johnson was also listed as injured and unlikely to play.|$|E
5|$|After {{the initial}} concerts, the group flew to New York's Record Plant Studios at Lambert's suggestion, for studio recordings. The group {{were joined by}} guests Al Kooper on Hammond organ, Ken Ascher on piano and Leslie West on guitar. Townshend used a 1957 Gretsch guitar, {{given to him by}} Joe Walsh, during the session and it went on to become his main guitar for studio recording. Lambert's {{participation}} in the recording was minimal, and he proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>unable</b> to mix the final recordings. He had started taking hard drugs, while Townshend was drinking brandy regularly. After returning to Britain, engineer Glyn Johns made safety copies of the Record Plant material but decided {{that it would be better}} to re-record it from scratch at Olympic Sound Studios in Barnes.|$|E
5|$|During the 1970s, the Yakovlev Yak-38, {{then the}} Soviet Navy's only {{operational}} carrier-based fixed-wing combat aircraft, was found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>unable</b> to undertake its role due to limited range and payload, which severely hampered {{the capability of}} the Soviet Navy's Project 1143 carriers. It was decided to develop a bigger and more potent carrier capable of operating STOL aircraft. During the assessment period, a number of carriers were studied; the Project 1160 carrier {{would have been able}} to operate the MiG-23s and Su-24s, but was abandoned due to budget constraints. Design efforts were then concentrated on the Project 1153 carrier, which would have accommodated the Su-25s and the proposed MiG-23Ks and Su-27Ks. Sufficient funding was not secured, and the Navy looked at the possibility of a fifth, and larger, Project 1143 carrier, modified to allow for Yak-141, MiG-29K and Su-27K operations.|$|E

5|$|Green was {{released}} from the police station in the early morning of October 24 after questioning. With the family home burned down, she had nowhere to stay. Farrar refused to let her stay in his apartment, but gave her some cash, and she rented a room in a local hotel. Ellen Ryan, Green's divorce lawyer, found her there later in the day in a distraught state. She repeatedly asked Ryan whether her children had died, chanted rhythmically about their deaths, and seemed unable to care for herself. Green was transported to a local hospital for treatment but remained emotionally unstable, suffering from insomnia and appearing to Ryan <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>unable</b> to take care of day-to-day life, even after her release from the hospital.|$|E
5|$|Guèye had {{arranged}} {{for the creation of}} the Senegalese Ski Federation in 1979, and had initially expected <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>unable</b> to compete at the 1984 Olympics due to the qualification requirements and as he was recovering from an injury, but was informed by the International Olympic Committee several months prior that he would be allowed to represent Senegal. Guèye was the first black African to compete at the Winter Games; South Africa became the first African nation to compete at a Winter Games, in 1960, but with an all-white team under apartheid.|$|E
5|$|In {{diplomatic}} {{talks with}} the Ho-Chunks {{at the close of}} the war, General Atkinson promised that the U.S. government would look into their grievances in the lead mining region. Thomas McKenney requested military aid to evict American miners who were trespassing on Ho-Chunk land, but after the war, settlers poured into the region in unprecedented numbers, and U.S. officials proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>unable</b> or unwilling to stem the tide. By January 1828, there were as many as 10,000 illegal settlers on Ho-Chunk land, including militia general Henry Dodge, who established a mining camp after the war and boasted that the U.S. Army could not make him leave. Having no other options, on August 25, 1828, the Ho-Chunks signed a provisional treaty with the United States, agreeing to sell the land occupied by the miners in a more formal treaty to be held later.|$|E

5|$|Lambert proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>unable</b> {{to mix the}} track, and a fresh {{attempt at}} {{recording}} was made {{at the start of}} April at Mick Jagger's house, Stargroves, using the Rolling Stones Mobile Studio. Glyn Johns was invited to help with production, and he decided to re-use the synthesized organ track from Townshend's original demo, as the re-recording of the part in New York was felt to be inferior to the original. Keith Moon had to carefully synchronise his drum playing with the synthesizer, while Townshend and Entwistle played electric guitar and bass.|$|E
5|$|The War Office and the Army were concluding, at this point, {{that light}} tanks were a {{liability}} and too vulnerable {{for use in}} further combat, and the Tetrarch {{was considered to be}} obsolete. This decision may have marked the end for the Tetrarch in active service; several of the tanks destined to be deployed to the Eighth Army in the Middle East for the North African Campaign were left in Britain when their cooling systems were determined <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>unable</b> to cope with the intense North African heat.|$|E
5|$|The {{offensive}} was resumed at 4.00 a.m. on 19 September after a {{night of}} heavy shelling. The operation involved the British 77th and 65th Brigades, the 2nd French Zouaves Regiment, along with the Serres and 14th Greek Divisions. Following five hours of intense fighting the Allies managed to overrun the town of Dojran, mount Kala Tepe and Teton Hill, with the Pip Ridge and mount Dub remaining in Bulgarian hands. In the aftermath of the engagement the Allied command found itself <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>unable</b> to make any further offensive operations on the Doiran sector as it no longer possessed an adequate reserve of manpower. Bulgaria lost a total of 518 dead, 998 wounded, and 1,210 captured. Greek casualties amounted to 503 killed, 2,286 injured and 615 missing,with the British suffering 3,871 dead and wounded.|$|E

Mister Negative then has his surgeon Doctor Tramma revive Hammerhead and offers to transplant his brain {{into a new}} robotic adamantium skeleton, which Hammerhead agrees to.|$|R

5|$|A further Scottish {{distinction}} {{from the}} UK flag days {{is that on}} Saint Andrew's Day, (30 November), the Union Flag will only be flown where a building {{has more than one}} flagpole; the Saltire will not be lowered {{to make way for the}} Union Flag where a single flagpole is present. If there are two or more flagpoles present, the Saltire may be flown in addition to the Union Flag but not in a superior position. This distinction arose after Members of the Scottish Parliament complained that Scotland was the only country in the world where the potential existed for the citizens of a country <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>unable</b> to fly their national flag on their country's national day. (In recent years, embassies of the United Kingdom have also flown the Saltire to mark St Andrew's Day). Many bodies of the Scottish Government use the flag as a design basis for their logo; for example, Safer Scotland's emblem depicts a lighthouse shining beams in a saltire shape onto a blue sky. Other Scottish bodies, both private and public, have also used the saltire in similar ways.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 24 clubs {{have reached the}} final, of whom 16 have won the competition. The first winners were Dundee in 1990. The most {{successful}} club is Falkirk with four wins from four final appearances. Ross County, Hamilton Academical and Queen of the South have also reached the final four times, all winning and losing twice each. Three clubs have reached the final in successive seasons; Ayr United did so {{in the first two}} years of the tournament but lost both. The only teams to have successfully defended their title are Hamilton Academical and the original Airdrieonians. It is possible for the winner of the tournament <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>unable</b> to defend their title; if a club is promoted from the Scottish Championship (second tier) in the same season to the Scottish Premiership (first tier), the club becomes ineligible to compete in the tournament. This has happened to Falkirk twice, Inverness Caledonian Thistle, St Mirren and Rangers.|$|E
5|$|Almost a {{thousand}} impact craters on Venus are evenly distributed across its surface. On other cratered bodies, such as Earth and the Moon, craters show {{a range of}} states of degradation. On the Moon, degradation is caused by subsequent impacts, whereas on Earth it is caused by wind and rain erosion. On Venus, about 85% of the craters are in pristine condition. The number of craters, together with their well-preserved condition, indicates the planet underwent a global resurfacing event about 300–600 million years ago, followed by a decay in volcanism. Whereas Earth's crust is in continuous motion, Venus is thought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>unable</b> to sustain such a process. Without plate tectonics to dissipate heat from its mantle, Venus instead undergoes a cyclical process in which mantle temperatures rise until they reach a critical level that weakens the crust. Then, {{over a period of}} about 100 million years, subduction occurs on an enormous scale, completely recycling the crust.|$|E

5|$|Arsenal {{started the}} match through {{kick-off}} Henry. There {{minutes into the}} match, captain Tony Adams attempted to clear the ball via a header, only for it to land at Arif Erdem, who attempted a volley shot outside the Arsenal area, deflecting off the goal post. As a result, Galatasaray were awarded a corner. Erdem took it, but failed to trouble the defense, as the ball was easily cleared away. Arsenal responded via Bergkamp, who received the ball from Marc Overmars; Bergkamp attempted to outrun Galatasaray defenders Capone and Gheorghe Popescu and into their area, only <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>unable</b> to keep the ball in match play. Arsenal even fashioned more chances, as Overmars won a one-on-one encounter against Capone, trying to reach Bergkamp, but the ball was easily read by Popescu for a corner. The corner was came to nothing, as Patrick Vieira tried to hit the ball, before it landed for an opportunity for Henry, whose shot went over the goal post. A third of the match played, Arsenal were awarded a free-kick opportunity, after Okan Buruk received a yellow card for committing a sliding tackle on Vieira.|$|E
5|$|During the 20th century, {{there was}} {{increasing}} demand to replace or supplement the Saltash and Torpoint ferries, {{which could not}} cope with the rise in motor traffic. After the Government refused to prioritise the project in the 1950s, it was self-financed by Plymouth City Council and Cornwall County Council. Construction was undertaken by the Cleveland Bridge & Engineering Company and began in 1959. It was unofficially opened in October 1961, with a formal presentation by Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother in April 1962. A reconstruction of the bridge began in 1999 after it was found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>unable</b> to support a European Union requirement for goods vehicle weights. The work involved building two new parallel decks while the original construction was completely rebuilt. The project was completed in late 2001 and formally opened by Princess Anne in April 2002. The extra decks have remained in use, increasing the bridge's capacity.|$|E
5|$|Friedrich Eckoldt was {{allocated}} to Group 2 for the Norwegian portion of Operation Weserübung. The group's {{task was to}} transport the 138th Mountain Infantry Regiment (138. Gebirgsjäger Regiment) to seize Trondheim together with Admiral Hipper. The ships began loading troops on 6 April and set sail the next day. Eckoldts port propeller shaft began to overheat shortly after passing {{the mouth of the}} Elbe River and she had to slow down. The ship managed to repair the problem and joined the main body later in the day. The ship escorted Admiral Hipper as they entered Trondheim Fjord and both ships disembarked their troops once they reached Trondheim harbor. All of the German ships proved to be very low on fuel after their journey and fuel oil was transferred to Eckoldt from Theodor Riedel and Heinemann. Admiral Hipper and Eckoldt attempted to leave on the night of 10 April, but the smaller ship proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>unable</b> to match Admiral Hippers speed in the heavy seas encountered and was forced to turn back. After some fuel was discovered in Trondheim on 12 April, the ship and Heinemann sailed for Germany two days later.|$|E
