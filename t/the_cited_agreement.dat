50|$|Recording at RCA's Nashville studios {{with the}} label's {{personnel}} did not please Jennings. During the sessions for the album This Time, {{he moved his}} operation to Glaser Sound Studio. RCA initially refused to release <b>the</b> record, <b>citing</b> their <b>agreement</b> with <b>the</b> Engineers Union. The deal established that RCA artists could only record in the company's studio with label engineers. In a September 1973 interview with The Tennessean, Neil Reshen said RCA Records had violated Jennings' contract {{and talked about the}} possibility of signing the singer to another label. RCA Nashville director Jerry Bradley and New York-based label executive Mel Ilberman decided to allow Jennings to record at Glaser Sound, and broke RCA's deal with the Engineers Union.

The teams also wound up on opposite sides of a dispute over the Trans-Border Agreement, which allowed the Canadiens and Toronto Maple Leafs to receive most of the proceeds from television rights in Canada. The Nordiques joined U.S.-based franchises in 1984 in trying to have games played in the U.S. televised; this led to a $22 million lawsuit by the other Canada-based teams, which was settled out of court.|$|R

40|$|The {{behavior}} of spherical water-ice particles in interplanetary space is investigated theoretically using an equation {{which gives the}} sublimation rate {{as a function of}} the solar energy distribution at 1 AU, solar distance, the temperature of the ice-particle surface, the temperature of the surrounding background, particle absorption efficiency, particle radius, and the complex refractive index of ice. The variation of sublimation rate with particle size is examined, and it is shown that the sublimation rate depends critically on the absorptivity of ice in the near-IR spectral region. Two different spectral-absorption curves are plotted on the basis of two different choices for the complex refractive index of ice, and an attempt is made to decide experimentally which energy distribution is more appropriate. Results of direct laboratory measurements of the sublimation rate of smooth spherical ice particles are compared with the theoretical results obtained from <b>the</b> <b>cited</b> sublimation-rate equation. <b>Agreement</b> between theory and experiment is found to be excellent when the complex refractive indices given by Bertie et al., (1969) are employed.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to verify empirically whether the Specific Trade Concerns (STCs) {{regarding}} Technical Barriers to Trade (TBTs) notifications by WTO members can serve as an early warning system for past and future disputes (DS) covering allegedly trade restricting TBTs. WTO members, in order to increase transparency of trade policies, have made efforts to compile data on notified TBTs. For several years the WTO provides a TBT dataset, used in our paper, which covers the STCs raised by its members (“reverse” notifications). From 1995 - 2011, there have been 45 requests for consultation under the Dispute Settlement (DS) Body of the World Trade Organization (WTO) in order to identify possible violations of the technical barriers to trade (TBT) agreement. This paper attempts to find the linkages between DS cases <b>citing</b> <b>the</b> TBT <b>agreement</b> and the STC data regarding TBTs.

The G4 noted that they had hoped to begin concrete negotiations during the 70th session, arguing that the longer Security Council reform is postponed, the greater the discredit to the UN.
