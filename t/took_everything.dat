5|$|After {{crossing}} the Mississippi River south of Vicksburg at Bruinsburg and driving northeast, Grant won battles at Port Gibson and Raymond and captured Jackson, the Mississippi state capital, on May 14, 1863, forcing Pemberton to withdraw westward. Attempts {{to stop the}} Union advance at Champion Hill and Big Black River Bridge were unsuccessful. Pemberton knew that the corps under Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman was preparing to flank him from the north; {{he had no choice}} but to withdraw or be outflanked. Pemberton burned the bridges over the Big Black River and <b>took</b> <b>everything</b> edible in his path, both animal and plant, as he retreated to the well-fortified city of Vicksburg.|$|E
5|$|As Alcibiades had suspected, {{his absence}} emboldened his enemies, {{and they began}} to accuse him of other sacrilegious actions and {{comments}} and even alleged that these actions were connected with a plot against the democracy. According to Thucydides, the Athenians were always in fear and <b>took</b> <b>everything</b> suspiciously. When the fleet arrived in Catana, it found the state trireme Salaminia waiting to bring Alcibiades and the others indicted for mutilating the hermai or profaning the Eleusinian Mysteries back to Athens to stand trial. Alcibiades told the heralds that he would follow them back to Athens in his ship, but in Thurii he escaped with his crew; in Athens he was convicted in absentia and condemned to death. His property was confiscated and a reward of one talent was promised to whoever succeeded in killing any who had fled. Meanwhile, the Athenian force in Sicily, after a few early victories, moved against Messina, where the Generals expected their secret allies within the city to betray it to them. Alcibiades, however, foreseeing that he would be outlawed, gave information to the friends of the Syracusans in Messina, who succeeded in preventing the admission of the Athenians. With the death of Lamachus in battle some time later, command of the Sicilian Expedition fell into the hands of Nicias, whom modern scholars have judged to be an inadequate military leader.|$|E
25|$|In {{this version}} a Starkad Ala-Warrior lived in {{northern}} Norway at the waterfalls of Alufoss. He {{descended from the}} giants known as the þursar (jotuns), and his father's name was Storkvid. Starkad {{was very much a}} jotun himself and had eight arms, but he was betrothed to a girl named Ogn Elf-burst. One day, when Starkad had gone north across the Élivágar, another giant named Hergrim kidnapped Ogn. Starkad challenged Hergrim to a holmgang, a duel. Starkad used four swords {{at the same time and}} slew Hergrim. Ogn did not wish to be Starkad's wife and committed suicide by stabbing herself with a sword. Starkad <b>took</b> <b>everything</b> Hergrimr owned including his son Grimr.|$|E

25|$|When Winchester died, {{all of her}} {{possessions}} (apart {{from the}} house) were bequeathed to her niece and personal secretary. Her niece then <b>took</b> <b>everything</b> she wanted and sold the rest in a private auction. It supposedly took six trucks working {{eight hours a day}} for six weeks to remove all of the furniture from the home, an account disputed by Winchester's biographer. Mrs. Winchester made no mention of the mansion in her will, and appraisers considered the house worthless due to damage caused by the earthquake, the unfinished design and the impractical nature of its construction. It was sold at auction to a local investor for over $135,000, and subsequently leased for 10 years to John and Mayme Brown, who eventually purchased the house. In February 1923, five months after Winchester's death, the house was opened to the public, with Mayme Brown serving as the first tour guide. Harry Houdini toured the mansion in 1924 and the newspaper account of his visit (displayed in the rifle museum on the estate) called it the Mystery House.|$|E

500|$|Saltykov {{had little}} {{concern about the}} extreme {{northwest}}ern face of the ridge, which was steep and fronted by the marshy Elsbruch, {{but a few of}} the Austrian contingents faced northwest as a precaution. He expected Frederick to attack him from the west, from Frankfurt, and from the Frankfurt outer city. The Russians constructed redans and flèche [...] to protect all the potentially weak points of their fortifications; they built glacis to cover the most shallow of the hills, and scarps and counterscarps to protect seemingly weak points. Abatis not only littered the hillsides, but dotted flat ground. [...] By 10 August, his scouts had told him that Frederick was at the far western edge of Frankfurt. Accordingly, Saltykov <b>took</b> <b>everything</b> he could from the city by way of sustenance, all oxen, sheep, chickens, produce, wine, beer, in a flurry of ransacking.|$|E
500|$|Banker sailed {{with her}} team members from New Jersey on 6 March 1918, {{to take up}} the {{assignment}} as chief operator for First Army headquarters in Paris. After arriving with her team in England, the group set sail by ferry across the English Channel. However, bad [...] weather, in the form of thick fog, prevented the ferry from reaching French shores, and it had to be anchored a few miles away to wait for the fog to lift. This location made the vessel an easy target for German bombing (at that time, one vessel out of four had suffered bombing), and the team members remained at full readiness to evacuate the vessel at short notice. The women's group stayed on deck in the open for forty-eight continuous hours. This situation did not dishearten Banker or her team members, and, as Banker later said: [...] "What good sports girls were in that First Unit! They <b>took</b> <b>everything</b> in their stride.

500|$|The tour {{concluded}} with the November 22, 2009, show at HSBC Arena in Buffalo, New York. [...] Fans came {{from far away}} and the show dominated {{the feel of the}} city that day. [...] The full album played was Springsteen's first, Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J., which he wryly said [...] "was the miracle. This was the record that <b>took</b> <b>everything</b> from way below zero to ... one." [...] The performance of it was dedicated to his first manager and producer, Mike Appel, who was present in the audience, and featured quite rare renditions of [...] "Mary Queen of Arkansas" [...] and (the first ever with the E Street Band) [...] "The Angel". [...] Other rarities peppered the 34-song, nearly 3½-hour night, including Chuck Willis's [...] "(I Don't Want to) Hang Up My Rock and Roll Shoes" [...] and, to mark Steven Van Zandt's birthday, totally obscure outtake [...] "Restless Nights" [...] (supposedly Van Zandt's favorite Springsteen song) and a now-unusual second song from the current album, [...] "Surprise Surprise". [...] Near the end he said, [...] "So we're gonna say goodbye, but just for a little while ... a very little while ..." [...] The tour finished not with the emotional statement in song that some other Springsteen tours have in the 2000s, but instead with John Fogerty's [...] "Rockin' All Over the World".|$|E

[...] As late as 2009, many fans still considered MKII to be the best title in the series. According to a 2011 article by Mike Harradence of PlayStation Universe, the [...] "bigger, bolder and bloodier" [...] game remains [...] "a firm fan favourite among MK aficionados." [...] That year, IGN's Richard George wrote that [...] "Mortal Kombat II is considered by many to be the pinnacle of the series" [...] and called it [...] "still one of the most fun 16-bit fighters to play." [...] In 2013, Rich Knight and Hanuman Welch of Complex wrote that [...] "Mortal Kombat II <b>took</b> <b>everything</b> we loved about the original and magnified it by about a million. (...) We still love this game." [...] That same year, Knight and Gus Turner from the same magazine also ranked it as the sixth best 2D fighting game of all time, stating: [...] "Truth be told, the latest MK has nothing on this one. Nothing. A step up from the original in every way, MK II was, and still is, a solid, violent game that's an essential title to grab for any serious fan of fighting games." [...] In 2014, Kevin Wong of Complex wrote: [...] "Today, we remember Mortal Kombat II for its anarchic spirit: the game was endlessly intriguing and weird, and it had an uneasy atmosphere, anything could happen at any given moment. Critics derided Mortal Kombat as meaningless shock value, but its sequel proved those naysayers wrong. Mortal Kombat II was a Flawless Victory: irreverent, hilarious, and horrific in equal measures." ...|$|E

He came suddenly to Rome with his forces and captured the city, and having destroyed Maximus and all his forces, he <b>took</b> <b>everything</b> from the palace, even the bronze statues. He even led away as captives surviving senators, accompanied by their wives; along with them he also carried off to Carthage in Africa the empress Eudoxia, who had summoned him; her daughter Placidia, the wife of the patrician Olybrius, who then was staying at Constantinople; and even the maiden Eudocia. After he had returned, Gaiseric gave the younger Eudocia, a maiden, {{the daughter of the}} empress Eudoxia, to his son Huneric in marriage, and he held them both, the mother and the daughter, in great honor"(Chron. 366).|$|E

A. is a missionary, and he appears {{to be a very good}} sort of a fellow, but I cannot for the life of me approve of his methods....You see, when the soldiers came to Peking and these missionaries were safe, some of them began at once to clamor for damages that they said they had sustained. The first thing that they did was to get for living places the palaces of the rich Chinese Princes, and when they had them they started in clearing them out. They <b>took</b> <b>everything</b> of value and sold it for a song. Then they let their native Christians go out hunting and stealing more loot, and then they sold that. They said it was no sin and eased their consciences by saying they had the right to reimburse themselves for the losses they sustained. It was just as if a man had stolen something from me, and, to get square, I went and stole something from him. In other words, two wrongs make a right. That may be all right, but I don't think so. At A.'s home, which was the palace of Prince Pei, a Manchu, before the trouble, I met a lot more missionaries." ...|$|E
