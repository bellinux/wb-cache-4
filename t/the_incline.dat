5|$|On 1 October 1831, some wagons {{ran away}} on an {{inclined}} plane, worked by a stationary steam engine, at Avenhambrow. The brakesman jumped off but was run over {{and killed by}} wagons being drawn up <b>the</b> <b>incline</b> on an adjacent line.|$|E
40|$|The {{convective}} instability of pore-fluid flow in inclined and fluid-saturated three-dimensional fault zones has been theoretically investigated in this paper. Due to {{the consideration of}} <b>the</b> <b>inclined</b> three-dimensional fault zone with any values of <b>the</b> <b>inclined</b> angle, {{it is impossible to}} use the conventional linear stability analysis method for deriving the critical condition (i. e., the critical Rayleigh number) which can be used to investigate the {{convective instability}} of the pore-fluid flow in an inclined three-dimensional fault zone system. To overcome this mathematical difficulty, a combination of the variable separation method and the integration elimination method has been used to derive the characteristic equation, which depends on the Rayleigh number and <b>the</b> <b>inclined</b> angle of <b>the</b> <b>inclined</b> three-dimensional fault zone. Using this characteristic equation, the critical Rayleigh number of the system can be numerically found as a function of <b>the</b> <b>inclined</b> angle of <b>the</b> three-dimensional fault zone. For a vertically oriented three-dimensional fault zone system, the critical Rayleigh number of the system can be explicitly derived from the characteristic equation. Comparison of the resulting critical Rayleigh number of the system with that previously derived in a vertically oriented three-dimensional fault zone has demonstrated that the characteristic equation of the Rayleigh number is correct and useful for investigating the convective instability of pore-fluid flow in <b>the</b> <b>inclined</b> three-dimensional fault zone system. The related numerical results from this investigation have indicated that: (1) the convective pore-fluid flow may take place in <b>the</b> <b>inclined</b> three-dimensional fault zone; (2) if the height of the fault zone is used as the characteristic length of the system, a decrease in <b>the</b> <b>inclined</b> angle of <b>the</b> <b>inclined</b> fault zone stabilizes the three-dimensional fundamental convective flow in <b>the</b> <b>inclined</b> three-dimensional fault zone system; (3) if the thickness of the stratum is used as the characteristic length of the system, a decrease in <b>the</b> <b>inclined</b> angle of <b>the</b> <b>inclined</b> fault zone destabilizes the three-dimensional fundamental convective flow in <b>the</b> <b>inclined</b> three-dimensional fault zone system; and that (4) the shape of <b>the</b> <b>inclined</b> three-dimensional fault zone may affect the convective instability of pore-fluid flow in the system.

The remains of Brendon Hill station are Grade II listed. The remains of the summit winding house can be approached but are dangerous to enter: they are located just west of the junction of the B3224 and B3190 roads. A chapel built to attend to the spiritual needs of the miners and their families still stands at the junction.|$|E
5|$|The line {{of route}} runs {{parallel}} to the West Somerset Railway from Watchet to Washford where it forms a foot and cycle path. Washford station has been demolished and a bungalow is on the site. The line then curves south west, partly {{in the form of}} a road, past Cleeve Abbey and Roadwater, where the station buildings survive with an extension to form a bungalow. The line continues to Comberow. The siding group that was at the foot of <b>the</b> <b>incline</b> is clearly identifiable at Comberow, to the west of the bridge that carried <b>the</b> <b>incline,</b> as is the station master's house and traces of the platform.

5|$|After {{a catastrophic}} flood in 1889, the Johnstown Inclined Plane was {{completed}} in 1891 {{to serve as an}} escape route for future floods, as well as a convenient mode of transportation for the residents of the new communities situated above the valley. It was operated by Cambria Iron Company and its successor Bethlehem Steel until 1935, when it was sold to the borough of Westmont. <b>The</b> <b>incline</b> was briefly shut down in 1962 when its supply of power from Bethlehem Steel was terminated. Twice in its history, the Johnstown Inclined Plane fulfilled its role as a means of evacuation from floodsonce in 1936 and again in 1977. <b>The</b> <b>incline</b> was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973 and was designated a Historic Mechanical Engineering Landmark in 1994.

50|$|Another design variation, which {{improves}} {{the efficiency of}} the separation unit is the way the effluent enters the lamella clarifier. Standard clarifier design has the effluent entering at the bottom of <b>the</b> <b>inclined</b> plates, colliding with the sludge sliding down the plates. This mixing region renders the bottom 20% of <b>the</b> <b>inclined</b> plates unusable for settling. By designing the lamella clarifier so that the effluent enters <b>the</b> <b>inclined</b> plates without interfering with the downward slurry flow the capacity of the lamella clarifier can be improved by 25%.|$|R
50|$|This {{is like a}} {{constant}} downward acceleration due to gravity with a slight modification.

40|$|In this study, self-assembled {{inclined}} (1 - 10 - 3) -oriented GaN nanorods (NRs) {{were grown}} on nanoimprinted (10 - 10) m-sapphire substrates using catalyst-free metal-organic chemical vapor deposition. According to X-ray phi-scans, <b>the</b> <b>inclined</b> GaN NRs were tilted {{at an angle}} of ∼ 57. 5 ° to the [10 - 10]sapp direction. Specifically, the GaN NRs grew in a single <b>inclined</b> direction to <b>the</b> [11 - 20]sapp. Uni-directionally inclined NRs were formed through the one-sided (10 - 11) -faceted growth of the interfacial a-GaN plane layer. It was confirmed that {{a thin layer of}} a-GaN was formed on r-facet nanogrooves of the m-sapphire substrate by nitridation.

5|$|The {{other main}} sources of {{information}} are maps, particularly those published {{at the time the}} canal was to be converted into a railway. These clearly show twin-track inclines at Capel Ifan and Pont Henry, and because most of the traffic was in the downhill direction, a simple counterbalanced system was probably employed, although it has also been suggested that the barge may have been balanced by a water tank on the second track to more easily control the speed of descent. The Hirwaunissa incline was longer and narrower than the other two, and only included a single track. Recent research has suggested that <b>the</b> <b>incline</b> was powered by a water wheel, with the waste water running down <b>the</b> <b>incline</b> in a side channel, in order to supply the lower levels of the canal.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the western}} slope that the Cog Railway ascends is {{straightforward}} from base to summit, the mountain's other sides are more complex. On the north side, Great Gulf—the mountain's largest glacial cirque—forms an amphitheater {{surrounded by the}} Northern Presidentials: Mounts Clay, Jefferson, Adams and Madison. These connected peaks reach well into the treeless alpine zone. Massive Chandler Ridge extends northeast from the summit of Washington to form the amphitheater's southern wall and <b>the</b> <b>incline</b> is ascended by the Mount Washington Auto Road.|$|E

5|$|The final {{gradient}} from Camden Town to Euston {{involved a}} crossing over the Regent's Canal {{that required a}} gradient of over 1 in 68. Because steam trains at the time could not climb such an ascent, they were cable-hauled on the down line towards Camden until 1844, after which they used a pilot engine. The L's Act of Parliament prohibited the use of locomotives in the Euston area, following concerns of local residents about noise and smoke from locomotives toiling up <b>the</b> <b>incline.</b>|$|E

5|$|Though {{sometimes}} productive, no {{nineteenth century}} iron mine on the Brendon Hills was profitable and the venture {{as a whole}} was financially ruinous. Furthermore, the industry {{as a whole was}} prone to boom and bust, with a sharp decline from the early 1880s. The railway continued in operation after the end of mining, although it had lost its primary traffic. A second-hand Robey semi-portable steam engine was installed at the head of <b>the</b> <b>incline</b> to power the drums, hauling wagons up {{in the absence of a}} regular downhill flow.|$|E
