5|$|In 1955 the Howitt {{report on}} the {{development}} of pig production in the United Kingdom was published.

The report initiated a period of decline in all other British pig breeds, including <b>the</b> <b>Large</b> Black. By the time the Rare Breeds Survival Trust was founded 1973, numbers of all traditional pig breeds were dangerously low, and many of them were extinct. <b>The</b> <b>Large</b> Black was placed on the Trust's endangered list.|$|E
