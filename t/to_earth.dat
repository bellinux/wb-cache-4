5|$|On March 19, 2007 the Command and Data Handling {{computer}} {{experienced an}} uncorrectable memory error and rebooted itself, causing the spacecraft {{to go into}} safe mode.

Due to the immense size of the Jupiter system and the relative closeness of the Jovian system <b>to</b> <b>Earth</b> in comparison to the closeness of Pluto <b>to</b> <b>Earth,</b> New Horizons sent back more data <b>to</b> <b>Earth</b> from the Jupiter encounter than the Pluto encounter.|$|E
5|$|Polyakov {{underwent}} medical assessments before, during, {{and after}} the flight. He also underwent two follow-up examinations six months after returning <b>to</b> <b>Earth.</b> When researchers compared {{the results of these}} medical exams, it was revealed that although there were no impairments of cognitive functions, Polyakov experienced a clear decline in mood as well as a feeling of increased workload during the first few weeks of spaceflight and return <b>to</b> <b>Earth.</b> However, Polyakov's mood stabilized to pre-flight levels between the second and fourteenth month of his mission. It was also revealed that Polyakov did not suffer from any prolonged performance impairments after returning <b>to</b> <b>Earth.</b> In light of these findings, researchers concluded that a stable mood and overall function could be maintained during extended duration spaceflights, such as manned missions to Mars.|$|E
