5|$|In November 1992, President Yeltsin {{handed the}} two {{recorder}} containers to Korean President Roh Tae-Woo, {{but not the}} tapes themselves. The following month, the ICAO voted to reopen the KAL007 investigation {{in order to take}} the newly released information into account. The <b>tapes</b> <b>were</b> handed to ICAO in Paris on January 8, 1993. Also handed over at the same time were tapes of the ground to air communications of the Soviet military. The <b>tapes</b> <b>were</b> transcribed by the Bureau d'Enquêtes et d'Analyses pour la sécurité de l'Aviation Civile (BEA) in Paris in the presence of representatives from Japan, The Russian Federation, South Korea, and the United States.|$|E
5|$|The film soundtrack {{has since}} been {{released}} by other companies in different configurations (including complete score releases). The highly regarded master <b>tapes</b> <b>were</b> however damaged during a 1990s remastering, so none of the subsequent re-releases {{are considered to be}} as fine-sounding as the original LP release.|$|E
5|$|The {{tape loops}} were played on BTR3 tape {{machines}} located in various studios of the Abbey Road building {{and controlled by}} EMI technicians in Studio Two at Abbey Road on 7 April. Each machine was monitored by one technician, who had to hold a pencil within each loop to maintain tension. The four Beatles controlled the faders of the mixing console while Martin varied the stereo panning and Emerick watched the meters. Eight of the <b>tapes</b> <b>were</b> used at one time, changed halfway through the song. The <b>tapes</b> <b>were</b> made (like {{most of the other}} loops) by superimposition and acceleration. According to Martin, the finished mix of the tape loops could not be repeated because of the complex and random way in which they were laid over the music.|$|E
50|$|Water-activated <b>tape</b> <b>is</b> {{used for}} closing and sealing boxes. Before closing {{corrugated}} fiberboard boxes, the <b>tape</b> <b>is</b> wetted or remoistened, activated by water. The <b>tape</b> <b>is</b> mostly 3 inches (7.5 cm) wide.|$|R
50|$|Mamie <b>Tape</b> <b>was</b> a Chinese American {{immigrant}} born in San Francisco. Her parents, Joseph Tape (1852-1935), and Mary McGladery <b>Tape</b> (1857-1934), <b>were</b> both {{immigrants from}} China. Joseph <b>Tape</b> <b>was</b> a businessman and an interpreter for the Chinese consulate, while Mary <b>Tape</b> <b>was</b> an amateur photographer and artist.|$|R
5000|$|Drafting <b>tape</b> <b>is</b> nearly {{identical}} to [...] "masking tape" [...] and [...] "painters tape", the main difference <b>is</b> width. Painters <b>tape</b> <b>is</b> the widest, averaging about 2½ inches(approx. 6.4 cm), while masking tape and drafting <b>tape</b> <b>are</b> {{less than half that}} width.|$|R
5|$|The Animaniacs series theme song, {{performed}} by the Warners, {{was a very important}} part of the show. In the series' first season, the theme won an Emmy Award for best song. Stone composed the music for the title sequence and Ruegger wrote the lyrics. Several Animaniacs albums and sing-along VHS <b>tapes</b> <b>were</b> released, including the CDs Animaniacs, Yakko's World, and Variety Pack, and the tapes Animaniacs Sing-Along: Yakko's World and Animaniacs Sing-Along: Mostly in Toon.|$|E
5|$|Two booster <b>tapes</b> <b>were</b> {{released}} {{following the}} success of The Harbingers. The tapes provide a challenging experience to The Harbingers for experienced players. The booster tapes run for forty-five minutes instead of the sixty minutes of the original, and come with a new rule {{to limit the number}} of Keystones added to each province based on the number of players. Other than this limit the normal rules apply.|$|E
5|$|American Idiot is {{the seventh}} studio album by American rock band Green Day. Produced by Rob Cavallo, {{the album was}} {{released}} in the UK on September 20, 2004 and in the US on September 21, 2004 by Reprise Records. Green Day first achieved popularity in the 1990s {{with a string of}} successful albums. Following disappointing sales of their sixth album, Warning (2000), the band took a break before recording their next album, titled Cigarettes and Valentines. The recording process was cut short when the album's master <b>tapes</b> <b>were</b> stolen. Rather than re-record that material, the group decided to start over.|$|E
50|$|Like barbed wire, barbed <b>tape</b> <b>is</b> {{available}} as either straight wire or spiral concertina wire. Unlike barbed wire, which usually {{is available only}} as plain steel or galvanized, barbed <b>tape</b> <b>is</b> also manufactured in stainless steel, to prevent the points from rusting to bluntness. Typically the core wire is galvanized and the <b>tape</b> <b>is</b> stainless, although fully stainless barbed <b>tape</b> <b>is</b> used for expensive permanent installations or under water.|$|R
50|$|Shin <b>tape</b> <b>is</b> a medical-type <b>tape,</b> used on shin pads or socks {{over the}} shin pads {{to help keep}} them in position. The {{pressure-sensitive}} <b>tape</b> <b>is</b> self-adhesive and water resistant, and is elastic {{so that there is}} no risk of cutting off circulation to the legs. Shin <b>tape</b> <b>is</b> available in a variety of colors, with clear tape being the most popular. Shin pad <b>tape</b> <b>is</b> discarded after use.|$|R
50|$|<b>Tapes</b> <b>are</b> an {{effective}} replacement for paints. <b>Tapes</b> <b>are</b> much faster {{and easier to}} install and replace, which dramatically reduces down times related to painting aisles and rails. Many floor <b>tapes</b> <b>are</b> scuff and break resistant, unlike paints that will chip and scratch off. And most of all, <b>tapes</b> <b>are</b> much easier to store and transport; they have much higher shelf lives than paints that, if stored improperly, won't last long.|$|R
5|$|Ferdinand {{had been}} {{involved}} in affairs after marrying Imelda Marcos. Ferdinand's most public affair was with American actress Dovie Beams in 1966. While staying in one of the President's safe houses, she recorded her affair with the President. These <b>tapes</b> <b>were</b> later played in a press conference, causing great humiliation for Imelda. They stayed married through a deal; Imelda had free rein on her projects in exchange for delivering votes for Ferdinand in the second election.|$|E
5|$|In Japan, {{the season}} was {{released}} by Pony Canyon on both DVD and VHS. Six VHS <b>tapes</b> <b>were</b> released between December 18, 1998 and October 20, 1999. Later, six DVDs were released between May 19, 1999 and October 20, 1999. A boxed set was released to Japan on February 20, 2008. For Region 1, {{the season was}} licensed to Geneon Entertainment, under the name Pioneer Entertainment. They released the season to four DVD compilations, each containing 12 episodes, between February and August 2002. Like Pony Canyon, Geneon Entertainment released a limited-edition boxed set of the DVDs on July 1, 2003.|$|E
5|$|In Japan, {{the series}} aired on WOWOW between April 6, 1998 and March 29, 1999. The season was then {{released}} on DVD and VHS by Pony Canyon. Six VHS <b>tapes</b> <b>were</b> released between December 18, 1998 and October 20, 1999, and six DVDs were released between May 19, 1999 and October 20, 1999. A DVD box set {{was released in}} Japan on February 20, 2008. For Region 1, the season was licensed to Pioneer Entertainment (now Geneon Entertainment), and was released between February 12, 2002 and August 13, 2002 in four DVD compilations, each of which contained twelve episodes. Geneon released a limited-edition box set on July 1, 2003.|$|E
50|$|Nowadays masking <b>tapes</b> <b>are</b> {{widely used}} for {{decorative}} purposes. They are printed with different patterns, some Japanese <b>tapes</b> <b>are</b> made of washi paper.|$|R
5000|$|Drip <b>tape</b> <b>is</b> {{a type of}} {{thin walled}} dripperline used in drip irrigation. The first drip <b>tape</b> <b>was</b> known as [...] "Dew Hose".|$|R
50|$|Medical <b>tape</b> <b>is</b> {{useful to}} both prevent and repair minor injuries. For example, <b>tape</b> <b>is</b> {{often used to}} fix flappers. Many climbers use tape to bind fingers or wrists to prevent {{recurring}} tendon problems. <b>Tape</b> <b>is</b> also highly desirable for protecting hands on climbing routes that consist mostly of repeated hand jamming.|$|R
5|$|On Speechless, Frith {{continued}} his exploration of world folk and dance music {{that he had}} begun on Gravity, but unlike Gravity, Speechless included extensive use of found sounds and field recordings. Frith said {{that many of the}} <b>tapes</b> <b>were</b> made while walking the streets of New York City, and include street fairs and demonstrations. Recordings were also made while visiting friends: the title song's rhythm track is provided by a malfunctioning water pipe in Tim Hodgkinson's kitchen.|$|E
5|$|Some of the tele{{recorded}} Pertwee episodes also {{survive on}} NTSC colour videotapes, recorded over-air on consumer hardware. In the early 1990s, an early {{form of the}} Doctor Who Restoration Team attempted to pair the low-resolution colour signal from these sources with the high-resolution black-and-white signal from the black-and-white film recordings. In this way, several Jon Pertwee stories were returned to a rough form of colour: Doctor Who and the Silurians, Terror of the Autons, and The Dæmons. Off-air NTSC colour <b>tapes</b> <b>were</b> also recovered for all of The Ambassadors of Death, but were considered of too poor a quality to permit more than a partial restoration.|$|E
5|$|The DC-9 {{carried a}} {{primitive}} {{flight data recorder}} that recorded basic information about the aircraft's air speed, acceleration, heading, and altitude on metal foil tapes. Additionally, the aircraft was equipped with a simple cockpit voice recorder that recorded all conversations {{that took place in}} the cockpit of the aircraft. The flight recorder was recovered by investigators on Thursday, June 10, 1971, and sent to Washington D.C. for analysis. Though the voice recorder was also recovered, the thermal protective measures had failed and the recording <b>tapes</b> <b>were</b> destroyed by fire.|$|E
5000|$|Son of Dungeon <b>Tape</b> <b>is</b> a {{cassette}} <b>tape</b> by Australian folk rock group The Triffids. [...] This <b>tape</b> <b>was</b> only {{sold at the}} Triffids’ performances in early 1988. The <b>tape</b> <b>was</b> not simply a re-issue of the original Dungeon Tape with only five of the original tracks making it on to this compilation tape.|$|R
50|$|Although gaffer <b>tape</b> <b>is</b> used {{within the}} film/TV Industry {{as a strong}} cloth-backed {{adhesive}} tape, many other types of <b>tape</b> <b>are</b> also used, such as paper tape, pressure-sensitive tape (A.K.A. snot tape), electrical tape, J-LAR, and cloth <b>tape.</b> Gaffer <b>tape</b> <b>is</b> typically utilized by set lighting technicians under the supervision of, and not directly by, a gaffer.|$|R
50|$|Dungeon <b>Tape</b> <b>is</b> a {{cassette}} <b>tape</b> by Australian folk rock group The Triffids. This <b>tape</b> <b>was</b> only {{sold at the}} group's performances in the eastern states of Australia in 1983. The <b>tape</b> <b>was</b> recorded on 12 April 1981 at Dungeon Rehearsal Studios, Palmer Street, Sydney, except the last four tracks which were recorded at Mutant Mule Studios, Perth in December 1981.|$|R
5|$|The <b>tapes</b> <b>were</b> {{originally}} {{described as}} having been recorded {{in the spring of}} 1962, an attempt to pre-date The Beatles' June 1962 contract signing with Parlophone. However, song arrangements and dialogue from the tapes pointed to late December 1962, and a recording date of 31 December 1962 (the group's last day in Hamburg) was commonly cited. Later researchers have proposed that the tapes are from multiple days during the last week of December; Allan Williams (The Beatles' booking agent at the time) recalled that a total of about three hours was recorded over three or four sessions between Christmas and New Year's Day.|$|E
5|$|Voice-recording {{sessions}} were supervised by Pattillo and the Andersons, with Sylvia Anderson {{in charge of}} casting. Dialogue was recorded once per month {{at a rate of}} two scripts per session. Supporting parts were not pre-assigned, but negotiated by the cast among themselves. Two recordings would be made at each session: one to be converted into electronic pulses for the puppet filming, the other {{to be added to the}} soundtrack during post-production. The <b>tapes</b> <b>were</b> edited at Gate Recording Theatre in Birmingham.|$|E
5|$|On 26 May 2017, {{the album}} was reissued for the album's 50th anniversary in four {{different}} formats: a single CD, a double CD set, a double vinyl set and a six-disc super deluxe edition. The first CD contains a new stereo remix of the album produced by Giles Martin. Created using modern and vintage technology, the 2017 mix retains more of the idiosyncrasies that were unique to the original mono version of Sgt. Pepper's. Unlike the original album, first-generation <b>tapes</b> <b>were</b> used rather than their subsequent mixdowns, resulting in a clearer and more spacious sound. The other discs contain alternative mixes and previously unreleased session tapes. The six-disc box set includes four CDs {{as well as a}} documentary and 5.1 surround sound mixes of the album in both DVD and Blu-ray form.|$|E
50|$|Several of {{the final}} mixes on DAT format were almost lost when the <b>tape</b> <b>was</b> mangled badly. That <b>tape</b> <b>was</b> {{successfully}} repaired allowing recovery of the mixes for this record.|$|R
30|$|Adhesive Scotch <b>tape</b> <b>was</b> {{placed on}} the surface of the {{honeycomb}} films in order to remove the top portion of the polymer thin film. The surface of the <b>tape</b> <b>was</b> rubbed smoothly with the thumb to ensure full contact with the top layer of the honeycomb film without trapped air. Then, the <b>tape</b> <b>was</b> peeled off slowly. The prepared nano-needle arrays were brought into analysis and stamping.|$|R
50|$|Magnetic <b>tape</b> <b>is</b> {{a medium}} for {{magnetic}} recording, made of a thin, magnetizable coating on a long, narrow strip of plastic film. It was developed in Germany, based on magnetic wire recording. Devices that record and play back audio and video using magnetic <b>tape</b> <b>are</b> <b>tape</b> recorders and video tape recorders. A device that stores computer data on magnetic <b>tape</b> <b>is</b> a <b>tape</b> drive (tape unit, streamer).|$|R
5|$|The {{facility}} had a Simulation for Automatic Machinery computer {{built by}} FFI which allowed for real-time operations with the data. Telecommunications systems were {{operated by the}} Norwegian Telecommunications Administration, which established a two-way radio station at Ny-Ålesund. Communication from the satellites was relayed by radio to Ski and onwards with a leased line to the European Space Operations Centre in Darmstadt, Germany. Return information was relayed via a radio station at Jeløy. Magnetic <b>tapes</b> <b>were</b> sent to Darmstadt every other week, first via aircraft to Longyearbyen and then onwards to Germany. NTNF hired a nurse and had the Amundsen House refitted as a clinic {{for the duration of}} the telemetry station's operation.|$|E
5|$|In May 2005, {{opposition}} MP Gurmant Grewal accused Dosanjh and the Prime Minister's Chief of Staff, Tim Murphy, {{of attempting}} to bribe him with an ambassadorship and a senate seat for his wife, Nina Grewal, if he would cross the floor or abstain from a crucial upcoming vote. Grewal released tapes he secretly recorded of the conversation between Dosanjh, Grewal, and Murphy. Dosanjh claimed innocence and accused Grewal of altering the tapes to imply wrongdoing and the Prime Minister dismissed calls to remove Dosanjh from cabinet. Audio analysis concluded that the <b>tapes</b> <b>were</b> altered and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police did not pursue any criminal investigations. Nevertheless, fellow MP John Reynolds {{filed a complaint with}} the Law Society of British Columbia accusing Dosanjh of violating the Criminal Code and the society's Professional Conduct Handbook. The Law Society reviewed the affair and concluded that Grewal had attempted to elicit rewards for his compliance but cleared Dosanjh and Murphy of misconduct charges.|$|E
5|$|The {{instrumentation}} included ten smoked paper analog seismometers {{that were}} configured {{to allow for}} 48 hours of continuous single-component data recording. Six digital recorders built by the Institut de Physique du Globe de Strasbourg were also used to record signals from three-component seismometers. Eight of the selected sites were equipped with a vertical component velocity transducer along with an FM telemetry link to transfer data back to a central station where a three-component unit was stationed. There the seismic signals were digitized, along with an internal time signal and an external DCF77 time signal, and stored on magnetic tape. The <b>tapes</b> <b>were</b> then played back and the P-wave and S-wave arrival times were used to automatically determine aftershock locations. Approximately two hundred aftershocks were recorded each day for the first several days of the expedition {{and at the end}} of the recording period in February the equipment was still picking up around 100 shocks per day. The team then set out to determine an accurate velocity model using data from the more accurate telemetry network. The soviet geophysicists detonated 100 kilograms of TNT in a hole drilled near the mainshock epicenter and the resulting shock waves were detected and used to help pinpoint a more accurate crustal velocity value of 5.3 to 5.4km/s.|$|E
50|$|Hazard <b>Tape</b> - <b>is</b> used in {{locations}} {{containing a}} substantial danger. Examples include electrocution hazards or areas within {{which there is}} a risk of exposure to toxic chemicals. Hazard <b>tape</b> <b>is</b> available in different color combinations, each of which indicates certain classes of threat. For example, yellow-black <b>tape</b> <b>is</b> used to signal the presence of a physical hazard (e.g., a hole), while magenta-yellow denotes a radiation hazard. This type of barrier <b>tape</b> <b>is</b> commonly used in laboratories, production areas, and industrial zones.|$|R
5000|$|Gorilla <b>Tape</b> <b>is</b> a {{brand of}} {{adhesive}} tape sold by Sharonville, Ohio based Gorilla Glue Inc. Introduced in late 2005, Gorilla <b>Tape</b> <b>is</b> a reinforced form of duct <b>tape</b> and <b>was</b> featured in Popular Sciences [...] "Best of What's New 2006". [...] Gorilla <b>Tape</b> <b>is</b> available in several sizes and colors, including camouflage, white and clear. In 2013, The Gorilla Glue Company launched an advertising campaign which brings the Gorilla mascot to life, as {{he comes to the}} aid of a hapless Do-it-Yourselfer.|$|R
50|$|Precision {{diameter}} <b>tapes</b> <b>are</b> {{used for}} measuring the true diameters of both round and out-of-round forms. Used in the metal working industry, these <b>tapes</b> <b>are</b> precision tools made of 1095 clock spring steel.|$|R
