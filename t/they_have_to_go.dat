25|$|At {{the start}} of Dreamscape players are given a diary, in {{which most of the}} pages are empty except for titles at the top of each page. The titles {{themselves}} are named after all the locations that can be visited throughout the game world, and as such players can use this to work out where <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to next. As the story processes the pages of the diary slowly fill up, giving extra information about the locations found in the game. It also provides back story to not only the main character, Wilson, but to the other characters as well. The diary also contains a map, which is designed to help players navigate the thirty acre world.|$|E
25|$|Students that {{attend a}} nursing college {{or just a}} nursing school receive the same degree that one would who {{graduated}} from a nursing university, {{but they do not}} have the same educational background. The classes offered at nursing colleges and nursing schools are focused on more practical aspects of nursing. These institutions do not offer many general education classes, so students who attend these schools will solely be focusing on their nursing educations while they are in school. Students who attend a nursing college or school do have the opportunity to become a midwife or a public health nurse. <b>They</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> through a training institute for their desired field after graduating from the nursing school or college. Japanese nurses never have to renew their licenses. Once they have passed their exam, they have their license for life.|$|E

Their father had last seen Charles Wallace {{when he was a}} baby and Calvin had only just met him. They each give her a gift. Mrs Whatsit gives Meg her love. Mrs Who quotes to Meg a passage from the Bible about God {{choosing}} the foolish of the world to confound the wise, and the weak to defeat the strong (1st Corinthians 1:27-29). Mrs Which tells Meg that she has one thing that IT does not have. Upon arriving at the building where IT is housed, Charles Wallace is still there under IT's influence. Meg realizes that the one thing she has that IT does not is love. She focuses all her love at Charles Wallace and is able to free him from IT's control. Mrs Who, Mrs Which and Mrs Whatsit tesser the Murrys and Calvin back to Earth. In the vegetable garden they are reunited with Mrs. Murry and the twins.

[...] On March 1, 2008, John Sweeney remembered Lonsdale and spoke about him on the BBC Radio 4 program, From Our Own Correspondent. Sweeney stated: [...] "Clearwater got that little bit more creepy recently, with the death - the police are treating it as suicide - of Shawn.

500|$|Allegations of sexism {{occurred}} {{following a}} statement by Lino DiSalvo, the film's head of animation, who said to Fan Voice's Jenna Busch: [...] "Historically speaking, animating female characters are really, really difficult, because <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> through these range of emotions, {{but you have to}} keep them pretty." [...] However, a Disney spokesperson later told Time that DiSalvo's quote was widely misinterpreted, stating that he was [...] "describing some technical aspects of CG animation and not making a general comment on animating females versus males or other characters." [...] Director Lee also said that DiSalvo's words were recklessly taken out of context, and that he was talking in very technical terms about CG animation. [...] "It is hard no matter what the gender is. I felt horrible for him," [...] she said. In an August 2014 interview, DiSalvo re-emphasized what he had been trying to explain all along when his statements were taken out of contextâ€“ the difficulty with turning any kind of animated character from a series of sketches on a 2D emotion model sheet into a properly rigged 3D character model: [...] "Translating that emotional range onto a CG character {{is one of the most}} difficult parts of the process. Male. Female. Snowman. Animal." [...] He added, [...] "The really sad thing is people took that... catchy headline and they just repopulated it everywhere. People didn't get back to me for comments and the sad thing is that's the way the internet works. They don't want the truth." ...|$|E

2500|$|For example, {{psychologist}} Robert Kegan {{developed a}} theoretical framework that posited five levels of meaning-making; each level described a more advanced way of understanding experiences that persons may come to master as they develop psychologically. Similarly, according to the transformative learning theory of sociologist and educator Jack Mezirow, adults interpret the meaning of their experiences through a lens of deeply held assumptions. When they experience something that contradicts or challenges their way of negotiating the world <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> through the transformative process of evaluating their assumptions and processes of making meaning. Experiences that force individuals to engage in this critical self-reflection, or what Mezirow called [...] "disorienting dilemmas", can be events such as loss, trauma, stressful life transitions or other interruptions.|$|E

2500|$|In the United States Coast Guard and United States Coast Guard Auxiliary, the coxswain has the {{authority}} to direct all boat and crew activities during the mission and modify planned missions to provide {{for the safety of the}} boat and the crew. [...] Before a person can be assigned to be a coxswain, <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> through a qualification procedure, be certified and maintain the certification to be a coxswain. Upon certification, they are awarded the Coxswain Badge. [...] This qualification procedure requires a significant amount of practice in boat handling as well as previous experience as a boat crew member. Any Coast Guardsman (enlisted or officer) may become a coxswain upon proper qualification. An advancement to boatswain's mate second class requires that the individual qualify as and maintain certification as a coxswain. A commanding officer or officer in charge of a land based unit with boats has to be certified and stay certified as a coxswain on all boats in the unit or be relieved of command. A coxswain is assigned to a boat by the command authority and can only be relieved by the commanding officer/Officer in Charge, executive officer/Executive Petty Officer, or senior officer present. The coxswainâ€™s authority is independent of rank and/or seniority in relation to any other person on board the boat. Unlike the commanding officer of a cutter or ship, a coxswain does not automatically have command authority.|$|E
2500|$|By July 2015, Madonna {{was still}} working on the set list with her team of {{creative}} directors, producers, designers and choreographers. She described the tour as [...] "characteristically theatrical spectacle" [...] and would include songs from her whole career. However, picking the set list was hard since the singer wanted to perform the Rebel Heart songs {{as well as her}} previous discography, in order to satisfy all her fans. She found the task challenging since [...] "thematically the songsâ€”the old and the newâ€”they have to go together; sonically <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> together." [...] The romantic and party theme of the show was an expansion of the name Rebel Heart, representing a journey with her personal statements and opinions. Love and romance were listed as the central theme of the show, with Madonna wanting the audience to feel inspired once they watch it. Along with it, she juxtaposed opposite ideas of sexuality and religion, saying that [...] "I'm very immersed in [...] not supposed to go together, but in my world it goes together". Inspirations for Rebel Heart Tour also came from shows like Cirque du Soleil and the Chinese New Year, as well as films like 300 and Grease. Jamie King esd the creative director for the show, while Megan Lawson and Jason Young choreographed the 20 dancers through intricate acrobatic dance steps. According to Madonna, since she started out as a dancer, for the tour she tried to find [...] "unique and original dancers to work with" [...] and create content and dance-forms that would inspire the audience.|$|E
