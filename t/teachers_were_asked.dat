50|$|School {{and country}} {{contexts}} highly influence students’ initial abilities to form deep questions. In the developing world, many teachers lack adequate teacher training. Their training is often limited to content, rather than pedagogical practices. In some cases, when <b>teachers</b> <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> to use new technology {{before they were}} comfortable with it, their discomfort led them to stifle students’ questions. Cultural norms governing relations between adults and students, and socialization into situational authority roles, may also inhibit student questioning.|$|E

Students and <b>teachers</b> <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> to fill in a questionnaire about how they feel in the building while environmental parameters, such as temperatures, humidity and air velocity, were collected. The main conclusion is that out of 700 students surveyed, the vast majority feel comfortable in ENERPOS in the hot season without any air conditioning.

50|$|Even while {{attending}} Teachers College, DuBois' {{work with the}} Woodbury Plan continued. A number of schools were interested in implementing the plan into their curricula, and to manage all the requests, the Service Bureau for Human Relations was formed, with DuBois as the director. Around the same time, the organization recognized that educating fellow teachers was nearly as important as educating students. Thus, the Service Bureau began offering courses for the educators at all the schools where they operated. In 1933, DuBois was invited to teach a course on the subject at Boston University. Over the next several years, the Service Bureau led workshops on intercultural education at conferences and universities, including a groundbreaking workshop at Sarah Lawrence. At this workshop, <b>teachers</b> <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> to share their classroom problems within small groups and then talk together to find solutions. Elements of intercultural education were woven throughout the workshop.|$|E
50|$|Traditionally, the {{education}} of the children of a Jewish family rested with the father. However, the absence of many fathers due to their frequently being away from home in their capacity as traders, made it necessary to employ travelling teachers who received food and accommodation in return for their services. These teachers, called chedarim, received a contract of six months, usually terminating at either Pesach or Sukkot. In 1808, the number of Jewish children amounted to 39 which indicates that many children were sent to either Christian schools or to Jewish schools outside Laupheim. The first Jewish school was founded only in 1823, when the Jewish community rented a ballroom in a public house {{to be used as a}} classroom and hired a teacher, Simon Tannenbaum from Mergentheim. He acted as head teacher until his retirement in 1860. As his assistant Abraham Sänger from Buttenhausen was taken on and worked as teacher until his death in 1856. His descendants run the public house Zum Ochsen until after 1933. In 1830, the Jewish community bought a house opposite the synagogue which was refurbished to house the rabbi's office and the school. This building functioned as school until 1868 when a new Jewish school was built in the vicinity of the Judenberg in the Radgasse. This building was demolished in 1969. Due to the lack of Jewish teachers, for several years Roman Catholic <b>teachers</b> <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> to help out. In 1874, 162 Jewish pupils attended the Jewish school. In the following decades, the number of Jewish pupils would decrease continuously, so that, at the beginning of the 20th century, the Jewish school taught only 65 pupils. However, the Jewish school existed until well into the 1930s and was only closed in 1939.|$|E
5000|$|Rosie Gulliver (portrayed by Sarah Solemani) - Rosie is {{the biology}} teacher and former interim Deputy Headteacher at Abbey Grove School. She was openly {{bisexual}} {{and was one}} of the few teachers who took pride when inspiring and teaching her students. She was passionate about charity work, animal rights, human rights, feminism, and the struggles of people with disabilities. When <b>teachers</b> <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> to do a sexual education class, she was the only one who lead an honest discussion of human sexuality, which inspired one of her students to come out, and showed acceptance and patience of the changes that the students were going through. When mistakenly believing Alfie was sexually abused by a teacher at Middleton House when he attended it, she urged him to accept that he was a victim and speak for all those who have had their [...] "voices silenced". In [...] "Funeral", Fraser asked her to become interim Deputy Headteacher, and, to Alfie's alarm, began to develop similarities to Pickwell's dictatorial style. Her tenure ended with the appointment of Professor Green in [...] "Valentine's Day". At the beginning of Series 1, she broke up with her old boyfriend, stating she was too [...] "physical" [...] for him. At first, she found Alfie callow and did not share his feelings for her, though over time she warmed to him. At the school dance in the finale of Series 1, she compared him to a student who really frustrates her, but has potential and is [...] "perfect" [...] after all, and kissed him in front of most of the student body. In the second series, however, Alfie is upset to learn that they are not together, and that she has formed a same-sex relationship with her former student, Alex Scott. In the fourth episode of the second series, this relationship comes to an end, and Rosie's feelings for Alfie return. She got a job offer in Soweto in the final episode of Series 2, but decided to decline it when Alfie declared his feelings for her, and she returned them. They shared another kiss. By the beginning of Series 3, they were living together, but she moved out after Alfie wrongly accused her of cheating. She refused to acknowledge the status of their relationship until [...] "Prom", when the thought that Alfie would no longer be around showed her that she still cared deeply about him.|$|E
