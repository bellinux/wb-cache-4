25|$|Later that year, {{following}} {{the example of}} a friend Joe Wallace (Jason Rush) who had told his parents about being gay and HIV-positive, Mark decides to tell his parents. By now, he is dating Rachel Kominski (Jacquetta May), who advises him not to but Mark is tired of the pretence. On Boxing Day Mark tells Pauline and Arthur that he is HIV-positive. <b>They</b> <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> stunned silence while he scatters helpful leaflets around the house and then goes away for a while. On his return, he faces Pauline's irrational terror and Arthur's hostility. Arthur's ignorance is apparent initially as he fears that Mark will pass HIV on to him; he even bleaches everything Mark touches to avoid infection. Pauline and Michelle Fowler (Susan Tully) are understandably distraught but help Arthur to understand the illness, and are a huge support to Mark. Mark's relationship with Rachel ends, and the animosity at home send Mark back to his girlfriend Gill, who moves to London and becomes seriously ill. Gill's HIV has already progressed into AIDS and her deterioration is rapid. She is diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and goes into a hospice. Mark realises that he is in love with her and asks her to marry him. Mark and Gill marry, and their honeymoon consists of one night in a hotel, before Gill returns to the hospice and dies.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{opens in}} medias res in 1989, when a SWAT team conducts {{a raid on}} a Baltimore warehouse. Inside, they find a naked and disoriented Fox Mulder in a box, shouting, [...] "They're here!" [...] Three men attempt to flee the scene and are captured; they are {{revealed}} to be the Lone Gunmen. As <b>they</b> <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> a city jail, they begin blaming {{each other for the}} predicament they have found themselves in. Detective John Munch interrogates John Fitzgerald Byers, who tries to explain what happened.|$|E
500|$|... "Freddy Spaghetti" [...] was {{the final}} episode to include Paul Schneider in any {{capacity}} after his two seasons as regular cast member as Mark Brendanawicz. Schneider left the series, and though Schur claimed that both the producers and Schneider were interested in having him return for guest appearances in future episodes, Schneider stated {{that he was not}} interested in returning and had never been contacted about it. The final scene between Leslie and Mark in [...] "Freddy Spaghetti", in which the two sit together at Lot 48, mirrors their scenes together in the first season finale, [...] "Rock Show", in which the two shared a kiss while overlooking the lot while it was still a construction pit. Schur said of the scene, [...] "It's great because Leslie and Mark, it was such a disastrous moment last time (at the pit) and he didn't really respect her, and a lot's happened in a year." [...] Goor said of using that setting, [...] "I liked the symmetry of having it play a critical, and opposite role in this finale. Last year, they sat on the bench and kissed, and it seemed like they might be getting back together. This year, they sat on the bench and Mark kissed Leslie goodbye." [...] The bench <b>they</b> <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> during that scene is the same one they sat on during their kiss scene in [...] "Rock Show". Throughout the second season, that bench was in Leslie's office. Schur said, [...] "We decided that in the reality of the show she brought it to the lot for this moment. It's {{a little bit of a}} stretch, but, you know." ...|$|E

60|$|Now the master-at-arms, {{assisted}} by his mates, the ship's corporals, reigns supreme in these {{bowels of the}} ship.

60|$|I {{know quite}} a lot of men who have {{actually}} bought the new Encyclopaedia Britannica.

Other men spend their time reading the Statistical Abstract of the United States (they say the figures in it are great) and the Acts of Congress, and the list of Presidents since Washington (or was it Washington?).|$|E
60|$|They {{are very}} uncleanly--these people--in face, {{in person and}} dress. When they see any body with a clean shirt on, it arouses their scorn. The women wash clothes, half the day, at the public tanks in the streets, but they are {{probably}} somebody else's. Or may be they keep one set to wear and another to wash; because they never put on any that have ever been washed. When they get done washing, <b>they</b> <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> the alleys and nurse their cubs. They nurse one ash-cat at a time, and the others scratch their backs against the door-post and are happy.|$|E

Cuthbertson quickly takes his chair and places it behind Paramore, who sinks into it as they crowd about him, Craven at his right shoulder, Cuthbertson on his left, and Julia behind Craven.) ...|$|E
6000|$|She had sense {{enough to}} feel that with such lovemaking as that {{between her and her}} lover there should be no kissing till after marriage; or at any rate, no kissing of hands, as is done between {{handsome}} young men of twenty-three and beautiful young ladies of eighteen, when <b>they</b> <b>sit</b> <b>in</b> balconies on moonlight nights. A good honest kiss, mouth to mouth, might not be amiss when matters were altogether settled; but when she thought of this, she thought also of his eye and shuddered. His eye was not his fault, and a man should not be left all his days without a wife because he squints; but still, was it possible? could she bring herself to endure it? ...|$|E
