5|$|Diệm {{responded to}} the {{controversy}} of the chemicals by agreeing to formal talks with <b>the</b> <b>Buddhist</b> leaders. He appointed a three-member Interministerial Committee, which comprised Vice President Nguyễn Ngọc Thơ as chairman, Thuan and Interior Minister Bui Van Luong. Despite continuing protests, including public self-immolations by monks such as Thích Quảng Đức, a Joint Communique resulting from the discussions was signed in mid-June, which promised to end <b>the</b> <b>Buddhist</b> crisis.|$|E

5|$|In 1963, the Diệm regime {{began to}} lose its tight control over the country as civil unrest spread {{as a result of}} <b>the</b> <b>Buddhist</b> crisis. Large scale demonstrations by <b>the</b> <b>Buddhist</b> {{majority}} erupted in response to the government shootings of nine Buddhists in Huế who were protesting against a ban on the flying of <b>the</b> <b>Buddhist</b> flag during Vesak, the birthday of Gautama Buddha. With Diệm remaining intransigent in the face of Buddhist demands for religious equality, sections of society began calling for his removal from power. Thảo was part of the many plots that engulfed Saigon, destabilising the regime. Aiming for a 15 July coup, Tuyến consulted with Thảo regarding his plans, but Tuyến was too closely associated with Nhu to recruit the necessary military aid and he was subsequently exiled by Nhu.|$|E
25|$|In 1989 {{there was}} a social boycott by <b>the</b> <b>Buddhists</b> of <b>the</b> Muslims of Leh district. The boycott {{remained}} in force till 1992.

25|$|In July, Diệm's {{government}} {{continued to}} attack <b>the</b> <b>Buddhists.</b> It accused Thích Quảng Đức {{of having been}} drugged before being set alight.

5|$|Like the Jaina {{versions}} of the Krishna legends, <b>the</b> <b>Buddhist</b> versions such as one in Ghata Jataka follow the general outline of the story, but {{are different from the}} Hindu versions as well. For example, <b>the</b> <b>Buddhist</b> legend describes Devagabbha (Devaki) to have been isolated in a palace built upon a pole, after she is born, so no future husband could reach her. Krishna's father similarly is described as a powerful king, but who meets up with Devagabbha anyway, and to whom Kamsa gives away his sister Devagabbha in marriage. The siblings of Krishna are not killed by Kamsa, though he tries. In <b>the</b> <b>Buddhist</b> version of the legend, all of Krishna's siblings grow to maturity.|$|E

5|$|Neither the Ngô family nor <b>the</b> <b>Buddhists</b> {{were happy}} with the agreement, however, and it failed to solve the dispute. Both sides accused the other of failing to uphold their obligations; the {{government}} accused <b>the</b> <b>Buddhists</b> of continuing to vilify them in demonstrations, while <b>the</b> <b>Buddhists</b> accused Diệm of stalling and not acting on his commitments to religious reform, and continuing to detain arrested <b>Buddhist</b> dissidents. <b>The</b> demonstrations and tension continued throughout July and August, with more self-immolations and an altercation (known as the Double Seven Day scuffle) between secret police and American journalists reporting on a Buddhist protest.|$|R

5|$|As Diệm had {{strongly}} discriminated along religious lines, the rebels' commented {{caused a}} negative response among <b>the</b> <b>Buddhist</b> majority. <b>The</b> <b>Buddhist</b> activist monk Thich Tam Chau called on Buddhists {{to support the}} incumbent junta. The pro-Diệm speeches also alarmed pro-Buddhist and anti-Diệm generals, such as Nguyễn Chánh Thi and Nguyễn Hữu Có, who {{had been part of}} the failed 1960 and successful 1963 coups against Diệm respectively. They thought that Thảo and Phat might seek revenge, driving many anti-Diệm officers who may have otherwise been neutral or sympathetic to the coup, to swing more towards Khánh.|$|E
5|$|As Diệm had {{strongly}} discriminated {{in favor}} of minority Catholics and placed restrictions on Buddhism, the rebels' radio addresses caused an unsurprisingly negative response among <b>the</b> <b>Buddhist</b> majority. <b>The</b> <b>Buddhist</b> activist monk Thich Tam Chau spoke from a radio station in Nha Trang, exhorting his co-religionists to support the incumbent junta. The Diemist speeches also alarmed pro-Buddhist or anti-Diệm generals, such as Thi and Có, who {{had been part of}} the failed 1960 and successful 1963 coups against Diệm respectively, and feared retribution from Thảo and Phát. The speeches drove many anti-Diệm officers who may have otherwise been neutral or sympathetic to the coup, to swing more towards Khánh.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} the Commercial Import Program (CIP) {{appeared}} to be working successfully and North Vietnam had not decided to attack the South after Diệm had canceled the planned 1956 reunification elections. The glowing press coverage of the period contrasted {{to that of the}} later decades of the 1960s and 1970s, in which the American media engaged in investigative journalism that undermined the official line presented by Washington in relation to Vietnam. This was particularly true during Diệm's downfall in 1963. Journalists such as David Halberstam, Malcolm Browne and Neil Sheehan all won Pulitzer Prizes for their work on <b>the</b> <b>Buddhist</b> crisis, in which mass protests erupted after years of discrimination against <b>the</b> <b>Buddhist</b> majority.|$|E

5|$|Buddhist discontent erupted {{following}} a ban in early May on flying <b>the</b> <b>Buddhist</b> flag in Huế on Vesak, {{the birthday of}} Gautama Buddha. Just days before, Catholics had been encouraged to fly the Vatican flag at a celebration for Archbishop Ngô Đình Thục of Huế, Diệm's elder brother. A large crowd of Buddhists protested the ban, defying the government by flying Buddhist flags on <b>the</b> <b>Buddhist</b> holy day of Vesak and marching on the government broadcasting station. Government forces fired into the crowd of protesters, killing nine people. Diệm's refusal to take responsibility — he blamed the Viet Cong for the deaths — led to further Buddhist protests and calls for religious equality. As Diem remained unwilling to comply with Buddhist demands, the frequency of protests increased.|$|E

The US began to lose confidence in Diệm's ability to run the country effectively and prevent {{the growth of the}} communist insurgency, and concluded that he was an obstacle to religious and thus national stability. During this time, the American press corps wrote unvarnished stories about the South Vietnamese government's policies and actions, in contrast to the supportive pieces of the 1950s, and Diệm's attempt to physically intimidate correspondents backfired. After Diệm tried to settle <b>the</b> <b>Buddhist</b> crisis by launching synchronized raids on Buddhist temples across the country to round up those monks who were leading protests against him, the Americans began to look for alternative leadership, sending Cable 243 to their embassy in Saigon to authorise the search for someone to replace Diệm. In November 1963, Diệm was overthrown in a US-backed coup and he and Nhu were captured and executed.|$|E
