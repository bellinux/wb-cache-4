50|$|The natural {{frequencies}} of <b>thermowell</b> bending modes are {{dependent upon the}} dimensions of the <b>thermowell,</b> the compliance (or flexibility) of its support, {{and to a lesser extent}} dependent upon the mass of the sensor and the added mass of the fluid surrounding the <b>thermowell.</b>|$|E
5000|$|To be {{representative}} of the average temperature of fluid, the <b>thermowell</b> must extend a few per cent of the inside diameter of the process pipe or vessel (Normally 1/3 rd of the pipe inside diameter). A rule of thumb that is sufficient for most industrial applications (approximately 1% accuracy) is to ensure that the <b>thermowell</b> projects 5 times its own diameter into the process plus the length of its sensing element. So, for a grounded thermocouple spring-loaded into a <b>thermowell</b> with a 1-inch-diameter shank and a tip thickness of [...]25 inch, a typical immersion length would equal 5.5 inches (1 inch OD x 5 + [...]25 inch well tip thickness +.25 inch sensor wall thickness = 5.5 inches). A <b>thermowell</b> is typically machined from solid bar stock and gun-drilled to ensure a long straight bore that closely approximates the diameter of the installed sensor (ex: a [...]260-inch bore matching a [...]250-inch sensor). A <b>thermowell</b> is typically mounted into the process stream by way of a threaded, welded, sanitary cap or flanged process connection.

50|$|Thermowells are {{typically}} installed in piping systems {{and subject to}} both hydrostatic and aerodynamic forces. Vortex shedding is the dominant concern for thermowells in cross-flow applications and is capable of forcing the <b>thermowell</b> into resonance {{with the possibility of}} fatigue failure not only of the <b>thermowell</b> but also of the temperature sensor. The conditions for flow-induced resonance generally govern the design of the <b>thermowell</b> apart from its pressure rating and materials of construction. Flow-induced motion of the <b>thermowell</b> occurs both in-line with and transverse to the direction of flow with the fluid forces acting to bend the <b>thermowell.</b> In many applications the transverse component of the fluid forces resulting from vortex shedding tends to govern the onset of flow-induced resonance, with a forcing frequency equal to the vortex shedding rate. In liquids and in high-pressure compressible fluids, a smaller but nonetheless significant component of motion in the flow-direction is also present and occurs at nearly twice the vortex shedding rate. The in-line resonance condition may govern <b>thermowell</b> design at high fluid velocities although its amplitude {{is a function of the}} mass-damping parameter or Scruton number describing the thermowell-fluid interaction.|$|E

50|$|Thermowells are tubular {{fittings}} used {{to protect}} temperature sensors installed in industrial processes. A <b>thermowell</b> consists of a tube closed {{at one end and}} mounted in the process stream.

Thermodynamically, the process fluid transfers heat to the <b>thermowell</b> wall, which in turn transfers heat to the sensor. Since more mass is present with a sensor-well assembly than with a probe directly immersed into the process, the sensor's response to process temperature changes is slowed by the addition of the well. If the sensor fails, it can be easily replaced without draining the vessel or piping. Since the mass of the <b>thermowell</b> must be heated to the process temperature, and since the walls of the <b>thermowell</b> conduct heat out of the process, sensor accuracy and responsiveness is negatively impacted by the addition of a <b>thermowell.</b>|$|E

In less demanding services, fatigue failure is more gradual and often preceded by a series sensor failures.

40|$|Tutorialpg. 189 - 212 In large {{diameter}} piping, high-frequency energy {{can produce}} excessive noise and vibration, and failures of <b>thermowells,</b> instrumentation, and attached small-bore piping. In severe cases, the pipe itself can fracture. Perhaps more precisely called "high wave number" problems, these problems most often manifest themselves in centrifugal compressors, screw compressors, heat exchangers, and silencers. Two high-frequency energy generation mechanisms predominate in most industrial processes; flow induced (vortex 189 shedding) and pulsation at multiples of running speed (blade-pass in centrifugal compressors and pocket-passing frequency in screw compressors). Once this energy is generated, amplification may occur from acoustical and/or structural resonances, resulting in high amplitude vibration and noise. To resolve these problems successfully, {{an understanding of}} the underlying physics of two- and three-dimensional acoustics is necessary. With these principles in mind, modifications to the piping system can be considered for the particular application. The three-dimensional wave equation is used to analyze the propagation of the high-order (cross-wall) acoustical modes in the duct or pipe. These cross-wall modes can be diametrical (m) modes, annular (n) modes, or combined (m, n) modes. By reformulating the resulting differential equations into polar coordinates and applying the appropriate boundary conditions, an equation for the "cut-on" frequencies,/ (m,n) ? for cross-wall modes can be developed that incorporates zeroes of the first order Bessel function, f 3 (m,n) ? the speed of sound, and pipe diameter. Several references provide lists of the zeroes of the Bessel function; however, most of these references only provide solutions up to m, n = 6. Field tests have identified cross-wall modes up to m = 30. Therefore, a table is provided for zeros of f 3 (m,n) for m= 0 to 32 and n = 0 to 8. This paper discusses the excitation and amplification mechanisms relevant to high-frequency energy generation in piping systems. Mechanisms that allow efficient coupling of this energy with the surroundings (either structural or acoustical) are discussed.

40|$|Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) {{performed}} pilot-scale hydraulic/chemical {{testing of}} spherical resorcinol formaldehyde (RF) ion exchange (IX) resin for the River Protection Project Hanford Tank Waste Treatment & Immobilization Plant (WTP) Project. The RF resin cycle testing {{was conducted in}} two pilot-scale IX columns, 1 / 4 and 1 / 2 scale. A total of twenty-three hydraulic/chemical cycles were successfully completed on the spherical RF resin. Seven of the cycles were completed in the 12 -inch IX Column and sixteen cycles were completed in the 24 -inch IX Column. Hydraulic testing showed that the permeability of the RF resin remained essentially constant, with no observed trend in {{the reduction of the}} permeability as the number of cycles increased. The permeability during the pilot-scale testing was 2 1 / 2 times better than the design requirements of the WTP full-scale system. The permeability of the resin bed was uniform with respect to changes in bed depth. Upflow Regeneration and Simulant Introduction in the IX columns revealed another RF resin benefit; negligible radial pressures to the column walls from the swelling of resin beads. In downflow of the Regeneration and Simulant Introduction steps, the resin bed particles pack tightly together and produce higher hydraulic pressures than that found in upflow. Also, upflow Simulant Introduction produced an ideal level bed for the twenty cycles completed using upflow Simulant Introduction. Conversely, the three cycles conducted using downflow Simulant Introduction produced an uneven bed surface with erosion around the <b>thermowells.</b> The RF resin bed in both columns showed no tendency to form fissures or pack more densely as the number of cycles increased. Particle size measurements of the RF resin showed no indication of particle size change (for a given chemical) with cycles and essentially no fines formation. Micrographs comparing representative bead samples before and after testing indicated no change in bead morphology. The skeletal density of the RF resin in the 24 -inch IX Column increased slightly with cycling (in both hydrogen and sodium form). The chemical solutions used in the pilot-scale testing remained clear throughout testing, indicating very little chemical breakdown of the RF resin beads. The RF resin particles did not break down and produce fines, which would have resulted in higher pressure drops across the resin bed. Three cesium (Cs) loading tests were conducted on the RF resin in pilot-scale IX columns. Laboratory analyses concluded the Cs in the effluent never exceeded the detection limit. Therefore, there was no measurable degradation in cesium removal performance. Using the pilot-scale systems to add the RF resin to the columns and removing the resin from the columns was found to work well. The resin was added and removed from the columns three times with no operational concerns. Whether the resin was in sodium or hydrogen form, the resin flowed well and resulted in an ideal resin bed formation during each Resin Addition. During Resin Removal, 99 + % of the resin was easily sluiced out of the IX column. The hydraulic performance of the spherical RF resin during cycle testing was found to be superior to all other tested IX resins, and SRNL testing indicates that the resin should hold up to many cycles in actual radioactive Cs separation. The RF resin was found to be durable in the long term cycle testing and should result in a cost saving in actual operations when compared to other IX resins...|$|R

The diffuser was fitted with thermocouples to measure shell temperatures during testing.

40|$|Reactor safety {{experiments}} {{for studying}} the reactions of a molten core (corium) with water and/or concrete involve materials at extremely high temperature. Such high temperature severely restricts the types of sensors that can be employed to measure characteristics of the corium itself. Yet there is great interest in improving instrumentation so {{that the state of}} the melt can be established with more precision. In particular, it would be beneficial to increase both the upper range limit and accuracy of temperature measurements. The poor durability of thermocouples at high temperature is also an important issue. For experiments involving a water-quenched melt, direct measurements of the growth rate of the crust separating the melt and water would be of great interest. This is a key element in determining the nature of heat transfer between the melt and coolant. Despite its importance, no one has been able to directly measure the crust thickness during such tests. This paper considers three specialized sensors that could be introduced to enhance melt characterization: (1) A commercially fabricated, single point infrared temperature measurement with the footprint of a <b>thermowell.</b> A lens assembly and fiber optic cable linked to a receiver and amplifier measures the temperature {{at the base of a}} tungsten <b>thermowell.</b> The upper range limit is 3000 C and accuracy is {+-} 0. 25 % of the reading. (2) In-house development of an ultrasonic temperature sensor that would provide multipoint measurements at temperatures up to {approx} 3000 C. The sensors are constructed from tungsten rods and have a high temperature durability that is superior to that of thermocouples. (3) In-house development of an ultrasonic probe to measure the growth rate of the corium crust. This ultrasonic sensor would include a tungsten waveguide that transmits ultrasonic pulses up through the corium melt towards the crust and detects reflections from the melt/crust interface. A measurement of the echo time delay would provide the location of the interface. These three sensors would provide a considerable upgrade of the instrumentation used in our reactor materials tests. The infracouple is a commercial product that could provide an immediate improvement in temperature measurements. The sensor could also serve to corroborate thermocouple data by providing a measurement based upon a different physical principle. The ultrasonic temperature sensor would involve a greater investment and longer time frame than the infracouple, but offers all the advantages of the infracouple along with miniaturization and the ability to measure at multiple locations. In addition, the UTS is the platform from which we would begin development of the crust detector. Of the three sensors, the crust detector requires the most effort and entails the greatest uncertainty. However, a real-time crust thickness measurement has never before been made and such data would be unique and of great benefit to reactor materials experiments...|$|E
