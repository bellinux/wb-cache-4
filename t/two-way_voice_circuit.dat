40|$|On August 12, 1960, Echo I, a 100 -foot-diameter spherical balloon, {{was placed}} in orbit around the earth by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. The {{objective}} was to demonstrate the feasibility of long-distance communication by microwave reflection from a satellite. A <b>two-way</b> coast-to-coast <b>voice</b> <b>circuit</b> was to be established between the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) facility in California and a station provided by Bell Telephone Laboratories (STL) in New Jersey. Similar tests were also planned with the Naval Research Laboratory and other stations. This paper describes the general organization and operation of the Holmdel, New Jersey, station, and discusses {{the results of the}} experiments performed between the balloon launching and March 1, 1961. Successful voice communication was achieved through a variety of modulation methods including frequency modulation with feedback, amplitude modulation, single-sideband modulation, and narrow-band phase modulation. Careful measurements were also made of the loss in the transmission path...|$|R

40|$|This paper conceptualizes {{mobile phones}} as beyond <b>two-way</b> <b>voice</b> {{communication}} technologies, envisioning the mobile device {{as a social}} collective medium instead of a private personal technology. It addresses three central research questions: (1) What are the characteristics of mobile phones that differentiates them from traditional fixed phones? (2) What are some current uses of mobile interfaces that transform them into social collective media instead of private <b>two-way</b> <b>voice</b> communication devices? (3) What are the possible future developments of the mobile interface that these characteristics might lead to? Taking into consideration that new meanings for new interfaces are culturally and socially created, the paper addresses the emergence of social mobile networks created via mobile technologies. These networks emerge when cell phone use shifts from mobile telephone to a type of micro-computer, location aware device and internet connection interface...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} acoustic-phonetics of coronal stop production by adult simultaneous bilingual and monolingual speakers of Canadian English (CE) and Canadian French (CF). Differences in the phonetics of CF and CE include voicing {{and place of}} articulation distinctions. CE has a <b>two-way</b> <b>voicing</b> distinction (in syllable initial position) contrasting shortand long-lag VOT; coronal stops in CE are described as alveolar. CF also has a <b>two-way</b> <b>voicing</b> distinction, but contrasting lead and short-lag VOT; coronal stops in CF are described as dental. Acoustic analyses of stop consonants for both VOT and dental/alveolar place of articulation are reported. Results indicate that simultaneous bilingual as well as monolingual adults produce language-specific differences, albeit {{not in the same}} way, across CF and CE for voicing and place. Similarities and differences between simultaneous bilingual and monolingual adults are discussed to address phonological organization in simultaneous bilingual adults...|$|R

5000|$|Each Combat Crew has a <b>voice</b> <b>circuit</b> {{called the}} Hardened Voice Channel which links the five Combat Crews (LCCs) that {{comprise}} the squadron. There is also a <b>voice</b> <b>circuit</b> called the EWO (Emergency War Order) which links the squadron command posts (one {{of which is the}} wing CP). These two <b>voice</b> <b>circuits</b> work like a party line with all LCCs connected simultaneously. Thus, it is not possible for any of the Combat Crews to have private conversations. The term [...] "EWO" [...] used here is {{not to be confused with}} an actual Emergency War Order message from the National Command Authority. The same term is used to denote both this circuit and the message transmitted over the Primary Alert System.|$|R
50|$|A {{variety of}} mobile apps exist that mimic a walkie-talkie/Push-to-talk style interaction. They are marketed as low-latency, {{asynchronous}} communication.

40|$|Many {{theories}} of phonology {{assume that the}} sound structure of language {{is made up of}} distinctive features, but there is considerable debate about how much articulatory detail distinctive features encode in long-term memory. Laryngeal features such as voicing provide a unique window into this question: while many languages have two-way contrasts that can be given a simple binary feature account [±VOICE], the precise articulatory details underlying these contrasts can vary significantly across languages. Here, we investigate a series of <b>two-way</b> <b>voicing</b> contrasts in English, Arabic, and Russian, three languages that implement their voicing contrasts very differently at the articulatory-phonetic level. In three event-related potential experiments contrasting English, Arabic, and Russian fricatives along with Russian stops, we observe a consistent pattern of asymmetric mismatch negativity (MMN) effects that is compatible with an articulatorily abstract and cross-linguistically uniform way of marking <b>two-way</b> <b>voicing</b> contrasts, as opposed to an articulatorily precise and cross-linguistically diverse way of encoding them. Regardless of whether a language is theorized to encode [VOICE] over [SPREAD GLOTTIS], the data is consistent with a universal marking of the [SPREAD GLOTTIS] feature...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{medium in}} IEEE 802. 11 - and IEEE 802. 16 -based {{networks}} for voice communications can be con-sidered “both-way ”- for transmission and reception. Therefore, the packet arrivals for voice dialogue services in such networks are not strictly independent. In this paper, {{we discuss the}} traffic capacity in the call (network) layer and suggest accounting {{for the impact of}} the correlated nature of <b>two-way</b> <b>voice</b> conversations on performance estimation.

50|$|Similar {{requirements}} {{apply to}} emergency lighting {{in areas of}} refuge. A two way communication system is required on each floor above or below the main floor in newly constructed facilities. A call box is required in each area of refuge, which can call into a central location called a base station. If the station is not attended 24 hours a day, the call must automatically call to an outside location and have <b>two-way</b> <b>voice</b> person to person communication capabilities.|$|R
50|$|Some {{alarm systems}} serve a single purpose of {{burglary}} protection; combination systems provide both fire and intrusion protection.
