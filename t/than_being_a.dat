5|$|Jewell was the 51st Secretary of the Interior, and {{the second}} woman to hold the position. Unlike many of her predecessors, Jewell never held elected office. Because she {{acquired}} her U.S. citizenship by naturalization rather <b>than</b> <b>being</b> <b>a</b> natural-born citizen, Jewell was not eligible to hold a place within the presidential line of succession.|$|E
5|$|In {{preparation}} {{for an interview}} with Splits Magazine, cheerleading coach Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch) demands that new cheerleader Mercedes Jones (Amber Riley) lose ten pounds in a week. She reserves the school auditorium for cheer practice, so glee club director Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) has to find the club a new rehearsal space. He visits a local roller rink where he finds former glee club member April Rhodes (Kristin Chenoweth), who tells him that she is the mistress of the wealthy eighty-year-old tycoon who owns the rink. Upon learning that Will is looking to sublet his apartment, April invites herself to visit. After spending the night sharing a bed, Will forbids April from staying over again and tells her she is worth more <b>than</b> <b>being</b> <b>a</b> mistress. April says she will break up with her tycoon.|$|E

5|$|In the Holy Roman Empire, tall, {{free-standing}} wooden towers called Bergfriede were commonly {{built by}} the 11th century, either as part of motte-and-bailey designs or, as part of Hohenburgen castles, with characteristic inner and outer courts. Bergfriede, which take their name from the German for a belfry, had similarities to keeps, but are usually distinguished from them on account of Bergfriede having a smaller area or footprint, usually being non-residential and being typically integrated into the outer defences of a castle, rather <b>than</b> <b>being</b> <b>a</b> safe refuge of last resort.|$|E
5|$|In {{the south}} of England private castles were being built by newly emerging, wealthy families; like the work at Windsor, these castles drew on the {{architectural}} themes of earlier martial designs, but were not intended to form a serious defence against attack. These new castles were heavily influenced by French designs, involving a rectangular or semi-rectangular castle with corner towers, gatehouses and moat; the walls effectively enclosing a comfortable courtyard plan not dissimilar to that of an unfortified manor. Bodiam Castle built in the 1380s possessed a moat, towers and gunports but, rather <b>than</b> <b>being</b> <b>a</b> genuine military fortification, the castle was primarily intended to be admired by visitors and used as a luxurious dwelling – the chivalric architecture implicitly invoking comparisons with Edward I's great castle at Beaumaris.|$|E
5|$|It is {{seen that}} Justinian regards {{this as a}} novel {{enactment}} of an old law, and that he includes not only the symbolic interpretations of the punishment as found in for example Cicero, but also Constantine's extension of the penalty to fathers who murder their own children. In Justinian, relative to Constantine, we see the inclusion in the sack of the dog, cock and monkey, not just the serpent(s) in Constantine. Some modern historians, such as O.F. Robinson, suspects that the precise wording of the text in the Institutes 4.18.6 suggests that the claimed reference in Digest 48.9.9 from Modestinus is actually a sixth CE interpolation into the third century CE law text, rather <b>than</b> <b>being</b> <b>a</b> faithful citation of Modestinus.|$|E

5|$|Rudra's {{evolution}} from a minor Vedic deity to a supreme being is first evidenced in the Shvetashvatara Upanishad (400–200 BC), according to Gavin Flood. Prior to it, the Upanishadic literature is monistic, and the Shvetashvatara text presents the earliest seeds of theistic devotion to Rudra-Shiva. Here Rudra-Shiva {{is identified as}} {{the creator of the}} cosmos and liberator of souls from the birth-rebirth cycle. The period of 200 BC to 100 AD also marks the beginning of the Shaiva tradition focused on the worship of Shiva as evidenced in other literature of this period. Shaiva devotees and ascetics are mentioned in Patanjali's Mahābhāṣya (2nd-century BC) and in the Mahabharata. Other scholars such as Robert Hume and Doris Srinivasan state that the Shvetashvatara Upanishad presents pluralism, pantheism, or henotheism, rather <b>than</b> <b>being</b> <b>a</b> text just on Shiva theism.|$|E
5|$|In the ponerine ant Harpegnathos saltator, worker {{policing}} {{prevents the}} number of reproductive workers from becoming excessive. The species has gamergates, which lay eggs but rarely carry out any other tasks, so having {{too many of them}} would reduce the colony's efficiency. Gamergate numbers are rather stable, as infertile workers target newly ovipositing workers by jumping on and holding them: this efficiently inhibits them from laying eggs, and within a few weeks they revert to being subordinate and infertile workers. However, once new ovipositing workers attain a gamergate's level of ovarian activity, the infertile (policing) workers ignore them. The signal used by the policing workers consists of cuticle hydrocarbons transmitted only by direct contact, rather <b>than</b> <b>being</b> <b>a</b> pheromone detected by olfaction. Similarly, the inhibition of ovipositing workers is achieved by direct physical aggression by policing workers, not by any pheromone produced by queens or gamergates.|$|E
5|$|In {{the social}} {{evolution}} from the archaic age to the classical, the public ceased carrying weapons into the poleis. Originally {{it was expected}} that one carried a sword while in the city; However, a transition to spears, and then to staffs occurred until wearing any weapon in the city became a foolish old custom. Thus, the very act of carrying a staff was slightly taboo itself. According to modern theorists, the symbol of the staff was one which both functions as a tool to signal the user’s dissociation from physical labour, that is, as a display of conspicuous leisure, {{and at the same time}} it also has an association with sport and typically plays a part in hunting and sports clothing. Thus, it displays active and warlike qualities, rather <b>than</b> <b>being</b> <b>a</b> symbol of a weak man’s need to support himself. The staff itself became a message of how the Cynic was free through its possible interpretation as an item of leisure, but, just as equivalent, was its message of strength - a virtue held in abundance by the Cynic philosopher.|$|E

5|$|Many {{elements}} {{first introduced}} {{in this game}} have remained in the series. For instance, non-player characters (NPCs) were present in The Legend of Zelda, but their role was rather limited. Starting with The Adventure of Link, Zelda games have prominently featured a variety of NPCs who play pivotal roles in Link's quests. Zelda II {{was also one of}} the first games where NPCs walked around and seemingly had their own agendas, giving the world a life of its own rather <b>than</b> <b>being</b> <b>a</b> simple stage for the story to unfold. The use of metered magic and spells has also carried over into other Zelda games. The Triforce of Courage makes its first appearance in The Adventure of Link and plays an important role in later Zelda games, as it is strongly associated with Link. Dark Link is a version of Link's Shadow which appears in , a similar Link clone called Shadow Link appears in , and yet another appears in , as well as in A Link Between Worlds.|$|E
5|$|Support for {{continued}} use of the name {{has come from the}} team's owners and a majority of fans, which include some Native Americans. Supporters say that the name honors the achievements and virtues of Native Americans, and that it is not intended in a negative manner. Some, such as team president Bruce Allen, also point to the use of Redskins by three high school teams, two on reservations, that have a majority of Native American students. Supporters have asserted that a majority of Native Americans are not offended by the name based upon a national poll by Annenberg Public Policy Center in 2004. In a commentary published soon after that poll, 15 Native American scholars collaborated on a critique that stated that there were so many flaws in the Annenberg study that rather <b>than</b> <b>being</b> <b>a</b> measure of Native American opinion, it was an expression of white privilege and colonialism. Specific criticism of the methodology includes the use of self-reporting to identify Native Americans, which violated the basic principles supporting the validity of public opinion polling. In May 2016, the Washington Post published a poll that duplicated the central question posed in 2004, yielding an identical result.|$|E
5|$|The Mangalorean Catholics {{constituted}} {{a small community}} widely scattered across the South Canara district. Rather <b>than</b> <b>being</b> <b>a</b> closely knit and united group, the Goan Catholic immigrants and their progeny did not associate with the native Catholics on account of caste, origin, and language, and even among themselves were strongly divided by caste. The Hindus, including the indigenous Brahmins (mostly belonging to the Shivalli, Havyaka, and Kota sub-groups) and Bunts did not associate with the Catholics and would not admit them into their houses on account of their religion. However, a close contact was kept by the Catholics with the Hindus of the same caste who were refugees from Goa. Catholics would invite their Hindu cousins to festivities such as birth celebrations, weddings, and funeral feasts. The Hindus accepted such invitations. Unlike his Hindu counterpart, a high-caste Mangalorean Catholic did not consider himself polluted upon physical contact {{with a member of}} the lower caste, but members of different castes did not fraternise or invite each other home for dinner.|$|E

5|$|The attacking {{force has}} the natural {{advantage}} {{at the start}} of each game, likely indicating an important cultural aspect by mimicking the success of Viking raids. Another cultural indication of the king is that importance of the Viking chiefs' presence in battle. Although the kings of Europe later claimed divine rule and sat upon the throne rather <b>than</b> <b>being</b> <b>a</b> physical presence on the battlefield, it was essential for a Viking chief to be considered an equal in war. The importance of war is also reflected in Hnefatafl because it is a war strategy game, which can indicate an important reason why the gaming boards have been found with males of all ages. In Balnakeil, a male skeleton between the ages of 8 and 13 was found with weapons and a Hnefatafl board game. Vikings tended to take boys onto the battlefield with them, which explains why young boys also played these war-strategic board games.|$|E

25|$|Social {{ecologist}} {{and feminist}} Janet Biehl has criticized ecofeminism for focusing {{too much on}} a mystical connection between women and nature and not enough on the actual conditions of women.
