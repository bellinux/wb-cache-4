40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the use of <b>tablet</b> <b>computers</b> in a Swedish language, classroom. This study aims to {{investigate}} student and teacher attitudes when using <b>tablet</b> <b>computers</b> for story writing. One fifth grade classroom was observed on three occasions and a total of six students and three teachers were subsequently interviewed. This study addresses the following questions: How are <b>tablet</b> <b>computers</b> used for writing stories in a Swedish classroom?   What opportunities and obstacles do teachers experience when using the <b>tablet</b> <b>computers</b> when it comes to writing stories? Which method was preferred by the students? Writing stories on <b>tablet</b> <b>computers</b> or writing by hand? This qualitative study was based on observations and interviews.  Analysis of observations and interviews show that the <b>tablet</b> <b>computers</b> appear to help the students with language, organisation and structure in the writing of stories. However, teachers still need to incorporate both writing by hand and using the <b>tablet</b> <b>computers</b> to ensure competence for real-life situations which still use a mixture of both skills.  The results also showed that <b>tablet</b> <b>computers</b> are a useful tool for communication when students help each other in their writing. Classroom observations suggest that tablet computers can act as a mediator tool in the Swedish elementary school classroom primarily as it makes the writing process easier for the students. Analysis of teacher interviews suggest that teachers prefer to have students use tablets as it makes the student’s texts clearer, facilitating assessment...|$|R
