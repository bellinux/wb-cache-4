5|$|The {{buildup of}} {{vehicles}} and men <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> crossing at Wolfheze caused a bottleneck and made progress slow. Rather than wait, brigade headquarters, the KOSB and 156 Para chose {{to head up}} and over the railway embankment on foot. Once south of the railway line Support and 'B' Company, 156 Para became mixed up with 10 Para making towards Wolfheze, while the battalion headquarters and other two companies headed further south. At 20:30 divisional headquarters issued orders for all units to fall back on a position around the Hartenstein Hotel in Oosterbeek. The Germans continued to pressure 4th Parachute Brigade and 10 Para dug in around Wolfheze. 156 Para to their south came under constant attack leading to fighting at close quarters throughout the night and into the next morning.|$|E
5|$|David {{decides to}} take the lead in {{opposing}} the Conqueror in hopes of earning independence for Athlum, which is currently a vassal state to the city of Celapaleis. The party succeeds in stopping the Conqueror's army from attacking Celapaleis, but the Conqueror himself attacks Athlum in their absence. He kills Emma, who had remained behind to defend the city and takes the massive Remnant of Athlum, shrinking it to a normal-sized sword. The party then returns to Elysion to rescue Irina from Wagram. Irina is revealed to have a special power, that of unbinding bound Remnants, and it was for this reason that she was kidnapped. They discover that Hermeien is <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> Conqueror and Wagram to spark distrust in the people for Remnants and the city-states' ability to control them, so that he can then use Irina and her power to prop himself up as supreme ruler. While the party are successful in retaking Irina and killing Hermeien, Wagram escapes while revealing that he and the Conqueror never planned to support Hermeien. Confronted by the Conqueror, Irina uses Nagapur's Remnant to protect her brother, destroying half of the city in the process.|$|E

25|$|Päts's {{ideology}} {{went through}} major changes during his career.

25|$|Some {{union members}} {{questioned}} McCarron's {{motivation for the}} mergers. For example, in 1991, several carpenter locals in Orange and Riverside counties were trusteed. The locals were forcibly merged into a new affiliate, Local 803, which was in turn supervised from McCarron's Los Angeles offices. In 1992, carpenters' international union president Sigurd Lucassen and McCarron ordered a snap one-day election to select new Local 803 leaders. Nominations and the election were held on the same night. Of the 3,400 active and retired members eligible to vote, only 140 did so. Union members appealed the election results to the international union, which rejected the complaint. The union members then complained to United States Department of Labor (DOL), arguing that union officials were <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> election to tighten their control over Local 803. A federal judge agreed, noting that Lucassen and McCarron had violated federal labor law and the union's own constitution.|$|E

I know everyone's a little nervous and sceptical of 3-D these days, but the work has been done very, very well.

[...] Producer David Heyman spoke to SFX magazine about the 3-D conversion, saying that [...] "The way David Yates is approaching 3-D is he's trying to approach it from a character and story point of view. <b>Trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> sense of isolation, of separation that sometimes 3-D gives you, to heighten that at appropriate moments.

The [...] commando were informed they would be joining the 4th Special Service Brigade to replace No. 46 (Royal Marine) Commando. Arriving in Belgium [...] they discovered that the brigade was already well into training for Operation Infatuate. This was an assault landing {{on the island of}} Walcheren to open the sea route into Antwerp. The city had already been liberated but the northern bank of the Scheldt was still in German hands, enabling them to sink shipping <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> port.

500|$|From the unformed shapeshifter, {{they learn}} {{of a name}} of its {{potential}} target, a doctor at a local hospital. They take the man into custody but find that {{he has yet to}} be harmed. Based on the need for three shapeshifters, Walter surmises that Newton is <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> same technology that he and William Bell had pioneered for crossing the universes, by placing three vibrational sources triangulated around the target. [...] Walter begins to collect equipment to create interference with the vibrations to prevent the crossing. Another corpse is found, that of a bank manager that appears to have been killed by a shapeshifter. Realizing both men would have access to secured areas in their workplaces, they use these locations as two points on Netwon's triangle. From this, they are able to identify two locations where the transfer will occur. Olivia (Anna Torv), using the information Walter has told her in private about his own crossing, identifies a collapsed derelict bridge over the Charles River, where the water would absorb the energy of crossing over.|$|E

500|$|Other terms {{have been}} {{recognized}} as scriptural, based on their use in the New Testament: [...] "church of God", [...] "church of the Lord", [...] "churches of Christ", [...] "church of the first-born", [...] "church of the living God", [...] "the house of God", and [...] "the people of God". While recognized as scriptural, terms such as Church of God are avoided to avoid confusion or identification with other groups that use those designations. [...] As a practical matter, use of a common term {{is seen as a}} way to help individual Christians find congregations with a similar approach to the scriptures. Members understand that a scriptural name {{can be used in a}} [...] "denominational" [...] or [...] "sectarian" [...] way. <b>Trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> term [...] "Church of Christ" [...] exclusively has been criticized as identifying a denomination.
