50|$|Similarly, Connecticut {{industry}} became {{well known}} in allied fields. Hardware and tools continue to be manufactured by Stanley Corporation in New Britain, despite having almost moved elsewhere for financial reasons. Connecticut was a major area for development and manufacture of machine tools. In 1818, Simeon North designed America's first milling machine. Machinist Elisha Root first designed machinery for the Collins Company of Collinsville which manufactured axes which became world-famous, then was hired by Colt in 1849 to modernize firearm production by designing precision drop hammers, boring machines, gauges, jigs, etc., and improving the milling machines designed by Francis A. Pratt for the George S. Lincoln company in Hartford; the resulting Lincoln miller became world-famous, selling over 150,000 machines. Another Colt engineer, William Mason, patented 125 inventions for manufacture of firearms, as well as steam pumps and power looms. Christopher Spencer invented the automatic turret lathe (which in its small- to medium-sized form {{is known as a}} screw machine) for machining screws, as well as the variable cam cylinder used to control the turret. Francis A. Pratt and Amos Whitney invented a <b>thread</b> <b>milling</b> <b>machine</b> in 1865; Whitney also perfected various measurement instruments, and Pratt designed the aforementioned original milling machine manufactured by the George S. Lincoln company of Hartford. Simon Fairman invented the lathe chuck in West Stafford in 1830, and his son-in-law, Austin F. Cushman, invented the self-centering Cushman Universal Chuck in 1862. Edward P. Bullard designed the vertical boring mill in 1883. Charles E. Billings perfected the drop hammer for metal forging in the 1870s and designed the copper commutator central to the operation of electrical generators and motors. Edwin R. Fellows of Torrington in 1896 designed and built a new type of gear shaper and founded the Fellows Gear Shaper Company, which made a vital contribution to the manufacture of effective and reliable gear transmissions for the nascent automotive industry. The name Bridgeport on machine tools continues to be a guarantee of high quality around the world, for people who have no idea that the machinery is named after a city in Connecticut. Even the world of toys was dominated by the A. C. Gilbert Company, manufacturers of Erector Sets as well as other educational toys such as chemistry sets, microscopes, toy trains, etc.|$|E

40|$|Now the {{mechanical}} engineering industry produces {{a great variety of}} part mix having a male and female thread. In this regard a relevant task is to choose the most effective way of threading. Introduction of multi-coordinate CNC machines considerably extended the use of <b>thread</b> <b>mills,</b> instead of taps, roll burnishers, dies and thread turning tools. The article reviews manufacturer’s production programs of <b>thread</b> <b>mills</b> (Carmex, Emuge, Jel, Sandvik, Vargus) to show that, presently, there is a significant diversity of <b>thread</b> <b>mill</b> designs for processing. The analysis allowed to reveal the main nomenclature and standard sizes of <b>thread</b> <b>mills,</b> including combined tools on their base, as well as to reveal classification signs and to develop classification of <b>thread</b> <b>mills.</b> Classification comprises also combined tools based on design of <b>thread</b> <b>mill,</b> which allow us to reduce the nomenclature of the tools used in threading. The paper considers working schemes of the main types of <b>thread</b> <b>mills</b> and areas of their rational application. To analyse design data of <b>thread</b> <b>mills</b> two types of tools have been selected, namely the integral trailer edge <b>thread</b> <b>mills</b> with the spiral chip flutes and drill <b>thread</b> <b>mills</b> made from hard alloy.

The paper presents graphic dependences of the total length, length of a working part, diameter of a tail part and number of tool teeth on the diameter of the working part of the tool.

Developments presently existing in the RF and used in the <b>thread</b> <b>mills</b> deal, mainly, with the <b>thread</b> <b>milling</b> cutter designs, to process internal and external thread with straight flutes made from high-speed steel. The paper presents a technique to calculate and select the initial design parameters, i. e. the external diameter of the tapping part of <b>thread</b> <b>milling</b> cutter, which is chosen as a basic computational design.   The analysis of directories of tool companies containing foreign de-signs of solid thread end-milling cutters has shown that most of them rep-resent the thread cutter designs made of solid carbide.

40|$|An {{increasing}} {{thread accuracy}} in {{details of the}} machine-building production results from the improved design and manufacturing stages of threading tools. In modern industry, <b>thread</b> <b>milling</b> cutters gain an increasingly greater spread for thread manufacturing. Preliminary {{studies have shown that}} improving the accuracy of a cut thread is closely connected with the task of profiling the teeth of the <b>thread</b> <b>milling</b> cutters with helical flutes, and the accuracy of the solution depends on the face profile of the tool into the end section. In addition, the face profile of the tool is required to solve problems related to the calculation of strength <b>thread</b> <b>milling</b> cutters and evaluation of geometrical parameters of the teeth. The analysis of GOST 1336 - 77 on <b>thread</b> <b>milling</b> cutters showed that there are no geometric and structural parameters characterizing the end <b>thread</b> <b>milling</b> cutters with helical flutes. Since the standard presents <b>thread</b> <b>milling</b> cutters with a straight flutes, in which the shape of the tooth profile cutters of the second order is the same as in normal and end sections, for cutters with helical flutes it is necessary {{to solve the problem of}} conversion of normal and end sections to get the desired shape of the cutting edge. In order to assess the face profile, the end mills of high speed steel and carbide have been analyzed to show that the vast majority of the face profile of the tooth is specified in the normal section line, which is taken as an input in determining the function of the profile form for the face of the end section of the teeth <b>thread</b> <b>milling</b> cutter with helical flutes. The paper solves the problem of calculating the coordinates of the profile of the endsection of a tooth cutters with helical flutes adopted at the original tooth profile in normal section. It has been verified by modeling software CATIA V 5 R 17. An example illustrates finding the function form of the end section. Calculations have shown that in the end section of a tooth there is a curve described by a second-degree polynomial with a high degree of accuracy.

40|$|The {{review of}} manufacturer's {{programs}} to make <b>thread</b> <b>milling</b> cutters {{has shown that}} most of milling cutters are produced with the helical flutes with the ω slope angle {{within the range of}} 10 ° [...] . 30 °. Thus, <b>thread</b> <b>milling</b> cutters, made of high speed steels, essentially, are not produced. In Russia there is GOST 1336 - 77, to regulate the parameters of <b>thread</b> <b>milling</b> cutter shaving with a straight flutes, made of high speed steels. It is established that available rake and clearance angles, and inclination angle of helical flutes at the accepted values of pitch and diameter of the tool lead to obtaining the angles of the tooth profile other than 30 degrees, thus requiring the calculation of angles β 1 and β 2 in each case of design. In the general case we have an asymmetrical profile with respect to the axis passing through the top of the tooth. Using the CATIA V 5 R 17 software, a geometric model that allows us to determine the angles of the tooth profile of <b>thread</b> <b>milling</b> cutter with helical flutes has been developed. The model research has been conducted for geometric and design parameters of <b>thread</b> <b>milling</b> cutter, made of cemented carbide and high speed steel. The paper presents a method for constructing models and key assumptions adopted for its development.
