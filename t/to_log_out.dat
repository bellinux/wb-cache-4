25|$|On November 6, 10,000 players log {{into the}} SAOs {{mainframe}} cyberspace {{for the first}} time, {{only to discover that}} they are unable <b>to</b> <b>log</b> <b>out.</b> Kayaba appears and tells the players that they must beat all 100 floors of Aincrad, a steel castle which is the setting of SAO, if they wish to be free. Those who suffer in-game deaths or forcibly remove the NerveGear out-of-game will suffer real-life deaths.|$|E
2500|$|... is {{a fictional}} {{character}} who {{appears in the}} Sword Art Online series of light novels by Reki Kawahara. He is more commonly known by his portmanteau, , his player name in the eponymous video game which the novels are set in. Kirito is the protagonist of the series, and is depicted as a teenager who was chosen as one of 1,000 beta testers for a new state-of-the-art virtual reality MMORPG, Sword Art Online. After the game is released to the general public, he and 10,000 other players soon discover that they are unable <b>to</b> <b>log</b> <b>out</b> and are trapped in the simulation unless they manage to beat the game.|$|E
5000|$|Users {{may also}} wish <b>to</b> <b>log</b> <b>out</b> of {{websites}} whenever they are finished using them. However {{this will not}} protect against attacks such as Firesheep.|$|E
50|$|Kits {{have been}} {{proposed}} for use in <b>logging,</b> <b>to</b> lift <b>logs</b> <b>out</b> of unroaded areas.|$|R
25|$|A half-mile (1km) horse-drawn {{railroad}} {{was once}} constructed {{on the south}} slopes below the col, following the brook by Byrne Road, <b>to</b> haul <b>logs</b> <b>out</b> of the area. Remnants of its steel-topped wooden rails can still be found.|$|R
50|$|In {{the second}} half of the 19th century, the river was used <b>to</b> {{transport}} <b>logs</b> <b>out</b> of the forests surrounding its watershed. Now, parts of this river have been turned into a provincial waterway park as well as a provincial nature reserve (at Egan Chute).|$|R
50|$|DTSS {{implemented}} {{an early}} {{integrated development environment}} (IDE): an interactive command line interface. There was no need <b>to</b> <b>log</b> <b>out.</b> If users did not respond, they were logged out after a short delay.|$|E
50|$|Other window {{managers}} and desktop environments use a similar scheme, where programs {{have their own}} menus, but clicking {{one or more of}} the mouse buttons on the root window brings up a menu containing, for example, commands to launch various applications or <b>to</b> <b>log</b> <b>out.</b>|$|E
50|$|A user menu {{placed on}} the {{opposite}} side of the screen, which has been available since GNOME 2.14 but has become more prominent in GNOME 3.x, holds access to account and system settings as well as options <b>to</b> <b>log</b> <b>out,</b> switch user, and shut down the computer.|$|E
50|$|The river {{joins the}} York River where it flows through Conroy Marsh, a provincially {{significant}} wetland. At one time, this river was used <b>to</b> transport <b>logs</b> <b>out</b> {{of the pine}} forests to sawmills located downstream. A number of timber slides were built <b>to</b> transport <b>logs</b> through rapids along the river. Now, the river is used for recreational canoeing.|$|R
50|$|Historically, {{the economy}} in the area was based on timber and mining. The Little Mississippi River and York River were used <b>to</b> {{transport}} <b>logs</b> <b>out</b> of the forests. Now, tourism {{is an important part of}} the local economy. Over half of the land in the region is designated crown land.|$|R
40|$|Photograph {{of logging}} ox team on skidroad. Five lumberjacks watch over 4 pairs of oxen {{dragging}} a large log through the forest. Pioneering lumber operation {{used in the}} early days of logging. Multiple teams of oxen were used <b>to</b> snake <b>logs</b> <b>out</b> of the hills. Later logging railroads and steam-driven tractors were used...|$|R
5000|$|...hack//Zero, a novel series {{released}} under Project [...]hack. It {{tells the}} story of a Long Arm named Carl, of what happened to Sora after he was trapped in The World by Morganna, and of Tsukasa's real life after being able <b>to</b> <b>log</b> <b>out</b> from The World.|$|E
50|$|Remote login/logout panels can be {{installed}} at any locations to provide convenient access points for staff to logon to the depot protection system to apply for protection prior to work, or <b>to</b> <b>log</b> <b>out</b> of the system, thereby removing their protection from train movement, after they have finished work.|$|E
50|$|A logout {{function}} is useful as it {{allows users to}} indicate that a session should not allow further requests. Thus attacks can only be effective while a session is active. Note that the following code performs no Cross-site request forgery checks, potentially allowing an attacker to force users <b>to</b> <b>log</b> <b>out</b> of the web application.|$|E
5000|$|The {{influx of}} {{immigrant}} loggers introduces new risks {{for the local}} communities, such as rural food shortages, and increase in crime rate, {{and an increase in}} the rate of sexually transmitted diseases, such as HIV. [...] Although the increased economic activity introduced by logging might be seen as a benefit, the windfall is mostly seen by the traders and not the rural Malagasy poor, who do the strenuous physical labor for minimal pay. Some locals have abstained from logging from fear of prosecution, while others have turned <b>to</b> <b>logging</b> <b>out</b> of desperation. With armed militia occupying villages and issuing death threats towards people who object to their activities, people live in fear and communities and families have been divided.|$|R
40|$|This is {{a manual}} for {{users of the}} Software Engineering and Ada Database (SEAD). SEAD was {{developed}} to provide an information resource to NASA and NASA contractors with respect to Ada-based resources and activities that are available or underway either in NASA or elsewhere in the worldwide Ada community. The sharing of such information will reduce the duplication of effort while improving quality {{in the development of}} future software systems. The manual describes the organization of the data in SEAD, the user interface from <b>logging</b> in <b>to</b> <b>logging</b> <b>out,</b> and concludes with a ten chapter tutorial on how to use the information in SEAD. Two appendices provide quick reference for logging into SEAD and using the keyboard of an IBM 3270 or VT 100 computer terminal...|$|R
50|$|An {{automatic}} privilege exists {{when there}} is no requirement to have permission to perform an action. For example, on systems where people are required <b>to</b> <b>log</b> into a system <b>to</b> use it, <b>logging</b> <b>out</b> will not require a privilege. Systems that do not implement file protection - such as MS-DOS - essentially give unlimited privilege to perform any action on a file.|$|R
50|$|As Sei {{makes his}} way through the server, he {{collects}} Virtua Souls and fights more attackers, eventually making it all the way through them and encountering the root user. At the top of the building, he comes across a blonde African American in a load of armor. Despite his buff appearance, Sei easily defeated the root user, thus granting him the opportunity <b>to</b> <b>log</b> <b>out,</b> {{as well as the other}} hunters.|$|E
50|$|The story {{reaches its}} climax when Tsukasa confronts Morganna. Then the viewer sees him declaring {{that he is}} no longer afraid of her or of reality, and will log out because there is someone he wants to see. This {{statement}} triggers Aura's awakening, allowing Tsukasa <b>to</b> <b>log</b> <b>out.</b> The last scenes feature an emotional encounter between Tsukasa's real-life self, finally shown to be a girl, and the real-life player behind Subaru.|$|E

40|$|Lumber camp {{carving of}} a sled {{carrying}} {{a load of}} lumber. This figure was picked up {{at a flea market}} in St. John's in 2013. The seller said it was carved by a man from Botwood who had worked in the lumber camps. This figure is a model of a horse drawn sled that would have been used <b>to</b> haul <b>logs</b> <b>out</b> of the lumber woods...|$|R
50|$|The {{river was}} a major {{transportation}} route for the Mi'kmaq people of Nova Scotia. Later, it was used <b>to</b> transport <b>logs</b> <b>out</b> of {{the interior of the}} province. The river was described in Albert Bigelow Paine's The Tent Dwellers, albeit under the name 'Liverpool river'. There are a number of hydroelectric projects on the river, which has been exploited for more than a hundred years.|$|R
5000|$|An early 20th-century lumber camp in Victory Township was {{donated to}} house the museum. The two 100-year-old {{buildings}} were moved from their original location to White Pine Village. The buildings, a blacksmith shop, and a cooking shanty were originally constructed by John G. Peterson, a local lumberman. Michigan logging wheels that were used <b>to</b> drag <b>logs</b> <b>out</b> of the woods are displayed on the grounds.|$|R
5000|$|As {{stated by}} Facebook in its Help Center, {{there is no}} way <b>to</b> <b>log</b> <b>out</b> of the Facebook Messenger application. Instead, users can choose between {{different}} availability statuses, including [...] "Appear as inactive", [...] "Switch accounts", and [...] "Turn off notifications". Media outlets have reported on a workaround, by pressing a [...] "Clear data" [...] option in the application's menu in Settings on Android devices, which returns the user to the log-in screen.|$|E
5000|$|...hack//Sign {{follows the}} story about Tsukasa being mind-trapped into the game. Despite being a [...] "fantasy quest type adventure", it does not rely on action sequences. Instead, the show is driven by mystery, slowly {{revealing}} its secrets to the viewer while paying {{much attention to the}} individual characters. Questions like what happened to Tsukasa in the real world, who he really is and why he is unable <b>to</b> <b>log</b> <b>out</b> are driving points of the story.|$|E
50|$|Applications can be {{assigned}} to users or groups of users using the Object Manager which can automatically present new applications to users dynamically without them needing <b>to</b> <b>log</b> <b>out.</b> Profiles can be created to group similar types of users; these profiles control the applications that a logged-in user is allowed to use. When a new application or an upgrade to an existing application is required, an administrator can just push these changes out to the users. This simplifies Desktop SOE migrations.|$|E
50|$|Mr. Wakefield {{moved to}} Milwaukee, Wisconsin in 1879 and {{established}} a real estate business, dealing in timber and mineral lands in Michigan, Wisconsin, Texas, and Alaska. He was secretary-treasurer of the Ontonagon River Improvement and Boom Company, organized in 1880. They made it possible <b>to</b> float <b>logs</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> Lake Superior and built a sawmill on an island {{near the mouth of}} the Ontonagon river in Ontonagon, Michigan.|$|R
50|$|The term {{pack animal}} is {{traditionally}} used {{in contrast to}} draft animal, which is a working animal that typically pulls a load behind itself (such as a plow, a cart, a sled or a heavy log) rather than carrying cargo directly on its back. For instance, sled dogs pull loads but do not normally carry them, while working elephants {{have been used for}} centuries <b>to</b> haul <b>logs</b> <b>out</b> of forests.|$|R
50|$|The logging {{operation}} initially {{depended on}} the nearby St. Johns River, Florida at Horse Landing, <b>to</b> ship raw <b>logs</b> <b>out</b> of the Ocklawaha River Valley. The completion of the railroad to Rodman Junction spelled the end of hauling <b>logs</b> <b>to</b> market by wagon, soon Cummings Lumber was operating a large rail system reaching into the forest in every direction.|$|R
50|$|Right {{after he}} had just arrived, a strange {{creature}} named Bit appears from his Hunter's Glove at a blaze of light and announces {{that he will be}} his navigator throughout the servers he visits. Sei is fine with this, now that Bit had explained his startling entrance, but not with the fighters that pursue him a few minutes afterwards. Then a girl with aqua-colored hair approaches him and directs him <b>to</b> <b>log</b> <b>out.</b> Sei demands that Bit log out, but the command is not accessible.|$|E
50|$|For levels 5-9 an {{invasion}} gate {{appears in the}} middle of x-1, in x-3 a gate appears for all those between levels 10-14 and in x-5 all players at levels 15 and above have to enter invasion here. The gate in x-1 typically contains NPCs that are easier to kill and they get harder as you move to the higher gates. You are unable <b>to</b> <b>log</b> <b>out</b> when in the invasion gate, the only way out is if your ship is destroyed, or you level beyond the parameters of the gate.|$|E
50|$|Also {{close to}} Tsukasa is Mimiru, a Heavy Blade who is poor at {{planning}} things out and following through on them. She {{is the first}} player to meet Tsukasa, and later forms a bond with him and vows to protect him. She usually hangs out with Bear, trying to solve the mystery of Tsukasa's inability <b>to</b> <b>log</b> <b>out.</b> Bear is an older player of the game and plays a Blademaster. He appears as cool and collected, always willing to help out newbies. He also conducts research in the real world on Tsukasa. One of Bear's acquaintances is BT, a plotting and scheming Wavemaster.|$|E
2500|$|On February 20, 1890, {{the mate}} of No Wonder, Kane Olney, was serious {{injured in a}} towing {{accident}}. [...] The accident occurred about on the Columbia River, about a mile upriver from Cathlamet, Washington. [...] Captain Turner was in command at that time. [...] The steamer was using its donkey steam engine <b>to</b> haul <b>logs</b> <b>out</b> of the water onto the bank. [...] The mate was out of boat on the bank {{when one of the}} irons used to secure the pulling chain <b>to</b> the <b>logs</b> snapped loose from the log, striking the mate in the left temple, breaking his skull and exposing his brain.|$|R
50|$|In 1891 the Northwestern Lumber Company from Eau Claire {{started a}} big lumber mill at Stanley and spawned the Stanley, Merrill and Phillips Railway <b>to</b> haul <b>logs</b> <b>out</b> {{of the country}} to the north and south where it held timber lands. (The railway never reached Merrill or Phillips; its furthest reach was Walrath, to the north of Jump River.) The mill in Stanley sawed wood until 1920, when Northwestern's timber {{holdings}} in the area were largely exhausted. Over that period, the mill is estimated to have sawed 850 million board feet of lumber.|$|R
50|$|In 2016, TSheets {{released}} the TSheets Accountant View — a TSheets account functionality {{available only to}} TSheets PROs. Accountant View allows accountants to view their clients’ TSheets accounts in a simple dashboard. Accountants can switch {{back and forth between}} client accounts without having <b>to</b> <b>log</b> in and <b>out</b> of each account individually.|$|R
