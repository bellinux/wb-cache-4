5|$|In 2007, the Carolina Marsh <b>Tacky</b> Association was formed. The {{association}} was developed {{through the efforts}} of the American Livestock Breeds Conservancy working with owners and breed enthusiasts, with the goal of preserving and promoting the Marsh <b>Tacky</b> breed. The breed registry became a closed registry on August 18, 2010, and is maintained by the American Livestock Breeds Conservancy Pedigree Registry. Although closed, outside horses can be registered upon proof of origin, visual inspection and DNA confirmation of parentage.|$|E
5|$|In the lowcountry {{region of}} coastal Georgia and South Carolina, the Carolina Marsh <b>Tacky</b> {{was the most}} common horse for most of the breed's history. As the {{automobile}} became more common during the 20th century, breed numbers declined, and the Marsh <b>Tacky</b> was thought to have gone extinct during the 1980s and 1990s. Today there are 276 living animals recognized by the breed registry, including 153 mares and 123 stallions and geldings. The Equus Survival Trust considers the breed to be at critical/nearly extinct levels, meaning that there are fewer than 100 breeding mares in existence. The American Livestock Breeds Conservancy considers the Marsh <b>Tacky</b> (which they consider a strain of the Colonial Spanish horse) to be at critical levels, meaning that there are fewer than 200 annual registrations in the United States and an estimated global population of less than 2,000. Representatives of the ALBC state that the breed numbers will have to increase to an estimated 1,000 members to ensure permanent survival. On June 11, 2010, a bill was signed into law that made the Carolina Marsh <b>Tacky</b> the state heritage horse of South Carolina.|$|E
5|$|The Carolina Marsh <b>Tacky</b> or Marsh <b>Tacky</b> {{is a rare}} {{breed of}} horse, native to South Carolina. It {{is a member of}} the Colonial Spanish group of horse breeds, which also include the Florida Cracker Horse and the Banker horse of North Carolina. It is a small horse, well adapted for use in the lowland swamps of its native South Carolina. The Marsh <b>Tacky</b> {{developed}} from Spanish horses brought to the South Carolina coast by Spanish explorers, settlers and traders as early as the 16th century. The horses were used by the colonists during the American Revolution, and by South Carolinians for farm work, herding cattle and hunting throughout the breed's history.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Tacky's</b> War, or <b>Tacky's</b> Rebellion, was an {{uprising}} of Akan (then {{referred to as}} Coromantee) slaves that occurred in Jamaica from May to July 1760. It was the most significant slave rebellion in the Caribbean between the 1733 slave insurrection on St. John and the 1791 Haitian Revolution. According to Professor Trevor Burnard: [...] "In terms of its shock to the imperial system, only the American Revolution surpassed <b>Tacky's</b> War in the eighteenth century." ...|$|R
50|$|<b>Tacky's</b> Rebellion was, {{like many}} other Atlantic slave revolts, put down quickly and mercilessly by colonial officials. Planters {{severely}} punished rebel slaves. Other slaves learned of <b>Tacky's</b> revolt, which inspired unrest and disorder throughout the island. It took the local forces some weeks to re-establish order.|$|R

5|$|At the Falls of Arcadia, {{a fictional}} planned {{community}} in San Diego County, California, disgruntled homeowner Dave Kline arrives {{at home to}} find a package from an unknown person. The package contains a <b>tacky</b> whirligig, which Kline puts on his roof to annoy the neighbors. While in bed that night, Kline hears an intruder in the house. He goes to investigate while his wife, Nancy, stays in bed. A mysterious creature attacks and kills the Klines.|$|E
5|$|In {{large part}} due to the efforts of the organization, {{heritage}} turkey populations have increased more than tenfold in little over a decade, and several breeds that once stood on the brink of extinction now maintain healthy populations. The organization also sustains programs that deal with preserving and promoting endangered cattle and pig breeds, as well as breed-specific programs relating to many of its livestock categories. Breeds that the Conservancy has assisted in saving include the Carolina Marsh <b>Tacky</b> horse, Randall cattle, Red Wattle hogs and the American rabbit.|$|E
5|$|The Marsh <b>Tacky</b> {{is known}} by owners for its stamina {{and ability to}} work in water and swamps without panicking. They tend to be sure-footed, sturdy, smart, and able to survive in {{challenging}} coastal environments, {{as well as being}} easy keepers. Their small size and gentle nature made them the historically preferred mount for children and women, but they were also used as working animals due to their abilities in the field. Today, they are used in endurance riding, as well as continuing their traditional work assisting humans with hunting wild game and herding cattle.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tacky's</b> War (1760) {{was a slave}} {{uprising}} in Jamaica, which ran from May to July before it was put down by the British colonial government.|$|R
5|$|The breed is {{considered}} to be critically endangered by both the Livestock Conservancy and the Equus Survival Trust, and there are only around 275 Marsh <b>Tackies</b> in existence today. In 2006 and 2007, the two organizations worked together to complete DNA testing on the breed with the goals of mapping the Marsh <b>Tacky's</b> place among the horse breeds of the world and beginning a stud book. In 2007, an association was begun with the objective of preserving and promoting the Marsh Tacky; and in 2010 a closed stud book was created.|$|R
50|$|In 1760, {{the slave}} {{rebellion}} known as <b>Tacky's</b> War {{broke out in}} Jamaica. Apparently, some of the defeated rebels were burned alive, while others were gibbeted alive, left to die of thirst and starvation.|$|R
5|$|Dr. Spaceman tells Tracy {{that he is}} dating Squeaky Fromme {{and says}} {{that she is a}} handful. Fromme {{is a member of the}} Manson Family, and was sentenced to life {{imprisonment}} for attempting to assassinate United States President Gerald Ford in 1975. Jenna and Danny begin arguing after the two are forced to share a dressing room. She takes down Danny's poster of the Montreal Alouettes, a Canadian Football League team based in Montreal, Quebec, which was signed by Marc Trestman, the head coach of the Alouettes. Jenna says that she took down the poster because it was <b>tacky,</b> as are his mother's chain e-mails (a message that attempts to induce the recipient to make a number of copies of the letter and then pass them on to as many recipients as possible).|$|E
5|$|In 2006, the ALBC began {{investigating}} the Marsh <b>Tacky</b> {{to see if}} it was truly a descendent of Spanish stock, and during the organization's initial field investigations it was found that many surviving members of the breed fit the physical type of Colonial Spanish stock. In 2007, the American Livestock Breeds Conservancy collaborated with the Equus Survival Trust to collect DNA samples and photo-document the largest herd in South Carolina, considered to be the largest remaining herd, with a heritage tracing back to the American Civil War. DNA testing was undertaken in an effort to identify horses for a new studbook, reveal what DNA markers the breed carries, and map the breed's genetic place among all other horse breeds worldwide. Sixty horses were tested in the effort.|$|E

In 2007, the organization partnered with the Equus Survival Trust in a project to preserve the breed that included DNA sampling, the creation of a new studbook and mapping the genetics of the breed. The Conservancy participated in the rescue of the Wilbur Cruce strain of Colonial Spanish horse when the area in which it lived was to be turned over to a land conservation program that required domestic animals to be removed. After the rescue, a conservation plan was developed for the animals and small breeding groups of horses were placed with responsible parties. It also assisted in formulating a conservation and breeding strategy for a strain of Colonial Spanish horses from Santa Cruz Island in California. This support helped the horses to become recognized and registrable with the Colonial Spanish registry.|$|E
5|$|Marsh <b>Tackies</b> {{have the}} same ancestral bloodlines as Florida Cracker Horses and North Carolina Banker horses. However, DNA testing has proved that the Marsh Tackies' {{relative}} isolation has made them a separate breed with unique characteristics.|$|R
50|$|The colony's slaves, who outnumbered {{their white}} masters by {{a ratio of}} 20:1 in 1800, mounted over a dozen major slave conspiracies (the {{majority}} of which were organised by Coromantins), and uprisings during the 18th century, including <b>Tacky's</b> revolt in May 1760.|$|R
50|$|There are {{two methods}} that surfers use to {{maintain}} their wax. Usually a wax comb is used to maintain {{the grip of the}} wax. Usually, the comb is used to engrave a cross-cut pattern into the wax to create a <b>tackier</b> surface.|$|R
5|$|While {{walking in}} the woods, Andrei and Foma have a {{conversation}} about Foma’s faults, especially lying. Foma confesses to taking honey from the bee garden, after Andrei notices his cassock is <b>tacky,</b> and smears mud on his face to soothe a bee sting. While Foma has talent as an artist, he is less concerned with the deeper meaning of his work and more concerned with practical aspects of the job, like perfecting his azure, a colour which in painting was often considered unstable to mix. They encounter Theophanes in the forest, and the old master sends Foma away. As he leaves, the apprentice finds a dead swan and pokes at it with a stick. We cut to banks of a stream where Andrei and Theophanes are arguing about religion, while Foma cleans his master's paint brushes. Theophanes argues that the ignorance of the Russian people is due to stupidity, while Andrei says that he doesn’t understand how {{he can be a}} painter and maintain such views. This section contains a reenactment of Christ's Crucifixion on a snow-covered hillside which plays out as Andrei recounts the story and expresses his belief that the men who crucified Jesus were obeying God's will and loved him.|$|E
25|$|Eventually, <b>Tacky</b> {{was killed}} by a sharpshooter.|$|E
25|$|Thermosets, or {{thermosetting}} polymers, can melt {{and take}} shape only once: {{after they have}} solidified, they stay solid. In the thermosetting process, a chemical reaction occurs that is irreversible. The vulcanization of rubber {{is an example of}} a thermosetting process: before heating with sulfur, the polyisoprene is a <b>tacky,</b> slightly runny material; after vulcanization, the product is rigid and non-tacky.|$|E
50|$|The term 'obeah' {{is first}} found in {{documents}} from the early 18th century, as in its connection to Nanny of the Maroons, but discussion of it becomes more frequent when it was made illegal in Jamaica after <b>Tacky's</b> War, in which an obeahman provided advice to the rebels.|$|R
5000|$|Based on a {{novel by}} Beth Brown, the film was staged and {{directed}} by Rouben Mamoulian, [...] and stars Helen Morgan, Joan Peers, Henry Wadsworth, and Fuller Mellish, Jr. Mae West was originally considered for the part of Kitty Darling, but Paramount decided West's glamorous stage presence would undercut the <b>tackier</b> aspects of the storyline.|$|R
2500|$|Daegling {{notes that}} in 1967, movie and {{television}} special effects were primitive compared to the more sophisticated effects in later decades, and allows that if the Patterson film depicts {{a man in a}} suit that [...] "it is not unreasonable to suggest that it is better than some of the <b>tackier</b> monster outfits that got thrown together for television at that time." ...|$|R
25|$|The {{transition}} from a traditional wooden sole to one of vulcanized rubber {{may be attributed to}} Charles Goodyear and Leverett Candee. The qualities of rubber, though fascinating to Goodyear, were highly dependent on temperature: it was <b>tacky</b> when hot, brittle when cold. Vulcanization of rubber tempered its properties so that it was easily molded, durable, and tough. A rubberized elastic webbing made Goodyear's galoshes (circa 1890) easy to pull on and off.|$|E
25|$|A similar {{procedure}} {{occurs with}} masculine names, but using a reverse order. It {{is not unusual}} to find masculine names such as João Maria, José Maria, Manuel Maria, Luís Maria etc. In this case, Maria would always be the second given name, in honour of the Virgin Mary, and the first name would be a masculine name. This custom is fashionable among the Portuguese and Brazilian nobility and the upper classes, but is considered <b>tacky</b> in Brazilian society.|$|E
25|$|Enright's first novel, The Wig My Father Wore, was {{published}} in 1995. The book explores themes such as love, motherhood, Roman Catholicism, and sex. The narrator {{of the novel is}} Grace, who lives in Dublin and works for a <b>tacky</b> game show. Her father wears a wig that cannot be spoken of in front of him. An angel called Stephen who committed suicide in 1934 and has come back to earth to guide lost souls moves into Grace's home and she falls in love with him.|$|E
50|$|The {{rebellion}} didn't end here, {{as other}} rebellions broke {{out all over}} Jamaica, which many were rightly or wrongly attributed to <b>Tacky's</b> cunning and strategy. It was months later until peace was restored. Over 60 white people {{had lost their lives}} as well as 400 or so black slaves, including two ringleaders who were burned alive, and two others who were hung in iron cages at the Kingston Parade, until they starved to death.|$|R
5000|$|For her {{portrayal}} of Beth, George received a nomination for Best Newcomer at the 2012 Inside Soap Awards. She was also nominated {{in the same}} category at the 2012 TV Choice Awards. Jaci Stephen of the Daily Mail said Beth filled [...] "the humour gap" [...] left by Cilla Battersby-Brown (Wendi Peters). Beth and Kirk's wedding was described as [...] "possibly the <b>tackiest</b> event in soap all year" [...] in the Inside Soap Yearbook 2016.|$|R

[...] As the Rolling Stone article further explained, Tricky created [...] "a mercurial style of dance music that immediately finds [...] own fast feet." ...|$|R
25|$|A {{traditional}} wooden bat has {{its surface}} oiled with raw linseed oil before play, and regularly during the season. This has a protective {{effect on the}} wood, and also makes it less sensitive to humidity changes in the atmosphere, which could cause warping or splitting. Another important factor is that it increases the surface friction of the ball to bat surface, giving better control of the shot. A worn surface can be noticed by the player, indicating that re-oiling is needed. Raw linseed oil is used, rather than boiled linseed oil, as {{this is not a}} drying oil to the same degree, and so the surface remains <b>tacky.</b>|$|E
25|$|A {{check of}} the pet's gums and skin can {{indicate}} dehydration; gums become <b>tacky</b> and dry and skin does not snap back quickly when pinched if dehydration is present. When the skin at the back is lifted, a dehydrated animal's does not fall back into place quickly. Serious dehydration (loss of 10ndash&12% of body fluids) means the pulled up skin stays there and does not go back into place. At this point, the animal may go into shock; dehydration of 12% or more is an immediate medical emergency. Hypovolemic shock is a life-threatening medical condition in which the heart is unable to pump sufficient blood to the body, due to loss of fluids.|$|E
25|$|In 1763, this slave {{rebellion}} {{occurred in}} Berbice in present-day Guyana and {{was led by}} a Coromantin named Cuffy or Kofi and his deputy Akra or Akara. The slave rebellion from February 1763 into 1764. Cuffy, like <b>Tacky,</b> was born in West Africa before being enslaved. He led a revolt of more than 2,500 enslaved people against the colony regime. After acquiring firearms, the rebels attacked plantations. They gained an advantage after taking the house of Peerboom. They had told the whites inside that they could leave the house, {{but as soon as}} they left, the rebels killed many and took several prisoners, including the wife of a plantation owner whom Cuffy kept as his wife.|$|E

50|$|Clemetson {{was born}} in Port Maria, in Saint Mary Parish, Jamaica. He {{was the son of}} David Robert Clemeston and his wife Mary, of the Frontier Estate sugar {{plantation}} (the starting point of the slave rebellion known as <b>Tacky's</b> War in 1760). His grandfather, Robert Clemetson, had been a slave, but he was also the son of his owner; he was freed by his father and inherited the plantation, becoming one of the wealthy elite on the island. He was elected to the House of Assembly of Jamaica in 1840.|$|R
