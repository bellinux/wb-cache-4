25|$|The River Wansbeck Valley is {{narrow and}} steep {{and as a}} {{consequence}} has exaggerated amounts of surface runoff. Based on three storm events, a reliable flow gauge located upstream of Morpeth at the confluence of the Wansbeck and Font showed that 56% of rain fall is converted into surface runoff. Because the soil was already saturated {{as a result of the}} wet summer, the effect of surface runoff was greatly enhanced. Furthermore, increased urbanisation since the 1960s in Morpeth meant that most water falling on the town would have drained directly to the river channel. Other tests investigating the catchment lag time (time lapse between the midpoint of storm rainfall and peak river level) indicate that the Wansbeck has a LAG time of only 8 hours. This means that any water falling in the catchment area would have been rapidly converted into channel flow by surface runoff and to a lesser extent by <b>throughflow.</b> This is due to the steepness of the valley and the soil composition.|$|E
50|$|An {{important}} feature of the Indonesian <b>Throughflow</b> is that because {{the water in the}} western equatorial Pacific Ocean has a higher temperature and lower salinity than the water in the Indian Ocean, the <b>Throughflow</b> transports large amounts of relatively warm and fresh water to the Indian Ocean. When the Indonesian <b>Throughflow</b> (through Lombok Strait, Ombai and the Timor Passages) enters the Indian Ocean it is advected towards Africa within the Indian South Equatorial Current. There it eventually exits the Indian Ocean with the Agulhas Current around South Africa into the Atlantic Ocean.

40|$|The {{propagation}} of traffic congestion along roads is a commonplace nonlinear phenomenon. When many roads are connected in a network, congestion can spill from one road to others as drivers queue {{to enter a}} congested road, creating further nonlinearities in the network dynamics. This paper considers the node model problem, which refers to methods for solving for cross-flows when roads meet at a junction. We present a simple hybrid dynamic system that, given a macroscopic snapshot of the roads entering and exiting a node, intuitively models the node's <b>throughflows</b> over time. This dynamic system produces solutions to the node model problem that are equal to those produced by many popular node models without intuitive physical meanings. We also show how the earlier node models can be rederived as executions of our dynamic system. The intuitive physical description supplied by our system provides a base {{for control of the}} road junction system dynamics, as well as the emergent network dynamics.

50|$|In hydrology, <b>throughflow,</b> a {{subcomponent}} of interflow, is {{the lateral}} unsaturated {{flow of water}} in the soil zone, where a highly permeable geologic unit overlays a less permeable geologic unit, and which returns to the surface, as return flow, prior to entering a stream or groundwater. Once water infiltrates into the soil, it is still affected by gravity and either infiltrates to the water table or travels downslope. <b>Throughflow</b> usually occurs during peak hydrologic events, and flow rates are dependent on the hydraulic conductivity of the geologic medium.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} an open {{problem in}} traffic modeling: the second-order macroscopic node problem. A second-order macroscopic traffic model, {{in contrast to}} a first-order model, allows for variation of driving behavior across subpopulations of vehicles in the flow. The second-order models are thus more descriptive (e. g., they have been used to model variable mixtures of behaviorally-different traffic, like car/truck traffic, autonomous/human-driven traffic, etc.), but are much more complex. The second-order node problem is a particularly complex problem, as it requires the resolution of discontinuities in traffic density and mixture characteristics, and solving of <b>throughflows</b> for arbitrary numbers of input and output roads to a node (in other words, this is an arbitrary-dimensional Riemann problem with two conserved quantities). We propose a solution to this problem by making use of a recently-introduced dynamic system characterization of the first-order node model problem, which gives insight and intuition as to the continuous-time dynamics implicit in first-order node models. We use this intuition to extend the dynamic system node model to the second-order setting. We also extend the well-known "Generic Class of Node Model" constraints to the second order and present a simple solution algorithm to the second-order node problem. This node model has immediate applications in allowing modeling of behaviorally-complex traffic flows of contemporary interest (like partially-autonomous-vehicle flows) in arbitrary road networks...|$|R
40|$|International audienceExtending {{previous}} linear stability {{analyses of}} the instabilities developing in permeable Taylor-Couette-Poiseuille flows where axial and radial <b>throughflows</b> are superimposed on the usual Taylor-Couette flow, we further examine the linear behaviour and expand the analysis to consider the weakly nonlinear behaviour of convective-type instabilities {{by means of the}} derivation of the fifth-order amplitude equation together with direct numerical simulations. Special attention is paid to the influence of the radius ratio eta = r(in) /r(out), and particularly to wide gaps (small eta) and how they magnify the effects of the radial flow. The instabilities take the form of pairs of counter-rotating toroidal vortices superseded by helical ones as the axial flow is increased. Increasing the radial inflow draws these vortices near the inner cylinder, where they shrink relative to the annular gap, when this gap is wide. Strong axial and radial flows in a narrow annular gap lead to a very large azimuthal wavenumber with steeply sloped helical vortices. Strong radial outflow in a wide annular gap results in very large helical vortices. The analytical and numerical saturated vortices match quite well. In addition, radial inflows or outflows can turn the usually supercritical bifurcation from laminar to vortical flow into a subcritical one. The radial flow above which this change occurs decreases as the radius ratio eta decreases. A practical motivation for this weakly nonlinear analysis is found in modelling dynamic filtration devices, which rely on vortical instabilities to reduce the processes of accumulation on their membranes...|$|R
40|$|Salinity’ is an emotive term {{which has}} come to {{represent}} in many people’s minds the damage that farmers have done to the bush {{as a result of}} their clearing and agricultural activities. In reality, this is not such a straightforward explanation. Although it is true, farmers did clear the land, which eventually caused salt scalds to form and land to die, the state government and its agencies must also be considered a major proponent in the equation. Government policies with regard to clearing requirements and creating farms in fragile environments, and their subsequent inability to find ‘the’ solution is a matter of record. This book examines the way Harry Whittington found a solution to his own land degradation problems at Springhill, Brookton in Western Australia and and the formation of WISALTS (Whittington Interceptor Sustainable Agriculture Land Treatment Society) who promote his technology – Whittington Interceptor Banks. The banks are designed to capture rainwater where it falls by controlling surface and sub-surface <b>throughflows,</b> so that moisture can be utilised throughout the soil profile, thus preventing waterlogging and dead soil in valley floors.

40|$|A {{computationally}} efficient, intermediate complexity ocean-atmosphere-sea ice model (C-GOLDSTEIN) {{has been}} incorporated into the Grid ENabled Integrated Earth system modelling (GENIE) framework. This involved decoupling of the three component modules that were re-coupled in a modular way, to allow replacement with alternatives and coupling of further components within the framework. The climate model described here (referred to as "eb_go_gs" for short) is the most basic version of GENIE in which atmosphere, ocean and sea ice all play an active role. Among improvements on the original C-GOLDSTEIN model, latitudinal grid resolution is generalized to allow {{a wider range of}} surface grids to be used. The ocean, atmosphere and sea-ice components of the "eb_go_gs" configuration of GENIE are individually described, along with details of their coupling. The setup and results from simulations using four different meshes are presented. The four alternative meshes comprise the widely-used 36 × 36 equal-area-partitioning of the Earth surface with 16 depth layers in the ocean, a version in which horizontal and vertical resolution are doubled, a setup matching the horizontal resolution of the dynamic atmospheric component available in the GENIE framework, and a setup with enhanced resolution in high-latitude areas. Results are presented for a spin-up experiment with a baseline parameter set and wind forcing typically used for current studies in which "eb_go_gs" is coupled with the ocean biogeochemistry module of GENIE, as well as for an experiment with a modified parameter set, revised wind forcing, and additional cross-basin transport pathways (Indonesian and Bering Strait <b>throughflows).</b> The latter experiment is repeated with the four mesh variants, with common parameter settings throughout, except for time-step length. Selected state variables and diagnostics are compared in two regards: (i) between simulations at lowest resolution that are obtained with the baseline and modified configurations, predominantly in order to evaluate the revision of the wind forcing, the modification of some key parameters, and the effect of additional transport pathways across the Arctic Ocean and the Indonesian Archipelago; (ii) between simulations with the four meshes, in order to explore various effects of mesh choice. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{gravity station}} network was {{established}} over the Tucson Basin on a nominal one mile spacing {{for the purpose}} of determining major hydrologic boundaries. Gravity data were supplemented by magnetic, seismic, and borehole geophysical data. Gravity data reveal a marked linearity of pattern which in general correlates with structural trends previously noted in the area. Based on surface geological data, radiometric dating, and the present survey, it is suggested that the Tucson basin began to form in mid-Tertiary time under tensional stresses. As the circum-basin mountain blocks rose, the Tucson basin was gradually filled by the Pantano formation and its equivalents. Around the margins these were alluvial fan deposits which graded laterally into each other and into playa deposits in the central basin. During the Pliocene Epoch this pattern of internal drainage was disrupted and Pantano deposition ended with the inception of a period of erosion. Deposition of later sediments coincided with external drainage and <b>throughflowing</b> streams. The late-Tertiary and Quaternary sediments probably have been faulted to a minor degree by continuing movement along basement structures or by differential compaction over basement topography. The extent to which this affects groundwater gradients {{is a function of the}} percentage of coarse material in the aquifer. Further complications in development of these upper aquifers may be due to igneous dikes and to buried glide blocks of relatively impermeable sediments. The Pantano aquifers are probably broken into relatively small, autonomous hydrologic units by near-vertical fault systems. During this study two new applications of geophysical data were used to analyze basin hydrology. Using Gauss' Theorem the total mass deficiency of the basin was determined and from this a total water content of 129 cubic miles was calculated. The second application involved the use of a borehole density log to calculate the aquifer storage coefficient and revealed a probable value of 0. 05, much lower than previously estimated...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Macrophytes may {{constitute}} an important resource for several chemical, physical and biological processes within aquatic ecosystems. This study considers that in tropical reservoirs with low retention time and with low values of shoreline development (DL), the expansion and persistence of aquatic macrophytes are mainly reported to local conditions (e. g., hydrodynamic and wind exposure) rather than trophic status {{and depth of}} the euphotic zone. In this context, this study aimed at describing and comparing the incidence of aquatic macrophytes in a <b>throughflowing,</b> non-dendritic tropical reservoir. During February 2006 to November 2007, eight limnological surveys were performed quarterly within the Ourinhos Reservoir, and in the mouth areas of its tributaries. At the six sampling stations 30 variables were measured. The number of sites with plants varied between 21 and 38 {{and at the end}} of the 1 st year the total richness was found. The sampling survey outcome the recognition of 18 species of aquatic macrophytes; Cyperaceae (2 genera and 1 species), Pontederiaceae (3 species) and Onarograceae (3 genera) were the families with higher diversity. Seven species (Typha domingensis Pers., Myriophyllum aquaticum (Vell.) Verdec, Salvinia auriculata Aubl., Eichhornia azurea (Sw.) Kunth, Eleocharis sp 1, Eichhornia crassipes (Mart.) Solms, Oxycaryum cubense (Poepp. & Kunth) Lye) always were present and were more frequent in the sites. The occurrence of emergent species predominated (45. 9 %), followed by submersed rooted (24. 5 %), free floating (19. 5 %), floating rooted (9. 7 %) and free submersed (0. 3 %). Although limnological variables and the distribution of macrophytes have discriminated the same sampling points, the stepwise multiple linear regressions did not pointed out strong correspondences (or coherence) among the most constant and distributed macrophyte species and the selected limnological variables, as well the trophic statuses. Seeing the low relationship among limnological variables and macrophytes distribution, in the case of Ourinhos Reservoir, the results pointed out that the water turbulence, low DL and wind exposure are the main driving forces that determine its aquatic plant distribution, life forms and species composition...|$|R

40|$|The use of {{herbicides}} {{in agriculture}} {{may lead to}} environmental problems, such as surface water pollution, with a potential risk for aquatic organisms. The herbicide glyphosate is the most used active ingredient {{in the world and}} in Switzerland. In the Lavaux vineyards it is nearly the only molecule applied. This work aimed at studying its fate in soils and its transfer to surface waters, using a multi-scale approach: from molecular (10 - 9 m) and microscopic scales (10 - 6 m), to macroscopic (m) and landscape ones (103 m). First of all, an analytical method was developed for the trace level quantification of this widely used herbicide and its main by-product, aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA). Due to their polar nature, their derivatization with 9 -fluorenylmethyl chloroformate (FMOC-Cl) was done prior to their concentration and purification by solid phase extraction. They were then analyzed by ultra performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). The method was tested in different aqueous matrices with spiking tests and validated for the matrix effect correction in relevant environmental samples. Calibration curves established between 10 and 1000 ng/l showed r 2 values above 0. 989, mean recoveries varied between 86 and 133 % and limits of detection and quantification of the method were as low as 5 and 10 ng/l respectively. At the parcel scale, two parcels of the Lavaux vineyard area, located near the Lutrive River at 6 km to the east of Lausanne, were monitored to assess to which extent glyphosate and AMPA were retained in the soil or exported to surface waters. They were equipped at their bottom with porous ceramic cups and runoff collectors, which allowed retrieving water samples for the growing seasons 2010 and 2011. Results revealed that the mobility of glyphosate and AMPA in the unsaturated zone was likely driven by the precipitation regime and the soil characteristics, such as slope, porosity structure and layer permeability discrepancy. Elevated glyphosate and AMPA concentrations were measured at 60 and 80 cm depth at parcel bottoms, suggesting their infiltration in the upper parts of the parcels and the presence of preferential flow in the studied parcels. Indeed, the succession of rainy days induced the gradual saturation of the soil porosity, leading to rapid infiltration through macropores, as well as surface runoff formation. Furthermore, the presence of more impervious weathered marls at 100 cm depth induced <b>throughflows,</b> the importance of which for the lateral transport of the herbicide molecules was determined by the slope steepness. Important rainfall events (> 10 mm/day) were clearly exporting molecules from the soil top layer, as indicated by important concentrations in runoff samples. A mass balance showed that total loss (10 - 20 %) mainly occurred through surface runoff (96 %) and, to a minor extent, by <b>throughflows</b> in soils (4 %), with subsequent exfiltration to surface waters. Observations made in the Lutrive River revealed interesting details of glyphosate and AMPA dynamics in urbanized landscapes, such as the Lavaux vineyards. Indeed, besides their physical and chemical properties, herbicide dynamics at the catchment level strongly depend on application rates, precipitation regime, land use and also on the presence of drains or constructed channels. Elevated concentrations, up to 4970 ng/l, observed just after the application, confirmed the diffuse export of these compounds from the vineyard area by surface runoff during main rain events. From April to September 2011, a total load of 7. 1 kg was calculated, with 85 % coming from vineyards and minor urban sources and 15 % from arable crops. Small vineyard surfaces could generate high concentrations of herbicides and contribute considerably to the total load calculated at the outlet, due to their steep slopes (~ 10 %). The extrapolated total amount transferred yearly from the Lavaux vineyards to the Lake of Geneva was of 190 kg. At the molecular scale, the possible involvement of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in glyphosate and copper transport was studied using UV/Vis fluorescence spectroscopy. Combined with parallel factor (PARAFAC) analysis, this technique allowed characterizing DOM of soil and surface water samples from the studied vineyard area. Glyphosate concentrations were linked to the fulvic-like spectroscopic signature of DOM in soil water samples, as well as to copper, suggesting the formation of ternary complexes. In surface water samples, its concentrations were also correlated to copper ones, but not in a significant way to the fulvic-like signature. Quenching experiments with standards confirmed field tendencies in the laboratory, with a stronger decrease in fluorescence intensity for fulvic-like fluorophore than for more aromatic ones. Lastly, based on maximum concentrations measured in the river, an environmental risk for these compounds was assessed, using laboratory tests and ecotoxicity data from the literature. In our case and with the methodology applied, the risk towards aquatic species was found negligible (RF< 1) ...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the limnology of two small dams (< 5 ha) built in series on Munwahuku river. Very {{little is known about}} the ecology of such small water bodies and the hydrological regime of these dams is that they undergo severe fluctuations in water levels. Rainfall is seasonal but water demand for irrigation and potable water persist throughout the year. The theoretical mean water residence time was 9 days for the Upper dam and 3. 6 days for the Lower one while the water level in the Upper dam fluctuated more than the Lower one. Thermal stratification established during summer in the dams but was weak during winter. Stratification was poorly established during the main rainy season (Jan-April) and this could be the result of <b>throughflows</b> causing disruptions. Oxygen stratification patterns were similar to those of temperature and deoxygenation sometimes occurred in summer. Seasonal trends were related to changes in solar radiation income and the corresponding changes in air temperatures. The Lower dam was less stable during summer than the Upper one and this could largely be a result of short water residence time which influenced development of thermal stratification. Diurnal stratification of temperature and oxygen occurred in both dams during summer but was less established in winter. The shallow nature of small dams suggests that they are more vulnerable to external fluxes such daily changes in temperature, wind runs and any other disturbances and hence the prevalence of diel stratification because of low stability. The water and aspects of sediment chemistry of the dams was investigated in relation to influence of the hydrological regime. The two small dams were not significantly different in water chemistry but their sediment chemistry showed some differences. Seasonal fluctuations in conductivity, TDS, TSS and Secchi disc transparency were strongly linked to the hydrological regime to the effects of the first rains while increases in BOD and COD suggested increased organic matter at low water levels. There were no dramatic seasonal variations in pH, alkalinity, nitrate, nitrite, ammonia and total nitrogen although the latter tended to be higher in the Upper dam. Short water residence time was attributed as the main factor resulting in small differences in the water quality of the two dams. In the Upper dam, sediment silt content was higher in the drawdown zone while clay was significantly higher in the permanently inundated zone. There were no major seasonal variations in nitrogen, phosphorus and carbon content in the zones but their values were consistently higher in the deeper zone. In contrast, clay, nitrogen, phosphorus and carbon content were significantly different between the two zones in the Lower dam and were higher in the drawdown zone except clay. The community structure of zooplankton and phytoplankton populations was studied. Zooplankton abundance was not very different between the two dams with peaks during the late dry season attributed to a sudden abundance of rotifers. A similar pattern was observed for phytoplankton abundance and biomass with peaks around October 2000 but generally higher abundance was measured in the bottom dam. There was a complete shift in the dominant zooplankton and phytoplankton taxa in both dams after October 2000. A major factor influencing plankton abundance was washout during the main rainy season whilst water transparency, suspended solids, water temperature were factors identified by CCA analysis as important for zooplankton community structure in both dams. CCA analysis revealed that physico-chemical variables were not significant in determining phytoplankton communities in both dams perhaps superseded by hydrological processes. The effects of grazing on phytoplankton by zooplankton and predation on zooplankton by fish were not assessed but could be factors influencing community dynamics. Six fish species were caught in both dams during the entire sampling. The dominant species numerically was B. paludinosus and C. gariepinus in either dam but C. gariepinus contributed the greatest proportion of the total catch weight at most times. The cyprinids B. lineomaculatus and B. trimaculatus were caught in small numbers and so were the cichlids, O. mossambicus and T. sparrmanii. This species composition is perhaps largely determined by the fish community in the river and the shallow nature and frequent fluctuations in water level do not allow for specialized habitats to develop in small dams hence promoting diversity. Water retention is very short in these dams and so they could be little difference with the main river. The highest proportion of breeding B. paludinosus was during the rainy season and consequently relative fecundity was highest at that time. Migration, spawning events and recruitment events were not easily discernable in the fish populations of either dam. The high turbidity when water levels were low did not appear to have adverse effects on the fish community in either dam...|$|R

Weaker flow of saltier and denser South Pacific water passes over the Lifamatola Passage into the Banda Sea, where these water masses are mixed due to tidal effects, Ekman pumping, and heat and fresh water flux at the ocean surface. From the Banda Sea the ITF exits Timor, Ombai, and Lombok passages.|$|E
50|$|Because {{the soil}} biomantle {{is the main}} zone of bioturbation, it is {{invariably}} permeable and of low density. It thus plays several essential hydropedological roles in the environment. For example, it promotes the downward percolation of rainwater and snowmelt through often-abundant biochannels and interconnected biopores. The biomantle also promotes downslope soil-water (<b>throughflow,</b> interflow) movements if it is formed above a clay-enriched Bt (argillic) horizon, or above some other dense subsoil horizon (e.g., duripan, fragipan, etc.) or bedrock - all of which generally function as aquitards or aquicludes to vertical soil water flow. In such cases the stonelayer, if present, can actually function as an aquifer for free water flow. Hence {{it is not uncommon}} to see soil water seepage above Bt horizons on slopes where soil stonelayers outcrop. Ground water recharge can occur through any of these biomantle-related processes. Recharge, of course, can also occur when the soil dries appreciably and shrinks, as during droughts, which allows vertical leakage to temporarily occur immediately after drought-breaking rainfalls.|$|E
50|$|The River Wansbeck Valley is {{narrow and}} steep {{and as a}} {{consequence}} has exaggerated amounts of surface runoff. Based on three storm events, a reliable flow gauge located upstream of Morpeth at the confluence of the Wansbeck and Font showed that 56% of rain fall is converted into surface runoff. Because the soil was already saturated {{as a result of the}} wet summer, the effect of surface runoff was greatly enhanced. Furthermore, increased urbanisation since the 1960s in Morpeth meant that most water falling on the town would have drained directly to the river channel. Other tests investigating the catchment lag time (time lapse between the midpoint of storm rainfall and peak river level) indicate that the Wansbeck has a LAG time of only 8 hours. This means that any water falling in the catchment area would have been rapidly converted into channel flow by surface runoff and to a lesser extent by <b>throughflow.</b> This is due to the steepness of the valley and the soil composition.|$|E

During the weak LC, there is the possibility of reduced intensity of the Indian winter monsoon and strong summer monsoon, because of change in the Indian Ocean dipole due to reduction in net heat input to the Indian Ocean through the Indonesian through flow. Thus a better understanding of the possible links between El Niño, Western Pacific Warm Pool, Indonesian <b>Throughflow,</b> wind pattern off western Australia, and ice volume expansion and contraction can be obtained by studying the behaviour of the LC during Quaternary at close stratigraphic intervals.|$|E
