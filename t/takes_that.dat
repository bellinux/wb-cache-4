25|$|A second work of fiction, {{provisionally}} titled Crazy House: Further Adventures in Chicago, contains over 10,000 handwritten pages. Written after The Realms, it <b>takes</b> <b>that</b> epic's major characters—the seven Vivian {{sisters and}} their companion/secret brother, Penrod—and places them in Chicago, with the action unfolding {{during the same}} years {{as that of the}} earlier book. Begun in 1939, it is a tale of a house that is possessed by demons and haunted by ghosts, or has an evil consciousness of its own. Children disappear into the house and are later found brutally murdered. The Vivians and Penrod are sent to investigate and discover that the murders are the work of evil ghosts. The girls go about exorcising the place, but have to resort to arranging for a full-scale Holy Mass to be held in each room before the house is clean. They do this repeatedly, but it never works. The narrative ends mid-scene, with Darger having just been rescued from the Crazy House.|$|E

Rajinikanth also selected {{the part of the}} song where Ravikumar would make his appearance. After reluctantly agreeing to do the part, a scene was filmed featuring Rajinikanth and Ravikumar. Rajinikanth said he felt the shot did not look right, and re-takes for Ravikumar's sequence were done. After the re-takes were completed, Rajinikanth admitted that the first sequence was fine. When Ravikumar asked the cameraman why he had not told him earlier, the cameraman replied by saying that Rajinikanth wanted Ravikumar to do seven takes, to teach him a lesson for all the <b>takes</b> <b>that</b> Ravikumar had required of Rajinikanth.|$|E

[...] Kate Flannery did her stunts in the scene where Pam throws a football and hits Customer and Supplier Relations worker Meredith Palmer (Flannery) in the face. Flannery had a stunt double on the set, but she was never needed for the scene. Kate recalls that she [...] "didn't get a scratch in all 14 <b>takes</b> <b>that</b> we shot."

500|$|Glee costume {{designer}} Lou Eyrich described Rachel's costuming {{in an interview}} with Entertainment Weekly, [...] "Originally, the inspiration for her look was Tracy Flick from Election—very buttoned-down, preppy, obnoxious, squeaky clean, nerdy. But she's got at least 12 costume changes each episode. That same look all the time just gets boring for the screen and for the actress to wear, so we spread it out a lot. We try to have her buttoned-up or wearing a nerdy sweater over a cute dress, like she doesn't quite get it right. Or she <b>takes</b> <b>that</b> sweater and tucks it into the skirt and pairs it with knee highs and flats. She makes it her way, which is more quirky.

500|$|During the shooting, {{the crew}} had some {{problems}} in filming some scenes.

[...] He further said that they were really worried about a scene regarding a lone horse running down a Los Angeles street: [...] "We only had three <b>takes</b> <b>that</b> we had time to do. The first take it went sideways, second take it went the other way. Third take? Perfect." [...] Leto described the experience of filming the music video saying, [...] "It's a lyrical and slightly metaphorical surreal journey through the city of Angels, from downtown Los Angeles to Santa Monica Pier. We like to create an adventure and this has been an adventure. [...] This is what we were supposed to do. And I doubted the idea up until the very last minute, but the process has been phenomenal."

[...] Scott said, [...] "I got the crew together and said, 'Okay guys, here we go. This {{is going to be}} a lot more vampy and fun,' and cranked up the ghetto blaster with rock music and away we went." [...] Because of the subject, Scott was able to increase the episode's level of sexual content. [...] Scott said, [...] "we did two <b>takes</b> <b>that</b> were on the edge of tasteful vampire sexuality, and we did a third take where Lucy really let loose. Of course, we all died laughing and said, 'Okay, that one is never going to make it to the screen'; we definitely pushed it too far!" [...] Ultimately, Scott felt that [...] "if you pull it too far out of context and try to take it seriously, it's a bit too rock video at times." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{director}} also {{hinted at}} a parallelism between {{the video and}} its short film Solipsist, which was released weeks before the shooting of [...] "Mutual Core" [...] video: [...] " [...] is a metaphor between earth’s crust and two people converging, and the effort that it <b>takes,</b> <b>that</b> was also what Solipsist was about, so working together made sense". The video was shot in Reykjavík in over two days. The director wrote the initial treatment for the video after visiting museums in London. The video features a mix of CG pictures and real natural elements, gathered by the team from different location in Iceland. The floating rocks in the video are made from foam and covered in plaster, fossilized barnacles and various textiles, the rock's tongues and the sand are computer animated; for this reason, the post-production lasted two months. Björk's face motion was tracked in CG for the video, in which {{it appears to be}} melt in the rocks. Her costumes were inspired by Thai and Indonesian costumes, while the substance which resembles magma that she appears to spit in the video was a computer-modified mixture of ketchup and cake batter.|$|E
500|$|Oblivion {{received}} universal acclaim from critics, {{and became}} a commercial success. The game had shipped 1.7million copies by April 10, 2006, sold over 3million copies by January 2007, and over 3.5 million by November 2011. Electronic Entertainment Design and Research, a market research firm, estimates that the game has sold 9.5 million copies worldwide. Reviewers praised the game for its impressive graphics, expansive game world and schedule-driven NPCs. Eurogamer editor Kristan Reed stated that the game [...] "successfully unites {{some of the best}} elements of RPG, adventure and action games and fuses them into a relentlessly immersive and intoxicating whole". GameSpot's Greg Kasavin wrote that compared to Morrowind, {{which was one of the}} best role-playing games he has seen in years, [...] "Oblivion is hands-down better, so much so that even those who'd normally have no interest in a role-playing game should find it hard to resist getting swept up in this big, beautiful, meticulously crafted world". X-Plays Jason D'Aprile stated, [...] "All the games in this series have been known for their sheer vastness and freedom of choice, but the Elder Scrolls IV <b>takes</b> <b>that</b> concept and runs with it".|$|E
500|$|On a $25 million budget, {{principal}} photography {{took place}} over three months between June and August 1993. Filming regularly required up to 18-hour workdays, six days a week. Freeman described filming as tense, saying, [...] "Most of the time, the tension was between the cast and director. I remember having a bad moment with the director, had a few of those." [...] Freeman referred to Darabont's requiring multiple takes of scenes which he considered had no discernible differences. For example, the scene where Andy first approaches Red to procure a rock hammer took nine hours to film. The scene featured Freeman throwing and catching a baseball with another inmate throughout it. The number of <b>takes</b> <b>that</b> were shot resulted in Freeman turning up to filming the following day with his arm in a sling. Freeman sometimes simply refused to do the additional takes. Robbins said that the long days were difficult. Darabont felt that making the film taught him a lot, [...] "A director really needs to have an internal barometer to measure what any given actor needs." [...] He found his most frequent struggles were with Deakins. Darabont favored more scenic shots, while Deakins felt that not showing {{the outside of the}} prison added a sense of claustrophobia, and it meant that when a wide scenic shot was used, it had more impact.|$|E

500|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began on}} November 11, 2012 in New Orleans, Louisiana. Filming also {{took place in}} Baton Rouge. Jennifer Garner has stated that the film was shot very quickly over just 25 days and has remarked that McConaughey [...] "gave an even wilder performance in <b>takes</b> <b>that</b> didn't appear onscreen". McConaughey stated that [...] "I was riding {{a new way of}} making a film. There were no lights, one camera, 15-minute takes." [...] Half of the shots were lit with artificial light and the other half were not. Vallée said: [...] "I now had a perfect opportunity to try to shoot an entire movie without artificial lights, using the Alexa digital camera. Like the RED, the Alexa offers a broad spectrum of colors and shadows in even the darkest natural lighting conditions. I felt that the approach was right for this project. The look and feel became that we were capturing reality; even though Dallas Buyers Club is not a documentary in content or structure, it could have that subtle quality. We shot the movie 100% handheld with two lenses, a 35-millimeter and a 50-millimeter. These get close to the actors and don't skew the images. (Director of Photography) Yves Belanger adjusted for every shot at 400 or 1600 ASA (light sensitivity), displaying different color balance." ...|$|E
500|$|According to the musicologist Walter Everett, Sgt. Pepper {{marks the}} {{beginning}} of McCartney's ascendancy as the Beatles' dominant creative force. He wrote {{more than half of the}} album's material while asserting increasing control over the recording of his compositions. He would from this point on provide the artistic direction for the group's releases. Sessions began on 24 November 1966 in Abbey Road Studio Two, the first time that the Beatles had come together since September. Afforded the luxury of a nearly limitless recording budget, they booked open-ended sessions that allowed them to work as late as they wanted. They began with three songs that were thematically linked to their childhoods: [...] "Strawberry Fields Forever", [...] "When I'm Sixty-Four" [...] and [...] "Penny Lane". The first session saw the introduction of a new keyboard instrument called the Mellotron, the keys of which triggered tape-recordings of a variety of instruments, enabling its user to play keyboard parts using those voices. McCartney performed the introduction to [...] "Strawberry Fields Forever" [...] using the flute setting. The track's complicated production involved the innovative splicing of two <b>takes</b> <b>that</b> were recorded in different tempos and pitches. Emerick remembers that during the recording of Revolver, [...] "we had got used to being asked to do the impossible, and we knew that the word 'no' didn't exist in the Beatles' vocabulary." [...] In Martin's opinion, Sgt. Pepper [...] "grew naturally out of Revolver", marking [...] "an era of almost continuous technological experimentation".|$|E
500|$|An {{immediate}} focus during pre-production was Deadpool's suit, with Russ Shinkle and Film Illusions hired {{to create the}} costume. Shinkle noted that [...] "comic book art is fairly over the top in terms of physique", {{and he tried to}} balance that with reality. Reynolds did not wear a muscle suit under the costume, which Tim Miller felt gave the costume a slimmer, [...] "quintessential Deadpool" [...] look. Miller and Reynolds wept when they saw the completed costume, with Reynolds explaining that [...] "we fought like hell ... to make this the most faithful comic book to movie adaptation fans have ever seen. That’s hard to accomplish and a feat, but we’re just so happy with how this came out." [...] The costume was designed with the film's stunts in mind, with the eye areas on the mask removable so versions of the eyes better suited for the stunts could be used without changing the whole mask. The suit was difficult for the visual effects team to replicate with CGI, which visual effects supervisor Jonathan Rothbart blamed on its fabric. He described it as mesh that allowed dirt to [...] "get into the gutters and the cracks ... the light hits it, it still <b>takes</b> <b>that</b> orangey hue but as soon as it goes in the shadow it dropped to this more blueish of the dirt." [...] Film Illusions made six hero versions of the costume and twelve stunt-specific versions, along with three hero versions of Negasonic Teenage Warhead's costume.|$|E
