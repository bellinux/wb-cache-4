5|$|Regarding Stiller's long wins, Tim Krabbé {{struck a}} similar note: A {{grandmaster}} wouldn't {{be better at}} these endgames than someone who had learned chess yesterday. It's a sort of chess <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> do with chess, a chess that we could never have imagined without computers. The Stiller moves are awesome, almost scary, because you know they are the truth, God's Algorithm – it's like being revealed the Meaning of Life, but you don't understand one word.|$|E
25|$|The {{justification}} Unicode gives is {{that the}} national standards body in the PRC made unique codepoints for the two variations of the first character 內/内, whereas Korea never made separate codepoints for the unique variants of 全. There is a reason for this <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> do with how the domestic bodies view the characters themselves. China went through a process {{in the twentieth century}} that changed (if not simplified) several characters. During this transition, there was a need to be able encode both variants within the same document. Korean has always used the variant of 全 with the 入 (U+5165) radical on top. Therefore, it had no reason to encode both variants. Korean language documents made in the twentieth century had little reason to represent both versions in the same document.|$|E
25|$|The fact of {{the matter}} is that we’re in our thirties now and that breakup {{happened}} ten years ago. As a human being you just don't want that kind of karma. We did a lot of shit talking, and they did a lot of shit talking, so I just called everybody up and invited them to my house and said ‘hey, listen, we’re in our thirties now, I’m sorry for whatever I said, I'm sure you guys didn’t mean what you said–you guys were upset because I split up the band and we were upset because of whatever. Let’s be friends again. But do I want to reunite and play fucking 15-year old songs? Well, it would be like asking you, ‘do you want to get back together with your first girlfriend?’ You learn some amazing things together, but I just shudder at the thought. We were a band that went out on top, which is good, but it’s just a coincidence. We were also a band that had been together for seven years, and for six of those years played to nobody and had a great time but were also on the verge of splitting up many times before that. It’s an old relationship. People would like to think of it as unfinished business because to them we went out when we were most popular, but <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> do with the creative element. As far as the creative element went, it very much was finished business. That’s why I ended the band! Now, thank god, fucking ten years later, we're not holding a grudge and we’re all cool with it. People pick up on the difference of attitude and think 'oh, this could mean a possible reunion', but that’s just them projecting their own desires upon us.|$|E

500|$|Mango Yellow {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from English-speaking reviewers.

A The Village Voice reviewer described the characters as [...] "babbling caricatures" [...] and the film as a [...] "shallow Brazilian trifle". Young called Nachtergaele a [...] "standout" [...] as [...] "He embodies the film's savage over-the-topness without flattening out {{as some of the}} other characters do." [...] Although praising its cinematography, Keith Phipps of The A.V. Club said it is [...] "a film <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> say". Sragow, Young, and Fox also praised Carvalho's work; Fox said it is [...] "awdry stuff ... but it's glorious to look at". In Sragow's opinion, the penultimate scene—the montage—"boasts an eloquence that eclipses everything else in the movie". Holden found the characters to be [...] "robust, full-dimensional people" [...] and praised the film's [...] "surreal flavor".

500|$|Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian was disappointed, {{arguing that}} [...] "All the story's power {{is allowed to}} leak away by the deliberative {{heaviness}} with which Rivette pads through his 150-minute narrative, with its exasperating lack of dramatic emphasis." [...] Philip French noted similarities to Hitchcock's Vertigo and Jean Cocteau's Orphée, but called it [...] "surprisingly flat and unmagical". The New York Times also found it [...] "dry and overdetermined," [...] and Time Out complained that it [...] "never supplies the frissons expected of a ghost story or the emotional draw of a good love story." [...] Film 4 compared it to The Sixth Sense and The Others, but said that [...] "its glacially slow pace will frustrate {{all but the most}} patient". (Rivette said when promoting the film that [...] "I like The Sixth Sense because the final twist doesn't challenge everything that went before it. You can see it again, which I did, and it's a second film that's just as logical as the first one. But the end of The Others made the rest of it meaningless.") [...] "An intellectual exercise in metaphysical romance - Ghost for art-house audiences" [...] was Empire wry take. The Digital Fix argued that Rivette's direction resulted in a product that [...] "if never exactly dull and certainly the work of a master, is ultimately an empty film <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> offer but its own cleverness". Keith Uhlich of Slant Magazine found it was [...] "a lesser Rivette offering — a watchable, ultimately unfulfilling ghost story".|$|E
