5|$|The {{upper reaches}} of the {{watershed}} of Scotch Run, upstream of Mifflin Cross Roads, are predominantly forested land. However, there are some residential areas near the headwaters of the stream. Downstream of Mifflin Cross Roads, the watershed contains both forested land and agricultural land. The forested land occurs primarily on the valley slopes, while the bottom of the valley contains a number of small farms. A road known as Scotch Valley Drive follows the stream's general direction up valley of the stream. A road known as LR 19015 also runs alongside <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>stream</b> for some distance.|$|E
5|$|Seventy-three bais, or forest clearings, {{have been}} {{discovered}} in Nki National Park. In April 2006, while looking for elephant groups, a WWF team discovered the largest bai in the region, Ikwa Bai. Dr. Mike Loomis, {{a member of the}} group, confirmed that this bai is slightly larger than Dzanga Sangha Bai (Central African Republic), which had previously held the record. He also reported little human development adjacent to the bai, and noticed 21 elephants and 16 buffaloes in it simultaneously. The bai has a small creek running through its center, which sits atop a bed of rocks and sand. A large mineral pit is located next <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>stream.</b> It is the habitat of several wildlife species, the largest-numbering being chimpanzees, elephants, buffaloes, and gorillas.|$|E

5|$|Some of {{the species}} in the {{freshwater}} mussel family, Unionidae, commonly known as pocketbook mussels, have evolved an unusual reproductive strategy. The female's mantle protrudes from the shell and develops into an imitation small fish, complete with fish-like markings and false eyes. This decoy moves in the current and attracts the attention of real fish. Some fish see the decoy as prey, while others see a conspecific. They approach {{for a closer look}} and the mussel releases huge numbers of larvae from its gills, dousing the inquisitive fish with its tiny, parasitic young. These glochidia larvae are drawn into the fish's gills, where they attach and trigger a tissue response that forms a small cyst around each larva. The larvae then feed by breaking down and digesting the tissue of the fish within the cysts. After a few weeks they release themselves from the cysts and fall <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>stream</b> bed as juvenile molluscs. The fish are relatively unharmed.|$|E

25|$|The cell {{suspension}} is entrained {{in the center}} of a narrow, rapidly flowing stream of liquid. The flow is arranged so that there is a large separation between cells relative to their diameter. A vibrating mechanism causes the stream of cells to break into individual droplets. The system is adjusted so that there is a low probability of more than one cell per droplet. Just before the stream breaks into droplets, the flow passes through a fluorescence measuring station where the fluorescent character of each cell of interest is measured. An electrical charging ring is placed just at the point where the stream breaks into droplets. A charge is placed on the ring based immediately prior to fluorescence intensity being measured, and the opposite charge is trapped on the droplet as it breaks from the stream. The charged droplets then fall through an electrostatic deflection system that diverts droplets into containers based upon their charge. In some systems, the charge is applied directly <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>stream,</b> and the droplet breaking off retains charge of the same sign as the stream. The stream is then returned to neutral after the droplet breaks off.|$|E
25|$|Stable isotope {{analysis}} of xylem {{water can be}} used to follow the movement of water from soil into the plants and therefore provide a record of the depth of water acquisition. An advantage to using xylem water is that in theory, the deuterium content should directly reflect the input water without being affected by leaf transpiration. For example, Dawson and Ehleringer used this approach to determine whether trees that grow next to streams are using the surface waters from that stream. Water from the surface would have the same isotopic composition as the stream, while water from farther below in the ground would be from past precipitation inputs. In this case, younger trees had a xylem water isotopic composition very close to the adjacent stream and likely used surface waters to get established. Older trees had depleted xylem water relative <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>stream,</b> reflecting that they source their water from deeper underground. Other stable isotope studies have also determined that plants in redwood forests do not just take up water from their roots but acquire a significant proportion of water via stomatal uptake on leaves.|$|E
25|$|The {{border between}} East and West Berlin was also {{significantly}} tightened, {{although it was}} not fully closed at this stage. By the end of September 1952, about 200 of the 277 streets which ran from the Western sectors to the East were closed to traffic and the remainder were subjected to constant police observation. Railway traffic was routed around the Western sectors and all employees of nationalised factories had to pledge not to visit West Berlin on pain of dismissal. However, even with these restrictions the border in Berlin remained considerably easier to cross than the main inner German border; consequently, Berlin became the main route by which East Germans left for the West. The outflow of people remained considerable despite the new restrictions. Between 1949and the building of the Berlin Wall in 1961, an estimated 3.5million East Germans– a sixth of East Germany's entire population– emigrated to the West. Events such as the crushing of the 1953 uprising and the shortages caused by the introduction of collectivisation resulted in major increases in refugee numbers. In August 1961, the Berlin Wall was built, finally putting an end <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>stream</b> of refugees. With the erection of the Wall, Berlin quickly went from being the easiest place to make an unauthorized crossing between East and West Germany to being the most difficult.|$|E

25|$|The video {{starts with}} Lightbody, {{who wears a}} dark coat, a grey polo neck sweater, and trousers. He sings as he pushes an old {{motorcycle}} across a farmer's field at dusk. As darkness falls, he abandons the bike and enters a wood. He walks through it, until he descends a short hill and stays in a stream. As the chorus begins, Lightbody lights a distress firelight, he moves it in circles as he sings. In a bridge behind him, two members from Snow Patrol light two flares and move them as well. When the chorus ends, Lighbody throws his flare to the water, in which it continues shining. Lightbody returns to the forest and he sings while he walks. Later, he ascends to a plain, where another two members ignite two distress firelights as the second verse ends. With the flares, they run and move them in circles, and then, they throw them to each other. Nathan Connolly, who wears a grey hoodie, appears riding the motorcycle Lightbody dumped. He drives it in zigzag with the other men. As the video ends, he goes <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>stream,</b> where the motorbike starts to throw smoke; Connolly gets off it, and it fires. The burning bike rolls downhill and it falls into the stream, where it sinks, with the fire being extinguished.|$|E
25|$|Newcomb's snail {{probably}} shares {{life history}} similarities {{with other members}} of its family. Lymnaeid snails generally feed on algae and vegetation growing on submerged rocks. Snails attach eggs to submerged rocks or vegetation and larval stages do not disperse widely; the entire life cycle is tied <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>stream</b> system in which the adults live. Little is known about the biological or environmental factors affecting Newcomb's snail population size, however, important factors may include: annual, multi-year, or decadal changes in stream flows; severe weather, high flow, or channel-scouring events; and periods of prolonged drought. Snail dispersal both upstream and downstream within a stream system probably plays an important function in colonizing or recolonizing suitable habitat, particularly microhabitat protected from channel scour. Dispersal of Newcomb's snail between stream systems is likely infrequent because of their obligate freshwater habitat requirements; historic dispersal probably relied on long-term erosional events that captured adjacent stream systems. This life history differs greatly from the freshwater Hawaiian neritid snails (Neritina granosa, Neritina vespertina) that have marine larvae that migrate into and up streams following a period of oceanic dispersal. Most likely, the planktonic larvae of the neritid snails disperse across the oceanic expanses that separate the main Hawaiian Islands and can colonize streams on any or all of these islands. Newcomb's snail lacks this dispersal capacity.|$|E
25|$|Conventional wisdom {{has held}} that beavers girdle and fell trees {{and that they}} {{diminish}} riparian trees and vegetation, but the opposite appears to be true when studies are conducted longer-term. In 1987, Beier reported that beavers had caused local extinction of Quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides) and Black cottonwood (Populus trichocarpa) on 4–5% of stream reaches on the lower Truckee River in the Sierra Nevada mountains; however willow (Salix spp.) responded by regrowing vigorously in most reaches. He further speculated that without control of beaver populations, aspen and cottonwood could go extinct on the Truckee River. Not only have aspen and cottonwood survived ongoing beaver colonization, but {{a recent study of}} ten Sierra Nevada streams in the Lake Tahoe basin using aerial multispectral videography has also shown that deciduous, thick herbaceous, and thin herbaceous vegetation are more highly concentrated near beaver dams, whereas coniferous trees are decreased. These findings are consistent with those of Pollock, who reported that in Bridge Creek, a stream in semiarid eastern Oregon, the width of riparian vegetation on stream banks was increased several-fold as beaver dams watered previously dry terraces adjacent <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>stream.</b> In a second study of riparian vegetation based on observations of Bridge Creek over a 17-year period, although portions of the study reach were periodically abandoned by beaver following heavy utilization of streamside vegetation, within a few years, dense stands of woody plants of greater diversity occupied a larger portion of the floodplain. Although black cottonwood and thinleaf alder did not generally resprout after beaver cutting, they frequently grew from seeds landing on freshly exposed alluvial deposits subsequent to beaver activity. Therefore, beaver appear to increase riparian vegetation given enough years to aggrade sediments and pond heights sufficiently to create widened, well-watered riparian zones, especially in areas of low summer rainfall.|$|E
40|$|Manure and {{fertilizer}} applications can increase soil productivity and land economic values, but the controversial {{result can be}} a decline of water quality due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> increased nutrient exports from soils <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>streams.</b> <b>The</b> impacts of landuse, manure {{and fertilizer}} application on nutrient exports from soils <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>streams</b> were analyzed using the SWAT (Soil Water Assessment Tool) model for the Salmon River watershed in south-central British Columbia, Canada. The {{results showed that the}} animal farms had the highest rates of nutrient exports from soils <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>streams</b> and <b>the</b> natural forested lands had the lowest. It was estimated that the whole Salmon River watershed would export approximately 11. 52 t·yr - 1 of organic nitrogen (ON), 8. 05 t·yr - 1 of nitrate nitrogen (NO 3 -N), 2. 30 t·yr - 1 of organic phosphorus (OP) and 1. 36 t·yr - 1 of soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) if the whole watershed was covered by natural vegetation without human disturbance. Current landuse changes, by converting natural vegetation lands to agriculture and animal farms and associated manure and fertilizer applications, have in-creased approximately 53. 30 t·yr - 1 of ON, 9. 68 t·yr - 1 of NO 3 -N, 22. 69 t·y - 1 of OP and 6. 23 t·y - 1 of SRP exports <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>streams</b> in <b>the</b> whole watershed. The SWAT model predicted that a daily 100 kg·ha - 1 of fresh manure deposit from grazing cows during grazing season from later spring to later fall could increase 2. 57 kg·ha - 1 ·yr - 1 of ON, 0. 39 kg·ha - 1 ·yr - 1 of NO 3 -N, 2. 35 kg·ha - 1 ·yr - 1 of OP and 0. 48 kg·ha - 1 ·yr - 1 of SRP export <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>streams.</b> Fertilization could increase 1. 57 kg ha - 1 yr - 1 of ON and 4. 02 kg·ha - 1 ·yr - 1 of NO 3 -N export <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>streams</b> if 100 kg·ha - 1 ·yr - 1 of nitrogen (NH 4 NO 3) fertilizer was applied in spring.

25|$|Once {{the larvae}} reach their maximum size, {{metamorphosis}} occurs. Sexual maturity is reached in this species at {{three to four}} years old. The adults and juveniles tend to be restricted <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>stream</b> edges, hiding under rocks and other debris during the day. Seasonal migration does occur, but not all individuals undertake them. Research done in Quebec suggests a postbreeding migration into the forest occurs in June. These adult salamanders may move over 100 m from the stream. The second migration is that of the newly metamorphosed juveniles leaving the stream, but they tend to remain closer to it. About 75% of individuals dispersing over 100 m into the forest did not return, and they were believed to have been consumed by predators. The majority of above-ground movements are made after dark and in wet weather. The diets of the adults are more wide-ranging than the larvae because of the amount of habitat that can be exploited, both terrestrial and aquatic. The movements of juveniles and adults usually occurs in the first hour after dark, when they emerge from under their retreats and forage along the stream bank or forest floor. Food items recorded include wood roaches, arachnids, worms, isopods, millipedes, beetles, snails, springtails, flies, hymenopterans, sowbugs, mayflies, annelids, stonefly nymphs, and thrips and rarely trout fry. Adult population densities are variable by habitat quality. Adults are also territorial, so if resources are scarce, the population is less dense. In some populations, densities are as low as 0.02-0.04 animals/m2. In other areas, localized densities can be as high as 11 individuals /m2. Adults overwinter up to 80cm deep into the soil of the stream bank in cold climates, but may remain somewhat active in southern regions, and may continue feeding during this period.|$|E
