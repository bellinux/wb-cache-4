In addition to dropping the word [...] "Daily" [...] from the paper's title, Schroth increased the paper's profile and <b>readership</b> <b>with</b> <b>more</b> active local coverage. The Newspaper Guild went on strike in 1955, with the paper publishing {{what turned out to be}} its last issue on January 29. On March 17, Schroth announced that he had made the [...] "irrevocable" [...] decision to shut down the publication, as the paper had been [...] "destroyed" [...] by the Newspaper Guild and its 47-day-long strike. Efforts by the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service to mediate the dispute had been unsuccessful. Strikers had been seeking increases of $3.40 per week in the first year of the deal and an additional $2.40 in the second year, while Schroth had offered increases of $1.40 and $1.00 per week for each of the two years.|$|R

50|$|At age 21, Wright {{began his}} {{professional}} writing career as literary {{editor of the}} Los Angeles Times, where he {{was known for his}} scathing book reviews and irreverent opinions. He was particularly caustic about romance and detective fiction. His friend and mentor H.L. Mencken was an early inspiration. Other important literary influences included Oscar Wilde and Ambrose Bierce. Wright was an advocate of the naturalism of Theodore Dreiser, and Wright's own novel, The Man of Promise (1916), was written in a similar style. He also published realist fiction as editor of the New York literary magazine The Smart Set, from 1912 to 1914, a job he attained with Mencken's help. He was fired from that position when the magazine's conservative owner felt that Wright was intentionally provoking <b>their</b> middle-class <b>readership</b> <b>with</b> his interest in unconventional and often sexually explicit fiction. In his two-year tenure, Wright published short stories by Gabriele D'Annunzio, Floyd Dell, Ford Madox Ford, D.H. Lawrence, and George Moore; a play by Joseph Conrad; and poems by Ezra Pound and William Butler Yeats.|$|R
40|$|The {{growth of}} {{complementary}} and alternative medicine (CAM) in the West entails complex geographies of health, identity and knowledge. Debates about {{why people are}} attracted to CAM highlight the importance of consumer agency and increasing {{access to health care}} information. The article explores a key space within which information on CAM is produced and negotiated: health and lifestyle magazines. Drawing upon interviews with the editors of eight British titles, the article outlines three ways in which CAM is discursively framed: as a pragmatic medical tool kit brought to bear on the diseased body; as a means of achieving 'total well-being' in everyday metropolitan space; and as a central pillar of an alternative lifestyle. The final section of the article considers how editors understand and address <b>their</b> predominantly female <b>readerships,</b> <b>with</b> an emphasis on how CAM is articulated within an ostensibly emancipatory project of self-responsibility and personal empowerment against the ambivalent backdrop of consumer culture...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} is to {{increase}} the knowledge of some of the phenomena involved in the development and expansion of Swedish journalism in the 20 th century. This is done primarily by research into the works of three major newspapermen, but also by studies of seven Swedish dailies’ reporting of nine labour market conflicts. The three newspapermen are C. G. Tengwall (chapter 1), Ewald Stomberg (chapter 2) and Sigfrid (Sigge) Ågren (chapter 4), all driving forces in the development of strategies to consolidate the positions of their respective papers among <b>their</b> <b>readership.</b> <b>With</b> Tengwall, at Svenska Dagbladet 1898 - 1907, came the introduction in Sweden of the modern popularized daily newspaper with a broad and varied content. Stomberg, also at Svenska Dagbladet, became, above all during the period 1910 - 20, a keen promoter of “active journalism”. Sigge Ågren, the strong man in the central editorial office of Expressen for 25 years, from its start in 1944 and onwards, was one of the prime movers behind a type of journalism that strove to report from the perspective of those concerned. Of the nine labour market conflicts (chapter 3), the first concerned the cabbies in Stockholm during April/May 1900 and the ninth a breakout group of engine drivers in May 1969. Here particular attention is paid to how journalism gradually allowed the different parties, including members of the general public, to contribute to an increasingly dramatized description of the events, at the expense of a factual account. Chapter 3 also gives a number of examples of how headlines and run-in texts, page layout, the use of pictures and the use of editorials changed, and in more detail, how the role of professional subeditor evolved. On the whole, {{it is a question of}} rather slow developments, albeit in the same direction. The development of news journalism went hand-in-hand with successive popularization; new topics were introduced, the presentation styles changed, and the reporter’s role was strengthened and differentiated. Newspapermen, who, with journalistic entrepreneurship, could successfully grasp the interplay between the market and the available production resources, were the key actors in this process. By 1969, with an increasingly well thought through and vigorous editing of the journalistic material, and with methods for exciting and captivating presentation of news, Swedish daily press journalism had at its disposal a powerful arsenal for its depiction of reality...|$|R
40|$|The {{main focus}} {{of this paper is}} to {{investigate}} the impact of publications read (saved) by the different users in Mendeley in order to explore the extent to which <b>their</b> <b>readership</b> counts correlate <b>with</b> <b>their</b> citation indicators. The potential of filtering highly cited papers by Mendeley readerships and its different users have been also explored. For the analysis of the users, we have considered the information of the top three Mendeley ‘users’ reported by the Mendeley. Our results show that publications <b>with</b> Mendeley <b>readerships</b> tend to have higher citation and journal citation scores than publications without readerships. ‘Biomedical & health sciences’ and ‘Mathematics and computer science’ are the fields with respectively the most and the least readership activity in Mendeley. PhD students have the highest density of readerships per publication and Lecturers and Librarians have the lowest across all the different fields. Our precision-recall analysis indicates that in general, for publications with at least one reader in Mendeley, the capacity of readerships of filtering highly cited publications is better than (or at least as good as) Journal Citation Scores. We discuss the important limitation of Mendeley of only reporting the top three readers and not all of them in the potential development of indicators based on Mendeley and its users...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 2011 The {{following}} question guided this research: How do female readers understand the romantic content of Cosmopolitan and/or Glamour magazines, {{and how do}} they perceive connections between <b>their</b> <b>readership</b> of this content and their personal ideas and behaviors regarding romantic relationships? This study involved a series of responsive interviews in which the participants shared their perceptions of both <b>their</b> <b>readership</b> and the magazines' content. The {{results of this study suggest}} four primary responses to the research question: 1) the women gave, but could not explain, concurrent descriptions of the magazines as "just entertainment" but also as sources of useful information; 2) although the women described both positive and negative qualities of Cosmo and Glamour's romantic content, they also described the romantic and sexual content as relevant and compelling; 3) the women argued that their mature perspective of the content prevented them from being unduly influenced by it; and 4) a few participants' academic awareness of criticisms of women's magazines altered their perceptions but not <b>their</b> <b>readership</b> of Cosmo and Glamour.
