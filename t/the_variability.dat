5|$|Electric power {{generated}} from wind {{power can be}} highly variable at several different timescales: hourly, daily, or seasonally. Annual variation also exists, but is not as significant. Because instantaneous electrical generation and consumption must remain in balance to maintain grid stability, this variability can present substantial challenges to incorporating large amounts of wind power into a grid system. Intermittency and the non-dispatchable nature of wind energy production can raise costs for regulation, incremental operating reserve, and (at high penetration levels) could require {{an increase in the}} already existing energy demand management, load shedding, storage solutions or system interconnection with HVDC cables. <b>The</b> <b>variability</b> of wind is quite different from solar, wind may be producing power at night when other baseload plants are often overproducing.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} a new method of likelihood ratio computation for score-based biometric recognition systems given {{a small number}} of samples in <b>the</b> within-source <b>variability</b> dataset (also called target set). Generally the number of samples in <b>the</b> within-source <b>variability</b> dataset is less than the number of samples in <b>the</b> between-source <b>variability</b> dataset (also called non-target set) and therefore the probability density function (pdf) of <b>the</b> within-source <b>variability</b> dataset cannot be estimated reliably compared to the pdf of <b>the</b> between-source <b>variability.</b> <b>The</b> proposed method estimates the pdf of within-source variability from estimates of <b>the</b> within-source <b>variability</b> mean and variance and the pdf of between-source <b>variability</b> by minimizing <b>the</b> Kullback-Leibler distance [1] of the pdf of <b>the</b> within-source <b>variability</b> to that of <b>the</b> between-source <b>variability</b> given within-source variability mean and variance. It thus finds a conservative estimate of the pdf of within-source variability. Working out this optimization problem results in an log likelihood ration that is a second order polynomial of a given score value.

There is a genetic relation between the common variants which cause schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, an inverse genetic correlation with intelligence and no genetic correlation with immune disorders.|$|E

40|$|One of the {{challenges}} in evaluating and applying atmospheric regional climate models (RCM) is the non-linear behavior of atmospheric processes, which is still not well understood. These non-linearities determine <b>the</b> internal <b>variability</b> in <b>the</b> model.

The study is carried out for the Arctic applying an ensemble of 20 members, differing in their initial conditions only, simulated with the RCM HIRHAM 5 during summer (July- September) 2012.

40|$|Accurate {{quantification}} of {{the contribution}} of environmental variability and functional changes to <b>the</b> interannual <b>variability</b> of net ecosystem production (NEP) and evapotranspiration (ET) in coniferous forests is needed to understand global carbon and water cycling. This study quantified these contributions to <b>the</b> interannual <b>variability</b> of NEP and ET for a subtropical coniferous plantation in southeastern China, {{and the effect of}} drought stress on these contributions was also investigated. NEP and ET were derived from eddy covariance measurements carried out over the period 2003 - 2012.

40|$|We {{develop a}} {{framework}} to study <b>the</b> role of <b>variability</b> in transport across a streamline of a reference flow. Two complementary schemes are presented: a graphical approach for individual cases, and an analytical approach for general properties. The spatially nonlinear interaction of dynamic <b>variability</b> and <b>the</b> reference flow results in flux <b>variability.</b> <b>The</b> characteristic time-scale of <b>the</b> dynamic <b>variability</b> and <b>the</b> length-scale of <b>the</b> flux <b>variability</b> in {{a unit of}} flight-time govern the spatio-temporal interaction that leads to transport. The non-dimensional ratio of the two characteristic scales is {{shown to be a}} a critical parameter. The pseudo-lobe sequence along the reference streamline describes spatial coherency and temporal evolution of transport. For finite-time transport from an initial time up to the present, the characteristic length-scale of <b>the</b> flux <b>variability</b> regulates <b>the</b> width of the pseudo-lobes. The phase speed of pseudo-lobe propagation averages the reference flow and <b>the</b> flux <b>variability.</b> In contrast, for definite transport over a fixed time interval and spatial segment, the characteristic time-scale of <b>the</b> dynamic <b>variability</b> regulates <b>the</b> width of the pseudo-lobes. Generation of the pseudo-lobe sequence appears to be synchronous with <b>the</b> dynamic <b>variability,</b> although it propagates with the reference flow. In either case, the critical characteristic ratio is found to be one, corresponding to a resonance of <b>the</b> flux <b>variability</b> with <b>the</b> reference flow.
