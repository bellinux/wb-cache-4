5|$|Osteochondritis dissecans (OCD or OD) {{is a joint}} {{disorder}} in which cracks form in the articular cartilage and the underlying subchondral bone. OCD usually causes pain and swelling of the affected joint which catches and locks during movement. Physical examination typically reveals an effusion, <b>tenderness,</b> <b>and</b> a crackling sound with joint movement.|$|E
5|$|He {{was known}} for the {{following}} eponyms: Murphy’s button (a mechanical device used for intestinal anastomosis), Murphy’s punch (a punch tenderness at the costo-vertebral angle in cases of perinephric abscess), Murphy's sign (a sign of inflammation of the gallbladder), Murphy’s test (a test for deep-seated <b>tenderness</b> <b>and</b> muscular rigidity in cases of perinephric abscess), Murphy drip for administration of fluids by proctoclysis in patients with peritonitis, and Murphy-Lane bone skid (a common commercial steel instrument used for femoral head procedures).|$|E
5|$|Next, the {{examining}} physician may check for {{weakness of the}} quadriceps. This examination may reveal fluid in the joint, <b>tenderness,</b> <b>and</b> crepitus. The Wilson test is also useful in locating OCD lesions of the femoral condyle. The test is performed by slowly extending the knee from 90 degrees, maintaining internal rotation. Pain at 30 degrees of flexion and relief with tibial external rotation is indicative of OCD.|$|E

5|$|Painful {{cramping}} in the abdomen, back, or upper thighs {{is common}} {{during the first}} few days of menstruation. Severe uterine pain during menstruation is known as dysmenorrhea, and it is most common among adolescents and younger women (affecting about 67.2% of adolescent females). When menstruation begins, symptoms of premenstrual syndrome (PMS) such as breast <b>tenderness</b> <b>and</b> irritability generally decrease. Many sanitary products are marketed to women for use during their menstruation.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, Parker {{played the}} male lead in Rome & Jewel, a hip-hop take on Romeo and Juliet that got mothballed and re-released in 2008. Parker's title character, who is {{supposed}} to be the modern day Romeo, was a Compton youth with both <b>tenderness</b> <b>and</b> toughness. Despite a troubled script, Parker's rap performance earned comparisons to Will Smith from Nathan Lee of The New York Times. In 2007, he had a small role in Pride, about an African American swim team. Parker was tasked with depicting the visual expectations of an athletic proficiency that was new to him but very familiar to the audience.|$|E
5|$|Local {{symptoms}} include immediate and intense pain, followed {{after a few}} minutes (but perhaps by as much as 30 minutes) by swelling and a tingling sensation. Blisters containing blood are not common. The pain may spread within a few hours, along with <b>tenderness</b> <b>and</b> inflammation. Reddish lymphangitic lines and bruising may appear, and the whole limb can become swollen and bruised within 24 hours. Swelling may also spread to the trunk, and with children, throughout the entire body. Necrosis and intracompartmental syndromes are very rare.|$|E

5|$|Physical {{examination}} typically reveals {{fluid in}} the joint, <b>tenderness,</b> <b>and</b> crepitus. The tenderness may initially spread, but often reverts to a well-defined focal point as the lesion progresses. Just as OCD shares symptoms with common maladies, acute osteochondral fracture {{has a similar}} presentation with tenderness in the affected joint, but is usually associated with a fatty hemarthrosis. Although {{there is no significant}} pathologic gait or characteristic alignment abnormality associated with OCD, the patient may walk with the involved leg externally rotated in an attempt to avoid tibial spine impingement on the lateral aspect of the medial condyle of the femur.|$|E
5|$|Limousins {{generally}} have {{lower levels of}} intra-muscular fat (marbling) and subcutaneous fat when compared with British breed cattle grown in similar conditions. Marbling, together with <b>tenderness</b> <b>and</b> flavour, {{has been associated with}} eating quality in some countries, and attracts a higher quality grading with associated premiums, although the link between marbling and palatability is not universally supported. In some countries, Limousin's lean, tender meat is considered to be of outstanding quality and marketed through specialist outlets. Beef producers targeting the higher marbling specifications of some markets, but who have concerns over the poorer feed conversion efficiency and yield associated with higher marbling British breed cattle, use Limousin sires over British breed cows, or British breed sires over Limousin cows, in crossbreeding programmes that aim to achieve a balance between the different and conflicting production demands.|$|E
25|$|Under {{hygienic}} {{conditions and}} without other treatment, meat {{can be stored}} at above its freezing point (–1.5°C) for about six weeks without spoilage, during which time it undergoes an aging process that increases its <b>tenderness</b> <b>and</b> flavor.|$|E

25|$|Shoulder pain or <b>tenderness</b> <b>and,</b> occasionally, a bump in {{the middle}} of the top of the {{shoulder}} (over the AC joint) are signs that a separation may have occurred. Sometimes the severity of a separation can be detected by taking x rays while the patient holds a light weight that pulls on the muscles, making a separation more pronounced.|$|E

25|$|The {{three primary}} signs of {{fertility}} are basal body temperature (BBT), cervical mucus, and cervical position. A woman practicing symptoms-based fertility awareness {{may choose to}} observe one sign, two signs, or all three. Many women experience secondary fertility signs that correlate with certain phases of the menstrual cycle, such as abdominal pain and heaviness, back pain, breast <b>tenderness,</b> <b>and</b> mittelschmerz (ovulation pains).|$|E
25|$|Fulminant disease {{correlates}} {{with more than}} ten bowel movements daily, continuous bleeding, toxicity, abdominal <b>tenderness</b> <b>and</b> distension, blood transfusion requirement and colonic dilation (expansion). Patients in this category may have inflammation extending beyond just the mucosal layer, causing impaired colonic motility and leading to toxic megacolon. If the serous membrane is involved, a colonic perforation may ensue. Unless treated, the fulminant disease will soon lead to death.|$|E
25|$|External {{signs and}} {{symptoms}} are constipation of very long duration, abdominal bloating, abdominal <b>tenderness</b> <b>and</b> tympany, abdominal pain, palpation of hard fecal masses and, in toxic megacolon, fever, low blood potassium, tachycardia and shock. Stercoral ulcers are sometimes observed in chronic megacolon, which may lead to perforation of the intestinal wall in approximately 3% of the cases, leading to sepsis and risk of death.|$|E

60|$|Towards evening it was Elsa's custom to walk abroad. As at {{that hour}} Foy left the foundry, {{naturally}} he accompanied her in these walks, Martin following at a little distance in case he should be wanted. Soon those excursions became delightful to both of them. To Elsa, especially, it was pleasant {{to escape from the}} hot house into the cool evening air, and still more pleasant to exchange the laboured <b>tendernesses</b> <b>and</b> highly coloured compliments of Adrian for the cheerful honesty of Foy's conversation.|$|R
25|$|The {{diagnosis}} of these complications can be assisted by noting local <b>tenderness</b> <b>and</b> dull pain, {{and can be}} confirmed by CT and nuclear isotope scanning. The most common microbial causes are anaerobic bacteria and S. aureus. Treatment includes performing surgical drainage and administration of antimicrobial therapy. Surgical debridement is rarely required after an extended course of parenteral antimicrobial therapy. Antibiotics should be administered for at least 6 weeks. Continuous monitoring of patients for possible intracranial complication is advised.|$|E
25|$|Systems of {{fertility}} awareness rely on observation {{of changes in}} {{one or more of the}} primary fertility signs (basal body temperature, cervical mucus, and cervical position), tracking menstrual cycle length and identifying the fertile window based on this information, or both. Other signs may also be observed: these include breast <b>tenderness</b> <b>and</b> mittelschmerz (ovulation pains), urine analysis strips known as ovulation predictor kits (OPKs), and microscopic examination of saliva or cervical fluid. Also available are computerized fertility monitors.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} {{side effect of}} {{spironolactone}} is urinary frequency. Other general side effects include dehydration, hyponatremia (low sodium levels), mild hypotension (low blood pressure), ataxia (muscle incoordination), drowsiness, dizziness, dry skin, and rashes. Because it reduces androgen levels and directly blocks androgen signaling, spironolactone can, in men, cause breast tenderness, gynecomastia (breast development), and feminization in general, as well as testicular atrophy, reversibly reduced fertility, and sexual dysfunction including loss of libido and erectile dysfunction. In women, spironolactone can cause menstrual irregularities, breast <b>tenderness,</b> <b>and</b> breast enlargement.|$|E
