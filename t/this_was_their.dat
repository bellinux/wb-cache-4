Texas went on to win this game 28–7. UH students had been using the victory sign as a hand signal up to that time, but began using the bent-finger sign as a reminder that they would remember the taunts.|$|E

They eventually played Southern Counties, and beat them 3–1. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>their</b> 74th match in the British Isles and their 49th victory. The authorities and press in London continued to view the team negatively, and the Natives boarded ship without a formal farewell.
