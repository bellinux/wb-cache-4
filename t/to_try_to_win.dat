5|$|During {{the latter}} part of Diệm's rule, a {{centerpiece}} of the rural pacification campaign was the large-scale construction of strategic hamlets, whereby villagers were compelled to move into fortified camps in an attempt to lock out insurgents. However this failed as many were able to infiltrate the settlements, whereas a previous implementation of such principles in Malaya had been successful as the local communists were ethnic Chinese who were physically distinguishable from the anti-communist ethnic majority. It also angered the peasants, who were forced to abandon their ancestral lands and homes, and build new dwellings in the new villages. Many of these hamlets were subsequently overrun in communist attacks, something many villagers found to their liking. General Lê Văn Kim oversaw the future of the program for Minh and it was decided to liberalize the system <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> over the peasants. They forecast that they could reduce the insurgency's support by 30% alone through these less restrictive arrangements, citing more cooperative attitudes in Mekong Delta regions heavily populated with Hòa Hảo and Cao Đài.

25|$|Meeting with François Barbé-Marbois, the French foreign minister, Monroe and Livingston {{agreed to}} {{purchase}} the entire territory of Louisiana for $15 million; the purchase {{became known as the}} Louisiana Purchase. In agreeing to the purchase, Monroe violated his instructions, which had only allowed $9 million for the purchase of New Orleans and West Florida. The French did not acknowledge that West Florida remained in Spanish possession, and the United States would claim that France had sold West Florida to the United States for several years to come. Though he had not ordered the purchase of the entire territory, Jefferson strongly supported Monroe's actions, which ensured that the United States would continue to expand to the West. Overcoming doubts about whether the Constitution authorized the purchase of foreign territory, Jefferson won congressional approval for the Louisiana Purchase, and the acquisition doubled the size of the United States. Monroe would travel to Spain in 1805 <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> the cession of West Florida, but, with the support of France, Spain refused to consider relinquishing the territory.|$|E

The round consisted of five categories (instead of six in the main game), each with five clues of no determined value.

Contestants had to create the line before accumulating three strikes, which were given if a contestant either failed to respond (passing was not allowed without penalty) or gave an incorrect answer. If the contestant struck out $100 was awarded for each correct answer given, but if the contestant was successful he/she won $5,000.
