25|$|The {{evolutionary}} history is finished. The endeavour is complete. If you'd asked me 20 years ago whether we'd be attempting such a mammoth task, I'd have said 'Don't be ridiculous'. These programmes tell a particular story and I'm sure others will {{come along and}} tell it much better than I did, but I do hope that if people watch it in 50 years' time, it will still {{have something to say}} about <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>we</b> <b>live</b> <b>in.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1953, James {{was forced}} to leave the US under threat of {{deportation}} for having overstayed his visa. In his attempt to remain in America, James wrote a study of Herman Melville, Mariners, Renegades and Castaways: The Story of Herman Melville and <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>We</b> <b>Live</b> <b>In,</b> and had copies of the privately published work sent to every member of the Senate. He wrote the book while being detained on Ellis Island. In an impassioned letter to his old friend George Padmore, James said that in Mariners that he was using Moby Dick as a parable for the anticommunism sweeping the United State, a consequence, he thought, of Americans' uncritical faith in capitalism.|$|E

The illustration is from the famed space artist Chesley Bonestell and carries the caption: [...] "Purple Pleione, a star of the familiar Pleiades cluster, rotates so rapidly that it has flattened into a flying saucer and hurled forth a dark red ring of hydrogen.

500|$|Gilliam {{used the}} same filmmaking style as he had in Brazil (1985), {{including}} the art direction and cinematography (specifically using fresnel lenses). The appearance of the interrogation room where Cole is being interviewed by the scientists {{was based on the}} work of Lebbeus Woods; these scenes were shot at three different power stations (two in Philadelphia and one in Baltimore). Gilliam intended to show Cole being interviewed through a multi-screen interrogation TV set because he felt the machinery evoked a [...] "nightmarish intervention of technology.

2500|$|While {{abstract}} metaphysics {{provides us}} with a world of beauty and purpose and various other [...] "highers", it condemns other key aspects of <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>we</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> as imaginary. The world of abstract metaphysics has no place for imperfect moral agents who (1) strive {{to learn about the}} world and then (2) act upon the world to change it for the better. Consequently, abstract metaphysics condemns us as illusionary, and declares our place in the world as unimportant and purposeless. Where abstractions take priority, our concrete lives collapse into scepticism and pessimism.|$|E

They will promise us eternal life, but whatever".

2500|$|Los Angeles Times critic Kenneth Turan {{commented on}} the {{violence}} depicted in the film: [...] "The Coen brothers dropped the mask. They've put violence on screen before, lots of it, but not like this. Not anything like this. No Country for Old Men doesn't celebrate or smile at violence; it despairs of it." [...] However, Turan explained that [...] "no one should see No Country for Old Men underestimating the intensity of its violence. But it's also clear that the Coen brothers and McCarthy {{are not interested in}} violence for its own sake, but for what it says about <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>we</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> ... As the film begins, a confident deputy says I got it under control, and in moments he is dead. He didn't have anywhere near the mastery he imagined. And in this despairing vision, neither does anyone else." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "There's a {{tone and}} feeling to the song, there's a militia, a march {{and a kind}} of rambunctious energy to it that, for me, I {{immediately}} wanted to tap into. I showed [...] some references from the classic rebellious zones of <b>the</b> <b>world.</b> <b>We</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> very orderly society in America, but when you get into Brazil, you get into the Middle East, you get into Africa, you get into Eastern Europe, when you get into places like that, there's a different sort of 'we run this town' [...] There's less order and more chaos. So we looked at a lot of those references, new photos and historical photos, to capture that kind of falling-apart feeling." [...] "We wanted you to feel uneasy throughout the piece," [...] he said. [...] "We wanted there to be a constant layer of tension through the piece. Even in the way I shot — where the camera comes by Jay, it doesn't stop on him, it goes to Rihanna — there's kind of this chaos of revealing and covering and concealing. And things happen offscreen that you don't see. I think people are really gonna flip on this".|$|E
5000|$|About {{the themes}} of his works, Subhash Shah wrote, Curious {{relationship}} of man with nature, with birds and animals, inherent contradictions in human existence, chaos and turmoil of <b>the</b> <b>worlds</b> <b>we</b> <b>live</b> in and above all, the profound mystery of nature {{are some of the}} prime and direct concerns of Piraji's world of thought and imagery.

5000|$|Daniel Hausman and Michael McPherson {{have argued}} that the satirical section might seem to be based in {{economics}} as a science, but in fact contains strong moral premises which cannot be removed and still leave the argument intact.

2500|$|Terry Flew (2005) {{argues that}} [...] "the global {{interactive}} games industry {{is large and}} growing, and {{is at the forefront}} of many of the most significant innovations in new media" [...] (Flew 2005: 101). Interactivity is prominent in these online video games such as World of Warcraft, The Sims Online and Second Life. These games, which are developments of [...] "new media," [...] allow for users to establish relationships and experience a sense of belonging that transcends traditional temporal and spatial boundaries (such as when gamers logging in from {{different parts of the world}} interact). These games can be used as an escape or to act out a desired life. Will Wright, creator of The Sims, [...] "is fascinated by the way gamers have become so attached to his invention-with some even living their lives through it". New media have created virtual realities that are becoming virtual extensions of <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>we</b> <b>live</b> <b>in.</b> With the creation of Second Life and Active Worlds before it, people have even more control over this virtual world, a world where anything that a participant can think of can become a reality.|$|E
2500|$|The {{finished}} product was a 20-by-20inch oil {{painting of a}} man {{sitting in a chair}} in an all-white room with his back facing the audience. The cover chosen was the ninth one he painted for the project. Smith discussed the inspiration for the cover after he visited the band at their Maui recording studio. [...] "We talked about <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>we</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> and the issues that face our culture. Issues such as political propaganda, a sensationalist media, blind faith and micro-macrocosm were a few of the things we discussed. We liked the idea of a man with his back turned to the world, in a white blank room." [...] The concept was further discussed on his web page. [...] "Is the whiteness purity and peace that he seeks, or the stark cold white of a mental ward? [...] "It's just a guy who has had enough, everything has gotten too heavy and he needs a break from it all. He hasn't given up or surrendered, just created an enlightened microcosm. The minimal white area surrounding the figure {{is more important than the}} figure itself, being that it can represent health or paranoia." [...] The image is repeated on the disc itself.|$|E
2500|$|The opening {{sequence}} {{used for}} the first 26 episodes lists the show's title as The Mechanical Universe, whereas the latter 26 episodes are titled The Mechanical Universe ...and Beyond. The reason for the addition is explained by Goodstein in the closing lecture segment of the final episode: In the first scientific revolution, disputation over the interpretation of human or divine authority was replaced by observation, by measurement, by the testing of hypotheses, all of it with the powerful help of quantitative mathematical reasoning. And the result of all that was the mechanical universe, a universe that inexorably worked out its destiny according to precise, predictable, mechanical laws. Today, we no longer believe in that universe. If I know the precise position of some particle at some instant of time, I cannot {{have any idea of}} where it's going or how fast. And it doesn't make any difference at all if you say, [...] "All right, you don't know where it's going, but where is it really going?" [...] That is precisely the kind of question that is scientifically meaningless. That is the nature of <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>we</b> <b>live</b> <b>in.</b> That is the quantum mechanical universe.The series can be purchased from Caltech or streamed from online video sources, including Caltech's official YouTube channel. Caltech also posted on YouTube a series of short videos made by Blinn to demonstrate the show's computer animation at SIGGRAPH conferences.|$|E
