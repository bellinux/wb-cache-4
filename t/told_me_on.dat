[...] In 2005, they played a short tour in Europe, but Cotton was hospitalized in Norway with health issues and missed the last two shows of the tour. Guitarist and singer Bill Lloyd, of duo Foster and LLoyd, substituted for Cotton for several subsequent shows in the US. Cotton returned in 2006, stabilizing the lineup of Young, Cotton, Sundrud, and drummer George Lawrence. Cotton and Sundrud released solo albums. Young started writing an autobiographical history of the band. Poco alumni {{continued to}} periodically reunite in concert with this lineup. Beginning in 2009 Grantham occasionally appeared with the band again but limited his contributions to vocals only. [...] Richie Furay and Jim Messina returned for several 2008 Poco performances at the Wildwood Lodge in Steelville, Missouri, a tour of California in 2009 ending at the Stagecoach Festival in Indio where {{they were joined by}} Grantham and Timothy B. Schmit, and several dates opening for Loggins and Messina featuring Furay, Messina, and Grantham. [...] Bareback at Big Sky (2005) and [...] The Wildwood Sessions (2006) captured live acoustic versions of songs both new and familiar from their 40-plus year career. [...] Live at Columbia Studios, Hollywood 9/30/71 (2010) unearthed an unreleased 1971 live performance by Furay, Young, Schmit, Grantham, and the then recently recruited Cotton in front of a private audience of family and friends. In early 2010 Paul Cotton left Poco abruptly, publicly citing a financial dispute with Young. On his official website he announced he would not be appearing with Poco at the Wildwood concerts, stating [...] "It was not all that shocking when Rusty <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>on</b> Feb. 27 that he would not honor the contract that I had been requesting for over 15 years, and that this was goodbye..." [...] On March 12, 2010, Young responded on Poco's official website: [...] "It was a sad day when I read on Paul's website that he wasn't coming to Wildwood and I guess that means he's leaving the band." [...] Poco immediately reformed with Young, Sundrud, Lawrence and new keyboardist and multi-instrumentalist/singer Michael Webb of Nashville TN.|$|E
