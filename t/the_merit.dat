5|$|Buddhist traditions provide {{detailed}} {{descriptions of}} how this transfer proceeds. Transferring merit to another person, usually deceased relatives, is simply done by a mental wish. Despite the word transfer, <b>the</b> <b>merit</b> of the giver {{is in no way}} decreased during such an act, just like a candle used to light another candle does not diminish. <b>The</b> <b>merit</b> transferred cannot always be received, however. The dead relatives must also be able to sympathize with the meritorious act. If the relatives do not receive <b>the</b> <b>merit,</b> the act of transferring merit will still be beneficial for the giver himself. The transfer of merit is thus connected with the idea of rejoicing. The other person who rejoices in one's meritorious deeds, in that way also receives merit, if he approves of <b>the</b> <b>merit</b> done. Thus, rejoicing in others' merits, apart from being one of the ten meritorious acts mentioned, is also a prerequisite for the transferring of merit to occur. The purposes for merit transfer differ. In many Buddhist countries, transferring merit is connected to the notion of an intermediate state. <b>The</b> <b>merit</b> that is transferred to the deceased will help them to cross over safely to the next rebirth. Some Mahāyāna traditions believe that it can help deceased relatives to attain the Pure Land. Another way of transferring merit, apart from helping the deceased, is to dedicate it to the devas (deities), since it is believed that these are not able to make merits themselves. In this way it is believed their favor can be obtained. Finally, many Buddhists transfer merits to resolve a bond of revenge that may exist between people, as it is believed that someone else's vengefulness may create harm in one's life.|$|E
5|$|Because the {{governor}} controls so many appointments to commissions—approximately 2,000 {{according to a}} 1992 estimate—the office has been historically {{considered one of the}} most powerful state executive positions in the United States. Additionally, {{the governor}} is given wide discretion in awarding state contracts, further augmenting his influence. In the second half of the 20th century, attempts were made to curb the use of the governor's appointment power for political patronage. During his second term in office, Happy Chandler issued an executive order creating a merit system that forbade the hiring or firing of state employees for political reasons; his successor, Bert T. Combs, pushed a new merit system through the legislature, protecting it from abolition by executive order. Despite the presence of <b>the</b> <b>merit</b> system, many governors have been criticized for abusing their appointment power. In 2005, Ernie Fletcher and several members of his administration were indicted for violating <b>the</b> <b>merit</b> system in their hiring practices; the charges were later dropped as part of an agreement with the prosecutor, Attorney General Greg Stumbo.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{modernity and}} <b>the</b> <b>merit</b> {{of the works}} {{produced}} {{and the ability of}} its protagonists, the historiography of Renaissance sculpture in Brescia was never able to win the honors of artistic and literary culture, neither at the time, nor in the following centuries, being forgotten even by the local sources. The main cause {{is to be found in}} a long series of errors and omissions that occurred in the critical literature from the earliest days until the twentieth century, which led to the misunderstanding of the cultural level and quality achieved by the Brescia school during the thirty years from the turn of the fifteenth century, and the oblivion of its main characters.|$|E

5|$|In March 1911, Eldred earned First Class rank. He {{subsequently}} {{completed the}} 21 merit badges required for Eagle Scout.

As originally implemented, Eagle Scout was part of <b>the</b> <b>merit</b> badge system and was not a rank. Thus Eldred, like several of the early Eagles, did not earn the Life or Star awards that later preceded Eagle Scout. Eldred's merit badges were noted in the Honor Roll of the August 1912 edition of Boys' Life.|$|E
5|$|In {{the general}} {{election}} campaign, Fletcher attempted to make the expansion of casino gambling, rather than <b>the</b> <b>merit</b> system investigation, the central issue. Beshear favored holding a referendum on {{a constitutional amendment to}} allow expanded casino gambling in the state, while Fletcher maintained that expanded gambling would bring an increase in crime and societal ills. The gambling issue failed to gain as much traction as the hiring scandal, however, and Beshear defeated Fletcher by a vote of 619,686 to 435,895.|$|E
5|$|Slavery in Greek antiquity {{has long}} been an object of apologetic {{discourse}} among Christians, who are typically awarded <b>the</b> <b>merit</b> of its collapse. From the 16th century the discourse became moralizing in nature. The existence of colonial slavery had significant impact on the debate, with some authors lending it civilizing merits and others denouncing its misdeeds. Thus Henri-Alexandre Wallon in 1847 published a History of Slavery in Antiquity among his works for the abolition of slavery in the French colonies.|$|E

So, Vishnu prays to goddess Tripura, who grants half of her beauty to Vishnu, begetting the Mohini-form.

5|$|A {{cause and}} effect {{methodology}} led to a relatively value-free approach to economic science, in which Cantillon was uninterested in <b>the</b> <b>merit</b> of any particular economic action or phenomenon, focusing rather on the explanation of relationships. This led Cantillon to separate economic science from politics and ethics {{to a greater degree}} than previous mercantilist writers. This has led to disputes on whether Cantillon can justly be considered a mercantilist or one of the first anti-mercantilists, given that Cantillon often cited government-manipulated trade surpluses and specie accumulation as positive economic stimuli. Others argue that in instances where Cantillon is thought to have supported certain mercantilist policies, he actually provided a more neutral analysis by explicitly stating possible limitations of mercantilist policies.|$|E
5|$|Arrowmen are {{identified}} {{by a white}} sash bearing a red arrow that is worn over their right shoulder. An Ordeal member wears a sash with a lone arrow.

5|$|Because {{there is}} a maximum number of {{established}} positions for ranks warrant officer first class (one per squadron), promotions {{are based on the}} results of a merit review board. The composition of <b>the</b> <b>merit</b> review board includes a minimum of three to a maximum of five members.

Prior to 1976 the size of the squadron dictated the top rank available and many squadrons were ineligible to carry a WO1 on their establishment effectively capping promotion at WO2 for the squadron's ranking cadet.|$|E

5|$|During the 1974 {{legislative}} session, Ford {{proposed a}} six-year study of coal liquefaction and gasification {{in response to}} the 1973 oil crisis. He also increased funding to human resources and continued his reorganization of the executive branch, creating cabinets for transportation, development, education and the arts, human resources, consumer protection and regulation, safety and justice. He was considered less ruthless than previous governors in firing state officials hired by the previous administration, and expanded the state merit system to cover some previously exempt state workers. Despite the expansion, he was criticized for the replacements he made, particularly that of the state personnel commissioner appointed during the Nunn administration. Critics also cited the fact that employees found qualified by <b>the</b> <b>merit</b> examination were still required to obtain political clearance before they were hired.|$|E
