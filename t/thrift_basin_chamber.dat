The castle is located near İhsaniye between the countyside {{and the town of}} Döğer. It was a settlement from the Byzantine period. The castle is surrounded by walls made ​​of a natural hill on the plateau. There are foundation remains of many buildings in the castle, while the the hills were carved in the rock as places of settlements. 135 film (36 × 24 mm...|$|R
30|$|The greater {{likelihood}} of high cheatgrass cover following high-severity fire at lower elevations (< 1600 m) may be primarily a reflection of competition between cheatgrass and native perennial plants. Cheatgrass can have a large soil seed bank that is poised to germinate and grow rapidly after fire (Mack and Pyke 1983), whereas soil seed banks of the native perennial herbaceous species tend to be relatively small (Chambers et al. 2007). Thus, postfire cheatgrass seedlings would be subjected to less competition from the native flora after high-severity fire than after low-severity fire. An experimental study in the Great <b>Basin</b> (<b>Chambers</b> et al. 2007) found that removal of perennial herbaceous species, even without associated burning, led to a two- to three-fold increase in cheatgrass biomass and seed production, with even greater increases following a combination of removal and burning. Surveys of recently burned areas also have reported a negative relationship between cover of cheatgrass and native perennials (e.g., Condon et al. 2011). Dry conditions in the year after a fire also may have a stronger negative effect on growth of native seedlings and surviving perennials than on cheatgrass. Cheatgrass begins taking up soil moisture {{very early in the}} season, and may deplete the soil moisture accumulated over the winter before the native species have begun to grow, especially in a dry year (Chambers et al. 2007).|$|R
40|$|In design, {{construction}} {{and maintenance of}} any engineering system, engineers have to take many technological and managerial decisions at several stages. The ultimate goal of all such decisions is either to minimize the effort required or to maximize the desire benefit. Optimization {{can be defined as}} the process of finding the condition that give maximum or minimum value of function. Thus, study was conducted for exploring about concept of ‘Optimization of structure’ i. e. ‘Optimization of swimming pool’. The swimming pool means any structure, <b>basin,</b> <b>chamber</b> or tank containing an artificial body of water for swimming, diving, recreational bathing. Considering the underground rectangular swimming pool, the vertical wall of such structure is subjected to hydro-static pressure and soil pressure & the base is subjected to weight of water and uplift soil pressure and it is designed by using Indian Standards. This paper focused on the optimum cost design of swimming pool due to effects of variation in grade of concrete and for different capacity by change in height (Depth). The main aim is to achieve the economy. Material saving results in saving in construction cost {{at the same time the}} safety is also considered. The model is analyzed and design by using MATLAB software. Optimization is formulated is in nonlinear programming problem (NLPP) by using sequential unconstrained minimization technique (SUMT) ...|$|R
50|$|The Blaisdell machine {{traveled}} along steel tracks laid {{on top of}} {{the walls}} of rectangular filter basins, bridging the walls with its structure. The washing chamber was lowered from the moving bridge frame into the <b>basin.</b> The <b>chamber</b> measures about 5 ftwide, 2 ft deep and 6 ft long, and contains a 4 ft diameter circular washing unit. The washing unit stirred the surface of the sand bed, dislodging sediment and flushing it away through two suction pumps {{at the top of the}} box, avoiding contamination of the surrounding water. The mechanism was controlled by an operator in a corrugated metal enclosure.|$|R
2500|$|Mary Lincoln was {{so happy}} with the china service that she also ordered a small set for the family’s {{personal}} use, and a [...] "toilet set" [...] {{for use in the}} family bedrooms. The toilet set was ordered on July 18, 1861, and consisted of two services. The one for Abraham and Mary Lincoln consisted of a ewer and <b>basin,</b> covered <b>chamber</b> pot, soap box, brush tray, jug, foot bath, and slop jar. It cost $45, and was decorated with the solferino border, although the Alhambra edging was replaced with a quatrefoil and tassel motif. The Great Seal of the United States was replaced with a Gothic [...] "ML" [...] in the center. A plain white toilet set, with the same items, formed the second set. This less fancy set cost just $24.50. Mrs. Lincoln ordered a third fancy toilet set, this one decorated with the U.S. coat of arms, on July 30. It appears intended for Mrs. Lincoln's bedroom, as it also included a ewer, sponge box, powder box, and pair of candlesticks. The cost of the third toilet set was $115.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Withdrawal {{of water}} from a river into a canal {{involves}} {{the construction of a}} barrage or a dam across the river depending on whether the river is perennial or not. The design of the reservoir upstream of the dam and of the canal requires consideration of the sediment load carried by the river in case the river is sediment-laden. The basic equations concerning morphological changes in such rivers are discussed with particular reference to computation of reservoir sedimentation. The hydraulics of lined canals carrying wash load is examined {{from the point of view}} of limiting transport capacity and changes in frictional resistance. Lastly, the methods of design of sediment extraction devices like settling <b>basins</b> and vortex <b>chambers</b> are presented...|$|R
40|$|A logical {{sequence}} {{for evaluating the}} mechanical properties of N-Reactor pressure tubing in the as-received condition is similar to evaluation after reactor service. The usual difficulties associated with testing a heavy tube to failure with 300 C water are compounded after reactor service by the high gamma radioactivity of the discharged tubes. Success in testing of discharged reactor pressure tubing in a pilot underwater facility led {{to the construction of}} an Irradiated Tube Testing ·Facility (ITTF) adjacent to the Radiometallurgy Building. The ITTF consists of a 10. ft 6 in. deep, water-filled basin 15 ft long by 10 ft wide, with six test chambers placed within the <b>basin.</b> These <b>chambers</b> are stainless steel bell jars that enclose the specimen, blast shielding, and electric furnace. The vessels exclude water from the hot specimen and furnace during testing and contain the pressure surge that occurs when the hot pressurized water flashes to steam upon failure of the test specimen. The ITTF basin is connected to the Radiometallurgy Building Basin by an underwater tube containing a conveyor system. The conveyor makes it possible to transfer highly radioactive materiais with ease and safety. Remote handling tools were developed to measure the tubes, attach end closures, attach thermocouples, and load lhe specimen within the furnace containment vessels...|$|R
50|$|Individual private guest bathrooms, even in {{the most}} {{exclusive}} hotels, were not usual in Europe in the 1880s. Each floor had a grouping of washrooms and wcs, more than sufficient for the number of bedrooms, beside the main staircase. If a guest wished to take a bath a zinc bathtub would be produced and placed in the guests bedroom, and filled with water by hotel staff using jugs, in a manner that would have reflected the arrangements in the homes of the more affluent guests. Although there was at this stage no plumbed water supply to the guest bedrooms, for basic personal ablution, urination and defecation, rooms were provided with their own jugs, <b>basins</b> and night <b>chamber</b> pots. The hotel still retains a few porcelain examples, inscribed with the prestigious names of their manufacturers Brown-Westhead, Moore & Co and Villeroy & Boch.|$|R
500|$|The east range itself {{runs the}} length of {{the east side of the}} castle, and {{originally}} comprised a large hall, with a square tower house at the north-east corner. Although only the basement survives, this once formed one of the finest noble residences of its time in Scotland, and would have been similar to the contemporary buildings at Doune Castle. The basement is a single tunnel vault, with low walls subdividing the area into stores. Two large ovens and a well lie at the south end, while at the east is the 13th-century postern, blocked when the wall was thickened to support the new buildings above, and re-used as a fireplace. At the north end of the basement is a vaulted prison for freemen, and below this, a rock-cut pit, [...] square, to house prisoners of the peasant classes. Above the prison, but still within the basement, is a vaulted chapel with various ceremonial recesses, such as a sacristy and a piscina, or water <b>basin.</b> A private <b>chamber</b> for the priest is next door. The hall above is [...] by , and once had a high timber roof, and a minstrel's gallery at the south end. An ornately carved stone buffet, or cupboard, is located on this wall, which formed part of the servery next to the kitchen. At the north-east corner of the castle, a tower house provided accommodation for the Lord's family and guests. Again, only the lowest floor remains, above the chapel. This probably formed a private chamber for the Lord, and was connected to the adjacent hall.|$|R
40|$|This {{essay is}} study of Aztec stone boxes from the pre-conquest Aztec empire. My study {{focuses on the}} {{interpretation}} of carvings on the surfaces, {{as well as the}} interiors and lids when applicable. The study includes not only traditionally functional boxes, but also altars (blocks or <b>basins)</b> and offering <b>chambers,</b> as comparative examples. The thesis focuses on three specific stone boxes located in museums in Mexico, Germany, and Great Britain: the Islas y Bustamante Box (Museo Nacional de Anthropologi­a, Mexico), the Hackmack Box (Museum fur Volkerkunde, Hamburg), and the Ahuitzotl Box (British Museum, London, and Museum fur Volkerkunde, Berlin). I am studying the iconographic programs, with a focus on themes of auto-sacrifice and creation, carved on the art objects themselves and their function as story-telling devices, with or without the contents that the box may have contained. In their forms, the objects themselves are metaphors for space, time, Aztec history, and Aztec creation myths. The Hackmack Box depicts the creation god, Quetzalcoatl (feathered serpent), and refers to the creation myth of mankind saved from the underworld and resurrected from the ashes of bones, using Quetzalcoatl's own blood. The box bears Montezuma's name glyph and is likely a tribute to his birth, his ascension and success as a ruler, and his piety. The Islas y Bustamante Box depicts the god of caves, Tepeyolotl, and refers to the myth that man ascended from caves, as all of life originated from the mouth of a cave that was also a natural spring. The box itself is a metaphor for this type of cave. The Ahuitzotl Box depicts the god of water Tlaloc, and refers to the myth of the tlaloques (helpers) discovery of "food-mountain", in other words, the discovery of maize that nourished the Aztec people. It has been linked to the dedication of the aqueduct built under the Aztec ruler Ahuitzotl, and serves as a tribute to this historical event. The cosmic arrangement of the motifs on these boxes reveal the object as a metaphor for space and time itself as they comply with the Aztec's earthly orientation of the heavens, the earth, an the underworld...|$|R
