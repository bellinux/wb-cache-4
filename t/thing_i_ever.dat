500|$|After Katsura {{arrived in}} the U.S., she gave a private {{exhibition}} for Cochran, who {{wanted to make sure}} she was as good as reported before finalizing the invitation. At that meeting she clicked off runs of 300 and 400 at straight rail, made in the words of Cochran [...] "almost unbelievable shots" [...] after switching to balkline, and showed high competence at three-cushion, consistently scoring. Cochran made the invite [...] "final" [...] and stated: [...] "She's the most marvelous <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> saw... She's liable to beat anybody, even Willie Hoppe... I could not see any weak spots... She's going to give lots of those players fits." [...] As a warm-up for the competition Katsura gave a number of billiard exhibitions during February 1952.|$|E

500|$|At Maryland, Shaughnessy {{served as}} the head {{football}} coach, athletic director, and director of physical education, under a [...] "lifetime contract". Shaughnessy introduced a red and white color scheme for the Maryland uniforms, which replaced the longstanding combination of black and gold. He installed the T formation, and mentored quarterback Tommy Mont, whom he compared favorably with Frankie Albert. He also praised Terrapins fullback Jack Wright and likened him to Norm Standlee. In 1942, the Terrapins amassed a 7–2 record under Shaughnessy, and the Associated Press assessed it was a [...] "pretty fair ball club". Mont finished the season {{as one of the}} top three passers in the nation. After the season, Shaughnessy left Maryland for Pittsburgh, a move he later called, [...] "the worst <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> did." ...|$|E
500|$|Black {{searches}} for Purdue in the hospital, but encounters Edward, who tells him a nurse was murdered years before by Woodcock. Edward believes the patients can be cured {{by having the}} evil drained from their bodies. The electricity is cut and the lights go off. Black and Stoller roam in the dark, finding {{the body of the}} night nurse. Purdue's voice is heard over the intercom, and the pair move to the office with the tannoy equipment to find him. Edward attacks with a knife—Stoller sees him shape-shift into Purdue, then Bear, and then Woodcock. However, Purdue fights and kills him, proclaiming it [...] "the sanest <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> did." [...] Black theorizes that Edward somehow absorbed the killers' violent impulses into himself, but was unable to refrain from acting upon them.|$|E
500|$|Hodad's has {{received}} positive reception for its burgers and style.

500|$|During {{his junior}} year, Presley began {{to stand out}} more among his classmates, largely because of his appearance: he grew out his sideburns and styled his hair with rose oil and Vaseline. In his free time, he would head down to Beale Street, the heart of Memphis's {{thriving}} blues scene, and gaze longingly at the wild, flashy clothes {{in the windows of}} Lansky Brothers. By his senior year, he was wearing them. Overcoming his reticence about performing outside the Lauderdale Courts, he competed in Humes's Annual [...] "Minstrel" [...] show in April 1953. Singing and playing guitar, he opened with [...] "Till I Waltz Again with You", a recent hit for Teresa Brewer. Presley recalled that the performance did much for his reputation: [...] "I wasn't popular in school... I failed music—only <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> failed. And then they entered me in this talent show... when I came onstage I heard people kind of rumbling and whispering and so forth, 'cause nobody knew I even sang. It was amazing how popular I became after that." ...|$|E
500|$|With the Nuremberg Trials {{underway}} and Japanese {{war crimes}} {{during the war}} coming to light, the announcement of Hashimoto's appearance in testimony against an American officer caused considerable controversy in the American news media. Though Hashimoto was himself known to be innocent of any war crimes and was generally treated well by his guards, he spoke little English and was subject to derision in the press. Among the public responses, socialite Evalyn Walsh McLean sent an angry telegram to Secretary of the Navy James Forrestal to complain, and U.S. Representative Robert L. Doughton publicly stated, [...] "It is the most contemptible <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> heard of to summon a Jap officer to testify against {{one of our own}} officers. I made my living practicing law before Navy courts and boards for 25 years, and this reaches an all-time low in courts, board or congressional investigation." [...] Columnist Robert Ruark accused the Navy of using Hashimoto to [...] "hype up" [...] the court martial. Even after his departure his testimony remained controversial, and the Chicago Sun criticized his trip, which it estimated to have cost $1,820.|$|E
500|$|Away from acting, Hawke {{directed}} the music video for the 1994 song [...] "Stay (I Missed You)," [...] by singer-songwriter Lisa Loeb, {{who was a}} member of Hawke's theater company at the time. In a 2012 interview, Hawke said that the song, which was included in Reality Bites, is the only number-one popular song by an unsigned artist in the history of music. He published his first novel in 1996, The Hottest State, about a love affair between a young actor and a singer. Hawke said of the novel, [...] "Writing the book had to do with dropping out of college, and with being an actor. I didn't want my whole life to go by and not do anything but recite lines. I wanted to try making something else. It was definitely the scariest <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> did. And it was just one of the best things I ever did." [...] The book met with a mixed reception. Entertainment Weekly said that Hawke [...] "opens himself to rough literary scrutiny in The Hottest State. If Hawke is serious... he'd do well to work awhile in less exposed venues." [...] The New York Times thought Hawke did [...] "a fine job of showing what it's like to be young and full of confusion", concluding that The Hottest State was ultimately [...] "a sweet love story".|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{told me a}} good deal," [...] said Trevor. [...] "It's one of the beastliest <b>things</b> <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> heard.

6000|$|... "Don't be angry, Charlie, but I cannot help it. The idea of your going, in disguise, I suppose, {{and trying}} to talk over the Jewish clothiers and cannie Scotch traders, {{is one of the}} funniest <b>things</b> <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> heard. And do you think the king was really in earnest?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There is one thing," [...] I said, {{to allay}} the fears I had aroused; [...] "they {{are the most}} {{sluggish}} <b>things</b> <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> saw crawl.

500|$|From {{his early}} {{adulthood}} until his death, White was a Freemason {{and served as}} Grand Master {{of the state of}} West Virginia in 1875. In that capacity, he laid the cornerstone of the capitol building at Wheeling. Prior to his relocation to Wheeling, he was also Master of the Clinton Lodge of Masons in Romney. On October 26, 1899, he gave an address according to Grand Lodge ritual at the cornerstone laying ceremony of the new school in Wellsburg. White attended the 100th anniversary of the interment of George Washington on December 14, 1899 and was chosen by the Grand Lodge of Virginia as the chief Grand Marshal of the Masonic ceremonies while attending the observance. He and his staff had full charge of the procession and all matters of the celebration. A reproduction of Washington's funeral services were held at Mount Vernon, and White served as a commander of the occasion, where he stood beside President William McKinley during his address to those in attendance. Prior to the anniversary, in November 1899, the National Christian Association published sheets in the anti-secret society publication Christian Cynosure in which they denied Washington's Freemasonry affiliations. White released a statement in which he remarked: [...] "This attack is the meanest <b>thing</b> <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> saw in a Christian publication." [...] He further went on to illustrate a historic narrative citing the dates of Washington's Masonic activities and affiliations.|$|E

2500|$|Max Brenner {{restaurants}} offer a large {{selection of}} chocolate-based dishes, including chocolate waffles and crepes, fondues, ice creams, hot chocolate drinks, smoothies, and chocolate martinis.
