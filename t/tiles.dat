5|$|A normal tiling is a {{tessellation}} {{for which}} every tile is topologically {{equivalent to a}} disk, the intersection of any two <b>tiles</b> is a single connected set or the empty set, and all <b>tiles</b> are uniformly bounded.

5|$|More formally, a {{tessellation}} or tiling is a {{cover of}} the Euclidean plane by a countable number of closed sets, called <b>tiles,</b> such that the <b>tiles</b> intersect only on their boundaries. These <b>tiles</b> may be polygons or any other shapes. Many tessellations are formed from {{a finite number of}} prototiles in which all <b>tiles</b> in the tessellation are congruent to the given prototiles. If a geometric shape {{can be used as a}} prototile to create a tessellation, the shape is said to tessellate or to tile the plane. The Conway criterion is a sufficient but not necessary set of rules for deciding if a given shape <b>tiles</b> the plane periodically without reflections: some <b>tiles</b> fail the criterion but still tile the plane. No general rule has been found for determining if a given shape can tile the plane or not, which means there are many unsolved problems concerning tessellations.|$|E
5|$|The hull is {{constructed}} from a high-tensile micro-alloy steel, developed by Swedish steel manufacturer SSAB, and improved by BHP of Australia, which was lighter {{and easier to}} weld than the HY-80 or HY-100 nickel-alloy steel used in contemporary submarine construction projects, while providing better results in explosion bulge testing. The submarines are covered in a skin of anechoic <b>tiles</b> to minimise detection by sonar: Collins was retrofitted with the <b>tiles</b> after the standard sonar signature of the submarine had been established, while the other five boats were covered during construction. These <b>tiles</b> were developed by the Australian DSTO: as the United States and United Kingdom would not share their information on the <b>tiles</b> used on their nuclear submarines, Australian researchers had to develop the <b>tiles</b> from scratch. The <b>tiles</b> were moulded {{in the shape of}} the hull, and are secured by a commercial adhesive normally used to fix cat's eyes to road surfaces: although British and American submarines are often seen with missing <b>tiles,</b> as of March 2007, none have been lost from a Collins-class boat.|$|E
5|$|The {{matching}} rules distinguish {{sides of the}} <b>tiles,</b> and entail that <b>tiles</b> may be juxtaposed in certain particular ways but not in others. Two ways to describe these {{matching rules}} are shown in {{the image on the}} right. In one form, <b>tiles</b> must be assembled such that the curves on the faces match in color and position across an edge. In the other, <b>tiles</b> must be assembled such that the bumps on their edges fit together.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} XCSF extended with <b>tile</b> coding prediction: each classifier implements a <b>tile</b> coding approximator; {{the genetic}} algorithm {{is used to}} adapt both classifier conditions (i. e., to partition the problem) and the parameters of each approximator; thus XCSF evolves an ensemble of <b>tile</b> coding approximators instead of the typical monolithic approximator used in reinforcement learning. The paper reports a comparison between (i) XCSF with <b>tile</b> coding prediction and (ii) plain <b>tile</b> coding. The results show that XCSF with <b>tile</b> coding always reaches optimal performance, it usually learns {{as fast as the}} best parameterized <b>tile</b> coding, and it can be faster than the typical <b>tile</b> coding setting. In addition, the analysis of the evolved <b>tile</b> coding ensembles shows that XCSF actually adapts local approximators following what is currently considered the best strategy to adapt the <b>tile</b> coding parameters in a given problem. ...|$|R

5|$|The pre-1980 subway {{stations}} of the Bloor–Danforth line follow a two-colour background and trim theme and use the unique Toronto Subway font on the stations' walls. The tiling theme {{was influenced by the}} Broad Street Subway in Philadelphia and used a cycle that was similar to the design employed on the Yonge subway. This design consists of two colours for the <b>tiles,</b> one for main wall <b>tiles</b> and another for trim <b>tiles</b> near the ceiling of the stations. The station names on the main wall <b>tiles</b> use the colour of the trim <b>tiles</b> and vice versa, except that some of the station names of the trim <b>tiles</b> are white instead of the main wall tile colour for readability.|$|E
5|$|An isohedral tiling is {{a special}} {{variation}} of a monohedral tiling in which all <b>tiles</b> {{belong to the same}} transitivity class, that is, all <b>tiles</b> are transforms of the same prototile under the symmetry group of the tiling.

40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the vulnerability of roof <b>tile</b> systems and metal shutters to roof <b>tile</b> debris. Three phases addressed the performance of <b>tile</b> roof systems and metal shutters impacted by roof <b>tile</b> debris. The first phase experimentally evaluated the <b>tile</b> fragment size and quantity generated by a <b>tile</b> striking a <b>tile</b> roof system. The second phase experimentally quantified the puncture vulnerability of common metal panel shutter systems as a function of <b>tile</b> fragment impact speed. The third phase provided context for interpretation of the experimental results through the use of a <b>tile</b> trajectory model. The results provide supporting evidence that while metal panel window shutters provide significant protection against a prevalent form of windborne debris, these systems are vulnerable to <b>tile</b> fragment puncture in design level tropical cyclones.

5|$|In {{the first}} stratum, a {{courtyard}} surrounded by several rooms, {{which is part}} of a large courtyard building, was discovered. The remains of the structure included the foundations and fragments of roof <b>tiles,</b> which most likely, covered the rooms and were found on the surface. The source of the roof <b>tiles</b> is the port of Marseilles, France, and most were stamped with the heart-shaped emblem of the Roux Frères roof-tile factory. The roof <b>tiles</b> indicate that the building was erected {{at the end of the}} nineteenth century CE. Several other roof <b>tiles</b> were stamped with a swan symbol, these were probably imported in a later phase of the building’s existence, at the beginning of the twentieth century, for the purpose of repair.

5|$|Penrose tilings {{are simple}} {{examples}} of aperiodic tilings {{of the plane}}. A tiling is a covering of the plane by <b>tiles</b> with no overlaps or gaps; the <b>tiles</b> normally have {{a finite number of}} shapes, called prototiles, and a set of prototiles is said to admit a tiling or tile the plane if there is a tiling of the plane using only <b>tiles</b> congruent to these prototiles. The most familiar tilings (e.g., by squares or triangles) are periodic: a perfect copy of the tiling can be obtained by translating all of the <b>tiles</b> by a fixed distance in a given direction. Such a translation is called a period of the tiling; more informally, this means that a finite region of the tiling repeats itself in periodic intervals. If a tiling has no periods it is said to be non-periodic. A set of prototiles is said to be aperiodic if it <b>tiles</b> the plane but every such tiling is non-periodic; tilings by aperiodic sets of prototiles are called aperiodic tilings.|$|E
