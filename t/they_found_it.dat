5|$|In 2006, {{researchers}} of Oman's Sultan Qaboos University published {{their findings}} from a chemical {{investigation into the}} leaves in which <b>they</b> <b>found</b> <b>it</b> contained semiglabrin, semigalbrinol, and a new flavanone named apollineanin. One 2014 study revealed that pseudosemiglabrin extracted from the aerial parts of Tephrosia apollinea had an antiproliferative effect on cancer cell lines.|$|E
5|$|The {{next day}} a patrol from the 9th Parachute Battalion reconnoitred the Château Saint Come. <b>They</b> <b>found</b> <b>it</b> abandoned, but the {{presence}} of clothing, equipment, a half-eaten meal and a payroll containing 50,000 French francs betrayed the recent German occupancy.|$|E
5|$|At {{about the}} same time, another group of Hatanaka's rebels led by Captain Takeo Sasaki went to Prime Minister Suzuki's office, intent on killing him. When <b>they</b> <b>found</b> <b>it</b> empty, they machine-gunned the office and set the {{building}} on fire, then left for his home. Hisatsune Sakomizu had warned Suzuki, and he escaped minutes before the would-be assassins arrived. After setting fire to Suzuki's home, {{they went to the}} estate of Kiichirō Hiranuma to assassinate him. Hiranuma escaped through a side gate and the rebels burned his house as well. Suzuki spent the rest of August under police protection, spending each night in a different bed.|$|E

5000|$|Ayotzinco was {{the first}} name that was given by Chichimecas to the town when <b>they</b> <b>founded</b> <b>it.</b> Ayotzinco means “Where the turtles sunbathe”, in the Nahuatl language. Ayotzinco's exact date of {{founding}} is uncertain, but it is approximately 800 years old. When Spaniards arrived, they changed the name to “Ayotzingo” because of the pronunciation, {{as they did with}} many other words in Náhuatl.|$|R
5000|$|In 1994, Carson and {{his wife}} started the Carson Scholars Fund, which awards {{scholarships}} to students in grades 4-11 for [...] "academic excellence and humanitarian qualities". <b>They</b> <b>founded</b> <b>it</b> after reading that U.S. students ranked second to last in terms of math and science testing among 22 countries. They also noticed that schools awarded athletes with trophies, whereas honor students only received [...] "a pin or certificate." ...|$|R
5|$|Lutetium, {{derived from}} the Latin Lutetia (Paris), was {{independently}} discovered in 1907 by French scientist Georges Urbain, Austrian mineralogist Baron Carl Auer von Welsbach, and American chemist Charles James. <b>They</b> <b>found</b> <b>it</b> as an impurity in ytterbia, which was thought by Swiss chemist Jean Charles Galissard de Marignac to consist entirely of ytterbium. The scientists proposed different names for the elements: Urbain chose neoytterbium and lutecium, whereas Welsbach chose aldebaranium and cassiopeium (after Aldebaran and Cassiopeia). Both of these articles accused the other man of publishing results based on those of the author.|$|E
5|$|Red Cloud's actions gave E Company {{time and}} warning to blunt the Chinese offensive, {{eventually}} repelling the attack. His actions are also credited with allowing his company to evacuate several others {{wounded in the}} attack. When members of the 2nd Battalion returned to the hill and arrived at Red Cloud's position to recover his body the next morning, <b>they</b> <b>found</b> <b>it</b> {{was surrounded by a}} large number of dead Chinese troops.|$|E
5|$|The {{official}} {{music video}} {{was directed by}} Japanese director Yusuke Tanaka. The video features Perfume as robots, controlled by an automated-computer to perform human-like interactions such as eating, dancing, smiling and crying. Some verses and the choruses feature the group dancing to the song. It ends with member Nocchi pulling the power-plug from member A-chan's back, shutting down the computer and Perfume. The members stated that <b>they</b> <b>found</b> <b>it</b> interesting to try and imitate the image of themselves as robots and dolls and found the choreography {{to be the most}} powerful that they've done so far.|$|E

50|$|No Cause for Concern is {{the first}} studio album by Vice Squad. It was {{originally}} released in 1981 by Zonophone, a division of EMI. Although it wasn't released by Riot City Records the band {{decided to use the}} Riot City name as it was a label <b>they</b> <b>founded.</b> <b>It</b> was later re-released by Dojo with two bonus tracks and Captain Oi! with the same two bonus tracks and six more tracks.|$|R
5|$|The team's founders enjoy playing {{co-operative}} multiplayer {{games and}} are passionate about them, as they allow players to play alongside each other instead of against each other. In addition, <b>they</b> <b>found</b> <b>it</b> {{more fun than}} the typical competitive multiplayer experience. However, they thought {{that this type of}} game was not well-developed, and often encouraged players to complete objectives alone. As a result, the company decided to develop a game which tasks players to deploy strategy and work with other players, leading to the development of both Left 4 Dead and Evolve.|$|E
5|$|Although some in {{the front}} of the Mexican ranks wavered, {{soldiers}} in the rear pushed them on. As the troops massed against the walls, Texians were forced to lean over the walls to shoot, leaving them exposed to Mexican fire. Travis became one of the first defenders to die, shot while firing his shotgun into the soldiers below him, though one source says that he drew his sword and stabbed a Mexican officer who had stormed the wall before succumbing to his injury. Few of the Mexican ladders reached the walls. The few soldiers who were able to climb the ladders were quickly killed or beaten back. As the Texians discharged their previously loaded rifles, however, <b>they</b> <b>found</b> <b>it</b> increasingly difficult to reload while attempting to keep Mexican soldiers from scaling the walls.|$|E
5|$|Armstrong and Ward {{transcribed}} intonation in {{a system}} where lines and dots correspond to stressed and unstressed syllables, respectively, and vertical position corresponds to pitch. Their method of transcribing intonation was anticipated by the one used in H. S. Perera and Daniel Jones's (1919) reader for Sinhalese, and the preface to Handbook of English Intonation notes an inspiration in Hermann Klinghardt's notation for intonation. Klinghardt said his book {{would have been impossible}} without Daniel Jones; his exercises also share similarities to Jones's intonation curves. Armstrong and Ward used a system of discrete dots and marks to mark the intonation contour because <b>they</b> <b>found</b> <b>it</b> easier for learners of English to follow than a continuous line.|$|E

50|$|Stand Strong Stand Proud is {{the second}} studio album by Vice Squad. It is the final album to feature the band's {{original}} lineup. It was originally released in 1982 by Zonophone, a division of EMI.

5|$|In October 1960, {{the group}} left Koschmider's club {{to work at}} the Top Ten Club, which Peter Eckhorn ran, as he offered the group more money and a {{slightly}} better place to sleep. In doing so they broke their contract with Koschmider. When Best and McCartney went back to the Bambi Kino to retrieve their belongings <b>they</b> <b>found</b> <b>it</b> in almost total darkness. As a snub to Koschmider, McCartney found a condom, attached it to a nail on the concrete wall of the room, and set it alight. There was no real damage done, but Koschmider reported them both for attempted arson. Best and McCartney spent three hours in a local prison and were subsequently deported, as was George Harrison, for working under the legal age limit, on 30 November 1960.|$|E
5|$|Orci and Kurtzman {{experimented with}} {{numerous}} robots from the franchise, ultimately selecting the characters most popular among the filmmakers {{to form the}} final cast. Bay acknowledged {{that most of the}} Decepticons were selected before their names or roles were developed, as Hasbro had to start designing the toys. Some of their names were changed because Bay was upset that they had been leaked. Optimus, Megatron, Bumblebee and Starscream were the only characters present in each version of the script. Arcee was a female Transformer introduced by Orci and Kurtzman, but she was cut because <b>they</b> <b>found</b> <b>it</b> difficult to explain robotic gender; Bay also disliked her motorcycle form, which he found too small. An early idea to have the Decepticons simultaneously strike multiple places around the world was also dropped.|$|E
5|$|Pembroke lodged his {{prisoner}} in Deddington in Oxfordshire. On 10 June, while Pembroke was away, Warwick forcibly carried away Gaveston to Warwick Castle. Here, {{in the presence}} of Warwick, Lancaster and other magnates, Gaveston was sentenced to death at an improvised court. On 19 June he was taken to a place called Blacklow Hillon Lancaster's landsand decapitated. According to the Annales Londonienses chronicle, four shoemakers brought the corpse back to Warwick, but he refused to accept it, and ordered them to take it back to where <b>they</b> <b>found</b> <b>it.</b> Gaveston's body was eventually taken to Oxford by some Dominican friars, and in 1315, King Edward finally had it buried at Kings Langley.|$|E

5|$|The {{game was}} {{developed}} in the 1970s and 1980s by Viggo Kann, Kimmo Eriksson and Olle Johansson, three children who had played the game Adventure and wanted to create a similar game in Swedish. The Cottage began as a collection of smaller games the three had previously developed on their own, with the player moving through an amusement arcade to choose what to play; as <b>they</b> <b>found</b> <b>it</b> more fun to move through the arcade than to play the games, they ended up expanding the area to explore and removing most of the smaller games. Several thousand copies of the IBM PC release were sold; despite this, the developers did not receive much money from it outside of pre-paid royalties. The game had a cult-like status among Oden users at the time, and was commercially important to the computer center in Stockholm.|$|E
5|$|The {{invasion}} initially met little resistance, as the Burmese {{forces were}} {{too large for}} the small guard posts around the border. Upon hearing of the Burmese invasion, Maha Chakkraphat mobilized his kingdom, then gathered his forces at Suphanburi, a town just west of Ayutthaya. When Tabinshwehti and his army arrived at the walled town of Kanchanaburi, <b>they</b> <b>found</b> <b>it</b> completely deserted. About a month into the invasion, mid-November 1548, the King of Burma then continued his march eastward, capturing the villages of Ban Thuan, Kaphan Tru and Chorakhe Sam Phan. The Burmese continued their advance and captured the ancient town of Uthong {{as well as the}} villages of Don Rakhang and Nong Sarai and closing in on Suphanburi. When the Burmese attacked the town, Siamese defenders could not withstand the onslaught and retreated towards Ayutthaya. Tabinshwehti ordered his army southeast along two canals, and crossed the Chao Phraya river near Phong Phaeng. From here he encamped his army directly north of the Siamese capital of Ayutthaya on a field called the Lumpli plain.|$|E
5|$|To {{reestablish}} their {{supply lines}} and retake {{the towns of}} Bardaï, Zouar and Wour, the Libyans sent a task-force of 2,000 troops with T-62 tanks and heavy support by the Libyan Air Force into the Tibesti. The offensive started successfully, expelling the GUNT from its key strongholds, also {{through the use of}} napalm. This attack ultimately backfired, causing the prompt reaction of Habré, who sent 2,000 FANT soldiers to link with the GUNT forces. Also Mitterrand reacted forcefully, ordering a mission which parachuted fuel, food, ammunition and anti-tank missiles to the rebels, and also infiltrated military personnel. Through this action, the French made clear that they no longer felt committed to keep south of the Red Line, and were ready to act whenever <b>they</b> <b>found</b> <b>it</b> necessary.|$|E

5|$|When {{the last}} glacial period ended, the hunter gatherers of the Palaeolithic period {{followed}} the animal herds {{across the land}} between continental Europe and Britain. Then, as conditions continued to improve and vegetation became more able to support a greater diversity of animals, the annual range of seasonal movement by Mesolithic communities decreased, and people became more fixed to particular localities. Until about 6,000BC, Mesolithic people appear to have exploited their environment as <b>they</b> <b>found</b> <b>it.</b> As communities came {{to rely on a}} smaller territorial range and as population levels increased, attempts began to be made to modify or control the natural world. In the Great Wold Valley, pollen samples of Mesolithic date indicate that the forest cover in the area was being disturbed and altered by man, and that open grasslands were being created.|$|E
5|$|On May 21, 1832, a small raiding party {{made up of}} some {{independent}} minded braves from Keokuk's village or the Fox {{village at}} Dubuque's Mines carried out a raid on the settlement at present-day Savanna, Illinois on the Plum River. The party originated west of the Mississippi River and were probably motivated {{by a desire to}} collect needed supplies. When the small raiding party arrived at the settlement <b>they</b> <b>found</b> <b>it</b> practically deserted: only three men were present. Of the six men originally at the settlement, three had left when the raiding party arrived: Blundell was away, Upton was hunting nearby, and Davidson had left the area in search of a horse. Of the three men left at the settlement, Hays and Goss were trying to round up livestock, while only Pierce remained at the blockhouse. Pierce heard a dog barking outside and looked up to see a small band of Native Americans creeping along the river's edge. He immediately sounded the alarm and Hays and Goss sprinted for the blockhouse. Gunshots started to explode behind the men as they approached the protection of their makeshift fortification.|$|E
5|$|The letters {{first learned}} by a child, {{commonly}} their own name, {{may come to}} have lasting positive associations. Hoorens and Todorova tested this by looking for a name-letter effect in bilingual subjects where their mother tongue alphabet was Cyrillic and their foreign-language alphabet Roman. Because learning a foreign language at a later age does not typically involve extra attention given to name letters, {{there should be no}} name-letter effect in the foreign-language alphabet, only in the first-language alphabet. Results of a study with 100 Bulgarian subjects who at a later age learned English, German, French or Spanish revealed a name-letter effect for the Roman alphabet as well as for Cyrillic. The researchers concluded mastery pleasure is not the principle cause of the name-letter effect. In a follow-up study Hoorens, Nuttin, Herman and Pavakanun tested the strength of the name-letter effect among elementary-school children, in a cross-sectional experimental design involving Flemish and Hungarian second, fourth, and sixth graders. Instead of finding the name-effect to decrease with age as might be expected, <b>they</b> <b>found</b> <b>it</b> increased, thus proving that mastery pleasure is not the principal cause. They also investigated name-letter effects in bilingual Thai subjects, some of whom had learned the English alphabet {{at the same time as}} the Thai alphabet, and others who had learned it later. They found that the time at which students had learned the second alphabet made no difference in the strength of the name-letter effect, thereby ruling out mastery pleasure as a co-determinant.|$|E
