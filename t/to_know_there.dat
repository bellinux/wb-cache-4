25|$|No. 8 (Guards) Commando was {{a unit of}} the British Commandos {{and part}} of the British Army during the Second World War. The Commando was formed in June 1940 {{primarily}} from members of the Brigade of Guards. It was one of the units selected to be sent to the Middle East as part of Layforce. On arrival they became known as 'B' Battalion in an attempt at deception, not wanting the Axis forces <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>there</b> was a commando formation in the theatre of war. The commando participated in the Battle of Crete and around Tobruk before being disbanded in late 1941. After this, many of its personnel went on to serve in other commando units formed in the area, including the Special Air Service.|$|E

2500|$|The BBC needs <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>there</b> is {{a degree}} of dissatisfaction among the public. I think {{people want to see}} that EastEnders is {{populated}} by many different ethnic groups. Black people in real life run businesses, fall in and out of love, have fascinating and exciting lives. So why can't we in EastEnders. We are not all losers or nobodies so why can't the BBC show that?...I really felt so ineffectual as a character because I had nothing to get my teeth into - there were no great dramatic scenes or relationships. My character was never given anything meaningful to say and that was such a wasted opportunity. My son said I should get out of EastEnders because it wasn't doing me any good as an actress or as a black woman...I have got to speak out so that things can change." ...|$|E

2500|$|Prior to his death, Brendan Burke {{was known}} for his efforts to combat {{homophobia}} in hockey. Brendan, a student manager for the Miami University RedHawks hockey team, came out publicly in 2009 as an openly gay man through an article written for ESPN.com by John Buccigross. [...] Brendan appeared with father Brian on the Canadian channel TSN during an intermission of a nationally televised hockey game to discuss his sexuality and his father's acceptance. Brendan said, [...] "I think it's important my story is told to people {{because there are a lot}} of gay athletes out there and gay people working in pro sports that deserve <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>there</b> are safe environments where people are supportive regardless of your sexual orientation." [...] Brendan died in a car crash on February 5, 2010. He was 21 years old.|$|E
2500|$|On 28 October, after {{performing}} on V Graham Norton {{to promote the}} Singles compilation, Anderson {{made the decision to}} call it a day. This decision coincided with the release of the band's biography, Love and Poison on 3 November. On 5 November, the band announced {{that there would be no}} more projects under the Suede name for the foreseeable future – effectively announcing the end of the band, as they stated on their website: [...] "There will not be a new studio album until the band feel that the moment is artistically right to make one." [...] Anderson also made a personal statement saying: [...] "There has been speculation about record sales and chart positions, but the bottom line is I need to do whatever it takes to get my demon back." [...] Suede's last concert at the London Astoria on 13 December 2003 was a two-and-a-half-hour marathon show, split into two parts plus encore. Anderson made an announcement, saying, [...] "I just want you <b>to</b> <b>know.</b> <b>There</b> will be another Suede record. But not yet." [...] Later, Osman would reveal that as they were walking to the studio set, Anderson whispered into his ear: [...] "Let's not do this anymore." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Bruins volleyball {{team had}} an [...] "A" [...] squad and a {{developmental}} squad. A large blue curtain separated the two practice courts. Players were in constant competition {{to stay on}} the [...] "A" [...] squad. Scates used a scoring system for his players during the practices, and their position on the team depended on the points they were scoring in practice. The coaches with the development squad could recommend players to move up, and Scates would check scores and move an [...] "A" [...] court player down. The scoring system allowed the players <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>there</b> was nothing personal in the choices being made. John Speraw, a former player and current head coach at UCLA, commented [...] "the way he managed to make objective decisions was to stay fairly separate from the players. It was never personal. And once you graduated, he enjoyed the relationship that developed with his players." [...] He highly valued competitiveness in a player, and wanted to go into matches with players that hated to lose. UCLA alumnus Karch Kiraly noted a common thread in the players around him at UCLA: [...] "He recruited people that were like I was. We absolutely hated to lose and loved to win, and that's what the Bruins were like. They were a reflection of Al, and Al wanted to win every single match, every single season." ...|$|E
