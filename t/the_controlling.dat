Macroscopic {{analysis}} {{makes it}} possible to consider <b>the</b> radio <b>control</b> process as a whole and go from casual to regular for studies of complex systems and processes. The transition to a qualitatively new level of analysis involves the dynamic models use. In this case it is possible to set <b>the</b> required <b>control</b> time, laws to reduce the entropy of <b>the</b> <b>control</b> object, <b>the</b> relationship between the main parameters of <b>the</b> process <b>control.</b> Problem statement. Entropy is the objective characteristic of <b>control</b> precision. <b>The</b> collection of previously collected data on the properties of <b>the</b> <b>control</b> object, disturbances and other factors form the original information. Working information is extracted in <b>the</b> <b>control</b> process. <b>The</b> required amount of information to reduce <b>the</b> <b>control</b> object entropy it enables to consider the process of radio <b>control</b> in <b>the</b> dynamics. <b>The</b> radio <b>control</b> dynamic model (<b>the</b> dynamic equation), which reveals the laws of change of <b>the</b> <b>control</b> object entropy in conditions of <b>the</b> <b>control</b> information absence and <b>the</b> <b>control</b> information availability necessary to make. It should take into consideration that <b>the</b> <b>control</b> object entropy value and <b>the</b> <b>control</b> information amount reaches a certain limit value. The model should give the opportunity {{to take into account the}} basic radio characteristics of <b>the</b> <b>control</b> object channel. Theoretical results. A dynamic model which takes into account the relationship between the rate of change of control object entropy and the amount of information that goes on <b>the</b> <b>control</b> channel was proposed. The constant rate of object entropy increase in <b>the</b> <b>control</b> absence and <b>the</b> constant rate of object entropy decrease in <b>the</b> <b>control</b> organization were considered. Restrictions on the potentially possible entropy values and the information amount were included. The steady state situation was analyzed. The time during which <b>the</b> <b>control</b> process can be accomplished was established. The requirement to the relation between the entropy potential value and the quantity of information was determined. The relation between the relative error of <b>the</b> radio <b>control,</b> <b>the</b> <b>control</b> object entropy value and the starting information was established. Conclusion. The results make it possible to determine the pattern of <b>the</b> <b>control</b> object entropy change, both in terms of receipt control information, and if it is the reduction in a contingency situation. On the basis of the entropy analysis procedures set a limit on <b>the</b> relative radio <b>control</b> errors, required time and the maximum value of <b>the</b> <b>control</b> object entropy. Hourly and the entropy limit for <b>the</b> radio <b>control</b> process take account <b>the</b> radio <b>control</b> channel characteristics, channel bandwidth, signal power, noise power, and the relative error of control. ?? ????????? ????????????????? ??????? ? ??????? ???????? ??????????????? ?????????? ???????????? ??????, ??????? ????????? ??????????? ????? ????????? ????????? ???????? ??????? ?????????? ? ??????????? ??????????, ??????? ????????? ?? ?????? ??????????. ?????? ????????? ???????? ?????????? ???????? ??????? ??? ?????????? ?????????? ? ????????? ???????? ?????????? ???????? ? ???????? ??????????? ???????? ??????????. ??????????? ??????????? ?? ???????????? ????????? ???????? ???????? ? ?????????? ??????????. ???????????????? ???????? ??????????????? ??????. ??????????? ?????, ?? ??????? ??????? ?????????? ????? ???? ????????. ?????????? ?????????? ? ??????????? ????? ???????????? ????????? ????????? ???????? ? ??????????? ??????????. ??????????? ??????????? ????? ????????????? ??????? ???????????????, ????????? ???????? ??????? ?????????? ? ????????? ???????????. ?? ????????? ? ??????????? ???????????? ?? ??????? ??????????????? ?????? ?????? ??????????? ?????? ??????????, ???????? ??????? ? ???????? ????...|$|R

5|$|In 1919, in {{reaction}} to a plan of the policemen of the Boston Police Department to register with a union, Police Commissioner Edwin U. Curtis announced that such an act would not be tolerated. In August of that year, the American Federation of Labor issued a charter to the Boston Police Union. Curtis declared the union's leaders were guilty of insubordination and would be relieved of duty, but indicated he would cancel their suspension if the union was dissolved by September 4. The mayor of Boston, Andrew Peters, convinced Curtis to delay his action for a few days, but with no results, and Curtis suspended the union leaders on September 8. The following day, about three-quarters of the policemen in Boston went on strike. Coolidge, tacitly but fully in support of Curtis' position, closely monitored the situation but initially deferred to the local authorities. He anticipated that only a resulting measure of lawlessness could sufficiently prompt the public to understand and appreciate <b>the</b> <b>controlling</b> principle – that a policeman does not strike. That night and the next, there was sporadic violence and rioting in the unruly city. Peters, concerned about sympathy strikes by the firemen and others, called up some units of the Massachusetts National Guard stationed in the Boston area pursuant to an old and obscure legal authority, and relieved Curtis of duty.|$|E

On 9 June, she again left Norfolk, bound for San Pedro, California, where she joined Training Squadron 1, Base Force, United States Fleet.
