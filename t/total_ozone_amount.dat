Although it overlooked the 1982 article it concurred with the view that the Dobson unit should eventually be replaced by an appropriate SI unit and that the unit mmol m-2 was the most convenient and least cumbersome option. It expressed the hope that this unit would eventually supplant the Dobson Unit.

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{estimating}} the <b>total</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>amount</b> of an atmospheric {{column in the}} presence of stratospheric and tropospheric aerosols is studied by means of simulated spectral measurements for the five-wavelength Nimbus 4 BUV configuration and the six-wavelength Nimbus G TOMS configuration, and by analyzing such measurements with appropriate total ozone estimation procedures. The simulated spectral measurements were generated for forty different atmospheric models arrived at by varying the total ozone content and various aerosol parameters. A total of ten different values of the solar zenith angle and eight different values of the Lambert reflectivity of the underlying surface were used. It was found that the values of total ozone in an atmospheric column estimated by the five-wavelength procedure can be in error by about + or - 2 % as a result of particulate contamination encountered in the terrestrial atmosphere under average conditions. Errors due to tropospheric particulate contamination can be reduced significantly by taking appropriate advantage of the additional spectral measurement offered by the Nimbus G TOMS instrument...|$|E

40|$|Within an {{epidemiological}} study regarding {{the correlation between}} skin pathologies and personal ultraviolet (UV) exposure due to solar radiation, 14 field campaigns using polysulphone (PS) dosemeters were carried out at three different Italian sites (urban, semi-rural and rural) in every season of the year. A polysulphone calibration curve for each field experiment was obtained by measuring the ambient UV dose under almost clear sky conditions and the corresponding change in the PS film absorbance, prior and post exposure. Ambient UV doses were measured by well-calibrated broad-band radiometers and by electronic dosemeters. The dose-response relation was represented by the typical best fit to a third-degree polynomial and it was parameterized by a coefficient multiplying a cubic polynomial function. It was observed that the fit curves differed {{from each other in}} the coefficient only. It was assessed that the multiplying coefficient was affected by the solar UV spectrum at the Earth's surface whilst the polynomial factor depended on the photoinduced reaction of the polysulphone film. The mismatch between the polysulphone spectral curve and the CIE erythemal action spectrum was responsible for the variability among polysulphone calibration curves. The variability of the coefficient was related to the <b>total</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>amount</b> and the solar zenith angle.

The photochemical ozone generation at the Rūgtelikes station, located in the unpolluted forest area, is related to the reaction between natural volatile organic compounds emitted from the vegetation at low nitrogen oxide level. A more pronounced relationship between the UVB radiation intensity and the ground-level ozone concentration was found in 2003 and it could be related to specic meteorological conditions of the summer of 2003.

40|$|The <b>total</b> <b>ozone</b> <b>amount</b> is {{sensitive}} to the general circulation changes in the lower stratosphere due to the photochemically inactive nature of ozone there. In the equatorial region, such circulation changes arise from the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) of the stratospheric zonal wind and the El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO). In {{the first half of}} this study we present observational results of the long-term variations in the equatorial ozone field using the 11 year Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) data, by paying special attention to the longitudinal structure. In the latter half we try to understand quantitatively these variations by using a simple mechanistic relationship. We hypothesis that the ozone modulating processes are attributable to two dynamical effects, the advection effect and tropopause effect, owing to the strong vertical stratification of ozone existing just above the tropopause. The advection effect comes from the vertical motion which maintains the temperature structure, compensating for the radiative damping. The tropopause effect is associated with the altitude change of the tropopause. The total ozone variations in the tropics is discussed in terms of these two dynamical processes with the aid of mechanistic equations combined with the wind and sea surface temperature (SST) observations. The interactions between tropical and extratropical latitudes are beyond the scope of this study. Photochemical effects are also neglected.
