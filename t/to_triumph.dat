5|$|On 25 October 2015, Kane {{scored a}} hat-trick, {{including}} a penalty which he won himself, as Tottenham came from conceding a first-minute goal <b>to</b> <b>triumph</b> 5–1 away to Bournemouth at Dean Court. Eight days later, he recorded his fifth {{goal of the}} season with the final goal in a 3–1 win at home to Aston Villa. On 8 November 2015, he gave Tottenham a half-time lead against Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium, albeit in a 1–1 draw; this goal past Petr Čech was from his first touch of Danny Rose's long pass.|$|E

5|$|Wessex kings {{carried an}} aura of power and success, which made them {{increasingly}} powerful in the 920s, while most Continental houses were in military trouble and engaged in internecine warfare. While the civil wars and the Viking attacks on the Continent had spelled the end of unity of the Carolingian empire, which had already disintegrated into separate kingdoms, military success had enabled Æthelstan <b>to</b> <b>triumph</b> at home and to attempt {{to go beyond the}} reputation of a great heroic dynasty of warrior kings, in order to develop a Carolingian ideology of kingship.|$|E
5|$|Another {{important}} {{concept in}} Hippocratic medicine {{was that of}} a crisis, a point in the progression of disease at which either the illness would begin <b>to</b> <b>triumph</b> and the patient would succumb to death, or the opposite would occur and natural processes would make the patient recover. After a crisis, a relapse might follow, and then another deciding crisis. According to this doctrine, crises tend to occur on critical days, which were supposed to be a fixed time after the contraction of a disease. If a crisis occurred on a day far from a critical day, a relapse might be expected. Galen believed that this idea originated with Hippocrates, though it is possible that it predated him.|$|E
5|$|Rather {{than the}} typical anarchist interpretation, others have {{analysed}} the character as a Marxist (opposite to Batman's capitalist), arguing that anarchism requires the rejection of all authority in favor of uncontrolled freedom. The Joker rejects most authority, but retains his own, using his actions to coerce and consolidate power in himself and convert the masses to his own way of thinking, while eliminating any that oppose him. In The Killing Joke, the Joker is an abused member of the underclass who is driven insane by failings of the social system. The Joker rejects material needs, and his first appearance in Batman #1 sees him perpetrate crimes against Gotham's wealthiest men and the judge who had sent him to prison. Batman is wealthy, yet the Joker is able <b>to</b> <b>triumph</b> through his own innovations.|$|E

5|$|Taibbi {{begins the}} work by quoting from his 2008 book The Great Derangement, asserting he {{predicted}} {{the onslaught of}} fake news and {{the beginnings of the}} alt-right in society. He argues such societal factors helped set the tone for a climate in which Trump could ascend to the presidency. Taibbi writes that Trump's prior experiences in reality television gave him the tools <b>to</b> <b>triumph</b> in an era of post-truth politics. He criticizes the media for its coverage of Trump, describing how the candidate's inflammatory campaign rhetoric led to increased publicity. The book documents a chronology of the author's thoughts over time as he begins to realize Trump's increasing chances of success. Taibbi reflects back on the events after the election, concluding Trump won because he was able to harness the power of television.|$|E
5|$|The Dutch central {{division}} {{joined the}} battle {{at the head}} of the line shortly after the engagement of Triumph and Bedford, causing considerable damage to all of the British vessels, particularly Venerable. The British flagship was soon isolated in the midst of the Dutch van, engaging Vrijheid, Staaten General, Admiral Tjerk Hiddes De Vries and Wassenaar simultaneously. Despite the heavy odds Duncan continued to fight hard, the British succeeded in knocking out two opponents by wounding Captain Dooitze Eelkes Hinxt of Beschermer, which drifted eastwards in confusion, while shots from either Bedford or Triumph set a powder barrel on Hercules on fire. The blaze on the latter ship, which soon spread to the sails and rigging, prompted a lull in the battle as the crew of Hercules desperately attempted to extinguish the blaze and other Dutch ships scrambled to escape the burning vessel as it drifted through the melee. Shortly afterwards, the battered Wassenaar surrendered <b>to</b> <b>Triumph,</b> with Captain Holland dead on his quarterdeck. Triumph then moved on towards the battle between Vrijheid and Venerable, at which time the crew of Wassenaar raised their colours again after being fired on by a Dutch brig.|$|E

Magdeburg would be the only East German football club <b>to</b> <b>triumph</b> in a European competition.|$|E

25|$|While {{his support}} was strong among the local Virginia party activists who weigh heavily in primaries, {{it was not}} enough <b>to</b> <b>triumph</b> over his late-entering primary opponent, James Webb, who benefited from a strong {{military}} background, the support of well-known blogs such as the Daily Kos, and the endorsements of several national Democratic leaders. These endorsements for Webb, including that of Charles Schumer, head of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, were unusual for a primary and reflected Webb's perceived strengths as a candidate over Miller's.|$|E
25|$|Most {{characters}} {{accept the}} sandworms as an inevitable {{aspect of life}} on Arrakis because melange is a byproduct of their life cycle. In the plot Herbert's 1965 novel Dune, sandworms provide the danger and mystery of terra incognita, and the transformational experience that the protagonist Paul Atreides must go through <b>to</b> <b>triumph</b> over his enemies. Herbert believed great power and knowledge must come at some sort of price, and so Paul must risk being devoured by a sandworm and then madness after consuming sandworm extract (the Water of Life).|$|E

However, Nadal and Djokovic lost {{in the first round}} to Canadians Milos Raonic and Vasek Pospisil. The next week, Nadal was the top seed at the Cincinnati Masters, losing in the quarterfinals to 2006 Australian Open finalist Marcos Baghdatis.|$|E
25|$|The Grand Final {{against the}} Sydney Roosters {{was always going}} to be a tense battle with neither club having much affection for the other. The Bulldogs came from 13-6 down at halftime <b>to</b> <b>triumph</b> 16-13.

25|$|In 1978 Clare stormed {{through the}} National League again and {{qualified}} for the final {{for the third year}} in-a-row. Once again Kilkenny provided the opposition and, once again, an interesting game ensued. Clare's ability to get goals once proved the defining feature of a close game as McCarthy's side went on to win by 3–10 to 1–10. This victory buoyed up Clare for the provincial championship where they qualified for a second consecutive Munster showdown with Cork. Over 54,000 spectators turned up at Semple Stadium that day to see Clare attempt to dethrone Cork. At half-time it looked as if Clare were about <b>to</b> <b>triumph</b> as they trailed by 0–5 to 0–3 after Cork recorded thirteen wides.
