5|$|Cirrus {{comes in}} four {{distinct}} species; Cirrus castellanus, fibratus, spissatus, and uncinus; which are each {{divided into four}} varieties: intortus, vertebratus, radiatus, and duplicatus. Cirrus castellanus is a species that has cumuliform tops caused by high-altitude convection rising up from the main cloud body. Cirrus fibratus looks striated and {{is the most common}} cirrus species. Cirrus uncinus clouds are hooked and are the form that is usually called mare's tails. Of the varieties, Cirrus intortus has an extremely contorted shape, and cirrus radiatus has large, radial bands of cirrus clouds that stretch across the sky. Kelvin–Helmholtz waves are a form of cirrus intortus that has been <b>twisted</b> <b>into</b> loops by vertical wind shear.|$|E

25|$|Due to {{the extreme}} dangers {{inherent}} with no man's land, specialized tools and methods were implemented to make the process quieter and more effective. Pickets, or metal posts, were originally used {{to hold up the}} wire and were hammered in by a muffled mallet. However, this still produced noise, rendering the sappers targets. Therefore, screw pickets or 'cork-screws' were produced. These looped steel posts had a drill-like end, allowing it to be <b>twisted</b> <b>into</b> the ground noiselessly and the wire then wrapped around it.|$|E

25|$|The overall form of {{the city}} was an {{irregular}} rectangle. The ideal square of the city had been <b>twisted</b> <b>into</b> the {{form of the}} Big Dipper for astrological reasons, and also to follow the bank of the Wei River. The eight avenues divided the city into nine districts. These nine main districts were subdivided into 160 walled 1×1li wards. About 50-100 families lived in each ward. Historically, Chang'an grew in four phases: the first from 200-195BC when the palaces were built; the second 195-180BC when the outer city walls were built; the third between 141-87BC with a peak at 100BC; and the fourth from 1BC-24AD when it was destroyed.|$|E
25|$|The third {{member of}} the company is Sandy (Siobhan Hayes), who is there as the office trainee, getting work {{experience}} for her NVQ level 2.

Another {{member of the}} office is the useless Clive (Tom George) or as Martin calls him, 'young, er, thing', who often turns publicity stunts into bloodbaths. He first appears in series three, after Sandy leaves the company to become a nurse (although due to her fiddling with the accounts, she still gets paid).|$|E
25|$|Between 5 and 8 March, {{police would}} find six further bodies of young females at 25 Cromwell Street. Each victim had been {{extensively}} mutilated, and each body bore evidence {{of having been}} subjected to extreme sexual abuse prior to the act of murder. For example, the third set of remains discovered in the cellar was found with a length of cloth wrapped around the skull, and an oval of adhesive tape 16 inches in circumference found with the remains had likely been used to gag this victim, whose ankles and wrists were also bound with a large section of rope. Also found in this grave was a large, serrated knife. The second set of remains was found with a section of tubing <b>twisted</b> <b>into</b> a U-shape alongside her severed limbs, and her skull was found encased in adhesive tape which had been wrapped around the section where her face had been 11 or 12 times, with a narrow plastic tube inserted where the nasal cavities had been in an obvious effort to facilitate her breathing prior to her murder. Each set of remains was missing numerous bones, particularly phalange bones, although when questioned as to this ominous paradigm, Fred refused to divulge the reason or whereabouts of the bones missing from each set of remains.|$|E
30|$|In this study, we {{describe}} methods for producing high performance CNT-based torsional and tensile artificial muscles by processes that involve inserting <b>twist</b> <b>into</b> forest-drawn CNT sheets. All of these muscles use yarn volume expansion (produced either electrochemically or by thermal expansion of a yarn guest) to reversibly generate yarn contraction and yarn untwist [1, 2]. Yarn coiling, produced by inserting high <b>twist</b> <b>into</b> the CNT yarn, dramatically amplifies tensile stroke and work capabilities {{compared with those}} for non-coiled yarn [2].|$|R

500|$|Although {{the ship}} was not damaged by Japanese forces, the Monterey {{was one of several}} ships damaged by the typhoon that hit Admiral William Halsey's Third Fleet on December 18–19, 1944. The Third Fleet lost three destroyers and over 800 men during the typhoon. The Monterey was damaged by a fire, which was started by several of the ship's {{aircraft}} tearing loose from their cables and colliding on the hangar deck. During the storm, Ford narrowly avoided becoming a casualty himself. As he was going to his battle station on the bridge of the ship in the early morning of December 18, the ship rolled twenty-five degrees, which caused Ford to lose his footing and slide {{toward the edge of the}} deck. The two-inch steel ridge around the edge of the carrier slowed him enough so he could roll, and he <b>twisted</b> <b>into</b> the catwalk below the deck. As he later stated, [...] "I was lucky; I could have easily gone overboard." ...|$|E

An auto repair shop located along the highway sustained significant damage {{with all of the}} bay windows being blown out and 17 nearby storage sheds were destroyed. Several trees were knocked down onto railroad tracks before the tornado damaged another mobile home and dissipated.

500|$|The pier, {{which cost}} £11,740 to build, {{originally}} {{consisted of a}} promenade [...] long and [...] wide, extending to [...] wide at the pier-head. The bulk of the pier was constructed from cast iron, with a wooden deck laid on top. The cast iron piles on which the structure rests were inserted using Birch's screw pile process; the screw-tipped piles were <b>twisted</b> <b>into</b> the sand until they hit bedrock. This made construction much quicker and easier, and guaranteed that the pier had a solid foundation. The cast iron columns, [...] in diameter, were filled with concrete for stability at intervals of , and supported by struts that were on average were slightly more than [...] thick. The pier's promenade deck is lined with wooden benches with ornamental cast iron backs. At intervals along the pier are hexagonal kiosks built around 1900 in wood and glass with minaret roofs topped with decorative finials. On opening two of the kiosks were occupied by a bookstall and confectionery stall and the kiosks near {{the ends of the}} pier were seated shelters.|$|E
500|$|Journalist Kevin O'Flynn {{writes that}} since heavy {{drinking}} {{had taken place}} at the party, the evidence against Streltsov was [...] "confused and contradictory", even from Lebedeva herself. But the Soviet team coach, Gavriil Kachalin, claimed shortly before Streltsov's death that influence from {{high up in the}} Communist Party dictated that the player could not be helped; Kachalin said that police told him of Khrushchev's personal involvement, fuelled by a grudge held by Furtseva. According to Soviet Union team-mate Nikita Simonyan, speaking in 2006, Streltsov wrote home to his mother [...] "saying he was taking the blame for someone else". Streltsov and Lebedeva did sleep together, Simonyan said, and he did not believe their meeting had been set up, but he was unsure about whether or not Streltsov had raped her. Simonyan proposed that consensual sex could have been <b>twisted</b> <b>into</b> a rape accusation by [...] "the system", which he said bore ill will towards the Torpedo forward. However, in the same interview Simonyan revealed incriminating photographs of both Lebedeva and Streltsov {{from the time of the}} trial, including one in which the Torpedo player's face [...] "was streaked from nose to cheekbone with three parallel scratches". [...] "here is the possibility that the photographs were doctored or the injuries inflicted at a later date", Wilson comments, [...] "but Soviet justice rarely required such damning evidence." [...] Streltsov's wife of just over a year, Alla, filed for divorce soon after the accusations were made. Apart from Streltsov himself, the only members of the team present at his trial were Ogonkov and Tatushin, who appeared as witnesses.|$|E
500|$|... {{the film}} had {{a rating of}} 29% on review {{aggregator}} website Rotten Tomatoes. Vincent Canby of The New York Times noted that Madonna, left to her own devices and her own canny pace, is a very engaging comedian. [...] "When Madonna's no-nonsense pragmatism isn't being <b>twisted</b> <b>into</b> poses of lovable eccentricity, the actress is sexy and funny and never for a minute sentimental. At times she looks amazingly like Marilyn Monroe, but the personality is her own, more resilient and more knowing. As the WASP-y sleeping prince, Mr. Dunne gives the most stylishly comic performance of a career that's been largely underrated by the public. Though {{he seems to be}} Madonna's foil, he provides the movie with its backbone, even in its most ludicrous moments. He may well {{be one of the most}} truly sophisticated straight men in the business today." [...] However, he ended the review by saying that the film was short on outright guffaws. Hal Hinson of The Washington Post gave the film a mixed review, commenting that [...] "you may not feel as if you've seen a movie. You may not quite know what you've seen" [...] and that although he laughed too much, the film [...] "is outrageously inept, but not in a routine manner". Hinson also criticized the work of Foley, noting that he [...] "doesn't have the skill to sustain a cartoon style." [...] Philip Wuntch of The Dallas Morning News commented that the film is a deft and daffy comedy performance; Madonna is great with the one-liners. [...] As a movie star, Madonna may be an acquired taste. But one thing is certain: acquiring this particular taste is going to be an enjoyable experience." [...] Jay Boyar of the Orlando Sentinel gave a negative review saying, [...] "Luckily for her, Madonna can sing, and use it to save herself from this disgrace of a movie." ...|$|E
