5|$|A {{few days}} after the attack on Pearl Harbor, Tokiwa and the other minelayers of the 19th Division of the 4th Fleet escorted two troop {{transports}} <b>that</b> <b>carried</b> the occupation forces for the Gilbert Islands. In January 1942, the ship participated in Operation R (the invasion of Rabaul and Kavieng) and returned to Kwajalein Atoll afterwards. She was damaged by American carrier aircraft in February 1942 and forced to return home for repairs. Tokiwa returned to Truk on 14 July, and reoccupied Makin Atoll the following month after the Makin Raid.|$|E
5|$|Another {{solution}} to {{the vulnerability of the}} RAF bombers was to fly at night, which was taken up as the primary tactic of Bomber Command. The Mk. X proved {{to be very difficult to}} read at night and bombers <b>that</b> <b>carried</b> it were quickly refitted with the earlier Mk. VII or Mk. IX sight. The Norden was unable to work at night at all; the bomb aimer had to locate the target long in advance of the drop point using a built-in telescope and targets were simply not visible at the required distances in low light.|$|E
2500|$|From the {{structural}} perspective, haloalkanes {{can be classified}} according to the connectivity of the carbon atom to which the halogen is attached. In primary (1°) haloalkanes, the carbon <b>that</b> <b>carries</b> the halogen atom is only attached to one other alkyl group. An example is chloroethane (...) [...] In secondary (2°) haloalkanes, the carbon <b>that</b> <b>carries</b> the halogen atom has two C–C bonds. In tertiary (3°) haloalkanes, the carbon <b>that</b> <b>carries</b> the halogen atom has three C–C bonds.|$|R

Based on the Levasseur PL.4 developed for the Aéronavale to operate from the French aircraft carrier Béarn, the PL.8 was a conventional, single-bay, wood and fabric-covered biplane <b>that</b> <b>carried</b> a crew of two in a side-by-side, open cockpit.|$|E
5|$|Built in 1910, SS El Occidente {{was one of}} four sister ships <b>that</b> <b>carried</b> cargo and {{a limited}} number of {{passengers}} for the Morgan Line. She was acquired by the U.S. Army after the United States entered World War I in April 1917, and converted to carry horses and mules to France. In February 1918, she fought a 20-minute gun battle with two German submarines, destroying the periscope of one. In August 1918, the ship was transferred to the U.S. Navy and continued transporting animals {{through the end of the}} war.|$|E
5|$|Cabaniss' {{body was}} ordered to be embalmed but was not; the damage to his body was so severe that the {{embalming}} fluid would leak out. His body was buried in Kobe on February 24 with military honors. The entire crew of the Swatara attended, {{as well as the}} entire crew of HMS Flying Fish and many noted Japanese citizens. Ensign Parker reportedly suffered from depression following the accident. Cabaniss' death received significant media coverage in the Eastern United States. The New York Times published an article on its second page, and among other papers <b>that</b> <b>carried</b> the story were the Wilmington Morning Star and the Petersburg Index-Appeal.|$|E

5|$|During {{the period}} July 2007 to June 2008, the French Herd Book {{comprised}} a main section (section principale in French) divided into the original Pureblood (pur sang) class and a newly created Purebred (race pure) class. The Purebred class {{was added to}} enable the recording of polled Limousins, Limousins <b>that</b> <b>carried</b> a double-muscling gene (muscle hypertrophy abbreviated to MH, or gene culard in French), and Limousins that did not comply fully with the French Breed standard.|$|E
5|$|Film records survive of two Gettysburg reunions, {{held on the}} battlefield. At the 50th anniversary (1913), {{veterans}} re-enacted Pickett's Charge in {{a spirit}} of reconciliation, a meeting <b>that</b> <b>carried</b> great emotional force for both sides. At the 75th anniversary (1938), 2500 veterans attended, and there was a ceremonial mass hand-shake across a stone wall. This was recorded on sound film, and some Confederates can be heard giving the Rebel Yell.|$|E
5|$|Gebhard clearly {{intended}} to transform an important ecclesiastical territory into a secular, dynastic duchy. This problematic conversion would then bring {{the principle of}} cuius regio, eius religio into play in the Electorate. Under this principle, all of Gebhard's subjects {{would be required to}} convert to his faith: his rule, his religion. Furthermore, as a relatively young man, heirs would be expected. Gebhard and his young wife presented the very real possibility of successfully converting a rich, diplomatically important and strategically placed ecclesiastical territory of a prince-prelate into a dynastic territory <b>that</b> <b>carried</b> with it one of the coveted offices of imperial elector.|$|E

David Harriman, who edited the notes for the posthumously published Journals of Ayn Rand (1997), described the story's villain as a preliminary version of the character Ellsworth Toohey, and this villain's assassination by the protagonist as prefiguring the attempted assassination of Toohey.|$|E

5|$|Ironclads were {{designed}} for several roles, including as high seas battleships, coastal defense ships, and long-range cruisers. The rapid development of warship design in the late 19th century transformed the ironclad from a wooden-hulled vessel <b>that</b> <b>carried</b> sails to supplement its steam engines into the steel-built, turreted battleships and cruisers familiar in the 20th century. This change was pushed forward {{by the development of}} heavier naval guns (the ironclads of the 1880s carried some of the heaviest guns ever mounted at sea at the time), more sophisticated steam engines, and advances in metallurgy which made steel shipbuilding possible.|$|E
5|$|O'Brien was {{commissioned}} into the United States Navy on 22 May 1915 {{under the command}} of Lieutenant Commander C. E.

In fleet exercises off New York in November, O'Brien collided with the destroyer , in a minor incident <b>that</b> <b>carried</b> away part of Draytons topmast and wireless gear. In December, she was assigned to the 5th Division, Torpedo Flotilla, Atlantic Fleet. From early 1916-spring of 1917, she operated with the Fleet along the East Coast and in Cuban waters.|$|E

The Italians quickly forced the Ottomans to withdraw into the city by evening. After a short siege, the Ottoman forces withdrew on 29 October, leaving {{the city to the}} Italians.|$|E
