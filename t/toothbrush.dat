5|$|Bristle toothbrush: According to a Library of Congress website, the Chinese {{have used}} the bristle <b>toothbrush</b> since 1498, {{during the reign of}} the Hongzhi Emperor (r. 1487–1505) of the Ming Dynasty (1368–1644); it also adds that the <b>toothbrush</b> was not mass-produced until 1780, when they were sold by a William Addis of Clerkenwell, London, England. In {{accordance}} with the Library of Congress website, scholar John Bowman also writes that the bristle <b>toothbrush</b> using pig bristles was invented in China during the 1490s. While Bonnie L. Kendall agrees with this, she noted that a predecessor existed in ancient Egypt {{in the form of a}} twig that was frayed at the end.|$|E
5|$|Li Shizhen (1518–93) – one of {{the most}} renowned pharmacologists and {{physicians}} in Chinese history – belonged to the late Ming period. His Bencao Gangmu is a medical text with 1,892 entries, each entry with its own name called a gang. The mu in the title refers to the synonyms of each name. Inoculation, although it can be traced to earlier Chinese folk medicine, was detailed in Chinese texts by the sixteenth century. Throughout the Ming dynasty, around fifty texts were published on the treatment of smallpox. In regards to oral hygiene, the ancient Egyptians had a primitive <b>toothbrush</b> of a twig frayed at the end, but the Chinese were the first to invent the modern bristle <b>toothbrush</b> in 1498, although it used stiff pig hair.|$|E

5|$|The {{purpose of}} {{cleaning}} teeth {{is to remove}} plaque, which consists mostly of bacteria. Healthcare professionals recommend regular brushing twice a day (in the morning and in the evening, or after meals) {{in order to prevent}} formation of plaque and tartar. A <b>toothbrush</b> is able to remove most plaque, except in areas between teeth. As a result, flossing is also considered a necessity to maintain oral hygiene. When used correctly, dental floss removes plaque from between teeth and at the gum line, where periodontal disease often begins and could develop caries.|$|E

In another scene, she bathes in the lake, {{with the help of}} an elephant who sprays her with water from the lake using its trunk. Katy helps a crocodile by brushing its teeth using a <b>toothbrush</b> she has salvaged, and tries to reach her clothes which have been taken by the elephant. At night, she holds a torch and explores a cave. Inside, she watches an animated drawing on the wall in which humans try to kill a tiger with fire; attempting to burn it as it grows stronger and shooting spears which it sends firing back towards them with its roar. The next morning, Katy emerges from the cave, wearing a leopard-print bikini top, a grass skirt, laced up legs and bare feet, displaying a boost of confidence and holding the spear she made earlier. She stands on top of a waterfall, overlooking the jungle, and then swings across the sky on a vine.|$|E

5|$|Tooth {{destruction}} from processes {{other than}} dental caries {{is considered a}} normal physiologic process but may become severe enough to become a pathologic condition. Attrition {{is the loss of}} tooth structure by mechanical forces from opposing teeth. Attrition initially affects the enamel and, if unchecked, may proceed to the underlying dentin. Abrasion is the loss of tooth structure by mechanical forces from a foreign element. If this force begins at the cementoenamel junction, then progression of tooth loss can be rapid since enamel is very thin in this region of the tooth. A common source of this type of tooth wear is excessive force when using a <b>toothbrush.</b> Erosion is the loss of tooth structure due to chemical dissolution by acids not of bacterial origin. Signs of tooth destruction from erosion is a common characteristic in the mouths of people with bulimia since vomiting results in exposure of the teeth to gastric acids. Another important source of erosive acids are from frequent sucking of lemon juice. Abfraction is the loss of tooth structure from flexural forces. As teeth flex under pressure, the arrangement of teeth touching each other, known as occlusion, causes tension {{on one side of the}} tooth and compression on the other side of the tooth. This is believed to cause V-shaped depressions on the side under tension and C-shaped depressions on the side under compression. When tooth destruction occurs at the roots of teeth, the process is referred to as internal resorption, when caused by cells within the pulp, or external resorption, when caused by cells in the periodontal ligament.|$|E

25|$|Modern <b>toothbrush</b> {{originated}} in China. The first bristle <b>toothbrush</b> resembling the modern one {{was found in}} China. Used during the Tang Dynasty (619–907), it consisted of hog bristles. The bristles were sourced from hogs living in Siberia and northern China because the colder temperatures provided firmer bristles. They were attached to a handle manufactured from bamboo or bone, forming a <b>toothbrush.</b> In 1223, Japanese Zen master Dōgen Kigen recorded on Shōbōgenzō that he saw monks in China clean their teeth with brushes made of horsetail hairs attached to an oxbone handle. The bristle <b>toothbrush</b> spread to Europe, brought from China to Europe by travellers. It was adopted in Europe during the 17th century. The earliest identified {{use of the word}} <b>toothbrush</b> in English was in the autobiography of Anthony Wood who wrote in 1690 that he had bought a <b>toothbrush</b> from J. Barret. Europeans found the hog bristle toothbrushes imported from China too firm and preferred softer bristle toothbrushes made from horsehair. Mass produced toothbrushes made with horse or boar bristle continued to be imported to England from China until the mid 20th century.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{laboratory}} study {{was to assess the}} potential cleaning efficacy of nine different <b>toothbrushes</b> around brackets in vitro. Standard and Mini Diamond brackets were fixed on coloured teeth in a special model, coated with white titanium oxide, brushed in a machine with different manual <b>toothbrushes</b> (three different types: planar, staged, and v-shaped bristle field), and tested with a horizontal motion for 1 minute. After brushing, the teeth were scanned and the black surfaces were planimetrically assessed using a grey scale. Tooth areas which were black again after brushing indicated tooth surface contact of the filaments. The remaining white tooth areas around the brackets indicated 'plaque-retentive' niches. Statistical analysis was carried out using the Kruskal-Wallis one-way test of variance for individual comparison. Bonferroni adjustment was used for multiple testing, and comparison of bracket size with Wilcoxon signed rank test. In the most critical area of 2 mm around the brackets, there was no statistically significant difference between the different <b>toothbrushes</b> evaluated. The untouched area ranged from 11 to 26 per cent of the initially whitened tooth surface. By pooling the <b>toothbrushes</b> according to their design, the median cleaning efficacy of the v-shaped (73. 1 per cent) and staged (75. 6 per cent) <b>toothbrushes</b> resulted in significantly superior cleaning efficacy than planar <b>toothbrushes</b> (60. 7 per cent) for standard brackets. For mini bracket type, staged <b>toothbrushes</b> showed a significantly better mean cleaning efficacy (77. 8 per cent) than planar (65 per cent) and v-shaped (72. 4 per cent) <b>toothbrushes.</b> Staged and v-shaped brush designs resulted in superior cleaning efficacy of teeth with fixed orthodontic attachments than <b>toothbrushes</b> with a planar bristle field.

40|$|Background: <b>Toothbrushing</b> is an {{important}} aspect of children's oral health self-care. This study aimed to explore <b>toothbrushing</b> frequency among 4 – 6 -year-old Iranian children and associated maternal attitude and sociobehavioral factors. Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted on 407 mother–child (aged 4 – 6 years) pairs through stratified random sampling in Tabriz, Iran. Data were collected using self-reported questionnaires including demographic characteristic, maternal attitude, and <b>toothbrushing</b> frequency of both mothers and children. Logistic regression was used to determine the predicators of children's <b>toothbrushing.</b> Statistical significance was set at P < 0. 05 for all tests. Results: The mean ages were 32. 6 ± 4. 8 and 5. 3 ± 1. 1 years for mothers and children respectively. Twice-daily <b>toothbrushing</b> was observed at a relative frequency of 12. 8 % in children and 18. 4 % in mothers. About 43. 7 % of children brushed their teeth once daily. Nearly 38. 7 % of children started <b>toothbrushing</b> behavior regularly at 4 years of age, and 41 % had dental visits. Multiple logistic regression analysis indicated that children's <b>toothbrushing</b> (once daily or more) was associated with maternal brushing frequency (odds ratio [OR] = 2. 0, 95 % confidence interval [CI] = 1. 53 – 2. 86), maternal attitude toward oral health (OR = 1. 15, CI = 1. 08 – 1. 22), and children's age (OR = 1. 21, 95 % CI = 1. 02 – 1. 77).

40|$|Dental caries is {{a disease}} of {{childhood}} social disa dvantage being considered as a marker of family dep rivation and relative poverty. School-based programmes such as, ‘Winning Smiles’ (WS) {{have been used to}} promote <b>toothbrushing</b> with luoride toothpaste in children r esiding in areas of high social deprivation. Withou t a clear understanding of the underlying <b>toothbrushing</b> dynam ic how could WS achieve its deined aim to promote <b>toothbrushing</b> as a self-care practice in children r esiding in areas of greatest deprivation? The need to research the dynamics of childhood <b>toothbrushing</b> remained. T he aim of this qualitative exploration was twofold, irst to explore children’s views of <b>toothbrushing</b> and se condly, to relect, if possible, on the degree to wh ich the children’s views and experiences can aid an underst anding of the power dynamics of <b>toothbrushing</b> pract ices in childhood. In order to achieve these aims it was necessary to use a child-centred approach to glean the thoughts, values and opinions of the participating children. The children who participated were aged b e- tween 8 - 9 -years-old and resided and attended school s in the most deprived parts of Dublin and Belfast. The data analysis was theoretically underpinned by the work of Foucault and Nettleton. The children had a series of <b>toothbrushing</b> rules which were a conglomerate of ‘do’s’ and ‘don’ts’. The rules relected an element of con - lict in the children’s behaviour since they describ ed what the children felt they ‘should’ do (‘toothb rushing rules’), as well as what they ‘actually’ did (‘toot hbrushing practices’). The <b>toothbrushing</b> rules were mainly based on their parental household rules which the c hildren incorporated into their <b>toothbrushing</b> pract ices. It is suggested that children incorporate informati on from parents, school-based programmes and the de ntist into their <b>toothbrushing</b> practices.

40|$|Background and Aim: Although <b>toothbrushing</b> {{is still}} the most {{effective}} method in plaque reduction, it is insufficient for total plaque removal. Considering this limitation, it is suggested that <b>toothbrushing</b> could be aided by chemical methods. For this purpose, it is advised to use some kind of mouthrinses before <b>toothbrushing</b> to increase the rate of microbial plaque removal. Several prebrushing mouthrinses are available in the market and comparing their efficiency is valuable for dentists. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate and compare the effect of two prebrushing mouthrinses, Plax and Irsha, on dental plaque reduction. Materials and Methods: This clinical trial was carried out as an interventional and triple blind protocol, using completely random block design. For this purpose, questionnaire and initial examination chart was filled for 50 healthy volunteers between the age of 18 and 40 years and finally 30 individuals were selected based on the inclusion/exclusion criteria. If scaling and polishing was necessary, it was performed at least 2 weeks before starting the main program. Then, each volunteer participated in a 4 steps program, including one step <b>toothbrushing</b> without use of mouthrinse and three steps <b>toothbrushing</b> after use of one of the mouthrinses (Plax, Irsha, Placebo). Data were analyzed by SPSS software using factorial analysis, ANOVA and Tukey’s multiple comparison tests with p< 0. 05 as the limit of significance. Results: <b>Toothbrushing</b> without use of mouthrinse decreased the amount of plaque, significantly (P< 0. 0001). Use of mouthrinse without <b>toothbrushing</b> decreased the amount of plaque significantly (P< 0. 0001). The amount of plaque reduction after use of various mouthrinses (Plax, Irsha, Placebo) showed no statistical differences (P= 0. 761).
