5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Doughnut</b> {{has twice}} been visited by Charles, Prince of Wales, since its opening. Charles was {{accompanied}} by Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall in 2011, on his second visit to <b>the</b> <b>Doughnut.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Doughnut</b> is {{surrounded}} by car and bicycle parking in concentric rings, guarded by a two-metre metal fence {{and half a dozen}} vehicle checkpoints. <b>The</b> <b>Doughnut</b> is served by an underground road.|$|E
5|$|At {{a cost of}} £330m, the {{construction}} of <b>the</b> <b>Doughnut</b> was funded by a private finance initiative (PFI) put forward by a collective that included British facilities management and construction company Carillion, the Danish security company Group 4/Falck (now G4S), and the British telecommunications company BT Group. The consortium {{are scheduled to be}} paid £800m to maintain <b>the</b> <b>Doughnut</b> for 30 years. The creation of <b>the</b> <b>Doughnut</b> was the largest PFI project to date for the British government. The building was designed by the British architect Chris Johnson for the American architectural firm Gensler, and constructed and built by Carillion.|$|E

2500|$|After {{he commented}} that <b>the</b> <b>doughnuts</b> were growing stale, Maud indifferently responded {{that because he}} had {{purchased}} them, he was obligated to finish them. [...] Frank, unwilling to eat <b>the</b> moldy <b>doughnuts,</b> buried <b>the</b> rest in the backyard. However, Maud, peering through the window, noticed his actions and immediately scooped them out. [...] "Dust off" [...] them, she gave one to Frank. [...] Annoyed, Frank told her he no longer wanted to eat <b>the</b> <b>doughnuts</b> because they were [...] "not fit to eat and you know it". [...] Maud rejoined that {{because he did not}} confer with her prior to buying <b>the</b> <b>doughnuts,</b> he had to eat them. [...] However, she told him, [...] "I'll let you off this time if you promise never again to buy any food unless I ask you to get it." [...] Frank consented, and the incident [...] "taught him a lesson he never forgot: that ... around the house she was the boss".|$|R
500|$|<b>The</b> old-fashioned <b>doughnut</b> {{is a type}} of cake doughnut, and {{has been}} {{described}} as a [...] "subset" [...] of <b>the</b> cake <b>doughnut.</b> <b>The</b> cake <b>doughnut</b> itself originated in the United States circa 1829, when the increased availability of pearlash in the U.S., a type of leavener that preceded baking powder, lent to the increase of cake doughnut consumption. It is unclear when <b>the</b> old-fashioned <b>doughnut</b> itself was invented, but this very likely occurred after <b>the</b> cake <b>doughnut</b> was invented. Prior to circa 1829, <b>doughnuts</b> were typically <b>the</b> yeast-risen variety in the U.S. Circa the 1830s, the leaveners baking soda and baking powder began to be available to U.S. consumers, which is around the same time that cake doughnut recipes first appeared in U.S. cookbooks.|$|R

5|$|In October 2014 1,308 GCHQ staff {{formed a}} giant red poppy in the Doughnut's central {{courtyard}} {{to mark the}} start of the Royal British Legion's Poppy Appeal. The poppy was 38m in size with a 28m long stalk. The staff wore red rain ponchos, with the black centre of the poppy formed by the uniforms of Royal Navy personnel. <b>The</b> <b>Doughnut</b> was illuminated with yellow light to mark GCHQ staff's support for Guide Dogs and by a spectrum of colours to mark the International Day Against Homophobia, Transphobia and Biphobia. An annual Community Day is held at <b>the</b> <b>Doughnut</b> to highlight the charitable and volunteer work by GCHQ staff in the local Cheltenham community.|$|E

Some locations sell coffee {{but mostly it}} focuses on donuts including as pasalubong, gifts by visitors to friends and family. <b>The</b> <b>doughnuts</b> sold are adjusted to the local market with smaller and therefore cheaper sizes and different flavors.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Doughnut</b> {{was already}} {{too small for the}} number of GCHQ staff at its completion, as a vast {{expansion}} in the number of employees had occurred {{as a consequence of the}} September 11 attacks in 2001. The staff numbered almost 6,500 by 2008. The addition of a two-storey office block and a three-storey car park to <b>the</b> <b>Doughnut</b> was proposed in 2008, but eventually suspended in 2011. The new buildings were intended to facilitate the arrival of 800 staff from GCHQ's former site at Oakley. Though it was initially felt that <b>the</b> <b>Doughnut</b> would be adequate for the new staff, 600 contractors working on technical projects for GCHQ were eventually relocated in a secret undisclosed building in the 'Gloucestershire area'. The parking of cars by GCHQ staff on residential roads has caused 'annoyance' among local residents in Benhall. It was believed that the arrival of new staff may have further affected local parking but GCHQ stated the presence of the new employees would have been offset by redundancies.|$|E
5|$|For {{security}} reasons, GCHQ {{moved its}} own computers and technical infrastructure to <b>the</b> <b>Doughnut,</b> which caused {{the cost of}} its move to increase from £41m to £450m over two years. The moves of MI5 and the SIS to new buildings had also cost {{more than three times}} their original estimates due to issues with transferring computers. HM Treasury paid £216m toward a newly agreed budget of £308m, having initially refused to finance the original high figure. The final cost of GCHQ's move to their new headquarters was more than seven times the original estimate.|$|E
5|$|It may be {{prepared}} with toppings such as sugar, chocolate or maple glazes, dusted with granulated sugar or cinnamon-sugar, or served plain without any topping. The shape of <b>the</b> <b>doughnut</b> can lend to {{the retention of}} a greater amount of glaze or other toppings compared to other doughnut styles. The old-fashioned doughnut may have a similar texture {{to that of a}} buttermilk doughnut, may be crisp in texture, and typically has cracks and pores on its surface.|$|E
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study was to compare the frying life of lards and other fats when used under {{household}} conditions. Doughnuts and potato chips were cooked in the fats. Certain chemical and physical constants of the fats were determined before and after cooking to find the extent of change during their use. In addition, the amount of fat absorbed by <b>the</b> <b>doughnuts</b> was recorded and an effort made to determine whether the degree of absorption was correlated with the chemical and physical characteristics of these fats, and if so, with which of these characteristics. In another unit of <b>the</b> study <b>doughnuts</b> were cooked at three temperatures, and the extent of the chemical and physical changes in the fats, due to the temperatures employed, was determined. <b>The</b> <b>doughnuts</b> cooked at these three temperatures were also scored for palatability...|$|R

5|$|Primary {{ingredients}} in an old-fashioned doughnut include flour, sugar, eggs, sour cream or buttermilk, and leavening agents such as baking powder or baking soda. Additional ingredients may include milk, butter, vanilla extract and salt. The use of buttermilk or sour cream may impart a rich flavor to <b>the</b> <b>doughnut.</b> It is typically deep-fried, {{and may be}} deep fried at a lower temperature compared to other doughnut styles, having a crunchier texture compared to other cake doughnut styles. Frying at a lower temperature contributes to its rough, cracked texture. Being turned several times while cooking in the oil also contributes to its texture.|$|E
25|$|A {{function}} or map {{from one}} topological space to another is called continuous if the inverse image of any open set is open. If the function maps the real numbers {{to the real}} numbers (both spaces with the Standard Topology), then this definition of continuous {{is equivalent to the}} definition of continuous in calculus. If a continuous function is one-to-one and onto, and if the inverse of the function is also continuous, then the function is called a homeomorphism and the domain of the function is said to be homeomorphic to the range. Another way of saying this is that the function has a natural extension to the topology. If two spaces are homeomorphic, they have identical topological properties, and are considered topologically the same. The cube and the sphere are homeomorphic, as are the coffee cup and <b>the</b> <b>doughnut.</b> But the circle is not homeomorphic to <b>the</b> <b>doughnut.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1933, eighteen-year-old Vernon Rudolph {{began working}} for his uncle, Ishmael Armstrong, {{who owned a}} small general store in Paducah, Kentucky that sold {{a wide variety of}} goods, {{including}} its very popular doughnuts. While the exact origin of <b>the</b> <b>doughnut</b> recipe remains partially a mystery, it is believed that Ishmael Armstrong was inspired by an Ohio River barge cook named Joseph LeBeouf who was famous for his light and fluffy doughnuts.|$|E

25|$|His skating {{techniques}} {{include the}} Biellmann spin and <b>the</b> <b>doughnut</b> spin. Both {{are known for}} their difficulty, for male skaters especially, due to the flexibility required. Other signature moves include the layback Ina Bauer, hydroblading and side lunge. His jumps are praised for their precision, flow and extraordinary ice coverage. Hanyu is known for his difficult triple Axel entries, usually from a back counter or spread eagle. He stated his preference for edge jumps, and notably featured all three edge jumps in his short program for the 2016-17 season.|$|E
25|$|Baffle Design: baffles {{are used}} in shell and tube heat {{exchangers}} to direct fluid across the tube bundle. They run perpendicularly to the shell and hold the bundle, preventing the tubes from sagging over a long length. They can also prevent the tubes from vibrating. The {{most common type of}} baffle is the segmental baffle. The semicircular segmental baffles are oriented at 180 degrees to the adjacent baffles forcing the fluid to flow upward and downwards between the tube bundle. Baffle spacing is of large thermodynamic concern when designing shell and tube heat exchangers. Baffles must be spaced with consideration for the conversion of pressure drop and heat transfer. For thermo economic optimization it is suggested that the baffles be spaced no closer than 20% of the shell’s inner diameter. Having baffles spaced too closely causes a greater pressure drop because of flow redirection. Consequently, having the baffles spaced too far apart means that there may be cooler spots in the corners between baffles. It is also important to ensure the baffles are spaced close enough that the tubes do not sag. The other main type of baffle is the disc and doughnut baffle, which consists of two concentric baffles. An outer, wider baffle looks like a doughnut, whilst the inner baffle is shaped like a disk. This type of baffle forces the fluid to pass around each side of the disk then through <b>the</b> <b>doughnut</b> baffle generating a different type of fluid flow.|$|E

50|$|The donut {{business}} {{was started in}} 1969 by Merieta Altrichter as Grand Marais Donuts. Altrichter was also working a minimum wage day job paying $2/hour and made <b>the</b> <b>doughnuts</b> by hand {{as a way of}} supplementing her income. She would rise early in the morning, make <b>the</b> <b>doughnuts</b> and leave a friend to sell them as she went to her job at a department store during the day. In the beginning, the shop was called Grand Marais Donuts and was based out of a small building that is now a part of the Dockside Fish Market. The business began to grow and was relocated to Joynes' Bargain Barn. In 1975 Altrichter was able to quit her day job and started working full-time making and selling <b>doughnuts</b> in <b>the</b> summer.|$|R
