5|$|One {{member of}} the Commission, the chief {{accountant}} of the Ministry of Finance, A. van Gijn, objected to the report's conclusions. He provided a note to Queen Wilhelmina, which argued that advocates of building large warships had forced {{their views on the}} other members of the commission. Moreover, he believed that the proposed fleet would be inadequate given the rapid naval expansion being undertaken by the major powers, and <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> adopted there would be a requirement to buy further dreadnoughts in order to keep pace. This note was included as an appendix to the Commission's report.|$|E
5|$|With Jacksonville's {{future as}} host in doubt, representatives from Charlotte, North Carolina, Tampa, Florida, and Jacksonville visited the ACC offices to lobby {{to host the}} 2008 game. Orlando, Florida, which had been an early {{contender}} to host the 2008 game, was eliminated from consideration before the meetings took place. As kickoff drew closer, the Gator Bowl Association expressed displeasure with the poor ticket sales, saying that nearly 20,000tickets remained unsold as of {{the week of the}} game and <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> not a sellout, the game would likely not remain in Jacksonville.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} Rosenborg had {{qualified}} for the 1995–96 UEFA Champions League, UEFA had for security reasons introduced restrictions which reduced Lerkendal's capacity to 12,200 spectators. In addition, a total ban on standing places would be introduced from 1997. In 1995, a debate arose between Rosenborg and Trondheim Municipality regarding {{the construction of a}} new grandstand, to be located on the north side of the stadium. Rosenborg's Nils Skutle stated <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> not built ahead of the 1997–98 season, Rosenborg would only be allowed to sell 2,800 tickets to their home Champions League matches, and that they instead would be forced to play their games at Ullevaal Stadion in Oslo. The new grandstand cost 32 million, and opened in 1996 season. The upgrades also included a new floodlight and public announcement system.|$|E

5|$|In 2000, Ullevaal Stadion AS {{bought the}} West Stand, {{including}} the commercial areas. In March 2001, NFF gave Lyn a loan for NOK12.5 million, {{on the condition}} <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> not paid back within two years, NFF would take over Lyn's ownership in the stadium. This {{made it possible for}} Lyn to pay their investment company back the debt for the loan, which had increased to this amount in five years, and to purchase the stadium and secure NFF the right of pre-emption. On 4 July 2002, Lyn and NFF announced that NFF would make a private placement of NOK27 million in Ullevaal Stadion AS {{and at the same time}} terminate Lyn's debt. In exchange, Lyn's ownership was reduced to 15%.|$|E
5|$|Jun Maeda, {{the main}} {{scenario}} writer of Air, commented {{that in the}} early stages of Air production, it was already decided that it was to be an adult game, and he further assumes <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> not at least first released with adult content, that it would not have been as commercially successful. Maeda also commented that he wanted to write Air to give players the chance to experience the entire story as a whole rather than just a sum of differing parts as typical bishōjo games do, including Kanon. While attempting to do this, Maeda also tried to simultaneously make it seem similar to typical visual novels in the same genre as Air to give the game appeal to the players who often play such games. As such, while the game incorporates stories from several characters, they are all of varying lengths.|$|E
5|$|During {{the night}} of May19 there were further discussions at Rodríguez Peña's house. Saavedra, called by Viamonte, joined the meeting, which {{involved}} military and civilian leaders. They arranged that Belgrano and Saavedra would meet with Juan José de Lezica, the senior alcalde (municipal magistrate), while Castelli would meet with the procurator Julián de Leiva, to ask for their support. They asked the Viceroy to allow an open cabildo, and said <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> not freely granted {{the people and the}} criollo troops would march to the Plaza, force the Viceroy to resign by any means necessary, and replace him with a patriot government. Saavedra commented to Lezica that he was suspected of betrayal because of his constant requests for cautious and measured steps. This comment was designed to pressure Lezica into speeding up the legal system to allow the people to express themselves, or otherwise risk a major rebellion. Lezica asked for patience and time to persuade the Viceroy, and leave a massive demonstration as a last resort. He argued that if the Viceroy was deposed in that way, it would constitute a rebellion, which would turn the revolutionaries into outlaws. Manuel Belgrano gave the following Monday as the deadline to confirm the open cabildo before taking direct action. Leiva would later act as a mediator, being both a confidante of Cisneros and a trusted negotiator for the more moderate revolutionaries.|$|E

5|$|With {{both sides}} {{exhausted}} from the fighting {{the night of}} 5/6 October was less eventful than expected, and the Australians used {{the opportunity to develop}} their position. To add further depth to their defences and to probe the Chinese positions, Taylor ordered the Australians to capture the central remaining Chinese position, the Sierra feature—a wooded knoll halfway between the summit of Maryang San and the Hinge—the next day. Meanwhile, the Fusiliers would renew their attack on Hill 217. The southern approach to Hill 217 had proved to be too strongly defended by the Chinese and it became obvious <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> to be overcome Taylor would need to split the fire of its defenders. To do this the high ground to the north-west of Maryang San, known as the Hinge, would be vital. Indeed, adjacent to Hill 217, the Hinge dominated it from the north. As such for the next assault, planned for the morning, the Fusiliers would detach their reserve company to attack the Hinge from the east, using the Australian positions on Maryang San as a firm base and thereby allowing them to outflank their opponents on Hill 217.|$|E

25|$|The Russian Navy {{was later}} criticised as misrepresenting facts and {{misleading}} the public. The navy feared <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{revealed that the}} submarine blew up because of crew incompetence, Russia's status as a great power would be in doubt. Their response was compared to the Soviet style of cover up and stonewalling like that during the Chernobyl disaster.

25|$|In 1828, in {{the midst}} of an {{economic}} recession, the British government withdrew funding for the botanical garden, and Drummond found himself unemployed with six children to support. Shortly afterwards, he was offered an appointment as Government Naturalist to the soon-to-be-established Swan River Colony (Australia). This position was honorary, but Drummond was given to understand <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> decided to establish a public garden in the colony, he could expect to be given a salaried appointment as Superintendent of Government Gardens.|$|E
25|$|Some rabbis of the Middle Ages {{argued that}} after eating solid dairy {{products}} such as cheese, the hands should be washed. Shabbatai ben Meir even argues that this is necessary if utensils such as forks were used and the cheese never touched by hands. Other rabbis of that time, like Joseph Caro, thought <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> possible to visually verify that hands were clean, then they need not be washed; Tzvi Hirsch Spira argued that washing the hands should also be practiced for milk.|$|E

Margarita did claim {{that she and her}} family had searched for her daughter but were unable to locate her, for which she became the subject of much criticism and anger when Anjelica was identified in 2013. Other reports reveal that her family also neglected to report her missing, as some of the family members, including Margarita, were apparently illegal immigrants. They feared <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> discovered that some were in the country illegally during the course of an investigation, they would be deported.|$|E

But he also concedes she {{will not be able to}} keep working for long as she will soon succumb to her cancer.

25|$|Some of {{the works}} which bear the names of Bakhtin's close friends V. N. Vološinov and P. N. Medvedev have been {{attributed}} to Bakhtin – particularly Marxism and Philosophy of Language and The Formal Method in Literary Scholarship. These claims originated in the early 1970s and received their earliest full articulation in English in Clark and Holquist's 1984 biography of Bakhtin. In the years since then, however, most scholars have come to agree that Vološinov and Medvedev ought to be considered the true authors of these works. Although Bakhtin undoubtedly influenced these scholars and may even have had a hand in composing the works attributed to them, it now seems clear <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> necessary to attribute authorship of these works to one person, Vološinov and Medvedev respectively should receive credit.|$|E
25|$|Samuel {{taught that}} the {{interpretation}} that Aaron {{should not have}} eaten the offering agreed with Rabbi Nehemiah while the other interpretation that Aaron should have eaten the offering agreed with Rabbi Judah and Rabbi Simeon. Rabbi Nehemiah argued that they burned the offering because the priests were in the first stages of mourning. Rabbi Judah and Rabbi Simeon maintained that they burned it because the offering had become defiled during the day, not because of bereavement. Rabbi Judah and Rabbi Simeon argued <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> because of bereavement, they should have burned all three sin offerings brought that day. Alternatively, Rabbi Judah and Rabbi Simeon argued that the priest would have been fit to eat the sacrifices after sunset. Alternatively, Rabbi Judah and Rabbi Simeon argued that Phinehas was then alive and not restricted by the law of mourning.|$|E

25|$|In June 1699 Kidd {{was stopped}} on the island while sailing to Boston to try to clear his name. With the {{permission}} of the proprietor, Mrs. Gardiner, he buried $30,000 in treasure in a ravine between Bostwick's Point and the Manor House. For her troubles he gave her a piece of gold cloth (a piece of which is now at the East Hampton library) that was captured from a Moorish ship off Madagascar, as well as a bag of sugar. Kidd warned <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> not there when he returned he would kill Gardiner. Kidd was tried in Boston and Gardiner was ordered to deliver the treasure as evidence. The booty included gold dust, bars of silver, Spanish dollars, rubies, diamonds, candlesticks and porringers. Gardiner kept one of the diamonds, which he gave his daughter. A plaque on the island marks the spot, but it's on private property.|$|E
