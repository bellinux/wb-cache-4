From the maximum slope lines, obtained using {{the principles of}} minimum distance and orthogonality, the models obtains a stream tubes structure. The implemented model automatically can find the terrain morphological characteristics, e. g. peaks and saddles, and deal with them respecting the stream flow. Using this type of discretization, the model divides the elements in which the water flows in two classes; the cells, that are mixtilinear polygons where the overland flow is modelled as a sheet flow and channels, obtained by the interception {{of two or more}} stream tubes and whenever surface runoff occurs, the surface runoff is channelised. The permanent drainage paths can are calculated using {{one of the most common}} methods: <b>threshold</b> <b>area,</b> variable <b>threshold</b> <b>area</b> or curvature.

The model considers three type of overland flow, depending on how it is produced:infiltration excess;saturation of superficial layer of the soil and exfiltration of sub-surface flow from upstream. The surface flow and the subsurface flow across a element are routed according with the mono-dimensional equation of the kinematic wave. The also model considers the spatial variability of the channels geometry with the flow.

40|$|Abstract: Approximately 90 - 95 % of soil eroded on a hillslope is redeposited {{and does}} not enter a stream. However, {{sediment}} transport models such as SedNet require an estimate {{to be made of}} the actual delivery of sediment from a hillslope into a stream based on predictions of hillslope erosion. In a companion paper in this volume (Post et al. 2006) we have developed a spatially explicit hillslope delivery model based on travel time and applied it to erosion estimates (based on the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation, RUSLE) for a small subcatchment of the Burdekin River, Weany Creek (13. 5 km 2), at 5 m grid size. In this paper we look at the effect of increasing grid spacing on the HSDR model’s predictive capability at Weany Creek. We suggest that the model is only valid in the range of grid sizes up 2500 m 2 (50 m grid size). For grid sizes between 50 - 100 m (which equate to and 1 channel <b>threshold</b> <b>area),</b> the model is unstable and should not be applied. For grid sizes beyond 100 m, the model is not applicable and a constant HSDR may be a suitable approximation. Our calibration term for HSDR, β, shows a strong dependency on grid size as it must compensate for the reduction in predicted erosion from the RUSLE with increasing grid size. The term γ, defining the decay rate of HSDR with hillslope travel time, appears to be grid size independent. The choice of channel <b>threshold</b> <b>area</b> is of critical importance in defining the spatial nature of HSDR and places very strong constraints on the range of grid sizes to which the model may be applied...|$|E

40|$|A counter braid (CB) {{is a novel}} counter {{architecture}} {{introduced by}} Lu et al. in 2007 for per-flow measurements on high-speed links. CBs achieve an asymptotic compression rate (under optimal decoding) that matches the entropy lower bound of the flow size distribution. In this paper, we apply the concept of spatial coupling to CBs to improve their belief propagation (BP) threshold, and analyze {{the performance of the}} resulting spatially-coupled CBs (SC-CBs). We introduce an equivalent bipartite graph representation of CBs with identical iteration-by-iteration finite-length and asymptotic performance. Based on this equivalent representation, we then analyze the asymptotic performance of single-layer CBs and SC-CBs. In particular, we show that the potential <b>threshold</b> and the <b>area</b> <b>threshold</b> are equal. We also derive the Maxwell decoder for CBs and prove that the <b>area</b> <b>threshold</b> is an upper bound on the Maxwell decoding threshold, which, in turn, is a lower bound on the maximum a posteriori (MAP) decoding threshold. We then show that the area under the extended BP extrinsic information transfer curve (defined for the equivalent graph), computed for the expected residual CB graph when a peeling decoder equivalent to the BP decoder stops, is equal to zero precisely at the <b>area</b> <b>threshold.</b> This, combined with the analysis of the Maxwell decoder and simulation results, leads us to the conjecture that the <b>area</b> <b>threshold</b> is in fact equal to the Maxwell decoding threshold and hence a lower bound on the MAP decoding threshold. Interestingly, SC-CBs do not show the well-known phenomenon of threshold saturation of the BP decoding threshold to the MAP decoding threshold characteristic of spatially-coupled low-density parity-check codes and other coupled systems. However, SC-CBs yield better BP decoding thresholds than their uncoupled counterparts. Comment: Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Information Theory.

30|$|The {{integrated}} zoning (Fig.  10) {{indicates that}} the best area for expansion of conjunctive use would be the western fans (except for the northern regions of these fans). Moreover, the integrated maps show other areas with good overall attributes across the aquifer; many {{of them on the}} floodplain. The borders of the northern half of the aquifer show the worst overall potential, which may be partly because the aquifer has a high hydraulic gradient. Thus, the gradient draws water away from these areas, and the thinner aquifer thickness (Fig.  3) means that this part of the aquifer is more easily exhausted. However, the high hydraulic gradient of these borders also indicates propitious conditions for recharge in conjunctive use schemes if they are articulated with retention ponds and controlled canals.

To prevent {{the use of a}} one-dimensional size signal we used textures in which dots were scattered within irregular polygonal <b>areas.</b> Numerosity <b>thresholds</b> were similar in the area and density-varying conditions, consistent with a single numerosity mechanism. <b>Thresholds</b> for <b>area</b> and density discriminations were raised when number was held constant, consistent with numerosity thresholds being lower than those for size and density. Also, <b>area</b> <b>thresholds</b> for polygonal outlines were increased when no dots were present in the outline. However, a single numerosity mechanism cannot account for all the data, because we find that observers in randomly-interleaved size-varying and density-varying conditions are also able to discriminate between changes in size and density with a precision predicted from independently-noisy size and density channels that have similar noise to that in the putative numerosity channel. A complication, previously noted with circular shapes, is that denser textures tend to be confused with larger textures, and vice versa. This could explain why thresholds rise when density and size changes are in opposition, in the constant-number case. These findings taken together do not rule out an independent numerosity mechanism, but they are equally compatible with a flexible computation of numerosity from size and density cues...|$|R
