Rorschach's concerns appear vindicated when Adrian Veidt narrowly survives an assassination attempt, and Rorschach himself is framed for murdering Moloch, a former supervillain, and imprisoned.|$|E

The team included people involved in the original Dungeon Keeper, including Richard Ridings and programmer Alex Peters. Electronic Arts wanted <b>to</b> <b>capitalize</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> original game's success. Producer Nick Goldsworthy believed the key to success was carrying over aspects of the original game and adding new things. A project manager from Mitsubishi assisted the team in management of attaining milestones, and according to Goldsworthy, this taught the team a lot about the practices employed by major companies regarding game development.|$|E

5|$|The French {{followed}} after Kutuzov, {{but soon}} {{found themselves in}} a difficult position.

5|$|The stated {{reason for}} the move was a {{campaign}} promise of Kiribati President Teburoro Tito to eliminate the confusion of Kiribati straddling the Date Line and therefore being constantly in two different days.

A short run after the penalty gained a first down, but on the first play after the first down, the Seminoles fumbled the ball.

50|$|The very {{lives of}} the three Brontë sisters did not attract Hollywood's same level of interest, even though {{a great number of}} biographies and semi-fictional books based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> lives has been published.The only Hollywood {{production}} made about the Brontës was Devotion, a film directed by Curtis Bernhardt in 1946 that had tried <b>to</b> <b>capitalized</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> success of Jane Eyre two years earlier. Starring Ida Lupino as Emily, Olivia de Havilland as Charlotte, Nancy Coleman as Anne and Arthur Kennedy as Branwell, Devotion made no effort in authenticity. It portrays Emily in love with revered Nichols who is in love with Charlotte. The film, made as potboiler romance, had no resemblance to the actual {{lives of the}} Brontë sisters and was decried by Brontë enthusiast for its blatant inaccuracies.|$|R
50|$|Part of the CanNor {{organization}} {{is to create}} stable jobs in the three Territories, {{an area that is}} struggling with unemployment. In relation <b>to</b> <b>capitalizing</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> available resources in the north, CanNor hopes to use the economic expansion and growth in infrastructure to instigate training and education towards job growth for Canadians. Since the majority of citizens living in the Territories are primarily First Nations and Inuit, this project is to foster job growth for these remote communities. Since the project is {{in the early stages of}} development, it is not possible to state how many projected jobs that CanNor will create. The projected budgetary spending of this initiative from 2017 to 2018 is to be $25,109,964, and it is funded by the government with a goal of creating a new economy to support the prospering of Canadian citizens in the far-North.|$|R

Russia's aim was to gain control of Smolensk, which it had ceded to the Commonwealth in 1618 at the Truce of Deulino, ending the last Russo-Polish War. Smolensk was the capital of the Commonwealth's Smoleńsk Voivodeship, but it had often been contested, and it changed hands many times during the 15th, 16th and 17th centuries (from the days of the Muscovite-Lithuanian Wars).|$|E
5|$|Perón's second Five-Year Plan in 1952 favoured {{increased}} agricultural output over industrialization, but {{industrial growth}} and high wages {{in previous years}} had expanded the domestic demand for agrarian goods. During the 1950s, output of beef and grain fell, and the economy suffered. The policy shift toward agricultural production created a gap in income distribution, as {{the majority of those}} who worked in agriculture laboured on tiny plots, while the majority of the land was in large estates. Argentina signed trade agreements with Britain, the Soviet Union and Chile, slightly opening the market to international trade as Perón's second economic plan sought <b>to</b> <b>capitalize</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> country's comparative advantage in agriculture.|$|E
5|$|Tech {{played well}} also, {{especially}} on defense {{where they were}} able to create four turnovers including Thompson's first interception in 99pass attempts.

Texas Tech was able <b>to</b> <b>capitalize</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> other take-aways as well, turning them into 14more points and held the lead until the fourth quarter. Two missed field goals and a fired-up Sooner defense held the Red Raiders off, however, and the Sooners were able to put the game away with a two-yard touchdown run by Brown.|$|E

50|$|Bass {{first began}} formulating his {{subprime}} strategy after {{he met with}} an investment banker from New York while attending a wedding in Spain where they discussed {{how and why the}} Subprime Mezzanine CDO business existed. After returning to the US, Bass hired several private investigators to determine the ease of obtaining a mortgage. Bass spent a significant amount of time studying the residential mortgage market and performed research to identify which residential mortgage backed securities (RMBS) composed of low-quality mortgages were most likely to default. This investment thesis was expressed by purchasing credit default swaps against the securitizations he deemed to be most unstable, which essentially was a manner of shorting the bonds using synthetic instruments. After purchasing the positions for his flagship fund in 2006, Bass raised additional capital for a special fund dedicated exclusively <b>to</b> <b>capitalizing</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> opportunity that existed in the market place. Bass managed or advised over $4 billion of positions in subprime RMBS.|$|R
