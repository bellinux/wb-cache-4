40|$|Proefskrif (ThD) [...] PU vir CHO, 1994 Although New Testament {{scholars}} generally {{acknowledge that}} "knowing" and "knowledge" play and {{important role in}} 2 Peter, little research has to date been done about the motif of knowing in 2 Peter. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine what the nature of the motif of knowing in 2 Peter is and what place it takes in his theology. The method that is used is exegetical, and this is done in accordance with the grammatico-historical model within the reformational tradition. The emphasis is especially on the special canonics (Introduction) of the epistle, the analysis of the thought structure, and the definition of the meanings for which words are used. In the analysis of the thought structure the method developed by Coetzee (1988 : 19 - 37) is followed to a large extent. The definition of meanings is done mainly in accordance with the method of componential analysis as proposed by Louw and Nida (1972 : 84 - 87; 1988 i:vi-xx). The motif of knowing occurs in 2 Peter as a clearly repeated and meaningful semantic unit. Although this is not always done in the same way, the motif has a central place in practically every thought unit in the epistle. In the introduction of the letter (1 : 1 - 2) the motif of knowing is found in the truths of faith which the readers have accepted, as well as deep knowledge of God and Jesus Christ. In 1 : 3 - 11 Peter proposes a summary of his doctrine to his readers, encouraging them to apply these truths with insight and understanding. The ability to understand especially consists in comprehending the implications of a covenantal relationship with God. In the purpose of the letter (1 : 12 - 15; 3 : 1 - 2) the motif of knowing has a central place. Peter writes the epistle so that his readers will be able, after his death, to evoke from memory the knowledge (of his doctrine) of which they already dispose. The doctrine consists of information made known to them by the apostles about the powerful coming of Christ. The information is based in God's revelation in the glorification of Christ and in the Old Testament prophecies (1 : 16 - 21). In 2 : 1 - 3 : 13, where Peter deals with the false teachers and the mockers, the motif of knowing still plays an important role. In chapter 2 he warns that false teachers will come who, as a result of a lack of insight will propagate licentiousness. He offers the consolation, however, that the Lord remembers to judge false teachers and to save. the believers. He also warns them against, in spite of their knowledge of Christ, returning to their old convictions. When the false preachers mockingly question both God's involvement in history and his judgment, the readers should not forget the know ledge which they have received about God's judgment and his time schedule. They should maintain the right perspective on God's grace and in joy wait upon his advent. <b>Through</b> <b>this</b> <b>epistle</b> the apostle equips his readers with the necessary knowledge to keep them strong against the inevitable onslaughts of the false teachers.

60|$|Not so, says St. Paul, all <b>through</b> <b>this</b> very <b>Epistle</b> to the Galatians. That is {{not being}} reverent to God. It is {{insulting}} Him. For it is despising the honour which He has given you, {{and trying to get}} another honour of your own invention, by observances, and frames, and feelings of your own. Do not say, 'When we have received the earnest of God's Spirit, by which we can cry, Abba, Father! then we shall become God's children;' for it is just because you are God's children already--just because you have been God's children all along, that God has taught you to call Him Father. The Lord Jesus Christ told men that God was their Father. Not merely to the Apostles, but to poor, ignorant, sinful wretches, publicans and harlots, He spoke of their Father in heaven, who, because He is a perfect Father, sends His sun to shine on the evil and the good, and His rain to fall on the just and on the unjust. The Lord Jesus Christ taught men--all men, not merely saints and Apostles, but all men, when they prayed--to begin, 'Our Father.' He told them that that was {{the manner in which they}} were to pray, and therefore no other way of praying can we expect God to hear. No slavish, terrified, superstitious coaxing and flattering will help you with God. He has told you to call Him your Father; and if you speak to Him in any other way, you insult Him, and trample under foot the riches of His grace.|$|R
