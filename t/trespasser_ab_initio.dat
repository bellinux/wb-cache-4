40|$|ABSTRACT: Previously {{we searched}} for the <b>ab</b> <b>initio</b> global minima of several SixHy {{clusters}} by a genetic algorithm in which we used the AM 1 semiempirical method to facilitate a rapid energy calculation for the many different cluster geometries explored. However, {{we found that the}} AM 1 energy ranking significantly differs from the <b>ab</b> <b>initio</b> energy ranking. To better guarantee locating the <b>ab</b> <b>initio</b> global minimum while retaining the efficiency of the AM 1 method, we present an improved iterative global optimization strategy. The method involves two separate genetic algorithms that are invoked consecutively. One is the cluster genetic algorithm (CGA), mentioned above, to find the semiempirical SixHy cluster global minimum. A second and separate parametrization genetic algorithm (PGA) is used to reparametrize the AM 1 method using some of the <b>ab</b> <b>initio</b> data generated from the CGA to form a training set of different reference clusters but with fixed SixHy stoichiometry. The cluster global optimization search (CGA) and the semiempirical parametrization (PGA) steps are performed iteratively until the semiempirical GA reparametrized AM 1 (GAM 1) calculations give low-energy optimized structures that are consistent with the globally optimized <b>ab</b> <b>initio</b> structure.
