The Netherlands is the second country, after Norway, where plug-in electric cars have topped the monthly ranking of new car sales. The strong increase of plug-in car sles during the last months of 2013 was due {{to the end of the}} total exemption of <b>the</b> <b>registration</b> <b>fee</b> for corporate cars, which is valid for 5 years.

The National Freedom Party (NFP), a breakaway from the IFP led by former IFP chairperson Zanele kaMagwaza-Msibi, was barred from participating in the election after it failed to pay its registration fee to the Independent Electoral Commission. The party had support in areas where the IFP had been strong, and prior to the election governed a number of municipalities in KwaZulu-Natal in coalition with the African National Congress. The NFP was, however, allowed to contest the election in one municipality, Nquthu, where its local branch had paid <b>the</b> <b>registration</b> <b>fee</b> on time.

40|$|The Government of Kenya {{introduced}} {{user fees}} for inpatient and curative outpatient care at its hospitals and health centres in December 1989. Children under {{five years old}} and those judged by the health staff to be indigent were among the groups exempted from fees. In September 1990, outpatient <b>registration</b> <b>fees</b> were removed, but other fees were retained. This paper describes {{the effects of these}} policy changes on the use of health services in Kibwezi division, a poor rural area. It focuses particularly on the impact of the fees on access to care by children and the poor. The assessment is based on attendance data from government health facilities and on a longitudinal household survey of health care utilization, which covered the nine months during which all fees were charged and two months following the removal of <b>the</b> <b>registration</b> <b>fees.</b> Attendance at government fee-charging health facilities for both outpatient and inpatient care was lower during the period when full fees were charged than during the same months of the previous year. Outpatient attendances rose again when <b>the</b> <b>registration</b> <b>fees</b> were lifted. <b>The</b> study households reported lower levels of utilization of public hospitals and health centres when full fees were in force than during the period after <b>the</b> <b>registration</b> <b>fees</b> were lifted. <b>The</b> pattern of utilization by young children, who were exempted from fees, mirrored that {{of the rest of the}} population, suggesting that they were not fully protected from the adverse effects of fees.
