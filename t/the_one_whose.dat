5|$|Poohsticks is a sport first {{mentioned}} in The House at Pooh Corner, a Winnie-the-Pooh book by A. A. Milne. It {{is a simple}} sport which may be played on any bridge over running water; each player drops a stick on the upstream side of a bridge and <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>whose</b> stick first appears on the downstream side is the winner. The annual World Poohsticks Championships have been held at Day's Lock on the River Thames in the UK since 1984.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from the}} {{question}} of who would represent the Earth as a whole, contact could create other international problems, such as the degree of involvement of governments foreign to <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>whose</b> radio astronomers received the signal. The United Nations discussed various issues of foreign relations immediately before the launch of the Voyager probes, which in 2012 left the Solar System carrying a golden record in case they are found by extraterrestrial intelligence. Among the issues discussed were what messages would best represent humanity, what format they should take, how to convey the cultural history of the Earth, and what international groups should be formed to study extraterrestrial intelligence in greater detail.|$|E
5|$|The active {{components}} of an RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) are endonucleases called argonaute proteins, which cleave the target mRNA strand complementary to their bound siRNA. As the fragments produced by dicer are double-stranded, they could each in theory produce a functional siRNA. However, {{only one of}} the two strands, which is known as the guide strand, binds the argonaute protein and directs gene silencing. The other anti-guide strand or passenger strand is degraded during RISC activation. Although it was first believed that an ATP-dependent helicase separated these two strands, the process proved to be ATP-independent and performed directly by the protein components of RISC. However, an in vitro kinetic analysis of RNAi in the presence and absence of ATP showed that ATP may be required to unwind and remove the cleaved mRNA strand from the RISC complex after catalysis. The guide strand tends to be <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>whose</b> 5' end is less stably paired to its complement, but strand selection is unaffected by the direction in which dicer cleaves the dsRNA before RISC incorporation. Instead, the R2D2 protein may serve as the differentiating factor by binding the more-stable 5' end of the passenger strand.|$|E

25|$|The {{producer}} initially sought actor Richard Griffiths {{to succeed}} Baker, {{but when he}} proved unavailable, cast Peter Davison, {{with whom he had}} previously worked on the popular drama series All Creatures Great and Small. Davison was very different from his four predecessors, being much younger, in line with Nathan-Turner's desire for the Fifth Doctor to be completely unlike the popular Fourth, so that the public would not draw unfavourable comparisons between the two. Davison's Doctor was arguably the most human of them all, and <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>whose</b> vulnerability was emphasised the most. The Fifth Doctor, more often than not, reacted to circumstances around him rather than being proactive, and had the air of a young aristocrat about him, in contrast to Baker's bohemian personality.|$|E

25|$|Bahá'u'lláh met {{briefly with}} a couple of the radical Babi leaders and learned of an {{assassination}} plan. He condemned the plan, but was soon asked to leave Tehran by the authorities. In the vacuum of leadership on August 15, 1852 about 3 Babis attempted the assassination of the Shah and failed. Notwithstanding the assassins' claim that they were working alone, the entire Bábí community was blamed, and a slaughter of several thousand Bábís followed. Amidst the general violence some Bábís were imprisoned in the Síyáh-Chál (Black Pit), an underground dungeon of Tehran. According to Bahá'u'lláh, perhaps the lone survivor, it was during his imprisonment in the Síyáh-Chál that he had several mystical experiences, and that he received a vision of a Maiden from God, through whom he received his mission as a Messenger of God and as <b>the</b> <b>One</b> <b>whose</b> coming the Báb had prophesied.|$|E
25|$|In 1998, Carl Woese {{proposed}} (1) that {{no individual}} organism {{can be considered}} a LUCA, and (2) that the genetic heritage of all modern organisms derived through horizontal gene transfer among an ancient community of organisms. While the results described by the later papers Theobald (2010) and Saey (2010) demonstrate the existence of a single LUCA, the argument in Woese (1998) can still be applied to Ur-organisms. At the beginnings of life, ancestry was not as linear as it is today because the genetic code took time to evolve. Before high fidelity replication, organisms could not be easily mapped on a phylogenetic tree. Not {{to be confused with the}} Ur-organism, however, the LUCA lived after the genetic code and at least some rudimentary early form of molecular proofreading had already evolved. It was not the very first cell, but rather, <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>whose</b> descendants survived beyond the very early stages of microbial evolution.|$|E
25|$|It {{is popular}} with school {{children}} in India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka, specially the Backbenchers occupying {{the last few}} rows, who most often play it sneakily during the ongoing class, a favorite childhood nostalgia of adults to reminisce about. It has several variants and is mostly played by two players. The runs are scored by flipping the book open at random and the last digit of the right-side (even-numbered) page is counted {{as the number of}} runs scored. 0 (and sometimes 8) are assigned to special rules, typically a wicket is lost when a person scores 0 and scoring 8 would be substituted for a No ball run and an additional chance. To give an example, if the batting side opened the book at page 26, then 6 runs would be scored. For the toss, what is generally done is that both the players open a page and <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>whose</b> last digit is greater wins.|$|E

30|$|On {{the basis}} of our observations, we define two {{concepts}} to differentiate the static and temporal flow of vertices in knowledge mobilization networks. We call rapids the nodes with high foremost betweenness, meaning that they can potentially mobilize knowledge in a timelier manner, and brooks <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> with insignificant foremost betweenness. Moreover, we call invisible rapids those vertices whose temporal betweenness rank is considerably more significant than their static rank (i.e., <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>whose</b> centrality was undetected by static betweenness), and invisible brooks <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>whose</b> static betweenness is considerably higher than their temporal betweenness, meaning that these vertices can potentially be effective knowledge mobilizers, yet they are not acting as effectively as others due to slow or non-timely relations.|$|R

25|$|Muslim {{scholars}} {{were divided}} on the motives behind Cain's murder of Abel, and further why the two brothers were obliged to offer sacrifices to God. Some scholars believed that Cain's motives were plain jealousy and lust. Both Cain and Abel desired to marry Adam's beautiful daughter, Aclima (Aqlimia in Arabic). Seeking to end to the dispute between them, Adam suggested that each present an offering before God. <b>The</b> <b>one</b> <b>whose</b> offering God accepted would marry Aclima. Abel, a generous shepherd, offered the fattest of his sheep as an oblation to God. But Cain, a miserly farmer, offered only a bunch of grass and some worthless seeds to him. God accepted Abel's offering and rejected Cain's—an indication that Abel was more righteous than Cain, and thus worthier of Aclima. As a result, {{it was decided that}} Abel would marry Aclima. Cain, on the other hand, would marry her less beautiful sister. Blinded by anger and lust for Aclima, Cain sought to get revenge on Abel and escape with Aclima.|$|E

In {{this paper}} we investigate computably enumerable algebras and provide several algebraic and computable theoretic distinctions of these algebras {{from the class}} of computable algebras. We give a characterization of computably enumerable but not computable algebras in terms of congruences and effective conjunctions of Π 0 1 -sentences. Our characterization, for example, shows that computable conjunctions of negative atomic formulas true in a given c. e. algebra can be preserved in infinitely many of its homomorphic images. We also study questions on how expansions of algebras by finitely many new functions affect computable isomorphism types. In particular, we construct a c. e. algebra with unique computable isomorphism type but which has no finitely generated c. e. expansion. ...|$|R
