500|$|Jim DeRogatis, {{author of}} <b>Turn</b> <b>on</b> <b>Your</b> Mind: Four Decades of Great Psychedelic Rock, {{described}} the overall sound of Before and After Science as [...] "the coldest and most clinical of Eno's pop efforts", while David Ross Smith of online music database AllMusic wrote that [...] "Despite the album's pop format, {{the sound is}} unique and strays far from the mainstream". According to David Bowie's biographer Thomas Jerome Seabrook, the album is [...] "split between up-tempo art-rock on side one and more pastoral material on side two", while Piotr Orlov of LA Weekly categorized it as an art pop record. The album's opening tracks [...] "No One Receiving" [...] and [...] "Backwater" [...] start the album as upbeat and bouncy songs. [...] "King's Lead Hat" [...] is an anagram of Talking Heads, a new wave group Eno had met after a concert in England when they were touring with Ramones. Eno would later produce Talking Heads' second, third and fourth albums, including Remain in Light. The last five songs of the album {{have been described as}} having [...] "an occasional pastoral quality" [...] and being [...] "pensive and atmospheric".|$|E

6000|$|... 'And wha is't tou's gotten, Wullie, lad?' said half a {{score of}} voices, while all eyes were <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>your</b> humble servant, who kept the best countenance he could, though not quite easy at {{becoming}} the centre to which all eyes were pointed.|$|R
6000|$|... {{puts them}} both in a nutshell. A woman never {{thoroughly}} cares for her lover until he has ceased to care for her; {{and it is not}} until you have snapped your fingers in Fortune's face and <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>your</b> heel that she begins to smile upon you.|$|R

6000|$|... "Then {{it will be}} a fine haul {{inside the}} Rat Mort," [...] ejaculated Carrier with a chuckle. [...] "Eh, Jacques, you young scamp? You and I must go and see that, what? You have been {{complaining}} that life was getting monotonous. Drownages--Republican marriages! They have all palled in their <b>turn</b> <b>on</b> <b>your</b> jaded appetite.... But the capture of the English assassins, eh?... of that League of the Scarlet Pimpernel which has even caused citizen Robespierre much uneasiness--that will stir up your sluggish blood, you lazy young vermin!... Go on, go on, citizen Chauvelin, I am vastly interested!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{will never}} {{get a chance to}} do that, Mr. Wyatt, in a fight; you have got to whip out your pistol, to throw up your arm and fire. It has got to be done by {{instinct}} rather than by aim. It is all very well to aim when you are on your feet and standing perfectly steady, but on a horse half-mad with excitement, and perhaps going at a gallop, you could no more hold your arm steady on a mark than you could fly. Put down the pistol for a time. Now you know, sir, when you point at a thing with your first finger extended, however quickly you do it, you will be there or thereabout, and it is the same thing if you have got a pistol in your hand. You see that black patch on the wall {{to the right of the}} target. Now turn your back to it. Now, when I give the word, <b>turn</b> <b>on</b> <b>your</b> heels, and the moment your eye catches that patch throw up your arm with your forefinger extended and point to it. When you get it up there, hold it as steady as you can. Now, sir!" ...|$|E

6000|$|March 2.--I have {{a letter}} from Colin Mackenzie, {{approving}} Malachi,--"Cold men may say it is too strong; but from the true men of Scotland you are sure of the warmest gratitude." [...] I never have yet found, nor do I expect it on this occasion, that ill-will dies in debt, or what is called gratitude distresses herself by frequent payments. The one is like a ward-holding and pays its reddendo in hard blows. The other a blanch-tenure, and is discharged for payment of a red rose or a peppercorn. He that takes the forlorn hope in an attack, is often deserted by those that should support him, and who generally throw the blame of their own cowardice upon his rashness. We shall see this will end in the same way. But I foresaw it from the beginning. The bankers will be persuaded {{that it is a}} squib which may burn their own fingers, and will curse the poor pyrotechnist that compounded it; if they do, they be d--d. Slept indifferently, and dreamed of Napoleon's last moments, of which I was reading a medical account last night, by Dr. Arnott. Horrible death--a cancer on the pylorus. I would have given something to have lain still this morning and made up for lost time. But desidiae valedixi. If you once <b>turn</b> <b>on</b> <b>your</b> side after the hour at which you ought to rise, it is all over. Bolt up at once. Bad night last--the next is sure to be better.|$|E

5000|$|Trautman's {{relationship}} to Rambo {{in the book}} First Blood sharply contrasts that portrayed in the movie of the same name. In the book, Rambo barely remembers Trautman, and in fact, after hearing his voice, he strains to recall him. Trautman then identifies himself as [...] "Director of the school that trained you" [...] over the car radio. In the book, Rambo doesn't reply to him, and, in fact, says to himself, [...] "The Bastard. <b>Turning</b> <b>on</b> <b>your</b> own kind Trautman's assistance to Teasle." [...] Their one significant interaction comes {{at the end of}} the book, when Trautman tells Teasle that he [...] "took the top of his Rambo's head off with this shotgun." ...|$|R

Although wireless networks have already become commonplace and continuously expand their area of application with new technologies, like Bluetooth, wire-line networks as backbones or broadband bearer technologies will {{continue to play a}} significant role. A scenarios where the user has the requirement of using all available services on the road just as he would at home, in other words without needing to know any details about the network infrastructure â€“ whether it will be by plugging your laptop to hotel network or <b>turning</b> <b>on</b> <b>your</b> wireless LAN <b>on</b> <b>your</b> PDA â€“ will become more and more common. It is in situations like these where agent technologies will become very useful. User agents on userâ€™s device can discover the network, and locate and communicate with services on the network transparently to the user...|$|R

5000|$|Letissier {{said that}} the song is [...] "an easy song with an uneasy subject. Itâ€™s about feeling out of place, not finding your balance, or being {{depressed}} even, but with playful images, with a song you can dance on." [...] She explained that the song is about [...] "embracing {{the fact that you}} can't really find your balance", which in her case is embracing her own awkwardness and the feeling of being imperfect. It would therefore be about [...] "embracing who you are", and [...] "being proud of who you are and where you stand". She also explained the English title of the song: [...] "The French song is talking about the same difficulty of <b>turning</b> <b>on</b> <b>your</b> feet. I was searching for lots of images or words that could fit, and I just stumbled upon this word, to tilt or be tilted, and I was exactly trying to find this image. Itâ€™s literally talking about not finding your balance with a playful image." ...|$|R

6000|$|True, all <b>turns</b> <b>on</b> <b>your</b> Ready-Reckoner being {{moderately}} correct,--being not insupportably incorrect! A Ready-Reckoner {{which has}} led to distinct entries in your Ledger such as these: 'Creditor an English People by fifteen hundred years of good Labour; and Debtor to lodging in enchanted Poor-Law Bastilles: Creditor by conquering the largest Empire the Sun ever saw; and Debtor to Donothingism and [...] "Impossible" [...] written on all departments of the government thereof: Creditor by mountains of gold ingots earned; and Debtor to No Bread purchasable by them:'--such Ready-Reckoner, methinks, is beginning to be suspect; nay is ceasing, and has ceased, to be suspect! Such Ready-Reckoner is a Solecism in Eastcheap; and must, whatever be the press of business, and will and shall be rectified a little. Business can go on no longer with it. The most Conservative English People, thickest-skinned, most patient of Peoples, is driven alike by its Logic and its Unlogic, by things 'spoken,' and by things not yet spoken or very speakable, but only felt and very unendurable, to be wholly a Reforming People. Their Life, as it is, has ceased to be longer possible for them.|$|R
