40|$|Abstract: The paper {{represents}} an {{analysis in the}} domain of <b>the</b> social <b>insurances</b> for health care. It emphasizes the necessity and the opportunity of creating in Romania a medical service market based on the competing system. In Romania, <b>the</b> social <b>insurances</b> for health care are at their very beginning. The development of the domain of <b>the</b> private <b>insurances</b> for health care is prevented even by its legislation, {{due to the lack of}} a normative act that may regulate the management of <b>the</b> private <b>insurances</b> for health care. The establishment of the legislation related to <b>the</b> optional <b>insurances</b> for health care might lead to some activity norms for the companies which carry out optional insurances for health care. The change of the legislation is made in order to create normative and financial opportunities for the development of <b>the</b> optional medical <b>insurances.</b> This change, as part of the social protection of people, will positively influence the development of <b>the</b> medical <b>insurance</b> system. <b>The</b> extension of the segment of <b>the</b> optional <b>insurances</b> into <b>the</b> medical <b>insurance</b> segment increases <b>the</b> health protection budget with the value of the financial sources which do not belong to the budgetary funds...|$|R
