40|$|We {{extend our}} recent work with K. Zumbrun on long-time {{stability}} of multi-dimensional noncharacteristic viscous boundary layers {{of a class}} of symmetrizable hyperbolic-parabolic systems. Our main improvements are (i) to establish the stability for a larger class of systems in dimensions d> 2, yielding the result for certain magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) layers; (ii) <b>to</b> <b>drop</b> <b>a</b> technical <b>assumption</b> on the so [...] called glancing set which was required in previous works. We also provide a different proof of low-frequency estimates by employing the method of Kreiss' symmetrizers, replacing the one relying on detailed derivation of pointwise bounds on the resolvent kernel.

40|$|Let X be {{a normal}} {{projective}} variety over a complete discretely valued field and L a line bundle on X. We denote by X^an the analytification of X {{in the sense of}} Berkovich and equip the analytification L^an of L with a continuous metric. We study non-archimedean volumes, a tool which allows us to control the asymptotic growth of small sections of big powers of L. We prove that the non-archimedean volume is differentiable at a continuous semipositive metric and that the derivative is given by integration with respect to a Monge-Ampère measure. Such a differentiability formula had been proposed by M. Kontsevich and Y. Tschinkel. In residue characteristic zero, it implies an orthogonality property for non-archimedean plurisubharmonic functions which allows us <b>to</b> <b>drop</b> <b>an</b> algebraicity <b>assumption</b> in <b>a</b> theorem of S. Boucksom, C. Favre and M. Jonsson about the solution to the non-archimedean Monge-Ampère equation. The appendix by R. Lazarsfeld establishes the holomorphic Morse inequalities in arbitrary characteristic. Comment: 36 pages, ampleness assumptions removed and old proofs restored for Theorem A, Theorem B, Proposition 4. 2. 2 and Theorem 4. 2. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{establish}} long-time {{stability of}} multi-dimensional viscous shocks {{of a general}} class of symmetric hyperbolic [...] parabolic systems with variable multiplicities, notably including the equations of compressible magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) in dimensions d> 2. This extends the existing result established by K. Zumbrun for systems with characteristics of constant multiplicity to the ones with variable multiplicity, yielding the first such a stability result for (fast) MHD shocks. At the same time, we are able <b>to</b> <b>drop</b> <b>a</b> technical <b>assumption</b> on structure of the so [...] called glancing set that was necessarily used in previous analyses. The key idea to the improvements is to introduce a new simple argument for obtaining a L^ 1 → L^p resolvent bound in low [...] frequency regimes by employing the recent construction of degenerate Kreiss' symmetrizers by O. Guès, G. Métivier, M. Williams, and K. Zumbrun. Thus, at the low-frequency resolvent bound level, our analysis gives {{an alternative to the}} earlier pointwise Green's function approach of K. Zumbrun. High [...] frequency solution operator bounds have been previously established entirely by nonlinear energy estimates. Comment: 30 pages, the exposition is greatly expanded in detail...|$|R
