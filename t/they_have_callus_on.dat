40|$|This paper {{describes}} the detailed skeletal anatomy of chasmopinid trilobites from the Ordovician of the Oslo region, and Phacops from the Polish Devonian. Lamination of the cuticle {{is similar to}} that previously reported, and the outermost prismatic layer has been conclusively proved. Several types of tubercles or pustules {{on the surface of the}} exoskeleton have been identified, for which a classification is proposed. Canals through the exoskeleton range from about 1 - 40 micro-m in diameter. In Chasmops spp. apparently smooth tubercles have a thin central canal through the outer zone changing downwards into a wide canal. This smooth tubercle organ shows some resemblance with the sensory campanular organ (mechanoreceptor) in Recent arthropods. Sections of the big composite tubercles or pustules in Phacops have revealed two sets of ducts, partly with different directions: (1) numerous close-set fine (4 micro-m) canals in a fan-like arrangement, and (2) diffuse ramifying branches or tubes with distal bundles of tubules, the blunt terminals of which are inserted into the lower surface of the outer zone of the exoskeleton. This internal tubules organ might possibly, in general features, be analogous with the much smaller campanular organ in the halteres in Diptera. Just below the prismatic layer there are numerous small (10 - 20 micro-m) subsphaeric cavities apparently connected with the epidermis by a single thin (1. 5 - 2. 0 micro-m) perpendicular canal, which are termed Osmolska cavity organs. There is a considerable variation in muscle-scar pattern. Some species <b>have</b> <b>calluses</b> <b>on</b> the inner surface corresponding to shallow pits on the outer surface. Similar pits and dark patches, and knobs or <b>calluses</b> <b>on</b> the inner surface of the exoskeleton, are scars or small apodemes of muscles leading from the dorsal exoskeleton to the presumed thin membrane representing the ventral body wall inside the marginal doublure. ...|$|R

They would not {{allow themselves to be}} dressed, scratched and bit people who tried to feed them, rejected cooked food and walked on all fours. Both girls <b>had</b> developed thick <b>calluses</b> <b>on</b> their palms and knees from having walked on all fours. The girls were mostly nocturnal, had an aversion to sunshine, and could see very well in the dark. They also exhibited an acute sense of smell and an enhanced ability to hear.|$|R
50|$|The {{height of}} the shell attains 3 mm, its {{diameter}} 4 mm. The smooth, whitish shell is covered with an extremely thin epidermis which rises in microscopic blisters. The rounded, depressed spire has a distinct suture. It consists {{of three or four}} whorls. The sculpture shows faint lines of growth except on the base where a single rounded riblet or carina bounds a somewhat concave lunate space outside of thepolished columella. The thin, sharp outer lip <b>has</b> a moderate <b>callus</b> <b>on</b> the body. The thick columella is polished. The translucent operculum is yellowish and contains about five turns. The rounded aperture has a slight angle behind.|$|R
5000|$|The flowers grow solitary {{on short}} stalks, called scapes, {{from the base}} of the pseudobulb. Most are small to very small, but some species carry large, showy flowers. The flowers are never longer than the leaves. Their free petals and sepals have a {{typically}} curved and adnate labellum with three inconspicuous lobes. Or the lip may <b>have</b> a distinct <b>callus</b> <b>on</b> the disc ( [...] = central part of the lip from which the lobes radiate). The papillae (= small warts like glands) and the trichomes of the lip show great diversity. The most common form for the papillae is the conical form with rounded or pointed tips.|$|R
50|$|The Tabaninae lack ocelli (simple eyes) {{and have}} no spurs on the tips of their hind tibiae. In the Pangoniinae, ocelli are present and the antennal {{flagellum}} (whip-like structure) usually has eight annuli (or rings). In the Chrysopsinae, the antennal flagellum has a basal plate and the flagellum has four annuli. Females <b>have</b> a shining <b>callus</b> <b>on</b> the frons (front of the head between the eyes). The Adersiinae have a divided tergite on the ninth abdominal segment, and the Scepsidinae have highly reduced mouthparts. Members of the family Pelecorhynchidae were initially included in the Tabanidae and moved into the Rhagionidae before being elevated into a separate family. The infraorder Tabanomorpha share the blood-feeding habit as a common primitive character, although this is restricted to the female.|$|R
5000|$|Katie {{has been}} on one of Oakdale's most beloved {{characters}} and her relationship with con artist and jewel smuggler Simon Frasier (Paul Leyden) {{has become one of}} daytime's most successful modern day supercouples. Known as [...] "Skatie," [...] the couple has transcended the small screen and was documented In the show-inspired novel Oakdale Confidential: A Novel. Katie said of her relationship with him that [...] "When it came to Simon, I now <b>had</b> <b>calluses</b> upon <b>calluses</b> <b>on</b> my heart to protect me from his powers of persuasion." [...] Their marriage and subsequent on-again, off-again relationship came about in between Katie's breakups and divorces with Henry Coleman and Mike Kasnoff and the death of her other great love Brad Snyder, who she shares a son with, Jacob Snyder. Although Henry and Katie's friendship remained strong, Henry's portrayer Trent Dawson said that [...] "Katie loved Henry, but she wasn't in love with him." [...] Katie was also married to Brad's brother Jack Snyder in 2007. The marriage was rushed due to Katie's insecurities and her dislike for his ex-wife Carly Snyder, as well as Jack's own issues. Katie eventually became engaged to former love Chris Hughes {{by the end of the}} series. Among Katie's other relationships were her best friends Henry and his ex-fiancee Vienna Hyatt, both of whom became surrogate family to her. Katie's family includes her parents Casey Peretti and Lyla Crawford and maternal half-siblings Margo Montgomery Hughes, her greatest ally throughout all of her tribulations, Cricket Montgomery Ross and Craig Montgomery, who is one of the town's most feared villains.|$|R
40|$|Background and setting: The sucking of digits {{has been}} {{considered}} to affect the occlusal development and dentition of a child. When a dentist comes across a child with severe malocclusion like over-jet, posterior cross-bite, anterior teeth spacing, etc., {{it is often difficult}} for him to decide if a child has developed a digit-sucking habit. The presence of a <b>callus</b> <b>on</b> the finger is indicative of sucking off that finger and indirectly suggests malocclusion. Aims and Objectives: To determine the presence of <b>calluses</b> <b>on</b> fingers of 1000 randomly picked school going children of this district, and to correlate it with the presence of malocclusion in order to counsel or treat the child early and prevent the development of malocclusion in his later years. Materials and Methods: 1000 school children (250 in each age group) between 2 and 6 years of age, of both sexes, were randomly picked to observe the presence of <b>callus</b> <b>on</b> their fingers. They were then asked about their finger sucking habits and finally checked for alterations in occlusion. Results: Of the children in the age group 2 - 3 years, it was found that 24 % <b>had</b> <b>calluses</b> and 28 % presented with malocclusion. Callus was seen in 26 % cases of the 3. 1 - 4 years age group; of which, 94 % had finger sucking habit and 97 % of them had malocclusion. In the 4. 1 - 5 years group, 12 % had calluses; of whom, 87 % had the habit and 87 % presented with malocclusion. Of the 250 children in the age bracket 5 - 6 years, 8 % had callus; 7 % had the digit sucking habit, and 7 % had malocclusion. Conclusion: The presence of a callus is a definite indication of the digit sucking; which is an indirect indicator for malocclusion...|$|R

30|$|Since {{mechanical}} stimulation can induce fracture healing or alter its {{biological pathway}} (Claes et al., 1997; Claes et al., 1998; Goodship & Kenwright, 1985; Isaksson, 2012), the clinical performance of implants {{could not be}} only correlated to their mechanical performance in terms of static and fatigue strength. But it is a necessary condition to have a minimum stability for the functionality of the bone implant-constructs. Of course there are other aspects {{that have to be}} taken into account. Although not investigated here, it is important to mention the effects that implants <b>have</b> <b>on</b> <b>callus</b> formation and bone healing, often referred to as “callus massage”, which is explained by the strain theory (Hente et al., 1993; Hente et al., 2001; Nelissen et al., 2010; Perren, 2002; Perren, 2010; Schröter et al., 2011; Staubli & Jacob, 2010). As the effect of the flexibility of the bone-implant construct <b>on</b> the <b>callus</b> massage was not so far investigated in the present study, we cannot draw conclusions regarding this aspect.|$|R

Growth of embryogenic <b>callus</b> <b>on</b> sorbitol was unique among the carbon sources tested in that sorbitol supported the subsequent growth of only embryogenic callus. Further experiments demonstrated that embryogenic <b>callus</b> grown <b>on</b> sorbitol <b>had</b> a greater regenerative capacity (more plants produced per gram fresh weight of callus) than <b>callus</b> grown <b>on</b> sucrose.
