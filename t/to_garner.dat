According <b>to</b> <b>Garner's</b> 1999 videotaped Archive of American Television interview, not only did the network change the name of the series <b>to</b> James <b>Garner</b> as Nichols, but Garner had Nichols killed in the last episode so that a sequel could never be made.|$|R

5|$|Indonesia used fear of {{communism}} <b>to</b> <b>garner</b> {{varying degrees of}} support among western countries, including the United States and Australia, for its East Timor invasion and occupation. The invasion and suppression of East Timor's independence movement caused great harm to Indonesia's reputation and international credibility.

5|$|Like its predecessor, the 747X {{family was}} unable <b>to</b> <b>garner</b> enough {{interest}} to justify production, {{and it was}} shelved along with the 767-400ERX in March 2001, when Boeing announced the Sonic Cruiser concept. Though the 747X design was less costly than the 747-500X and -600X, it was criticized for not offering a sufficient advance from the existing 747-400. The 747X {{did not make it}} beyond the drawing board, but the 747-400X being developed concurrently moved into production to become the 747-400ER.|$|E
