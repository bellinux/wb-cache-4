60|$|But {{they will}} be afraid to act ill, if {{they know that the}} day of their account is always near. I wish it were true, but it is not; here again we have {{experience}}, and experience is against us. The distemper of this age is a poverty of spirit and of genius; it is trifling, it is futile, worse than ignorant, superficially taught, with the politics and morals of girls at a boarding-school, rather than of men and statesmen; but it is not yet desperately wicked, or so scandalously venal as in former times. Did not a triennial parliament give up the national dignity, approve the Peace of Utrecht, and almost give up everything else in taking every step to defeat the Protestant succession? Was not the Constitution saved by those who had no election at all to go to, the Lords, because <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> <b>applied</b> <b>to</b> electors, and by various means carried them from their true interests; so that the Tory Ministry had a majority without an application to a single member? Now, as to the conduct of the members, it was then far from pure and independent. Bribery was infinitely more flagrant. A predecessor of yours, Mr. Speaker, put the question of his own expulsion for bribery. Sir William Musgrave was a wise man, a grave man, an independent man, a man of good fortune and good family; however, he carried on while in opposition a traffic, a shameful traffic with the Ministry. Bishop Burnet knew of 6,000 pounds which he had received at one payment. I believe the payment of sums in hard money--plain, naked bribery--is rare amongst us. It was then far from uncommon.|$|E

50|$|The {{responsibility}} for Indian Affairs and Northern Development rested with various government departments between 1873 and 1966. The Minister of the Interior also held {{the position of}} Superintendent-General of Indian Affairs after the Indian Affairs Department was established in 1880. In 1939, federal jurisdiction for Indian peoples was interpreted by <b>the</b> <b>courts</b> <b>to</b> <b>apply</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Inuit. A revised Indian Act was passed in 1951.|$|R
500|$|Again in dicta, <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> seemed <b>to</b> <b>apply</b> <b>the</b> {{concept of}} adverse {{possession}} to aboriginal lands: ...|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>court</b> chose <b>to</b> <b>apply</b> <b>the</b> {{evidence}} test as {{the former}} test was regarded as lacking precision.|$|R
50|$|Therefore, the {{judgment}} was reversed and remanded, with an instruction <b>to</b> <b>the</b> district <b>court</b> <b>to</b> <b>apply</b> <b>the</b> Massachusetts burden of proof.|$|R
5000|$|In {{considering}} {{whether or not}} a party's claim for costs is [...] "proportionate", <b>the</b> <b>court</b> has <b>to</b> <b>apply</b> one of two different tests.|$|R
50|$|Depending {{upon the}} intent {{and scope of}} the law, it may be held by <b>the</b> <b>court</b> <b>to</b> <b>apply</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{previously}} unaccounted-for situation by analogy, or <b>to</b> not not <b>apply</b> because the cases are insufficiently analogous, such that a legislative change to the law's wording would be required for such an expansion of scope. Cases raising such questions are increasingly common as technology introduces capabilities that are somewhat but not exactly analogous to those provided by older technologies. A high-profile example of the use of argumentum a contrario (rejected by <b>the</b> <b>court)</b> in such a case is Steve Jackson Games, Inc. v. United States Secret Service.|$|R
50|$|This {{circumstance}} caused <b>the</b> <b>court</b> <b>to</b> <b>apply</b> <b>the</b> rule of lenity {{since the}} NFA carries criminal penalties with it. This meant that ambiguous statutes are interpreted against the government.|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to <b>the</b> regular law <b>courts,</b> East Germany also developed an extensive system {{of community and}} social courts (gesellschaftliche Gerichte), known also as [...] "conflict or arbitration commissions" [...] (Konflikt-und Schiedskommissionen). The first were formed in state-owned and private enterprises, health and educational institutions, offices, and social organizations. The second were established in residential areas, collective farms, and cooperatives of manual laborers, fishermen, and gardeners. Created to relieve <b>the</b> regular <b>courts</b> of their minor civil or criminal case loads, the jurisdiction of <b>the</b> <b>courts</b> <b>applied</b> <b>to</b> labor disputes, minor breaches of the peace, misdemeanors, infringements of the law, truancy, and conflicts in civil law. These courts were composed of lay jurors elected by their respective constituencies. Party officials at the community level generally influenced the nomination of jurors to <b>the</b> community <b>courts</b> and exercised considerable influence {{on the outcome of}} cases heard at this level.|$|R
50|$|The {{holding of}} <b>the</b> <b>court</b> <b>applies</b> retroactively <b>to</b> all those convicted of crimes {{committed}} under 18. It {{does not automatically}} free any prisoner, {{and it does not}} forbid sentences of life terms for young murderers. Instead judges in their review have to consider the defendant’s youth, mitigating factors, {{and the nature of the}} crime before sentencing the defendant to imprisonment with no hope for parole.|$|R
25|$|Justice Kennedy also dissented separately, {{arguing that}} <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> failed <b>to</b> <b>apply,</b> in fact, strict {{scrutiny}} {{as required by}} Justice Powell's opinion in Bakke. Both Scalia and Thomas also dissented separately.|$|R
50|$|Any {{amendment}} {{to the list of}} crimes within the jurisdiction of <b>the</b> <b>court</b> will only <b>apply</b> <b>to</b> those states parties that have ratified it. It does not need a seven-eighths majority of ratifications.|$|R
50|$|The {{objective}} {{element of}} the test, approached with the spirit, purport and objects of the Constitution in mind, {{was found to be}} sufficiently flexible to incorporate constitutional as well as other norms. It required <b>the</b> <b>court</b> <b>applying</b> it <b>to</b> articulate its reasoning for its conclusions as to whether there was a sufficient connection between the wrongful conduct and the employment. Thus developed, the application of the test was not at odds with the constitutional order.|$|R

5000|$|In the United States, the First Amendment to the Constitution {{contains}} a similar federal concept, although the term [...] "laicity" [...] {{is not used}} either in the Constitution or elsewhere, and is in fact used as a term to contrast European secularism with American secularism. That amendment includes clauses prohibiting both congressional governmental interference with the [...] "free exercise" [...] of religion, and congressional laws regarding the establishment of religion. Originally this prevented the federal government from interfering with state-established religions. But after the 14th amendment, these clauses have been held by <b>the</b> <b>courts</b> <b>to</b> <b>apply</b> <b>to</b> both <b>the</b> federal and state governments. Together, the [...] "free exercise clause" [...] and [...] "establishment clause" [...] are considered to accomplish a [...] "separation of church and state." ...|$|R
50|$|In 1985, <b>the</b> Supreme <b>Court</b> again {{revisited}} <b>the</b> {{topic of}} involuntary bodily intrusions in Winston v. Lee, when <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> held that <b>the</b> State of Virginia could not force {{an individual to}} undergo surgery to extract a bullet that may be evidence of a crime. <b>The</b> <b>Court</b> did not explicitly evaluate whether the surgery would violate substantive due process, but <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> <b>applied</b> Schmerber <b>to</b> conclude that the surgery would constitute an unreasonable search under the Fourth Amendment.|$|R
25|$|The {{rationale}} of <b>the</b> <b>Court's</b> judgment <b>applies</b> equally <b>to</b> deportation cases, {{where other}} articles of the Convention may apply, such as Article 6 (right {{to a fair}} trial), as seen in Othman (Abu Qatada) v. United Kingdom (2012).|$|R
500|$|The dissenters noted various {{historical}} {{examples of}} <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> <b>applying</b> laches <b>to</b> Indian equitable claims, {{and argued that}} the doctrine should also be <b>applied</b> <b>to</b> the action of ejectment (which they admitted was an action at law, not equity). Specifically, they cited [...] "hree decisions of this <b>Court</b> illustrate <b>the</b> application {{of the doctrine of}} laches to actions seeking to set aside conveyances made in violation of federal law." [...] Moreover, the dissenters quoted Lewis v. Marshall, 30 U.S. 470 (1831), for the proposition that: ...|$|R
50|$|In dissent, Judge Karen Nelson Moore {{maintained}} that strict scrutiny should govern the as-applied challenge. In reply, Sutton's majority opinion stated that Connection did not urge <b>the</b> <b>court</b> <b>to</b> <b>apply</b> strict scrutiny <b>to</b> the case, {{and that the}} reasons given in the opinion justified the decision.|$|R
5000|$|In camera {{proceedings}} {{are allowed}} for protection of witnesses or defendants {{as well as}} for confidential or sensitive evidence. However, the statute states that this is an exception to the principle of public hearings which <b>the</b> <b>court</b> <b>applies</b> in particular <b>to</b> victims of sexual violence and children who are victims or witnesses.|$|R
50|$|Tenenbaum was not {{the only}} one who had been given a lawsuit as, after September 8, 2003, there were {{thousands}} of similar lawsuits being filed.

40|$|The fourth {{amendment}} to the United States Constitution proscribes 2 ̆ 2 unreasonable searches and seizures 2 ̆ 2 and requires that warrants be issued only upon probable cause. There is no distinction drawn between an administrative inspection and a criminal search. Yet, a different treatment has evolved in Supreme Court decisions on these two classifications of searches. This Comment addresses Maryland 2 ̆ 7 s warrantless administrative inspection laws {{in light of the}} standards that <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> has <b>applied</b> <b>to</b> similar enactments...|$|R
5000|$|The Constitution {{provides}} that all Americans {{have the right}} to free speech; specifically, the First Amendment states that [...] "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or {{the right of the people}} peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances."This prohibition has been interpreted by <b>the</b> <b>courts</b> as <b>applying</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> entire federal government, but is not unlimited.|$|R
40|$|The {{topic of}} the present work is the complex topical {{medication}} that <b>the</b> <b>court</b> surgeon <b>applied</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> left arm of the Renaissance noblewoman Mary of Aragon to treat a deep ulcerated luetic gumma.

5000|$|Section 4 of Article VII of the Oklahoma Constitution {{outlines}} {{the jurisdiction of}} <b>the</b> Supreme <b>Court</b> of Oklahoma. <b>The</b> appellate jurisdiction of <b>the</b> Supreme <b>Court</b> is co-extensive {{with that of the}} state's borders. <b>The</b> <b>court's</b> jurisdiction <b>applies</b> <b>to</b> all cases [...] "at law and in equity," [...] except criminal cases, in which <b>the</b> Oklahoma <b>Court</b> of Criminal Appeals has exclusive appellate jurisdiction.

50|$|On 12 December, Military lawyer Major Kitione Tuinaosara {{announced}} {{a decision to}} sue Finance Minister Ratu Jone Kubuabola for contempt of court, after a government decision to disregard <b>the</b> <b>court</b> order to drop the surcharge and refund money already docked from Commodore Bainimarama's pay. The Ministry claimed that <b>the</b> <b>court</b> order <b>applied</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> 1971 Financial Regulations Act, {{but not to the}} 2004 Finance Management Act or the 2005 Finance Instructions Act, and invoked the new laws. Bainimarama continued to be surcharged at a rate of F$381 a fortnight.|$|R
5000|$|The {{commentary}} {{surrounding this}} case has been careful to avoid the affirmative declaration that Christou's friends list was a trade secret.This is because <b>the</b> <b>court's</b> order <b>applied</b> <b>to</b> a motion to dismiss.An order from this context does not actually certify that the friends list was a trade secret.Instead, <b>the</b> <b>court</b> concluded [...] "only that Roulier, et al., had not proven that the list {{could not be a}} trade secret."The decision allowed Christou to proceed with his claim, and he would then have to prove that the friends list was a trade secret.|$|R
40|$|What {{market model}} should {{determine}} {{the boundaries of}} negative integration, and in particular: what test should <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> <b>apply</b> <b>to</b> art. 34 TFEU? After Keck, {{there is no single}} answer to this question. Having expressly acknowledged the existence of different tests for different types of measures, <b>the</b> post- Keck <b>Court</b> develops three jurisprudential lines that follow three different market models. While confining measures regulating selling arrangements to an international model, <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> also confirms <b>the</b> parameters of the Cassis model for product requirements; and, with Italian Trailers, it cultivates a third jurisprudential line on consumer-use restrictions that comes close to a national market model. It is {{in the context of this}} third line that <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> elevates <b>the</b> market access principle to centre stage; and it is this development that has prompted the question how the three jurisprudential lines relate to each other. Have they remained separate—parallel—lines; or have they converged in a single doctrinal framework that generally <b>applies</b> <b>to</b> all measures falling within art. 34 ? In Ker-Optika and its progeny, <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> appears to rhetorically combine all three lines in a unitary framework; yet various ambivalences within this doctrinal solution have remained. This article explores the possibilities for a doctrinal framework and charts the unstable post- Keck jurisprudence on art. 34 TFEU in light of such an unitary framework...|$|R
5000|$|The legal {{implication}} of the Stashynsky case were that <b>the</b> <b>courts</b> had ruled that in a totalitarian system only executive decision-makers could be convicted of murder and that anyone who followed orders and killed someone could be convicted only of being accomplices to murder. The term executive decision-maker was so defined by <b>the</b> <b>courts</b> <b>to</b> <b>apply</b> only <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{highest levels of the}} Reich leadership during the National Socialist period, and that all who just followed orders when killing were just accomplices to murder. Someone could be only convicted of murder if it was shown that they had killed someone on their own initiative, and thus all of the accused of murder at the Auschwitz trial were tried only for murders that they done on their own initiative.|$|R
50|$|Only {{after a year}} in {{detention}} did Zia-Zarifi finally get a hearing in a court, albeit a patently unfair one. He, along with 13 {{other members of the}} group (including Jazani) faced a military tribunal that was blatantly unjust and observed no due process whatsoever. The prosecutor asked <b>the</b> <b>court</b> <b>to</b> <b>apply</b> <b>the</b> death penalty to Zia-Zarifi and Jazani.|$|R
5000|$|Justice Werdegar focused her dissent {{on three}} key arguments: {{the cell phone}} as a {{relatively}} new piece of technology, {{the fact that the}} search of the cell phone occurred some time after the phone was confiscated, and that the precedents cited by <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> did not <b>apply</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> cell phone as a [...] "container." ...|$|R
