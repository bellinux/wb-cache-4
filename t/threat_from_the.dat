5|$|As a {{tropical}} storm, Iris produced heavy rainfall {{across much of}} the Leeward Islands. In the southern Lesser Antilles, high waves caused coastal flooding in Trinidad, while in Martinique further north, significant amounts of precipitation led to flooding and landslides. The <b>threat</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> hurricane halted airplane evacuations on Montserrat, which was being threatened by the eruption of the Soufrière Hills volcano. There were five deaths in association with Irisfour in Martinique, and one in Guadeloupe.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the conquest}} of Mecca, Muhammad was alarmed by a {{military}} <b>threat</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> confederate tribes of Hawazin who were raising an army double the size of Muhammad's. The Banu Hawazin were old enemies of the Meccans. They were joined by the Banu Thaqif (inhabiting the city of Ta'if) who adopted an anti-Meccan policy due to {{the decline of the}} prestige of Meccans. Muhammad defeated the Hawazin and Thaqif tribes in the Battle of Hunayn.|$|E

5|$|In 907 Chester was refortified {{against the}} <b>threat</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Vikings, and shortly {{afterwards}} the minster was founded or refounded, and Werburgh's remains were transferred there from Hanbury, probably by Æthelflæd, Lady of the Mercians. The collegiate church, {{as it was}} then, was restored in 1057 by Leofric, Earl of Mercia and Lady Godiva. This church was razed to the ground around 1090, with the secular canons evicted, and no known trace of it remains.|$|E
5|$|In {{the last}} eight weeks of the war the bombing {{intensified}} until British bombing operations were suspended in late April 1945. By this time, most of the German airfields were under <b>threat</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> advancing Allied ground forces and the mass surrender of the Nachtjagd was taking place.|$|E
5|$|Llywelyn the Great {{initially}} {{controlled the}} princedom of Gwynedd, but grew more powerful {{over the course}} of his reign, extending his influence over much of Wales during the early years of the 13th century. Llywelyn was faced by several challenges, including dealing with the <b>threat</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> kings of England, and maintaining his authority over the native Welsh.|$|E

5|$|Marlborough College itself {{experienced}} some <b>threat</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> war. The Ministry of Aircraft Production had also relocated there, and in 1942, bombs fell nearby. By 1944, {{with the war}} settling down, the City of London School returned to its home on the Victoria Embankment, which had suffered no structural damage during the Blitz. Air raid shelters were built on site as a precautionary measure.|$|E
5|$|Much of the {{structural}} material was long ago carried off for reuse in buildings in Cley and Blakeney. The surviving ruins are protected as a scheduled monument and Grade II listed building because of their historical importance, {{but there is no}} active management. The ever-present <b>threat</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> encroaching sea is likely to accelerate following a realignment of the Glaven's course through the marshes, and lead to the loss of the ruins.|$|E
5|$|Red {{explains}} {{that she was}} delivering goodies for her grandmother when she discovered a <b>threat</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> mysterious Goodie Bandit.

5|$|A {{number of}} Maratha gunners who had feigned death when the British {{advanced}} over their position re-manned their guns {{and began to}} pour cannon fire into {{the rear of the}} 74th and Madras infantry. Wellesley ordered his four sepoy battalions to re-form and ward off any <b>threat</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Maratha infantry and cavalry while the 78th were sent back to retake the Maratha gun line. Wellesley, meanwhile, galloped back to 7th Madras Native Cavalry, which had been held back in reserve to the east, and led a cavalry charge from the opposite direction. The gunners again stood their ground but were eventually driven from their guns and this time it was ensured that all those who remained were dead.|$|E
5|$|At {{some point}} {{following}} {{the fall of}} the Western Roman Empire, a retrenchment was built within the city, reducing it to its present size. This was done to make the city's perimeter more easily defensible, and similar reductions in city sizes were common around the Mediterranean region in the early Middle Ages. Although it was traditionally assumed that the retrenchment was built by the Arabs, {{it has been suggested that}} it was actually built by the Byzantine Empire in around the 8th century, when the <b>threat</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Arabs increased.|$|E
5|$|Authorities in El Salvador {{declared}} a national state of alert {{in response to}} the potential <b>threat</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> hurricane. Residents in flood-prone areas were warned of potential flash flooding. As the hurricane turned sharply to the northwest, there are no reports of damage or deaths from Pauline in the country. Officials in Puerto Madero closed port facilities to all ships, excluding ships in open seas seeking shelter. The government ultimately closed six major ports between Acapulco and Puerto Madero. State authorities in Oaxaca opened 75emergency shelters and prepared 50schools to house 10,000people.|$|E

5|$|Both sides claimed victory {{after the}} battle, with the JNA hailing the {{evacuation}} of the garrison as its greatest success. However, they achieved only part of their objectives; the JNA failed to secure the area surrounding the barracks or remove all the weapons and equipment in it, and the planned coordinated advance against Turanj also failed. Croatian forces failed in their primary objective: containing the garrison. Nonetheless, the JNA <b>threat</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Logorište barracks was removed (freeing up forces assigned to the blockade of the barracks) {{and a large number}} of weapons were captured.|$|E
5|$|By {{the start}} of the 20th century it was clear that Gibraltar could be bombarded with {{relative}} impunity from the Spanish mainland. Proposals were put forward to build a new harbour {{on the east side of}} the Rock, where ships would be less vulnerable to direct artillery fire from the mainland, but were abandoned due to the vast expense and only marginal gains in security. A new round of tunnelling was carried out to provide more bombproof accommodation for the garrison, along with deep shelters and casemates capable of accommodating 2,000 men. Ultimately it was decided in 1906 that Gibraltar faced no credible threat from land and that the defences would be organised to deal with a <b>threat</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> sea.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{characteristically}} intermittent eruptions {{of active}} volcanoes such as Lassen Peak, {{there is some}} <b>threat</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> volcanoes of the LVNP. Dacitic explosive eruptions have taken place within the last 50,000 years at Lassen Peak, Chaos Crags, and Sunflower Flat, and effusive eruptions of basalt have occurred at Tumble Buttes, Hat Mountain, and Prospect Peak. Pyroclastic flows and lahars could easily occur near glaciated areas and in river valleys like Hat Creek Valley. In addition to the volcanic hazards that could possibly occur, one volcano did erupt in the 20th century in LVNP: (Lassen Peak). Lassen's eruptions (1914-21, though most activity occurred between 1914-17) were very small compared to the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens.|$|E
50|$|Israel {{wanted to}} keep {{military}} control over Palestinian land and airspace in states of emergency, not because of a possible future <b>threat</b> <b>from</b> Palestine, but because of possible other <b>threats</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> East.

5|$|Governor Rick Perry {{activated}} the National Guard and mobilized emergency personnel {{to the region}} expected {{to be affected by}} the storm. Erin was expected to bring flooding to the region, which had already been declared a disaster area on August 7, 2007 due to widespread flooding on the Nueces River basin; this area remained flooded as of August 15, 2007. On August 15, oil futures rose to $74.01 (USD), due to fears of Erin disrupting oil supplies produced on Texan coasts, combined with low oil inventories. As a result of the <b>threat</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> storm, Shell Oil Company evacuated 188workers on oil platforms in the northwestern Gulf of Mexico.|$|E
5|$|Llywelyn the Great {{initially}} {{controlled the}} princedom of Gwynedd, but grew more powerful {{over the course}} of his reign, extending his influence over much of Wales during the early years of the 13th century. Llywelyn was faced by several challenges, including dealing with the <b>threat</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> kings of England, and maintaining his authority over the native Welsh. As part of this strategy, Llywelyn built Castell y Bere, an innovative stone Welsh castle, in the 1220s. Shortly afterwards he began the first phases of Dolbadarn Castle, constructing the initial stone fortifications on the site, including two square stone towers.|$|E
5|$|Members of the Republican Army who {{had come}} from Indonesian Hizbullah felt betrayed by the Indonesian Government. In May 1948, they {{declared}} a break-away regime, the Negara Islam Indonesia (Indonesian Islamic State), better known as Darul Islam. Led by an Islamic mystic, Sekarmadji Maridjan Kartosuwirjo, Darul Islam sought to establish Indonesia as an Islamic theocracy. At the time, the Republican Government did not respond, as they were focused on the <b>threat</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Dutch. Some leaders of Masjumi sympathised with the rebellion. After the Republic regained all territories in 1950, the government took the Darul Islam threat seriously, especially after some provinces declared that they had joined Darul Islam. The rebellion was put down in 1962.|$|E
