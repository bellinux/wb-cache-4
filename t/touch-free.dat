40|$|We {{investigate}} the responsiveness of a <b>touch-free</b> multi-user human-computer interface {{we have developed}} for a wallsized, high-resolution 28 -tiled display. We adapted Quake 3 Arena (Q 3 A) and Homeworld to use the interface, and parallelized them to run with high framerates on the display wall. The interface comprises 16 cameras and 9 computers, using triangulation to detect object positions. The games use the positions to identify hand and arm movements, mapping them to keyboard and mouse events. The display wall {{can be used by}} one or several simultaneous players. To parallelize Q 3 A, we exploit its existing client-server architecture and spectator-functionality. Each tile runs a spectator, which displays its corresponding part of a given player’s view. To parallelize Homeworld, we run a copy on each tile, and synchronize the rendering of each new frame. Each copy receives the same input and shares a global clock. The intrinsic latency of the <b>touch-free</b> interface averages 140 ms, with about 100 ms from the cameras. We expect improvements in camera technology to reduce this. The time to detect the simple gestures is insignificant. The framerate for parallel Q 3 A was 398, vs. 21 when using Chromium to distribute Q 3 A’s graphics output. Homeworld did not run using Chromium, but the parallel version achieved a framerate that was always above 80. The framerates achieved by the parallel games were well above the refresh rate of the projectors used.

The authors present a low-cost prototype of a system, which allows for <b>touch-free</b> control of a medical image viewer. This <b>touch-free</b> navigation system consists of a computer system (IMac, OS X 10. 6 Apple, USA) with a medical image viewer (OsiriX, OsiriX foundation, Switzerland) and a depth camera (Kinect, Microsoft, USA). They implemented software that translates the data delivered by the camera and a voice recognition software into keyboard and mouse commands, which are then passed to OsiriX. In this feasibility study, the authors introduced 10 medical professionals to the system {{and asked them to}} re-create 12 images from a CT data set. They evaluated response times and usability of the system compared with standard mouse/keyboard control. Users felt comfortable with the system after approximately 10 minutes.

40|$|Abstract For the {{investigation}} of flow structures in bubble columns {{it is necessary to}} measure the local liquid velocity. Common optical methods fail in a bubble flow with a large void fraction. The cause is the different refraction index of liquid phase and gaseous phase, which leads to reflection and dispersion. The new X-ray based Particle Tracking Velocimetry (PTV) - called “XPTV ”- presented here permits to obtain the liquid velocity three-dimensionally, <b>touch-free</b> and for any large void fraction. The problem of light reflection and light refraction on phase boundaries is solved by the use of X-rays instead of light. X-rays penetrate a gas/liquid flow in straight lines. The method can also be applied to opaque liquids, where optical methods fail. ...|$|E

40|$|Physiological noise {{originating}} in cardiovascular and respiratory processes {{is a substantial}} confound in BOLD fMRI.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to clarify whether {{administration}} of antipsychotic perphenazine contributes to the electrophysiological changes of the isolated heart. Fourteen adult male Wistar rats were divided into two groups. Langendorff hearts were perfused with Krebs-Henseleit solution at constant pressure (85 mmHg) and 37 °C (CaCl 2, 1. 2 mM). The electrogram was recorded by <b>touch-free</b> method. The hearts of the first group were exposed to 3. 10 - 5 M perphenazine, the hearts of the second group to 3. 10 - 8 M perphenazine. The incidence of arrhythmias and the heart rate and QT interval changes were studied on electrogram during 30 min periods of control, the first perphenazine administration, washout, and the second drug administration. Perphenazine administration significantly prolonged QT (p < 0. 001) and QTc (p < 0. 05) in group 1. In group 2, QT and QTc prolongation was less pronounced (p < 0. 05). A number of arrhythmias appeared, from single premature ventricular complexes to more severe ones in both groups. The heart rate changes were non-significant.

40|$|Recently, {{amorphous}} InGaZnO ultraviolet photo thin-film transistors have exhibited {{great potential}} for application in future display technologies. Nevertheless, the transmittance of amorphous InGaZnO (~ 80 %) is still not high enough, resulting in the relatively large sacrifice of aperture ratio for each sensor pixel. In this work, the ultraviolet photo thin-film transistor based on amorphous InGaMgO, which processes a larger bandgap and higher transmission compared to amorphous InGaZnO, was proposed and investigated. Furthermore, the effects of post-deposition annealing in oxygen on both the material and ultraviolet detection characteristics of amorphous InGaMgO were also comprehensively studied. It was found that oxygen post-deposition annealing can effectively reduce oxygen vacancies, leading to an optimized device performance, including lower dark current, higher sensitivity, and larger responsivity. We attributed it to the combined effect of the reduction in donor states and recombination centers, {{both of which are}} related to oxygen vacancies. As a result, the 240 -min annealed device exhibited the lowest dark current of 1. 7 × 10 − 10 A, the highest photosensitivity of 3. 9 × 106, and the largest responsivity of 1. 5 × 104 A/W. Therefore, our findings have revealed that amorphous InGaMgO photo thin-film transistors are a very promising alternative for UV detection, especially for application in <b>touch-free</b> interactive displays...|$|E
40|$|This chapter {{presents}} a vision-based system for <b>touch-free</b> interaction with a display at a distance. A single camera is fixed {{on top of}} the screen and is pointing towards the user. An attention mechanism allows the user to start the interaction and control a screen pointer by moving their hand in a fist pose directed at the camera. On-screen items can be chosen by a selection mechanism. Current sample applications include browsing video collections as well as viewing a gallery of 3 D objects, which the user can rotate with their hand motion. We have included an up-to-date review of hand tracking methods, and comment on the merits and shortcomings of previous approaches. The proposed tracker uses multiple cues, appearance, color, and motion, for robustness. As the space of possible observation models is generally too large for exhaustive online search, we select models that are suitable for the particular tracking task at hand. During a training stage, various off-the-shelf trackers are evaluated. From this data different methods of fusing them online are investigated, including parallel and cascaded tracker evaluation. For the case of fist tracking, combining a small number of observers in a cascade results in an efficient algorithm that is used in our gesture interface.

40|$|Poster project {{completed}} at Wichita State University, Department of Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering. Presented at the 13 th Annual Capitol Graduate Research Summit, Topeka, KS, February 2, 2016. The Leap Motion is a recently developed, <b>touch-free</b> gesture device {{that allows for}} natural interaction between a computer and a user. Currently, many research projects have explored the usability of Leap Motion compared to traditional-style mice (among other devices) using a standard Fitts' tapping test. However, these studies only offer a basic Fitts' analysis on throughput, movement time, and errors. The {{purpose of the current}} study was to conduct an exhaustive usability assessment of the Leap Motion, compared to a baseline traditional mouse, for point-and-click tasks using a basic Fitts' analysis, as well as the MacKenzie, Kauppinen, and Silfverberg's (2001) seven movement accuracy measures. Results suggest that Leap Motion is a viable device for point-and-click tasks, but generally inferior to the more familiar baseline device on standard Fitts' assessment measures. However, for specific cursor events, users with Leap Motion reentered targets less often and the two devices showed no differences on continuous navigation paths between on-screen targets. Based on the results, this study suggests that the Leap Motion is best used with targets in the upper 2 / 3 of a computer screen and with target sizes larger than typical computer icons. Since this study was conducted with a highly controlled and basic point-and-click task, further research must be conducted to better understand the advantages and limitations of this device...|$|E
40|$|Optical {{trapping}} of light-absorbing {{particles in}} a gaseous environment {{is governed by}} a laser-induced photophoretic force, which can be orders of magnitude stronger than the force of radiation pressure induced by the same light intensity. In spite of many experimental studies, the exact theoretical background underlying the photophoretic force and the prediction of its influence on the particle motion {{is still in its}} infancy. Here, we report the results of a quantitative analysis of the photophoretic force and the stiffness of trapping achieved by levitating graphite and graphite-coated glass shells of calibrated sizes in an upright diverging hollow-core vortex beam, which we refer to as an “optical funnel”. The measurements of forces are conducted in air at various gas pressures in the range from 5 mbar to 2 bar. The results of these measurements lay the foundation for mapping the optically induced force to the intensity distribution in the trap. The mapping, in turn, provides the necessary information to model flight trajectories of particles of various sizes entering the beam at given initial speed and position relative to the beam axis. Finally, we determine the limits of the parameter space for the particle speed, size, and radial offset to the beam axis, all linked to the laser power and the particular laser-beam structure. These results establish the grounds for developing a <b>touch-free</b> optical system for precisely positioning submicrometer bioparticles at the focal spot of an x-ray free-electron laser, which will significantly enhance the efficiency of studying nanoscale morphology of proteins and biomolecules in femtosecond coherent diffractive imaging experiments...|$|E
40|$|Background Despite {{best efforts}} by {{healthcare}} providers to sterilise their hands through hand washing prior to touching medical equipment and patients, bacteria are still present {{and can be}} spread through physical contact. We aimed to reduce the spread of touch-induced and airborne bacteria and virus spreading by using a <b>touch-free</b> glove-dispensing system that minimally exposes gloves in the box to air. Method The team met multiple times to undertake early prototyping and present ideas for the design. We experimented with folding gloves in varying patterns, similar to facial tissue-dispensing boxes, and tried several methods of opening/closing the glove box to determine {{the most effective way}} to access gloves with the least amount of physical contact. We considered the user experience and obtained user feedback after each design iteration. Results Ultimately, we decided on a vertically oriented box with optional holes for dispensing a glove on the side of the box or on the bottom by means of the pull-down drawer mechanism. This system will dispense a single glove at a time to the user with the option of using a pull-down drawer trigger to decrease the likelihood of physical contact with unused gloves. Both methods dispense a single glove. Conclusion: By reducing physical contact between the healthcare practitioner and the gloves, we are potentially reducing the spread of bacteria. This glove box design ensures that gloves are not exposed to the air in the clinic or hospital setting, thereby further reducing spread of airborne germs. This could assist in decreasing the risk of nosocomial infections in healthcare settings...|$|E
40|$|Adiposis dolorosa (AD) {{is a rare}} {{disorder}} of painful nodular subcutaneous fat accompanied by fatigue, difficulty with weight loss, inflammation, increased fluid in adipose tissue (lipedema and lymphedema), and hyperalgesia. Sequential compression relieves lymphedema pain; we therefore hypothesized that whole body cyclic pneumatic hypobaric compression may relieve pain in AD. To avoid exacerbating hyperalgesia, we utilized a <b>touch-free</b> method, which is delivered via a high-performance altitude simulator, the Cyclic Variations in Altitude Conditioning™ (CVAC™) process. As a pilot study, 10 participants with AD completed pain {{and quality of life}} questionnaires before and after 20 – 40 minutes of CVAC process daily for 5 days. Participants lost weight (195. 5 ± 17. 6 – 193. 8 ± 17. 3 lb; P = 0. 03), and bioimpedance significantly decreased (510 ± 36 – 490 ± 38 ohm; P = 0. 01). There was a significant decrease in scores on the Pain Catastrophizing Scale (P = 0. 039), in average (P = 0. 002), highest (P = 0. 029), lowest (P = 0. 04), and current pain severity (P = 0. 02) on the Visual Analogue Scale, but there was no change in pain quality by the McGill Pain Questionnaire. There were no significant changes in total and physical SF- 36 scores, but the mental score improved significantly (P = 0. 049). There were no changes in the Pain Disability Index or Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. These data present a potential, new, noninvasive means of treating pain in AD by whole body pneumatic compression as part of the CVAC process. Although randomized, controlled trials are needed to confirm these data, the CVAC process could potentially help in treating AD pain and other chronic pain disorders...|$|E
40|$|The {{small size}} and {{heterogeneity}} {{of the pores}} in bacterial nanocellulose (BNC) hydrogels limit the ingrowth of cells and their use as tissue-engineered implant materials. The use of placeholders during BNC biosynthesis or post-processing steps such as (<b>touch-free)</b> laser perforation can overcome this limitation. Since three-dimensionally arranged channels may be required for homogeneous and functional seeding, three-dimensional (3 -D) laser perforation of never-dried BNC hydrogels was performed. Never-dried BNC hydrogels were produced in different shapes by: (i) the cultivation of Gluconacetobacter xylinus (DSM 14666; synonym Komagataeibacter xylinus) in nutrient medium; (ii) the removal of bacterial residues/media components (0. 1 M NaOH; 30 min; 100 °C) and repeated washing (deionized water; pH 5. 8); (iii) the unidirectional or 3 -D laser perforation and cutting (pulsed CO 2 Rofin SC × 10 laser; 220 μm channel diameter); and (iv) the final autoclaving (2 M NaOH; 121 °C; 20 min) and washing (pyrogen-free water). In comparison to unmodified BNC, unidirectionally perforated – and particularly 3 -D-perforated – BNC allowed ingrowth into and movement of vital bovine/human chondrocytes throughout the BNC nanofiber network. Laser perforation caused limited structural modifications (i. e. fiber or globular aggregates), but no chemical modifications, as indicated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron scattering and viability tests. Pre-cultured human chondrocytes seeding the surface/channels of laser-perforated BNC expressed cartilage-specific matrix products, indicating chondrocyte differentiation. 3 -D-perforated BNC showed compressive strength {{comparable to that of}} unmodified samples. Unidirectionally or 3 -D-perforated BNC shows high biocompatibility and provides short diffusion distances for nutrients and extracellular matrix components. Also, the resulting channels support migration into the BNC, matrix production and phenotypic stabilization of chondrocytes. It may thus be suitable for in vivo application, e. g. as a cartilage replacement material...|$|E
40|$|About the book] Given {{that touch}} and {{touching}} is {{so central to}} everyday embodied existence, why has it been largely ignored by social scientists for so long? What is the place of touch in our mixed spaces of sociality, work, domesticity, recreation, creativity or care? What conceptual resources and academic languages can we reach towards when approaching tactile activities and somatic experiences through the body? How is this tactile landscape gendered? How is touch becoming revisited and revalidated in late capitalism through animal encounters, tourism, massage, beauty treatments, professional medicine, everyday spiritualities or the aseptic <b>touch-free</b> spaces of automated toilets? How is touch placed and valued within scholarly fieldwork and research itself, integral {{as it is to}} the production of embodied epistemologies? How is touch involved in such aesthetic experiences as shaping objects in sand, or encountering fleshly bodies within a painting? The goal of this edited collection, Touching Space, Placing Touch is twofold: • To further advance theoretical and empirical understanding of touch in social science scholarship by focussing on the differential social and cultural meanings of touching and the places of touch. • To develop a multi-faceted and interdisciplinary explanations of touch in terms of individual and social life, personal experiences and tasks, and their related cultural contexts. The twelve essays in this volume provide a rich combination of theoretical resources, methodological approaches and empirical investigation. Each chapter takes a distinct aspect of touch within a particular spatial context, exploring this through a mixture of sustained empirical work, critical theories of embodiment, philosophical and psychoanalytic approaches to gendered touch and touching, or the relationship between visual and non-visual culture, to articulate something of the variety and variability of touching experiences. The contributors are a mixture of established and emerging researchers within a growing interdisciplinary field of scholarship, yet the volume has a strong thematic identity and therefore represents the formative collection concerning the multiple senses of touch within social science scholarship at this time...|$|E
40|$|Main {{result of}} subproject DubNanoAVT is {{the proof of}} concept of touchfree and {{nondestructive}} manipulation of microscale objects such as metallic nanowires and particles (e. g. quantum dots) using the developed combination of dielectrophoreses and standing ultrasonic waves. Furthermore, these manipulated objects can be ordered and assembled {{to each other and}} alter that assembled onto a custom-built, e. g. by printing technologies, prepared substrate. Within the subproject NanoMag basic principles of generating sufficiently strong magnetic fields with a geometric resolution in the sub-micron range combined with concerted patterns/structures of magnetic addressable marking of microlectronic components were developed. Furthermore, materials and processes of marking of microlectronic components with magnetic addressable structures were developed that allow a marking of necessary geometric resolution and the Integration into the chip production process line. The developed concept of a <b>touch-free</b> manipulation of marked components can be easily integrated into established processes of fabrication of printed circuit boards and components. Within the subproject NanoMoist was shown that moisture absorption as well as diffusion can be reduced by admixture of small amounts up to 5 % of nanosize layered silicate filler particles (bentonites) into epoxy resins. Furthermore, in was shown by basic investigations that nanosize bentonites and microsize SiO 2 -standard fillers can easily be mixed and give epoxy composites with good processability and enhanced moisture resistance. Moisture absorption and diffusion were measured by different established methods as well as a new 'diffusion-into-GlobTop' procedure that simulates the real situation of a microelectronic encapsulation. All experiments of moisture diffusion were analyzed by diffusion theories and additional numerical simulations were performed to elucidate the effect of nanoparticles in the epoxy matrix. A strong dependence of the viscosity on the amount of added bentonite or SiO 2 -nanoparticles was found by measuring several material properties important for processability as well as reliability of the packages. A decreased reaction shrinkage caused by admixture of bentonites was also found as an useful effect...|$|E
