25|$|In {{most cases}} of {{anterograde}} amnesia, patients lose declarative memory, or the recollection of facts, but they retain nondeclarative memory, often called procedural memory. For instance, {{they are able}} to remember and in some cases learn how to do things such as talking on the phone or riding a bicycle, but they may not remember what they had eaten earlier that day for lunch. One extensively studied anterograde amnesiac patient, codenamed H.M., demonstrated that despite his amnesia preventing him from learning new declarative information, procedural memory consolidation was still possible, albeit severely reduced in power. He, along with other patients with anterograde amnesia, were given the same maze to complete day after day. Despite having no memory of having completed the maze the day before, unconscious practice of completing the same maze over and over reduced the amount of time needed to complete it in subsequent trials. From these results, Corkin et al. concluded despite having no declarative memory (i.e. no conscious memory of completing the maze exists), the patients still had a working procedural memory (learning done unconsciously through practice). This supports the notion that declarative and procedural memory are consolidated in different areas of the brain. In addition, patients have a diminished ability to remember the <b>temporal</b> <b>context</b> in which objects were presented. Certain authors claim the deficit in <b>temporal</b> <b>context</b> memory is more significant than the deficit in semantic learning ability (described below).|$|E
500|$|Another criticism, by Kline and Dale from Oak Ridge National Laboratory, {{held that}} Searchinger et al. and Fargione et al. [...] "... {{do not provide}} {{adequate}} support for their claim that bioufuels cause high emissions due to land-use change", as their conclusions depends on a misleading assumption because more comprehensive field research found that these land use changes [...] "... are driven by interactions among cultural, technological, biophysical, economic, and demographic forces within a spatial and <b>temporal</b> <b>context</b> rather than by a single crop market". Fargione et al. responded in part that although many factors contributed to land clearing, this [...] "observation does not diminish the fact that biofuels also contribute to land clearing if they are produced on existing cropland or on newly cleared lands". Searching disagreed with all of Kline and Dale arguments.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT- Though the {{time-delay}} neural net architecture {{has been}} recently {{used in a}} number of speech recognition applications, it has the problem that it can not use longer <b>temporal</b> <b>contexts</b> because this increases the number of connection weights in the network. This is a serious bottleneck because the use of larger <b>temporal</b> <b>contexts</b> can improve the recognition performance. In this paper, a time-derivarive neural net architecture is proposed. This architecture has the advantage that it can utilize information about longer <b>temporal</b> <b>contexts</b> without increasing the number of connection weights in the network. This architecture is studied here for speaker-independent isolated-word recognition and its performance is compared with that of the time-delay neural net architecture. It is shown that the time-derivative neural net architecture, in spite of using less number of connection weights, outperforms the time-delay neural net architecture for speech recognition. 1...|$|R
40|$|We {{introduce}} a temporal model for reasoning on disjunctive metric constraints on intervals and time points in <b>temporal</b> <b>contexts.</b> This <b>temporal</b> model {{is composed of}} a labeled temporal algebra and its reasoning algorithms. The labeled temporal algebra defines labeled disjunctive metric pointbased constraints, where each disjunct in each input disjunctive constraint is univocally associated to a label. Reasoning algorithms manage labeled constraints, associated label lists, and sets of mutually inconsistent disjuncts. These algorithms guarantee consistency and obtain a minimal network. Additionally, constraints can be organized in a hierarchy of alternative <b>temporal</b> <b>contexts.</b> Therefore, we can reason on context-dependent disjunctive metric constraints on intervals and points. Moreover, the model is able to represent non-binary constraints, such that logical dependencies on disjuncts in constraints can be handled. The computational cost of reasoning algorithms is exponential in a [...] ...|$|R

2500|$|In Nelega's view, Gârbea, [...] "one of {{the truly}} alive writers of his time", was among the few debuting local playwrights to have their works staged by {{prominent}} Romanian directors—Alexandru Darie, Alexandru Hausvater and Gavril Pinte. Gârbea's fellow România Literară contributor, literary historian Alex. Ştefănescu, contrasted his writings with the [...] "boring" [...] works by some of his contemporaries, and claimed that [...] "directors and actors take pleasure in staging [...]" [...] Gârbea's work stands out within its cultural and <b>temporal</b> <b>context</b> for its size and diversity. Aretzu sees him as [...] "one of the most ubiquitous authors in present-day literature, [...] gifted with a great availability in processing reality", while critic and academic Nicolae Oprea believes him to be [...] "the most prolific" [...] among the Bucharest-based group formed in the 1990s. Literary reviewer Daniel Cristea-Enache also describes his colleague as [...] "multilateral" [...] who [...] "can adapt himself with great ease to any particular genre's specificity". Writing in 2007, Ştefănescu defined him a [...] "one-man orchestra [...] of the apathetic (and sometimes shy-brazen) Romanian literature of today." [...] According to Moldovan writer Emilian Galaicu-Păun: [...] "As productive as an entire literary school , Horia Gârbea is a veritable Stakhanovite of writing, who has dealt in all genres and species". Gârbea is also among the post-1990 Romanian authors to have received recognition abroad. In addition to the performances of The Serpent and Il émmagement, Gârbea's Raţă cu portocale has been translated into German by Veronika Dreichlinger (Ente mit Apfelsine, published in 2005). His work was also included into English-, French-, German-, Russian- and Serbian-language anthologies.|$|E

40|$|Current {{theories}} of interval timing assume that humans {{and other animals}} time as if using a single, absolute stopwatch that can be stopped or reset on command. Here we evaluate the alternative view that psychological time is represented by multiple clocks, and that these clocks create separate <b>temporal</b> <b>contexts</b> by which duration is judged in a relative manner. Two predictions of the multiple-clock hypothesis were tested. First, that the multiple clocks can be manipulated (stopped and/or reset) independently. Second, that an event of a given physical duration would be perceived as having different durations in different <b>temporal</b> <b>contexts,</b> i. e., would be judged differently by each clock. Rats were trained to time three durations (e. g., 10, 30, and 90 s). When timing was interrupted by an unexpected gap in the signal, rats reset the clock used to time the "short" duration, stopped the "medium" duration clock, and continued to run the "long" duration clock. When {{the duration of the}} gap was manipulated, the rats reset these clocks in a hierarchical order, first the "short", then the "medium", and finally the "long" clock. Quantitative modeling assuming re-allocation of cognitive resources in proportion to the relative duration of the gap to the multiple, simultaneously timed event durations was used to account for the results. These results indicate that the three event durations were effectively timed by separate clocks operated independently, and that the same gap duration was judged relative to these three <b>temporal</b> <b>contexts.</b> Results suggest that the brain processes the duration of an event {{in a manner similar to}} Einstein's special relativity theory: A given time interval is registered differently by independent clocks dependent upon the context...|$|R

50|$|The {{contiguity}} effect appears relatively constant, and {{has been}} predicted to have long-term effects according to the <b>temporal</b> <b>context</b> model proposed by Howard and Kahana. This model explains the contiguity effect in the following manner: when an item is presented, it activates the <b>temporal</b> <b>context</b> that was active when the item was originally studied. Since contexts of neighboring items overlap, and that overlap increases with decreasing lag between items, a contiguity effect results. The contiguity effect has even been found between items in different lists, {{although it has been}} speculated that these items could simply be intrusions.|$|E

40|$|Abstract There {{has been}} an {{increased}} interest in temporal reasoning from areas such as database systems and AI. In this {{paper we propose a}} temporal reasoning framework that bridges the paradigms of Constraint Logic Programming (CLP) and Contextual Logic Programming (CxLP). CLP is used to build a rather simple, yet powerful temporal algebra with points, intervals, durations and relations between these elements. To associate the time given by the algebraic system above and events or propositions, we build a framework that makes use of recent developments in CxLP and propose the notion of <b>temporal</b> <b>contexts.</b> ...|$|R

50|$|One theorised {{reason for}} the recency effect is that these items are still present in working memory when recall is solicited. Items that benefit from neither (the middle items) are {{recalled}} most poorly. An additional explanation for the recency effect is related to temporal context: if tested immediately after rehearsal, the current <b>temporal</b> <b>context</b> {{can serve as a}} retrieval cue, which would predict more recent items to have a higher likelihood of recall than items that were studied in a different <b>temporal</b> <b>context</b> (earlier in the list). The recency effect is reduced when an interfering task is given. Intervening tasks involve working memory, as the distractor activity, if exceeding 15 to 30 seconds in duration, can cancel out the recency effect. Additionally, if recall comes immediately after test, the recency effect is consistent regardless of the length of the studied list, or presentation rate.|$|E
50|$|In a recency {{judgment}} task {{study conducted}} by Gras-Vincendon et al., evidence suggested that <b>temporal</b> <b>context</b> memory is not impaired in individuals with HFA.

The researchers proposed that the supposedly impaired temporal order memory for verbal information found in Bennetto’s work is actually due to difficulty with general complex verbal stimuli.|$|E
30|$|The model {{suggests}} {{spatial and}} temporal dynamics {{to the definition of}} severity. It implies that the detected character of severity, as well as the potential performance of remote sensing, also varies along the continuum.
