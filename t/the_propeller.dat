5|$|The {{aircraft}} {{was capable of}} performing dive bombing, and could be fitted with a single bomb or depth charge on a hardpoint under each wing for the mission, or for anti-submarine warfare.

5|$|The {{final cost}} of the first 310 aircraft, after delays and {{increased}} programme costs, came to £1,870,242 or £1,533 more per aircraft than originally estimated. Production aircraft cost about £9,500. The most expensive components were the hand-fabricated and finished fuselage at approximately £2,500, then the Rolls-Royce Merlin engine at £2,000, followed by the wings at £1,800 a pair, guns and undercarriage, both at £800 each, and <b>the</b> <b>propeller</b> at £350.|$|E
5|$|The {{propellers}} {{themselves were}} also found to be poorly manufactured, having been shaped by hand, {{with at least one}} cast at the wrong pitch. This was rectified by using a five-axis milling machine for future shaping work and replacing the miscast propeller. The material used for the propellers was also found to be weaker than expected, developing fatigue cracks after only a few years of use. Instead of going to Kockums, which had started to go into decline {{after the end of the}} Cold War, the submarine project office sent <b>the</b> <b>propeller</b> to the United States Navy for redesigning. Despite the Americans fixing the problems with <b>the</b> <b>propeller</b> design, resulting in significant performance improvements, the Swedish company was dissatisfied with the Australian actions; the dispatch of the propellers was one of the points of contention in the company's legal action in the mid-2000s against the Australian government over ownership of the intellectual property rights to the submarine's design.|$|E
5|$|When sailing {{the western}} side of Spitzbergen, a blade of <b>the</b> <b>propeller</b> of the Island was damaged in a {{collision}} with an ice floe. When the engine was run, severe vibration was felt and this forced Worsley to continue northwards under sail, searching for Gillis Land until the ship reached the pack ice. While doing so, soundings were taken which confirmed the presence of a submarine plain between Spitzbergen and the island group of Franz Josef Land. Turning south and sailing along the northern coast of Spitzbergen, a previously uncharted harbour was found, which Algarsson named after Worsley. The ship then sailed north, still seeking Gillis Land, but became trapped in the ice. Worsley took the opportunity to create an ice dock to facilitate repairs to the rudder, which had become damaged. After two weeks beset in the ice, he used the engine to break free but the last blade of <b>the</b> <b>propeller</b> was lost in the process.|$|E

40|$|The {{results of}} an {{investigation}} of a 1 / 3 -scale model of the Chance Vought XF 5 U- 1 airplane in the Langley full-scale tunnel are presented in this report.

The results with <b>the</b> <b>propellers</b> removed showed that the maximum lift coefficient of the complete model configuration was only 0. 97 was compared with the value of 1. 31 for the model configuration in which the engine-air ducts and canopy are removed. The model with <b>the</b> <b>propellers</b> removed (normal center-of-gravity position) has a positive static margin, stick fixed, varying from 5 to 13 percent of the mean aerodynamic chord throughout the unstalled range of lift coefficients. The unit horizontal tail is sufficiently powerful to trim the airplane with <b>the</b> <b>propellers</b> removed throughout <b>the</b> unstalled range of lift coefficients. The peak propulsive efficiencies for beta = 20 degrees and beta = 30 degrees were increased 7 percent at C(sub L) congruent to 0. 67 and 20 percent at C(sub L) congruent to 0. 74, respectively, with <b>the</b> <b>propellers</b> rotating upward in the center than with <b>the</b> <b>propellers</b> rotating downward in the center. Indications are that the minimum forward-flight speed of the airplane for full-power operation at sea level will be about 90 miles per hour. Decreasing the weight and increasing the power reduced this value of minimum speed and there were no indications from the results of a lower limit to the minimum speed...|$|R

5|$|While the {{wreckage}} was being examined, investigators {{found that all}} four engines were producing thrust {{at the time of}} impact. There were only two ways that <b>the</b> <b>propeller</b> could be reversed during the take-off sequence. Investigators ruled out electrical malfunction since, after detailed examination of the engine hub, there was no evidence found of this happening. Therefore, it was concluded that the only way <b>the</b> <b>propeller</b> could have been reversed was through an unintentional crew action. Although there was no formal evidence that a simulated engine failure was being performed, statements submitted by witnesses suggested that it was likely this was the case.

5|$|A 1926 {{graduate}} of the United States Naval Academy, Mumma served {{on a number of}} warships. He studied marine engineering at the L'École Nationale Supérieure de Maritime in Paris, where he learned the latest techniques of maritime construction.

In January 1943, he took over <b>the</b> <b>Propeller</b> desk at the Bureau of Ships.

5|$|A {{subsequent}} {{investigation found}} a {{simulated engine failure}} procedure was being conducted, which involved {{a member of the}} crew pulling back the throttle lever for engine No. 4 prior to taking off. Investigators found that if the throttle lever was pulled back too far, it would cause <b>the</b> <b>propeller</b> to reversea feature designed to slow the aircraft upon landing. Once the landing gear was raised, the crew would have to raise a metal flag in the cockpit to bring <b>the</b> <b>propeller</b> blades back into the correct position, since a safety device prevented electric power from operating the rotating mechanism at the roots of the blades unless the aircraft was on the ground or the flag was manually raised. The Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) concluded one of the flight crew applied full power to No. 4 engine, thinking this would bring the aircraft out of the increasing bank. Because the blades were reversed and the flag was not raised, that increased the reverse thrust from No. 4 engine, causing the DC-6 to spiral out of control. Since the plane was so close to the ground, the suddenness of the bank and dive meant the flight crew had no chance to recover the aircraft before impact.|$|E

5|$|By World War I, all of {{the major}} powers were experimenting with {{aircraft}} mounted cannon; however their low rate of fire and great size and weight precluded any of them from being anything other than experimental.

40|$|AbstractIn this article, {{the flow}} field around an airship with {{propellers}} blowing is calculated {{on the basis}} of the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations with SST turbulent models. Modeled each as an actuator disk, <b>the</b> <b>propellers</b> are arranged at different positions around the body of airship in the flow direction. The numerical results show that <b>the</b> blowing <b>propellers</b> produce open outer flows. They drive the separated vortexes off the body thus reducing the drag coefficients. The results also show that the position after leading sucking peak is the best place for a propeller to blow. When <b>the</b> <b>propellers</b> are positioned after sucking peak, the longer the area which <b>the</b> <b>propellers</b> work on, <b>the</b> more the profile drag coefficients can be reduced. If the working position of <b>propeller</b> moves from <b>the</b> sucking peak forward to the leading edge, the friction drag coefficient will increase. The bigger the diameter of <b>the</b> <b>propellers</b> and <b>the</b> stronger the pressure jump, the more the drag coefficient will be reduced. The results also reveal that for the design of circularly-positioned propellers with space intervals, the more drag coefficient reduction results, the smaller the space interval is specified...|$|R

40|$|Results of a psychoacoustic test {{performed}} {{to understand the}} relative annoyance to noise produced by several configurations of a distributed electric propulsion high lift system are given.

This is an intuitive result as annoyance increases, in general, with frequency, and, the blade passage frequency of <b>the</b> <b>propellers</b> increases with <b>the</b> number of <b>propellers.</b> Additionally, <b>the</b> data indicate that having some variation in the blade passage frequency from propeller-to-propeller is beneficial as it reduces the high tonality generated when all <b>the</b> <b>propellers</b> are spinning in synchrony at the same speed. <b>The</b> <b>propellers</b> can be set to spin at different speeds, but it was found that allowing the motor controllers to drift within 1 % of nominal settings produced the best results (lowest overall annoyance).
