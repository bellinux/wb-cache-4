Sexologist Gloria Brame wrote in her book The Truth about Sex, a Sex Primer for the 21st Century that the Magic Wand was one of the more successful masturbation aids marketed, and stated it was popular due to its non-penetrative nature. Australian clinical psychologist and sex therapist Bettina Arndt reported that a couple she corresponded with had success using the Magic Wand while simultaneously engaging in sexual intercourse. Physician and sex columnist Hilda Hutcherson recommended the Magic Wand in her book Pleasure, and suggested women could place a soft cloth over their vulva if they felt it was needed to decrease delivered intensity from the device. Cosmopolitan magazine reported that the Magic Wand was the vibrator most often suggested by sex therapists.|$|E

The purpose of our {{study was to determine}} the current supply and demand of physical <b>therapists</b> <b>and</b> physical <b>therapist</b> assistants in the state of Oregon and to compare our results to the Workforce Study and to the 1990 Oregon study by Banaitis and Williams. Two separate questionnaires were mailed, one to physical <b>therapists</b> <b>and</b> one to physical therapist employers. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze all data. Results showed a 40 % increase in supply of physical therapists in Oregon since 1990 and an overall decrease in demand. Decreased demand was demonstrated by a decreased number of available full-time positions, decreased number of vacancies, decreased workload, and lay-offs of physical <b>therapists</b> <b>and</b> physical <b>therapist</b> assistants. In conclusion, a mild to moderate surplus of physical <b>therapists</b> <b>and</b> physical <b>therapist</b> assistants appears to exist in the state of Oregon.
