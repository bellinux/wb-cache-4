25|$|As a plateway, the Middlebere Plateway {{differed}} from the edge railway that eventually became the norm, in that the flanges retaining the <b>truck</b> <b>wheels</b> on the line were on the rails (plates) {{rather than on the}} wheels. The plates were three feet long, L-shaped and made of cast iron, weighing 40lb. They were supported on stone sleepers weighing 60-70lb; the ends of the plates were held down by nails driven into wooden plugs inserted into holes in the sleepers. The gauge is generally quoted as being about 3 feet 9 inches, although some recent archeological investigations suggest it may have been as narrow as 3 feet 6 inches.|$|E

40|$|Road {{longitudinal}} profile {{data were collected}} on both car and <b>truck</b> <b>wheel</b> tracks {{for a number of}} road sections to study the differences in their surface roughness characteristics. Roughness was measured in terms of the heavy articulated truck index (HATI), a measure of pavement ride quality as perceived by heavy truck occupants. Roughness variation between the outer and inner wheel tracks was also investigated. The results showed that lane average values of HATI in <b>truck</b> <b>wheel</b> tracks were higher than in car wheel tracks for about 60 % of the studied network. These differences are relatively small but are statistically significant. The results also revealed that subgrade soil type and shoulder seal width influenced roughness variations between the <b>truck</b> and car <b>wheel</b> tracks. Overall, HATI values determined from profile data collected on car wheel tracks resulted in ride perception ratings that matched those determined from measurement in truck tracks for 90 % of the studied network...|$|R
40|$|The {{presented}} {{research activity}} {{is focused on}} the lightweight construction of a of <b>truck</b> <b>wheel,</b> with the final aim of improving the energy efficiency in compliance with current safety standards. On the basis of the design of a <b>truck</b> <b>wheel</b> currently into production, the objective of reducing the wheel mass is achieved by adopting high-strength materials, optimizing the geometry, and developing a new production process. The approach used for the new wheel design is based on the selection of a proper mission of the vehicle and on the acquisition of the loading spectra defined by using a new measuring wheel. The information obtained is used during the structural analysis phase. Based on the current production process, a number of suitable materials have been selected. Innovative manufacturing processes have been considered for improving the fatigue life of the wheel. Shot peening has been considered as a method to improve fatigue strength. Moreover, the introduction of laser cutting and welding led both to more freedom in the definition of the geometry of the wheel and to the reduction of the effects of geometric notches due to the absence of weld beads. A dedicated indoor test rig was used for durability tests. These activities led to a new <b>truck</b> <b>wheel</b> with reduced mass that is currently in the experimental validation phase...|$|R
