25|$|In {{classical}} physics, when a ball is rolled {{slowly up}} a large hill, it will {{come to a stop}} and roll back, because it doesn't have enough energy <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>over</b> {{the top of the hill}} to the other side. However, the Schrödinger equation predicts that there is a small probability that the ball will get to the other side of the hill, even if it has too little energy to reach the top. This is called quantum tunneling. It is related to the distribution of energy: although the ball's assumed position seems to be on one side of the hill, there is a chance of finding it on the other side.|$|E
25|$|Captain Charles Fielding assumed {{command in}} June 1803.

Although she was able <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>over</b> the bank, she lost her rudder and her hull started to let in water. By 2am on 17 November she was able to anchor and daylight revealed that she was off the coast of Norfolk. Several fishing vessels came out of Yarmouth to help. She took the captains of two of them on board as pilots, and towing their boats, sailed for the port. However, the weather had not improved and, despite her crew's efforts at the pumps, the water in her kept rising. Fielding decided to abandon ship and at 7pm her crew transferred to the fishing vessels. The subsequent court martial blamed inaccuracies in Circes navigation charts for her loss.|$|E
