5|$|Grasshoppers exemplify a {{range of}} anti-predator adaptations, {{enabling}} them <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> detection, to escape if detected, {{and in some cases}} <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> being eaten if captured. Grasshoppers are often camouflaged <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> detection by predators that hunt by sight; some species can change their coloration to suit their surroundings.|$|E
5|$|<b>To</b> <b>avoid</b> injury during descent, divers must be {{competent}} at equalising the ears, sinuses and mask; {{they must}} also learn not to hold their breath while ascending, <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> barotrauma of the lungs. The speed of ascent must be controlled <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> DCS, which requires buoyancy control skills. Good buoyancy control and trim also allow the diver to manoeuvre and move about safely, comfortably and efficiently, using swimfins for propulsion.|$|E

5|$|Alternatively, prey animals {{might be}} {{sufficiently}} gregarious to form clusters tight enough {{to enhance the}} warning signal.

Gregariousness would assist predators to learn <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> unpalatable, gregarious prey. Aposematism could also be favoured in dense populations even if these are not gregarious.|$|E

5|$|Closed-circuit or semi-closed circuit rebreather scuba systems allow {{recycling}} of exhaled gases. The volume of gas used is reduced {{compared to that}} of open circuit, so a smaller cylinder or cylinders may be used for an equivalent dive duration. They far extend the time spent underwater as compared to open circuit for the same gas consumption. Rebreathers produce fewer bubbles and less noise than scuba which makes them attractive to covert military divers <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> detection, scientific divers <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> disturbing marine animals, and media divers <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> bubble interference.|$|E
