5|$|Bean {{starred in}} the espionage {{television}} series Legends as Martin Odum, an FBI agent who takes on various fabricated identities to go undercover. The show was cancelled after its second season. An intensive viral marketing campaign was centred on the hashtag #DontKillSeanBean, focusing on the various deaths of his past characters and promising his character in Legends would not suffer the same fate. The campaign culminated with a Funny or Die exclusive video featuring Bean filming a scene for the show where he's become so accustomed to dying on screen <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>expects</b> his character to die a bizarrely gruesome death despite {{the simplicity of the}} scene.|$|E

On top of this, a further £136 million has to be paid by the Department for Transport, and £100 million from Advantage West Midlands {{must be approved by}} the Department of Trade and Industry. This was further supported by the leader of Birmingham City Council, Mike Whitby, who is also the Chairman of the New Street Gateway Steering Committee. Separate from this, the project received more support, this time from the shadow transport minister, Julian Brazier of the Conservative party.|$|E

[...] The former barker is openly rude to Enoch and Julie, then leaves with Jigger, followed by a distraught Julie.

500|$|Ben Kuchera of Polygon {{wrote that}} the game was [...] "a {{brilliant}} little puzzler" [...] and commented on the difficulty of designing such an accessible minimalist game. Dan Ryckert of Game Informer noted that the game had all of the qualities of a successful mobile game: accessibility of short game sessions, easy to learn and tough to master gameplay, room to make and try strategies, and gameplay mechanics suited for touchscreens. He added that his progressive play strategy adaptations for higher scores made the game joyful. Ars Technica Kyle Orland wrote <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>expects</b> the game to join Drop7 and Super Hexagon on his phone {{for the rest of}} his life and Crypt of the Necrodancer designer Ryan Clark called Threes the best iOS game he had ever played.|$|E

500|$|Inside Soap {{described}} Darren and Nancy as [...] "one of soap's {{most unlikely}} pairings" [...] and added, [...] "It's clear they're made for each other". In a comedy storyline Darren buys Nancy a waterbed, which Stephen opined was [...] "all {{the better to}} drown him in...", she added that Nancy isn't impressed [...] "when she learns <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>expects</b> her {{to move in with}} his family. Still, it’ll all be waterbeds under the bridge when Nancy becomes pregnant (my theory)". Stephen's colleague Caroline Fitton commented on Darren and Nancy spending less time together because of her new job, saying it proved [...] "the girl had some sense". Stephen later questioned if Nancy would forgive Darren after he planned a surprise wedding or if she would [...] "notice that he has LOSER tattoed across his forehead?" ...|$|E
500|$|Theo {{responds}} that {{he should}} accept his son's weaknesses and love him unconditionally because they are father and son—a typical sentimental idiom in family sitcoms of that time, and one which generated the typical applause from the studio audience. [...] Cliff, however, to the audience's surprise and amused approval, immediately and angrily calls this sentiment [...] "the dumbest thing I've ever heard in my life". He completely rejects the notion that loving his son means he must quietly and willingly accept it when the boy does not give his best effort in school, and famously threatened him with the often quoted line, [...] "I brought you in this world, and I'll take you out." [...] Cliff then tells his son <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>expects</b> him to work to his potential and tells Theo that he loves him.|$|E
500|$|In the Poetic Edda poem Grímnismál, the god Odin (disguised as Grímnir) reveals to {{the young}} Agnarr the {{existence}} of twelve locations. Odin mentions the location Þrymheimr sixth in a single stanza. In the stanza, Odin details that the jötunn Þjazi once lived there, and that now his daughter Skaði does. Odin describes Þrymheimr as consisting of [...] "ancient courts" [...] and refers to Skaði as [...] "the shining bride of the gods". In the prose introduction to the poem Skírnismál, the god Freyr has become heartsick for a fair girl (the jötunn Gerðr) he has spotted in Jötunheimr. The god Njörðr asks Freyr's servant Skírnir to talk to Freyr, {{and in the first}} stanza of the poem, Skaði also tells Skírnir to ask Freyr why he is so upset. Skírnir responds <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>expects</b> harsh words from their son Freyr.|$|E

500|$|In March 2008, {{news reports}} {{indicated}} that the tables had been turned on Van der Eem, who himself was secretly taped after giving an interview for Aruban television. Van der Eem, {{under the impression that}} cameras had been turned off, disclosed that he had been a friend of Van der Sloot for years (contradicting his statement on the De Vries show that he had met Van der Sloot in 2007), <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>expects</b> to become a millionaire through his involvement in the Holloway case, and that he knew the person who supposedly disposed of Holloway's body—and that Van der Sloot had asked him for two thousand euros to buy the man's silence. According to Dutch news service ANP, Van der Eem, who had already signed a book deal, [...] "was furious" [...] after learning of the taping, and [...] "threatened" [...] the interviewer, who sought legal advice. Van der Eem's book Overboord (Overboard), co-written with E.E. Byars, was released (in Dutch) on June 25, 2008. Van der Eem was arrested on December 13, 2008, in the Netherlands for allegedly hitting his girlfriend with a crowbar and engaging in risky driving behavior while fleeing police.|$|E
500|$|Almost {{immediately}} {{after the end of}} the race, the Serbian team filed a protest claiming that Čavić touched the wall first but did not use enough force to trigger the timing sensor. Officials of the International Swimming Federation (FINA) watched the video in slow motion, and announced that Phelps' victory would be upheld. Ben Ekumbo, a FINA referee announced that [...] "It's very clear that the Serbian swimmer touched second after Michael Phelps." [...] Although Serbia conceded their protest, not everyone was convinced that Phelps had won the gold medal; Branislav Jevtić, Serbia's deputy chef de mission for all sports, was quoted as saying [...] "in my opinion, it's not right, but we must follow the rules. Everybody saw what happened." [...] In one interview following the race, Čavić said [...] "I am completely happy with where I am", while in another he revealed <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>expects</b> that [...] "people will be bringing this up for years and saying you (Čavić) won that race. If we got to do this again, I would win it". While the result is still controversial, a high speed photograph shows Phelps touching the wall, while Čavić is still a short distance away. In April 2015, Spitz said that he had been sent an email posted by Omega which stated that Phelps had lost the 100m butterfly final.|$|E
500|$|Gateshead F.C. {{have been}} tenants since their {{formation}} in 1977. In May 2008 Gateshead hosted Buxton in a promotion play-off and won 20 {{in front of}} 1,402 spectators, the largest crowd to watch the club at the ground in 14 years. That record was broken a year later when 4,121 saw Gateshead defeat Telford United 20 on 9 May 2009 to win promotion to the Conference Premier league. The current record attendance for a competitive fixture stands at 8,144, set on 4 May 2014 when Gateshead played host to Grimsby Town in the second leg of the Conference Premier play-off semi-final. Gateshead won 3-1 to progress to the final at Wembley Stadium where they were beaten 2-1 by Cambridge United. The defeat consigned the club to a 55th consecutive season outside the Football League. Gateshead F.C. continue to play at Gateshead Stadium but, according to North East Life magazine, it is [...] "a fine but inappropriate stadium... as a football ground {{it can be a}} soulless home". In 2009, chairman Graham Wood unveiled plans to move to a new, purpose-built 9,000 capacity ground on Prince Consort Road in the centre of Gateshead. Detailed proposals were published soon after, and Wood told local media in 2012 <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>expects</b> the move to increase crowds and alleviate the financial constraints on him as he continues to bankroll the club; it is estimated that crowds would need to reach 3,000 regularly for the club to operate profitably from Gateshead Stadium. According to the original proposal, the stadium was expected to be ready for the 201213 season, but financing has been difficult and the proposed move is now on hold.|$|E

500|$|At {{the start}} of the 2009–10 season, Filatov made the Blue Jackets roster after {{training}} camp. Although healthy, he did not play in six of the team's first 18 games, a decision made by Columbus Head Coach Ken Hitchcock. Filatov was unhappy with his playing time and role on the team under Hitchcock and requested to be transferred back to his Russian club team. Hitchcock and the Blue Jackets coaching staff tried to improve Filatov's attention to defensive aspects of the game. [...] The Blue Jackets management agreed to Filatov's request to return to Russia {{for the remainder of the}} season. This arrangement resulted from direct dealings between the Blue Jackets and CSKA Moscow, where Filatov's salary was paid by the Russian club, and the Blue Jackets retained his rights. Shortly after his return to Russia, Filatov set a KHL record by scoring the game-winning goal in three consecutive games. He was named the League's best newcomer (defined by the KHL as [...] "a player born in 1987 or later, who has played no more than 20 top-level matches in previous national tournaments") for November, and the League's best rookie for the 11th week of the season. In his shortened season in Russia, Filatov played 26 games, scoring nine goals and adding 13 assists. Initial statements by both sides indicated the player would return to Columbus after the 2009–10 season, but since returning to Russia, Filatov has been less clear about his intentions for the 2010–11 season, stating, [...] "I hope I'll be back next year, but right now, it's really hard to say because it will again be a tough decision." [...] Howson did not comment on Filatov's stance, except to say <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>expects</b> Filatov to be at the team's training camp prior to the 2010–11 season. Subsequently, Filatov stated after the 2009–10 season that he intended to return to Columbus for training camp.|$|E
