25|$|Following λ-red operon {{activity}} induction, a linear, double-stranded cassette encoding a selectable marker, such as antibiotic resistance, {{is transformed}} into the cells {{in place of the}} target gene and incorporated into the DNA behind a specific inducible promoter. This allows for growth selection of the recombinant cells with proper insertion location verified using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Specific incorporation can be achieved by including flanking PCR primers around the inserted linear DNA that are complement to the <b>targeted</b> <b>insertion</b> site. After selection of the recombinants, a second transformation is needed to remove the selective marker. A plasmid expressing flippase (FLP) can be transformed into the recombined cells, which can specifically cleave FLP recognition target sites (FRTs) flanking the antibiotic resistance gene. While this successfully removes the selective marker from the genome, it leaves FRT scars in place of the target gene.|$|E
30|$|As <b>targeted</b> <b>insertion</b> near {{transcriptional}} termination sites stimulated lncRNA expression, {{we wondered}} whether <b>targeted</b> <b>insertion</b> at transcriptional start site would also change lncRNA expression. Here a modified promoter trap vector containing puromycin-polyA cassette without promoter, a specific sgRNA targeting site and 4 × MS 2 tagging sequences {{were designed for}} <b>targeted</b> <b>insertion</b> at transcriptional start site (Fig. S 1 C). Puromycin-polyA cassette without promoter would be stimulated by endogenous lncRNA promoter in cells with established <b>targeted</b> <b>insertion,</b> which could be depleted by Cre-mediated recombination (Fig. S 4 A). Six sgRNAs targeting lncRNA transcriptional start sites (ZEB 1 -AS 1, PTENP 1, DICER 1 -AS 1, TUG 1, HOTAIR, and MIAT) were designed {{and their impact on}} lncRNA expression was examined in 293 T cells. Established targeted insertions were examined and confirmed at the genomic level with PCR for all six lncRNAs similarly as described above (Fig. S 4 B). Then we evaluated the corresponding lncRNA expressions in 293 T cells containing established <b>targeted</b> <b>insertion</b> and found that the expression of ZEB 1 -AS 1, PTENP 1, HOTAIR, and MIAT was stimulated while DICER 1 -AS 1 and TUG 1 were inhibited (Fig. S 4 C), which indicated complicated regulatory effects for <b>targeted</b> <b>insertion</b> at transcriptional start sites. Expression status of neighboring genes was also examined and it was revealed that the expression of ZEB 1, PTENP 1 -AS 1, and HOXC 11 was upregulated (Fig. S 4 D), in consistent with the regulatory relationship observed in cells with established <b>targeted</b> <b>insertion</b> near transcriptional termination sites. Cre-mediated reversion of <b>targeted</b> <b>insertion</b> was also evaluated in 293 T cells containing established <b>targeted</b> <b>insertion</b> at transcriptional start sites and expected expression reversion was observed. Upregulated lncRNAs including ZEB 1 -AS 1, PTENP 1, HOTAIR, and MIAT were inhibited while downregulated lncRNAs including DICER 1 -AS 1 and TUG 1 were induced by Cre recombinase (Fig. S 4 E). LncRNA-regulated target genes including ZEB 1, PTENP 1 -AS 1, and HOXC 11 were also reversed by Cre recombinase (Fig.  4 F), confirming the regulatory relationship between ZEB 1 /PTENP 1 -AS 1 /HOXC 11 and ZEB 1 -AS 1 /PTENP 1 /HOTAIR, respectively.|$|E

However, exogenous fragment insertion inside lncRNA transcripts might disrupt lncRNA functions. Then we designed another six sgRNAs targeting sites after lncRNA transcriptional termination (ZEB 1 -AS 1, PTENP 1, DICER 1 -AS 1, TUG 1, HOTAIR, and MIAT) and examined the impact of targeted insertions on lncRNA expression in 293 T cells (Fig. S 3 A). Established targeted insertions were confirmed at the genomic level with PCR for all six lncRNAs as described above (Fig. S 3 B). The expression of all six targeted lncRNAs was also upregulated as described above, though increasing extent was not so dramatic as comparing to cells with <b>targeted</b> <b>insertion</b> inside transcriptional termination site of related lncRNAs (Fig. S 3 C). The expression changes of neighboring genes were similar as described above, though the upregulation of ZEB 1, PTENP 1 -AS 1, and HOXC 11 was not so robust as comparing to cells with <b>targeted</b> <b>insertion</b> inside transcriptional termination site of related lncRNAs (Fig. S 3 D).|$|E
40|$|The {{biggest problem}} we faced in {{designing}} clock trees is skew minimization. The reasons that add to clock skew include loading mismatch at the clocked elements, mismatch in RC delay. In the present scenario, if we set <b>target</b> <b>insertion</b> delay to the tool then minimum <b>insertion</b> delay is <b>target</b> and maximum <b>insertion</b> delay is floating i. e., global skew is not constant. This is undesirable so we achieve the control on insertion delay by performing many experiments on different parameters like <b>target</b> <b>insertion</b> delay, Global skew, clock shielding, Inserting redundant vias and Non-Default Routing rules (NDR).

Recently several lncRNA manipulation tools have been established and applied to a large number of lncRNAs (Zhu et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2017). However, as described above, limitations still exist, making it difficult to elucidate the functions of lncRNAs overlapping with other genes and stimulate lncRNA expression specifically (Quinn and Chang, 2016), which could be overcome by our CTRL system.

40|$|AbstractType 1 protein phosphatases (PP 1) are {{involved}} in diverse cellular activities, ranging from glycogen metabolism to chromatin structure modification, mitosis, and meiosis. The holoenzymes are composed {{of two or more}} subunits, including a catalytic subunit (PP 1 c) and one or more regulatory subunits. Many eukaryotes possess several catalytic subunit genes which encode highly conserved isoforms. In rodents, one of these isoforms, PP 1 cγ 2, appears to be expressed predominantly in testes. Whether PP 1 cγ 2 performs a testis-specific function is unclear.

30|$|Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), {{defined as}} RNA {{transcripts}} longer than 200 nucleotides without the protein-coding ability (Carninci et al., 2005), share many features with protein-coding messenger RNAs (mRNAs) such as polyadenylated 5 ′ ends and multi-exonic structures (Guttman et al., 2010). Though expression levels are less abundant, lncRNAs outnumber mRNAs with more diverse regulatory functions (Quinn and Chang, 2016). They {{may serve as}} decoys, sponges, signals or scaffolds in regulating chromatin conformation, nuclear organization, gene expression, and protein activity in cis or trans manner (Ulitsky and Bartel, 2013; Quinn and Chang, 2016). LncRNAs are involved in various physiological processes and their loss- or gain-of-function mutations have been implicated in the pathogenesis of human diseases (Wapinski and Chang, 2011). Although their functions have been investigated extensively, manipulation of lncRNAs is challenging, limiting further in-depth analysis for lncRNAs. Efficient and convenient tagging method could be helpful for effective lncRNAs immunoprecipitation to explore lncRNAs-DNA/RNA/protein interactions (Engreitz et al., 2014; Chu et al., 2015). Another challenge is lncRNAs expression manipulation with high efficiency and specificity: Point mutations or insertions and deletions (Indels) are usually insufficient to block lncRNAs functions completely (Cong et al., 2013; Mali et al., 2013). Deleting the whole lncRNA loci or changing lncRNA expression with either clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-associated endonuclease Cas 9 system, CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) or CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) system have been developed as alternative approaches (Zhu et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2017). However, many lncRNA loci overlap with protein-coding genes and even share common promoter regions, restricting the applications of available tools. In addition, many lncRNAs are cis-acting factors, so traditional overexpression strategy may not work in such conditions. Recently it is shown that <b>targeted</b> <b>insertion</b> could be achieved with CRISPR/Cas 9 system via canonical non-homologous end joining (c-NHEJ) pathway {{without the need for}} homologous or microhomologous sequences (Schmid-Burgk et al., 2016; Suzuki et al., 2016), so it is plausible to achieve <b>targeted</b> <b>insertion</b> at different sites with one universal donor vector using CRISPR/Cas 9 system. As gene trap system has been well-established to disrupt gene functions with selection markers/tags for subsequent functional analysis (Stanford et al., 2001), we here modified gene trap vectors and used CRISPR/Cas 9 to establish a scalable tool entitled CTRL (CRISPR-mediated tagging and regulation of lncRNAs) for lncRNA tagging and expression manipulation in mammalian cells. With this method, we successfully tagged lncRNAs at either 5 ′ or 3 ′ end. And lncRNA expression status was either stimulated or inhibited reversibly depending on the <b>targeted</b> <b>insertion</b> site.|$|E

No interactions with soluble SecA or cpSRP 43 were found. These results imply a role for cpSRP 54 in D 1 biogenesis...|$|R
40|$|Prostate cancer (PC) {{is one of}} {{the major}} causes of male death {{worldwide}} and the development of new and more potent anti-PC compounds is a constant requirement. Among the current treatments, (R) -bicalutamide and enzalutamide are non-steroidal androgen receptor antagonist drugs approved also in the case of castration-resistant forms. Both these drugs present a moderate antiproliferative activity and their use is limited due to the development of resistant mutants of their biological <b>target.</b> <b>Insertion</b> of fluorinated and perfluorinated groups in biologically active compounds is a current trend in medicinal chemistry, applied to improve their efficacy and stability profiles. As a means to obtain such effects, different modifications with perfluoro groups were rationally designed on the bicalutamide and enzalutamide structures, leading to the synthesis of a series of new antiproliferative compounds. Several new analogues displayed improved in vitro activity towards four different prostate cancer cell lines, while maintaining full AR antagonism and therefore representing promising leads for further development. Furthermore, a series of molecular modelling studies were performed on the AR antagonist conformation, providing useful insights on potential protein-ligand interactions...|$|R
