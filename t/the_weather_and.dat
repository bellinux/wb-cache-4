5|$|Climate models use {{quantitative}} methods {{to simulate the}} interactions of the atmosphere, oceans, land surface and ice. They are used {{for a variety of}} purposes; from the study of the dynamics of <b>the</b> <b>weather</b> <b>and</b> climate system, to projections of future climate. All climate models balance, or very nearly balance, incoming energy as short wave (including visible) electromagnetic radiation to the earth with outgoing energy as long wave (infrared) electromagnetic radiation from the earth. Any imbalance results in a change in the average temperature of the earth.|$|E

5|$|Only one List A {{game was}} ever {{played at the}} ground, and this was only the second match of its type: Glamorgan's Gillette Cup fixture against Somerset on 22 May1963.

5|$|Robert FitzRoy was {{appointed}} in 1854 {{as chief of}} a new department within the Board of Trade {{to deal with the}} collection of weather data at sea as a service to mariners. This was the forerunner of the modern Meteorological Office.

5|$|The New Zealanders' {{defensive}} positions {{had been}} improved despite <b>the</b> <b>weather</b> <b>and</b> the harassment from German artillery, which killed Fulton, the original {{commander of the}} Rifle Brigade, when a barrage targeted his headquarters. The division undertook the first offensive action by the British forces during the Spring Offensive when three battalions seized the high ground of La Signy farm on 30 March. This success, although relatively trivial to the New Zealanders, was a morale booster {{for the rest of}} the beleaguered Third Army.|$|E

5|$|The {{film was}} mostly shot in Australia and New Zealand, with Canada also {{serving as a}} location. Filming took place from January to May 2008. Production and {{post-production}} were troubled, with delays due to <b>the</b> <b>weather</b> <b>and</b> Jackman's other commitments, an incomplete screenplay that was still being written in Los Angeles while principal photography rolled in Australia, conflicts arising between director Hood and Fox's executives, and an unfinished workprint being leaked on the Internet one month before the film's debut.|$|E
5|$|The first {{recorded}} spaniel in Russia {{was a black}} Cocker Spaniel owned by hunting enthusiast Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolaevich {{towards the end of}} the 19th century. Because of its noble connections, spaniels of various breeds were imported to St. Petersburg and Moscow. Some were used for hunting, but the smaller spaniels were not of much use in Russian bird hunting due to <b>the</b> <b>weather</b> <b>and</b> terrain conditions. It was at the beginning of the 20th century that selective breeding began for longer legged spaniels; specifically importing Springer Spaniels to create a rather mixed Russian Spaniel.|$|E

5|$|The game {{kicked off}} on January 1, 1947 at Kidd Field in El Paso, Texas in {{freezing}} temperatures.

The Cincinnati defense held, however, and the game went into halftime scoreless.|$|E
5|$|The storm {{also had}} an {{economic}} impact. The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and American Stock Exchange (AMEX) closed {{as a result of}} the storm.

Today, the Giant Schnauzer participates in numerous dog sports, including Schutzhund. It is also used as a police dog.|$|E

5|$|Apart {{from these}} sculptures, entire {{sequences}} from the Hindu epics (commonly the Ramayana and the Mahabharata) have been sculpted in a clockwise direction {{starting at the}} main entrance. The right to left sequence is the same direction taken by the devotees in their ritual circumambulation as they wind inward toward the inner sanctum. Depictions from mythology such as the epic hero Arjuna shooting fish, the elephant-headed god Ganesha, the Sun god Surya, <b>the</b> <b>weather</b> <b>and</b> war god Indra, and Brahma with Sarasvati are common. Also frequently seen in these temples is Durga, with several arms holding weapons given to her by other gods, {{in the act of}} killing a buffalo (a demon in a buffalo's form) and Harihara (a fusion of Shiva and Vishnu) holding a conch, wheel and trident. Many of these friezes were signed by the artisans, the first known instance of signed artwork in India.|$|E
5|$|Grace was {{inactive}} {{for over}} a week after that match, partly because of his injury but also as his daughter was born in London, and his next appearance was in Ireland where he played for the USEE against 15 past and present players of the University of Dublin at its College Park venue. This match was played over three days, starting on Thursday, 23 May. A guest player in the USEE team was the Australian batsman Charles Bannerman. However, Grace and Bannerman scored just 11 and 1 respectively in the USEE first innings, while Fred Grace and Bannerman's fellow Australian Midwinter scored 46 and 64. The match was ruined by <b>the</b> <b>weather</b> <b>and</b> ended in a draw.|$|E

5|$|In February 1920, a Notice to Airmen {{was issued}} advising pilots {{that had made}} {{emergency}} landings at Penshurst that they could use the War Office telephone to inform the police of their arrival and to obtain conveyances for their passengers {{to take them to}} Penshurst station. On 5 June 1920, the first air mail flight between the Netherlands and the United Kingdom was made. Bert Hinchcliffe departed from Schiphol in a hired Airco DH.9 with 300 letters on board. Despite the bad weather, Hinchcliffe decided not to land at Lympne and pressed on towards Croydon. He was eventually forced to land at Penshurst due to a combination of <b>the</b> <b>weather</b> <b>and</b> running low on fuel. A taxi was hired to take Hinchcliffe and the letters on to London. A linen windsock was installed at Penshurst in November 1920. The War Office telephone was notified as having been discontinued in January 1921. On 24 September 1921, a de Havilland DH.18 aircraft diverted to Penshurst as Croydon was fogbound.|$|E
5|$|King Memorial Fountain is a {{fountain}} erected in 1893 with a monumental bronze statue of Moses smiting the rock for water on Mount Horeb. Four figures of Israelite slaves around the statue {{on the side}} of the mountain represent the four stages of life: infancy, youth, adulthood, and old age. The fountain is in the center of formal gardens laid out by William S. Egerton. It was a gift from Rufus H. King and was sculpted by J. Massey Rhind, who also sculpted the Philip Schuyler statue that stands at the center of the intersection of Eagle Street and Washington Avenue in front of city hall. In 1988, the statue of Moses was cleaned and applied with a wax coating to protect it from <b>the</b> <b>weather,</b> <b>and</b> an arm was reattached to one of the four other statues on the fountain.|$|E
5|$|On 3 March 1789, {{he enlisted}} as a {{volunteer}} on the 700-ton Aurore, under Captain Tardivet, a slave ship bound for India. Aurore sailed to Pondicherry and ferried troops bound for Isle de France. On her next journey, seeking to purchase slaves on the Horn of Africa, Aurore was wrecked in Mozambique Channel, drowning 400 black slaves chained in the orlop. Tardivet chartered the Portugues San Antoine in October 1790 to return to Port-Louis, but had to divert to Sumatra because of <b>the</b> <b>weather,</b> <b>and</b> only returned to Port-Louis in late 1790, on a French ship via the French colony of Pondicherry. Promoted to officer, Surcouf enlisted on the Courrier d'Afrique, another slave ship, bound for Mozambique under Captain Garnier. Captain Tardivet then brought him over as Lieutenant on his new ship, Revanche. On Revanche, Surcouf made several expeditions off Madagascar.|$|E
