40|$|Â© 2003 Cambridge University Press. <b>Typographical</b> error on <b>printed</b> page: {{article from}} volume 49, not 48 as printed. The {{interpretation}} of 1 Pet 4. 6 which sees â 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 8 the deadâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9 as Christians who heard the gospel during their lifetime but who have since died {{is becoming increasingly}} widely accepted, especially in recent commentaries in English. William Dalton's monograph Christ's Proclamation to the Spirits has been influential in promoting this view. However, despite its current popularity, there are serious problems with this interpretation, especially in its dependence on assuming a primitive eschatological context for 1 Peter. The view of the verse as referring to a proclamation made to people already dead, on the other hand, is more plausible than recent commentators suggest, and can be defended against their criticisms...|$|R
40|$|This {{experimental}} {{study investigated the}} relationship between font type, font size, and line spacing and legibility, as measured by speed of reading, comprehension, and recalling. Instruments for testing legibility and reading comprehension were presented in eight <b>typographical</b> styles in <b>print.</b> The study tested 90 students for legibility and 76 students for comprehension. The subjects were chosen from Urmia Language Center in Urmia, Iran, and they were both girls and boys. Two weeks after the reading comprehension test, the subjects took part in recalling test. In all tests, the subjects {{were randomly assigned to}} one of the eight different typographical styles with Arial or Bookman Old Style (font selection) and 10 pt or 12 pt (font size). But the subjects had both set solid and double spaced leading in their instruments. Results indicated that the 12 pt was read faster than 10 pt. But font selection and line spacing did not have any significant effect on reading speed. Also, there were no significant results with regard to comprehension and recalling. </p...|$|R
40|$|Three reports {{address the}} design of flight-deck {{procedures}} and various aspects of human interaction with cockpit systems that have direct impact on flight safety. One report, On the Typography of Flight- Deck Documentation, discusses basic research about typography {{and the kind of}} information needed by designers of flight deck documentation. Flight crews reading poorly designed documentation may easily overlook a crucial item on the checklist. The report surveys and summarizes the available literature regarding the design and <b>typographical</b> aspects of <b>printed</b> material. It focuses on typographical factors such as proper typefaces, character height, use of lower- and upper-case characters, line length, and spacing. Graphical aspects such as layout, color coding, fonts, and character contrast are discussed; and several cockpit conditions such as lighting levels and glare are addressed, as well as usage factors such as angular alignment, paper quality, and colors. Most of the insights and recommendations discussed in this report are transferable to paperless cockpit systems of the future and computer-based procedure displays (e. g., "electronic flight bag") in aerospace systems and similar systems that are used in other industries such as medical, nuclear systems, maritime operations, and military systems...|$|R
40|$|This essay {{considers}} {{the problem of}} normalized orthography in critical editions of Middle High German texts. Whether the orthographical conventions that crystallized in nineteenth-century philology present a reliable picture of medieval manuscript spelling {{is a question that}} has long been debated by editors and historians of the German language. It becomes all the more urgent, however, now that digital reproductions afford direct access to manuscripts. Drawing on their experience of producing both a digital and an analog print edition of the Kaiserchronik, the authors of this essay advocate a print spelling from which a certain amount of scribal variation is filtered out, but always {{in such a way as}} to respect and reflect the writing system of the medieval manuscript. They also suggest that this practice, although its results and emphases are very different from the orthographies of Lachmann, Benecke, and Grimm in the nineteenth century, nonetheless shares with its predecessors the conviction that any representation of scribal writing practices in the <b>typographical</b> medium of <b>print</b> must bring its readers into contact with some aspect of the historical linguistic reality. This, the authors contend, is one of the main tasks for a responsible editorial philology in the digital age...|$|R
40|$|Many {{types of}} paper {{documentation}} are employed on the flight-deck. They {{range from a}} simple checklist card to a bulky Aircraft Flight Manual (AFM). Some of these documentations have typographical and graphical deficiencies; yet, many cockpit tasks such as conducting checklists, way-point entry, limitations and performance calculations, and many more, {{require the use of}} these documents. Moreover, during emergency and abnormal situations, the flight crews' effectiveness in combating the situation is highly dependent on such documentation; accessing and reading procedures has a significant impact on flight safety. Although flight-deck documentation are an important (and sometimes critical) form of display in the modern cockpit, there is a dearth of information on how to effectively design these displays. The object of this report is to provide a summary of the available literature regarding the design and <b>typographical</b> aspects of <b>printed</b> matter. The report attempts 'to bridge' the gap between basic research about typography, and the kind of information needed by designers of flight-deck documentation. The report focuses on typographical factors such as type-faces, character height, use of lower- and upper-case characters, line length, and spacing. Some graphical aspects such as layout, color coding, fonts, and character contrast are also discussed. In addition, several aspects of cockpit reading conditions such as glare, angular alignment, and paper quality are addressed. Finally, a list of recommendations for the graphical design of flight-deck documentation is provided...|$|R
40|$|Some {{years ago}} {{the authors of the}} present paper found in the Fondo Padoa lying in the Mathematical Library of Genoa University a {{manuscript}} of 11 pages by Alessandro Padoa with the title A proposito di un nuovo sistema fondamentale della geometria elementare. It seems to be ready for publication and contains also <b>typographical</b> instruction for <b>printing.</b> Other investigations on Padoa and his rôle in Peano’s school led in a series of recent papers to a probably complete list of Padoa’s publications where, however, the above mentioned manuscript is not present and, therefore, is likely to be considered an unpublished paper. It’s a matter of fact that the whole of Padoa’s scientific production has to be integrated by some works that he didn’t publish. The unpublished paper under examination deals with the axiomatization of elementary geometry given by Mario Pieri in 1899 in “Della geometria elementare come sistema ipotetico deduttivo. Monografia del punto e del moto”, where, as it is well-known, elementary geometry is based on the primitive notions of point and movement and on 20 postulates. Padoa agrees with Pieri’s proposal to define segment starting from point and movement; he suggests, however, some modification to the original set of postulates and gives a (partial) proof of their independence. The unpublished paper reveals the interest of Padoa in this subject-matter and, in some sense, his idea of participating in the already consolidated field of research represented by Pieri’s results...|$|R
