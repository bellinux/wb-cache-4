40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} {{the findings from}} a study of melting efficiency in steel foundries and provides examples of material and energy savings from improvements in technology and melting practices. This study is based on information gathered at 19 Steel Founders Society of America member foundries and includes a combination of historical data and industrial measurements by the research team. Information and data were collected {{on the type of}} melting equipment, melting practices, energy use and ladle practices. The data was statistically analyzed using STATGRAPHICS commercial software. A multiple regression analysis allowed evaluation of the influence of the melting furnace (type, size, age, and transformer power) and operating parameters such as tap temperature, <b>tap</b> <b>to</b> <b>tap</b> time, and furnace productivity on the energy consumption for melting steel. Also included in this paper are results from one industrial partner’s site, Monett Metals...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} mixed-signal very-large-scale-integrated chip that emulates {{nonlinear}} active cochlear signal processing. Modeling the cochlea's micromechanics, including outer hair cell (OHC) electromotility, this silicon (Si) cochlea features active coupling between neighboring basilar membrane (BM) segments-a first. Neighboring BM segments, each implemented {{as a class}} AB log-domain second-order section, exchange currents representing OHC forces. This novel active-coupling architecture overcomes the major shortcomings of existing cascade and parallel filter-bank architectures, while achieving {{the highest number of}} digital outputs in an Si cochlea to date. An active-coupling architecture Si cochlea with 360 frequency channels and 2160 pulse-stream outputs occupies 10. 9 mm[superscript 2] in a five-metal 1 -poly 0. 25 -mum CMOS process. The chip's responses resemble that of a living cochlea's: Frequency responses become larger and more sharply tuned when active coupling is turned on. For instance, gain increases by 18 dB and Q 10 increases from 0. 45 to 1. 14. This enhancement decreases with increasing input intensity, realizing frequency-selective automatic gain control. Further work is required to improve performance by reducing large variations from <b>tap</b> <b>to</b> <b>tap...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{problem of}} energy {{recovery}} from the electric arc furnace process of steel industry is addressed. During a <b>tap</b> <b>to</b> <b>tap</b> cycle, {{a significant part of}} the energy required for steel production is dissipated by the off-gas. The high variability of temperatures and flows, and the high concentration of dust, which characterize the production process, make the adoption of current energy recovery solutions quite difficult, both from the technological and the economical perspective. A new system is proposed exploiting the characteristics of phase change materials (PCM), in particular aluminum, to reduce the variability of off-gas temperatures and thermal powers, in order to allow an efficient energy recovery. The smoothing device is analyzed by thermo-fluid dynamic simulations in order to optimize its performance. A new boiler configuration equipped with cyclones is proposed to overcome also the problem of high dust content of the off-gas. The high recovery efficiencies, the low investment and operation costs and non-invasive plant modifications induced by the smoothing system, make the proposed PCM-based recovery system a feasible solution to reduce energy supply costs and emissions in the steel industry...|$|E

40|$|In {{electric}} arc furnace steelmaking units, the essential parameters that considered important are reducing price, increasing production and decreasing environmental pollution. Electric arc furnaces are the largest users of electric energy in industry. The most important techniques {{that can be used}} to reduce the electric energy consumption in {{electric arc}} furnaces are scrap preheating, stirring, use of burners and hot charge and foamy slag. Between these methods, use of foamy slag is the most useful and economic factor. Foamy slag can reduce the amount of energy, electrods, refractory consumption, <b>tap</b> <b>to</b> <b>tap</b> time and increases productivity. In this research, method of production and optimum conditions for foamy slag in 200 tons {{electric arc furnace}} were investigated. The use of foamy slag in this research shows that it can reduce the electric energy consumption from 670 to 580 kwh/ton and also the melting time from 130 to 115 min. and the electric power input can be increase with foamy slag. It also shows that with foamy slag the optimum amount of FeO in slag is 20 - 24 percent and the optimum basicity is 2 - 2. 2...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: High {{strength}} {{requirement of}} Thermo-mechanically treated (TMT) rebars {{is crucial in}} the construction of flyovers, bridges and high rise buildings because of the good combination of the mechanical properties. The yield strength is expected to be between 450 MPa and 550 MPa after the hot rolling process depending on prescribed standards. A series of experimental trials during a hot rolling process were carried out in a steel plant in which parameters such as the water flow rate and the processing time were varied to study their effect on the evolving mechanical properties of the rebars. Four “heats”(A “heat” is a batch of molten steel, referred to as <b>tap</b> <b>to</b> <b>tap</b> cycle and involves furnace charging with scrap, melting, deslagging, tapping molten steel and furnace turn-around. Furnace turn-around is the period following completion of tapping until the furnace is recharged for the next “heat”) were done to produce Y 12 mm reinforced bars (rebars). For every “heat” done, tensile tests were carried out on the samples every after 15 minutes to establish the yield strength of the rebar. At least eight samples were tested in every “heat”. It was observed that some samples showed low values of yield strength (< 450 MPa) which falls short of the minimum guaranteed yield strength. It was further noted that the water flow rate in the water cooling chamber was far below 600 m⁄h for this size of rebar in some cases. A series of these tests were conducted and the water flow rate adjusted in order to arrive at the optimum flow rate corresponding to the expected yield strength and microstructure. The quenching time in the water cooling chamber was in the range 0. 1 to 0. 5 seconds and the results obtained both for the tensile tests and microstructure after several adjustments to the flow rate in particular yielded optimum results consistent with prescribed standards...|$|E

50|$|Fares are {{categorised}} in two ways: a trip is {{a single}} unit of travel, from <b>tap</b> on <b>to</b> <b>tap</b> off; a journey {{is a collection of}} 1 or more trips taken within a short space of time of each other. Trips will be counted as one journey if a passenger taps on for a new trip within 60 minutes of tapping off from their previous trip (on the Manly ferry the time limit is 130 minutes from tap on). Trips are used to calculate fares. Fares for consecutive trips involving the same mode of transport are combined so the passenger is charged as if they have taken just one trip, from its origin to ultimate destination. Journeys involving transfers between modes attract separate fares for each mode. A journey can consist of a maximum of eight trips.|$|R

Although the signal-to-noise ratio in this environment is not good enough, the 2 nm resolution and 0. 09 Hz/nm sensitivity prove that the Akiyama probe can be used at its second eigenmode under FM non-contact mode or low amplitude FM tapping mode, which means that it is easy to change the measuring method from normal <b>tapping</b> <b>to</b> small amplitude <b>tapping</b> or non-contact mode with the same probe and equipment...|$|R

40|$|Deathwatch beetles produce taps, by {{drumming}} {{the head}} on the substrate, which enable males to locate females.

However, the mechanism is not efficient as many males studied failed to locate the female.

40|$|We {{studied the}} process of pulse finding by using {{mechanical}} performances of composed music {{in which it is}} fairly challenging to find a pulse. Hu-man participants synchronized to short musical excerpts that varied in the amount of musical information present, the amount of syncopation, and the metrical position of the first note. We quantified the period and phase of tapping, the amount of nonsynchronized <b>tapping,</b> the time <b>to</b> start <b>tapping,</b> the variability of the intertap interval, and the deviation of taps from the intended musical events. The amount of musical informa-tion and the amount of syncopation were predictors of pulse-finding ability (metrical appropriateness of <b>tapping,</b> time <b>to</b> start <b>tapping,</b> variability of tapping, and deviations from the beat), and the metrical position of the first note of excerpts biased participants <b>to</b> <b>tap</b> with the corresponding phase. In addition, the degree <b>to</b> which participants <b>tapped</b> in consensus correlated positively with pulse-finding ability. We modeled participants’ behavior by using a resonance equation to calculate the strength of all metrically appropriate periodicities. The summed activation strength across the periodicities correlated with pulse-finding ability. Our results demonstrate that musical pulse finding is a useful behavioral paradigm for modeling the influences of stimulus features on complex sensorimo-tor synchronization...|$|R

Here we tested whether this relationship between reading ability and synchronized tapping holds in typically-developing adolescents.

First, since auditory-motor synchronization requires {{monitoring of the}} relationship between motor output and auditory input, we predicted that subjects better able <b>to</b> <b>tap</b> <b>to</b> the beat would perform better on attention tests. Second, since auditory-motor synchronization requires fine temporal precision within the auditory system for the extraction of a sound’s onset time, we predicted that subjects better able <b>to</b> <b>tap</b> <b>to</b> the beat would be less affected by backward masking, a measure of temporal precision within the auditory system. As predicted, <b>tapping</b> performance related <b>to</b> reading, attention, and backward masking. These results motivate future research investigating whether beat synchronization training can improve not only reading ability, but potentially executive function and auditory processing as well...|$|R
40|$|Transport of {{peptides}} {{across the}} membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum for assembly with MHC class I molecules {{is an essential}} step in antigen presentation to cytotoxic T cells, This task is performed by the major histocompatibility complex-encoded transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP). Using a combinatorial approach we have analyzed the substrate specificity of human TAP at high resolution {{and in the absence}} of any given sequence context, revealing the contribution of each peptide residue in stabilizing binding <b>to</b> <b>TAP.</b> Human <b>TAP</b> was found <b>to</b> be highly selective with peptide affinities covering at least three orders of magnitude, Interestingly, the selectivity is not equally distributed over the substrate, Only the N-terminal three positions and the C-terminal residue are critical, whereas effects from other peptide positions are negligible. A major influence from the peptide backbone was uncovered by peptide scans and libraries containing D amino acids, Again, independent of peptide length, critical positions were clustered near the peptide termini. These approaches demonstrate that human TBP is selective, with residues determining the affinity located in distinct regions, and point to the role of the peptide backbone in binding <b>to</b> <b>TAP,</b> This binding mode of TAP has implications in an optimized repertoire selection and in a coevolution with the major histocompatibility complex/T cell receptor complex.
