40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine Latino/a student {{preferences}} for school counselor activities. The primary focus of research was to determine what school counseling activities Latino/a students perceived as important and which school counseling activities Latino/a high school students perceived as satisfying. The researcher pursued this purpose through administration of a survey instrument developed by the researcher. The instrument consisted of 14 demographic items and 42 5 -point Likert scale items based on the domains described in <b>the</b> <b>ASCA’s</b> <b>national</b> model and current literature on experiences of Latino/a adolescents. The sample was comprised of 210 Latino/a high school students from five high schools in three school districts in the suburbs of a large Southwestern U. S. metroplex. The study population consisted of 94 female and 115 male participants ranging in age from 14 to 20 years old with the median age of 17. 54 years. Overall, students preferred school counseling activities focusing on college and career readiness. According to the results of this study, students indicated that although they believed college and career activities to be important, they were not satisfied with how their school counselors provided those activities.

40|$|Multicultural {{competence}} (MCC), {{despite its}} integral part in school counseling {{and the school}} setting, is not applied within the American School Counselor Association (<b>ASCA)</b> <b>national</b> model (NM).

Without incorporating multicultural practices in the school setting, student performance may suffer. Student performance affects everyone who is learning, working, or has {{a child who is}} or will be at the middle school level. The {{purpose of this study was}} to identify if perceived MCC, as measured by the MCCTS-R, and/or adherence to <b>the</b> <b>ASCA</b> NM, as measured by the SCPIS, could predict student performance and if there was a relationship between the perceived MCC and adherence to <b>the</b> <b>ASCA</b> NM. <b>The</b> school counseling and multicultural counseling theories were used together as a lens for the study.

40|$|This grant {{covers the}} {{analysis}} of EUVE spectra of the cool star binary system Capella. This project has also required {{the analysis of}} simultaneous Advanced Satellite for Cosmology and Astrophysics (<b>ASCA)</b> data. <b>The</b> <b>ASCA</b> spectrum of Capella could not be fit with standard models; by imposing models based on strong lines observed with EUVE, a problem wavelength region was identified. Correcting the problem required calculations of atomic collision strengths of higher principal quantum number than had ever been calculated. With these new models applied to <b>the</b> <b>ASCA</b> spectrum, better fits were obtained. Findings are that: (1) ASCA and EUVE spectra are both dominated by a region at 6 x 10 (exp 6) K. (2) The high energy cut-off of <b>the</b> <b>ASCA</b> spectrum is consistent with emission from the highest ionization stages of EUVE, namely Fe XXIV. (3) EUVE requires a continuous emission measure distribution with more than two temperatures. (4) <b>The</b> <b>ASCA</b> spectra are of such high statistical significance that systematic uncertainties dominate, including atomic physics issues and calibration issues. (5) While <b>the</b> <b>ASCA</b> spectral fits achieve lower Chi(exp 2 with two-temperature fits, the EUVE-derived emission measure distribution models are also consistent with the spectra. (6) The Fe/H ratio obtained from <b>the</b> <b>ASCA</b> fit is within 20 % of the Fe/H abundance obtained from the summed spectra of Capella over 5 EUVE pointings, {{as well as the}} 1996 EUVE data. This result confirms our claims that quasi-continua composed of weak emission lines in the short wavelength spectrometer of EUVE are not major contributors to the measured Capella continuum. Other abundance ratios are also determined from <b>the</b> <b>ASCA</b> data, using models derived with EUVE. Si, Si, and Mg appear to be close to solar photospheric values, while the ratio of Ne/Fe is three to four times lower than solar photospheric values. Whether there is a general First Ionization Potential (FIP) effect or a specific neon anomaly cannot be determined from these data. (8) EUVE line ratios indicating low optical depth place limits {{on the extent to which}} the X-ray lines are optically, thick. While the brightest lines may be marginally thick, <b>the</b> <b>ASCA</b> spectrum is not of sufficient resolution to determine the optical depth in these lines...|$|R
