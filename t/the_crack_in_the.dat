5|$|The {{most common}} {{story about the}} {{cracking}} of the bell is that it happened when the bell was rung upon the 1835 death of the Chief Justice of the United States, John Marshall. This story originated in 1876, when the volunteer curator of Independence Hall, Colonel Frank Etting, {{announced that he had}} ascertained the truth of the story. While there is little evidence to support this view, it has been widely accepted and taught. Other claims regarding <b>the</b> <b>crack</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> bell include stories that it was damaged while welcoming Lafayette on his return to the United States in 1824, that it cracked announcing the passing of the British Catholic Relief Act 1829, and that some boys had been invited to ring the bell, and inadvertently damaged it. David Kimball, in his book compiled for the National Park Service, suggests that it most likely cracked sometime between 1841 and 1845, either on the Fourth of July or on Washington's Birthday.|$|E

Kelly was six weeks behind on her payments, owing 29 shillings. Shortly after 10:45a.m., Bowyer knocked on her door but received no response. He reached through <b>the</b> <b>crack</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> window, pushed aside a coat being used as a curtain and peered inside—discovering Kelly's horribly mutilated corpse lying on the bed.|$|E

The new members were Appeal Judge Christian Borchsenius, Erik Øie of the Norwegian Civil Aviation Administration and Professor Janne Carlzon of the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm. The expanded commission was ordered to especially look into three issues: all air movements in the area at the time; how <b>the</b> <b>crack</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> torque tube was caused; {{and the use of}} medication by the pilot.|$|E

25|$|The {{first and}} most {{extensive}} recorded cleaning, revarnishing, and touch-up of the Mona Lisa was an 1809 wash and revarnishing undertaken by Jean-Marie Hooghstoel, {{who was responsible for}} restoration of paintings for the galleries of the Musée Napoléon. The work involved cleaning with spirits, touch-up of colour, and revarnishing the painting. In 1906, Louvre restorer Eugène Denizard performed watercolour retouches on areas of the paint layer disturbed by <b>the</b> <b>crack</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> panel. Denizard also retouched the edges of the picture with varnish, to mask areas that had been covered initially by an older frame. In 1913, when the painting was recovered after its theft, Denizard was again called upon to work on the Mona Lisa. Denizard was directed to clean the picture without solvent, and to lightly touch up several scratches to the painting with watercolour. In 1952, the varnish layer over the background in the painting was evened out. After the second 1956 attack, restorer Jean-Gabriel Goulinat was directed to touch up the damage to Mona Lisas left elbow with watercolour.|$|E
500|$|The {{building}} {{was a little}} unstable and had already shifted considerably prior to Michelangelo's work of 1508, causing cracking of the ceiling, <b>the</b> <b>crack</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> [...] "Judith" [...] pendentive being so large {{that it had to}} be filled with bricks and mortar before painting. The upper part of the ceiling provided Michelangelo an irregular surface due to cracks and water seepage.|$|E
500|$|Mint {{director}} Nellie Tayloe Ross {{had long}} admired Franklin, and {{wanted him to}} be depicted on a coin. [...] In 1947, she instructed her chief engraver, John R. Sinnock, to prepare designs for a Franklin half dollar. Sinnock's designs were based on his earlier work, but he died before their completion. The designs were completed by Sinnock's successor, Gilroy Roberts. [...] The Mint submitted the new designs to the Commission of Fine Arts ("Commission") for its advisory opinion. The Commission disliked the small eagle and felt that depicting <b>the</b> <b>crack</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Liberty Bell would expose the coinage to jokes and ridicule. [...] Despite the Commission's disapproval, the Mint proceeded with Sinnock's designs.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. During the {{revision}} of the individual parts of a hydroelectric power plant <b>the</b> <b>cracks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> pins of quick operating and revision flap valves of Francis turbine were found. Our department has been approached with a request to investigate the causes of these cracks. This paper deals with the complex analysis of influential factors, especially the measurements of residual stresses by hole-drilling method, in order to reveal <b>the</b> factors causing <b>the</b> <b>cracks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> pins...|$|R
500|$|Moffat's plan [...] "from the outset", to tie {{the episode}} into the {{overarching}} story arc of the series, was that Rory not just die but be erased from history in <b>the</b> <b>crack</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> universe. Moffat would later bring Rory back in [...] "The Pandorica Opens", though the episode reveals his consciousness {{was placed in a}} Roman centurion Auton as part of a trap for the Doctor to save the universe from the cracks. Moffat also thought it was appropriate as the trio had had fun, and now {{it was time for a}} casualty. Rory's death is also connected with Chibnall's theme of making mistakes; it was the Doctor's fault as he stopped to look at the crack. Gillan called the scene [...] "incredibly challenging" [...] for her to perform and tried to make it [...] "truthful and believable".|$|E
500|$|Chibnall {{was elected}} by {{executive}} producers Steven Moffat and Piers Wenger to write a two-part episode about {{the return of the}} Silurians. Chibnall wanted [...] "Cold Blood" [...] in particular to be about the mistakes people make under pressure, and conflict that could come out of protecting a family. The episode is also connected to the series' story arc, as <b>the</b> <b>crack</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> universe returns {{at the end of the}} episode. [...] "The Hungry Earth" [...] and [...] "Cold Blood" [...] were filmed in October and November 2009, with scenes in [...] "Cold Blood" [...] shot in Llanwynno, Wales, Cardiff's Temple of Peace, Plantasia, and an array of locations and sets for parts of the Silurian city, which the production team did not want to look like a cave. The episode was watched by 7.49 million viewers in the United Kingdom and received mixed reviews from critics. Some reviewers were disappointed by the plot and characteristics of the Silurians, but the emotional ending was widely praised.|$|E

50|$|An {{incident}} {{shear wave}} may enter an anisotropic medium from an isotropic media by encountering a change <b>in</b> <b>the</b> preferred orientation or {{character of the}} medium. When a polarized shear wave enters a new, anisotropic medium, it splits into two shear waves (Fig.2).One of these shear waves will be faster than the other and oriented parallel to <b>the</b> <b>cracks</b> or crystals <b>in</b> <b>the</b> medium. The second wave will be slower than the first and sometimes orthogonal to both the first shear wave and <b>the</b> <b>cracks</b> or crystals <b>in</b> <b>the</b> media. The time delays observed between the slow and fast shear waves give information about <b>the</b> density of <b>cracks</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> medium.
