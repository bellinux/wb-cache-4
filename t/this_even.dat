5|$|Newnes {{stipulated that}} Borchgrevink's {{expedition}} must sail under the British flag, and be styled the British Antarctic Expedition. Borchgrevink readily agreed to <b>this,</b> <b>even</b> though {{only two of}} the entire expedition party were British. This increased the hostility and contempt of Markham, who chastised RGS librarian Hugh Robert Mill for attending the Southern Cross Expedition launch.|$|E
5|$|On 1 January 1960 French Cameroun gained {{independence}} from France under President Ahmadou Ahidjo. On 1 October 1961, the formerly British Southern Cameroons united with French Cameroun {{to form the}} Federal Republic of Cameroon. Ahidjo used the ongoing war with the UPC to concentrate power in the presidency, continuing with <b>this</b> <b>even</b> after {{the suppression of the}} UPC in 1971.|$|E
5|$|The {{head of this}} {{association}} of delinquents, Mussolini, while yellow with rancour and fear and trying to cross the Swiss frontier, has been arrested.

He would deserve to be killed like a mangy dog.|$|E

5|$|Hand's civil {{instincts}} were at {{odds with}} the duty of a judge to stay aloof from politics. As a judge he respected even bad laws; as a member of society he felt free to question the decisions behind legislation. In his opinion, members of a democratic society should be involved in legislative decision-making. He therefore regarded toleration as a prerequisite of civil liberty. In practice, <b>this</b> <b>even</b> meant that those who wish to promote ideas repugnant to the majority should be free to do so, within broad limits.|$|E
5|$|In early June 1940 {{following}} the lightning {{advance of the}} Germans through France and the subsequent Dunkirk evacuation, the British prime minister, Winston Churchill, realised the need for Britain to maintain some form of offensive action and directed his chief staff officer and military adviser, General Hastings Ismay, to begin organising a force which could conduct raids {{along the coast of}} German-occupied Europe. Shortly after <b>this,</b> <b>even</b> before the concept had been fully developed, the War Office put out a request for volunteers among the troops in Britain to join a force they would be known as the Commandos. At this stage it was decided to create 12 commando units, each with an establishment of roughly 500 men.|$|E
5|$|In his book, German Architecture in China, Warner Torsten {{writes of}} the cathedral: According to residents] the cathedral {{is far too}} large for the scale of Qingdao. Its {{position}} {{on top of a}} hill makes <b>this</b> <b>even</b> more evident. Perhaps the idea was to produce a powerful building to hold its own with the Protestant Church, which for 20 years had been the largest religious building in Qingdao, or perhaps the intention was to outstrip the 46metre-high towers of the Franciscan church in Jinan. The towers of the cathedral in Qingdao were higher than all the other churches in the major cities of Northern China– Tianjin, Beijing, Dalian, or Jinan. They dominate the silhouette of Qingdao; they are particularly impressive from a ship entering the harbour.|$|E

5|$|Most vertebrates—the amphibians, the {{reptiles}} {{and some}} mammals such as humans and bears—are plantigrade, {{walking on the}} whole of the underside of the foot. Many mammals, such as cats and dogs, are digitigrade, walking on their toes, the greater stride length allowing more speed. Digitigrade mammals are also often adept at quiet movement. Some animals such as horses are unguligrade, walking on the tips of their toes. <b>This</b> <b>even</b> further increases their stride length and thus their speed. A few mammals, namely the great apes, are also known to walk on their knuckles, at least for their front legs. Giant anteaters and platypuses are also knuckle-walkers. Some mammals are bipeds, using only two limbs for locomotion, which can be seen in, for example, humans and the great apes. Bipedal species have a larger field of vision than quadrupeds, conserve more energy and have the ability to manipulate objects with their hands, which aids in foraging. Instead of walking, some bipeds hop, such as kangaroos and kangaroo rats.|$|E
5|$|The severed head of Aravan is {{a common}} motif in Draupadi's temples. Often it is a {{portable}} wooden head; sometimes <b>this</b> <b>even</b> has its own shrine in the temple complex. Icons of Aravan's head are also often placed on the corners and edges of Draupadi temple roofs. As a pey or bhuta (spirit), Aravan acts as a guardian against other spirits, for the temple itself, and also for the Patukalam ceremony. Patukalam, in the Draupadi cult, is the symbolic ground on which the Mahabharata war is ritually re-enacted. In the taluks of Thajavur, Kumbhakonam and Pattukkotai, Aravan's head is enshrined permanently in a mandapa or within a temple niche. The largest known Aravan head is found at the Hajiyar Teru temple in Kumbhakonam.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to the UCC, the bilateral treaties the USSR concluded with several countries, amongst them also two Western countries, made works of nationals of these countries eligible for copyright in the Soviet Union, even works published before May 27, 1973.

25|$|However, {{players are}} rarely {{selected}} purely {{because of their}} fielding skills, and all players are expected to win {{their place in the}} team as either a specialist batsman or bowler (or both). <b>This</b> <b>even</b> applies to wicket keepers, who are generally expected to be competent middle-order batsmen, where more than one wicketkeeper can be selected to play as an on-field substitution. Some wicketkeepers may also be called on to bowl.|$|E

25|$|Despite their {{political}} affiliations both in favour and against Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, all opinion polls conducted throughout the campaigning process put Erdoğan {{in the lead}} by wide margins. <b>This</b> <b>even</b> included a poll by the CHP itself, which also put Erdoğan marginally ahead of Ekmeleddin İhsanoğlu. Opinion polls have also been criticised for inaccurate predictions.

25|$|We {{know our}} human bodies have {{boundaries}} and occupy space, {{the same way}} other objects known only through our named senses do. Though we seldom think of our body as a physical object, we know even before reflection that it shares some of an object's properties.

25|$|Despite <b>this,</b> <b>even</b> as the XC-123 proved successful, the XC-123A {{failed to}} win {{sufficient}} favor in flight testing to receive a production order. Although the aircraft's short-field performance was good, on rough, unimproved fields the low-slung jet pods would suck debris into the intakes, damaging the engines. In addition, the aircraft's design was mismatched to its engines, resulting in the XC-123A being incapable of providing sufficient cargo capacity compared {{to the amount of}} fuel its jet engines required. As a result, the XC-123A project was abandoned without additional aircraft being built.|$|E
