500|$|In [...] "Where Life Begins", Madonna {{promises}} to teach [...] "a {{different kind of}} kiss" [...] to the listener. In the song, Madonna talks about the pleasures of oral sex and also references safe-sex. The sixth track is [...] "Bad Girl". It talks {{about a woman who}} would rather get drunk than end a relationship she is too neurotic to handle. The seventh song, [...] "Waiting", {{has been described as a}} [...] "yearning ballad." [...] Featuring spoken words, it addresses rejection and unrequited love. It ends with lyrics [...] "The next <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> pussy, just look in the mirror, baby." [...] The next track, [...] "Thief of Hearts", is a dark and rumbling song. It uses tough hip-hop language to ward off a rival for her lover's attention. It opens with the smashing of a glass, and Madonna shouting, [...] "Bitch!/Which leg do you want me to break?" [...] and later, she sneers, [...] "Little miss thinks she can have his child/Well anybody can do it." [...] "Words" [...] was compared to the previous track [...] "Thief of Hearts," [...] with music critics finding similarity in scope, each with sharp lyrics and catchy beats. The song features clattering programs and icy synth block-chords.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to stylistic touches, the episode established several narrative motifs that stayed with Homicide: Life on the Street throughout {{the duration of}} the series. Among them was the white board where detectives kept the names of their open cases in red and their closed cases in black. The names of NBC employees and friends of the Homicide crew were used on the white board. The episode was noted for its deliberate lack of gunplay and car chases in favor of dialogue and story. Levinson and Fontana also allowed humor to be incorporated into the show, particularly through the interactions between the detectives; Levinson said of the first episode, [...] "We have to inform the audience, but at the same <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to do it {{with a sense of humor}} so you don't seem too pretentious, in a way." [...] Several long-standing character traits were established in [...] "Gone for Goode", including Kay Howard's extraordinary streak of solved cases and the antagonism between Felton and Pembleton, which is demonstrated when the two argue loudly after being assigned to a case together. The animosity between Felton and Pembleton is based on the real-life Detective Donald Kincaid, who was the inspiration behind Felton, and the strong dislike Kincaid had for Harry Edgerton, as chronicled in Homicide: A Year on the Killing Streets. Howard's perfect streak is based on a similar (although shorter) lucky streak experienced by the real-life Detective Rich Garvey, who is also featured in David Simon's book.|$|E

5000|$|Rachel Alexandra had a {{different}} personality than her dam. [...] "Lotta Kim had a terrible disposition," [...] Wiggins recalled. [...] "She wasn't really mean, but plumb ornery. She made it a project every <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> {{to do something with}} her. Completely the opposite from Rachel Alexandra. I don't know what you could do to get Rachel Alexandra excited, except go into the starting gate." ...|$|R

50|$|Each one attacks {{a certain}} amount of times, then has to recharge. While the bar is green the option attacks, until it turns entirely red (as the option is attacking).
