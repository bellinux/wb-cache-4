In 2007, she authored successful bipartisan legislation with Senator Gordon Smith to combat HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis globally. In 1997, she authored a Patients' Bill of Rights. She has written a bill to make health insurance tax-deductible and one to let any American buy into the same health insurance program <b>that</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> have. She supports comprehensive prescription drug coverage through Medicare and the right of all consumers to purchase lower-cost prescription drugs re-imported from Canada.|$|E
500|$|On February 26, 2010, the Ethics Committee {{issued its}} report. [...] It {{determined}} that Rangel had violated House gift rules, by accepting reimbursement for his {{travel to the}} conferences. [...] It found {{that he had not}} known of the contributions, but concluded that he was still responsible for them and was required to repay their cost. [...] Five other members were cleared of having violated rules, but were also required to repay their trips. [...] Rangel disagreed with the committee's finding, saying: Because they were my staff members who knew, one of whom has been discharged, [...] that I should have known. Common sense dictates <b>that</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> should not be held responsible for what could be the wrongdoing, or mistakes, or errors of staff.|$|E
500|$|In {{his notes}} of the Philadelphia Convention in 1787, James Madison {{expressed}} the fear <b>that</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> would create new federal jobs, or increase the salaries for existing jobs, and then take those jobs for themselves. Madison wrote that corrupt legislative actions, {{in the form of}} the unnecessary creation of offices and the increase of salaries for personal benefit, were one of his greatest concerns. The delegates who were present agreed that no member of Congress should be eligible to be appointed to an executive position while serving in Congress. Madison originally proposed a one-year length on such a bar. However, Nathaniel Gorham, James Wilson, and Alexander Hamilton wanted no bar at all at the conclusion of congressional service. Eventually, Madison proposed a compromise: [...] "that no office ought to be open to a member, which may be created or augmented while he is in the legislature"; this led to extensive debate.|$|E

500|$|Borah was not {{personally}} harmed by {{the stock market}} crash of October 1929, having sold any stocks and invested in government bonds. [...] Thousands of Americans had borrowed on margin, and were ruined by the crash. [...] Congress in June 1930 passed the Hawley–Smoot Tariff, [...] sharply increasing rates on imports. [...] Borah was one of 12 Republicans who joined Democrats in opposing the bill, which passed the Senate 44–42. Borah was up for election in 1930, and despite a minimal campaign effort, took over 70percent of the vote in a bad year for Republicans. When he returned to Washington for the lame-duck session of the Senate beginning in December, Borah pressed the passage of legislation that would help business and suggested <b>that</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> turn back their salary to the Treasury. The economy continued to worsen in the winter of 1931, and Borah urged relief legislation, stating that opponents argued [...] "that for the Government to feed this woman and her sick children would destroy her self respect and make a bad citizen of her. [...] Does anyone believe it? It is a cowardly imputation on the helpless. [...] I resent it and I repudiate it." ...|$|E

2500|$|Nevertheless, the Supreme Court {{has treated}} {{campaign}} contributions {{as a free}} speech issue.

[...] Few members retire from Congress without complaining about {{how much it costs}} to campaign for reelection. Critics contend <b>that</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> are more likely to attend to the needs of heavy campaign contributors than to ordinary citizens.|$|E

2500|$|In December 2006, Nelson made {{a trip to}} Syria {{to visit}} President Bashar Assad in Damascus. At the time, the Bush Administration had a no contact policy with Syrian {{officials}} because [...] "of its support of Hezbollah and Hamas, which the U.S. deems terrorist organizations". The White House press secretary commented on the trip saying, [...] "We don't think <b>that</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> ought to be going there". The State Department also disapproved of the trip, but provided logistical support to Nelson.|$|E
2500|$|The Court {{expressed}} a worry <b>that</b> <b>Members</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> might {{take credit for}} “solving” a problem with policies that impose all the financial and administrative burden, {{as well as the}} blame, on local officials. The Court quoted Federalist No. 51’s argument that by giving voters control over dual sovereign governments “a double security arises to the rights of the people. [...] The different governments will control each other, at the same that each will be controlled by itself.” The Court concluded that allowing the Federal government to draft the police officers of the 50 states into its service would increase its powers far beyond what the Constitution intends.|$|E

Wade and Harris discussed MZM's desire for a $10million appropriation, and Wade offered to host a fundraiser for Harris's 2006 Senate campaign. Regarding the MZM contributions, the Sentinel article goes on to say [...] "The Justice Department has said Wade, who personally handed many of the checks to Harris, did not tell Harris the contributions were illegal". Regarding the expensive meal, the article quotes Harris as saying that she personally had only a [...] "beverage and appetizer" [...] worth less than [...] "$100".|$|E

50|$|However, {{before the}} 1942 general election, President Roosevelt issued an order as {{commander-in-chief}} <b>that</b> forced <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> {{serving in the}} military to resign from one position or the other.

2500|$|Levitt's 1994 {{paper on}} {{campaign}} spending employs a unique identification strategy {{to control for}} the quality of each candidate (which in previous work had led to an overstatement of the true effect). It concludes that campaign spending has a very small impact on election outcomes, regardless of who does the spending. On the subject of federal spending and elections, previous empirical studies were not able to establish <b>that</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> are rewarded by the electorate for bringing federal dollars to their district because of omitted variables bias. [...] Levitt and Snyder (1997) employ an instrument which circumvents this problem and finds evidence that federal spending benefits congressional incumbents; they find that an additional $100 per capita spending is worth as much as 2 percent of the popular vote.|$|E
2500|$|In a 2013 {{interview}} with Martha Raddatz of ABC News, Greenwald said <b>that</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> are being [...] "blocked" [...] from getting [...] "the most basic {{information about what}} NSA is doing... and what the FISA court has been doing....", and specifically referenced Rep. Dutch Ruppersberger (D-MD), a ranking member of the United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence ("House Intelligence Committee"). Ruppersberger, who was a guest on the show, responded, [...] "We have rules {{as far as the}} committee and what you can have and what you cannot have. However, based on that, that statement I just made, is that since this incident occurred with Snowden, we've had three different hearings for members of our Democratic Caucus, and the Republican Caucus.... And we will continue to do that because what we're trying to do now is to get the American public to know more about what's going on." [...] Rep. King, who was also a guest on This Week as a ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, stated: [...] "o me it's unprecedented to have all of these top people from an administration during this time of crisis still come in and answer question after question after question. So anyone who says that Congress is somehow being stonewalled is just wrong and [...] is generally, I think, raised by {{people who are trying to}} make a name for themselves." ...|$|E
2500|$|The gay {{and lesbian}} rights {{movement}} in the 1970s and 1980s raised the issue by publicizing several noteworthy dismissals of gay service members. Sgt. Leonard Matlovich appeared {{on the cover of}} Time in 1975. In 1982 the Department of Defense issued a policy stating that, [...] "Homosexuality is incompatible with military service." [...] It cited the military's need [...] "to maintain discipline, good order, and morale" [...] and [...] "to prevent breaches of security". In 1988, in response to a campaign against lesbians at the Marines' Parris Island Depot, activists launched the Gay and Lesbian Military Freedom Project (MFP) to advocate {{for an end to the}} exclusion of gays and lesbians from the armed forces. In 1989, reports commissioned by the Personnel Security Research and Education Center (PERSEREC), an arm of the Pentagon, were discovered in the process of Joseph Steffan's lawsuit fighting his forced resignation from the U.S. Naval Academy. One report said that [...] "having a same-gender or an opposite-gender orientation is unrelated to job performance in the same way as is being left- or right-handed." [...] Other lawsuits fighting discharges highlighted the service record of service members like Tracey Thorne and Margarethe (Grethe) Cammermeyer. The MFP began lobbying Congress in 1990, and in 1991 Senator Brock Adams (D-Washington) and Rep. Barbara Boxer introduced the Military Freedom Act, legislation to end the ban completely. Adams and Rep. Pat Schroeder (D-Colorado) re-introduced it the next year. In July 1991, Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney, in the context of the outing of his press aide Pete Williams, dismissed the idea that gays posed a security risk as [...] "a bit of an old chestnut" [...] in testimony before the House Budget Committee. In response to his comment, several major newspapers endorsed ending the ban, including USA Today, the Los Angeles Times, and the Detroit Free Press. In June 1992, the General Accounting Office released a report <b>that</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> had requested two years earlier estimating the costs associated with the ban on gays and lesbians in the military at $27 million annually.|$|E

Others point out <b>that</b> <b>Members</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> have {{what is called a}} [...] "fair-share deal" [...] as they do not bear the entire risk of increased costs because of health care inflation. The health care plan <b>that</b> <b>Members</b> <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> use indexes benefits to health care inflation, not the consumer price index.
