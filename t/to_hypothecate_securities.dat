50|$|The {{main purpose}} of {{hypothecation}} is to mitigate the creditor's credit risk. If the debtor cannot pay, the creditor possesses the collateral and therefore can claim its ownership, sell it and thus compensate the lacking cash inflows. In a default of the obligor without previous hypothecation, the creditor cannot be sure that it can seize sufficient assets of the debtor. Because hypothecation {{makes it easier to}} get the debt and potentially decreases its price; the debtor wants <b>to</b> <b>hypothecate</b> as much debt as possible - but the isolation of 'good assets' for the collateral worsens the quality {{of the rest of the}} debtor's balance sheet and thus its credit quality.|$|R
40|$|Welfare {{spending}} in the UK is too low to provide services at a level to which most citizens aspire. Politicians generally {{do not believe that}} people {{would be willing to pay}} higher taxes for better services. Recent theoretical work in political science argues that trust in state institutions is in decline and, in sociology, that citizens are becoming more independent, reflexive and keen to take responsibility for meeting their own needs. This paper uses data from a recent ESRC-financed national survey to examine some of the recent arguments seeking to justify the claim that more tax is electorally unfeasible. It shows that support for extra spending is not confined <b>to</b> <b>hypothecated</b> taxes for high-profile services such as the NHS and has not been undermined by a decline in citizen trust in the welfare state or by a rejection of collective solutions...|$|R

6000|$|The trouble {{heretofore}} has been--I am quoting {{remarks of}} planters and steamboatmen--that the planters, although owning the land, were without cash capital; had <b>to</b> <b>hypothecate</b> both land and crop {{to carry on}} the business.

The planter has also to buy his supplies through the same dealer, paying commissions and profits. Then when he ships his crop, the dealer adds his commissions, insurance, etc. So, taking it by and large, and first and last, the dealer's share of that crop is about 25 per cent.'{footnote ['But what can the State do where the people are under subjection to rates of interest ranging from 18 to 30 per cent., and are also under the necessity of purchasing their crops in advance even of planting, at these rates, for the privilege of purchasing all their supplies at 100 per cent. profit?'--EDWARD ATKINSON.]} ...|$|R

Based on the results of a survey of over 300 visitors this paper investigates visitors' attitudes and perceptions towards car park charging in the CNP, and explores the conditions under which they would find charging legitimate; in particular, the notion of hypothecation (i. e. the practice of declaring where and how monies contributed will be spent). We find that the vast majority of visitors surveyed are supportive of charging but that support is conditional on: the nature of the charging system, the type of location in question, and the landowners' commitment <b>to</b> <b>hypothecating</b> user fees for reinvestment in visitor facilities and preservation of the environment. We conclude by proposing a CNP-wide charging policy, fundamentally based on the principle of hypothecation...|$|R

Though not as openly aggressive or hyper-sexual as historically, men continue to impose a significant degree of superiority over women. Violence is commonplace within Argentine society, with violence against women socialised into the population and continuing at disturbingly high levels. At present a woman is murdered by her partner every thirty hours in Argentina (Casa de Encuentro, 2015 b). Women face discrimination throughout all walks of their everyday life, no matter their wealth, class or social status.

50|$|Fuel {{taxes in}} New Zealand are {{considered}} an excise applied by the New Zealand Customs Service on shipments {{brought into the}} country. A breakdown of the fuel taxes is published by the Ministry of Economic Development. Excise as at 1 August 2012 totals 50.524 cents per litre ($1.89/imperial gal; $1.58/US gal) on petrol. In addition the national compulsory Accident Compensation Corporation motor vehicle account receives a contribution of 9.9 cents/litre (37.1¢/imperial gal; 30.9¢/US gal). The ethanol component of bio blended petrol currently attracts no excise duty. This was to be reviewed in 2012. Diesel is not taxed at the pump, but road users with vehicles over 3.5 tonne in Gross Laden Weight and any vehicles not powered wholly by any combination of petrol, LPG or CNG must pay the Road User Charge instead. The Goods and Services Tax (15%) is then applied to the combined total {{of the value of}} the commodity and the various taxes.

The case of the 185 -km Gauteng Freeway Improvement Project in the Johannesburg-Pretoria area of South Africa offers an opportunity to empirically examine the equity impacts of large scale road pricing in middle-income countries. The paper reports on the novel use of GPS data from multiple sources to assess the distribution of benefits and costs of electronic tolling across passenger and freight users. GPS data from commercial truck fleets are combined with multiday GPS tracks from a panel of private vehicle drivers to derive measures of user benefit by class. Compared <b>to</b> an alternative <b>hypothecated</b> fuel tax, electronic tolling is more progressive {{in terms of both}} income and vehicle class, as it transfers costs from private to commercial vehicles, in line with the greater pavement damage caused by trucks.

Second, did being born near a city, whose markets sucked away foodstuffs, lead to stunting? Third, did child labour lead to stunting? We find that only those born in very large cities suffered a level of stunting that contemporaries could have observed. Being born near a city, which gave parents opportunities to trade away family calories, and perhaps increased exposure to disease, did not cause stunting. Britain was a well-integrated market; all families, whatever their locations, had options to trade and faced similar disease environments. Finally, although adults {{who had gone to}} sea young were shorter {{than those who did not}} enlist until fully grown, going to sea did not stunt.

30|$|Household {{access to}} credit is an {{important}} resilience factor in eastern India. For many households borrowing money is a major coping strategy during and after times of drought. In addition to what kind of security can be presented by a household, the determining factor {{of what kind of}} credit conditions a household has access to is its social networks and reputation within the village community. In the sphere of formal institutions, there is credit raising from the State Bank of India. For subsistence farmers who own land and have proof of this {{in the form of a}} land title, the interest rate per annum (pa) is 12 %, if the land functions as security for the credit. Households have potential access to this form of credit, if they own enough land for security. The land quality and fertility has to be sufficient <b>to</b> be <b>hypothecated</b> and a formal land property title is necessary. If formal credit raising fails, households are dependent on borrowing money based on informal institutions. Some households are in the position to borrow money from a relative outside the village, usually without interest to be paid. The rest of the informal sphere is dominated by local traders, whose interest rates are much higher than those of formal moneylenders. If the household can present a certain amount of gold as security, mostly in the form of jewelry worn by women, the interest rate is 3 % per month (pm); resulting in 36 % pa, if the interest is paid regularly each month. The situation for the household is worse if only agricultural tools or animals can be presented as security. In this case, an interest rate of 5 % pm/ 60 % pa has to be paid. However, particularly during droughts some households cannot present any security like gold, tools, or animals because they have already been sold to buy food. If no security is presented, the credit relation is based on trust and the borrower has to be known to the trader. The interest rate in that case is 10 % pm/ 120 % pa. To be dependent on such credits has to be seen as a sign of low social resilience. In the short term, these credits might help to cope with drought, but research indicates that, in the long term, they very often lead into overindebtedness (Jülich 2015). Such excessive indebtedness depletes future options for development and, as a consequence, the {{access to credit}} determines the risk of overindebtedness that comes with certain credit conditions and affects resilience. Credits by the State Bank of India, by traders with 3 % pm interest, and credit from relatives bear a relatively low risk of overindebting, at least compared to the other alternatives present in the region.|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} review of the {{possible}} sources for r-process nuclei (r-nuclei). It is known that there is as yet no self-consistent mechanism to provide abundant neutrons for a robust r-process in the neutrino-driven winds from nascent neutron stars. We consider that the heavy r-nuclei with mass numbers A> 130 (Ba and above) cannot be produced in the neutrino-driven winds. Nonetheless, the r-process and the neutrino-driven winds may be directly or indirectly related by some unknown additional mechanism, which, for example, could provide ejecta with very short dynamic timescales of ≾ 0. 004 s. This undetermined mechanism must supply a neutron source within the same general stellar sites that undergo core collapse to produce the neutron star. Observational data on low-metallicity stars in the Galactic halo show that sites producing the heavy r-nuclei do not produce Fe or any other elements between N and Ge. Insofar as a forming neutron star is key to producing the heavy r-nuclei, then the only possible sources are supernovae resulting from collapse of O–Ne–Mg cores or accretion-induced collapse of white dwarfs, neither of which produce the elements of the Fe group or those of intermediate mass (above C and N). Observational evidence on s and r-nuclei in low-metallicity stars with high C and N abundances shows that the r-process is also active in binary systems. The nuclei with A∼ 90 – 110 produced by charged-particle reactions (CPR) in the neutrino-driven winds are in general present in metal-poor stars with high or low abundances of heavy r-nuclei. The CPR nuclei and the heavy r-nuclei are not strongly coupled. Some metal-poor stars show extremely high enrichments of heavy r-nuclei and have established that the abundance patterns of these nuclei are universally close to the solar abundance pattern of heavy r-nuclei. Using a template star with high enrichments of heavy r-nuclei and another with low enrichments we develop a two-component model based on the abundances of Eu (from sources for heavy r-nuclei) and Fe (from Fe core-collapse supernovae). This model gives very good quantitative predictions for the abundances of all the other elements in those metal-poor stars with [Fe/H]≲- 1. 5 for which the Eu and Fe abundances are known. We attribute the CPR elements such as Sr, Y, and Zr to reactions in the neutrino-driven winds from a nascent neutron star and the heavy r-nuclei <b>to</b> the <b>hypothecated</b> true “r-process”. The CPR nuclei should be produced whenever a neutron star is formed regardless of whether heavy r-nuclei are produced or not. Using the two-component model we estimate the yield of the CPR element Sr to be ∼ 10 ^(- 6) M_⊙ for a single neutron star formation event. Self-consistent astrophysical models are needed to establish that the CPR nuclei are common to the neutron stars produced in both sources for the heavy r-nuclei and those for Fe.

I have said that my mother's temper was irritated by disease, and her judgment impaired in proportion. She gathered spirits and force from the resentment which the priests around her bed excited by their importunity, and the boldness of the stern sect of reformers, to which she had secretly adhered, seemed to animate her dying tongue. She avowed the religion she had so long concealed; renounced all hope and aid which did not come by and through its dictates; rejected with contempt the ceremonial of the Romish church; loaded the astonished priests with reproaches for their greediness and hypocrisy, and commanded them to leave her house. They went in bitterness and rage, but it was to return with the inquisitorial power, its warrants, and its officers; and they found only the cold corpse left of her, on whom they had hoped to work their vengeance. As I was soon discovered to have shared my mother's heresy, I was dragged from her dead body, imprisoned in a solitary cloister, and treated with severity, which the Abbess assured me was due to the looseness of my life, as well as my spiritual errors. I avowed my marriage, to justify the situation in which I found myself--I implored the assistance of the Superior to communicate my situation to my husband. She smiled coldly at the proposal, and told me the church had provided a better spouse for me; advised me to secure myself of divine grace hereafter, and deserve milder treatment here, by presently taking the veil. In order to convince me that I had no other resource, she showed me a royal decree, by which all my estate was <b>hypothecated</b> <b>to</b> the convent of Saint Magdalen, and became their complete property upon my death, or my taking the vows. As I was, both from religious principle, and affectionate attachment to my husband, absolutely immovable in my rejection of the veil, I believe-- may heaven forgive me if I wrong her--that the Abbess was desirous to make sure of my spoils, by hastening the former event.|$|R
