5|$|Older Macintoshes {{dating from}} 1983 until 1998 {{utilized}} a basic bootloader; the bootloader was solely a ROM chip varying in sizes up to 4megabytes (MB), which contained both the computer code to boot {{the computer and}} to run the Mac OS operating system. This {{was known as the}} Macintosh <b>Toolbox,</b> or the Old World ROM, and differs greatly from design the modern Macintosh which generally use a hard drive of large capacity to store the operating system. This bootloader was used in all Macintosh computers until mid-1998.|$|E
5|$|With {{the advent}} of printing, poets gained greater control over the mass-produced visual presentations of their work. Visual {{elements}} have become {{an important part of}} the poet's <b>toolbox,</b> and many poets have sought to use visual presentation for a wide range of purposes. Some Modernist poets have made the placement of individual lines or groups of lines on the page an integral part of the poem's composition. At times, this complements the poem's rhythm through visual caesuras of various lengths, or creates juxtapositions so as to accentuate meaning, ambiguity or irony, or simply to create an aesthetically pleasing form. In its most extreme form, this can lead to concrete poetry or asemic writing.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In 1998 the Australian National Training Authority (ANTA) {{undertook}} {{a commitment to}} develop a range of web-based learning resources for the Vocational Education and Training (VET) sector. The result {{is a collection of}} resources, suggested learning strategies and supporting material known as <b>Toolboxes.</b> While <b>toolboxes</b> have provided a quality resource for online learners, they have not always been accessible to learners with a disability. In recognition of this ANTA, in conjunction with the Australian Flexible Learning Framework (AFL), has selected three of the <b>toolboxes</b> currently being developed to conform to the World Wide Web Consortium (W 3 C) Web Content Accessibility Priority 1 Guidelines. WestOne Services, in conjunction with Challenger TAFE and WestCoast College of TAFE, is currently developing two of these ANTA <b>toolboxes.</b> The <b>toolboxes</b> are a work-in-progress examining the tools and techniques {{that can be used to}} facilitate the implementation of accessible learning resources...|$|R

The techniques are {{implemented in the}} system identification and model reduction <b>toolboxes</b> based on the Fortran 77 Subroutine Library in Control Theory (SLICOT). Besides highly performant Fortran drivers and computational routines, these <b>toolboxes</b> provide MATLAB or Scilab interfaces, implementing several algorithmic approaches. Extensive numerical testing and comparisons with similar MATLAB tools show that the solvers in these <b>toolboxes</b> are reliable, efficient, and able to solve industrially relevant problems.

5|$|Marge forbids Bart and Lisa from {{watching}} the Itchy & Scratchy Halloween special, removing the batteries from the remote control. When Marge leaves, Bart finds plutonium in Homer's <b>toolbox</b> and hammers {{it into the}} remote's battery slot. When they use the remote, the kids enter the world of Itchy and Scratchy. Bart and Lisa are soon hunted by Itchy and Scratchy. Back in the Simpson house, Homer enters {{the living room and}} watches the show. Oblivious to what he sees, Homer decides to change the channel, and Bart, Lisa, Itchy, and Scratchy wind up on Live with Regis and Kathie Lee. They end up back at Itchy's house and urge Homer from inside the TV to use the remote to get them out, who eventually succeeds in doing so. Unfortunately, Itchy and Scratchy also escape. At first, the family is scared, but realize how small the two characters are and decide to keep them as pets.|$|E
5|$|On the February 18, 2010 {{episode of}} Impact!, Tara {{defeated}} Daffney by disqualification, after she hit Tara with a <b>toolbox.</b> At Destination X, Tara successfully defended her title against Daffney, who stole Poison the tarantula from her after the match. On the March 29 episode of Impact!, Tara retained her title against Daffney {{for a second}} time, {{this time in the}} first ever women's First Blood match in TNA. On the April 5 episode of Impact!, Tara was one of the four winners in an eight-Knockout Lockbox match. The box she opened contained her pet tarantula, Poison. At the same time, however, Tara lost the Knockouts Championship to Angelina Love. After losing the title, Tara began turning villainous due to her friction with Love heading into their match against The Beautiful People (Madison Rayne and Velvet Sky). At Lockdown, Tara cemented her heel turn by attacking Love after losing a tag team steel cage match against Rayne and Sky.|$|E
5|$|Variations in the toolkit {{may have}} {{produced}} {{a large part of}} the morphological evolution of animals. The toolkit can drive evolution in two ways. A toolkit gene can be expressed in a different pattern, as when the beak of Darwin's large ground-finch was enlarged by the BMP gene, or when snakes lost their legs as distal-less became under-expressed or not expressed at all in the places where other reptiles continued to form their limbs. Or, a toolkit gene can acquire a new function, as seen in the many functions of that same gene, distal-less, which controls such diverse structures as the mandible in vertebrates, legs and antennae in the fruit fly, and eyespot pattern in butterfly wings. Given that small changes in <b>toolbox</b> genes can cause significant changes in body structures, they have often enabled the same function convergently or in parallel. distal-less generates wing patterns in the butterflies Heliconius erato and Heliconius melpomene, which are Müllerian mimics. In so-called facilitated variation, their wing patterns arose in different evolutionary events, but are controlled by the same genes. Developmental changes can contribute directly to speciation.|$|E

A worst-case scenario is that an application in the Blue Box crashes, taking down the entire Blue Box instance with it.

This paper reports on the accuracy obtained with the two MATLAB <b>Toolboxes,</b> when used with idealized noisy data, and also on their performance when used with real measurement data The performance of the curve-fitting algorithms on two commercial FFT analyzers is also compared using two applications for illustration. It is found that while the MATLAB <b>Toolboxes</b> perform almost equally well when used in the applications examined, the hardware analyzers are less comparable. One of the analyzers gives reliable results, but results from the other can prove quite difficult to interpret in the noise-free case, and can be erroneous when a comparatively small amount of noise is present on the measured output signal...|$|R

40|$|Integrated camera {{systems for}} {{increasing}} safety and maneuverability {{are becoming increasingly}} common for heavy vehicles.

The solution covers both hardware choices and software development including camera calibration and image stitching. Two different fisheye camera calibration <b>toolboxes</b> are compared and their results discussed, with the aim to find the most suitable for this application. The result from the two <b>toolboxes</b> differ in performance, and the result from only one of the <b>toolboxes</b> is sufficient for image stitching. ...|$|R
