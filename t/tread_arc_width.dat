30|$|Evidence for {{multiple}} scales in aurora come from satellite and ground-based measurements. The outer scale {{is the so-called}} inverted-V structure, typically about 100  km wide when measured by a low-orbiting satellite. Ground-based optical and radar measurements often see auroral <b>arcs</b> with <b>widths</b> of some tens of kilometres (e.g. Knudsen et al. 2001). Structures at 1 km and 100 m scales are also seen (Partamies et al. 2010), and ground-based optical measurements have revealed <b>arc</b> <b>widths</b> down to tens of metres (Maggs and Davis 1968). Large- and medium-scale arcs are often associated with a potential difference between the ionosphere and the magnetosphere, accelerating the electrons into the ionosphere (Mozer et al. 1980; Carlson et al. 1998). How the potential drop develops and to which magnetospheric processes it is related continues to be unclear (e.g. Borovsky 1993). The origin of narrow auroral arcs is even less understood, {{even though it has}} been suggested that Alfvén waves could account for some of the structures (e.g. Keiling 2009).|$|R

Study subjects: Thirty-six consecutive {{patients with chronic}} thromboembolic PH (CTEPH), 38 with primary PH (PPH), and 37 with left heart disease and PH. Methods: CXRs were reviewed about 6 features (left 2 nd arc protrusion, right descending pulmonary artery diameter (rPAD), cardiothoracic ratio (CTR), right 2 nd <b>arc</b> <b>width,</b> avascular area and pleural abnormality). Hemodynamic data {{and the degree of}} tricuspid regurgitation (TR) on echocardiography were compared with CXR findings. Results: The diagnostic pattern of CTEPH was the presence of one of two findings, an avascular area or marked rPAD (> 20 mm) together with pleuritic change. The diagnostic pattern of PPH was one of the two features; without pleuritic abnormality, marked left 2 nd arc protrusion (> 10 mm) or moderate left 2 nd arc protrusion (5 – 10 mm) with marked rPAD (< 20 mm). The sensitivity for the diagnosis of CTEPH among the three diseases was 78 % and specificity was 92 %. The sensitivity for the diagnosis of PPH was 45 % and specificity was 88 %.

FAST registered eight auroral arcs with the associated upward currents and two periods of downward currents during the crossing time of five minutes. All arcs were moving equatorward with speeds near 300 m/s. Some of them exhibited local broadening and subsequent unfolding. Most remarkable was the appearance of new arcs at the poleward border of the auroral oval, clearly marked by an Alfvénic arc. The FAST data on energy and energy flux of the precipitating electrons and the jumps of the transverse magnetic perturbation field through the arcs were evaluated for five of the arcs following the formalism of Haerendel [2007]. This led to very consistent values for the integral wave impedance, field-parallel conductance, Alfvénic transit time, <b>arc</b> <b>width,</b> proper motion, and total energy release including the ionospheric dissipation.

We find that the capability of the numerically modeled clusters to produce long arcs is larger by about two orders of magnitude than that of spherically symmetric cluster models with the same observable parameters (core radii and velocity dispersions), {{and that they are}} similarly efficient as singular isothermal spheres with the same velocity-dispersion distribution.

A thorough examination of the machine design shows a reasonable agreement between design specifications and measured outcomes after accounting for a 10 % decrease in permanent magnet remanence. The unique property of the AFM whereby mechanical flux weakening is achieved via air gap adjustment is investigated, focusing on the resulting change in several important machine parameters. The effect of an air gap distance increase from 1 mm to 4 mm is confirmed to reduce the machine constant by 36 %. 2 D Transient FEA shows that the minimum in cogging torque occurs at a magnet <b>arc</b> <b>width</b> of 128. 2 °e at a nominal air gap distance of 2 mm. 3 D FEA confirms the fact that a significant radial flux component exists in both the rotor and stator under stalled conditions.

In our events the mean <b>arc</b> <b>width</b> is ~[*] 0.33 ° or ~[*] 18.5  km in terms of halfwidth. We make a rough estimate by extrapolating Fang et al.’s given examples and infer that, for an arc halfwidth of 18  km the incident proton flux might be reduced to ~[*] 36 %. In other words, the proton flux on top of the ionosphere is expected to be roughly 3 times as large as that after the spatial spreading. Assuming that the proton auroral intensity is proportional to the proton/hydrogen flux attenuated by the spatial spreading, since our observation indicates that the proton aurora averaged over the arc band is mostly within ~[*] 10 % of its mean late-growth-phase value, the variation of the arc-related ion precipitation flux from the CPS (before the spatial spreading) is likely within ~[*] 30 % of its mean late-growth-phase value, according to the above considerations. In comparison, the ion precipitation flux during a substorm dipolarization typically increases by several times (Gilson et al. 2012). It is key to note that, the spatial spreading effect of proton auroras applies to both the growth phase and the TSSO. Since we have noticed that the proton auroral variations are comparable in magnitude during the late growth phase and during the TSSO, our inference that the TSSO appears not to add much contribution to the arc-related ion precipitation flux still holds. To summarize, {{while it is true that}} the actual variation level of the ion precipitation flux in the CPS might be somehow higher than that reflected in proton auroras when the spatial spreading effect is considered, our main conclusions are not qualitatively altered.|$|R
40|$|Sun-aligned (SA) arcs are a {{prevalent}} {{feature of}} the polar cap ionosphere during northward interplanetary magnetic field conditions. These arcs are, like the auroral arc, a complex electrodynamic system coupling the ionosphere and magnetosphere. The electron precipitation and convection electric field associated with this system modify the polar cap ionospheric plasma distribution. In the past decade, a wealth of observational information has indicated the complexity of these ionospheric modifications, but {{only a limited number}} of model studies have been carried out to elucidate the changes associated with SA arcs. In this investigation, an extensive parametric study has been conducted to identify and order these ionospheric modifications. Specifically, we are interested in modeling the local evolution and decay of ionospheric modification due to a source consisting of an idealized, though representative, SA arc structure. The Utah State University time-dependent ionospheric model (TDIM) has been used to define the ionospheric physics and its dependencies on both solar cycle and season. An SA arc model has been developed. This model enables one to systematically vary the key arc parameters; electric field strength, width, electron precipitation energy flux, and electron precipitation characteristic energy. Our findings indicate that the changes associated with the E and F regions are quite different. F region structures have relatively long lifetimes and are significantly affected by transport. This leads to a significant role for cross-arc convection. The E region is much less affected by transport due to short chemical recombination times and thus, E region modifications are confined to the arc structure itself where precipitation and enhanced electric fields are present. Furthermore, the response of the F region to changes in the arc parameters is not linear, and the largest ionospheric modifications occur for intermediate <b>arc</b> <b>widths</b> and electric field strengths. An important indicator of F region modification is the total electron content (TEC) for flux tubes convecting through SA arc structures. The magnitude and variation of the TEC enhancement with various arc parameters can be an important indicator of real processes which are occurring in the arc structure. In addition to TEC we examine the variation of Te, Ti, Ne, ΣP, and ΣH for various arc parameters...|$|R
