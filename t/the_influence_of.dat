Finite element simulation model of non-circular spinning {{for the three}} straight-edge round-corner cross-section (TSRC) hollow-part was established.

The basis of this study is the base on commitment-trust theory with <b>the</b> <b>influences</b> <b>of</b> consumers’ satisfaction with the micro-blog page of enterprises, corporate images, commitment, trust, and sense of community on consumers’ behavioral intention. The result of this study can be used as principles for enterprises to manage their relationship marketing through micro-blogging and construct their micro-blog page. The result of this study shows that consumers’ satisfaction has positive influences on commitment, trust, sense of community, and behavioral intentions. <b>The</b> <b>influences</b> <b>of</b> corporate images on commitment and trust are supported, but <b>the</b> <b>influences</b> on behavioral intentions must go through the mediators, commitment and trust. <b>The</b> <b>influences</b> <b>of</b> trust on commitment and sense of community exist, but <b>the</b> <b>influences</b> on behavioral intentions must go through the mediators, commitment and sense <b>of</b> community.
