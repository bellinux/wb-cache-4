25|$|Jenkem is a {{supposed}} inhalant and hallucinogen created from fermented human waste. In the mid-1990s, {{it was reported}} to be a popular street drug among Zambian street children. They would put the feces and urine in a jar and cover it with a balloon <b>then</b> <b>let</b> <b>it</b> ferment out in the sun, then afterwards they would inhale the fumes created. In November 2007, there was a moral panic in the United States after widespread reports of jenkem becoming a popular recreational drug in middle and high schools, though the true extent of the practice has since been called into question. Several sources reported that the increase in American media coverage was based on a hoax and on faulty Internet research.|$|E
25|$|Since exoskeletons are rigid, {{they present}} some limits to growth. Organisms with open shells can grow by adding new {{material}} to the aperture of their shell, {{as is the case}} in snails, bivalves and other molluscans. A true exoskeleton, like that found in arthropods, must be shed (moulted) when it is outgrown. A new exoskeleton is produced beneath the old one. As the old one is shed, the new skeleton is soft and pliable. The animal will pump itself up to expand the new shell to maximal size, <b>then</b> <b>let</b> <b>it</b> harden. When the shell has set, the empty space inside the new skeleton can be filled up as the animal eats. Failure to shed the exoskeleton once outgrown can result in the animal being suffocated within its own shell, and will stop subadults from reaching maturity, thus preventing them from reproducing. This is the mechanism behind some insect pesticides, such as Azadirachtin.|$|E

500|$|However, {{close friends}} of Grant {{saw that his}} public support was slipping. John Russell Young took Grant aside {{and told him that}} he would lose the election, and should {{withdraw}} to avoid embarrassment. Young argued that Grant was being heavily attacked by opponents, who were against the concept of a presidential third term. Young also criticized the handling of the campaign and told Grant that if he won the election, he would be indebted to the [...] "triumvirate". Grant felt that his Stalwart friends had been of great assistance in his election bid, and they deserved political patronage in his administration. Grant, nonetheless, listened to Young's advice and wrote a letter to J. Donald Cameron, authorizing his name to be withdrawn from the nomination contest after consultation with his other Stalwart backers. Upon hearing of his letter, Julia Grant was insistent that her husband should not withdraw his name from the contest. She said, [...] "If General Grant were not nominated, <b>then</b> <b>let</b> <b>it</b> be so, but he must not withdraw his name – no, never." [...] Young delivered the letter to the [...] "triumvirate" [...] in Chicago on May 31, but no action was taken to remove Grant's name.|$|E
500|$|A case of {{the latter}} {{situation}} is a species of cleaner fish and its mimic, though in this example the model is greatly disadvantaged {{by the presence of}} the mimic. Cleaner fish are the allies of many other species, which allow them to eat their parasites and dead skin. Some allow the cleaner to venture inside their body to hunt these parasites. However, one species of cleaner, the bluestreak cleaner wrasse (Labroides dimidiatus), is the unknowing model of a mimetic species, the sabre-toothed blenny (Aspidontus taeniatus). This wrasse resides in coral reefs in the Indian and the Pacific Oceans, and is recognized by other fishes that <b>then</b> <b>let</b> <b>it</b> clean them. Its imposter, a species of blenny, lives in the Indian Ocean—and not only looks like it in terms of size and coloration, but even mimics the cleaner's [...] "dance". Having fooled its prey into letting its guard down, it then bites it, tearing off a piece of its fin before fleeing. Fish grazed on in this fashion soon learn to distinguish mimic from model, but because the similarity is close between the two they become much more cautious of the model as well, so both are affected. Due to victims' ability to discriminate between foe and helper, the blennies have evolved close similarity, right down to the regional level.|$|E
500|$|The Big Lebowski {{was written}} {{around the same}} time as Barton Fink. When the Coen {{brothers}} wanted to make it, John Goodman was filming episodes for the Roseanne television program and Jeff Bridges was making the Walter Hill film Wild Bill. The Coens decided to make Fargo in the meantime. According to Ethan, [...] "the movie was conceived as pivoting around that relationship between the Dude and Walter", which sprang from the scenes between Barton Fink and Charlie Meadows in Barton Fink. They also {{came up with the idea}} of setting the film in contemporary L.A., because the people who inspired the story lived in the area. When Pete Exline told them about the homework in a baggie incident, the Coens thought that that was very Raymond Chandler and decided to integrate elements of the author's fiction into their script. Joel Coen cites Robert Altman's The Long Goodbye as a primary influence on their film, in the sense that The Big Lebowski [...] "is just kind of informed by Chandler around the edges". When they started writing the script, the Coens wrote only 40 pages and <b>then</b> <b>let</b> <b>it</b> sit for a while before finishing it. This is a normal writing process for them, because they often [...] "encounter a problem at a certain stage, we pass to another project, then we come back to the first script. That way we've already accumulated pieces for several future movies." [...] In order to liven up a scene that they thought was too heavy on exposition, they added an [...] "effete art-world hanger-on", known as Knox Harrington, late in the screenwriting process. In the original script, the Dude's car was a Chrysler LeBaron, as Dowd had once owned, but that car was not big enough to fit John Goodman so the Coens changed it to a Ford Torino.|$|E

[...] May it be pleasing before you, Lord, our God and God of our fathers, that a decree of want not be issued against us, not this day or this year, but if a decree of want should be issued against us, <b>then</b> <b>let</b> <b>it</b> be a want because of the performance of religious duties. [...] May it be pleasing before you, Lord, our God and God of our fathers, that this year be a year of cheap food, full bellies, good business; a year in which the earth forms clods, then is parched so as to form scabs, and then moistened with dew, so that your people, Israel, will not be in need of the help of one another. [...] And do not heed the prayer of travelers that it not rain.” The Rabbis of Caesarea added, “And concerning your people, Israel, that they not exercise dominion over one another.” And for {{the people who live in}} the Sharon plain he would say this prayer, “May it be pleasing before you, Lord, our God and God of our fathers, that our houses not turn into our graves.”.|$|E

2500|$|Amphorae were wheel-thrown {{terracotta}} containers. During {{the production}} process the body was made first and <b>then</b> <b>let</b> <b>it</b> partially dry. Then, coils of clay would be added to form the neck, the rim, and the handles. Once the amphora was completed, the interior was treated with resin {{in order to ensure}} a better performance in liquid storage. The reconstruction of these stages of production is based primarily on ethnographic data coming from the study of modern amphorae production in some areas of the eastern Mediterranean. Amphorae are often marked with a variety of stamps and graffiti. The function of these stamps are related to the entire life of the vessel. Stamps, graffiti and inscriptions provided information from the production cycle to the content and the commercialisation. A stamp was usually applied to the amphora at a partially dry stage and it often indicated the name of the [...] (workshop) and/or the name of the owner of the workshop. Painted stamps, , were executed when the amphora was completed and provided indications regarding the weight of the container and the content.|$|E

Moye paid movie stunt pilot Leo Nomis [...] $450 for the Scout after his father relented and allowed the boy to buy the plane. (In 2007 a [...] "Tommie" [...] was on sale for $125,000.) Stephens' plane weighed 961 pounds empty and had no throttle. It did have two power-control levers, or manettes, in its place, which served in lieu of carburetor, one controlling air intake, the other, fuel. Engine speed was controlled by a so-called blipper, a switch. To manage speed as he taxied for take off, the pilot cut ignition with the blipper switch, <b>then</b> <b>let</b> <b>it</b> start again.

In 1862 and 1863 the issue of four hundred and fifty millions in United States notes, payable not on demand, but, in effect, at the convenience of the government, was authorized, subject to certain restrictions as to fifty millions. These notes were made receivable for the bonds of the National loans, for all debts due to or from the United States, except duties on imports and interest on the public debt, and were also declared a legal tender. In March, 1863, the issue of notes for parts of a dollar was authorized to an amount not exceeding fifty millions of dollars. These notes were not declared a legal tender, but were [...] made redeemable under regulations to be prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury. In February, 1863, the issue of three hundred millions of dollars in notes of the National banking associations was authorized. These notes were made receivable to the same extent as United States notes, and provision was made to secure their redemption, but they were not made a legal tender.|$|E
2500|$|In April 2000, Austin {{appeared}} at Backlash, attacking Triple H and Vince McMahon to help The Rock reclaim the WWF Championship. Austin then made an appearance via satellite on SmackDown! in September as him announcing his return at Unforgiven. At Unforgiven, Austin made his official return {{along with his}} new theme song, [...] "Glass Shatters" [...] by Disturbed. Commissioner Mick Foley, meanwhile, led an investigation {{to find out who}} ran Austin down at Survivor Series the previous year. Rikishi finally admitted to being the driver because [...] "he did it for The Rock". Rikishi felt that Austin occupied the top spot in the company and with him gone, Rock, a fellow Samoan, would be able to ascend {{to the top of the}} company. At No Mercy, Austin was back to face Rikishi in a No Holds Barred match. During the match, Austin mentioned he was going to drive his truck into Rikishi, who by that time was a bloody mess. Before he could, he was stopped by officials, the match being deemed no contest and Austin was (kayfabe) arrested and later bailed out by Commissioner Foley. During a handicap match against Rikishi and Kurt Angle, Triple H came down with the apparent intention of teaming with Austin. After clearing the ring, Triple H smashed his sledgehammer over Austin's head, and revealed it was actually him behind the whole scheme, devised to shield the WWF Championship from Austin and end his career. At Survivor Series, Triple H had plotted to run Austin down again during their match (thus repeating the events of the previous year's Survivor Series), but his plot failed when Austin lifted Triple H's automobile with a forklift, <b>then</b> <b>let</b> <b>it</b> drop 20 feet. Also, in December, Stone Cold Steve Austin competed in a six-man Hell in a Cell match at Armageddon for the WWF Championship, against Triple H, The Undertaker, Rikishi, Kurt Angle and The Rock. In the end, Austin gave The Rock a stunner and was about to pin him when Triple H came in the way and got a stunner; Angle took advantage of the situation and pinned The Rock and picked up the victory, hence retaining the WWF Championship. After the match, Austin delivered a stunner to Angle, while he was celebrating his victory. On his 36th birthday, December 18, 2000 on the first episode of Raw is War to be held at the BI-LO Center in Greenville, South Carolina, Austin competed and fought in a non-title match against William Regal, in which he was disqualified after taking Regal's European title belt to hit him. Austin won his third Royal Rumble in January 2001, last eliminating Kane. His rivalry against Triple H ended at No Way Out in a Three Stages of Hell match, with Triple H beating Austin two falls to one.|$|E
