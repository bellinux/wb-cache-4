The rational roots of this doctrine, he argued, soon grew incompatible with and larger than the religious and so the latter were eventually discarded.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{examines}} {{cultural differences}} in attitudes towards corruption by analysing individual-decision making in a corrupt experimental environment. Attitudes towards corruption {{play a critical}} role in the persistence of corruption. Our experiments differentiate between the incentives to engage in corrupt behaviour and the incentives to punish corrupt behaviour and allow us to explore whether, in environments characterized by lower levels of corruption, there is both a lower propensity to engage in corrupt behaviour and a higher propensity to punish corrupt behaviour. Based on experiments run in Australia (Melbourne), India (Delhi), Indonesia (Jakarta) and Singapore, we find that there is more variation in the propensities to punish corrupt behaviour than in the propensities to engage in corrupt behaviour across cultures. The results reveal that <b>the</b> <b>subjects</b> <b>in</b> India exhibit a higher tolerance towards corruption than <b>the</b> <b>subjects</b> <b>in</b> Australia while <b>the</b> <b>subjects</b> <b>in</b> Indonesia behave similarly to those <b>in</b> Australia. <b>The</b> <b>subjects</b> <b>in</b> Singapore have a higher propensity to engage <b>in</b> corruption than <b>the</b> <b>subjects</b> <b>in</b> Australia. We also vary our experimental design to examine the impact of a more effective punishment system and the effect of the perceived cost of bribery...|$|R

As war engulfed the island, Spanish reprisals against the rebels grew ever harsher. American public opinion favored the rebels, and McKinley shared in their outrage against Spanish policies. However while public opinion called for war to liberate Cuba, McKinley favored a peaceful approach, hoping that through negotiation, Spain might be convinced to grant Cuba independence, {{or at least to}} allow the Cubans some measure of autonomy.

Later, in the last year of his life and with the Second World War under way, he published two booklets on post war reconstruction, Britain Must Rebuild and Paths to Peace.

5|$|In a status-conscious society {{like that}} of the Romans, {{clothing}} and personal adornment gave immediate visual clues about the etiquette of interacting with the wearer. Wearing the correct clothing was supposed to reflect a society in good order. The toga was the distinctive national garment of the Roman male citizen, but it was heavy and impractical, worn mainly for conducting political business and religious rites, and for going to court. The clothing Romans wore ordinarily was dark or colourful, and the most common male attire seen daily throughout the provinces would have been tunics, cloaks, and in some regions trousers. The study of how Romans dressed in daily life is complicated by a lack of direct evidence, since portraiture may show <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> <b>in</b> clothing with symbolic value, and surviving textiles from the period are rare.|$|E

5|$|The case {{first went}} to the High Court of Justice, where it was heard by Fulford J; {{he decided that he}} did not have the {{authority}} to overrule Bonnard, and passed the case on to the Court of Appeal after granting a temporary injunction. In the Court of Appeal, the case was heard by May, Dyson and Brooke LJJ, with Brooke delivering the judgment on 5 November 2004. In it, Brooke judged that defamation, the subject of Greene, was significantly different from breach of confidentiality, <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> <b>in</b> Cream. While the damage from a breach of confidentiality can never be undone, justifiying a simple test for issuing injunctions, a defamation case that is won vindicates the injured party. Making it easier to grant injunctions in defamation cases would damage the delicate balance between freedom of the press and the right to privacy; as such, despite the Human Rights Act, Bonnard is still a valid test.|$|E

5|$|The {{development}} of the finite-dimensional representation theory of the Lorentz group mostly follows that of <b>the</b> <b>subject</b> <b>in</b> general. Lie theory originated with Sophus Lie in 1873. By 1888 the classification of simple Lie algebras was essentially completed by Wilhelm Killing. In 1913 the theorem of highest weight for representations of simple Lie algebras, the path that will be followed here, was completed by Ãlie Cartan. Richard Brauer was 1935â38 {{largely responsible for the}} {{development of}} the Weyl-Brauer matrices describing how spin representations of the Lorentz Lie algebra can be embedded in Clifford algebras. The Lorentz group has also historically received special attention in representation theory, see History of infinite-dimensional unitary representations below, due to its exceptional importance in physics. Mathematicians Hermann Weyl and Harish-Chandra and physicists Eugene Wigner and Valentine Bargmann made substantial contributions both to general representation theory and in particular to the Lorentz group. Physicist Paul Dirac was perhaps the first to manifestly knit everything together in a practical application of major lasting importance with the Dirac equation in 1928.|$|E

To test this idea, and to examine the developmental course of empathy in early childhood, 58 children (mean age 4 years, 0 month; 7 years, 6 months; 10 years, 5 months) were tested in two experimental settings: a story condition, where the children were told two happy stories and a role-playing condition, where <b>the</b> <b>subjects</b> enacted scenes from two happy stories. After <b>the</b> treatments, <b>the</b> <b>subjects</b> were asked to report both the character's and their own emotions. Behavioral measures of emotion were also assessed using the Facial Action Coding System. It was reasoned that (a) the reported feelings would increase with age, and (b) <b>the</b> <b>subjects</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Role Playing Condition would report stronger feelings than <b>the</b> <b>subjects</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Story Condition.
