5000|$|Trains of the Ninth Avenue and Sixth Avenue {{elevated}} lines {{shared the}} same track above West 53rd Street, where the Sixth Avenue line branched off. Downtown-bound trains displayed disks indicating to the <b>towerman</b> at the junction whether he should set the switch for the train to enter the curve or proceed straight on to the 50th Street station.|$|E
50|$|The train {{had been}} {{scheduled}} to travel via the Lackawanna Cut-Off, but because of freight traffic on the line the <b>towerman</b> at Slateford Junction rerouted the special over the Old Road of the Lackawanna, an alternate route that was to take the train through the New Jersey towns of Washington, and Hackettstown, before rejoining the main line near Lake Hopatcong. The rerouting of these types of trains on this section of the railroad under these circumstances was not unusual.|$|E
40|$|Special {{methods of}} {{psychological}} instructions of civil aviation specialists in particular <b>towermen</b> are described. These methods allow to mobilize all functional reserves, guarantee precision characteristics of activity, keep mobilization in required parameters both emotional and mnemic, mobilize kinetic characteristics of each action...|$|R
5000|$|The Archange lake is {{well-known}} {{because of its}} fire guards tower that was built {{on top of the}} so-called [...] "lake Archange mountain”, which has been in operation since the early 20th century. Historian Gaétan Veillette published in 1974 that several <b>towermen</b> have succeeded in the history of Sainte-Thècle, including Émile Bacon for 17 years, at “Lac Profond” (Deep Lake) and Lake Archange; Elzéar Plamondon, worked for a long time at Lake Veillette; Oscar Plamondon for 16 years; Georges Darveault, Alfred Darveault and Rosidé Brière. While Georges Vallée was supervisor of <b>towermen.</b> Considering its height, the lake Archange mountain offering an exceptional panorama to observe forest fires. Activities of forest fire observation by guards were coordinated with aerial reconnaissance airline pilots based in Lac-à-la-Tortue, which is the oldest civil seaplane base in Canada. Aerial observation of forest fires started in Mauricie in 1919.|$|R
2500|$|The Cut-Off {{was built}} to permit {{unrestricted}} speeds for passenger trains of [...] (heavier rail that was installed later allowed speeds to increase to [...] ). Sidings were built at Slateford, Hainesburg, Johnsonburg, Greendell, Roseville, and Port Morris; about 25% of the route contained additional sidings. With upwards of 50 trains a day, <b>towermen</b> often ordered freight trains to take a siding or even be rerouted over the Old Road. As traffic decreased, Hainesburg, Johnsonburg and Roseville sidings were altered or removed. The remaining sidings remained in use until 1979.|$|R
50|$|He {{was born}} on November 26, 1888 in Joliet, Illinois. From 1914 to 1916 he participated in the Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition. In 1923 he {{returned}} to Joliet and worked at Elgin, Joliet and Eastern Railway. He next was a <b>towerman</b> for the Rock Island Railroad. He married Merle in 1925 {{and they had a}} daughter, Elizabeth Bakewell. During World War II he worked at the Diesel Electric Plant in La Grange, Illinois. In August 1945 he bought a farm in Michigan.|$|E
50|$|An {{abandoned}} firetower, {{often referred}} to as the Ellis Tower, is still standing on the highest section of the Ridge (left). The original tower was an 80 ft structure erected in 1930. The successor, currently standing, is 100 ft high and was abandoned in the 1960s. The <b>towerman</b> would have resided in a cabin on the shore of Scarecrow Lake and would have hiked a 3.5 km trail daily taking approximately two hours to summit and a little over one hour to descend again.|$|E
5000|$|As {{described}} in a film magazine, [...] "Buck" [...] Andrade (Hart), an outlaw, promises his dying mother (Midgley) that he will reform himself. Taking a letter of introduction from a wounded man, he becomes a detective for the railroad, which he had previously held up several times. He is successful in capturing several bandits and also wins the love of Faith Lawson (Vale), who is a <b>towerman</b> (a type of railroad signalman). When the real detective recovers from his wounds and returns to duty, he discloses the true identity of Buck. Buck attempts to escape, but {{an attack on the}} railroad by his old gang forces him to remain. After he captures all of them, president of the railroad Murray Lemantier (MacDowell) assists by allowing Buck to escape.|$|E
50|$|In total, 79 {{passengers}} died, {{all from}} cars #7 and #8, and 117 were injured, some seriously. The inquiry quickly established the overheated journal box {{as the cause}} of the accident, but railroad mechanics who had inspected and lubricated the box earlier that day swore it had been in good order. Normal practice was for signal <b>towermen</b> to watch passing train wheels for signs of problems and for train crew to look back as trains rounded curves. How this hot box escaped attention until too late has never been explained.|$|R
50|$|The Cut-Off {{was built}} to permit {{unrestricted}} speeds for passenger trains of 70 mph (heavier rail that was installed later allowed speeds to increase to 80 mph). Sidings were built at Slateford, Hainesburg, Johnsonburg, Greendell, Roseville, and Port Morris; about 25% of the route contained additional sidings. With upwards of 50 trains a day, <b>towermen</b> often ordered freight trains to take a siding or even be rerouted over the Old Road. As traffic decreased, Hainesburg, Johnsonburg and Roseville sidings were altered or removed. The remaining sidings remained in use until 1979.|$|R
50|$|The {{novel is}} set in the year 3010, in the ruins of New York after an atomic disaster. Fortune is the captain of the army of the <b>Towermen,</b> those who live in the {{remaining}} skyscrapers and rule the city with an iron hand. He is taken captive by the people of the Island of the Statue. There, Fortune learns of a prophecy that states that the people will be free when the torch burns {{in the hands of the}} statue. Fortune is redeemed by his captors and leads them in a revolt against his former masters.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the train}} yard at Union Station, <b>towerman</b> John Feeney in K Tower set the {{switches}} to shunt the Federal Express onto Track 16. But {{when the train}} raced past him at high speed, he telephoned the stationmaster's office. Clerk Ray Klopp picked up the phone. Feeney shouted, [...] "Runaway on Track 16!" [...] Klopp {{looked up to see}} the train racing directly toward his office. He shouted, [...] "Run for your lives!" [...] Then he and the other clerks ran out of the office as fast as they could. (They had just 20 seconds to get out of harm's way.) Aboard the train, conductor Thomas J. Murphy ran through the train from end to end, shouting at the passengers to get down as low as they could on the floor or on their seats.|$|E
50|$|The {{accident}} was blamed on human error, but the precise cause was never established. However, {{it was known}} that the switch should have been spiked closed. The maintenance foreman on the scene, William Baldwin, {{said at the time}} that someone in the signaling tower located in the tunnel south of 40th Street must have pushed the button to open the switch, but the <b>towerman,</b> Harry King, maintained that no one had, leading to the suspicion that Baldwin had activated it from trackside with his assistant holding down the automatic brake tripper. The New York Transit Commission later took this view. Baldwin was initially charged with negligent homicide in the then 15 deaths and released on $10,000 bail. However, it was later found that King was actually a clerk, not a trained towerman; in early October, he admitted that he had been using a false identity and was really Harry Stockdale, a man from Baltimore who had been convicted in a stabbing there. The charges against Baldwin were dismissed and King was imprisoned instead.|$|E
50|$|The Tweed Forest Fire District {{was founded}} by the former Ontario Department of Lands and Forests (now the MNR) in 1922 as one of 17 districts to help protect Ontario's forests from fire by early {{detection}} from fire towers. The headquarters for the district were housed at Hungerford Road in town. It was the central headquarters for 21 fire lookout towers. When a fire was spotted in the forest a <b>towerman</b> would get the degree bearings from his respective tower and radio back the information to headquarters. When one or more towermen from other towers in the area would also call in their bearings, the forest rangers at headquarters could get a 'triangulation' read and plot {{the exact location of}} the fire on their map. This way a team of forest firefighters could be dispatched as soon as possible to get the fire under control. In 1958 the 100 ft-tall Hungerford firetower was erected beside the station. However, in the 1970s all the towers had been decommissioned as aerial fire fighting techniques were employed. The Hungerford tower was disassembled in 1996 and placed behind the Tweed Heritage Centre.|$|E
50|$|On October 13, 1894, {{delegates from}} several lodges {{of the former}} {{association}} met in Kansas City, Missouri and formed the Switchmen's Union of North America.It was incorporated in Buffalo, New York on January 9, 1902, covering the United States and Canada, and representing yard workers: yardmasters, switchmen, switch tenders, <b>towermen</b> and interlocking men. The objectives were to promote the social, moral and intellectual interests of its members, to maintain harmonious relations between workers and employers and to protect its distressed or erring members, exercising its beneficial influence {{in the interests of}} right and justice. At this period, railway unions such as the Switchmen's Union avoided strikes wherever possible.|$|R
50|$|<b>Towermen</b> and loggers used {{a system}} of private {{telephones}} with telephone wire that ran from 1931 to 1947. Every phone could be activated by a crank batteries powering two 6-inch round. Calls were made directly through a ring without going through an exchange. The system could provide 24 hours services between observation posts including the Hervey-Jonction, Rivière-à-Pierre, Lac-des-Iles and Archange Lake. Companies managed by Jeffrey Veillet were referring to this network to forecast forest fires and weather phenomena, including the period of log driving, cutting forest or timber transport. Marie-Ange Bacon (Sainte-Thècle) said that the fireguards repaired their own special phone, which served as a liaison.|$|R
50|$|The Pembroke Forest Fire District {{was founded}} by Ontario's former Department of Lands and Forests (now the MNR) in 1922 as one of 17 districts to help protect Ontario's forests from fire by early {{detection}} from fire towers. The headquarters for the district were housed in the town. It was the central location for 15 fire tower lookouts, including the towers in Algonquin Park. The 15 towers included: Wilberforce, Mt. Edna, Sherwood, Murchison, Preston, Clancy, Fitzgerald, Brent, Big Crow Lake, White Trout Lake, Stonecliffe, Deux Rivières, Osler, Lauder and Skymount. When a fire was spotted in the forest a <b>towerman</b> would get the degree bearings from his respective tower and radio back the information to headquarters. When one or more towermen from other towers in the area would also call in their bearings, the forest rangers at headquarters could get a 'triangulation' read and plot {{the exact location of}} the fire on their map. This way a team of forest firefighters could be dispatched as soon as possible to get the fire under control. These towers would all be phased out after aerial fire fighting techniques were employed in the 1970s.|$|E
50|$|Ontario's former Department of Lands and Forests (now the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources) ran {{one of its}} 17 {{forest fire}} districts from Lindsay. Formed in 1946 The Lindsay Forest Fire District served as the {{headquarters}} for the protection and study of forests in Haliburton, Victoria, Durham, Peterborough and Northumberland Counties. The Lindsay office was also responsible for the maintenance and manning of the 13 fire tower lookouts within its boundaries. The towerman's purpose was as an early detection to protect the local forests from fire. The district's towers included: Harburn, Bruton, Eyre, Glamorgan (Green's Mountain), Harvey, Cardiff, Digby, Lutterworth, Sherbourne (St. Nora), Dorset, Clarke (Ganaraska Forest), Haldimand (Northumberland Forest) and Methuen (Blue Mountain). When a fire was spotted in the forest a <b>towerman</b> would get the degree bearings from his respective tower and radio back the information to headquarters. When one or more towermen from other towers in the area would also call in their bearings, the forest rangers at headquarters could get a 'triangulation' read and plot {{the exact location of}} the fire on their map. This way a team of forest firefighters could be dispatched as soon as possible to get the fire under control. Most of these towers were put out of use in the late 1960s when aerial detection systems were put in place.|$|E
50|$|The Parry Sound Forest Fire District {{was founded}} by Ontario's former Department of Lands and Forests (now the MNR) in 1922 as one of 17 districts to help protect Ontario's forests from fire by early {{detection}} from fire towers. The headquarters for the district were housed {{in the town of}} Parry Sound. It was the central location for 21 fire tower lookouts, including the Parry Sound fire tower, which was erected in the same location as the modern lookout tower at 17 George Street. The other 20 towers in the district were: Pickerel River CPR, Byng Inlet, Still River, Pointe au Baril, Pakesley, Pickerel River CNR, Key Junction, Ardbeg, Spence, Go Home, Loring, Stormy Lake (Restoule), Nipissing, Boulter, Lount, Laurier, Strong, Proudfoot, Stisted and Draper. When a fire was spotted in the forest a <b>towerman</b> would get the degree bearings from his respective tower and radio back the information to headquarters. When one or more towermen from other towers in the area would also call in their bearings, the forest rangers at headquarters could get a 'triangulation' read and plot the exact location of the fire on their map. This way a team of forest firefighters could be dispatched as soon as possible to get the fire under control. In 1969 there remained only 4 actively manned towers: Ardbeg, Go Home, Stormy Lake, and Boulter. These would all be phased out shortly after when aerial fire fighting techniques were employed in the 1970s.|$|E
50|$|The former Dysart {{fire tower}} was erected in 1956 {{on a hill}} by {{the east side of}} Haliburton village just off Highway 118. Its 100 ft frame still stands, but the towerman's cupola has since been removed. It was erected by Ontario's former Department of Lands and Forests (now the MNR) as an early {{detection}} to protect the local forests from fire. This tower was put out of use in the late 1960s when aerial detection systems were put in place. It was one of the County of Haliburton's many towers that were part of the former Lindsay Forest Fire District. Other towers included: Harburn, Eyre, Green's Mountain, Harvey, Cardiff, Digby, Lutterworth, Sherbourne (St. Nora), Dorset and Bruton. When a fire was spotted in the forest a <b>towerman</b> would get the degree bearings from his respective tower and radio back the information to headquarters. When one or more towermen from other towers in the area would also call in their bearings, the forest rangers at headquarters could get a 'triangulation' read and plot the exact location of the fire on their map. This way a team of forest firefighters could be dispatched as soon as possible to get the fire under control. There was a Department of Lands and Forests headquarters stationed in Minden, Ontario and at St. Nora Lake (later the Leslie Frost Centre), which offered forest ranger training from 1945 onwards.|$|E
5000|$|On September 23, {{the report}} of the Board of Railroad commissioners laid most of the blame for the {{accident}} on motorman Kelly, but some on the <b>towerman,</b> Cornelius Jackson, who was said to have been away from his post {{at the time of the}} accident. On October 2, the coroner's jury held both responsible. Kelly claimed the train had been displaying the correct disks for Ninth Avenue; Jackson claimed it had not. The train's conductor, J.W. Johnson, who had the job of setting the disks on the train, backed Kelly, and so did the company, since station guards had identified the train as Ninth Avenue at every stop it had made before the accident. However, the coroner's jury found that Kelly should have seen that the signal indicated the switch was set for Sixth Avenue, and that he was driving recklessly fast. Nevertheless, Kelly, who went missing after the accident, told a fellow motorman immediately afterwards that Jackson had been [...] "trying to do him," [...] accusing Jackson of having previously changed disks on the signal tower at the last second, forcing Kelly to back onto the other tracks, thus losing time and getting in trouble with the railway company. Kelly could not back onto the other tracks this time because of his speed, which he explained had been due to the guards at 59th Street having called out 42nd Street as the next stop; Kelly was making up lost time on what he thought would be a straightaway to 42nd Street, not realizing until it was too late that the switch had actually been set for the curve to Sixth Avenue. Kelly was finally found and arrested in San Francisco in June 1907, almost two years after the accident.|$|E

State Street, Ithaca, NY 14850 or e-mail admin@thehistorycenter. netThis book {{is both a}} {{railroad}} history and memoir. The author vividly reconstructs {{the life of the}} Elmira, Cortland & Northern Railroad, its predecessor lines, and successors over the one hundred years the route was in operation. He does so as someone who worked for the Lehigh Valley Railroad as a <b>towerman</b> at Cortland Junction and five other Lehigh Valley interlocking towers and as a rail historian who has gathered stories, photos, and artifacts from men who worked this line and fellow historians across several states. I am his brother, a retired journalist, and now book editor. As noted in his earlier rail memoir, Lehigh Valley Memories, A Tour of the Lehigh Valley Railroad in New York’s Finger Lakes Region, 1941 [...] 1959, David and I were bitten early by the railroad bug, while on summer vacation on the west shore of Cayuga Lake, near Ithaca, New York, traveling by gas-electric motor to a farm roominghouse and watching across the lake where the Lehigh switched cars and we tried to figure out the track layout. David has since spent a lifetime in transportation, as a railfan, <b>towerman</b> and station agent for the Lehigh while a Cornell University student, as a lieutenant in the U. S. Army Transportation Corps, and with the Chesapeake & Ohio, Washington & Old Dominion, New York Central railroads, and Massachusetts Bay Transit Authority before retirement {{from a wide variety of}} management positions in operating and finance departments. He is the editorial "we" and the "young telegrapher-station agent" who speaks in these pages. David has undertaken to recall how the Elmira, Cortland & Northern Railroad came into being as a hastily crafted rural line, and its continued existence under the Lehigh Valley, Conrail, and other owners. The book follows the arc of a railroad, through the coming of competition from other lines, the automobile and truck, canal and lake boats, and airlines. Many of the photographs are David Marcham’s. He includes a locomotive roster, station list, maps, timetables, more than 150 illustrations, a bibliography, acknowledgements, a list of illustration sources, and an index...|$|E
