5|$|A direct {{consequence}} of the invasion was the almost total elimination of the old English aristocracy {{and the loss of}} English control over the Catholic Church in England. William systematically dispossessed English landowners and conferred their property on his continental followers. The Domesday Book meticulously documents the impact of this colossal programme of expropriation, revealing that by 1086 only about 5 per cent of land in England south of the Tees was left in English hands. Even <b>this</b> <b>tiny</b> residue was further diminished in the decades that followed, the elimination of native landholding being most complete in southern parts of the country.|$|E
5|$|Hereditary {{senators}} and equites combined military service with civilian posts, a career path {{known as the}} cursus honorum, typically starting with a period of junior administrative posts in Rome, followed by 5–10 years {{in the military and}} a final period of senior positions in either the provinces or Rome. <b>This</b> <b>tiny,</b> tightly-knit ruling oligarchy of under 10,000 men monopolised political, military and economic power in an empire of c. 80 million inhabitants and achieved a remarkable degree of political stability. During the first 200 years of its existence (30 BC – 180 AD), the empire suffered only one major episode of civil strife (the Civil War of 68–9). Otherwise, usurpation attempts by provincial governors were few and swiftly suppressed.|$|E

25|$|<b>This</b> <b>tiny</b> monkey, {{named for}} its {{beautiful}} golden colour and the long hair around its head which resembles a lion's mane, {{is one of the}} rarest primates in the world. Golden lion tamarins, like many of the other tamarins found in South America, are threatened with extinction in their natural habitat. Dublin Zoo is involved in the international breeding programme and helps to fund researchers who study the tamarins in Brazil.|$|E
25|$|The {{flora and}} the fauna consist of taxa adapted to drought. Terrestrial fauna is scant; {{there are no}} truly native land mammals and only one native land bird – Kiribati's endemic reed-warbler, the bokikokiko (Acrocephalus aequinoctialis). The 1957 attempt to {{introduce}} the endangered Rimitara lorikeet (Vini kuhlii) has largely failed; a few birds seem to linger on, {{but the lack of}} abundant coconut palm forest, on which <b>this</b> <b>tiny</b> parrot depends, makes Kiritimati a suboptimal habitat for this species.|$|E

25|$|Underneath the bonnet was the Kent Crossflow engine {{also used}} in the {{smallest}} capacity North American Ford Pinto. Diesel engines on small family cars were rare, and the Escort was no exception, initially featuring only petrol engines– in 1.1L, and 1.3L versions. A 940 cc engine was also available in some export markets such as Italy and France. <b>This</b> <b>tiny</b> engine remained popular in Italy, where it was carried over for the Escort Mark II, but in France it was discontinued during 1972.|$|E
25|$|In these strophes, Camões {{speaks of}} Viriatus and Quintus Sertorius, {{the people of}} Lusus, a people predestined by the Fates to {{accomplish}} great deeds. Jupiter says that their history proves it because, having emerged victorious against the Moors and Castilians, <b>this</b> <b>tiny</b> nation {{has gone on to}} discover new worlds and impose its law in the concert of the nations. At the end of the poem, on the Island of Love, the fictional finale to the glorious tour of Portuguese history, Camões writes that the fear once expressed by Bacchus has been confirmed: that the Portuguese would become gods.|$|E

In two days, the United States offered assistance and the United Nations Security Council asked its members to help repel the North Korean attack. Canada, the United States, New Zealand, South Africa, the Philippines, Australia, Ethiopia and other countries sent troops to Korea under a United Nations security council resolution.|$|E

25|$|Gravitational {{waves are}} {{constantly}} passing Earth; however, even the strongest have a minuscule effect and their sources are generally {{at a great}} distance. For example, the waves given off by the cataclysmic final merger of GW150914 reached Earth after travelling over a billion light-years, as a ripple in spacetime that changed {{the length of a}} 4-km LIGO arm by a ten thousandth of the width of a proton, proportionally equivalent to changing the distance to the nearest star outside the Solar System by one hair's width. <b>This</b> <b>tiny</b> effect from even extreme gravitational waves makes them only detectable on Earth by the most sophisticated detectors.|$|E
25|$|Britain's {{economic}} {{problems in the}} 1880s helped to develop some interest in the Socialist League, but the group nevertheless remained minuscule. By January 1887 {{the membership of the}} party stood at just 550. Moreover, many members were unemployed and too poor to pay their dues; the treasurer reported that only 280 members were able to contribute to party funds. Furthermore, even <b>this</b> <b>tiny</b> membership was ideologically divided into three factions: anarchists (who sought destruction of the state and its replacement with a free association of producers via revolutionary uprising), parliamentary-oriented socialists (who sought establishment of an egalitarian state through electoral means), and anti-parliamentary socialists (who sought establishment of an egalitarian state through a revolutionary overturn by the mobilized working class).|$|E
25|$|Altogether, {{the great}} grey shrike is common and {{widespread}} and not considered a threatened species by the IUCN (though they still include L. meridionalis in L. excubitor). Wherever it occurs, its numbers are usually many hundreds or even thousands per country. Its stronghold is the region around Sweden, where at least almost 20,000, {{perhaps as many as}} 50,000 were believed to live in the late 20th century. However, in some countries it is not robustly established; in Estonia only a few hundred are found, with less than 200 in Belgium and some more or less than 100 in Latvia and Lithuania, respectively. The few dozen in the Netherlands and the 10 birds or so in Denmark might disappear because of a few years of adverse circumstances. By contrast, in Luxembourg plentiful high-quality habitat is found; though the number of {{great grey shrike}}s in <b>this</b> <b>tiny</b> country is necessarily limited, the average population density there is 25 times as high as in Lithuania.|$|E

25|$|LDH {{in humans}} uses His(193) as the proton acceptor, {{and works in}} unison with the {{coenzyme}} (Arg99 and Asn138), and substrate (Arg106; Arg169; Thr248) binding residues. The His(193) active site, is not only found in the human form of LDH, but is found in many different animals, showing the convergent evolution of LDH. The two different subunits of LDH: LDHA {{also known as the}} M subunit of LDH, and LDHB also known as the H subunit of LDH both retain the same active site, and the same amino acids participating in the reaction. The noticeable difference between the two subunits that make up LDH's tertiary structure is the replacement of alanine (in the M chain) with a glutamine (in the H chain). <b>This</b> <b>tiny</b> but notable change {{is believed to be the}} reason the H subunit can bind faster, and the M subunit's catalytic activity isn't reduced when subjected to the same conditions as the H subunit; while the H subunits activity is reduced fivefold.|$|E
25|$|The {{scientific}} and natural interest of <b>this</b> <b>tiny</b> group of islands {{lies in its}} marine biodiversity, its unique flora and many avian species that breed annually on its rock cliffs or use them on their stopover on normal migratory patterns. About 3% of the 9000 species of birds are marine species, the remaining are migratory species. The abundance of birds on the islands, at one time, made the islands an attractive hunting area for peoples of the region. At {{the end of the}} 19th century the German naturalist Ernst Schmitz noted that 20–22,000 Cory's shearwaters were hunted in September or October in the islands; the hunts continued until 1967. Madeiran expeditions to the islands were responsible for the killing of juvenile birds for food, while their down was used to stuff pillows and comforters. Presently the islands are home or stopover for: Cory's shearwaters (approximately 14,000), white-faced storm-petrel (12,000), Bulwer's petrel (500), North Atlantic little shearwater (500), Madeiran storm-petrel (1000), yellow-legged gull, the roseate tern and Berthelot's pipit; which are subjects of annual scientific expeditions. Many of theses species are vulnerable to local predators, primarily from populations of brown rat and predatory bird species, like the yellow-legged gull, which will consume both eggs and chicks (the white-faced storm-petrel and Bulwer's petrel are primarily susceptible). These islands also have many endemic fauna species, including local snails and the unique gecko Tarentola boettgeri bischoffi.|$|E
25|$|The Philippines {{is one of}} the {{countries}} with high literacy rate. The literacy rate of the Philippines is 92.31% while literacy rate of Quezon is 91.58%. Most people in this municipality invest their hard-earned income for the education of their children through farming, employment, small businesses or through the remittances of a family member working abroad. Due to strong family ties, there is also a practice among children of bigger families on supporting each other to get college education. The Lacambra, Poquiz and Ramos families are examples many of their townmates look up to as role models, having produced locally grown professionals such as lawyers, doctors, engineers, teachers, nurses, agriculturists, IT professionals, economists, accountants, military and police officers, etc. A graduate of PMA Class 1981 and Master of Science in Management (Finance) in the USA, Major General Romeo de Vera Poquiz, AFP, a son of a farmer and former Municipal Councilor is a humble product <b>this</b> <b>tiny</b> municipality can be proud of. A two-star General, he was awarded with: Philippine Legion of Honor awarded by the Philippine President, The Outstanding Philippine Soldier (TOPS) awarded by the Metrobank Foundation, Award for Continued Excellence and Service (ACES) also by the Metrobank Foundation, PMA Cavalier Award for Outstanding Achievements as PMA alumnus, Golden Aviator Award for Outstanding Achievements as Philippine Air Force Flying School alumnus, Distinguished Service Awards, Gold Cross Medal, Outstanding Achievement Medal, and many other various awards, medals, recognitions and citations.
