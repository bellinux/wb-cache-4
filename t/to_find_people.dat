5|$|The casting {{approach}} for Carnivàle {{was to find}} the best available actors and to show the characters' realness as opposed to depending on freak illusions too much. Carnivàles casting directors John Papsodera and Wendy O'Brien already had experience in casting freaks from previous projects. They attended theater showcases, approached smaller agents or hired some actors directly <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>people</b> with unique and distinct looks, which was trying as Los Angeles is a stronghold of good-looking actors. The producers generally preferred actors who were not strongly identified with other projects, but were willing to make exceptions for established actors such as Adrienne Barbeau (Ruthie).|$|E
5|$|The {{idea for}} Whitepages was {{conceived}} by Alex Algard, while studying at Stanford in 1996. Algard {{was searching for}} a friend's contact information and the phone company gave him the wrong number.

He continued operating the website as a hobby while working as an investment banker for Goldman Sachs. He expanded the database of contact information using data licensed from American Business Information (now a part of Infogroup). Eventually WhitePages was producing more ad-revenue than Algard was earning at Goldman Sachs. In 1998, Algard left his job {{to focus on the}} website; he incorporated Whitepages in 2000.|$|E

5|$|While {{reports by}} owners of fitting names are of interest, some {{scientists}} have questioned their value {{in deciding whether}} nominative determinism is a real effect. Instead, {{they argue that the}} claim that a name affects life decisions is an extraordinary one that requires extraordinary evidence. To select only those cases that seem to give evidence for nominative determinism is to ignore those that do not. Analysis of large numbers of names is therefore needed. In 2002 Pelham, Mirenberg, and Jones analysed various databases containing first names, surnames, occupations, cities and states. In one study they concluded that people named Dennis gravitate towards dentistry. They did this by retrieving the number of dentists called Dennis (482) from a database of US dentists. They then used the 1990 Census to find out which male first name was the next most popular after Dennis: Walter. The likelihood of a US male being called Dennis was 0.415% and the likelihood of a US male being called Walter was 0.416%. The researchers then retrieved the number of dentists called Walter (257). Comparing the relative frequencies of Dennis and Walter led them to their conclusion that the name Dennis is over-represented in dentistry. However, in 2011, Uri Simonsohn published a paper in which he criticized Pelham et al. for not considering confounding factors and reported on how the popularity of Dennis and Walter as baby names has varied over the decades. Given Walter was a relatively old-fashioned name it was far more likely for Pelham et al. <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>people</b> named Dennis to have any job, not just that of dentist, and people named Walter to be retired. Simonsohn did indeed find a disproportionally high number of Dennis lawyers compared to Walter lawyers.|$|E

In addition, a reporter, Max Prangnell, was sent to Israel <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>people</b> who knew Vanunu and verify his story.

25|$|Wapishana is {{classified}} {{as a member of}} the Arawak language family. Wapishana is the only remaining Arawakan language in the circum-Roraima area. The term Arawak is more generally used to refer to the Arawakan or Lokono languages spoken in Venezuela, Guyana, Suriname, French Guiana and in some of the Antilles Islands. Most Brazilian Wapishana often speak Portuguese, instead of Wapishana and many Guyanese Wapishana speak English in addition to Wapishana. Portuguese is the dominant language among the Wapishana who live in urban areas that are bilingual in Portuguese and Wapishana, especially among the younger generations. According to Migliazza, more than 80% of Wapishana can speak the national language with which they are in contact, Portuguese in Brazil or English in Guyana. Since someone can cross the border between the two countries so easily, it is common <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>people</b> who speak Portuguese and English, as well as the maternal language.|$|E
25|$|Sweden has {{a system}} for credit scoring that aims <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>people</b> {{with a history of}} neglect to pay bills or, most commonly, taxes. Anyone who does not pay their debts on time, and fails to make {{payments}} after a reminder, will have their case forwarded to the Swedish Enforcement Authority which is a national authority for collecting debts. The mere appearance of a company, or government office, as a debtor to this authority will result in a record among private credit bureaus; however, this does not apply to individuals as debtors. This record is called a Betalningsanmärkning (non-payment record) and by law can be stored for three years for an individual and five years for a company. This kind of nonpayment record will make it very difficult to get a loan, rent an apartment, get telephone subscriptions, rent a car or get a job where you handle cash. The banks, also use income and asset figures in connection with loan assessments.|$|E

25|$|While the Liberal {{reforms were}} one of Britain's most ambitious welfare reform programmes, there were several {{limitations}} to the reforms they passed. Free school meals were not compulsory. Pensions were refused {{to those who had}} not been in work most of their life and life expectancy at birth at this time was only 55 so relatively few people lived long enough to receive a pension. The labour exchange programme often managed <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>people</b> only part-time casual work. The poor had to pay National Insurance Contributions out of their wages and the 7s 6d was not enough to live on. Unemployment and sickness pay also only lasted for a limited time. Free medical care was available to only a wage-earner, not the wife or children or grandparents and other relatives. The new National Health Insurance scheme also did not provide coverage for all forms of medical care. It did not provide cover for special advice while many people could not get acquire dental, ophthalmic or other treatment through NHI. Also, other people were not covered for convalescent homes, while the only specialist services for those in NHI were for TB and VD. The welfare measures introduced by the Liberal government concerning the sick, the elderly, and the children did, however, lead to a reduction in poverty, with the total number of paupers falling from 916,377 in 1910 to 748,019 by 1914.|$|E

He made his feature film debut with the Frank Tuttle-directed comedy This is the Night (1932), playing an Olympic javelin thrower opposite Thelma Todd and Lili Damita.

500|$|Set {{some time}} before {{the events of the}} first game, the main character, whose name is later {{revealed}} to be Jeremy Fitzgerald, has started working as a night watch security guard at the [...] "new and improved" [...] Freddy Fazbear's Pizza. The [...] "upgraded" [...] versions of the animatronic characters, which have special facial recognition software to protect the children from potential harm, were not programmed with a proper night mode; when things go silent, their programming tells them that they are in the wrong room and they seek out the nearest source of noise <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>people</b> to entertain, which happens to be in the player's office.

Jeremy is apparently moved to day shift after Night 6 as the animatronics' hostility becomes too dangerous, with the restaurant closing down shortly after.|$|E
500|$|On the moors, when dried turves {{were ready}} to be collected, {{temporary}} track sections were laid {{at right angles to}} the main line, and a portable turntable was installed. A rake of twelve wagons could then be moved onto the temporary track, one at a time, to be filled by a 'filling gang'. Each wagon held about a ton, and once all twelve had been manoeuvred over the turntable back onto the main line, they would be pulled to the works by horses. With the advent of the small Lister engines, a new system was used, where three curved sections of track were used, the end one being clipped onto the top of the main line track. The engines could then push a line of forty or fifty wagons onto the temporary track. Cutting of the peat was mechanised from 1963, with the introduction of German peat-cutting machines, and by 1970, all hand cutting had ceased. Loading of the turves into wagons was also initially by hand, but gradually 'sod collectors' were introduced, which at Swinefleet had a [...] conveyor and at Hatfield a [...] one. These enabled a single side track to serve a much wider section of moor, without having to move the track. Loading turves onto the start of the conveyor was still done manually, but it became difficult <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>people</b> who wanted to do the work, and so Hymac loaders were used to load peat directly into the wagons. The success of this process at Hatfield in 1981 lead to it being used at Swinefleet as well.|$|E
500|$|With [...] "Human Stupidity", Creangă {{builds a}} fable about {{incompetence}} in its absolute forms. The story {{centers on a}} peasant's quest <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>people</b> who are less rational than his wife, having been infuriated by her panic at the remote possibility that a ball of salt could fall from its place of storage and kill their baby. This, essayist and chronicler Simona Vasilache argues, highlights [...] "a family-based division" [...] of illogical behavior, in which women are depicted as the main propagators of both [...] "astonishing nonsense" [...] and [...] "prudent stupidity". Instead, literary critic Ion Pecie identified inside the narrative a meditation on [...] "the link between spirit and nature", with the unpredictable ball of salt representing {{the equivalent of a}} [...] "sphinx". His colleague Gheorghe Grigurcu argued that such conclusions [...] "may seem excessive", but that they were ultimately validated by the literary work being [...] "a plurality of levels". A similar piece is the prose fable [...] "The Story of a Lazy Man": fed up with the protagonist's proverbial indolence, which has led him as far as to view chewing food as an effort, his fellow villagers organize a lynching. This upsets the sensibility of a noblewoman who happens to witness the incident. When she offers to take the lazy man into her care and feed him bread crumbs, he seals his own fate by asking: [...] "But are your bread crumbs soft?" [...] The peculiar effect of this moral is underlined by Anghelescu: [...] "The lazy man dies as a martyr of his own immobility." [...] Braga interpreted the story as evidence of [...] "the primacy of ethics" [...] over social aspects in the local tradition. Ion Pecie saw in the story proof of Creangă's own support for capital punishment with a preventive or didactic purpose, even in cases were the fault was trivial or imagined, concluding: [...] "Here,... Creangă loses much of his depth." [...] Pecie's conclusion was treated with reserve by Grigurcu, who believed that, instead, the narrator refrains from passing any judgment on [...] "the community's instinctual eugenic reaction".|$|E
