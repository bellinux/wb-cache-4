5|$|A major {{difference}} between And Then There Were None and Murder on the Orient Express that Sheldon pointed out {{was that in the}} former, the premise of the novel was that no one solved the murder. This forced Sheldon to desperately {{try to find a way}} to integrate clues into the story so that the player could actually discover the murderer, although the game remained quite uninteractive. In Murder on the Orient Express, the actual novel follows an investigation, so Sheldon could more easily integrate clues to lead to all three possible solutions. Sheldon also excised unnecessary puzzles from Murder on the Orient Express, as <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>an</b> unpopular feature of its predecessor.|$|E
5|$|Archibald {{and colleagues}} {{suggested}} the life habits of Macabeemyrma ovata {{may have been}} similar to extant Myrmeciinae ants. The ant is large with long legs and elongated mandibles. It presumably had large eyes {{that were used to}} hunt for prey and navigation, and the ant was possibly equipped with a sting. Colonies most likely nested in the soil like most other Myrmeciinae, but like some Myrmecia species it is possible <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>an</b> arboreal nesting species. Workers were solitary foragers, foraging on the ground or onto vegetation while preying on arthropods. Workers most likely did not recruit other ants to food sources or lay down pheromone trails.|$|E
5|$|B: Bette Davis's {{performance}} in Of Human Bondage was not {{nominated for an}} Oscar. Several influential people at the time campaigned to have her name included on the list, so for that year (and the following year also) the Academy relaxed its rules and allowed a write-in vote. Technically this meant that any performance was eligible to win the award, regardless of whether <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>an</b> official nominee or not. While the Academy does not officially recognize this as a nomination for Davis, they have included her {{in the list of}} nominees for the 1935 ceremony on their official website.|$|E

5|$|The {{abundance}} of Ypresiomyrma queens collected {{suggests that these}} ants mated in swarms, but the alates were poor flyers due to their large size. The morphology of the mandibles indicate they were specialised tools for excavating chambers in soil or wood during colony foundation; their large size and common occurrence in their geographical range would mean <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>an</b> important food source {{to a variety of}} birds and Paleogene animals that predominately fed on insects.|$|E

Compost blankets were applied to large sections of the soil to replace lost nutrients.

5|$|Anderitum is {{recorded}} in the Notitia Dignitatum as {{the base of the}} praepositus numeri Abulcorum – an infantry unit or numerus of the limitanei or border forces. It also mentions army and naval units bearing the fort's name in connection with the Vicus Julius, in the Roman army in Gaul and stationed at Lutetia (modern Paris). This suggests that by the time the Notitia was written, the original garrison had been moved to Gaul and replaced with the numerus Abulcorum. The Abulci are mentioned in connection with the field army in Gaul and in the suppression of the rebellion of Magnentius in Pannonia Secunda in 351. It is not known whether their name is a geographical or functional one but their description by Zosimus suggests that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>an</b> elite body of troops, who served both in the field army and, probably {{in the form of a}} single detachment, at Anderitum. They may have been foederati, troops raised from allied barbarian tribes and put under the command of a Roman prefect, or perhaps even a single band of warriors with their own leader. Similar numeri were {{recorded in the}} Notitia Dignitata as being stationed in other Saxon Shore forts.|$|E

5|$|Arsenal Football Club is an English {{professional}} association football club based in Holloway, London. The club {{was formed in}} Woolwich in 1886 as Dial Square before being renamed as Royal Arsenal, and then Woolwich Arsenal in 1893. In 1914, the club's name was shortened to Arsenal F.C. after moving to Highbury a year earlier. After spending their first four seasons solely participating in cup tournaments and friendlies, Arsenal became the first southern member admitted into the Football League in 1893. In spite of finishing fifth in the Second Division in 1919, the club was voted to rejoin the First Division {{at the expense of}} local rivals Tottenham Hotspur. Since that time, they have not fallen below the first tier of the English football league system and hold the record for the longest uninterrupted period in the top flight. The club remained in the Football League until 1992, when its First Division was superseded as English football's top level by the newly formed Premier League, of which <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>an</b> inaugural member.|$|E

5|$|Banquets {{have been}} a venue for {{entertainment}} since ancient times, continuing until the 21st century, when they are still being used for many of their original purposes to impress visitors, especially important ones (4, 6, 9); to show hospitality (2, 4, 8); as an occasion to showcase supporting entertainments such as music or dancing, or both (2, 3). <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>an</b> integral part of court entertainments (3, 4) and helped entertainers develop their skills (2, 3). They are also important components of celebrations such as coronations (9), weddings (7), birthdays (10) civic or political achievements (5), military engagements or victories (6) as well as religious obligations (1). In modern times, banquets are commercially available, for example, in restaurants (10) and combined with a performance in dinner theatres. Cooking by professional chefs has also become a form of entertainment as part of global competitions such as the Bocuse d'Or.|$|E

5|$|In the 16th century, the Isles of Scilly were {{ruled by}} the King of England. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>an</b> {{important}} strategic location on the route between mainland Europe, Ireland and Scotland, but threatened {{by the forces of}} France and Spain. Under Henry VIII, a sequence of defensive works called the Device programme had been built to protect the English mainland from French attack, but although a garrison was established at Ennor Castle on the island of St Mary's, no actual construction work was carried out in the islands. After Henry's death in 1547, his nine-year-old son, Edward VI, assumed the throne, with the government controlled by Edward Seymour, the Duke of Somerset. His brother, Thomas, inspected Scilly, resulting in new investments in their defences, initially focused on the island of Tresco. The Duke fell from power in 1549 and a fresh survey was conducted by Captain William Tyrrell; work then began on protecting the island of St Mary's.|$|E
5|$|S. validum {{is known}} from the late Late Cretaceous Belly River Group (the Canadian {{equivalent}} to the Judith River Group in the US), and specimens have been recovered from the Dinosaur Park Formation (late Campanian, 76.5 to 75 mya) in Dinosaur Provincial Park (including the lectotype specimen), and the Oldman Formation (middle Campanian, 77.5 to 76.5 mya) of Alberta, Canada. The pachycephalosaurs Hanssuesia and Foraminacephale are also known from both formations. S. novomexicanum is {{known from the}} Fruitland (late Campanian, about 75 mya) and lower Kirtland Formation (late Campanian, about 74 mya) of New Mexico, and if this species correctly belongs in Stegoceras, the genus {{would have had a}} broad geographic distribution. The presence of similar pachycephalosaurs in both the west and north of North America during the latest Cretaceous shows that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>an</b> important part of the dinosaur faunas there. It has traditionally been suggested that pachycehalosaurs inhabited mountain environments; wear of their skulls was supposedly a result of them having been rolled by water from upland areas, and comparisons with bighorn sheep reinforced the theory. In 2014, Jordan C. Mallon and Evans disputed this idea, as the wear and original locations of the skulls is not consistent with having been transported in such a way, and they instead proposed that North American pachycephalosaurs inhabited alluvial (associated with water) and coastal plain environments.|$|E
5|$|The London Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) Coronation Class is a {{class of}} express {{passenger}} steam locomotives designed by William Stanier. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>an</b> enlarged and improved version of his previous design, the LMS Princess Royal Class. The locomotives were specifically designed for power as {{it was intended to}} use them on express services between London Euston and Glasgow Central; their duties were to include the hauling of a proposed non-stop express, subsequently named the Coronation Scot. The first ten locomotives of the Coronation class were built in a streamlined form in 1937 by the addition of a steel streamlined casing. Five of these ten were specifically set aside to pull the Coronation Scot. Although a later batch of five unstreamlined locomotives was produced in 1938, most of the ensuing Coronation class were outshopped as streamliners. Eventually, from 1944 to 1949, all new engines would be built in unstreamlined form and all the streamliners would have their casings removed. The very last of the 38 locomotives was completed in 1948.|$|E

5|$|The M {{class was}} {{intended}} {{for use as a}} scout for the commerce raiding squadrons envisioned under Plan Z. The ships design process started in 1936; the ships were intended for long-range commerce raiding. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>an</b> improvement over previous designs, which suffered from insufficient range to be effective commerce raiders. However, the requirements placed on the designhigh maximum and cruising speeds, long range, heavy armament, and armor sufficient to withstand 15cm shells, all on a displacement no more than 8,000metric tonswere deemed impossible by the design staff. In July 1937, the Oberbefehlshaber der Marine (commander in chief of the navy) requested proposals from both the naval design staff as well as private dockyards. None of the designs by the dockyards were practical, and so the official design, which only met some of the requirements, was chosen.|$|E
5|$|The {{whistling}} ducks, Dendrocygna, are {{a distinctive}} {{group of eight}} bird species within the duck, goose and swan family Anatidae, which are characterised by a hump-backed, long-necked appearance and the whistled flight calls that give them their English name. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>an</b> early split from the main duck lineage, and were predominant in the Late Miocene before the subsequent extensive radiation of more modern forms in the Pliocene and later. The fulvous whistling duck forms a superspecies with the wandering whistling duck.

5|$|<b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>an</b> {{essential}} part of traditional Tahitian society. Dog teeth were fashioned into fishhooks and dog bones were made into weapons and implements. They also used dog hair, especially the long tail hairs of the Tuamotuan varieties of dogs, to decorate {{the fringes of the}} taumi – a traditional breast ornament often called a gorget – which were worn by priests and high chiefs. The Tuamotuan breed were described as similar to their Tahitian counterparts distinguishable by their longer hair. Historian Margaret Titcomb noted that Tuamotuan varieties may not have been a separate breed that developed in isolation, arguing that the people of the Tuamotus could have eaten their short hair varieties and kept their longer haired dogs for exports to the Society Islands.|$|E
