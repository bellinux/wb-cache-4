5|$|Either {{side of the}} Saloon are {{two smaller}} drawing rooms (8, 10), which would {{originally}} have served as private withdrawing rooms from the more public activities which would {{have taken place in}} the Marble Hall and Saloon. One of these rooms, now called the Tyrconnel Room (10), was transformed into the principal or state bedroom during the occupancy of Lord Tyrconnel in an attempt to create a more fashionable suite of Baroque state rooms on the first floor. After his death in 1754, it became a Billiard Room, until the 3rd Earl Brownlow had it refurnished more than a century later. Unusually, <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>is</b> painted with the family arms and crest. The date of <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>is</b> not known for certain but the early nineteenth century has been suggested.|$|E
5|$|On {{its walls}} {{are dozens of}} bronze plaques that {{indicate}} {{the locations of the}} remains of most of Mexico City's former archbishops, including Cardinal Ernesto Corripio y Ahumada. <b>The</b> <b>floor</b> <b>is</b> covered with small marble slabs covering niches containing the remains of other people.|$|E
2500|$|<b>The</b> structure's {{interior}} <b>floors</b> <b>were</b> {{also made}} precast concrete. However, <b>the</b> <b>floors</b> <b>were</b> almost made of more than-traditional materials.

But after extensive discussions between GSA and Breuer, GSA relented.

5|$|A bronze-covered door, {{with relief}} panels {{depicting}} figures, opens onto the entrance hall. In Burges's time {{the door had}} a letterbox, {{in the form of}} Mercury, the messenger of the gods. The letterbox is now lost, but a contemporary copy is in the collection of The Higgins Art Gallery & Museum. The porch contains a white marble seat and column, and on <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>is</b> a mosaic of Pinkie, a favourite poodle of Burges. Cartooned by H.W.

5|$|The Brooklyn Free School holds a weekly, {{mandatory}} Democratic Meeting on Wednesday mornings. The meeting {{runs the}} school, and {{students and teachers}} alike have equal votes.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>floor</b> <b>is</b> of Jura marble, the altar, ambo, baptismal font and {{tabernacle}} {{are made}} of Lahn marble. The wall behind the altar held a neo-gothic crucifixion scene of Mary, John, and Mary Magdalene under the cross, from the Magdalenenkirche. Low stained glass windows forming the Stations of the Cross were designed by Paul Corazolla from Berlin. The first organ was built by E. F. Walcker & Cie. and consecrated in 1974. It {{was placed on the}} right side in the opening for the chapel, visible to the congregation. The free-standing bell tower, housing four bells, is 42m high.|$|E
50|$|Generally, the {{interior}} has {{a mixture of}} timber boarded and concrete <b>floors</b> on <b>the</b> ground <b>floor</b> and timber boarded <b>floors</b> on <b>the</b> first <b>floor.</b> <b>The</b> interior walls of <b>the</b> ground <b>floor</b> <b>are</b> rendered masonry and the internal walls of <b>the</b> first <b>floor</b> <b>are</b> mostly rendered masonry with some timber boarded partitioning.

5|$|There are benches in {{the main}} aisle and confessionals in the side aisles. The confessionals {{contained}} benches until {{the closure of the}} church in 1938. After its reconstruction, the left side was reserved for women, and the right for men. Both side aisles are separated from the main aisle by pillar files, consisting of four columns and two half columns. The columns and the roof are painted in white, and the walls in cream. <b>The</b> <b>floor</b> <b>is</b> constructed from light and dark grey marble slabs in a chequered pattern.|$|E
5|$|The Hall of Ambassadors ("Sala dos Embaixadores"), {{sometimes}} called the throne room or the Hall of Mirrors, was designed by Robillon in 1757 {{and is one of}} the largest reception rooms in the palace. This long low room has a ceiling painted by Francisco de Melo which depicts the Portuguese royal family attending a concert during the reign of Queen Maria I. The room is extremely wide and light, spanning the full width of the palace, with tall windows on both sides. Between each window is a semi-circular gilt console table above which are pier glasses adorned with crystal sconces. The throne dais, set in an apse, is flanked by gilded and mirrored columns, and <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>is</b> a chequer board pattern of black and white marble tiles.|$|E
5|$|The {{design of}} a Floorless Coaster has one main {{difference}} from traditional steel roller coasters around the world: it has no floors between the seats. While a train is in the station, a floor is used only for loading and unloading purposes. Because the front row has nothing {{in front of it}} to stop riders from walking {{over the edge of the}} station, a gate is placed in front of the train to prevent this from happening. Once all the over-the-shoulder restraints are locked, the floor separates into several pieces and moves underneath the station. The gate then opens, allowing the train to move forward. When the train returns to the station, <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>is</b> brought back up and the gate is closed as the next riders board the roller coaster. Aside from the station, a Floorless Coaster has several inversions similar to B's Sitting Coasters.|$|E

5|$|The station {{consists}} of a central island platform between the tracks that are elevated on a railway embankment. There are four tracks through the site {{although there are no}} platforms for the c2c lines. The full length of the platform is covered by a single station canopy with a central waiting room. The Art Deco red brick ticket office is located below platform level to which it is connected by a subway and stairway. Although similar to the other single-storey station buildings on this part of the route, it is notable for its high atrium roof and polygonal shape. <b>The</b> <b>floor</b> <b>is</b> tiled with a reversed swastika pattern, a popular decorative design at the time the station was constructed. The station is listed as a building of local heritage interest by Havering London Borough Council.|$|E
5|$|Lisa {{learns that}} Derek and Sharon {{will be going}} away from town for a few days, with Sharon leaving one {{afternoon}} and Derek the next day. While Sharon is {{on her way to}} pick up Kyle, she realizes she forgot to set the alarm system and returns home. Meanwhile, Lisa breaks into Derek and Sharon's house again and decorates the master bed with rose petals. While setting the alarm, Sharon hears Lisa in the bedroom. She confronts Lisa, who tries to convince her that Derek was seeing Lisa. However, Sharon sees through her lie and attempts to call the police, but Lisa tackles her to the floor, and the two engage in a fistfight. Derek calls the home phone and Lisa answers; he calls Detective Reese and they both head toward the house. Lisa runs to the attic and Sharon pursues her. Sharon leads her to a weak spot in the attic floor, where Lisa falls through. Seeing that Lisa is in mortal danger, Sharon reaches out in an attempt to grab Lisa and lift her up, but Lisa refuses and tries to pull Sharon down with her. Seeing that <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>is</b> beginning to buckle, Sharon pries Lisa off of her arm. Lisa falls and smashes onto the glass table below. A chandelier falls from the ceiling onto Lisa, eventually killing her. Detective Reese arrives as Sharon comes out of the house. As soon as Detective Reese goes inside the house to investigate Lisa's actions, Derek soon arrives; he and Sharon then tearfully embrace one another.|$|E
