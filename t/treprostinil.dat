5000|$|About {{the same}} time, a {{teenager}} was similarly diagnosed with systemic Degos disease and became gravely ill. Lee Shapiro MD and Aixa Toledo-Garcia MD at Albany Medical College {{learned of the}} success with the adult patient, {{and became the first}} physicians to successfully treat a pediatric Degos patient with eculizumab. Dr. Shapiro later observed the resolution of Degos skin lesions in an adult patient with an overlap syndrome involving systemic lupus, systemic sclerosis, and Degos disease who was treated with <b>treprostinil</b> for her pulmonary hypertension. His pediatric Degos patient was developing significant complications despite treatment with eculizumab, and Dr. Shapiro's group became the first to treat a Degos patient with <b>treprostinil.</b> [...] To this point, all known long-term survivors of systemic Degos disease are being treated with a combination of eculizumab and <b>treprostinil.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Since <b>treprostinil</b> is a vasodilator, its {{antihypertensive}} {{effect may}} be compounded by other medications {{that affect the}} blood pressure, including calcium channel blockers, diuretics, and other vasodilating agents.|$|E
50|$|The {{outcome of}} this disease can be fatal with a median {{survival}} of 2 to 3 years, although some {{appear to have a}} benign form (Degos acanthoma) which affects only the skin. Laparoscopy may be an effective means of screening those with cutaneous lesions to determine if systemic disease is present. Treatment options are limited, and until recently consisted mainly of antiplatelet drugs or anticoagulants or immunosuppressants with few reports of prolonged survival. More recently eculizumab and <b>treprostinil</b> have been employed. Discovered by dermatopathologist, Cynthia Magro, response to eculizumab is often immediate and dramatic, but has been of limited duration and is expensive, needing to be infused every 14 days. <b>Treprostinil</b> use has been reported to result in clearing of gastrointestinal and CNS findings as well as clearing of cutaneous lesions, but reports are limited. <b>Treprostinil</b> may be more effective than other vasodilators because it may also increase the population of circulating endothelial cells, allowing angiogenesis.|$|E

50|$|There is no cure. Treatment {{depends on}} the type of disease. A number of {{supportive}} measures such as oxygen therapy, diuretics, and medications to inhibit clotting may be used. Medications specifically for the condition include epoprostenol, <b>treprostinil,</b> iloprost, bosentan, ambrisentan, macitentan, and sildenafil.

50|$|<b>Treprostinil</b> is {{substantially}} metabolized by the liver, but the involved enzymes are not currently known. Five metabolites (HU1 through HU5) {{have been described}} thus far.

Whether Remodulin induces these enzymes has not been studied.|$|E
50|$|Prostacyclin (prostaglandin I2) is {{commonly}} {{considered the most}} effective treatment for PAH. Epoprostenol (synthetic prostacyclin) is given via continuous infusion that requires a semi-permanent central venous catheter. This delivery system can cause sepsis and thrombosis. Prostacyclin is unstable, and therefore {{has to be kept}} on ice during administration. Since it has a half-life of 3 to 5 minutes, the infusion has to be continuous, and interruption can be fatal. Other prostanoids have therefore been developed. <b>Treprostinil</b> can be given intravenously or subcutaneously, but the subcutaneous form can be very painful. An increased risk of sepsis with intravenous Remodulin has been reported by the CDC. Iloprost is also used in Europe intravenously and has a longer half life. Iloprost was the only inhaled form of prostacyclin approved for use in the US and Europe, until the inhaled form of <b>treprostinil</b> was approved by the FDA in July 2009.|$|E
50|$|On December 31, 2014, United Therapeutics {{announced}} {{a deal with}} DEKA, {{for the development of}} a potential technology breakthrough in the subcutaneous delivery of its Remodulin (<b>treprostinil)</b> injection to patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) via a pre-filled semi-disposable pump system.According to Martine Rothblatt, “The new DEKA semi-disposable pump system will advance the convenience and delivery of subcutaneous Remodulin”. Rothblatt is a collaborator on inventions with DEKA's founder Dean Kamen.|$|E
50|$|<b>Treprostinil</b> is {{indicated}} {{for the treatment}} of pulmonary arterial hypertension in patients with NYHA Class II-IV symptoms to diminish symptoms associated with exercise. It may be administered as a continuous subcutaneous infusion or continuous intravenous infusion; however, because of the risks associated with chronic indwelling central venous catheters, including serious blood stream infections, continuous intravenous infusion should be reserved for patients who are intolerant of the subcutaneous route, or in whom these risks are considered warranted. This medication is also available in inhaled and tablet forms.|$|E
50|$|The {{infusion}} rate {{is normally}} initiated at 1.25 ng/kg/min for new patients, {{but may be}} reduced to 0.625 ng/kg/min if the normal rate provokes unwanted side effects in the patient. The infusion rate of <b>treprostinil</b> should be increased no more than 1.25 ng/kg/min per week for the first month, then 2.5 ng/kg/min per week for the remaining duration of infusion. The infusion rate should ideally be high enough to improve symptoms of pulmonary hypertension, while minimizing unpleasant side effects (headache, nausea, emesis, restlessness, anxiety and infusion site pain or reaction). Dosage adjustments may be undertaken more often if tolerated. There is little experience with doses >40 ng/kg/min. Abrupt cessation of infusion should be avoided. Restarting a Remodulin infusion {{within a few hours}} after an interruption can be done using the same dose rate. Interruptions for longer periods may require the dose of Remodulin to be re-titrated.|$|E
5000|$|PGD2 binds to and {{activates}} DP1 at {{concentrations in}} the 0.5 to 1 nanomolar range. Relative potencies in binding to and activating DP1 for the following prostanoids are: PGD2>>PGE2>Prostaglandin F2alpha>PGI2=thromboxane A2, with PGD2 being more than 100-fold more potent than PGE2 in binding to and stimulating DP1. (http://www.guidetopharmacology.org/GRAC/ObjectDisplayForward?objectId=338). PDJ2, Δ12-PDJ2, and 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-PGJ2, which form in vitro and in vivo rapidly as non-enzymatic rearrangements of PGD2 (see Cyclopentenone prostaglandins), also bind to and activate DP1, with PDJ2 doing so almost as effectively as PDG2 and the latter two PGJs doing so 100-fold and 300-fold less potently than PDG2. [...] Other compounds, e.g. L-644,698, BW 245C, BW A868C, and ZK 110841, have been synthesized, found to be about as potent as PGD2 in binding to and stimulating DP1, and used to study the function of this receptor.The drug <b>Treprostinil</b> is a high affinity ligand for and potent activator of not only DP1 but also two other prostanoid receptors, EP2 and IP.|$|E
50|$|IP {{receptor}} agonists are front-line {{drugs to}} treat pulmonary hypertension. Major drugs {{in this category}} include PGI2 itself (i.e. epoprostenol), iloprost, <b>treprostinil,</b> and beraprost with epoprostenol being favored in some studies. However, newly developed IP agonists with favorable pharmacological features such as Selexipag have been granted by the US FDA Orphan Drug status {{for the treatment of}} pulmonary hypertension. IP agonists are also to treat severe vasoconstriction in Raynaud's disease, Raynaud's disease-like syndromes, and scleroderma. Epoprostenol causes improvements in hemodynamic parameters and oxygenation in patients suffering the acute respiratory distress syndrome but due to the limited number of randomized clinical trials and lack of studies investigating mortality, its use cannot be recommended as standard of care for this disease and should be reserved for those refractory to traditional therapies. A meta-analysis of 18 clinical trials on the use of prostanoids including prinicpally IP receptor agonists on patients with sever lower limb peripheral artery disease due to diverse causes found that these drugs may reduce the extent of limb tissue that needed to be amputated. However, the studies did not support extensive use of prostanoids in patients with critical limb ischemia as an adjunct to revascularization or as an alternative to major amputation in cases which cannot undergo revascularization.|$|E

40|$|Prostaglandins {{have been}} {{evaluated}} {{for their ability to}} reduce IRI after liver transplantation; however, poor stability, side effects and the inability to show a significant difference in primary endpoint have limited their clinical application. <b>Treprostinil,</b> a prostacyclin (PGI 2) analog, has a higher potency and longer elimination half-life than other commercially available PGI 2 analogs. We examined the efficacy of <b>treprostinil</b> to prevent IRI during OLT. OLT was performed in syngeneic Lewis rats after 18 h of cold preservation (4 °C) in the UW solution. IRI significantly increased serum ALT and AST levels, neutrophil infiltration, hepatic necrosis and mRNA levels of proinflammatory cytokines post-OLT, while treatment with <b>treprostinil</b> decreased all the parameters. Cold storage of liver grafts significantly reduced ATP levels and <b>treprostinil</b> restored energy levels in liver grafts early postreperfusion.

40|$|Pulmonary {{arterial}} hypertension (PAH) is a progressive and fatal vascular disease {{that is more}} prevalent in women than men. The underlying pathology of the disease involves various factors, including genetic risk (i. e. bone morphogenetic protein receptor type II (BMPR-II) mutations) {{as well as the}} influence of hormones such as estrogen. Among the frontline treatments for PAH is prostacyclin therapy; however, the short half-life and associated problems with the need for continuous intravenous administration of synthetic prostacyclin have {{led to the development of}} newer analogues such as <b>treprostinil.</b> These have the advantages of a longer half-life and the possibility of subcutaneous and inhaled administration. Mortality rates for PAH are still high despite advancements in treatment, with male survival rates remaining lower than females. The BMPR-II signalling pathway may underlie some of the sex disparity that exists in incidence of PAH. However, patient responses to treatments for PAH have also demonstrated sex-specific effects. A key aim of this study was to identify the influence that sex may have on the actions of <b>treprostinil</b> with in-vivo and in-vitro models of PH. The ability to target treatment to specific sub-cohorts of PH is important to maximise the therapeutic effect of <b>treprostinil.</b> A greater understanding of how the effects of <b>treprostinil</b> are mediated could assist this objective. To examine any potential influence of sex on the effects of <b>treprostinil,</b> we examined the chronic hypoxic model of pulmonary hypertension (PH). Female and male rats were dosed with sub-cutaneously implanted pellets releasing <b>treprostinil</b> at 100 ng/kg/min or 400 ng/kg/min. Under hypoxic conditions both male and female rats had increases in right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP), right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH) and pulmonary artery remodelling. 100 ng/kg/min of <b>treprostinil</b> partially reversed RVSP, RVH and pulmonary artery remodelling in female hypoxic rats but not in male rats. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis revealed that a possible mechanism of <b>treprostinil</b> was increasing BMPR-II signalling, specifically Id 1 and Id 3 (inhibitor of DNA binding protein 1 / 3). This was only observed in female hypoxic rats. Despite no difference in terminal plasma levels of <b>treprostinil,</b> hypoxic males remained unaffected by <b>treprostinil</b> at 100 ng/kg/min. However, 400 ng/kg/min of <b>treprostinil</b> led to slightly greater decreases in RVSP, RVH and remodelling indices in female rats, also it partially reversed RVSP, RVH and remodelling in male rats. Taqman qRT-PCR of the prostaglandin receptors demonstrated an increase in prostaglandin E 2 receptor 2 (EP 2) under hypoxic conditions with 100 ng/kg/min and 400 ng/kg/min <b>treprostinil</b> treatment, specific to female rats. Also under hypoxic conditions female and male rats had significant increases in mRNA expression of potassium two pore domain channel subfamily K (KCNK 3). To translate clinical relevance from the in-vivo findings, the influence of sex on <b>treprostinil</b> was investigated in human pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (hPASMCs) taken from non-PAH (control) and PAH patients. In female control hPASMCs FBS (fetal bovine serum) induced proliferation was partially ablated by treprostinil; this effect was only observed in male control hPASMCs at the highest <b>treprostinil</b> concentration (10 µM). In patient hPASMCs, <b>treprostinil</b> had a similar effect in reducing FBS-induced proliferation in both female and males. The addition of a low dose (30 nM) of endothelin- 1 (ET- 1) increased the anti-proliferative effect of <b>treprostinil,</b> specifically, in female control hPASMCs. The addition of a dual endothelin receptor antagonist (SB- 217242) partially reduced the anti-proliferative effect of <b>treprostinil</b> in combination with ET- 1. Taqman qRT-PCR and western blot analysis demonstrated no difference between sexes or hPASMC groups in the expression of the prostaglandin receptors. Using receptor specific antagonists, it was determined that the anti-proliferative actions of <b>treprostinil</b> in PAH patient hPASMCs were partially mediated via the EP 2 receptor. However, in female control hPASMCs, the IP receptor was primarily responsible for this effect. BMPR-II signalling was investigated to ascertain its role in the anti-proliferative effects of <b>treprostinil.</b> Taqman qRT-PCR indicated <b>treprostinil</b> (100 nM and 1 µM) induced increases in Id 1 and Id 3 mRNA in female control hPASMCs, this did not occur in male control hPASMCs. <b>Treprostinil</b> (100 nM and 1 µM) led to Id 3 mRNA increases in female PAH patient hPASMCs, whereas in male PAH patient hPASMCs <b>treprostinil</b> (1 µM) led to a significant Id 3 mRNA increase. Western blots indicated that Id 3 was upregulated by <b>treprostinil</b> (1 µM) stimulation in female control and female PAH hPASMCs vs non-stimulated hPASMCs; this effect was not observed in males. The combination of ET- 1 and <b>treprostinil</b> did not influence BMPR-II signalling. After 24 hours of <b>treprostinil</b> stimulation increased Id 3 mRNA expression was observed in all hPASMCs groups. <b>Treprostinil</b> only increased Id 1 mRNA in PAH patient hPASMCs. Although western blots confirmed <b>treprostinil</b> (100 nM and 1 µM) mediated increases in Id 1 protein expression in female control hPASMCs. <b>Treprostinil</b> (100 nM and 1 µM) increased Id 3 protein expression in female control and female PAH patient hPASMCs. <b>Treprostinil</b> (1 µM) in combination with ET- 1 led to a significant increase in Id 3 protein expression in male control hPASMCs. As with 72 -hour <b>treprostinil</b> stimulation, BMPR-II signalling was not influenced by the combination of ET- 1 and <b>treprostinil</b> in the other hPASMC groups. The increased BMPR-II signalling in female control and female PAH patient hPASMCs at 24 hours led to the investigation of prostaglandin receptors role in activating BMPR-II signalling. After 24 -hours of stimulation with <b>treprostinil</b> (100 nM), Id protein induction was partially blocked by dual antagonism of the IP and EP 2 receptor in both female control and female PAH patient hPASMCs. To summarise these findings, we have identified sex differences in the action of <b>treprostinil</b> in both in-vivo and in-vitro models of PH. Treatment with a low dose (100 ng/kg/min) of <b>treprostinil</b> led to a significant reduction in chronic hypoxic induced PH in female rats but not in males. These differences are driven partially by increases in BMPR-II signalling. Treatment with a higher dose (400 ng/kg/min) of <b>treprostinil</b> led to significant reductions in chronic hypoxic PH in both female and male rats. In hPASMCs the results demonstrate that <b>treprostinil</b> can induce the Id proteins of the BMPR-II signalling pathway and that this may account for the greater anti-proliferative effect observed in female control hPASMCs. The induction of the Id proteins was found to be partially mediated by activation of the IP and EP 2 prostaglandin receptors. The results suggest that sex may influence the beneficial effects of <b>treprostinil</b> in an in-vivo model of PH and in hPASMCs...|$|E

Thesis (M. S.) University of Missouri-Columbia 2005. <b>Treprostinil</b> is a prostacyclin analog currently used in the treatment of pulmonary hypertension. Although clinical studies show <b>treprostinil</b> to be a successful therapy for pulmonary hypertension, little information exists concerning the effects of <b>treprostinil</b> treatment in vivo. The {{purpose of this study is}} to elucidate the effects of <b>treprostinil</b> on right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP), right ventricular hypertrophy and vascular remodeling in a rat model of MCT-induced pulmonary hypertension. Male, Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized to one of four treatment groups; control, monocrotaline (MCT) only, MCT with <b>treprostinil</b> treatment (MCT/TRE), and <b>treprostinil</b> treatment only (TRE). At the beginning of the experiment, rats received a one-time subcutaneous dose of MCT (60 mg/kg) or saline. Rats were then administered either <b>treprostinil</b> or placebo for 28 -days. After 28 -days of <b>treprostinil</b> treatment, we recorded RVSP and right ventricular size. In addition, paraffin embedded left whole lung tissues were used for morphometric analysis and right whole lung tissues were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen for protein analysis. As expected, MCT exposure caused a significant increase in RVSP and right ventricular hypertrophy. Morphometric analyses also indicated that MCT-exposure led to medial wall thickening of the pulmonary vasculature. Neither low-dose (10 ng/kg/min) nor high-dose (150 ng/kg/min) <b>treprostinil</b> therapy attenuated elevations of RVSP and right ventricular hypertrophy in pulmonary hypertensive rats. In addition, there was no attenuation of medial wall thickening when MCT-exposed rats also received <b>treprostinil</b> treatment. Finally, <b>treprostinil</b> significantly lowered PPAR-[gamma] protein expression in MCT-exposed rats. In conclusion, we demonstrated that increases in RVSP, right ventricular hypertrophy and vascular remodeling associated with MCT-induced pulmonary hypertension are not attenuated with <b>treprostinil</b> therapy. Additionally, we found that <b>treprostinil</b> attenuated the induction of PPAR-[gamma] protein levels in whole lung homogenates of MCT-exposed rats. Although we have not yet established that PPAR-[gamma] is an important therapeutic target for pulmonary hypertension, we speculate that further investigation of its role could reveal a mechanism in which PGI₂ elicits its effects on the pulmonary vasculature...|$|E
40|$|SummaryBackgroundTransition from {{intravenous}} (IV) epoprostenol to IV <b>treprostinil</b> {{in patients}} with pulmonary hypertension (PH) has traditionally been performed by gradually decreasing the epoprostenol dose while increasing the <b>treprostinil</b> dose. Preliminary data suggest that this transition can be performed more rapidly {{without the need for}} epoprostenol weaning. We conducted a single center, prospective clinical trial to assess the safety, efficacy, and treatment satisfaction of rapidly switching from epoprostenol to IV <b>treprostinil.</b> MethodsThis study included patients with PH who had rapidly transitioned from epoprostenol to IV <b>treprostinil.</b> Data collected included clinical status, adverse events, PH symptoms, and previously validated measures of quality of life and treatment satisfaction. ResultsTen patients were enrolled in this study. Exercise capacity measured by mean 6 -min walk distance was maintained from baseline throughout follow-up. Severity of disease as assessed by WHO functional class was maintained or improved for the majority of patients. Adverse events were minimal during the transition, and all patients remained on IV <b>treprostinil</b> throughout the follow-up period. A favorable impact on quality of life and treatment satisfaction measures was observed by eight weeks following the transition from epoprostenol to IV <b>treprostinil.</b> Specifically, time spent on drug preparation activities decreased by 39. 5 % with <b>treprostinil</b> compared to epoprostenol.

40|$|<b>Treprostinil</b> is a stable, long-acting {{prostacyclin}} analogue {{which can}} be administered as a continuous subcutaneous infusion using a portable miniature delivery system. Subcutaneous <b>treprostinil</b> {{has been shown in}} a large multicenter randomized controlled trial to improve exercise capacity, clinical state, functional class, pulmonary hemodynamics, and quality of life in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension, an uncommon disease of poor prognosis. Side effects include facial flush, headache, jaw pain, abdominal cramping, and diarrhea, all typical of prostacyclin, and manageable by symptom-directed dose adjustments, and infusion site pain which may make further treatment impossible in 7 %– 10 % of the patients. Long-term survival in pulmonary arterial hypertension patients treated with subcutaneous <b>treprostinil</b> is similar to that reported with intravenous epoprostenol. There are uncontrolled data suggesting efficacy of subcutaneous <b>treprostinil</b> in chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. <b>Treprostinil</b> can also be administered intravenously, although increased doses, up to 2 – 3 times those given subcutaneously, appear to be needed to obtain the same efficacy.

40|$|Das Prostazyklinanalogon <b>Treprostinil</b> ist für die Therapie der pulmonalarteriellen Hypertonie in Form einer kontinuierlich intravenösen und subkutanen Applikation zugelassen. Die Wirksamkeit einer inhalativen Prostazyklintherapie konnte schon in einer kontrollierten randomisierten Studie für Iloprost bestätigt werden. Die inhalative Verabreichung von <b>Treprostinil</b> wurde inzwischen entwickelt und zeigte eine länger andauernde pulmonale Vasodilatation und geringere systemische Nebenwirkungen als inhalatives Iloprost. Ziel dieser Arbeit war zu zeigen, dass inhalatives <b>Treprostinil</b> als pulmonal und intrapulmonal selektiver Vasodilatator wirksam ist. Verglichen wurde es mit NO, welches als Prototyp der pulmonal und intrapulmonal selektiven Vasodilatation gilt. Es wurde Bezug genommen auf die pulmonale und systemische Hämodynamik. Zudem sollte untersucht werden, ob die Inhalation des hochkonzentrierten Treprostinil-Aerosols zu Gasaustauschstörungen führt und somit den Shuntfluss und die Niedrig-Ventilations/Perfusions-Areale (Low V/Q) in der Lunge erhöht. Das Patientenkollektiv bestand aus 19 Patienten mit schwerer präkapillärer pulmonaler Hypertension mit vorbestehenden Gasaustauschstörungen der Untergruppen CTEPH (n= 8), ILD (n= 7) und PAH (n= 4). Den Patienten wurde zu Beginn ein Swan-Ganz-Katheter eingelegt und dann inhalierten sie zuerst 20 ppm NO gefolgt von 45 µg (n= 10) oder 60 µg (n= 9) <b>Treprostinil.</b> Das Ventilations/Perfusions-Verhältnis wurde zum Zeitpunkt der Anfangsruhephase, nach NO-Inhalation und 60 Minuten nach der Treprostinil-Inhalation mittels MIGET (multiple {{inert gas}} {{elimination}} technique) bestimmt. Die hämodynamischen Parameter wurden ebenfalls zu definierten Zeitpunkten aufgezeichnet. In unseren Untersuchungen konnten wir ermitteln, dass es sowohl nach der NO-Inhalation als auch nach der Inhalation mit <b>Treprostinil</b> zu keiner Zunahme der Shuntperfusion und der Perfusion der Niedrig-Ventilations/Perfusions-Areale (Low V/Q) kommt. Unsere Messungen der hämodynamischen Parameter wiesen nach Treprostinil-Inhalation eine stärkere Reduktion des mPAP und des PVR als nach NO-Inhalation auf. Die Parameter des systemischen Blutkreislaufs mSAP und SVR zeigten sowohl nach Treprostinil- als auch nach NO-Inhalation keine signifikanten Unterschiede. Gasaustauschstörungen und systemische Nebenwirkungen konnten im Rahmen dieser Studie nicht festgestellt werden. Somit stellte die Inhalation von inhalativem <b>Treprostinil</b> eine pulmonale und intrapulmonale Selektivität wie der Prototyp NO dar. The prostacyclin analogue <b>treprostinil</b> is approved {{for treatment of}} pulmonary hypertension in form of subcutaneous and continuous intravenous application. The efficacy of inhalative prostacyclin in treatment of pulmonary hypertension has already been shown in a controlled randomised study for iloprost. The inhalative application of <b>treprostinil</b> has then been developed later on. In comparison with iloprost <b>treprostinil</b> proved out to cause a longer lasting vasodilatation and lesser systemic side effects. By performing the study we wanted to show that inhalative <b>treprostinil</b> works as a pulmonary and intrapulmonary selective vasodilatator. It {{has been compared to}} NO which is considered to be the prototype concerning pulmonary and intrapulmonary selective vasodilatation. In the study, both NO and <b>treprostinil</b> were compared with regard to their pulmonary and systemic hemodynamics. Moreover we intended to examine whether the inhalation of highly concentrated <b>treprostinil</b> aerosols leads to impairment of gas exchange and thus increases shuntflow and low-ventilation/perfusion areas in the lung. The patient collective consisted of 19 patients suffering from severe pulmonary hypertension with pre-existing compromised gas exchange of the subgroups CTEPH (n= 8), ILD (n= 7) and PAH (n= 4). At the beginning the patients received a Swan-Ganz catheter. After that they first inhaled 20 ppm NO followed by 45 µg or 60 µg <b>treprostinil.</b> The ventilation/perfusion distribution was determined by MIGET (multiple inert gas elimination technique) at baseline, after NO inhalation and 60 minutes after <b>treprostinil</b> inhalation. The hemodynamic parameters were also recorded at defined times. Our examinations demonstrated that after NO inhalation as well as after inhalation of <b>treprostinil</b> there was no increase of the shuntflow or the perfusion of the low-ventilation/perfusion areas. Our measurements pointed out a stronger reduction of mPAP and PVR after <b>treprostinil</b> inhalation than after NO inhalation. SVR and mSAP, parameters of the systemic blood circulation, didnt show significant differences after <b>Treprostinil</b> inhalation as well as after NO inhalation. The inhalation of inhalative <b>treprostinil</b> presented the same pulmonary and intrapulmonary selectivity as the prototype NO. Like this disturbances of gas exchange and systemic side effects after <b>treprostinil</b> inhalation could be ruled out...|$|E
40|$|In {{patients}} who require urgent initiation of {{pulmonary arterial hypertension}} medications due to disease progression, it is customary to start intravenous prostacyclin therapy, typically during a hospital admission. If there are complicating factors or relative contraindications to intravenous and subcutaneous prostanoids, oral <b>treprostinil</b> provides another pathway to prostanoid therapy, but this usually requires a prolonged titration. We describe {{the case of a}} thirty-six-year-old male with severe pulmonary arterial hypertension and contraindication to intravenous and subcutaneous prostanoid therapy due to congenital deafness and the risk of not hearing the intravenous pump alarms. Intravenous <b>treprostinil</b> was initiated, titrated to high dose, and then rapidly transitioned to oral <b>treprostinil.</b> A rapid initiation, titration, and transition from intravenous to oral <b>treprostinil</b> can be safely performed under watchful supervision in order to achieve higher and more efficacious doses of oral <b>treprostinil</b> in a timely manner...|$|E
40|$|Gérald Simonneau, MD; {{on behalf}} of the <b>Treprostinil</b> Study Group† Study objectives: To assess the {{efficacy}} and safety of continuous subcutaneous infusion of <b>treprostinil,</b> a stable prostacyclin analogue, for treating pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) in patients with connective tissue disease (CTD). Design: Two multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, prospective trials of <b>treprostinil</b> vs placebo in 470 patients with PAH. Patients: A subset of 90 patients with PAH and CTD, including systemic lupus erythematosus, diffuse scleroderma, limited scleroderma, and mixed CTD/overlap syndrome. Interventions: Patients received either <b>treprostinil</b> (initiated at 1. 25 ng/kg/min, and titrated upward) or placebo via continuous subcutaneous infusion. The maximum dose of <b>treprostinil</b> allowed was 22. 5 ng/kg/min. Measurements: Six-minute walk (6 MW) distance and dyspnea-fatigue scores were determined at baseline, and at 6 weeks and 12 weeks. Hemodynamic measures were obtained at baseline and at 12 weeks. Results: At baseline, most patients had New York Heart Association class III symptoms. The mean baseline 6 MW distance was 289 m (range, 60 to 448 m). The mean dose of <b>treprostinil</b> at week 12 was 8. 4 ng/kg/min (range, 1. 25 to 17. 5 ng/kg/min). After 12 weeks, the change in cardiac index from baseline was 0. 2 0. 08 L/min/m 2 in the <b>treprostinil</b> group and 0. 07 0. 07 L/min/m 2 in the placebo group (p 0. 007). The pulmonary vascular resistance index decreased by 4 2 U m 2 in the <b>treprostinil</b> group and increased by 1 1 U m 2 in the placebo group (p 0. 006). The placebo-corrected median improvement from baseline in 6 MW distance was 25 m in treprostinil-treated patients (p 0. 055); this improvement appeared to be dose related. Dyspnea fatigue scores also improved in the <b>treprostinil</b> group compared with the placebo group (p 0. 014). Adverse events included infusion site pain and typical side effects related to prostaglandins, and were tolerated by most patients. Conclusions: Continuous subcutaneous infusion of <b>treprostinil</b> in patients with PAH associated with CTD improved exercise capacity, symptoms of PAH, and hemodynamics...|$|E
