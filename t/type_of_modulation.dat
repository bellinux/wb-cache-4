25|$|The <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>modulation</b> used is {{normally}} DE-QPSK, although DE-BPSK {{is used on}} the uplink (mobile to satellite) for acquisition and synchronization. Each time slot is 8.28 ms long and sits in a 90 ms frame. Within each FDMA channel there are four TDMA time slots in each direction. The TDMA frame starts off with a 20.32 ms period used for simplex messaging to devices such as pagers and to alert Iridium phones of an incoming call, followed by the four upstream slots and four downstream slots. This technique is known as time-division multiplexing. Small guard periods are used between time slots. Regardless of the modulation method being used, communication between mobile units and satellites is performed at 25 kilobaud.|$|E
500|$|An {{emission}} designation is of {{the form}} BBBB 123 45, where BBBB is the bandwidth of the signal, 1 is a letter indicating the <b>Type</b> <b>of</b> <b>modulation</b> used, 2 is a digit representing the Type of modulating signal, 3 is a letter corresponding to the Type of information transmitted, 4 is a letter indicating the practical details of the transmitted information, and 5 is a letter that represents the method of multiplexing.

2500|$|In radio communications, single-sideband {{modulation}} (SSB) or single-sideband suppressed-carrier modulation (SSB-SC) is a <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>modulation,</b> used {{to transmit}} information, an audio signal, by radio waves. [...] It is a refinement of amplitude modulation which uses transmitter power and bandwidth more efficiently. Amplitude modulation produces an output signal that has twice the bandwidth {{of the original}} baseband signal. Single-sideband modulation avoids this bandwidth doubling, and the power wasted on a carrier, {{at the cost of}} increased device complexity and more difficult tuning at the receiver.|$|E
