5|$|MGySgt Guadalupe Denogean is an {{immigrant}} from Mexico {{who has served}} in the Marine Corps for 25 years. Denogean was wounded in combat in Basra, Iraq. During {{the time that he}} received treatment for his wounds, he was asked if he had any requests. His answer was that he had two: First, he wanted a promotion for the corporal who helped rescue him, and second he wanted <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>American</b> citizen.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} Bond novels, such as Casino Royale, {{gambling}} is a theme, {{with not only}} golf {{as part of the}} novel, but opening with the canasta game as well. Raymond Benson identified times in the novel when Bond's investigation of Goldfinger was a gamble too and cites Bond tossing a coin to decide on his tactics in relation to his quarry. Once more (as with Live and Let Die and Dr. No) it is Bond the British agent who has to sort out what turns out <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>American</b> problem and this can be seen as Fleming's reaction to the lack of US support over the Suez Crisis in 1956 as well as Bond's warning to Goldfinger not to underestimate the English.|$|E
5|$|For {{three of}} the novels, Goldfinger, Live and Let Die and Dr. No, it is Bond the British agent who has to sort out what turns out <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>American</b> problem, and Black points out that {{although}} it is American assets that are under threat in Dr. No, a British agent and a British warship, HMS Narvik, are sent with British soldiers to the island {{at the end of}} the novel to settle the matter. Fleming became increasingly jaundiced about America, and his comments in the penultimate novel You Only Live Twice reflect this; Bond's responses to Tanaka's comments reflect the declining relationship between Britain and America—in sharp contrast to the warm, co-operative relationship between Bond and Leiter in the earlier books.|$|E

5|$|Lucan's {{disappearance}} has captivated the public's imagination for decades, {{with thousands}} of sightings reported across the world. One of the earliest, shortly after the murder, {{turned out to be}} a British ex-politician, John Stonehouse, who had attempted to fake his own death. The police travelled to France in June the following year to hunt another lead, to no avail. A sighting in Colombia turned out <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>American</b> businessman. John Miller, a bounty hunter who kidnapped the fugitive train robber Ronnie Biggs, claimed in 1982 to have captured the earl, but was later exposed by the News of the World as a hoaxer. In 2003 a former Scotland Yard detective thought he had tracked the earl to Goa, India; the man he traced was actually Barry Halpin, a folk singer from StHelens. In 2007, reporters in New Zealand interviewed a homeless British expatriate who neighbours claimed was the missing earl.|$|E

[...] Vedder said, [...] "It's easily the best stuff we've done but also some of the hardest stuff. It's very aggressive, because again, it's kind of a product of what it's like <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>American</b> these days. It's pretty aggressive, especially when you turn it loud." [...] Gossard added that after many experimental albums, Pearl Jam was [...] "like a coming together again in terms of accepting our natural strengths and also incorporating the best of our experiments".|$|E

"Eager {{to prove}} that he was above prejudice, Grant {{appointed}} more Jews to public office than had any of his predecessors and, in the name of human rights, he extended unprecedented support to persecuted Jews in Russia and Romania.

Through his appointments and policies, Grant rejected calls for a 'Christian nation' and embraced Jews as insiders in America, part of 'we the people.' During his administration, Jews achieved heightened status on the national scene, anti-Jewish prejudice declined, and Jews looked forward optimistically to a liberal epoch characterized by sensitivity to human rights and interreligious cooperation." ...|$|E

500|$|The Simpsons {{takes place}} in the fictional American town of Springfield in an unknown and impossible-to-determine U.S. state. The show is {{intentionally}} evasive in regard to Springfield's location. Springfield's geography, and that of its surroundings, contains coastlines, deserts, vast farmland, tall mountains, or whatever the story or joke requires. Groening has said that Springfield has much in common with Portland, Oregon, the city where he grew up. The name [...] "Springfield" [...] is a common one in America and appears in 22 states. Groening has said that he named it after Springfield, Oregon, and the fictitious Springfield which was the setting of the series Father Knows Best. He [...] "figured out that Springfield {{was one of the most}} common names for a city in the U.S. In anticipation of the success of the show, I thought, 'This will be cool; everyone will think it's their Springfield.' And they do." [...] An astronomer and fan of the show, Phil Plait, humorously noticed that The Simpsons could be set in Australia, because the moon in Springfield faces the wrong way <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>American</b> location.|$|E
500|$|... 4chan {{was started}} in 2003 in the bedroom of Christopher Poole, a then-15-year-old student from New York City whose 4chan handle is [...] "moot". Prior to {{starting}} 4chan, Poole had been a regular participant on the Something Awful forums. He intended 4chan <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>American</b> counterpart to the popular Japanese Futaba Channel ("2chan") imageboard {{and a place to}} discuss manga and anime. Upon the creation of 4chan, Poole encouraged users from the Something Awful subforum titled [...] "Anime Death Tentacle Rape Whorehouse", who also happened to be dissatisfied with the forum, to discuss anime on his website. Poole originally used the Futaba Channel to obtain anime-related images, and liked the concept of a message board where people anonymously shared images, which eventually led to his idea of creating a similar English-based website. During the creation of 4chan, he obtained the source code for the Futaba Channel website, and translated the Japanese text into English using Altavista's Babelfish online translator. During 4chan's earliest days, it had only two boards: [...] "/a/ – Anime/General" [...] and [...] "/b/ – Anime/Random" [...] (the very first board to be created); more boards were created over time, and /b/ was eventually renamed to simply [...] "/b/ – Random".|$|E
