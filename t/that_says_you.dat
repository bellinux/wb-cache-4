6000|$|Now, sirs, for {{the purpose}} of {{squaring}} things with this idea of [...] "don't care if slavery is voted up or voted down," [...] for sustaining the Dred Scott decision, for holding that the Declaration of Independence did not mean anything at all, we have Judge Douglas giving his exposition of what the Declaration of Independence means, and we have him saying that the people of America are equal to the people of England. According to his construction, you Germans are not connected with it. Now, I ask you in all soberness if all these things, if indulged in, if ratified, if confirmed and indorsed, if taught to our children, and repeated to them, do not tend to rub out the sentiment of liberty in the country, and to transform this government into a government of some other form. Those arguments that are made, that the inferior race are to be treated with as much allowance as they are capable of enjoying; that as much is to be done for them as their condition will allow,--what are these arguments? They are the arguments that kings have made for enslaving the people in all ages of the world. You will find that all the arguments in favor of kingcraft were of this class; they always bestrode the necks of the people not that they wanted to do it, but because the people were better off for being ridden. That is their argument, and this argument of the Judge is the same old serpent <b>that</b> <b>says,</b> <b>You</b> work, and I eat; you toil, and I will enjoy the fruits of it. Turn in whatever way you will, whether it come from the mouth of a king, an excuse for enslaving the people of his country, or from the mouth of men of one race as a reason for enslaving the men of another race, it is all the same old serpent; and I hold, if that course of argumentation that is made {{for the purpose}} of convincing the public mind that we should not care about this should be granted, it does not stop with the negro. I should like to know, if taking this old Declaration of Independence, which declares that all men are equal upon principle, and making exceptions to it, where will it stop? If one man says it does not mean a negro, why not another say it does not mean some other man? If that Declaration is not the truth, let us get the statute book, in which we find it, and tear it out! Who is so bold as to do it? If it is not true, let us tear it out! [Cries of [...] "No, no."] Let us stick to it, then; let us stand firmly by it, then.|$|E

How much money we made off OS/2, how much they did. How many K-LOCs did you do? And we kept trying to convince them - hey, if we have - a developer's got a good idea and he can get something done in 4K-LOCs instead of 20K-LOCs, should we make less money? Because he's made something smaller and faster, less K-LOC. K-LOCs, K-LOCs, that's the methodology. Ugh! Anyway, that always makes my back just crinkle up {{at the thought of}} the whole thing.|$|E

5000|$|Women activists {{protested the}} lack of female {{representation}} in Shas by organizing a [...] "No Female Candidate, No Female Vote" [...] campaign. The women {{said they would not}} vote for a party that does not include women candidates on its slate, and sent an open letter to the Knesset representatives of ultra-Orthodox parties, which was also circulated on social media. Rabbi Mordechai Blau, a senior party member, threatened that women participating in the movement or bucking the party leadership would find their children [...] "banned from Haredi schools", and their employers [...] "boycotted by the community". Shas announced that it would create a women's council within the movement, a step that was welcomed by the campaigners. At the same time, they said: [...] "We will move forward and call on the Haredi factions to enable women to serve as MKs in the Knesset." [...] Eli Yishai said on Israel Radio: [...] "There is nothing in Jewish law <b>that</b> <b>says</b> <b>you</b> can't have a woman as a Knesset member.

5000|$|A {{number of}} other English clubs had already {{negotiated}} naming rights for when they had redeveloped their grounds, including Bolton Wanderers (Reebok Stadium), Stoke City (Britannia Stadium) and Swansea City (Liberty Stadium). Commentators, however, expressed their surprise that Manchester City {{had been able to}} generate such a large sum to re-brand an existing ground which they themselves did not even own. Liverpool's managing director, Ian Ayre, said that although naming rights were common for new stadiums, there was no precedent for the lucrative re-branding of existing grounds: [...] "It hasn't happened in Europe that a football club has renamed an existing stadium and it's had real value. It was the City of Manchester Stadium or Eastlands for the last nine years and now it's going to be called something different and someone has attached a huge amount of value to that. I find that odd because it has never been done before. There is no benchmark <b>that</b> <b>says</b> <b>you</b> can rename your stadium and generate that amount of value. Mike Ashley tried it at Newcastle but nobody called it Sports Direct@St James' Park and it certainly didn't have that kind of value."
