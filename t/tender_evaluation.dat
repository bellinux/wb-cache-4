40|$|AbstractTender price {{evaluation}} of construction project {{is one of}} the most important works for the clients to control project cost in the bidding stage. However,the previously underutilization of project cost data made the <b>tender</b> price <b>evaluation</b> of new projects lack of effective evaluation criterion, which brings challenge to cost control. With the improvement of companies’ information technology application and the advent of big data era, the project cost-related data can be completely and systematically recorded in real time, as well as fully utilized to support decision-making for construction project cost management. In this paper, a system for <b>tender</b> price <b>evaluation</b> of construction project based on big data is presented, aiming to use related technique of big data to analysis project cost data to give a reasonable cost range, which contributes to obtaining the evaluation criterion to support the tender price controls. The paper introduced the data sources, data extraction, data storage and data analysis of the system respectively. A case study is conducted in a metro station project to evaluate the system. The results show that the system based on big data is significant for <b>tender</b> price <b>evaluation</b> in construction project...|$|R

40|$|If {{procurement}} {{processes are}} to be taken seriously, purchase managers need decision support tools beyond those that only ascertain that the formal requirements are met. This chapter demonstrates some fundamental flaws with common models used in procurement situations, flaws that are so serious that the <b>evaluations</b> of <b>tenders</b> often become meaningless and may lead to large and costly miscalculations. We demonstrate how the equitability of the <b>tender</b> <b>evaluations</b> can be significantly improved {{through the use of}} multi-criteria decision analysis with numerically imprecise input information. Due to this, the computational part of the evaluation step becomes more complex, and algorithms targeted for decision evaluation with imprecise data are used. We therefore present a procurement decision tool, DecideIT, implementing such algorithms that can be used as an instrument for a more meaningful procurement process. Of importance is to allow for a more realistic degree of precision in the valuation and ranking of <b>tenders</b> under each <b>evaluation</b> criterion, as well as the associated weighting of the criteria, since the criteria are often of a more qualitative nature. Through this, both quantitative and qualitative statements could be easily managed within the same framework and without the need to introduce ad-hoc and often arbitrary conversion formulas supposed to capture the trade-off between criteria...|$|R

40|$|The {{dissertation}} thesis {{deals with}} evaluation of non-investment public expenditure programs. The main {{aim of the}} thesis is to draw a set of relevant recommendations for proper construc-tion of public tender specifications, which are used to <b>tender</b> external <b>evaluations.</b> The author performed a research with the usage of empirical and statistical methods on a sample of <b>tender</b> documentations and <b>evaluation</b> reports, which were carried out for ESF operational programs 2004 [...] 6 and 2007 [...] 13 in the Czech Republic. Author also used {{a case study of}} an evaluation performed on Objective 3 Single Programming Document (Prague), co-financed by the ESF in the period 2004 [...] 6. In addition to the main objective stated above, the thesis includes data on real public <b>tender</b> documentations and <b>evaluation</b> reports. The output is represented by data on estimated prices of external <b>evaluation,</b> <b>tender</b> documentation contents and also on methods and techniques, which were used in the evaluations examined. Such set of empirical data has been scarcely found in recent studies, which adds to usability of this thesis for expert audience. External evaluation is an expert project financed with public resources, carried out through public procurement. Based on the model process of such evaluation, the author searches for preconditions of realizing an efficient external evaluation. Efficiency and its factors then become main subject of research. As a key factor of performing an efficient evaluation through public procurement, the author identifies the tender documentation and its qualities. This thesis contains a research performed on a sample of evaluations of five programs co-financed by the ESF in the Czech Republic. Examined tender documentations contained serious drawbacks, namely incomplete and inexact definitions of expected outputs, missing list of required methods for the evaluation and also missing scale of statistical samples for the research. Quantitative tests also did not prove any dependence of estimated price of the evaluation stated by the tenderers on pre-defined cost-effective factor. The thesis ends with summative conclusions of the drawbacks and, in accordance with research findings, brings a set of methodical recommendations for proper construction of public tender specifications of an evaluation, which may lead to increase in efficiency of <b>tendering</b> external <b>evaluations...</b>|$|R

40|$|A {{conceptual}} framework for studying customer satisfaction in Australian residential construction is developed using marketing theory merged with construction concepts. The framework aims {{to act as a}} stepping stone for determining how empirical data from real residential construction situations and real customers, fits marketing theory. To this end, customer satisfaction is modelled as a gap between two constructs: pre-purchase expectations and purchase perceptions. A parallel marketing concept known as the purchase decision process is used to model identifiable inputs to the two constructs, thus creating the ability to model different customer profiles. The purchase decision process is adapted to suit residential construction and can be described as: housing needs recognition, search for <b>tenders,</b> <b>evaluation</b> of competing contractors, signing of contracts, progressive construction outcomes and practical completion outcomes. The first four contribute to pre-purchase expectations and the remainder to perceptions of what is actually provided. Service quality, product quality and price are modelled as features that manifest consistently during the purchase decision process and therefore in pre-purchase expectations and purchase perceptions, as well. Future research aims to develop a grounded model of customer satisfaction in residential construction. Customer satisfaction, residential construction, house building,...|$|R

The investigation provides further insight into the evaluation of contractors' attributes (i. e. PSC). Levels of importance assigned (LIA) for each criterion were analysed (i. e. quantitative analysis of the differences in opinions and, variance amongst the respondents) in a multivariate statistical method. Importance attached by construction clients to the ‘lowest-price wins’ philosophy is also presented. Contrast was made between the MCS approach and the ‘lowest-price wins’ option amongst the surveyed construction clients. It was found that increased awareness of the use of PSC prevailed amongst the survey construction clients. This indicated that cost has to be tempered with the evaluation of PSC and the attempt of construction clients searching for a new evaluation paradigm (i. e. adoption of MCS approach rather than basing on the lowest-price wins alone) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{study was}} {{triggered}} {{by the fact that}} the government has made number of efforts in addressing weaknesses in the public procurement process. However there still complaints that public procurement processes are characterized by delays, poor quality and non cost effective delivery. This study sought to analyze procurement processes in achieving effectiveness of the public procurement system. The study focused on procuring entities based in Dar es Salaam due to budget constraints and existence of major procuring entities in terms of procurement volume. Explanatory research design was used to analyse the procurement proceses. The study used structured questionnaires and interviews as primary tools for data collection. A total of 119 respondents out of the expected 155 respondents returned the survey instruments. The study revealed that procuring entities do not conduct market survey for establishing cost estimates, inadequate users cooperation with PMU staff and poor solicitation documents due to inadequate technical specifications, schedule of requirements, and drawings and poor terms and conditions of contract. The weak evaluation critieria and inadequate <b>tender</b> <b>evaluations,</b> and delays in contract awards are hampering efficient procurement process which results to ineffective procurement system. Furthermore weak controls in procurement contracts for payments to delivery of substandard goods or services and delays of due payments to suppliers or contractors and generally poor contract management were noted.

Thus, the research has developed a more realistic working model including the necessary capabilities mentioned. The vital theory behind the model was a combination of a utility function and a social welfare function. The model was divided into two main steps (step 1 : evaluating contractor ability and step 2 : evaluating tenders) consisting of three main processes: (1) the contractor ability criteria selection process; (2) the contractor ability criteria balancing/measuring process; and (3) bid price and contractor ability balancing/measuring process. The model incorporated computer interaction in which Microsoft Excel performed calculation tasks while Visual Basic for Application (VBA) was coded for user interaction.
