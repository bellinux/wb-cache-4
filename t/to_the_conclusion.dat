5|$|A copy of The Times {{informed}} von Reuter {{that the}} Armistice was to expire {{at noon on}} 21 June 1919, the deadline by which Germany was to have signed the peace treaty. Von Reuter came <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>conclusion</b> that the British intended to seize the German ships after the Armistice expired. Unaware that the deadline had been extended to the 23rd, Reuter ordered the ships to be sunk. On the morning of 21 June, the British fleet left Scapa Flow to conduct training maneuvers, and at 11:20 Reuter transmitted the order to his ships. Kaiser sank at 13:24; the ship was raised in 1929 and broken up for scrap in Rosyth starting in 1930.|$|E

The Spannocchi bank, which housed much of Borja's wealth, {{was said to have}} nearly crashed after the conclave due to the velocity of transactions.|$|E
5|$|An ineffectual start led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>conclusion</b> that deeper {{structural}} changes were necessary and in June 1987 Gorbachev announced an agenda {{of economic reform}} called perestroika, or restructuring. Perestroika relaxed the production quota system, allowed private ownership of businesses and {{paved the way for}} foreign investment. These measures were intended to redirect the country's resources from costly Cold War military commitments to more productive areas in the civilian sector.|$|E
5|$|As {{the episode}} opens, Mossad Officer Amir Mantel (Dove Meir) is shot dead at point blank range in an American parking garage. At NCIS headquarters, Ziva cancels plans to pursue Eli David's killer, Ilan Bodnar (Oded Fehr), in Rome, having come <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>conclusion</b> {{that he will}} {{relocate}} to Berlin shortly. Before she and Tony depart, the new Mossad director, Orli Elbaz (Marina Sirtis), arrives in hopes of collaborating with the agency {{in the search for}} Bodnar.

5|$|Before mendelevium's discovery, Seaborg and Katz {{predicted}} {{that it should}} be predominantly trivalent in aqueous solution and hence should behave similarly to other tripositive lanthanides and actinides. After the synthesis of mendelevium in 1955, these predictions were confirmed, first in the observation at its discovery that it eluted just after fermium in the trivalent actinide elution sequence from a cation-exchange column of resin, and later the 1967 observation that mendelevium could form insoluble hydroxides and fluorides that coprecipitated with trivalent lanthanide salts. Cation-exchange and solvent extraction studies led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>conclusion</b> that mendelevium was a trivalent actinide with an ionic radius somewhat smaller than that of the previous actinide, fermium. Mendelevium can form coordination complexes with 1,2-cyclohexanedinitrilotetraacetic acid (DCTA).|$|E
5|$|Conquest in Africa and the East {{provided}} both {{wonder and}} terror to European intellectuals, as it led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>conclusion</b> that Eden {{could never have}} been an actual geographical location. The Garden references exotic travel literature of the 15th century through the animals, including lions and a giraffe, in the left panel. The giraffe has been traced to Cyriac of Ancona, a travel writer known for his visits to Egypt during the 1440s. The exoticism of Cyriac's sumptuous manuscripts may have inspired Bosch's imagination.|$|E
5|$|Contador {{first took}} the race lead {{after the second}} {{mountain}} stage, to Marmolada, by finishing nearly fifteen minutes ahead of previous race leader Gabriele Bosisio. The race's overall classification had been headed for several days beforehand by Giovanni Visconti, who participated in a breakaway in the sixth stage which won him sufficient time to hold the race leader's pink jersey {{for more than a}} week. In the race's final week, Contador faced stern challenges from Riccò and defending Giro champion Danilo Di Luca. Though Contador did not win any stage, his performances were consistently strong enough to remain ahead through <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>conclusion</b> of the race.|$|E

5|$|Dominican missionaries {{were active}} in Verapaz and the {{southern}} Petén from the late 16th century through the 17th century, attempting non-violent conversion with limited success. In the 17th century, the Franciscans came <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>conclusion</b> that the pacification and Christian conversion of the Maya {{would not be possible}} as long as the Itza held out at Lake Petén Itzá. The constant flow of escapees fleeing the Spanish-held territories to find refuge with the Itza was a drain on the workforce managed by the encomienda system.|$|E
5|$|Hastings {{eventually}} switched {{sides and}} joined the Labour Party. His conversion, especially {{in the light of}} later events, was regarded by some as suspect: his entry in the Dictionary of Labour Biography reports speculation that Hastings foresaw that Labour may come to Government and had few senior lawyers to fill the Law Officer posts. John Paton, after speaking from the same Independent Labour Party (ILP) platform as Hastings, came <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>conclusion</b> that Hastings gave political speeches using his skill as a lawyer to master a brief; on the train home, Hastings appeared not to have heard of the ILP.|$|E
5|$|However, further {{investigations}} have led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>conclusion</b> that the arsenic {{content in the}} groundwater {{did not differ from}} that of the local drinking supply, and that the illness reported was likely caused by the vaporization of troilite, a sulfur-bearing compound present within the meteorite in large amounts, which would have melted at relatively low temperatures and high pressures created by such an impact.|$|E

While the Mountaineers assembled a 10–2 overall record and a 7–2 run in conference play during the regular season, the two losses came against the only ranked opponents that WVU faced. The season culminated in a loss to Miami in the 2016 Russell Athletic Bowl. Prior <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>conclusion</b> of the regular season, Holgorsen and WVU agreed to a five-year contract extension.|$|E
5|$|Mary's biographers, such as Antonia Fraser, Alison Weir, and John Guy, {{have come}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>conclusion</b> {{that either the}} {{documents}} were complete forgeries, or incriminating passages were inserted into genuine letters, or that the letters were written to Bothwell by some other person or by Mary to some other person. Guy {{points out that the}} letters are disjointed, and that the French language and grammar employed in the sonnets are too poor for a writer with Mary's education. However, certain phrases of the letters (including verses in the style of Ronsard) and certain characteristics of style would be compatible with known writings of Mary.|$|E
5|$|Orr {{signed with}} Chicago, but his {{injuries}} limited him to only 26 games {{over the next}} three seasons. He sat out the entire 1977–78 season. By 1978, Orr had undergone over a dozen knee surgeries, was having trouble walking and barely skated anymore. However, in the summer of 1978, he decided to make a comeback. He played six games of the 1978–79 season and came <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>conclusion</b> that he could no longer play and informed the Black Hawks that he was retiring. He started a new role as an assistant to Chicago general manager Bob Pulford. He scored his last NHL goal and point against Detroit on October 28, 1978, at Detroit's Olympia Stadium.|$|E

Tammi tries to talk Randall out of it but Randall shoots through the wall next to her and kills Dwight. Randall is {{eventually}} arrested, but Tammi successfully manages to run away.|$|E
5|$|The BBRC {{conducted}} a detailed review into the controversial {{identification of a}} curlew seen at Druridge Bay in Northumberland in 1998, coming <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>conclusion</b> that it was, as had been believed by many observers, a first-summer slender-billed curlew.
