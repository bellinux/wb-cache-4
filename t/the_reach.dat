5|$|Biotechnology in {{the modern}} sense of genetic {{engineering}} began in the 1970s, with the invention of recombinant DNA techniques.

Beginning with the lab of Paul Berg in 1972 (aided by EcoRI from Herbert Boyer's lab, building on work with ligase by Arthur Kornberg's lab), molecular biologists put these pieces together to produce the first transgenic organisms. Soon after, others began using plasmid vectors and adding genes for antibiotic resistance, greatly increasing <b>the</b> <b>reach</b> of the recombinant techniques.|$|E
