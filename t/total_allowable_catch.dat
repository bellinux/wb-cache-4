5|$|The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has {{listed the}} black dogfish under Least Concern worldwide; it is {{minimally}} affected by fishing activity across {{many parts of}} its range, while its population in the northwestern Atlantic presently seems to be stable and may have increased from 1978 to 1995. By contrast, the intensity of deepwater fisheries in the northeastern Atlantic has led the IUCN to give this species a regional assessment of Near Threatened.

25|$|The Law on Fisheries {{requires}} that <b>total</b> <b>allowable</b> <b>catch</b> (TAC) levels are set for fishery stocks.

However, the Law on Fisheries {{then goes on}} to state that industrial fisheries are not necessarily required to base their catch on TAC. The Law does not explain this further, but calls {{for the federal government to}} issue a special TAC setting statute. Pacific salmon is the main stock that will probably not have TAC, but will have regulated fishing effort instead.|$|E
25|$|The North Sea cod {{stock is}} {{primarily}} fished by European Union member states and Norway. In 1999 the catch was divided among Denmark (31%), Scotland (25%), {{the rest of}} the United Kingdom (12%), the Netherlands (10%), Belgium, Germany and Norway (17%). In the 1970s, the annual catch rose to between 200,000 - 300,000 tons. Due to concerns about overfishing, catch quotas were repeatedly reduced in the 1980s and 1990s. In 2003, ICES stated that there is a high risk of stock collapse if current exploitation levels continue, and recommended a moratorium on catching Atlantic cod in the North Sea during 2004. However, agriculture and fisheries ministers from the Council of the European Union endorsed the EU/Norway Agreement and set the <b>total</b> <b>allowable</b> <b>catch</b> (TAC) 27,300 tons.|$|E

40|$|Fishery {{management}} {{is a complicated}} task that often results in overfishing, overcapacity, and low profits for the industry. The management of shared fish stocks is particularly problematic, especially if national authorities pursue different objectives. Multi-species fisheries add further complexity to the problem. It {{is no accident that}} management tools frequently used in Northern Europe, such as <b>total</b> <b>allowable</b> <b>catches</b> and individual quotas, are not applied in the Mediterranean Sea, where more target species are caught simultaneously. However, the European Commission intends to introduce a market-based driver for a strong, profitable fishing industry by phasing in transferable fishing concessions. This management approach is new for the Mediterranean, and it requires in-depth examination at institutional, legal, and economic levels. In this paper, after a review of the institutional setting, the economic perspective was analyzed by estimating the production function for the Italian small pelagic fishery in the Adriatic Sea. With the addition of Croatia to the European Union, the Adriatic Sea can become a Mediterranean communal exclusive fishing area. The results indicate that output measures such as <b>total</b> <b>allowable</b> <b>catches</b> and individual quotas should not cause serious discarding problems for this multi-species fishery...|$|R
2500|$|Individual {{transferable}} quotas (ITQs) are fishery rationalization instruments defined {{under the}} Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act as limited access permits to harvest quantities of fish. Fisheries scientists decide the optimal amount of fish (<b>total</b> <b>allowable</b> <b>catch)</b> {{to be harvested}} in a certain fishery. The decision considers carrying capacity, regeneration rates and future values. Under ITQs, members of a fishery are granted rights to {{a percentage of the}} <b>total</b> <b>allowable</b> <b>catch</b> that can be harvested each year. [...] These quotas can be fished, bought, sold, or leased allowing for the least cost vessels to be used. ITQs are used in New Zealand, Australia, Iceland, Canada, and the United States.

2500|$|The CFP sets quotas for {{how much}} of each species can be caught in a certain [...] or groups of areas on a yearly or two-yearly basis. Each country is given a quota based upon the total {{available}} (<b>Total</b> <b>Allowable</b> <b>Catch,</b> TAC) and their traditional share (percentage). TACs are fixed annually by the Council of Ministers. They consider proposals drawn up by the European Commission, which consults its own scientific advisers (Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee of Fisheries, STECF). STECF generally provides its advice to the European Commission taking account of the work conducted by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES). The Council of Ministers furthermore (when relevant) takes account of the views of non-EU fishing nations and the advice coming directly from ICES, which is independent of EU institutions. After quotas are fixed by the Council of Ministers, each EU member state is responsible for policing its own quota. Countries distribute their quotas among fishermen using different systems.|$|E
2500|$|Black abalone have {{dramatically}} declined in numbers throughout their historical range, and are locally extirpated in certain areas. [...] This decline was initiated by overfishing. [...] Following World War II, the California abalone fishery was not managed for individual species. [...] Therefore, {{it resulted in}} a systematic depletion of various abalone species as the fishery over-harvested one species and {{then moved on to}} the next in an attempt to meet demand. [...] Black abalone were the last to be targeted, with the peak harvest occurring in the 1970s. Additionally, improved harvesting technologies that expanded the harvesting areas and supported larger harvests per unit effort were not initiated. Now, all abalone fisheries in California are managed by the California Department of Fish and Game, which restricts the size of abalones caught, and the season in which harvesting can take place. In Mexico, there is a <b>total</b> <b>allowable</b> <b>catch</b> limit for black abalones. Even though harvesting black abalone is [...] regulated in California, poaching still occurs. Other threats include coastal development for residential areas, harbours and waste discharges, compounded by commercial and recreational fishing of the black abalone.|$|E

Proceedings of the Eighteenth Biennial Conference of the International Institute of Fisheries Economics and Trade, held July 11 - 15, 2016 at Aberdeen Exhibition and Conference Center (AECC), Aberdeen, Scotland, UK. The {{success of}} fishery {{management}} ultimately {{depends on the}} approach of implementation. Past fishery management has relied largely on technical regulations. Examples for such command-and-control measures include detailed gear prescriptions, restrictions on the days-at-sea spent fishing and vessel capacity, and minimum landing sizes. Resource economists have argued in favor of incentive-based approaches, such as individual transferable quota (ITQ) systems and harvesting fees. For a fishery with multiple ecological and economic interactions, neither of the two approaches can assure a first-best solution in general. A central question thus is, {{which of the two}} approaches is more effective and efficient with respect to the objectives of ecosystem-based management. Here, we focus on intra-specific ecological and technical interactions which arise within an age-structured fishery. We use an age-structured ecological-economic optimization model of the Eastern Baltic cod fishery to quantify and analyze the effects of gear regulations and <b>total</b> <b>allowable</b> <b>catches,</b> as they have been applied since the mid 1980 s, as well as alternative, incentive-based systems, i. e. tradable quotas. We find that gear restrictions have not been effective and that the gradual increase of mesh sizes may even have been detrimental, as <b>total</b> <b>allowable</b> <b>catches</b> have been set as ineffectively high levels. Setting <b>total</b> <b>allowable</b> <b>catches</b> at sufficiently restrictive levels could have achieved an efficient outcome. Tradable quotas in terms of numbers of fish would achieve a similarly effective outcome in ecological terms, and would be economically preferable, because no technical restrictions are needed.
