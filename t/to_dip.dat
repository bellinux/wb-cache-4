5|$|Clinton said Republican {{amendments}} would {{strip the}} U.S. Treasury {{of its ability}} <b>to</b> <b>dip</b> into federal trust funds to avoid a borrowing crisis. Republican amendments would have limited appeals by death-row inmates, made it harder to issue health, safety and environmental regulations, and would have committed the president to a seven-year balanced budget. Clinton vetoed a second bill allowing the government to keep operating beyond the time when most spending authority expires.|$|E
5|$|In Judaism, it is {{recommended}} to have either a salty bread or to add salt to the bread if this bread is unsalted when doing Kiddush for Shabbat. It is customary to spread some salt over the bread or <b>to</b> <b>dip</b> the bread in a little salt when passing the bread around the table after the Kiddush. To preserve the covenant between their people and God, Jews dip the Sabbath bread in salt.|$|E
5|$|Born {{and raised}} in Acton, west London, Friday was scouted, but not retained, by four {{professional}} clubs during his teenage years. He appeared for local semi-professional sides in the Isthmian League until he joined Charlie Hurley's Fourth Division Reading team in 1974—quickly becoming a key player, he helped Reading to win promotion to the Third Division during the 1975–76 season. As his drug habit intensified, Friday's form began <b>to</b> <b>dip</b> {{in the first half}} of the 1976–77 season, leading Reading to sell him to Second Division side Cardiff City around the New Year. Friday travelled to join his new team by train without a valid ticket and had to be bailed by the Cardiff manager Jimmy Andrews before he signed for the club. He performed strongly on his debut, but afterwards his form declined and his personal life caused him to repeatedly miss matches altogether. Following a number of incidents, on and off the field—including kicking Mark Lawrenson in the face —Friday retired from football in December 1977, aged 25. He died in Acton in 1990, aged 38, after suffering a heart attack.|$|E

5|$|Gay {{holds the}} US {{record in the}} 100m with 9.69s, making him the joint second fastest sprinter, along with Yohan Blake, {{in the history of}} the event after Usain Bolt. His 19.58s makes him history's sixth fastest 200m runner and the USA's fourth fastest. In 2010 Gay was a member of the fifth-fastest 4 x 100m relay team in history, running a 37.45s with {{teammates}} Trell Kimmons, Wallace Spearmon and Michael Rodgers in Weltklasse Zürich 2010. His sprint combination of 100m and 200m in 9.84s and 19.62s, run over two days in 2007, was the best ever combo at that time. During the Tom Jones Memorial Classic in Gainesville on April 17, 2010 Tyson Gay clocked 44.89 in the 400m event and became the first man in history <b>to</b> <b>dip</b> under 10.00 in the 100m, under 20.00 in the 200m and under 45.00 in the 400m.|$|E

His crew {{included}} his long-time {{radio operator}} Walter Kubisch, {{the member of}} a Propagandakompanie (Wehrmacht Propaganda Troops) in the aerial gunner position, and a second radio operator. Lent {{was on his way}} to visit the Geschwaderkommodore of the Nachtjagdgeschwader 1, Hans-Joachim Jabs. During the landing approach, the left engine of the plane failed, causing the wing <b>to</b> <b>dip.</b> Lent was unable to keep the plane steady and it struck high-voltage cables and crashed. All four members of the crew sustained serious injuries but were rescued alive. Three crew members succumbed to their injuries by the next morning and Lent himself died two days later on 7 October 1944.|$|E
5|$|Returning to Danes Island in {{the summer}} of 1897, the {{expedition}} found that the balloon hangar built the year before had weathered the winter storms well. The winds were more favorable, too. Andrée had strengthened his leadership by replacing the older and critical Ekholm, an authority in his field, with the 27-year-old enthusiast Knut Frænkel. On July 11, in a steady wind from the south-west, the top of the plank hangar was dismantled, the three explorers climbed into the already heavy basket, and Andrée dictated one last-minute telegram to King Oscar and another to the paper Aftonbladet, holder of press rights to the expedition. The large support team cut away the last ropes holding the balloon and it rose slowly. Moving out low over the water, it was pulled so far down by the friction of the several-hundred-meter-long drag ropes against the ground as <b>to</b> <b>dip</b> the basket into the water. The friction also twisted the ropes round, detaching them from their screw holds. These holds were a new safety feature that Andrée had reluctantly been persuaded to add, whereby ropes that got caught on the ground could be more easily dropped.|$|E

5|$|Some of {{the snakes}} attack Rick, and while fending them off he accidentally {{releases}} the oxygen masks throughout the plane, causing several snakes to {{drop into the}} cabin with them. Numerous passengers, including Agent Sanders, are killed when the snakes invade the cabin. The surviving passengers, who have {{made their way to}} the front of the plane, put up blockades of luggage in a desperate attempt to stop the snakes. Rick is attacked and the plane starts <b>to</b> <b>dip</b> downwards, causing a food trolley to crash through the luggage blockade. The passengers flee to the upstairs first class cabin before blocking the stairwell with an inflatable liferaft. Agent Flynn and Flight Attendant Claire regain control of the plane. Rick retakes the controls and has Flynn go into the cargo hold to restore the air conditioning/ventilation system. Agent Flynn contacts FBI Special Agent Hank Harris on the ground, who gets in touch with ophiologist Dr. Steven Price, Customs' main source for animal smuggling cases. Based on pictures of the reptiles emailed to him via a passenger's mobile phone, Price believes a Los Angeles snake dealer known for illegally importing exotic and highly dangerous snakes to be responsible. After a shootout, the dealer is bitten by one of his snakes and Harris withholds the antivenom if he does not give them details. The dealer finally reveals that Kim hired him to obtain the snakes and adds how the latter managed to smuggle them on board the plane. Price injects antivenom to the injured dealer and he commandeers the dealer's supply of antivenom for the plane's victims based on the list given to him, while Harris gives orders to have Eddie Kim arrested on multiple counts of murder and attempted murder.|$|E

25|$|The mosque {{was built}} in {{traditional}} Javanese architecture. It consists {{of a pair of}} buildings: the main prayer hall and a front hall commonly called serambi. The prayer hall is a building of thick plain walls, while the serambi is a porch-like semi-attached building. Surrounding the porch is a moat to enable one <b>to</b> <b>dip</b> his or her feet before reaching the serambi, symbolically purifying anything that enters the mosque.|$|E
25|$|Defending {{indirect}} free-kicks provides different {{difficulties for}} the defending team. The wall {{must be prepared}} to charge down the ball once it has been touched by the free-kick taker, and other defenders must be alert to the attacking team's practised set-plays. Getting the ball over the wall and then <b>to</b> <b>dip</b> into the bottom corner is a superb skill. Xherdan Shaqiri approaches the ball from a 90 degrees angle which is very effective.|$|E

After numerous years of success, ratings for Live 105 began <b>to</b> <b>dip</b> during the late 1990s, as Infinity Broadcasting's KOME in San Jose switched to a harder modern rock sound. KOME had great success in the ratings and managed to even beat Live 105 with the Howard Stern morning show and its guitar-driven music format, as opposed to the more British, euro-based music Live 105 had carved a niche with.|$|E
25|$|Another legend {{claims that}} {{following}} the Navigation Acts (a 1651 ordinance by Oliver Cromwell requiring all foreign fleets in the North Sea or the Channel <b>to</b> <b>dip</b> their flag in salute) the Wilhelmus was sung (or rather, shouted) by the sailors on the Dutch flagship Brederode {{in response to}} the first warning shot fired by an English fleet under Robert Blake, when their captain Maarten Tromp refused to lower his flag. At the end of the song, which coincided with the third (i.e. last) English warning shot, Tromp fired a full broadside thereby beginning the Battle of Goodwin Sands and the First Anglo-Dutch War.|$|E

They could not press the advantage however, and Oracle led well around the top mark. Team New Zealand once again closed right up to the American boat about halfway down the fourth leg, but could not make the pass. Oracle closed out the win by 23 seconds to bring the score to 4–8.|$|E
30|$|From Eq. (3), the {{magnitude}} of the P 2 force is linearly proportional <b>to</b> the <b>dip</b> angle regardless of the dip length. Figure  7 b and c shows the dynamic wheel forces (P 2 forces are from their low-pass filtering) and axle box accelerations. It can be seen that their magnitudes are related <b>to</b> the <b>dip</b> angles regardless of the dip length, but their frequencies are not related <b>to</b> either <b>dip</b> angles or dip lengths. Therefore, the relationship between the accelerations on a locomotive component and the dip angles of dipped rail defects is important for monitoring the development of those defects.|$|R

25|$|Before the {{highways}} were upgraded {{to the extent}} that they permitted trans-Canada commercial shipping by road within Canada, and did not require trucking companies <b>to</b> <b>dip</b> below the 49th parallel to traverse the Great Lakes, and prior to the emergence of the airlines as a preferred mode of passenger travel and freight carriage, the railways were, as Sir John A. Macdonald’s National Policy had envisaged, at first the sole and for long the principal conduit linking Canada together. In Regina the warehouses were commercial depots for the receipt of goods from eastern Canada and the USA. With the eclipse of the railroads by {{the highways}} the Warehouse District lost its original raison d’être and for a time the warehouses seemed in danger of becoming white elephants.|$|E
25|$|Marcellus gas {{production}} has lowered {{the price of}} natural gas in the Mid-Atlantic states of the US, which previously were almost entirely dependent on gas pipelined in from the US Gulf Coast. From 2005 through 2008, wholesale gas prices at Mid-Atlantic states were $0.23 to $0.33 per million BTU above prices of the main Gulf Coast trading point, the Henry Hub. The US Energy Information Administration reported in 2012 that Marcellus production had lowered regional gas prices to nearly par with Henry Hub, and projected that by 2015, Marcellus gas would drive gas prices in its area down to $0.10 below Henry Hub. In October 2013, the US EIA reported that futures markets were predicting Appalachian gas prices <b>to</b> <b>dip</b> to $0.30 below Henry Hub in 2016.|$|E
25|$|Soon {{after it}} was {{discovered}} and recognized as the principle of meat smoking, wood-tar creosote became used {{as a replacement for}} the process. Several methods were used to apply the creosote. One was <b>to</b> <b>dip</b> the meat in pyroligneous acid or a water of diluted creosote, as Reichenbach did, or brush it over with them, and within one hour the meat would have the same quality of that of traditionally smoked preparations. Sometimes the creosote was diluted in vinegar rather than water, as vinegar was also used as a preservative. Another was to place the meat in a closed box, and place with it a few drops of creosote in a small bottle. Because of the volatility of the creosote, the atmosphere was filled with a vapour containing it, and it would cover the flesh.|$|E
