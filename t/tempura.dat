5|$|Japanese <b>tempura</b> is {{a popular}} deep-fried food that {{generally}} consists of battered and fried seafood and vegetables. Japanese deep-fried dishes, or Agemono, include other styles besides <b>tempura,</b> such as Karaage, Korokke, Kushikatsu, and Tonkatsu. In areas of south-east Asia such as Thailand, insects are commonly deep-fried for human consumption. Western-style fast food items such as donuts, deep-fried chicken, and deep-fried potatoes are also becoming popular in Asia.|$|E
5|$|The Nobu Restaurant {{features}} an Asian motif and is spaciously arranged with only round tables, granting larger aisles than square tables would. Large paper lamps in jellyfish images {{hang from the}} ceiling. Seating {{is available in the}} main dining area, the sushi bar, along a couple of high kitchen tables, or in a private dining area. There are also two teppanyaki grill tables, which serve as either a traditional grill or in combination with the menu and dishes from the main kitchen. In addition to chef Nobu Matsuhisa's signature dishes featuring black cod in miso sauce, rock shrimp <b>tempura,</b> and yellowtail sashimi the menu has variations on the dishes which are not available at other Nobu restaurants, as well as an exclusive list of sakes available nowhere else in the U.S.|$|E
50|$|However, this {{popularity}} was strengthened {{with the}} opening of the first restaurant with option buffet free (caster). At reasonable prices, Brazilians today can experience sushi, sashimi, <b>tempuras,</b> shimeji and other Japanese dishes. The first restaurant opened with this system was in the early 90s, in Ipanema, Rio de Janeiro, named Mariko. In 1997, it was the turn of São Paulo, in the Itaim Bibi area in the Aoyama. In Japan there is no service carvery; the closest to this model is the takehodai (fixed price).|$|R
50|$|Fourteen of {{the smaller}} {{locations}} only offer the Filipino Buffet which may include crispy pata, kare kare, bringhe, bulalo soup, ginataang kuhol, tapang kalabaw, and longganisang kapampangan. The three largest locations offer the Filipino-Asian Buffet which includes everything on the Filipino Buffet plus additional foods from other asian cusines, such as sushi, vegetable <b>tempuras,</b> siomai, Thai catfish flakes with green mango salad or Yam Pla Duk Fu. The overseas location may offer a slightly modified menu to cater to American tastes and to cope with shortages of ingredients not readily available in America.|$|R

5|$|In India, {{squashes}} (ghia) {{are cooked}} with seafood such as prawns. In France, marrows (courge) are traditionally {{served as a}} gratin, sieved and cooked with butter, milk, and egg, and flavored with salt, pepper, and nutmeg, and as soups. In Italy, zucchini and larger squashes are served {{in a variety of}} regional dishes, such as cocuzze alla puviredda cooked with olive oil, salt and herbs from Puglia; as torta di zucca from Liguria, or torta di zucca e riso from Emilia-Romagna, the squashes being made into a pie filling with butter, ricotta, parmesan, egg, and milk; and as a sauce for pasta in dishes like spaghetti alle zucchine from Sicily. In Japan, squashes such as small C. moschata pumpkins (kabocha) are eaten boiled with sesame sauce, fried as a <b>tempura</b> dish, or made into balls with sweet potato and Japanese mountain yam.|$|E
25|$|<b>Tempura</b> is {{also used}} in {{combination}} with other foods. When served over soba (buckwheat noodles), it is called <b>tempura</b> soba or tensoba. <b>Tempura</b> is also served as a donburi dish where <b>tempura</b> shrimp and vegetables are served over steamed rice in a bowl (tendon) and on top of udon soup (<b>tempura</b> udon).|$|E
25|$|Outside Japan (as well as {{recently}} in Japan), {{there are many}} nontraditional and fusion uses of <b>tempura.</b> Chefs over the world include <b>tempura</b> dishes on their menus, and {{a wide variety of}} different batters and ingredients are used, including the nontraditional broccoli, zucchini, asparagus and chuchu. More unusual ingredients may include nori slices, dry fruit such as banana, and ice cream (tempura-based fried ice cream). American restaurants are known to serve <b>tempura</b> in the form of various meats, particularly chicken, and cheeses, usually mozzarella. A variation is to use panko (breadcrumbs), which results in a crisper consistency than <b>tempura</b> batter. Using panko in Japan would no longer qualify the dish as <b>tempura.</b> It would become something else called fry or pronounced in Japanese as furai. <b>Tempura</b> (particularly shrimp) is often used as a filling in makizushi. A more recent variation of <b>tempura</b> sushi has entire pieces of sushi being dipped in batter and tempura-fried.|$|E

25|$|Firm {{and fresh}} {{blossoms}} {{that are only}} slightly open are cooked to be eaten, with pistils removed from female flowers, and stamens removed from male flowers. The stems on the flowers can be retained {{as a way of}} giving the cook something to hold onto during cooking, rather than injuring the delicate petals, or they can be removed prior to cooking, or prior to serving. There are a variety of recipes in which the flowers may be deep fried as fritters or <b>tempura</b> (after dipping in a light <b>tempura</b> batter), stuffed, sautéed, baked, or used in soups.|$|E
25|$|<b>Tempura</b> {{generally}} {{does not}} use breadcrumbs (panko) in the coating. Generally, fried foods which are coated with breadcrumbs {{are considered to be}} furai, Japanese-invented Western-style deep fried foods, such as tonkatsu or ebi furai (fried prawn).|$|E
25|$|A light batter {{is made of}} {{cold water}} (sometimes {{sparkling}} water is used to keep the batter light) and soft wheat flour (cake, pastry or all-purpose flour). Eggs, baking soda or baking powder, starch, oil, and/or spices may also be added. <b>Tempura</b> batter is traditionally mixed in small batches using chopsticks {{for only a few}} seconds, leaving lumps in the mixture that, along with the cold batter temperature, result in the unique fluffy and crisp <b>tempura</b> structure when cooked. The batter is often kept cold by adding ice, or by placing the bowl inside a larger bowl with ice in it. Overmixing the batter will result in activation of wheat gluten, which causes the flour mixture to become soft and dough-like when fried.|$|E
25|$|Japan and Taiwan {{have shared}} a close {{historical}} and cultural relations. Taiwan has adapted many Japanese food items. Tianbula(Oden), a Taiwanese version of <b>tempura,</b> only barely resembles the original, being more a variant of oden. Taiwanese versions of oden are known locally as olen.|$|E
25|$|The bits of batter (known as tenkasu) are scooped {{out between}} batches of <b>tempura,</b> {{so they do}} not burn and leave a bad flavor in the oil. A small mesh scoop (Ami jakushi) is used for this purpose. Tenkasu are often {{reserved}} as ingredients in other dishes or as a topping.|$|E

25|$|Oil {{temperature}} is generally kept between 160 and 180 degrees Celsius (320–356 F), {{depending on the}} ingredient. To preserve the natural flavor and texture of the ingredients, care is taken not to overcook <b>tempura.</b> Cooking times range between a few seconds for delicate leaf vegetables, to several minutes for thick items or large kaki-age fritters.|$|E
25|$|Thin slices or {{strips of}} {{vegetables}} or seafood are dipped in the batter, then briefly deep-fried in hot oil.

25|$|The Japanese brought bento and sashimi, and, {{although}} many of their vegetable seeds would not grow in the climate of the islands, they succeeded in making tofu and soy sauce. The homes of Japanese immigrants lacked ovens, so their cooking relied on frying, steaming, broiling, and simmering, leading to the popularization of <b>tempura</b> and noodle soups in Hawaii. By the early 20th century, the Japanese were the largest ethnic group and rice became the third largest crop in the islands.|$|E
25|$|In Asia, {{sesame seeds}} are {{sprinkled}} onto some sushi-style foods. In Japan, whole seeds {{are found in}} many salads and baked snacks, and tan and black sesame seed varieties are roasted and {{used to make the}} flavouring gomashio. East Asian cuisines, like Chinese cuisine, use sesame seeds and oil in some dishes, such as dim sum, sesame seed balls; Cantonese: jin deui), and the Vietnamese bánh rán. Sesame flavour (through oil and roasted or raw seeds) is also very popular in Korean cuisine, used to marinate meat and vegetables. Chefs in <b>tempura</b> restaurants blend sesame and cottonseed oil for deep-frying.|$|E
25|$|The High Courts {{are split}} into chambers, each {{consisting}} of three High Court judges (landsdommere), {{one of which}} may be a High Court judge pro <b>tempura</b> (konstitueret landsdommer). Every case is assigned a chamber and a panel of three judges is constituted to hear the case, usually composed of the three judges of the chamber but it may also be composed of judges across the chambers or of more than three judges. Though the President of the High Court appoints a presiding judge for each chamber, all decisions are reached by a simple majority except in jury trials where a qualified majority is necessary for a guilty verdict.|$|E
25|$|In some cases, Japanese cuisine in Indonesia often slanted to suit Indonesian taste. Hoka Hoka Bento in {{particular}} is Indonesian-owned Japanese fastfood restaurant chain that cater to Indonesian clientele. As the result the foods served there have been adapted to suit Indonesians' taste. Examples of the change include stronger flavour compared to authentic subtle Japanese taste, the preference for fried food, {{as well as the}} addition of sambal to cater to Indonesians' preference for hot and spicy food. Japanese food popularity also had penetrated street food culture, as modest Warjep or Warung Jepang (Japanese food stall) offer Japanese food such as <b>tempura</b> and takoyaki, at very moderately low prices. This is also pushed further by the Japanese convenience stores operating in Indonesia, such as 7-Eleven and Lawson offering Japanese favourites such as oden, chicken katsu (deep-fried chicken cutlet), chicken teriyaki and onigiri.|$|E
25|$|In the ASEAN region, Indonesia is {{the second}} largest market for Japanese food, after Thailand. Japanese cuisine has been {{increasingly}} popular as {{the growth of the}} Indonesians middle-class expecting higher quality foods. This is also contributed to the fact that Indonesia has large numbers of Japanese expatriates. The main concern is the halal issue. As a Muslim majority country, Indonesians expected that Japanese food served there are halal according to Islamic dietary law, which means no pork and alcohol allowed. Japanese restaurant in Indonesia often offer set menu which include rice served with array of Japanese favourite in a single setting. A set menu might include a choice of yakiniku or sukiyaki, including sample of sushi, <b>tempura,</b> gyoza and miso soup.

2500|$|There {{are several}} factors for the popularization and flourishing of <b>tempura</b> at Tokyo Bay in the Edo period. The {{abundance}} of seafood in the Tokyo Bay {{is the basic}} factor. In addition, as oil extraction techniques advanced, cooking oil became inexpensive. In those days, serving deep-fried foods indoors was prohibited in Edo due to a possible fire hazard. [...] Traditional Japanese housing was constructed with paper and wood which could catch fire easily from the <b>tempura</b> oil. [...] For that reason, <b>tempura</b> gained popularity as fast food eaten outside at the food stall. Eating <b>tempura</b> {{in those days was}} made to be convenient like fast food as <b>tempura</b> was skewered and eaten with a dipping sauce. [...] <b>Tempura</b> has been considered as one of [...] "the Edo Delicacies" [...] along with soba (buckwheat noodles) and sushi which were also food stall take outs. [...] The modern <b>tempura</b> recipe was first published in 1671 in the cook book called [...] "料理献立抄". After the Meiji period, <b>tempura</b> was no longer considered as a fast food item but instead developed as a high-class cuisine.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{beginning}} of the 17th century around the Tokyo Bay areas, the raw materials of <b>tempura</b> and its method underwent a remarkable change as the Yatai (food cart) culture gained more popularity. Making the best use of fresh seafood while preserving its delicate taste, <b>tempura</b> used only flour, eggs and water as ingredients and the batter was not flavored. [...] As the batter was mixed minimally in cold water, it avoided the dough-like stickiness caused by the activation of wheat gluten, resulting in the crispy texture which is now characteristic of <b>tempura.</b> It became customary to eat <b>tempura</b> by dipping quickly in a sauce mixed with grated daikon just before it was eaten. Today in Japan the mainstream of <b>tempura</b> recipes basically originate from [...] "Tokyo style (Edo style)" [...] <b>tempura,</b> which was invented at the food stalls along the riverside fish market in the Edo period.|$|E
2500|$|In Japan, {{restaurants}} {{specializing in}} <b>tempura</b> are called tenpura-ya. Many restaurants offer <b>tempura</b> {{as part of}} a set meal or a bento (lunch box), and it is also a popular ingredient in take-out or convenience store bento boxes.
