5|$|A {{number of}} species of shrimp and fish take refuge among <b>the</b> <b>branches</b> <b>of</b> Millepora alcicornis, {{seemingly}} immune to the venom. Hawkfish in particular often perch {{on top of the}} fire coral, perhaps protected by their skinless pectoral fins. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Millepora alcicornis has few predators. The fireworm (Hermodice carunculata) sometimes grazes on it, but prefers other corals. Certain nudibranchs in the genus Phyllidia eat it as do filefish in the family Monacanthidae.|$|E

5|$|Especially in warmer areas, {{the house}} sparrow may build its nests in the open, on <b>the</b> <b>branches</b> <b>of</b> trees, {{especially}} evergreens and hawthorns, {{or in the}} nests of large birds such as storks or magpies. In open nesting sites, breeding success tends to be lower, since breeding begins late and the nest can easily be destroyed or damaged by storms. Less common nesting sites include street lights and neon signs, favoured for their warmth; and the old open-topped nests of other songbirds, which are then domed over.|$|E

5|$|After {{sweeping}} through France and Belgium in {{the summer}} of 1944, after the Battle of Normandy, the Allies were poised to enter the Netherlands.

To this end, the Allies launched Operation Market Garden on 17 September 1944. Allied Airborne troops were dropped in the Netherlands to secure key bridges and towns along the Allied axis of advance. Farthest north, the British 1st Airborne Division, supported by men of the Glider Pilot Regiment and the 1st Polish Parachute Brigade, landed at Arnhem to secure bridges across the Nederrijn.
