50|$|After the {{production}} of the Twaron polymer in Delfzijl, the polymer is brought to Emmen, where fibres are produced by spinning the dissolved polymer into a solid fibre from a liquid chemical blend. Polymer solvent for spinning PPTA is generally 100% anhydrous (water free) sulfuric acid (H2SO4). The polymer is dissolved by mixing frozen sulfuric acid <b>in</b> <b>powder</b> <b>form</b> with the polymer <b>in</b> <b>powder</b> <b>form</b> and gently heating the mixture. This process, which differs from the more difficult DuPont process, was invented by Henri Lammers and patented by AKZO.|$|R

50|$|The team is also {{developing}} {{a version of}} the device for transdermal delivery of drugs ordinarily found <b>in</b> <b>powdered</b> <b>form</b> by programming the device to vibrate, turning powder into a “fluidized” form that can be delivered through the skin much like a liquid. A powder-delivery vehicle may help solve what’s known as the “cold-chain” problem: Vaccines delivered to developing countries need to be refrigerated if they are in liquid form. Often, coolers break down, spoiling whole batches of vaccines. Instead, Hunter says a vaccine that can be administered <b>in</b> <b>powder</b> <b>form</b> requires no cooling, avoiding the cold-chain problem.|$|R

5000|$|Flammable {{products}} {{have a tendency}} to become explosive <b>in</b> <b>powder</b> <b>form.</b> Steel media may spark, becoming an ignition source for these products. Either wet-grinding, or non-sparking media such as ceramic or lead must be selected.|$|R
50|$|Abrin is a {{water-soluble}} lectin. Abrin <b>in</b> <b>powdered</b> <b>form</b> is yellowish-white. It is {{a stable}} substance and can withstand extreme environmental conditions. Though it is combustible, {{it does not}} polymerize easily and is not particularly volatile.|$|R
40|$|Melamine-urea-formaldehyde (MUF) resins can be {{spray dried}} to obtain resins <b>in</b> <b>powder</b> <b>form</b> and {{indefinite}} shelf-life. Application as particleboard adhesives of such resins after redissolving them in water does yield resins of excellent performance as particleboard adhesives if the natural advancement {{caused by the}} heat in the spray-drier chamber is taken into account. CP MAS 13 C NMR analysis of the spray-dried resin <b>in</b> <b>powder</b> <b>form</b> and thermomechanical analysis has shown some difference in behaviour in relation to MUF resins of {{the same level of}} water tolerance which have not been spray-dried. These small but significant differences can be ascribed to differences in resin structure...|$|R
