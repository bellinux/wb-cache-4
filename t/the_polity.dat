5|$|An {{imbalance}} {{was created}} in <b>the</b> <b>polity</b> by {{the result of the}} 1961 plebiscite. Southern Cameroon opted to join the Republic of Cameroon while Northern Cameroons chose to remain in Nigeria. The northern part of the country was now far larger than the southern part. In 1963, the nation established a Federal Republic, with Azikiwe as its first president. When elections were held in 1965, the Nigerian National Democratic Party came to power in Nigeria's Western Region.|$|E
5|$|At Calakmul's {{peak in the}} 7th century, <b>the</b> <b>polity</b> {{was known}} as Kan. Interesting {{to know is that}} the title Kan was used at another place before Calakmul became a {{regional}} powerhouse. The Preclassic political state in the Mirador Basin also used the title Kan. There is the idea that, {{after the collapse of the}} Mirador state, its refugees migrated north towards Calakmul, where they founded a new Kan polity. However, epigraphical studies of the monuments at Calakmul show that prior to the 7th century AD the emblem glyph of Calakmul had nothing to do with a snake, but with a bat. It seems that a different polity ruled there. The Kan emblem glyph, before being associated with Calakmul, is found (once) at Dzibanché, a site more towards the east. Perhaps during the late 6th/early 7th century, <b>the</b> <b>polity</b> at Dzibanché moved to Calakmul in order to establish a more strategically placed capital. After Calakmul's power dwindled in the 8th century, after the rule of Yuknoom Took K'awiil, it appears that the bat emblem glyph made its resurgence. Still, many uncertainties remain and new epigraphical studies have to be done to fill the gaps.|$|E
5|$|But how, {{it may be}} asked, can any {{analogous}} principle {{apply in}} nature?

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>polity</b> of Tondo flourished {{during the}} latter half of the Ming dynasty as a result of direct trade {{relations}} with China. The Tondo district was the traditional capital of the empire, and its rulers were sovereign kings, not mere chieftains. They were addressed variously as panginuan in Maranao or panginoón in Tagalog ("lords"); anák banwa ("son of heaven"); or lakandula ("lord of the palace"). The Emperor of China considered the Lakans—the rulers of ancient Manila—"王", or kings.|$|E
5|$|The {{early history}} of the site is lost due to the catastrophic defeat of <b>the</b> <b>polity</b> in AD 735 by the nearby Petexbatun kingdom with its capital at Dos Pilas, {{resulting}} {{in the destruction of}} its earlier sculpted monuments. Seibal was reduced to being a vassal state until the destruction of the Petexbatun kingdom in the late 8th century AD. In AD 830 a new elite installed itself at the site with the arrival of Wat'ul Chatel from Ucanal to the east. This new arrival reinvigorated Seibal and allowed it to last to the dawn of the 10th century, well after the Classic Maya collapse had engulfed most of the region.|$|E
5|$|Calakmul {{is one of}} {{the most}} structure-rich sites within the Maya region. The site {{contains}} 117 stelae, the largest total in the region. Most are in paired sets representing rulers and their wives. However, because these carved stelae were produced in soft limestone, most of these stelae have been eroded beyond interpretation. Also many elaborate murals were discovered at Calakmul. These murals do not represent activities of the elite class. Rather, they depict elaborate market scenes of people preparing or consuming products such as atole, tamales, or tobacco as an ointment. Also items being sold were textiles and needles. These murals also have glyphs within them describing the actions occurring. The most prominent figure in these murals is identified as Lady Nine Stone; she appears in many scenes. This brings a world of the Maya marketplace to vibrant life for archaeologists. Another highly beneficial resource to Maya archaeological understanding at Calakmul is the ceramic remains. The composition of the ceramic materials identifies the region or more specifically <b>the</b> <b>polity</b> that produced them. Ceramics with the snake emblem glyph found at several sites also give more evidence to identify ties or control over that site by Calakmul.|$|E

5|$|The Sultanate of Mogadishu later {{developed}} with the immigration of Emozeidi Arabs, a community whose earliest presence {{dates back to}} the 9th or 10th century. According to the 16th century explorer Leo Africanus, the Mogadishu Sultanate (Magadazo) was the principal city-state within the larger Adea Kingdom, located south of the Adal Sultanate and east of the Abyssinian Empire. It was ruled by an Islamic aristocracy, which paid tribute to the Christian king of Abyssinia. The native inhabitants of <b>the</b> <b>polity</b> were of the same origins as the denizens of the northern Adal Sultanate. This Mogadishu Sultanate evolved into the Muzaffar dynasty, a joint Somali-Arab federation of rulers, and Mogadishu became closely linked with the powerful Ajuran Sultanate. Following his visit to the city, the 12th century Syrian historian Yaqut al-Hamawi wrote that it was inhabited by swarthy Berbers, ancestors of Somalis in the area.|$|E
5|$|Unlike the Aztecs and the Inca, the Maya {{political}} system never integrated the entire Maya cultural area {{into a single}} state or empire. Rather, throughout its history, the Maya area contained a varying mix of political complexity that included both states and chiefdoms. These polities fluctuated greatly in their relationships {{with each other and}} were engaged in a complex web of rivalries, periods of dominance or submission, vassalage, and alliances. At times, different polities achieved regional dominance, such as Calakmul, Caracol, Mayapan, and Tikal. The first reliably evidenced polities formed in the Maya lowlands in the 9th century BC. During the Late Preclassic, the Maya {{political system}} coalesced into a theopolitical form, where elite ideology justified the ruler's authority, and was reinforced by public display, ritual, and religion. The divine king was the centre of political power, exercising ultimate control over the administrative, economic, judicial, and military functions of <b>the</b> <b>polity.</b> The divine authority invested within the ruler was such that the king was able to mobilize both the aristocracy and commoners in executing huge infrastructure projects, apparently with no police force or standing army. Some polities engaged in a strategy of increasing administration, and filling administrative posts with loyal supporters rather than blood relatives. Within a polity, mid-ranking population centres would have {{played a key role in}} managing resources and internal conflict.|$|E

40|$|In the 9 th century CE, a vast <b>polity</b> {{centered}} on <b>the</b> region of Angkor was taking shape {{in what is}} today Cambodia and Northeast Thailand. At this time <b>the</b> <b>polity's</b> inhabitants, <b>the</b> Khmers, began {{to see themselves as}} members of a community of territorial integrity and shared ethnic identity. This sense of belonging, enshrined in <b>the</b> <b>polity's</b> name, Kambujadesa (i. e., Cambodia) or "the land of the descendants of Kambu," represents {{one of the most remarkable}} local cultural innovations in Southeast Asian history. However, the history and implications of early Cambodian identity have thus far been largely overlooked. In this study I use the evidence from the Old Khmer and Sanskrit inscriptions to argue that Angkorian Cambodia (9 th- 15 th centuries CE) was at its conceptual core an ethnic polity or a "nation" [...] an analytic category signifying, in Steven Grosby's words, an extensive "territorial community of nativity. " The inscriptions of Cambodia's provincial elite suggest that <b>the</b> <b>polity's</b> autonomy and its people's common descent were widely disseminated ideals, celebrated in polity-wide myths and perpetuated in representations of <b>the</b> <b>polity's</b> foreign antagonists. I contend that this culture of territorial nativity contradicts the prevailing cosmological model of pre-modern politics in Southeast Asian studies, which assumes that <b>polities</b> before <b>the</b> 19 th century were characterized by exaggerated royal claims to universal power and the absence of felt communities beyond extended family and religion. At the same time I seek to problematize standard historical accounts of the nation which fail to observe the affinity between territoriality and fictive kinship in select political cultures before the era of ideological nationalism...|$|R
