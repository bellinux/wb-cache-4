5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Magical</b> Worlds of Harry Potter: A Treasury of Myths, Legends, and Fascinating Facts is a {{guide to}} the fictional Harry Potter universe, written by David Colbert.

During {{the filming of}} the Beatles' first feature film, A Hard Day's Night, Evans {{appeared in}} a cameo role, carrying an upright bass in between John Lennon and Millie in the backstage scene in which Millie mistakes Lennon for someone else. In Help!, Evans played a confused channel swimmer who pops up through an ice-hole in Austria, and {{on a beach in}} the Bahamas. Evans and Aspinall were asked to find and hire the actors that were needed to perform in <b>the</b> <b>Magical</b> Mystery Tour film, and to hire an old 60-seater coach, on which they were told to paint <b>the</b> <b>Magical</b> Mystery Tour logo, which McCartney had designed. Evans later appeared in the film as one of the magicians, who cast mysterious spells on the passengers of the bus.|$|E

Tina, who knows Credence, arrives and attempts to calm him, while Graves tries to convince Credence to listen to him. As Credence begins to settle into human form Aurors arrive. They apparently disintegrate him to protect <b>the</b> <b>magical</b> society, but a tiny Obscurus fragment escapes. Graves admits to unleashing the Obscurus to expose <b>the</b> <b>magical</b> community to the No-Majs, and angrily claims that MACUSA protects the No-Majs more than themselves.

5|$|Ravana fights {{the final}} duel with Rama. Rama fails to kill Ravana with his {{ordinary}} arrows, but finally kills with a magical arrow. While Valmiki's Ramayana narrates that <b>the</b> <b>magical</b> arrow {{was given to}} Rama by Indra, in other versions <b>the</b> <b>magical</b> arrow is hidden in Mandodari's bed chambers or under her bed. While Mandodari is engrossed in worshipping the goddess Parvati for Ravana's wellbeing, Hanuman comes to her disguised as a Brahmin. After winning her confidence, he tricks her into revealing the secret location of the arrow. Hanuman seizes the arrow and gives it to Rama, leading to Ravana's end. Mandodari appears at the death scene of Ravana in a disarrayed state and laments his death. In this battle, Mandodari loses her husband, her sons, and her kinsmen.|$|E
5|$|The myth {{influenced}} popular {{religion as}} well. One example is <b>the</b> <b>magical</b> healing spells based on Horus's childhood. Another {{is the use}} of the Eye of Horus as a protective emblem in personal apotropaic amulets. Its mythological restoration made it appropriate for this purpose, as a general symbol of well-being.|$|E

5|$|Alboin's {{death had}} a lasting impact, as it {{deprived}} the Lombards {{of the only}} leader they had that could have kept together the newborn Germanic entity. His end also represents {{the death of the}} last of the line of the hero-kings that had led the Lombards through their migrations from the Elba to Italy. His fame survived him for many centuries in epic poetry, with Saxons and Bavarians celebrating his prowess in battle, his heroism, and <b>the</b> <b>magical</b> properties of his weapons.|$|E
5|$|Along these lines, some {{academics}} {{link the}} Gawain pentangle to magical traditions. In Germany, the symbol {{was called a}} Drudenfuß and was placed on household objects to keep out evil. The symbol was also associated with magical charms that, if recited or written on a weapon, would call forth magical forces. However, concrete evidence tying <b>the</b> <b>magical</b> pentagram to Gawain's pentangle is scarce.|$|E

Ron and Hermione are also sorted into Gryffindor. Draco is sorted into Slytherin, like his whole family before him.|$|E

5|$|Colbert {{received}} {{the idea for}} <b>The</b> <b>Magical</b> Worlds of Harry Potter {{during the summer of}} 2000, when his young nephew and nieces spent their vacation at his home in Wrightsville Beach, North Carolina. During {{the first half of the}} children's vacation, Colbert noticed their excitement for the novel Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, which was about to be released in bookstores.

5|$|Colbert wrote <b>The</b> <b>Magical</b> Worlds of Harry Potter while {{teaching}} {{a seminar on}} self-publishing to graduate students at the University of North Carolina.

Colbert has never met Rowling and the book has not been approved by her or Warner Brothers (the owner of the film rights to the Harry Potter novels). He was given permission to publish it as long as he noted on the cover that it had not been approved by Rowling.|$|E

When Kratos found Eos in the Caves of Olympus, she advised him to find the Primordial Fires and free Helios' loyal Fire Steeds, as they could find the Sun God. She also provided him with <b>the</b> <b>magical</b> ability, Light of Dawn. She did not appear in God of War III, leaving her fate unknown. The character was voiced by Erin Torpey in Chains of Olympus.|$|E

No other venue has hosted more NCAA Championships and no other venue had held three consecutive U.S. Olympic Trials. Many have attested to <b>the</b> <b>magical</b> aura of Hayward field, citing many personal bests run at the venue. Credit often goes to the regular attendance of knowledgeable track and field fans for the phenomenon.|$|E
5|$|In {{this stage}} of the myth, Horus is a {{vulnerable}} child beset by dangers. <b>The</b> <b>magical</b> texts that use Horus's childhood as the basis for their healing spells give him different ailments, from scorpion stings to simple stomachaches, adapting the tradition to fit the malady that each spell was intended to treat. Most commonly, the child god has been bitten by a snake, reflecting the Egyptians' fear of snakebite and the resulting poison. Some texts indicate that these hostile creatures are agents of Set. Isis may use her own magical powers to save her child, or she may plead with or threaten deities such as Ra or Geb, so they will cure him. As she is the archetypal mourner in the first portion of the story, so during Horus's childhood she is the ideal devoted mother. Through <b>the</b> <b>magical</b> healing texts, her efforts to heal her son are extended to cure any patient.|$|E
