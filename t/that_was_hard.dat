25|$|The {{song was}} written {{considering}} how popular music consumers chose {{to listen to}} music in the early 2010s: by listening to samples on a purchasing page, or to ringtone versions of a song, and from there deciding if they like a song or not. Yamaguchi wanted to create a song <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> to critically review due to its complexity, and that music consumers could not evaluate listening to a single sample. Yamaguchi wrote a song that was similar in style to songs in a Japanese school chorus competition: songs without a chorus but with multiple different verses. He made the first section begin with a kayōkyoku-inspired pop melody, so that the song could be understood by casual pop music listeners.|$|E

500|$|The bill came to {{the floor}} of the House of Representatives on February 16. [...] As soon as the bill was read, California Representative John E. Raker pressed an {{amendment}} to provide for a California Diamond Jubilee half dollar. He explained that Senator Samuel Shortridge had gotten a bill through the Senate that was nearly identical to his amendment, and [...] "the Senator is exceptionally anxious that it go through." [...] Vestal asked to be heard in opposition to the amendment, stating that his committee, after recommending the Bennington bill, had decided to promote no further coin bills. He added that because of this, Washington Representative Albert Johnson had agreed to withdraw his bill for a commemorative honoring the centennial of Fort Vancouver, in his state. The Minority Leader, Democratic Congressman Finis J. Garrett of Tennessee, asked why the committee had not set the rule before considering the Bennington bill, and Vestal admitted <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> to answer. The House voted, and the California amendment was added. But Representative Johnson to applause from his colleagues moved a further amendment, to add [...] "and Vancouver, Wash." [...] (that is, the state of Washington) The amendment passed, as did the bill. Johnson realized that such a simple amendment might not result in a coin being issued, and returned to the House floor soon thereafter, asking that the bill be reconsidered, so he could couch his amendment in the same phrasing as for the other two coins. Once the bill was again being considered, Johnson added his amendment, but Vestal moved that the bill be returned to his committee. His motion failed, 24 ayes to 67 noes. Lengthy procedural wrangling followed over whether that vote could be objected to because there was no quorum present. [...] Once this was resolved, the House passed the bill again. The bill was returned to the Senate the following day. Kansas' Charles Curtis moved on behalf of Greene that the Senate agree to the House amendments, [...] and the bill, authorizing all three coins, was enacted by Coolidge's signature on February 24, 1925. Anthony Swiatek and Walter Breen, in their 1988 book on commemoratives, state that the bill would probably not have passed Congress if Coolidge had not been known to have an interest in the Bennington observances.|$|E
