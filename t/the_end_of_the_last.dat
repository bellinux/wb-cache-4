5|$|After {{finishing}} top of {{the table}} at <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> round, they comfortably defeated the Hurricanes 33–22 in the semi-final, {{and went on to}} beat the Waratahs in the final 20–12. It was a fitting way to send off long-serving coach Robbie Deans before he departed to coach Australia. It was also the last game for Crusaders stalwarts Caleb Ralph and former captain Reuben Thorne. In July that year former captain Todd Blackadder was appointed Crusaders coach, and his former teammates Mark Hammett and Daryl Gibson were appointed as assistants.|$|E
5|$|Although {{underlain}} by {{much older}} Triassic age formations that protrude to form what would {{once have been}} islands—such as Athelney, Brent Knoll, Burrow Mump and Glastonbury Tor, which is composed of Blue Lias, the lowland landscape was formed only during the last 10,000years, following <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> ice age. As the sea level changed following the Pliocene era, vegetation was laid down which was later converted into peat. The peak of the peat formation took place in swamp conditions around 6,000years ago, although in some areas it continued into medieval times.|$|E

5|$|Horse remains {{dating to}} the later part of this period– roughly coinciding with <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> glacial period– have been found at Farndon Fields, Nottinghamshire, dating from around 12,000BC. Mother Grundy's Parlour, also in Creswell Crags, {{contains}} horse remains showing cut marks indicating that hunting of horses occurred there around 10,000BC. A study of Victoria Cave in North Yorkshire produced a horse bone showing cut marks dating from about the same time.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} the Mérens is closely linked to its {{homeland}} in the Pyrenees, {{as evidenced by the}} many myths and legends in which it plays a role. The origins of the Mérens are very old, and are commonly said to be lost in the mists of time. It is native to the upper valley of Ariege, near Andorra. The direct ancestor of the Mérens was probably in this valley during the Quaternary Period, approximately 15,000 years ago. These wild horses probably moved to the mountains to escape global warming that accompanied <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> glacial period.|$|E

5|$|The {{river and}} its {{drainage}} basin experienced {{some of the}} world's greatest known catastrophic floods toward <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> ice age. The periodic rupturing of ice dams at Glacial Lake Missoula resulted in the Missoula Floods, with discharges exceeding the combined flow {{of all the other}} rivers in the world, dozens of times over thousands of years. The exact number of floods is unknown, but geologists have documented at least 40; evidence suggests that they occurred between about 19,000 and 13,000years ago.|$|E

5|$|While Palestine {{had been}} {{under the rule of}} the Ottoman Empire from the early 16th century, direct {{imperial}} administrative rule was challenged by a series of tribal leaders who exhibited vast influence over local affairs between the 17th and 19th centuries. With the Ottoman Empire embroiled in the Crimean War, the power vacuum created in the area in the wake of Zahir al-Umar's rule in the Galilee (1730–1775), Ahmad Pasha al-Jazzar's rule (1776–1804), and Muhammad Ali's rule (1831–1840), was filled by Aqil. Aqil's demise represented <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> local obstacle to Ottoman centralization in Palestine.|$|E

5|$|Although the camas {{pocket gopher}} is {{fiercely}} defensive when cornered, {{it may become}} tame in captivity. While population trends are generally stable, threats to the species' survival include urbanization, habitat conversion for agricultural use and active attempts at eradication with trapping and poisons. It is prey for raptors and carnivorous mammals, and host to several parasitic arthropods and worms. Scientists believe that the gopher's evolutionary history was disrupted when the Missoula Floods washed over the Willamette Valley at <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> ice age. The floods almost completely inundated its geographic range, which may have caused a genetic bottleneck as survivors repopulated the region after the waters receded.|$|E
5|$|Although {{underlain}} by {{much older}} Triassic age formations that protrude to form what would {{once have been}} islands—such as Athelney, Brent Knoll, Burrow Mump and Glastonbury Tor—the lowland landscape was formed only during the last 10,000years, following <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> ice age. Glastonbury Tor is composed of Upper Lias Sand. The Poldens and the Isle of Wedmore are composed of Blue Lias and Marl, while the Mendips are largely Carboniferous limestone. Although sea level changes since the Pliocene led to changes in sea level and the laying down of vegetation, {{the peak of the}} peat formation took place in swamp conditions around 6,000years ago, although in some areas it continued into medieval times.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of human {{settlement}} of the Americas, the California condor was widespread across North America; condor bones from the late Pleistocene have been found at the Cutler Fossil Site in southern Florida. However, at <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> glacial period came the extinction of the megafauna {{that led to a}} subsequent reduction in range and population. Five hundred years ago, the California condor roamed across the American Southwest and West Coast. Faunal remains of condors have been found documented in Arizona, Nevada, New Mexico, and Texas. The Lewis and Clark Expedition of the early 19th century reported on their sighting and shooting of California condors near the mouth of the Columbia River.|$|E

5|$|Following <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> glacial period, Indiana's {{topography}} {{was dominated}} by spruce and pine forests and was home to mastodon, caribou, and saber-toothed cats. While Northern Indiana had been covered by glaciers, Southern Indiana remained unaltered by the ice's advance, leaving plants and animals that could sustain human communities. Indiana's earliest known inhabitants were Paleo-Indians. Evidence exists that humans were in Indiana {{as early as the}} Archaic stage (8000–6000 BC). Hunting camps of the nomadic Clovis culture have been found in Indiana. Carbon dating of artifacts found in the Wyandotte Caves of Southern Indiana shows humans mined flint there as early 2000 BC. These nomads ate quantities of freshwater mussels from local streams, as shown by their shell mounds found throughout southern Indiana.|$|E
5|$|Humans {{first entered}} {{what would become}} Indiana near <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> ice age. The region around Harrison County was of {{particular}} value to the early humans because of the abundance of flint. There is evidence of flint mining in local caves as early as 2000BCE; the stone was used to produce crude tools. Passing migratory tribes frequented the area which was influenced by succeeding groups of peoples including the Hopewells and Mississippians. One flint-working and camping location {{is known as the}} Swan's Landing Archeological Site; it is among the most important Early Archaic archaeological sites anywhere in eastern North America. Permanent human settlements in the county began with the arrival of American settlers in {{the last decade of the}} 18thcentury.|$|E
5|$|Penry-Jones {{announced}} {{his intention to}} leave the series in December 2007, while it was later announced Armitage would join. Norris and Raison were both asked to return after their characters were left open for return after <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> series. In developing the series, the producers wanted to repeat the serialised style from series six, and settled on using the resurgence of Russia as the primary storyline, as they felt that at the time, the resurgence is in subtle ways threatening {{the security of the}} west. The producers also participated in several meetings with the writers to discuss the purpose of Sugarhorse. Filming started in London in March 2008, and later finished on August in the same year, in Moscow, the first time in series history where Spooks was filmed outside the United Kingdom.|$|E
