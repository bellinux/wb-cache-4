5|$|In West Africa, {{the sons}} and daughters of Yoruba kings were {{traditionally}} given in marriage to their fellow royals as a matter of dynastic policy. Sometimes these marriages would involve members of other tribes. Erinwinde of Benin, for example, was taken as a wife by the Oba Oranyan of Oyo during his time as governor of Benin.

5|$|Critics of {{the system}} suggest <b>that</b> <b>rules</b> {{for the use of}} DRS have created an {{inconsistency}} of approach to lbw decisions depending on the circumstances of the referral. Opponents also doubt that the ball-tracking technology used in deciding lbws is reliable enough, but the ICC state that tests have shown the system to be 100% accurate. The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) have consistently declined to use DRS in matches involving India owing to their concerns regarding the ball-tracking technology. Early DRS trials were conducted during India matches, and several problems arose over lbws, particularly as the equipment was not as advanced as it later became. The BCCI believe the technology is unreliable and open to manipulation.|$|E

50|$|In logic, {{a rule of}} {{inference}} {{is admissible}} in a formal system if the set of theorems of the system does not change when <b>that</b> <b>rule</b> {{is added to the}} existing rules of the system. In other words, every formula that can be derived using <b>that</b> <b>rule</b> is already derivable without <b>that</b> <b>rule,</b> so, in a sense, it is redundant. The concept of an admissible rule was introduced by Paul Lorenzen (1955).|$|R
5|$|Following {{an effort}} from the International Maple Syrup Institute (IMSI) and many maple syrup {{producer}} associations, both Canada and the United States have altered their laws regarding {{the classification of}} maple syrup to be uniform. Whereas in the past each state or province had their own laws on the classification of maple syrup, now those laws define a unified grading system. This had been {{a work in progress}} for several years, and most of the finalization of the new grading system was made in 2014. The Canadian Food Inspection Agency announced in the Canada Gazette on 28 June 2014 <b>that</b> <b>rules</b> for the sale of maple syrup would be amended to include new descriptors, {{at the request of the}} IMSI.|$|E
5|$|Train Heartnet, once {{an assassin}} for Chronos, an {{organization}} bent on world peace <b>that</b> <b>rules</b> {{one third of}} the world's economy, is now an easygoing Sweeper (licensed bounty hunter) traveling with his partner Sven Vollfied. They meet and team up with professional thief Rinslet Walker in order to break into an arms dealer's home and obtain some data, but encounter a human bio-weapon named Eve that was created using nanotechnology. Sven and Train ultimately decide to free Eve from her owner and train her to be a Sweeper. Rinslet is kidnapped by Creed Diskenth, a former Chronos assassin that killed Train's friend Saya Minatsuki for changing Train's outlook on life and which contributed to him leaving Chronos, to persuade Train to join his group the Apostles of the Stars in order to overthrow Chronos and start a world revolution. The duel ends as a draw, with both Creed and Train injured.|$|E
5|$|Depending on the player's actions, {{the newly}} {{reformed}} Etrurian Army then continues through either the snowy tundras of Ilia and its many mercenary groups on Bern's contract, {{or through the}} Sacae plains where nomad tribes have allied with Bern. Both paths ultimately take the Etrurian Army to Bern's borders, where Roy discovers a shrine housing the Binding Blade, a powerful weapon <b>that</b> <b>rules</b> over the other eight Divine Weapons. Combined with the Fire Emblem, Roy is granted its incredible power and wields the Binding Blade in the final assault on Bern's capital. Zephiel is eventually killed by the Etrurian Army and his Divine Weapon is taken from him, but the war does not end with his death. Before his last battle, Zephiel had sent his remaining forces to gather somewhere in Elibe. The eight Divine Weapons suddenly emit a light that leads the Lycian Army to this location: an ancient temple that had long ago been built by the dragons.|$|E

25|$|Compared to children, {{adolescents}} {{are more likely}} to question others' assertions, and less likely to accept facts as absolute truths. Through experience outside the family circle, they learn <b>that</b> <b>rules</b> they were taught as absolute are in fact relativistic. They begin to differentiate between rules instituted out of common sense—not touching a hot stove—and those that are based on culturally-relative standards (codes of etiquette, not dating until a certain age), a delineation that younger children do not make. This can lead to a period of questioning authority in all domains.|$|E
25|$|Mayor Randy George {{was criticized}} by {{residents}} for {{his use of}} two borough-owned generators in the persistent electric outages during the days following the devastation of Hurricane Sandy to provide power to the refrigerators in his ice cream store, while Police Chief Robert Bracco had used another municipal-owned generator to provide power at his home. A special committee formed of borough council members found that the actions were justifiable {{in light of the}} circumstances and enabled them to serve the borough during the emergency, but recommended <b>that</b> <b>rules</b> be established to govern personal use of borough property by municipal employees and officials.|$|E

25|$|Another {{aspect of}} microsociology aims {{to focus on}} {{individual}} behavior in social settings. One specific researcher in the field, Erving Goffman, claims that humans {{tend to believe that}} they are actors on a stage. He explains his theories in his book The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life. He argues that as a result, individuals will further proceed with their actions based on the response of that individual's 'audience' or in other words, the people to whom he is speaking. Much like a play, Goffman believes <b>that</b> <b>rules</b> of conversing and communication exist: to display confidence, display sincerity, and avoid infractions which are otherwise known as embarrassing situations. Breaches of such rules are what make social situations awkward.|$|E
