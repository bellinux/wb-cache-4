30|$|When {{heat-treated}} wood {{is used as}} an interior material, its sound absorption properties should be considered.

5|$|Anomalous X-ray {{scattering}} (MAD or SAD phasing)– the X-ray wavelength may be scanned past an {{absorption edge}} of an atom, which changes the scattering in a known way. By recording full sets of reflections at three different wavelengths (far below, far above {{and in the middle}} of <b>the</b> <b>absorption</b> edge) one can solve for the substructure of the anomalously diffracting atoms and hence the structure of the whole molecule. The most popular method of incorporating anomalous scattering atoms into proteins is to express the protein in a methionine auxotroph (a host incapable of synthesizing methionine) in a media rich in seleno-methionine, which contains selenium atoms. A MAD experiment can then be conducted around <b>the</b> <b>absorption</b> edge, which should then yield the position of any methionine residues within the protein, providing initial phases.|$|E
