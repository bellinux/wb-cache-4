5000|$|Valat: Like the [...] "slam" [...] in French tarot, the declarer wins all the tricks. With a contract, this multiplies <b>the</b> <b>bid</b> <b>by</b> {{eight times}} (e.g., <b>the</b> Solo <b>bid's</b> 8 points multiplied by 8 for 64 bonus points from each defender). However, failure to fulfill means {{the same number}} of points will be paid to each defender. An unannounced valat will only {{multiply}} <b>the</b> <b>bid</b> <b>by</b> four times.|$|R
