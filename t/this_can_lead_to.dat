5|$|Clumber Spaniels shed at {{a medium}} pace. Clumbers tend to drool {{because of their}} very droopy flews. Clumbers have minds of their own. Puppies are {{especially}} curious and playful. The breed has a trophy mentality and the dog has an incessant need to carry something most of the time; unfortunately <b>this</b> <b>can</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> health issues as they may ingest the items.|$|E

5|$|Elevated {{concentrations}} of the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) may be detected. Other markers of muscle damage, such as aldolase, troponin, carbonic anhydrase type 3 and fatty acid-binding protein (FABP), are mainly used in chronic muscle diseases. The transaminases, enzymes abundant in both liver and muscle tissue, are also usually increased; <b>this</b> <b>can</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> the condition being confused with acute liver injury, {{at least in}} the early stages. The incidence of actual acute liver injury is 25% in people with non-traumatic rhabdomyolysis; the mechanism for this is uncertain.|$|E
5|$|Fire or Police Linked Service – In {{countries}} such as the United States, Japan, Hong Kong and France ambulances can be operated by the local fire or police service, more commonly the fire service due to overlapping calls. This is particularly common in rural areas, where maintaining a separate service is not necessarily cost effective, or by service preference such as in LA where the LAFD prefers to handle all parts of emergency medicine in-house. In some cases <b>this</b> <b>can</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> an illness or injury being attended by a vehicle other than an ambulance, such as a fire truck.|$|E
5|$|The {{management}} of {{low back pain}} often includes medications for the duration that they are beneficial. With the first episode of low back pain the hope is a complete cure; however, if the problem becomes chronic, the goals may change to pain management and the recovery of as much function as possible. As pain medications are only somewhat effective, expectations regarding their benefit may differ from reality, and <b>this</b> <b>can</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> decreased satisfaction.|$|E

5|$|Those {{with severe}} {{encephalopathy}} (stages 3 and 4) {{are at risk}} of obstructing their airway due to decreased protective reflexes such as the gag reflex. <b>This</b> <b>can</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> respiratory arrest. Transferring the person to a higher level of nursing care, such as an intensive care unit, is required and intubation of the airway is often necessary to prevent life-threatening complications (e.g., aspiration or respiratory failure). Placement of a nasogastric tube permits the safe administration of nutrients and medication.|$|E
5|$|Lithium-ion {{batteries}} {{may suffer}} thermal runaway and cell rupture if overheated or overcharged, and {{in extreme cases}} <b>this</b> <b>can</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> combustion. To reduce these risks, lithium-ion battery packs contain fail-safe circuitry that shuts down the battery when its voltage is outside the safe range. When handled improperly, or if manufactured defectively, some rechargeable batteries can experience thermal runaway resulting in overheating. Especially prone to thermal runaway are lithium-ion batteries. Reports of exploding cellphones {{have been reported in}} newspapers. In 2006, batteries from Apple, HP, Toshiba, Lenovo, Dell and other notebook manufacturers were recalled because of fire and explosions. Also, during the Boeing 787 Dreamliner's first year of service, at least four aircraft suffered from electrical system problems stemming from its lithium-ion batteries, resulting in the whole Dreamliner fleet being voluntarily grounded in January 2013.|$|E
5|$|Reducing {{the partial}} {{pressure}} of the inert gas component of the breathing mixture will accelerate decompression as the concentration gradient will be greater for a given depth. This is achieved by increasing the fraction of oxygen in the breathing gas used, whereas substitution of a different inert gas will not produce the desired effect. Any substitution may introduce counter-diffusion complications, owing to differing rates of diffusion of the inert gases, {{which can lead to}} a net gain in total dissolved gas tension in a tissue. <b>This</b> <b>can</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> bubble formation and growth, with decompression sickness as a consequence. Partial pressure of oxygen is usually limited to 1.6 bar during in water decompression for scuba divers, but can be up to 1.9 bar in-water and 2.2 bar in the chamber when using the US Navy tables for surface decompression, and up to 2.8 bar for therapeutic decompression.|$|E

5|$|Welsh Springers can be {{prone to}} entropion, which is a {{disorder}} that affects the eyelids. The condition causes them to curl inwards, pressing the eyelashes against {{the surface of the}} eye itself and causing them to scratch it. <b>This</b> <b>can</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> irritation and damage to the cornea. In most cases it only affects the lower eyelid on one or both eyes, but in some cases the upper eyelid can be affected as well. Symptoms can include tearing, squinting, the rubbing of the eyes, thick discharge from the eyes and rolling of the eyelid along with wetness on the hairs next to the eyelids. There is no medical treatment for entropion, and surgical correction may be necessary depending on the severity of the case. This condition may be present soon after birth, or later in life as a secondary condition to other eye related diseases or infections. Other breeds also affected by the condition include the Chow Chow, Great Dane, Golden Retriever and the English Springer Spaniel.|$|E
5|$|With {{the advent}} of printing, poets gained greater control over the mass-produced visual presentations of their work. Visual {{elements}} have become {{an important part of}} the poet's toolbox, and many poets have sought to use visual presentation for a wide range of purposes. Some Modernist poets have made the placement of individual lines or groups of lines on the page an integral part of the poem's composition. At times, this complements the poem's rhythm through visual caesuras of various lengths, or creates juxtapositions so as to accentuate meaning, ambiguity or irony, or simply to create an aesthetically pleasing form. In its most extreme form, <b>this</b> <b>can</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> concrete poetry or asemic writing.|$|E
