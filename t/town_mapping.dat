40|$|Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) {{has been}} widely used as tool for remote sensing since 1950 ’s. It can be applied in ocean monitoring, mining, earth surface classification, <b>town</b> <b>mapping</b> and etc. It uses {{microwave}} signal as sensing medium to obtain information of the target by analyzing the return signal from the targets. Typically, the SAR system is carried by an airborne vehicle which flies through a scan area during which the SAR antenna will radiate microwave signal to the targets and direct the received echo to the RF receiver. In this project, the SAR system is carried by an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). Hence the choice of antenna is important where weight, space, radiation pattern and wind resistance plays {{an important part in}} the antenna design. Common airborne SAR systems adopt sidelooking scan method where the antenna elevation main beam is steered to either left or right hand side of the airborne. The easiest way to achieve sidelooking scan is by tilting the antenna position mechanically. However, this introduces complex tilting mechanism on the UAV with additional cost...|$|E
