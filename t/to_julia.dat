5|$|Julia {{found out}} that she was {{pregnant}} in January 1940. John Winston Lennon was born on 9 October 1940, on the second-floor ward of the Oxford Street Maternity Hospital in Liverpool, supposedly during a German air raid in World War II, although it has been confirmed there was no air raid on this date. Alf first saw his son that November when he returned from working as a merchant seaman on troop transports during World War II. He sent regular pay cheques <b>to</b> <b>Julia,</b> who lived with her son at 9 Newcastle Road (the Stanley family's home). He occasionally went back to Liverpool, but did not stay long before he was sent off on another ship. The cheques <b>to</b> <b>Julia</b> stopped when he went absent without leave in 1943. Neither Julia nor the Merchant Navy knew of his whereabouts. Julia only found out because she stopped receiving her allowance money, and the Navy wrote to her to inform her that they were looking for him.|$|E

5|$|Brown {{was born}} on 13 October 1926 in Hattiesburg, Mississippi.

He had four brothers, Marvin, William, Fletcher, and Lura, {{as well as an}} older sister known as Johnny. Brown's ancestry was African American, Chicksaw, and Choctaw. The family lived in a house without central heating or indoor plumbing so they relied on a fireplace for warmth. As a child, Jesse's brother William fell into this fireplace and was severely burned.|$|E

5|$|Alice {{was born}} in the Tapestry Room at Windsor Castle in Berkshire in the {{presence}} of her great-grandmother, Queen Victoria. She was the eldest child of Prince Louis of Battenberg and his wife Princess Victoria of Hesse and by Rhine. Her mother was the eldest daughter of Princess Alice, Grand Duchess of Hesse, the second daughter of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert. Her father was the eldest son of Prince Alexander of Hesse and by Rhine through his morganatic marriage <b>to</b> <b>Julia</b> von Hauke, Princess of Battenberg. Her three younger siblings, Louise, George, and Louis, later became Queen of Sweden, 2nd Marquess of Milford Haven, and Earl Mountbatten of Burma, respectively.|$|E
5|$|The Acors Barns House {{has gone}} through several owners over its lifetime. In 1862, the house passed from Acors Barns to his son William H. Barns. In 1893, the second son, Charles Barns {{acquired}} the title {{to the house and}} transferred it upon his death to Harriet Barns Vincent, the daughter of his sister. Harriet Barns Vincent sold the house <b>to</b> <b>Julia</b> O'Sullivan in 1919. Francis McGuire purchased the house in 1956 and it would later pass to James McGuire. In 2013, James McGuire sold the house to the Community Foundation of Eastern Connecticut for $325,000. The foundation stated it would continue to preserve the house's historical integrity.|$|E
5|$|The other {{significant}} theory {{about the origin}} of the legend, proposed by Robert Chambers in 1864, is that a genuine child was born in the early 17th century with facial deformities resembling a pig's face and a speech impediment causing her to grunt. The science of teratology (the study of birth defects and physiological abnormalities) was then in its infancy, and the theory of maternal impression (that the thoughts of a pregnant woman could influence the future appearance of her children) was widely accepted. It is possible that the birth of a genuinely deformed child led to the story of the beggar as a possible explanation for her appearance, with other elements of the story being later additions or distortions by publishers. Chambers speculates that the original child may have had a similar appearance <b>to</b> <b>Julia</b> Pastrana, a woman with hypertrichosis and distorted (although not pig-like) facial features, who was widely exhibited in Europe and North America until her death in 1860, and then, embalmed, until the 1970s. However, while a 1952 stillbirth with a face resembling a pig is documented, {{there has never been a}} reliably documented case of a human with deformities of this kind surviving outside the womb, while all versions of the pig-faced woman legend describe her as a healthy adult.|$|E

60|$|At Babington {{opinion was}} {{somewhat}} divided. Aunt Polly and Julia were of course certain that John Caldigate had married {{the woman in}} Australia. But the two other girls and their father were not at all so sure. Indeed, {{there had been a}} little misunderstanding among the Babingtons on the subject, which was perhaps strengthened by the fact that Mr. Smirkie had more endeared himself <b>to</b> <b>Julia's</b> mother than <b>to</b> <b>Julia's</b> father or sisters, and that Mr. Smirkie himself was very clear as to the criminality of the bigamist. 'I suppose you are often there,' Mr. Babington said to his guest, the parson of Utterden.|$|R
5|$|Victor {{arrived in}} Genoa City, Wisconsin for business, and he {{eventually}} formed his own worldwide conglomerate, Newman Enterprises. After {{his first marriage}} <b>to</b> <b>Julia</b> Newman (Meg Bennett), he formed a romance with stripper Nikki Reed (Melody Thomas Scott). Their union developed into a supercouple pairing, which has lasted over three decades. He shares two children with Nikki, Victoria (Amelia Heinle) and Nicholas Newman (Joshua Morrow). During his first marriage to her, he cheated with Ashley Abbott (Eileen Davidson). He has also had a long-standing romantic history with Ashley, and they share a child together, Abby Newman (Melissa Ordway). He was briefly married to a woman named Hope Wilson (Signy Coleman) {{and they had a}} son together, Adam Newman (Justin Hartley), who grew up without knowledge of Victor being his father. He is also known for his long-standing business rivalry with Jack Abbott (Peter Bergman). Victor has had several other romantic relationships, including one with his former daughter-in-law Sharon Newman (Sharon Case), which was poorly received by the actors and public.|$|E
