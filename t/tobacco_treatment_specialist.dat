In the QUIT-PRIMO study, an online referral portal will allow providers to enter smokers' email addresses into the system. Upon returning home, the smokers will receive automated emails providing education about tobacco cessation and encouragement {{to use the}} patient smoking cessation website (with interactive tools, educational resources, motivational email messages, secure messaging with a <b>tobacco</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>specialist,</b> and online support group). Methods The informatics system will be evaluated in a comparative effectiveness trial of 160 community-based primary care practices, cluster-randomized at the practice level. In the QUIT-PRIMO intervention, patients will be provided a paper information-prescription referral and then "e-referred" to the system. In the comparison group, patients will receive only the paper-based information-prescription referral with the website address. Once patients go to the website, they are subsequently randomized within practices to either a standard patient smoking cessation website or an augmented version with access to a <b>tobacco</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>specialist</b> online, motivational emails, and an online support group. We will compare intervention and control practice participation (referral rates) and patient participation (proportion referred who go to the website). We will then compare {{the effectiveness of the}} standard and augmented patient websites.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Effective web-assisted tobacco {{interventions}} (WATIs) {{have been}} underutilized by smokers; moreover, despite practice guideline recommendations, clinical teams do not routinely refer smokers to WATIs. Our {{goal was to}} test a clinical practice innovation, an ePortal designed to change practice and patient behavior. Our hypotheses were that the integrated system would result in increased smoker referrals, with an automated follow-up system resulting in more smoker registrations and finally augmentations of the WATI would result in more smokers quitting at 6 months. METHODS: Practice ePortal Implementation Trial: Practices (n = 174) were randomized to an online practice ePortal with an 2 ̆ 2 e-referral tool 2 ̆ 2 to the WATI (e-referred smokers received automated email reminders from the practice) and with practice feedback reports with patient tracking and practice-to-patient secure messaging versus comparison (a paper 2 ̆ 2 referral prescription 2 ̆ 2). Implementation success {{was measured by the}} number of smokers referred and smokers registering. Clinical Effectiveness Trial: To estimate the effectiveness of the WATI components on 6 -month smoking cessation, registered smokers were randomized into three groups: a state-of-the-art tailored WATI control [control], the WATI enhanced with proactive, pushed tailored email motivational messaging (messaging), and the WATI with messaging further enhanced with personal secure messaging with a <b>tobacco</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>specialist</b> and an online support group (personalized). RESULTS: Practice ePortal Trial results: A total of 4789 smokers were referred. The mean smokers referred per practice was not statistically different by group (ePortal 24. 89 (SD 22. 29) versus comparison 30. 15 (SD 25. 45), p = 0. 15).

40|$|Abstract Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this project was to {{evaluate}} outcomes of an existing inpatient tobacco cessation counseling program with 30 -day follow-up among recently admitted tobacco-dependent patients who were tobacco-dependent. Background/Significance: Tobacco use is considered the number one most preventable cause of disease, disability, and death in the United States. Despite associated dangers, approximately 21 % Americans currently smoke. This has led to increased hospital admissions and chronic disease management, costing the United States approximately $ 96 billion per year. Decades of research and evidence-based clinical practice guidelines substantiate that inpatient tobacco cessation counseling {{has the potential to}} improve quit rates post-hospital discharge. Method: This quality improvement project utilized existing hospital data containing demographic and medical information about patients and tobacco use behaviors. The goal was to answer the question: Does the provision of a tobacco cessation program initiated during hospitalization for persons who are tobacco-dependent (a) increase quit attempts or (b) reduce tobacco consumption? The electronic medical record was queried for data related to: demographics, insurance type, and diagnosis. Data related to smoking status and the intervention was extracted from a paper chart maintained by the certified <b>tobacco</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>specialist.</b> Results: Out of 176 tobacco-dependent patients admitted to the hospital, 100 (57 %) indicated an intention to quit (at admission time) while only 40 (23 %) reported having quit within 30 days post discharge (McNemar Test, p= 0. 000, n= 176). The mean number of cigarettes smoked per day dropped from 19 cigarettes on admission to 13 cigarettes post discharge. [t (158) = 6. 7476, p= 0. 000]. Conclusions: This quality improvement project showed that although an inpatient smoking cessation program did not improve quit rates, it did significantly improve reduction in tobacco consumption...|$|E
40|$|I didn’t {{arrive in}} Public Health through {{conventional}} means. My {{father is a}} physician and I grew up thinking medicine was in my future. Towards {{the end of my}} undergrad I started to learn about other careers and eventually came across Public Health. I saw the importance of helping avoid problematic health issues in our community through early intervention. My Public Health training when combined with my background in Biology opened new doors I never knew existed. Grad School gave me the opportunity to have involvement with different community health initiatives in Baptist Congregational Health, UM Docs Program, and as well as Miami-Dade Area Health Education Center. Through these experiences a disturbing trend was becoming apparent. A lack of meaningful intervention. People were in many cases completely unaware of services available to them in order to take better care of themselves. Tobacco {{is the leading cause of}} preventable death in the United States. Car Accidents, Gun Violence, infections, illicit drug use, and STDs combined do not reach the number of deaths caused by tobacco use. I saw a problem and wanted to do something about it. I began training with the Florida Certification Board and became a Certified <b>Tobacco</b> <b>Treatment</b> <b>Specialist.</b> The amount of people I have been able to help quit smoking easily has changed hundreds if not thousands of lives.

40|$|Chuck Rowland, MSN, CRNP, {{first came}} to Jefferson in 1986 as a newly {{graduated}} clinical perfusionist. Over the next 25 years, he worked in several states and returned to Jefferson as a perfusionist before pursuing a career in nursing. In 2007, he completed his BSN in Villanova University’s accelerated nursing program and continued his studies to earn his MSN as an Adult Nurse Practitioner in 2010. Since April 2011, Rowland has been supporting Jefferson’s Division of Cardiothoracic Surgery as an outpatient nurse practitioner. More recently, he assumed additional responsibilities {{as director of the}} Smoking Cessation, Counseling and Therapy (SCCT) Program, for which he became a Certified <b>Tobacco</b> <b>Treatment</b> <b>Specialist.</b> What is the SCCT Program? The SCCT Program is a relatively new endeavor that began with the progressive ideas and support of Scott Cowan, MD, FACS, one of our thoracic surgeons. The program’s goal is to jumpstart smoking cessation prior to surgery. During the appointment process, we screen all patients for smoking. If the patient agrees, we schedule him or her for a separate appointment for smoking cessation planning. We’ve designed the SCCT Program to provide one-on-one counseling tailored to individual patient needs. Each smoking cessation plan of care is formulated with patient input. For most patients, the goal is to quit smoking over a period of a few weeks – and then sustain that success over the long term. What is your philosophy of patient care? Patients are multidimensional. When they come to us with physical issues, they also bring social, cultural and spiritual dimensions. I believe it’s important to formulate a plan of care that incorporates and adapts to these needs. What most energizes you about your career? I’m energized by the ability to help patients navigate through their journey with cardiothoracic surgery and/or smoking cessation, which for most is a very stressful time. I always strive to help patients and their families truly understand what’s happening – from admission through final discharge and even weeks after surgery.

40|$|Objective: Global {{tobacco control}} efforts in both {{prevention}} and treatment have advanced to levels never imagined 20 years ago. This review examines the relationship between mental illness and tobacco use, with particular focus {{on the role of}} psychiatrists in the <b>treatment</b> of <b>tobacco</b> dependence. Methods: The literature search utilised MEDLINE, Embase and PsychINFO databases using the terms psychiatry, psychiatrist, smoking cessation, tobacco use disorder and <b>tobacco</b> dependence <b>treatment.</b> A manual search of all references from relevant scientific articles obtained was also conducted. Finally, further material sourced included all major guidelines for smoking cessation or <b>tobacco</b> dependence <b>treatment</b> from the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. Results: Psychiatry has ignored tobacco dependence and its treatment resulting in multiple missed opportunities in improving {{the health and well-being of}} smokers with mental illness. Improvement in the training and knowledge of psychiatrists and those in the mental health sector will be the most effective activity to rectify this situation. Conclusion: Psychiatry must recognise tobacco dependence as equally important as the primary mental illness and to treat accordingly. A significant change in the training of future psychiatrists, introducing or implementing smoke free mental health services, changes in the management of caring for the mentally ill, and the introduction of <b>tobacco</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>specialists</b> within the mental health system is needed if psychiatry is serious about confronting this problem...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{describe}} the research conducted to structure {{and develop a}} statewide tobacco training and certification programme for <b>tobacco</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>specialists</b> (TTSs) in Massachusetts. DESIGN: Qualitative research strategies were used to obtain information on certification development and opinions regarding TTS training and certification from key informants. A role definition and validation study was then conducted to determine the core competencies for TTSs. A comprehensive training programme was developed, piloted, and finalised, and a certification programme was initiated. PARTICIPANTS: Key informants included: individuals involved {{in the development of}} their professional certification programmes; <b>tobacco</b> <b>treatment</b> providers from across Massachusetts; and national <b>tobacco</b> <b>treatment</b> experts. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Participants 2 ̆ 7 opinions about the need for and structure of a training and certification programme for individuals specialising in the provision of moderate to intensive tobacco treatment; delineation of core competencies for TTSs, using the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (now the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality) clinical practice guideline as a foundation for the development of evidence based standards of practice for the treatment of nicotine dependence. RESULTS: The data support a comprehensive training and certification programme for TTSs in Massachusetts. Main concerns include the cost of obtaining certification, the potential to exclude uncertified healthcare professionals from delivering basic <b>tobacco</b> <b>treatment,</b> {{and the role of the}} TTS in the healthcare delivery system and the community. The training programme developed for Massachusetts was piloted, and the structure of a statewide training and certification programme for TTSs was finalised. CONCLUSIONS: The research provides support for the need and acceptance of a training and certification programme for TTSs in Massachusetts, and presents the challenges to be addressed. We demonstrated the feasibility of developing and implementing an evidence based training programme, and of initiating a statewide certification programme in Massachusetts.

40|$|The Department of Surgery’s Smoking Cessation, Counseling 2 ̆ 6 Therapy (SCCT) Program offers evidencebased {{strategies}} for quitting smoking, including one-on-one counseling, nicotine replacement therapy and prescription medication, such as Chantix and Wellbutrin, to reduce cravings and lessen withdrawal symptoms. Although the program {{started as a}} resource for patients preparing for cardiac or thoracic surgery, it is now available to many more patients—and nurse practitioners Chuck Rowland, MSN, CRNP, CTTS, and Sung Whang, MSN, CRNP, CTTS, are eager to spread the word. Chuck and Sung are both Certified <b>Tobacco</b> <b>Treatment</b> <b>Specialists</b> (CTTS). They each completed an intensive 40 -hour course offered by the Tobacco Dependence Program at Rutgers University. This particular program is one of a select group of training programs nationally accredited by the Association for the <b>Treatment</b> of <b>Tobacco</b> Use and Dependence. Chuck started the training in 2011 and helped the Department launch the program at Jefferson in 2012 on the suggestion of thoracic surgeon Scott W. Cowan, MD, FACS. Sung earned the certification shortly after joining Jefferson in 2013. “It’s never a good idea to be actively smoking when you’re scheduled for surgery,” Chuck explains. “While some time-sensitive operations must be performed regardless of tobacco use, quitting two to three weeks before surgery is strongly encouraged for most operations. Some of our surgeons even order a blood test to confirm no tobacco use. It is in the patient’s best interest. ” Indeed, the benefits of smoking cessation start quickly—with heart rate and blood pressure decreasing to near-normal levels within two hours of quitting and physical stamina improving in three weeks. Following the initial launch, the Department opened up the program to vascular surgery patients and then those with heart failure. Over time, the service has expanded and is now open to all Jefferson patients. For any patient, {{the first step in the}} six- to eight-week program is an approximately one-hour in-person consultation with Chuck or Sung. “We review the patient’s entire smoking history—when they started, how much they smoke, their daily routine, triggers, whether other smokers are living with them and past attempts at quitting,” Sung says. “Based on that information, we use motivational interviewing to come up with an individualized plan. That could include as many as three modalities, with a patient using nicotine patches and gum, as well as medication. ” Sung and Chuck follow up with patients in whatever manner is most convenient for the patient— whether in person, via phone or using the JeffConnect telehealth service. Beyond patient care, Chuck and Sung are beginning to collaborate on research with colleagues from the Jefferson Vascular Center, where the vast majority of patients are smokers. Though still in the early planning stage, the randomized study will likely compare patients who receive in-clinic smoking cessation counseling for 10 minutes or less with patients who are referred for the program’s more intensive counseling.

The Nicotine Dependence Program at the University of North Carolina has provided an inpatient <b>tobacco</b> <b>treatment</b> consult service since 2010. Objective: The program sought feedback from inpatient providers to examine factors that prompted <b>tobacco</b> <b>treatment</b> consult orders, the impact on provider counseling behavior, provider satisfaction, and suggested program improvements. Design: Providers who had ordered a <b>tobacco</b> <b>treatment</b> consult received an online anonymous survey. Setting: The University of North Carolina Hospital is an academic medical facility with 803 beds and over 37, 000 inpatient admissions annually from all 100 counties in North Carolina. Approximately 20 % of these inpatients report current use of any tobacco product. Patients/participants: Medical providers who ordered inpatient <b>tobacco</b> <b>treatment</b> consults from July 2012 to June 2013 (n= 265) received the survey, with 118 providers responding (44. 5 % response rate). Results: Almost all providers reported being satisfied with the consult program and believed it was effective.

40|$|Abstract 				 				 					 						Background 					Quitting smoking {{improves}} {{health and}} drug use outcomes among people in treatment for substance abuse. The twofold {{purpose of this study}} is to describe <b>tobacco</b> <b>treatment</b> provision across a representative sample of U. S. facilities and to use these data to develop the brief Index of <b>Tobacco</b> <b>Treatment</b> Quality (ITTQ). 				 				 					 						Methods 					We constructed survey items based on current <b>tobacco</b> <b>treatment</b> guidelines, existing surveys, expert input, and qualitative research. We administered the survey to a stratified sample of 405 facility administrators selected from all 3, 800 U. S. adult outpatient facilities listed in the SAMHSA Inventory of Substance Abuse Treatment Services. We constructed the ITTQ with a subset of 7 items that have the strongest clinical evidence for smoking cessation. 				 				 					 						Results 					Most facilities (87. 7 %) reported that a majority of their clients were asked if they smoke cigarettes. Nearly half of facilities (48. 6 %) reported that a majority of their smoking clients were advised to quit. Fewer (23. 3 %) reported that a majority of their smoking clients received <b>tobacco</b> <b>treatment</b> counseling and even fewer facilities (18. 3 %) reported a majority of their smoking clients were advised to use quit smoking medications. The median facility ITTQ score was 2. 57 (on a scale of 1 &# 8211; 5) and the ITTQ displayed good internal consistency (Cronbach&# 8217;s alpha&# 8201;=&# 8201;. 844).

40|$|This {{case study}} was {{conducted}} between 2000 and 2003 to examine the implementation of community based <b>tobacco</b> <b>treatment</b> programs funded by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health Tobacco Control Program (MTCP). Four dimensions of implementation, drawn from several models of program evaluation are explored: (a) quantity of services, (b) quality of services, (c) implementation/use of systems, and (d) sustainability. The quantity of services delivered was high, reflecting MTCP 2 ̆ 7 s focus on increasing availability of services, particularly in underserved populations. The quality of physician-delivered tobacco intervention did not meet national benchmarks for delivery of all 5 As (Ask, Advise, Assess, Assist, Arrange follow-up) and {{only about half of}} organizations reported routine systems for auditing tobacco use documentation. Implementation of systems to identify tobacco users and deliver <b>tobacco</b> <b>treatment</b> varied widely by community health settings, with low rates of tobacco use documentation found.

40|$|The {{majority}} of deaths due to tobacco {{in the twenty-first}} century will occur in the developing world, where over 80 % of current tobacco users live. In November 2010 guidelines were adopted for implementing Article 14 of the World Health Organization’s Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC). The guidelines call on all countries to promote <b>tobacco</b> <b>treatment</b> programs. Nevertheless, some experts argue for a strict focus, at least in developing countries, on population-based measures such as taxes and indoor air laws, which they consider more cost-effective than individual treatment. In this article we defend <b>tobacco</b> dependence <b>treatment</b> in developing countries. First, these experts understate the comparative cost-effectiveness of individual treatment programs. Second, they overlook numerous ethical considerations beyond cost-effectiveness that support individual <b>tobacco</b> <b>treatment</b> in developing countries. We conclude that the strict population-based focus in developing country tobacco control advocated by some experts is misplaced. In general, developing nations should combine population-based measures and individual <b>tobacco</b> <b>treatment</b> programs. Background More than 1. 3 billion people worldwide currently use tobacco, and over 5. 4 million deaths worldwide every year are directly attributable to tobacco use.

40|$|Abstract: The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the level of tobacco {{dependence}} education offered by Italian dental hygiene programs. A fifty-question survey was mailed to the thirty-one active public and private dental hygiene programs in Italy dur-ing the 2008 - 09 academic year. The survey assessed faculty confidence in teaching <b>tobacco</b> <b>treatment,</b> which courses contained tobacco dependence content, the number of minutes spent on specific content areas, and the level of clinical competence that dental hygiene graduates should be able to demonstrate. Surveys were returned by sixteen programs for a response rate of 52 percent. Respondents indicated tobacco dependence education was included in clinic or clinic seminar (56 percent), periodontics (44 percent), oral pathology (31 percent), and prevention (19 percent). All programs reported including the effects of tobacco on general and oral diseases in courses. However, more in-depth topics received less curriculum time; these included <b>tobacco</b> <b>treatment</b> strategies (63 percent) and discussion of cessation medications (31 percent). Interestingly, 62 percent of the respondents indicated they expected dental hygiene graduates to demonstrate a <b>tobacco</b> <b>treatment</b> competency level of a moderate intervention or higher (counseling, discussion of medications, follow-up) rather than a brief intervention in which patients are advised to quit then referred to a quitline. The results of this study indicated that Italian dental hygiene students are not currently receiving ad-equate instruction in <b>tobacco</b> <b>treatment</b> techniques nor are they being adequately assessed.

40|$|Introduction To {{report on}} the {{effectiveness}} of the ‘TiTAN Crete – <b>Tobacco</b> <b>Treatment</b> Training Network’ intervention program in influencing general practitioner’s (GP) knowledge, attitudes, self-efficacy and rates of 4 As (ask, advice, assist, arrange) <b>tobacco</b> dependence <b>treatment</b> delivery. Material and Methods A before-after evaluation design was used. The TiTAN Crete intervention included one core training and two booster sessions as well as the dissemination of practice and patient tools to support 4 As treatment into clinical routines among a sample of GPs on the islands of Crete in Greece (2015 - 2016). Participating GPs (n= 14), and a cross-sectional sample of patients from their practices (n= 984), were surveyed before-and-after the implementation of the intervention program. Multi-level modeling was used {{to examine the effects of}} the intervention. Results High rate of satisfaction were documented, with the majority of general practitioners indicating the training session met their expectations to a “great extent”. Significant increases were documented in six of the thirteen <b>tobacco</b> <b>treatment</b> knowledge areas assessed between the pre and post assessment. A significant increase in GPs self-efficacy was documented between the pre and post assessment (12. 5 % vs. 64. 3 %; p= 0. 016). Rates of delivery of the 4 As increased significantly following program implementation (ask: 58. 0 % vs. 82. 8 %, p= 0. 001; advise: 52. 5 % vs. 81. 5 %, p< 0. 001; Assist: 16. 1 % vs. 64. 8 %, p< 0. 001; Arrange: 4. 1 % vs. 15. 2 %, p= 0. 017) at the index visit. Conclusions The TiTAN Crete intervention was associated with significant increases in GP’s knowledge and attitudes regarding evidence-based <b>tobacco</b> dependence <b>treatment</b> as well as rates of <b>tobacco</b> <b>treatment</b> delivery.

40|$|Abstract Background Most smokers do {{not receive}} comprehensive, {{evidence-based}} <b>treatment</b> for <b>tobacco</b> use that includes intensive behavioral counseling along with pharmacotherapy. Further, the use of proven, <b>tobacco</b> <b>treatments</b> is lower among minorities than among Whites. The primary objectives {{of this study are}} to: (1) Assess the effect of a proactive care intervention (PRO) on population-level smoking abstinence rates (i. e., abstinence among all smokers including those who use and do not utilize treatment) and on utilization of <b>tobacco</b> <b>treatment</b> compared to reactive/usual care (UC) among a diverse population of smokers, (2) Compare the effect of PRO on population-level smoking abstinence rates and utilization of <b>tobacco</b> <b>treatments</b> between African American and White smokers, and (3) Determine the cost-effectiveness of the proactive care intervention. Methods/Design This prospective randomized controlled trial identifies a population-based sample of current smokers from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) electronic medical record health factor dataset. The proactive care intervention combines: (1) proactive outreach and (2) offer of choice of smoking cessation services (telephone or face-to-face). Proactive outreach includes mailed invitation materials followed by an outreach call that encourages smokers to seek treatment with choice of services. Proactive care participants who choose telephone care receive VA telephone counseling and access to pharmacotherapy. Proactive care participants who choose face-to-face care are referred to their VA facility's smoking cessation clinic. Usual care participants have access to standard smoking cessation services from their VA facility (e. g., pharmacotherapy, smoking cessation clinic) and from their state telephone quitline. Baseline data is collected from VA administrative databases and participant surveys. Outcomes from both groups are collected 12 months post-randomization from participant surveys and from VA administrative databases. The primary outcome is self-reported smoking abstinence, which is assessed at the population-level (i. e., among those who utilize {{and those who do not}} utilize <b>tobacco</b> <b>treatment).</b> Primary analyses will follow intention-to-treat methodology. Discussion This randomized trial is testing proactive outreach strategies offering choice of smoking cessation services, an innovation that if proven effective and cost-effective, will transform the way <b>tobacco</b> <b>treatment</b> is delivered. National dissemination of proactive treatment strategies could dramatically reduce tobacco-related morbidity, mortality, and health care costs.
