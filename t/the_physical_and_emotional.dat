Norwegian laws concerning occupational health have for several decades emphasized access to daylight and fresh air, and it may also be that harsh climatic conditions create an added imperative for uplifting aesthetics.|$|E

5|$|Portrait Diptych of Dürer's Parents (or Dürer's Parents with Rosaries) is the {{collective}} name for two late-15th century portrait panels by the German painter and printmaker Albrecht Dürer. They show the artist's parents, Barbara Holper (c. 1451–1514) and Albrecht Dürer the Elder (c. 1427–1502), {{when she was}} around 39 and he was 63 years. The portraits are unflinching records of <b>the</b> <b>physical</b> <b>and</b> <b>emotional</b> effects of ageing. The Dürer family was close and Dürer may have intended the panels either to display his skill to his parents or as keepsakes while he travelled soon after as a journeyman painter.|$|E

25|$|What {{industries}} children work in {{depends on}} if {{they grew up}} in a rural area or an urban area. Children who were born in urban areas often found themselves working for street vendors, washing cars, helping in construction sites, weaving clothing, and sometimes even working as exotic dancers. While children who grew up in rural areas would work on farms doing physical labour, working with animals, and selling crops. Of all the child workers, the most serious cases involved street children and trafficked children due to <b>the</b> <b>physical</b> <b>and</b> <b>emotional</b> abuse they endured by their employers. To address the issue of child labour, the United Nations Conventions on the Rights of the Child Act was implemented in 1959. Yet due to poverty, lack of education and ignorance, the legal actions were not/are not wholly enforced or accepted in Africa.|$|E
25|$|Masturbation among {{adolescents}} contributes to them developing {{a sense of}} mastery over sexual impulses, {{and it has a}} role in <b>the</b> <b>physical</b> <b>and</b> <b>emotional</b> development of prepubescents and pubescents. Babies and toddlers will play with their genitals {{in much the same way}} as they play with their ears or toes. If such play becomes all-consuming, it may be necessary to look for an underlying cause of this, such as the child being tense and in need of comfort, or that others may be overreacting and thus reinforcing the habit. It could be caused by a low-grade urinary tract or yeast infection, or the child may be overstimulated and in need of soothing, or indeed understimulated and bored. Alongside many other factors, such as medical evidence, age-inappropriate sexual knowledge, sexualized play or aggression, and precocious or seductive behavior, excessive masturbation may alternatively be an indicator of sexual abuse.|$|E

25|$|In England and Wales, sex {{education}} is not compulsory in schools as parents can refuse to let their children {{take part in the}} lessons. The curriculum focuses on the reproductive system, foetal development, and <b>the</b> <b>physical</b> <b>and</b> <b>emotional</b> changes of adolescence, while information about contraception and safe sex is discretionary and discussion about relationships is often neglected. Britain {{has one of the highest}} teenage pregnancy rates in Europe and {{sex education}} is a heated issue in government and media reports. In a 2000 study by the University of Brighton, many 14- to 15-year-olds reported disappointment with the content of sex education lessons and felt that lack of confidentiality prevents teenagers from asking teachers about contraception. However, in a 2008 study conducted by YouGov for Channel 4 it was revealed that only three in ten teenagers say they need more sex and relationships education. In most primary/junior schools, students are taught a (non-compulsory) formal sex education program from Upper Key Stage 2 (ages 10–11), and then onwards into secondary school, where it becomes a topic in the overall subject of Citizenship or PSHE (Personal Social Health Education). In March 2017 it was made complusory all schools have to teach sex education.|$|E

500|$|Wars lead single, [...] "New Year's Day", was {{released}} on 1 January 1983. It reached number 10 in the UK and became the group's first hit outside of Europe; in the US, it received extensive radio coverage and peaked at number 53. Resolving their doubts of the October period, U2 released War in February. Critically, the album received favourable reviews, although a few UK reviewers were critical of it. Nonetheless, it was the band's first commercial success, debuting at {{number one in the}} UK, while reaching number 12 in the US. Wars sincerity and [...] "rugged" [...] guitar were intentionally at odds with the trendier synthpop of the time. A record on which the band [...] "turned pacifism itself into a crusade", War was lyrically more political than their first two records, focusing on <b>the</b> <b>physical</b> <b>and</b> <b>emotional</b> effects of warfare. The album included the protest song [...] "Sunday Bloody Sunday", in which Bono lyrically tried to contrast the events of the 1972 Bloody Sunday shooting with Easter Sunday. Other songs from the record addressed topics such as nuclear proliferation ("Seconds") and the Polish Solidarity movement ("New Year's Day"). War was U2's first record to feature Corbijn's photography. The album cover depicted the same young child who had appeared on the cover of their debut album, albeit with his previously innocent expression replaced by a fearful one.|$|E

2500|$|In {{addition}} to physical disease, residents were warned of potential mental health problems. Parents {{were told to}} expect developmental regressions in child survivors of the flood, especially those who lost their homes. Even in adults, the stress of applying for services and managing daily activities under catastrophic conditions was expected to exacerbate pre-existing anxiety, depression, or family conflict. <b>The</b> <b>physical</b> <b>and</b> <b>emotional</b> stress of cleaning out flooded homes {{was only part of}} the trouble, as parents needed to manage all of this while still caring for children who were home on summer vacation. All of this was compounded by the summer heat & humidity, mosquitos and biting gnats, and the sheer number of people facing the same circumstances. Longterm consequences were possible as well. [...] "Once the original shock and dismay pass, the losses of such things as wedding photos or treasured family heirlooms can lead to depression and even post-traumatic stress disorder," [...] said one official.|$|E
2500|$|Rodríguez's {{and a body}} to {{remember}} with, {{a collection of short}} stories, has been described as an exploration of [...] "how hard it can be to re-root oneself" [...] during exile. The Spanish version of the book is entitled De cuerpo entero and was, like the English version, also published in 1997, though the works are subtly different; as Rodríguez seeks to evoke feelings in the reader that are relevant to each culture. This text explores life in exile, and how [...] "forgetting [...] is not an option". It delves into the difficulties an immigrant or displaced person experiences, whether they affect the person directly or indirectly. Rodríguez's book, in both languages, focuses on the experiences of migration and immigration of women, making sure to assess <b>the</b> <b>physical</b> <b>and</b> <b>emotional</b> adjustments that must be made, adding another woman's perspective and experience to the book through each narrative. The book's main characters are all women, and with each story Rodríguez's use of the body, [...] "the fullness of the body, its terrible fragmentation, or the body as a void" [...] is used to express the experiences of the characters. Rodríguez often purposely defragments the voices and bodies of her protagonists to give a sense of urgency.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the final}} {{months of his}} life, Rainivoninahitriniony is {{believed}} to have participated in an attempted coup against the administration of his brother and the queen. [...] On Friday, March 27, 1868, at two in the afternoon, a massive crowd armed with guns and swords attempted to storm the seat of government at the Rova of Antananarivo in the interest of exerting control over the succession of the queen, who had been growing ever weaker from dysentery since October 1867. [...] The leaders of the group successfully captured a number of key figures, including the head of the Queen's Guard. A group of guards, however, managed to escape and raced to notify Prime Minister Rainilaiarivony, who was visiting the countryside estate where Queen Rasoherina was convalescing. The Prime Minister gave the order to arrest the conspirators, several of whom were promptly captured upon the soldiers' return to the city. [...] At five in the evening, Rasoherina delivered a public address, asking those favorable to her rule to walk with her through the capital; a massive crowd paraded with her through the city, demonstrating their support for her continued authority. The queen then delivered a speech at Andohalo ordering the public to turn in any known conspirators to bring them to justice, before re-entering her residence at the Rova to reassure the public with her presence. However, the windows along the route to the Rova were reportedly all ordered shut, whether to protect the Queen from projectiles or to keep the nobles of the upper town from viewing the advanced state of her infirmity. <b>The</b> <b>physical</b> <b>and</b> <b>emotional</b> exertion further weakened the queen, who died four days later, on April 1, 1868.|$|E

We {{know quite}} clearly that {{civilisation}} is an artificial arrangement, {{and that all}} <b>the</b> <b>physical</b> <b>and</b> <b>emotional</b> instincts of man are too strong, and his natural instinct of restraint too weak, for him to live easily in the civilised State. Civilisation has developed far more rapidly than man has modified. Under the unnatural perfection of security, liberty and abundance our civilisation has attained, the normal untrained human being is disposed to excess in almost every direction; he tends to eat too much and too elaborately, to drink too much, to become lazy faster than his work can be reduced, to waste his interest upon displays, and to make love too much and too elaborately. He gets out of training, and concentrates upon egoistic or erotic broodings. The past history of our race is very largely a history of social collapses due to demoralisation by indulgences following security and abundance. In {{the time of our}} Founders the signs of a world-wide epoch of prosperity and relaxation were plentiful. Both sexes drifted towards sexual excesses, the men towards sentimental extravagances, imbecile devotions, and the complication and refinement of physical indulgences; the women towards those expansions and differentiations of feeling that find expression in music and costly and distinguished dress. Both sexes became unstable and promiscuous. The whole world seemed disposed to do exactly the same thing with its sexual interest as it had done with its appetite for food and drink--make the most of it." ...|$|E
