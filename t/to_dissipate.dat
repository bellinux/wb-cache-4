5|$|At night, {{the land}} cools off {{more quickly than}} the ocean because of {{differences}} in their specific heat values. This temperature change causes the daytime sea breeze <b>to</b> <b>dissipate.</b> When the temperature onshore cools below the temperature offshore, the pressure over the water will be {{lower than that of}} the land, establishing a land breeze, as long as an onshore wind is not strong enough to oppose it.|$|E
5|$|Bats may avoid flying {{during the}} day to prevent {{overheating}} in the sun, since their dark wing-membranes absorb solar radiation. Bats {{may not be able}} <b>to</b> <b>dissipate</b> heat if the ambient temperature is too high. Unlike birds which have air sacs or other mammals which have sweat glands, bats have no means to cool themselves by evaporation, though they may use saliva to cool themselves in an emergency.|$|E
5|$|Currently, it {{is unclear}} whether waves are an {{efficient}} heating mechanism. All waves except Alfvén waves have been found <b>to</b> <b>dissipate</b> or refract before reaching the corona. In addition, Alfvén waves do not easily dissipate in the corona. Current research focus has therefore shifted towards flare heating mechanisms.|$|E

The depression had difficulty organizing, and on October 9, it became so disorganized that advisories were discontinued.|$|E
5|$|The storm then {{continued}} north {{for twenty minutes}} over the North Shore suburbs of Sydney before regaining strength and veering northnorthwest again, redeveloping severe thunderstorm characteristics.

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave spawned Tropical Storm Dean on August 22 {{over the}} Lesser Antilles. Strong wind shear quickly weakened Dean to cause it <b>to</b> <b>dissipate</b> on August 23. The remnants turned northward, and redeveloped on August 26 {{to the north}} of Bermuda. Located over warm waters and in an area of favorable conditions, Dean steadily strengthened while moving to the northeast, and peaked just below hurricane status on August 27 southwest of Newfoundland. The storm subsequently weakened over cooler waters, and became extratropical on August 28. Tropical Storm Dean lightly affected Newfoundland, though no damages were reported.|$|E
5|$|Early on September 16 the JMA {{started to}} issue Typhoon force wind warnings, for the Naha, Okinawa; however these were {{discontinued}} later that day. The JMA then placed the Yokohama, Moji and Naha under a Typhoon Warning {{early the next}} day. These warnings were kept in place until early on September 19, when the JMA added the Kushiro and Otaru to the warnings. However, the warnings were dropped for all areas except Yokohama and Kushiro as the typhoon turned away from Japan. These warnings stayed in effect until late {{the next day when}} they were cancelled as Choi-wan began <b>to</b> <b>dissipate.</b>|$|E
5|$|On December6 the {{hurricane}} {{turned to the}} south and southwest. As it did so, Epsilon passed beneath a mid-level trough that sheltered it from the wind shear. After weakening during the evening, the convection redeveloped around the large and distinct eye in the daytime, a process Epsilon had done repeatedly in its duration. However, late on December7, an approaching trough began increasing wind shear over the system, displacing the convection from the center and causing the eye <b>to</b> <b>dissipate.</b> After maintaining hurricane status for five days, Epsilon weakened to tropical storm status about 920mi (1480km) southwest of the Azores.|$|E

50|$|Beni {{originated}} from the South Pacific region in late January and its remnants crossed into the Australian region by 1 February. Upon reaching the Coral Sea, {{the remnants of}} Beni slowly began to redevelop. After strong convective bands formed, Brisbane TCWC initiated gale warnings. Located offshore Queensland on 4 February, the remnants of Beni regenerated into a tropical cyclone. However, strong vertical wind shear caused Beni <b>to</b> <b>dissipated</b> on 5 February, while situated offshore of Queensland {{near the city of}} Mackay.|$|R
5|$|The 1905 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season featured five known tropical cyclones, {{two of which}} made landfall in the United States. The first system was initially observed near the Windward Islands on September6. The last system <b>to</b> <b>dissipate,</b> the fourth storm, transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on October11, while located well southeast of Newfoundland. These dates fall within the period with the most tropical cyclone activity in the Atlantic. Between October5 and October10, {{the fourth and fifth}} system existed simultaneously.|$|E
5|$|The 1990 Pacific {{hurricane}} season saw a then-record 16 hurricanes form. Throughout the year, 21tropical cyclones became named storms {{in the eastern}} Pacific Ocean. Hurricane Alma formed on May12, 1990, {{three days before the}} season's official start on May15. The Central Pacific {{hurricane season}} began on June1, covering tropical cyclone formation in the region between 140°W and International Dateline. Hurricane Trudy was the last storm <b>to</b> <b>dissipate,</b> doing so on November1, nearly a month before the Pacific hurricane season officially ended on November30.|$|E
5|$|The {{reason for}} the lack of landfalls is that {{tropical}} cyclones in the northern hemisphere usually travel to the west. In the Atlantic, this sends hurricanes towards North America. In the eastern Pacific, this sends tropical cyclones out into the open ocean <b>to</b> <b>dissipate</b> over waters too cool to support them or in environments with high wind shear. Hawaii, the only heavily populated island chain in the eastern Pacific, is protected from most hurricanes by a subtropical ridge and is small enough to avoid being hit simply due to low odds.|$|E

5|$|While Debby was {{crossing}} Saint Lucia, its strongest thunderstorms were located {{north and east}} of the center due to wind shear. A station in Martinique reported hurricane-force winds, and about 20,000people on the island lost power. After entering the eastern Caribbean Sea, Debby attained peak winds of , although continued wind shear caused the storm <b>to</b> <b>dissipate</b> on September11. In Puerto Rico, one person died due to high waves. The storm caused power outages and flooding in the Dominican Republic. Throughout its path, Debby killed nine people.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the remnant}} low {{associated}} with Josephine {{began to show}} signs of redevelopment during the afternoon on September7. Convection around the system increased significantly and the low was no longer exposed. On September8, wind shear took over the system again. Convection around the remnant low was torn away and the low was exposed once more. The National Hurricane Center did not state the chance of regeneration once the low became exposed. Finally, on September 9, wind shear and dry air led to the remnants of Josephine deteriorating into an open wave. However, on September10, the remnants of Josephine redeveloped and global models picked up on the reformed system. Once more, the chance of regeneration was possible as the remnants of Josephine headed towards the Bahamas. However, on September14, dry air and wind shear caused the remnants <b>to</b> <b>dissipate</b> entirely.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Cora was {{the first}} {{tropical}} cyclone of the 1978 Atlantic hurricane season to reach hurricane strength. Forming from a disturbance that exited the African coast on August 7, the storm moved at an unusually high forward speed for a cyclone in the Atlantic Ocean in August. The storm later reached hurricane strength and formed a well-defined eye that lasted only 12hours before the eye rapidly lost organization for unknown reasons, though the post-season report on the storm mentions the possibility that its high speed caused the eye <b>to</b> <b>dissipate.</b> The storm moved west-southwestward, weakening before making landfall {{on the island of}} Grenada. The storm lost its circulation and became a tropical wave on August 12. The remnant crossed over Central America into the Pacific Ocean, where it reintensified, becoming Hurricane Kristy.|$|E
30|$|For {{fractured}} reservoirs, fractures, especially high-angle opening fractures, {{not only}} represent transportation pathways for fluids but also provide additional hydrocarbon storage space. The degree of fracture development {{is therefore a}} very important factor for delineation of highly productive reservoirs. However, drilling and production operations indicate that shale gas is a special case. Where wells have penetrated zones of over-developed high-angle fractures (e.g., Jiaoye 3 well), the over-developed fracture is seen to result in poor preservation conditions, the shale gas is prone <b>to</b> <b>dissipating</b> along high-angle fracture or faults, thus reducing production performance.|$|R
40|$|This {{solidification}} {{process will be}} investigated {{in the framework of}} non-equilibrium fluctuation relations. For a given system driven far from equilibrium these relations state symmetries of the distribution of dissipated heat or mechanical work and ultimately relate to equilibrium free energy differences. The distribution of mechanical work, also experimentally accessible, contains important information about the evolution of crystallites and disorder in the system. Therefore, studying the distribution of mechanical work will offer new insights to the dynamical properties of the crystallization process and relate structural changes <b>to</b> <b>dissipated</b> energy far from equilibrium.|$|R
