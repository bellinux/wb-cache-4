5|$|The 2005Baylor {{game was}} played in Waco, Texas, {{approximately}} 100miles (161km) north on Interstate 35 from Austin. Since UT home games are usually sold out and Waco is relatively close to Austin, recent games against Baylor have attracted numerous Texas fans driving to Waco to see the game. The Baylor athletic department suspended ticket sales at onepoint in an effort <b>to</b> <b>limit</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of Longhorn fans who purchased tickets. The average attendance for Baylor's home games for the season was 38,899, but for the UT game the attendance was 44,783 still short of the 50,000official capacity for Baylor's Floyd Casey Stadium.|$|E

5|$|The non-denominational Society for Effecting the Abolition of the Slave Trade {{was founded}} in 1787. The next year Parliament passed the first law {{regulating}} the slave trade, <b>to</b> <b>limit</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of slaves per ship. Then in 1791, Parliament prohibited insurance companies from reimbursing ship owners in cases in which slaves were thrown overboard. The massacre has also inspired works of art and literature. It was commemorated in London in 2007, among events to mark the bicentenary of the British Slave Trade Act 1807, which abolished the African slave trade. A monument to the killed slaves on Zong was installed at Black River, Jamaica, their intended port.|$|E
5|$|As part of Strasburg's {{rehabilitation}} {{from his}} Tommy John surgery, {{and as a}} precaution due to his low innings total in 2011, the Nationals decided <b>to</b> <b>limit</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of innings Strasburg would throw in the 2012 season. Although the number was never official, rumors started that Strasburg's limit would be between 160 and 180 innings. It was also decided that Strasburg's shutdown would be final; he would not pitch in the playoffs. Dr. Lewis Yocum, the surgeon who operated on Strasburg's elbow, agreed in 2011 that Strasburg's 2012 innings total should be limited, {{although he did not}} consult with Nationals General Manager Mike Rizzo or Strasburg during the season. Teammate Jordan Zimmermann underwent a similar process the year before.|$|E
5|$|J. B. Haggin, an American breeder {{and owner}} of Elmendorf Farm, had begun to ship large contingents of horses to England for sale, {{including}} the 1908 Grand National steeplechase winner Rubio, and the fear was that if other American breeders followed his lead, the English racing market would be overwhelmed. As a first step, the English racing authorities began <b>to</b> <b>limit</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of training licences at Newmarket Racecourse, turning away a number of American breeders. The General Stud Book rules for registration were also amended in 1909 to restrict registration to horses whose ancestry entirely traced to horses already registered in the General Stud Book, but horses registered in other national stud books were still allowed to be imported and registered.|$|E

5|$|UNESCO {{identified}} three {{specific areas of}} concern under {{the present state of}} conservation: (i) vandalism by visitors; (ii) soil erosion in the south-eastern part of the site; and (iii) analysis and restoration of missing elements. The soft soil, the numerous earthquakes and heavy rains lead to the destabilization of the structure. Earthquakes are by far the most important contributing factors, since not only do stones fall down and arches crumble, but the earth itself can move in waves, further destroying the structure. The increasing popularity of the stupa brings in many visitors, most of whom are from Indonesia. Despite warning signs on all levels not to touch anything, the regular transmission of warnings over loudspeakers and the presence of guards, vandalism on reliefs and statues is a common occurrence and problem, leading to further deterioration. As of 2009, there is no system in place <b>to</b> <b>limit</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of visitors allowed per day or to introduce mandatory guided tours only.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of Burger King's actions, Hungry Jack's owner Jack Cowin and his private holding company Competitive Foods Australia began legal {{proceedings}} in 2001 against Burger King's parent Burger King Corporation with a counter-claim {{that the company had}} violated the conditions of the master franchising agreement and was in breach of the contract. In a decision handed down by the Supreme Court of New South Wales that affirmed Cowin's claims, Burger King was determined to have violated the terms of the contract and as a result was required to pay Cowin and Hungry Jack's a $46.9million (Aus, $41.6million USD 2001) award. The court's decision {{was one of the first}} major cases in Australia that implied that the American legal concept of good faith negotiations existed with the framework of the Australian legal system, which until that verdict, had rarely been seen in the country's courts. In its decision, the Court stated that Burger King had failed to act in good faith during contract negotiations by seeking to include standards and clauses that would engineer a default of the franchise agreement, allowing the company <b>to</b> <b>limit</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of new Hungry Jack’s branded restaurants and ultimately claim the Australian market as its own, a purpose that was extraneous to the agreement.|$|E
5|$|During the Song dynasty {{there was}} also great amount of {{attention}} given to the building of efficient automotive vessels known as paddle wheel craft. The latter had been known in China perhaps since the 5th century, and certainly by the Tang dynasty in 784 with the successful paddle wheel warship design of Li Gao. In 1134 the Deputy Transport Commissioner of Zhejiang, Wu Ge, had paddle wheel warships constructed {{with a total of}} nine wheels and others with thirteen wheels. However, there were paddle wheel ships in the Song that were so large that 12 wheels were featured {{on each side of the}} vessel. In 1135 the famous general Yue Fei (1103–1142) ambushed a force of rebels under Yang Yao, entangling their paddle wheel craft by filling a lake with floating weeds and rotting logs, thus allowing them to board their ships and gain a strategic victory. In 1161, gunpowder bombs and paddle wheel crafts were used effectively by the Song Chinese at the Battle of Tangdao and the Battle of Caishi along the Yangtze River against the Jurchen Jin dynasty during the Jin–Song Wars. The Jurchen invasion, led by Wanyan Liang (the Prince of Hailing), failed to conquer the Southern Song. In 1183 the Nanjing naval commander Chen Tang was given a reward for constructing ninety paddle wheel craft and other warships. In 1176, Emperor Xiaozong of Song (r. 1162–1189) issued an imperial order to the Nanjing official Guo Gang (who desired to convert damaged paddle wheel craft into junk ships and galleys) not <b>to</b> <b>limit</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of paddle wheel craft in the navy's dockyards, since he had high esteem for the fast assault craft that won the Chinese victory at Caishi. However, paddle wheel craft found other uses besides effective assaults in warfare. The Arab or Persian Commissioner of Merchant Shipping for Quanzhou, the Muslim Pu Shougeng (who served from 1250 to 1275) noted that paddle wheel ships were also used by the Chinese as tugboats for towing.|$|E

25|$|Computer games {{sometimes}} use DRM technologies <b>to</b> <b>limit</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> {{of systems}} the game {{can be installed}} on by requiring authentication with an online server. Most games with this restriction allow three or five installs, although some allow an installation to be 'recovered' when the game is uninstalled. This not only limits users who have more than three or five computers in their homes (seeing as {{the rights of the}} software developers allow them <b>to</b> <b>limit</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of installations), but can also prove to be a problem if the user has to unexpectedly perform certain tasks like upgrading operating systems or reformatting the computer's hard drive, tasks which, depending on how the DRM is implemented, count a game's subsequent reinstall as a new installation, making the game potentially unusable after a certain period even if it is only used on a single computer.|$|E

25|$|The {{society in}} which Christianity {{expanded}} was one in which abortion, infanticide and exposition were commonly used <b>to</b> <b>limit</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of children (especially girls) that a family had to support.

30|$|A way to formalize {{this process}} {{would be to}} ask, first, whether the {{particular}} crossing under consideration may be closed or consolidated with neighboring crossings. This is an important decision because a crossing closure may be helpful <b>to</b> <b>limiting</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> of automobile exposures but is nearly ineffective in limiting pedestrian exposures. Unless additional treatments to prevent pedestrian use are done, pedestrians would likely continue to cross where they always have, except now as trespassers. Once such considerations have been resolved, then the process would continue by examining the cost of various safety treatment options available versus the expected benefits.|$|R
