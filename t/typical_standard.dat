25|$|In the 1830s, the Deane {{brothers}} asked Augustus Siebe {{to improve}} their underwater helmet design. Expanding on improvements already made by another engineer, George Edwards, Siebe produced his own design; a helmet fitted to a full length watertight canvas diving suit. Siebe introduced various modifications on his diving dress design to accommodate {{the requirements of the}} salvage team on the wreck of the HMS Royal George, including making the bonnet of the helmet detachable from the corselet. His improved design gave rise to the <b>typical</b> <b>standard</b> diving dress which revolutionised underwater civil engineering, underwater salvage, commercial diving and naval diving.|$|E

2500|$|Similarly, the {{intensity}} of the output on TV and computer display devices is not directly proportional to the R, G, and B applied electric signals (or file data values which drive them through Digital-to-Analog Converters). On a <b>typical</b> <b>standard</b> 2.2-gamma CRT display, an input intensity RGB value of (0.5,0.5,0.5) only outputs about 22% of full brightness (1.0,1.0,1.0), instead of 50%. To obtain the correct response, a gamma correction is used in encoding the image data, and possibly further corrections as part of the color calibration process of the device. Gamma affects black-and-white TV as well as color. In standard color TV, broadcast signals are [...] gamma corrected.|$|E

Previous research works have been successful in bringing together and developing a comprehensive set of state-of-the-art innovations that could be potentially valuable for Public Transport Authorities and Operators in covering mobility needs.|$|R
50|$|ODABA is a terminology-oriented {{database}} management system, {{which is a}} conceptual extension of an object-oriented database system, and implements concepts defined in a terminology model. ODABA supports <b>typical</b> <b>standards</b> and technologies for object-oriented databases, but also terminology-oriented database extensions. ODABA also behaves like an object-relational {{database management}} system, i.e. data is seen as being stored in a database rather than accessing persistent objects in a programming environment. ODABA supports active data link (ADL) and provides an ADL-based GUI frame work.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{dynamic load}} {{strength}} test of automotive BIW {{is an important}} parameter for vehicle passive safety, but different test standards, different test requirements, which caused much trouble to the test authority. To solve the shortcomings of the traditional machines, such as low automation, poor universality and weak ability of data processing, this paper designs a new test machine for the dynamic load strength trials of automotive BIW {{on the basis of}} three <b>typical</b> <b>standards.</b> The test results indicated that this test machine embodies the characteristic of easy operation, stable function, and wide suitability, which improves the measurement accuracy and efficiency...|$|R

One of these, parameter uncertainty, has been largely ignored in the fisheries economics literature {{even though it is}} known elsewhere (e. g., macroeconomics) {{to play an important role}} in models with a similar structure. We model management of a renewable resource with unknown growth parameters and simulate estimation of the key parameters of the growth equation. Even with predictability high by <b>typical</b> <b>standards</b> and the true data generating process serving as the model, management of the fishery is problematic. A simple heuristic alternative making less intensive use of the data performs better...|$|R
