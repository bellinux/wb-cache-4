50|$|Recent {{investigations}} into apical dominance {{and the control}} of branching have revealed a new plant hormone family termed strigolactones.

5|$|BZP also {{acts as a}} non-selective {{serotonin}} {{receptor agonist}} {{on a wide variety}} of serotonin receptors; binding to 5HT2A receptors may explain its mild hallucinogenic effects at high doses, while partial agonist or antagonist effects at the 5HT2B receptors may explain some of BZPs peripheral side effects, as this receptor is expressed very densely in the gut, and binding to 5HT3 receptors may explain the common side effect of headaches, as this receptor is known <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> development of migraine headaches.|$|E

5|$|Genetics is {{believed}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> majority of cases, {{either directly or}} indirectly. Some epilepsies are due to a single gene defect (1–2%); most are due to the interaction of multiple genes and environmental factors. Each of the single gene defects is rare, with more than 200 in all described. Most genes involved affect ion channels, either directly or indirectly. These include genes for ion channels themselves, enzymes, GABA, and G protein-coupled receptors.|$|E
5|$|In 1879, Black {{and other}} {{citizens}} of Barbourville purchased stock {{to fund the}} start up of a new college in Barbourville. Black insisted that the college be named Union College, because he hoped the college would unify the community. He continued <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> development of the college, serving as its attorney and as a fund-raiser. Deeply interested in education, he also served as superintendent of the Knox County public schools in 1884 and 1885, but returned to his law practice thereafter.|$|E
5|$|Later, more {{specific}} similarities were discovered: for example, the Distal-less gene {{was found in}} 1989 <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> development of appendages or limbs in fruit flies, the fins of fish, the wings of chickens, the parapodia of marine annelid worms, the ampullae and siphons of tunicates, and the tube feet of sea urchins. It was evident that the gene must be ancient, {{dating back to the}} last common ancestor of bilateral animals (before the Ediacaran Period, which began some 635 million years ago). Evo-devo had started to uncover the ways that all animal bodies were built during development.|$|E

5|$|On {{the day of}} the abdication, the Oireachtas, the {{parliament}} of the Irish Free State, removed all direct mention of the monarch from the Irish constitution. The next day, it passed the External Relations Act, which gave the monarch limited authority (strictly on the advice of the government) to appoint diplomatic representatives for Ireland and <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> making of foreign treaties. The two acts made the Irish Free State a republic in essence without removing its links to the Commonwealth.|$|E
50|$|PISRT1 (polled {{intersex}} syndrome regulated transcript 1) is a {{long non-coding}} RNA. It has been implicated in the polled intersex (PIS) mutation in goats.

30|$|It {{was also}} found that drivers who were driving on roads with posted speed limits less than 55 mph were 12 % less likely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> severe crashes. In addition, drivers who <b>were</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> rainy weather {{condition}} crashes were 13 % more likely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> severe crashes. Finally, drivers who were driving {{in a rural area}} were 10 % more likely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> severe work zone weather-related crashes in comparison with those driving on urban roadways. This might <b>be</b> due <b>to</b> the fact that risky behaviors such as not wearing seatbelts are more common among rural drivers [43].|$|R
5|$|The 4Live Kru {{broke up}} {{as a result}} of Konnan's actions at Turning Point. This led to B.G.

5|$|The Brazilian Air Force sent five {{fixed-wing}} aircraft and three helicopters {{to the region}} for an extensive search and rescue (SAR) operation. As many as 200 personnel were reported <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> operation, among them a group of Kayapo {{people familiar with the}} forest. The crash site of Gol Flight 1907 was spotted on 30September by the BAF, at coordinates , 200km (120mi) east of Peixoto de Azevedo, near Fazenda Jarinã, a cattle ranch. It was reported that rescue personnel had difficulty reaching the crash site due to the dense forest.|$|E

5|$|After his graduation, Wai {{enlisted in}} the Hawaii National Guard and was called into active duty before the United States' {{entrance}} into World War II. He received a commission as an officer and completed Officer Candidate School in 1941. His commission was rare {{at a time when}} few Asian Americans were allowed to serve in combat leadership roles. He was eventually assigned to the 34th Infantry Regiment of the 24th Infantry Division with the rank of Captain. The 24th Division, based at Schofield Barracks, Oahu, was among the first American units <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Pacific Theater, exchanging fire with Japanese aircraft during the December 7, 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor.|$|E
5|$|As {{a player}} {{representative}} to the NHL Players Association since 1990, Linden was responsible for being the contact between his teammates and the NHLPA. He saw the experience as a chance <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> business side of the sport. In light of this service, Linden was elected President of the NHLPA in June 1998. Consequently, Linden was actively involved in negotiations with Gary Bettman and the NHL on a new CBA that ended the 2004–05 lockout. This included a final meeting in January 2005 between Linden and Harley Hotchkiss, {{the chairman of the}} NHL Board of Governors, in an attempt to avoid losing the NHL season. Despite this meeting, a result was not found in time to keep the NHL from cancelling the 2004–05 season.|$|E
