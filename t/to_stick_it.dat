5|$|The {{settlement}} at {{the mouth}} of the Plum River was established in 1827 when copper was discovered near the Mississippi River. When the Black Hawk War erupted in 1832, the settlement at Plum River consisted of 25 people. When the settlers were informed of Black Hawk's invasion they were undecided about whether or not to abandon their homes for safer grounds in Galena, Illinois. In the end, while nearby towns such as Hanover emptied of their residents, the citizens at Plum River decided to send the women and children to Galena and leave the men <b>to</b> <b>stick</b> <b>it</b> out on the frontier. They partially disassembled two of the settlement's homes and constructed a blockhouse for protection. Left to defend the impromptu fortifications were Aaron Pierce, Vance Davidson, Robert Upton, William Blundell, Leonard Goss and a man known as Hays. On May 19 another group of militia volunteers were ambushed at Buffalo Grove and two days later the more famous Indian Creek massacre occurred (on the same day as the raid at Plum River).|$|E
25|$|Mick Carter (Danny Dyer) visits Stan with Shirley Carter (Linda Henry) and Tina Carter (Luisa Bradshaw-White) {{as he is}} {{in desperate}} need of money. Stan forces Shirley, who he has been estranged from him the longest, to accept the money, and their angst is {{revealed}} to have started when Stan's drinking meant a young Mick and Tina went into care. Stan gives Shirley Deano's (Matt Di Angelo) mobile number, saying that he is now going by the name of Dean. A few weeks later, Shirley learns from her aunt Babe Smith (Annette Badland) that Dean has been staying with Stan. Shirley visits him, expecting to see Dean but Stan tells her that Dean went away a few days ago. A few weeks later, Mick receives news that Stan has been involved in an accident and broken his ankle. He visits him in hospital and Tina brings him to the pub, where they agree <b>to</b> <b>stick</b> <b>it</b> out for three weeks. After Mick's wife Linda Carter (Kellie Bright) forbids Stan to smoke in the house, he secretly smokes out of the window whilst the family is out, accidentally causing a small fire when the cigarette is not stubbed out properly. He is rescued by his great-grandson Lee Carter (Danny-Boy Hatchard) who {{the rest of the family}} believed was still serving in Afghanistan. It is revealed Lee has been staying with Stan for a week. After Mick believes Stan has been wetting the bed, a furious Stan demands to be taken back home. Whilst there, he is visited by Dean, who is in trouble with the law for handling stolen goods. When the police arrive, Stan takes the blame and is arrested. Mick later collects him and returns him to Walford.|$|E
500|$|The {{reaction}} in Britain to Wodehouse's broadcasts was hostile, {{and he was}} [...] "reviled... as a traitor, collaborator, Nazi propagandist, and a coward", although, Phelps observes, {{many of those who}} decried his actions had not heard the content of the programmes. A front page article in The Daily Mirror stated that Wodehouse [...] "lived luxuriously because Britain laughed with him, but when the laughter was out of his country's heart,... was not ready to share her suffering. He hadn't the guts... even <b>to</b> <b>stick</b> <b>it</b> out in the internment camp." [...] In the House of Commons Anthony Eden, the Foreign Secretary, regretted Wodehouse's actions. Several libraries removed Wodehouse novels from their shelves.|$|E

500|$|... "Here We Go Again" [...] {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics. The Arizona Republic Ed Masley referred it to as [...] "an explosion of pop hooks delivered {{with a winning}} blend of heartache and bravado". Kerri Mason of Billboard called the song a potential hit single and noted that Lovato [...] "almost sounds like Kelly Clarkson's kid sister". Margaret Wappler of Los Angeles Times compared it to Clarkson's [...] "Since U Been Gone" [...] and wrote that Lovato [...] "tells a guy where <b>to</b> <b>stick</b> <b>it</b> over buff guitar lines". Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic called the album [...] "not quite as much fun" [...] as Don't Forget, [...] "but still fun, particularly when Lovato tears into hooky power pop like 'Here We Go Again'." [...] Erlewine also named {{it one of the}} best tracks on the album. Chicago Tribune Althea Legaspi referred it to as [...] "anthemic" [...] and [...] "catchy", while Houston Chronicle critic Joey Guerra described it was not as [...] "immediate a grabber" [...] as Lovato's previous singles.|$|E
2500|$|As {{had been}} the case with both {{versions}} of the Wranglers, Phoenix-area fans largely viewed the Outlaws with indifference. For {{the second year in a}} row, attendance dropped -- from the 25,568 George Allen's Wranglers' drew the year before, to 17,881. [...] The crowds looked even smaller than that due to the spacious configuration of Sun Devil Stadium. [...] The Outlaws actually drew 4,000 fewer fans than they did in Tulsa, even though Sun Devil Stadium was almost double the size of Skelly Stadium. Despite this, the Tathams hoped <b>to</b> <b>stick</b> <b>it</b> out once the league won their lawsuit against the NFL.|$|E
2500|$|During the movie's {{production}} from June 2005 to July 2007, the filmmakers shot more than 250 hours of footage with exclusive, unprecedented access to Valentino and his entourage. [...] "We were let {{in to the}} inner circle, but we had <b>to</b> <b>stick</b> <b>it</b> out for a long time, practically move in, to capture the truly great moments", says Tyrnauer. [...] "Valentino {{is surrounded by a}} tight-knit family of friends and employees, but, eventually, their guard came down and they forgot there was a camera crew in the room." [...] The film had its North American premiere at the 2008 Toronto International Film Festival. It was released theatrically in the United States on 18 March in New York City and selected cities.|$|E

2500|$|The New Republic writer James Kirchick {{accused the}} network of [...] "often virulent anti-Americanism, worshipful {{portrayal}} of Russian leaders." [...] Edward Lucas wrote in The Economist (quoted in Al Jazeera English) that the core of RT was [...] "anti-Westernism." [...] Julia Ioffe wrote [...] "Often, it seemed that Russia Today was just a way <b>to</b> <b>stick</b> <b>it</b> to the U.S. from behind the fa√ßade of legitimate newsgathering." [...] Shaun Walker wrote in The Independent that RT [...] "has {{made a name for}} itself as a strident critic of US policy." [...] Allesandra Stanley wrote in The New York Times that RT is [...] "like the Voice of America, only with more money and a zesty anti-American slant." [...] David Weigel writes that RT goes further than merely creating distrust of the United States government, to saying, in effect: [...] "You can trust the Russians more than you can trust those bastards." ...|$|E
2500|$|Many African Americans, called Exodusters, {{escaped the}} Klan and racially discriminatory {{laws in the}} South by moving to large {{northern}} cities, {{as well as to}} places like Kansas where some formed all-black towns to have a greater level of freedom and autonomy. Douglass did not favor this, nor the Back-to-Africa movement, which he thought resembled the American Colonization Society he had fought in his youth. In 1892, at an Indianapolis conference convened by Bishop Henry McNeal Turner, Douglass spoke out against the separatist movements, urging blacks <b>to</b> <b>stick</b> <b>it</b> out. He made similar speeches as early as 1879, and was criticized both by fellow leaders and some audiences, who even booed him for this position. Speaking in Baltimore in 1894, Douglass said, [...] "I hope and trust all will come out right in the end, but the immediate future looks dark and troubled. I cannot shut my eyes to the ugly facts before me." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 1 May 2006 rescuers {{were still}} 12 metres from the miners. They were also later sent a digital camera, a torch, dry clothes, magazines, iPods {{including}} {{music from the}} Foo Fighters and Kevin Bloody Wilson (upon request), deodorant and toothpaste. They also received letters from their families, {{and were able to}} write letters in return. In one letter to his wife, Russell wrote [...] "It's not much of a room we have up here." [...] Russell asked for the previous Saturday's newspaper because he said he would be looking for a new job, after joking about losing his current one for lazing about. One mine official questioned why Russell would want to look for a job, since he already had one. Russell, in a later interview, said that he had replied, [...] "I told him <b>to</b> <b>stick</b> <b>it</b> up his..." [...] They were also sent medical supplies, with which Webb was able to treat the injuries to Russell's leg, with advice from paramedics. It was also on 1 May that the two men asked about Larry Knight, and rescuers told them that he had been found dead.|$|E

2500|$|Several critics {{compared}} The Clone Wars to a Saturday morning cartoon {{and described}} it {{as little more than}} a plug for the upcoming animated series. Linda Barnard, of the Toronto Star, said the movie [...] "pretty much drives a stake into the heart of every loyal fan of the movies. And now [...] out <b>to</b> <b>stick</b> <b>it</b> to those too young to know about Jar Jar Binks." [...] Variety magazine reviewer Todd McCarthy said, [...] "This isn't the Star Wars we've always known and at least sometimes loved." [...] Joe Neumiar, of the New York Daily News, wrote, [...] "If this were a true Star Wars film, right about now somebody would say, '...I've got a bad feeling about this.'" [...] In his review for Entertainment Weekly, critic Owen Gleiberman gave the film an F grade and wrote, [...] "George Lucas is turning into the enemy of fun." [...] Carrie Rickey, of The Philadelphia Inquirer, said, [...] "The best that can be said about the movie is that it's harmless and mostly charmless. The Clone Wars is to Star Wars what karaoke is to pop music." ...|$|E
2500|$|Major's {{verdict on}} the ERM {{was that it}} was the {{medicine}} that cured Britain of inflation; [...] "it hurt but it worked." [...] Speaking a few days after Black Wednesday, the Governor of the Bank of England, Robin Leigh-Pemberton, argued that [...] "the decision to join the ERM two years ago in the circumstances; that, having joined, we were right to endeavour <b>to</b> <b>stick</b> <b>it</b> out; and that, in the circumstances which evolved, we were right to withdraw." [...] Lamont's view expressed in his memoirs was more nuanced: without the discipline of the ERM, the Major government would have given up on the fight against inflation before Black Wednesday; ERM membership delivered a sharp break in Britain's inflation performance; the judgment of the markets that the higher rates needed to maintain Britain's membership was undoubtedly correct; [...] "the ERM was a tool that broke in my hands when it had accomplished all that it could usefully do." [...] Sir Alan Budd, the Treasury's Chief Economic Adviser during the period and later appointed by Gordon Brown to the Monetary Policy Committee, in an economic assessment of Britain's membership of the ERM, has written, [...] "although it was certainly a political disaster, the case can be made that it was an economic triumph and marked the turning point in our macro-economic performance." ...|$|E
