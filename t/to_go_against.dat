5|$|Meanwhile, Mr. Fisher finds {{employment}} as a pharmacist {{in a local}} drug store; but his boss, Mr. Primont (Gavin Gordon)—who reluctantly hired Mr. Fisher after his boss made him do so—constantly demeans Mr. Fisher obviously out of retaliation, much to Danny's embarrassment. That situation {{makes it easier for}} Danny <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>against</b> his father's wishes and accept Charlie's job offer. Danny does; and when he becomes a hit at the King Creole, Maxie tries to hire him. Danny declines his offer out of loyalty to Charlie.|$|E
5|$|The {{conditions}} of the MAP, however, stipulated that no Annual National Programme could be launched until 63 military facilities are transferred from Bosnia's political divisions to the central government, {{which is one of}} the conditions for the OHR closure. The leadership of the Republika Srpska has opposed this transfer as a loss of autonomy. Bosnia's chances of joining NATO may depend on Serbia's attitude towards the alliance, since the leadership of Republika Srpska might be reluctant <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>against</b> Serbian interests. In October 2017, the National Assembly of the Republika Srpska passed a nonbinding resolution opposing NATO membership for Bosnia and Herzegovina.|$|E
50|$|Iran and Iraq usually <b>go</b> <b>to</b> war <b>against</b> each other; Iran usually wins in the end, {{but this}} is always a {{protracted}} conflict with both sides trying {{to develop nuclear weapons}} — the war between Iran and Iraq is a source of game ends, where their exchange of nuclear weapons triggers a global holocaust. Egypt can sometimes decide <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> war <b>against</b> Israel, and Syria sooner or later always decides <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> war <b>against</b> Israel (although it will sometimes mop up Jordan and Lebanon first).|$|R

5|$|From the outset, Chamarro {{performed}} a delicate balancing act. Her choice {{to lead the}} Assembly, , {{was rejected by the}} UNO vote, which chose Myriam Arguello and Chamorro kept her word not <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>against</b> the vote. Her Vice President-elect Virgilio Godoy was in favor of hard-line policies to exclude the Sandinistas, but Chamorro retained Daniel Ortega's brother, Humberto Ortega, as a military leader, granting herself the position of Defense Minister and naming Humberto to second-in-command as the Chief of Staff. For this, Chamorro's critics accused her of supporting the Sandinistas, but it proved to be a valuable political move, as it demonstrated that, {{for the good of the}} nation, she was willing to compromise in ways that fostered reconciliation. She also appointed three FSLN cabinet members, including one for agrarian reform.|$|E
5|$|The parishes {{were grouped}} into deaneries called Varados. Every parish {{was divided into}} wards, while Parish Councils were present in most parishes. About 15 percent of the {{households}} in the parishes were literate. A widow had to remain indoors, practically {{for the rest of}} her life. Since high-caste Hindu widows cannot remarry after the death of their husbands, the high-caste Christians too considered the remarriage of a widow as something unnatural. Canon law did allow remarriage for widows and therefore there was no direct prohibition for widows to remarry in the society of the Christians of South Canara. Few women had the courage <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>against</b> the strict conventions of their community. A widow who remarried was looked down upon, pitied, and shunned as unlucky. But she was not ill-treated or made an outcast, and no stigma was attached to her husband. Succession to property was practised as per the Hindu laws.|$|E

25|$|After being {{informed}} of the revolt, King Cheng allegedly performed turtle shell divination {{in an attempt to}} determine whether or not to attack his uncles.

The king acknowledged this difficulty and disquietude, but refused <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>against</b> the apparent will of Heaven. Duke of Zhou, eager to regain the east, probably supported the king's decision.|$|E

25|$|On {{the night}} of 27 June 1994, the cult carried out a {{chemical}} weapons attack against civilians when they released sarin in the central Japanese city of Matsumoto, Nagano. With {{the help of a}} converted refrigerator truck, members of the cult released a cloud of sarin which floated near the homes of judges who were overseeing a lawsuit concerning a real-estate dispute which was predicted <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>against</b> the cult. This Matsumoto incident killed eight and harmed 500 more. Police investigations focused only on an innocent local resident, Yoshiyuki Kouno, and failed to implicate the cult at the time. It was only after the Tokyo subway attack that Aum Shinrikyo was discovered to be behind the Matsumoto sarin attack.|$|E
25|$|The {{conflict}} itself {{started when}} Russia considered Ypsilantis' deposition <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>against</b> {{the letter of}} the Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca and the Treaty of Jassy. While the Russian Count and Ambassador Arbuthnot prepared to leave Istanbul, The Porte convened to have the two Princes reinstated. Despite this, Russian troops under General Ivan Michelson and Count Mikhail Miloradovich entered the two Danubian Principalities (see Russo-Turkish War (1806–12)). Prince Ypsilantis had previously escaped to the Russian camp, and was briefly considered by his allies as ruler over both principalities (just before Russian occupation took over); the French Consul to Moldavia, Charles-Frédéric Reinhard, reportedly not informed of Sébastiani's contacts with Selim, was arrested by the Russian troops. As a major consequence of this chain of events, France pulled the strings of Ottoman foreign policy.|$|E
25|$|The Dutch had thus in fact {{imposed a}} pax neerlandica on the Baltic region. They leaned {{then to the}} Danes, then to the Swedes, but never forgot Dutch {{interests}} in the process. This was, of course, highly resented by all parties involved, not least the English, and also France, which now began to revive from its weak diplomatic position during the minority of Louis XIV of France and the subsequent ministry of Cardinal Mazarin. During the early 1660s English diplomats were highly successful in fomenting all kinds of trouble for the Dutch in Copenhagen and Stockholm. Denmark, in particular, seemed amenable to a reversal of alliances in the {{events leading up to}} the Second Anglo-Dutch War. However, when that war broke out, the Danes decided that they simply could not afford <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>against</b> Dutch wishes, and they again sided with the Republic by closing the Sound to English commerce.|$|E

25|$|Virginia Woolf {{is taking}} her walk while {{thinking}} of ideas for her novel. She already believes Clarissa Dalloway will commit suicide, now Virginia plans for Mrs.Dalloway {{to have had}} one true love: not her husband, but a girl Clarissa knew during her own girlhood. Her love of another girl will have represented {{a time when she}} was not afraid <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>against</b> the destiny laid out for her by society and family. Virginia plans for Clarissa to kill herself in middle-age over something quite trivial, a representation of what her life has become and what has been repressed. As Virginia walks about Richmond she reflects on how Mrs.Dalloway's deterioration in middle-age represents how Virginia feels about being trapped in suburban Richmond when she only feels fully alive in London. She is aware she is more susceptible to mental illness in London, but would rather die 'raving mad' in London than avoid life (and perhaps prolong her years) in Richmond.|$|E
25|$|As for {{the reasons}} of Castillo in staying neutral, there are several {{interpretation}}s. One interpretation focuses on the Argentine tradition of neutrality. Others see Castillo as a nationalist, not being influenced by the power structure in Buenos Aires (since he was from Catamarca), so, {{with the support of}} the army, he could simply defy the pressure to join the Allies. A similar perspective considers instead that Castillo simply had no power <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>against</b> the wishes of the army, and if he declared war he would be deposed in a military coup. A third interpretation considers that only the United States wanted Argentina to declare war, whereas the United Kingdom was benefited by Argentine neutrality because the country was able to supply the British with livestock. This interpretation, however, fails to acknowledge the constant requests to declare war from Anglophile factions. Most likely, it was a combination of the desires of the British diplomacy and the Argentine army, which prevailed over the pro-war factions.|$|E
25|$|Unknown to Beast, Belle writes him {{a special}} book which he doesn't see until later on. She also meets Forte {{later on in}} a chance meeting. Forte tells her that Beast's {{favorite}} Christmas tradition was the Christmas tree. Belle becomes frustrated, for no tree she has seen on the grounds has been tall enough to hang ornaments. Forte lies to Belle, saying that a perfect tree {{can be found in}} the woods beyond the castle. Reluctant <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>against</b> Beast's orders that she never leave the castle, Belle leaves nonetheless in order to find the perfect tree. When Belle does not arrive to see Beast's Christmas present to her, he begins to suspect that she isn't there at all. When Cogsworth, having been ordered to retrieve Belle, explains that the household cannot find her, Beast becomes enraged. He goes to Forte to ask for advice, and Forte lies that Belle has abandoned him. Beast manages to find Belle and saves her in time from drowning after she fell through thin ice.|$|E
