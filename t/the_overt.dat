As time dragged on, the Austrian U-3 and U-4 were still not ready, and eventually Admiral Anton Haus, the head of the Austrian Navy, reneged on his commitment because of <b>the</b> <b>overt</b> hostility from neighbor and former ally Italy.|$|E

5|$|President Nixon {{was more}} than willing to seize the {{advantage}} offered by the ousting of Sihanouk and the opportunity to strike the border sanctuaries as a means of buying time for both the U.S. and South Vietnam. On 29 April, the first bombings of Operation Patio took place. Like Menu, these tactical airstrikes were held in close secrecy. Although they were initially an anti-infiltration measure, they quickly expanded as targets deeper in Cambodia became the norm. The program was quickly superseded by Operation Freedom Deal, <b>the</b> <b>overt</b> support of FANK troops by B-52 and tactical airstrikes by American and South Vietnamese aircraft.|$|E
5|$|In Puranic literature, Sharabha is {{associated}} with god Shiva, who incarnates to subdue fierce manifestations of Vishnu. The legend of Sharabha fighting Narasimha - the man-lion form of Vishnu - brings to fore <b>the</b> <b>overt</b> rivalry between the devotees of Vishnu (Vaishnavite sect) and those of Shiva (Shaivite sect), which exposes the fierce debate aspect. According to Roy, the Narasimha-Sharabha encounter may be a Shiava version of Vedic tale of Vishnu piercing the boar. Shiva Purana describes Sharabha as thousand-armed, lion-faced and with matted hair, wings and eight feet. Sharabha Upanishad portrays Sharabha with two heads, two wings, eight legs of the lion with sharp claws and a long tail. Kalika Purana describes Sharabha as black in colour, with four feet downwards and four feet uplifted, with an enormous body. It also has a long face and nose, nails, eight legs, eight tusks, a cluster of manes, and a long tail. It jumps high repeatedly making a loud cry.|$|E

5|$|Lutyens {{was profoundly}} {{affected}} by the war and sought {{a new form of}} architecture to memorialise the Lost Generation. He generally preferred abstract designs for his war memorials, of which he designed dozens, over allegorical or figurative sculpture or <b>the</b> <b>overt</b> religious imagery that was present in many First World War memorials. Mells {{is one of the few}} monuments in which he used such allegory (in this case, the statue of Saint George). It is the most intricate of Lutyens' civic memorials to feature a statue of Saint George, though his memorial inside Wellington College's chapel features a similar sculpture of George and the Dragon. Fordham War Memorial in Cambridgeshire and Hove War Memorial in East Sussex both feature less intricate bronze statues of George with a sword and shield.|$|E
5|$|Lyons took on {{a number}} of causes in the 1910s and 1920s. He worked with Bishop David Greer and Rabbi Stephen Wise to expose {{conditions}} in New York's tenements, dissociated himself from Tammany Hall candidates, tried to secure a re-trial for Leo Frank, and opposed some of the views of Samuel Gompers. In 1912, Lyons was {{a founding member of the}} Eastern Council of Reform Rabbis, an organization of Reform rabbis from the Eastern United States that was created despite opposition from the Central Conference of Reform Rabbis. In 1919 he withdrew from the Brooklyn Victory Celebration Committee (celebrating the Allied victory in World War I) and asked that his contributed funds be donated instead to the Red Cross; many committee members eventually resigned in protest over <b>the</b> <b>overt</b> politicization of the event, and its control by William Randolph Hearst.|$|E
5|$|Years {{of civil}} war had left Rome {{in a state of}} near lawlessness, but the Republic was not {{prepared}} to accept the control of Octavian as a despot. At the same time, Octavian could not simply give up his authority without risking further civil wars among the Roman generals and, even if he desired no position of authority whatsoever, his position demanded that he look to the well-being of the city of Rome and the Roman provinces. Octavian's aims from this point forward were to return Rome to a state of stability, traditional legality, and civility by lifting <b>the</b> <b>overt</b> political pressure imposed on the courts of law and ensuring free elections—in name at least.|$|E

40|$|Under what {{circumstances}} can a {{sale of goods}} by a person, who is not {{the owner of the}} goods, nonetheless confer good title on the purchaser? The common law rule “nemo dat quod non habet” embodies the principle that the transferee of goods cannot get better title than that of the transferor. In other words, if goods are sold by a person who does not have title to the goods (for example, because he had obtained the goods by theft), then he would be unable to pass title to a subsequent purchaser since he did not have title to begin with. The nemo dat rule thus protects the true or original owner of goods. One of the exceptions to this rule under the Hong Kong Sale of Goods Ordinance is <b>the</b> market <b>overt</b> exception, which seeks to protect innocent purchasers. This article first considers the meanings of and rationales behind the nemo dat rule and <b>the</b> market <b>overt</b> exception respectively. Problems with <b>the</b> existing market <b>overt</b> exception will next be discussed. A suggestion will then be made that <b>the</b> market <b>overt</b> exception be replaced with a rule that protects innocent buyers who deal as consumers and who have purchased goods from shops or markets in Hong Kong...|$|R
