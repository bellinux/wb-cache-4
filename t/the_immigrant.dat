5|$|With {{the way to}} Miltia opened, the Federation, U-TIC, and <b>the</b> <b>Immigrant</b> Fleet fight {{each other}} {{for control of the}} Zohar hidden on the planet.

With help from Gaignun and the Second Miltia government, the group then launch an assault with the Elsa, destroying <b>the</b> <b>Immigrant</b> Fleet mothership before being rescued by Gaignun as the space-time distortion around Miltia vanishes.

After a skirmish with Margulis, the group find the Zohar and two deformed comatose Realians used to control its energy: these are Cecily and Cathe.

He installs the Zohar into the Proto Omega, a giant machine built within the structure of Miltia, with the intent of destroying the Gnosis and Federation so Ormus will be free to rediscover Lost Jerusalem.|$|E

The parishioners of this new congregation were Italians living in and around New Kensington, Arnold, and Parnassus, which later became a part of the city of New Kensington.

40|$|Until the 1960 s, the {{settlement}} of Lebanese migrants in Queensland was characteristically regional, with <b>the</b> <b>immigrants</b> dispersed widely throughout <b>the</b> state. <b>Immigrant</b> settlement involves a dynamic and complex interaction between <b>the</b> <b>immigrants</b> and <b>the</b> social, political and economic structures of the receiving society. An analysis of {{the settlement}} experience of Lebanese immigrants in Queensland from the 1880 s reveals the interplay of several factors, {{which resulted in a}} distinct pattern of settlement. Fundamental to this experience was the influence of racially exclusive state and Commonwealth legislation and immigration policies. Additionally, Queensland 2 ̆ 7 s particular geography and style of development, in conjunction with the predominance of self-employment and the segregation of Lebanese in petty commercial occupations such as hawking and shopkeeping, significantly determined the immigrants’ geographic settlement pattern. Finally, a less obvious but nonetheless important factor was the determination of <b>the</b> <b>immigrants</b> to settle permanently in Queensland. Whatever the reasons, this dispersed settlement pattern significantly shaped the lives of <b>the</b> <b>immigrants</b> and their descendants...|$|R

Sitting Bull arrived in May the following year and, by the summer, around 5,600 Sioux had crossed the border despite opposition from the Blackfoot. The mounted police helped to facilitate the negotiations with the Sioux, in which Assistant Commissioner Acheson Irvine played a prominent part.

The police lived in primitive conditions and voluntarily shared {{some of their own}} supplies with the Sioux, who were not covered by Treaty 7 and therefore ineligible for government support. Nonetheless, starvation gradually forced the return of most of the newcomers to the United States, and Sitting Bull himself finally surrendered in 1881.|$|E
