[...] "Don't Bother Me" [...] appeared on the band's second album, With the Beatles, later that year, then on Meet the Beatles! in the US in early 1964. In 1965, he contributed [...] "I Need You" [...] and [...] "You Like Me Too Much" [...] to the album Help! ...|$|E
500|$|I {{started writing}} what I felt was Bat Out of Hell part 2, {{definitely}} like The Godfather part I and part 2, that's how I saw it. I {{wanted to do}} a continuation and I {{wanted to do a}}n album that went even further and that was more extreme, if possible, which a lot of people felt wasn't possible but I just wanted <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> make a record that was even more heroic because that's what I thought of it ... Bat Out of Hell to me was ultimately very heroic though it was funny ... and I wanted to do one that to me would be even more heroic and more epic and a little more operatic and passionate.|$|E
500|$|M.I.A. views {{her work}} as reflective, pieced {{together}} in one piece [...] "so you can acquire it and hear it." [...] She states, [...] "All that information floats around where we are – the images, the opinions, the discussions, the feelings – they all exist, and I felt someone {{had to do something}} about it because I can't live in this world where we pretend nothing really matters." [...] On the political nature of her songs she has said, [...] "Nobody wants to be dancing to political songs. Every bit of music out there that’s making it into the mainstream is really about nothing. I wanted <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> write songs about something important and make it sound like nothing. And it kind of worked." [...] Censorship on MTV of [...] "Sunshowers" [...] proved controversial and was again criticised following Kala release [...] "Paper Planes". YouTube's block and subsequent age gating/obscuring of the video for [...] "Born Free" [...] from Maya due to its graphic violence/political subtext was criticised by M.I.A. as hypocritical, citing the Internet channel's streaming of real-life killings.

2500|$|The {{estate of}} Raymond Chandler was {{satisfied}} with Parker's completion of Poodle Springs, a Philip Marlowe novel begun in 1958 by Chandler but finished by Parker for publication in 1989. They authorized him to write this entirely new sequel to the first Marlowe novel, The Big Sleep, originally published in 1939. [...] Parker, a longtime fan and student of Chandler's writing, said he took the assignment because [...] "I wanted <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do it". After the publication of Perchance to Dream, Parker announced {{that this would be}} his final Marlowe novel because he did not [...] "want to spend [...] life writing some other guy's books".|$|E
2500|$|Jabbar Mohammed al-Kaissi, an {{eyewitness}} to the blast {{was across the}} street filling a five-liter gas can “when a truck carrying what he estimated was 60 canisters of gas exploded, sending canisters flying through the air, creating secondary explosions when they landed as far as 100 yards away.” He saw a ball of fire rise {{into the air and}} turning back to see the car holding his wife and three daughters saw the wall of the mosque fall on it crushing and killing them. [...] "I was frozen by the shock. As I rushed to the car <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> save any of them, the gas canisters started to explode one after the other." ...|$|E

2500|$|Adam Ant {{approached}} Malcolm McLaren (the {{manager of}} The Sex Pistols) {{and asked him}} to manage the band. McLaren subsequently took the rest of the Ants from the original group when he introduced the singer Annabella Lwin and began the process of honing Bow Wow Wow for chart success. Later Adam seemed to have reconciled with the fact. [...] "I like to use the word 'mutiny'. My band was happy to go. Malcolm tried <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> fit into Bow Wow Wow, but I never could've or would've. I might have had a broken heart at the time, but Malcolm didn't leave me with nothing. [...] He mentored me. He said: 'Look, what do you want?' I said: 'I wanna sell millions of records', and he said, 'Well, you're going the wrong way about it. This [...] is the kind of esoteric stuff you do when you've done eight albums, you're living on a yacht, and you can do what you want'," [...] he remembered later.|$|E
2500|$|In 1993 Moore {{declared}} {{himself to be}} a ceremonial magician. The same year marked a move by Moore back to the mainstream comics industry and back to writing superhero comics. He did so through Image Comics, widely known at the time for its flashy artistic style, graphic violence, and scantily clad large-breasted women, something that horrified many of his fans. His first work published by Image, an issue of the series Spawn, was soon followed by the creation of his own mini-series, 1963, which was [...] "a pastiche of Jack Kirby stories drawn for Marvel in the sixties, with their rather overblown style, colourful characters and cosmic style". According to Moore, [...] "after I'd done the 1963 stuff I'd become aware of how much the comic audience had changed while I'd been away [...] That {{all of a sudden it}} seemed that the bulk of the audience really wanted things that had almost no story, just lots of big, full-page pin-up sort of pieces of artwork. And I was genuinely interested <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> write a decent story for that market." ...|$|E
2500|$|Horn's first {{photographic}} installation, You Are The Weather (1994-1996), {{a photographic}} cycle featuring 100 close-up {{shots of the}} same woman, Margret, {{in a variety of}} Icelandic geothermal pools, deals with the enigma of identity captured through a series of facial expressions dictated by imperceptible weather changes. Horn described her goals for this project in the Art:21 documentary series, [...] "“In the case of You Are the Weather, I was curious <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> elicit a place from her face, almost like a landscape. Not in the literal sense, but how close those identities were.” [...] Notes written by Horn about this work were included in the catalogue that accompanied Horn's 2009 traveling retrospective Roni Horn aka Roni Horn. The two-volume book included a Subject Index that brought together writings and reflections on works, themes, titles and topics related to Horn's practice. About You are the Weather, Horn writes, [...] "The way this work is shot and installed, the viewer is voyeurized by the view. You are surrounded by a woman who is staring at you." [...] Curator Donna De Salvo continues this suggestively erotic interplay between subject and object in one of her own contributions to the Subject Index, [...] "You are the Weather depicts a living, rather than an inert, thing. Horn complicated the notion of surface and skin. This treatment of the face smudges the distinction between object and subject. Just who is the 'you'? Of course all answers are completely dependent upon who chooses to inhabit the role of 'you.' It's a discovery process, which in some ways reflects the making of the work itself. The subtle and not so subtle difference in these photographs make it difficult for a viewer to dismiss any one image as being identical to the one next to it. 'You' have to look hard." ...|$|E
