5|$|The trial opens as {{originally}} scheduled, {{but the two}} Finley & Figg partners prove unequal to the task. During opening statements, Oscar suffers a myocardial infarction. Wally attempts <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>light</b> <b>of</b> the situation by proclaiming it an example of Krayoxx's side effects. Karros moves for a mistrial and the motion is granted, leading {{to the need to}} pick a new jury and the judge imposes a fine on the already financially strained Finley & Figg. Wally stands in for Oscar as lead attorney while a new jury is seated and for the first day of testimony. The next day, the recovering alcoholic Figg is nowhere to be found although an empty pint bottle of Smirnoff Vodka is.|$|E
5|$|Jim's plan {{to drive}} home from Philadelphia to see his {{daughter}} CeCe's ballet recital hits a snag when a major investor says he is backing out. Jim asks his wife Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) to record the recital with her phone, which she agrees to do. During {{the opening of the}} recital, she stops recording to take a phone call informing her that she has been chosen to paint an important public mural. In her excitement, she messes up the recording and fails to record any of CeCe's appearance. Jim calls her that evening to tell her the investor backed out, and his group will have to work long hours to make up the lost funds. He asks her to send him her recording of the recital as a way to cheer him up, and Pam confesses that she did not tape it. She tries <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>light</b> <b>of</b> the mishap by making self-deprecating remarks and pointing out that they can get recordings of the recital from other attendees, but he becomes frustrated at her, scolding her and starting a fight over his new job, the time he spends away from the family, and the sacrifices they are making to get their new life to work. After he hangs up, Pam breaks down in tears. A previously unseen boom operator named Brian (Chris Diamantopoulos) enters into the shot and comforts her, and tells the crew to stop filming.|$|E
25|$|Byrd {{initially}} {{said that}} the impeachment proceedings against Clinton should be taken seriously. Although he harshly criticized any attempt <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>light</b> <b>of</b> the allegations, he made the motion to dismiss the charges and effectively end the matter. Even though he voted against both articles of impeachment, he was the sole Democrat to vote to censure Clinton.|$|E

50|$|The story uses a style typical to many parodies and spoofs of the genre, {{most notably}} Bored of the Rings, {{encompassing}} not only high and sometimes abstruse humor but middle and low as well, through punning references and plays on words designed <b>to</b> either <b>make</b> <b>light</b> <b>of</b> the original characters' names or referencing pop-culture touchpoints.|$|R

500|$|Bengough's {{cartoons}} {{are best}} remembered for fixing his renditions of Macdonald {{in the public}} imagination. [...] Bengough's bulbous-nosed politician often appeared baggy-eyed with bottles of alcohol in his hands as a sombre symbol of corruption, {{in contrast to the}} work of John Henry Walker, another prolific caricaturist of Macdonald who depicted the prime minister's drunkenness <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>light</b> <b>of</b> him. [...] Bengough continued to hone his draftsmanship after Macdonald's death, but the wit and inspiration of his Macdonald cartoons continue to draw the most attention.|$|E
500|$|... "Honey, Just Allow Me One More Chance" [...] {{is based}} on [...] "Honey, Won't You Allow Me One More Chance?", a song {{dating back to the}} 1890s that was popularized by Henry Thomas in his 1928 recording. [...] "However, Thomas's {{original}} provided no more than a song title and a notion", writes Heylin, [...] "which Dylan turned into a personal plea to an absent lover to allow him 'one more chance to get along with you.' It is a vocal tour de force and ... showed a Dylan prepared <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>light</b> <b>of</b> his own blues by using the form itself." ...|$|E

The principal functions of the GAZ-46 MAV were <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>light</b> work <b>of</b> crossing lakes and rivers for men and materials, as well as performing river reconnaissance. As {{of the end of the}} fifties the latter role became reserved for the BRDM-1, a much more powerful 4x4 amphibious vehicle.|$|R
500|$|Maiellaro cast {{people around}} {{his office to}} voice the characters. He {{provides}} {{the voice of the}} protagonist, Mouse Fitzgerald. He originally only gave the scratch dialogue for the character during production of the pilot episode, but chose himself to voice Mouse regularly after hearing his lines assembled in the final cut. Kurt Soccolich was chosen by Maiellaro to voice Rectangular Businessman, who [...] "already had that sort of smooth arrogance in his voice", making him a [...] "perfect" [...] fit for him. Matt Harrigan was selected to voice Liquor, who is [...] "always looking <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>light</b> <b>of</b> a situation", according to Maiellaro.|$|E
500|$|Simone was {{initially}} portrayed {{as one of}} the series' supporting characters, but gained more prominence during a storyline in which she comes out as a lesbian. Kalouria defended the show's treatment of the character's sexuality as a serious commentary on the topic. During an interview about the storyline, he highlighted [...] "sexual identity isn't a passing fancy" [...] and [...] "this is where [...] is...I can assure you we're not going <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>light</b> <b>of</b> this particular topic." [...] During the story arc involving her girlfriend Rae Thomas, Simone was noted for her naivety when approaching relationships and sex. Simone's sexuality is initially regarded as [...] "a badge of shame" [...] by the series' characters.|$|E
500|$|Theme Hospital was {{released}} in March 1997 (although it was originally due for release in November 1996), and is part of Bullfrog's Designer Series. The game attracted some controversy from NHS managers, the Houses of Parliament, and The Daily Telegraph, who published an article criticising the game as [...] "sick" [...] because the British Medical Association was using it to train management staff. The NHS argued that the game mocked hospital management. Webley was invited to appear on a local radio station; he did not consider the game <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>light</b> <b>of</b> real-world health management because it featured fictional diseases rather than real ones. Theme Hospital was a commercial success, which surprised Bullfrog and Electronic Arts. It repeatedly appeared {{in the top five}} of budget charts and sold over 4 million copies. In 2014, Molyneux stated that he wanted the game to make a comeback, and described Theme Hospital as [...] "a great game that I and many people remember".|$|E

In his final league appearance, he tormented KCC goalie Sadiq Wassa {{to the extent that}} when he scored his fourth in the 5-0 win, he simply walked off the field as if to suggest that {{domestic}} opposition no longer matched his ambitions.

5000|$|The title [...] "40 & 8" [...] {{comes from}} the box cars {{that were used to}} {{transport}} troops to the front in France. Each car had the emblem 40/8 stenciled on the sides, which meant that it could carry 40 men or 8 horses. These cars were known as forty-and-eights. They were seen by the troops as a miserable way to travel, and the new organization was thus called the 40 & 8 in an attempt <b>to</b> <b>make</b> some <b>light</b> <b>of</b> the common misery they had all shared.|$|R
500|$|Over {{the course}} of the show, Simone was played by three actresses: Lena Cardwell (July 5, 1999 to April 16, 2001), Chrystee Pharris (April 17, 2001 to April 2004), and Cathy Jenéen Doe (July 23, 2004 to September 4, 2007). The program made history as the first daytime serial to show two women having sex in bed. She is also the first African-American lesbian {{character}} to appear in a daytime serial. When discussing the decision to portray Simone as a lesbian, Kalouria emphasized [...] "sexual identity isn't a passing fancy" [...] and [...] "this is where [...] is [...] I can assure you we're not going <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>light</b> <b>of</b> this particular topic." [...] The storyline about Simone's lesbianism, and the representation of her sexuality, received mixed feedback from critics and media outlets, as did Cathy Jenéen Doe's performance. Passions won the award for Outstanding Daily Drama at the 17th GLAAD Media Awards for its portrayal of Simone's sexuality, and her relationship with Rae. Despite the award, Sarah Warn, former editor of entertainment website AfterEllen.com, criticized the lesbian reveal as having [...] "reduced Simone to a one-dimensional character who happened to sleep with a girl." ...|$|E
500|$|Although officially retired, Grimaldi still {{received}} half of {{his former}} small salary from Drury Lane until 1824. [...] Soon after the fee stopped, Grimaldi fell into poverty {{after a number of}} ill-conceived business ventures and because he had entrusted management of his provincial earnings to people who cheated him. Despite his disabilities, he offered his services as a cameo performer in Christmas pantomimes. [...] Along with Bologna, he re-appeared briefly at Sadler's Wells where he gave some acting instruction to the mime artist William Payne, the future father of the Payne Brothers. [...] He also started working for Richard Brinsley Peake, namesake of Richard Brinsley Sheridan, who was the dramaturge at the English Opera House. Peake hired Grimaldi to star in Monkey Island alongside his son JS. However, Grimaldi's health deteriorated further and he was forced to quit before the show opened; his scene was cut. [...] The early end to his career, worries about money, and the uncertainty over his son's future made him increasingly depressed. <b>To</b> <b>make</b> <b>light</b> <b>of</b> it, he would often joke about his condition: [...] "I make you laugh at night but am Grim-all-day". In 1828, two [...] "farewell" [...] benefit performances were held for him. [...] In the first, he appeared as Hock the German soldier and a drunken sailor in Thomas Dibdin's melodrama The Sixes; or, The Fiends at Sadler's Wells to an audience of 2,000 people. Unable to stand for long periods of time, he sang a duet with JS and finished the evening with a scene from Mother Goose. His last farewell benefit performance on 27 June 1828 was at Drury Lane. Between 1828 and 1836, Grimaldi relied on charity benefits to replace his lost income.|$|E

Ziska would have escaped now from the project could he have done so without remark; but he was ashamed to seem afraid to enter the building, as the girls seemed <b>to</b> <b>make</b> so <b>light</b> <b>of</b> his doing so.

Sydney were able to put on a par-score after winning the toss (6/153, Nic Maddinson - 68 runs). A good spell of bowling from Brett Lee (2/22) and Ian Moran at the death ensured the Sixers would reach the final. The Sixers {{went on to win}} the inaugural 2011-12 Big Bash League (BBL), defeating the Perth Scorchers at the WACA Ground. Again Lee (2/21) lead the Sixers attack as they were able to restrict Perth to 8/156.

2500|$|Aspects of Simm's {{portrayal}} of the Master parallel Tennant's Doctor, primarily in his ability <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>light</b> <b>of</b> tense situations and his rather quirky and hyperactive personality. According to the producers, this was done to make the Master more threatening to the Doctor by having him take one of his opponent's greatest strengths, as well as making the parallels between the two characters more distinctive. This rationale is written into dialogue by the Master in [...] "Utopia", in which he explicitly states, as he is regenerating, that if the Doctor can be young and strong, then so can he. In an episode of Doctor Who Confidential, [...] "Lords and Masters", Russell T Davies also classifies the Master as both a sociopath and a psychopath.|$|E

Any person could have said that this was too heavy a price for Hindu-Muslim unity. But Mr. Gandhi was so much obsessed by the necessity of establishing Hindu-Muslim unity that he was prepared <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>light</b> <b>of</b> the doings of the Moplas and the Khilafats who were congratulating them.

2500|$|Larry Linville {{noted that}} his [...] "Frank Burns" [...] {{character}} was easier <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>light</b> <b>of</b> after head comedy writer Larry Gelbart departed after season 4 and Frank and Margaret parted ways in season 5. After season 4, Linville {{realized that he}} had taken Frank Burns as far as he could, and he decided that since he had signed a five-year contract, he would leave the series after season 5. During the first episode of season 6, [...] "Fade Out, Fade In", Burns (off camera) suffers a nervous breakdown due to Margaret's marriage and is held for psychiatric evaluation. Hawkeye offered a toast to Frank's departure, pausing only a moment, then stating [...] "Goodbye, Ferret Face." [...] In an unexpected twist, Burns is transferred to an Indiana Veterans Administration hospital, near his home in Fort Wayne, and is promoted to lieutenant colonel – in a sense, Frank's parting shot at Hawkeye. Unlike McLean Stevenson and Wayne Rogers, Linville had no regrets about leaving the series, saying, [...] "I felt I had done everything possible with the character." [...] Linville was not alone when he left; Executive Producer Gene Reynolds left after the production of season 5, and Burt Metcalfe and star Alan Alda took over the producing responsibilities. During season 6, Alda and Metcalfe even consulted Reynolds once a week, mainly to obtain help with their jobs as executive producers. These two men remained as executive producers for the remaining six seasons, as Reynolds was credited as a creative consultant along with Alan Alda.|$|E
30|$|Finn and Nybell et al. {{describe}} the malleability of “childhood” by analysing the influence globalisation has on it. This dynamic also {{highlights the importance}} of children to their families in the processes of migration, pioneering integration within the family that is still adapting to its new surroundings (Finn et al. 2010, p. 248). Archard’s identification of the Western notion of the child as ‘a vulnerable, weak, and dependent creature’ hardly coincides with the migrant child who is the first person within the family to confront its new surroundings and to adapt to ‘changing meanings of identity and belonging’ (Ibid.). This is a key point <b>to</b> <b>make</b> in <b>light</b> <b>of</b> the current research on COTM and their supposed vulnerabilities.|$|R

Ed McMahon would hand Carnac a series of envelopes containing questions, {{said to have been}} [...] "hermetically sealed in a mayonnaise jar buried under Funk & Wagnall's porch since noon today." [...] Carnac would place each envelope against his forehead and predict the answer, such as [...] "Gatorade". Then, he would read the question: [...] "What does an alligator get on welfare?"
