5|$|The video {{opens with}} Inna {{answering}} {{to a call}} she gets from Stan on her Lenovo smartphone, of which the ringtone is the saxophone riff featured in the song. Subsequently, both are presented standing {{close to each other}} in front of a red backdrop and a cactus. The next scene portrays Stan and some backup dancers hanging out in the dressing room of a club, with her eventually going downstairs to the full party hall and later meeting Inna <b>there.</b> <b>Next,</b> Yankee makes a cameo appearance in the clip, followed by both singers performing a synchronized choreography. The video ends in the same way it opens. Cut scenes portray Yankee, Stan and Inna singing and dancing to the song in front of yellow, green and blue backdrops, Inna performing to the club's crowd or Stan dancing on a runaway.|$|E
5|$|Between 1930 and 1936, Kolbe {{undertook}} {{a series of}} missions to East Asia. At first, he arrived in Shanghai, China, but failed to gather a following <b>there.</b> <b>Next,</b> he moved to Japan, where by 1931 he founded a monastery at the outskirts of Nagasaki (it later gained a novitiate and a seminary) and started publishing a Japanese edition of the Knight of the Immaculate (Seibo no Kishi). The monastery he founded remains prominent in the Roman Catholic Church in Japan. Kolbe built the monastery on a mountainside that, according to Shinto beliefs, was not the side best suited to be in harmony with nature. When the atomic bomb was dropped on Nagasaki, Kolbe's monastery was saved because {{the other side of}} the mountain took the main force of the blast. In mid-1932 he left Japan for Malabar, India, where he founded another monastery; this one however closed after a while. Meanwhile, the monastery at Niepokalanów began in his absence to publish the daily newspaper, Mały Dziennik (The Little Daily), in alliance with the political group, the National Radical Camp (Obóz Narodowo Radykalny). This publication reached a circulation of 137,000, and nearly double that, 225,000, on weekends.|$|E

Thanks to this inscription, egyptologists such as Miroslav Verner and Tarek el-Awady now believe that Neferirkare Kakai was the eldest son of Sahure and bore the name Ranefer before his accession to the throne. Alternatively, Neferirkare Kakai could be a brother of Sahure, in which case he may have usurped the throne at the expense of his nephew, Netjerirenre.|$|E

He was the son of Arthur the soldier, and Arthur himself killed and buried him in that very place.

At whatever length you might measure it at one time, a second time you will not find it to have the same length – and I myself have put this to the test.|$|E

25|$|In summertime village cricket is {{the delight}} of everyone. Nearly every village has its own cricket field where the young men play and the old men watch. In the village of Lintz in County Durham {{they have their own}} ground, where they have played these last 70 years. They tend it well. The wicket area is well rolled and mown. The outfield is kept short. It has a good club house for the players and seats for the onlookers. The village team play there on Saturdays and Sundays. They belong to a league, {{competing}} with the neighbouring villages. On other evenings after work they practise while the light lasts. Yet now after these 70 years a judge of the High Court has ordered that they must not play there any more. He has issued an injunction to stop them. He has done it at the instance of a newcomer who is no lover of cricket. This newcomer has built, or has had built for him, a house {{on the edge of the}} cricket ground which four years ago was a field where cattle grazed. The animals did not mind the cricket. But now this adjoining field has been turned into a housing estate. The newcomer bought one of the houses on the edge of the cricket ground. No doubt the open space was a selling point. Now he complains that when a batsman hits a six the ball has been known to land in his garden or on or near his house. His wife has got so upset about it that they always go out at week-ends. They do not go into the garden when cricket is being played. They say that this is intolerable. So they asked the judge to stop the cricket being played. And the judge, much against his will, has felt that he must order the cricket to be stopped: with the consequence, I suppose, that the Lintz Cricket Club will disappear. The cricket ground will be turned to some other use. I expect for more houses or a factory. The young men will turn to other things instead of cricket. The whole village will be much the poorer. And all this because of a newcomer who has just bought a house <b>there</b> <b>next</b> to the cricket ground.|$|E

2500|$|The [...] "Angelic temple" [...] {{named in}} the {{inscription}} has been identified by some scholars as Bernward's sepulchral church of the archangel St. Michael. According to them, the doors were originally hung in the south aisle (perhaps as two separate doors), in the cloisters, or in no longer extant westwork and were transferred to the Cathedral in 1035 for the new western entrance which Wolfhere (...) reports that Bishop Gotthard had made in his biography, [...] A combination of the previous hypothesis with the original location of the doors is provided by Wesenberg. Latterly, Bernhard Bruns attempted to locate the original location of the doors at St. Michael's by their iconography. The excavations carried out during renovations in 2006 have now demonstrated that St. Michael's never had a westwork. But {{the installation of the}} doors on the south aisle has also come into question, since foundation remains of a narthex were found <b>there,</b> <b>next</b> to the western stairway tower. Recent research in religious history now demonstrates templum angelicum was a liturgical form for a church dedicated to St. Michael.|$|E
