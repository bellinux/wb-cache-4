5|$|The Jägerstab {{was given}} {{extraordinary}} powers over labour, production and transportation resources, with its functions taking priority over housing repairs for bombed out civilians or restoration of vital city services. The factories that {{came under the}} Jägerstab program saw their work-weeks extended to 72 hours. At the same time, Milch took steps to rationalise production by {{reducing the number of}} variants of each <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>aircraft</b> produced.|$|E
5|$|The Montana {{class would}} have used {{aircraft}} for reconnaissance and for gunnery spotting. The <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>aircraft</b> used would have depended on when exactly the battleships would have been commissioned, but in all probability they {{would have used}} either the Kingfisher or the Seahawk. The aircraft would have been floatplanes launched from catapults on the ship's fantail. They would have landed {{on the water and}} taxied to the stern of the ship to be lifted by a crane back to the catapult.|$|E
5|$|The flight-deck cruiser was a {{proposed}} <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>aircraft</b> cruiser, warships combining features of aircraft carriers and light cruisers {{designed by the}} United States Navy during the period between World War I and World War II. Several designs were proposed for the type, but none were approved for construction. The final design was developed just before World War II, and the entry of the United States into the war saw the project come to an end.|$|E

5|$|During 1999, {{domestic}} air {{ticket prices}} increased 9.2%, and another 17% the following year. By 2001, the domestic capacity was {{below the level}} before Gardermoen opened. Braathens and SAS started cooperating to set the full-price tickets on routes to eleven cities. This meant that the prices were identical on all the routes where both airlines flew, although they {{were not allowed to}} make such cooperation with discounted tickets. During the crisis, Braathens had sold several aircraft and started leasing them back to gain liquidity. The company announced in 2000 that they were considering purchasing a smaller <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>aircraft,</b> that would replace the 737s on some routes, and that would allow Braathens to start operating the Norwegian Air Shuttle services themselves.|$|E
5|$|IndiGo {{became one}} of the fastest growing low cost {{carriers}} in the world and was the largest profitable airline in India. The success of IndiGo has been attributed to its unique business model which reduces costs. The airline operates a single <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>aircraft</b> (Airbus A320) in similar seating configuration which simplifies crew training and maintenance. The airline strikes bulk deals with Airbus reducing unit costs. The airline targets a quick turn-around time of 20 minutes to get the aircraft ready for the next flight, ensuring planes fly about 12 hours every day. With this it has created an Indian record of more than 900 flights a day. Employees share multiple roles with a check-in staff doubling as a baggage handler.|$|E
5|$|Seventeen {{production}} Silverplate aircraft {{were ordered}} in August 1944 {{to allow the}} 509th Composite Group to train with the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>aircraft</b> {{they would have to}} fly in combat, and for the 216th Army Air Forces Base Unit to test bomb configurations. These were followed by 28 more aircraft that were ordered in February 1945 for operational use by the 509th Composite Group. This batch included the aircraft which were used in the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945. Including the Pullman B-29, a total of 46 Silverplate B-29s were produced during and after World War II. An additional 19 Silverplate B-29s were ordered in July 1945, which were delivered between {{the end of the war}} and the end of 1947. Thus, a total of 65 Silverplate B-29s were made.|$|E

5|$|The ship's {{assignment}} at {{the beginning}} of the Pacific War was to support the invasion of the Philippines, initially by attacking the American naval base at Davao, Mindanao on the morning of 8 December. Her air group had not changed, but four of each <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>aircraft</b> were spares. Ryūjōs initial airstrike consisted of 13 B5Ns escorted by nine A5Ms with a smaller, follow-on airstrike later in the day by two B5Ns and three A5Ms. They accomplished little, destroying two Consolidated PBY seaplanes on the ground for the loss of one B5N and A5M. The ship covered the landing at Davao on 20 December and her B5Ns attacked a British oil tanker south of Davao. In January 1942 her aircraft supported Japanese operations in the Malay Peninsula.|$|E
5|$|There was a Royal Flying Corps {{airfield}} at Saint-Inglevert {{during the}} First World War, {{but not on}} the site of the current airfield. In April 1918, No. 21 Squadron Royal Air Force (RAF) were based at Saint-Inglevert, flying Royal Aircraft Factory R.E.8 aircraft. From 29 June to 23 October, No. 214 Squadron RAF were based there flying Handley Page O/400s, and in November, they were replaced by No. 115 Squadron RAF, who were flying the same <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>aircraft.</b> Two more squadrons, No. 97 Squadron RAF and No. 100 Squadron RAF, were based there from 17 November, to be joined by two squadrons of the United States Navy in 1918, flying Sopwith Camels. All Royal Air Force squadrons departed from Saint-Inglevert on 4 March 1919.|$|E
5|$|The Admiral Nakhimov-class cruisers were a {{group of}} four light cruisers built for the Imperial Russian Navy just before World War I began in 1914. Construction was {{interrupted}} by the Russian Revolution and {{only two of the}} ships were eventually completed well {{after the end of the}} Russian Civil War by the Soviets. Chervona Ukraina was the first ship completed and was built to essentially the original design. Krasnyi Kavkaz was much modified and completed five years after Chervona Ukraina. Both ships participated in the Sieges of Odessa and Sevastopol after the Germans invaded Russia in June 1941. They ferried troops into the cities, evacuated wounded and bombarded the besieging German troops. Chervona Ukraina was bombed and sunk by dive bombers in November during one of these missions and Krasny Kavkaz was badly damaged by the same <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>aircraft</b> in January 1942. After her lengthy repairs were completed, the ship transported reinforcements to cities on the Black Sea coast during the Battle of the Caucasus. She was reclassified as a training ship in 1947 before she was sunk as a target in 1956. Chervona Ukraina was salvaged in 1947 and then became a hulked. She became a target ship in 1950.|$|E
