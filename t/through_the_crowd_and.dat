He made his official in-ring return the next night on Raw, losing a singles match to WWE Champion Randy Orton. On the April 4 episode of SmackDown!, Hardy faced MVP in a non-title match, which he won, re-igniting their storyline rivalry. On April 27, 2008, Hardy defeated MVP to win the United States Championship at Backlash, and successfully retained his title against MVP five days later on Smackdown.|$|E
5|$|Once in Nightopia, they {{discover}} and release Nights, who tells them about dreams and Wizeman and his plans; the three begin {{a journey to}} stop Wizeman and restore peace to Nightopia. When they defeat Wizeman and Reala, peace is returned to Nightopia {{and the world of}} Nightmare is suppressed. The next day, back in Twin Seeds, a centenary ceremony begins. Elliot is seen walking through the parade until he has a vision of Nights looking at him through a billboard. Realizing that Claris is performing in a hall, Elliot runs <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> <b>and</b> sees Claris on stage in front of a large audience, singing well. The two look at each other, and are transitioned to a spring valley in Nightopia, which leaves ambiguity as to whether what they achieved was real or just a dream.|$|E

McCauley and Eady drive to the airport when he receives word of Waingro's location at a nearby hotel. Initially dismissive, McCauley decides to risk his freedom for revenge. He infiltrates the hotel, pulling a fire alarm to distract security and confronts Waingro before killing him.

25|$|Duggan {{eventually}} {{returned to}} television {{and started a}} feud with then-Intercontinental Champion Shawn Michaels, challenging him for the title on the May 3 edition of Monday Night Raw. Michaels ran <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd,</b> <b>and</b> retained the title by countout. On the next show, to prevent Michaels from pulling the stunt again, Duggan received a return bout in a lumberjack match which Michaels won on a disqualification. As Michaels and the lumberjacks brawled after the match, Duggan came to and cleared the ring with his 2-by-4. Duggan then competed in the King of the Ring tournament, defeating Papa Shango to qualify before losing to Bam Bam Bigelow in the quarterfinals. He continued to appear on WWF programming until the summer, {{when he left the}} company after losing several pre-Summerslam matches to Yokozuna.|$|E
25|$|The archetypical {{selection}} process {{for entry into}} a collegiate secret society began at Yale University by a process called tapping. On a publicly announced evening, Yale undergraduates would assemble informally in the College Yard. Current members of Yale's secret societies would walk <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> <b>and</b> literally tap a prospective member {{on the shoulder and}} then walk with him up to the tapped man's dorm room. There, in private, they would ask him to become a member of their secret society; the inductee had the choice of accepting or rejecting the offer of membership. During this process, it was publicly known who was being tapped for the coming year. Today, the {{selection process}} is not quite as formal, but is still public. Formal tapping days used to exist at Berkeley, and still exist in a much more formal setting at Missouri.|$|E

2500|$|Irish {{government}} institutions and nationalist politicians {{called for an}} open and impartial inquiry. In the British House of Commons, Sir Hamar Greenwood, the Chief Secretary for Ireland, refused demands for such an inquiry. He denied that British forces had any involvement and accused the IRA of starting the fires. When asked about reports of firefighters being hampered by British forces he said [...] "Every available policeman and soldier in Cork was turned out at once and without their assistance the fire brigade could not have gone <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowds</b> <b>and</b> did <b>the</b> work that they tried to do".|$|R

25|$|In his 1998 {{documentary}} Hitman Hart: Wrestling with Shadows, Hart {{said that}} his fears were largely assuaged because he was close friends with referee Earl Hebner and trusted him implicitly. Asked by Hart, Hebner swore by his children {{that he would never}} double-cross Hart and that he would rather quit his job than participate in a screwjob. However, according to Michaels' account of the events in his 2005 autobiography, Heartbreak and Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story, Michaels himself informed Hebner of the plan only on Sunday evening, just as Survivor Series was about to commence. This contradicted what Hebner said on a 2003 edition of WWE Confidential, claiming that he first knew of McMahon's plan only ten minutes before the match finished, and out of panic following the bell ringing, he ran out of the ring, <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> <b>and</b> remained in his hotel room for the night, refusing to speak to anyone.|$|E
25|$|CMLL {{held their}} tribute to Rayo de Jalisco and Salvador Lutteroth after the ring was cleared from the Luchas de Apuetas match. Rayo de Jalisco Sr. {{came to the}} ring wearing his {{trademark}} lightingbolt mask and was accompanied by his son as well as Atlantis and Máscara Dorada for the ceremony. The fans showed their appreciation of the lucha libre legend by giving him a standing ovation as he was presented with a plaque commemorating the event. Atlantis and Máscara Dorada escorted the almost 80-year-old Rayo de Jalisco to the back while Rayo Jr. remained in the right for the fourth match of the night. Rayo Jr.'s partner Rush {{was introduced to the}} crowd, but before they could bring out Shocker Universo 2000 came <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> <b>and</b> attacked Rayo de Jalisco Jr. from behind. Moments later Shocker, Mr. Niebla and El Terrible all rushed to the ring and the opening portion of the match was chaos with all six wrestlers in the ring at the same time. The brawl saw the wrestlers pair off with their natural rivals, Shocker and Mr. Niebla, Rush and El Terrible and Rayo de Jalisco Jr. and Universo 2000. The rudo team took advantage of the confusion and cheated their way into winning the first fall. During the second fall Universo 2000 made a mistake, giving Rayo de Jalisco Jr. the opportunity to tie the match up at one fall each. During the third and final fall the 53-year-old Rayo de Jalisco Jr. actually leap off the top rope onto Universo 2000 on the floor. The third fall ended without a decisive victory as Universo 2000 decided to land a foul, low kick on Rayo de Jalisco Jr. drawing a disqualification from the referee.|$|E
25|$|Caesar {{addressed}} {{the people and}} asked Marcus Calpurnius Bibulus, the other consul, if he disapproved of the law. Calpurnius Bibulus just {{said that he would}} not tolerate any innovations during his year of office. Caesar did not ask any questions to other officials. Instead he brought forward the two most influential men in Rome, Pompey and Crassus, who were private citizens. They both declared their support for the law. Caesar asked Pompey if he would help him against the opponents of the law. Pompey said that he would and Crassus seconded him. Bibulus, supported by three plebeian tribunes, obstructed the vote. When he ran out of excuses for delaying he declared a sacred period for all the remaining days of the year. This meant that the people could not legally even meet in their assembly. Caesar ignored him and set date for the vote. The senate met at the house of Calpurnius Bibulus because it had not been convened. It planned that Bibulus was to oppose the law so that it would look that the senate was overcome by force, rather than through inaction. On the day of the vote Bibulus forced {{his way through the crowd}} with his followers to the temple of Castor where Caesar was making his speech. When he tried to make a speech he and his followers were pushed down the steps. There was a scuffle and some of the tribunes were wounded. Bibulus defied some men who had daggers, but he was dragged away by his friends. Cato pushed <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> <b>and</b> tried to make a speech, but was lifted up and carried away by Caesar’s supporters. He made a second attempt, but nobody listened to him.|$|E
50|$|Three of {{the four}} city’s consults {{gathered}} at the City Hall and attempted to reason with <b>the</b> <b>crowd.</b> However, their words were silenced amidst the clamor of <b>the</b> mob. <b>Through</b> great difficulty, <b>the</b> consults made their way <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowds</b> <b>and</b> eventually took refuge with the officers of the local garrison. Later that evening, the Duke of Clermont-Tonnerre withdrew his troops from the streets and hotel to prevent further violence from escalating the situation. The Duke managed to narrowly escape the hotel before <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> completely looted <b>the</b> inside. With control of the hotel lost, the Royal Navy troops were ordered {{to return to their}} quarters.|$|R

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Bang Bang", {{directed}} by Rancid frontman Tim Armstrong, {{was released on}} September 13, 2016. Inspired by the rise in gun violence in the US, it depicts a trio of criminals, wearing face masks of Green Day's members, robbing a bank during the first half. These scenes are intercut with footage of the band performing amidst a house party. During the second verse, the criminals flee the bank and remove their masks, revealing themselves as two women and a man, before driving off in a Jeep Wrangler. The criminals arrive at the house party where Green Day is playing. During the bridge and final chorus, the bank robbers make their way <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> <b>and</b> approach the band, before tossing money from the robbery into the air as the video fades out.|$|E
500|$|On Raw {{the next}} day Paul Heyman {{addressed}} the controversy of Rob Van Dam's WWE Championship win. He announced that Vince McMahon ruled Van Dam's WWE Championship win as official and that the WWE Championship would be rechristened as the ECW World Heavyweight Championship on the premiere of ECW on Sci Fi. On the debut episode of ECW on June 13, 2006, Heyman presented Van Dam with the ECW World Heavyweight Championship. Van Dam {{said that he had}} opted to keep the spinner belt (sarcastically remarking that [...] "this one spins!"), making him both WWE Champion and ECW World Heavyweight Champion. Edge, who was the number one contender for Van Dam's WWE Championship at Vengeance appeared, and speared Van Dam. Soon after, John Cena came <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> <b>and</b> attacked Edge, followed by a punch to Heyman, before being chased out by ECW Originals. At Vengeance Van Dam defeated Edge to retain the WWE Championship while Cena defeated Sabu in an Extreme Rules lumberjack match.|$|E
500|$|Although Mimi later {{claimed that}} she had bought Lennon's first guitar, it was {{actually}} his mother, after Lennon had pestered her incessantly for weeks. Julia insisted that the £5 instrument had to be delivered to her house and not to her sister's. The two sisters first saw Lennon perform with the Quarrymen at the Woolton St. Peter's Church fête {{on the afternoon of}} 6 July 1957. Julia (who knew that her son would be performing) heard music coming from the field behind the church (now the site of the Bishop Martin School), and pulled Mimi along with her to listen. Lennon saw his aunt coming <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> <b>and</b> comically changed the words of a song to feature her name: [...] "Oh-oh, here comes Mimi down the aisle now..." [...] Mimi related two versions of what she thought that day after seeing Lennon on stage: [...] "I was horrified to behold John in front of a microphone", and [...] "as pleased as Punch to see him up there".|$|E

500|$|As revenge, Wootton wrote a {{pamphlet}} titled Incidents in the Public Life of Robert Standish Sievier {{in which he}} claimed that Sievier had been expelled from the Victoria Racing Club, twice been declared bankrupt, cheated a man of £600 {{in a game of}} billiards and blackmailed another for £5,000. The pamphlet was released {{on the day of the}} Grand National <b>and</b> distributed widely <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowds,</b> <b>and</b> in response Sievier sued Wootton for libel. Sievier appeared without a lawyer, while Wotton was represented by Sir Edward Carson KC, Hastings, and E. H. Spence. After the second day of the trial, Carson was called away to Ireland on political business, and Hastings was forced to act as the primary counsel for Wootton. [...] Hastings destroyed Sievier's reputation in cross-examination, and the jury decided in Wootton's favour.|$|R

500|$|On 7 November 2013, {{a person}} who was at the murder scene {{uploaded}} a 1:04 minute video on YouTube showing the scene before Francisco Rafael was killed. The video starts with the former vocalist of Banda El Recodo singing [...] "El Señor de las Canas", a song by Vicente Fernández, alongside a mariachi group. As the film progresses, the camera turns to the sides and shows former footballer Jared Borgetti sitting at a table with Rocío del Carmen Lizárraga, wife of Francisco Rafael. Towards the last seconds of the video, a bald-looking man passes through the back of the tables {{in front of the camera}} and apparently gives a hand signal to the assassin before walking away. Then, a man dressed as a clown (the presumed assassin) passes <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> <b>and</b> heads towards Francisco Rafael. Seconds later, one shot was heard; most of the invitees were not aware of what had happened, and the music continued. Shortly afterwards, four more shots were heard from the rear. Following the second round of shots, the music stopped and the invitees started screaming. The video only captured a few seconds after the last four shots before concluding. The Baja California Sur authorities believe that the bald-looking man that appeared on the video shortly before the clown and apparently gave him a hand signal is involved in the murder plot. Eyewitnesses who sat at a table with the suspect stated that they did not know who he was but that they saw him greet Francisco Rafael during the party. The suspect reportedly made three phone calls during the party and sent several text messages. Investigators believe that the man was possibly communicating with the assassin; the authorities are investigating the text messages and phone calls made that day in the area through the Telcel database. With the surface of the video, the authorities were able to also gather more information about the assassin and the murder. They were able to identify other invitees, including former Cruz Azul footballer Héctor López. The video allowed the authorities to identify the physical characteristics of the assassin, including his skin color, approximate height, and the color of his clothing. The authorities are investigating whether any purchases made in custom or fabric stores in the area might lead them to the murderers.|$|E
2500|$|Toward {{the close}} of the day some young {{soldiers}} walked <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd,</b> <b>and,</b> when they heard any one speak against the war, seized the individual and marched him up the street with a great [...] following. [...] In many cases, after they had marched some poor fellow a few squares and thoroughly frightened him, they either slipped away or told him that if he would behave himself they would let him go. A number of men were taken to the police court and charged with carrying concealed weapons, and about forty pistols were taken from those arrested.|$|E
2500|$|Following Adams' speech, {{attendees}} {{created the}} first pile of small bicycles.

As I retreated to the crowd, my whole body was shaking. My hands were in disbelief. I paced in a circle and half-sigh/half-laughed and this darn smile was holding me so tight, I felt like the kiln was burning it into my clay, smile-shaped cheeks forever." [...] A long chain was wrapped through each of the nearly twenty bicycles, which were locked to the sculpture by Adams. Event attendees then posed for a group picture, then sang a song called [...] "16" [...] Rims", a parody of Janis Joplin's [...] "Mercedez Benz". The commemoration ended with [...] "dancing in the streets" [...] and music by The Sprockettes.|$|E

2500|$|The {{first public}} protest {{after the coup}} {{attracted}} between 20 and 100 protesters in front of Siam Center {{on the evening of}} Friday, 22 September 2006. Nobody was arrested, but police recorded the protest on video and noted that the tape would be examined to determine if protesters broke martial law. [...] It is unknown whether the police or junta will arrest those it had recorded. [...] Demonstrators wore black to mourn the death of democracy, and urged people who opposed the coup to also wear black. Protester Giles Ungphakorn noted, [...] "We believe we speak for a significant number of Thais who are too worried or too afraid to speak." [...] The protest was not reported on Thai television channels. The Independent reported that when the first protester, a female student, began reading out a statement, armed police forced their way <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> <b>and</b> grabbed her.

2500|$|The {{penultimate}} {{match was}} between The Undertaker and Triple H. For his entrance, Triple H had British heavy metal band Motörhead perform his theme song, [...] "The Game", live. The match {{started with the}} two fighting outside of the ring with Triple H quickly being put through the replacement Spanish announcers' table. Later on, referee Mike Chioda accidentally had Triple H catapulted into him and was then attacked by Undertaker due to his dissatisfaction over a two-count. With Chioda knocked out, the two brawled outside the ring, <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd,</b> <b>and</b> into the technical area. On top of scaffolding, Triple H used a steel chair to attack Undertaker's legs, but Undertaker retaliated with a chokeslam off the scaffolding, followed by an diving elbow drop. Back in the ring, Undertaker hit Triple H with a Tombstone piledriver and went for the pin but Chioda was still unconscious. Later in the match, Triple H tried to pin Undertaker after hitting {{him in the head}} with a sledgehammer while in the Last Ride position but only gained a two-count. Triple H sent Undertaker into the corner and stood on the second rope to hit him with more punches, but Undertaker countered with a Last Ride, allowing him to pin Triple H and increase his WrestleMania winning streak to 9–0.|$|E
2500|$|Michaels and Jannetty were {{supposed}} to feud following the breakup, but Jannetty left the federation for personal reasons after being suspended by the WWF, due to an incident outside a Tampa night club that occurred on January 25, 1992. [...] He was arrested with charges of resisting arrest with force, cocaine possession and possession of drug paraphernalia, forcing the feud to be abandoned at least temporarily. While Jannetty was away, Michaels began developing his “Heartbreak Kid” heel persona including getting Sherri Martel as his manager. Michaels also won the WWF Intercontinental Championship from The British Bulldog. On the October 31, 1992 (taped October 12, 1992 in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan) edition of WWF Superstars, Michaels was in the ring posing before a match, admiring himself in a mirror that Sherri brought to the ring. To everyone’s surprise, Jannetty came down <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> <b>and</b> entered the ring. Jannetty attacked Michaels, grabbed the mirror and tried to hit Michaels with it. But instead Michaels pulled Sherri in front of himself so that she got hit with the mirror instead. This led to Sherri being hospitalized from the glass shards (only in storyline terms) when Sherri returned from her “recovery” she turned on Michaels and actually backed Jannetty in his unsuccessful attempt to take the Intercontinental title away from Michaels at the 1993 Royal Rumble. After the loss, Jannetty once again left the WWF.|$|E
