25|$|The {{representative}} of a <b>testate</b> estate who is someone other than the executor named in the will is an administrator with the will annexed, or administrator c.t.a. (from the Latin cum testamento annexo.) The generic term for executors or administrators is personal representative.|$|E
25|$|Government, {{bankruptcy}} and general auctions are amongst {{the most common}} auctions to be found today. A government auction is simply an auction held {{on behalf of a}} government body generally at a general sale. Here one may find a vast range of materials that have to be sold by various government bodies, for example: HM Customs & Excise, the Official Receiver, the Ministry of Defence, local councils and authorities, liquidators, as well as material put up for auction by companies and members of the public. Also in this group you will find auctions ordered by executors who are entering the assets of individuals who have perhaps died in <b>testate</b> (those who have died without leaving a will), or in debt. One of the most interesting bodies to look out for at auction is HM Customs & Excise who may be entering at auction various items seized from smugglers, fraudsters and racketeers.|$|E

25|$|Billing succeeded Markham {{as chief}} justice of the king's bench 23 January 1468-9, having {{precedence}} over Yelverton and Bingham, justices of the king's bench; and this office he retained in spite of political changes. For when Henry VI for a few months regained the throne new patents were at once issued, 9 October 1470; and when Edward IV overthrew him, 17 June 1471, he, along with almost all the other judges, was confirmed in his seat. It is suggested that he may have owed this less to his legal talents than to the support of the Earl of Warwick. In 1477 Billing tried Burdet of Arrow, Warwickshire, a dependent of the Duke of Clarence, for treason, committed in 1474, in saying of a stag, 'I wish that the buck, horns and all, were in the king's belly,' for which he was executed. Billing is also said to have been concerned in the trial of the Duke of Clarence himself. He continued to sit in court until 5 May 1481, when he died <b>testate</b> and was buried in Bittlesden Abbey, Buckinghamshire. His tombstone is now in Wappenham Church, Northamptonshire. His successor was Sir William Hussey.|$|E

40|$|The article {{sheds light}} on life and work of the first reviwer of Serbian Civil Code Pavle Šeroglić. The paper is divided in two parts, first of which is {{concerned}} with Šeroglić's private and public life, as the second provides data on {{his career as a}} barrister. Šeroglić was born on July 25 th, 1800 in Sremski Karlovci. He finished elementary school and renown Sremski Karlovci Grammar School in his place of birth. Having completed his middle school education, Šeroglić studied philosophy in Szeged and law in Sárospatak, Pest and Vienna. As Šeroglić was a bachelor who had no children, he had been very supportive towards his nephew Grigorije (latter German) Anđelić, who later became the patriarch of Serbian Orthodox Church. Šeroglić was the benefactor of Sremski Karlovci Grammar School, to which he donated money and books. Besides then patriarch of Serbian Orthodox Church Josif Rajačić, Šeroglić is the most creditable figure for building an orthodox garrison chapel in Petrovaradin. In the beginning of his work as a barrister, Šeroglić was often accused of some acts beyond the limit of morality, such as giving legal advice for both parties in civil lawsuits. Notwithstanding such behaviour, {{in the years to come}} Šeroglić represented some very prominent individuals and institutions, such as former Serbian prince Miloš Obrenović, Austrian military treasury, inheritance mass of deceased Serbian metropolitan Stefan Stanković, catholic church Saint Mary of Snow (Tekije) in Sremski Karlovci, and famous Serbian poet Jovan Jovanović Zmaj's father in law Pavle Ličanin. Šeroglić died on February 12 th, 1857. He <b>testated</b> all his property to Sremski Karlovci Grammar School. During his lifetime Šeroglić showed goodness and generosity towards his cousins, Sremski Karlovci Grammar School and Serbian Orthodox Church. As a barrister, however, he did not always distinguish himself in morality, but judging by the names of his clients, he excelled in quality of his work...|$|R
2500|$|Many protists and {{bacteria}} produce other cell surface structures apart from cell walls, external (extracellular matrix) or internal. Many algae have a sheath or envelope of mucilage outside the cell made of exopolysaccharides. Diatoms build a frustule from silica {{extracted from the}} surrounding water; radiolarians, foraminiferans, <b>testate</b> amoebae and silicoflagellates also produce a skeleton from minerals, called test in some groups. [...] Many green algae, such as Halimeda and the Dasycladales, and some red algae, the Corallinales, encase their cells in a secreted skeleton of calcium carbonate. [...] In each case, the wall is rigid and essentially inorganic. It is the non-living component of cell. Some golden algae, ciliates and choanoflagellates [...] produces a shell-like protective outer covering called lorica. Some dinoflagellates have a theca of cellulose plates, and coccolithophorids have coccoliths.|$|E

Ancient tests of {{terrestrial}} fauna are commonly found in fossilized amber, although an important new study has found mid-Cretaceous <b>testate</b> amoeba (i.e., Diffligia, Cucurbitella) in ancient lake sediments.

5000|$|<b>Testate</b> amoebae (thecamoebians, {{formally}} Testacea or Thecamoeba) are a polyphyletic {{group of}} ameboid protists {{characterized by the}} presence of a test. <b>Testate</b> amoebae mainly include the filose Euglyphida (Rhizaria: Cercozoa) [...] and the lobose Arcellinida (Amoebozoa), but also some minor groups like the filose Amphitremida (Stramenopiles: Labyrinthulomycetes) and Tectofilosida (Rhizaria), and the lobose Cochliopodium and Trichosida (both in Amoebozoa).|$|E
50|$|This {{class was}} {{anticipated}} by some biologists like Jahn, who grouped all amoebae with granular pseudopodia together, but most split the lobose amoebae into <b>testate</b> Testacealobosia and naked Gymnamoebia.

50|$|Arcellinid <b>testate</b> amoebae are {{commonly}} found in soils, leaf litter, peat bogs and near/in fresh water.
