There, George is busy dealing with possible investment clients: firstly, an ambitious man named Herr Von Hussler with an elaborate money-making scheme, and then a middle-class man named John Northbrook with a simple factory project. George is furious when Mary turns up with the children, but an innocent question asked by Jane (What's more important, a good man or a good idea?) makes him realise how much his values have changed ("A Man Has Dreams") since he was an idealistic young man. He then decides to accept Northbrook's project and rejects Von Hussler's, but unfortunately <b>things</b> <b>take</b> {{a turn for the}} worse afterwards.|$|E

While preparing for the dinner, George arrives at Jerry's apartment with the song [...] "Master of the House" [...] from the musical Les Misérables stuck in his head. George and Jerry are both very nervous to meet Alton because {{he is such a}} famous author. When they are about to leave, Jerry puts on his new jacket. George is very impressed and attempts to get Jerry to reveal its cost. Kramer enters the apartment and asks for two minutes' help guarding his illegally parked car as he carries down some doves that he is looking after for a magician friend.

Michael steps in and demands an apology, but Dwight, Andy, Phyllis and Stanley threaten to quit and start their own paper company. When Michael calls their bluff and starts throwing [...] "seed money" [...] at them, Phyllis breaks down and says that they were the real victims of Michael's company, not corporate, and that they were hurt since Michael had treated them like a family and then turned on them. Michael is taken aback by her words.|$|E
500|$|When {{working with}} actors, Nolan prefers {{giving them the}} time to perform as many takes of a given scene as they want. [...] "I've {{come to realize that}} the {{lighting}} and camera setups, the technical <b>things,</b> <b>take</b> all the time, but running another take generally only adds a couple of minutes.... If an actor tells me they can do something more with a scene, I give them the chance, because it's not going to cost that much time. It can't all be about the technical issues." [...] Gary Oldman praised the director for providing a relaxed atmosphere on set, adding [...] "I've never seen him raise his voice to anyone". He also observed that Nolan would give the actors space to [...] "find things in the scene", and not just give direction for direction's sake.|$|E

If the <b>things</b> <b>taken</b> by robbery have {{undergone}} a change, he pays according to the value the things {{had at the time}} of the robbery (ch. ix.). The last chapter considers cases in which the <b>things</b> <b>taken</b> are no longer in the hands of the robber, and concludes with the warning not to buy things suspected to be stolen. With the exception of chap. vii. 7 (on certain restrictions with regard to the rearing of cattle or poultry in Palestine), there are neither halakic nor haggadic digressions in this tractate.|$|R

500|$|The Scotsmans Robert McNeil {{thought that}} the premiere was [...] "shocking, but also rather slow, as {{characters}} are established. Maybe it'll get better. In the meantime, to paraphrase Roger McGough, I came, I saw, I concurred with those who say: Rome wasn't built in an hour." [...] Similarly opinionated was The Cincinnati Posts Rick Bird, who said that like other HBO series, Rome [...] "takes {{a while to get}} going. After the first episode you will mostly be confused with a dizzying array of characters, intrigue and subplots. Hang in there. By the second episode <b>things</b> <b>take</b> shape and one should be hooked by episode three with this steamy romp through antiquity and its lusty intrigue." [...] Bird found some positive elements; the episode, he said, was [...] "enhanced by marvelous filmmaking including elaborate sets and costumes. Small-screen film art has rarely painted such a realistic picture of ancient Rome." ...|$|E
500|$|Michael and Holly {{perform a}} skit that parodies Slumdog Millionaire (called [...] "SlumDunder Mifflinaire"), {{presenting}} Dunder Mifflin trivia {{in the form}} of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?, as well as acting out torture scenes featured in the film. Nobody, except Stanley (Leslie David Baker), finds their presentation amusing, but <b>things</b> <b>take</b> {{a turn for the worse}} when they reveal that the Buffalo branch, whose staff are hearing this announcement for the first time, will be closing in the near future because of the economic recession. After reluctantly confirming this news to the Buffalo staff, David berates Michael for revealing this as it was something David told to Michael in confidence. In his own defense, Michael insists he thought they already knew about it. As Michael and Holly talk about next year's presentation, he prepares to ask for her back but stops himself, deciding not to ruin the moment. As Holly leaves with A. J., Michael says he believes he will eventually be reunited with Holly, although potentially not for a long time—and he's fine with this because [...] "I'm in no rush".|$|E
500|$|Lloyd and {{the troupe}} made their début at a mission in Nile Street, Hoxton, in 1880 and {{followed}} this with an {{appearance at the}} Blue Ribbon Gospel Temperance Mission later the same year. [...] Costumed by Matilda, they toured local doss-houses in East London, where they performed temperance songs, teaching people the dangers of alcohol abuse. [...] Eager {{to show off his}} daughter's talent, John secured her unpaid employment as a table singer at the Eagle Tavern in Hoxton, where he worked as a waiter. Among the songs she performed there was [...] "My Soldier Laddie". Together with her performances at the Eagle, Lloyd briefly contributed to the family income by making babies' boots, and, later, curled feathers for hat making. [...] She was unsuccessful at both and was sacked from the latter after being caught dancing on the tables by the foreman. She returned home that evening and declared that she wanted a permanent career on the stage. [...] Although happy to have her performing in her spare time, her parents initially opposed the idea of her appearing on the stage full-time. She recalled that when her parents [...] "saw that they couldn't kick their objections as high as [...] could kick [...] legs, they very sensibly came to the conclusion to let <b>things</b> <b>take</b> their course and said 'Bless you my child, do what you like'." ...|$|E

500|$|Sonic the Hedgehog has {{maintained}} its popularity, {{and has since}} been {{considered one of the}} greatest video games of all time. Frank Provo of GameSpot described the game as [...] "one of the best platformers of all time", noting that despite technical issues in the Game Boy Advance port [...] "after all these years, the underlying graphics, audio, and gameplay still hold up". Lucas M. Thomas of IGN agreed that it stood the test of time. Writing in The Guardian, Keith Stuart observed that Sonic the Hedgehogs emphasis on speed and pinball mechanics dramatically departs from generally accepted precepts of game design, requiring that players [...] "learn through repetition rather than observation" [...] as [...] "the levels aren't designed to be seen or even understood in one playthrough." [...] However, Stuart concluded that [...] "sometimes in Sonic, when you get better, or through sheer luck, <b>things</b> <b>take</b> off, every jump is right, every loop-the-loop is perfect, and you're in the flow, sailing above the game's strange structure... Sonic is incorrect game design and yet... it's a masterpiece." [...] Mega ranked the game its third-favorite Genesis title, and in 2001 Game Informer called it the 24th-greatest game of all time. Sonic the Hedgehog has been a commercial success; the original Genesis version sold over 15million copies by February 2009, and the mobile version had eight million paid downloads by 2008.|$|E
