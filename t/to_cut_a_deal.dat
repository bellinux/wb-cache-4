25|$|Boehner {{came into}} {{power on the}} {{momentum}} of the 2010 tea party wave. But it was that movement that gave him constant problems. He clashed with social conservatives over the debt limit, government funding, Obamacare and taxes. But his tenure will also be remembered for his complicated relationship with President Barack Obama. He and Obama tried — but repeatedly failed — <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>a</b> <b>deal</b> on a sweeping fiscal agreement.

500|$|UNITA {{carried out}} several attacks against civilians in May 2001 {{in a show}} of strength. UNITA militants {{attacked}} Caxito on 7 May, killing 100 people and kidnapping 60 children and two adults. UNITA then attacked Baia-do-Cuio, followed by an attack on Golungo Alto, a city [...] east of Luanda, a few days later. The militants advanced on Golungo Alto at 2:00pm on 21 May, staying until 9:00pm on 22 May when the Angolan military retook the town. They looted local businesses, taking food and alcoholic beverages before singing drunkenly in the streets. More than 700 villagers trekked [...] from Golungo Alto to Ndalatando, the provincial capital of Cuanza Norte, without injury. According to an aid official in Ndalatando, the Angolan military prohibited media coverage of the incident, so the details of the attack are unknown. Joffre Justino, UNITA's spokesman in Portugal, said UNITA only attacked Gungo Alto to demonstrate the government's military inferiority and the need <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>a</b> <b>deal.</b> Four days later UNITA released the children to a Catholic mission in Camabatela, a city [...] from where UNITA kidnapped them. The national organization said the abduction violated their policy towards the treatment of civilians. In a letter to the bishops of Angola, Jonas Savimbi asked the Catholic Church to act as an intermediary between UNITA and the government in negotiations. The attacks took their toll on Angola's economy. At the end of May 2001, De Beers, the international diamond mining company, suspended its operations in Angola, ostensibly on the grounds that negotiations with the national government reached an impasse.|$|E

2500|$|In {{spite of}} the terms of his {{impeachment}} banning him from elected office, Ferguson announced his candidacy for Governor in 1918. Acting Governor William P. Hobby was likely to be voted out of office in the wake of Ferguson's illegitimate candidacy. Cunningham worked behind the scenes with state representative Charles Metcalfe <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>a</b> <b>deal</b> for primary suffrage, which would allow women in Texas to vote in the primary elections but not the general. [...] If he would get a primary suffage bill passed, and signed by Governor Hobby, she would deliver him the women's votes. Metcalfe got the bill passed and Hobby signed the bill on May 26. The women conducted a grass roots campaign named Women's Hobby Clubs to deliver promised votes. [...] The group persuaded university professor Annie Webb Blanton to run for State Superintendent of Public Instruction. The women's vote helped propel Blanton to a primary victory. Blanton went on to win in the November general election and became the first woman in Texas elected to statewide [...] office.|$|E
2500|$|On May 15, 1970, police {{officers}} in Oxford, NC arrested Alfred Hood and David Washington for possessing [...] "seven sticks of dynamite, two rifles, and a pistol".

The City Manager of Charlotte, Ragland, remembered Grant as someone who [...] "was an expert in starting fires…he could start a fire in a rainstorm". Hood and Washington were subsequently jailed for possessing such deadly weapons, however after {{a short period of}} time, the two [...] "jumped bail, and fled to Canada" [...] where they were eventually returned on warrants. When the two were apprehended a second time, they decided <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>a</b> <b>deal</b> with the prosecutor that was perceived in the black community as indicative of the social climate of the time period.

2500|$|The verdict angered the Asian American {{community}} in the Detroit area and around the country. [...] Journalist Helen Zia and lawyer Liza Chan (...) led the fight for federal charges, {{which resulted in the}} men's being accused of two counts of violating Chin's civil rights, under section 245 of title 18 of the United States Code. For these charges, it was not enough that Ebens had injured Chin, but that [...] "a substantial motivating factor for the defendant's actions was Mr. Chin's race, color, or national origin, and because Mr. Chin had been enjoying a place of entertainment which serves the public." [...] Because of possible mitigating factors that could lead to reasonable doubt, such as intoxication leading to the defendant's inability to form the specific intent, the prosecution's proving the evidence of uttered racial slurs was not self-sufficient for conviction. In addition, the defense found Racine Colwell, the witness who overheard the [...] "It's because of you motherfuckers we're out of work" [...] remark, to have received some clemency on a jail sentence for a prostitution charge, which suggested that the government might have tried <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>a</b> <b>deal</b> for her testimony.|$|E
2500|$|Temple Grandin {{was born}} in Boston, Massachusetts, into a [...] wealthy family. Her mother is Anna Eustacia Purves (now Cutler), an actress, singer and granddaughter of the {{co-inventor}} for the autopilot aviation system (John Coleman Purves), {{with a degree in}} English from Harvard University. Her father was Richard McCurdy Grandin who died in 1993 in California, a real estate agent and heir to the largest corporate wheat farm business in America at the time, Grandin Farms. Grandin's parents subsequently divorced when she was 15, and her mother eventually went on to marry Ben Cutler, a renowned New York saxophonist, in 1965 (when Grandin was 18 years old). Grandin has three siblings - two sisters and a brother, with Grandin being the oldest. Grandin has described one of her sisters as being dyslexic. Her other sister is a sculptor and her brother a banker. John Livingston Grandin (Temple's paternal great grandfather) and his brother William James Grandin, were French Huguenots who drilled for oil, intending <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>a</b> <b>deal</b> with John D. Rockefeller, but the latter kept him waiting too long so he walked out before Rockefeller arrived. Then they went into banking and when Jay Cooke's firm collapsed they got thousands of acres of undeveloped land in North Dakota as collateral. They set up wheat farming in the Red River Valley with dormitories for the workers; the town of Grandin, North Dakota, is named after John Livingston Grandin. Although raised in the Episcopal religion, Temple Grandin early on gave up on a belief in a personal deity or intention in favor of what she considers a more scientific idea of God.|$|E
2500|$|In 1989, a {{widespread}} popular and armed insurgency started in Kashmir. After the 1987 state legislative assembly election, {{some of the}} results were disputed. This resulted {{in the formation of}} militant wings and {{marked the beginning of the}} Mujahadeen insurgency, which continues to this day. India contends that the insurgency was largely started by Afghan mujahadeen who entered the Kashmir valley following the end of the Soviet-Afghan War. Yasin Malik, a leader of one faction of the Jammu Kashmir Liberation Front, was one of the Kashmiris to organise militancy in Kashmir, along with Ashfaq Majeed Wani, Javaid Ahmad Mir, and Abdul Hamid Sheikh. Since 1995, Malik has renounced the use of violence and calls for strictly peaceful methods to resolve the dispute. Malik developed differences with one of the senior leaders, Farooq Siddiqui (alias Farooq Papa), for shunning demands for an independent Kashmir and trying <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>a</b> <b>deal</b> with the Indian Prime Minister. This resulted in a split in which Bitta Karate, Salim Nanhaji, and other senior comrades joined Farooq Papa. Pakistan claims these insurgents are Jammu and Kashmir citizens, and are rising up against the Indian army as part of an independence movement. Amnesty International has accused security forces in Indian-controlled Kashmir of exploiting an Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act that enables them to [...] "hold prisoners without trial". The group argues that the law, which allows security forces to detain individuals for up to two years without presenting charges violates prisoners' human rights. In 2011, the state humans right commission said it had evidence that 2,156 bodies had been buried in 40 graves over the last 20 years. The authorities deny such accusations. The security forces say the unidentified dead are militants who may have originally come from outside India. They also say that many of the missing people have crossed into Pakistan-administered Kashmir to engage in militancy. However, according to the state human rights commission, among the identified bodies 574 were those of [...] "disappeared locals", and according to Amnesty International's annual human rights report (2012) it was sufficient for [...] "belying the security forces' claim that they were militants".|$|E
