5|$|During his lifetime, Kosygin {{received}} seven Orders and two Awards from <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>state.</b> He {{was awarded}} two Hero of Socialist Labour (USSR); one being on his 60th birthday by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet in 1964, {{on this occasion}} he was also awarded an Order of Lenin and a Hammer and Sickle Gold Medal. On 20 February 1974, to commemorate his 70th birthday, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet awarded him another Order of Lenin and his second Hammer and Sickle Gold Medal. In total, Kosygin was awarded six Orders of Lenin by <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>state,</b> and one Order of the October Revolution and one Order of the Red Banner of Labour. During a state visit to Peru in the 1970s with Leonid Brezhnev and Andrei Gromyko, all three were awarded the Grand Cross of the Order of the Sun by President Francisco Morales Bermúdez. The Moscow State Textile University was named in his honour in 1981, in 1982 a bust to honour Kosygin was placed in Leningrad, present day Saint Petersburg. In 2006 the Russian Government renamed a street after him.|$|E
5|$|During the {{formation}} of <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>state,</b> in the late 1910s and early 1920s, the People's Commissariat for Finance of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR) was created. The commissariat did not differ greatly from that of Imperial Russia's Ministry of Finance and its system. The Soviet finance ministry was a heavily centralised structure, while its predecessor was not. During its humble beginnings, the main task of the People's Commissariat of Finance were: confiscation of property, robbery and requisition; printing and creating money; and taxation.|$|E

25|$|It is {{possible}} that the 1958 Nobel Prize prevented Pasternak's imprisonment due to <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>State's</b> fear of international protests. Yevgenii Pasternak believes, however, that the resulting persecution fatally weakened his father's health.|$|R
5|$|Shultz and Godson {{note that}} {{manipulated}} groups involve both official departments of <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>state,</b> {{as well as}} non-governmental organizations which lack independence from the state control itself. Specific goals exported by covert Soviet government channels and groups in the Western world were financed by Soviet intelligence operations. These covert operations were coordinated so as to have maximum impact related to major international incidents.|$|E
5|$|The term Żydokomuna {{originated}} {{in connection with}} the Russian Bolshevik Revolution and targeted Jewish communists during the Polish-Soviet War. The emergence of <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>state</b> was seen by many Poles as Russian imperialism in a new guise. The visibility of Jews in both the Soviet leadership and in the Polish Communist Party further heightened such fears. In some circles, Żydokomuna came {{to be seen as a}} prominent antisemitic stereotype expressing political paranoia.|$|E
5|$|The Ninth Five-Year Plan {{delivered}} a change: {{for the first}} time industrial consumer products out-produced industrial capital goods. Consumer goods such as watches, furniture and radios were produced in abundance. The plan still left the bulk of the state's investment in industrial capital-goods production. This outcome was not seen as a positive sign for the future of <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>state</b> by the majority of top party functionaries within the government; by 1975 consumer goods were expanding 9% slower than industrial capital-goods. The policy continued despite Brezhnev's commitment to make a rapid shift of investment to satisfy Soviet consumers and lead to an even higher standard of living. This did not happen.|$|E
50|$|In late July {{and early}} August 1939, Soviet and German {{officials}} agreed {{on most of}} the details for a planned economic agreement, and specifically addressed a potential political agreement, which <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> <b>stated</b> could only come after an economic agreement.|$|R
25|$|Christianity and Islam had the {{greatest}} number of adherents among <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>state's</b> religious citizens. Eastern Christianity predominated among Christians, with Russia's traditional Russian Orthodox Church being <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union's largest Christian denomination. About 90 percent of <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union's Muslims were Sunnis, with Shias concentrated in Azerbaijan. Smaller groups included Roman Catholics, Jews, Buddhists, and a variety of Protestant denominations.|$|R
5000|$|Despite {{a warning}} by the Comintern, German {{tensions}} were raised when <b>the</b> <b>Soviets</b> <b>stated</b> in September {{that they must}} enter Poland to [...] "protect" [...] their ethnic Ukrainian and Belorussian brethren therein from Germany; Molotov later admitted to German officials that this excuse was necessary because the Kremlin could find no other pretext for <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> invasion.|$|R
5|$|Four {{weeks into}} the campaign, the Germans {{realized}} they had grossly underestimated Soviet strength. The German troops had used their initial supplies and General Bock quickly {{came to the conclusion}} that not only had the Red Army offered stiff opposition, but German difficulties were also due to the logistical problems with reinforcements and provisions. Operations were now slowed down to allow for resupply; the delay was to be used to adapt strategy to the new situation. Hitler by now had lost faith in battles of encirclement as large numbers of Soviet soldiers had escaped the pincers. He now believed he could defeat <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>state</b> by economic means, depriving them of the industrial capacity to continue the war. That meant seizing the industrial center of Kharkov, the Donbass and the oil fields of the Caucasus in the south and the speedy capture of Leningrad, a major center of military production, in the north.|$|E
5|$|In early 1937, Tătărescu {{rejected}} the proposal of Józef Beck, Poland's Minister of Foreign Affairs, to withdraw Romania's support for Czechoslovakia and attempt a reconciliation with Hungary (the following year, Romania withdrew {{its support for}} the former, indicating, just before the Munich Agreement, {{that it was not}} in a position to guarantee Czechoslovakia's frontiers). This was accompanied by Czechoslovak initiatives to establish close contacts between the Little Entente and the Soviets: a scandal erupted in the same year, when the country's ambassador to Romania, Jan Šeba, published a volume calling for Soviet-Entente military cooperation (despite the Soviet-Romanian conflict over Bessarabia) and expressing the hope that <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>state</b> would extend its borders into West Belarus and Ukraine. Kamil Krofta, Czechoslovakia's Foreign Minister, received criticism for having prefaced the book, and, after Tătărescu paid a visit to Czechoslovak Prime Minister Milan Hodža, Šeba was recalled to Prague.|$|E
5|$|Under the 1977 Constitution of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR), the Chairman of the Council of Ministers was {{the head}} of {{government}} and the Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet {{was the head}} of state. The office of the Chairman of the Council of Ministers was comparable to a prime minister in the First World, whereas the office of the Chairman of the Presidium was comparable to a president in the First World. In the Soviet Union's seventy-year history there was no official leader of the Soviet Union office, but during most of that era there was a de facto top leader who usually led the country through the office of the Premier or the office of the General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU). In the ideology of Vladimir Lenin the head of <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>state</b> was a collegiate body of the vanguard party (see What Is to Be Done?).|$|E

5|$|For Operation Barbarossa, {{initially}} four Einsatzgruppen were created, each numbering 500–990 men {{to comprise}} a total force of 3,000. Einsatzgruppen A, B, and C {{were to be}} attached to Army Groups North, Centre, and South; Einsatzgruppe D {{was assigned to the}} 11th Army. The Einsatzgruppe for Special Purposes operated in eastern Poland starting in July 1941. The Einsatzgruppen were {{under the control of the}} RSHA, headed by Heydrich and later by his successor, SS-Obergruppenführer Ernst Kaltenbrunner. Heydrich gave them a mandate to secure the offices and papers of <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>state</b> and Communist Party; to liquidate all the higher cadres of the Soviet state; and to instigate and encourage pogroms against Jewish populations. The men of the Einsatzgruppen were recruited from the SD, Gestapo, Kriminalpolizei (Kripo), Orpo, and Waffen-SS. Each Einsatzgruppe was under the operational control of the Higher SS Police Chiefs in its area of operations. In May 1941, General Wagner and SS-Brigadeführer Walter Schellenberg agreed that the Einsatzgruppen in front-line areas were to operate under army command, while the army provided the Einsatzgruppen with all necessary logistical support. Given their main task was defeating the enemy, the army left the pacification of the civilian population to the Einsatzgruppen, who offered support as well as prevented subversion. This did not preclude their participation in acts of violence against civilians, as many members of the Wehrmacht assisted the Einsatzgruppen in rounding up and killing Jews of their own accord.|$|E

25|$|According to Lazar Fleishman, Pasternak {{was aware}} that he was taking a huge risk.
