5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the third serial, Quatermass and the Pit (1958–59), Quatermass's funding is being cut back and the Rocket Group is being handed over to military control, much to his disgust. Command is <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>handed</b> <b>over</b> to Colonel Breen and Quatermass senses that he is being forced out: however, after the events of the serial, Breen is dead, Quatermass has helped to save the world and London is recovering from chaos.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{capitulation}} of Germany in November 1918, {{the majority}} of the High Seas Fleet was to be interned in the Royal Navy base in Scapa Flow. Bayern was listed as one of the ships <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>handed</b> <b>over.</b> On 21 November 1918, the ships to be interned, under the command of Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter, sailed from their base in Germany for the last time. The fleet rendezvoused with the British light cruiser , before meeting a flotilla of 370 British, American, and French warships for the voyage to Scapa Flow.|$|E

25|$|The Italian {{nationalist}} {{and poet}} Gabriele D'Annunzio was angered {{by what he}} considered <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>handing</b> <b>over</b> {{of the city of}} Fiume. On September 12, 1919, he led around 2,600 troops from the Royal Italian Army (the Granatieri di Sardegna), Italian nationalists and irredentists, into a seizure of the city, forcing the withdrawal of the inter-Allied (American, British and French) occupying forces. Their march from Ronchi dei Legionari to Fiume became known as the Impresa di Fiume ("Fiume Exploit").|$|R
5|$|For the {{remaining}} {{week of the}} fighting in South Norway, Kommandøren was docked at Kvamsøya, immobilized by a damaged axle. As part of the ceasefire agreement accepted by the Norwegians in Western Norway in the evening of 1 May 1940, Kommandøren was <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>handed</b> <b>over</b> to the Germans, along with the ferry Lærdal and 40 smaller boats. The transfer of the ships occurred at Lærdal on 2 May, and the ceasefire was announced on 3 May. The Germans used Kommandøren and the other vessels for a limited period to transport troops to occupy various places in Western Norway.|$|E
5|$|March-Phillipps {{was killed}} during Operation Aquatint in September 1942. On the same mission, Hayes evaded capture {{and crossed the}} Spanish border, only <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>handed</b> <b>over</b> to the Germans who kept him in solitary {{confinement}} for nine months before he was executed by firing squad on 13 July 1943. Appleyard later joined the Special Air Service, and {{on the same day}} that Hayes was executed Appleyard was reported missing when his plane failed to return from a mission. Lassen would also join the Special Air Service; he was awarded two bars to his MC and promoted to major before receiving a posthumous Victoria Cross in Italy in 1945.|$|E
5|$|Extensive {{damage was}} found by the diver's {{preliminary}} examination of the ship, including tearing and inch-sized gaps in Astrids hull, as well as popped rivets and spread plates. The salvage company Blue Ocean, of Castletownbere, were appointed to recover the ship. The plans for the salvage operation consisted of removing around 3.5 tonnes of diesel fuel from the ship's fuel tanks, pumping {{water out of the}} ship and cutting away equipment including the rigging and masts, before a floating crane lifted the vessel from the rocks. The ship would then be taken to a nearby port <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>handed</b> <b>over</b> to the insurers. As of the end of July 2013 it was thought that the ship will never sail again, and that she would be written off as a total constructive loss. A month after sinking, Astrid was still under water.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{armistice}} with Germany in November 1918, {{the majority of}} the High Seas Fleet was to be interned in the British naval base in Scapa Flow. Bayern was listed as one of the ships <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>handed</b> <b>over,</b> though Baden initially was not. The battlecruiser , which the British believed to be completed, was requested instead. When it became apparent to the Allies that Mackensen was still under construction, Baden was ordered to replace it. On 21 November 1918, the ships to be interned, under the command of Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter, sailed from their base in Germany for the last time. The fleet rendezvoused with the light cruiser , before meeting a massive flotilla of some 370 British, American, and French warships for the voyage to Scapa Flow. Baden arrived at Scapa Flow separately on 14 December 1918.|$|E
5|$|Nerpa {{was laid}} {{down at the}} Komsomolsk-on-Amur {{shipyard}} in 1993, but its completion was delayed {{for nearly a decade}} {{due to a lack of}} funds caused by the economic crisis of the early 1990s. The partly constructed vessel was mothballed until 2004, when Rosprom (the Federal Agency for Industry) signed an agreement with the Indian government to complete the submarine and lease it to the Indian Navy. The vessel was intended to be completed by 2007, but underwent further delays. In 2007, it was transferred to the Vostok shipyard in the closed city of Bolshoy Kamen, Primorsky Krai, for fitting-out. It was launched in October 2008 for sea trials, following which it was due <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>handed</b> <b>over</b> to the Russian Defence Ministry. Reports in the Indian media suggest that the resumption of construction was underwritten with Indian funding.|$|E
5|$|On 11 November 1918, the Armistice took effect; {{according}} to its terms, eleven battleships and five battlecruisers were to be interned in Scapa Flow {{for the duration of}} negotiations for the peace treaty. Posen was not among the ships interned, and she was instead decommissioned on 16 December. The ships in Scapa Flow were scuttled by their crews on 21 June 1919 to prevent them from being seized by the Allies. As a result, Posen and the other battleships that remained in Germany were seized as replacements for the ships that had been lost. On 5 November, Posen was stricken from the German navy list <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>handed</b> <b>over</b> to Great Britain. The ship was transferred on 13 May 1920; on 1 November 1920, she was driven ashore at Hawkcraig, Fife, Scotland. The British subsequently sold Posen to ship-breakers in the Netherlands. She was broken up in Dordrecht in 1922.|$|E

50|$|The {{history of}} City Park {{started with the}} {{allocation}} of an allotment for the Government Cottage in 1807 {{at the base of}} Windmill Hill. In the 1820s, the Launceston Horticultural Society acquired the neighbouring allotment to the immediate west of the government gardens for use as a botanical garden. In 1863, the Launceston Horticultural Society <b>handed</b> the gardens <b>over</b> to the Launceston City Council along with the government gardens <b>to</b> create what <b>was</b> named 'Peoples Park'. Over time, the Government Cottage ended up as rental accommodation and fell into disrepair until it <b>to</b> <b>was</b> <b>handed</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the council in 1885 and demolished.|$|R

5|$|On 3 June, Van der Sloot {{was arrested}} near Curacaví by the Investigations Police of Chile while {{traveling}} {{in a rented}} taxi on Highway 68 between the coastal city of Viña del Mar and the capital of Santiago. He was found with a laptop, foreign currency, a business card case, detailed charts of ocean currents around Lima, and bloody clothes. His phone's SIM card was missing, which made mobile phone tracking of his location impossible. He told Chilean police that unidentified armed robbers hid {{in the hotel room}} and killed Flores when she disobeyed their order to be quiet. Van der Sloot's Dutch attorney claimed that his client {{was on his way to}} Santiago to turn himself in. He was subsequently expelled and transported by Chilean police in a Cessna 310 back to Arica <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>handed</b> <b>over</b> to Peruvian authorities at the Chacalluta border crossing on 4 June.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 14 July around 900 people formed outside the Bastille, {{primarily}} working-class members of the nearby faubourg Saint-Antoine, but also including some mutinous soldiers and local traders. The crowd had gathered {{in an attempt to}} commandeer the gunpowder stocks known to be held in the Bastille, and at 10:00 am de Launay let in two of their leaders to negotiate with him. Just after midday, another negotiator was let in to discuss the situation, but no compromise could be reached: the revolutionary representatives now wanted both the guns and the gunpowder in the Bastille <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>handed</b> <b>over,</b> but de Launay refused to do so unless he received authorisation from his leadership in Versailles. By this point {{it was clear that the}} governor lacked the experience or the skills to defuse the situation.|$|E
5|$|The {{crowds in}} London {{traditionally}} claimed {{a right to}} elect the king of England, and they proclaimed Stephen the new monarch, believing that he would grant the city new rights and privileges in return. Henry of Blois delivered {{the support of the}} church to Stephen: Stephen was able to advance to Winchester, where Roger, who was both the Bishop of Salisbury and the Lord Chancellor, instructed the royal treasury <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>handed</b> <b>over</b> to Stephen. On 15 December, Henry delivered an agreement under which Stephen would grant extensive freedoms and liberties to the church, in exchange for the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Papal Legate supporting his succession to the throne. There was the slight problem of the religious oath that Stephen had taken to support the Empress Matilda, but Henry convincingly argued that the late King had been wrong to insist that his court take the oath.|$|E

50|$|When in February 1917, {{one morning}} a {{pamphlet}} of the left-wing party USPD appeared on board, this caused great excitement. Stumpf wrote that this leaflet contained along with much truth, a motley mixture of silly platitudes and phrases. Many sheets seem <b>to</b> have <b>been</b> <b>handed</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the superiors, according to Stumpf's perception.|$|R
5000|$|Regarding {{the fate}} of the Ugo score, there is some {{conflicting}} evidence.

5|$|A railway from Grantham to Sleaford {{opened in}} 1857. This was {{extended}} to Boston in 1859, and so offered direct competition to the navigation. The decline was rapid. Income fell from £981 in 1858 to £168 in 1868, and the share price dropped from £40 to £10 between 1860 and 1863. The company was trading at a loss by 1871, and although an Act of Abandonment was obtained on 17 June 1878, the navigation did not actually close until 14 May 1881, which was also {{the date of the}} final meeting of the proprietors. The Act required the company to fill in the three locks nearest to Sleaford, but there were special provisions for the remaining structures. The next three were on a stretch of river bordered by land belonging to Haverholme Priory, and were to be put into good order and handed over to Murray Finch Hatton, earl of Winchilsea & Nottingham, who owned the Priory. He could then maintain or abandon them, but was required to construct sluices if he chose to abandon them. The final lock was <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>handed</b> <b>over</b> to the commissioners of the River Witham, once it was in good order, and they could remove the gates and fill in the lock if they chose to do so.|$|E
5|$|On 18 November, the Tripartite Commission, {{consisting}} of representatives of Croatia, the JNA and the ECMM, discussed methods of evacuation {{with representatives of}} the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), the Médecins Sans Frontières and the Malteser International. On the night of 18/19 November, Rašeta and Croatian Health Minister Andrija Hebrang signed an agreement on the evacuation. The agreement guaranteed that the evacuees would travel via the route Lužac suburb–Bogdanovci–Marinci–Zidine junction–Nuštar–Vinkovci. They were <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>handed</b> <b>over</b> to international authorities at the Zidine junction, the hospital was to be placed under the contol of the ICRC and the ECMM was to oversee the entire operation. Hebrang notified the hospital director Vesna Bosanac of the agreement and told her that ICRC teams would arrive. That evening Siniša Glavašević, a radio reporter who had covered the entire course of the siege from within the city, broadcast his final report from the hospital. Glavašević himself hoped to leave the city with the ICRC, fearing for his life should the Serb paramilitaries capture him.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after taking}} power, the extremist {{leaders of the}} {{revolution}} had begun constructing fortifications on Eetioneia, a dominant point in {{the entrance to the}} harbor of Piraeus, ostensibly to protect the harbor against an attack from the fleet at Samos. With internal dissent increasing, they joined these new fortifications to existing walls to form a redoubt defensible against attacks from land or sea, which contained a large warehouse into which the extremists moved most of the city's grain supply. Theramenes protested strongly against the building of this fortification, arguing that its purpose was not to keep the democrats out, but <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>handed</b> <b>over</b> to the Spartans; Thucydides testifies that his charges were not without substance, as the extremists were actually contemplating such an action. Initially cautious (as enemies of the regime had been executed before), Theramenes and his party were emboldened and galvanized into action by several events. First, a Peloponnesian fleet, ostensibly dispatched to assist anti-Athenian forces on Euboea, was moving slowly up the coast of the Peloponnese; Theramenes charged that this fleet was planning to seize the fortifications on Eetioneia, in collaboration with the extremists. Second, an Athenian militiaman, apparently acting on orders from conspirators higher in the ranks of the government, assassinated Phrynichus, the leader of the extremist faction. He escaped, but his accomplice, an Argive, was captured; the prisoner, under torture, refused to state the name of his employer. With the extremists unable to take effective action in this case, and with the Peloponnesian fleet overrunning Aegina (a logical stopping point on the approach to Piraeus), Theramenes and his party decided to act.|$|E

5000|$|There were {{protests in}} {{different}} parts of India over the knighthood, including one in Kanpur led by the AJ Fareedi Association denouncing Britain and chanting slogans against Rushdie. The Islamic Centre of India began a petition campaign with the end result <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>handing</b> <b>over</b> a banner <b>to</b> the British High Commissioner in New Delhi covered with thousands of signatures. The centre's general secretary, Maulana Khalid Rasheed Farangimahli, announced in his Friday sermon that by honouring Rushdie the UK [...] "has acted against the whole Muslim community around the world." [...] He demanded the Indian government alert Britain of their outrage. The leaders of the Sunni Board of India also condemned the move in a Friday meeting, likewise they demanded the Indian government express their anger to the British.|$|R
