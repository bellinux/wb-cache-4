5|$|These powers {{included}} {{the ability to}} both restrict tribal powers or to relax such restrictions. Congress has done both, {{such as in the}} withdrawal of federal recognition of the Menominee tribe with the Menominee Termination Act in 1954, and the Menominee Restoration Act to restore tribal recognition and powers. The earlier decisions in Duro, Wheeler, and Oliphant dealt with cases where Congress had restricted a tribe's inherent powers but pointed at nothing in the Constitution or established precedent that prohibits Congress from relaxing such restrictions. The decision in Duro was one of federal common law, and it is clear that Congress has <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> that law. Since the power exercised by the Spirit Lake Sioux Tribe was that of inherent tribal sovereignty, double jeopardy did not attach.|$|E

The progress of mankind on Earth caused Heaven to physically deteriorate. Finally, {{on the day of}} the San Francisco earthquake, God abandoned Heaven. The Angel brings Prior a message for mankind—"stop moving!"—in the belief that if man ceases to progress, Heaven will be restored. Prior confides this vision to Belize, but Belize believes that Prior is projecting his own fears of abandonment into an elaborate hallucination.|$|E

25|$|Emmet {{finds himself}} in the human world as a Lego minifigure unable to move. The events of the story are being played out by a little boy named Finn on his father's {{expansive}} Lego set in their basement. His father—"the Man Upstairs"—comes {{home from work and}} chastises his son for ruining the set by creating variations of different playsets, and proceeds to permanently rebuild and glue his perceived perfect creations together (causing Lord Business' forces to regain the upper hand as a result). Realizing the danger his friends are in, Emmet wills himself to move and gains Finn's attention. Finn returns Emmet and the Piece of Resistance to the set, where Emmet now possesses the powers of a Master Builder and confronts Business. Meanwhile, Finn's father looks at his son's creations and realizes that Finn had based the villainous Business on him and his perfectionism. Through a speech Emmet gives Business, Finn tells his father that he is special and has <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> everything. Finn reconciles with his father, which plays out as Business having a change of heart, capping the Kragle, and ungluing his victims with mineral spirits. Emmet is hailed as a hero, and begins a relationship with Wyldstyle with Batman's blessing.|$|E

She also said that the popular domestic novels of the 19th century, including Uncle Tom's Cabin, were remarkable for their [...] "intellectual complexity, ambition, and resourcefulness"; and that Uncle Tom's Cabin offers a [...] "critique of American society far more devastating than any delivered by better-known critics such as Hawthorne and Melville." ...|$|E

500|$|An Ideal World has {{received}} mixed reviews from Western critics, who generally praised the book's artwork and second half {{but did not}} like the beginning. School Library Journal's Lori Henderson reviewed An Ideal World positively; she praised the [...] "Wizard of Oz feel" [...] ending and the message that A You [...] "controls his life, and he has <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> it". Henderson called the characters [...] "great" [...] and the world [...] "fantastic", also noting that the [...] "cartoonish" [...] and [...] "exaggerated" [...] artwork worked with the story. However, she remarked that the beginning of An Ideal World was [...] "slow and plodding" [...] and could [...] "leave you wondering if it's ever going to go anywhere". Another School Library Journal critic, Joanna Fabicon, felt that the lessons and themes were [...] "unimaginative", which made the artwork [...] "a waste of visual whimsy".|$|E
500|$|Cook reads {{further into}} the concept of child {{empowerment}} in Joe 90, writing that the series creates a [...] "technological utopia" [...] around youth, remarking, [...] "Through the character of Joe, his brain hardwired {{at the start of}} each episode into the BIG RAT supercomputer, the young are shown to be literally at one with technology." [...] He adds that the instant access to brain patterns that the BIG RAT affords to Joe may be interpreted as heralding the development of the Internet over a decade after Joe 90 was produced. With his intellectual horizons broadened, Joe becomes the manifestation of homo superior, yet his youthfulness grants him <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> the fraught political world in ways that no adult could due to the limitations of their imagination. In this respect, Cook holds up Joe 90 as a precursor to the 1970s television series The Tomorrow People, which also concerned ideas of human transcendence in children. This idea, Cook says, was evident in the title of Joe 90 itself: [...] "no longer is he a nine-year-old boy but instead his status and capacities have been multiplied tenfold to transform him into agent 'Joe 90', his name an appealing futuristic echo of the then distant year of 1990." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} of Elsa was widely praised by reviewers for her multifaceted, evolving personality. Matt Goldberg of Collider.com commented {{that she was}} [...] "an incredibly sympathetic character" [...] while Deepanjana Pal of First Post (India) praised the decision to rewrite her as a protagonist and said, [...] "Elsa is no evil, frosty vision of twisted and toxic maternity like the original Snow Queen. She's {{a young woman in}} difficult circumstances, frightened, trying to understand her abilities and burdened by expectation and convention. It's easy to sympathise with her and marvel at her ability when she builds her spectacular palace in the mountains. Next to her, Anna is very much a child who needs to grow up and she does {{in the course of the}} film." [...] Stuff.co.nz's James Croot compared her [...] "humiliation and exile" [...] to that of Simba in The Lion King. Katherine Webb, a reviewer for Wall St. Cheat Sheet, said that the scenes depicting Elsa gaining confidence and individuality delivered [...] "an exciting message to send to young girls looking for a new princess role model". Gary Wright of Rotoscopers state [...] "Her mental anguish and uncontrollable powers define modern feminism.
