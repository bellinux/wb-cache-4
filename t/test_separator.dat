Test separators can be vertical, horizontal, or spherical. They can be two-phase or three-phase. They can be permanently installed or portable (skid or trailer mounted). Test separators can be equipped with various types of meters for measuring the oil, gas, and/or water for potential tests, periodic production tests, marginal well tests, etc.|$|E

40|$|It is the {{objective}} of the present project to further develop the triboelectrostatic separation (TES) process developed at the Federal Energy Technology Center and test the process at a proof-of-concept (POC) scale. This process has a distinct advantage over other coal cleaning processes in that it does not entail costly steps of dewatering. The POC-scale unit is to developed based on (1) the charge characteristics of coal and mineral matter that can be determined using the novel online tribocharge measuring device developed at Virginia Tech, and (2) the results obtained from bench-scale TES tests conducted on three different coals. At present, the project is at the stage of engineering design, which has three subtasks, Charger <b>Tests,</b> <b>Separator</b> <b>Tests,</b> and Final POC Design. Work accomplished during the current reporting period pertains to the first two subtasks...|$|R

The tribofilm formations {{as well as}} the chemical and mechanical degradation for frictional interfaces can be different for the choice of the lubricant conditions. The present investigations revealed the effects of water contamination in automatic transmission fluid (ATF) not only on the frictional performance, but also on the friction interfaces. The surface profiles of the <b>tested</b> <b>separator</b> plates, the EDS-SEM (Scanning Electron Microscopy-Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy) analysis of the friction interfaces and optical microscopy for the used friction liners showed the difference in surface morphology, adsorption of additive elements, permeability and porosity for a humid clutch environment.

50|$|A <b>Test</b> <b>separator</b> which {{determines the}} phase flow rates by {{physical}} {{separation of the}} liquid from the gas, with each phase then metered separately. This method provides information on all phases which can then be {{used to calculate the}} correction required for a meter and to check the gas flow through the meter. The pressure and temperature at the <b>test</b> <b>separator</b> should be the same as at the wet gas flow meter or the gas and liquid flow rates must be corrected for the conditions at the meter as phases could be different from those measured.|$|E
50|$|Conventional {{solutions}} concerning two- and three-phase metering systems require {{expensive and}} cumbersome <b>test</b> <b>separators,</b> high maintenance, and field personnel intervention. These conventional solutions do not {{lend themselves to}} continuous automated monitoring or metering. Moreover, with diminishing oil resources, oil companies are now frequently confronted {{with the need to}} recover hydrocarbons from marginally economical reservoirs. In order to ensure economic viability of these accumulations, the wells may have to be completed subsea, or crude oil from several wells sent to a common production facility with excess processing capacity. The economic constraints on such developments do not lend themselves to the continued deployment of three-phase separators as the primary measurement devices. Consequently, viable alternatives to three-phase separators are essential. Industry’s response is the multiphase flow meter (MPFM).|$|R
40|$|The {{improvement}} {{in the performance of}} a conventional laser ion source in the laser ion source and trap (LIST) project is presented, which envisages installation of a repeller electrode and a linear Paul trap/ion guide structure. This approach promises highest isobaric purity and optimum temporal and spatial control of the radioactive ion beam produced at an online isotope separator facility. The functionality of the LIST was explored at the offline <b>test</b> <b>separators</b> of University of Mainz (UMz) and ISOLDE/CERN, using the UMz solid state laser system. Ionization efficiency and selectivity as well as time structure and transversal emittance of the produced ion beam was determined.

40|$|An {{integrated}} gas-solids separator and stripper was developed, tested, and {{optimized for}} a circulating fluidized bed (CFB) downer at the Institute for Chemicals and Fuels from Alternative Resources (ICFAR) at Western University. The downer, designed for pyrolytic co-processing of heavy oil and biomass to valuable liquid fuels and chemicals, capitalizes on the plug flow behavior of gravity-assisted downward gas-solids flow, {{which has been}} proven in previous work. However, {{the effect of the}} reactor exit on unit performance has not been studied. Therefore, a comprehensive assessment of the gas-solids separator performance in a 0. 07 m diameter, 1. 34 m tall cold model downer was done in this thesis. A novel, fast and cost effective pressure-response-based gas RTD measurement technique was developed that was able to screen potential separator designs. Several other conventional experimental methods, including solids RTD measurement using phosphorescent tracer and stripping efficiency measurement using CO 2 tracer, were used to further assess the separator performance. The separator performance was found to be strongly dependent on the separator cone diameter. A novel, objective Separator Performance Index (SPI) was developed to assess separator performance in a comprehensive manner. Separator performance was shown to increase dramatically with the separator cone size. A 6. 3 cm diameter, 60 ° internal angle cone-shaped separator performed best among several <b>tested</b> <b>separator</b> designs in terms of maximum solids collection efficiency (3 ̆e 99. 9...|$|R
50|$|To obtain {{individual}} well flow rates, it {{is common}} to use a smaller <b>test</b> <b>separator.</b> This is an isolated and down-scaled processing system in parallel with the normal flows. Regularly, for example once a month per well, the flow from one and only one selected well is led into the <b>test</b> <b>separator</b> for determining well flow rate for the selected well. The separator divides the flow from the well into the streams of individual products which typically are oil, gas and water, but may include natural-gas condensate. Contamination may also be removed and fluid samples collected.|$|E

We set up a magnetic separator consisting of an acrylic pipe located between the magnetic poles of a face-to-face superconducting bulk magnet. We <b>tested</b> the <b>separator</b> under both high-gradient magnetic separation (HGMS) and open-gradient magnetic separation (OGMS).

40|$|Intelligent well {{systems are}} {{installed}} in production or injection wells, to increase {{the total amount of}} produced hydrocarbons. An intelligent well system has the advantages of being able to set different choke openings, using hydraulic operated sleeves to regulate the flow of produced or injected fluids. The procedure of operating the choke from surface without the use of any intervention work, is both economical and less time consuming. Combining the efficiency of intelligent well systems and down hole monitoring systems, such as pressure and temperature gauges, allows for production optimisation. If the down hole monitoring system also is fitted with a multiphase flow meter, surface <b>test</b> <b>separators</b> could be unnecessary. Multilateral wells are used to reach several pay zones, either within the same reservoir or in different smaller reservoirs. A multilateral well is a single bore well, at the surface, with one or several branches going out from the main bore. This method of drilling is economical and less time consuming. The equipment costs are lower, due to the need for only one wellhead, less casing costs, lower rig charge etc. Seeing as one only have to drill one main bore, as opposed to drilling separate wells where all wells must be drilled from the seabed, the method is also time saving. Combining these two solutions, the well will produce from several zones in different reservoirs into one main bore. The production can be controlled and regulated for each zone continuously. This thesis will describe the equipment used in a combined intelligent well and multilateral solution...|$|R
50|$|The Accuflow Multiphase Metering System is {{an example}} of advance <b>test</b> <b>separator.</b> It {{separates}} gas from liquid for 2 Phase measurement. The main principle of the Accuflow is to effectively separate the free gas from the liquid phase and to measure each phase independently, but with more automation than a conventional seperator. With complete separation, the measurement equipment used in each phase can be utilized to their maximum effectiveness and potential.The separation of gas and liquid occurs in the Accuflow in 2 stages. Stage 1, the liquid enters a vertical pipe at a downward tangential angle creating a cyclonic action in the pipe. This cyclonic action pushes the liquid towards the pipe wall and enables the majority of the gas to release {{to the center of the}} pipe and travel up to the gas run. The liquid with some remaining gas is carried into a secondary stage of separation.|$|E
40|$|When {{operators}} {{must decide}} between a traditional {{approach to the}} production facilities and one including multiphase flow meters (MPFM), they must compare the capital and operating expenditures (CAPEX and OPEX) of each solution. In order to achieve this, CAPEX and OPEX for the same brand of <b>test</b> <b>separator</b> and multiphase flow meter were obtained. A deterministic economic model was developed for evaluating the economics of MPFM and Test Separators. Two cases were considered. Case A considered {{whether it will be}} more economical to replace a <b>test</b> <b>separator</b> with a multiphase flow meter when the <b>test</b> <b>separator</b> is already in place while Case B considered which is more economically viable to install between the multiphase flow meter and <b>test</b> <b>separator.</b> Net Present Value (NPV) for both cases was calculated. Case A gave an NPV of $ 72, 630. 65 while Case B gave an NPV of $ 91, 064. 83. This shows that MPFM is a more cost-effective means of obtaining well-test data. Sensitivity studies of the economic parameters were also considered and spider diagrams presented...|$|E

The performance of the separators in terms of cell operating voltage was to at least match that of state-of-the-art separators while eliminating the separator problems.

40|$|One of {{the motivations}} for {{property}} testing of boolean functions {{is the idea}} that testing can serve as a preprocessing step before learning. However, in most machine learning applications, the ability to query functions at arbitrary points in the input space is considered highly unrealistic. Instead, the dominant query paradigm in applied machine learning has been that of active learning, where the algorithm may ask for examples to be labeled, but only from among those that exist in nature. That is, the algorithm may make a polynomial number of draws from the underlying distribution D and then query for labels, but only of points in its sample. In this work, we bring this well-studied model in learning to the domain of testing. We show that for a number of important properties for learning, testing can still yield substantial benefits in this setting. This includes testing whether data satisfies the “cluster assumption”, <b>testing</b> linear <b>separators,</b> <b>testing</b> the large-margin assumption in low-dimensional spaces, and testing unions of intervals. In most of these cases, we show active testing requires substantially fewer label requests than passive testing (where the algorithm must pay for labels on every example drawn from D), or active or passive learning. For example, testing the cluster assumption can be done with O(1) label requests using active testing, but requires Ω (√ N) labeled examples for passive testing and Ω(N) for learning, where N is the number of clusters; a similar pattern holds for unions o...|$|R

40|$|Accurate {{flow rate}} {{measurements}} {{are very important}} in production testing. Originally small and insignificant deviations could propagate in subsequent applications where flow rate data is used as input parameter. Vx multiphase flow meters give much more information compared to conventional <b>test</b> <b>separators.</b> This extra data {{can be used for}} extra flow rate validation on the measurements, in order to find out whether it is possible {{to make sense of the}} data and if it is applicable on the long term and viable for further applications. Firstly, a comprehensive literature review has been done on current existing validation methods which gave a coherent overview. This work was used to define methods to detect measurement issues which can occur during a production test, defined by experts with considerable field experience. An adjusted choke model is presented which could be run in series with a Vx meter, which is able to detect: a drift in the differential pressure sensor; the under- or overestimation of the calculated gas rate or whether the meter is operating within the designed operation envelope or not. The choke model is tested on 96 data points from actual production tests with satisfactory results for fixed choke data. In addition, a methodology is developed to detect whether a production test has become stable or not. The method is translated into an algorithm which can be run on Vx meter output to decide in an automated fashion if a production test can be concluded, yielding representative production data. The method is tested on 700 production tests in order to define the model thresholds, which showed that the majority of the tests could have been concluded earlier. It has been found that by analyzing the statistical properties of the data it is possible to observe flow pattern transition. Furthermore, by representing certain parameters in the frequency domain, slug flow regimes can be detected and the corresponding slug flow periodicity can easily be subtracted from the data.

The oil {{which was used}} in this model has 42 APIo, 725 SCF/STB, and 1850 psi as oil gravity, gas oil ratio, and bubble point pressure, respectively. It is known that compositional models are the most time-consumed models due to the number of components in the typical reservoir oil. In our model, we have 34 components so that would take a long time for the simulator to complete running one scenario. The common practice in numerical simulation for such situation is the careful lump of reservoir oil components into a short representative list of pseudo-components. These pseudo-components would be acceptable if they match the laboratory-measured phase behavior data. The supplied data for reservoir oil need to have a description of associated single carbon numbers and their fractions, saturation pressure <b>test</b> results, <b>separator</b> results, constant composition expansion test results, differential liberation test results, and swelling test results.
