The 8-inch guns were mounted in four twin Mark XII turrets amidships and the 7-inch guns were placed in casemates in the hull. The 8-inch guns were the Mark VI type, and they fired [...] shells at a muzzle velocity of [...] The 7-inch Mark I guns fired a [...] shell at 2,700ft/s. These guns were later removed during World War I and converted for use on <b>tracked</b> <b>gun</b> carriages in France. The outfit per gun was 100 shells for both types.|$|E

50|$|A second {{characteristic}} is {{the form}} of propulsion. Modern equipment can either be towed or self-propelled (SP). A towed gun fires {{from the ground and}} any inherent protection is limited to a gun shield. Towing by horse teams lasted throughout World War II in some armies, but others were fully mechanized with wheeled or <b>tracked</b> <b>gun</b> towing vehicles by the outbreak of that war. The size of a towing vehicle depends on the weight of the equipment and the amount of ammunition it has to carry.|$|E

50|$|Each weapon, from {{machine gun}} to 88mm, has a {{different}} sound, recoil and ammunition types. The tanks also sustain realistic battle damage. Hits to the {{different areas of the}} tank, depending on armour type, range, angle and power of the gun, produce a different effect, such as <b>track,</b> <b>gun,</b> gun turret or mount damage. Individual crew members can be killed or wounded, affecting the operation of the tank. Engine damage effects the tank's speed, or can disable it altogether. A repair and reload area can be used to replace injured or killed crew, or to repair damaged tanks.|$|R

50|$|The APG-65 was {{developed}} in the late 1970s and has been operational since 1983. The radar includes a velocity search (to provide maximum detection range capability against nose aspect targets), range-while-search (to detect all-aspect targets), track-while-scan (which, when combined with an autonomous missile such as AIM-120, gives the aircraft a fire-and-forget capability), single target <b>track,</b> <b>gun</b> director and raid assessment (which enables the operator to expand the region centred on a single tracked target, permitting radar separation of closely spaced targets) operating modes.|$|R

Without a weapon, the {{striation}} pattern can be uploaded to a database such as the National Integrated Ballistic Identification Network (NIBIN) maintained by the ATF or the United Kingdom's National Ballistics Intelligence Service (NABIS). Information uploaded to these databases can be used to <b>track</b> <b>gun</b> crimes and to link crimes together. Maintainers of these databases recommend that every recovered firearm be test fired and the resulting known exemplar be uploaded into the database.|$|R

5000|$|While {{some groups}} have {{advocated}} laws requiring all firearms sold be test-fired and registered {{in such a}} system, success has been mixed. In 2005, a Maryland State Police report recommended a law requiring all handguns sold in the state be registered in their IBIS system be repealed, as {{at the cost of}} $2.5 million the system had not produced [...] "any meaningful hits". The Maryland system was shut down in 2015 due to its ineffectiveness.

Gun Runner continued to stride out well but succumbed to Arrogate, who had overcome a terrible start to record a dominant win. Gun Runner's second-place finish earned him 2 million dollars.

50|$|An early-warning radar is any {{radar system}} used {{primarily}} for the long-range detection of its targets, i.e., allowing defences to be alerted {{as early as possible}} before the intruder reaches its target, giving the air defences the maximum time in which to operate.

5000|$|Three {{events will}} occur during gameplay, {{with the time}} left until the event shown on-screen: 1. Warship Attack, which {{triggers}} 3 warships to enter the arena on the water. The warships have very high health, and are loaded with a <b>tracking</b> <b>gun.</b> Destroying one gives a lot of points, but only because the warships are hard to destroy without dying a lot. However, when all are destroyed, there might be another wave of warships coming. 2. Space Wars, which sends you to space for 5 minutes. In this, if you suffer engine failure, you will just float in place, the water is replaced with another boundary, and the power ups do not move. The [...] "King" [...] still gets the double health, but also gets a special gun that cannot be changed. The gun is like the basic gun, but has slower reload and is more damaging. There are also asteroids, and when you shoot them, they give a point boost, but if you run into them, you will die. 3. Sudden Death, in which players compete for the highest kill count in a set amount of time. There are no powerups, and the only available weapon is an instant-killing red railgun.|$|R
