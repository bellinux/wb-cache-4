The label ran into difficulty {{over the use of}} the Museo del Prado-owned painting, which was incorrectly perceived in the US as being anti-religious, featuring immoral scenes, and was thus rejected or poorly stocked by many record shops. The original painting is in colour although it appeared on the LP in monochrome due to a printing error for the original layout and the band opted <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>way.</b> Another section of the same Bosch painting (in colour) had previously been used as an album cover two years before by Pearls Before Swine on their debut One Nation Underground.|$|E

However I reckon they clash quite a lot because she manipulates with her power play and won't drop the act {{so it would be}} very much on a love hate basis." [...] The two characters went on to have a brief sexual relationship, resulting in Connie becoming pregnant with Sam's child. Once the revelation of Connie's pregnancy had been made, Chambers asserted of the tension between the separated couple: [...] "Some of the scenes with Connie work amazingly well because we do genuinely get worked up and we like <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>way</b> until filming is finished. It's a useful tip to let the frustrations come through in your work - it makes good viewing." ...|$|E

2500|$|First, the Information and Consultation of Employees Regulations 2004, require {{undertakings}} with 50 or {{more employees}} to inform and consult on probable {{developments in the}} enterprise, changes to job structures, and contract changes - especially redundancies. Employees must voluntarily initiate an [...] "information and consultation procedure". If they do, but employers cannot find a negotiated agreement, a [...] "standard procedure" [...] model requires between 2 and 25 elected employee representatives having {{the right to be}} consulted on an ongoing basis: that is, an elected work council. A negotiated agreement can cover more issues than the model (for instance, to integrate health and safety issues in one council) if the parties choose. Crucially, consultation is not merely an exercise in management telling staff about their decisions, but requires meaningful dialogue [...] "with a view to reaching an agreement". This is [...] "an obligation to negotiate", similar to a duty to bargain in good faith. To start a procedure, at least 15 employees or 10 per cent of staff (whichever is higher) can request it. Occasionally, there could be a [...] "pre-existing" [...] council, or procedure in writing, covering all employees. If so, if it is not as good as the new method requested, and if the employer wants <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>way,</b> a ballot must be held where over 50 per cent of staff favour a new procedure. For example, in Stewart v Moray Council, after 500 teachers requested a new procedure (over 10 per cent of staff, but under 40 per cent), the employer argued that a ballot had to be held, because the existing collective agreement with the union had a protocol on information and consultation. The Employment Appeal Tribunal, rejecting the employer's claim, held the pre-existing procedure was not good enough to force a ballot, because it did not explain how the views of staff would be sought. Employer currently face penalties up to £75,000 for failure to comply with the rules, though it is far from clear this is sufficient to ensure an [...] "effective remedy" [...] under EU law.|$|E
