5|$|The series {{affected}} Square's {{business on}} several levels. The commercial failure of Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within resulted in hesitation and delays from Enix during merger discussions with Square. Square's decision to produce games {{exclusively for the}} Sony PlayStation—a move followed by Enix's decision with the Dragon Quest series—severed their relationship with Nintendo. Final Fantasy games were absent from Nintendo consoles, specifically the Nintendo 64, for seven years. Critics attribute the switch of strong third-party titles like the Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest games to Sony's PlayStation, {{and away from the}} Nintendo 64, as one of the reasons behind PlayStation being the more successful of the two consoles. The release of the Nintendo GameCube, which used optical disc media, in 2001 caught the attention of Square. To produce games for the system, Square created the shell company The Game Designers Studio and released Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles, which spawned its own metaseries within the main franchise. Final FantasyXIs lack of an online method of subscription cancellation prompted the creation of legislation in Illinois that requires internet gaming services <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>such</b> a method to the state's residents.|$|E

25|$|The {{concessions}} {{under which}} the Christchurch Tramway Company was operating were due to expire at various times between September 1899 and 1919. With this in mind it sought {{to negotiate with the}} various local bodies concerned for an extension of these concessions, both to enable it to continue its business and to provide some certainty for future investment. With public sentiment in favour of electrification, and the parlous financial state of the private tramway companies making it unlikely that they would be able <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>such</b> a service, the councils were opposed to renewing the concessions.|$|E

These estimates all place Wd1 near {{the outer edge of}} the Galactic bar, which may be significant in determining how such a massive cluster formed.|$|E
25|$|The {{expectation}} {{was that}} Koerner would prevent Spain from entering into the American Civil War {{on the side}} of the Southern slave states. Although Koerner, the Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary of the United States of America (his precise titles as ambassador) managed to accomplish this objective, he was discontented in Spain and asked the president several times for a replacement. An important reason prompting his request was that the stipend for his ambassadorship did not nearly cover the huge financial obligations expected of him at the Spanish court. Koerner had <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>such</b> funds from his private accounts. In 1864, he left the diplomatic service and returned to the United States.|$|E

25|$|This model {{assumed that}} {{supporting}} {{the development of}} an initial 20 MW of wind power capacity in a state would allow project developers and communities to work through permitting and implementation issues, providing an example for similar projects. Over time it was determined that implementing only 20 MW of wind was not sufficient <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>such</b> examples in each state, and that 100 MW of installed capacity more accurately provided clear examples of how these projects could be successfully implemented. As increasing amounts of wind capacity were installed, new challenges, including general public acceptance, transmission constraints, and grid stability emerged, so WPA added a new threshold: 1,000 MW of wind power capacity installed in a state.|$|E

25|$|Dilthey {{took some}} of his {{inspiration}} from the works of Friedrich Schleiermacher on hermeneutics, which he helped revive. Both figures are linked to German Romanticism. Schleiermacher was strongly influenced by German Romanticism which led him to place more emphasis on human emotion and the imagination. Dilthey, in his turn, {{as the author of}} a vast monograph on Schleiermacher, responds to the questions raised by Droysen and Ranke about the philosophical legitimation of the human sciences. He argues that 'scientific explanation of nature' (erklären) must be completed with a theory of how the world is given to human beings through symbolically mediated practices. <b>To</b> <b>provide</b> <b>such</b> a theory is the aim of the philosophy of the humanities—a field of study to which Dilthey dedicated his entire academic career.|$|E

25|$|The vast {{majority}} of Afghan families were never exposed to this system, {{and many of these}} families were in opposition to these programs due to the belief that it diminishes the central role of the family and inculcates children with Soviet values. With the onset of civil war after the Soviet withdrawal, the number of kindergartens dropped rapidly. By 1995, only 88 functioning facilities serving 2,110 children survived, and the Taliban restrictions on female employment eliminated all of the remaining centers in areas under their control. In 2007, there were about 260 kindergarten/pre-school centers serving over 25,000 children.

25|$|The V has {{its origins}} in the Great Exhibition of 1851, with which Henry Cole, the museum's first director, was {{involved}} in planning; initially it {{was known as the}} Museum of Manufactures, first opening in May 1852 at Marlborough House, but by September had been transferred to Somerset House. At this stage the collections covered both applied art and science. Several of the exhibits from the Exhibition were purchased to form the nucleus of the collection. By February 1854 discussions were underway to transfer the museum to the current site and it was renamed South Kensington Museum. In 1855 the German architect Gottfried Semper, at the request of Cole, produced a design for the museum, but it was rejected by the Board of Trade as too expensive. The site was occupied by Brompton Park House; this was extended including the first refreshment rooms opened in 1857, the museum being the first in the world <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>such</b> a facility.|$|E
25|$|The DMCA has {{affected}} the worldwide cryptography research community, since an argument {{can be made that}} any cryptanalytic research violates, or might violate, the DMCA. The arrest of Russian programmer Dmitry Sklyarov in 2001, for alleged infringement of the DMCA, was a highly publicized example of the law's use to prevent or penalize development of anti-DRM measures. While working for ElcomSoft in Russia, he developed The Advanced eBook Processor, a software application allowing users to strip usage restriction information from restricted e-books, an activity legal in both Russia and the United States. Paradoxically, under the DMCA, it is not legal in the United States <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>such</b> a tool. Sklyarov was arrested in the United States after presenting a speech at DEF CON and subsequently spent nearly a month in jail. The DMCA has also been cited as chilling to legitimate users, such as students of cryptanalysis (including, in a well-known instance, Professor Edward Felten and students at Princeton), and security consultants such as Niels Ferguson, who has declined to publish information about vulnerabilities he discovered in an Intel secure-computing scheme because of his concern about being arrested under the DMCA when he travels to the U.S.|$|E
