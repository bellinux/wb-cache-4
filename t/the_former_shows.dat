500|$|Two {{stories with}} {{explicit}} pornographic content survive as samples of Creangă's erotic authorship: [...] "The Tale of Ionică the Fool" [...] and [...] "The Tale of All Tales" [...] (also known as Povestea pulei, [...] "Tale of the Dick" [...] or [...] "Tale of the Cock"). <b>The</b> <b>former</b> <b>shows</b> its cunning hero having intercourse with a priest's daughter, moving between prose and verse {{to describe the}} act. [...] "The Tale of All Tales", which makes ample use of vulgar speech, recounts how a peasant disrespectful of divinity has his entire maize harvest transformed into male genitalia, but is able to turn out a profit by catering to the sexual appetites of women. The final section, seen by Gârbea as a sample of anticlerical jeers recorded by [...] "the defrocked Creangă", depicts the rape of a priest by one such sexual object. Although explicit, literary historian Alex. Ștefănescu argued, the text [...] "is refined and full of charm". While acknowledging both [...] "corrosives" [...] for their [...] "popular charm" [...] {{in the line of}} Rabelais and Geoffrey Chaucer, and noting that they still display the author's place as a [...] "great stylist", Voinescu also signaled the texts' [...] "very obvious" [...] debt to folkloric sources. In his definition, Ion Creangă is [...] "possibly the only writer" [...] to draw on the legacy of [...] "luscious popular jests" [...] found in local [...] "erotic folklore". Nevertheless, according to literary critic Mircea Iorgulescu, [...] "The Tale of All Tales" [...] may in fact be based on Parapilla, a pornographic leaflet circulating in Italian and French.|$|E

This was evidence of his growing interest in exotic subjects, which he later adapted {{to a series of}} novels, where the setting is [...] "Scythia", seen as an ancestral area of culture connecting Central Asia with the European region of Dacia (partly coinciding with present-day Romania). The home of mysterious Asiatic peoples, Sadoveanu's Scythia is notably the background to his novels Uvar and Nopțile de Sânziene. <b>The</b> <b>former</b> <b>shows</b> its eponymous character, a Yakut, exposed to the scrutiny of a Russian officer. In the latter, titled after the ancestral celebration of Sânziene during the month of June, shows a French intellectual meeting a nomadic tribe of Moldavian Rom people, who, the reader learns, are actually the descendants of Pechenegs. Călinescu notes that, in such writings, [...] "the intrigue is a pretext", again serving to depict the vast wilderness confronted with the keen eye of foreign observers. He sees Nopțile de Sânziene as [...] "the novel of millenarian immobility", and its theme as one of mythological proportions. The narrative pretexts, including the Sânziene celebration and the Rom people's social atavism, connect Nopțile... with another one of Sadoveanu's writings, 24 iunie ("June 24").|$|E
