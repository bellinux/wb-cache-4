25|$|Post-emergence, {{females have}} a pre-oviposition period {{of one to}} two days. Using their ovipositor, females lay single eggs within the plant tissue, and may lay an average of forty eggs during their lifetime. Females of S. dorsalis prefer to lay their eggs inside of young leaves and buds at the apical {{meristem}} of plants, but as populations increase, will lay their eggs within the surface of mature leaves. Depending on temperature, eggs may gestate for one to three weeks. After hatching, larvae will migrate from older leaves to the newer growth at terminals. Like many thrips, S. dorsalis appears to prefer feeding on new growth and young plants, and is often found on the newer <b>top</b> <b>leaves</b> on smaller plants, although individual plant morphology and chemistry may result in some distributional differences.|$|E

50|$|Another {{particularly}} dreaded {{disease is}} curly top, {{carried by the}} beet leafhopper, which interrupts the lifecycle. As the name implies, it has the symptom of making the <b>top</b> <b>leaves</b> of the plant wrinkle up and grow abnormally.|$|E
50|$|The larvae feed on Camellia sinensis {{and wild}} tea. The larvae attack the tea plants, making tight rolls of the bud and <b>top</b> <b>leaves</b> of young shoots. Infestation affects both the yield {{and the quality}} of the tea.|$|E
50|$|The larvae feed on Silphium integrifolium. They skeletonize {{the leaves}} of their host plant, almost always on the <b>top</b> <b>leaves</b> (those {{at or near the}} apex). Full-grown larvae are about 12 mm long. Larvae have been {{recorded}} from May to June.|$|E

50|$|Hugueninia tanacetifolia {{can reach}} {{a height of}} 20 - 100 cm. This {{perennial}} stellate herb has erect glabrous or slightly hairy stem, branched at the <b>top.</b> <b>Leaves</b> are alternate, soft, up to 20 cm long, with a short petiole, lanceolate, toothed on the edges, imparipinnate with 5-10 pairs of segments. The small yellow cruciform flowers in small racemes bloom from June to August.|$|E
50|$|Gentiana andrewsii {{blooms in}} late summer (August-October). The flowers are 2 to 4 cm long, {{typically}} a rich blue color and bottle shaped with closed mouths. The flowers are clustered {{at the top of}} the plant or in the axis of the <b>top</b> <b>leaves.</b> The stems are 30 to 60 cm long, lax in habit, producing sprawling plants with upturned ends ending with clusters of bee pollinated flowers.|$|E
5000|$|Nymphargus armatus are {{relatively}} small frogs; males measure 23 - 25 mm in snout-vent length and females 24 - 25 mm.Male Nymphargus armatus have patches of cornified nuptial spines on the thumb — hence the specific name, armatus, which means [...] "armed". Male frogs call from <b>tops</b> of <b>leaves</b> and vegetation with [...] "a soft exhaled whistle". Egg masses are found on the <b>tops</b> of <b>leaves.</b>|$|R
50|$|One of the {{processes}} used is the 'swim up' method, whereby a sperm extender {{is added to the}} donor's freshly ejaculated sperm and the test-tube is left to settle. After about half-an-hour, the lighter sperm, containing the male chromosome pair (XY), will have swum to the <b>top,</b> <b>leaving</b> the heavier sperm, containing the female chromosome pair (XX), at the bottom, thus allowing selection and storage according to sex.|$|R

50|$|When {{attractive}} intermolecular forces (e.g., van der Waals {{forces or}} hydrogen bonds) between the particles of a fluid exceed repulsive forces due to thermal motion. These forces explain ascent of sap in tall plants. An apparent negative pressure must act on water molecules {{at the top}} of any tree taller than 10 m, which is the pressure head of water that balances the atmospheric pressure. Intermolecular forces maintain cohesion of columns of sap that run continuously in xylem from the roots to the <b>top</b> <b>leaves.</b>|$|E
50|$|Downy phlox is a {{perennial}} that grows 6 - 24 in high. The stems are upright and sometimes branched near the <b>top.</b> <b>Leaves,</b> stems, and sepals {{are covered with}} hairs and the plant is sticky to the touch. Leaves are long and narrow and have pointed tips; they can be up to 3 in long and 1/8 - 1/2 in wide. The flowers grow in rounded clusters up to 3 in {{at the top of}} stems. The stems have opposite leaves. Each flower has five lobes (petals) that are pale pink, lavender, or purple, and is 1/2 - 3/4 in across.|$|E
5000|$|Laserpitium latifolium reaches {{on average}} 50 - 150 cm of height. The {{inflorescence}} has {{a diameter of}} 10 - 15 cm.

Leaflets are ovate or heart-shaped and toothed. The leaves are 3-10 cm long and 2-6 cm wide. Flowers are white, clustered in unbrels of 25-40 rays. The diameter of umbels reaches 20 - 30 cm. The flowering season is from May to August. Fruits are oblong and flattened, 5 - 10 mm long.|$|E
5000|$|The Tuscarora is a thin- to thick-bedded {{fine-grained}} to coarse-grained orthoquartzite.

Only 118 {{of these were}} made and fewer than 30 were believed to have survived by 2007. The cars were developed by Magraw Engineering and sold through Vauxhall dealerships on behalf of Crayford. The Centaur is basically a Cavalier GLS coupé 2-litre with the hard roof replaced with a soft <b>top</b> <b>leaving</b> a T-bar for strength. The floor pan was also strengthened.|$|R
5000|$|This is a {{perennial}} herb producing {{one or more}} erect stems from a scaly, hairy caudex. The stems reach a maximum height between 50 and 70 centimeters and branch near the <b>top.</b> <b>Leaves</b> are densely clustered around the caudex in a basal rosette. They are lance-shaped, leathery with hairy undersides, and up to 10 centimeters long. There are more widely spaced leaves along the stem which are 3 to 6 centimeters long. The inflorescence bears many white or purple flowers with thick, dark sepals. The fruit is a tough, hairless silique up to 10 centimeters long containing 2 rows of seeds.|$|E

50|$|Different {{strains of}} PSTVd exist and {{symptoms}} range from mild to severe. Mild strains produce no obvious symptoms. Symptoms in severe strains {{are dependent on}} environmental conditions and are most severe in hot conditions. Symptoms may be mild in initial infections but become progressively worse in the following generations. Common symptoms of severe infections include colour changes in the foliage, smaller leaves and spindle like elongation. Sprouting also occurs at a slower rate than in unaffected potatoes. Infected tomatoes are slower to show symptoms which include stunted growth with a ‘bunchy top’ caused by shortened internodes. Leaves become yellow or purple and often become curled and twisted. Necrosis eventually occurs in the veins of the bottom and middle leaves and the <b>top</b> <b>leaves</b> don’t die but are reduced in size. Fruit ripening is also affected leading to hard, small, dark green tomatoes.|$|E
50|$|When {{the bottom}} leave is moved up, air is pumped {{from the bottom}} lung into the top lung. At the same time air is leaving the bellows from the top lung through the spout, but at a slower rate. This inflates the top lung. Next the bottom leave is moved down to pull fresh air into the bellows. While this happens the weight on the <b>top</b> <b>leave</b> pushes it down, so air keeps leaving through the spout.|$|R
50|$|B. perforatus {{is a large}} {{barnacle}} which {{grows up}} to 30 mm in both diameter and height. Its shape resembles a volcano with steep sloping sides. The six fused lateral calcareous plates are pale purplish-brown and often ridged vertically. They often separate near the <b>top</b> <b>leaving</b> jagged ridges. Tissue inside the operculum is brightly coloured. Two pairs of moveable plates cover the operculum which can be sealed by a purplish-brown flap when the barnacle is exposed above water or it is not feeding.|$|R
5000|$|The duocylinder can be {{constructed}} from the 3-sphere by [...] "slicing" [...] off the bulge of the 3-sphere {{on either side of}} the ridge. The analog of this on the 2-sphere is to draw minor latitude circles at +/- 45 degrees and slicing off the bulge between them, leaving a cylindrical wall, and slicing off the <b>tops,</b> <b>leaving</b> flat <b>tops.</b> This operation is equivalent to removing select vertices/pyramids from polytopes, but since the 3-sphere is smooth/regular you have to generalize the operation.|$|R
