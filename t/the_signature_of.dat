5|$|Edwin Jarvis (portrayed by James D'Arcy) {{was charged}} with treason during the war after he forged <b>the</b> <b>signature</b> <b>of</b> his {{superior}} officer {{in an attempt to}} save the woman that would become his wife, Ana. Saved from this by Howard Stark, Jarvis becomes Stark's butler and is eventually offered to Carter as support for her mission to clear Stark's name. Befriending Carter, Jarvis came to enjoy his missions with her and chose to continue to help her with missions unrelated to Stark, such as the fight against Whitney Frost. For this, Ana became involved as well, until she was seriously injured by Frost. In retaliation, Jarvis unsuccessfully attempted to murder Frost.|$|E
5|$|First-order axiomatizations of Peano {{arithmetic}} have {{an important}} limitation, however. In second-order logic, {{it is possible to}} define the addition and multiplication operations from the successor operation, but this cannot be done in the more restrictive setting of first-order logic. Therefore, the addition and multiplication operations are directly included in <b>the</b> <b>signature</b> <b>of</b> Peano arithmetic, and axioms are included that relate the three operations to each other.|$|E

5|$|For many years, Germany {{simply had}} no battleships. The Armistice with Germany {{required}} {{that most of}} the High Seas Fleet be disarmed and interned in a neutral port; largely because no neutral port could be found, the ships remained in British custody in Scapa Flow, Scotland. The Treaty of Versailles specified that the ships should be handed over to the British. Instead, most of them were scuttled by their German crews on June 21, 1919 just before <b>the</b> <b>signature</b> <b>of</b> the peace treaty. The treaty also limited the German Navy, and prevented Germany from building or possessing any capital ships.|$|E

Two of his better forgeries were made here, Interior with Cardplayers and Interior with Drinkers, both displaying <b>the</b> <b>signature</b> <b>of</b> Pieter de Hooch.

According to Michael Mandelbaum, the agreement provided {{that the city was}} to be repopulated to serve as evidence of peaceful Syrian intentions, by doing so it would encourage the Israelis to pull back further.|$|E

5|$|Since the {{versions}} the {{two houses}} had passed were not identical, the bill {{returned to the}} House of Representatives, where on May 25, Arizona's Carl Hayden successfully moved that the House agree to the Senate amendment.

The bill passed the House, and was enacted by <b>the</b> <b>signature</b> <b>of</b> President Woodrow Wilson on June 1, 1918.|$|E
5|$|The Desmond Crough {{series was}} the first series of {{banknotes}} for Zimbabwe, which carried <b>the</b> <b>signature</b> <b>of</b> Dr. Desmond C.

The notes bear Salisbury as the name of its capital rather than Harare, as the name was changed on 18 April 1982. There are four denominations in this series: $2, $5, $10 and $20; its designs make extensive use of the Guilloché technique, heavily relied upon by banknotes of many currencies during the 1980s.|$|E

5|$|The {{bill was}} passed by the Senate on March 2, 1928 without {{recorded}} opposition and was enacted on March 7, 1928 with <b>the</b> <b>signature</b> <b>of</b> President Calvin Coolidge.

5|$|The notes had 150 minor marks that {{acted as}} {{security}} measures to identify forgeries. These were often {{assumed to be}} printing errors, and were changed between issues of notes.

Prior {{to the release of}} any notes by the Bank of England, all serial numbers were recorded in ledgers so the bank could verify its liabilities; these numbers were checked when the notes circulated back through the bank.|$|E
