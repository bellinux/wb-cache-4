25|$|Self-categorization {{theory is}} a social {{psychological}} theory that describes {{the circumstances under which}} a person will perceive collections of people (including themselves) as a group, as well as the consequences of perceiving people in group terms. Although the theory is often introduced as an explanation of psychological group formation (which was one of its early goals), it is more accurately thought of as general analysis of the functioning of categorization processes in social perception and interaction <b>that</b> <b>speaks</b> <b>to</b> issues of individual identity as much as group phenomena.|$|E
25|$|A theory <b>that</b> <b>speaks</b> <b>to</b> {{the origin}} of life on Earth and other rocky planets posits life as an {{information}} system in which information content grows because of selection. Life must start with minimum possible information, or minimum possible departure from thermodynamic equilibrium, and it requires thermodynamically free energy accessible by means of its information content. The most benign circumstances, minimum entropy variations with abundant free energy, suggest the pore space in the first few kilometres of the surface. Free energy is derived from the condensed products of the chemical reactions taking place in the cooling nebula.|$|E

25|$|Smith {{has been}} {{creating}} complicated abstract paintings and litographs since the 1970s. She employs {{a wide variety}} of media, working in painting, printmaking and richly textured mixed media pieces. Such images and collage elements as commercial slogans, sign-like petroglyphs, rough drawing, and the inclusion and layering of text are unusually intersected into a complex vision created out of the artist’s personal experience. Her works contain strong, insistent socio-political commentary <b>that</b> <b>speaks</b> <b>to</b> past and present cultural appropriation and abuse, while identifying the continued significance of the Native American peoples. She addresses today’s tribal politics, human rights and environmental issues with humor. Smith is known internationally for her philosophically centered work regarding her strong traditional beliefs and political activism.|$|E

The [...] "frat boy" [...] who mocks Andy at the restaurant was Greg Daniels' former assistant, Jonah Platt. Jay Falk, a script editor for the series, and his wife stood in for the couple buying Jim and Pam's house. Jennifer Celotta, a series writer and director, makes an appearance at Dwight's wedding. The episode's call sheet listed her character as [...] "Jen Celotta Schrute". Producer and writer Graham Wagner also makes a cameo in both Mose's group, {{as well as at}} the wedding. Many of the individuals who asked questions were writers on the show: Brent Forrester asked about seeing their lives on TV, Amelie Gillette asked the question regarding Jim giving up Athlead, Steve Burgess asked if the camera changed the characters' behavior, Steve Hely asked if life has no meaning, Allison Silverman made the statement that Jim is attractive, and Dan Sterling asked what was in the teapot. Daniels' wife, Susanne Daniels, was the Q moderator. Daniels himself appeared during the documentary after-party along with executive producer Howard Klein, editors David Rogers and Claire Scanlon, script supervisor Veda Semarne, first assistant director Rusty Mahmood, prop master Phil Shea, and casting director Allison Jones.

[...] In his review for Blender, Rob Sheffield stated [...] "The days are gone when U2 were {{trying to keep it}} simple—at this point, the lads have realized that over-the-top romantic grandiosity is the style that suits them, so they come on like the cosmic guitar supplicants they were born to be." [...] Uncut magazine's Andrew Mueller commented, [...] "It's U2's least immediate album—but there's something about it that suggests it may be one of their most enduring." [...] Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly graded it an [...] "A−" [...] and called the album [...] "an eclectic and electrifying winner, one <b>that</b> <b>speaks</b> <b>to</b> the zeitgeist the way only U2 can and dare to do." [...] BBC Music reviewer Chris Jones said, [...] "There's plenty to rejoice about here" [...] while noting that the [...] "symbiotic relationship with Brian Eno (and Daniel Lanois) seems to have reached the point of imperceptibility."

2500|$|Among the {{distinct}} {{elements of the}} Beach Boys' style were their voices' nasal quality {{and the use of}} falsetto in their harmonies over a run-on melody.

[...] Music theorist Daniel Harrison adds, [...] "But even the least distinguished of the Beach Boys' early uptempo rock 'n' roll songs show traces of structural complexity at some level; Brian was simply too curious and experimental to leave convention alone." [...] Lyric collaborator Van Dyke Parks argued that, [...] "Wilson made music as accessible as a cartoon and yet rewarded repeated listening as much as Bach: Just as the best comic books can turn cliché into high art, so can the best pop music.

Their {{creation}} was referred to as Project Leda. The series focuses on Sarah Manning, a small-time con woman and orphan who is the only clone to have a biological daughter. (All clones were presumed to be sterile before Sarah was discovered, with one of the original scientists revealing that the clones, as 'prototypes', were all designed to be sterile, and it is also revealed in season 2 that Helena is also able to conceive given her origin as Sarah's specific twin.) Other clones include Elizabeth [...] "Beth" [...] Childs, a police detective whose suicide {{at the start of the}} series leads Sarah into the conspiracy; Alison Hendrix, a soccer mom who tries to be the perfect housewife, but suffers from pill and drink addiction as well as jumping to conclusions; Cosima Niehaus, a lesbian graduate student studying evolutionary developmental ("evo-devo") biology who researches the clones' biology; Helena, the twin sister of Sarah, a fanatic assassin trained by the Proletheans who has suffered severe abuse throughout her life; Rachel Duncan, an executive at the Dyad Institute, who was raised knowing that she is a clone from childhood.

2500|$|The Wall Street Journal critic Joe Morgenstern commented, [...] "'Knight and Day' {{woke me up}} to {{just how}} awful some summer {{entertainments}} have become. It isn't that the film is harmful, except to moviegoers' wallets and movie lovers' morale, {{but that it is}} truly phenomenal for the purity of its incoherence." [...] Writing for the Chicago Sun-Times, Roger Ebert rated the movie 3 stars out of 4 and wrote, [...] "'Knight and Day' aspires to the light charm of a romantic action comedy like 'Charade' or 'Romancing the Stone,' but would come closer if it dialed down the relentless action. The romance part goes without saying after a Meet Cute contrived in an airport, and the comedy seems to generate naturally between Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz. But why do so many summer movies find it obligatory to inflict us with CGI overkill? I'd sorta rather see Diaz and Cruise in action scenes on a human scale, rather than have it rubbed in that for long stretches, they're essentially replaced by animation." [...] Ty Burr of The Boston Globe stated, [...] "The movie’s a piece of high-octane summer piffle: stylish, funny, brainless without being too obnoxious about it, and Cruise is its manic animating principle." [...] Writing for the Associated Press, Christy Lemire commented, [...] "Cruise's presence also helps keep things light, breezy and watchable when the action – and the story itself – spin ridiculously out of control." [...] Bill Goodykoontz of The Arizona Republic observed, [...] "Mangold, working from a script by Patrick O'Neill, accelerates events {{in a way that is}} either a perfect representation of how current action films are made or a demonstration of everything that's wrong with movies today. Maybe it's both." [...] Joshua Starnes of ComingSoon.net gave the film a rating of 6.5 out of 10, and concluded his review, [...] "Instead of watching it, you're better off putting [...] "Knight and Day" [...] in a time capsule and singing some Don McLean, 'cause this is the day the movie star died." [...] In a subsequent [...] "mini review", Edward Douglas of ComingSoon.net gave the film a rating of 8 out of 10, and concluded, [...] "The entertainment comes from how much fun it is watching [...] on screen together and that's what separates Knight and Day from previous attempts at mixing romance, comedy, and action."
