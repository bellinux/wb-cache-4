25|$|The {{requirement}} for reliance {{has not been}} pushed {{so far as to}} say that a misrepresentor is never liable when a misrepresentee could have found out the truth. In the leading case, Redgrave v Hurd Mr Hurd was told by the elderly Mr Redgrave that the solicitor practice earned £300 pa. Mr Redgrave <b>told</b> <b>Mr</b> Hurd he could check some documents in the office to prove it. Mr Hurd did not check, and subsequently signed a contract to join Mr Redgrave as a partner. Then Mr Hurd found out the practice only generated £200 pa, and the documents in the office had never said otherwise. Lord Jessel MR held that the contract could be rescinded for misrepresentation, because Mr Redgrave had still made a misrepresentation. Furthmore it would be inferred that Mr Hurd relied on the statement from the fact that it was untrue. Edgington v Fitzmaurice confirmed further that a misrepresentation need not be the sole cause of entering a contract, for a remedy to be available, so long as it is an influence.|$|E
500|$|Mackenzie King wanted Macdonald {{to stand}} for a vacant seat in Kingston, Ontario. It was a {{traditional}} Conservative riding that had been represented by Sir John A. Macdonald, Canada's first prime minister. In 1935 however, the riding had switched to the Liberals and King wanted to keep it. [...] "I <b>told</b> <b>Mr.</b> King that I did not know Kingston at all, nor its problems, nor its people", Macdonald wrote later. When the Conservatives agreed not to run a candidate against him however, Macdonald {{had no choice but}} {{to stand for}} office in Kingston. He won the seat by acclamation on August 12, 1940.|$|E

Mr. Warren <b>told</b> <b>Mr.</b> Wayne about the {{transition}} of the show from radio to TV, and Mr. Wayne readily agreed that James Arness would be a terrific choice for the part of Matt Dillon. I have no reason to doubt the story, because Jimmy absolutely knew everybody." ...|$|E
2500|$|During {{the making}} of Red Dust, Bern—her husband of two months—was found dead at their home; this created a lasting scandal. Initially, Harlow was speculated to have killed Bern, but Bern's death was officially ruled a suicide by self-inflicted gunshot wound. Louis B. Mayer feared {{negative}} publicity from the incident and intended to replace Harlow in the film, offering the role to Tallulah Bankhead. Bankhead was appalled by the offer and wrote in her autobiography, [...] "To damn the radiant Jean for the misfortune of another {{would be one of}} the shabbiest acts of all time. I <b>told</b> <b>Mr.</b> Mayer as much." [...] Harlow kept silent, survived the ordeal, and became more popular than ever. A 2009 biography of Bern asserted that Bern was, in fact, murdered by a former lover and the crime scene rearranged by MGM executives to make it appear Bern had killed himself.|$|E

2500|$|Sheldon {{was raised}} in Galveston, Texas along with his elder brother (George Jr.) and fraternal twin sister (Missy) by his mother, Mary Cooper, an overtly devout Evangelical Christian; and George Cooper, an {{alcoholic}} who was never around. Sheldon once got his father fired when he <b>told</b> <b>Mr.</b> Hinckley, the store owner, that George was stealing from the cash register. (Sheldon was rewarded with a fudgsicle.) [...] The only member of his family to have encouraged his work in science was his grandfather, whom he cherished and affectionately called [...] "Pop-Pop", and who died when Sheldon was five years old. Pop-Pop's loss is what caused Sheldon to despise Christmas when his Christmas wish to bring Pop-Pop back didn't come true. Sheldon's closest relative is his maternal grandmother who he affectionately calls [...] "Meemaw", and who in turn calls him [...] "Moon Pie". His aunt also encouraged Sheldon by giving him medical equipment, [...] "in case his work in physics failed, he'd have a 'trade' to fall back on".|$|E
2500|$|However several {{qualifications}} exist. First, if {{a representation}} was made during negotiations, which later transpires {{to be no}} longer true, there is a duty to make a correction. So in With v O'Flanagan where Dr O'Flanagan <b>told</b> <b>Mr</b> With that his medical practice earned £40 per week, but when the contract was signed the income had dropped to £5 per week, Dr O'Flanagan was under a duty to correct himself. Representations are continuing. Second, one cannot simply tell half truths, as for instance in Dimmock v Hallett, where a land vendor said two farms were fully let but did not say the tenants had given notice to quit. This was misrepresentation. Third, {{it can be a}} misrepresentation when a person says they are [...] "unaware" [...] of something, but have in fact done no checks. This was the situation in Notts Patent Brick and Tile Co v Butler, where a land purchaser asked the vendor's solicitors whether there were any restrictive covenants and the solicitor (without bothering to find out) said he was unaware of any. It was true that the solicitor was unaware, {{but it was also a}} misrepresentation.|$|E
2500|$|The cases seem to {{show that}} the divide between [...] "fact" [...] and [...] "opinion" [...] is partly {{affected}} by the balance of knowledge and expertise between the parties. In Bisset v Wilkinson Mr Bisset said his land in New Zealand could support 2000 sheep. Both he and Mr Wilkinson knew sheep had not been farmed before. Mr Wilkinson tried to pull out after the contract was signed, but the Privy Council advised that the statement was only one of opinion, not fact given that there was no dishonesty, and considering the [...] "knowledge of the parties respectively, and their relative positions". In the more recent case of Esso Petroleum Co Ltd v Mardon Lord Denning MR emphasised again that knowledge of facts was crucial in being liable for a misrepresentation. Here Esso <b>told</b> <b>Mr</b> Mardon, a prospective franchisee, that its Southport petrol station would have 200,000 customers a year. In fact the projections were wrong, and so Mr Mardon was entitled to claim compensation for his losses. The distinction between Esso and Mr Bisset is that Esso was in a far better position to know what was true.|$|E

2500|$|Equity {{is a body}} {{of rules}} that {{developed}} in England separately from the [...] "common law". The common law was administered by judges and barristers. The Lord Chancellor on the other hand, as the King's keeper of conscience, could overrule the judge-made law if he thought it equitable to do so. This meant equity came to operate more through principles than rigid rules. For instance, whereas neither the common law nor civil law systems allow people to split the ownership from the control of one piece of property, equity allows this through an arrangement known as a 'trust'. 'Trustees' control property, whereas the 'beneficial' (or 'equitable') ownership of trust property is held by people known as 'beneficiaries'. Trustees owe duties to their beneficiaries to {{take good care of}} the entrusted property. In the early case of Keech v Sandford [...] a child had inherited the lease on a market in Romford, London. Mr Sandford was entrusted to look after this property until the child matured. But before then, the lease expired. The landlord had (apparently) <b>told</b> <b>Mr</b> Sandford {{that he did not want}} the child to have the renewed lease. Yet the landlord was happy (apparently) to give Mr Sandford the opportunity of the lease instead. Mr Sandford took it. When the child (now Mr Keech) grew up, he sued Mr Sandford for the profit that he had been making by getting the market's lease. Mr Sandford was meant to be trusted, but he put himself in a position of conflict of interest. The Lord Chancellor, Lord King, agreed and ordered Mr Sandford should disgorge his profits. He wrote, ...|$|E
2500|$|... ″The ancient chapel {{belonging}} {{to the town of}} Penzance may be seen in a fish cellar, near the key; it is small and as I remember had the image of the Virgin Mary in it.″ The chapel was built of greenstone and about 30ft in length and 15ft in breadth of which only a fragment remained in situ. In around 1800 the chapel was converted to a fish cellar. A carving in [...] "Ludgvan granite" [...] thought to be of St Anthony was removed in about 1830 and was used in the wall of a pig sty, which was further vandalised in 1850 when [...] "a stranger ... taking fancy to the stony countenance and rough hands, they were broken off and carried away as relics ...". The remains of the vandalised relic were taken to St Mary's Churchyard by a mason who <b>told</b> <b>Mr</b> Millett that he [...] "popped St Raffidy into a wheelbarrow and trundle him off to the chapel yard." [...] The carving remains in St Mary’s Churchyard and has been dated by Prof Charles Thomas as early 12th century. There are no early documents mentioning the dedication to St Anthony; this seems to depend entirely on tradition and may be groundless. A licence for Divine Service in the Chapel of St Gabriel and St Raphael was granted in 1429, but nothing more is known of this chapel except, possibly, for the mason who mentioned ″St Raffidy″ in 1850. Adjoining the chapel is St Anthony's Gardens, named in 1933 and containing an archway said to have been taken from the chapel site.|$|E
2500|$|The {{requirements}} of notice and any disciplinary procedure {{do not apply}} if the employee {{was the one to}} have repudiated the contract, either expressly, or by conduct. As in the general law of contract, if an employee's conduct is so seriously bad that it manifests to the reasonable person an intention to not be bound, then the employer may dismiss the employee without notice. But if the employer is not justified in making a summary dismissal, the employee has a claim under ERA 1996 section 13 for a shortfall in wages. The same principle, that a serious breach of contract gives the other side the option to terminate, also works in favour of employees. In Wilson v Racher a gardener was bullied by his employer, the heir of Tolethorpe Hall, and gave him a rude telling off for not picking up some string on the lawn. Mr Wilson, the gardener, <b>told</b> <b>Mr</b> Racher [...] "get stuffed, go and shit yourself". The Court of Appeal held that the employer's attitude meant this breakdown in trust and confidence was the employer's own doing, and because the law no longer saw employment as a [...] "Czar-serf" [...] relationship, Mr Wilson was in the right and was wrongfully dismissed. The remedy for breach of contract, following a long tradition that specific performance should not result in draconian consequences or binding hostile parties to continue working together, is typically monetary compensation to put the claimant in the same position as if the contract had been properly performed. However, in Edwards v Chesterfield Royal Hospital, the Supreme Court held that an injunction is available to restrain breach of contract for the employer's failure to follow a doctor's contractual disciplinary procedure. This indicated that specific performance should always in principle be available, particularly in large organisations where people can be shifted to avoid personality conflicts.|$|E
