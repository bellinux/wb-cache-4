5000|$|The Bushes and Clintons {{have also}} {{remained}} political active, {{similar to the}} Kennedy family, even when not holding public office. Robert Reich has suggested <b>that</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>is</b> {{in a state of}} [...] "permanent election", due to the impeachment proceedings during his presidency and his continuing support in the campaigns of his wife Hillary Clinton. With the backing of his aide Doug Band, Bill Clinton has remained socially prominent through the Clinton Foundation and Clinton Global Initiative, something that did not sit well with one of his predecessors, Jimmy Carter. Bill Clinton has spoken in support of the Democratic presidential nominee at every DNC from 2000 to 2016; by contrast the Bush family has been less active after 2009 after George W. left Bush departed the presidency, but Jeb Bush was mentioned as a presidential contender for 2012 and spoke at the RNC that year.|$|E
40|$|Our paper ‘Varieties of Quotation ’ (1997 b; VQ, for short) {{had three}} goals: 1 (i) To marshall {{data for the}} {{relationships}} among pure, direct, mixed and indirect quotation (as in (1) –(4) respectively). (1) ‘Smooth ’ is an adjective in English. (2) Alice whispered, ‘smooth’. (3) Alice said <b>that</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>is</b> ‘smooth’. (4) Alice said <b>that</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>is</b> smooth. (ii) To demonstrate that {{a wide range of}} theories of pure and indirect quotation fails to explain this data. (iii) To present a theory that can. Many authors responded to VQ and we published extensive replies to some (Cappelen and Lepore  1998 a,  1998 b,  1999 a,  1999 b).

50|$|During the 1992 U.S. presidential election, Vicki G. Morwitz and Carol Pluzinski {{conducted}} a study, {{which was published}} in The Journal of Consumer Research (1996). At a large northeastern university, some of 214 volunteer business students were given the results of student and national polls indicating <b>that</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>was</b> in the lead. Others were not exposed to the results of the polls. Several students who had intended to vote for Bush changed their minds after seeing the poll results.|$|R
50|$|The book {{is based}} mainly on {{interviews}} with Clinton campaign staff that the authors conducted over {{a year and a}} half. Among its assertions <b>are</b> that <b>Clinton</b> confidants attempted to get Robby Mook fired as her campaign manager and that Huma Abedin targeted people who gave constructive criticism to the campaign. Another <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>was</b> alarmed by the dropoff in support for his wife among white working-level voters, but that his concerns went unheeded within the campaign staff.|$|R

Sharpton denies that Stone had any influence over his campaign.|$|R
5000|$|In March 2017, Trump {{criticized the}} Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, after the 2017 Westminster attack, {{which in turn}} led British lawmakers to criticize Trump Jr. British journalists said that Trump Jr. had quoted Khan out of context when he criticized him. [...] Khan {{did not respond to}} the criticism, saying he had [...] "far more {{important}} things" [...] to do. In April 2017, he lauded Mike Cernovich who promoted the debunked Pizzagate conspiracy theory, saying, [...] "In a long gone time of unbiased journalism he'd win the Pulitzer". In May 2017, Trump promoted the [...] "long-debunked, far-right conspiracy theory" [...] <b>that</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>was</b> linked to Vince Foster's death.|$|R

5000|$|Near {{the end of}} the Clinton {{administration}} in 2001, rumors began circulating <b>that</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>was</b> considering granting Peltier clemency. Opponents campaigned against that, culminating in a protest outside the White House by about 500 FBI agents and families, and a letter opposing clemency from FBI director Louis Freeh. Clinton did not grant or deny Peltier clemency. In 2002, Peltier filed a civil rights lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against the FBI, Louis Freeh, and FBI agents who had participated in the campaign against his clemency petition, alleging that they [...] "engaged in a systematic and officially sanctioned campaign of misinformation and disinformation." [...] On March 22, 2004, the suit was dismissed. In January 2009, President George W. Bush denied Peltier's clemency petition before leaving office.|$|R

2500|$|The term {{came into}} {{widespread}} use near {{the time of}} the 1996 Republican National Convention. [...] The first use of the term in a news article about that election appeared in the July 21, 1996 edition of The Washington Post. E. J. Dionne, the article's author, quoted Alex Castellanos (at the time a senior media advisor to Bob Dole) suggesting <b>that</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>was</b> targeting a voting demographic whom Castellanos called the [...] "soccer mom." [...] The soccer mom was described in the article as [...] "the overburdened middle income working mother who ferries her kids from soccer practice to scouts to school." [...] The article suggested that the term soccer mom was a creation of political consultants. Castellanos was later quoted in The Wall Street Journal as saying [...] "She's the key swing consumer in the marketplace, and the key swing voter who will decide the election." ...|$|R
5000|$|In March 1992, Gerth {{revealed}} that beginning in 1978, while <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>was</b> Arkansas attorney general, {{he and his}} wife Hillary were partners in an Ozark real estate deal with James B. McDougal. When <b>Clinton</b> <b>was</b> governor, McDougal controlled a bank and Madison Guaranty, a savings and loan. Gerth's stories raised the question of whether it was appropriate for a governor to be in business partnership with someone having immediate financial interests in an industry regulated by the state. Gerth's reporting was criticized by liberal columnist Gene Lyons for [...] "not particularly fair or balanced stories that combine a prosecutorial bias and the art of tactical omission." [...] Other criticisms centered on the unclear time line - it was difficult to pick out <b>that</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>was</b> Attorney General, not Governor, at the time the partnership was created, and that Jim McDougal did not own a business regulated by the state until passage of the Garn-St. Germain Depository Institutions Act in 1982, 4 years after creation of the partnership.

AIM contended that [...] "Foster was murdered", which is contrary to three independent reports including one by Kenneth Starr. AIM faulted the media for not picking up on the conspiracy, and applied itself for FOIA disclosure of Foster's death-scene photographs. Its suit to compel disclosure was denied by the District Court of Columbia in a summary judgment, unanimously affirmed by the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.|$|R
500|$|Bill Oakley, who was {{a writer}} on The Simpsons at the time, {{came up with the}} idea for [...] "Two Bad Neighbors" [...] two years before {{production}} began. Oakley got the inspiration for the episode after the feud between the Bushes and the Simpson family, and two years later when he and Josh Weinstein became showrunners of The Simpsons, they assigned Ken Keeler to write it. Oakley said <b>that</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton</b> had <b>been</b> President of the United States for two years at the point when the episode went into production, so the feud had [...] "faded off into oblivion". The staff therefore thought it would be funny if the two parties encountered each other again.|$|R

Ford won easily, despite the fact <b>that</b> fellow Democrat <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>was</b> not declared {{the winner of the}} presidential race in Kentucky until around 10:00 E.S.T. Ford pulled big margins out of the majority of Kentucky's 124 counties. This would be Ford's last term in the senate. He served his final term from January 3, 1993, to January 3, 1999.

2500|$|In September 2007, former Clinton Administration senior {{health policy}} advisor Paul Starr {{published}} an article, [...] "The Hillarycare Mythology," [...] {{and he wrote}} <b>that</b> <b>Bill,</b> not Hillary, <b>Clinton,</b> <b>was</b> {{the driving force behind}} the plan at all stages of its origination and development; the task force headed by her quickly became useless and was not the primary force behind formulating the proposed policy; and [...] "ot only did the fiction of Hillary's personal responsibility for the health plan fail to protect the president at the time, it has also now come back to haunt her in her own quest for the presidency." ...|$|R
500|$|The Baird case {{became the}} first {{national}} scandal over child-care arrangements, but the situation that these nominees faced was in part at least a common one to Americans. [...] Two-thirds of American women with school-age children were in the workforce and three-fifths of married men with children had working wives. [...] They all needed some form of day care, and with there being no organized or subsidized day care system in the U.S., many families turned to arrangements within the underground economy. [...] That this administration ran into this problem was considered ironic, given <b>that</b> <b>Bill</b> and Hillary <b>Clinton</b> <b>were</b> the first dual-career couple to occupy the White House.|$|R

Upon hearing Daigle's comment, the flight attendant notified the captain, who immediately contacted USAir ground control, and police were subsequently notified. What Daigle didn't know <b>was</b> <b>that</b> then-U.S. President <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>was</b> also on the Pittsburgh International Airport tarmac at the time, resulting in a heightened level of security.

40|$|Zoo {{animals were}} tested {{to see if}} they {{perceived}} the scary nature of Halloween masks, using a procedure that measured the avoidance response latency to take food from a masked human experimenter. Human perception of the masks was also assessed using a rating scale, with results showing <b>that</b> a <b>Bill</b> <b>Clinton</b> mask <b>was</b> rated not scary, while a Vampire mask was rated very scary. Animal results showed that primate latencies correlated significantly with the human ratings, while non-primate latencies did not. Taken together, these results indicate that human perception of scary faces does not depend upon human-specific cultural factors, e. g., belief in the supernatural. Rather, it has a more biological basis, shared specifically with other primates, by which scary faces are perceived as predators or threatening conspecifics. There is currently considerable interest in comparative and developmental aspects of face perception (e. g., Martin-Malivel, Mangini, Fagot, & Biederman...|$|R
