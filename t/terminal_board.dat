In brief, the comparison of results obtained by nonlinear real-time control with pre-identification, and by adaptive real-time control with on-line identification was performed. The rewinding machine was controlled by PC from MATLAB's Real-Time Toolbox using technological card, <b>terminal</b> <b>board</b> and wires. Each of two used approaches has its advantages and its drawbacks, which was proven, and nonlinear control {{seemed to be more}} suitable for the rewinding machine, minimally because of the action signal history from the nonlinear control, the action is more consistent.

40|$|The Apollo 11 {{service module}} and the command module (CM) {{reaction}} control system performed satisfactorily throughout the mission. Two anomalies which occurred were an inadvertent isolation valve closure during command and service module/Saturn S 4 B/lunar module separation and {{a failure of}} a CM thruster to respond to automatic commands. The isolation valves were later opened by the crew and remained open during {{the remainder of the}} mission. The cause of the closure was determined to be the shock loads generated during separation. The CM engine malfunction was caused by a faulty <b>terminal</b> <b>board</b> connector. All system parameters were normal during the mission, and all mission requirements were satisfied...|$|E

50|$|Terminal blocks (also called <b>terminal</b> <b>boards</b> or strips) {{provide a}} {{convenient}} means of connecting individual electrical wires without a splice or physically joining the ends. They are usually used to connect wiring among various items of equipment within an enclosure {{or to make}} connections among individually enclosed items. Since terminal blocks are readily available {{for a wide range}} of wire sizes and terminal quantity, they are one of the most flexible types of electrical connector available. Some disadvantages are that connecting wires is more difficult than simply plugging in a cable and the terminals are generally not very well protected from contact with persons or foreign conducting materials.|$|R
