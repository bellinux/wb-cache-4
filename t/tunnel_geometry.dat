40|$|Stress and {{deformation}} {{behavior in}} rock surrounding elliptical tunnels with concrete liners is investigated by finite element analysis. The loading condition {{is limited to}} hydrostatic pressure applied inside the tunnel and {{it is assumed that}} the constitutive behaviors of both rock and concrete are according to isotropic linear elasticity. Plain strain conditions are assumed to prevail for the tunnels, which is the case when tunnels with straight axis in uniform rock media are considered. Three elliptical tunnel geometries with major to minor axis ratios of 1. 156, 1. 358 and 1. 500 are considered for the study. Each problem geometry was analysed for liner thickness varying from 0. 0 m (unlined case) to 1. 0 m in steps of 0. 2 m, assuming that the Young's Modulus for rock is 1 / 10 th of that of concrete. The result for stress and deformation are presented for the rock domain, both in tabular and graphical forms. These numerical results illustrate the effect of concrete liner thickness and <b>tunnel</b> <b>geometry</b> on stress and deformation in rock. A limited parametric study is conducted by varying the Young's Modulus of rock for a selected <b>tunnel</b> <b>geometry</b> with a concrete liner thickness of 0. 2 m. The present research makes a significant contribution to tunnel engineers, providing numerical tools to arrive at an optimum <b>tunnel</b> <b>geometry</b> and liner thickness, by striking a balance between cost and efficiency...|$|E

40|$|A {{mechanical}} ventilation system {{plays a major}} role in tunnels safety. Over the world, different ventilation systems regarding to the <b>tunnel</b> <b>geometry</b> and other parameters are used for tunnel ventilation in the normal and fire operations. However, in short tunnels depending on the <b>tunnel</b> <b>geometry</b> and traffic condition, there is the possibility of passing traffic through a tunnel without {{mechanical ventilation}}. Normally, natural ventilation is applied in short tunnels. In longer tunnels, additional measures in geometry such as openings or shafts are necessary to support natural ventilation. Due to the high costs of the electro-mechanical installations, maintenance and electricity power consumption for mechanical ventilation, having tunnels with natural ventilation system will be the best option. But, reliability of such ventilation systems in case of emergency must be substantiated before applying to tunnels. The main concern is a proper smoke evacuation in a fire case. In this survey, in order to set up a suitable CFD model, numerical simulation of a pre-conducted fire test by using same boundary conditions is done. These simulations were further extended to fires with higher capacities to show smoke and temperature behavior during the higher fires. The newest version of the FDS software (Fire Dynamic Simulator 6) was employed for simulations...|$|E

40|$|A fire in {{road tunnel}} can be {{dangerous}} and lead to serious consequences if not addressed appropriately. In a tunnel fire incident, creating a smoke free path for motorist evacuation and facilitating fire fighters to access the fire is critical for fire and rescue operations. A means of achieving this is to use ventilation fans to blow sufficient air down the tunnel ensuring no back-layering of smoke occurs upstream of the fire. The airflow necessary for such operation {{is known as the}} critical velocity which is a function of a number of factors includes; heat release rate, <b>tunnel</b> <b>geometry,</b> tunnel gradient etc. Among these parameters, the heat release rate is the most difficult to identify as this value is dependent on the types of vehicles, number of vehicles involved, the type of cargo and the quantity of cargo carried by these vehicles. There are also other factors such as the influence of ventilation condition, <b>tunnel</b> <b>geometry</b> and the use of legislation (to restrict hazardous vehicles entering in tunnel) that could affect the heat release rate in a tunnel fire. The number of possible fire scenarios is numerous. Based on current practise, fire size selection for most tunnel ventilation design ofte...|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} theory of <b>tunnelling</b> <b>geometries</b> {{originating}} from the no-boundary quantum state of Hartle and Hawking, which describes {{in the language of}} analytic continuation the nucleation of the Lorentzian Universe from the Euclidean spacetime. We reformulate the no-boundary wavefunction in the manifestly unitary representation of true physical variables and calculate it in the one-loop approximation. For this purpose a special technique of complex extremals is developed, which reduces the formalism of complex <b>tunnelling</b> <b>geometries</b> to the real ones, and also the method of collective variables is applied, separating the macroscopic collective degrees of freedom from the microscopic modes that are treated perturbatively. The quantum distribution function of Lorentzian universes, defined on the space of such collective variables, incorporates the probabilty conservation and boils down to the partition function of quasi-DeSitter gravitational instantons weighted by their Euclidean effective action. These instantons represent closed compact manifolds obtained by the procedure of doubling the Euclidean spacetime which nucleates the Lorentzian universes. The over-Planckian behaviour of their distribution is determined by the anomalous scaling of the theory on such instantons, which serves as a criterion for the highenergy normalizability of the no-boudary wavefunction and the validity of the semiclassical expansion. Thus the presented formalism combines the covariance of the Euclidean effective action with unitarity and analyticity in the Lorentzian spacetime and can be regarded as a step towards the unification of Euclidean and Lorentzian versions of quantum gravity and its third quantization...|$|R

40|$|Fire in road tunnels is {{a unique}} design problem {{which can lead to}} serious {{consequences}} if not addressed appropriately. Observations from full scale tunnel fire experiments have indicated the heat release rate depends on the ventilation conditions, <b>tunnel</b> <b>geometry</b> and fuel load. Although these experiments have provided valuable information, they are generally very expensive to conduct and the data are limited. The experiments are often based on a specific test condition such as air velocity, geometry or tunnel slope which may be different from the design conditions present for an actual tunnel project. The design of smoke extraction systems for tunnels often uses prescriptive values for the heat release rate (HRR) from a vehicle fire which does not account for the tunnel conditions. This paper presents an overview of the methodology to estimate the heat release rate of a credible vehicle fire in a road tunnel using a performance-based approach. The analysis consists of two stages; stage one involves the use of a probabilistic approach (risk analysis) to identify the potential cause and type of vehicle which could result in a tunnel fire. Findings from the risk analysis are used in stage two in which Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) modelling is used to establish the heat release rate in a tunnel considering factors such as fuel load, ventilation condition, <b>tunnel</b> <b>geometry</b> and ignition location. An urban tunnel in Singapore is used to illustrate this methodology...|$|E
40|$|Computational fluid {{dynamics}} (CFD) {{is an important}} and extensively used tool for aerodynamic development in the vehicle industry today. Validation of virtual methods by comparison to wind tunnel experiments is a must because manufacturers aim to substitute physical tests on prototype vehicles with virtual simulations. An appropriate validation can be performed only if the wind <b>tunnel</b> <b>geometry</b> with representative boundary conditions {{is included in the}} numerical simulation, and if the flow of the empty wind tunnel is accurately predicted. One of the important flow parameters to predict is the longitudinal pressure distribution in the test section, which is dependent on both the wind <b>tunnel</b> <b>geometry</b> and the settings of the boundary layer control systems. This study investigates the effects of flow angularity at the inlet and different boundary layer control systems, namely, basic scoop suction, distributed suction, and moving belts, on the longitudinal pressure distribution in the full-scale aerodynamic wind tunnel of Volvo Cars using CFD and a systematic design of experiments approach. The study shows that the different suction systems used to reduce boundary layer thickness upstream of the vehicle have statistically significant effects on the longitudinal pressure distribution in the test section. However, the estimated drag difference induced on a typical vehicle by the difference in horizontal buoyancy between the tested settings is within the test-to-test uncertainty of the physical wind tunnel, thereby leading to the conclusion that force calculations in simulations are fairly insensitive to the tested parameters on the investigated intervals...|$|E

Computational fluid dynamics, with a RANS approach, is used to model the viscous ow on a stiff, model scale sail plan, where the sail shape has been captured in the experimental studies used for validation. An unstructured, overset grid is used, allowing movement of the sail plan. Two rounds of simulations were performed, where the second was started since the <b>tunnel</b> <b>geometry</b> as well as experimental results used for {{the first round of}} simulations proved to be incorrect. Correct <b>tunnel</b> <b>geometry</b> and experimental results were later provided by {{one of the authors of}} the experimental paper. For the initial simulations, a verification and validation was performed for steady conditions. The verification was successful, and the solution shown to have insignificant grid dependence for the tested grids. However, due to undocumented corrections applied to the experimental data, the validation was unsuccessful, showing large differences. This prompted an investigation concerning physical modelling, where the effects of tunnel conditions, turbulence modelling, scale effects as well as grid topology were investigated. For the final simulations, the correct <b>tunnel</b> <b>geometry</b> was used, and results of the physical modelling investigation were considered. Again, verification and validation were performed. In contrast to the verification in the initial round of simulations, some grid dependence is apparent for the tested range of grids. For the steady case, the subsequent validation was successful, with a 2 : 8 % difference for the driving force coefficient Cx and a 3 : 2 % difference for the side force coefficient Cy.

A low amplitude, high frequency pitch motion was tested, and showed good agreement for mean values, with a 2 : 1 % difference for the driving force Fx and a 3 : 6 % difference for side force Cy. The phases of the forces were well predicted but force amplitudes were under predicted, with a 14 : 3 % difference for the amplitude of Fx, and a 18 : 5 % difference for the amplitude of Fy.

40|$|In recent years, {{a number}} of high profile {{accidental}} fires have occurred in several road and rail tunnels throughout the world. Many of these fires grew rapidly to catastrophic size and claimed many lives. The processes involved in the rapid growth and extremely severe of these fires are not adequately understood as yet. The introduction to this thesis reviews {{a number of}} these accidental fires and describes much of the previous experimental research which has brought about the current understanding of tunnel fire behaviour. A detailed review of the relevant parts of elementary fire dynamics is also presented. This thesis addresses two main questions: 1. What is the influence of longitudinal ventilation on fire size in tunnels? and 2. What is the influence of <b>tunnel</b> <b>geometry</b> on fire size? The answers to both these questions are determined using a probabilistic method called Bayes Theorem. This provides a method of answering the above two questions using the handful of experimental data which are available. It is found that the heat release rate (HRR) of a heavy goods vehicle (HGV) fire may be greatly increased in magnitude by longitudinal ventilation, for example by about a factor of 5 with a longitudinal ventilation velocity of 3 ms- 1. It is also found that longitudinal ventilation may cause {{a significant increase in the}} HRR of large pool fires, but may cause a decrease in the HRR of small pool fires and car fires. An equation is derived to predict the influence of <b>tunnel</b> <b>geometry</b> on HRR. It is found that HRR varies principally with the width of the tunnel and the width of the fire object.
