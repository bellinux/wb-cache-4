25|$|The town lot or plaza was an {{essential}} element of the Spanish colonial <b>town</b> <b>plan.</b> Government <b>offices</b> were designed to face the plaza, {{and in the case of}} this coastal village, the plaza could be fortified as a defensive work. An army encampment was recorded in the Plaza Lot in 1801, and a small wooden fort, including a battery of three cannon, was established from then until 1814. The more substantial Fort San Carlos was built about 1816 to protect the strategic harbor of the Amelia River and Spanish interests in northern Florida. The former Indian campsite became the fort’s parade grounds fronting Estrada Street, which still exists.|$|R

40|$|This book is {{the first}} {{systematic}} attempt to introduce the current practice and statistics of town planning in Hong Kong. Part I gives an analytical account of the practical and ideological context, discusses design principles and describes procedures of town planning with particular reference to change in use. The emphasis is on skills of plan interpretation and {{an appreciation of the}} intellectual disposition of planners and various objective constraints confronting them. Part II is {{the first of its kind}} in presenting and analysing the statistics of planning applications for 11 zones from 1978 to 1998. The success rates of planning applications as well as the main reasons used by the Town Planning Board for rejecting planning applications are elucidated. Lawrence Wai-chung Lai won a Commonwealth scholarship to study town planning at the University of Sydney in 1983 - 84 where he obtained a Royal Australian Planning Institute (NSW) prize for outstanding academic performance. He worked as a Town Planner with the <b>Town</b> <b>Planning</b> <b>Office,</b> Lands and Works Branch and the Environmental Protection Department before joining the University of Hong Kong.

40|$|This Master’s {{thesis is}} a study about how to re-organize and to improve {{existing}} building and townscape or cityscape by way of adding wooden elements. Wood as architectural construction material has three outstanding characteristics, its light weight in comparison of strength, its thermal capacity and its variety in structural form. These characteristics indicate superiority of wooden construction in extension construction. Because, wooden construction can be built on existing structure more easily for its light weight, can be built on existing structure without cold bridge for its thermal capacity, can be built on existing structure in any structural form according to existing structure for its variety in structural form. In today’s situation that cities are already full of existing buildings, to find better solution, greener and more effective solution for re-organizing existing building and cityscape to fit to new needs of city is inevitable. This Master’s thesis is a case study to find such solution in way of adding wooden elements. In {{the second part of}} the thesis, concepts of wooden extension were analyzed. The concepts were classi-fied into four according to characteristics, those are Vertical, Horizontal, Implant and Attach. Each concept was analyzed individually with examples, and applied to the design in the fifth part of the thesis according to the analysis. The site for the design was chosen in Rauma which is 250 km north from Helsinki. Rauma has two different areas in town, the one is Old Rauma which is the area of remained old wooden buildings registered in UNESCO World Heritage in 1991, and the other is the area built with newer way. The site is on the border of the two, in newer side. In the third part of the thesis, analysis of the area and the existing building in the site was done. First, the analysis revealed that the site which is at the border of old and new area of the town is, at the same time, border of “organic and straight scape”, “small and big building scale”, “wood and concrete building material“, “commercial and cultural city function” and “border of two green spaces”. The goal of design was set to connect and buffer these differences. Secondly, the functional analysis revealed required program for the thesis site. <b>Town</b> <b>planning</b> <b>office</b> expected keeping existing commercial and parking function, and wished new housing and middle-scale hall for events. Music school and adult education center nearby the site has been in shortage of class rooms. As a result it was decided to design building as hybrid building of commercial, public, educational, housing and parking. In the fifth part, in design study part, some separated wooden volumes were added to the existing struc-ture with four extension concepts studied in the part two of the thesis, after partial demolition of existing concrete structure. The separation of volume was to connect different scale of old and new area of the town and to create spaces for walking and planting. Those separated volumes were integrated by terrace, cano-py and eaves set at some levels. These eaves and the spaces under eaves work also for communication be-tween new building and its surrounding. Different structural systems were applied for each volume to achieve different program inside. The parking volume was built with massive post and beam structure, the housing volume was built with post and beam around CLT structural cores with prefabricated wall ele-ments, the volume for the class room and another housing was built with assembling CLT wall and slab panels, and the volume for public function was built under repetition of 1000 mm height beam to realize long span of the hall space...|$|E
