500|$|A.G. Gaston, who {{was appalled}} {{at the idea of}} using children, {{was on the phone with}} white {{attorney}} David Vann trying to negotiate a resolution to the crisis. [...] When Gaston looked out the window and saw the children being hit with high-pressure water, he said, [...] "Lawyer Vann, I can't talk <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>now</b> or ever. My people are out there fighting for their lives and my freedom. I have to go help them", and hung up the phone. Black parents and adults who were observing cheered the marching students, but when the hoses were turned on, bystanders began to throw rocks and bottles at the police. [...] To disperse them, Connor ordered police to use German shepherd dogs to keep them in line. James Bevel wove in and out of the crowds warning them, [...] "If any cops get hurt, we're going to lose this fight." [...] At 3p.m., the protest was over. [...] During a kind of truce, protesters went home. Police removed the barricades and re-opened the streets to traffic. That evening King told worried parents in a crowd of a thousand, [...] "Don't worry about your children who are in jail. The eyes of the world are on Birmingham. We're going on in spite of dogs and fire hoses. We've gone too far to turn back." ...|$|E
2500|$|However, {{at the end}} of {{the concert}} with the Berlin Staatskapelle, Barenboim {{announced}} that he would like to play Wagner as a second encore and invited those who objected to leave, saying, [...] "Despite what the Israel Festival believes, there are people sitting in the audience for whom Wagner does not spark Nazi associations. I respect those for whom these associations are oppressive. It will be democratic to play a Wagner encore for those who wish to hear it. I am turning <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>now</b> and asking whether I can play Wagner." [...] A half-hour debate ensued, with some audience members calling Barenboim a [...] "fascist". In the end, a small number of attendees walked out and the overwhelming majority remained, applauding loudly after the performance of the Tristan und Isolde Prelude.|$|E
2500|$|... "A {{people that}} {{suffered}} for 2,000 years, {{that went through}} the Holocaust, arrives at its patrimony but is thrust into a renewed round of bloodshed, that is perhaps the road to annihilation. In terms of cosmic justice, that's terrible. It's far more shocking than what happened in 1948 to {{a small part of}} the Arab nation that was then in Palestine...We are the greater victims in the course of history and we are also the greater potential victim. Even though we are oppressing the Palestinians, we are the weaker side here. We are a small minority in a large sea of hostile Arabs who want to eliminate us. So it's possible than [...] when their desire is realized, everyone will understand what I am saying <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>now.</b> Everyone will understand we are the true victims. But by then it will be too late." ...|$|E

2500|$|On 9 March 2005, Crowe {{revealed}} to GQ magazine that Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agents had approached him {{prior to the}} 73rd Academy Awards in March 2001, {{and told him that}} the terrorist group al-Qaeda wanted to kidnap him. Crowe told the magazine that {{it was the first time}} he had ever heard of al-Qaeda and was quoted as saying: [...] "You get this late-night call from the FBI when you arrive in Los Angeles, and they're, like, absolutely full-on. 'We've got to talk <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>now</b> before you do anything. We have to have a discussion with you, Mr. Crowe.'" [...] Crowe recalled that: [...] "It was something to do with some recording picked up by a French policewoman, I think, in either Libya or Algiers...it was about taking iconographic Americans out of the picture as a sort of cultural destabilisation plan." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{response}} to the killings of Diệm and Nhu, she immediately accused the United States, saying [...] "Whoever has the Americans as allies does not need enemies", and that [...] "No coup can erupt without American incitement and backing". She went on to predict a bleak future for Vietnam and said that, by {{being involved in the}} coup, the troubles of the United States in Vietnam were just beginning. She called the deaths an [...] "indelible stigma" [...] against the Americans and said [...] "My family has been treacherously killed with either official or unofficial blessing of the American government, I can predict <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>now</b> that the story is only at its beginning." [...] She invoked biblical analogies, saying [...] "Judas has sold the Christ for thirty pieces of silver. The Ngô brothers have been sold for a few dollars." [...] When asked if she wanted asylum in the United States, she said, [...] "I cannot stay in a country whose government stabbed me in the back. I believe all the devils in hell are against us." ...|$|E
2500|$|Stilwell appealed {{directly}} to President Roosevelt {{for help with}} his dispute with Chiang, and as a result, Roosevelt sent Chiang a message which read: [...] "I have urged time and again in recent months that you take drastic action to resist the disaster which has been moving closer to China and <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> <b>Now,</b> when you have not yet placed General Stilwell in command of all forces in China, {{we are faced with}} the loss of a critical area... with possible catastrophic consequences". Roosevelt ended his ultimatum to Chiang with the threat to end all American aid unless Chiang [...] "at once" [...] place Stilwell [...] "in unrestricted command of all your forces." [...] General Chennault later claimed that Stilwell had deliberately ordered Sino-American forces out of Guilin as a way of creating a crisis that would force Chiang to give up command of his armies to Stilwell. Stilwell's diary supports Chennault's claim as Stilwell wrote that if a crisis emerged that was [...] "just sufficient {{to get rid of the}} Peanut without entirely wrecking the ship, it would be worth it", going on to write that the entire Kuomintang system had to be [...] "torn to bits" [...] and Chiang would just have to go.|$|E

2500|$|..... {{were but}} some few {{hundreds}} {{of the enemy}} now to land {{in any part of}} the Kingdom where there might be no regularly disciplined forces to guard it (and our own part, situated as we are on the very coast, is as much exposed to an invasion as any) how would it provoke a man of the least feeling and spirit to see ruin and devastation spread on every side by only a handful of them ... to behold, perhaps, the country all around you in flames, your fields laid waste, your houses destroyed, everything valuable plundered from you; to behold your wives and daughters exposed to the brutal lusts of your haughty and insolent conquerors; to see your aged decrepid parents and your innocent helpless children inhumanly treated - perhaps murdered - [...] by a plundering enemy, or exposed to want, to indigence and famine; and to stand yourselves all the while helpless and inactive, tame spectators of the misery...
