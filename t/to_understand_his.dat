5|$|Later in 1955, Steiger {{played an}} obnoxious film tycoon, {{loosely based on}} Columbia boss Harry Cohn, {{opposite}} Jack Palance and Ida Lupino in Robert Aldrich's film noir The Big Knife. Steiger bleached his hair for the part, sought inspiration for the role from Russian actor Vladimir Sokoloff, read {{a book about the}} Treblinka extermination camp <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>his</b> character thoroughly, and visited the perfume department of a store in Beverly Hills, California, to try <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>his</b> character's contempt for women. Steiger and Palance did not get along during the production, and in one scene Palance threw several record albums at Steiger in frustration, feeling {{that he was trying to}} steal the scene. Steiger earned critical acclaim later that year for a role as a prosecuting major in Otto Preminger's The Court-Martial of Billy Mitchell, alongside Gary Cooper and Charles Bickford.|$|E
5|$|<b>To</b> <b>understand</b> <b>his</b> character's world-view, McEwan {{spent time}} with a neurosurgeon. The novel explores one's {{engagement}} with the modern world {{and the meaning of}} existence in it. The main character, though outwardly successful, still struggles to understand meaning in his life, exploring personal satisfaction in the post-modern, developed world. Though intelligent and well read, Perowne feels he has little influence over political events.|$|E
50|$|Finally, Zits ends up {{as his own}} father. While in his father's body, {{he begins}} <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> why <b>his</b> father left his mother. He also begins <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> that <b>his</b> father does love him and that by leaving {{he was doing the}} best for his son.|$|R

5|$|After an {{examination}} in May 1723, Murray was accepted into Christ Church, Oxford, having scored {{higher in the}} examination than any other King's Scholar that year. He was admitted as a commoner on 15 June 1723, and matriculated on 18 June; the records say that he came from Bath rather than Perth, because the person recording {{the names of the}} new students was unable <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>his</b> Scottish accent. His older brother James was a barrister in Scotland, and his family decided that a career as a barrister was best for Murray. The Scottish Bar at the time was overcrowded, which made it difficult for a young barrister to build a reputation, yet qualifying for the English Bar was extremely expensive. Thanks to the patronage of Thomas Foley, 1st Baron Foley, who gave Murray £200 a year to live on, Murray could afford to study at the bar, and became a member of Lincoln's Inn on 23 April 1724.|$|E
5|$|While in Mexico, Cameron began {{performing}} blood rituals in {{the hope}} of communicating with Parsons' spirit; during these, she cut her own wrists. As part of these rituals, she claimed to have received a new magical identity, Hilarion. When she learned that an unidentified flying object had been seen over Washington D.C.'s Capitol Building she considered it a response to Parsons' death. After two months, she returned to California and attempted suicide. Increasingly interested in occultism, she read through her husband's papers. Embracing his Thelemic beliefs, she came <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>his</b> purpose in carrying out the Babalon Working and also came to believe that the spirit of Babalon had been incarnated into herself. She came to believe that Parsons had been murdered by the police or anti-zionists, and continued her attempts at astral projection to commune with his spirit.|$|E

25|$|The {{development}} of abstract {{art in the}} work of Gleizes and Delaunay was necessarily a transformation from the synthetic preoccupation with epic themes. In order to understand the passage of Gleizes' painting from an epic visionary figuration to abstraction, it is important <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>his</b> proto-Cubist period and its differences from the proto-Cubist works of Picasso and Braque.|$|E
25|$|The {{story is}} told from the {{perspective}} of a young man suffering from untreated schizophrenia, played by Ewen Bremner, as he tries <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>his</b> deteriorating world. Julien's abusive and arguably hypersensitive father is played by Werner Herzog. At one point, Korine was to play the son, but he backed down and was replaced by Bremner.|$|E
25|$|Early in 1948 {{he changed}} the family name from Sheehan to the modern Gaelic version of Ó Síocháin. In the 1950s he {{recognised}} the need for himself <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>his</b> native country at a deeper level, so becoming involved with the Aran Islands where he perfected his spoken Irish to the fluency of a native speaker and gained immense respect from the islanders.|$|E

25|$|Rabbi Dr. David Gottlieb {{notes that}} many Kabbalists hold that the {{concepts}} of, e.g., a Heavenly Court or the Sitra Ahra are only given to humanity by God {{as a working}} model <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>His</b> ways within our own epistemological limits. They reject {{the notion that a}} satan or angels actually exist. Others hold that non-divine spiritual entities were indeed created by God as a means for exacting his will.|$|E
25|$|May avoided ethnological prejudices. Nevertheless, {{there are}} in his work some phrasings, which today are seen as racist. In some instances, but not all, May makes pejorative {{statements}} about Armenians, black people, Chinese people, Irish people, Jews and mestizos. In {{a letter to a}} young Jewish person who intended to become a Christian after reading May's books, May advised him first <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>his</b> own religion, which he described as holy and exalted, until he was experienced enough to choose.|$|E
25|$|In parallel, Macedonski {{used the}} {{magazine}} to publicize his {{disagreement with the}} main Junimist voice, Convorbiri Literare. Among the group of contributors, several had already been victims of Maiorescu's irony: Sion, Urechia, Pantazi Ghica and Petru Grădișteanu. While welcoming the debut of its contributor, Parnassian-Neoclassicist novelist and poet Duiliu Zamfirescu, Macedonski repeatedly attacked its main exponent, the conservative poet Eminescu, claiming not <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>his</b> poetry. However, Literatorul was also open to contributions from some Convorbiri Literare affiliates (Zamfirescu, Matilda Cugler-Poni and Veronica Micle).|$|E

Does the father succeed in lodging a room in his son's imagination, what happens forms the rest of the play.|$|E
25|$|Richard A. Cohen (born 1952) is {{an author}} and proponent of {{conversion}} therapy. Cohen founded Parents and Friends of Ex-Gays and Gays and was its president, and founded the International Healing Foundation, through which he promotes his theories on sexual orientation change efforts for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people. Cohen, who was gay in his youth, underwent years of psychotherapy {{in an attempt to}} heal childhood issues which he felt had led to his homosexuality. He says that his therapy and personal growth helped him <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>his</b> same-sex attractions, and to eventually transition to heterosexuality.|$|E
25|$|This {{compendium}} of biblical and classical history (original title: De aetatibus mundi et hominis libri XXIII) is told in fourteen books, each lacking a particular {{letter of the}} alphabet ('A' in book i, 'B' in book ii., etc.). The deliberate omission of each letter means that Fulgentius cannot use any word containing that letter for the entirety of that section. However, he varies this avoidance of words with his second technique of swapping omitted letters for other arbitrarily selected letters. These techniques obscure his language, making {{it very difficult for}} the reader <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>his</b> meaning. Just as in the Content of Virgil, Fulgentius claims the work was completed {{as a result of the}} request of his unnamed patron.|$|E

50|$|Evidently, Artaud's various uses of {{the term}} cruelty must be {{examined}} <b>to</b> fully <b>understand</b> <b>his</b> ideas. Lee Jamieson has identified four ways in which Artaud used the term cruelty. First, it is employed metaphorically to describe the essence of human existence.|$|R
25|$|Alexei Ivanov, a shy {{steel factory}} worker, greatly surpasses his {{production}} quota and is chosen {{to receive the}} Order of Lenin {{and to have a}} personal interview with Joseph Stalin. Alexei falls in love with the idealist teacher Natasha, but has difficulties approaching her. When he meets Stalin, who tends his garden, the leader helps him <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>his</b> emotions and tells him to recite poetry to her. Then, they both have a luncheon {{with the rest of the}} Soviet leadership in Stalin's home. After returning from Moscow, Alexei confesses his love to Natasha. While they are both having a stroll in a wheat field, their town is attacked by the Germans, who invade the Soviet Union.|$|E
25|$|The two {{meet again}} {{towards the end}} of World War II while Katie is working at a radio station, and Hubbell, having served as a naval officer in the South Pacific, is trying to return to {{civilian}} life. They fall in love despite the differences in their background and temperament. Soon, however, Katie is incensed by the cynical jokes Hubbell's friends make at the death of President Franklin D. Roosevelt and is unable <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>his</b> indifference towards their insensitivity and shallow dismissal of political engagement. At the same time, his serenity is disturbed by her lack of social graces and her polarizing postures. Hubbell breaks it off with Katie, but soon agrees to work things out, at least for a time.|$|E
25|$|In 1969–70, when Australia toured South Africa, Gleeson's {{value was}} such that he insured his right hand for A$10,000. Gleeson took 18 wickets in two first class matches against provincial team {{at the start of}} the tour and then another five in the First Test at Cape Town, and five in the second innings in the Third Test in Johannesburg. Most of the South Africans were seeing him for the first time and {{struggled}} <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>his</b> action. It was Barry Richards, the most junior of them, who claimed to have worked him out. Not once in seven innings did Gleeson, who took 19 wickets at 38.94 in the series, dismiss Richards, as South Africa took a 4–0 series win.|$|E
