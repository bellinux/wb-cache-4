5|$|After the {{discovery}} of a natural circularly permuted protein, researchers looked for a way to emulate this process. In 1983, David Goldenberg and Thomas Creighton were able <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> circularly permuted version of a protein by chemically ligating the termini <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> cyclic protein, then introducing new termini elsewhere using trypsin. In 1989, Karolin Luger and her colleagues introduced a genetic method for making circular permutations by carefully fragmenting and ligating DNA. This method allowed for permutations to be introduced at arbitrary sites.|$|E
