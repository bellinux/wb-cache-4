One day, after being {{rejected}} by the citizens of Ritardando, because average people think the magic disease is contagious, she decides that she wants to do something with her life before it ends. The initial party wants to find out why the mineral powder is so cheap compared to the floral powder and to stop the mining of Mt. Rock to acquire it because the mining damages Agogo Forest. As they progress, the party learns that the mineral powder has fatal side effects that would aid Forte's insurrection against its enemy, Baroque. Realising this, the party heads for Forte, but are stopped and taken into the Forte dungeon because Forte was alerted to the planned arrival of the rebellion group, Andantino. Shortly after escaping, the party unites with Andantino and are spotted by the same Forte personnel south of Fort Fermata (which is a short walk from Forte), and fall off a bridge into a river. Half of the party, along with Andantino, go through poisonous swamps to Andante, the hideout of Andantino. The other half of the party were saved by Prince Crescendo of Baroque, with his ship. They encounter pirates and defeat them shortly thereafter. After getting safely into Baroque, the party discuss the situation. Forte is threatening a war, but Baroque wants peace. Crescendo <b>thinks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plan to assassinate Count Waltz of Forte, but the plan is quickly discarded.|$|E

500|$|Influenced by such blues-rock guitarists as Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck, Jimi Hendrix and Jimmy Page, {{and such}} jazz fusion players as John McLaughlin, and Al Di Meola, Lukather {{is known for}} a [...] "melodic and intense" [...] playing style. He has also cited Steely Dan as a major long-time influence—one that emerges {{prominently}} in later solo work such as All's Well That Ends Well. Journalist Jude Gold notes that his vibrato is very pronounced and his [...] "exaggerated wide bends" [...] are distinctive and quickly recognizable. Well-versed in music theory, Lukather can follow chord charts and changes in a way typical of jazz musicians—this ability enhances his value as a session musician. In interviews, he has explained how he <b>thinks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> guitar in a [...] "chordal cluster" [...] format, and not the typical [...] "linear scale" [...] format.|$|E
500|$|Having {{split from}} N.W.A, Dr. Dre's first solo album {{established}} {{him as one}} of the biggest hip hop stars of his era. Yahoo! Music writer S.L. Duff wrote of the album's impact on his status in hip hop at the time, stating [...] "Dre's considerable reputation is based on this release, alongside his production technique on Snoop's Doggystyle" [...] and his early work with N.W.A. Whatever one <b>thinks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> over-the-top bravado rapping, the tracks and beats Dre assembled are beyond reproach". The Chronic brought G-funk to the mainstream – a genre defined by slow bass beats and melodic synthesizers, topped by P-Funk samples, female vocals, and a laconic, laid-back lyrical delivery referred to as a [...] "lazy drawl". The album takes its name from a slang term for premium grade cannabis, chronic. The album cover is an homage to Zig-Zag rolling papers. Robert Christgau said that, although he [...] "can't stand" [...] it, he respects The Chronic [...] "for its influence and iconicity".|$|E

500|$|The {{architectural}} style adopted by William Curtis Green, {{largely based on}} Owen William's design, was {{a departure from the}} Neoclassical with its reinforced concrete covered over with terrazzo slabs. British Modernists were disappointed with the result, describing Green's adaptation as, [...] "a genteel period piece which looks the compromise it is". In comparison to some of the other hotels in London such as the Lanesborough, the building's exterior is unremarkable. It is eight storeys high aside from the ground floor, with the central bay containing three windows on each floor. Christopher Matthew has stated that he <b>thinks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dorchester as a [...] "rather American hotel", {{not only because of the}} strong association with American actors such as Elizabeth Taylor, but because the sweeping 1930s facade reminded him of many of those which appeared in American film musicals. However, he notes that the hotel still remains [...] "very much an English hotel". The hotel became a Grade II Listed Building in January 1981.|$|E
500|$|In a 1998 Presbyterian Record review, Canadian Christian writer Phil Callaway {{writes that}} What's So Amazing About Grace? made him [...] "thankful afresh for God's grace and {{challenged}} {{to live a}} life reflecting it". Callaway was haunted by Yancey's question, [...] "If grace is so amazing, why don't Christians show more of it?" [...] and expressed his appreciation to the author at the 1998 Christian Booksellers Association convention. When he asked Yancey why he wrote the book, the author answered: [...] "I long for the church to become a culture of grace... A graceful church knows how to welcome failure and rewards vulnerability so that a person automatically <b>thinks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> church when needing help." [...] Yancey asked Callaway if he thought the book would generate controversy, and Callaway said it would. Callaway asked Yancey why his book was so harsh in its description of Christians, and Yancey responded, [...] "I'm picking on Christians because I am one". Yancey said that he knew many gracious Christians and that secular culture was filled with examples of ungrace, including media manipulation of body image and the belief that [...] "there ain't {{no such thing as a}} free lunch", which contradicts the concept of undeserved grace from God as taught in Christianity.|$|E
500|$|Reviewing the 2003 Slayer box set Soundtrack to the Apocalypse, Adrien Begrand of PopMatters {{described}} the album as [...] "their most underrated, {{and on this}} set, its five selections show how highly the band <b>thinks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> record". KNAC.coms Peter Atkinson was also positive, saying the album has a [...] "grandiosity and imposing presence" [...] which makes the record [...] "so magnificent". Grave's Ola Lindgren and Bolt Thrower's Karl Willetts both rate South of Heaven as amongst the top five albums of all time, while Max Kolesne of Brazilian death metal group Krisiun remembers hearing the song [...] "Silent Scream" [...] for the first time: [...] "It just blew me away. It was like fast double-bass, fast kicks during the whole song. That was very inspiring for me." [...] When discussing Slayer in an October 2007 interview, Evile frontman Matt Drake stated that while Reign in Blood [...] "was just speed", South of Heaven proved that the group could write [...] "slow material as well". Metal Forces reviewer gives [...] "the band credit for at least {{making an effort to}} try something new and not being afraid to experiment at such a crucial stage of their career", creating [...] "one of the more original sounding thrash / speed metal albums he heard in a long while". He remarks, however, that [...] "if you're expecting to hear Reign in Blood Part Two, you'll be in for a major disappointment".|$|E
