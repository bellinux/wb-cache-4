50|$|Newer {{cases are}} also {{starting}} to be treated by <b>taxotere</b> and gemcitabine. <b>Taxotere</b> is similar to Oncovin used in CHOP; it irreversibly binds beta tubulin halting formation of microtubules. <b>Taxotere</b> has an added benefit though; it also phosphorylates bcl-2 to halt the anti-apoptotic pathway. The dual effect of <b>taxotere</b> on integral cancer pathways makes it a more potent drug than Oncovin. Gemcitabene is a nucleoside analog and when incorporated into DNA during replication leads to apoptosis; the fluorine on the 2’ carbon atom stops other nucleosides from attaching.

50|$|The use of {{chemotherapy}} to treat stomach cancer has no firmly established standard of care. Unfortunately, stomach cancer {{has not been}} particularly sensitive to these drugs, and chemotherapy, if used, has usually served to palliatively {{reduce the size of}} the tumor, relieve symptoms of the disease and increase survival time. Some drugs used in stomach cancer treatment have included: 5-FU (fluorouracil) or its analog capecitabine, BCNU (carmustine), methyl-CCNU (semustine) and doxorubicin (Adriamycin), as well as mitomycin C, and more recently cisplatin and <b>taxotere,</b> often using drugs in various combinations.

5000|$|All {{advances}} in the understanding and treatment of FDCS come from advances made in other cancers. Funding for research {{is hard to come}} by and being such a rare cancer FDCS does not receive monetary priority. CHOP, Gemcitabine, and <b>Taxotere</b> were all initially developed for other cancers, but mutually mutated pathways allow for its use in FDCS. The hallmarks of cancer have helped physicians realize that there are biological commonalities between seemingly very different cancer types that can be exploited to develop new and better treatment plans. While standards of care for FDCS patients have progressed rapidly over the last twenty years the process is slowing. When FDCS was “discovered” in 1986 there was no standard of treatment. Now, 25 years later, there are multiple chemotherapeutic agents used, clinical trials available, and a much greater knowledge of its mechanism of action. This rapid response occurred because physicians modified the use of pre-existing drugs. Financial restrictions mean that further advances rely on research made on other cancer types. Fortunately with constant progress in research technology this process is becoming much faster. The more we know about acquired capabilities of cancer, the more we can target those pathways, put new drugs on the market, and hopefully bring the word [...] "cure" [...] into view.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Both <b>Taxotere</b> and Capecitabine {{have shown}} {{anti-cancer}} activity against various cancers including prostate cancer. In combination, <b>Taxotere</b> plus Capecitabine has demonstrated higher anti-cancer activity in advanced breast cancers. However, the molecular mechanisms of action of <b>Taxotere</b> and Capecitabine {{have not been}} fully elucidated in prostate cancer. Methods The total RNA from PC 3 and LNCaP prostate cells untreated and treated with 2 nM <b>Taxotere,</b> 110 μM Furtulon (active metabolite of Capecitabine), or 1 nM <b>Taxotere</b> plus 50 μM Furtulon for 6, 36, and 72 hours, was subjected to Affymetrix Human Genome U 133 A Array analysis. Real-time PCR and Western Blot analysis were conducted to confirm microarray data. Results <b>Taxotere</b> and Furtulon down-regulated some genes critical for cell proliferation, cell cycle progression, transcription factor, cell signaling, and oncogenesis, and up-regulated some genes related to the induction of apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, and differentiation in both cell lines. <b>Taxotere</b> and Furtulon also up-regulated some genes responsible for chemotherapeutic resistance, suggesting the induction of cancer cell resistance to these agents. Conclusions <b>Taxotere</b> and Furtulon caused the alternation {{of a large number}} of genes, many of which may contribute to the molecular mechanisms by which <b>Taxotere</b> and Furtulon inhibit the growth of prostate cancer cells. This information could be utilized for further mechanistic research and for devising optimized therapeutic strategies against prostate cancer. </p...|$|E
40|$|<b>Taxotere</b> showed {{antitumor}} activity against solid tumors including prostate cancer. However, {{the molecular}} mechanism(s) of action of <b>Taxotere</b> {{has not been}} fully elucidated. In order to establish such molecular mechanism(s) in both hormone-insensitive (PC 3) and hormone-sensitive (LNCaP) prostate cancer cells, comprehensive gene expression profiles were obtained by Affymetrix Human Genome U 133 A Array. The RNA from the cells treated with 2 nM <b>Taxotere</b> was subjected to microarray analysis. We found that a total of 166, 365, and 1785 genes showed greater than twofold change in PC 3 cells after 6, 36, and 72 hours of treatment, respectively compared to 57, 823, and 964 genes in LNCaP cells. The expression of tubulin was decreased, whereas the expression of microtubuleassociated proteins was increased in Taxotere-treated prostate cancer cells, confirming the microtubuletargeting effect of <b>Taxotere.</b> Clustering analysis showed downregulation of some genes for cell proliferation and cell cycle. In contrast, <b>Taxotere</b> upregulated some genes {{that are related to}} induction of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. From these results, we conclude that <b>Taxotere</b> caused alterations {{of a large number of}} genes, many of which may contribute to the molecular mechanism(s) by which <b>Taxotere</b> affects prostate cancer cells. Further molecular studies are needed in order to determine the cause and effect relationships between these genes altered by <b>Taxotere.</b> Nevertheless, our results could be further exploited for devising strategies to optimize therapeutic effects of <b>Taxotere</b> for the treatment of prostate cancer...|$|E

40|$|Activation of Src, {{which has}} an {{intrinsic}} protein tyrosine kinase activity, has been demonstrated in many human tumours, such as colorectal and breast cancers, and is {{closely associated with the}} pathogenesis and metastatic potential of these cancers. In this study, we have examined the effect of activated Src on the sensitivity to <b>taxotere,</b> an anticancer drug targeting microtubules, using v-src-transfected HAG- 1 human gall bladder epithelial cells. As compared with parental HAG- 1 cell line, v-src-transfected HAG/src 3 - 1 cells became 5. 9 and 7. 0 -fold sensitive to <b>taxotere</b> for 2 and 24 -h exposure, respectively. By contrast, HAG- 1 cells transfected with activated Ras, which acts downstream of Src, acquired approximately 2. 5 * 4. 8 -fold <b>taxotere</b> resistance. The <b>taxotere</b> sensitivity in HAG/src 3 - 1 cells was reversed, if not completely, by herbimycin A, a specific inhibitor of Src family protein tyrosine kinase, indicating that Src protein tyrosine kinase augments sensitivity to <b>taxotere.</b> Treatment of HAG/src 3 - 1 cells with <b>taxotere</b> resulted in phosphorylation of Bcl- 2 and subsequent induction of apoptotic cell death, whereas neither Bcl- 2 phosphorylation nor apoptosis occurred in parental or c-H-ras-transfected HAG- 1 cells. Interestingly, the Bcl- 2 protein is overexpressed in v-src-transfected cell line, compared to those in parental or Ras-transfected cell line. Treatment of HAG/src 3 - 1 cells with herbimycin A significantly reduced the expression and phosphorylation of Bcl- 2, and abrogated taxotere-induced apoptosis, suggesting a potential role for Src protein tyrosine kinase in the taxotere-induced apoptotic events. H- 7, a protein kinase C inhibitor and wortmannin, a phosphatidylinositol- 3 kinase (PI- 3 kinase) inhibitor, neither altered <b>taxotere</b> sensitivity nor inhibited taxotere-induced apoptosis in these cells.
