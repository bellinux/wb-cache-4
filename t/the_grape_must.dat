25|$|Different {{techniques}} are employed {{to adjust the}} level of sugar in <b>the</b> <b>grape</b> <b>must.</b> In the normal chaptalization process, cane sugar {{is the most common}} type of sugar added, although some winemakers prefer beet sugar or corn syrup. In many wine regions, brown sugar is an illegal additive, and in regions that disallow chaptalization altogether, grape concentrate may be added. After sugar is added to the must, naturally occurring enzymes break down the sucrose molecules in sugar into glucose and fructose, which are then fermented by the yeast and converted into alcohol and carbon dioxide.|$|E
25|$|If grape {{pressing}} was used, {{an estate}} would press the skins {{one to three}} times. Since juice from later pressings would be coarser and more tannic, the third pressing normally made wine of low quality called lora. After pressing, <b>the</b> <b>grape</b> <b>must</b> was stored in large earthenware jars known as dolia. With a capacity of up to several thousand liters, these jars were often partially buried into the floors of a barn or warehouse. Fermentation {{took place in the}} dolium, lasting from two weeks to a month before the wine was removed and put in amphoras for storage. Small holes drilled into the top allowed the carbon dioxide gas to escape.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 19th century the French {{government}} commissioned Louis Pasteur {{to conduct a}} study on the problems plaguing the French wine industry. His findings had a lasting influence on the science of French winemaking. Pasteur was asked to help identify wine quality control issues that caused spoilage and other faults. During the 3 to 4 years that Pasteur spent studying wine he observed and explained the process of fermentation—noted that it was living organisms (yeast) that convert sugar in <b>the</b> <b>grape</b> <b>must</b> into alcohol in some form of chemical reaction. He also noted the presence of glycerol and succinic acid in wine as well as the beneficial process of adding tartaric acid during winemaking. Another observation that Pasteur made was that oxygen {{played a significant role in}} the aging and improvement of wine.|$|E

25|$|After fermentation, the must is {{normally}} high in malic acid and producers {{will put the}} wine through malolactic fermentation to soften the wine. The process of chaptalization, adding sugar to <b>the</b> <b>grape</b> <b>must</b> to boost alcohol levels, has been a controversial issue for Beaujolais winemakers. Historically, Beaujolais producers would pick grapes at ripeness that were at minimum potential alcohol levels of 10-10.5% and then add sugar in order to artificially boost the alcohol levels to the near the maximum of 13-13.5%. This created wines lacking structure and balance {{to go with the}} high alcohol body and mouthfeel. The recent trend towards higher quality wine production has limited the use of chaptalization in the premium levels of Beaujolais wine. Filtering the wine in order to stabilize it is practiced to varying degrees by Beaujolais winemakers. Some producers who make Beaujolais on a large commercial scale will filter the wine aggressively to avoid any impurity or future chemical reactions. This can have the negative side effect of diminishing some of the wine's unique fruit character and leave a flavor that critics have described as Jell-O-like.|$|E

2500|$|Another {{advancement}} in the horizontal batch press was the complete enclosure {{of the press}} (sometimes called [...] "tank press") that reduced the exposure of <b>the</b> <b>grape</b> <b>must</b> to air. Some advance presses can even be flushed with nitrogen to create a complete anaerobic environment that can be desired for wine making with white wine grapes. Additionally, many of today's modern presses are computerized which allows the operator to control exactly how much pressure is being applied to the grape skins and for how many cycles.|$|E
50|$|The allowed base yield is 35 hectoliter per hectare. <b>The</b> <b>grapes</b> <b>must</b> reach a {{maturity}} {{corresponding to}} a sugar content {{of at least}} 189 grams per liter of <b>grape</b> <b>must</b> and 11.5 per cent alcohol by volume. When chaptalization is allowed, the alcohol level after chaptalization may not exceed 14.5 per cent.|$|R
50|$|This {{produces}} a lower yield, about 10 percent lower per hectare. <b>The</b> <b>grapes</b> <b>must</b> also be picked riper at harvest with higher natural sugar levels resulting in 10 percent natural alcohol level compared to 9.5 percent for regular Bordeaux.|$|R

2500|$|In the 18th century, Chile {{was known}} mostly for its sweet wines {{made from the}} Pais and Muscatel grapes. To achieve {{a high level of}} {{sweetness}} the wines were often boiled which concentrated <b>the</b> <b>grape</b> <b>must.</b> Following his shipwreck off the coast at Cape Horn, Admiral John Byron (Grandfather of the poet Lord Byron) traveled across Chile and came back to England with a glowing review of Chilean Muscatel comparing it favorably to Madeira. The 19th century wine writer André Jullien was not as impressed, comparing Chilean wines to a [...] "potion of rhubarb and senna".|$|E
2500|$|The {{source for}} these {{nutrients}} is {{often found in}} <b>the</b> <b>grape</b> <b>must</b> itself, though MLF inoculations that run concurrent with alcoholic fermentation risk the yeast outcompeting the bacteria for these nutrients. Towards the end of fermentation, {{while most of the}} original grape must resources have been consumed, the lysis of dead yeast cells (the [...] "lees") can be a source for some nutrients, particularly amino acids. Plus, even [...] "dry" [...] wines that have been fermented to dryness still have unfermentable pentose sugars (such as arabinose, ribose and xylose) left behind that can be used by both positive and spoilage bacteria. As with wine yeast, manufacturers of cultured LAB inoculum usually offer specially prepared nutritional additives that be used as a supplement. However, unlike wine yeast, lactic acid bacteria can not use the supplement diammonium phosphate as a nitrogen source.|$|E
2500|$|The {{addition}} of cultured yeast normally occurs with the yeast {{first in a}} dried or [...] "inactive" [...] state and is [...] reactivated in warm water or diluted grape juice prior to being added to the must. To thrive and be active in fermentation, the yeast needs access to a continuous supply of carbon, nitrogen, sulfur, phosphorus as well as access to various vitamins and minerals. These components are naturally present in <b>the</b> <b>grape</b> <b>must</b> but their amount may be corrected by adding nutrients to the wine, in order to foster a more encouraging environment for the yeast. Newly formulated time-release nutrients, specifically manufactured for wine fermentations, offer the most advantageous conditions for yeast. Oxygen is needed as well, but in wine making, the risk of oxidation {{and the lack of}} alcohol production from oxygenated yeast requires the exposure of oxygen to be kept at a minimum.|$|E

2500|$|The {{primary role}} of yeast is {{to convert the}} sugars present (namely glucose) in <b>the</b> <b>grape</b> <b>must</b> into alcohol. The yeast accomplishes this by {{utilizing}} glucose {{through a series of}} metabolic pathways that, in the presence of oxygen, produces not only large amounts of energy for the cell but also many different intermediates that the cell needs to function. In the absence of oxygen (and sometimes even in the presence oxygen), the cell will continue some metabolic functions (such as glycolysis) but will rely on other pathways such as reduction of acetaldehyde into ethanol (fermentation) to [...] "recharge" [...] the co-enzymes needed to keep metabolism going. It is through this process of fermentation that ethanol is released by the yeast cells as a waste product. Eventually, if the yeast cells are healthy and fermentation is allowed to run to the completion, all fermentable sugars will be used up by the yeast with only the unfermentable pentose leaving behind a negligible amount of residual sugar.|$|E
2500|$|As {{with red}} wine-making, {{harvesting}} is manual or mechanized, and may include sorting. The grapes are then transferred into a press to be pressed. [...] Once <b>the</b> <b>grape</b> <b>must</b> {{is in the}} tank, the sludge is removed, normally after certain enzymes have been added. At this stage pre-fermentation cold stabulation (at temperatures between 10 and 12°C for several days) may be carried out {{in order to promote}} the extraction of aromas. [...] Normally, however, after 12 to 48 hours, the clear juice is drawn off and left to ferment. Alcoholic fermentation continues under supervision, particular attention being paid to the temperature, which must remain more or less stable (between 18 and 24 degrees Celsius). If necessary, chaptalization is also carried out in order to boost the alcoholic strength by volume. Malolactic fermentation and maturing then take place in barrels or in vats. Once this process is completed, the wine is filtered in order to clarify it. The final stage of the whole operation is the bottling of the wine.|$|E
2500|$|Upon the {{introduction}} of active yeasts to <b>the</b> <b>grape</b> <b>must,</b> phosphates {{are attached to the}} sugar and the six-carbon sugar molecules begin to be split into three-carbon pieces and go through a series of rearrangement reactions. During this process, the carboxylic carbon atom is released in the form of carbon dioxide with the remaining components becoming acetaldehyde. The absence of oxygen in this [...] process allows the acetaldehyde to be eventually converted, by reduction, to ethanol. During the conversion of acetaldehyde, a small amount is converted, by oxidation, to acetic acid which, in excess, can contribute to the wine fault known as volatile acidity (vinegar taint). After the yeast has exhausted its life cycle, they fall {{to the bottom of the}} fermentation tank as sediment known as lees. Yeast ceases its activity whenever all of the sugar in must has been converted into other chemicals or whenever the alcohol content has reached 15% alcohol per unit volume; a concentration strong enough to halt the enzymatic activity of almost all strains of yeast.|$|E

2500|$|In the 20th century, wine presses {{advanced}} {{from the}} vertical style pressing {{of the basket}} press and ancient wine press to horizontal pressing with pressure either being applied at one or both ends or from the side through use of an airbag or bladder.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{interaction}} between rootstock, scion {{and the environment}} may induce different responses to the grapevine physiology and, consequently, to <b>the</b> <b>grape</b> composition. <b>The</b> vineyards of Serra Gaúcha, Brazil, are established in different soil types, each with different morphological and physicochemical attributes. Moreover, the grapevines are grafted onto a diversity of rootstocks. Therefore, this study aimed {{to determine the effect}} of 15 rootstocks in the composition of the Cabernet Sauvignon (CS) <b>grape</b> <b>must.</b> <b>The</b> following rootstocks were used: Rupestris du Lot, 101 - 14 Mgt., 3309 C, 420 A Mgt., 5 BB K, 161 - 49 C, SO 4, Solferino, 1103 P, 99 R, 110 R, Gravesac, Fercal, Dogridge and Isabel, featuring some genetic diversity altogether. The experimental design was in randomized blocks with 15 treatments, three replicates, 10 vines per plot. <b>The</b> <b>grapes</b> were harvested at maturity for four years, and then crushed for winemaking. Next, <b>the</b> <b>grape</b> <b>musts</b> were centrifuged to separate the solid phase from the liquid phase, which was used for analyses related to sugar, acidity and minerals.
