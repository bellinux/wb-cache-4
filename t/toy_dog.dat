5|$|The American Kennel Club has two classes, English Toy Spaniel (B/PC) (Blenheim and Prince Charles) and English Toy Spaniel (R/KC), {{while in}} the UK, the Kennel Club places the breed in a single class. Under the Fédération Cynologique Internationale groups, the King Charles {{is placed in the}} English Toy Spaniel section within the Companion and <b>Toy</b> <b>Dog</b> Group, along with the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel.|$|E
5|$|The Pomeranian (often {{known as}} a Pom or Pom Pom) is a breed of dog of the Spitz type that is named for the Pomerania region in Germany and Poland in Central Europe. Classed as a <b>toy</b> <b>dog</b> breed because of its small size, the Pomeranian is descended from the larger Spitz type dogs, {{specifically}} the German Spitz. It has been determined by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale {{to be part of}} the German Spitz breed; and in many countries, they are known as the Zwergspitz ("Dwarf-Spitz").|$|E
5|$|The lack {{of numbers}} and {{political}} {{isolation of the}} country at the time caused {{the creation of a new}} breed quite distinct from the former English style <b>toy</b> <b>dog</b> as breeders sought to stabilise the remaining toy sized terriers into a standard breed. The resulting contemporary Russian Toy has most of the features of the classic toy terrier, with the addition of some new characteristics. The head is high but not wide, the cheeks are flat and the eyes are round. By 1960, 76 dogs were entered into an exhibition and the first standard for the two Russian Toy varieties was written in 1966 and authorized by the Ministry of Agriculture.|$|E

50|$|Latex {{and rubber}} <b>dog</b> <b>toys</b> {{are great for}} dog entertainment. With these <b>toys,</b> <b>dogs</b> that are {{aggressive}} chewers have a safe way to satisfy their biting instincts. These toys also help keep dogs' gums and teeth clean and healthy. In general, hard rubber bones and other latex <b>dog</b> <b>toys</b> help improve dogs' overall oral hygiene.|$|R
25|$|The use of {{the term}} toy to refer to dogs is based on tradition, and is not a precise classification. Dogs {{traditionally}} referred to as <b>toy</b> <b>dogs</b> are usually the very smallest <b>dogs.</b> <b>Toy</b> <b>dogs</b> can be one of several dog types. Some are of ancient lap dog types, and some are small versions of hunting dog, spitz, or terrier types, bred down in size for a particular kind of work or to create a pet of convenient size. The very smallest dogs are sometimes called Teacup, although no major dog registry recognizes that term.|$|R

25|$|The mouse deer, a small tusked deer {{as large}} as a <b>toy</b> <b>dog</b> or cat, mostly can be found on Sumatra, Borneo (Indonesia) and in Palawan Islands (Philippines).

25|$|Toy Group is {{the name}} of a breed group of the {{smallest}} kinds of dogs, used by kennel clubs to classify a defined collection of <b>dog</b> breeds. <b>Toy</b> Group does not necessarily refer to one particular type of dog. Most major English-language kennel clubs include a Toy Group although different kennel clubs may not include the same breeds in their Toy Group. The international kennel club association, the Fédération Cynologique Internationale, includes <b>toy</b> <b>dogs</b> in Group 9 Companion and <b>Toy</b> <b>Dogs,</b> which is then further broken down into eleven Sections based on dog type and breed history.|$|R

25|$|Soon {{after moving}} in with Butler, Genie started showing {{the first signs of}} {{reaching}} puberty, marking dramatic improvement in her overall physical health and definitively putting her past Lenneberg's proposed critical period for language acquisition. Butler continued to observe and document Genie's hoarding, in particular noting that Genie collected and kept dozens of containers of liquid in her room. Although she could not discern the reason for Genie's intense fear of cats and dogs, after witnessing it firsthand Butler and the man she was dating—who was a retired University of Southern California professor and psychologist—tried to help her overcome it by watching episodes of the television series Lassie with her and giving her a battery-powered <b>toy</b> <b>dog.</b> Butler wrote that Genie could eventually tolerate fenced dogs, but that there was no progress with cats.|$|E

500|$|The Cavalier King Charles Spaniel {{is a small}} spaniel classed as a <b>toy</b> <b>dog</b> by The Kennel Club and the American Kennel Club. It {{originated}} in the United Kingdom {{and is one of}} the more popular breeds in many countries. Since 2000, it has grown in popularity in the United States and ranks as the 18th most popular pure-breed in the United States (2013 Registration Statistics). [...] It has a silky, smooth coat and commonly a smooth undocked tail. The breed standard recognizes four colours: Blenheim (chestnut and white), Tricolor (black/white/tan), Black and Tan, and Ruby. The breed is generally friendly, affectionate and good with both children and other animals; however, [...] they require a lot of human interaction. Since they are a family dog, it is recommended to not leave them alone for long periods at a time. The expected average lifespan of a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel is under ten years.|$|E
500|$|After {{failing to}} cross a musical and {{colorful}} bridge, the gang falls into a pit where sticky material becomes their zombie-like doppelgangers and moves to chase them. They escape through a Super Mario World-like environment {{and go to the}} house of a <b>toy</b> <b>dog,</b> where they are set up for a trap to eat crumpets with sleeping powder. Mac does not eat the crumpets (since the sleeping powder was thought to be powdered sugar, and he can't eat sugar without temporarily losing his mind) and is able to save the others. As they try to escape, they discover that the heroic man and several others they have met on their journey are all controlled by a single face—World—who can animate and control seemingly anything he latches onto. World is trapped on an apple and the gang leaves it at a desert; but latches on a horse, truly the guise of Mac and the gang rides by, and World is able to move once more. It gallops off to the castle, where the gang find Frankie and attempt to save her. However, Frankie reveals that World never kidnapped her, she was staying of her own free will and is happy to be away from the work at Foster's and Mr. Herriman's constant nagging. The friends then plead with Frankie to come home insisting that they need her to take care of them. She believes their pleas to be selfish and storms off as she is [...] "sick of taking care of everyone and everything without never even receiving a word of thanks, an ounce of help, or a tiny little smidgen of respect". They attempt to console her, but World gasses them and they fall asleep. When they awaken, they find themselves in a fake version of Foster's created by World, who shrank them into it.|$|E
2500|$|The Griffon Bruxellois or [...] Brussels Griffon is a {{breed of}} <b>toy</b> <b>dog,</b> named for their city of origin: Brussels, Belgium. The Griffon Bruxellois may refer to three {{different}} breeds, the Griffon Bruxellois, the Griffon Belge and the Petit Brabançon.

50|$|As days pass, {{domestic}} dogs eat all {{easily available}} food {{and begin to}} fight amongst each other for supremacy. The bigger dogs make packs and attack and eat the small ones.

25|$|Although {{weight is}} not {{specified}} by the breed standard, <b>toy</b> <b>dogs</b> usually range from 6-11lbs, miniature dogs from 10-21lbs, and standard-sized dogs from 19-40lbs. Some overlap in weight ranges occurs because the size category that an American Eskimo Dog falls into is set by its height at the withers, and not its weight.|$|R
2500|$|In addition, Toy dogs in {{particular}} {{have been used for}} crossbreeding to create what are called designer dogs, bred either accidentally or to enhance the marketability of puppies, often with cute portmanteau names created from syllables of each breed name. Although there are clubs willing to [...] "register" [...] such designer dogs, they are not breeds of dog. They may be called toy dogs but they are not part of any <b>Toy</b> <b>Dog</b> Group.|$|E
2500|$|Greyhound {{owners and}} {{adoption}} groups consider Greyhounds wonderful pets. Greyhounds are quiet, gentle and loyal to owners. They are very loving, {{and enjoy the}} company of their humans and other dogs. Whether a Greyhound will enjoy the company of other small animals, such as cats, depends on the individual dog's personality. Greyhounds will typically chase small animals; those lacking a high 'prey drive' {{will be able to}} coexist happily with <b>toy</b> <b>dog</b> breeds and/or cats. Many owners describe their Greyhounds as [...] "45-mile-per-hour couch potatoes".|$|E
