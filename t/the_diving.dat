5|$|The major diving {{accident}} and fatality research {{studies that have}} been conducted globally including work by the Divers Alert Network, <b>the</b> <b>Diving</b> Incident Monitoring Study, and Project Stickybeak have each identified cases where the mortality was associated with <b>the</b> <b>diving</b> cylinder.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} modes of diving based on <b>the</b> <b>diving</b> {{equipment}} used.|$|E
5|$|Basic {{decompression}} {{theory and}} use of decompression tables {{is part of the}} theory component of training for commercial divers, and dive planning based on decompression tables, and the practice and field management of decompression is {{a significant part of the}} work of <b>the</b> <b>diving</b> supervisor.|$|E
5000|$|If <b>the</b> <b>dive</b> {{computer}} {{fails at}} any time during <b>the</b> <b>dive,</b> <b>the</b> <b>dive</b> must be terminated and appropriate surfacing procedures should be initiated immediately.|$|R
25|$|A {{recreational}} diver may expect many {{of these}} items to be arranged by the service provider (<b>the</b> <b>dive</b> boat operator, shop, or school providing thansport to <b>the</b> <b>dive</b> site and organising <b>the</b> <b>dive).</b>|$|R
25|$|The skills include selection, {{functional}} testing, {{preparation and}} transport of scuba equipment, dive planning, {{preparation for a}} dive, kitting up for <b>the</b> <b>dive,</b> water entry, descent, breathing underwater, monitoring <b>the</b> <b>dive</b> profile (depth, time and decompression status), personal breathing gas management, situational awareness, communicating with <b>the</b> <b>dive</b> team, buoyancy and trim control, mobility in the water, ascent, emergency and rescue procedures, exit from the water, un-kitting after <b>the</b> <b>dive,</b> cleaning and preparation of equipment for storage and recording <b>the</b> <b>dive,</b> within <b>the</b> scope of the diver's certification.|$|R
5|$|Counsel for the Commonwealth Crown Solicitor {{presented}} {{evidence that}} the Amana was on fire before it first struck trees. Counsel for the widow {{of one of the}} victims suggested the crash may have been caused by the elevator trim tab jamming in <b>the</b> <b>diving</b> position.|$|E
5|$|The {{atmospheric}} pressure decreases with altitude, {{and this has}} an effect on the absolute pressure of <b>the</b> <b>diving</b> environment. The most important effect is that the diver must decompress to a lower surface pressure, and this requires longer decompression for the same dive profile.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>diving</b> {{environment}} {{is limited by}} accessibility and risk, but includes water and occasionally other liquids. Most underwater diving {{is done in the}} shallower coastal parts of the oceans, and inland bodies of fresh water, including lakes, dams, quarries, rivers, springs, flooded caves, reservoirs, tanks, swimming pools, and canals, but may also be done in large bore ducting and sewers, power station cooling systems, cargo and ballast tanks of ships, and liquid-filled industrial equipment. The environment may affect gear configuration: for instance, freshwater is less dense than saltwater, so less added weight is needed to achieve diver neutral buoyancy in freshwater dives. Water temperature, visibility and movement also affect the diver and the dive plan. Diving in liquids other than water may present special problems due to density, viscosity and chemical compatibility of diving equipment, as well as possible environmental hazards to <b>the</b> <b>diving</b> team.|$|E
2500|$|Maintaining active {{communication}} throughout <b>the</b> <b>dive</b> {{by means}} of hand signals and regular monitoring of each other's gauges during <b>the</b> <b>dive.</b> [...] Also, checking that the buddy is OK with the conditions and progress of <b>the</b> <b>dive</b> via such hand signals.|$|R
5000|$|Sometimes the line, once at <b>the</b> <b>dive</b> site on <b>the</b> seabed, {{is tied to}} <b>the</b> <b>dive</b> site {{to guard}} against the weight {{dragging}} away from the site. The line itself may be tied to <b>the</b> <b>dive</b> site or a thin [...] "waster" [...] line may attach the strong line to <b>the</b> <b>dive</b> site. If a waster is used, the boat at the surface {{can be used to}} break the waster at <b>the</b> end of <b>diving</b> before <b>the</b> shot is lifted. If the main line is attached to <b>the</b> <b>dive</b> site, <b>the</b> divers must untie it before ascending at <b>the</b> end of <b>diving</b> otherwise they lose their shot.|$|R
25|$|Procedures for diving from a boat vary {{depending}} on <b>the</b> boat, <b>the</b> <b>dive</b> site and <b>the</b> <b>dive</b> plan.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>diving</b> reflex is a {{response}} to immersion that overrides the basic homeostatic reflexes. It optimises respiration by preferentially distributing oxygen stores to the heart and brain, which allows extended periods underwater. It is exhibited strongly in aquatic mammals (seals, otters, dolphins and muskrats), and also exists in other mammals, including humans. Diving birds, such as penguins, have a similar diving reflex. <b>The</b> <b>diving</b> reflex is triggered by chilling the face and holding the breath. The cardiovascular system constricts peripheral blood vessels, slows the pulse rate, redirects blood to the vital organs to conserve oxygen, releases red blood cells stored in the spleen, and, in humans, causes heart rhythm irregularities. Aquatic mammals have evolved physiological adaptations to conserve oxygen during submersion, but apnea, slowed pulse rate, and vasoconstriction are shared with terrestrial mammals.|$|E
5|$|The family Procellariidae is a {{group of}} seabirds that {{comprises}} the fulmarine petrels, the gadfly petrels, the prions, and the shearwaters. This family is part of the bird order Procellariiformes (or tubenoses), which also includes the albatrosses, the storm petrels, and <b>the</b> <b>diving</b> petrels.|$|E
5|$|The {{molecular}} {{evidence suggests}} that the storm petrels were the first to diverge from the ancestral stock, and the albatrosses next, with the procellariids and diving petrels splitting most recently. Many taxonomists used to retain <b>the</b> <b>diving</b> petrels in this family also, but today their distinctiveness is considered well supported.|$|E
50|$|Some {{organisations such as}} the AAUS have {{recommended}} that a dive plan should be established before <b>the</b> <b>dive</b> and then followed throughout <b>the</b> <b>dive</b> unless <b>the</b> <b>dive</b> is aborted. This dive plan should be {{within the limits of}} the decompression tables to increase the margin of safety, and to provide a backup decompression schedule based on <b>the</b> <b>dive</b> tables in case the computer fails underwater. The disadvantage of this extremely conservative use of dive computers is that when used this way, <b>the</b> <b>dive</b> computer is merely used as a bottom timer, and the advantages of real time computation of decompression status are sacrificed.|$|R
25|$|Pre-dive checks {{range from}} {{inspection}} and testing of personal diving equipment, to review of <b>the</b> <b>dive</b> plan, with <b>the</b> <b>dive</b> team.|$|R
5000|$|The {{source of}} <b>the</b> <b>Dives</b> is near Exmes, in the Orne department. <b>The</b> <b>Dives</b> flows {{generally}} north through the following departments and towns: ...|$|R
5|$|Trapezes {{are often}} used with diving shots. When diving in tidal waters {{at the end of}} slack water, the trapeze may be {{released}} from <b>the</b> <b>diving</b> shot to drift in the current as the divers make their decompression stops.|$|E
5|$|Some {{knowledge}} of physiology and {{the physics of}} diving is considered necessary by most diver certification agencies, as <b>the</b> <b>diving</b> environment is alien and relatively hostile to humans. The physics and physiology knowledge required is fairly basic, and helps the diver to understand the effects of <b>the</b> <b>diving</b> environment so that informed acceptance of the associated risks is possible. The physics mostly relates to gases under pressure, buoyancy, heat loss, and light underwater. The physiology relates the physics to the effects on the human body, to provide {{a basic understanding of}} the causes and risks of barotrauma, DCS, gas toxicity, hypothermia, drowning and sensory variations. More advanced training often involves first aid and rescue skills, skills related to specialised diving equipment, and underwater work skills. Further training is required to develop the skills necessary for diving in a wider range of environments, with specialised equipment, and to become competent to perform a variety of underwater tasks.|$|E
5|$|The street started {{being used}} for {{commercial}} purposes {{at the beginning of}} the 19th century and houses were converted for this use. Ground floors became used as shops, while upper floors and back rooms were used as workshops, particularly for metalwork. Augustus Siebe, the pioneer of <b>the</b> <b>diving</b> helmet, lived and worked on the street, and today there is an English Heritage blue plaque commemorating him on the house where he lived.|$|E
40|$|Ground-based analogs of spaceflight are an {{important}} means of studying physiologic and nutritional changes associated with space travel, and the NASA Extreme Environment Mission Operations V (NEEMO) is such an analog. To determine whether saturation diving has nutrition-related effects {{similar to those of}} spaceflight, we conducted a clinical nutritional assessment of the NEEMO crew (4 men, 2 women) before, during, and after their 14 -d saturation dive. Blood and urine samples were collected before, during, and after <b>the</b> <b>dive.</b> <b>The</b> foods consumed by the crew were typical of the spaceflight food system. A number of physiologic changes were observed, during and after <b>the</b> <b>dive,</b> that are also commonly observed during spaceflight. Hemoglobin and hematocrit were lower (P < 0. 05) after <b>the</b> <b>dive.</b> Transferrin receptors were significantly lower immediately after <b>the</b> <b>dive.</b> Serum ferritin increased significantly during <b>the</b> <b>dive.</b> There was also evidence indicating that oxidative damage and stress increased during <b>the</b> <b>dive.</b> Glutathione peroxidase and superoxide dismutase decreased during and after <b>the</b> <b>dive</b> (P < 0. 05). Decreased leptin during <b>the</b> <b>dive</b> (P < 0. 05) may have been related to the increased stress. Subjects had decreased energy intake and weight loss during <b>the</b> <b>dive,</b> similar to what is observed during spaceflight. Together, these similarities to spaceflight provide a model to use in further defining the physiologic effects of spaceflight and investigating potential countermeasures...|$|R
25|$|Lights: Each cave diver {{should have}} at least three {{independent}} sources of light. One is considered the primary and is intended for general use during <b>the</b> <b>dive.</b> <b>The</b> others are considered backup lights and may be lower powered as they are not intended for exploration. Each light must have an expected burn time of at least the planned duration of <b>the</b> <b>dive.</b> If any diver loses light function so that they have fewer than three working lights, protocol requires that <b>the</b> <b>dive</b> is turned for all members of <b>the</b> <b>dive</b> team and exit started immediately.|$|R

5|$|U-1 {{had several}} {{features}} typical of Lake's designs, including a diving chamber under {{the bow and}} two variable pitch propellers. Lake's design also called for two retractable wheels that allowed travel over the seabed. The design also placed <b>the</b> <b>diving</b> tanks above the waterline of the single, cylindrical hull, which necessitated a heavy ballast keel for vertical stability. This arrangement required mechanical pumping, a procedure that took 8 minutes. U-1s propulsion system consisted of two gasoline engines for surface running and two electric motors for running while submerged.|$|E
5|$|After U-3s {{arrival at}} Pola in January 1909, she was {{commissioned}} into the Austro-Hungarian Navy on 12 September 1909 as SM U-3. During {{the evaluation of}} the U-3 class conducted by the Navy, the class' poor diving and handling characteristics were noted. To alleviate <b>the</b> <b>diving</b> problems, U-3s fins were changed in size and shape several times, and eventually, the front diving planes were removed and a stationary stern flap was affixed to the hull. U-3 served as a training boat between 1910 and 1914 and made as many as ten cruises per month in that capacity.|$|E
5|$|Alan and Barry {{start to}} learn about the past of Cauldron Lake from other townsfolk. They believe an entity called the Dark Presence is trapped within the lake and is trying to escape by using its powers to turn fiction into reality. It has {{previously}} tried this with a writer known as Thomas Zane—the figure in <b>the</b> <b>diving</b> suit—but Zane was able to resist its will and died during the eruption that sank the island. The Dark Presence has grown strong enough to start to influence the townspeople and create the forces that have chased Alan. That night, as Alan and Barry take shelter, they get drunk on moonshine, and Alan starts to recall memories of being forced to write Departure during the prior week, and realizes that the Dark Presence is now trying to use his writings to escape.|$|E

5|$|Both {{boats were}} {{commissioned}} into the Austro-Hungarian Navy in 1909, with U-4 commissioned in August and U-3 in September. During the evaluations {{conducted by the}} Navy, the U-3 design bested the U-1 (Lake) and U-5 (Holland) classes in reliability and provided the best living conditions. They did, however, have the worst diving abilities of the three designs, and produced excessive exhaust smoke. To remedy <b>the</b> <b>diving</b> problems of the U-3-class, the fins were changed in size and shape several times. Eventually the front diving planes were removed and a stationary stern flap was affixed to the hull.|$|E
5|$|Calculus' shark-shaped {{submarine}} was visually {{based on}} a real American submarine; Hergé had seen a picture of this in a German newspaper. <b>The</b> <b>diving</b> suit worn in the story was also based on clippings that Hergé had accumulated. Similarly, the dockside bar depicted by the cartoonist was {{based on a}}n illustration that he had collected. The shop where Haddock and Tintin buy <b>the</b> <b>diving</b> equipment, including the suit, was inspired from a picture of a bar which was featured in the German magazine, Berliner Illustrirte Zeitung. The tribal effigy found on a Caribbean island by Sir Francis Haddock was based on a Bamileke tribal statue from Cameroon that Hergé saw in a museum. The Sirius, which had appeared before in The Shooting Star, was named after the SS Sirius, the first ship to cross the Atlantic Ocean solely under steam power, but was visually based upon the design of a trawler, the John-O.88. Hergé had sketched this ship in Ostend docks before obtaining both detailed plans of the trawler from the builders, Jos Boel & Son, and a small-scale model of it from a collector. The undersea wreck of the Unicorn was loosely inspired by images of the wreck of a 17th-century Swedish vessel, the Vasa, which Hergé had collected. The instance in the story in which a shark swallows a large box (that the characters hope contains the treasure) is based on a real account of a shark that swallowed a camera from the American underwater photographer Otis Barton, which Hergé had encountered in a French illustrated magazine.|$|E
5|$|In {{a parody}} of <b>The</b> <b>Diving</b> Bell and the Butterfly, Homer begins to {{decorate}} the house for Halloween and is reaching for a decoration in a box. Unfortunately, {{there is a real}} Black Widow spider in the box and when Homer grabs what he thinks is a plastic spider, he is bitten by it. The bite leaves Homer paralyzed and unable to speak. When Lisa reads for him, she discovers that he can communicate through farting. The Simpson family is amazed at the result and Lisa helps Homer tell Marge how he feels about her. When he is again bitten by another spider (a radioactive one this time), he gains the ability to shoot spider webs out of his rear end and have the same abilities as Spider-Man, though he is still unable to move or talk.|$|E
25|$|Most {{inflator}} {{problems can}} be avoided by keeping gear maintained and dry before <b>the</b> <b>dive,</b> using a low flow rate for inflation and avoiding long bursts, and having warm water at <b>the</b> <b>dive</b> site to thaw gear since ambient air temperature is usually well below freezing and this usually causes BCD issues before <b>the</b> <b>dive.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The buoy marks <b>the</b> <b>dive</b> {{site for}} <b>the</b> {{people on the}} surface, who are {{generally}} on <b>the</b> <b>dive</b> boat, who provide safety cover for the divers.
