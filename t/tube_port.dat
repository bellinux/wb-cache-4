A fast flux irradiation device (FFID) was developed for the Texas A&M Nuclear Science Center's one-megawatt (I-MW) TRIGA reactor, primarily to service the fields of geochronology and thermochronology with unprecedented irradiation characteristics for the Ar 40 /Ar 39 dating technique. The FFID consisted of a dry vertical <b>tube</b> <b>port</b> that extended from the reactor core to the reactor support bridge. A boron-shielded rotisserie, inserted into the vertical <b>tube</b> <b>port,</b> was used to house the samples in the core region, being stabilized radially from below the rotisserie by a bayonet and above the rotisserie by polyethylene plugs. The polyethylene plugs also served as shields to minimize the gamma and neutron dose rates at the reactor bridge level. The rotisserie employs a 0. 71 rpm motor for continual rotation during irradiation. The FFID was intended to be operated at full reactor power (one-megawatt thermal). The first four irradiations revealed that the FFID provided nearly ideal irradiation characteristics for the dating technique. The extent of the thermal neutron interference reaction K 40 (n,p) Ar 4 O was reduced to levels too small to be measured by the existing standards (K salts and K glass) used by the experimenters. Additionally, the boron shield reduced the quantities of thermal neutron-induced activation products by two to three order s of magnitude. This reduction allowed decay periods to be decreased from several weeks to as little as three days. The radial stability provided by the FFID reduced circumferential flux gradients to below 0. 4 %, far less than the 2. 4 % to 3. 4 % observed at other reactor facilities. The one major drawback in the FFID design was the evidence of temperatures in the sample region in excess of 600 ' F, indicated by the melting of cadmium metal during characterization. This problem could be reduced by either decreasing the reaction rate (operating at a lower reactor power), or instituting a heat removal system involving the continual flow of a gas that does not easily activate...|$|E
40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) Gastric {{residual}} volume (GRV) is a clinical assessment to evaluate gastric emptying and enteral feeding tolerance. Factors {{such as the}} tube size, tube material, <b>tube</b> <b>port</b> configuration, placement of the tube in the gastric fluid, the amount of fluid and person completing the assessment may influence the accuracy of {{residual volume}} assessment. Little {{attention has been paid}} to assessing the accuracy of GRV measurement when the actual volume being aspirated is known, and no studies have compared the accuracy in obtaining RV using the three different techniques reported in the literature that are used to obtain aspirate in practice (syringe, suction, and gravity drainage). This in vitro study evaluated three different methods for aspirating feeding formula through two different tube sizes (10 Fr [small] and 18 Fr [large]), tube materials (polyvinyl chloride and polyurethane), using four levels of nursing experience (student, novice, experienced and expert) blinded to the five fixed fluid volumes of feeding formula in a simulated stomach, to determine if the RV can be accurately obtained. The study design consisted of a 3 x 2 x 2 x 4 x 5 completely randomized factorial ANOVA (with a total of 240 cells) and 479 RV assessments were made by the four nurse participants. All three methods (syringe, suction and gravity) used to aspirate RV did not perform substantially well in aspirating fluid, and on average, the methods were able to aspirate about 50 % of the volume available. The syringe and suction techniques were comparable and produced higher proportions of RVs, although the interrater reliability of RV assessment was better with the syringe method. The gravity technique generally performed poorly. Overall, the polyvinyl chloride material and smaller tubes were associated with higher RV assessments. RV assessment is a variable assessment and the three methods did not perform well in this in vitro study. These findings should be further explored and confirmed using larger samples. This knowledge will be important in establishing the best technique for assessing RV to maximize EN delivery in practice and will contribute to future research to test strategies to optimize EN intake in critically ill patients...|$|E

40|$|Air-to-refrigerant {{microchannel}} {{heat exchangers}} (MCHXs) {{are now being}} used in the heating, ventilation, air-conditioning and refrigeration (HVAC 2 ̆ 6 R) industry. The previous research and development of MCHXs has reached a plateau, in that, the optimum designs cannot be further improved with the limited number of geometry related design variables currently available. The ever-evolving simulation and manufacturing capabilities have given engineers new opportunities in pursuing complex and cost-efficient novel heat exchanger designs. Recently, microchannel heat exchanger designs with variable <b>tubes,</b> <b>ports</b> and fins have been proposed. Such designs adopt adaptive tube and fin geometry within the heat exchanger core. Adaptive geometry refers to the changes in <b>tube</b> and <b>port</b> dimensions, changes in fin type and fin density in various sections of the heat exchanger core. The locations of individual tubes and fins can also vary, especially in multi-slab configurations. The goals of this new concept are heat transfer enhancement, material savings and fulfilling special design and application requirements. This paper presents studies on the design optimization of variable geometry MCHXs based on a validated simulation tool. The optimization study investigates an R 134 a condenser in an air-conditioning system. The objective of the study is to evaluate the potential cost and performance benefits of variable geometry microchannel heat exchangers compared to traditional fixed geometry microchannel heat exchangers used today. The optimization objectives are performance enhancement and cost reduction. Condenser designs generally consist of two sections, a main section and a sub-cooler section. The majority of the condensing capacity is contributed by the main section whereas the sub-cooler section is present to ensure that the outlet refrigerant is fully sub-cooled. Conventional sub-cooler section has excess tube and fins due to pressure drop constraint and manufacturing limitation. The new variable geometry design can significantly lower the material cost in the sub-cooler section while maintaining certain refrigerant pressure drop. Preliminary optimization study shows a 12 percent material reduction for a variable geometry condenser for the same performance compared to a baseline standard geometry condenser. The optimization study reveals the potential of the variable geometry MCHX and will motivate engineers to pursue such innovative designs...|$|R

More recently, the evolving simulation and manufacturing capabilities have given the engineers new opportunities in pursuing complex and cost-efficient novel heat exchanger designs. Advanced heat exchanger modeling tools are desired to explore geometries out of conventional boundaries of design. The current research and development of MCHXs has reached a plateau, in that, the optimum designs cannot be further improved with the limited number of geometry related design variables currently used. Freeing up the current MCHX uniform geometry restriction would lead to novel designs that address various design and applications objectives, such as performance enhancement, material reduction and space constraints. This thesis presents the research, development and comprehensive validation of advanced heat exchanger models for microchannel heat exchangers. These new models include unprecedented modeling capabilities, with extensive consideration of various underlying heat transfer and fluid flow phenomena. The proposed microchannel heat exchanger models are capable of simulating variable geometry microchannel heat exchangers with variable <b>tubes,</b> <b>ports</b> and fins while accounting for effects such as heat conduction, combined heat and mass transfer as well as air and refrigerant flow mal-distribution, thus distinguishing itself as the cutting edge modeling tool in the open literature. The models are validated against 247 MCHX experimental data points obtained from open literature, in-house laboratories and industry partners. This is the most comprehensive validation of microchannel heat exchanger models in open literature, including eight different fluids and eighteen different geometries. The validated model is then coupled with a multi-objective genetic algorithm to optimize the variable geometry heat exchangers to minimize material and envelope volume. The optimization study shows up to 35 percent reduction in material and 43 percent savings in envelope volume for the same performance compared to a baseline conventional geometry design. This research will be help engineers to develop creative microchannel heat exchangers ultimately resulting in improved systems efficiency at lower costs...|$|R
