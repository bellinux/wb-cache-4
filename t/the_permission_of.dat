5|$|Building {{a castle}} {{sometimes}} required <b>the</b> <b>permission</b> <b>of</b> the king or other high authority. In 864 the King of West Francia, Charles the Bald, prohibited {{the construction of}} castella without his permission and ordered them all to be destroyed. This is perhaps the earliest reference to castles, though military historian R. Allen Brown {{points out that the}} word castella may have applied to any fortification at the time.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> 9 <b>permission</b> bits {{are divided}} into three groups of three bits each. The first group {{describes}} <b>the</b> <b>permissions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> file owner, the second group describes <b>the</b> <b>permissions</b> <b>of</b> a group associated with the file owner or the directory containing the file, and the third group describes <b>the</b> <b>permissions</b> associated with any process which {{does not have the}} same user ID as the file. Each group of three bits contains a bit indicating the read, write or execute access is granted. In the case of directories, execute access is interpreted as <b>the</b> <b>permission</b> to perform a filename lookup within the directory.|$|R

5|$|In a 1987 sermon Lefebvre, at age 81, {{experiencing}} failing health, {{announced his}} intention to consecrate a bishop to carry on his work after his death.

5|$|Between 1769 and 1773, Bellman wrote 65 of 82 of his Epistles, {{as well as}} many poems. He {{attempted}} to publish the poems in 1772, but was unable to obtain <b>the</b> <b>permission</b> <b>of</b> the king, Gustav III, as a political coup intervened. He finally managed to obtain the permission in 1774, but soon discovered that the cost of printing, especially as he was determined to publish the sheet music alongside the text, was prohibitive given his ruinous finances, and he was forced to put off his plans. In 1776 the king gave him a sinecure job as secretary to the national lottery; this supported him {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E
5|$|Cortés {{arrived in}} Honduras in 1525, {{bringing}} livestock with him. Cortés claimed jurisdiction over Honduras, although its extent was still unknown. He rapidly imposed his {{authority over the}} rival Spanish factions there, {{as well as some}} native groups. He founded the settlement of Natividad de Nuestra Señora near Puerto de Caballos, settled fifty colonists there, and placed Diego de Godoy in charge. Cortés then sailed on to Trujillo. Conditions in Natividad were unhealthy, and half of the Spanish settlers rapidly succumbed to disease. With <b>the</b> <b>permission</b> <b>of</b> Cortés, the rest moved inland to the fertile Naco Valley, where Sandoval had securely established a Spanish presence.|$|E

Reich also took measurements from the patients of a psychiatric hospital near Oslo, including catatonic patients, with <b>the</b> <b>permission</b> <b>of</b> the hospital's director.
