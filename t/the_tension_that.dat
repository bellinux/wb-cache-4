5|$|Ornamentation {{assumes a}} preeminent role {{in much of}} Sorabji's music. His {{harmonic}} language, which frequently combines tonal and atonal elements, is thus freer than in the music of many other composers and less amenable to analysis. Like many other 20th-century composers, Sorabji displays a fondness for tritone and semitone relationships. The opening gesture of his Fourth Piano Sonata, for example, emphasises these two intervals, and the two long pedal points in its third movement are a tritone apart. However, some people have remarked that his music rarely contains <b>the</b> <b>tension</b> <b>that</b> is commonly associated with very dissonant music.|$|E

25|$|The PRC {{government}} {{claims that}} its rule over Tibet has provided economic development to Tibetan people, {{and that the}} Western Development Strategy plan is a benevolent and patriotic undertaking by the wealthier east coast to help the western parts of China catch up in terms of prosperity and living standards. On the other hand, the government maintains that the Tibetan Government did almost nothing to improve the Tibetans' material standard of life during its rule from 1913–59, and that they opposed any reforms proposed by the Chinese government. According to the Chinese government, {{this is the reason}} for <b>the</b> <b>tension</b> <b>that</b> grew between some central government officials and the local Tibetan government in 1959. The claims of economic hardship under the Dalai Lama's government from 191359 are disputed by the 10th Panchen Lama in the 70,000 Character Petition; however, the Panchen Lama praised the 1980s reform and opening up under Deng Xiaoping.|$|E
25|$|After the 1973 general {{election}} Fine Gael {{came to power}} in a coalition government with the Labour Party with Liam Cosgrave as Taoiseach. FitzGerald hoped that he would take over as Minister for Finance, particularly after a good performance in a pre-election debate with the then Minister for Finance George Colley. However the position went to Richie Ryan, with FitzGerald becoming Minister for Foreign Affairs. It was a case of history repeating itself as FitzGerald's father had held that post in a government led by Liam Cosgrave's father W. T. Cosgrave fifty years earlier. His appointment to Iveagh House (the headquarters of the Department of Foreign Affairs) would have a huge effect on FitzGerald's own career and the future of Fine Gael. Cosgrave was suspicious of FitzGerald's liberal ideas and believed that he had designs on the leadership. During his period at Foreign Affairs, Fitzgerald developed a good relationship with Liam Cosgrave and all <b>the</b> <b>tension</b> <b>that</b> had existed between them in opposition disappeared.|$|E

25|$|While {{consonant}} intervals (intervals of a {{third or}} sixth) and perfect intervals (intervals of a fourth, fifth, eighth) are greatly important, dissonant intervals can occur within music, which is why resolutions are vital. The most basic rule of resolution is to always resolve the leading tone upwards (the leading tones being the 7th scales degree of the key that the piece is in). When resolving the seventh scale degree to the tonic, it creates a sense of satisfaction and completion, relieving <b>the</b> <b>tension</b> <b>that</b> it created. Tritones also must be resolved correctly. These can occur in triads or seventh chords {{that are based on}} scale degree seven, and they must be resolved correctly. A tritone can either be an augmented fourth intervals or a diminished fifth based on the voicing that the composer uses. In common practice, an augmented fourth must resolve out, meaning the top voice resolves up and the bottom voice resolves down, creating a sixth Opposite of that a diminished fifth must resolve in, where the top voice resolves down and the bottom voice resolves up, creating an interval {{of a third}}.|$|E

500|$|Theater expert Marvin Rosenberg theorises that Macbeth has a son, and {{interprets the}} play as {{commenting on the}} rivalries between pairs of father and son: Banquo and Fleance, Macduff and his son, Macbeth and his. [...] He argues that <b>the</b> <b>tension</b> <b>that</b> exists between Fleance and Macbeth is made {{stronger}} if Macbeth has a child: his motive is not just selfish striving, but also fatherly ambition for his own son. But this interpretation is flawed because in IV:iii, as soon as Macduff hears that MacBeth [...] has murdered his whole family, he says: [...] "He has no children." [...] Some productions of Macbeth imply that the Macbeths have lost a child, or show this tenderness by having the title character attempt to pat Fleance on the head, when Fleance withdraws to his father's side.|$|E

This tactic allowed Corgan to work on vocals and song arrangements in one room while recording was done in the other. During these sessions, Flood and Corgan would work in one room as Moulder, guitarist James Iha, and bassist D'arcy Wretzky worked in a second. Iha and Wretzky had a much greater role in the recording of the album, unlike the prior albums where Corgan was rumored to have recorded all the bass and guitar parts himself.
