5|$|Boddingtons Brewery was a {{regional}} brewery in Manchester, England, which owned pubs throughout the North West. Boddingtons {{was best known}} for Boddingtons Bitter (Boddies), a straw-golden, hoppy bitter {{which was one of}} the first beers to be packaged in cans containing a widget, giving it a creamy draught-style head. In the 1990s, the beer was promoted as <b>The</b> <b>Cream</b> <b>of</b> Manchester in a popular advertising campaign credited with raising Manchester's profile. Boddingtons became one of the city's most famous products after Manchester United and Coronation Street.|$|E

Cravens killed herself in 1912, after the pianist Walter Rummel, long the object of her affection, married someone else. She may also have been discouraged by Pound's engagement to Dorothy.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe slurry of mPCM {{has been}} widely used for {{enhancing}} heat transfer and reducing building energy consumption. Because of intrinsic density differences between mPCM and water, the slurry is subject to creaming phenomena. As a consequence the viscosity of slurry increases and the thermal properties decrease. Up to now no quantitative analysis about <b>the</b> <b>creaming</b> <b>of</b> mPCM has been done. In the paper experimental measurement and numerical modeling <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>creaming</b> <b>of</b> mPCM slurry is presented.

40|$|AbstractThe main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate how polymer used as auxiliary emulsifier improves the stability of oil-in-water emulsions. Two kinds of polymeric emulsifier were used: poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) and carboxymethylcellulose sodium salt (Na-CMC) with various average molecular mass weight. Therefore, the influence of PEO and Na-CMC on <b>the</b> <b>creaming</b> <b>of</b> oil-in-water emulsions has been investigated. Moreover, studies of extensional viscosity of emulsions and pure polymer solutions were made on the opposed-nozzle rheometer. In the case of emulsions stabilized with PEO <b>the</b> <b>creaming</b> <b>of</b> emulsion progressed slower in the case of polymer having an average molecular weight Mw = 2 á 106, and faster for addition of PEO with the molecular mass Mw= 8 106. However, for emulsions stabilized with Na-CMC <b>the</b> fastest <b>creaming</b> has been observed for polymer with a lowest molecular weight (Mw= 2. 5 105). The study reveals that there is no direct connection between the extensional viscosity of the continuous phase of emulsions and rate <b>of</b> <b>creaming.</b> This is mainly due to the fact that preparation of emulsion stabilized by addition of PEO with different average molecular weights and similar shear viscosity of the continuous phase was unfortunate...|$|R

Following the death of Rabbi Kamai in 1917, Rav Eliezer Yehuda was appointed as rosh yeshiva, ushering in {{the golden age of}} the yeshiva. In 1921, The yeshiva moved back to its original facilities in Mir, where it blossomed, attracting <b>the</b> <b>cream</b> <b>of</b> the yeshiva students. The yeshiva's reputation grew, attracting students not only from throughout Europe, but also from America, South Africa and Australia, and the student body grew to close to 500.

During this period Rabbi Yeruchom Levovitz joined the yeshiva as mashgiach in succession to Rabbi Zalman Dolinski.|$|E
40|$|International audienceAbstractRecombined low-fat dairy cream (RLFDC) {{primarily}} comprises anhydrous {{milk fat}} and milk protein. The primary advantage of RLFDC is that its ingredients can be easily stored and transported, whereas its most notable disadvantage is poor stability. The effects of glycerol monostearate (GMS) or sorbitan monooleate ethoxylate (Tween 80) on the physical properties and stability of RLFDC (20 % fat and 2 % protein) were investigated in this study. Physical properties were evaluated according to droplet size, surface protein concentration, ζ-potential, and apparent viscosity; stability was assessed according to creaming rate. Results showed that GMS and Tween 80 could significantly increase <b>the</b> <b>creaming</b> stability <b>of</b> RLFDC compared with a control sample. <b>The</b> <b>creaming</b> stability <b>of</b> RLFDC with GMS highly depended on ζ-potential and apparent viscosity, which contributed to electrostatic repulsion and intermolecular resistance.

To keep prices down, A put emphasis on private label goods. By 1962, A operated 67 plants before consolidating many of them into the 1.5 million-square foot Horseheads facility, which was the largest food manufacturing plant in the world under one roof. As late as 1977, private label represented 25% of A's sales, with A manufactured products accounting for over 40% of this total. That year, A manufacturing reported sales of $750 million from its 23 plants(which by itself would have ranked A's manufacturing group at about number 350 in the Fortune 500).|$|E

25|$|Unable {{to confront}} the British directly, Greene {{dispatched}} a force under Daniel Morgan to recruit additional troops. Morgan then defeated <b>the</b> <b>cream</b> <b>of</b> the British army under Tarleton on January 17, 1781, at Cowpens. As after {{the defeat of the}} Loyalists at King's Mountain, Cornwallis was criticized for his decision to detach a substantial part of his army without adequate support. Despite the setbacks, Cornwallis proceeded to advance into North Carolina, gambling that he would receive substantial Loyalist support. Greene evaded combat with Cornwallis, instead wearing his army down through a protracted war of attrition. By March, Greene's army had grown enough where he felt confident in facing Cornwallis. The two armies engaged at Guilford Courthouse on March 15, and, though Greene was beaten, Cornwallis' army had suffered irreplaceable casualties. Compounding this, far fewer Loyalists were joining as expected due to effective Patriot suppression. Cornwallis' casualties were such that he was compelled to retreat to Wilmington for reinforcement, leaving the interior of the Carolinas, and Georgia, wide open to Greene.|$|E
25|$|In 1780, {{the primary}} British {{strategy}} hinged upon a Loyalist uprising in the south, for which Charles Cornwallis was chiefly responsible. After an encouraging success at Camden, Cornwallis {{was poised to}} invade North Carolina. However, any significant Loyalist support had been effectively destroyed at the Battle of Kings Mountain, and the British Legion, <b>the</b> <b>cream</b> <b>of</b> his army, had been decisively defeated at the Battle of Cowpens. Following both defeats, Cornwallis was fiercely criticized for detaching {{a significant portion of}} his army without adequate mutual support. Despite the defeats, Cornwallis chose to proceed into North Carolina, gambling his success upon a large Loyalist uprising which never materialized. As a result, subsequent engagements cost Cornwallis valuable troops he could not replace, as at the Battle of Guilford Courthouse, and the Americans steadily wore his army down in an exhaustive war of attrition. Cornwallis had thus left the Carolinas ripe for reconquest. The Americans had largely achieved this aim by the end of 1781, effectively confining the British to the coast, and undoing all the progress they had made in the previous year.|$|E
