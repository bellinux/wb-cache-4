50|$|In {{the case}} of a petrol (gasoline) or Diesel engine, the stall torque may refer to the <b>torque</b> <b>load</b> that causes the engine to stall. The actual amount of torque is {{dependent}} on engine RPM and throttle opening.|$|E
50|$|Aircraft {{propellers}} {{are another}} application. The governor senses shaft RPM, and adjusts or controls {{the angle of}} the blades to vary the <b>torque</b> <b>load</b> on the engine. Thus as the aircraft speeds up (as in a dive) or slows (in climb) the RPM is held constant.|$|E

50|$|Engine {{parts were}} {{recovered}} {{and taken to}} the engine overhauler’s workshops for supervised examination and dismantling. The bearings and other internal engine parts {{were found to be}} in order with no signs of overheating or seizure. The engine crankshaft had broken between the big end bearing of the 6th cylinder and the main bearing in the engine casing at the flywheel end.

50|$|The load {{has to be}} of {{increasing}} torque in nature: Voltage controllers can alter {{the speed of a}} motor by altering the incoming voltage, but the motor must have an increasing <b>torque</b> <b>load</b> (e.g. Industrial fans, winding machines). Voltage controllers are not suitable for a constant torque application. An example of an increasing torque application would be a wire winding machine: the initial load is almost zero as there is no wire wound at the beginning, with time the wire wound increases, thus increasing the torque (the force needed to turn the winding) proportionally. A voltage controller would be suitable here for increasing or decreasing the speed of the winding machine.|$|E

30|$|In this paper, a 3 D {{adhesive}} joint model was constructed using FEM, and the singular stress field {{around the end}} of the interface between the adhesive and the adherend was analyzed for cases of external pressure, internal pressure, tension, bending and torque loadings. Singular stress fields exist for all the loading cases, and the stress singularity is larger for cases of external pressure, internal pressure and tension loading compared to the cases of bending and <b>torque</b> <b>loading,</b> which means that the riser pipe under external pressure, internal pressure and tension loading is more prone to break than under bending and <b>torque</b> <b>loading</b> in deep sea environment.|$|R

50|$|On 5 January 1956, {{the second}} YH-16 test {{aircraft}} crashed while returning to Philadelphia from a test flight over New Jersey. The {{cause of the}} crash was later determined to be the aft slip ring, which carried flight data from the instrumented rotor blades to the data recorders in the cabin. The slip ring bearings seized, and the resultant <b>torque</b> <b>load</b> severed the instrumentation standpipe inside the aft rotor shaft. A segment of this steel standpipe tilted over and {{came into contact with}} the interior of the aluminum rotor shaft, scribing a deepening groove into it. The rotor shaft eventually failed in flight, which in turn led to the aft blades and forward blades desynchronizing and colliding.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "3" [...] in {{the number}} refers to the {{specific}} series of transmission. The M-3x, 4x, 5x and 6x transmissions are all aluminum cased transmissions {{that are related to}} the M-35 (the first of the aluminum Borg-Warner automatics). In this case the rising series number is relative to transmission strength—a larger number will withstand more power than a smaller number. This isn't, however, a general rule with Borg-Warner automatics. The earlier M-8 and M-1x cast iron case transmissions are much stronger than the aluminum models, although the M-6x may handle as much power as the M-1x series. The second number refers to a specific variation. This usually indicates a higher <b>torque</b> <b>load</b> capability, but may refer to other variations that may not increase torque rating.|$|E

50|$|An oil shear brake has {{a series}} of {{friction}} discs and steel plates similar to the clutches in an automobile automatic transmission. The shaft carrying the friction discs {{is attached to the}} load through a coupling. A piston pushes the stack of friction discs and steel plates together creating shear in the oil between the discs and plates applying a torque. Torque control can be pneumatic or hydraulic. Force lubrication maintains a film of oil between the surfaces to eliminate wear. Reaction is smooth to zero RPM without stick-slip. Loads up to hundreds of thermal horsepower can be absorbed through the required force lubrication and cooling unit. Most often, the brake is kinetically grounded through a torque arm anchored by a strain gauge which produces a current under load fed to the dynamometer control. Proportional or servo control valves are generally used to allow the dynamometer control to apply pressure to provide the program <b>torque</b> <b>load</b> with feedback from the strain gauge closing the loop. As torque requirements go up there are speed limitations.|$|E

40|$|A novel {{methodology}} for investigating {{the performance of}} the eye-head coordination system in humans is proposed. The objective is to alter the head's mechanics by applying <b>torque</b> <b>loads</b> during gaze shifts. A servo-motor, connected to the subject's head through a "motor shaft-to-dental bite" arrangement, is applying brief torque pulses in order to both aid and resist the head's movement, thus increasing and reducing respectively the head's velocity. The subjects perform a simple visual task to guide their gaze shifts in the dark, that is, after fixating on a standard point in space, a briefly flashed target will indicate the amplitude of the required gaze movement. Three targets appear in the horizontal plane within, at the limits of, and beyond the human oculomotor range (40 °, 55 °, and 70 ° respectively) in order to cover a significant range within which the head's contribution to the gaze coordinated movement is indispensable. The main question, the proposed methodology aims to answer, regards the effect of the <b>torque</b> <b>loads</b> on gaze shift accuracy. Two (2) subjects were tested under the above-mentioned conditions. Their accuracy was not significantly affected, although both head velocity and gaze duration were considerably altered by the <b>torque</b> <b>loads.</b> The results support the existence of a feedback control mechanism in the eye-head coordination system that keeps track of the on-going movement and adjusts the movement's kinematics on-line accordingly...|$|R

40|$|AbstractOver {{the past}} 3 decades, Nickel-Titanium (NiTi) {{instruments}} {{have become an}} important part of the armamentarium for shaping phase of root canal treatment. NiTi endodontic files have increased flexibility and strength compared with stainless steel instruments, but they seem to be vulnerable to fracture in clinical situations. Many variables might contribute to file separation, but the 2 main causes are cyclic fatigue and torsional stress. Heat treatment (thermal processing) is one of the most fundamental approaches toward adjusting the transition temperatures of NiTi alloys and affecting the fatigue and torsional resistance of NiTi endodontic files. In recent years, novel thermo-mechanical processing and manufacturing technologies such as controlled memory wire (CM-wire), M-Wire and electrical discharge machining (EDM) have been developed to optimize the microstructure of NiTi alloys and their mechanical properties. Aim of this work was to investigate the torsional resistance (maximum <b>torque</b> <b>load,</b> and angular rotation) of NiTi instruments made by different thermo-mechanical and manufacturing processes. One-hundred new Hyflex EDM One- File (# 25 / 0. 08, CM-wire and EDM process), WaveOne Primary (# 25 / 0. 08, M-wire), ProTaper Next X 2 (# 25 / 0. 06, M-wire), Hyflex CM (# 25 / 0. 06, CM-wire) and F 6 SkyTaper(# 25 / 0. 06, conventional NiTi) files were used. Torque and angle of rotation at failure of new instruments (n = 20) were measured using a torsiometer according to ISO 3630 - 1 for each brand. Data were analyzed using the analysis of variance test and the Student- Newman-Keuls test for multiple comparisons. The fracture surface of each fragment was examined with a scanning electron microscope. Files made by CM wire size # 25, 0. 06 taper (Hyflex CM) showed same <b>torque</b> <b>load</b> and angular rotation to fracture than conventional NiTi (F 6 SkyTaper) (P >. 05); instead CM files (manufacturing by grinding or EDM process) recorded lower maximum <b>torque</b> <b>load</b> (P. 05) but significantly higher angular rotation (P <. 05) to fracture than M-wire instruments size # 25, 0. 06 taper (ProTaper Next). Hyflex EDM One-File and Hyflex CM have same <b>torque</b> <b>load</b> and angular rotation to fracture than F 6 SkyTaper due to the higher flexibility and cross-sectional area of CM files tested than conventional NiTi one. Moreover CM files showed lower <b>torque</b> <b>load</b> and higher angular rotation to fracture than M-wire instruments due to the flexibility of CM alloy.
