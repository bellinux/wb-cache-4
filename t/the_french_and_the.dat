5|$|Although <b>the</b> <b>French</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Austrians claimed {{victory at}} the time, {{military}} historians generally agree that the Austrians achieved a strategic advantage. However, the French withdrew from the battlefield in good order and several days later crossed the Rhine River at Hüningen. A confusion of politics and diplomacy in Vienna wasted any strategic advantage that Charles might have obtained and locked the Habsburg force into two sieges on the Rhine, when the troops were badly needed in northern Italy. The battle is commemorated on a monument in Vienna and on the Arc de Triomphe in Paris.|$|E
5|$|An {{agreement}} {{called the}} Matignon Accord followed on 6 November 1988 between <b>the</b> <b>French</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Kanaks, {{which had the}} majority support of 80% of the French people. According to the Matignon Accord (or Matignon Agreement) a referendum on independence was proposed to be held by 1998. However, two of the Kanak leaders who had signed the agreement, Jean-Marie Tjibaou and Yeiwene Yeiwene, were assassinated on 4 May 1989 by a Kanak activist. The Kanak independence activists were unhappy with the situation as they felt that France would never allow them independence.|$|E

5|$|Competition between <b>the</b> <b>French</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Portuguese {{began to}} show itself in the region during this period. Because the Portuguese-operated trading posts in Cacheu and Farim asked for higher prices than the French-operated trading posts in Carabane and Sédhiou, the Portuguese lost many traders to the French. This trend led to the ceding of Ziguinchor to France, which was {{negotiated}} in Carabane in April 1888 between Commissioner Oliveira and Captain Brosselard-Faidherbe.|$|E

5|$|François-René de Chateaubriand {{depicted}} the massacre in his 1827 epic Les Natchez, incorporating his earlier best-selling novellas Atala and René into a longer narrative that greatly embellished {{the history of}} <b>the</b> <b>French</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Natchez in Louisiana. In Chateaubriand's work, the grand conspiracy behind the massacre implausibly included native tribes from all across North America. Chateaubriand saw the Natchez Massacre as the defining {{moment in the history}} of the Louisiana colony, a position consistent with the views of other 18th-century historians, such as Le Page du Pratz and Dumont de Montigny.|$|E

5|$|However, in a {{long term}} war of attrition, the battle was just one more source of losses to the French when they were losing two men to one. Both <b>the</b> <b>French</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Russians {{suffered}} terribly but the Russians had reserve troops, and a clear advantage in the logistics war. The French Army supplies came over a long road lined with hostile forces. According to Rhien, so long as the Russian Army existed the French continued to lose.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the French tradition, the Natchez and their conflicts with the French have been mostly forgotten in contemporary American historiography.

5|$|The third voyage sailed in January 1774 and her {{purpose was}} to {{evacuate}} the Falklands entirely as Britain was faced with political difficulties from the American Colonies, <b>the</b> <b>French</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Spanish. The government thought that if British ships and troops were engaged in America, Spain might seize the Falklands, capturing the small garrison at Port Egmont and maybe killing some of them - this, it was feared, would trigger an outcry which might topple the government. Endeavour left England in January 1774, and sailed from the Falklands with all the British inhabitants on 23 April, leaving a flag and a plaque.|$|E

5|$|Though {{the various}} parts {{of what is now}} Minnesota were claimed at {{different}} times by Spain, France, and Britain, none of these nations made significant efforts to establish major settlements in the area.

5|$|Additional Native resentment {{resulted}} from Amherst's decision in February 1761 {{to cut back}} on the gifts given to the Native Americans. Gift giving had been {{an integral part of the}} relationship between <b>the</b> <b>French</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> tribes of the pays d'en haut. Following a Native American custom that carried important symbolic meaning, the French gave presents (such as guns, knives, tobacco, and clothing) to village chiefs, who in turn redistributed these gifts to their people. By this process, the village chiefs gained stature among their people, and were thus able to maintain the alliance with the French. Amherst, however, considered this process to be a form of bribery that was no longer necessary, especially since he was under pressure to cut expenses after the war with France. Many Native Americans regarded this change in policy as an insult and an indication that the British looked upon them as conquered people rather than as allies.|$|E
5|$|Although {{he focuses}} on the French Revolution, the story ends in the 1880s, shortly after the Second French Empire, closely {{following}} the evolution of society and women (see also Historiography of the French Revolution). Later, he republished what was essentially is the same book but with a different title, in both French and English: La Femme et la mode. Métamorphoses de la parisienne de 1792 à 1892 or Woman and Fashion: Metamorphoses of the Parisienne 1792–1892 in the English version (1892), and Les Modes de Paris. Variations du goût et de l'esthétique de la femme, 1797–1897 (1897).

5|$|At {{the start}} of the siege, Gibraltar was garrisoned by around 2,000 Dutch, English, Austrian and pro-Habsburg Spanish troops facing a besieging force of up to 8,000 French, pro-Bourbon Spanish and Irish troops. The {{defenders}} were able to hold off the numerically superior besieging force through exploiting Gibraltar's geography and the small town's fortifications, though they were frequently short of manpower and ammunition. The besiegers were undermined by disputes between the French and Spanish officers and terrible conditions in their trenches and bastions, which led to outbreaks of epidemic disease and undermined morale. Sea power proved crucial, as the French navy sought unsuccessfully to prevent the Grand Alliance shipping in fresh troops, ammunition and food. Three naval battles were fought during the siege, two of which were clear defeats for <b>the</b> <b>French</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> last of which resulted in the siege being abandoned as hopeless after nine months of fruitless shelling. The outcome was disastrous for the French and Bourbon Spanish side, which was said to have lost 10,000 men against only 400 for the Grand Alliance.|$|E
5|$|Because of this {{beginning}} of the incursion of Europeans into the area, {{the members of the}} Confederacy helped shape the development of North America throughout the 18th century, becoming a centre of trade and culture. Great Britain supported this strengthening of the tribes in the area as a set of allies against <b>the</b> <b>French</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Iroqouis. The people of the Three Fires Confederacy, however, sided with the French during the Seven Years' War and only made peace with Great Britain after the Treaty of Fort Niagara in 1764. It also fought {{on the side of the}} British during the War of 1812. The Three Fires Confederacy also broke several treaties with the United States prior to 1815, but finally signed the Treaty of Springwells in September of that year and ceased all hostilities directed at the United States. The Grand Council survived intact until the middle to late 19th century, when more modern political systems began to evolve.|$|E
5|$|During the Duke's {{march to}} the Danube Emperor LeopoldI offered to make Marlborough a prince of the Holy Roman Empire in the small principality of Mindelheim. The Queen enthusiastically agreed to this elevation, but after the successes of 1704, the {{campaign}} of 1705 brought little reason for satisfaction on the Continent. The planned invasion of France via the Moselle valley was frustrated by friend and foe alike, forcing the Duke to withdraw back towards the Low Countries. Although Marlborough penetrated the Lines of Brabant at Elixheim in July, Allied indecision and considerable Dutch hesitancy (concerned as they were {{for the security of}} their homeland), prevented the Duke from pressing his advantage. <b>The</b> <b>French</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Tories in England dismissed arguments that only Dutch obstructionism had robbed Marlborough of a great victory in 1705, confirmed in their belief that Blenheim had been a lucky strike and that Marlborough was a general not to be feared.|$|E

5|$|Having ascertained the {{identity}} of the ships Dance signalled for his merchants to form the line of battle, and continued their heading, while the French closed, but made no move to attack. Dance used the delay to gather his ships together so the stronger East Indiamen stood between <b>the</b> <b>French</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> weaker country ships. The merchants continued on towards the straits, followed by Linois, who was trying to gauge the strength of the convoy. There were more ships in the convoy than he had expected, and taken in by Dance's manoeuvres and the painted gunports, Linois suspected that several warships were escorting them. He seemed to be confirmed in his suspicions when at dawn on 15 February, both forces raised their colours. Dance ordered the brig Ganges and the four lead ships to hoist Blue Ensigns, {{while the rest of the}} convoy raised Red Ensigns. By the system of national flags then in use in British ships, this implied that the ships with blue ensigns were warships attached to the squadron of Admiral Peter Rainier, while the others were merchant ships under their protection.|$|E
5|$|In 1513, King James IV led an {{invasion}} of northern England in support of <b>the</b> <b>French</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Auld Alliance. On 9 September, the Scots met the English at the Battle of Flodden, and were heavily defeated, with King James killed on the field. An English invasion was widely expected, and in Edinburgh it was resolved {{to build a new}} town wall. However, the new wall was also an opportunity to control smuggling into the burgh, and the town council accordingly decided to extend the wall south to take in the Grassmarket and Cowgate areas of the burgh. Construction began the following year, but was not completed until 1560. Work started at the western end, and the final section was the stretch from Leith Wynd to the Nor Loch, incorporating the New Port. The cost of this last work was £4/10s Scots per rood (one rood = six ells or 5.6metres) for the wall, plus 40s per rood for the battlements.|$|E
5|$|In 1933, the devoutly Catholic Diệm was {{appointed}} Interior Minister of Vietnam, serving under Emperor Bảo Đại. However, {{a few months}} thereafter he resigned and became a private citizen because the French colonialists would not give Vietnam any meaningful autonomy. During World War II, Imperial Japan attacked Indochina and wrested control from France, but when they were defeated by the Allies in 1945, a power vacuum was created. The communist-dominated Viet Minh of Ho Chi Minh fought for Vietnamese independence, while the French attempted {{to regain control of}} their colony by creating the French Union-allied State of Vietnam under Bảo Đại. A staunch anti-communist nationalist, Diệm opposed both and attempted to create his own movement, with little success. With both <b>the</b> <b>French</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> communists hostile to him, Diệm felt unsafe and went into self-imposed exile in 1950. He spent the next four years in the United States and Europe enlisting support, particularly among Vatican officials and fellow Catholic politicians in America. The success of the effort was helped by the fact that his elder brother Ngô Đình Thục was the leading Catholic cleric in Vietnam and had studied with high-ranking Vatican officials in Rome a few decades earlier.|$|E
