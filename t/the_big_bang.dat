5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Big</b> <b>Bang</b> as {{the origin}} of the {{universe}}: One of the common misconceptions about <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> <b>Bang</b> model is the belief that it was {{the origin of}} the universe. However, <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> <b>Bang</b> model does not comment about how the universe came into being. Current conception of <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> <b>Bang</b> model assumes the existence of energy, time, and space, and does not comment about their origin or the cause of the dense and high temperature initial state of the universe.|$|E
5|$|As a {{description}} of the origin of the universe, <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> <b>Bang</b> has significant bearing on religion and philosophy. As a result, it {{has become one of the}} liveliest areas in the discourse between science and religion. Some believe <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> <b>Bang</b> implies a creator, and some see its mention in their holy books, while others argue that Big Bang cosmology makes the notion of a creator superfluous.|$|E
5|$|As {{with any}} theory, {{a number of}} mysteries and {{problems}} have arisen {{as a result of}} the development of <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> <b>Bang</b> theory. Some of these mysteries and problems have been resolved while others are still outstanding. Proposed solutions to some of the problems in <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> <b>Bang</b> model have revealed new mysteries of their own. For example, the horizon problem, the magnetic monopole problem, and the flatness problem are most commonly resolved with inflationary theory, but the details of the inflationary universe are still left unresolved and many, including some founders of the theory, say it has been disproven. What follows are a list of the mysterious aspects of <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> <b>Bang</b> theory still under intense investigation by cosmologists and astrophysicists.|$|E

5|$|Brane {{cosmology}} models, {{in which}} inflation {{is due to}} the movement of branes in string theory; the pre-Big Bang model; the ekpyrotic model, in which <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> <b>Bang</b> {{is the result of a}} collision between branes; and the cyclic model, a variant of the ekpyrotic model in which collisions occur periodically. In the latter model <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> <b>Bang</b> was preceded by a Big Crunch and the universe cycles from one process to the other.|$|E
5|$|Detailed {{observations}} of the morphology and distribution of galaxies and quasars are {{in agreement with the}} current state of <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> <b>Bang</b> theory. A combination of observations and theory suggest that the first quasars and galaxies formed about a billion years after <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> <b>Bang,</b> and since then, larger structures have been forming, such as galaxy clusters and superclusters.|$|E

5|$|The {{prevailing}} {{model for}} the evolution of the Universe is <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> <b>Bang</b> theory. <b>The</b> <b>Big</b> <b>Bang</b> model states that the earliest state of the Universe was extremely hot and dense and that it subsequently expanded. The model is based on general relativity and on simplifying assumptions such as homogeneity and isotropy of space. A version of the model with a cosmological constant (Lambda) and cold dark matter, known as the Lambda-CDM model, is the simplest model that provides a reasonably good account of various observations about the Universe. <b>The</b> <b>Big</b> <b>Bang</b> model accounts for observations such as the correlation of distance and redshift of galaxies, the ratio of the number of hydrogen to helium atoms, and the microwave radiation background.|$|E

It was the most-watched episode, behind <b>The</b> <b>Big</b> <b>Bang</b> Theory (which had 2.8 million). Averaging 2.17 million viewers, Quantico was Canada's most-watched drama series, most-watched new series and second-most-watched series (after <b>The</b> <b>Big</b> <b>Bang</b> Theory) in 2015.

In France, the series premiered to 4.9 million viewers (a 21-percent audience share) and averaged 3.1 million viewers during its first season.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Big</b> <b>Bang</b> {{is not an}} {{explosion}} of matter moving outward to fill an empty universe. Instead, space itself expands with time everywhere and increases the physical distance between two comoving points. In other words, <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> <b>Bang</b> is not {{an explosion}} in space, but rather an expansion of space. Because the FLRW metric assumes a uniform distribution of mass and energy, it applies to our universe only on large scales—local concentrations of matter such as our galaxy are gravitationally bound and as such do not experience the large-scale expansion of space.|$|E
