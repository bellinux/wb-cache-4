50|$|The {{series of}} reports suggest that there were groups of people with {{advanced}} sailing technology in Amami and that Dazaifu had a stronghold in Kikai Island. In fact, historians hypothesize that the Amami Islands were incorporated into a trade network that connected it to Kyūshū, Song China and Goryeo. In fact, the Shōyūki recorded that in the 1020s, local governors of southern Kyūshū presented to the author, a court aristocrat, local specialties of the southern islands including the Chinese fan palm, red woods, and shells of Green <b>Turban</b> <b>Shell.</b> The Shinsarugakuki, a fictional work written in the mid-11th century, introduced a merchant named Hachirō-mauto, who traveled {{all the way to}} the land of the Fushū in the east and to Kika Island (Kikanoshima) in the west. The goods he obtained from the southern islands included shells of Green <b>Turban</b> <b>Shell</b> and sulfur. The Shinsarugakuki was not mere fiction; the Golden Hall of Chūson-ji (c. 1124) in northeastern Japan was decorated with tens of thousands of green turban shells.|$|E
5000|$|Turbo cornutus can {{be found}} in {{relatively}} shallow coastal waters (up to 30 meters deep). It {{can be found}} around the Japanese islands from Honshu to Kyushu and Okinawa. It feeds on various kinds of algae. Young horned <b>turban</b> <b>shells</b> eat red-turf algae, while adults eat larger seaweed.|$|R
50|$|Turbo cornutus spawns from August to September, {{although}} the gonads begin to mature from May. Larvae {{have a very}} short period as free-floating plankton at approximately five days, after which they settle and begin to develop a shell. The planktonic and early shell-growing stages are highly dangerous times for young horned <b>turban</b> <b>shells,</b> and they are eaten in large numbers.|$|R
50|$|In {{most other}} gastropods, the right gill has been lost.

40|$|Abstract−This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to isolate microorganisms from the gut of the marine <b>turban</b> <b>shell,</b> Batillus cornutus, which inhabits the mainland of South Korea and primarily feeds on brown algae. We were interested in isolating such gut bacteria by considering their potential to produce the polysaccharidases required for digestion of brown seaweeds and isolated three different bacteria from the gut of Batillus cornutus. The isolated bacteria were identified as Bacillus sp. JMP-A, Bacillus sp. JMP-B and Staphylococcus sp. JMP-C. The organisms were evaluated for their ability to produce polysaccharidases such as cellulase, alginate lyase, laminarinase and kelp-lyase. Bacillus sp. JMP-A and Bacillus sp. JMP-B showed a clear zone of CMC hydrolysis with a radius 1. 10 (± 0. 057) and 3. 88 cm (± 0. 088), respectively, whereas Staphylococcus sp. JMP-C showed no zone of CMC hydrolysis. SEM analysis confirmed that the ability of the bacterial isolates to degrade kelp differs and is correlated with kelp-lyase production. The cell free extract of the Bacillus sp. JMP-A isolate showed the highest activities of CM-cellulase, α-cellulase, laminarinase and kelp-lyase, which were 22. 76, 27. 10, 66. 59 and 64. 36 U/mg, respectively. Meanwhile, the amount of sugars released was higher during the saccharification of kelp by dialyzed intracellular enzymes of the bacterial isolates than when dialyzed extracellular enzyme was used. Experimental results of dialyzed enzymatic saccharification of the kelp demonstrated that use of partially purified enzymes was effective for glucose production...|$|E

50|$|Unipectinate gills {{are found}} {{in a wide range}} of snails, {{including}} marine, freshwater, and even terrestrial forms. Examples include periwinkles, conches, and whelks. The water current is oblique, as it is in the <b>turban</b> <b>shells,</b> but many have developed a siphon formed from the rolled-up margin of the mantle. The siphon sucks in water to the mantle cavity, and may be long enough to extend through the substrate in burrowing species. In one amphibious group, the Ampullariidae, the mantle cavity is divided into two, with a unipectinate gill on one side, and a lung on the other, so that these snails can respire using air or water.|$|R

40|$|Pearls {{are formed}} {{in a number}} of species of {{molluscs}} viz., the pearl oysters, 	 window-pane oysters, edible oysters, fresh-water mussels, abalones, chanks, 	 topshells, <b>turban</b> <b>shells</b> etc. Pearls formed in some of the pearl oyster species are 	 valued very highly as gems because of their excellent shape, quality and lustre. 	 Pearl oysters enjoy a world-wide distribution occuring in almost all the seas of 	 the tropical belt. Six species of pearl oysters are known from the Indian coasts 	 viz. Pinctada fucata (Gould), P. margaritifera (Linnaeus), P. chemnitzii (Philippi), 	 P. sugillata Ree), P. anomioides (Reeve) and P. atropurpurea (Dunker). Of 	 those, P. fucata which occurs in extensive beds in the Gulf of Mannar and to a 	 much less extent in the Gulf of Kutch is commercially very important being the 	 source of the 'Oriental pearls' or 'Lingah' pearls of great renown. P. fucata 	 occurring in the Persian Gulf and off the coasts of Ceylon also supports excellent 	 fisheries for natural pearls. The Indian pearl fisheries have been famous since 	 ancient times for the most beautiful pearls they yield. The other five species of 	 pearl oysters on the Indian coasts arc not of any importance as their pearl yield 	 is low or the pearls produced by them are not of high quality...|$|R
40|$|LSA; 50, 000 {{years ago}} to {{historic}} times) archaeological sites {{along the coast of}} South Africa frequently preserve the remains of marine shellfish, primarily limpets, mussels, and <b>turban</b> <b>shells.</b> These sites are found in two distinct biogeographic regions, the west, Atlantic Ocean coast and the south, Indian Ocean coast, with different marine environments influencing the shellfish species available for human exploitation. We are currently excavating Ysterfontein 1, a Middle Stone Age shell midden on the west coast. Analyses of the mollusks from Ysterfontein 1 and other MSA and LSA assemblages illuminate ancient subsistence practices, environmen-tal changes, and human population densities, and we particularly aim to address issues sur-rounding the emergence of fully modern humans. The abundance of shells in many sites demon-strates that mollusks were an important source of food for both MSA and LSA people. Throughout the MSA and LSA, the proportions of different shellfish species change through time, suggesting that changing sea levels or ocean conditions may have influenced the available species. However, in many respects MSA and LSA assemblages are different from each other. The MSA samples have a lower diversity of shellfish species than LSA samples; they are poor in granular limpets; and they lack fish and rock lobster, which are common in many coastal LS...|$|R
60|$|Mr. Wentworth, {{with his}} cane and his gloves in his hand, went every {{afternoon}} {{to call upon}} his niece. A {{couple of hours later}} she came over to the great house to tea. She had let the proposal that she should regularly dine there fall to the ground; she was in the enjoyment of whatever satisfaction was to be derived from the spectacle of an old negress in a crimson <b>turban</b> <b>shelling</b> peas under the apple-trees. Charlotte, who had provided the ancient negress, thought it must be a strange household, Eugenia having told her that Augustine managed everything, the ancient negress included--Augustine who was naturally devoid of all acquaintance with the expurgatory English tongue. By far the most immoral sentiment which I shall have occasion to attribute to Charlotte Wentworth was a certain emotion of disappointment at finding that, in spite of these irregular conditions, the domestic arrangements at the small house were apparently not--from Eugenia's peculiar point of view--strikingly offensive. The Baroness found it amusing to go to tea; she dressed as if for dinner. The tea-table offered an anomalous and picturesque repast; and on leaving it they all sat and talked in the large piazza, or wandered about the garden in the starlight, with their ears full of those sounds of strange insects which, though they are supposed to be, all over the world, a part of the magic of summer nights, seemed to the Baroness to have beneath these western skies an incomparable resonance.|$|R
40|$|Surveys of fish, {{invertebrates}} and algae {{were conducted}} on subtidal rocky reefs within the Batemans Marine Park (BMP) in December 2005 (11 sites), 2006 (25 sites) and 2007 (22 sites). At {{the time of the}} 2005 and 2006 surveys, the BMP had been created but legislation to implement the zoning scheme and hence enforce fishing restrictions was not in place. Data obtained in 2005 and 2006 thus represent baseline conditions. The zoning came into effect in June, 2007. The BMP surveys form part of a broader study into the effectiveness of marine protected areas (MPAs) in Australian temperate waters. Surveys were undertaken with identical methodology to studies in the nearby Jervis Bay Marine Park (Barrett et al., 2006) as well as in Western Australia, South Australia, Tasmania and Victoria. Surveys assessed the diversity and abundance of fish and macro-invertebrates and percentage cover estimates of algae and sessile invertebrates. One hundred and nine species of fish, fifty five species of macro-invertebrates and seventy three species of algae were counted throughout the surveys. Schooling fish species such as Chromis hypsilepis (One-spot puller), Atypichthys strigatus (Mado sweep) and Trachinops taeniatus (Eastern hulafish) were the most abundant at most sites. The most abundant resident reef fish were Parma microlepis (white-ear), Crinodus lophodon (Rock cale) and Notolabrus gymnogenis (Crimson-banded wrasse). The most abundant invertebrates were Centrostephanus rodgersii (Long spine urchin), Astralium spp. (<b>Turban</b> <b>shells),</b> Heliocidaris spp. (common urchins) and Turbo spp. (Turbo). In many locations C. rodgersii were very abundant and formed extensive barrens. This most probably impacted on algal assemblages, with many sites devoid of canopy forming algae in the depth ranges (5 and 10 m) surveyed. Algae covering most substrata sampled were crustose coralline algae, species of Peyssonnelia (red algae) and Ecklonia radiata (brown kelp). The survey methodology was designed to detect changes at all levels of species interaction and the response of sanctuary zones to protection. Ideally surveys should be repeated each year, producing a time-series of data documenting changes in the abundance and distribution of species of interest. This would also provide an indication of MPA performance as observed changes between management zones could be differentiated from chance divergence. It would also provide a reference for assessing the extent of fishing related influence on the regions subtidal reef ecosystems. Surveys of fish and mobile invertebrates should be repeated on an annual basis and surveys of algal assemblages be conducted on at least a biannual basis, until biotic changes associated with MPA protection stabilise. Because the sites surveyed in 2005 & 2006 were deliberately different (utilising available resources to maximise sampling coverage of the BMP and sanctuary zones), the large number of sites surveyed overall meant not all could be re-surveyed in the time available in 2007. The 2007 sites therefore represent a random sample of those covered by previous surveys, and as many as could be sampled within the time and logistical constraints imposed. If there are to be ongoing annual surveys in BMP, a subset of the existing sites need to be chosen, such that they can all be reliably repeated on an annual basis within the time frame that budgets will allow. The work to date provides a comprehensive baseline from which an ongoing program may be developed and refined within those budgetary constraints...|$|R
