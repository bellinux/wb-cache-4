5|$|As part of <b>this</b> <b>Popular</b> Revolution, Gaddafi invited Libya's {{people to}} found General People's Committees as {{conduits}} for raising political consciousness.

He hoped that the councils would mobilise the people behind the RCC, erode the power of the traditional leaders and the bureaucracy, and allow for a new legal system chosen by the people. Many such committees were established in schools and colleges, where they were responsible for vetting staff, courses, and textbooks to determine if they were compatible with the country's revolutionary ideology.|$|E
