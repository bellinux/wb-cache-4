5|$|The 2007 {{version was}} {{announced}} September 12, 2006. A <b>tabbed</b> interface {{allows users to}} access the Norton Protection Center and the program settings without separate tray icons and windows open. Symantec revised Norton Internet Security and made this version more modularized, which has reduced the suite's memory usage to 10–15 megabytes and scan times by 30–35 percent. Another result is that spam filtering and parental controls are separate components to install. When installed, the features consume 100 MB of disk space.|$|E
5|$|<b>Tabbed</b> as {{a starter}} during the preseason, Auguste, {{as one of the}} team's few post options, {{established}} himself {{as a starter}} during his junior season with good performances early in the season, albeit against weaker opposition. A memorable December 13, 2014 game against Florida State, in which he scored a career-high 26 points, started what coach Brey described as a run of key contributions from the forward, with Auguste quickly recouping from his bad performances. In January 2015, Auguste was sidelined by Notre Dame due to academic issues, with the length of the suspension undisclosed. It would ultimately only last three days, with the unknown reason later described as minor by the player. Auguste was seen as a major contributor to the Irish's 2015 ACC Tournament title contributing 16 points and 13 rebounds in the final against North Carolina (for an average of more than 11 points and 9 rebounds in the whole tournament).|$|E

The fin was also triangular, with a semi-circular, unbalanced but <b>tabbed</b> rudder. The undercarriage units were mounted at the end of each stub-wing, giving it a wide 5.70 m (18ft 8 in) track. The wheels were large, with low pressure tyres of 1,150mm diameter and 250mm width (45 × 10 in). Each unit had an axle, articulated at the lower longeron, and a pair of oleo legs fixed to the stub wing where the lift struts joined.|$|E

5000|$|Initially <b>tab</b> stops {{were set}} by adding and {{removing}} clips from the <b>tab</b> rack, but Edward Hess {{working for the}} Royal Typewriter Company filed for a patent in 1904 covering a system where the <b>tab</b> stops were permanently mounted on the <b>tab</b> bar. To set or reset a <b>tab</b> for a particular column, the <b>tab</b> stop for that column was simply rotated {{in or out of}} engagement. [...] In 1940, James Koca filed for a patent on a mechanism allowing the <b>tab</b> stops for each column to be set and cleared from the keyboard, eliminating the need for the typist to bend {{over the back of the}} machine to directly manipulate the <b>tab</b> rack. [...] These keys, if present, are typically labeled <b>tab</b> set and <b>tab</b> clear.|$|R
50|$|Samsung WatchON, first {{introduced}} on Galaxy S4 devices, was {{a service that}} allowed users to view programming information on their TV or set-top box, and choose programs directly from their mobile devices. Samsung WatchON also provides real-time programming and VOD content recommendations based on the user's viewing patterns; it also includes a virtual remote controller which uses the built-in IR Blaster of the device to control televisions, home theater systems, and media players of any brand, provided they are IR compatible. Samsung WatchON {{is available on the}} Galaxy S4, Galaxy S4 Mini, Galaxy S5, Galaxy S5 Mini, Galaxy Note 3, Galaxy Note 3 Neo, Galaxy Note 4, Galaxy Note Edge, Galaxy Alpha, Galaxy Note 8.0, Galaxy Note 10.1, Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 Edition, Galaxy Note Pro 12.2, Galaxy <b>Tab</b> 2 7.0, Galaxy <b>Tab</b> 2 10.1, Galaxy <b>Tab</b> 3 7.0, Galaxy <b>Tab</b> 3 8.0, Galaxy <b>Tab</b> 3 10.1, Galaxy <b>Tab</b> 4 7.0, Galaxy <b>Tab</b> 4 8.0, Galaxy <b>Tab</b> 4 10.1, Galaxy <b>Tab</b> Pro 8.4, Galaxy <b>Tab</b> Pro 10.1, Galaxy <b>Tab</b> Pro 12.2, Galaxy <b>Tab</b> S 8.4, Galaxy <b>Tab</b> S 10.5, and Gear 2 devices.|$|R

25|$|Tabnabbing takes {{advantage}} of <b>tabbed</b> browsing, with multiple open tabs. This method silently redirects the user to the affected site. This technique operates in reverse to most phishing techniques in that it doesn't directly take the user to the fraudulent site, but instead loads the fake page {{in one of the}} browser's open tabs.|$|E
25|$|The browser {{also has}} limited <b>tabbed</b> browsing, {{with a maximum}} of three tabs. When a website tries to open a link in a new window, the browser opens it in a new tab. The PSP browser is slower {{compared}} to modern browsers and often runs out of memory due to limitations put in place by Sony.|$|E
50|$|Samsung {{announced}} the Galaxy <b>Tab</b> S3 on 26 February 2017. Unlike the Galaxy <b>Tab</b> S and Galaxy <b>Tab</b> S2, the Galaxy <b>Tab</b> S3 only comes in one size, a 9.7-inch model.|$|R

Similarly, focusing on a table exposes table-related options in a specific <b>tab.</b> Contextual <b>Tabs</b> remain hidden except when an applicable object is selected.|$|R

25|$|Opera is a {{web browser}} for Windows, macOS, and Linux {{operating}} systems developed by Opera Software. It uses the Blink layout engine. An earlier version using the Presto layout engine is still available, and runs on FreeBSD systems.

50|$|Finding a {{specific}} <b>tab</b> in a 3 or 4 level tabular interface {{can be difficult}} for some people. Part of the issue with this difficulty lies in {{the lack of any}} sorting scheme. Without such <b>tabs</b> can be strewn about without any sense of order, thus looking for a <b>tab</b> provides no meaningful understanding of a position to a <b>tab</b> relative to other <b>tabs.</b> Additionally, the clutter created by multiple <b>tabs</b> can create a dialog that is unusually small, with the <b>tabs</b> above it dominating the window.|$|R

50|$|In {{addition}} to the updated new <b>tab</b> and home <b>tab</b> page, Mozilla has added a user profile cleaner/reset, reduced hang times, and implemented <b>tabs</b> on demand.

Mozilla's <b>tabs</b> on demand restores <b>tabs</b> that were open in the previous session, but will keep the <b>tabs</b> unloaded until the user requests to view the page.|$|R
