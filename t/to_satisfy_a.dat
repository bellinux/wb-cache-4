5|$|Despite {{originally}} {{being set}} for October 30, the film's release date was rescheduled for October 26, 2009 {{due to a}} strong demand by Jackson's fans. The film was given a worldwide release and a limited two-week theatrical run from October 28 to November 10, 2009, but theatrical release was later extended. Tickets went on sale a month early (on September 27) <b>to</b> <b>satisfy</b> <b>a</b> high anticipated demand; the film broke numerous records via tickets both presale and sales worldwide.|$|E
5|$|In {{computer}} science, 2-satisfiability, 2-SAT or just 2SAT is a computational {{problem of}} assigning values to variables, {{each of which}} has two possible values, in order <b>to</b> <b>satisfy</b> <b>a</b> system of constraints on pairs of variables. It is a special case of the general Boolean satisfiability problem, which can involve constraints on more than two variables, and of constraint satisfaction problems, which can allow more than two choices for the value of each variable. But in contrast to those more general problems, which are NP-complete, 2-satisfiability can be solved in polynomial time.|$|E
5|$|Presidential {{elections}} were held within {{three weeks after}} the departure of Musharraf. Zardari vowed to pursue an unpopular campaign against tribal militancy in Pakistan and had the support of the United States. He claimed he had a London business school degree <b>to</b> <b>satisfy</b> <b>a</b> prerequisite for the presidency, but his party did not produce a certificate. He was endorsed by the PPP and the Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) for the presidency. The PML-N nominated former justice Saeed-uz-Zaman Siddiqui, while the PML-Q put forth Mushahid Hussain Sayed. Zardari won a majority in the Electoral College with 481 of 702 votes. He was elected President on 6 September 2008.|$|E

5|$|After Urilla's death, Wyatt {{went through}} a {{downward}} spiral and {{had a series of}} legal problems. On March 14, 1871, Barton County filed a lawsuit against Earp and his sureties. Earp was in charge of collecting license fees for Lamar, which funded local schools, and he was accused of failing to turn in the fees. On March 31, James Cromwell filed a lawsuit against Earp, alleging that Earp had falsified court documents about the amount of money collected from Cromwell <b>to</b> <b>satisfy</b> <b>a</b> judgment. To make up the difference between what Earp turned in and Cromwell owed (which he claimed to have paid), the court seized Cromwell's mowing machine and sold it for $38. Cromwell's suit claimed that Earp owed him $75, the estimated value of the machine.|$|E
5|$|In 1902, the First Roumanian-American congregation/Congregation Shaarey Shamoyim {{purchased}} the Rivington Street building from the Church Extension and Missionary Society <b>to</b> <b>satisfy</b> <b>a</b> {{need for a}} larger building to serve the Lower East Side's rapidly growing Romanian-Jewish population. At the time, the property was valued at $95,000 (today $). The funds for the purchase were raised from {{the members of the}} congregation, and to honor those contributing $10 or more, names were engraved on one of four marble slabs in the stairway to the main sanctuary. The most generous gift was $500, at a time when $10 was two weeks' pay. The congregation also took out two mortgages; one for $50,000 (today $) with the Title Insurance Company, and a second for $30,000 (today $) with the Church Extension and Missionary Society.|$|E
5|$|Because And Yet It Moves was {{originally}} designed to be played with digital controls, the Wii Remote's analog motion controls needed to be implemented such that they felt natural and not intrusive. Broken Rules determined, following a number of tests, that allowing the player to freely rotate to any degree best suited motion controls; originally the player could only rotate in 90 degree intervals. Four different control schemes were implemented <b>to</b> <b>satisfy</b> <b>a</b> wide number of players, three of which either use motion control or the Wii Remote pointer. While the file size limit imposed on WiiWare games was not an issue, the visuals needed to be downsampled to cohere with the Wii hardware. A standard-definition television was used in development; Bohatsch felt the visuals looked nicer on the SDTV than on a PC or Mac with higher display resolution, but warned that some HDTVs might not upsample the Wii resolution properly, recommending that a component cable be used while playing the game. The online leaderboards were omitted from the Wii version because the PC version's leaderboards were not frequently used. Three new levels, unlocked when the player completes the main campaign mode, were added. The near {{final version of the}} game was submitted to Nintendo's Quality Assurance team in May 2010 to inspect and find bugs. And Yet It Moves was released on the Wii Shop Channel in North America on August 23, 2010 and then in Europe on August 27.|$|E

40|$|Disclosed is a {{constrained}} clipping {{technique for}} reducing the peak-to-average power ratio (PAR) or crest factor of a multicarrier communications signal. This is a transmitter-side processing technique that does not impose any modification at the receiver. Constrained clipping achieves PAR reduction while simultaneously satisfying spectral mask and error vector magnitude (EVM) constraints that are specified by most modern communications standards. The constrained clipping technique includes two independent processing units, one <b>to</b> <b>satisfy</b> <b>an</b> in-band EVM constraint and the other <b>to</b> <b>satisfy</b> <b>an</b> out-of-band spectral constraint. Achievable PAR reduction results vary depending on a particular standard's requirements, but by using constrained clipping on a QPSK WiMax signal with 256 subcarriers, for example, a 4. 5 dB PAR reduction at the 10 ? 2 complementary cumulative distribution function (CCDF) level can be obtained.
