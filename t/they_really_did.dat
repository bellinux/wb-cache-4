500|$|In 1971, for {{the first}} time, the Assay Commission had no silver coins to test; none were struck by the Mint for {{circulation}} in 1970. [...] Although part-silver Kennedy half dollars were struck in 1970, they were only for collectors and were not put aside for assay. Commissioners could instead test 21,975 dimes and 11,098 quarters, all made from copper-nickel clad, though as the Associated Press, reporting on the 1973 Assay Commission, put it, [...] "a discovery of a bum coin hasn't occurred in years." [...] Only one in every 100,000 clad or silver-clad pieces was put aside for the Assay Commission, and only one in every 200,000 dimes. [...] At the 1974 meeting, one copper-nickel Eisenhower dollar was discovered which weighed [...] below specification; after reference to the rules, the coin was deemed barely within guidelines. [...] Numismatist Charles Logan, in his 1979 article about the impending end of the Assay Commission, stated that this incident pointed out [...] "the basic problem with the annual trial. First, the members were not exactly sure how their job was done, or what the requirements were. [...] Second, <b>they</b> <b>really</b> <b>did</b> not want to report a fault in the coinage. [...] Finally, even if the one dollar coin had been found faulty, [...] little consequence, except to prompt greater vigilance at the Mint." ...|$|E

Their chosen method of being helpful was to attend meetings at one another's homes and discuss the problems of the hungry hordes after dinner. I am not trying to be amusing; it's what <b>they</b> <b>really</b> <b>did.</b> A Party member was usually invited to lead the discussions. I was apolitical.

2500|$|Giovanni Cassini {{published}} {{a much more}} accurate ephemeris table in 1668 using his observations from the previous 16 years. Using this table, Cassini generated a more accurate map of France by observing eclipses of the Jovian satellites at various locations across the country. This showed that previous maps had depicted some shorelines as extending farther than <b>they</b> <b>really</b> <b>did,</b> which caused the apparent area of France to shrink, and led King Louis XIV to comment that [...] "he was losing more territory to his astronomers than to his enemies." [...] Eclipse timings of the Jovian moons {{would continue to be}} used to determine longitude for another hundred years for tasks such as surveying the Mason–Dixon line and geodesy measurements. Efforts were made to utilize this method for marine navigation, but it proved to be impossible to make the necessary observations with sufficient accuracy from the moving deck of a ship; it would not be until the invention of the marine chronometer in the mid-18th century that determining longitude at sea became practical.|$|E
2500|$|Oser already {{received}} angered clarifications from several communities. But in March and April 1819, {{the most senior}} Italian authority, Rabbi Abraham Eliezer ha-Levi of Triest, journeyed the peninsula from his city {{as far south as}} Ragusa. In every community, he collected lettres of reprimand and condemnation against the Hamburg reformers. Shem-Tov Samun criticized [...] "those who rebelled" [...] against the rabbis and prevalent customs of their community. Recanati's response was not recorded. While not necessarily reneging on their former rulings, the Italians elucidated that they set many limitations and that those were more theoretical than concrete permits, adding harsh attacks against the [...] "sectarians and schismatics". Lois C. Dubin argued that their stance was not just a reaction to the threat upon the authority of tradition and rabbinic jurisdiction: [...] "they had always spoken on behalf of custom, continuity and tradition. In 1816, they had as well, drawing upon Italian practice and halakhic arguments... Though they were misconstrued as supporters of reform, <b>they</b> <b>really</b> <b>did</b> not favour the change of customary practice. What confused German modernizers was that they failed to see that the Italians were speaking from a different context and tradition. What was customary in one locale was innovative in the other; what looked radical here, could in fact be defended by tradition elsewhere." ...|$|E

60|$|Here, in an {{age when}} a new rector had, ceased to be an all-absorbing topic in social life, was a new and {{somewhat}} exhilarating experience. And it may be privately confessed that there were some who sat in St. John's during those first weeks of his incumbency who would indignantly have repudiated the accusation that they were not good churchmen and churchwomen, and who nevertheless had queer sensations in listening to ancient doctrines set forth with Emersonian conviction.

Not even when children in the nursery had they been so free from variance or bitterness as while waiting the issue of their sister's illness; both humbled, both feeling themselves in part the cause, each anxious to cheer and console the other--one, weak, subdued, dependent--the other, considerate, helpful, and eager to atone for past harshness.

Sharpit explained to them how each man might be assisted in his own business if this rich London tailor could be brought in for the borough.

60|$|He {{tried to}} bring back better ways to Rome, which was in a sad state, full of vice and riot, and with little of the old, noble, hardy ways of the former times.

The best men of the time were those who had taken up the Stoic philosophy, which held that virtue was above all things, whether it was rewarded or not; the worst were often the Epicureans, who held that we had better enjoy all we can in this life, being sure of nothing else.|$|E

He looked very terrible, but was very civil to those whom he knew, and very soon became devoted to all the family, especially to little Ben. However, most of the garrison and the poorer folk of the town were taken up with mending the weak places in the walls, and digging ditches with the earth of which they made steep banks, and there were sentries at the gates, who were not always civil. Whatever the country people brought into the town was eagerly bought up, and was paid for, not often in the coin of the realm, but by tokens made of tin or some such metal with odd stamps upon them, and though they {{could be used as}} money they would not go nearly so far as the sums they were held to represent--at least in anyone's hands but those of the officers.|$|E
