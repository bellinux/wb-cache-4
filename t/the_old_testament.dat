5|$|Fenwick's {{beliefs are}} similar to Trollope's own. In his early life, the novelist was a {{supporter}} of the Tractarians. However, beginning in about the mid-1860s, his sympathies tended increasingly toward the Broad church. He defended Bishop Colenso, expressed doubt about the literal truth of <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Testament,</b> and questioned the doctrine of eternal punishment contained in the Athanasian Creed.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Testament</b> {{refers to}} ten {{individual}} commandments, {{even though there}} are more than ten imperative sentences in the two relevant texts: Exodus 20:1–17 and Deuteronomy 5:6–21. <b>The</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Testament</b> does not make clear how the texts should be divided to arrive at ten commandments. The division traditionally used by the Roman Catholic and Lutheran churches was first derived by the Latin Church Father Augustine of Hippo (354–430) in his book Questions on Exodus. Other Christian communities, such as the Orthodox Church and many Protestant churches, use the formulation standardized by the Greek Fathers of the Christian East. The two forms have slightly different numbering, but maintain exactly the same substance despite some Protestant claims to the contrary. Rabbinic Jewish numbering is more closely aligned with the Eastern Church tradition, considering the text against covetousness as a single proscription, but differs from Christian denominations in that it considers what many Christians call a prologue to be the entire first commandment.|$|E

5|$|The {{number of}} scribes were disputed in the past. According to Kenyon's opinion {{there were five}} scribes, two scribes in <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Testament</b> (I and II) and three in the New (III, IV, and V). Subsequently, Skeat and Milne argued {{there were only two}} or {{possibly}} three scribes. Present scholars agreed in that case (Metzger, Aland, Hernández, Jongkind).|$|E

5|$|While large {{portions}} of <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Testament</b> are missing, {{it is assumed that}} the codex originally contained the whole of both Testaments.

5|$|According to Cockerell, {{the side}} of the façade that is to the south of the central door is the more sacred and the scheme is divided accordingly. The lowest range of niches each {{contained}} a standing figure, of which all but four figures on the west front, two on each side, have been destroyed. More have survived on the northern and eastern sides of the north tower. Cockerell speculates that those to the south of the portal represented prophets and patriarchs of <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Testament</b> while those to the north represented early missionaries to Britain, of which Augustine of Canterbury, St Birinus, and Benedict Biscop are identifiable by their attributes. In the second zone, above each pair of standing figures, is a quatrefoil containing a half-length angel in relief, some of which have survived. Between the gables of the niches are quatrefoils that contain a series of narratives from the Bible, with <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Testament</b> stories to the south, above the prophets and patriarchs, and those from the New Testament to the north. A horizontal course runs around the west front dividing the architectural storeys at this point.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the many}} {{accounts}} of ancient breeds of piebald sheep {{is the story}} of Jacob from the first book of the Hebrew Bible, called by Christians <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Testament.</b> According to the Book of Genesis (Genesis 30:3143), Jacob took every speckled and spotted sheep from his father-in-law's (Laban's) flock and bred them. Due to the resemblance to the animal described in Genesis, the Jacob sheep was named for the Biblical figure of Jacob sometime in the 20th century.|$|E
