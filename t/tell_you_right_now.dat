[...] Polone viewed the move, as a whole, a reactionary one by Zucker, concluding that he was acting in self-preservation, since NBCUniversal owner General Electric (GE) was in the process of negotiating the sale of a controlling interest in the company to cable operator Comcast. When a story ran that night on The New York Times website that Fox had an [...] "overt interest" [...] in O'Brien and was not going along with the plan, Zucker reasoned that Polone was to blame. The situation became heated when Zucker placed a call to O'Brien's agent, Rick Rosen, inquiring on the story and demanding an immediate answer from the O'Brien camp regarding the changes. Gaspin spoke on the situation at a previously scheduled press conference that Sunday, noting that [...] "I obviously couldn’t satisfy either with 100 percent of what they wanted. That’s why I came up with this compromise."

However, an unclassified summary of a 2001 CIA report suggests that Speicher's aircraft {{was shot down}} by a missile fired from an Iraqi aircraft, most likely a MiG-25, flown by Lieutenant Zuhair Dawood, 84th squadron of the Iraqi Air Force. [...] Speicher was at 28,000 feet and travelling at 0.92 Mach (540 Knots) when {{the front of the}} aircraft suffered a catastrophic event.
