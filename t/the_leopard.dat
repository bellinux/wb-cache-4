5|$|While the jaguar {{closely resembles}} <b>the</b> <b>leopard,</b> it is {{sturdier}} and heavier, {{and the two}} animals can be distinguished by their rosettes: the rosettes on a jaguar's coat are larger, fewer in number, usually darker, and have thicker lines and small spots in the middle that <b>the</b> <b>leopard</b> lacks. Jaguars also have rounder heads and shorter, stockier limbs compared to leopards.|$|E
5|$|During 1973, B Squadron, 1st Armoured Regiment—designated the Medium Tank Trials Unit (MTTU)—evaluated the German Leopard 1 {{against the}} American M60A1 Patton as a {{replacement}} for the obsolete Centurions. <b>The</b> <b>Leopard</b> was judged the superior tank, and 90 gun tanks, eight Leopard 1 Armoured Recovery Vehicles Medium and five Leopard 1 bridge layer tanks were ordered. The Australian tanks were designated <b>the</b> <b>Leopard</b> AS1, and were based on <b>the</b> <b>Leopard</b> 1A3 which had been built for the German Army. The main difference between the Australian and German tanks was the inclusion of a SABCA fire control system, equipment to allow the tank to better operate in the tropics, additional storage boxes {{on the sides of the}} tank as well as improved trunnion bearings and combustion cleaners. These tanks were delivered to Australia in batches between 1976 and 1978. During the Leopard's service very little in the way of upgrades were undertaken, and by the 1990s they had become obsolete.|$|E

5|$|The cheetah {{is often}} {{confused}} with <b>the</b> <b>leopard</b> and the cougar {{and can be}} distinguished by its small round spots {{in contrast to the}} leopard's rosettes and the cougar's plain coat; in addition, <b>the</b> <b>leopard</b> lacks the tear streaks of the cheetah. The cougar possesses neither the tear streaks nor the spotted coat pattern of the cheetah. The serval has a form very {{similar to that of the}} cheetah but is significantly smaller. Moreover, it has a shorter tail and spots that fuse to form stripes on the back.|$|E
5|$|The genus Triakis {{contains}} two subgenera, Triakis and Cazon. <b>The</b> <b>leopard</b> shark is placed within the subgenus Triakis {{along with the}} banded houndshark (T.

50|$|Lafayette quickly {{established}} a winning tradition. In their fourth season, <b>the</b> <b>Leopards</b> went 10-1, {{followed by a}} 15-3 season in 1976-77. Led by head coach Barbara Young, <b>the</b> <b>Leopards</b> received their first postseason bid to the Eastern Association of Intercollegiate Athletics for Women (EAIAW) playoffs (NCAA predecessor). <b>The</b> <b>Leopards</b> defeated Kutztown University before bowing out to Princeton University in their second loss to the Tigers that season.

5|$|The Appaloosa is an American horse breed {{best known}} for its {{colorful}} spotted coat pattern. There is a wide range of body types within the breed, stemming from the influence of multiple breeds of horses throughout its history. Each horse's color pattern is genetically the result of various spotting patterns overlaid on top of one of several recognized base coat colors. The color pattern of the Appaloosa is of interest to those who study equine coat color genetics, as it and several other physical characteristics are linked to <b>the</b> <b>leopard</b> complex mutation (LP). Appaloosas are prone to develop equine recurrent uveitis and congenital stationary night blindness; the latter has been linked to <b>the</b> <b>leopard</b> complex.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Leopard</b> 2E or Leopard 2A6E (E {{stands for}} España, Spanish for Spain) is {{a variant of}} the German Leopard 2 main battle tank, {{tailored}} to the requirements of the Spanish army, which acquired it as part of an armament modernization program named Programa Coraza, or Program Breastplate. The acquisition program for the Leopard2E began in 1994, five years after the cancellation of the Lince tank program that culminated in an agreement to transfer 108 Leopard 2A4s to the Spanish army in 1998 and started the local production of <b>the</b> <b>Leopard</b> 2E in December 2003. Despite postponement of production owing to the 2003 merger between Santa Bárbara Sistemas and General Dynamics, and continued fabrication issues between 2006 and 2007, 219 Leopard2Es have been delivered to the Spanish army.|$|E
5|$|Based on {{morphological}} evidence, British zoologist Reginald Pocock {{concluded the}} jaguar is most {{closely related to}} <b>the</b> <b>leopard.</b> However, DNA evidence is inconclusive and {{the position of the}} jaguar relative to the other species varies between studies. Fossils of extinct Panthera species, such as the European jaguar (Panthera gombaszoegensis) and the American lion (Panthera atrox), show characteristics of both the lion and the jaguar. Analysis of jaguar mitochondrial DNA has dated the species' lineage to between 280,000 and 510,000 years ago, later than suggested by fossil records.|$|E

5|$|Harmless to humans, <b>the</b> <b>leopard</b> shark {{is caught}} by {{commercial}} and recreational fisheries {{for food and}} the aquarium trade. This species is mostly fished in the waters off California where, {{after a period of}} population decline in the 1980s, new fishing regulations in the early 1990s reduced harvesting to sustainable levels. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed this species as of Least Concern, while noting that local stocks may easily become overfished because of the shark's slow growth and limited migratory habits.|$|E
5|$|Mainly nocturnal in habits, after dusk <b>the</b> <b>leopard</b> {{catshark}} hunts for small, benthic {{bony fishes}} and invertebrates in shallow water. In daytime, it generally rests inside caves and crevices, sometimes in groups. This species {{has been documented}} ambushing spawning chokka squid (Loligo vulgaris reynaudi) within their spawning grounds. Reproduction is oviparous and proceeds year-round. Females produce rectangular, light-colored egg capsules two at a time, attaching them to structures on the sea floor. Small and harmless, <b>the</b> <b>leopard</b> catshark adapts well to captivity and is often exhibited in public aquariums. It is caught by commercial and recreational fishers as bycatch, and often killed as a pest. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed this species as Data Deficient; its numbers {{do not seem to}} be declining, but heavy human activity occurs within its native waters. The possibly fragmented nature of its distribution also merits caution for each local population.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{existing}} tank fleet {{did not meet}} the Spanish army's needs, Spain opened talks with Germany and Krauss-Maffei over the possibility of future collaboration in regards to Spain's future tank, and sent a military delegation to Germany in 1994. Although the Germans offered Spain surplus Leopard 1 tanks and Soviet equipment incorporated into the German army after the reunification of Germany, the Spanish government declined these offers and pressed for <b>the</b> <b>Leopard</b> 2.|$|E
