5|$|Pterosaurs' hip sockets are {{oriented}} facing slightly upwards, and {{the head}} of the femur (<b>thigh</b> bone) is only moderately inward facing, suggesting that pterosaurs had an erect stance. It would have been possible to lift the <b>thigh</b> into a horizontal position during flight, as gliding lizards do.|$|E
5|$|Attention will {{be focused}} on the {{direction}} of the blood flow in both of the venous systems, and in the perforator veins, as well as being focused on shunt detection. A shunting of blood from the <b>thigh</b> veins back into the lower leg veins will give a reflux situation. The veins most often found to be incompetent are the saphenous veins and the perforators communicating with the deep veins of the <b>thigh.</b>|$|E

40|$|Regarding the {{backward}} {{rolling in}} the mat work the skilled and the unskilled were seen to differ in the following points; 1. Compared with their postures for make-ready, while {{the back of the}} skilled had a roundness, the unskilled had it stretched out. In the former, the angle between his trunk and his upper <b>thighs</b> and the angle between his upper <b>thighs</b> and lower <b>thighs</b> were nearly equal. In contrast, in the latter, the angle between his trunk and upper <b>thighs</b> was much larger than the angle between his upper and lower <b>thighs.</b> 2. Immediately after starting the movement entering into from the make-ready posture, little change was observed in the angles between his trunk and upper <b>thighs</b> and between his upper and lower <b>thighs</b> in the former, but a great change was recognizable in the latter. 3. The former set his rump down farther backward than the latter. 4. The former rotated with less fluctuations speed compared with the latter. 5. The former had greater values in the ratio of distances between each region of his body than the latter...|$|R

5|$|In 1877, Marsh named {{two species}} of Nanosaurus in {{separate}} publications, based on partial remains from the Morrison Formation of Garden Park, Colorado. One paper described N. agilis, based on YPM 1913, with remains including impressions of a dentary, and postcranial bits including an ilium, <b>thigh</b> bones, shin bones, and a fibula. The other paper named N. rex, a second species which Marsh based on YPM 1915 (also called 1925 in Galton, 2007), a complete <b>thigh</b> bone. He regarded both species as small ("fox-sized") animals. He assigned this genus to the now-abandoned family Nanosauridae.|$|E
5|$|In March 1916, Phillipps was {{deployed}} to France with the 28th Battalion for {{service on the}} Western Front. He participated in a raid against the forts of Armentières {{on the night of}} 6/7June, and saw action during the Battle of Pozières in July. On 5August, he was shot through the <b>thigh,</b> requiring evacuation to England for hospital treatment. He was promoted to captain on 12August. Phillipps rejoined his unit in October but suffered another gunshot wound to the <b>thigh</b> the following month, near Gueudecourt. He returned to England once more to recover, and remained in hospital until 2March 1917.|$|E

5|$|Sinosauropteryx was anatomically {{similar to}} Compsognathus, differing from its European {{relatives}} in its proportions. The skull of Sinosauropteryx was 15% longer than its <b>thigh</b> bones, unlike in Compsognathus, where {{the skull and}} <b>thigh</b> bones are approximately equivalent in length. The arms of Sinosauropteryx (humerus and radius) were only 30% the length of its legs (<b>thigh</b> bone and shin), compared to 40% in Compsognathus. Additionally, Sinosauropteryx had several features unique among all other theropods. It had 64 vertebrae in its tail. This high number made its tail the longest relative to body length of any theropod. Its hands were long compared to its arms, about 84% to 91% {{of the length of}} the rest of the arm (humerus and radius), and half the length of the foot. The first and second digits were about the same length, with a large claw on the first digit. The first fingers were large, being both longer and thicker than either of the bones of the forearm. The teeth differed slightly (they were heterodont) based on position: those near the tips of the upper jaws (on the premaxillae) were slender and lacked serrations, while those behind them (on the maxillae) were serrated and laterally compressed. The teeth of the lower jaws were similarly differentiated.|$|E
5|$|The Vishnu sculptures {{found among}} the Elephanta ruins express {{different}} styles. One wears a dhoti and has a looped girdle, while holding a conch at an angle near his <b>thigh.</b> The remnants of his sides suggest that this was likely a four arm iconography. Another statue has elements of Shiva and Vishnu. It was identified to be Shiva by Pramod Chandra, as Kartikeya by Moti Chandra, and as Vishnu by others. It shows a chain link near the <b>thigh,</b> has a gada (mace) on side, and someone {{standing next to him}} of a damaged upper portion but with small waist and full breasts suggestive of a devi. This statue too is wearing a dhoti.|$|E

5|$|The small {{saphenous vein}} (SSV), {{runs along the}} {{posterior}} aspect of the leg {{as far as the}} popliteal region, in the upper calf. Here it enters the popliteal space which is located between the two heads of the gastrocnemius muscle where it usually drains above the knee joint in the popliteal vein or a little less often in the great saphenous vein (GSV) or other deep muscular veins of the <b>thigh.</b> The use of ultrasonography has allowed a number of variations to be shown at this level; when no contact is made with the popliteal vein it might be seen to drain in the GSV, at a variable level; or, it may merge with the Giacomini vein and drain in the GSV at the superior 1/3 of the <b>thigh.</b> It can also but rarely, drain in the vein of the semimembranosus (<b>thigh</b> muscle) (shown below). Usually though, it connects with a perforator vein at its middle 1/3. To check for insufficiency, the Paraná maneuver is very useful.|$|E

In another society, there is an individual named Goodfrey who also believes that he has arthritis in the <b>thighs.</b> But in the case of Goodfrey the belief is correct because in the counterfactual society in which he lives [...] "arthritis" [...] is defined as a disease that can include the <b>thighs.</b>|$|R
