The solar powered seat was intended to allow visitors <b>to</b> <b>plug</b> <b>in</b> and listen to eight of his songs as well as an interview, but was subjected to repeated vandalism. In 2015 the bench was refurbished and the MP3 players and solar panels were replaced with metal plates on which a QR code can be scanned via a smartphone. [...] Visitors can access nine Ian Dury and the Blockheads songs and hear Dury's Desert Island Discs interview with Sue Lawley, first broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on 15 December 1996.|$|E
500|$|Rebound {{has been}} {{described}} by Retro Gamer as one of the more notable Pong variants. Despite this, unlike many other games of the time Atari did not make a sequel game. Sales numbers are not available for Rebound or Spike; additionally, a table made in 1976 by Ralph H. Baer in his book Videogames: In the Beginning containing sales numbers for most games of the time period does not contain any numbers for the two games. In addition to the stand-alone game, Atari sold conversion kits which could modify any two-player Pong variant they produced into a Rebound game. The kits included a circuit board <b>to</b> <b>plug</b> <b>in</b> to the existing game and decal stickers to cover up the original name on the cabinets with [...] "Rebound". In 1977, Rebound was included as one of the games in Video Olympics for the Atari 2600 home video game console, a collection of Pong variants, as [...] "Volleyball".|$|E

Patrick is [...] "enormously entertaining to portray" [...] because, according to Fagerbakke, [...] "when I'm performing Patrick, there are many secrets that I could never divulge". Fagerbakke's approach in voicing Patrick is [...] "much the same way I would do [...] any kind of character." [...] "I'm always looking for opportunities to explore that freewheeling imagination and insanity of children. To be able <b>to</b> <b>plug</b> <b>in</b> to that and let that carry you in to a performance is such a gas, I have so much fun with that. I love kids; I raised two girls and I love being a parent," [...] he said. The cast members record as a whole cast. Fagerbakke says that the situation improves his performance as a voice actor because [...] "there is something remarkable that happens when people are working together that is unique to that." [...] Fagerbakke modeled his performance whenever Patrick is angry after that of American actress Shelley Winters.|$|E
500|$|Although Sylvain said Rundgren {{was not an}} interfering producer, he {{occasionally}} involved himself to improve a take. Sylvain recalled moments when Rundgren went into the isolation booth with Nolan when he struggled keeping a beat and drummed out beats on a cowbell for him {{to use as a}} click track. During another session, he stopped a take {{and walked out of the}} control room <b>to</b> <b>plug</b> <b>in</b> Kane's bass cabinet. Scoppa, who paid afternoon visits to the studio, overheard Rundgren say, [...] "Yeah, that's all you needed. Okay, let's try it again!", and ultimately found the exchange funny and indicative of Rundgren's opinion of the band: [...] "Todd was such a 'musician' while they were just getting by on attitude and energy. But as disdainful as he appeared to be at some points he got the job done really well." [...] Rundgren felt Johansen's wild singing often sounded screamed or drunken but were eloquent in the sense that Johansen demonstrated a [...] "propensity to incorporate certain cultural references into the music", particularly on [...] "Personality Crisis". While recording the song, Johansen walked back into the control room and asked Rundgren if his vocals sounded [...] "ludicrous enough".|$|E
