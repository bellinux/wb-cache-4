It was then I realized why were all of them out there in their seats, dressing like me." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{author was}} further {{prompted}} {{to write about}} grace when a friend told him about encountering a homeless prostitute in Chicago who began to cry as {{she told him that}} she had raised money for drugs by prostituting her two-year-old child. When Yancey's friend asked the woman if she had sought help at a local church, she answered, [...] "Church? Why would I ever go <b>there?</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> already feeling terrible about myself. They'd just make me feel worse." [...] This story convinced Yancey that Christians are doing a poor job of communicating the message that God is willing to accept people, regardless of what they have done; the story haunted him, he said, because the woman was [...] "the type of person who would have gone to Jesus. The more unrighteous a person was, the more comfortable they felt around Jesus".|$|E

[...] However, {{she felt that she}} [...] "stuck out" [...] by being from a lower-income family than the other girls at the school. At the age of 16, she moved to Greece with her father [...] "to connect with my heritage and learn to speak the language", and sang Greek folk songs with her grandmother. Having earned an International Baccalaureate at St. Catherine's British Embassy School in Athens, she returned to Wales two years later. She and her mother then moved to Ross-on-Wye, Herefordshire.

500|$|An Argyle Hall of Famer {{returned}} to Home Park on 18 October 2009, when former England international Paul Mariner was appointed as the club's new head coach. [...] "In football, {{there is not}} much sentiment. But, if sentiment is involved in this scenario, then they gave me my very first chance as a player so I grabbed it with both hands," [...] said Mariner on the New England Revolution website, the club he left to rejoin Argyle. [...] "Plymouth Argyle are in my blood. Obviously the teams you're associated with are the ones you look for every week, and when they came knocking on my door asking me to be employed <b>there,</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> delighted." [...] His first match in the dugout alongside Sturrock ended in disappointment as Argyle lost 3–1 to Bristol City at Ashton Gate. They faced Ipswich Town, another side struggling for form, at home in their next match and a first-half goal from Fletcher put Argyle ahead, but their hopes of claiming three points were dented when the visitors equalised through striker Jon Stead, who capitalised on a poor back pass from Gary Sawyer. Welshman Darcy Blake, on loan from Cardiff City, was shown a straight red card late in the game as it ended all square. Their final game of October took place on Halloween against Middlesbrough, in Gordon Strachan's first game as their new manager. Argyle came away from the Riverside Stadium with all three points, in a game that saw Adam Johnson miss from the penalty spot, thanks to a second-half goal from Mackie to lift them to 22nd in the league table, within three points of Doncaster Rovers.|$|E

2500|$|Meanwhile, at his rival's stable, {{throughout}} Preakness week(as late as Friday, the {{day before}} the race), Easy Goer's front feet were being soaked in a tub of Epsom salts due to small scratches or cracks on both heels.

Easy Goer had [...] "problematic, puffy" [...] ankles that he dealt with throughout his career.

This project was dropped and instead Kirchner created a sculpture to be placed above the door of the schoolhouse.
