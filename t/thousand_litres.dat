The success was immediate and Ginginha became the typical drink of Lisbon. In the 2000s, the business was {{in the hands of the}} fifth generation. Currently, [...] "the Ginjinha" [...] is an exporter for the market in the United States. The production of Ginjinha reached over 150 <b>thousand</b> <b>litres</b> per year.

50|$|An Australian Water Tender {{can range}} from a {{standard}} fire engine, with a larger-than-usual capacity (usually called a tanker), to a Water Tender equipped with specialty equipment such as fixed monitors and long-throw foam nozzles (usually called a Bulk Water Carrier). Several areas also own converted semi-trailer fuel tankers, capable of holding many <b>thousands</b> of <b>litres</b> of petrol, foam or other retardant.

They {{are part of}} the microzooplankton (between 20 and 200 micrometres in size). Tintinnids are found in marine and freshwaters. However, they are most common in salt water and are usually present in concentrations of about 100 a liter but can reach abundances of several <b>thousand</b> per <b>litre.</b> Characteristics of their lorica, or shells, are classically used to distinguish the roughly 1000 species described.
