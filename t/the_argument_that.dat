5|$|From December 1851 to March 1852, Marx wrote The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Napoleon, a {{work on the}} French Revolution of 1848 {{in which}} he {{expanded}} upon his concepts of historical materialism, class struggle and the dictatorship of the proletariat, advancing <b>the</b> <b>argument</b> <b>that</b> victorious proletariat has to smash the bourgeois state.|$|E

5|$|All {{three of}} the stelae were {{discovered}} by Teoberto Maler in 1901 {{near one of the}} site's main temple, the O-13 pyramid. Stela 13 was possibly erected on a terrace reached by the pyramid's main stairway, and Stela 18 lies in a row on the plaza in front of the aforementioned stairway. Stela 23, on the other hand, was erected at the very base of the pyramid. This pyramid was most likely the burial place for Itzam K'an Ahk II, and—seeing as how Ha' K'in Xook, Yo'nal Ahk III, and K'inich Yat Ahk II all revered the site as a dynastic shrine—it is further evidence to back <b>the</b> <b>argument</b> <b>that</b> Ha' K'in Xook was the son of Itzam K'an Ahk II.|$|E
5|$|In 1985, Canadian {{historian}} William H. McNeill gave {{a series}} of three lectures on polyethnicity in ancient and modern cultures at the University of Toronto. The main thesis throughout the lectures was <b>the</b> <b>argument</b> <b>that</b> it has been the cultural norm for societies to be composed of different ethnic groups. McNeill argues that the ideal of homogeneous societies may have grown between 1750 and 1920 in Western Europe due to a growth in the belief in a single nationalistic base for the political organization of society. McNeill believes that World War I was the point in time when the desire for homogeneous nations began to weaken.|$|E

5|$|In {{the event}} that the Court {{rejected}} <b>the</b> <b>argument</b> <b>that</b> Pedra Branca was terra nullius in 1847, Singapore contended that the selection of Pedra Branca as the site for Horsburgh Lighthouse and the construction of the lighthouse between 1847 and 1851 constituted a taking of possession of the island à titre de souverain (with the title of a sovereign). The British Crown obtained title over the island in accordance with legal principles governing the acquisition of territory at that time. This title was maintained by the United Kingdom and its lawful successor, the Republic of Singapore.|$|E
5|$|It {{would take}} FDR another five years, {{with the help}} of the League of Women Voters to replace Stevens. Making <b>the</b> <b>argument</b> <b>that</b> Stevens was {{appointed}} by the Conference of the Pan-American States and not as a U.S. delegate, FDR agreed to give permanent status to the CIM, if each state was allowed to appoint their own delegates. Securing approval, he then immediately replaced Stevens with Mary Nelson Winslow. Stevens did not go quietly and the clash continued throughout 1939 with Eleanor Roosevelt backing Winslow and suffragists backing Stevens. Eleanor's objection to Stevens was multi-faced, in that she did not think that the Equal Rights Amendment would protect women and on a personal level, she believed Stevens behaved in an unladylike manner.|$|E

5|$|The Shakespeare authorship {{question}} is <b>the</b> <b>argument</b> <b>that</b> {{someone other than}} William Shakespeare of Stratford-upon-Avon wrote the works attributed to him. Anti-Stratfordians—a collective term for adherents of the various alternative-authorship theories—believe that Shakespeare of Stratford was a front to shield {{the identity of the}} real author or authors, who for some reason did not want or could not accept public credit. Although the idea has attracted much public interest, all but a few Shakespeare scholars and literary historians consider it a fringe belief and, for the most part, acknowledge it only to rebut or disparage the claims.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>argument</b> <b>that</b> {{destruction}} and terror {{are part of}} revolution I do not dispute. I {{know that in the}} past every great political and social change necessitated violence...Black slavery might still be a legalized institution in the United States but for the militant spirit of the John Browns. I have never denied that violence is inevitable, nor do I gainsay it now. Yet {{it is one thing to}} employ violence in combat, as a means of defense. It is quite another thing to make a principle of terrorism, to institutionalize it, to assign it the most vital place in the social struggle. Such terrorism begets counter-revolution and in turn itself becomes counter-revolutionary.|$|E
5|$|Another {{political}} issue surrounding the double burden is {{what sort of}} policies directly or indirectly affect those who do domestic work. Some policies that companies have, such as a lower rate for part-time workers or firing workers when they get pregnant {{can be seen as}} disempowering women. Debate as to whether this is gender segregation continues. On one side, only women get pregnant and there is a disproportionate number of women who do part-time work instead of full-time, suggesting that there should be allowances made for women. However, there is also <b>the</b> <b>argument</b> <b>that</b> similar to men who fail to meet the standards of the company and cannot comply with their contract, women who cannot perform work at the performance expected of them should be given the proportionate number of benefits and given no exceptions over men.|$|E
