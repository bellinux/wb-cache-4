5|$|Bottlenose dolphins, {{the genus}} Tursiops, {{are the most}} common members of the family Delphinidae, the family of oceanic dolphin. Recent {{molecular}} studies show the genus contains two species, the common bottlenose dolphin (<b>Tursiops</b> <b>truncatus)</b> and the Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops aduncus), instead of one. Research in 2011 revealed a third species, the Burrunan dolphin (Tursiops australis). Bottlenose dolphins inhabit warm and temperate seas worldwide. They live in all oceans except for the Arctic and Antarctic Circle regions.|$|E
5|$|The sandbar of Carabane {{has very}} few mammals other than pets, {{although}} the French first noted {{the presence of}} monkeys in 1835. In 1870, other settlers noted with disgust that the natives often ate monkeys and dogs. In the early 21st century, bottlenose dolphins (<b>Tursiops</b> <b>truncatus)</b> are commonly sighted off the island. The lack of tourism because of the civil unrest has benefited biodiversity. In this way, the nearby Basse Casamance National Park, which has been closed for years, has seen a remarkable return of Nile crocodiles (Crocodylus niloticus), Senegalese manatees (Trichechus senegalensis), and breeding birds.|$|E

500|$|The largest body {{of water}} within the park is Florida Bay, which extends from the {{mangrove}} swamps of the mainland's southern tip to the Florida Keys. Over [...] of marine ecosystem lies in this range. Coral, sponges, and seagrasses serve as shelter and food for crustaceans and mollusks, which in turn are the primary food source for larger marine animals. [...] Sharks, stingrays, and barracudas also live in this ecosystem, as do larger species of fish that attract sport fishing. Pelicans, shorebirds, terns, and black skimmers (Rynchops niger) are among the birds frequenting park shorelines. The bay also has its own resident population of bottlenose dolphin (<b>Tursiops</b> <b>truncatus).</b>|$|E
500|$|In {{the northwestern}} Atlantic, around 60% of the dusky shark's diet {{consists}} of bony fishes, from over ten families with bluefish (Pomatomus saltatrix) and summer flounder (Paralichthys dentatus) being especially important. Cartilaginous fishes, mainly skates and their egg cases, are the second-most important dietary component, while the lady crab (Ovalipes ocellatus) {{is also a}} relatively significant food source. In South African and Australian waters, bony fishes are again the most important prey type. Newborn and juvenile sharks subsist mainly on small pelagic prey such as sardines and squid; older sharks over [...] long broaden their diets to include larger bony and cartilaginous fishes. The run of the southern African pilchard (Sardinops sagax), occurring off the eastern coast of South Africa every winter, is attended by medium and large-sized dusky sharks. Pregnant and post-partum females do not join, possibly because the energy cost of gestation leaves them unable to pursue such swift prey. One South African study reported that 0.2% of the sharks examined had preyed upon bottlenose dolphins (<b>Tursiops</b> <b>truncatus).</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{sandy beaches}} of Penang National Park are the nesting {{grounds for the}} green turtle (Chelonia mydas) from April to August, and the {{olive ridley sea turtle}} (Lepidocchelys olivacea) between September and February. The Irrawaddy dolphin (Orcaella brevirostris) and the {{bottlenose}} dolphin (<b>Tursiops</b> <b>truncatus)</b> are occasionally sighted in the coastal seas off the park. Also living in the park are the leopard cat (Prionailurus bengalensis), the flying lemur (Galeopterus variegatus) and one of the world's largest arboreal rodents, the cream-coloured giant squirrel (Ratufa affinis)) ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{most common}} {{cetacean}} species {{to move through}} the waters of the greater Hans Lollik area include bottlenose dolphins (<b>Tursiops</b> <b>truncatus)</b> and humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae). [...] Some pilot whales (Globicephala melaena) may also occur in the area. [...] The presence of humpback whales is seasonal, with peak migrations occurring during January through March. [...] In addition to reef fish, schooling fish have been evaluated in the area around GHL and Litte Hans Lollik. Fish abundance is greatest in the offshore area of the east coast fringing reef and in the deep-water areas off the northwest corner of GHL. [...] Three sea turtle species occur around the island, the hawksbill turtle, green turtle, and leatherback turtle..|$|E
