5|$|As of 2014 the {{kilogram}} was {{the only}} SI unit still defined by an artifact. In 1960 the metre having previously also been defined by reference to an artifact (a single platinum-iridium bar with two marks on it) was redefined in terms of invariant, fundamental physical constants (the wavelength of a particular emission of light emitted by krypton, and later the speed of light) so <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>standard</b> can be reproduced in different laboratories by following a written specification.

50|$|The chief {{disadvantages}} are (1) <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>standards</b> {{require a}} supply of the analyte material, preferably of high purity and in known concentration, and (2) <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>standards</b> and <b>the</b> unknown {{are in the same}} matrix. Some analytes - e.g., particular proteins - are extremely difficult to obtain pure in sufficient quantity. Other analytes are often in complex matrices, e.g., heavy metals in pond water. In this case, the matrix may interfere with or attenuate the signal of the analyte. Therefore, a comparison between <b>the</b> <b>standards</b> (which contain no interfering compounds) and the unknown is not possible. <b>The</b> method of <b>standard</b> addition is a way to handle such a situation.|$|R

5|$|Casey {{returned}} to Washington, D.C. in October 1940 to become {{chief of the}} Design and Engineering Section in the Construction Division of the Office of the Quartermaster General, under Brigadier General Brehon B. Somervell. An enormous construction program was underway {{to meet the needs}} of World War II. Working with a staff that included George Bergstrom, a former president of the American Institute of Architects, Casey set about revising the standard designs for barracks. A number of new features were added to improve comfort, safety, and durability. Substitutions were made for scarce materials. It was discovered <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>standard</b> 63-man barracks was now too small. Of the 81 companies in the new triangular division, 51 fitted more easily into 74-man barracks. By slightly increasing the barracks size, substantial savings were made by reducing the overall number of buildings that needed to be constructed, the size of the cantonment areas required, and the length of required roads and utility lines. Casey was promoted to lieutenant colonel on 8 April 1941.|$|E

After subtly warning Ratnam at his residence in Delhi, Harsha secretly makes a lower bid on behalf of his father's company and wins the contract.|$|E
5|$|The {{fundamental}} theories for forces {{developed from}} the unification of disparate ideas. For example, Isaac Newton unified, with his universal theory of gravitation, the force responsible for objects falling near {{the surface of the}} Earth with the force responsible for the falling of celestial bodies about the Earth (the Moon) and the Sun (the planets). Michael Faraday and James Clerk Maxwell demonstrated that electric and magnetic forces were unified through a theory of electromagnetism. In the 20th century, the development of quantum mechanics led to a modern understanding that the first three fundamental forces (all except gravity) are manifestations of matter (fermions) interacting by exchanging virtual particles called gauge bosons. This standard model of particle physics assumes a similarity between the forces and led scientists to predict the unification of the weak and electromagnetic forces in electroweak theory, which was subsequently confirmed by observation. The complete formulation of the standard model predicts an as yet unobserved Higgs mechanism, but observations such as neutrino oscillations suggest <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>standard</b> model is incomplete. A Grand Unified Theory that allows for the combination of the electroweak interaction with the strong force is held out as a possibility with candidate theories such as supersymmetry proposed to accommodate some of the outstanding unsolved problems in physics. Physicists are still attempting to develop self-consistent unification models that would combine all four fundamental interactions into a theory of everything. Einstein tried and failed at this endeavor, but currently the most popular approach to answering this question is string theory.|$|E

40|$|I {{defend a}} {{sensitive}} neo-Moorean invariantism, an epistemological account {{with the following}} characteristic features: (a) it reserves a place for a sensitivity condition on knowledge, according to which, very roughly, S’s belief that p counts as knowledge only if S wouldn’t believe that p if p were false; (b) it maintains <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>standards</b> for knowledge are comparatively low; and (c) it maintains <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>standards</b> for knowledge are invariant (i. e., that they vary neither with the linguistic context of the subject of knowledge nor with the linguistic context of the attributor of knowledge). I argue {{that this sort of}} account allows us to respond adequately to some difficult puzzles in epistemology, puzzles such as skeptical puzzles, as well as puzzles that inspire epistemological contextualism. I also maintain that by utilizing what Keith DeRose calls a warranted assertibility maneuver, sensitive neo-Moorean invariantism can account for our epistemic judgments in each of these puzzle cases. My aim here is to provide a sketch of an epistemological account that we might euphoniously label a sensitive neo-Moorean invariantism. Such an account has the following characteristic features: (a) it reserves a place for a sensitivity condition on knowledge, according to which, very roughly, S’s belief that p counts as knowledge only if S wouldn’t believe that p if p were false; (b) it maintains <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>standards</b> for knowledge are comparatively low; and (c) it maintains <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>standards</b> for knowledge are invariant (i. e., that they vary neither with the linguistic context of the subject of knowledge nor with the linguistic context of the attributor of knowledge). My sensitive neo-Moorean invariantism stands apart from fashionable epistemological accounts in at least two ways—it unfashionably makes a place for a condition on knowledge that has its roots in a particularly unfashionable condition, namely, the sensitivity condition, and it unfashionably maintains <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>standards</b> for knowledge are invariant across contexts. I therefore do not expect my account to be especially, uh, fashionable...|$|R
40|$|Professional {{standards}} of ethics proclaim the core {{values of a}} profession, describe expected professional duties and responsibilities, and {{provide a framework for}} ethical practice and ethical decision-making.

40|$|The problematisation of <b>the</b> {{professional}} <b>standards</b> {{for teachers}} in the UK lifelong learning sector tends to focus on <b>the</b> discourses <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>standards</b> embody: discourses <b>that</b> are posited as being based on a restricted or technicist model of professionalism, that fail sufficiently to recognise the lived experiences of teachers within the sector {{both in terms of}} professional knowledge and competence, and professional development.
