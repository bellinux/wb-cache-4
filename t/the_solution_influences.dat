In this work, the formation of deposits during the drying of nanoliter drops containing colloidal particles is investigated experimentally with microscopy and profilometry, and theoretically with an inhouse finite-element code. The system studied involves aqueous drops containing titania nanoparticles evaporating on a glass substrate. Deposit shapes from spotted drops at different pH values are measured using a laser profilometer. Our {{results show that the}} pH of <b>the</b> <b>solution</b> <b>influences</b> the dried deposit pattern, which can be ring-like or more uniform. The transition between these patterns is explained by considering how DLVO interactions such as the electrostatic and van der Waals forces modify the particle deposition process. Also a phase diagram is proposed to describe how the shape of a colloidal deposit results from the competition between three flow patterns: a radial flow driven by evaporation at the wetting line, a Marangoni recirculating flow driven by surface tension gradients, and the transport of particles towards the substrate driven by DLVO interactions. This phase diagram explains three types of deposits commonly observed experimentally, such as a peripheral ring, a small central bump, or a uniform layer. Simulations and experiments are found in very good agreement...|$|E

40|$|The structural, electrical, {{and optical}} {{properties}} of zinc oxide nanowire arrays electrodeposited from {{the reduction of}} molecular oxygen in aqueous solutions containing zinc chloride and potassium chloride are studied {{as a function of}} the potassium chloride concentration. The concentration is varied in a wide range (from 5 × 10 − 5 to 3. 4 M). The evolution of the lattice parameters suggests the formation of zinc interstitials, especially for [KCl] > 1 M. The donor density of the as deposited nanowires, which was determined from electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), varies between 7 × 1018 and 4 × 1020 cm− 3. Annealing in air (1 h at 450 °C) decreases the donor density to 1017 − 1018 cm− 3, weakening the dependence on KCl concentration. The line width of the near-band-edge photoluminescence shows a correlation with the donor density.

30|$|There {{are some}} {{experimental}} {{reports from the}} fact that increasing zeolite content results in lower Cd 2 + and Pb 2 + concentrations in the leaching solution Lin et al. (1998; Oste et al. 2002; Mahabadi et al. 2007); however, in this study, the application of zeolite only increased the adsorption during the first 3  weeks. This inconsistent result could be attributed to the chemical characteristics of organic fertilizer factory leachate that was used as the influent in this research. The pH value of the influent used in this study was very low compared to the previous studies Mahabadi et al. (2007). It has been confirmed that sorption is mainly dominated by ion exchange, as H+ ions compete Pb 2 + ions for ion exchange sites (Sheng et al. 2009; Wang et al. 2009; Yang et al. 2011). Thus, the higher the pH value (i.e., lower H+ concentration), the higher the sorption of Pb 2 +, Cr 3 +, and Ni 2 + on the surface of zeolite. Yang et al. (2011) demonstrated that the sorption of Pb 2 + in low pH can be attributed to ion exchange between Pb 2 + and H+/Na+ on the surface of NKF- 6 zeolite. Nevertheless, the presence of other cations such as K+ and Na+ in <b>the</b> <b>solution</b> <b>influences</b> the sorption of heavy metals.

30|$|These are all {{physical}} effects. However, {{the final}} result {{is dependent on the}} sticking efficiency and this is a largely chemical effect. It is determined by solution ionic strength and counterion supersaturation (Mumtaz and Hounslow 2000; Ilievski and Livk 2006; Livk and Ilievski 2007). Whereas shear forces promote collisions, it is the interaction energy that determines sticking between particles. The ionic nature of <b>the</b> <b>solution</b> <b>influences</b> these forces: ions determine the surface charge and the ability of free ions to shield surfaces charges. Mumtaz and Hounslow (2000) describe supersaturation as providing a “bridging cement” between particles upon collision due to the precipitation of mineral salts on the surface. Since the degree of supersaturation directly influences the rate of precipitation, the sticking efficiency is expected to be positively correlated with it. Huang et al. (1991) showed that in CaCO 3 suspensions Ca 2 + ions were the zeta potential determining ion—ions that are free to move from the surface to the bulk solution—and that surface charge increased with increased Ca 2 + concentration. They also showed that increases in surface charge resulted in increased particle–particle repulsion and reduced agglomeration. Rashchi et al. (1998) showed that Ca 2 + adsorption on silica was again the zeta potential determining ion. However, in the presence of carbonate ions, CaCO 3 is precipitated, suggesting the importance of supersaturation and precipitation as a way to overcome the effects of high Ca 2 + adsorption and high surface charges. Our experiments examine a combination of the features above, in order to assess applicability to the subsurface fracture environment.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{characterize}} the structural modifications of model beta-amyloid peptides and the lipid membrane upon binding. The first step of this thesis was to reproduce the random-coil to beta-sheet structural transition of bAP(25 - 35). It appeared that additional energy, brought by stirring or heating, acts as a catalyst of the structural transition. Also the presence of inhomogeneous aggregates of bAP(25 - 35) in <b>the</b> <b>solution</b> <b>influences</b> the CD spectra and thereby {{the analysis of the}} peptide secondary structure. This work points out the experimental factors that can strongly influence bAP(25 - 35) secondary structure and make biophysical studies difficult. In this study, an alpha-helical intermediate was observed {{for the first time in}} the random-coil to beta-sheet transition of bAP(25 - 35). bAP(25 - 35) has no chromophore and the quantification of the peptide content was difficult, in particular under conditions of aggregation. Amyloid model peptides were therefore synthesized. The insertion of Trp either at position 24 or 32 of bAP(25 - 35) resulted in two analog peptides, WbAP(25 - 35) and bAP(25 - 35) _I 32 W. They form aggregates in aqueous buffers at micromolar peptide concentrations, similar to bAP(25 - 35). HFIP pretreatment homogenizes WbAP(25 - 35) solutions at physiological and acidic pH values. The aggregates of bAP(25 - 35) _I 32 W are small and no effect of HFIP pretreatment was observed. Aggregates with sizes ranging from 60 to 600 nm are measured with dynamic light scattering for the three pretreated peptides. Nevertheless fibril formation of the two analogs could not be observed with Thioflavin T fluorescence, in contrast to bAP(25 - 35). The presence of Trp in WbAP(25 - 35) and bAP(25 - 35) _I 32 W seems to hinder the binding of the fluorescent dye. Our work opens new possibilities in the design of amyloid model peptides that can facilitate structural and thermodynamic studies. CD spectroscopy showed that the presence and position of Trp influences the secondary structure of the free and the lipid-bound amyloid model peptides. The lipid membrane favors the random-coil structure of bAP(25 - 35) and WbAP(25 - 35) at low peptide concentration. This shows the dual role of the membrane which can enhance beta-sheet content in the peptide structure at higher peptide concentrations. Thermodynamic parameters of the peptide-to-lipid binding could be determined at pH 4. 0. In addition, we demonstrated with solid-state NMR that the insertion of the amyloid model peptides into the lipid membrane influences the fluidity of the lipid acyl chains. In contrast, the association of aggregated amyloid model peptides from the aqueous phase with the lipid membrane leads to the formation of an isotropic phase. This phenomenon is reported here for the first time and might be correlated with the toxicity of the amyloid peptide on the neuronal cells. The NMR study of DMPG at high lipid content proved that DMPG is in a bilayer state at low and high salt content. At high ionic strength, the phase transition occurs at 24 °C. At low ionic strength, two distinct bilayer phases are observed on the NMR spectra; they are characterized by a broad phase transition between 20 and 24 °C. The results obtained at low lipid content and high ionic strength are similar to those at high lipid content: bilayer features are observed on the whole temperature range and the gel-to-liquid-crystal transition occurs at 23 °C, as proved with DSC and NMR data. At low lipid content and low ionic strength, bilayer characteristics are also observed on the whole temperature range in the 2 H-NMR spectra. In contrast, during the phase transition, an isotropic line is observed in the 31 P-NMR spectra. Spectral fitting indicated that at low ionic strength, the phase transition is characterized by enhanced motions of the acyl chains and a change in the orientation of the phosphoglycerol headgroup. In addition, we observed thixotropy in all samples upon prolonged heating, independently of the lipid or salt content...|$|E

As melhores condiÃÃes obtidas nos testes preliminares foram utilizadas nos testes cinÃticos e de equilÃbrio, monocomponente e bicomponente. Para os testes preliminares e cinÃticos foram colocados, em frasco {{erlenmeyer}} de 125 mL, 300 mg de casca de soja em contato com 50 mL de soluÃÃo com concentraÃÃo de aproximadamente 4 mequiv. L- 1 do Ãon metÃlico (cÃdmio ou chumbo). Para os testes de equilÃbrio foram colocados, em frasco erlenmeyer de 125 mL, 50 a 1000 mg de biomassa com 50 mL de soluÃÃo. No teste de equilÃbrio monocomponente, a concentraÃÃo inicial da soluÃÃo foi em torno de 4 mequiv. L- 1 do Ãon metÃlico (cÃdmio ou chumbo), e no bicomponente, as seguintes combinaÃÃes de concentraÃÃes de cÃdmio e chumbo foram utilizadas: 4 - 4 mequiv L- 1, 1 - 3 mequiv L- 1; e 3 - 1 mequiv L- 1.

Em seguida, foram filtradas em membrana com tamanho dos poros de 0, 45 Âm, diluÃdas e analisadas em relaÃÃo a concentraÃÃo dos Ãons inicialmente presentes na soluÃÃo por espectrofotometria de absorÃÃo atÃmica. Todos os testes foram realizados em duplicata.

In {{this study}} the soybean hulls sorption potential in Cd 2 + and Pb 2 + in mono and binary component systems {{has been investigated}} at batch mode. In order to evaluate the effect of untreated and treated soybean hulls biomass, metal-bearing solution pH, sorption temperature, particle grain size, and agitation velocity on {{the improvement of the}} adsorption capacity of Cd 2 + and Pb 2 + cations, a series of adsorption preliminary tests, in duplicates, were performed. Regarding better sorption conditions, kinetic and equilibrium sorption experiments at batch mode were carried out for both mono and binary component systems. For preliminary and kinetic sorption experiments a series of 125 mL Erlenmeyer-type flask containing 300 mg dried soybean hulls in contact with 50 mL metal-bearing solutions at a 4 mequiv. L- 1 concentration of Cd 2 + and Pb 2 + cations under controlled temperature and agitation velocity in a shaker. Regarding the equilibrium contact time, other sorption experiments, in duplicate, consisting of a series of mixture of 50 mL metal-bearing solutions and 50 - 1000 mg dried soybean hulls biomass were also performed under controlled temperature and agitation velocity in a shaker. In single component systems, a cation concentration of 4 mequiv. L- 1 was tested, while in binary component systems three concentration combination in Cd 2 +-Pb 2 +bearing solutions were tested. After each sorption experiment, biosorbent was separated from metal solution by a 0. 45 Âm pore size membrane filtration system, performing then the determination of Cd and Pb concentrations in diluted liquid samples by flame atomic absorption spectrometry. Sorption tests regarding untreated soybean hulls biomass, pH 5 for Cd 2 + and pH 4 for Pb 2 +, 30 oC sorption temperature, a mixture of different particle grain sizes, and 100 rpm agitation velocity have showed the best results on the biosorbent performance to sequestrate Cd 2 + and Pb 2 + cations from metal-bearing solutions. The kinetic test data have shown that the equilibrium was achieved at contact times of 120 and 180 min for Cd 2 + and Pb 2 +, respectively. Meanwhile, 55 and 64 % concentration reductions for Cd 2 + and Pb 2 +, respectively, were also achieved. Furthermore, the pseudo-second order kinetic model has fitted better the sorption kinetic data for both tested divalent cations. The equilibrium sorption data for mono-component systems have been well fitted by the Langmuir isotherm model, with maximum sorption capacity (qmax) of 0. 5091 Â 0. 0054 mequiv. g- 1 and 0. 6577 Â 0. 0218 mequiv. g- 1 for Cd 2 + and Pb 2 +, respectively. Bicomponent equilibrium data were graphically represented by a 3 D adsorption surface and modeled by a modified extended-to-multicomponent Langmuir-type isotherm, obtaining good fits. The results indicates that each component maximum capacity depends on the other species at the solution, inasmuch total adsorption capacity remains constant. Besides, a second component at <b>the</b> <b>solution</b> <b>influences</b> the isotherm curve shape. Thus, based on sorption results, untreated soybean hulls biomass is an alternative low-cost biosorbent to be applied in treatment systems of industrial effluents containing high concentration of Cd 2 + and Pb 2 + cations...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the characterization of}} cowpea chlorotic mottle virus (CCMV) by using spectroscopic techniques. In chapter one and two the main properties of CCMV, which belongs to the bromoviruses, are summarized. The application of spectroscopic techniques {{in the study of}} other viruses is reviewed in chapter two. The changes in the nucleoprotein particles, induced by variation of the pH, the ionic strength or the divalent cation concentration, may be important in the process of infection of the plant. After the penetration of the virus particles into the cell, the RNA must be released from its protective protein coat (dissociation) to be transcribed, to start the production of protein and to influence the metabolism of the cell. Subsequently coat protein subunits and RNA are assembled to form new spherical nucleoprotein particles, that can be transported {{to other parts of the}} plant for new infection. Dissociation and assembly can be induced in vitro by changing the composition of the buffer solution. The accompanying changes in the structure of the coat protein subunits and in the interaction between the different constituents of the nucleoprotein particles were investigated by using a number of different spectroscopic techniques to be described subsequently. With fluorescence and phosphorescence spectroscopy, the characteristics of tryptophanyl and tyrosyl residues in the protein subunits were observed. From fluorescence quantum yield and lifetime measurements (chapter 3) it can be concluded that the presence of RNA in the protein particles results in a static quenching of part of the tryptophanyl residues. These residues become fluorescent and exposed to the solvent, when the interaction between protein and RNA is diminished by an increase in ionic strength or is completely absent as in empty protein shells or in dissociated virus at pH 7. 5 and high ionic strength. A rise in pH from 5. 0 to 7. 5 results in a similar effect on the fluorescence, probably because of a different location of the RNA in the swollen particles, compared to the stable virus particles at pH 5. 0. Because the phosphorescence spectra of proteins show more fine structure than the fluorescence spectra, the effects of conformation on the phosphorescence properties of the virus particles at 77 K were investigated. In contrast to the expectations, no influence of the conformational changes on the position of the phosphorescence maxima was observed (chapter 4). Contrary to the interpretation obtained from fluorescence experiments. the location of the peaks in the phosphorescence spectra (413 and 440 run) is more representative for tryptophanyl residues buried in the interior of the protein subunits. A more refined characterization of the phosphorescent triplet state is made by the determination at 1. 2 K of the zero field splitting parameters, using optical detection of magnetic resonance. The observed |D| - |E| and 2 |E| transitions of the tryptophan moieties showed a large bandwidth in the virus, but no fine structure. The large bandwidth must be ascribed to statistical and structural heterogeneity in the environment of the tryptophanyl residues of the coat protein subunits. It also masks the possible shifts in the zero field transitions, when the protein-RNA interaction is reduced. From the slight changes in the ODMR parameters one can conclude that a decrease in the protein-RNA interactions causes an increase in the exposure of some of the tryptophanyl residues. At this stage a quantitative interpretation of the fluorescence and phosphorescence data cannot be given. However in contrast to what has been observed with BMV, the intrinsic spectroscopic properties of (CCMV) can very well be applied to a qualitative study of the assembly of this virus and it can be utilized to check the correct encapsulation of the RNA in the protein coat. In this respect the application of techniques like optical rotatory dispersion (ORD), circular dichroism (CD) and light absorption does lead to a more complex interpretation because of the large contribution of RNA to these spectra. For rodshaped viruses like TMV with an RNA content of 5 % in contrast to the 24 % of (CCMV) ORD and CD are more useful techniques. In experiments on M these techniques were applied very successfully to obtain information about the involvement of tryptophanyl residues in protein-RNA interactions. It is difficult to relate the observations of the tryptophan fluorescence in CCMV directly to specific residues in each of the protein subunits in the nucleoprotein particles. This is a consequence of the differences in location of the subunits in the nucleoprotein particles. The protein subunits of CCMV are arranged quasi-symmetrically in the coat of the virus particles. As shown by Caspar and Klug the interactions between the subunits may differ in the vicinity of a quasi sixfold and of a fivefold symmetry axis of the protein subunit arrangement. In addition, it is not very likely that the interactions between thenucleotides and each of the protein subunits are identical. Thus instead of three classes of tryptophanyl residues in the nucleoprotein particles of (CCMV) this number is possibly higher. The heterogeneity may be caused by structural differences within the subunits. This effect is observed in tomato bushy stunt virus, where two different conformations for the protein subunits are present in the virus particle. In the case of TMV one major source of heterogeneity, the interaction between the subunits, is absent, when the 1. 5 % of the protein subunits on the ends of the rod is neglected. It is also observed that the contact between RNA and each of the TMV subunits in the rod is very similar. Apart from the probes that are already present in the protein molecules, like tryptophan and tyrosine, fluorescent and paramagnetic probes that can be attached covalently to the protein have been employed. These labels provide data about the mobility of certain regions in the protein subunits, about the role of RNA-protein interactions in this process and about the influence of small concentrations of mono- and divalent cations. As a fluorescent probe pyridoxal- 5 '-phosphate (PLP) was used (chapter 5). The advantage of this label is that it can be introduced into the stable virus particles at pH 5. 0. The mobility of the labelled part was estimated from fluorescence polarization studies. Changes in ionic strength or divalent cation concentration at pH 5. 0 had no effect on the mobility of the label. Upon swelling of the particles the label became more mobile. Immobilization occurred in the presence of divalent cations and to a smaller extent when monovalent cations were present. Measurements of radiationless energy transfer from tryptophanyl and from tyrosyl residues to the label indicated distinct changes in transfer efficiency when the conditions were varied. A second type of label used in the study of CCMV is a paramagnetic nitroxide spin label (chapter 6). By using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) the mobility of the spin label could be monitored from the shape of the EPR spectra. The application of the recently developed technique of saturation transfer EPR (ST-EPR) allows the determination of the slow motions of the virus particles. From the spin label experiments, it was observed that the mobility of the label is sensitive to conditions that influence the protein-RNA interactions and the RNA conformation. The mobility of the spin label at pH 5. 0 is increased markedly upon raising the ionic strength. Also a swelling of the particles enhances the mobility, while addition of MgCl 2 , which reduces the swelling, lowers the flexibility of the labelled region of the protein. The effect of ionic strength on the mobility of the spin label at pH 5. 0 is in contrast to the results obtained for PLP-modified virus. However a principal difference between the two probes attached to CCMV is formed by the labelling conditions. PLP is attached to the virus under conditions, that keep the particles in a stable conformation. The spin label is bound to CCMV when it is in the swollen state and where the RNA is sensitive to ribonuclease. Attempts to perform the labelling reaction at pH 5. 0 were unsuccessful. Apart from the different sites that are labelled, the differences at pH 5. 0 may reflect the incomplete reversibility of the swelling or the incorrect refolding of CCMV after the labelling at pH 7. 0. It is likely that the observed local flexibility in the protein subunits, when the nucleoprotein particles are in the swollen or dissociated form, plays an important role in the mechanism of assembly and dissociation. For TMV it has been noticed, that a change in the quarternary structure is accompanied by an increase in the flexibility of a certain section in the protein subunits. This was concluded from the disappearance of a detailed X-ray structure in parts of the double disc of TMV, while this structure could clearly be observed in the case of M nucleoprotein particles. The flexibility within the TMV protein subunits was confirmed by M spectroscopy by De Wit et al. and by Jardetzky et al. . In tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV) it was not possible to observe a considerable number of amino acid residues at the N-terminus in the X-ray analysis. It is not yet understood, whether this must be explained by a local mobility of the N-terminal arms or by an irregular folding of these arms. The effect of mono- and divalent cations on the conformation of (CCMV) which was also noticed in the experiments with labelled virus, was investigated quantitatively in titration experiments. Mn 2 +-ions were used as a paramagnetic probe and the binding of these ions was detected by means of EPR spectrscopy. Competition for binding with Mn 2 +-ions made it possible to determine the binding properties of other cations. In the bromoviruses approximately two to three ions are bound per protein subunit at pH ≥ 6. 5, while at pH 5. 0 approximately one binding site was observed. In isolated RNA relatively more binding sites were detected. Since protein without RNA is not stable at low ionic strength no meaningful binding data could be obtained in this case. The binding properties were also considerably influenced by changes in the concentration of Tris-HCl. The binding of Mn 2 +to the nucleoprotein might reflect a negative cooperative behaviour or non-identical sites. Monovalent cations can effectively displace the divalent manganese ion from the nucleoprotein, whereby the binding constant was approximately a factor 100 smaller than found for divalent cations. Pfeiffer and Durham determined the binding of Ca 2 +and Mg 2 +to BMV by measuring the displacement of protons from the nucleoprotein after addition of certain amounts of Ca 2 +and Mg 2 +. This method can only be applied at pH values below the pK of the titrating group. However the binding of metal ions to the virus is especially important at pH values above the pK of the titrating group. The more direct method described in this thesis, is more appropriate in this respect. In this way from our binding studies it could be observed that at pH 5. 0 one binding site was present, while at pH 7. 5 between two and three binding sites were observed. At pH 7. 5 the binding of cations is more important in controlling the swelling of the nucleoprotein. In the interpretation of the binding properties similar problems may arise as mentioned for the classification of the tryptophan fluorescence properties. In the investigation of specific binding sites, formed by a protein subunit and the RNA, it seems reasonable to express the binding stoichiometry in sites per subunit. However, since the environments of the subunits in the protein coat are not identical, the observed binding may be an average value from the different sites. Especially for the binding properties, it can be imagined that the stoichiometry is less determined by the individual subunits and more by the clustering of the subunits in hexamers and pentamers. From the binding experiments it can be concluded that RNA is important in the formation of the cation binding sites. The arrangement of RNA between the protein subunits can results in values of stoichiometry not related directly to a single subunit. When the binding of cations is seen in terms of neutralizing charges on the nucleoprotein particles, it will be more important to know the concentration dependence of the binding, which should not necessarily be specific, than the specific binding constants and the stoichiometry. Apart from the direct determination of the binding, it is also possible to observe indirect effects of mono- and divalent cations on native and modified nucleoprotein particles. The presence of these cations can be manifested in structural effects, like flexibility of certain regions in the protein. These effects can be employed to follow the binding. In CCMV modified with PLP (chapter 5) the addition of Mg 2 +and Na +to <b>the</b> <b>solution</b> <b>influences</b> the mobility of the fluorescent label. A more detailed study in which also other cations are used and their concentration dependence on the mobility of the label is followed, may be a useful means in the interpretation of these effects. In this thesis the characterization of CCMV, its assembly and dissociation is described, using a number of spectroscopic, techniques. In this way information was obtained about the virus conformation and its dynamic behaviour. The application of fluorescence and phosphorescence of intrinsic probes is restricted to tryptophanyl and to a smaller extent to tyrosyl residues. The interpretation of the spectral properties is often very complicated. because of the character of the residues and the large number of environmental aspects, that play a role. Labelling with fluorescent or paramagnetic probes can yield useful information about intramolecular distances, mobility and hydrophobicity in the virus particles. One should however be careful to use only modified nucleoprotein in the investigation of the structureal transitions in the virus particles. Firstly, it is difficult to estimate to what extent the effects on the label reflect the intrinsic effects and secondly, it is uncertain what the contribution is, due to the modification. When information is available about the amino acid sequence and the X-ray structure, the application of spectral techniques becomes more useful. For this reason and because of the use of several mutants. rather detailed information is obtained on tryptophan and tyrosine in the subunits of tobacco mosaic virus. For the study of protein association and virus assembly, this knowledge may yield good perspectives. In recent years the technique of laser-Raman-scattering has become a powerfull technique in the characterization of protein structure. The studies are facilitated by extensive knowledge about the interpretation of Raman spectra of biomolecules. This method also seems to be very promising for the investigation of virus structure. It provides information about several amino acid residues, the folding of the backbone and the structure of the RNA. Also information about the RNA-protein interaction may be deduced from the spectra. The role of membranes in virus assembly and dissociation can be investigated by monitoring the spectroscopic behaviour of viral protein, when nucleoprotein particles and artificial membranes are brought together. By the study of the hydrophobicity of the probes and their mobility in the protein upon penetration in the membrane it is possible to obtain information on this process. The sensitivity of fluorescence to protein-RNA interactions can be used to follow the possible dissociation of the nucleoprotein particles, when they cross the membranes...|$|E
30|$|The {{shea butter}} seed shells {{activated}} carbon (SB-AC) {{was found to}} be an effective adsorbent for the removal of formic acid and acetic acid from aqueous <b>solution.</b> <b>The</b> study showed that the initial concentration, contact time, the adsorbent dose and temperature of <b>the</b> <b>solution</b> <b>influenced</b> <b>the</b> adsorption process. Thermodynamic studies showed that the adsorption process was feasible, spontaneous and exothermic in nature. Langmuir isotherm best fitted the data for FA which confirmed the monolayer adsorption, while sorption of AA followed Dubinin–Radushkevich (D–R) model which gave information on binding energy. The adsorption of both adsorbates followed pseudo-second-order rate kinetics. Therefore, the use of SB-AC as low-cost bio-sorbent is recommended for the adsorption of other carboxylic acids from aqueous solution.|$|R

This study has shown how differences in concentration between <b>the</b> pore <b>solution</b> (i. e., <b>the</b> <b>solution</b> in <b>the</b> pores) and <b>the</b> storage <b>solution</b> surrounding <b>the</b> test specimen leads to significant transport (leaching) of the conductive ionic species between <b>the</b> pore <b>solution</b> and <b>the</b> storage <b>solution.</b> Leaching <b>influences</b> <b>the</b> resistivity of <b>the</b> pore <b>solution,</b> thereby <b>influencing</b> electrical measurements on the bulk material from either a surface or uniaxial bulk resistance test.

40|$|We {{consider}} an equilibrium {{structure of a}} monolayer formed by weakly charged polyelectrolyte chains tethered to the oppositely charged interface. The interface is characterized by an immobile charge spatially distributed in a sublayer of finite thickness submerging tethered polyions. The Coulomb attraction of tethered polyions to the surface induces their adsorption. Three complementary theoretical approaches (scaling, analytical self-consistent-field approach, and numerical self-consistent-field model) are put to the problem {{in order to provide}} a complete description of the behavior of this complex charged interface. Both the value of the charge immobilized at the surface and the ionic strength of <b>the</b> <b>solution</b> <b>influence</b> <b>the</b> conformations of grafted polyelectrolytes in a significant way.

Here, Ti 3 AlC 2 coatings were synthesized using liquid plasma spraying (LPS). Although the average temperature of particles measured in LPS was higher than 2200 K, enough to decompose Ti 3 AlC 2 phase, the resulting sprayed Ti 3 AlC 2 particles were intact. This is probably due to formation of a protective oxide on the surface in the high-temperature steam.
