5|$|M-146 {{was a state}} {{trunkline}} {{highway in}} the US state of Michigan <b>that</b> <b>initially</b> served as a bypass for traffic going around Port Huron and as a short cut for traffic between U.S. Highway25 (US 25) and M-21. Later it connected to the Blue Water Bridge before it was truncated to its final form. Segments of M-146 still exist today as state highways as part of Interstate94 (I-94) and I-69 and the Lapeer Connector.|$|E

5|$|Presque Isle is a recurved, sand spit {{that formed}} {{during the last}} glacial period, or ice age, when the Laurentide Ice Sheet {{advanced}} into the basin now occupied by Lake Erie, and, when it retreated to the north between 12,370BC and 12,790BC, left behind a moraine consisting of clay, sand, and gravel <b>that</b> <b>initially</b> formed the Presque Isle peninsula. The deposits are constantly being re-worked by wave action and are gradually migrating to the northeast due to longshore drift.|$|E

The Batman: The Animated Series skin was initially only available to GameStop customers in the U.S. with a Power-Up Rewards Membership. A PlayStation 3-exclusive Sinestro Corps outfit was revealed in August 2011 <b>that</b> <b>initially</b> was only unlockable via a unique code obtained by purchasing the extended cut edition of the Warner Bros. film, Green Lantern on Blu-ray Disc.|$|E

5|$|After Eleanor's marriage, {{many of her}} Savoyard {{relatives}} {{joined her}} in England. At least 170 Savoyards arrived in England after 1236, coming from Savoy, Burgundy and Flanders, including Eleanor's uncles: Boniface became the Archbishop of Canterbury, and William became Henry's chief adviser for a short period. Henry arranged marriages {{for many of them}} into the English nobility, a practice <b>that</b> <b>initially</b> caused friction with the English barons, who resisted landed estates passing into the hands of foreigners. The Savoyards were careful not to exacerbate the situation and became increasingly integrated into English baronial society, forming an important power base for Eleanor in England.|$|E
5|$|Data-driven, Romney often {{played the}} role of a devil's {{advocate}} during exhaustive analysis of whether to go forward with a deal. He wanted to drop a Bain Capital hedge fund <b>that</b> <b>initially</b> lost money, but other partners disagreed with him and it eventually made billions. He opted out of the Artisan Entertainment deal, not wanting to profit from a studio that produced R-rated films. Romney served {{on the board of directors}} of Damon Corporation, a medical testing company later found guilty of defrauding the government; Bain Capital tripled its investment before selling off the company, and the fraud was discovered by the new owners (Romney was never implicated). In some cases, Romney had little involvement with a company once Bain Capital acquired it.|$|E
5|$|In 1908, the New York State Legislature created Route15, an {{unsigned}} legislative route <b>that</b> <b>initially</b> {{extended from}} Hornell {{in the south}} to Caledonia in the north via Dansville and Mount Morris. Also assigned at this time was Route16, which went from Cuba to Rochester via Le Roy and Caledonia. Much of Route15 followed modern NY36; however, from Dansville to Mount Morris, it used what is now NY63 and NY408 instead. Route16, meanwhile, followed current NY36 from Caledonia to Mumford. From Jasper to Hornell, modern NY36 was part of the cross-state Route4. On March1, 1921, Route16 was truncated to end in Le Roy. Its former routing north of Caledonia became part of Route15.|$|E

5|$|In Fig.2, the {{corresponding}} {{part of the}} revolving orbit is mn with s as its centre of force. Assume <b>that</b> <b>initially,</b> {{the body in the}} static orbit starts out at right angles to the radius with speed V. The body in the revolving orbit must also start at right angles and assume its speed is v. In the case shown in Fig. 1., v > V and the force is directed towards S. The argument applies equally if v < V. Also, the force may be directed away from the centre.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the razing of the Citadel of Saigon, Định organised his local levies into a guerrilla force <b>that</b> <b>initially</b> numbered between 500 and 1000 men, operating out of Thuan Kieu. They were armed with bladed spears, fire lances, knives, sabres, bamboo sticks and swords, trained and on call as necessary. As a local notable who was respected for his leadership and military ability, Định naturally assumed a lead role in the partisan movement that responded to Tự Đức's appeals for popular resistance against European aggression. In the initial phase of the conflict, the local militias concentrated on evacuating the populace from areas that had {{been taken over by}} the French, while urging those who chose to stay to not cooperate with the Europeans. Snipers were deployed into French areas to assassinate isolated soldiers.|$|E
5|$|Next, the dissimilarity {{function}} is extended from pairs of points to pairs of clusters. Different clustering methods perform this extension in different ways. For instance, in the single-linkage clustering method, {{the distance between}} two clusters is defined to be the minimum distance between any two points from each cluster. Given this distance between clusters, a hierarchical clustering may be defined by a greedy algorithm <b>that</b> <b>initially</b> places each point in its own single-point cluster and then repeatedly forms a new cluster by merging the closest pair of clusters.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the most}} notable {{features}} of the Cunard Building are the large basement and sub-basement levels <b>that</b> <b>initially</b> acted as storage facilities for both the Company's property and also the luggage of passengers. Coal was also stored in the basement, with a small railway track providing {{a link to the}} boiler room, which was used to heat the building. Many original features of the basement still exist, including the timber baggage racks, ship logs and other maritime documents. Several secure vaults, which in the past were used to store the most valuable passenger items, are still used today to hold historic documents, drawings and blueprints relating to the Cunard Building and also some of Cunard's Liners, such as the RMS Queen Mary.|$|E
5|$|The brigade HHC was {{constituted}} on 1 April 1988 as Headquarters and Headquarters Company, Aviation Brigade, 10th Mountain Division, and activated at Fort Drum, New York. The brigade was activated at Griffiss Air Force Base in Rome, NY {{as part of}} the 10th Mountain Division (Light Infantry) on 2 July 1988. The brigade remained {{based at}} Griffiss until 1992 (August?). It appears <b>that</b> <b>initially</b> the brigade was made up of 3-17 CAV, and the 2nd and 3rd Battalions of the 25th Aviation Regiment (2-25 and 3-25 AVN).|$|E
5|$|The {{impact with}} the fire {{extinguisher}} wrenched Pryce's helmet upward sharply. Death was almost certainly instantaneous. Pryce's Shadow DN8, now with its driver dead at the wheel, continued at speed down the main straight towards the first corner, called Crowthorne. The car left the track to the right, scraping the metal barriers, hitting an entrance for emergency vehicles, and veering back onto the track. It then hit Jacques Laffite's Ligier, sending both Pryce and Laffite head-on into the barriers. Jansen van Vuuren's injuries were so extensive <b>that,</b> <b>initially,</b> his body was identified only after the race director had summoned all of the race marshals {{and he was not}} among them.|$|E

5|$|The season {{produced}} nineteen tropical or subtropical cyclones, {{of which}} seven intensified into tropical or subtropical storms; three became hurricanes, but none further intensified into major hurricanes, {{the first such}} occurrence since the 1968 season. Despite the inactivity, the 1972 season resulted {{in one of the}} worst natural disasters in American history, Hurricane Agnes. Agnes was a weak but large storm <b>that</b> <b>initially</b> made landfall on the Florida Panhandle before moving up the eastern United States. The hurricane killed 122 people and caused $2.1billion (1972USD) in damage, mostly due to flooding in Pennsylvania and New York.|$|E
5|$|W2O Group is {{a holding}} company that {{provides}} services like public relations, social media marketing, analytics, app development and recruitment for clinical trials, {{primarily to the}} healthcare, consumer and technology segments. The holding company operates through three subsidiaries: WCG, Twist Mktg and Brewlife. WCG is the public relations arm. As of 2012, it was responsible for about 80 percent of the company's revenue. Twist is a 50-person division <b>that</b> <b>initially</b> served largely as a conflict and analytics division, serving Pfizer and Galderma out of New York City. The Brewlife division serves the company's startup and emerging technology clientele.|$|E
5|$|Director Mitsuo Fukuda stated <b>that</b> <b>initially</b> {{the story}} of Gundam SEED was written from Kira's point of view. Kira's {{personality}} and thought process were derived from what Fukuda considered to be Japanese people's thoughts. He said that his story was about his forced wish to fight, in contrast to Shinn Asuka who was not reluctant to fight in Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny. In retrospective, Fukuda emphasized a contrast between both Kira's and Shinn's characters to the point both were the opposite of each other regarding their opinions; Kira's development was easier to script. Fukuda said that as both Kira's and Shinn's characters as were similar, they were easy to voice. An official guidebook to the series made an official count {{of the number of}} times Kira cried in Gundam SEED by the time the book was released. He was said to have cried over ten times, and thus a comical message of support was made towards him.|$|E
