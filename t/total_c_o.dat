40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to demonstrate the capabilities of a bleaching sequence that combined a short retention time initial chlorine dioxide stage, referred to as rapid D 0, (D 0 R), with simplified bleaching stages, (D 1 /E/D 2), that required only one final bleach washer. The test sequence DR(EPO) (D/E/D/) was compared to a control sequence, D(EPO) D, for both hardwood and softwood pulps. The capabilities of the DR(EPO) (D/E/D) sequence were successfully demonstrated. An existing three- or four-stage bleach plan {{can be converted to}} the more powerful DR(EPO) (D/E/D) sequence without the major capital cost of additional washers. The results from this study showed that the DR(EPO) (D/E/D) sequence can reach 85 brightness on SW with 2. 8 % <b>total</b> <b>C</b> 1 <b>O</b> 2, while the control sequence, D(EPO) D, required 3. 9 % <b>C</b> 1 <b>O</b> 2.

40|$|Abstract. Observations of photon {{dominated}} regions (PDRs) {{show that}} {{variations of the}} 13 CO/C 18 O integrated line intensities are closely correlated to the <b>total</b> <b>C</b> 18 <b>O</b> brightness {{along the line of}} sight (l. o. s.). From these intensity variations a change of the N (13 CO) /N(C 18 O) column density ratio from values of about 5 to 40 or larger was deduced in the past. We argue that this is naturally explained by a model of a clumpy cloud: low ratios are observed at positions of high l. o. s. column density, where the line emission is dominated by a few large clumps, while high ratios originate at positions covered by many small clumps, having low l. o. s. column density. Quantitative agreement of our models with observations of the S 140 and the Orion Bar PDR is achieved without any additional assumptions about the source geometry, thus avoiding the problems of previous models with plane parallel geometry, which required an ad hoc correlation between the l. o. s. column density and the attenuation toward the exciting sources. We conclude, that at least for high radiation field environments the <b>C</b> 18 <b>O</b> integrated line intensity is not a valid column density tracer...|$|R

We also found that the cores in the eta Car GMC are characterized by large line width and Mvir/M on average compared to the cores in other GMCs. We investigated the origin of a large amount of turbulence in the eta Car GMC. We propose the possibility that the large turbulence was pre-existing when the GMC was formed, and is now dissipating. Mechanisms such as multiple supernova explosions in the Carina flare supershell may have contributed to form a GMC with a large amount of turbulence.

The effect of <b>c.</b> <b>o.</b> <b>c.</b> b. stimulation was {{to decrease the}} magnitude of the inner hair cell depolarizing component (d. c.) and alternating component (a. c.) receptor potentials evoked by tone bursts at the characteristic frequency. At low sound pressure levels, the decrease in receptor potentials caused by <b>c.</b> <b>o.</b> <b>c.</b> b. stimulation was equivalent to decreasing the sound intensity by 9 - 24 dB. <b>C.</b> <b>o.</b> <b>c.</b> b. stimulation usually had a similar effect on the compound action potential of the auditory nerve. The change in inner hair cell membrane resistance during moderate-level sound was measured for sound alone and when sound was accompanied by <b>c.</b> <b>o.</b> <b>c.</b> b. stimulation. Sound alone produced a greater membrane resistance change than sound with <b>c.</b> <b>o.</b> <b>c.</b> b. stimulation, in proportion to the d. c. receptor potential during the same conditions. The time course of the <b>c.</b> <b>o.</b> <b>c.</b> b. effect was slow, with 50 - 250 ms required for a full effect and for recovery. The effects of varying the frequency and voltage of electrical stimulation were similar for the d. c. receptor potential and for the compound action potential. For sounds of high level and for frequencies well below the characteristic frequency, <b>c.</b> <b>o.</b> <b>c.</b> b. stimulation was less effective in reducing receptor potentials. Frequency tuning curves for the d. c. receptor potential taken during intervals of continuous <b>c.</b> <b>o.</b> <b>c.</b> b. stimulation showed decreases in sensitivity primarily in the tip segment of the tuning curve. When no sound stimulus was present, the resting membrane potential was relatively unaltered during <b>c.</b> <b>o.</b> <b>c.</b> b. stimulation.

Given that such unimolecular reactions occur {{in the absence of}} complicating factors such as solvent and counter ions, within the vacuum environment of the {{mass spectrometer}}, computational methods employing molecular orbital and density functional theories are ideally suited to examine the reaction mechanisms. A surprising rearrangement was identified by electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry of anions of azo dyes and the rearrangement was found to effect a loss of the azo moiety bridging aromatic rings as nitrogen.

In an attempt to compare and correlate the results of experiments with B. <b>O.</b> D. and <b>C.</b> <b>O.</b> D., the author carried out tests on both B. <b>O.</b> D. and <b>C.</b> <b>O.</b> D. of the organic matter contained in the samples of sea water, river water, sewage and night soil. The results are summarized as follows : (1) Both B. <b>O.</b> D. and <b>C.</b> <b>O.</b> D. of the samples of river water obtained at low tide were higher than those of the samples obtained at high tide. At both low and high tides, the samples of the surface water of a river showed higher B. <b>O.</b> D. and <b>C.</b> <b>O.</b> D. values than those of the water obtained from its bottom. It appeared that a slight shower caused B. <b>O.</b> D. and <b>C.</b> <b>O.</b> D. of river water to fall, a medium rainfall caused them to rise and prolonged rain lasting several days caused them to fall. (2) Like samples of river water, those of sea water showed higher B. <b>O.</b> D. and <b>C.</b> <b>O.</b> D. values at low tide than at high tide. (3) Tests for comparison of B. <b>O.</b> D. and <b>C.</b> <b>O.</b> D. of the samples of sewage and those of the 1 : 2 dilution of identical samples, both kept to stand at a room temperature, showed that the decrease of B. <b>O.</b> D. and <b>C.</b> <b>O.</b> D. and the decrease of the ratio B. <b>O.</b> D. / <b>C.</b> <b>O.</b> D. were more marked in the latter than in the former. (4) It was shown that the degree of dilution of any samples of raw night soil and its supernatant paralleled the fall in the values of their B. <b>O.</b> D. and <b>C.</b> <b>O.</b> D. the rate of fall being a little smaller than the degree of dilution. (5) Tests in which samples of supernatant of night soil and their dilutions were kept standing at 30 ℃ and 37 ℃ in incubators showed that B. <b>O.</b> D. and <b>C.</b> <b>O.</b> D. of the samples kept at 37 ℃ fell earlier than those of the samples kept at 30 ℃. (6) It was shown that, from the standpoint of stochastics, there were significant differences between B. <b>O.</b> D. and <b>C.</b> <b>O.</b> D. in all the samples from river water, sea water, sewage and night soil. This indicates that there will be an agreement between the result of tests by chemical method of oxygen demand based on the use of KMnO_ 4 and the result of tests by biochemical method of determination of oxygen demand, if organic matters to be tested are of similar character...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the effects of}} carbonation and regeneration temperature on the <b>C</b> <b>O</b> 2 capture characteristics using SorbKX 35, a potassium-based solid sorbent in a bubbling fluidized-bed reactor. A dry sorbent, SorbKX 35 consists of K 2 <b>C</b> <b>O</b> 3 for absorption and supporters for mechanical strength. We also measured the physical properties of the sorbent, such as pore size, pore volume, and surface area after carbonation or regeneration, to confirm {{the extent of the}} reaction. With H 2 O vapor pretreatment, nearly complete <b>C</b> <b>O</b> 2 removal was initially achieved and maintained for about 10 min within a temperature range of 333. 15 - 363. 15 K with 2 s gas residence time. At lower temperature, <b>C</b> <b>O</b> 2 capture was more effective during 1 h of carbonation. From the results of temperature programmed desorption and gas adsorption method (BET), we found that the regeneration of carbonated SorbKX 35 was not complete at 473. 15 K. The results obtained in this study can be used as basic data for designing and operating a large-scale <b>C</b> <b>O</b> 2 capture process with two fluidized-bed reactors. close 161...|$|R
