500|$|On May 28, 2003, {{the first}} {{performance}} of Wicked {{was held at}} the Curran Theatre in San Francisco, as the start of SHN pre-Broadway tryouts. After officially opening on June 10, 2003, it ran there for the month and finished on June 29, 2003. Audience reaction was mostly positive and although critics tended to compliment the aesthetic and spectacle of the show, they disparaged the state of its book, score, and choreography. Dennis Harvey of Variety commented positively of the [...] "sleekly directed", [...] "snazzily designed" [...] and [...] "smartly cast" [...] production yet still disapproved of its [...] "mediocre" [...] book, [...] "trite" [...] lyrics and [...] "largely generic" [...] music while Karen D'Souza of the San Jose Mercury News wrote that [...] "Style over substance is the real theme in this Emerald City." [...] Noting mixed response, the creative team started making extensive changes, tweaking it before its transfer to Broadway. Winnie Holzman stated, [...] "Stephen [...] wisely had insisted on having three months to rewrite in-between the time we closed in San Francisco and when we were to go back into rehearsals in New York. That was crucial; <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> that made the biggest difference {{in the life of the}} show. That time is what made the show work." ...|$|E
2500|$|Enduring {{questions}} remained after [...] "La Noche Triste" [...] (the Sad Night) {{that have}} taken the Mexican government over 30 years to answer. Eventually in 2001, President Vicente Fox, the president who ended the 70-year reign of the PRI, attempted to resolve {{the question of who}} had orchestrated the massacre. President Fox ordered the release of previously classified documents concerning the 1968 massacre. The documents revealed that Elena Poniatowska's synthesis of the events that October night was accurate, as Kate Doyle uncovered, Thousands of students gathered in the square and, as you say, the government version is that the students opened fire. Well, there's been pretty clear evidence now that there was a unit that was called the Brigada Olympica, or the Olympic Brigade, that was made up of special forces of the presidential guard, who opened fire from the buildings that surrounded the square, and that <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> that provoked the massacre.|$|E
2500|$|In 2010, Charles Thomson wrote a {{piece for}} The Huffington Post, [...] "One of the Most Shameful Episodes in Journalistic History", in which he {{detailed}} the story, as he saw it, of why [...] "the trial that was relayed to us didn't even resemble the trial {{that was going on}} inside the courtroom." [...] Luka Neskovic also wrote an article for The Huffington Post, [...] "How The Media Shattered The Man in the Mirror" [...] in which he said, [...] "...Except for this trial was declared a [...] "trial of the century" [...] and displayed media at their worst. Sensationalism, exclusivity, negativity, excentricism, chaos, and hysteria were some of the features. After all, <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> that interested them and us the most (and unfortunately there are few who do not fit into stated majority)." [...] During the trial, Matt Drudge accused the media of largely ignoring testimony and evidence that exonerated Jackson and said, [...] "Out here...Michael Jackson is being literally crucified...I think if you did a pulse poll, of people listening to these local talk shows, they would say 95% that Michael Jackson did all this...because it's based on the coverage." [...] Court TV hired tabloid journalist Diane Dimond to cover the trial even though Dimond had previously been sued by Jackson and evaded the suit with the help of prosecutor Sneddon.|$|E
25|$|Wittgenstein {{was given}} a Catholic burial at Parish of the Ascension Burial Ground in Cambridge.

50|$|Back in present, Klaus {{removes the}} dagger from Rebekah’s heart so she will wake up. When she does, Klaus also compels Stefan to {{remember}} him and Rebekah from the ‘20s and he reunites with her.

50|$|A {{characteristic}} of procedural memory <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> remembered <b>are</b> automatically translated into actions, and thus sometimes difficult to describe. Some examples of procedural memory include {{the ability to}} ride a bike or tie shoelaces.|$|R

30|$|This {{creator of}} worlds, as stated above, understands {{the world in}} which he operates, since he realizes his {{creation}} within the Creation. Kruger also reminds us that in numerous passages of the Upaniṣads, Brahman, together with his consort Māyā, <b>is</b> <b>the</b> supreme god of creation “on whom <b>the</b> worlds <b>are</b> woven as warp and woof (Kruger 2001, 24).” She explains that while Brahman weaves the universe in the threads of eternity, Māyā weaves in the threads of time, <b>that</b> <b>is,</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> of <b>the</b> world. Through Māyā’s loom, there is a chain of creation in which eternity (Brahman) flows unseen (Kruger 2001, 24). In The Circle of Reason, when Alu goes from apprentice to weaver, Shombhu Debnath says: “-The world is now your challenge. Look around you and see if your loom can encompass it.” Alu then weaves numerous butis or decorative patterns, including a “Maya-buti” (Ghosh 2005 a, 80 – 82), as an allusion to this greatest Creation. To understand {{the world in which}} he creates is to <b>be</b> beyond <b>the</b> dualities of the phenomenal world while being in it.|$|R
500|$|His {{treatment}} of dancers was sometimes caustic. Choreographer Hermes Pan recalled in 1972 interview that Prinz [...] "would make some girls hysterical. He {{loved to have}} them in tears.

6000|$|Harris {{snapped off}} the projector, {{and the lights}} came on. He and Cox blinked. [...] "That was all I could get," [...] Harris said. [...] "But I was lucky to get that.

60|$|The door closed, {{the maid}} retired to the depths, and R. Jones stole {{cautiously}} down again. He was feeling absolutely bewildered. Apparently his deductions, his second thoughts, {{had been all}} wrong, and Joan was, after all, the honest person he had imagined at first sight. Those two girls had talked {{to each other as}} though they were old friends; as though they had known each other all their lives. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> which perplexed R. Jones.|$|E
60|$|And I was {{beginning}} in the right way--right at the beginning. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing.</b> I was passing coal to the firemen, who shovelled it into the furnaces, where its energy was transformed into steam, which, in the engine-room, was transformed into the electricity with which the electricians worked. This passing coal was surely the very beginning-unless the superintendent should take it into his head to send me {{to work in the}} mines from which the coal came {{in order to get a}} completer understanding of the genesis of electricity for street railways.|$|E
2500|$|Terry Lubbock {{responded by}} {{distancing}} {{himself from the}} controversy saying, [...] "This is a diversion from the campaign which I don't want to take any part in. My aim is as it has always been, to get justice for my son Stuart and <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> only <b>thing</b> in my life now. I'm {{not going to let}} anything distract me from that.

2500|$|In an 1872 {{letter to}} Stasov, [...] Repin wrote: [...] "Now it <b>is</b> <b>the</b> peasant who <b>is</b> <b>the</b> judge {{and so it}} is {{necessary}} to represent his interests. (<b>That</b> <b>is</b> just <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> for me, since I am myself, as you know, a peasant, the son of a retired soldier who served twenty-seven hard years in Nicholas I's army.)" [...] In 1873 Repin traveled to Italy and France with his family. His second daughter, Nadezhda, was born in 1874.|$|R

60|$|Jim Lash {{rolled in}} his saddle blanket, his feet near the fire, {{and went to}} sleep. Ladd told Gale to do {{likewise}} while he kept the fire up and waited until it was late enough for Jim to undertake circling round the raiders. When Gale awakened the night was dark, cold, windy. The stars shone with white brilliance. Jim was up saddling his horse, and Ladd was talking low. When Gale rose to accompany them both rangers said he need not go. But Gale wanted to go because <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> Ladd or Jim would have done.|$|E
60|$|And {{where was}} Jim himself? It {{must not be}} {{supposed}} that that tactician had all this while withdrawn from mortal eye to tear his hair in silent indignation and despair. He had, in truth, merely retired up the lonesome defile between the downs to his smouldering kiln, and the ancient ramparts above it; and there, after his first hours of natural discomposure, he quietly waited for overtures from the possibly repentant Margery. But no overtures arrived, and then he meditated anew on the absorbing problem of her skittishness, and how to set about another campaign for her conquest, notwithstanding his late disastrous failure. Why had he failed? To what was her strange conduct owing? <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> which puzzled him.|$|E
60|$|It is now quite {{unusual to}} see any {{adequate}} criticism of short stories in English. I {{do not know how}} far the decline in short-story writing may not be due to that. Every sort of artist demands human responses, and few men can contrive to write merely for a publisher's cheque and silence, however reassuring that cheque may be. A mad millionaire who commissioned masterpieces to burn would find it impossible to buy them. Scarcely any artist will hesitate in the choice between money and attention; and it was primarily for that last and better sort of pay that the short stories of the 'nineties were written. People talked about them tremendously, compared them, and ranked them. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> that mattered.|$|E
2500|$|<b>The</b> movie <b>is</b> {{based on}} Sully's {{autobiography}} , rights to which were optioned by producers Frank Marshall and Allyn Stewart in 2010. They developed the screenplay with Stewart's partner executive producer Kipp Nelson, hiring screenwriter Todd Komarnicki. From the start, Sullenberger wanted {{the film to}} encompass [...] "that sense of our common humanity", noting that the incident had taken place shortly after the 2008 Great Recession. He explains: [...] "People were wondering if everything was about self-interest and greed. They were doubting human nature. Then all these people acted together, selflessly, to get something really important done. In a way, I think it gave everyone {{a chance to have}} hope, {{at a time when we}} all needed it." [...] Komarnicki said <b>the</b> difficulty <b>was</b> not depicting <b>the</b> landing in the river, but the investigation afterwards: [...] "It wasn't really a challenge of what to do with <b>the</b> event since <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> everyone knows about, it was more about how you parse out the information about the man slowly falling apart and becoming a hero in the eyes of the world when internally and with <b>the</b> investigators it <b>was</b> actually seemingly going the other way." ...|$|R
2500|$|Giladi {{reports that}} upon {{entering}} Israel in 1950, he was [...] "asked where I {{wanted to go}} and what I wanted to do," [...] and that he volunteered to go to Dafna, a farming kibbutz in the Galilee. He relates that he lasted {{only a few weeks}} because, [...] "the new immigrants <b>were</b> given <b>the</b> worst of everything…the food <b>was</b> <b>the</b> same, but <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> only <b>thing</b> everyone had in common. For the immigrants, bad cigarettes, even bad toothpaste. Everything. I left." ...|$|R

60|$|Then Wade {{resumed his}} {{noiseless}} and stealthy course through the woods. He began a descent, leading off somewhat {{to the right}} of the point where the smoke had arisen. The presence of the rustlers in the cabin was of importance, yet not so paramount as another possibility. He expected Jack Belllounds to be with them or meet them there, and <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> he wanted to ascertain. When he got down below the little valley he swung around to the left to cross the trail that came up from the main valley, some miles still farther down. He found it, and was not surprised to see fresh horse tracks, made that morning. He recognized those tracks. Jack Belllounds was with the rustlers, come, no doubt, to receive his pay.|$|E
60|$|I often {{wanted to}} kill Brown, but this would not answer. A cub had to take {{everything}} his boss gave, {{in the way of}} vigorous comment and criticism; and we all believed that there was a United States law making it a penitentiary offense to strike or threaten a pilot who was on duty. However, I could IMAGINE myself killing Brown; there was no law against that; and <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> I used always to do the moment I was abed. Instead of going over my river in my mind as was my duty, I threw business aside for pleasure, and killed Brown. I killed Brown every night for months; not in old, stale, commonplace ways, but in new and picturesque ones;--ways that were sometimes surprising for freshness of design and ghastliness of situation and environment.|$|E
6000|$|But {{the noise}} was the great point. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> that took Martin and Barney quite aback, {{although}} it {{was by no means}} new to them; but they could not get used to it. And no wonder! Ten thousand paroquets shrieking passionately, like a hundred knife-grinders at work, is no joke; especially when their melodies are mingled with the discordant cries of herons, and bitterns, and cranes, and the ceaseless buzz and hum of insects, like the bagpipe's drone, and the dismal croaking of boat-bills and frogs,--one kind of which latter, by the way, doesn't croak at all, but whistles, ay, better than many a bird! The universal hubbub is tremendous! I tell you, reader, that you don't understand it and you can't understand it; and if, after I had used the utmost excess of exaggerated language to convey a correct impression of the reality, you were to imagine that you really did understand it, you would be very lamentably mistaken--that's all! ...|$|E
25|$|A {{tombstone}} {{in their}} honour was erected in 1741 {{by order of}} Elizabeth of Russia over their burial place beside St. Sampson Cathedral. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> only <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> visible over their grave until 1885 when a monument was placed as they were seen as national heroes because they opposed German ideas, as represented by Biron.
