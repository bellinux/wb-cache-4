25|$|Some alexithymic {{individuals}} {{may appear to}} contradict the above-mentioned characteristics because they can experience chronic dysphoria or manifest outbursts of crying or rage.

25|$|The grey-headed canary-flycatcher was earlier {{considered}} to be an Old World flycatcher in spite of its odd crest, colours and nature of vocalization. Molecular phylogeny studies however show that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>quite</b> different and have been placed in the family Stenostiridae that is closely related to the tits and penduline-tits.|$|E
25|$|Some recent {{authorities}} have considered them all valid, even suggesting that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>quite</b> distinct.

25|$|Descriptive classifications {{are based}} almost {{exclusively}} on either descriptions of behavior as reported by various observers, such as parents, teachers, and medical personnel; or symptoms as reported by individuals themselves. As such, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>quite</b> subjective, not amenable to verification by third parties, and not readily transferable across chronologic and/or cultural barriers.|$|E
25|$|Informally, non-terminating {{decimals}} {{are easily}} understood, {{because it is}} clear that a real number can be approximated to any required degree of precision by a terminating decimal. If two decimal expansions differ only after the 10th decimal place, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>quite</b> close to one another; and if they differ only after the 20th decimal place, they are even closer.|$|E

Guildenstern {{is more of a}} thinker and worries about the consequences and implications for him of an action.|$|E

25|$|As for {{the less}} {{quantifiable}} differences—mainly {{to do with the}} content, and of which there are quite a lot—Marlovians suggest that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>quite</b> predictable, given that under their scenario Marlowe would have undergone a significant transformation of his life—with new locations, new experiences, new learning, new interests, new friends and acquaintances, possibly a new political agenda, new paymasters, new performance spaces, new actors, and maybe (not all agree on this) a new collaborator, Shakespeare himself.|$|E
25|$|There can be {{no doubt}} the NSW men are {{improving}} a good deal... They cannot be blamed for the farce, for it was nothing else. If the Australian team depends on Queenslanders to strengthen it, one is afraid it will be found wanting. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>quite</b> the weakest lot of footballers I have even seen come down from Queensland. The play needs no detailed description as it was simply a practice match for NSW, and certainly did not advantageously advertise the new game.|$|E
25|$|Chelmsford has two rivers, the River Can and the River Chelmer. Although often {{confused}} to be {{the same}} river in the city centre, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>quite</b> separate until they join together towards the east of the city to form the Chelmer and Blackwater Navigation which heads out towards Maldon before flowing into tidal waters at the Blackwater Estuary. In the other direction, the Chelmer comes from the north from its source near Thaxted while the Can comes from the West from Writtle where it separates from the River Wid.|$|E

25|$|There is {{yet another}} points table for State/Provincial wide events for the State/Provincial Championship. However, instead of wide gap points between winners and those who follow and between skill levels, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>quite</b> close i.e. for first place in Expert, Intermediate and Novice it is 20, 19, and 18 respectively. Also, {{it is only a}} one-point {{difference}} between places i.e. 20 points for first and 19 points for second place in Expert. The same for the Novice and Intermediate levels. Also unlike on the National and District level no participant points are awarded.|$|E
25|$|Both {{fabric and}} {{neoprene}} drysuits have advantages and disadvantages: a fabric drysuit is more adaptable to varying water temperatures because different garments can be layered underneath. However, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>quite</b> bulky and this causes increased drag and swimming effort. Additionally, if a fabric drysuit malfunctions and floods, it loses {{nearly all of}} its insulating properties. Neoprene drysuits are comparatively streamlined like wetsuits, {{but in some cases}} do not allow garments to be layered underneath and are thus less adaptable to varying temperatures. An advantage of this construction is that even it if floods completely, it essentially becomes a wetsuit and will still provide a degree of insulation.|$|E
25|$|Approximately 20% of {{the species}} are aquatic. Most of these drift freely {{over the surface of}} ponds and other still, muddy-bottomed waters and only {{protrude}} above the surface when flowering, although a few species are lithophytic and adapted to rapidly moving streams or even waterfalls. The plants are usually found in acidic waters, but <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>quite</b> capable of growing in alkaline waters and would very likely do so {{were it not for the}} higher level of competition from other plants in such areas. Utricularia vulgaris is an aquatic species and grows into branching rafts with individual stolons up to one metre or longer in ponds and ditches throughout Eurasia.|$|E
