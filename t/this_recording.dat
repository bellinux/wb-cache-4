5|$|For decades, Nielsen's music {{did not win}} {{recognition}} outside Denmark. The first recording was in 1933: Georg Høeberg {{with the}} Danish Radio Symphony Orchestra for Dancord. The first live recording was produced in 1950 with Erik Tuxen conducting the same orchestra at the Edinburgh Festival. An international breakthrough was made only when Leonard Bernstein recorded the symphony with the New York Philharmonic Orchestra in 1962 for CBS. <b>This</b> <b>recording</b> helped Nielsen's music to achieve appreciation beyond his home country, and {{is considered one of}} the finest recorded accounts of the symphony.|$|E

5|$|Local {{promoter}} Randy Hauser {{became aware}} of the band at a concert and offered to pay for demo recordings. However, one day before the band was due to record at the Music Bank studio in Washington, police shut down the studio during the biggest cannabis raid {{in the history of the}} state. The final demo, completed in 1988, was named The Treehouse Tapes and found its way to the music managers Kelly Curtis and Susan Silver, who also managed the Seattle-based band Soundgarden. Curtis and Silver passed the demo on to Columbia Records' A representative Nick Terzo, who set up an appointment with label president Don Ienner. Based on The Treehouse Tapes, Terzo signed Alice in Chains to Columbia in 1989. The band also recorded another untitled demo over a three-month period in 1989. <b>This</b> <b>recording</b> can be found on the bootleg release Sweet Alice.|$|E

5|$|The group {{achieved}} a satisfactory rhythm track {{in a single}} take. On 7 September, <b>this</b> <b>recording</b> – comprising two organ parts, bass guitar and drums – was reduced to two tracks on the 4-track master tape, after which Harrison overdubbed his double-tracked lead vocal, and he, Lennon and Paul McCartney added backing vocals.
