5|$|Ipswich {{had been}} relegated 18 months before Wark's {{return to the}} club and were still playing in the second tier of English football.

He was the club's equal top-scorer in the 1988–89 season, sharing the {{achievement}} with forwards Dalian Atkinson and Jason Dozzell.|$|E

5|$|The current {{highway that}} bears the M-57 moniker {{is the second}} to do so. The first is now M-75 in the Northern Lower Peninsula. <b>This</b> <b>second</b> highway was {{designated}} in the 1930s along a different, but parallel, routing. The first major changes shifted that routing southward to the current corridor in stages. Through additional extensions and truncations, the modern routing was formed by the 1970s.|$|E
5|$|The first {{usage of}} M-129 {{on a highway}} in Michigan was on a roadway {{connecting}} Lake Gogebic State Park to Marenisco and south to the Wisconsin state line; this routing was designated M-64 in 1930. The second usage was for a highway in the Keweenaw Peninsula connecting Phoenix with Eagle Harbor. <b>This</b> <b>second</b> designation was extended in 1933 to Copper Harbor and replaced by M-26 in 1935.|$|E

5|$|A further twelve bodies, pending {{refinements}} {{of knowledge}} regarding their physical properties, were possible candidates {{to join the}} list under this definition. Some objects in <b>this</b> <b>second</b> list were more likely eventually to be adopted as 'planets' than others. Despite what had been claimed in the media, the proposal did not necessarily leave the Solar System with only twelve planets. Mike Brown, the discoverer of Sedna and Eris, has said that at least 53 known bodies in the Solar System probably fit the definition, and that a complete survey would probably reveal more than 200.|$|E
5|$|A second Overmind {{is created}} in Brood War, formed from {{the merging of}} several cerebrates. <b>This</b> <b>second</b> Overmind never reaches full maturity, and thus lacks the power and {{intelligence}} of the original and is much weaker; attacks that were superficial to the first Overmind send the second into remission, although dark templar energies are still needed to kill it. The second Overmind is captured and drugged by the United Earth Directorate, who use its control of the Swarm to bolster its own forces in the Koprulu Sector, but it is ultimately slain by Zeratul.|$|E
5|$|Allen Lanier, Joe Bouchard and Donald Roeser contributed {{instrumental}} {{parts and}} backing vocals to the tracks as guests. These remain Lanier's and J. Bouchard's only contributions to Imaginos. Columbia Records' complaints about Albert Bouchard's lead vocals pushed him to finance multiple recordings with try-outs of singers, including Jon Rogers and Joey Cerisano, whose performances on some songs {{were used for}} the final mix of the album in 1988. The new recordings, overdubs by other uncredited musicians, and mixing lasted until 1984. Musicians involved in <b>this</b> <b>second</b> phase of recording included future BÖC keyboard player Tommy Zvoncheck, who had already played with Clarence Clemons, Public Image Ltd and The Dream Syndicate.|$|E
