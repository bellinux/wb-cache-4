5|$|In 2000, an {{estimated}} 45million people were {{infected with the}} beef tapeworm Taenia saginata and 3million with the pork tapeworm <b>Taenia</b> <b>solium.</b> Infection of the digestive system by adult tapeworms causes abdominal symptoms that are unpleasant but not disabling or life-threatening. However, neurocysticercosis resulting from penetration of T. solium larvae into {{the central nervous system}} is the major cause of acquired epilepsy worldwide. In 2000, about 39 million people were infected with trematodes (flukes) that naturally parasitize fish and crustaceans, but can pass to humans who eat raw or lightly cooked seafood. Infection of humans by the broad fish tapeworm Diphyllobothrium latum occasionally causes vitamin B12 deficiency and, in severe cases, megaloblastic anemia.|$|E
5|$|Over half of {{all known}} flatworm species are parasitic, and some do {{enormous}} harm to humans and their livestock. Schistosomiasis, caused by one genus of trematodes, is the second-most devastating of all human diseases caused by parasites, surpassed only by malaria. Neurocysticercosis, which arises when larvae of the pork tapeworm <b>Taenia</b> <b>solium</b> penetrate the central nervous system, is the major cause of acquired epilepsy worldwide. The threat of platyhelminth parasites to humans in developed countries is rising because of the popularity of raw or lightly cooked foods, and imports of food from high-risk areas. In less developed countries, people often cannot afford the fuel required to cook food thoroughly, and poorly designed water-supply and irrigation projects increase the dangers presented by poor sanitation and unhygienic farming.|$|E

40|$|By oral {{infestation}} in man, their definite host, {{the large}} <b>taenias</b> (T. <b>solium</b> and T. saginata) of the Taeniidae family, Cyclophyllidea order, Cestoidea class, may cause {{two different types}} of disease: teniasis and cysticercosis. Although infestation in these parasitic diseases always takes place by ingestion, the manifestations or localizations within the oral region are extremely rare and, therefore, are hardly ever mentioned in studies of oral pathology...|$|R
50|$|Humans were {{previously}} {{thought to have}} acquired <b>Taenia</b> species (T. <b>solium,</b> T. asiatica, and T. saginata) after the domestication of large mammals, although the omnivorous diet and foraging of early hominids suggest the contact between the ancestral Taenia was established prior {{to the rise of}} modern humans and advanced agriculture. Evidence suggests the domestication of animals by humans consequently introduced Taenia species to new intermediate hosts, cattle, and swine.|$|R
40|$|A {{neurotropism}} of helminths can {{be observed}} in their intermediate, paratenic and definitive hosts. Neurotropic helminths migrate through the nervous tissue, where maturation and reproduction can take place. The neurotropic helminths {{can be found in the}} family of trematodes (Diplostomum baeri, D. phoxini, Ornithodiplostomum ptychocheilus, Trichobilharzia regenti), cestodes (<b>Taenia</b> multiceps, T. <b>solium)</b> and nematodes (Angiostrongylus cantonensis, Elaphostrongylus cervi, Parelaphostronglus tenuis, Baylisascaris procyonis). Presence of these helminths in the nervous tissue can (usually with contribution of the immune system) lead to neurological or other pathological changes: the infected hosts can even die. Some of the neurotropic helminths (A. cantonensis, B. procyonis, T. solium, T. multiceps) can infect humans as well...|$|R
25|$|Wild boars {{are known}} to host at least 20 {{different}} parasitic worm species, with maximum infections occurring in summer. Young animals are vulnerable to helminths like Metastrongylus, which are consumed by boars through earthworms, and cause death by parasitising the lungs. Wild boar also carry parasites known to infect humans, including Gastrodiscoides, Trichinella spiralis, <b>Taenia</b> <b>solium,</b> and Balantidium coli. Wild boar in southern regions are frequently infested with ticks (Dermacentor, Rhipicephalus, and Hyalomma) and hog lice. The species also suffers from blood-sucking flies, which it escapes by bathing frequently or hiding in dense shrubs.|$|E
25|$|Major modern {{diseases}} such as Ebola virus disease and salmonellosis are zoonoses. HIV was a zoonotic disease transmitted to humans {{in the early part}} of the 20th century, though it has now evolved to a separate human-only disease. Most strains of influenza that infect humans are human diseases, although many strains of swine and bird flu are zoonoses; these viruses occasionally recombine with human strains of the flu and can cause pandemics such as the 1918 Spanish flu or the 2009 swine flu. <b>Taenia</b> <b>solium</b> infection is one of the neglected tropical diseases with public health and veterinary concern in endemic regions. Zoonoses can be caused by a range of disease pathogens such as viruses, bacteria, fungi and parasites; of 1,415 pathogens known to infect humans, 61% were zoonotic. Most human diseases originated in animals; however, only diseases that routinely involve animal to human transmission, like rabies, are considered direct zoonosis.|$|E

40|$|Objective: Challenging {{differential}} diagnosis Background: Neurocysticercosis is a brain infection {{caused by the}} larval stage of the tapeworm <b>Taenia</b> (T.) <b>solium.</b> It {{is the most important}} parasitic disease of the human central nervous system and represents {{the most common cause of}} acquired epilepsy in developing countries. Case Report: Here, we report the case of a 23 -year-old Chinese man who presented to the emergency department with a 7 -day history of helmet headache radiating to the nuchal region and associated with vomiting, confusion, and fever. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was clear, with increased pressure, lymphocytic pleocytosis, decreased glucose, and increased protein levels. Bacterial antigen detection test on CSF was negative, as were CSF bacterial and fungal cultures. Despite broad-spectrum antibiotic and antiviral therapy, the patient still complained of insom-nia, diplopia, headache, neck stiffness, and pain in the sacral region. A second LP was performed and CSF had the same characteristics as the first LP. A brain and spinal cord MRI revealed widespread arachnoiditis and small septated cysts with CSF-like signal in the cisterna magna, within the fourth ventricle, and at the level of L 3 –L 4. Cysticercus-specific immunoglobin G antibodies were detected by ELISA in the CSF. The patient received albendazole (15 mg/kg/day) and dexamethasone (5 mg/day) for 4 weeks, with progressive resolution of neu-rological symptoms...|$|R
40|$|The {{tapeworm}} <b>Taenia</b> (T.) <b>solium</b> can {{be responsible}} for two different conditions: taeniasis and cysticercosis. Helminth infections in human host cause an immune response associated with elevated levels of IgE, tissue eosinophilia and mastocytosis, and {{with the presence of}} CD 4 + T cells that preferentially produce IL- 4, IL- 5, and IL- 13. Individuals exposed to helminth infections may have allergic inflammatory responses to parasites and parasite antigens. PubMed search of human cases of allergic reactions occurring during T. solium infestation was performed combining the terms (allergy, urticaria, angioedema, asthma, anaphylaxis) with T. solium. A study was considered eligible for inclusion in the review if it reported data on patients with T. solium infestation who had signs or symptoms of allergy. In literature we found six articles reporting the association between an allergic reaction and T. solium infestation: two cases of urticaria, two cases of relapsing angioedema, one case of asthma and two cases of anaphylaxis. Despite the large diffusion of T. solium infestation, we found only a few cases of concomitant allergic reaction and the presence of Taenia in the host. The association between T. solium infestation and allergic manifestations has never been clearly demonstrated, and in absence of a well-documented causality the hypotheses are merely speculative. Therefore, the association between Taenia infection and allergy needs to be thoroughly studied to better clarify if this association may really exist and which is the pathogenetic mechanism supported...|$|R
40|$|<b>Taenia</b> saginata, T. <b>solium,</b> and T. asiatica are causative {{agents of}} {{taeniasis}} in humans. The difficulty of morphological identification of human taeniids {{can lead to}} misdiagnosis or confusion. To overcome this problem, several molecular methods have been developed, but use of these tends to be time-consuming. Here, a rapid and high-throughput pyrosequencing approach was developed for the identification of three human taeniids originating from various countries. Primers targeting the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (cox 1) gene of the three Taenia species were designed. Variations in a 26 -nucleotide target region were used for identification. The reproducibility and accuracy of the pyrosequencing technology was confirmed by Sanger sequencing. This technique will be a valuable tool to distinguish between sympatric human taeniids that occur in Thailand, Asia and Pacific countries. This method could potentially {{be used for the}} molecular identification of the taeniid species that might be associated with suspicious cysts and lesions, or cys...|$|R
2500|$|Pigs can harbour a {{range of}} parasites and {{diseases}} that can be transmitted to humans. These include trichinosis, <b>Taenia</b> <b>solium,</b> cysticercosis, and brucellosis. Pigs are also known to host large concentrations of parasitic ascarid worms in their digestive tract. According to the USDA fact sheet modern pork can be enjoyed cooked rare at 145°F (63°C) with pink in the middle. Today trichinellosis infections from eating undercooked pork are rare in more technologically developed countries due to refrigeration, health laws, and public awareness. Some religious groups have dietary laws that make pork an [...] "unclean" [...] meat, and adherents sometimes interpret these health issues as validation of their views.|$|E
2500|$|Parasites cause EP {{in three}} {{different}} ways. Parasites can either invade the lung, live in the lung {{as part of their}} life cycle, or be spread to the lung by the bloodstream. Eosinophils migrate to the lung in order to fight the parasites and EP results. Important parasites which invade the lung include Paragonimus lung flukes and the tapeworms Echinococcus and <b>Taenia</b> <b>solium.</b> Important parasites which inhabit the lung as part of their normal life cycle include the worms (helminths) Ascaris lumbricoides, Strongyloides stercoralis and the hookworms Ancylostoma duodenale and Necator americanus. When EP is caused by this last group, it is often called [...] "Löffler's syndrome". The final group of parasites cause EP when a large number of eggs are carried into the lungs by the bloodstream. This can include Trichinella spiralis, Strongyloides stercoralis, Ascaris lumbricoides, the hookworms, and the schistosomes.|$|E

40|$|All helminths {{parasitosis}} {{transmitted to}} humans trough ingestion of infested fleshes, where man is definitive host too, {{are represented by}} four groups of helminths: the cestodes Dyphyllobothrium spp and Spirometra spp. (Sparganum proliferum {{is the name of}} the immature plerocercoid larva), the trematodes Opisthorchis Clonorchis “group” (many could be the genera and species involved), and the nematode Capillaria philippinensis. So, for fishes humans foods (fresh or salted water) the control and prevention in veterinary health must be directed to investigation regarding intermediate stages of these parasites in fishes for human alimentation; if present, they must be eliminated. The helminths parasitosis transmitted to humans trough ingestion of infected mammals meats, are represented by taeniasis (<b>Taenia</b> saginata, T. <b>solium</b> and T. saginata asiatica), where man id definitive host and the infection is caused by ingestion of bovine or swine meat, containing larvae of these cestodes, and by trichinellosis, where humans represent a intermediate stage, and the eventual pathology is caused as by adult (acute infection) as by larvae (chronic infection) of this nematode: usually the meats responsible are infected pork, wild pork or horse (Trichinella spp. Is inside the meats of these animals). So the veterinary control and prophylaxis are necessary to avoid this disease and preventing the infection that could be severe...|$|R
40|$|Zoonotic parasites are animal parasites {{that can}} infect humans. The major {{zoonotic}} protozoa in the Republic of Korea are Babesia bovis, Chilomastix mesnili, Cryptosporidium parvum, Endolimax nana, Entamoeba coli, Entamoeba hitolytica, Giardia lamblia, Iodamoeba bütschlii, Pneumocystis carinii, Sarcocystis cruzi, and Toxoplasma gondii. The major zoonotic helminths in Korea include trematodes, cestodes, and nematodes. Trematodes are Clonorchis sinensis, Echinostoma hortense, Echinostoma spp., Fasciola hepatica, Heterophyes nocens, Metagonimus yokogawai, and Paragonimus westermani. Cestodes are Diphyllobothrium latum, Dipylidium caninum, Echinococcus granulosus, Hymenolepis nana, Raillietina tetragona, sparganum (Spirometra spp.), <b>Taenia</b> saginata, T. <b>solium,</b> and T. asiatica.

Neurocysticercosis most commonly involves the cerebral cortex followed by the cerebellum. The pituitary gland is very rarely involved in neurocysticercosis.

5000|$|Cysticercus was {{discovered}} in the late 17th century CE as a parasitic bladder. It {{was believed to be}} a different organism from the adult tapeworm (<b>Taenia</b> <b>solium),</b> but still closely related to tapeworms for their similarly-looking scolex. Hence, it was given a proper scientific name Taenia cellulosae in 1800 by German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin. At the same time another German Johann Zeder had created a new genus Cysticercosis for a dog tapeworm. This genus was accepted for all bladder worms of Taenia. It became a tradition to refer to the larva of <b>Taenia</b> <b>solium</b> as Cysticercus cellulosae, that of beef tapeworm (T. sanginata) as Cysticercus bovis, that of sheep tapeworm (T. ovis) as Cysticercus ovis, that of ruminant tapeworm (T. krabbei) as Cysticercus tarandi, and that of the dog tapeworm (T. crassiceps) as Cysticercus longicollis. Even though, this system of naming is now scientifically unacceptable, it is still widely used, particularly for description of the infections by the different species.|$|E
50|$|In pigs {{cysticercus}} has {{a tendency}} to produce cyticercosis. Cysts are formed in vital organs such as liver and lungs. In contrast T. saginata does not cause cysticercosis.
