5|$|Astronomy and {{astrophysics}} {{have developed}} significant interdisciplinary links with other major scientific fields. Archaeoastronomy {{is the study}} of ancient or traditional astronomies in their cultural context, utilizing archaeological and anthropological evidence. Astrobiology {{is the study of}} the advent and evolution of biological systems in the Universe, with particular emphasis on the possibility of non-terrestrial life. Astrostatistics is the application of statistics to astrophysics <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> vast amount of observational astrophysical data.|$|E
5|$|The {{efficient}} industrial-scale {{deconstruction of}} biomass requires novel enzymes with higher productivity and lower cost. Metagenomic approaches <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> complex microbial communities allow the targeted screening of enzymes with industrial applications in biofuel production, such as glycoside hydrolases. Furthermore, {{knowledge of how}} these microbial communities function is required to control them, and metagenomics is a key tool in their understanding. Metagenomic approaches allow comparative analyses between convergent microbial systems like biogas fermenters or insect herbivores such as the fungus garden of the leafcutter ants.|$|E
5|$|Wind {{engineering}} {{is a field}} of engineering devoted <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> wind effects on the natural and built environment. It includes strong winds which may cause discomfort as well as extreme winds such as tornadoes, hurricanes and storms which may cause widespread destruction. Wind engineering draws upon meteorology, aerodynamics {{and a number of}} specialist engineering disciplines. The tools used include climate models, atmospheric boundary layer wind tunnels and numerical models. It involves, among other topics, how wind impacting buildings must be accounted for in engineering.|$|E

25|$|Before 1748 and the {{publication}} of Introduction <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Analysis</b> <b>of</b> the Infinite, the natural logarithm was known {{in terms of the}} area of a hyperbolic sector. Leonhard Euler changed that when he introduced transcendental functions such as 10x. Euler identified e as the value of b producing a unit of area (under the hyperbola or in a hyperbolic sector in standard position). Then the natural logarithm could be recognized as the inverse function to the transcendental function ex.|$|E

This approach may be applied <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> correctness of parallel and distributed programs. The Distributed Computer Network (DCN) research group at Saint Petersburg Technical University developed such a software system for the analysis of program correctness; the new tool was named COVERS (Concurrent Verification and Simulation). This system allowed graphical modeling notation for system structure and behavior. The tool was applied for the research granted by Hewlett Packard.|$|E
25|$|Because the {{conclusion}} was unknown, {{the first generation}} proof consists of many stand-alone theorems, dealing with important special cases. Much {{of the work of}} proving these theorems was devoted <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> numerous special cases. Given a larger, orchestrated proof, dealing with many of these special cases can be postponed until the most powerful assumptions can be applied. The price paid under this revised strategy is that these first generation theorems no longer have comparatively short proofs, but instead rely on the complete classification.|$|E

25|$|A {{hyperbolic}} {{angle is}} an argument of a hyperbolic function just as the circular angle is the argument of a circular function. The comparison can be visualized as {{the size of the}} openings of a hyperbolic sector and a circular sector since the areas of these sectors correspond to the angle magnitudes in each case. Unlike the circular angle, the hyperbolic angle is unbounded. When the circular and hyperbolic functions are viewed as infinite series in their angle argument, the circular ones are just alternating series forms of the hyperbolic functions. This weaving of the two types of angle and function was explained by Leonhard Euler in Introduction <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Analysis</b> <b>of</b> the Infinite.|$|E
25|$|A widely {{accepted}} source-modeling technique for MEG involves calculating {{a set of}} equivalent current dipoles (ECDs), which assumes the underlying neuronal sources to be focal. This dipole fitting procedure is non-linear and over-determined, since the number of unknown dipole parameters is smaller {{than the number of}} MEG measurements. Automated multiple dipole model algorithms such as multiple signal classification (MUSIC) and MSST (MultiStart Spatial and Temporal) modeling are applied <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> MEG responses. The limitations of dipole models for characterizing neuronal responses are (1) difficulties in localizing extended sources with ECDs, (2) problems with accurately estimating the total number of dipoles in advance, and (3) dependency on dipole location, especially depth in the brain.|$|E
