5|$|By World War I, most of {{the ships}} had been {{withdrawn}} to secondary roles, with Elba having {{been converted into a}} seaplane tender. Puglia was {{the only member of the}} class to <b>take</b> <b>an</b> <b>active</b> role, based out of Durazzo. Etruria was deliberately blown up by the Regia Marina as a deception operation against Austria-Hungary. The remaining ships were broken up for scrap in the early 1920s, though the bow section of Puglia was preserved at the Vittoriale degli italiani museum.|$|E
5|$|Cagney became {{president}} of the Screen Actors Guild in 1942 for a two-year term. He took a role in the Guild's fight against the Mafia, which had begun to <b>take</b> <b>an</b> <b>active</b> interest in the movie industry. His wife, Billie Vernon, once received a phone call telling her that Cagney was dead. Cagney alleged that, having failed to scare off the Guild and him, they sent a hitman to kill him by dropping a heavy light onto his head. Upon hearing of the rumor of a hit, George Raft made a call, and the hit was supposedly canceled.|$|E

5|$|In 1842 {{the leaders}} of the Society of Friends, the Quaker group to which Coffin belonged, advised their members to cease {{membership}} in abolitionist societies and end activities assisting runaway slaves. The leaders insisted that legal emancipation was the best course of action. Coffin continued to <b>take</b> <b>an</b> <b>active</b> role in assisting escaping slaves and the following year the Quaker society expelled him from membership. Coffin and other Quakers who supported his activities separated and formed the Antislavery Friends; the two rival groups remained separate until a reunification occurred in 1851.|$|E
5|$|In 1886, Malone married Elinor Lucy (née Penn). The couple would {{eventually}} have five children, {{a daughter and}} four sons.

He {{was a member of}} the Hawera County Council as well as the Taranaki Hospital and Charitable Aid Board. From 1890, in addition to his farming, Malone also worked as a land agent. Later, he helped found the Stratford County Council and served as its first clerk and treasurer from 1891 to 1900.|$|E

5|$|After the show, {{the song}} {{went on to}} chart in several European countries, {{reaching}} number one in Austria and the UK Indie Chart, as well as reaching the top 10 in a further 10 countries. Wurst's appearance in the contest brought about both criticism and praise: {{by some of the}} more socially conservative sections of European society her victory in the contest was condemned as a promotion of LGBT rights; conversely the international attention received by Wurst's victory firmly established her among the LGBT community, leading her to <b>take</b> <b>an</b> <b>active</b> role in promoting tolerance and respect, and resulted in several invites to perform at several European pride events, as well as performances at the European Parliament and United Nations Office at Vienna.|$|E
5|$|Both vessels were {{involved}} in the operations off Lissa in July 1866, but neither took part in the Battle of Lissa on 20 July. Formidabile had been damaged by Austrian coastal fortifications the day before, and had withdrawn for repairs; Terribile was ready for action, but had been preparing to attack Lissa and was too far south to <b>take</b> <b>an</b> <b>active</b> role in the battle. Both ships saw minimal use in the 1870s and 1880s, until both were withdrawn from service for use as training ships. Formidabile and Terribile served in this capacity until 1903 and 1904, respectively, when they were sold and broken up for scrap.|$|E
5|$|Control of {{the canal}} passed into public {{ownership}} with the Transport Act 1947. Despite concerted efforts, the Conservators could not make any progress with {{the removal of the}} fixed low-level bridges, which prevented maintenance from being carried out. The Inland Waterways Association started to <b>take</b> <b>an</b> <b>active</b> interest in the restoration {{of the canal}} from 1952, but this was resisted by the British Transport Commission, who padlocked the lock gates to prevent them being used. Despite this, a team of seven men was employed to maintain the infrastructure through this period. The maintenance of the channel enabled the canal {{to become one of the}} first to be used for the commercial transport of water, which was pumped from the canal to Durleigh reservoir from 1962 onwards.|$|E

5|$|Although Jones took {{no part in}} {{the raising}} of his {{children}} by Tuhbenahneequay, he did <b>take</b> <b>an</b> <b>active</b> interest in their welfare. In 1805, he secured a pair of two-square-mile plots of land {{near the mouth of}} the Credit River for his two sons from the local Mississauga Indians, but the government of Upper Canada would not recognise the title. In 1816, Jones feared that the Mississauga band his sons John and Peter lived with would fall apart, {{in the aftermath of the}} War of 1812, the famine of 1816's harvest and the influx of settlers to the area in recent years. Jones travelled to find the boys, and brought them to his farm in Stoney Creek. He arranged for the boys to be schooled in Stoney Creek, as neither spoke much English. After nine months, Jones felt that Peter's command of English was sufficient, and took him out of school to teach him the farming craft. The next year, Jones and his family relocated to land along the Grand River, and Jones brought his son Peter with them. Peter lived with his father for seven years there.|$|E
5|$|Due to ill health, Blackburn {{could not}} <b>take</b> <b>an</b> <b>active</b> {{part in the}} {{campaign}}. He sought relief from his ailments at Crab Orchard Springs, {{while much of the}} campaign oratory was delivered on his behalf by fellow Democrats Boyd Winchester, Parker Watkins Hardin, W. C. P. Breckinridge, and others. Republicans, who had nominated Walter Evans, had fewer speakers with which to canvass the state, and were at a decided disadvantage. Democrats attacked the administrations of Republican Presidents Ulysses S. Grant and Rutherford B. Hayes, cited the alleged abuses perpetrated in the South by Carpetbaggers and Scalawags, and leveled charges that Republicans favored capitalists over the state's working class. Republican orators, led by William O'Connell Bradley, charged Democrats with financial extravagance, citing a $3million surplus in the state treasury in 1865 compared with a $1million debt in 1878. Bradley claimed that Democrats had maintained their power in the state through gerrymandering election districts. He cited poor conditions at the state penitentiary and inadequate funding of public education as evidence of Democratic mismanagement of the state.|$|E

5|$|In 1914 Elba was {{converted}} {{into the first}} dedicated seaplane tender in the Italian fleet. She was nevertheless {{too small to be}} of real use, and she remained in service for only two years. Puglia was the only ship of the class to <b>take</b> <b>an</b> <b>active</b> role in the First World War; in 1915, while patrolling off Durazzo she briefly encountered the Austro-Hungarian cruiser , which retreated before either ship could open fire. She covered the withdrawal of elements of the Serbian Army from Durazzo and shelled the pursuing Austro-Hungarian Army. Etruria was deliberately blown up in Livorno on 13 August 1918 to fool Austria-Hungary into believing its espionage network, which had been thoroughly compromised, was still operational. Elba was sold for scrapping in January 1920, followed by her sister Lombardia in July. That month, Puglia became involved in the civil unrest in Split, and the ship's captain and another sailor were murdered by a group of Croat nationalists. Liguria was sold in May 1921 and broken up. The Navy sold Puglia in March 1923, but while she was being dismantled Benito Mussolini donated her bow section to the Vittoriale degli italiani museum.|$|E
5|$|The War of Chioggia erupted {{between the}} old-time rival Republics of Venice and Genoa in 1378, and it soon {{involved}} Venice's neighbours. King Louis took Genoa's side; and Ragusa—subordinate to Hungary, and Venice's competitor in the Adriatic—did so as well. The Venetians, having taken Kotor in August 1378, {{made an effort}} to have Tvrtko join the war on their side, which caused panic in Ragusa. Tvrtko, however, offered the Ragusans help in fighting Venice, which they initially refused. The death of George I of Zeta warranted Tvrtko's involvement in Serbian affairs, which reduced his ability to <b>take</b> <b>an</b> <b>active</b> part in the conflict. The Ragusans started calling for the destruction of Kotor, whose officials promised to renounce fealty to Venice and return to Louis. Kotor failed to fulfill this promise, but instead promised fealty to Tvrtko, who laid claim to the city as part of his Nemanjić ancestors' heritage. The political climate was ideal, since he was to take Kotor from his overlord's enemy. The Ragusans were furious, and an embargo ensued. Tvrtko defended Kotor from Ragusa, but was betrayed in June 1379, when the city overthrew its Venetian governor and submitted again directly to Louis.|$|E
