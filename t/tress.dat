50|$|The genus Spiranthes {{contains}} about forty species, {{most of which}} are from North America. Some species are found in Central and South America, in temperate and tropical Asia southward to Australia and New Zealand. In Europe, three species occur in the wild. Besides the autumn lady's <b>tresses,</b> these are the summer lady's <b>tresses</b> S. aestivalis, and the Irish lady's <b>tresses</b> S. romanzoffiana, a mainly North American species that also occurs in Ireland and western Scotland. The autumn lady's <b>tresses</b> is easily distinguished because the two other species of previously have inflorescences that occur earlier during the year (May-July) from a living rosette, with lanceolate leaves rising at an angle and having cream-colored instead of greenish or greyish white flowers. The autumn lady's <b>tresses</b> also resembles the evergreen Goodyera repens (creeping lady's-tresses or dwarf rattlesnake plantain), which has a creeping rhizome rather than tubers. The inflorescence emerges from the centre of a rosette of ovate leaves with a pointed tip, and has striking perpendicular connective veins. The flowers are covered in long hairs that are often tipped with tiny droplets.|$|R
