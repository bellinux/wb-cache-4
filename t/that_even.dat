5|$|A {{capacity}} for aggressive behavior {{should not be}} overstated with the giant otter. Researchers emphasize <b>that</b> <b>even</b> between groups, conflict avoidance is generally adopted.

5|$|A {{number of}} {{designs for the}} energy being were {{considered}} for this episode; however, the final version was decided upon due to a desire to keep the design simple.

5|$|After {{the battle}} the Grand Vizier forged bulletins in the Sultan's name, proclaiming victory. These {{announced}} that the Sultan regretted that his current state of health prevented him from continuing with the successful campaign. His body was returned to Constantinople while the inner circle of officials pretended to keep up communication with him. Turkish sources state that the illusion was maintained for three weeks and <b>that</b> <b>even</b> the Sultan's personal physician was strangled as a precaution.|$|E

5|$|Afterward, Bond {{admits to}} his spotter {{that he did}} not try for a kill shot only because Trigger had been a woman. He muses <b>that</b> <b>even</b> though 272 is safe, the mission will be {{considered}} a failure because he did not kill Trigger, and he hopes that M will fire him for it.|$|E
5|$|All of the aircrew {{involved}} in the crash had only limited flying time {{in the months before}} the crash. The B-52's aircrew were apparently unaware that the aircraft had stalled until shortly before impact, indicated by a failure to apply standard recovery techniques to the aircraft once it entered the stall. The investigation reported <b>that,</b> <b>even</b> if the proper stall recovery techniques had been applied, the aircraft was likely too low to recover before hitting the ground.|$|E
5|$|Although Sandra Panem in {{the journal}} Science praised Shilts' efforts and the {{attention}} the book brought to AIDS, she criticized his simplistic interpretation of science and the ways research is fostered and accomplished in the U.S. Panem furthermore believes Shilts gives appropriate weight {{to the issue of}} homophobia hampering attention on the disease, but remarks <b>that</b> <b>even</b> if AIDS had struck a more socially acceptable group of people, similar delays and confusion would have slowed medical progress.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{creation}} of literature was predominantly a male scribal pursuit, some works {{are thought to have}} been written by women.

5|$|But they {{overlooked}} that inexpensive aspirin {{had become}} available in India {{and other places}} after October 1918, when the Bayer patent expired. In responding, Starko pointed to anecdotal evidence of aspirin use in India and argued <b>that</b> <b>even</b> if aspirin over-prescription had not contributed to the high Indian mortality rate, it could still have been a factor for other high rates in areas where other exacerbating factors present in India played less of a role.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though the}} cost of {{building}} TCF Bank Stadium originated at $248.7 million, changes in the construction planning raised the cost to $288.5 million.

5|$|Freitas {{considers}} <b>that</b> <b>even</b> if an extraterrestrial being {{were to be}} afforded legal personhood, {{problems of}} nationality and immigration would arise. An extraterrestrial being {{would not have a}} legally recognized earthly citizenship, and drastic legal measures might be required in order to account for the technically illegal immigration of extraterrestrial individuals.|$|E
5|$|General {{relativity}} {{has developed}} into an essential tool in modern astrophysics. It provides {{the foundation for}} the current understanding of black holes, regions of space where the gravitational effect is so strong <b>that</b> <b>even</b> light cannot escape. Their strong gravity is thought to be responsible for the intense radiation emitted by certain types of astronomical objects (such as active galactic nuclei or microquasars). General relativity is also part of the framework of the standard Big Bang model of cosmology.|$|E
5|$|If a human {{watched the}} dance of the elves, he would {{discover}} <b>that</b> <b>even</b> though {{only a few hours}} seemed to have passed, many years had passed in the real world.

Criminal charges were not filed.|$|E
5|$|In January 2014, Knut's full autopsy {{results were}} {{published}} by the Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research in the Journal of Comparative Pathology. It was the most in-depth post-mortem ever carried out on an animal. The autopsy revealed that {{the damage to the}} bearâ€™s brain was so severe <b>that</b> <b>even</b> if he had not fallen into the water and drowned he would have died anyway. Experts hypothesized that he was suffering from a virus that caused the encephalitis.|$|E
