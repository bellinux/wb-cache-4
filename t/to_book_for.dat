An {{advertisement}} costing £500 (2011:£) was placed in the Daily Express, announcing the opening of the camp and inviting the public <b>to</b> <b>book</b> <b>for</b> a week's holiday. The advertisement offered holidays with three meals a day and free entertainment with a week's full board, at a cost of between 35shillings (£1.75) and £3 (2011:£), according to the time of year. The advert proved successful, and over the first summer season the capacity of the camp had to be increased from 500 to 2,000, to cope with the demand.|$|E
5|$|He {{opened his}} first Butlin's camp at Ingoldmells, near Skegness, on 11 April 1936 (Easter eve). It was officially opened by Amy Johnson, {{the first woman}} to fly solo from England to Australia. An {{advertisement}} costing £500 (2011:£) was placed in the Daily Express, announced the opening of the camp, inviting the public <b>to</b> <b>book</b> <b>for</b> a week's holiday. The advertisement offered holidays with three meals a day and free entertainment with a week's full board cost anything from 35 shillings to £3 (2011:£), according to the time of year. When the camp opened, Butlin realised that his guests were not engaging with activities in the way he had planned; most kept to themselves, and others looked bored. He asked Norman Bradford (who was engaged as an engineer constructing the camp) to take on the duty of entertaining the guests, which he did with a series of ice breakers and jokes. By {{the end of the night}} the camp was buzzing and the Butlin's atmosphere was born. From that point on, entertainment was the very heart of Butlins and Bradford became the first of the Butlin's Redcoats. The same night Butlin decided that for his camp to work he would require many more people to carry out the same job as Bradford, and the role of Redcoat was conceived.|$|E

60|$|It was a wry-necked {{matter of}} {{unauthorized}} and incendiary correspondence between {{a person who}} claimed to be the ultimate authority in all matters of the Mohammedan religion throughout the world, and a younger member of a royal house who had been brought <b>to</b> <b>book</b> <b>for</b> kidnapping women within British territory. The Moslem Archbishop had been emphatic and over-arrogant; the young prince was merely sulky at the curtailment of his privileges, but there was no need he should continue a correspondence which might some day compromise him. One letter indeed had been procured, but the finder was later found dead by the roadside in the habit of an Arab trader, as E.23, taking up the work, duly reported.|$|E
60|$|The old {{fellow who}} told that story of dream-transference on a sleeping-car at Christmas-time was {{again at the}} club on Easter Eve. Halson had put him up for the winter, under the easy rule we had, and he had taken very {{naturally}} to the Turkish room for his after-dinner coffee and cigar. We all rather liked him, though it was Minver's pose {{to be critical of}} the simple friendliness with which he made himself at home among us, and to feign a wish that there were fewer trains between Boston and New York, so that old Newton (that was his name) could {{have a better chance of}} staying away. But we noticed that Minver was always a willing listener to Newton's talk, and that he sometimes hospitably offered to share his tobacco with the Bostonian. When brought <b>to</b> <b>book</b> <b>for</b> his inconsistency by Rulledge, he said he was merely welcoming the new blood, if not young blood, that Newton was infusing into our body, which had grown anaemic on Wanhope's psychology and Rulledge's romance; or, anyway, it was a change.|$|E
6000|$|It {{must not}} be {{supposed}} that Job Dowling, who held {{a good deal of}} money in trust for the boys, had allowed them to run off without making an effort to bring them back. Larry was out of his reach, but Ben and Walter were not, and the miserly man had descended upon Ben in New York and tried his best to [...] "make things warm," [...] as Ben had mentioned in a letter to Larry. But Job Dowling had overreached himself by attempting to sell a watch and some jewelry which had belonged originally to Mr. and Mrs. Russell, heirlooms which were not to be disposed of under any circumstances. On his trip to New York after Ben, the articles had been stolen from him at the Post-office--something that had so frightened Job Dowling that he had consented to Ben's enlisting in the army with scarcely a murmur, fearful the youth might otherwise have him brought <b>to</b> <b>book</b> <b>for</b> what had happened. A vigorous search had been made for the thief, but he was not found. Later on, when Ben was in the army, Job Dowling received information that caused him to reach the conclusion that the thief had gone to Boston. The miserly guardian of the boys returned to his home in Buffalo and, as much worried as ever, wrote to Walter to keep an eye open for the missing property. Walter did as requested, but in such a large place as the Hub the youth had little hope of ever seeing the precious heirlooms again.|$|E
