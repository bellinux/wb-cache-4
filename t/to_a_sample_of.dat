25|$|In March 2002, {{more than}} nine years after the murders, Anne Lockett came forward and implicated her former boyfriend, James Degorski, and his associate, Juan Luna, in the crime. Luna was a former {{employee}} of the restaurant. In April 2002, the Palatine Police Department matched a DNA sample from Luna <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>sample</b> <b>of</b> saliva from a piece of partially eaten chicken found in the garbage during the crime scene investigation. The chicken was kept in a freezer {{for most of the}} time since the crime; testimony at trial indicated it was not frozen for several days after discovery, and was allowed to thaw several times for examination and testing, in the hope of an eventual match via increasingly sophisticated testing methods not available in 1993.|$|E
25|$|Research {{performed}} in 2015 by the UCLA Luskin Center for Innovation found {{that access to}} HOV lanes has {{a significant impact on}} plug-in car sales. Researchers linked automobile sales <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>sample</b> <b>of</b> more than 7,000 of the 8,057 census tracts in California for the study, including Los Angeles, Sacramento, San Diego and San Francisco. The study concluded that the ability to use potentially time-saving HOV lanes prompted the purchase of more than 24,000 plug-in electric cars and hybrids in the four urban areas from 2010 to 2013, or about 40% of the total of such vehicles. The UCLA researcher concluded that without the policy giving plug-in vehicles access to HOV lanes, total plug-in sales in the same study areas would have been only 36,692 for the three-year period.|$|E

500|$|Any {{addition}} of carbon <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>sample</b> <b>of</b> a different age {{will cause the}} measured date to be inaccurate. Contamination with modern carbon causes a sample {{to appear to be}} younger than it really is: the effect is greater for older samples. If a sample that is 17,000 years old is contaminated so that 1% of the sample is modern carbon, it will appear to be 600 years younger; for a sample that is 34,000 years old the same amount of contamination would cause an error of 4,000 years. Contamination with old carbon, with no remaining , causes an error in the other direction [...] independent of age– a sample contaminated with 1% old carbon will appear to be about 80 years older than it really is, regardless of the date of the sample.|$|E

2500|$|Work by Fairclough, Dayel and King {{suggests}} that S. Rosetta can exist in either single-cellular form or in colonies of 4-50 cells, which arrange themselves in tight knit packs of spheres. This {{was established by}} performing an experiment involving the introduction of prey bacterium Algoriphagus species <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>sample</b> <b>of</b> uni-celled S. Rosetta organism and monitored the activity for 12 hours. [...] Results of this study demonstrated that cell colonies were formed through cell-division of the initial solitary S. Rosetta cell rather than by cell aggregation. Further studies to support the theory of cell-proliferation were done by introducing then removing the drug aphidicolin which serves to block cell-division. When the drug was introduced, cell division stopped and colony formation resulted through cell-cell aggregation. When the drug was removed, cell-division dominated once again ...|$|E

2500|$|Two {{studies have}} tested the {{possibility}} that cisgender women can also experience autogynephilia. Veale and colleagues (2008) found that an online sample of cisgender women commonly endorsed items on adapted versions of Blanchard's autogynephilia scales. Moser (2009) created an Autogynephilia Scale for Women based on items used to categorize MtF transsexuals as autogynephilic in other studies. A questionnaire that included the ASW was distributed <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>sample</b> <b>of</b> 51 professional women employed at an urban hospital; 29 completed questionnaires were returned for analysis. By the common definition of ever having erotic arousal to the thought or image of oneself as a woman, 93% of the respondents would be classified as autogynephilic. Using a more rigorous definition of [...] "frequent" [...] arousal to multiple items, 28% would be classified as autogynephilic. However, Anne Lawrence criticized these studies' methodology and conclusions and asserted that genuine autogynephilia occurs very rarely, if ever, in natal women.|$|E
