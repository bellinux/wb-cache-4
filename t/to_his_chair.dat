5|$|In 1864, Ewing {{suffered}} {{an attack of}} rheumatism, and received treatment several times thereafter, often being confined <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair.</b> He was likely prostrated with illness as Commander of Louisville during Burbridge's madness in Kentucky. He was made a brevet major general on March 13, 1865. After leaving the Army, he experienced painful attacks {{for the rest of}} his life, often bedridden for periods of up to forty days.|$|E
25|$|Much {{the same}} as motor cars nowadays, private chairs existed, and were an {{important}} marker of a person's status. A Civil officer's status was denoted {{by the number of}} bearers attached <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair.</b>|$|E
25|$|May 1996: Marcus Omofuma, an Illegal Nigerian immigrant, {{was being}} {{deported}} from Vienna when the officers taped him <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair</b> 'like a mummy' and stuck tape over his mouth. He suffocated whilst in police custody.|$|E

25|$|Around 1912, {{while visiting}} Florence, Italy, Stere began a long extra-marital {{relationship}} with Ana Radovici, {{the widow of}} Ion Radovici (the latter had committed suicide in 1909). No longer elected to the Chamber in the 1912 suffrage, he returned <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair</b> at the Iași University. During the electoral campaign, reelected leader of the Liberal club, he was again attacked by Evenimentul, and, having taken part in denouncing A. C. Cuza for plagiarism, clashed with his supporters (who briefly occupied the PNL headquarters in Iași in May).|$|E
25|$|The London University {{was a new}} institution, and the {{relations}} of the Council of management, the Senate of professors and the body of students were not well defined. A dispute arose between the professor of anatomy and his students, and in consequence of the action taken by the Council, several professors resigned, headed by De Morgan. Another professor of mathematics was appointed, who then drowned a few years later. De Morgan had shown himself a prince of teachers: {{he was invited to}} return <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair,</b> which thereafter became the continuous centre of his labours for thirty years.|$|E
25|$|F. L. Lucas {{lived at}} 7 Camden Place, Cambridge, from 1921–25; at 20 West Road, Cambridge from 1925–39 and from 1945–67; and at High Mead, Great Brickhill from 1939–45. The {{dissident}} Czech academic Otakar Vočadlo (1895–1974), Lucas's Prague correspondent in 1938-39 (see Appeasement below) and {{a concentration camp}} survivor, celebrated his restoration, during the Prague Spring of 1968, <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>Chair</b> of English at Prague, by giving a course of lectures on Webster in memory of Lucas, who had died the year before and whose support for the Czech cause in 1938–39 had not been forgotten.|$|E
60|$|Arnold lingered behind while Sabatini showed <b>his</b> guests <b>to</b> the door. When he, too, {{would have}} left, however, his host motioned him <b>to</b> resume <b>his</b> <b>chair.</b>|$|R

25|$|In January 1906, Eddington was {{nominated}} {{to the post}} of chief assistant to the Astronomer Royal at the Royal Greenwich Observatory. He left Cambridge for Greenwich the following month. He was put {{to work on a}} detailed analysis of the parallax of 433 Eros on photographic plates that had started in 1900. He developed a new statistical method based on the apparent drift of two background stars, winning him the Smith's Prize in 1907. The prize won him a Fellowship of Trinity College, Cambridge. In December 1912 George Darwin, son of Charles Darwin, died suddenly and Eddington was promoted <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair</b> as the Plumian Professor of Astronomy and Experimental Philosophy in early 1913. Later that year, Robert Ball, holder of the theoretical Lowndean chair also died, and Eddington was named the director of the entire Cambridge Observatory the next year. In May 1914 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society and won their Royal Medal in 1918 and delivered their Bakerian Lecture in 1926.|$|E
2500|$|On November 25, 1970, Mishima {{and four}} members of the Tatenokai, under pretext, visited the commandant of the Ichigaya Camp, the Tokyo {{headquarters}} of the Eastern Command of the Japan Self-Defense Forces. Inside, they barricaded the office and tied the commandant <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair.</b> With a prepared manifesto and a banner listing their demands, Mishima stepped onto the balcony to address the soldiers gathered below. His speech was intended to inspire a coup d'état to restore the power of the emperor. He succeeded only in irritating the soldiers, and was mocked and jeered. He finished his planned speech after a few minutes, returned to the commandant's office and committed seppuku. The assisting kaishakunin duty {{at the end of this}} ritual (to decapitate Mishima) had been assigned to Tatenokai member Masakatsu Morita, who was unable to properly perform the task. After several failed attempts at severing Mishima's head, he allowed another Tatenokai member, Hiroyasu Koga, to behead Mishima. Morita then knelt and stabbed himself in the abdomen and Koga again performed the kaishakunin duty. This coup is called [...] in Japan.|$|E
2500|$|Pfeiffer was {{restored}} <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair</b> at Munich in 1951 {{from which he}} would retire in 1957. The remaining {{years of his life}} following the completion of his Callimachus were devoted to his interest in the history of classical scholarship that had been kindled while still a youth in Augsburg. In the preface to History of Classical Scholarship from the Beginnings to the Hellenistic Age (1968) he reports that, [...] "As soon as the second volume of Callimachus was published in 1953 by the Clarendon Press, I submitted to the delegates a proposal for a History of Classical Scholarship". This book was followed in 1976 by a volume treating the period from 13501800. He had intended to publish a third volume to cover the intervening period, but his interests in Hellenistic scholarship and the high humanist period (and the urging of Fraenkel) drew him to the bookends of his history and, upon his death, only a long abandoned sketch of the volume covering Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages had been completed.|$|E

60|$|The fit on this {{occasion}} was a short one. Perhaps the drug was already beginning to have some influence over him? In twenty minutes, he was able <b>to</b> resume <b>his</b> <b>chair,</b> and <b>to</b> go on talking to me.|$|R
60|$|It had not {{occurred}} to her to take a copy. He rose and pointed <b>to</b> <b>his</b> empty <b>chair.</b> <b>His</b> opinion of the cipher was, to all appearance, forced to express itself by the discovery {{that there was no}} copy.|$|R
60|$|He groped back <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair,</b> {{his chest}} labouring {{as he sat}} down.|$|E

60|$|This was {{too much}} for Ned, who was a tender-hearted man. The blood rushed <b>to</b> <b>his</b> face; he sprang up with such {{violence}} as <b>to</b> overturn <b>his</b> <b>chair,</b> seized <b>his</b> cap, and, without uttering a word, dashed out of the room, and went downstairs three steps at a time.|$|R
60|$|Allan, who {{had been}} once more restlessly pacing the room, stopped, and {{returned}} <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair.</b>|$|E

50|$|He {{appears as}} a fictional {{character}} on his deathbed in eighteenth-century novelist Denis Diderot's Letter on the Blind for the Use of those who can see, which discusses how man can acquire knowledge not only through perception, but also through reason. His character represents a person with no perception but endowed with logical genius, trying to comprehend God. This gives some indication of his celebrity status during his life, being used as an icon similarly <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair's</b> later occupant, Stephen Hawking, who also appears in debates about disability and genius.|$|R
