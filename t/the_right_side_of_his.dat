5|$|Evers {{suffered}} a stroke in August 1942, which paralyzed <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> body. He remained bedridden or {{confined to a wheelchair}} for most of the next five years. Evers died of a cerebral hemorrhage in 1947 at St. Peter's Hospital in Albany, and is buried in Saint Mary's Cemetery in Troy.|$|E
5|$|No tells Bond that he {{is working}} with the Russians and has built an {{elaborate}} underground facility from which he can sabotage US test missiles launched from Cape Canaveral. He had previously been a member of a Chinese tong, but after he stole a large amount of money from their treasury, he was captured by the organisation. The tong's leaders had No's hands cut off as a warning to others, and then shot. Because No's heart was on <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> body, the bullet missed it and he survived.|$|E
5|$|The first Guardian video shows {{one officer}} lunge at Tomlinson from behind, strike {{him across the}} legs with a baton and push his back, causing him to fall. On 8 April Channel4 News {{released}} their own footage, which showed the officer's arm swing back to head height before bringing it down to hit Tomlinson on the legs with the baton. Another video obtained by The Guardian on 21 April shows Tomlinson standing by a bicycle rack, hands in his pockets, when the police approach him. After he is hit, he can be seen scraping along the ground on <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> forehead; eyewitnesses spoke of hearing a noise as his head hit the ground.|$|E

5|$|The {{portrait}} {{represents a}} man, estimated {{by some to}} be 45years of age, standing turned to the viewer's right, looking at the viewer with a commanding expression. In his uplifted right hand he holds a baton with a golden cap. He has a thick moustache and wears a high fur cap on which there is a golden chain with precious stones and a coat of arms in the center. From his ear a large pear-shaped pearl hangs from a golden pendant earring. He wears a reddish-brown mantle with a broad fur collar and, over it, a heavy gold chain from which the order of three horse tails, set in rich pendants, hangs on his right shoulder. A full light from the left falls on <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> face. The background is brownish-grey.|$|E
5|$|The Guardian {{obtained}} a four-minute video on 21 April from an anonymous bystander {{who had been}} filming on Cornhill between 7:10 and 7:30pm. The footage shows Tomlinson standing behind a bicycle rack in Royal Exchange Passage {{with his hands in}} his pockets, and a group of advancing police officers. When a police dog approaches him, he turns his back. At that point, he is hit on the legs and pushed by the TSG constable, and can be seen scraping along the ground on <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> forehead. Eyewitnesses said they heard a noise as his head hit the ground. The IPCC sought an injunction against the broadcast of the video by Channel4 News, but a judge rejected the application. An image obtained by Sky News on 24 April appears to show bruising {{on the right side of}} Tomlinson's forehead. A head injury was recorded by the second and third pathologists.|$|E
5|$|Three {{practice}} sessions were held before the Sunday race—one on Friday, and two on Saturday. The first session lasted 90 minutes, {{while the second}} session lasted 45 minutes. The third and final session lasted 60 minutes. In the first practice session, Clint Bowyer was fastest, placing ahead of Biffle in second, and Johnson in third. Gordon was fourth fastest, and Edwards placed fifth. Kurt Busch, David Ragan, Jeff Burton, Keselowski and Kevin Harvick rounded out the top ten fastest drivers in the session. Max Papis damaged {{the right-hand side of}} his car when he hit the turn two wall; Jamie McMurray, David Reutimann and Mike Bliss also hit the turn two wall. Bliss went to a back-up car because <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> car was heavily damaged. John Andretti's engine failed during the early phase of the session, and Andretti changed engines. Burton switched to a back-up car after he collided with the turn two outside wall.|$|E

50|$|Petty co-crew chiefs Robin Pemberton and Larry Pollard {{stated that}} during the last pit stop of the race they put softer {{compound}} bias-ply tires designed for the left <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the cars on <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> Petty's race car. The softer left side tires provided more traction when attached to <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> a stock car and worked best when used during cool cloudy weather days which prevents the softer tires from quickly wearing out if mounted on <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cars.|$|R

5|$|In March 1909, Riley was {{stricken}} {{a second}} time with Bell's palsy, and partial deafness, the symptoms only gradually eased {{over the course of}} the year. Riley was a difficult patient, and generally refused to take any medicine except the patent medicines he had sold in his earlier years; the medicines often worsened his conditions, but his doctors could not sway his opinion. On July 10, 1910 he suffered a stroke that paralyzed <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> body. Hoping for a quick recovery, his family kept the news from the press until September. Riley found the loss of use of his writing hand the worst part of the stroke, which served only to further depress him. With his health so poor, he decided to work on a legacy by which to be remembered in Indianapolis. In 1911 he donated land and funds to build a new library on Pennsylvania Avenue. By 1913, with the aid of a cane, Riley began to recover his ability to walk. His inability to write, however, nearly ended his production of poems. George Ade worked with him from 1910 through 1916 to write his last five poems and several short autobiographical sketches as Riley dictated. His publisher continued recycling old works into new books, which remained in high demand.|$|E
5|$|Sérurier {{was born}} at Laon on 8 December 1742, the son of Mathieu-Guillaume Sérurier. The family formed part of the minor provincial nobility, his father holding the title Seigneur de Sort and the job of mole-catcher to the king's {{breeding}} stud. After 1750 his father's title became Seigneur de Saint-Gobert. Sérurier got a good education and was of sober character. He received a commission as lieutenant in the Laon militia battalion on 25 March 1755, his uncle being the unit's commander. He transferred to the Soissons militia battalion on 12 June 1758. When he heard that the Laon battalion was called {{to serve in the}} Seven Years' War he switched back to his old unit on 30 November 1758. After sustaining a bayonet wound, he transferred into the Mazarin Infantry Regiment as a cadet on 1 October 1759. At the Battle of Warburg on 31 July 1760, Duke Ferdinand of Brunswick surprised the French under Louis Nicolas Victor de Felix d'Ollieres, Count Du Muy. While defending a critical post, Sérurier was hit on <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> face by a bullet, which broke his jaw and left a lasting scar. The injury also cost him most of his teeth. He was promoted to second lieutenant on 25 April 1762.|$|E
25|$|He has a {{circular}} scar on <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> face, just above his lip. In {{the early days}} of his film career, Hung was involved in a street fight outside a Kowloon nightclub, and was stabbed with a broken cola bottle.|$|E

25|$|Fifteen {{years later}} Schneerson {{suffered}} a serious stroke while praying {{at the grave}} of his father-in-law. The stroke left him unable to speak and paralyzed on <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> body. During this time, the hope that Schneerson could be revealed as the Messiah (Moshiach) became more widespread.|$|E
25|$|Foye {{was born}} with a {{condition}} called situs inversus that caused him to be born with his organs reversed, meaning his heart is on <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> body and his liver is on the left.

Hirsch did not return to action during the 1948 season, totaling 101 receiving yards and 93 rushing yards in five games.|$|E
25|$|The autopsy {{revealed}} {{a number of}} fragment wounds on <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> head. He also had many fragment wounds {{on the front of}} his right shoulder and upper chest; two major fragments had gone straight through his chest. He had a lacerated lung and much internal bleeding.

25|$|Identification of the Romanovs {{was made}} {{based on the}} {{clothing}} worn and by papers found in their pockets. The White Army investigators had no medical or dental records, and eleven weeks in the mine had substantially altered the victim's physical appearance.
