Vick missed a connecting flight in Atlanta on Monday <b>to</b> <b>Reagan</b> National Airport in Arlington, Virginia. He {{failed to show up}} for another seat booked for him later that evening. On Tuesday morning, he did not attend his scheduled appearance at a congressional breakfast where he was to be honored for his foundation's work with after-school projects in Georgia and Virginia. Vick's mother, Brenda, accepted the award from the Afterschool Alliance.|$|E
5|$|Public {{reaction}} <b>to</b> <b>Reagan</b> {{was always}} mixed; the oldest president {{up to that}} time was supported by young voters, and began an alliance that shifted many of them to the Republican party. Reagan did not fare well with minority groups, especially African-Americans. This was largely due to his opposition to affirmative action policies. However, his support of Israel throughout his presidency earned him support from many Jews. He emphasized family values in his campaigns and during his presidency, although he was the first president to have been divorced. The combination of Reagan's speaking style, unabashed patriotism, negotiation skills, as well as his savvy use of the media, {{played an important role in}} defining the 1980s and his future legacy.|$|E

5|$|Reagan's {{campaign}} {{relied on}} a strategy crafted by campaign manager John Sears of winning a few primaries early to damage the inevitability of Ford's likely nomination. Reagan won North Carolina, Texas, and California, but the strategy failed, as he ended up losing New Hampshire, Florida, and his native Illinois. The Texas campaign lent renewed hope <b>to</b> <b>Reagan,</b> when he swept all 96 delegates chosen in the May 1 primary, with four more awaiting at the state convention. Much {{of the credit for}} that victory came from the work of three co-chairmen, including Ernest Angelo, the mayor of Midland, and Ray Barnhart of Houston, whom Reagan as President would appoint in 1981 as director of the Federal Highway Administration.|$|E
5|$|The White House Chief of Staff, Donald Regan, grew {{frustrated}} with this regimen, which created friction {{between him and}} the First Lady. This escalated with the revelation of the Iran–Contra affair, an administration scandal, in which the First Lady felt Regan was damaging the president. She thought he should resign, and expressed this to her husband, although he did not share her view. Regan wanted President Reagan to address the Iran-Contra matter in early 1987 by means of a press conference, though Reagan refused to allow her husband to overexert himself due to a recent prostate surgery and astrological warnings. Regan became so angry with Reagan that he hung up on her during a 1987 telephone conversation. According to the recollections of ABC News correspondent Sam Donaldson, when the President heard of this treatment, he demanded—and eventually received—Regan's resignation. Vice President George H. W. Bush is also reported to have suggested <b>to</b> <b>Reagan</b> to have Regan fired.|$|E

Atwater would later dispatch Austin to consult on various Congressional campaigns that were important to Atwater.|$|E
25|$|In 1985, Kohl and U.S. President Ronald Reagan, {{as part of}} a plan {{to observe}} the 40th anniversary of V-E Day, saw an {{opportunity}} to demonstrate the strength of the friendship that existed between Germany and its former foe. During a November 1984 visit to the White House, Kohl appealed <b>to</b> <b>Reagan</b> to join him in symbolizing the reconciliation of their two countries at a German military cemetery. As Reagan visited Germany as part of the 11th G7 summit in Bonn, the pair visited Bergen-Belsen concentration camp on 5 May and, controversially, the German military cemetery at Bitburg.|$|E

While a student at GWU, he worked in the office of Senator Bob Dole of Kansas from 1977 to 1979. In 1980 he supported Congressman John B. Anderson's presidential bid, but switched his support <b>to</b> <b>Reagan</b> following the Republican National Convention. From his graduation to 1999, he was Midwest Sales Manager for the Metroweb printing company in Erlanger, Kentucky.

25|$|Former Governor Ronald Reagan of California was the odds-on {{favorite}} to win his party's nomination for president after nearly beating incumbent President Gerald Ford just four years earlier. Reagan dominated the primaries, early driving from the field Senate Minority Leader Howard Baker from Tennessee, former governor John Connally of Texas, Senator Robert Dole from Kansas, Representative Phil Crane from Illinois, and Representative John Anderson from Illinois, {{who dropped out of}} the race to run as an Independent. George Bush from Texas posed the strongest challenge <b>to</b> <b>Reagan</b> with his victories in the Pennsylvania and Michigan primaries, but it was not enough to turn the tide. Reagan won the nomination on the first round at the 1980 Republican National Convention in Detroit, Michigan, in July, then chose George H. W. Bush, his top rival, as his running mate.|$|E
25|$|Though debt {{almost always}} {{increased}} under every {{president in the}} latter half of the 20th century, it declined as a percentage of GDP under all Presidents after 1950 and prior <b>to</b> <b>Reagan.</b> In addition to the fiscal deficits, the U.S. started to have large trade deficits. Also it was during his second term that the Tax Reform Act of 1986 was passed. Vice President George H. W. Bush was elected to succeed Reagan in 1988. The early Bush Presidency's economic policies were sometimes seen as a continuation of Reagan's policies, but in the early 1990s, Bush went back on a promise and increased taxes in a compromise with Congressional Democrats. He ended his presidency on a moderate note, signing regulatory bills such as the Americans With Disabilities Act, and negotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement. In 1992, Bush and third-party candidate Ross Perot lost to Democrat Bill Clinton.|$|E
25|$|The Almeda School District was {{established}} in 1893; students originally attended school in a barn and utilized hay stacks as desks. A white one room school building opened in 1894. The first permanent school in Almeda opened in 1901. In 1905 Almeda's school had one teacher and 31 students. State highway maps indicated two schools within one mile of Almeda in 1936. During that year the Almeda area {{became a part of}} HISD. In 1981 a new Almeda Elementary School campus opened. The current Almeda campus opened in February 2011. Until the fall of 2011, residents east of Almeda Road were zoned to Woodson K-8 School, while residents west of Almeda Road were zoned to Lawson Middle School. From fall 2011 to fall 2012, all students were zoned to Lawson Middle School. Prior to fall 2012, all students were zoned to Almeda Elementary School. Beginning in fall 2012 portions of the old Almeda Elementary and Lawson zones were rezoned <b>to</b> <b>Reagan</b> K-8.|$|E

25|$|The Crimson Tide {{scored on}} their opening drive {{of the third}} quarter when John Parker Wilson threw a 35-yard {{touchdown}} pass to Keith Brown. Hawaii then cut the Alabama lead to 22–10 later that quarter when Colt Brennen threw a 16-yard touchdown strike <b>to</b> <b>Reagan</b> Maui'a. In the fourth quarter, a 27-yard Tiffin field goal extended the Alabama lead to 25–10. The Warriors responded Brennen connected with Ryan Grice-Mullen for a 31-yard touchdown reception to make the score 25–17. After holding the Tide on their next offensive series, Hawaii managed to drive 49 yards in 2:40 to get in position to potentially tie the game and send it into overtime. Alabama secured the 25–17 victory on the final play of the game when Lionel Mitchell intercepted a Brennen pass in the endzone for a touchback as time expired. The victory improved Alabama's all-time record against the Warriors to 1–1 (2–1 without NCAA vacations).|$|E
500|$|In his 2015 {{syndicated}} article [...] "Think Of The Children", Michael Reagan {{criticized the}} phrase's use by politicians.

He called the tactic an illogical argument, an act of desperation by those who felt they had a weaker case with reason-based arguments. Noting {{that it has been}} used by Democrats and Republicans alike in the United States, Reagan called the tactic [...] "obvious political BS".|$|E
