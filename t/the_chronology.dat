5|$|After a gap {{of several}} decades, {{in the early}} 1980s, Vimala Begley studied the {{ceramics}} find of the site and proposed a preliminary version of <b>the</b> <b>chronology</b> of the occupation of the site. At {{the same time she}} started researching on the beads, organized a proper sequential display of the artifacts of the site at the Pondicherry Museum, and brought out an information brochure.|$|E
5|$|In the 1630s, {{the texts}} of these annals were {{compiled}} into a single, enormous compendium, known as the Annals of the Four Masters. In the process, the authors sometimes modified <b>the</b> <b>chronology</b> and content {{of some of the}} materials, and is thus chronologically untrustworthy. However, it is recognised that they saved for posterity material that would otherwise have been lost, and the entry contains the longest annalistic account of the battle.|$|E
5|$|Moreover, <b>the</b> <b>chronology</b> of the {{correspondent}} Hittite texts {{was initially}} estimated {{at the end}} of the 13th century BCE. However, more recent research, based on a number of archaic characteristics the specific texts feature, place it together with the events described circa two centuries earlier (end of 15th-beginning of 14th century BCE).|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> New <b>Chronology</b> is an {{unconventional}} revised <b>chronology</b> of <b>the</b> ancient Near East created by Rohl. It involves a major revision of <b>the</b> conventional <b>chronology</b> of ancient Egypt, in particular by redating Egyptian kings of the 19th through 25th Dynasties. Rohl asserts that <b>the</b> New <b>Chronology</b> allows scholars to identify {{some of the}} main characters in the Old Testament with people whose names appear in archaeological finds. <b>The</b> New <b>Chronology</b> has not gained acceptance among Egyptologists.|$|R
5|$|On 26 May 2011 American writer Jeffery Deaver, {{commissioned}} by Ian Fleming Publications, released Carte Blanche. Deaver restarted <b>the</b> <b>chronology</b> of Bond, {{separate from the}} timelines {{of any of the}} previous authors, by stating he was born in 1980; the novel also saw Bond in a post-9/11 agency, independent of either MI5 or MI6.|$|E
5|$|The Young Bond {{series of}} novels {{was started by}} Charlie Higson and, between 2005 and 2009, five novels and one short story were published. The first Young Bond novel, SilverFin was also adapted and {{released}} as a graphic novel on 2 October 2008 by Puffin Books. Comic book artist Kev Walker illustrated Higson's novel. Young Bond {{is set in the}} 1930s, which would fit <b>the</b> <b>chronology</b> with that of Fleming.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>chronology</b> for {{activities}} in Greece {{during the years}} 355–352 BC is not entirely clear (see below). Philip certainly started besieging Methone, the last Athenian possession in Macedon, during this period, but different historians choose different dates for this siege. There are two main theories, either 355–354 BC, as favoured by, for instance, Buckler, or 354–353 BC, as favoured by Cawkwell.|$|E

40|$|Sixteen modern Nothofagus solandri tree-ring chronologies, {{developed}} from sites near the alpine timberline, South Island, New Zealand are presented. The statistical properties of <b>the</b> <b>chronologies</b> are similar, having high mean sensitivity values (mean of 0. 34), moderate autocorrelation values (mean of 0. 50), and high common variance values (mean of 42 %). However, <b>the</b> <b>chronologies</b> are mainly less than 300 years in length.

It is concluded that these chronologies offer considerable potential for reconstructing palaeoclimates, especially palaeotemperature...|$|R

5|$|As a result, Maslama {{launched}} {{another attack}} aimed at Tyana, with his nephew al-Abbas ibn al-Walid as co-commander. <b>The</b> <b>chronology</b> {{of the expedition}} is again unclear: the Byzantine chronicler Theophanes the Confessor puts it in A.M. 6201 (708/709 AD, and possibly even 709/710), but Arab sources date it to A.H. 88 and 89 (706/707 AD and 707/708 AD respectively). As a result, the siege has been variously dated to 707–708 AD and 708–709 AD.|$|E
5|$|Philip {{returned}} to Thessaly {{the next summer}} (either 353 or 352 BC, depending on <b>the</b> <b>chronology</b> followed), having gathered a new army in Macedon. Philip formally requested that the Thessalians join him {{in the war against}} the Phocians; the Thessalians, even if underwhelmed by Philip's performance the previous year, realistically had little choice if they wanted to avoid being conquered by Onomarchus' army. Philip now mustered all the Thessalian opponents of Pherae that he could, and according to Diodorus, his final army numbered 20,000 infantry and 3000 cavalry.|$|E
40|$|Ring-width chronologies are {{developed}} for three sites near Schefferville, Quebec, using {{principal components analysis}} {{as an alternative to}} the standard tree-ring analytical procedures. <b>The</b> <b>chronologies</b> derived exhibit marked similarities, in both high and low frequency variability, to other published ring-width series from both eastern and western Canada. <b>The</b> longest <b>chronology</b> allows a reconstruction of temperature at Schefferville from the present to 1700. ...|$|R

5|$|Settlement of Kent by {{continental}} peoples, primarily Jutes, {{was complete}} {{by the end}} of the sixth century. Eadbald's father, Æthelberht, probably came to the throne in about 589 or 590, though <b>the</b> <b>chronology</b> of his reign is very difficult to determine accurately. Æthelberht was recorded by the early chronicler Bede as having overlordship, or imperium, over other Anglo-Saxon kingdoms. This dominance led to wealth in the form of tribute, and Kent was a powerful kingdom at the time of Æthelberht's death in 616, with trade well-established with the European mainland.|$|E
5|$|The Chronologia {{developed}} into an even wider project, the Cosmographia, {{a description of}} the whole Universe. Mercator's outline was (1) the creation of the world; (2) the description of the heavens (astronomy and astrology); (3) the description of the earth comprising modern geography, the geography of Ptolemy and the geography of the ancients; (4) genealogy and history of the states; and (5) chronology. Of these <b>the</b> <b>chronology</b> had already been accomplished, the account of the creation and the modern maps would appear in the atlas of 1595, his edition of Ptolemy appeared in 1578 but the ancient geography and the description of the heavens never appeared.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>chronology</b> of {{completion}} of these yoga-related Pali Canons, however, is unclear, just like ancient Hindu texts. Early known Buddhist sources like the Majjhima Nikāya mention meditation, while the Anguttara Nikāya describes Jhāyins (meditators) that resemble early Hindu descriptions of Muni, Kesins and meditating ascetics, but these meditation-practices are not called yoga in these texts. The earliest known specific discussion of yoga in the Buddhist literature, as understood in modern context, {{is from the}} third- to fourth-century CE scriptures of the Buddhist Yogācāra school and fourth- to fifth-century Visuddhimagga of Buddhaghosa.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>chronology</b> of {{the tomb}} monument's {{completion}} is not precisely known, but portions can be determined from various sources. According to the passing reference of a Florentine notary, in 1424 (by the Florentine calendar) part {{of the tomb}} was installed. Michelozzo's Catasto from July 1427 indicates that Michelozzo had been Donatello's partner {{for about two years}} ("due anni o incircha") and that three-fourths of the 800florin budget had been spent. To harmonize these accounts, one must conclude either that Michelozzo's chronology was imprecise, that Donatello received the commission before the partnership was formed, or that the 1424 date in the Florentine calendar falls in 1425 in the modern calendar.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} yoga have been speculated to {{date back to}} pre-Vedic Indian traditions; it is {{mentioned}} in the Rigveda, but most likely developed around the sixth and fifth centuries BCE, in ancient India's ascetic and śramaṇa movements. <b>The</b> <b>chronology</b> of earliest texts describing yoga-practices is unclear, varyingly credited to Hindu Upanishads. The Yoga Sutras of Patanjali date from {{the first half of}} the 1st millennium CE, but only gained prominence in the West in the 20th century. Hatha yoga texts emerged around the 11th century with origins in tantra.|$|E
5|$|The {{story of}} Æthelburg's {{marriage}} being dependent on Edwin {{allowing her to}} practice her faith has been questioned, since revising <b>the</b> <b>chronology</b> makes it likely, though not certain, that the marriage was arranged before Eadbald's conversion. In this view, {{it would have been}} the church that objected to the marriage, and Æthelburg would have been Christian before Eadbald's conversion. The story of Paulinus's consecration is also problematic as he was not consecrated until at least 625 and possibly later, which is after the latest possible date for Æthelburg's marriage. However, it may be that he traveled to Northumbria prior to his consecration and only later became bishop.|$|E
