5|$|For {{the female}} lead of Cliff's girlfriend Jenny, Sherilyn Fenn, Kelly Preston, Diane Lane and Elizabeth McGovern were {{considered}} before Jennifer Connelly was eventually cast. Campbell and Connelly's working relationship {{eventually led to}} a romantic coupling, which Johnston {{found to be a}} technique for method acting that helped with their on-screen chemistry. For Secord's sidekick, Peevy, Dave Stevens hoped that Lloyd Bridges would play <b>the</b> <b>part,</b> but Bridges turned it down and Alan Arkin was cast. <b>The</b> <b>part</b> of Neville Sinclair was offered to Jeremy Irons and Charles Dance before Timothy Dalton accepted the role. Lastly, <b>the</b> <b>part</b> of Eddie Valentine was written with Joe Pesci in mind, but he turned down <b>the</b> <b>part,</b> which went to Paul Sorvino.|$|E

No one associated with the production officially notified Darin or his representatives that he had been replaced; they found out from a member of the public at a charity horse race.|$|E
50|$|The {{fundamental}} holistic {{characters as}} a unity of parts {{which is so}} close and intense as {{to be more than}} the sum of its parts; which not only gives a particular conformation or structure to <b>the</b> <b>parts,</b> but so relates and determines them in their synthesis that their functions are altered; the synthesis affects and determines <b>the</b> <b>parts,</b> so that they function towards the whole; and the whole and <b>the</b> <b>parts,</b> therefore reciprocally influence and determine each other, and appear more or less to merge their individual characters: the whole is in <b>the</b> <b>parts</b> and <b>the</b> <b>parts</b> are in <b>the</b> whole, and this synthesis of whole and parts is reflected in the holistic character of the functions of <b>the</b> <b>parts</b> as well as of the whole.|$|R

5|$|Although other {{recurring}} {{characters in}} the Eon series, such as M, Q and Moneypenny, had continuity within the actors, the character of Leiter has not. In the nine Eon films in which Leiter makes an appearance, there have been seven actors playing the role. Only two actors have played <b>the</b> <b>part</b> twice: David Hedison and Jeffrey Wright. Wright's first appearances also made him the first African-American actor to play <b>the</b> <b>part</b> in the Eon series, although Leiter was also played by Afro-American actor Bernie Casey {{in one of the}} non-Eon films, Never Say Never Again.|$|E

50|$|Spin welding is a {{friction}} welding technique used on thermoplastic materials, in which <b>the</b> <b>parts</b> to be welded are heated by friction. The heat may be generated by turning on a lathe, a drill press, or a milling machine, where one part {{is driven by}} the chuck, and the other is held stationary with <b>the</b> spinning <b>part</b> driven against it. This is continued until the heat of friction between <b>the</b> <b>parts</b> reaches a sufficient level for <b>the</b> <b>parts</b> to weld. <b>The</b> stationary <b>part</b> is then released to spin as well, while pressure is applied along the axis of rotation, holding <b>the</b> <b>parts</b> together as they cool.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a texture based shape connection method for reconstructing parts {{of an object}} shape into its entire 3 -D shape.

Then, the method uses the results for estimating the relative position-and-orientation between <b>the</b> <b>parts.</b> Finally, it reconstructs the entire shape by connecting <b>the</b> <b>parts.</b> <b>The</b> experimental results show that this method yields accurate reconstruction results, even when an object lacks shape features...|$|R
5|$|Baleen whales have a {{relatively}} small brain compared to their body mass. Like other mammals, their brain has a large, folded cerebrum, <b>the</b> <b>part</b> of the brain responsible for memory and processing sensory information. Their cerebrum only makes up about 68% of their brain's weight, as opposed to human's 83%. The cerebellum, <b>the</b> <b>part</b> of the brain responsible for balance and coordination, makes up 18% of their brain's weight, compared to 10% in humans, which is {{probably due to the}} great degree of control necessary for constantly swimming. Necropsies on the brains of gray whales revealed iron oxide particles, which may allow them to find magnetic north like a compass.|$|E

40|$|The {{description}} {{refers to}} a device for depalletizing and/or picking up pliable flat sack bundles not collected by auxiliary means. The device comprises a gripper unit and a mobile bottom-support part and a clamping cylinder to grip <b>the</b> <b>parts</b> to be raised. The gripper unit has a first holding-down clamp which is lowered onto <b>the</b> <b>parts</b> to be raised, and a second holding-down clamp which is placed form-fitting on <b>the</b> <b>parts</b> lying below. A contact gap is thus created for the bottom support element arranged in the second holding-down clamp and movable relative to the latter. The bottom support element leaves {{the area of the}} second holding-down clamp during the travel movement and supports <b>the</b> <b>parts</b> from below whereby it is in form-fitting contact with <b>the</b> lower <b>parts</b> during <b>the</b> entire travel movement.
