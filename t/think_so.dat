5|$|Irene is a Neoclassical tragedy written between 1726 and 1749 by Samuel Johnson. It has the {{distinction}} of being the work Johnson considered his greatest failure. Since his death, the critical consensus has been that he was right to <b>think</b> <b>so.</b>|$|E
5|$|Yuri, {{also known}} as , has a {{determined}} personality but is secretly very sensitive and protective. She invites Otonashi to join the SSS, an organization she founded and leads which fights against God. She is smart and decisive when making operations and decisions. She carries a silver Beretta 92. Not only is she skilled with a gun, but she is also capable in close range hand-to-hand combat, which is shown when she fends off Angel's hand sonic with a combat knife. She vowed to fight against God after her three younger siblings were murdered by burglars looking for valuables and never forgave herself for failing to prevent their deaths. She is an effective leader, but does not <b>think</b> <b>so.</b> She regrets even fighting with Kanade later in the story, because she feels {{she could have been}} great friends with her. She disappears after the graduation ceremony.|$|E
25|$|In Los Angeles, Angel and Buffy compares {{notes and}} realize {{that both of them}} are dealing with cases of missing {{teenagers}} - most of them are children of the rich and powerful. Coincidence? They don't <b>think</b> <b>so.</b> But when Buffy checks in with Giles, she learns that prime time doomsday has hit Sunnydale, taking precedence over the gang warfare in LA.|$|E

However, half of participants opined the royal house was too expensive, whilst 42% did not <b>think</b> <b>so.</b>|$|E
25|$|In some jurisdictions an extramarital affair may incur {{unexpected}} financial costs. In Australia, for example, {{affairs of}} two or more years duration can be deemed a de facto relationship, exposing the married cheater to financial claims in the Family Court on their superannuation savings, income and property. A de facto relationship may exist even when the partners do not <b>think</b> <b>so.</b> It is the Court that will define when it began and ended, based on the evidence.

25|$|Fields met {{the comedian}} and {{impresario}} Archie Pitt {{and they began}} working together. Pitt gave Fields champagne on her 18th birthday, and wrote in an autograph book {{to her that he}} would make her a star. Pitt began to manage her career and they began a relationship; they married in 1923 at Clapham Register Office. Their first revue was called Yes I <b>Think</b> <b>So</b> in 1915 and the two continued to tour Britain together until 1924. That year they appeared in the revue Mr Tower of London, with other shows By Request, It's A Bargain and The Show's The Thing, during the following years.|$|E

25|$|After {{the massacres}} perpetrated by the Mark I robots, Judge Stich {{was unable to}} bear {{his share of the}} {{responsibility}} for the disaster and he went insane. He was committed to a psychiatric ward, from where he would persistently escape and search the sewers for the rogue Number Five. It was therefore generally assumed that McGruder had learned her lesson and that the project had been discontinued. It suited McGruder to allow people to <b>think</b> <b>so.</b> However, she still authorised the development of Mark IIs, this time under the purview of Tek-Judge Quiggley. After another year of work, Quiggley almost had the improved robots ready for a second field test when Number Five re-emerged from the sewer and began a third campaign of murder. This time Number Five had learned to go to ground after each attack, and all efforts to locate it failed. Taking personal charge of the search, McGruder brought forward the new robots' field test and deployed them on the streets, reasoning (wrongly as it transpired) {{that the best way to}} anticipate the next move of a robot was to use other robots to hunt it.|$|E
25|$|Peter May took a well-deserved holiday {{with his}} fiancée, though the press did not <b>think</b> <b>so,</b> and Colin Cowdrey {{led the team}} against the weak Victorian team. He lost the toss {{and was forced to}} field in the 109°F/43°C heat and limited the fast bowlers Frank Tyson, Fred Trueman and Peter Loader to two over spells. Victoria did quite well and reached 270/5 in the day. A 21-year-old Bill Lawry opened the batting and made a slow 24 until he was bowled by Ted Dexter, the footballer Neil Crompton hit 73, Lindsay Hassett's nephew John Shaw 94 and Jack Potter 47. Trueman took 5/42 to dismiss Crompton and Shaw and {{returned}} in the morning to wrap up the innings for 286. The MCC responded poorly with 31/4, but Colin Cowdrey stroked 84 and Willie Watson 141 in a stand of 169. Watson looked much like his old self and batted with the tail, especially John Mortimore (32) and they finished on 313, the paceman Colin Guest taking 3/39. Victoria struggled in their second innings as Tyson (3/40) and Loader (3/29) found their form. Only Crompton (64) passed 22 and they were all out for 180. The MCC players were helped when the temperature dropped to 89°F/32°C half-way through the day. While knocking off the 156/1 to win Arthur Milton received a nasty ball on his glove which re-fractured his broken finger and he retired hurt for 35. Peter Richardson made 65 and 120 was added before the first wicket fell. Raman Subba Row and Ted Dexter both made 21 not out and the MCC won by 9 wickets.|$|E
500|$|The {{theme of}} {{tolerance}} is further {{reflected in the}} song's chorus, where Harrison urges: [...] "Don't be so hard on the ones that you love / It's the ones that you love, we <b>think</b> <b>so</b> little of..." [...] The chorus lyrics echo the message of [...] "Isn't It a Pity", in this case, author Ian Inglis writes, providing a [...] "bleak assessment of the human condition".|$|E

500|$|The author {{explained}} to Los Angeles Magazine her reasoning for {{including in the}} book a graphic phrase used by Jack Nicholson after his lovemaking session with her: [...] "The reason that line made the book is because he {{told me not to}} say anything.

Klare, the son of Indian parents who migrated to Britain in the 1960s, had suggested collecting money for Griffin to be deported to the South Pole, as [...] "it's a colourless landscape that will suit you fine". Klare said that while he did not <b>think</b> <b>so</b> at first, in retrospect he thought that Question Time was the right platform for Griffin.|$|E

MTV reported, [...] "in his smooth, pop and R way Justin fantasizes about Selena Gomez delivers Frank's sexy verse like a boss: [...] "Do you not <b>think</b> <b>so</b> far ahead?/'Cause I've been thinking 'bout forever."

500|$|Fenwick also asks rhetorically, [...] "Should we {{completely}} {{discount the}} testimonials of est graduates, {{knowing that they}} are not sufficiently rigorous measures to qualify as scientific evidence? [...] I don’t <b>think</b> <b>so.</b> The fact that positive testimonials are so readily obtained from est graduates, in combination with the observation that a majority of people who take the est training, continue to participate and have found the est experience to be rewarding. [...] Even if 'objective' changes are not documented in people's lives, it is noteworthy that people feel happier, more satisfied, more relaxed, and more 'alive.' If you 'feel' happier, then you 'are' happier – objective circumstances notwithstanding. Subjective states are clearly an important component of our lives." ...|$|E

500|$|Nabi is {{the older}} brother of Parwana and Masooma.

After being hired as a chauffeur for the Wahdatis, he becomes infatuated with the childless Nila and arranges for Pari to be sold to her in hopes that she will become his lover. After Nila's husband suffers a stroke and Nila leaves for Paris, he realizes that he had been foolish to <b>think</b> <b>so</b> and becomes the primary caregiver for his bedridden employer.
