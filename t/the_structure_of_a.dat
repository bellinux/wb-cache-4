5|$|Although {{crystallography}} {{can be used}} {{to characterize}} the disorder in an impure or irregular crystal, crystallography generally requires a pure crystal of high regularity to solve <b>the</b> <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> complicated arrangement of atoms.

The regularity of such crystals can sometimes be improved with macromolecular crystal annealing and other methods. However, in many cases, obtaining a diffraction-quality crystal is the chief barrier to solving its atomic-resolution structure.|$|E

5|$|As a manifesto, this {{paragraph}} became {{significant for the}} amalgamation of symphonic and dramatic elements in the same musical composition. Musicologist Hugh MacDonald writes that as Berlioz kept the idea of symphonic construction closely in mind, he allowed the orchestra to express {{the majority of the}} drama in instrumental music and set expository and narrative sections in words. Fellow musicologist Nicholas Temperley suggests that, in Roméo, Berlioz created a model for how a dramatic text could guide <b>the</b> <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> choral symphony without circumventing that work from being recognizably a symphony. In this sense, musicologist Mark Evans Bonds writes, the symphonies of Liszt and Mahler owe a debt of influence to Berlioz.|$|E

After he had <b>the</b> <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> scene in his head, he would write it; at times he was able {{to make use of the}} original Japanese dialogue, but most of the time he had to come up with new ideas himself. At several points, the English wordplay was inspired by the wordplay in the Japanese version. At some points, it was not possible to do wordplay in the same places as in the Japanese version, so Smith would change the structure of the scene slightly. At other points, Smith came up with a joke or funny line, and changed the scene to make the joke work. Around half of the jokes were rewritten based on the characters present in the scene, rather than being translations of the Japanese jokes.|$|E

5|$|In {{computational}} complexity theory, 2-satisfiability {{provides an}} example of an NL-complete problem, one that can be solved non-deterministically using a logarithmic amount of storage and that is among the hardest of the problems solvable in this resource bound. The set of all solutions to a 2-satisfiability instance can be given <b>the</b> <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> median graph, but counting these solutions is #P-complete and therefore not expected to have a polynomial-time solution. Random instances undergo a sharp phase transition from solvable to unsolvable instances as the ratio of constraints to variables increases past 1, a phenomenon conjectured but unproven for more complicated forms of the satisfiability problem. A computationally difficult variation of 2-satisfiability, finding a truth assignment that maximizes the number of satisfied constraints, has an approximation algorithm whose optimality depends on the unique games conjecture, and another difficult variation, finding a satisfying assignment minimizing the number of true variables, is an important test case for parameterized complexity.|$|E

5|$|In {{eukaryotic}} organisms, pre-mRNA is transcribed in the nucleus, introns are spliced out, {{then the}} mature mRNA is exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. The small subunit of the ribosome usually starts by binding to {{one end of}} the mRNA and is joined there by various other eukaryotic initiation factors, forming the initiation complex. The initiation complex scans along the mRNA strand until it reaches a start codon, and then the large subunit of the ribosome attaches to the small subunit and translation of a protein begins. This entire process is referred to as gene expression; it is the process by which the information in a gene, encoded as a sequence of bases in DNA, is converted into <b>the</b> <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> protein. A Morpholino can modify splicing or block translation, depending on the Morpholino's base sequence.|$|E
5|$|Phototrophic archaea use {{light to}} produce {{chemical}} {{energy in the}} form of ATP. In the Halobacteria, light-activated ion pumps like bacteriorhodopsin and halorhodopsin generate ion gradients by pumping ions out of the cell across the plasma membrane. The energy stored in these electrochemical gradients is then converted into ATP by ATP synthase. This process is a form of photophosphorylation. The ability of these light-driven pumps to move ions across membranes depends on light-driven changes in <b>the</b> <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> retinol cofactor buried {{in the center of the}} protein.|$|E
5|$|Recently, free {{electron}} lasers {{have been developed}} for use in X-ray crystallography. These are the brightest X-ray sources currently available; with the X-rays coming in femtosecond bursts. The intensity of the source is such that atomic resolution diffraction patterns can be resolved for crystals otherwise too small for collection. However, the intense light source also destroys the sample, requiring multiple crystals to be shot. As each crystal is randomly oriented in the beam, hundreds of thousands of individual diffraction images must be collected {{in order to get a}} complete data-set. This method, serial femtosecond crystallography, has been used in solving <b>the</b> <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> number of protein crystal structures, sometimes noting differences with equivalent structures collected from synchrotron sources.|$|E

Conversely, any median graph can be represented as the set of {{solutions to}} a 2-satisfiability instance in this way.

LLR has a rewiring method to improve <b>the</b> <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> overlay network and a recovery method to cope with disappearance of peers.

5|$|The structuralist {{movement}} originated {{primarily from}} the work of Durkheim as interpreted by two European anthropologists. Anthony Giddens' theory of structuration draws on the linguistic theory of Ferdinand de Saussure and the French anthropologist Claude Lévi-Strauss. In this context, 'structure' refers not to 'social structure' but to the semiotic understanding of human culture as a system of signs. One may delineate four central tenets of structuralism: First, structure is what determines <b>the</b> <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> whole. Second, structuralists believe that every system has a structure. Third, structuralists are interested in 'structural' laws that deal with coexistence rather than changes. Finally, structures are the 'real things' beneath the surface or the appearance of meaning.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{developing}} into {{a tropical}} cyclone, {{the storm was}} moving west-northwestward, influenced by a ridge to its north. It was located over an area of warm sea surface temperatures and moderate wind shear, which favored gradual intensification. The convection diminished during a diurnal cycle before redeveloping the next day. Maintaining an unusually large size, the depression slowly organized, gradually separating from the trough from which it developed. On October19, the CPHC upgraded it to Tropical Storm Neki, and shortly thereafter the storm turned toward the northwest. By the next day, the cyclone resembled <b>the</b> <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> monsoon depression typically found in the western Pacific Ocean. However, the structure began to more resemble a tropical cyclone after the outermost convection diminished and the thunderstorms around the center increased.

5|$|Discoloration {{of teeth}} {{may result from}} {{bacteria}} stains, tobacco, tea, coffee, foods {{with an abundance of}} chlorophyll, restorative materials, and medications. Stains from bacteria may cause colors varying from green to black to orange. Green stains also result from foods with chlorophyll or excessive exposure to copper or nickel. Amalgam, a common dental restorative material, may turn adjacent areas of teeth black or gray. Long term use of chlorhexidine, a mouthwash, may encourage extrinsic stain formation near the gingiva on teeth. This is usually easy for a hygienist to remove. Systemic disorders also can cause tooth discoloration. Congenital erythropoietic porphyria causes porphyrins to be deposited in teeth, causing a red-brown coloration. Blue discoloration may occur with alkaptonuria and rarely with Parkinson's disease. Erythroblastosis fetalis and biliary atresia are diseases which may cause teeth to appear green from the deposition of biliverdin. Also, trauma may change a tooth to a pink, yellow, or dark gray color. Pink and red discolorations are also associated in patients with lepromatous leprosy. Some medications, such as tetracycline antibiotics, may become incorporated into <b>the</b> <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> tooth, causing intrinsic staining of the teeth.|$|E
