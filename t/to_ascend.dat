5|$|After Nimrods departure, the sea ice broke up, {{cutting off}} the party's route to the Barrier and thus making preparatory {{sledging}} and depot-laying impossible. Shackleton decided to give the expedition impetus by ordering an immediate attempt <b>to</b> <b>ascend</b> Mount Erebus.|$|E
5|$|A hazard {{of flight}} for very small insects such as thrips is the {{possibility}} of being trapped by water. Thrips have non-wetting bodies and have the ability <b>to</b> <b>ascend</b> a meniscus by arching their bodies and working their way head-first and upwards along the water surface in order to escape.|$|E
5|$|As SR 89A {{moves to}} the northeast, it begins <b>to</b> <b>ascend</b> the Black Hills {{mountain}} range. The roadway follows the terrain {{through a series of}} hairpin turns as it climbs in elevation. Once SR 89A reaches passes over the mountains, it begins its descent into the Verde Valley. During its descent, SR 89A enters the town of Jerome. In Jerome, the highway provides access to the nearby Jerome State Historic Park.|$|E

5|$|Edmund Thomas Coleman, an Englishman who {{resided in}} Victoria, British Columbia, Canada and {{a veteran of}} the Alps, made the first attempt <b>to</b> <b>ascend</b> the {{mountain}} in 1866.

5|$|Grant planned another assault for May 22, {{but this}} time with greater care; they would first reconnoiter {{thoroughly}} and soften up the defenses with artillery and naval gunfire. The lead units were supplied with ladders <b>to</b> <b>ascend</b> the fortification walls. Grant did not want a long siege, and this attack was to be by the entire army across a wide front.|$|E

5|$|In 1864 the Board {{decided to}} seek powers {{to extend the}} railway beyond Gupworthy to {{workings}} in Joyce's Cleeve in the Quarme Valley. Preliminary notices to this effect were published, but no application was made. Had the line been built it would have entailed another incline, which ore would have had <b>to</b> <b>ascend</b> before travelling eastwards to Brendon Hill where it would travel down again.|$|E
5|$|Macrinus {{was born}} in Caesarea Mauretaniae (modern Cherchell, Algeria) in the Roman {{province}} of Mauretania to an equestrian family of Berber origins. He received an education which allowed him <b>to</b> <b>ascend</b> to the Roman political class. Over the years, he {{earned a reputation as}} a skilled lawyer; and, under Emperor Septimius Severus, he became an important bureaucrat. Severus' successor Caracalla later appointed him a prefect of the Praetorian Guard.|$|E

5|$|The {{management}} of narcosis is simply <b>to</b> <b>ascend</b> to shallower depths; the effects then disappear within minutes. In {{the event of}} complications or other conditions being present, ascending is always the correct initial response. Should problems remain, then {{it is necessary to}} abort the dive. The decompression schedule can still be followed unless other conditions require emergency assistance.|$|E
5|$|After {{passing the}} site of Ty Dwr the railway bends around 'Amen' corner and soon after the Village Incline is reached. From here the line runs into the gorge, high above the river on a narrow ledge, ending {{at the foot of}} the first incline leading to the Bryn Eglwys quarry. The {{original}} line fanned out into a set of three sidings, used to marshal trains of loaded slate wagons coming down from the quarry and empty wagons waiting <b>to</b> <b>ascend.</b> Nant Gwernol station, the eastern terminus of the line, was built on {{the site of}} the sidings.|$|E

5|$|Haldane's {{hypothesis}} {{was that a}} diver could ascend immediately to a depth where the supersaturation reaches but does not exceed the critical supersaturation level, at which depth the pressure gradient for off-gassing is maximized and the decompression is most efficient. The diver would remain at this depth until saturation had reduced sufficiently for him <b>to</b> <b>ascend</b> another 10 feet, to the new depth of critical supersaturation, where the process would be repeated until it was safe for the diver to reach the surface. Haldane assumed a constant critical ratio of dissolved nitrogen pressure to ambient pressure which was invariant with depth.|$|E
5|$|Having {{been born}} after the {{recognition}} of Brazilian independence, he was considered a foreigner under Portuguese law. However, his elder sister, having been born prior to independence, was able <b>to</b> <b>ascend</b> the throne of Portugal as Maria II upon the abdication of their father (Pedro I, who was also Pedro IV of Portugal) on 28 May 1826. As the only legitimate male child of Pedro I to survive infancy, he became heir to his father's Brazilian crown as Prince Imperial and was officially recognized as such on 6 August 1826.|$|E
5|$|Heraclius also {{acknowledged}} Shahrbaraz's Christian son Niketas, as his heir. An Iranian Christian as the heir of the Sasanian Empire opened {{the chances of}} the Christianization of Iran. After some time, Shahrbaraz had Shamta, {{the son of the}} former financial minister Yazdin, crucified on a church in Margha. The reason of this execution was reportedly because the latter had insulted Shahrbaraz during the reign of Khosrow II. Forty days later, 9 June 630, during a ceremony, Shahrbaraz was killed by a spear thrown by Farrukh Hormizd, who then helped Borandukht, the daughter of Khosrow II, <b>to</b> <b>ascend</b> the throne.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, the Eurypontid King of Sparta Eudamidas III, son of Agis IV, died. Pausanias, the Greek writer, {{claims that}} Cleomenes had him poisoned. In order to {{strengthen}} his position against the ephors, who {{were opposed to}} his expansionist policy, Cleomenes recalled his uncle Archidamus V from his exile in Messene <b>to</b> <b>ascend</b> the Eurypontid throne, {{but as soon as}} Archidamus returned to the city, he was assassinated. Cleomenes' involvement in the plot is unclear, since ancient sources contradict each other: Polybius claims that Cleomenes ordered the murder, but Plutarch disagrees.|$|E
5|$|Next to {{the older}} and much steeper stairs leading to the Aracoeli, Michelangelo devised a monumental wide-ramped stair (the cordonata), {{gradually}} ascending the hill to reach the high piazza, so that the Campidoglio resolutely turned its back on the Roman Forum that it had once commanded. It was built to be wide enough for horse riders <b>to</b> <b>ascend</b> the hill without dismounting. The railings are topped by the statues of two Egyptian lions in black basalt at their base and the marble renditions of Castor and Pollux at their top.|$|E
5|$|The North Korean {{aircraft}} {{split off}} into two groups, with two climbing rapidly into {{the clouds and}} the remaining three descending. Two F-82s piloted by Lieutenant Charles B. Moran (tail number 46-357) and Lieutenant William G. Hudson (tail number 46-383) followed the ascending pair. The two North Korean aircraft maneuvered around Moran's aircraft and opened fire, damaging the tail of his plane. Hudson responded by attacking the lead plane, forcing it <b>to</b> <b>ascend</b> further. Hudson's shots struck the aircraft in the fuselage and right wing.|$|E
