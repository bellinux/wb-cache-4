By referring to Mr. Elliott's vocabulary, (chapter xi) it will be seen that the human neck, that is, {{according to}} the concrete vocabulary, his neck, is onyara. Red Jacket pronounced the word Niagara <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> spring of 1820, as if written O-ne-au-ga-rah.|$|E

500|$|Although President Bush shook Colbert's hand {{after his}} presentation, several of Bush's aides and {{supporters}} walked out during Colbert's speech, and one former aide {{commented that the}} President had [...] "that look that he's ready to blow". Colbert recalled that [...] "not {{a lot of people}} laughed in the front row" [...] during the speech, and that [...] "when it was over, no one was even making eye contact with me ... no one is talking <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> whole damn room"; only Scalia came to him afterward, praising Colbert's imitation of a gesture the justice had recently been photographed making.|$|E

500|$|The song's opening lyric {{was taken}} from the title of [...] "Something in the Way She Moves", a track by Harrison's fellow Apple Records artist James Taylor. While musically Harrison {{imagined}} the composition in the style of Ray Charles, his inspiration for [...] "Something" [...] was his wife, Pattie Boyd. In her 2007 autobiography, , Boyd recalls: [...] "He told me, in a matter-of-fact way, that he had written it for me. I thought it was beautiful..." [...] Boyd discusses the song's subsequent popularity among other recording artists and concludes: [...] "My favourite [...] was the one by George Harrison, which he played <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> kitchen at Kinfauns." ...|$|E
500|$|From 1690 onwards, William {{was often}} absent from England on campaign, each year {{generally}} {{from the spring}} until the autumn. In 1690, he fought Jacobites (who supported James) in Ireland, and whilst her husband was away, Mary administered {{the government of the}} realm with the advice of a nine-member Cabinet Council. She was not keen to assume power and felt [...] "deprived of all that was dear <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> person of my husband, left among those that were perfect strangers to me: my sister of a humour so reserved that I could have little comfort from her." [...] Anne had quarrelled with William and Mary over money, and {{the relationship between the two}} sisters had soured.|$|E

500|$|After days {{of celebration}} and {{recuperation}} the ship left Tromsø on 26 August. The voyage south was a triumphal procession, with receptions at every port. Fram finally arrived in Christiania on 9 September, escorted into the harbour by {{a squadron of}} warships and welcomed by thousands—the largest crowds the city had ever seen, according to Huntford. Nansen and his crew were received by King Oscar; {{on the way to}} the reception they passed through a triumphal arch formed by 200gymnasts. Nansen and his family stayed at the palace as special guests of the king; by contrast, Johansen remained in the background, largely overlooked, and writing that [...] "reality, after all, is not so wonderful as it appeared <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> midst of our hard life." ...|$|E
500|$|Robinson's Hollywood exploits, however, did not {{sit well}} with Dodgers {{co-owner}} Walter O'Malley, who referred to Robinson as [...] "Rickey's prima donna". In late 1950, Rickey's contract as the Dodgers' team President expired. Weary of constant disagreements with O'Malley, and with no hope of being re-appointed as President of the Dodgers, Rickey cashed out his one-quarter financial interest in the team, leaving O'Malley in full control of the franchise. Rickey shortly thereafter became general manager of the Pittsburgh Pirates. Robinson was disappointed at the turn of events and wrote a sympathetic letter to Rickey, whom he considered a father figure, stating, [...] "Regardless of what happens <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> future, it all can be placed on what you have done and, believe me, I appreciate it." ...|$|E
500|$|There is some {{evidence}} of a morally questionable plan being formulated among the senior officers that winter. On Jan 1, 1872, Tyson wrote in his diary: [...] "Last month such an astonishing proposition was made to me that I have never ceased thinking of it since... It {{grew out of a}} discussion as to the feasibility of attempting to get farther north next summer." [...] And then on April 19, 1872: [...] "Had a talk with Chester about the astounding proposition made <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> winter. We agreed it was monstrous and must be prevented. Chester said he is determined, when he got home, to expose the matter." [...] Author Farley Mowat has suggested the officers were contemplating faking a journey to the Pole, or at least to a very high latitude.|$|E

500|$|In a 2007 {{feature for}} The Guardians G2 supplement, screenwriter Danny Brocklehurst {{discussed}} the impact the series {{has had on}} British television, including inspiration {{for one of his}} programmes, Talk to Me. He opined that until Cold Feet there had not been a significant television series depicting [...] "the wants and needs of ordinary young adults" [...] since Thirtysomething concluded in 1991. Brocklehurst developed Talk <b>to</b> <b>Me</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same manner as Bullen developed Cold Feet, namely by basing its characters on his own experiences and friends. Both Brocklehurst and Mark Lawson have discussed similar [...] "copycat" [...] series, including Hearts and Bones, Metropolis, Couples and Wonderful You. Brocklehurst noted that these series [...] "lacked [...] warmth and believability" [...] adding that they were [...] "unrealistic and cynical".|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} played only once and {{received}} minor treatments afterwards, {{with the addition}} of a cello part in the introduction and some editing, which included removing a verse to reduce the song's length. Eno was outraged that U2 wanted to shorten the song, and he was adamant that the band not alter the original track too much, saying, [...] "These fucking guys, they're supposed to be so spiritual—they don't spot a miracle when it hits them in the face. Nothing like that ever happened <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> studio in my whole life." [...] The band's original concept for No Line on the Horizon was to create an album of future hymns—songs that would be played forever. According to Eno and Lanois, [...] "Moment of Surrender" [...] is the closest the band came to reaching that concept.|$|E
500|$|The {{songs of}} Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness are {{intended}} to hang together conceptually, with {{the two halves of}} the album representing day and night. Despite this, Corgan has rejected the term concept album to describe it, and it was at the time described as more [...] "loose" [...] and [...] "vague" [...] than the band's previous records. However, Billy Corgan has also said that the album is based on [...] "the human condition of mortal sorrow". Corgan aimed the album's message at people aged 14 to 24 years, hoping [...] "to sum up all the things I felt as a youth but was never able to voice articulately." [...] He summed up by stating, [...] "I'm waving goodbye <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> rear view mirror, tying a knot around my youth and putting it under the bed." ...|$|E

500|$|Idlewild South was the band's first {{effort with}} Tom Dowd, {{known for his}} work with Cream and John Coltrane. Dowd first heard the band rehearsing while visiting Capricorn Sound Studios in Macon, asking their name and {{remarking}} to Walden, [...] "Get them {{the hell out of}} there and give them <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> studio. They don't need to rehearse; they're ready to record". Dowd was initially scheduled to work with the band on their debut album but was called away at the last minute. Initially, the band had asked friend and colleague Johnny Sandlin to produce their second album, but as recording inched closer, it became obvious they wanted him to co-produce with Dowd. In one of their first sessions, Sandlin was giving suggestions and acting as a co-producer, though no one had informed Dowd; Sandlin was embarrassed and did not return to the studio.|$|E
500|$|The album {{features}} a noticeably darker sound and lyrical subject matter than Vanilla Ice's previous albums, such as To The Extreme and Mind Blowin. The album {{was described by}} CNN as a [...] "shrill confessional" [...] on which the performer [...] "flays his '80s persona, his fractured family and Attention Deficit Disorder, which he has." [...] Vanilla Ice explained that the album [...] "just comes out dark because that's the way I feel I've been treated" [...] and that the album [...] "wasn't intended to be so dark. I opened up to Ross and I told {{him a lot of}} things that happened <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> past. It was like, really deep conversation, and he was like, you should write about that. And I was like, dude, I didn't want people to judge me for that. But he was right. It was like total therapy." ...|$|E
500|$|Brosnan has {{expressed}} contempt for his education by the Christian Brothers. However, in 2013 he commented, [...] "It always {{helps to have}} a bit of prayer in your back pocket. At the end of the day, you have to have something and for me that is God, Jesus, my Catholic upbringing, my faith... God has been good to me. My faith has been good <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> moments of deepest suffering, doubt and fear. It is a constant, the language of prayer... I might not have got my sums right from the Christian Brothers or might not have got the greatest learning of literature from them but I certainly got a strapping amount of faith." [...] Brosnan attends Mass, but adheres to other spiritual beliefs. In 2008 he said [...] "I also love the teachings of Buddhist philosophy. It's my own private faith. I don't preach it, but it's a faith that is a comfort to me when the night is long." ...|$|E

500|$|Overmars was {{selected}} in the squad for the 1998 World Cup, staged in France. Before the tournament began, he scored two goals in a friendly against Paraguay. He was on the scoresheet in the national team's 5–0 win against South Korea in the group stage. As the tournament progressed, Overmars felt the Netherlands were [...] "getting better and better" [...] and believed they could win the World Cup: [...] "Believe me, we can do it. In the past, {{there has been so}} much talk about our side and a lot of pressure with people calling us favourites. This time, nobody seemed to expect anything. In fact, people would come up <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> street and say we were only dark horses to win." [...] While training before the quarter-final match against Argentina, he sustained an injury which seemingly ruled him out of contention. He did feature late into the game as a substitute, but aggravated his injury. He was subsequently forced to sit out the entire semi-final against Brazil, which the Netherlands lost on penalties.|$|E
500|$|A {{pneumatic}} value {{failure in}} the preceding race, the United States Grand Prix, had forced Häkkinen to retire from the Grand Prix. With two races of the season remaining and an eight-point deficit after losing {{the lead in the}} Drivers' Championship, Häkkinen remained confident about his title chances: [...] "I know that what happened <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> last Grand Prix, when I had to retire, can happen to anyone, It could happen to Michael. So I am very optimistic. I have come here prepared and thinking about these two races together. Not one, two." [...] Michael Schumacher emphasised the pressure of leading the championship going into Japan: [...] "It hasn't been a relaxing time at all and I still haven't completely got over the jetlag from the States. But I'm prepared to sacrifice this and a lot more to bring the title back to Maranello. And {{the same can be said}} of the entire team." [...] Ferrari team principal Jean Todt and former World Champion Jody Scheckter called for Barrichello and Coulthard to race fairly as both drivers were ordered by their teams to assist their teammates in the Championship battle.|$|E
500|$|When {{asked what}} advice {{he would give}} to his character, Barber said [...] "Unfortunately, I don't think he would listen <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first place, but if he could give me the time of day, I would say lighten up on the control because you’re {{never going to have}} it." [...] Speaking to Channel 5, Barber {{revealed}} Rhys would not do a lot to redeem himself in the new year, but viewers would get learn more about his back story, which could explain his dark side. During a 2012 interview with Kilkelly, Barber said his character is good at getting what he wants, saying [...] "I {{think at the end of}} the day, he just wants to win and he has this ability to justify why he does things, and if people are hurt in the process, it's their fault. His vision is the one that is most important." [...] Barber said that deep down, Rhys is sensitive and he means well. When asked about the reaction Rhys has received from viewers, Barber believed they liked the character as he is unpredictable and manipulative. He added that the viewers are interested in seeing what Rhys does next. When asked how he felt about playing a bad boy by DNA's Matthew Myers, Barber revealed that he loved it, saying [...] "It's always exciting getting the scripts because I never know which way they are going to turn or who I'm going to be turning on!" [...] The actor quipped that he is always wondering which character he is going to manipulate or [...] "screw over" [...] next and added [...] "But at the core of things Rhys has a heart of gold." ...|$|E
