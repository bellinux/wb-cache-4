5|$|At her Silver Jubilee in 1977, {{the crowds}} and {{celebrations}} were genuinely enthusiastic, but in the 1980s, public criticism {{of the royal family}} increased, as the personal and working lives of Elizabeth's children came under media scrutiny. Elizabeth's popularity sank to a low point in the 1990s. Under pressure from public opinion, she began to pay income <b>tax</b> <b>for</b> the first time, and Buckingham Palace was opened to the public. Discontent with the monarchy reached its peak on the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, though Elizabeth's personal popularity and support for the monarchy rebounded after her live television broadcast to the world five days after Diana's death.|$|E
5|$|Food waste puts a large {{burden on}} the {{finances}} of each household and local councils in the UK; wasted food is estimated to cost each British household £250–£400 per year, accumulating to £15,000–£24,000 over a lifetime. This comes from the total purchasing cost of the food against what is thrown away uneaten. Additionally, households pay for the collection and disposal of food waste by their local council {{in the form of}} council <b>tax.</b> <b>For</b> councils, the cost of food waste comes from its collection and disposal {{as a part of the}} waste stream; this is especially an issue for councils that run separate food waste collections.|$|E
5|$|In the English towns the {{burgage tenure}} for urban {{properties}} was established {{early on in}} the medieval period, and was based primarily on tenants paying cash rents rather than providing labour services. Further development of a set of taxes that could be raised by the towns included murage for walls, pavage for streets, and pontage, a temporary <b>tax</b> <b>for</b> the repair of bridges. Combined with the lex mercatoria, which was a set of codes and customary practices governing trading, these provided a reasonable basis for the economic governance of the towns.|$|E

State Senator Diane Savino was among the supporters of the tunnel; Savino stated that if built, the tunnel would cost $3 billion and would improve quality of life for Staten Islanders, reduce traffic, and increase the attractiveness of the borough for investment.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, raisin exports {{were the}} most {{important}} export of the islands during the Venetian rule. By the early 18th century Zante, Cephalonia, and part of Ithaca had become a major centre of the currant trade. Because of the fierce competition in the raisin trade between Venice and the United Kingdom, Venice prohibited the free export of raisins from the islands. Another measure was the , a heavy export <b>tax</b> <b>for</b> foreign ships.|$|E
5|$|The Sugar Act {{provoked}} outrage in Boston, {{where it}} was widely viewed {{as a violation of}} colonial rights.

5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the Han dynasty, {{the land}} tax rate was reduced to one-hundredth, with lost revenue recouped by {{increasing}} the poll and property tax rates. The poll <b>tax</b> <b>for</b> most adults was 120 coins annually, 240 coins for merchants, and 20 coins for minors aged between three and fourteen years. The lower taxable threshold age for minors increased to seven years during the reign of Emperor Yuan of Han (r. 48–33 BC) and onwards. Historian Charles Hucker writes that underreporting of the population by local authorities was deliberate and widespread, since this reduced their tax and labor service obligations rendered to the central government.|$|E
5|$|Virginia {{collects}} {{personal income}} tax in five income brackets, ranging from 3.0% to 5.75%. The state sales and use tax rate is 4.3%, while the tax rate on food is 1.5%.

Virginia's property tax is set and collected at the local government level and varies throughout the Commonwealth. Real estate is also taxed {{at the local level}} based on 100% of fair market value. Tangible personal property also is taxed at the local level and is based on a percentage or percentages of original cost.|$|E

Also, E85 fuel price is set significantly lower than diesel or gasoline, resulting in E85 at € 0.80, diesel at €1.15, and gasoline at €1.30 per liter, as of April 2007. By May 2008, France had 211 pumps selling E85, even though the government made plans for the installation of up to 500 E85 pumps by year end 2007.

5|$|Breckinridge began reforms {{immediately}} and zealously. He secured the General Assembly's {{passage of a}} two-cent property <b>tax</b> <b>for</b> education. The tax was subject to voter approval, and Breckinridge worked hard to publicize the issue. His efforts paid off, as the tax passed by almost a two-to-one margin. Continuing to publicize needs and push legislators to action, Breckinridge enjoyed the support of {{five of the six}} governors under whom he served. Only John L. Helm, who opposed a state-funded school system, challenged him, but Helm's veto of a Breckinridge educational bill was overridden in the General Assembly. Breckinridge's reforms manifested tangible results. From 1847 to 1850, educational spending increased from $6,000 to $144,000. By 1850, only one out of every ten school age children did not attend school.|$|E
5|$|In 1901, the Democratic-dominated state {{legislature}} {{passed a bill}} requiring payment of a poll <b>tax</b> <b>for</b> voting, which effectively disenfranchised most blacks, and many poor whites and Latinos. In addition, the legislature established white primaries, ensuring that minorities {{were excluded from the}} formal political process. The number of voters dropped dramatically, and the Democrats crushed competition from the Republican and Populist parties. The Socialist Party became the second largest party in Texas after 1912, coinciding with a large socialist upsurge in the United States during fierce battles in the labor movement and the popularity of national heroes like Eugene V. Debs. The Socialists' popularity soon waned after their vilification by the United States government for their opposition to US involvement in World War I.|$|E
5|$|In February 1999, Braathens {{announced}} that they would re-register all their planes in Sweden {{to avoid having to}} pay value added tax on catering and fuel. Color Air and SAS, who had their planes registered abroad, had gotten away without paying the taxes, since it only applied to Norway-registered planes. Following this announcement, the Ministry of Finance changed the rules so also foreign-owned planes had to pay the tax. The change in rules cost Color Air NOK10 million per plane per year. From 1 July 1999, the seat tax was removed, but replaced by an equivalent <b>tax</b> <b>for</b> each passenger. This made it cheaper to fly an empty plane, but more expensive to fly a full one. Color Air had reduced the number of seats in each plane to avoid the seat tax, but increased them again after the tax was removed.|$|E

5|$|Industrial belts within Greater Dhaka {{is a major}} {{manufacturing}} hub, {{bounded by}} the Buriganga, Meghna, Dhaleshwari, Balu and Turag Rivers. The city has a growing middle class, driving the market for modern consumer and luxury goods. Restaurants, shopping malls and luxury hotels continue to serve as vital elements in the city's economy. The city has historically attracted numerous migrant workers. Hawkers, peddlers, small shops, rickshaw transport, roadside vendors and stalls employ {{a large segment of}} the population – rickshaw-drivers alone number as many as 400,000. Half the workforce is employed in household and unorganised labour, while about 800,000 work in the textile industry. The unemployment rate in Dhaka was 23% in 2013. Dhaka has improved congestion and inadequate infrastructure; the national government has recently implemented a policy for rapid urbanization of surrounding areas and beyond by the introduction of a ten-year relief on income <b>tax</b> <b>for</b> new construction of facilities and buildings outside Dhaka.|$|E
5|$|Starting in 1897, Clark {{attempted}} to secure protection for his holdings from the British South Africa Company. The Company took little notice of him.

The Company resolved to remove him from power, and did so in 1902. Clark then farmed for about two decades, with some success, and moved in the late 1910s to Broken Hill. There he became a prominent local figure, and a partner in the first licensed brewery in Northern Rhodesia. Remaining in Broken Hill {{for the rest of his}} life, he died there in 1927.|$|E
5|$|The General Assembly was {{controlled}} by Democrats, but Nunn was able to pass most of his agenda.

Nunn's budget focused on increased funding for education, mental health, and economic development. In the 1970 legislative session, the General Assembly enacted Nunn's proposals to eliminate taxes on prescription drugs and the use fee charged on vehicles transferred within families, but rejected his plans to reduce the income <b>tax</b> <b>for</b> low-income families and increase tax credits for the blind and the elderly.|$|E
