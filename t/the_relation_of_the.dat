5|$|Justinian's Chalke was a {{rectangular}} building, with four engaged piers supporting a central dome on pendentives, {{which in turn}} rested on four barrel arches in the typical Byzantine fashion. The piers {{to the south and}} north were somewhat lower than those to the east and west. The central structure was adjoined by two smaller chambers on either side to the south and north, each again featuring a vaulted roof. <b>The</b> <b>relation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Church of Christ Chalkites with the gate is unclear; Cyril Mango suggested that it was located to its left, but it has also been proposed that it was actually built atop the gatehouse itself. It is known that the chapel was placed atop an elevated platform, and 18th-century depictions locate it some 100 m southeast of the Hagia Sophia.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To examine <b>the</b> <b>relations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> family {{environment}} to adjustment to juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA), {{and to examine}} how those relations are influenced by child sex and age. METHOD: Ninety-four children with JRA completed a questionnaire on {{family environment}} and adjustment. RESULTS: Family cohesion was related to good adjustment, whereas family conflict was related to poor adjustment. Some <b>relations</b> <b>of</b> family cohesion to adjustment were stronger for younger than for older children. <b>The</b> <b>relations</b> <b>of</b> child autonomy to adjustment depended on child sex and age. CONCLUSION: <b>The</b> <b>relations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> family environment to adjustment to JRA are dependent on child sex and age...|$|R

25|$|In its {{original}} classification in 1907, the Scottish wildcat {{was listed as}} a full species, Felis grampia. However, it was soon revised to a subspecies, Felis sylvestris grampia, in 1912. There is continuing uncertainty about <b>the</b> <b>relation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Scottish wildcat to other European wildcats; some propose that it is indistinguishable from subspecies from continental Europe, or that all the wildcat subspecies are indistinct and {{should be treated as}} a single species. The subspecies name grampia likely comes from the name of a Scottish mountain range, the Grampian Mountains; the describer of the species did not explicitly state its etymology.|$|E
25|$|Nerthus {{is often}} {{identified}} with the van Njörðr who is attested in various 13th century Old Norse works and in numerous Scandinavian place names. The {{connection between the two}} is due to the linguistic relationship between Njörðr and the reconstructed Proto-Germanic *Nerþuz, Nerthus being the feminine, Latinized form of what Njörðr would have looked like around the first century. This has led to theories about <b>the</b> <b>relation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two, including that Njörðr may have once been a hermaphroditic deity or that the name may indicate the otherwise forgotten sister-wife in a divine brother-sister pair like the Vanir deities Freyja and Freyr.|$|E

25|$|A {{final step}} {{can be taken}} in {{relating}} the composite good to a unit of account such as money by setting {{the price of the}} composite good to 1. Since the prices of all other goods are known, the composite good can be converted into any combination of bundles that represent the optimal choice other than the first good. This final step clarifies <b>the</b> <b>relation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> model to the real world where many goods can be stated in terms of money value. In John R. Hicks's classic Value and Capital (1939), a composite good was used to generalize mathematically from consumer demand equilibrium for an individual in the 2-good case to market equilibrium via supply and demand in the n-good case.|$|E
