40|$|The BrainNet Europe {{consortium}} {{assessed the}} reproducibility in {{the assignment of}} the type of frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) with TAR DNA-binding protein (TDP) 43 following current recommendations. The agreement rates were influenced by <b>the</b> <b>immunohistochemical</b> (<b>IHC)</b> <b>method</b> and by the classification strategy followed. p 62 -IHC staining yielded good uniform quality of stains, but the most reliable results were obtained implementing specific Abs directed against the hallmark protein TDP 43. Both assessment of the type and the extent of lesions were influenced by the Abs and by the quality of stain. Assessment of the extent of the lesions yielded poor results repeatedly; thus, the extent of pathology should not be used in diagnostic consensus criteria. Whilst 31 neuropathologists typed 30 FTLD-TDP cases, inter-rater agreement ranged from 19 to 100 per cent, being highest when applying phosphorylated TDP 43 /IHC. The agreement was highest when designating Type C or Type A/B. In contrast, there was a poor agreement when attempting to separate Type A or Type B FTLD-TDP. In conclusion, we can expect that neuropathologist, independent of his/her familiarity with FTLD-TDP pathology, can identify a TDP 43 -positive FTLD case. The goal should be to state a Type (A, B, C, D) or a mixture of Types (A/B, A/C or B/C). Neuropathologists, other clinicians and researchers {{should be aware of the}} pitfalls whilst doing so. Agreement can be reached in an inter-laboratory setting regarding Type C cases with thick and long neurites, whereas the differentiation between Types A and B may be more troublesome...|$|E

40|$|Diffuse large B cell {{lymphoma}} (DLBCL) is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous disease. A small {{subset of}} DLBCLs has translocations involving the MYC locus {{and an additional}} group has a molecular signature resembling Burkitt lymphoma (mBL). Presently, identification of such cases by morphology is unreliable and relies on cytogenetic or complex molecular methods such as gene transcriptional profiling. Herein, we describe an <b>immunohistochemical</b> (<b>IHC)</b> <b>method</b> for identifying DLBCLs with increased MYC protein expression. We tested 77 cases of DLBCL and identified 15 cases with high MYC protein expression (nuclear staining in > 50 % of tumor cells). All MYC translocation positive cases had increased MYC protein expression by this IHC assay. In addition, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of the DLBCL transcriptional profiles revealed that tumors with increased MYC protein expression (regardless of underlying MYC translocation status) had coordinate upregulation of MYC target genes, providing molecular confirmation of the IHC results. We then generated a molecular classifier derived from the MYC IHC results in our cases and employed it to successfully classify mBLs from two previously reported independent case series, providing additional confirmation that the MYC IHC results identify clinically important subsets of DLBCLs. Lastly, we found that DLBCLs with high MYC protein expression had inferior overall survival when treated with R-CHOP.

Reliable <b>immunohistochemical</b> (<b>IHC)</b> <b>methods</b> {{to detect}} Aβ and Aβ-associated factors (AAF) in brain specimens are needed to determine their role in AD pathophysiology. Formic acid (FA) pre-treatment, which is generally used to enable efficient detection of Aβ with IHC, induces structural modifications within the Aβ, {{as well as in}} AAF. Consequently, interpretation of double IHC stainings becomes difficult. Therefore, serial stainings of two newly produced monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) VU- 17 and IC 16 and two other mAbs (6 E 10 and 3 D 6) were performed with four different pre-treatments (no pre-treatment, Tris/EDTA, citrate and FA) and additionally six IHC characteristics were scored: diffuse/compact/classic plaques, arteries with cerebral Aβ angiopathy, dyshoric angiopathy, capillaries with dyshoric angiopathy. Subsequently, these stainings were compared with IHC procedures, which are frequently used in a diagnostic setting, employing mAbs 4 G 8 and 6 F/ 3 D with FA pre-treatment. IHC Aβ patterns obtained with VU- 17 and, IC 16 and 3 D 6 without the use of FA pre-treatment were comparable to those obtained with 4 G 8 and 6 F/ 3 D upon FA pre-treatment. Omission of FA pre-treatment gives the advantage to allow double IHC stainings, detecting both Aβ and AAF that otherwise would have been structural modificated upon FA pre-treatment. © 2013 Informa UK Ltd.

40|$|Despite {{the fact}} that {{lubrication}} is a primary function of articular cartilage, there is little information on the frictional properties of cartilaginous engineered tissues. A biochemical mediator of cartilage frictional properties in boundary lubrication, lubricin, {{has been shown to}} be secreted from chondrocyte-hydrogel constructs. In the current studies we utilized articular chondrocytes (CON), meniscal fibrochondrocytes (MEN), and mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) in alginate cultures to determine lubricin localization and the inherent boundary lubrication friction coefficient. Additionally, we investigated the ability of these tissues to be lubricated by synovial fluid and the reversibility of this lubrication. Cell-alginate constructs were cultured over six weeks, culture medium assayed for lubricin release by ELISA and constructs analyzed with <b>immunohistochemical</b> (<b>IHC)</b> <b>methods</b> to investigate <b>the</b> localization of lubricin. Engineered tissues were tested in a custom friction instrument to determine the equilibrium friction coefficient (µeq) in boundary lubrication mode, following incubation with equine synovial fluid (SF), and subsequent extraction in l. 5 M NaCl. MSCs released 10 fold more lubricin than CON or MEN cultures. IHC analysis showed no localization of lubricin to alginate, minimal focal staining of engineered constructs at six weeks in culture, and the ability of all engineered tissues to localize lubricin when exogenously treated with SF. Frictional characterization showed no difference in µeq over culture for all engineered tissues, while incubation in SF decreased µeq for all tissues over culture duration, and extraction of lubricin resulted in a loss of lubrication of all engineered tissues...|$|R

40|$|A {{prospective}} {{observational study}} {{in a university}} hospital setting to study <b>the</b> <b>immunohistochemical</b> (<b>IHC)</b> characteristics of non-neoplastic human lacrimal sac epithelium. Twenty paraffin-embedded specimens of human lacrimal sac were studied using monospecific monoclonal antibodies to 34 beta E 12, cell adhesion molecule (CAM 5. 2), epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), cytokeratins (CK) 7 and 20, estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor. The distribution and histologic location of IHC staining were examined qualitatively, and the IHC stains scored as positive (+) or negative (-). The haematoxylin-eosin stains were reviewed for tissue morphology. All 20 specimens were positive for 34 beta E 12, CAM 5. 2, EMA and CK 7 and negative for CK 20, estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor. To our knowledge, {{this is the first}} study to characterize the IHC properties of human lacrimal sac epithelium. This epithelium appears to possess consistent IHC properties as it stains for 34 beta E 12, CAM 5. 2, EMA and CK 7 and this information would be potentially useful in differentiating tumours arising in the region of the lacrimal sac.

40|$|Summary: <b>The</b> <b>immunohistochemical</b> (<b>IHC)</b> {{localization}} of oestrogen receptor alpha (ERα) was {{studied in}} the developing left ovary of 14. 5 -day-old chick embryos. The study was focused in particular on distinguishing in cortex and medulla the different cell categories that proved positive to the reaction, {{in order to gain}} further understanding of gonadal cell interactions during ovarian development. Immunostained cells were observed in both the cortex and medulla, but the reactivity for ERα was discontinuous, probably due to variable cell requirements. In the cortex, positivity was observed in cells of the ovarian surface epithelium, in germ cells and in prefollicular cells. In the medulla, positivity was found in the following cell categories: interstitial cells, poorly differentiated somatic cord cells, including those delimiting lacunae, germ cells and their accompanying cells of epithelial origin. Furthermore, the IHC results showed that the intracellular localization of the antigen was cytoplasmic, nuclear, or both. The significance of ERα presence and intracellular localization was discussed in relation and as supplementary to previous research by various Authors. In particular, as regards the unusual cytoplasmic immunoreactivity, a gradual shift of ERα localization from cytoplasmic to nuclear during the embryonic period is suggested. © 2010 Blackwell Verlag GmbH...|$|R
