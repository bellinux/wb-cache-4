Nokian Tyres designed the first winter tyres in 1934 and has more winter tyre patents than any other manufacturer. Nokian Tyres {{is known for its}} winter tyres, {{not to be confused with}} all-season tyres. Nokian winter tyres have been described as a favourite of critics and have been well received in winter test results by several publications. Nokian also has designed some winter tyre models with low rolling resistance, offering lower fuel consumption. Nokian was the first company to produce a tyre that allowed for year-round use by having different tread patterns on the lateral and medial aspect of <b>the</b> <b>tread.</b> One pattern is optimised for winter and another pattern is designed as an all-season pattern.|$|E
25|$|The shelters {{are made}} from aluminum, steel, and glass. Air {{ventilation}} works through fins on the aluminum part of the shelters. Floors {{are made from}} tread plate, although newer shelters now use concrete. The shelters are equipped with platform screen doors. Some of the connecting elevated bridge ramps have gentle slopes (with some exceptions) to accommodate the disabled. One disadvantage {{of some of the}} ramps is that passengers need to walk a relatively long way up the ramps and then double back to reach the boarding shelters. The floors of the bridge are mostly tread plates although some are made from concrete. One problem with <b>the</b> <b>tread</b> plate is that considerable noise is generated by the movement of passengers across <b>the</b> <b>tread</b> plate surfaces. Another problem is that some of <b>the</b> <b>tread</b> plate surfaces can become very slippery during the rainy season. There are no sanitary facilities in most of the shelters.|$|E

2500|$|This is {{independent}} of the wheel taper, but depends on {{the ratio of the}} axle load to wheel set mass. If the treads were truly conical in shape, the critical speed would be independent of the taper. [...] In practice, wear on the wheel causes the taper to vary across <b>the</b> <b>tread</b> width, so that the value of taper used to determine the potential energy is different from that used to calculate the kinetic energy. [...] Denoting the former as a, the critical speed becomes: ...|$|E
2500|$|Western saddles have {{significantly}} wider stirrups, particularly at <b>the</b> <b>tread,</b> to minimize this risk. [...] Sometimes, they {{are equipped with}} tapaderos, leather covers over the toe that close each stirrup from the front. [...] A tapadero prevents the rider's boot from slipping through and also prevents brush encountered while working cattle on the open range from poking through the stirrup, injuring or impeding the horse or rider. [...] However, the tapadero is not common in modern times and is not allowed in most show competition.|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the most}} {{dangerous}} problems with the stirrup is that the rider can get a boot stuck in it {{in the event of a}} fall, which would result in the person being dragged. [...] Several different designs have been developed to allow the stirrup to break away, fall off or easily release the foot if the rider falls. [...] Other modern stirrup designs have changed the angle or orientation of <b>the</b> <b>tread,</b> either permanently or by added hinges, supposedly to help the rider flex the ankle and get weight into the heels. [...] Other experimental improvements have included a swivel feature at the top of the leather to keep the stirrup turned out to face the rider's foot.|$|E

Although the East Room's oak floors had been bare since 1903, three matching $259,330 wool carpets were installed in February 1995. These carpets, ordered in 1990, were designed to reflect the plaster ceiling moldings created during the John Quincy Adams administration in the late 1820s. Woven by Edward Fields Inc. of New York and paid for with private donations raised by the White House Endowment Fund, the carpets were designed to cover most of the floor {{to protect it from}} dirt and the occasional pebble stuck in <b>the</b> <b>tread</b> of a shoe.|$|E
2500|$|The train {{stays on}} the track {{by virtue of the}} conical shape of the wheel treads.

[...] The angular velocity is the same for both wheels (they are coupled via a rigid axle), so the larger diameter tread speeds up, while the smaller slows down.
