Oshii commented that his first thought to find {{an image of the}} future setting was an Asian city, but finding a {{suitable}} cityscape of the future would be impossible. Oshii chose to use the real streets of Hong Kong as his model. He also said that Hong Kong was the perfect subject and theme for the film with its countless signs and <b>the</b> <b>cacophony</b> of sounds. The film's mecha designer Takeuchi Atsushi noted that while the film does not have a chosen setting, it is obviously based on Hong Kong because the city represented the theme of the film, {{the old and the new}} which exist in a strange relationship in an age of an information deluge. Before shooting the film, the artists drew sketches that emphasized Hong Kong's chaotic, confusing and overwhelming aspects.|$|E
5|$|Ermac plays a {{supporting}} role in the plot of Mortal Kombat X (2015), in which he remains loyal to Shao Kahn's successors to the Outworld throne, first Mileena and then Kotal Kahn as they fight for the realm's rule {{in the midst of}} a civil war. He ultimately sides with Kotal Kahn upon the revelation that Mileena is not the true heir to the throne, as she is a genetic creation and not Shao Kahn's biological daughter. Ermac joins forces with Kotal Kahn, Reptile, Erron Black, and Ferra/Torr, and during a battle between the Outworlders and Cassie Cage's Special Forces unit, he is immune to Kenshi's son Takeda's telepathy due to <b>the</b> <b>cacophony</b> of souls inside his body, but he is then beaten by Takeda. Near the conclusion, Jax's daughter Jacqui Briggs exacts revenge on Ermac for destroying her father's arms when she defeats him in combat. In his ending, Ermac returns to Shao Kahn's abandoned fortress in search of a voice summoning him when his souls are suddenly consumed by a resurrected Shang Tsung, leaving Ermac in a weakened state. He additionally appears in the closing panel of Kotal Kahn's ending as one of Kahn's chosen warriors (with Reptile, Erron Black, Ferra, and Torr) who fight in Mortal Kombat every decade in attempt to regain Kahn's Outworld sovereignty from Raiden.|$|E

25|$|The {{relationship}} between the binding problem and multisensory perception {{can be thought of}} as a question – the binding problem, and potential solution – multisensory perception. The binding problem stemmed from unanswered questions about how mammals (particularly higher primates) generate a unified, coherent perception of their surroundings from <b>the</b> <b>cacophony</b> of electromagnetic waves, chemical interactions, and pressure fluctuations that forms the physical basis of the world around us. It was investigated initially in the visual domain (colour, motion, depth, and form), then in the auditory domain, and recently in the multisensory areas. It can be said therefore, that the binding problem is central to multisensory perception.|$|E

500|$|Hopemead State Park is {{currently}} undeveloped 70 acre {{park on the}} eastern shore of the lake. The land was originally Solomon Gardner's farm until it was purchased as a summer getaway by the Fuller family. The property was named Camp Charmarlou, an acronym from Fuller's three daughters, and contained a house and an artist's studio. Camp Charmarlou was used a boys camp {{for a number of years}} with permission by the Fuller family. It was later renamed Hopemead, literally [...] "Hope Meadow", by the Fuller daughters who believed it to be a sanctuary with spiritual overtones. In 1954, the land was donated to the State of Connecticut to become a state park. The state found the land is unsuitable for development and demolished the dilapidated buildings, with the intention of letting Hopemead return to a natural state. Joseph Leary notes that the wildlife has thrived in the area, but notes that <b>the</b> <b>cacophony</b> of noises and calls is simply [...] "divine". The park offers opportunities for hiking and fishing.|$|E
500|$|Art {{historian}} and curator Ugochukwu-Smooth Nzewi described Ogboh's work as capturing [...] "the maddening hyper-visuality of Lagos". Ogboh was among Nzewi's most anticipated artists at the 2014 contemporary African art festival [...] In 2013, Ogboh reported reception of his Lagos Soundscapes as mixed: annoying some and intriguing others. Quiet European cities {{have considered the}} work [...] "noisy and obtrusive", in one case destroying a speaker and calling the police on the installation. The artist appreciated the installation's effect on Nigerians abroad, and how being in earshot of the soundscape confused them in their foreign environment. Art historian Carol Magee noted how even {{in the business of}} the Lagos Soundscapes, she felt a stillness in which her attention was focused and the patterns unchanging despite <b>the</b> <b>cacophony</b> of the scene. Malawian visual artist Massa Lemu described Ogboh's work as embodying Afropolitanism, in which African cities were representative of a busy, globalized world and its multiple cultures centralized in one place. Lemu thought of Ogboh's soundscapes as [...] "auditory landscapes" [...] that recreate a sense of the Lagos environment. He additionally compared Ogboh's practice with that of sound artists James Webb (South Africa) and Magdi Mostafa (Egypt), though these two tend to manipulate their recordings where Ogboh instead recontextualizes the original. For this reason, Lemu considered Ogboh's work to be closer in lineage to John Cage's recontextualized found sounds than the practice of El Anatsui or Romuald Hazoume recycling found objects as commentary on economic conditions.|$|E

He asked John Law, who also had experience on the dry lake and was a defining founder of Cacophony Society, to take on central organizing functions.

The gray, ocher, beige, and brown colors, often identified with the rigor of Cubist thought, suggest the grimy, smoky city atmosphere, although Gleizes has enlivened this neutral palette by including bright greens and reds as well as creamy white highlights. The large size of the painting contrasts with the intimately scaled Cubist works of Picasso and Braque, reflecting the destination Gleizes envisioned for his work: the public salons of Paris, where he exhibited in the hope of bringing Cubism to wider audiences.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Numerous {{policies}} have been proposed to address the public health problem of obesity, resulting in a policy <b>cacophony.</b> <b>The</b> noise of so many policy options renders it difficult for policymakers to determine which policies warrant implementation. This has resulted in calls for more and better evidence to support obesity policy. However, {{it is not clear}} that evidence is the solution. This paper argues that to address <b>the</b> policy <b>cacophony</b> it is necessary to rethink the problem of obesity, and more specifically, how the problem of obesity is framed. This paper argues that the frame “obesity” be replaced by the frame “caloric overconsumption”, concluding that the frame caloric overconsumption can overcome <b>the</b> obesity policy <b>cacophony.</b> Discussion Frames are important because they influence public policy. Understood as packages that define issues, frames influence how best to approach a problem. Consequently, debates over public policy are considered battles over framing, with small shifts in how an issue is framed resulting in significant changes to the policy environment. This paper presents a rationale for reframing the problem of obesity as caloric overconsumption. The frame “obesity” contributes to <b>the</b> policy <b>cacophony</b> by including policies aimed at both energy output and energy input. However, research increasingly demonstrates that energy input is the primary cause of obesity, and that increases in energy input are largely attributable to the food environment. By focusing on policies that aim to prevent increases in energy input, the frame caloric overconsumption will reduce the noise of <b>the</b> obesity policy <b>cacophony.</b> While <b>the</b> proposed frame will face some challenges, particularly industry opposition, policies aimed at preventing caloric overconsumption have a clearer focus, and can be more politically palatable if caloric overconsumption is seen as an involuntary risk resulting from the food environment. Summary The paper concludes that policymakers will be able to make better sense of <b>the</b> obesity policy <b>cacophony</b> if <b>the</b> problem of obesity is reframed as caloric overconsumption. By focusing on a specific cause of obesity, energy input, the frame caloric overconsumption allows policymakers to focus on the most promising obesity prevention policies. </p...|$|R

In all this noise and confusion, Tunny unobtrusively slipped away to the north. Later, examination of Japanese records showed that this attack was ruined by prematures and duds, and that damage to the enemy had been minor.
