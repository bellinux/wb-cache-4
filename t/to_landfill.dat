5|$|Food waste remains {{primarily}} disposed <b>to</b> <b>landfill</b> (54 {{per cent}} of total municipal waste was disposed of {{in this way}} in 2007/8), although year-on-year the amount being sent <b>to</b> <b>landfill</b> is decreasing.|$|E
5|$|Internationally, food waste's {{effect on}} the {{environment}} has been an issue. Ireland is facing fines of millions of euros if the amount of biodegradable waste it sends <b>to</b> <b>landfill</b> does not fall below the maximum quantity set by the European Union's Landfill Directive. By 2010, the same directive will impose fines of £40m a year across England, rising to £205m by 2013, if its own targets on biodegradable municipal waste are not met; the amount of biodegradable municipal waste being sent <b>to</b> <b>landfill</b> in 2010 must be 75% of that sent in 1995, by 2013 it must be 50% and by 2020 it must be 35%.|$|E
5|$|In 1996 Canberra {{became the}} first {{city in the world}} to set a vision of no waste, proposing an ambitious target of 2010 for completion.

By early 2010, it was apparent that though it had reduced waste going <b>to</b> <b>landfill,</b> the ACT initiative's original 2010 target for absolutely zero landfill waste would be delayed or revised to meet the reality.|$|E

5|$|Waste {{management}} and recycling are co-ordinated by Poole Borough Council {{in partnership with}} Viridor. Locally produced inert waste is sent <b>to</b> <b>landfill</b> for disposal. Recycle waste is taken to Viridor's Materials Recycling Facility in Crayford for processing. Poole's distribution network operator for electricity is Scottish and Southern Energy. Drinking and waste water is managed by Wessex Water; groundwater sources in Wiltshire and Dorset provide 75% of drinking water, the rest comes from reservoirs fed by rivers and streams.|$|E

For example, in California nearly 60% of the state's waste comes from commercial buildings During the construction phase, one {{goal should be}} {{to reduce the amount of}} material going <b>to</b> <b>landfills.</b> Well-designed buildings also help reduce the amount of waste generated by the occupants as well, by providing on-site solutions such as compost bins to reduce matter going <b>to</b> <b>landfills.</b>|$|R
40|$|Recycling plays a {{major role}} in global society. Waste is a big issue and {{countries}} are struggling with ways to keep the situation under control. Japan is a model country in terms of recycling. Their efforts have surpassed many countries. Japan has recently passed a number of laws that have helped the country's recycling issues. These laws have produced tremendous results in Japan's favor. Through enforcement of these laws the country sends only 16 % of its solid waste <b>to</b> <b>landfills.</b> The United States sends close to 70 % <b>to</b> <b>landfills.</b> Consumer recycling in Japan is much more advanced than the United States. Waste is separated into categories to maximize the recycling process and to minimize waste sent <b>to</b> <b>landfills.</b> The U. S. should be modeling their recycling efforts toward the Japan recycling model...|$|R

5|$|Waste {{management}} is handled by Angus Council. There is a kerbside recycling scheme {{that has been}} in operation since May 2004. Cans, glass, paper and plastic bottles are collected on a weekly basis. Compostable material and non-recyclable material are collected on alternate weeks. Roughly two thirds of non-recyclable material is sent <b>to</b> <b>landfill</b> at Angus Council's site at Lochhead, Forfar and the remainder sent for incineration (with energy recovery) outside the council area.|$|E
5|$|Waste {{management}} is {{handled by the}} local authority, Fife Council. Kerbside recycling operates in the town. A three-bin collection is {{in place for the}} majority of residents.

5|$|Waste {{to energy}} plants are {{strictly}} monitored, {{and the plant}} has achieved various ISO external certificates. The plant is seen {{to be at the}} forefront of sustainable energy production and waste disposal.

5|$|Food {{waste is}} {{generally}} considered to have a damaging effect on the environment; a reduction in food waste is considered critical if the UK is to meet obligations under the European Landfill Directive to reduce biodegradable waste going <b>to</b> <b>landfill</b> and favourable considering international targets on climate change, limiting greenhouse gas emissions. When disposed of in landfill, food waste releases methane, a relatively damaging greenhouse gas, and leachate, a toxin capable of considerable groundwater pollution. The food supply chain accounts for a fifth of UK carbon emissions; the production, storage and transportation of food to homes requires large amounts of energy. The effects of stopping food waste that can potentially be prevented has been likened to removing one in five cars from UK roads.|$|E
5|$|Episodes one and {{two were}} {{directed}} by Ciaran Donnelly, episode three by Simon Delaney and episode four by Tim Sullivan. Ripley was in the late stages of pregnancy and permitted to work for only {{a short amount of}} time, so the fourth episode was filmed before the third. Ripley did not travel to Portmeirion {{with the rest of the}} cast, so a make-up artist stood in as Jenny in the beach and clifftop scenes, wearing the prosthetic stomach originally made for Ripley in the first series. A close-up of Jenny standing next to Jo was filmed in front of a similar backdrop in Manchester and edited into the location footage. The producers endeavoured to film on location once per series but the high cost of the Sydney episode and the rising salaries of the cast meant the budget could not permit travel any further than Portmeirion, a village most famous as the location in The Prisoner. Rachel's car accident was filmed on location in Moston, Greater Manchester in the early hours of 6 October 2002. Following the completion of filming, the sets were dismantled and moved <b>to</b> <b>landfill</b> sites.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWaste {{management}} {{is a process}} which will never end. Today, people produce more waste than ever. Consequently, bigger amounts of waste go <b>to</b> <b>landfills,</b> but it also forces the municipal companies to invent and introduce new solutions to increase the level of waste directed to recovery. It {{has been known for}} years that the landfilling is the worst solution for waste management, as such waste has a significant negative impact on the environment and people. That is why the municipal companies are seeking to implement solutions to decrease the amount of waste going <b>to</b> <b>landfills.</b> The same actions are undertaken by the Municipal Waste Company from Czestochowa, and the research study conducted by the authors of this article focuses on evaluating its effectiveness. The main aim of this article was to present and evaluate the amounts of municipal waste directed <b>to</b> <b>landfills</b> or recovery, levels of energy, water and materials usage and checking the level of sold recyclable materials and compost...|$|R

30|$|Disposal {{of kitchen}} waste, which {{contains}} about 80 % of moisture <b>to</b> the <b>landfills,</b> causes various problems like easy putrefaction, offensive odour and pollution of ground and surface water by leachate (Rogoshewski et al. 1983; Wang et al. 2001). Due to interruption {{of the carbon}} cycle by disposal of waste <b>to</b> <b>landfills,</b> organic kitchen waste requires proper composting system to reduce its uncontrolled degradation on disposal sites and subsequent greenhouse gases, odour and nutrient emissions (Luostarinen and Rintala 2007). In addition, kitchen waste may be wasted if it is just dumped <b>to</b> <b>landfills</b> as it will break up naturally and never be used directly again, having its nutritious matter lost within the waste. Therefore, a kitchen waste composter was designed to allow the composting process to be conducted in a consistent manner.|$|R

40|$|A widely cited 1991 study {{predicted}} that nearly 150 million personal computers (PCs) {{would be sent}} <b>to</b> <b>landfills</b> by 2005. Taking into consideration newer end-of-life disposition options now available, the general premise of the original study is reconsidered. Many fewer computers are being sent <b>to</b> <b>landfills,</b> as many more are being recycled as markets for used computers and electronic equipment develop. Many are still being stored, despite the unprofitable nature of storage. The updated model suggests that nearly 150 million computers will be recycled in 2005 – the same number initially predicted <b>to</b> be <b>landfilled.</b> Instead, we predict that only 55 million will be landfilled. In addition, the equivalent of 15 million PCs will be landfilled from the unused portions of the 150 million recycled computers.
