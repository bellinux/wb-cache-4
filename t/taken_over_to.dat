5|$|Immediately after Luna's death, {{confusion}} reigned on both sides. The Americans {{even thought}} Luna had <b>taken</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> replace Aguinaldo. Luna's death was publicly declared only by 8 June, and a circular providing {{details of the}} event released by 13 June. While investigations were supposedly made concerning Luna's death, not one person was convicted. Later, General Pantaleon García {{said that it was}} he who was verbally ordered by Aguinaldo to conduct the assassination of Luna at Cabanatuan. His sickness at the time prevented his participation in the assassination. Aguinaldo would be firm in his stand that {{he had nothing to do}} with the assassination of Luna.|$|E
5|$|As the 18 fireships {{prepared}} in Britain by Mulgrave {{had not yet}} departed {{by the time of}} Cochrane's arrival with the fleet, the captain responding by converting his own over the following week. A number of chasse-marées carrying tar and resin perfect for this role had been captured by the blockade, and Cochrane requisitioned eight military transport ships from the fleet reserve for conversion using these materials. The frigate-storeship HMS Mediator was <b>taken</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> be the centrepiece of the attack force. These vessels were laden with explosives and combustible materials such as rum-soaked hay, and crewed by volunteers from the fleet. On three of the vessels Cochrane had loaded 1,500 barrels of gunpowder, topped by hundreds of artillery shells and thousands of grenades to create an explosion ship, a floating bomb of his own design intended to detonate {{right in the middle of}} the French line. During this process an attack by French boats on the fireships was driven off, with two British sailors killed and one wounded, and on 5 April Cochrane reconnoitered the approaches to Aix Roads, firing shots at the forts and fleet to gauge their responses. He subsequently wrote to Mulgrave suggesting that with an expeditionary force of 20,000 he could seize the defences overlooking the anchorage, sink blockships in the channel and thereby permanently deprive the French of one of their most important naval bases, although his letter was ignored.|$|E

25|$|London buses {{continued}} to {{operate under the}} London Transport name from 1933 to 2000, although the political management of transport services changed several times. The LPTB oversaw transport from 1933 to 1947 until it was re-organised into the London Transport Executive (1948 to 1962). Responsibility for London Transport was subsequently <b>taken</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the London Transport Board (1963 to 1969), the Greater London Council (1970 to 1984) and London Regional Transport (1984 to 2000).|$|E
25|$|Nylon mania came to {{an abrupt}} stop at the end of 1941 when the USA entered World War II. The {{production}} capacity that had been built up to produce nylon stockings, or just nylons, for American women was <b>taken</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> manufacture vast numbers of parachutes for fliers and paratroopers. After the war ended, DuPont went back to selling nylon to the public, engaging in another promotional campaign in 1946 that resulted in an even bigger craze, triggering the so-called nylon riots.|$|E

25|$|A {{few years}} after its foundation, Montevideo became the main city of the region north of the Río de la Plata and east of the Uruguay River, {{competing}} with Buenos Aires for dominance in maritime commerce. The importance of Montevideo as the main port of the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata brought it in confrontations {{with the city of}} Buenos Aires in various occasions, including several times when it was <b>taken</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> be used as a base to defend the eastern province of the Viceroyalty from Portuguese incursions.|$|E
25|$|Robert Rupen {{reports that}} in the 1920s there were over 112,000 Mongolian Buddhist monks, {{representing}} more than 13% of Mongolia's overall population. By the 1940s, nearly every monk was either dead or had apostatized. In 1938 — amid accusations that the church and monasteries were trying {{to cooperate with the}} Japanese, who were promoting a pan-Mongol puppet state — the remaining monasteries were dissolved, their property was seized, and their monks were secularized, interned or executed. Those monastic buildings that had not been destroyed were <b>taken</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> serve as local government offices or schools. Only then was the ruling party, which since 1921 gradually had built a cadre of politically reliable and secularly educated administrators, able to destroy the church and to mobilize the country's wealth and population for its program of modernization and social change.|$|E
25|$|Significant loss {{of rights}} and {{privileges}} resulted from the change to an academic Lyceum. Legal jurisdiction over professors and students was no more: in 1783 the right to award Masters and Doctoral degrees {{was taken over by}} the Emperor (Bachelor degrees in philosophy were however awarded until 1821), and lectures were significantly cut back. However, after the death of Joseph II the situation gradually eased. Theology courses were restored to a full five years, while Philosophy was extended to three years and by 1810 Legal Studies took four years. By 1804 the Lyceum had some 730 students, which was comparable with University of Prague's 760. In 1805 studies were temporarily suspended, as many students entered the Army during the Napoleonic Wars. Another suspension of lectures took place in 1809 because the Lyceum's buildings were <b>taken</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> accommodate army personnel. In 1826, there were altogether 26 professors at the Lyceum.|$|E

25|$|Passenger rail in California {{during the}} early 20th Century was {{dominated}} by private companies. The San Diego Electric Railway, founded by John D. Spreckels in 1892, was the major transit system in the San Diego area during that period. In the Los Angeles area, real estate tycoon Henry Huntington established both the Los Angeles Railway, {{also known as the}} Yellow Car system, and the Pacific Electric, also known as the Red Car system, in 1901. Business magnate Francis Marion Smith then created the Key System in 1903 to connect San Francisco with the East Bay. All four streetcar systems, and other similar rail networks across the state, declined in the 1940s with the rise of California's car culture and freeway network. They were then all eventually <b>taken</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> some degree, and dismantled, in favor of bus service by National City Lines, a controversial national front company owned by General Motors and other companies in {{what became known as the}} General Motors streetcar conspiracy.|$|E

2500|$|In 1970, Moynihan wrote {{a memo to}} President Nixon saying, [...] "The {{time may}} have come when {{the issue of race}} could benefit from a period of 'benign neglect'.

2500|$|An {{estimate}} {{was prepared for}} all this work and amounted, including restoration of {{part of the old}} front up to the Tower, to £3,200.

The old tracery of the Chapel and Library windows, renewed during the restoration, was <b>taken</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> Denton House near Cuddesdon, where some alterations were made by a relative of the then Warden of All Souls. It was built into the wall surrounding the garden, the east window being set up entire. The south wall was left till 1848 and the ante-chapel until 1869, when plans were sent for refacing it in stone, and for restoring the pinnacles in Tainton stone, at the cost of £940 16s. This work was then carried out.|$|E

2500|$|Part of Ebrington Barracks {{was handed}} over to the Royal Navy in mid-1941 and the entire barracks came under Admiralty command in 1943 as RN Barracks Ebrington, part of the Londonderry shore base known as HMS Ferret. [...] The old North of Ireland {{shipyard}} at Pennyburn was also <b>taken</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> be used as a ship repair facility, manned by workers from the Harland and Wolff yard at Belfast. Ships based at Ferret were under the operational control of Western Approaches Command, located in Plymouth for {{the early part of the}} war. [...] The main headquarters for the Western Approaches Command was moved to Liverpool in February 1941 as the North Western Approaches became the most vital area of convoy activity. [...] Ferret was then the backup for the Liverpool headquarters, with the other main bases in the area being at Greenock, and later at Belfast. The organisational function of Ferret was to form escort groups of the warships based there, mostly small destroyers, frigates, corvettes and armed trawlers. From 1 February 1941 these craft had a separate accounting system from the main base. [...] By 1942 this system had been extended to handle the accounts of Royal Navy ships based at St' John's and Argentia. [...] A Coastal Forces base was established in April 1941, under the name HMS Ferret II.|$|E
