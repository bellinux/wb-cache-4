25|$|On 5 September 2007 Wright {{made his}} One Day International debut against India at The Oval, London; hitting {{a half century}} in a 106 run 6th wicket stand with Middlesex batsmen Owais Shah. Wright was run out on 50, by a matter of inches after facing just 39 balls, and {{received}} a standing ovation. In his second match at Lords he was out for a second ball duck. He also <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> low catch to remove Gautam Gambhir.|$|E
25|$|Noted for his sportsmanlike conduct on the field, on one {{occasion}} during a game he helped an opponent Don Cordner {{to his feet and}} also once applauded another opponent Bill Morris after he <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> mark. This rubbed coach Fred Froude and the St Kilda committee up the wrong way and when McIntyre was relegated to 19th man for a game in 1948 he resigned and switched to Collingwood. He appeared in his first ever final series that year, kicking two goals in Collingwood's losing Preliminary Final against Melbourne.|$|E

Adrian Sutil {{retired after}} a large engine failure going towards the Stowe corner. Toyota suffered the worst problems as both of their cars {{went out of the}} race, Ralf Schumacher retiring with a wheel fixation problem, and his team mate, Trulli retiring with handling problems. Anthony Davidson, after a good weekend of practice and an unlucky qualifying session, had to retire his Super Aguri car when he felt vibrations from the underside of the car. Liuzzi retired his car with gearbox failure but was ultimately still classified in 16th place.|$|E

25|$|Zimbabwe battled well on {{the first}} day of the two-Test series with India, as opening batsman Terry Duffin survived early jitters to become the first Zimbabwean to make a half-century on debut since Stuart Matsikenyeri, while the team made their highest score since the tour of Bangladesh last season. Duffin and Brendan Taylor started {{reasonably}} well, adding 25 before Taylor inside edged onto his pad and the ball popped up to Gautam Gambhir who <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> catch. Hamilton Masakadza stepped in, and looked quite settled before gloving the ball down the leg side to the wicket-keeper for 14. Dion Ebrahim survived with Duffin until lunch, however, as Zimbabwe made their way to 75 for 2.|$|E
25|$|Felipe Massa stalled on the grid, {{leading to}} a second {{formation}} lap and causing the Brazilian to start from the pit lane, joining Takuma Sato, who also started from the pits. Hamilton led from the start with Räikkönen closely following and Alonso a few seconds behind them. Hamilton led the race until lap sixteen, {{when he made his}} stop and rejoined in fifth; his car briefly lurched forward with the fuel hose attached when Hamilton reacted to the 'lollipop' board being turned over. Räikkönen stopped three laps later and came out of the pit in front of Hamilton to take the race lead. Another three laps later Alonso <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> pit stop and came out in front of both of the previous race leaders.|$|E
25|$|Australia's woes on {{the field}} were {{magnified}} by Laxman and Dravid's stubborn partnership on the third day, but their misery was to continue when {{it was discovered that}} one of Australia's bowlers, Brad Williams had injured his shoulder while fielding and that he would require a month to be back in action. The bad day which was to unfold for the Australians began with a square cut from Rahul Dravid on the first ball of the day from Stuart MacGill. He had taken 386 balls for the milestone. After reaching his double hundred, Dravid continue in fine nick, cover driving a ball from Gillespie to extra cover boundary for four, going past Ravi Shastri's record for the highest score in Australia against Australia by an Indian. His monumental innings-it lasted for well over 9 hours-ended when he top-edged a pull off Gillespie to Bichel, who <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>good,</b> tumbling catch.|$|E

25|$|To {{bolster the}} Tasmanian team Colin McDonald of Victoria was shipped over with Jim Burke, Norm O'Neill and Peter Philpott of New South Wales. Terence Cowley won the toss {{and put the}} MCC in to bat rather than face Frank Tyson, Fred Trueman, Peter Loader and Ted Dexter on a green wicket in English-style conditions. Willie Watson (43) and Arthur Milton (83) put on 99 for the first wicket, Peter May (80) and the out-of-form Colin Cowdrey (72) 123 for the fifth wicket and the M.C.C batted into the second day before declaring on 384/9, Cowley taking 5/92. McDonald used a heavy bat and made 104 before he threw his wicket away in what was {{obviously}} {{going to be a}} draw. No other batsman made 30 and the wickets were shared around five of the seven bowlers used, Tyson (3/60) being the best, though Trueman <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> one-handed catch off Mortimore to dismiss O'Neill for 20. The tourists batted out the last afternoon, Watson making 42 and Graveney 52 in their 162/4.|$|E
25|$|David O. Stewart, in his {{biography}} of Burr, American Emperor, {{notes that the}} reports of Hamilton's intentionally missing Burr with his shot began {{to be published in}} newspaper reports in papers friendly to Hamilton only in the days after his death. But Ron Chernow, in {{his biography}}, Alexander Hamilton, states Hamilton told numerous friends well before the duel of his intention to avoid firing at Burr. Additionally, Hamilton wrote a number of letters, including a Statement on Impending Duel With Aaron Burr and his last missives to his wife dated before the duel, that also attest to this intention. The two shots, witnesses reported, followed one another in close succession, and none of those witnesses could agree as to who fired first. Prior to the duel proper, Hamilton <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> deal of time getting used to the feel and weight of the pistol (which had been used in the duel at the same Weehawken site in which his 19-year-old son had been killed), as well as putting on his eyeglasses in order to see his opponent more clearly. The seconds placed Hamilton so that Burr would have the rising sun behind him, and during the brief duel, one witness reported, Hamilton seemed to be hindered by this placement as the sun was in his eyes.|$|E
500|$|Games journalists regard Undead Nightmare {{as among}} the best {{expansion}}s. Kotaku wrote of its originality, despite the trite zombie theme, and added that the expansion functioned best when Rockstar used the game's silly pretense to exercise their sense of humor, with undead versions of normal animals, and new mythical creatures. The reviewer related the game's level of entertainment to it being the first Rockstar release in years to [...] "wholeheartedly embrace the inherently madcap nature of open world games". Undead Nightmare <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> title and [...] "put it over the top", as USgamer put it. Hardcore Gamer cited the expansion {{as an example of}} downloadable content that would have never fit in the main game but instead let the developers explore other ideas.|$|E

The negatives of the film were [...] "cleaned up at a lab" [...] prior to release, and the film was released at Shanthi theatre, where it could not originally be released in 1964. Despite being a re-release, the film earned public acclaim and <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> opening, running to one-hundred percent theatre occupancy for three days, and became a commercial success. In 2013, production house Sai Ganesh Films announced that the film's digitally restored version would be released in 2014, 50 years since the original release in 1964, but this did not happen. The film was screened at the Russian Cultural Centre Auditorium in Alwarpet on 14 September 2014.|$|E
2500|$|It is said in Sturlunga saga that Sturla Þórðarson entertained King Magnús lagabœtir with a {{story about}} Huld in 1263, which he told [...] "better and more cleverly than any of those present had heard before" [...] (betr ok fróðligar en nokkurr þeira hafði fyrr heyrt, er þar váru).

2500|$|During World War II, the [...] "50 mission crush" [...] cap {{was popular}} among aircrews of the United States Army Air Forces. Bomber and fighter aircrews {{had to wear}} {{headsets}} over their service cap during flight, so they would remove the stiffening wire from the cap. The headset would then crush the cap, which would eventually retain its crushed appearance. Since it <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> many missions to properly achieve the look, a so-called [...] "50-mission crush" [...] cap was considered {{a sign of a}} seasoned combat veteran. Current US Air Force regulations prohibit the wearing of such caps.|$|E
