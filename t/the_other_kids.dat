5|$|Meanwhile, {{the shark}} attacks <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>kids,</b> hitting {{one of their}} boats, and causing most of them to capsize and crash into {{each other in the}} ensuing panic, {{throwing}} several of them, including Mike and Sean, into the water. The other teens help them out of the water while two of them pull Mike out as the shark goes for him and head back to get help. Sean and the others remain adrift on the wreckage of tangled boats. A Coast Guard marine helicopter that Brody contacted arrives to tow them to shore. Before the pilot can tow them, the shark attacks and sinks the chopper with the pilot at the controls. It then knocks Sean into the water, but Marge sacrifices herself to save him.|$|E
5|$|Jordan {{grew up in}} Prior Lake, Minnesota, to John and Deb Schroeder, {{and moved}} to nearby Lakeville, a suburb of Minneapolis-Saint Paul, when he was thirteen. John played several sports, {{including}} basketball, football and baseball while Deb was a gymnast and a cross-country runner. Schroeder is the oldest of three siblings; brother Zach is two years younger and sister Elly is six years younger; both of them also play hockey. He first played hockey {{at the age of}} four; his first organized team was called the Lakeville Ponys which was intended as a learn to skate program but at the recommendation of his coach Scott Cummings, he was moved up to the Mite program because his skill level was far ahead of <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>kids</b> his age. Schroeder spent two years at St. Thomas Academy in suburban Mendota Heights, Minnesota, before graduating with high honors from Ann Arbor Pioneer High School in Ann Arbor, Michigan. He accelerated his high school education in order to play NCAA hockey a year early and took courses online from Brigham Young University to do so. Schroeder signed a letter of intent to join the University of Minnesota in November 2007. He enrolled at the school in the fall of 2008, majoring in business and marketing education. In 2010, his final year at the school, Schroeder was named to the WCHA All-Academic team, the result of a 3.0 grade average over the previous two semesters.|$|E

One of the kids, Stanley, decides {{to go to school}} because they might {{actually}} learn something this time which makes <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>kid</b> shrug and walk away.

5000|$|One of {{the most}} famous nonsanctioned {{playground}} games is bloody knuckles...a simple game that tests your speed, your strength, and most important, your tolerance for pain. Two kids stand facing each other with knuckles touching. Then one tries to whatck <b>the</b> <b>other's</b> knuckles as hard as he can. Next, <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>kid</b> goes. Back and forth, whack after whack. This game goes on until one of them quits for a simple reason: the pain becomes too intense. Jud Wilhite, pastor ...|$|R
25|$|Määttä {{began playing}} hockey in 2000 after he complained {{to his parents}} that all of <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>kids</b> were allowed to play hockey. His {{favorite}} book is the English dictionary and his favorite food is mushroom soup. Olli has two older brothers, Antti and Eero.|$|E
25|$|Monologues were {{a staple}} of the show. Scott Thompson's Buddy Cole monologues are the best known, but <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>Kids</b> {{performed}} solo pieces as well. McCulloch in particular performed monologues that consisted of him, acting as himself, telling hyperbolic stories of the struggles and day to day experiences in his life and/or the lives of others. Prominent examples from <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>Kids</b> include Foley describing his positive attitude toward menstruation, McKinney in character as a high-pitched recluse who's describing with intense fascination his hideously infected and bruised toe, and in a gag reminiscent of Bob Newhart, a distraught McDonald calling a best friend's young son to tell him his father died, only to have the child end up consoling him, even going so far as quoting famous philosophers on the ultimate emptiness of life.|$|E
25|$|The Kids {{frequently}} {{appeared as}} themselves {{rather than as}} characters, and some sketches dealt directly {{with the fact that}} they were a comedy troupe producing a TV show. For example, Kevin McDonald announces that if the next sketch (which he has written) is not successful, the others are considering kicking him out of the group. In another episode, Thompson declares that he isn't gay anymore, which throws <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>Kids</b> into a panic, as they fear that the news will alienate the troupe's considerable gay fanbase. In yet another sketch (in which an employee, Foley, asks his boss, McDonald, for a raise) McDonald complains the setup is cliché and his character one-dimensional.|$|E
60|$|Almost {{it seemed}} to me good fun, as at a circus, {{watching}} their antics. But I did not apprehend the seriousness of the situation until, the wind screaming higher than ever and the sea a-smoke and white with wrath, two men did not get up from the deck. One was carried away for'ard with a broken leg--it was Iare Jacobson, a dull-witted Scandinavian; and <b>the</b> <b>other,</b> <b>Kid</b> Twist, was carried away, unconscious, with a bleeding scalp.|$|R

500|$|School {{was never}} a concern for Babcock, {{and he did not}} earn his high school diploma until the age of 95. On growing up in the area, Babcock claims that he [...] "didn't do very much," [...] {{although}} he admits that [...] "t was a fun place to grow up." [...] Babcock partook in fishing, hunting, and swimming—especially around the local Sydenham Lake—in order to pass the time with <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>kids</b> his age. He would return to the area in 1919, after his wartime experiences, but soon after left for the United States. Nevertheless, Babcock's relatives continue to work at the Crater Dairy farm (named after the Holleford crater, a remnant of a meteor strike) and the community grew to greatly respect John.|$|E
500|$|Ed, Edd n Eddy {{follows the}} lives of three {{adolescent}} boys who all share variations of the name Ed, but differ greatly in their personalities. In the pursuit of buying jawbreakers and fitting in with <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>kids,</b> dimwitted Ed and intellectual Double Dee aid the self-appointed leader, Eddy, in his plans to scam the other children in their cul-de-sac out of their money during a perpetual summer vacation; however problems always ensue. The other children mostly dislike or show indifference to the Eds, though they all share a common fear of the Kanker Sisters, a group of teenage girls {{who live in the}} nearby [...] "Park n' Flush" [...] trailer park. The series takes place mostly within the fictional town of Peach Creek, and new locations were rarely introduced.|$|E

Growing up, he {{preferred}} soccer to football, but in his {{senior year of high}} school at Carman-Ainsworth High School, [...] "One of the football coaches was my math teacher. He had asked another soccer player in the class to kick, and <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>kid</b> was like, ‘Todd kicks the crap out of the ball,'" [...] Carter said.

500|$|As {{there is}} {{insufficient}} {{evidence to prove}} Milhouse ate all the food, Bart acquits him.

Lisa notices that the boar has survived by licking slime from the sides of rocks and proclaims they can likewise live off the slime. <b>The</b> <b>other</b> <b>kids</b> instead kill the boar and eat it, while Lisa adheres to her vegetarianism by licking slime from rocks. A deus ex machina narration by James Earl Jones says the children are eventually rescued by Moe Szyslak.|$|E

When Ultimecia's control is broken, Edea takes {{the side of the}} SeeDs in the struggle and joins Squall's party for a short time. However, she accidentally gives her powers to Rinoa, making her a sorceress. Being a sorceress, Edea attacks with magical bursts of energy and her Limit Break, Ice Strike, consists of a magically conjured icicle, hurled like a javelin. This Limit Break is depicted in a cutscene during Edea's coronation as head of Galbadia, when she (possessed by Ultimecia) attacks Squall with it.|$|E

At Virgil Junior High School, she participated in tennis, volleyball, and swimming, and won trophies for her achievements in athletics. At the age of 12, this hobby unexpectedly landed Lombard her first screen role. While playing baseball with friends, she {{caught the attention of}} the film director Allan Dwan, who later recalled seeing [...] "a cute-looking little tomboy... out there knocking the hell out of <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>kids,</b> playing better baseball than they were.

500|$|Campbell {{attended}} the Alfred E.

Herc recalls persuading his father to buy him a copy of [...] "Sex Machine" [...] by James Brown, a record that not a lot of his friends had, and which they would come to him to hear.
