Only if rejected asylum seekers are considered cooperative can they potentially receive a formal toleration status (Duldungskarte). According to the law, CWR is the main condition for being granted toleration status. Specifically, migrants applying for toleration status have to demonstrate: 1) that they cooperate with the aliens authorities to provide correct identity information and do not veil his/her identity, 2) that they have approached their embassy to produce valid <b>travel</b> <b>certificates</b> (National Council, 2005).|$|R

The three-month-old baby {{had been unable to}} leave India after her birth because she holds neither an Indian nor a Japanese nationality.

5000|$|Along {{with the}} {{introduction}} of J-BIS, an [...] "Automated gate" [...] (自動化ゲート) was set up at Terminal 1 and 2 at Narita Airport, Haneda Airport, Chubu Centrair Airport and Kansai Airport. With this system, when a person enters or leaves the country, rather than having to be processed by an examiner there, a person can use a machine at the gate, thereby making both entry and departure simpler and easier, as well as more convenient. Japanese people with valid passports, foreigners with both valid passports (this includes refugees with valid <b>travel</b> <b>certificates</b> and re-entry permits) and re-entry permits can use this system.|$|R
5000|$|In 1998, visa-free {{travel to}} the tourist resort of Mount Kumgang and the Kaesong Industrial Region was made {{possible}} under the [...] "sunshine policy" [...] orchestrated by South Korean President Kim Dae-jung.

In July 2008, a female tourist named Park Wang-ja {{was shot to death}} by a North Korean guard on a beach near Mount Kumgang, which led to the suspension of the tours. As of March 2010 all travel across the DMZ has now been suspended due to increasing tensions between North and South Korea.|$|R

40|$|Extract] The {{provision}} of written {{health and safety}} information for travellers has {{become an integral part}} of supporting the advice given during pre-travel health consultations. This may take the form of brochures, information sheets, and printouts from the Internet or indeed travel health booklets such as <b>Travel</b> Vaccination <b>Certificate</b> Book and Pre-Travel Guide, formerly Your Passport to Travel Health. ¹ <b>Travel</b> Vaccination <b>Certificate</b> Book and Pre-Travel Guide is based on the International Certificate of Vaccination or Prophylaxis (ICVP),² which has recently superseded the International Certificate of Vaccination (ICV), but has strategically inserted health information for the traveller. <b>Travel</b> Vaccination <b>Certificate</b> Book and Pre-Travel Guide includes notes on travel advice, passports and consular advice, as per the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) ³; notes on yellow fever, a travel health checklist, the ICVP, notes on malaria, notes on how to prevent malaria and dengue fever, notes on rabies, including a detailed rabies pre-exposure and post-exposure vaccination record; a chart giving the duration of protection of vaccines; and a section for detailing important medical history. It is curious that the nomenclature on the cover is not consistent with the ICVP. In addition, there is no obvious date of publication on the booklet and the year of publication has been estimated from discussions with the author. The <b>Travel</b> Vaccination <b>Certificate</b> Book and Pre-Travel Guide is obviously directed to travellers and retains the size of the ICV, hence could be easily carried with other travel documents. It no longer appears to come standard with a durable protective yellow plastic cover, as in the previous edition. None-the-less, it is as robust as any ICV or ICVP. In order to keep the booklet compact, it has omitted the A–Z of travel health issues, which would need to be provided by a separate publication. None-the-less, it may be useful to provide other essential advice for the traveller, such as a ready reference chart reminding travellers of lifesaving first aid procedures and an expanded proformas documenting travellers' medications. The inclusion of a key travel advisory website is a significant advance on the previous edition and appears to be the result of a partnership with DFAT. Perhaps other useful websites could be added, such as that of the Australian Travel Health Advisory Group. ⁴ The <b>Travel</b> Vaccination <b>Certificate</b> Book and Pre-Travel Guide gives coverage to issues not covered in an ICV alone. It is not a substitute for up-to-date pre-travel health advice on a range of health and safety topics important to the traveller or those seeking assistance for potentially life-threatening conditions from a qualified source. The <b>Travel</b> Vaccination <b>Certificate</b> Book and Pre-Travel Guide is not without some competition, which may be used as adjunctive resources; however, there are few comparable compact publications. 5 The booklet does provide an exceptionally practical low-cost reference for the traveller as an adjunct to appropriate health advice received before travel...|$|R

50|$|Advocates of {{open records}} {{continue}} to express concern {{that in the}} wake of increased security measures, many documents relating to immigration, passports and travel require presentation of a long form birth certificate, which they say is not available to Ontario adoptees.

It does not apply, however, to holders of HKSAR passports and MSAR passports, holders of B visas with a validity shorter than 10 years, and holders {{of other types of}} visas. The CBP and DHS are seeking to expand the EVUS to other nationalities in the future.|$|R
40|$|Extract] The International Certificate of Vaccination or Prophylaxis (ICVP) {{is widely}} used by travel health advisors to record vaccinations given to their travellers. John Skala's <b>Travel</b> Vaccination <b>Certificate</b> Book and Pre-Travel Guide, a minor update to the {{previous}} edition, 1 incorporates both an ICVP 2 and strategically placed essential pre-travel health advice. The Guide has become widely used in Australia and has been sponsored for distribution to general practice and travel clinics by {{both public and private}} agencies. The introductory pages include notes on "Travel Advice, Passports and Consular Assistance", as per advice provided by the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade 3; "Yellow Fever"; "Travellers Health Checklist"; and "Helpful Travel Health Websites". The "ICVP" then follows. The concluding pages include notes on "Malaria"; "To Prevent Malaria"; "Dengue Fever"; "Rabies", including a record for "Rabies Pre-Exposure", "Reinforcing Dose", and "Post-Exposure" – both for "Not Pre-Vaccinated" and for "Prevaccinated"; a chart giving the "Duration of Protection of Vaccines"; and a proforma for detailing "Important Medical History". On the back cover is a selection of international travel clinics, as well as a space for the practice or clinic stamp...|$|R
