6000|$|Jeff spared him {{the pain}} of a response. [...] "Very well," [...] {{he said to his}} mother; [...] "I'm not the hotel, and you never want me to be. I can do <b>this</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> own account." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A charming {{site for}} a mansion," [...] he said as they rode up. [...] "Mr. Mitford, I think I shall make you a bid for <b>this</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> own account, and so cut out my young friend Wilfrid." ...|$|E
5000|$|In May 2013, he told Republican U.S. Senator John Cornyn “I {{certainly}} am {{not personally}} responsible for making a list that had inappropriate criteria on it. With that said, <b>this</b> happened <b>on</b> <b>my</b> watch, and I very much regret that <b>this</b> happened <b>on</b> <b>my</b> watch.” ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Puffs enough," [...] said King Media, [...] "Vee-Vee! haul down my flag. There, {{lie down}} before me, oh Gonfalon! and, subjects, hear,--when I die, lay <b>this</b> spear <b>on</b> <b>my</b> right, and <b>this</b> pipe <b>on</b> <b>my</b> left, its colors at half mast; so shall I be ambidexter, and sleep between eloquent symbols." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't think I {{could get}} through the examinations, father, with <b>this</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> mind; besides, what should I say to the fellows about Edgar's going away? You see, if we find him before next term begins, we need say nothing about it." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{raised up}} in bed to see the effect of <b>this</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> uncle. But however the wind veered, Grafton could steer a course. He got up and began pacing the room, and his {{agitation}} my grandfather took for indignation such as his own.|$|E
6000|$|I asked Adam <b>this</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> own account. He put {{his head}} on one side {{for a moment and}} replied: [...] "In these days I think about great things; I do not play with Victor and the cow's child any more. He is only a baba." ...|$|E
60|$|Man. Some begging verses, Delivered me <b>this</b> morning <b>on</b> <b>my</b> wedding.|$|R
60|$|I {{find that}} there was a plot to kill me <b>this</b> morning <b>on</b> <b>my</b> way to the review.|$|R
60|$|Who {{had done}} this? {{who had made}} <b>this</b> attempt <b>on</b> <b>my</b> life? thought I, as I ran down the rigging.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now listen," [...] and he drew up {{a little}} closer beside her. [...] "The lady is very rich, and won't be {{particular}} to a few shillings; so I will advance to <b>this</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> own responsibility--I'll make the one sovereign two, rather than go back empty-handed." ...|$|E
60|$|Father, {{will you}} believe me just this once? Let me go. I tell you I haven't the documents. I tell {{you that if you}} let me leave this room, I shall not carry them away with me. I tell you <b>this</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> honor. Do {{you believe me}}? Tell me that you do believe me.|$|E
60|$|My dear sir,--I write <b>this</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> {{tour through}} {{a country where}} savage streams tumble over savage mountains, thinly overspread with savage flocks, which {{sparingly}} support as savage inhabitants. My last stage was Inverary--to-morrow night's stage Dumbarton. I ought sooner to have answered your kind letter, but you know I am a man of many sins. R. B.|$|E
60|$|Called <b>this</b> evening <b>on</b> <b>my</b> agent--my {{business}} as usual. Our strange adventures {{are the only}} inheritances of our family that have not diminished.|$|R

6000|$|... "If <b>this</b> goes <b>on,</b> <b>my</b> beloved 'earers, {{it will be}} my painful duty to rot this bargee." [...] Stalky drew a {{long breath}} through his nose.|$|R
6000|$|... {{and threw}} herself down {{to rest on}} a lawn as soft as moss, with little flower-beds dotted about it here and there. 'Oh, how glad I am to get here! And what IS <b>this</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> head?' she exclaimed {{in a tone of}} dismay, as she put her hands up to {{something}} very heavy, and fitted tight all round her head.|$|E
6000|$|... "Suppose I asked Armadale to lend me the money? I should enjoy getting {{something}} out of him; and I believe, in his present situation with Miss Milroy, he {{would do anything to}} be rid of me. Mean enough <b>this,</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> part. Pooh! When you hate and despise a man, as I hate and despise Armadale, who cares for looking mean in his eyes? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] {{replied the}} doctor, [...] "she is dying of {{tuberculosis}} of the lungs. What {{were the primary}} causes which induced that disease I cannot be sure. All I said was that she appears to welcome it, or rather its issue. And I will add <b>this</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> own account, that when she does die the world will lose one of the sweetest women that ever walked upon it. Good morning." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I {{did wrong}} then. You persuaded me into it. I'd no {{business}} to {{have listened to}} you and Jim and got all <b>this</b> load <b>on</b> <b>my</b> shoulders." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, in {{the first}} place," [...] said Beam, [...] "have you any liquid ammonia? The first notice I had of the wasps in that room was <b>this</b> sting <b>on</b> <b>my</b> finger." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Madame Carré? Why, I've {{already a}} note from her--I found it <b>this</b> morning <b>on</b> <b>my</b> return to Paris--asking me to look in at five o'clock and listen to a jeune Anglaise." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I know I am trusting to your {{goodness}} in a {{most extraordinary}} way," [...] Deronda went on, after giving his brief narrative; [...] "but {{you can imagine how}} helpless I feel with a young creature like <b>this</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> hands. I could not go with her among strangers, and in her nervous state I should dread taking her into a house full of servants. I have trusted to your mercy. I hope you will not think my act unwarrantable." ...|$|E
6000|$|In two days' time I had got {{everything}} ready, and {{had ordered the}} traveling carriage to the door some hours earlier than we had originally settled. We were jovially threatened with [...] "a parting cheer" [...] by all our English acquaintances, and I thought it desirable to avoid <b>this</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> friend's account; for he had been more excited, as it was, by the preparations for the journey than I at all liked. Accordingly, soon after sunrise, without a soul in the street to stare at us, we privately left Naples.|$|E
60|$|Fisc. The devil of jealousy, {{and that}} of avarice, both, I believe, possest him; or your son was innocently talking with his wife, and he perhaps had found them; this I guess, but saw it not, because I came too late. I only viewed the sweet youth just expiring, and Towerson stooping down to take the ring; she {{kneeling}} by to help him: when he saw me, he would, you may be sure, have sent me after, because I was a witness of the fact. <b>This</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> soul is true.|$|E
6000|$|MRS. BRADMERE. No, no; I {{want you}} to do as the Church--as all Christian society would wish. Come! You can't let <b>this</b> go <b>on.</b> <b>My</b> dear man, do your duty at all costs! ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'How {{good you}} have become lately,' said John, {{standing}} over her and smiling in the sunlight which blazed against the wall. 'I fancy you have stayed at home <b>this</b> afternoon <b>on</b> <b>my</b> account.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I said I {{would take}} <b>this</b> all <b>on</b> <b>my</b> own shoulders, Captain Putnam. Of course, you know I wouldn't have confessed at all; but I don't wish {{to give that}} thief any advantage." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No;--not to Marie at all; but to me. It need {{never be}} known to her. If you'll do that I'll stick to you and make a man of you. And {{if you want a}} couple of hundred pounds I'll give you a cheque for it before you leave the room. Mind, I can tell you <b>this.</b> <b>On</b> <b>my</b> word of honour as a gentleman, if my {{daughter}} were to marry you, she'd never have a single shilling. I should immediately make a will and leave all my property to St. George's Hospital. I have quite made up my mind about that.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You're a {{bit down}} on your luck. If things go badly you'll give me a look up. I can always raise a bit, and I think your word's all right. I tell you <b>this,</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> honour. Only {{yesterday}} 'the chief' asked for the proof of your story himself. It was down to appear without fail this next week. We've very few manuscripts in hand--never had fewer--and they've been so short of good fiction. What's gone wrong I don't know, but you leave {{it to me and}} I'll find out. You'll let me hear from you, eh?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then let me spare you {{the pain}} of beginning, and prove my sincerity by openly stating the truth, as far as I am concerned. I love her very dearly, but I am not mad enough to dream of telling her so. I {{know that it is}} impossible, and I {{relinquish}} my hopes. Trust me. I will keep silent and see her marry Annon without a word of complaint, if you will it. I see by her altered manner that you have spoken to her, and that my little friend and nurse is to be mine no longer. Perhaps you are wise, but if you do <b>this</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> account, it is in vain--the mischief is done, and while I live I shall love my cousin. If you do it to spare her, I am dumb, and will go away rather than cause her a care or pain." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What in thunder is {{the matter}} with me?" [...] he asked. [...] "What is <b>this</b> thing <b>on</b> <b>my</b> head? What {{is the matter}} with my arm, I don't seem able to move it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What," [...] {{broke in}} the Squire, {{in a voice}} of irritation, [...] "more lawn tennis parties, Ida? I think {{that you might have}} spared me for once-- with all <b>this</b> {{business}} <b>on</b> <b>my</b> hands, too." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ex-hibit-i-on four-round bout between Patsy Milligan and Tommy Goodley, {{members of}} <b>this</b> club. Patsy <b>on</b> <b>my</b> right, Tommy <b>on</b> <b>my</b> left. Gentlemen will kindly stop smokin'." ...|$|R
