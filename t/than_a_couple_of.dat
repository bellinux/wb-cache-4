The album has {{a variety of}} musical themes, time signature changes and tempo shifts – all of which were features of the progressive rock scene. Although the finished album runs as one continuous piece, it is made up of a medley of individual songs that run into each other, none of which individually lasts more <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> minutes. Parts of the suite blend classical and folk music into the typical rock music framework.|$|E

In this paper, an approach to integrating ANN and SAI is presented. The basic idea explored {{here is that there}} is much more to hybrid models <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>coupling</b> <b>of</b> methodologies for the sake of avoiding engineering problems...|$|R

Modern electronic computers and calculators have greatly reduced the need for multiplication by hand.|$|E

25|$|While the B class {{locomotives}} {{were highly}} successful on the expensively-engineered 1860s mainlines {{for which they}} were designed, they were less suited for the more cheaply built extensions to the VR system. Future VR express passenger locomotives were to use a four-wheel leading bogie to steer the locomotive, and from 1884 a class of 4-4-0 locomotives (later classed 'Old A') began to supplement, and eventually supersede the B class. Despite the delivery of the Old A, and the later and increasingly larger 'New A' and AA class 4-4-0s of 1889 and 1900 respectively, the entire B class (other <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> accident write-offs) lasted into the Twentieth century, with their roles ranging from double heading on express passenger trains down to shunting duties.|$|E

Billy Claiborne {{had been in}} one gunfight prior to the shootout and was {{the only member of the}} Cowboy faction that had prior gunfighting {{experience}} (not counting the Skeleton Canyon massacre, in which the McLaurys and Clantons took part). Doc Holliday, despite his reputation, had no documented gunfights to his credit, other <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> drunken brawls, and only his own tales of fights with unnamed men he claimed to have shot. Both Tom and Ike had spent the night gambling, drinking heavily, and without sleep.

25|$|In June 2004 {{the first}} {{performances}} for about 70 years {{took place in}} the theatre, first in its foyer then in July in the theatre itself. Although conditions were far from ideal, the audience was able to see the potential of this very large space – originally seating 3,000, it cannot currently be licensed for more <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> hundred. It is intended that the theatre will one day reopen, but much costly restoration will be required first. It will never again reach a seating capacity of 3,000 (not least because one balcony was removed {{in the early part of}} the 20th century as a fire precaution, when films started to be shown there), but it does seem likely that a capacity of more than 1,000 may one day be achieved. A major season of the theatre company Complicite was planned for 2005 but the project, which would have included some repair and access work, was cancelled due to higher-than-anticipated costs.|$|E

50|$|The {{songs by}} GONN {{were slow to}} reach the {{collector}} community. Greg Shaw contacted Craig Moore in 1984 and offered the band an LP deal once he learned about a reel of unreleased songs that were recorded in the mid-1960s.

For the first time, he finished {{top of the}} national batting averages (i.e., among those who played more <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> matches). He was the fifth highest runscorer behind Jupp, Humphrey, Isaac Walker and James Lillywhite but they all played many more innings than he did. He was 11th {{in the list of}} wicket-takers but again he bowled relatively few overs compared with most of those above him. The leaders were Southerton (151 wickets), Willsher (113) and Wootton (106) while Tom Hearne (33 at 8.45) and Emmett (60 at 8.80) topped the averages.|$|E
25|$|After Coral Sea, the loaned pilots {{returned}} to VF-3. However, with Lexington sunk and VF-2 attached to Saratoga, VF-3 was now effectively homeless. In the interim it operated out of Pearl as a training unit. Jimmy Thach passed command to Butch O'Hare on 24 June 1942, making him CO, and O'Hare subsequently appointed Vorse as his Executive Officer (XO). Vorse wouldn't stay put more <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> weeks, however. The Navy {{was in the}} midst of a major reshuffling of fighter squadrons, including a move from twenty-seven to thirty-six plane squadrons as a standard complement. In the post-Midway milieu, fighter-starved air groups were actively recruiting from squadrons like O'Hare's VF-3. Champing at the bit to get back out to sea, Vorse took Capt. James M. Shoemaker up on an offer to join VF-6. Only 6 July 1942 Vorse was transferred; nine days later VF-6 would depart with USS Enterprise, a part of Task Force 16 under the command of Admiral Kinkaid.|$|E
25|$|While Hancock {{was in the}} Po sector, Warren {{requested}} {{permission from}} Meade to attack Laurel Hill at 4 p.m., uncoordinated {{with the rest of}} Grant's attack. Again the Laurel Hill line repulsed the Union troops with heavy losses. Grant was forced to postpone his 5 p.m. coordinated assault until Warren could get his troops reformed. Not informed of the delay, Brig. Gen. Gershom Mott of the II Corps moved his division forward at 5 p.m. toward the tip of the Mule Shoe. When his men reached the open field, Confederate artillery ripped them to shreds, and they retreated. At around 6 p.m., Col. Emory Upton led a group of 12 hand-picked regiments, about 5,000 men in four battle lines, against an identified weak point {{on the west side of}} the Mule Shoe. The plan was for Upton's men to rush across the open field without pausing to fire and reload, reaching the earthworks before the Confederates could fire more <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> shots. The plan worked well initially, but Generals Lee and Ewell were quick to organize a vigorous counterattack with brigades from all sectors of the Mule Shoe. No Union supporting units arrived. Upton's men were driven out of the Confederate works, and he reluctantly ordered them to retreat.|$|E

500|$|When {{performed}} properly, deep frying {{does not}} make food excessively greasy, because the moisture in the food repels the oil. The hot oil heats the water within the food, steaming it; oil cannot go against the direction of this powerful flow because (due to its high temperature) the water vapor pushes the bubbles toward the surface. As long as the oil is hot enough and the food is not immersed in the oil for too long, oil penetration will be confined to the outer surface. Foods deep-fried at proper temperatures typically absorb [...] "no more <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> tablespoons per [...] cups of oil" [...] used.

Edgeworth explained that each of Day's projects with Sabrina had been successful, but he had {{come to the conclusion that}} Lucretia was [...] "invincibly stupid".
