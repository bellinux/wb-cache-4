5|$|The Venusian {{surface was}} {{a subject of}} {{speculation}} until some of its secrets were revealed by planetary science in the 20th century. Venera landers in 1975 and 1982 returned images of a surface covered in sediment and relatively angular rocks. The surface was mapped in detail by Magellan in 1990–91. The ground shows evidence of extensive volcanism, and the sulfur in the atmosphere may indicate that <b>there</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>some</b> recent eruptions.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the schools}} {{do not share}} {{geographic}} proximity, which would induce frequent recruiting battles, <b>there</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>some</b> high-profile recruits that were heavily targeted by both institutions. Chris Webber, Michigan's Mr. Basketball in 1991 and the National High School player of the year, chose Michigan over Duke and eventually became the #1 pick in the 1993 NBA Draft after playing two seasons for the Wolverines. Duke returned the favor by gaining a commitment from Michigan-raised Detroit Country Day alum Shane Battier, the 1997 Mr. Basketball of Michigan, who led Duke's 2001 National Championship team, while sweeping all of the National Player of the Year awards. Battier had {{been a fan of}} the Fab Five growing up. More recently, Michigan landed Mitch McGary, who had visited only Michigan, Duke and University of North Carolina.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the heavy}} {{security}} after the 2016 election, <b>there</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>some</b> detentions and arrests {{that have been}} related to the increased security at the tower. On December 6, a woman managed to bypass security {{and go to the}} 24th floor—two floors below Donald Trump's office—before being stopped by Secret Service officers. A week later on December 13, a Baruch College student who was arrested at Trump Tower was found to have multiple weapons, including knives, a garrote, and firecrackers. The next day, another man reportedly got angry after he wanted to meet Donald Trump at the tower, and after throwing a wine glass onto the floor of the tower's lobby, was subsequently detained by the NYPD.|$|E
5|$|Leggetts Creek {{flows through}} a water gap known as Leggetts Gap or The Notch. The gap is {{cut through the}} West or Lackawanna Mountain Range by the creek. <b>There</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>some</b> culm banks along the creek and {{historic}} mining operations such as those at the Marvine #6 Colliery have affected it. The creek's headwaters are in wetlands surrounded by residential development. There is riprap on the creek in Leggetts Gap as it flows near major highways in this stretch. It typically has a natural channel in part of its lower reaches {{and there are some}} reaches with gradual slopes. However, {{in some parts of the}} creek's lower reaches, fill has been dumped onto its banks, creating steep slopes. The creek has been channelized in South Abington Township.|$|E
5|$|Sandgrouse {{have little}} {{interaction}} with people, primarily because most species live in arid unpopulated areas and at low densities. They are not generally sought after as game birds {{as they are}} not especially palatable, although they have on occasion been taken in great numbers at water holes. An attempt to introduce them into Nevada failed {{but they have been}} introduced to Hawaii. No species is considered to be threatened although <b>there</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>some</b> localised range contractions, particularly in Europe. A subspecies of the chestnut-bellied sandgrouse, P. e. floweri, was last seen in the Nile Valley of Egypt in 1979. It is thought to be extinct, but the reasons for this are unknown.|$|E

5|$|The arch {{was built}} {{as part of}} the Temple Mount's massive western {{retaining}} wall, which forms its eastern support. The voussoirs spring from a row of impost blocks which were cut to produce a dentil pattern. <b>There</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>some</b> theories which speculate that the dentils were employed as part of a system used to shore up timber forms used during construction. However, this was a common decorative element employed in the region at the time, and archaeologists have noted that in this region of limited forests it is much more likely that packed earth, rather than expensive timbers, was used to support the form on which the arch was constructed.|$|E
5|$|Lion's {{share of}} Ireland has with most likehood been {{above sea level}} during the last 60 million years. As such its landscapes have been shaped by erosion and {{weathering}} on land. Protracted erosion does also means most of the Paleogene and Neogene sediments have been eroded away or, as known in a few cases, buried by Quaternary deposits. Before the Quaternary glaciations affected Ireland the landscape had developed thick weathered regolith on the uplands and karst in the lowlands. <b>There</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>some</b> controversy regarding {{the origin of the}} planation surfaces found on Ireland. While some have argued for an origin in marine planation others regard these surfaces as peneplains formed by weathering and fluvial erosion. Not only is their origin disputed but also their actual extent and the relative role of sea-level change and tectonics in their shaping. Most river systems in Ireland formed in the Cenozoic before the Quaternary glaciations. Rivers follow for most of their course structural features of the geology of Ireland. Marine erosion since the Miocene might have made Ireland's western coast retreat more than 100 km. Pre-Quaternary relief was more dramatic than today's glacier-smoothened landscapes.|$|E
5|$|The {{range of}} Oryzomys extends from New Jersey {{in the eastern}} United States through Mexico and Central America south to northwestern Colombia and east to northwestern Venezuela and Curaçao. Species of Oryzomys usually live in wet {{habitats}} such as marshes, streams, and mangroves, but both the marsh rice rat and O.couesi are also occasionally encountered in drier habitats. They occur or occurred on many continental-shelf islands and one oceanic island, Jamaica; their adeptness at colonizing islands {{may be caused by}} their close association with water and frequent occurrence in coastal wetlands. The oldest fossils date to the Rancholabrean of the United States, about 300,000 years ago; although <b>there</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>some</b> earlier North American records, those are not in fact referable to Oryzomys or even Oryzomyini. Oryzomyines likely evolved in South America east of the Andes; the presence of Oryzomys in Central America and other trans-Andean regions is thought {{to be the result of}} one of several independent invasions of this region by oryzomyines. Alternatively, Oryzomys may have evolved from the Pliocene North American Jacobsomys. O.antillarum may have reached Jamaica during the last glacial period while sea levels were low.|$|E
