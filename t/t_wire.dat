40|$|We {{investigate}} electron transmission {{through a}} short wire with electronelectron interactions which is coupled to noninteracting metallic leads by tunneling matrix elements. We identify two temperature regimes (a) TKondo < T ≤ <b>T</b> <b>wire</b> = ¯hvF/kBd (d is {{the length of}} the interacting wire) and (b) T < TKondo ≪ <b>T</b> <b>wire.</b> In the first regime the effective (renormalized) electronelectron interaction is smaller than the tunneling matrix element. In this situation the single particle spectrum of the wire is characterized by a multilevel “quantum dot ” system with magnetic quantum number S = 0 which is higher in energy than the SU(2) spin doublet S = ± 1 / 2. In this regime the single particle energy is controlled by {{the length of the}} wire and the backward spin dependent interaction. The value of the conductance is dominated by the transmitting electrons which have an opposite spin polarization to the electrons in the short wire. Since the electrons in the short wire have equal probability for spin up and spin down we find G = G↑+G↓, e 2 /h ≤ G < 2 e 2 /h. In the second regime, when T → 0 the effective (renormalized) electron-electron interaction is larger than the tunneling matrix element. This case is equivalent to a Kondo problem. We find for T < TKondo the conductance is given by G = 2 e 2 /h. These results are in agreement with recent experiments where 1 for TKondo < T < <b>T</b> <b>wire</b> the conductance G obeys e 2 /h ≤ G < 2 e 2 /h, and for T < TKondo, G = 2 e 2 /h. In both regimes the current is not spin polarized and the SU(2) symmetry is not broken.

40|$|Abstract. In the {{perfectly}} secure message transmission (PSMT) prob-lem, two synchronized non-faulty players (or processors), the Sender S and the Receiver R are connected by n wires (each of which facilitates 2 -way communication); S has an -bit {{message that he}} wishes to send to R; after exchanging messages in phases 1 R should correctly obtain S’s message, while an adversary listening on and actively controlling any set of <b>t</b> (or less) <b>wires</b> should have no information about S’s message. We measure {{the quality of a}} protocol for securely transmitting an -bit message using the following parameters: the number of wires n, the num-ber of phases r and the total number of bits transmitted b. The optima for n and r are respectively 2 t + 1 and 2. We prove that any 2 -phase reliable message transmission protocol, and hence any secure protocol, over n wires out of which at most t are faulty is required to transmit at least b = n n− 2 t bits. While no known protocol is simultaneously optimal in both communication and phase complexity, we present one such optimum protocol for the case n = 2 t + 1 when the size of message is large enough, viz., = Ω(t log t) bits; that is, our optimal protocol has n = 2 t+ 1, r = 2 and b = O(n) bits. Note that privacy is for free, if the message is large enough. We also demonstrate how randomness can effectively improve the phase complexity. Specifically, while the (worst-case) lower bound on r is 2, we design an efficient optimally tolerant protocol for PSMT that terminates in a single phase with arbitrarily high probability. Finally, we consider the case when the adversary is mobile, that is, he could corrupt a different set of <b>t</b> <b>wires</b> in different phases. Again, the optima for n and r are respectively 2 t + 1 and 2; However we show that b ≥ n n− 2 t bits irrespective of r.

The hip, shoulder and elbow are common locations. The foot, leg, Knee and hand are involved less frequently. FTC can be due to mutations in GALNT 3 gene encoding for glycosyltransferase, a protein that helps to regulate phosphate levels, or Fibroblast Growth Factor 23 gene (FGF 23). This is secreted by bone cells and acts at the kidney to regulate phosphate reabsorption and vitamin D 3 production. The aim of our work is to describe a case of FTC with dental anomalies and bisphosphonates therapy undergone to orthodontic and surgical treatment. Materials and Metods: A 13 years-old boy with FTC was referred to our observation and he underwent a complete clinical examination and biochemical, radiological, genetic testing : to intraoral examination teeth are smaller than normal with enamel hypoplasia, panoramic radiographs revealed unerupted 1. 3, 2. 3, 3. 3, 4. 3 and tooth anomalies (short bulbous teeth with obliteration of the pulp chamber and root canal), x-ray pelvis showed calcified areas around of both hip joints. Laboratory tests showed hyperphosphatemia, normocalcemia, elevated level of parathyroid hormone and normal level of 1, 25 vitamin D 3 and DNA sequencing identified a mutation in GALNT 3 gene.
