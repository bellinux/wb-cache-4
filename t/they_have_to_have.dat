In the Act One finale ("When the Truth Comes Out"), all the plotlines come together. Dr. Kelso offers Carla her job back, but she worries how to tell Turk. Elliot worries how to tell J.D. he's not moving in. And Ms. Miller goes in for her CT scan, which turns up a gigantic aneurysm in her temporal lobe. Dr. Cox breaks the news to Ms. Miller, pulling a curtain for privacy that also signals {{the end of the}} act.|$|E

500|$|Anna's costumes in {{the film}} were {{informed}} {{by the research of}} Norwegian clothing styles. Based on these findings, art director Brittney Lee and her team later found out what materials should be used for the costumes. Co-director Jennifer Lee created a cheerful wardrobe featuring [...] "playful" [...] floral patterns and saturated colors in order to accurately reflect Anna's personality. The animators also took into account the climate that Anna is living in, costuming her in heavy wools and velvets, reflecting traditional winter clothing of the Scandinavian area. The animators added structures to the costumes in a way, such as pleated dresses, that allows movements, giving the character a free range of [...] "twirl all she wants" [...] throughout the film. In order to deepen the cultural context of the film, rosemaling, a traditional form of Norwegian decorative folk art, was added to almost every character's costumes. Anna and her sister, Elsa, also enjoyed a large number of types of costumes and the layers of costuming that have never been done before. As these characters are running around in the snow, <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> petticoats, undergarments, capes, [...] "and they have all these layers and layers of things that are all meticulously designed," [...] Brittney explained.|$|E

2500|$|Taylor often {{expressed}} {{views of}} workers {{that may be}} considered insulting. He recognized differences between workers, stressed the need to select the right person for the right job, and championed the workers by advocating frequent breaks and good pay for good work.

25|$|Queen's Counsel and serjeants were prohibited, {{at least}} from the mid-nineteenth century, from {{drafting}} pleadings alone; a junior barrister <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be retained. <b>They</b> were not permitted to appear in court without a junior barrister, and <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> chambers in London.

50|$|Although {{licensed}} by the harbour to operate within their jurisdiction, pilots were generally self-employed, meaning that <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> quick transport <b>to</b> get them from the port to the incoming ships. As pilots were often still dual-employed, they used their own fishing boats to reach the incoming vessels. But fishing boats were heavy working boats, and filled with fishing equipment, and so {{a new type of}} boat was required.|$|R

The inductees were decided by a specially selected panel, including members of the Cowboys’ organisation and the wider rugby league community, and are assessed on their skill and ability, leadership, integrity and character, their state and international honours, and awards won at the club.|$|R
2500|$|This test may {{be done in}} a {{hospital}} or clinic. The patient lies on the X-ray table and a preliminary X-ray is taken. The patient is then asked to lie on the side while a well lubricated enema tube is inserted into the rectum. As the enema enters the body, the patient might have the sensation that <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a bowel movement. The barium sulfate, a radiodense (shows as white on X-ray) contrast medium, is then allowed to flow into the colon. A large balloon {{at the tip of the}} enema tube may be inflated to help keep the barium sulfate inside. The flow of the barium sulfate is monitored by the health care provider on an X-ray fluoroscope screen (like a TV monitor). Air may be puffed into the colon to distend it and provide better images (often called a [...] "double-contrast" [...] exam). If air is used, the enema tube will be reinserted if it had been removed and a small amount of air will be introduced into the colon, and more X-ray pictures are taken.|$|E

500|$|These assertions {{were quickly}} {{challenged}} by Sandweiss and Moseley, who observed that Caral, though {{the largest and}} most complex Preceramic site, is not the oldest. They admitted the importance of agriculture to industry and to augment diet, while broadly affirming [...] "the formative role of marine resources in early Andean civilization".

50|$|Although French {{investigators}} were leaning towards {{the theory that}} Dr Godard had murdered his wife and then fled, these latest discoveries brought chaos into the investigation.

Then, there is no sense in raising a family until there is plenty of the right kind of food, and you know we Goldfinches live mostly on seeds. I'll venture to say that we are the greatest seed-eaters anywhere around. Of course when the babies are small <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> soft food, but one can find plenty of worms and bugs any time during the summer. Just as soon as the children are big enough to hunt their own food they need seeds, so there is no sense in trying to raise a family until there are plenty of seeds for them when needed.

60|$|But it {{was before}} I reached this final point that I {{received}} into my consciousness the moments of the human comedy which have been an increasing burden to it. Within a block of the river I met a child so small that at first I almost refused to take any account of her, until she appealed to my sense of humor by her amusing disproportion to the pail which she was lugging {{in front of her}} with both of her little mittened hands. I am scrupulous about mittens, though I was tempted to write of her little naked hands, red with the pitiless cold. This would have been more effective, but {{it would not have been}} true, and the truth obliges me to own that she had a stout, warm-looking knit jacket on. The pail-which was half her height and twice her bulk-was filled to overflowing with small pieces of coal and coke, and if it had not been for this I might have taken her for a child of the better classes, she was so comfortably clad. But in that case she would have had to be fifteen or sixteen years old, in order to be doing so efficiently and responsibly the work which, as the child of the worse classes, she was actually doing at five or six. We must, indeed, allow that the early self-helpfulness of such children is very remarkable, and all the more so because they grow up into men and women so stupid that, according to the theories of all polite economists, <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> their discontent with their conditions put into their heads by malevolent agitators.|$|E
50|$|I {{looked at}} the past sets and {{realised}} that {{there had never been}} a collection of every single we’d ever released throughout the history of the band nor a DVD compilation of every clip so that’s what we decided to do.

40|$|Background: This {{study will}} present {{five years of}} {{retrospective}} data from journals concerning diabetes- 2 patients with unsatisfactory bloodglucosecontrol refferred to the Endocrinological outpatientclinic at Aker University Hospital. Data and method: Starting with refferred diabetes- 2 patients, we sorted out our population by following crieria: <b>They</b> needed <b>to</b> <b>have</b> had diabetes {{for more than one}} year and not be on insulin treatment {{at the time of their}} first consultation at the clinic. <b>They</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been refferred for unsatisfactory bloodglucosecontrol, and because of the need for successive data <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> had three or more consultations. These criteria accumulated 97 journals. Results: Our primary interest was if the bloodglucoselevel, represented by HbA 1 c, declined following treatmentat the clinic. For asian women the average decline in HbA 1 c was 1. 14 %points, the decline amongst norvegian women was 1. 16 %points, asian men 0. 41 %points and norvegian men 1. 32 %points. In the total population HbA 1 c declined 1. 01 %points. Comparative data are collected from the start of treatment and again after 6 - 8 months. Interpretation: Patients refferred to the outpatientclinic because of unsatisfactory bloodglucose control have assumably exhausted the potential for improved control that the primary healthcare service can provide. Our study suggests a benefit from refferral to a specialist when it comes to bloodglucose control. Since this study is retrospective the instigated treatment has not quite been in accordance with the recommended treatment of today, as suggested by the FINFAT study. Even better bloodglucose control following updated treatment protocols can be expected...|$|R
