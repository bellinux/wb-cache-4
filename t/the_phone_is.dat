500|$|The G2's {{exterior}} {{consists of}} a polycarbonate shell—unlike its predecessor, which used a glass-based construction. The rear cover is adorned with a subtle pattern resembling carbon fiber. The G2's volume and power keys are located directly below the camera on {{the rear of the}} device. The power button contains an LED lamp, which {{can be used as a}} notification light. The positioning of the buttons on the rear deviates from the majority of smartphones, where they are located on the bezel (side edge) of the phone. LG argued that buttons located on the bezel were harder to reach on larger smartphones, and made it more likely for users to drop their phone when adjusting the volume during a call. As such, the G2's buttons are instead located where the index finger would normally lie when <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>is</b> held. Alongside the power button, the G2 is also [...] powered on by double-tapping on the screen, and turned off by double-tapping on the status bar or a blank area on the home screen, a feature branded as [...] "KnockOn". When <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>is</b> off, the volume keys can also be used to launch directly into the camera or QuickMemo applications by holding them down.|$|E

In her autobiography, she wrote: [...] "I just couldn't bear not being there. Because whatever they said about how it didn't matter, it did matter. Saying 'Yes, I like that' or 'Not sure about that' down <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>is</b> not the same." [...] She contributed backing vocals and sings during the chorus. Rowe stayed up all night working on the song, and it was finished by morning, the only later addition was the sound of Brown's footsteps as she ran to the microphone.|$|E

2500|$|Mobile phones {{can be used}} in {{countries}} with different emergency numbers. This means that a traveller visiting a foreign country does not have to know the local emergency numbers.

The actual number is not even transmitted into the network, but the network redirects the emergency call to the local emergency desk.
