40|$|Efforts {{to advance}} justice {{and improve the}} rule of law can be divided into two categories. One set of efforts-by far the better funded and more {{established}} of the two-focuses on state institutions, on improving the effectiveness and fairness of the courts, the legislature, the police, the health and education systems, etc. A second set of efforts, sometimes termed legal empowerment, focuses on directly assisting ordinary people, especially the poor, who face justice problems. There are two primary reasons for complementing state-centered reforms with this second <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>undertaking.</b> First and most simply, institutional reform is slow and difficult, and {{there is a need to}} tend to those wounded by broken systems not yet fixed.

40|$|Despite the {{considerable}} resources {{that have been}} dedicated to HIV prevention interventions and services over the past decade, HIV incidence among {{young people in the}} United States remains alarmingly high. One reason is that the majority of prevention efforts continue to focus solely on modifying individual behavior, even though public health research strongly suggests that changes to a community's structural elements, such as their programs, practices, and laws or policies, may result in more effective and sustainable outcomes. Connect to Protect is a multi-city community mobilization intervention that focuses on altering or creating community structural elements in ways that will ultimately reduce youth HIV incidence and prevalence. The project, which spans 6  years, is sponsored by the Adolescent Medicine Trials Network for HIV/AIDS Interventions at multiple urban clinical research sites. This paper provides an overview of the study's three phases and describes key factors in setting a firm foundation for the initiation and execution of this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>undertaking.</b> Connect to Protect's community mobilization approach to achieving structural change represents a relatively new and broad direction in HIV prevention research. To optimize opportunities for its success, time and resources must be initially placed into laying the groundwork. This includes activities such as building a strong overarching study infrastructure to ensure protocol tasks can be met across sites; tapping into local site and community expertise and knowledge; forming collaborative relationships between sites and community organizations and members; and fostering community input on and support for changes at a structural level. Failing to take steps such as these may lead to insurmountable implementation problems for an intervention of this kind...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn this paper, {{we review}} {{some of the}} initial researches, {{conducted}} during the 70 's and later, about the potential role of external rewards on intrinsic motivation for learning. This is considered from different theoretical approaches such as self-determination theory, cognitive approach, attribution theory, general interest theory, behaviorist approach. The review {{is divided into three}} parts. Firstly, we review researches related to the effect of external reward on reducing internal motivation for learning and some research which is opposite to them. Secondly, we discuss the benefits of motivation for improving creative achievements. Thirdly, a significant part of this paper refers to analyzing the interests, as a part of students’ intrinsic motivation, which are not given enough attention in literature. Finally, we draw conclusions from the researches review. In the summary, analyzing these early researches, we can say that there is a good evidence that rewards have a strong influence on the students’ motivation for learning and high creative outcomes which is opposite to some initial researches (although this depends on the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>undertaking</b> rewards). Considering these early researches indicates that producing negative effects requires combining specific conditions that are not characteristic for activities in everyday life, especially in school life and the idea that rewards disturb intrinsic motivation of individual requires a more detailed analysis. We believe that rewards are not harmful, which is proved by some researches, {{and that there is a}} certain interrelation between external motivators and task-oriented motivation which is confirmed by the cognitive approach. Future researches should be oriented towards the examination of the impact of different types of interests on learning and the variety of personal motives, examining the interactions between motivation and cognitive constructs, but also on how to develop personal interests and motivational constructs...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is based}} on the group report (Thaper et al, 2009), which is the output from a leading pharmaceutical company commissioning a team of Nottingham University MBA students to investigate the potential of unmet demand in the pharmaceutical market. Based on the investigation undertaken, the report produced a series of recommendations which could help a leading pharmaceutical company to create value for customer. This dissertation investigates whether the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> value the company pursues influence the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> innovation it <b>undertakes.</b> The research identifies four main <b>types</b> <b>of</b> value (Consumer values and consumer value; Augmented product concept; Customer satisfaction and service quality; and The value chain) as well as five <b>types</b> <b>of</b> innovation (Product; Process; Position; Paradigm Type A; and Paradigm Type B). The author investigates the influence <b>of</b> the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> value the company pursues over the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> innovation it <b>undertakes.</b> The research studies four carefully selected cases to identify any relationships/links between the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> value the company chooses and the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> innovation it <b>undertakes.</b> The results show that companies pursue multiple <b>types</b> <b>of</b> value in parallel. All businesses in the cases pursued „The Value Chain‟ whilst pursuing additional <b>type(s)</b> <b>of</b> value depending on the business.

40|$|This {{paper is}} in closed access until 27 th April 2018. In {{understanding}} workers’ work-related mobility patterns {{it is more}} accurate to talk of mobilities, rather than mobility, as a heterogeneous range <b>of</b> different <b>types</b> and patterns <b>of</b> work-related travel are undertaken (Jones 2010). It is suggested here that the spatial mobility of workers can involve <b>undertaking</b> quite different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> journeys on different spatial scales, and that the diverse spatial scales over which business travel occurs {{need to be taken}} greater account of. In the present paper, this is done via utilizing and illustrating Hislop’s (2016) framework on the spatial scales of business travel. This framework distinguishes between four broad scales and journey types: localized land-based travel, long distance land-based travel, short haul plane-based journeys and long haul plane-based journeys. To illustrate the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> journeys <b>undertaken</b> at each spatial scale, empirical data is drawn from a study of UK business travellers involving journeys undertaken by car, plane, and train A number of illustrative vignettes are presented which give rich insights into the various <b>types</b> <b>of</b> workers who regularly travel for work, the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> journeys they <b>undertake,</b> and some <b>of</b> the key impacts that their work and travel patterns have on their non-work lives...|$|R
