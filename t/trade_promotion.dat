5|$|Closely {{linked to}} the mercantile community, he {{actively}} supported <b>trade</b> <b>promotion</b> schemes and invested in the Muscovy Company and the Levant Company. He supported the attempts of John Davis and Martin Frobisher to discover the Northwest Passage and exploit the mineral resources of Labrador, and encouraged Humphrey Gilbert's exploration of Newfoundland. Gilbert's voyage was largely financed by recusant Catholics and Walsingham favoured the scheme as a potential means of removing Catholics from England by encouraging emigration to the New World. Walsingham was among the promoters of Francis Drake's profitable 1578–1581 circumnavigation of the world, correctly judging that Spanish possessions in the Pacific were vulnerable to attack. The venture was calculated to promote the Protestant interest by embarrassing and weakening the Spanish, {{as well as to}} seize Spanish treasure. The first edition of Richard Hakluyt's Principal Navigation, Voyages and Discoveries of the English Nation was dedicated to Walsingham.|$|E

25|$|Like his predecessor, Obama pursued {{free trade}} agreements, {{in part due}} to the lack of {{progress}} at the Doha negotiations in lowering trade barriers worldwide. In October 2011, the United States entered into free trade agreements with Colombia, Panama, and South Korea. Congressional Republicans overwhelmingly supported the agreements, while Congressional Democrats cast a mix of votes. The three agreements had originally been negotiated by the Bush administration, but Obama re-opened negotiations with each country and changed some terms of each deal. Obama also promoted two significantly larger, multilateral free trade agreements: the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) with several Pacific Rim countries, and the proposed Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) with the European Union. TPP negotiations began under President Bush, and Obama continued them as part of a long-term strategy that sought to refocus U.S. power to East Asia. The size and scope of the TPP negotiations grew under Obama until it included twelve countries, including Malaysia, Japan, Mexico, and Canada. The Obama administration received heavy criticism from citizen activists and members of the Democratic Party for the lack of transparency in the negotiations, as well as the presence of corporate representatives who assisted in the drafting process. After years of negotiations, the 12 countries reached a final agreement on the content of the TPP in October 2015, and the full text of the treaty was made public in November 2015. In July 2015, Congress passed a bill giving <b>trade</b> <b>promotion</b> authority to the president until 2021; <b>trade</b> <b>promotion</b> authority requires Congress to vote up or down on trade agreements signed by the president, with no possibility of amendments or filibusters. The TPP became a major campaign issue in the 2016 elections, with both major party presidential nominees opposing its ratification. In January 2017, President Trump signed an executive order pulling the United States out of the TPP negotiations.|$|E
25|$|With India gaining independence, the American {{diplomatic}} post in Madras was officially raised to a Consulate General on 15 August 1947, marking {{a milestone in}} the bilateral {{relationship between the two}} countries. On the same day, Roy E. B. Bower became the last consul and the first consul general in Madras in independent India. With Parry's Company wanting the whole building in 1952, the Consulate had to look for new premises. Five years later, in the 1950s, the Consulate General moved to a building on Mount Road (the present day Anna Salai), currently occupied by the Bank of America. With the expansion of the Indo-U.S. relations after Independence, the Consulate General required a purpose-built structure to accommodate a diversity of activities such as library services, cultural programming, educational exchange, visas, American citizen services and development assistance, along with the ancient standby, <b>trade</b> <b>promotion.</b> For this purpose, the Consulate General leased out a parcel of land on the Gemini Circle from the Church of South India to build its own building. On 3 January 1969, the Consulate General moved to its present location on the Gemini Circle, which was inaugurated by Ambassador Chester Bowles.|$|E

40|$|<b>Trade</b> <b>promotions</b> are {{the most}} {{important}} promotional tool available to a manufacturer. However <b>trade</b> <b>promotions</b> can achieve their objective of increasing short-term sales only if the retailer passes through these promotions. Empirical research has documented that there is a wide variation in retail pass-through across products. However {{little is known about the}} variations in pass-through over time. This is particularly important for products with distinct seasonal patterns. We argue that extant methods of measuring pass-through are inadequate for seasonal products. We therefore introduce a measurement approach and illustrate it using two product categories. We find interesting differences in pass-through for loss-leader products versus regular products during high demand and regular demand periods. We find that retailers use a deep and narrow pass-through strategy (high pass-through on loss-leader products, but small pass-through on regular products) during periods of regular demand and broad and shallow pass-through strategy (smaller, but similar pass-through on both loss-leader and regular products) during periods of high demand. Loss leader products continue to obtain higher pass-through in high demand periods, if the category's high demand period is also a high demand period for other product categories as well.

25|$|His accomplishments as {{an athlete}} {{eventually}} led him to public service. As an accomplished youngster, governor Sila María Calderón decided to appoint Bernier to lead the Puerto Rico Office of Youth Affairs in 2003. Two years later, governor Aníbal Acevedo Vilá appointed him as Secretary of Sports of Puerto Rico. But as a different political party took over the government, Bernier opted to leave his incumbency {{after four years of}} service. A few months later he was elected president of the Puerto Rico Olympic Committee. In that capacity Bernier led the efforts to organize the 2010 Central American and Caribbean Games celebrated in Mayaguez. A few years later and as he was preparing for his re-election for president of the committee, governor Alejandro García Padilla appointed him as Secretary of State of Puerto Rico. In that role, Bernier transformed the Department of State of Puerto Rico by creating the Morales Carrión Diplomatic and Foreign Relations School, by opening several Puerto Rican <b>trade</b> <b>promotion</b> offices in foreign countries, and by reducing the backlog of business charters filings and intellectual property filings. Bernier, however, left his incumbency once again but this time to run for governor of Puerto Rico in the 2016 general election for the Popular Democratic Party.|$|E
25|$|In 2001 {{the current}} account deficit dropped to about 2.2% of GDP (US$1.17 billion)--from 3.1% in 2000—while the trade balance {{registered}} a small deficit.

After being hit hard by El Niño in 1998, fisheries exports have recovered, and minerals and metals exports recorded large gains in 2001 and 2002, mostly {{as a result of}} the opening of the Antamina copper-zinc mine.

40|$|In {{the first}} part of the dissertation, we {{incorporate}} the concept of distributive fairness into the conventional dyadic channel to study how fairness may affect the interactions between the manufacturer and the retailer. ^ Traditional wisdom has shown that only nonlinear pricing schemes can coordinate a dyadic channel. We show that the manufacturer can use a simple wholesale price above its marginal cost to coordinate this channel as long as the retailer is sufficiently fair-minded. This is true in both the Stackelberg game where the manufacturer chooses its wholesale price before the retailer sets the retail price and the Nash bargaining game where the manufacturer and the retailer bargain on wholesale price together. We also show that a two-part tariff or quantity discount can still coordinate the fair channel. However, the manufacturer cannot use either mechanism to take away all the channel profit. Indeed, the manufacturer need not even claim the largest share of the channel profit when the channel is so coordinated. Further, different from traditional prediction, the result shows that social welfare in linear pricing scheme will be higher than the social welfare in non-linear pricing schemes when the channel is coordinated. ^ In the second part of the dissertation, we study whether a monopolistic manufacturer can increase both channel profit and its own profit through the implementation of <b>trade</b> <b>promotions.</b> Critics have long faulted the wide-spread practice of <b>trade</b> <b>promotions</b> as wasteful. Yet the practice continues. ^ In the dissertation, we resolve some inconsistency between theory and practices through an analytical model. We show that in a distribution channel characterized by a dominant retailer, a manufacturer has incentives to price-discriminate between the dominant retailer (frequently chain stores) and independents. Such price-discrimination can be implemented legally through <b>trade</b> <b>promotions</b> and induces different inventory-ordering behaviors on the part of retailers. Differences in inventory holding costs have been shown to be an important determinant of consumer promotions. The analysis suggests that differences in holding costs may also be an important driver of the use of <b>trade</b> <b>promotions.</b> ...|$|R
