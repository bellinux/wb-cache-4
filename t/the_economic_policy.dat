During Prime Minister Paavo Lipponen's two successive governments 1995–2003, several large state companies were privatized fully or partially. Matti Vanhanen's two cabinets followed suit until autumn 2008, when the state became a major shareholder in the Finnish telecom company Elisa with the intention to secure the Finnish ownership of a strategically important industry.|$|E

Compared to 1985, the state deficit grew from 0 to 109billion rubles; gold funds decreased from 2,000 to 200 tons; and external debt grew from 0 to 120billion dollars.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>economic</b> <b>policy</b> stance {{currently}} dominant {{around the}} world uses unemployment as a policy tool to control inflation; when cost pressures rise, the standard monetary policy {{carried out by the}} monetary authority (central bank) tightens interest rates, creating a buffer stock of unemployed people, which reduces wage demands, and ultimately inflation. When inflationary expectations subside, these people will get their jobs back. In Marxian terms, the unemployed serve as a reserve army of labor. By contrast, in a job guarantee program, a buffer stock of employed people (employed in the job guarantee program) provides the same protection against inflation without the social costs of unemployment, hence potentially fulfilling the dual mandate of full employment and price stability.|$|E

25|$|Fascists {{claimed that}} this {{system would be}} egalitarian and {{traditional}} at the same time. <b>The</b> <b>economic</b> <b>policy</b> of corporatism quickly faltered: the left-wing elements of the Fascist manifesto were opposed by industrialists and landowners who supported the party because it pledged to defend Italy from socialism. As a result, corporatist policy became dominated by the industries. Initially, economic legislation mostly favoured the wealthy industrial and agrarian classes by allowing privatization, liberalization of rent laws, tax cuts and administrative reform. However, economic policy changed drastically following the Matteotti Crisis where Mussolini began pushing for a totalitarian state. In 1926, the Syndical laws (also known as the Rocco laws) were passed, organizing the economy into 12 separate employer and employee unions. The unions were largely state-controlled and were mainly used to suppress opposition and reward political loyalty. While the Fascist unions could not protect workers from all economic consequences, they {{were responsible for the}} handling of social security benefits, claims for severance pay and could sometimes negotiate contracts that benefited workers.|$|E
25|$|The {{government}} also carried out an import substitution policy, taking what {{was obtained by}} agriculture to give support to the industrial sector, trading agricultural product exports for foreign currency to import industrial machinery, thus developing the industrial sector. The government raised tariffs, controlled foreign exchange and restricted imports {{in order to protect}} domestic industry. By the 1960s, Taiwan's import exchange industry was faced with the problem of saturating the domestic market. At the same time, the factories of some industrialized nations, because of rising wages and other reasons, slowly moved to certain areas that had both basic industry and low labor costs. By slow steps, <b>the</b> <b>economic</b> <b>policy</b> of Taiwan changed to pursue export expansion under advice of academic economists such as Ta-Chung Liu and Sho-Chieh Tsiang of Cornell University. They also promoted allowing interest rates to rise, to encourage domestic savings and expand the amount of resources available to fund new businesses. Additional academic advisers also members of Academic Sinica provided sound advice encouraging innovation in agricultural techniques, enabling one of the few successful takeoffs toward modern growth based on agricultural investment in cash crops for export.|$|E
25|$|From 1940 {{and until}} 1980, Greater Mexico City {{experienced}} an intense rate of demographic growth concurrent with <b>the</b> <b>economic</b> <b>policy</b> of import substitution. Mexican industrial production was heavily centralized in Greater Mexico City {{during this period}} which produced intense immigration to the city. Close to 52% of the economically active population of Greater Mexico City worked in the industry sector in 1970. This situation changed drastically {{during the period of}} 1980 to 2000, in which the economic based shifted to the service sector which in 2000 employed close to 70% of the economically active population in the conurbation. The annual rate of growth decreased sharply as well as the regional and national patterns of immigration: residents are moving out of the core city to the suburbs or to nearby cities, whereas the northern states now receive a larger number of immigrants as new hubs of industrial production. Greater Mexico City's main industries are now related to trade, financial services, insurance companies, telecommunications, informatics and transportation. In spite of the recent shifts in economic production and the decentralization of the economic activity promoted by the government, Greater Mexico City's share of total economic activity in the country is still high, though decreasing. Mexico City proper alone produces 15.8% of the nation's Gross Domestic Product, larger than any of the states.|$|E

500|$|The {{economy was}} a great concern during the Ford administration. One of the first acts the new {{president}} took {{to deal with the}} economy was to create, by Executive Order on September 30, 1974, <b>the</b> <b>Economic</b> <b>Policy</b> Board. In October 1974, in response to rising inflation, Ford went before the American public and asked them to [...] "Whip Inflation Now". As part of this program, he urged people to wear [...] "WIN" [...] buttons. At the time, inflation was believed to be the primary threat to the economy, more so than growing unemployment; there was a belief that controlling inflation would help reduce unemployment. To rein in inflation, it was necessary to control the public's spending. To try to mesh service and sacrifice, [...] "WIN" [...] called for Americans to reduce their spending and consumption. On October 4, 1974, Ford gave a speech in front of a joint session of Congress; as a part of this speech he kicked off the [...] "WIN" [...] campaign. Over the next nine days 101,240 Americans mailed in [...] "WIN" [...] pledges. In hindsight, this was viewed as simply a public relations gimmick which had no way of solving the underlying problems. The main point of that speech was to introduce to Congress a one-year, five-percent income tax increase on corporations and wealthy individuals. This plan would also take $4.4billion out of the budget, bringing federal spending below $300billion. At the time, inflation was over twelve percent.|$|E
