5|$|The childless Raymond III of <b>Tripoli</b> {{decided to}} {{bequeath}} his county to his godson, Raymond, who was Bohemond's elder brother. Bohemond III of Antioch sent Bohemond to <b>Tripoli,</b> because {{the union of}} Antioch and <b>Tripoli</b> under one monarch could jeopardize the defence of both crusader states. Raymond III of <b>Tripoli</b> ordered his vassals to do homage to Bohemond. The dying count, {{who was a member}} of the House of Toulouse, also prescribed that should an other member of his family come from Toulouse, Bohemond should cede the County of <b>Tripoli</b> to him. Raymond died in late 1187. Charters issued during the first years of Bohemond's rule imply that his elder brother was regarded a titular count of <b>Tripoli</b> for a while.|$|E
5|$|As part of Commodore Richard Dale's Mediterranean Squadron, Enterprise {{had been}} {{deployed}} with the American force blockading the Vilayet of <b>Tripoli.</b> Enterprise, {{under the command}} of Lieutenant Andrew Sterett, had been sent by Commodore Dale to gather supplies at Malta. While cruising towards Malta, Enterprise engaged <b>Tripoli,</b> commanded by Admiral Rais Mahomet Rous. <b>Tripoli</b> put up a stubborn fight, and the engagement lasted for three hours before the polacca was finally captured by the Americans.|$|E
5|$|Bohemond was {{installed}} as prince {{after his mother}} was dethroned. Nur ad-Din laid siege to Krak des Chevaliers in the County of <b>Tripoli</b> in September 1163. Raymond III of <b>Tripoli</b> appealed to Bohemond for assistance. Bohemond and Constantine Kalamanos, Byzantine governor of Cilicia, hurried to the castle. The united Christian armies defeated the besiegers in the Battle of al-Buqaia.|$|E

5|$|The Battle of <b>Tripoli</b> was {{a battle}} between the navies of the Kingdom of Sardinia and Vilayet of <b>Tripoli</b> on 26 September 1825 during the Sardinian-Tripolitanian war of the same year. In order to resist Tripolitanian demands for {{increased}} tribute, the Sardinian king sent a squadron to force <b>Tripoli</b> to a favorable peace treaty. The Tripolitanians refused to change their demands {{and as a result}} the Sardinian squadron assaulted the city of <b>Tripoli,</b> sinking several vessels and landing a force to attack the city. Suffering heavy naval losses the Tripolitanian government quickly agreed to a favorable peace treaty with Sardinia, thus ending the war on favorable terms for the Sardinians.|$|E
5|$|After Saladin conquered {{almost the}} whole Kingdom of Jerusalem {{in the second}} half of 1187, Sibylla, Queen of Jerusalem, sought shelter in <b>Tripoli,</b> which became a center of her supporters. The noblemen who {{condemned}} her husband, Guy of Lusignan, for the fall of the kingdom, joined Conrad of Montferrat at Tyros. Saladin decided to invade the crusader states in Syria. He started his military campaign against <b>Tripoli</b> in May 1188, but the arrival of the fleet of William II of Sicily saved the town. After Saladin captured Tortosa and Jabala (present-day Tartus and Jableh in Syria) in July, only <b>Tripoli,</b> Krak des Chevaliers, and the citadel at Tortosa remained under Christian rule in the county.|$|E
5|$|Alice again laid {{claim to}} the regency. However, most Antiochene lords {{remained}} hostile {{to the idea of}} a female ruler and sent envoys to BaldwinII's successor, Fulk of Anjou, who was Alice's brother-in-law. Alice made an alliance with Joscelin II, Count of Edessa, and Pons, Count of <b>Tripoli,</b> in early 1132. Fulk had to travel to Antioch by sea, because Pons did not allow him to march through the County of <b>Tripoli.</b> Fulk landed at St. Symeon where the Antiochene barons acknowledged him as regent. He appointed Reynald I Mazoir, Constable of Antioch, to administer the principality.|$|E

5|$|Although the Americans {{had taken}} the vessel, Sterett had no orders to take prizes and so was obliged to release her. Enterprise {{completed}} her journey to Malta, and received honor and praise from the squadron's Commodore on her return to the fleet. The success of the battle boosted morale in the United States, since it was that country's first victory {{in the war against}} the Tripolitans. The opposite occurred in <b>Tripoli,</b> where morale sank heavily upon learning of <b>Tripoli</b> defeat. Despite Enterprise triumph, the war continued indecisively for another four years.|$|E
5|$|Barron's fragile health necessitated his resignation; {{he passed}} command to John Rodgers in late May 1805. Barron ordered Cox to command Essex, and turned President {{over to his}} brother, James Barron, on 29May. On 3June, after the Battle of Derne, the U.S signed a peace treaty with <b>Tripoli.</b> President sailed for the United States on 13July, {{carrying}} the ailing Barron and many sailors released from captivity in <b>Tripoli.</b>|$|E
5|$|Bohemond of <b>Tripoli</b> {{regarded}} himself his father's lawful heir, {{because he}} was Bohemond's elder surviving son. He came to Antioch {{at the end of}} 1198 and persuaded the commune to accept his rule. Before long, the younger Bohemond returned to <b>Tripoli,</b> enabling his father to re-take control of state affairs, suggesting that the elder Bohemond had tacitly supported his son's coup. LeoI of Cilicia appealed to the Holy See to protect Raymond-Roupen's interest, but the Knights Templar submitted a complaint against him for refusing to restore Bagras to them.|$|E

In 996 his forces raided the environs of <b>Tripoli</b> and Arqa, while Manjutakin, again without success, laid siege to Aleppo and Antartus, but {{was forced to}} withdraw when Dalassenos with his army came to relieve the fortress. The next year, Dalassenos repeated his raids against <b>Tripoli,</b> Rafaniya, Awgh, and al-Lakma, capturing the latter. At the same time, the inhabitants of Tyre, {{under the leadership of}} a sailor named Allaqa, rose up in revolt against the Fatimids and requested Byzantine assistance; further south, in Palestine, the Bedouin leader Mufarrij ibn Daghfal ibn al-Jarrah attacked Ramlah.|$|E

5|$|John of Ibelin, who was {{the leader}} of Emperor Frederick's opponents in the kingdoms of Jerusalem and Cyprus, tried to {{convince}} Bohemond to support their cause. John sent his son, Balian, to <b>Tripoli</b> to negotiate with Bohemond, but the elderly Bohemond remained neutral in the conflict. Bohemond died in March 1233, {{a few weeks before the}} pope's confirmation of his treaty with the Hospitallers came to <b>Tripoli.</b> He was regarded as a great jurist by his contemporaries.|$|E
5|$|Leopold VI, Duke of Austria, who {{landed at}} Acre {{in late summer}} 1217, invited Bohemond to join the Fifth Crusade. Bohemond and his vassals marched to Acre. However, the crusade ended in failure {{because of the lack}} of a united command. Bohemond left the Kingdom of Jerusalem {{together}} with Andrew II of Hungary and Hugh I of Cyprus in January 1218. Andrew attended at the wedding of Bohemond and Hugh's half-sister, Melisende of Lusignan, in <b>Tripoli.</b> During the same year, Moslem troops made a plundering raid against the County of <b>Tripoli.</b>|$|E

On 30January Chesapeake and the squadron got underway for <b>Tripoli,</b> where Morris planned to burn Tripolitan {{ships in the}} harbor. Heavy gales made the approach to <b>Tripoli</b> difficult. Fearing Chesapeake would lose her masts from the strong winds, Morris returned to Malta on 10February. With provisions for the ships running low and none available near Malta, Morris decided to abandon plans to blockade <b>Tripoli</b> and sailed the squadron back to Gibraltar for provisioning. They made stops at Tunis on 22February and Algiers on 19March. Chesapeake arrived at Gibraltar on 23March, where Morris transferred his command to New York. Under James Barron, Chesapeake sailed for the United States on 7April and she was placed in reserve at the Washington Navy Yard on 1June.|$|E
5|$|Muhammad's {{taxation}} {{was considered}} exploitative by <b>Tripoli</b> Eyalet's inhabitants. Yusuf Sayfa {{refused to pay}} taxes to Muhammad, prompting the latter to attempt collecting them through military means. However, while {{en route to the}} Akkar to pressure the Sayfas, Muhammad was shot dead outside of <b>Tripoli</b> on Yusuf Sayfa's orders in 1591. Muhammad's death with no male heirs marked the end of Assaf rule. Following his death, Yusuf Sayfa was transferred control of the Assafs' nawahi in <b>Tripoli</b> Eyalet, and he expelled the Hubaysh clan, promoting his Shia Muslim Hamade allies from Jbeil at their expense. In 1593, Yusuf Sayfa wed Muhammad's widow and thus acquired the Assafs' wealth. He concurrently took control over Keserwan and Assaf properties in Beirut.|$|E
5|$|Property in the County of <b>Tripoli,</b> {{granted to}} the Knights in the 1140s, {{included}} the Krak des Chevaliers, the towns of Rafanea and Montferrand, and the Beqa'a plain separating Homs and <b>Tripoli.</b> Homs was never under Crusader control, so the region around the Krak des Chevaliers was vulnerable to expeditions from the city. While its proximity caused the Knights problems with regard to defending their territory, it also meant Homs was close {{enough for them to}} raid. Because of the castle's command of the plain, it became the Knights' most important base in the area.|$|E
