50|$|In piston {{aircraft}} engines, continuous-flow {{fuel injection}} {{is the most}} common type. In contrast to automotive fuel injection systems, aircraft continuous flow fuel injection is all mechanical, requiring no electricity to operate. Two common types exist: the Bendix RSA system, and the TCM system. The Bendix system is a direct descendant of the pressure carburetor. However, instead of having a discharge valve in the barrel, it uses a flow divider mounted on top of the engine, which controls the discharge rate and evenly distributes the fuel to stainless steel injection lines to the intake ports of each cylinder. The TCM system is even more simple. It has no venturi, no pressure chambers, no diaphragms, and no discharge valve. The control unit is fed by a constant-pressure fuel pump. The control unit simply uses a butterfly valve for the air, which is linked by a mechanical linkage to a rotary valve for the fuel. Inside the control unit is another restriction, which controls the fuel mixture. The pressure drop across the restrictions in <b>the</b> <b>control</b> <b>unit</b> <b>controls</b> the amount of fuel flow, so that fuel flow is directly proportional to the pressure at the flow divider. In fact, most aircraft that use the TCM fuel injection system feature a fuel flow gauge that is actually a pressure gauge calibrated in gallons per hour or pounds per hour of fuel.|$|E

The drive unit operates the planar-coil-type actuator in response to commands from the control unit.

Even though the developed tactile stimulating system is small, simple, and inexpensive, it has {{a wide range of}} stimulation frequencies (20 ~ 400 Hz, at 40 levels) and stimulation intensities (0 ~ 7 V, at 256 levels).

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the work around three laboratory experiments {{conducted in the}} machinery laboratory at MARINTEK with focus on performance and degrading mechanisms of a Selective Catalytic Reduction system. Höegh LNG {{has contributed to the}} thesis from an industrial perspective together with various Norwegian shipping companies. An introduction to emissions from combustion engines is given, with focus of the real pollutants as NO x, SO x, CO, HC and PM. CO 2 has not been defined as a real pollutant as it’s  not itself toxic, but still is a major concern due to it’s contribution to the greenhouse effect. The real pollutants only represents about 0, 6 % of the total emissions from a combustion engine. An introduction to today’s and future emission limits has been presented. The system consists of a catalyst that contains ceramic stones with a honeycomb shape. The honeycombs contain the active material that reacts with the NH 3 introduced in the exhaust gas and reduce the NO x to N 2 and H 2 O. The honeycombs may be coated with the active material or homogeneously extruded. <b>The</b> <b>control</b> <b>unit</b> <b>controls</b> the urea feed rate, and the urea react with water and together with the exhaust heat becomes NH 3. The system efficiency is dependent on the ammonia feed rate and a 90 to 95 % reduction of NO x is possible. Higher efficiency is possible, however with increased risk of NH 3 slip. Degrading mechanisms have been investigated with respect to fatigue and deposits. The SO 2 to SO 3 conversion rate sets the basis for formation of deposits, and hence should be reduced as much as possible. With respect to fatigue, we investigated with a laboratory experiment whether the temperature variations were sufficient to cause any thermal strain on the honeycombs. This hypothesis was undermined as the temperature variations logged were in the lower edge of 10 o C. Whether logging of temperatures can function as indicators of degrading of the catalyst were investigated in a second experiment. The approach was to search for a correlation between the temperature in the catalyst material (T Center) and the catalyst activity as degrading of the lab catalyst require many hours of operation. We did not find a clear connection between the two, however a connection between the activity and temperature difference Δ T = T 2 − T 1 was discovered. This will be a topic for further investigation by MARINTEK. The performance of the SCR in the machinery lab has been documented, with a reduction efficiency of 95 % in compliance with international ammonia slip level requirement. A bleed of the turbocharger compressor was performed in order see if increased the exhaust gas temperature would increase the reduction efficiency. This was not the case as we achieved same reduction efficiency with somewhat higher slip. The increased NO x emission level  has been corrected for. A FTIR gas analyzer was rented by MARINTEK in order to verify the accuracy of their Horiba PG- 250. When comparing the two instruments, deviations were neglectable. The number one challenge for SCR according to shipping companies is to ensure satisfying reduction efficiency when the engine is experiencing frequent load changes. Together with this the challenge is to get SCR working properly with low speed two stroke engines operating on HFO. </p...|$|E

40|$|The {{main focus}} of this {{research}} is to develop a digital neural network (processor) and hardware (VLSI) implementation of the same for detection applications, for example in the distance protection of power transmission lines. Using a hardware neural processor will improve the protection system performance over software implementations in terms of speed of operation, response time for faults etc. The main aspects of this research are software design, performance analysis, hardware design and hardware implementation of the digital neural processor. The software design is carried out by developing an object oriented neural network simulator with backpropagation training using C++ language. A preliminary analysis shows that the inputs to the neural network need to be preprocessed. Two filters have been developed for this purpose, based on the analysis of the training data available. The performance analysis involves studying quantization effects (determination of precision requirements) in the network. [...] The hardware design involves design of the neural network and the preprocessors. The neural processor consists of three types of processing elements (neurons) : input, hidden and output neurons. The input neurons form the input layer of the processor which receive input from the preprocessors. The input layer can be configured to directly receive external input by changing the mode of operation. The output layer gives the signal to the relay for tripping the line under fault. Each neuron consists of datapath and local <b>control</b> <b>unit.</b> Datapath consists of <b>the</b> components for forward and backward passes of the processor and the register file. <b>The</b> local <b>control</b> <b>unit</b> <b>controls</b> <b>the</b> flow of data within a neuron and co-ordinates with <b>the</b> global <b>control</b> <b>unit</b> which <b>controls</b> <b>the</b> flow of data between layers. The neurons and the layers are pipelined for improving the throughput of the processor. The neural processor and the filters are implemented in VLSI using hardware description language (VHDL) and Synopsys / Cadence CAD tools. All the components are individually verified and tested for their functionality and implemented using 0. 5 μ CMOS technology...|$|R
