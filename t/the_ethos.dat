5|$|The Scottish Symphony (Symphony No. 3 in A minor) {{was written}} and revised {{intermittently}} between 1829 (when Mendelssohn noted down the opening theme {{during a visit}} to Holyrood Palace) and 1842, when it was given its premiere in Leipzig, the last of his symphonies to be performed in public. This piece evokes Scotland's atmosphere in <b>the</b> <b>ethos</b> of Romanticism, but does not employ any identified Scottish folk melodies.|$|E
5|$|Work {{began in}} 1954 on {{construction}} of the building to Glanz's plans, using Tehnika, a Ljubljana construction firm.

5|$|Xenogears {{initially}} {{takes place}} on Ignas, the largest continent of the Xenogears world, and {{the site of a}} centuries-long war between the nations of Aveh and Kislev. A church-like organization known as <b>the</b> <b>Ethos</b> has excavated gears (giant robot suits), ostensibly for the preservation of the world's culture. Although Kislev originally had the upper hand in the war, a mysterious army known as Gebler appeared and began to provide assistance to Aveh. With Gebler's help, the Aveh military not only recovered its losses, but began making its way into Kislev's territory. As the story unfolds, the setting broadens to encompass the entire world and the two floating countries, Shevat and Solaris. Solaris, ruled by Emperor Cain and an AI collective known as the Gazel Ministry, commands the Gebler army and <b>the</b> <b>Ethos</b> and secretly uses both to dominate the land-dwellers. Shevat has been the only country to evade the control of Solaris.|$|E

The town itself is a popular tourist spot during the Thanksgiving holiday. Plymouth is home to the Old Colony Club, one of the oldest Gentlemen's clubs in the world.|$|E
5|$|In 1960 Newman {{devised a}} thriller series for ABC called Police Surgeon, {{starring}} Ian Hendry. Although Police Surgeon {{was not a}} success and was cancelled after only a short run, Newman took Hendry as the star, and some of <b>the</b> <b>ethos</b> of the programme, {{to create a new}} series (not a direct sequel as is sometimes claimed) called The Avengers. Debuting in January 1961, The Avengers became an international success, although in later years its premise differed somewhat from Newman's initial set-up, veering into more humorous territory rather than remaining a gritty thriller.|$|E

5|$|Regarded as a {{major event}} in British culture, the festival is {{inspired}} by <b>the</b> <b>ethos</b> of the hippie, counterculture, and free festival movements. It retains vestiges of these traditions, such as the Green Fields area, which includes sections known as the Green Futures and Healing Fields. After the 1970s, the festival took place almost every year and grew in size, {{with the number of}} attendees sometimes being swollen by gatecrashers. Michael Eavis hosted the first festival, then called Pilton Festival, after seeing an open-air Led Zeppelin concert at the 1970 Bath Festival of Blues and Progressive Music.|$|E
5|$|The French motto Quant Je Puis (As Much as I Can) {{is central}} to <b>the</b> <b>ethos</b> of the school, which focuses upon the all-round {{development}} of the individual. It is inherited from the Shireburn family who once owned the original mansion on the site; the family emblem is emblazoned, in stone, with the motto, above the fireplace in the Top Refectory. At {{the far end of}} the same room, once the dining room of the Shireburns, the motto can be seen again, carved into the minstrel's gallery: Quant Je Puis. Hugo Sherburn armig. me fieri fecit. Anno Domini 1523. Et sicut fuit sic fiat.|$|E
5|$|The P.1127 lacked any in-built armaments, <b>the</b> <b>ethos</b> of {{tactical}} flexibility meant a reliance upon underwing hard point-mounted munitions and equipment, which included multiple 2-inch rocket batteries, 30-mm ADEN cannon gun pods, and 1,000 lb bombs, napalm, and range-extending drop tanks. The prototypes were furnished with long nose-mounted instrumentation booms, these were replaced on the Kestrel {{with a much}} smaller counterpart on the vertical stabilizer to enable the nose to accommodate a tactical camera instead. An unusual feature of the P.1127 was the installation of a ram air turbine upon the rear fuselage just forward of the vertical stabilizer to provide power for ancillary services {{in the event of}} engine failure.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>ethos</b> of the {{aristocracy}} as exemplified in the English public school greatly influenced Pierre de Coubertin. The public schools subscribed {{to the belief}} that sport formed an important part of education, an attitude summed up in the saying mens sana in corpore sano, a sound mind in a sound body. In this ethos, a gentleman was one who became an all-rounder, not the best at one specific thing. There was also a prevailing concept of fairness, in which practising or training was considered tantamount to cheating. Those who practised a sport professionally were considered to have an unfair advantage over those who practised it merely as a hobby.|$|E
5|$|Pursuant to dynastic imperatives and <b>the</b> <b>ethos</b> of the time, {{the nobles}} {{required}} Tamar to marry {{in order to}} have a leader for the army and to provide an heir to the throne. Their choice fell on Yuri, son of the murdered prince Andrei I Bogolyubsky of Vladimir-Suzdal, who then lived as a refugee among the Kipchaks of the North Caucasus. The choice was approved by Tamar's aunt Rusudan and the prince was brought to Georgia to marry the queen in 1185. Yuri proved to be an able soldier, but a difficult person and he soon ran afoul of his wife. The strained spousal relations paralleled a factional struggle at the royal court in which Tamar was becoming more and more assertive of her rights as a queen regnant. The turning point in Tamar's fortunes came with the death of the powerful Catholicos-Patriarch Michael whom the queen replaced, as a chancellor, with her supporter, Anton Gnolistavisdze. Tamar gradually expanded her own power-base and elevated her loyal nobles to high positions at the court, most notably the Zakarids-Mkhargrzeli.|$|E
5|$|The Chief of the Army Staff (COAS) General P. P. Kumaramangalam was due {{to retire}} in June 1969. Though Manekshaw was the most senior {{commander}} in army, Defence Minister Sardar Swaran Singh was in favour of Lieutenant General Harbaksh Singh, who had {{played a key role}} as the GOC-in-C of Western Command during the 1965 Indo-Pakistani war. Despite this, Manekshaw was appointed as the 8th Chief of the Army Staff on 8 June 1969. As the Chief of the Army Staff, he developed the Indian Army into an efficient instrument of war. During his tenure as COAS, he was instrumental in stopping the implementation of reservations for scheduled castes and scheduled tribes in the army. Though he was Parsi, a minority group in India, Mankeshaw felt that implementing reservations would compromise <b>the</b> <b>ethos</b> of the army; he also felt all must be given an equal chance.|$|E
