25|$|Paulson {{agreed with}} Bernanke {{that the only}} way to unlock the frozen capital markets was to provide direct {{injections}} into financial institutions so investors would have confidence in these institutions. The government would take a non-voting share position, with 5% dividends for the first year on the money lent to the banks and 9% thereafter until the banks stabilized and could repay the government loans. According to the book <b>Too</b> <b>Big</b> <b>To</b> <b>Fail,</b> Paulson, Bernanke, New York Federal Reserve Chairman Timothy Geithner, and FDIC Chairman Sheila Bair attended the meeting on October 13, 2008, at which this plan was presented to the CEOs of nine major banks.|$|E

500|$|The {{most recent}} reform came {{into effect in}} July 2010 when President Obama signed [...] "The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act". The act covers {{a broad range of}} changes. The {{highlights}} of the legislation are consumer protections with authority and independence, ends <b>too</b> <b>big</b> <b>to</b> <b>fail</b> bail outs, advance warning system, transparency and accountability for exotic instruments, executive compensation and corporate governance, protects investors, and enforces regulations on the books. The legislation also resulted in the Office of the Whistleblower, which was established to administer the SEC's whistleblower program. Congress authorized the SEC to provide monetary awards to whistleblowers who come forward with information that results in a minimum of a $1,000,000 sanction. The rewards are between 10% and 30% of the dollar amount collected. Whistleblowers help identify fraud and other unethical behaviors early on. The result is less harm to investors, quickly holding offenders responsible, and to maintain the integrity of the U.S. markets.|$|E

Wallace, ChairWhile playing Hamlet, I {{often felt}} overwhelmed, {{stressed}} out, and afraid. I {{struggled with the}} daunting and difficult nature of the role, but within that struggle, I found {{a deeper understanding of}} many of the concepts central to my training at UCSD. I had to trust and rely on that training, because Hamlet is just <b>too</b> <b>big</b> <b>to</b> do otherwise. Hamlet is <b>too</b> <b>big</b> <b>to</b> control. It's <b>too</b> <b>big</b> <b>to</b> be neat or safe. I had to let it to be a mess and allow myself to be wrong. Hamlet is <b>too</b> <b>big</b> <b>to</b> play emotion. How could I ever be sad enough? I had to play actions instead. Hamlet is <b>too</b> <b>big</b> <b>to</b> do all at once, and too vast to let the story go untold. I had to live one moment at a time and strive for clarity of thought and language. Hamlet is far <b>too</b> <b>big</b> <b>to</b> do alone. I had to listen to my cast mates, and allow them to affect, change, and lift me. Hamlet is too damn long, and too damn hard, not to have any fun, and I found joy and humor in places that I never expected. And lastly, Hamlet is far <b>too</b> <b>big</b> <b>to</b> ever be finished, and every performance was an opportunity to grow, and discover anew. Playing Hamlet forced me to be active, strive for clarity, discover, have fun, and much more. I'm a better actor now than when I started. Hamlet is just <b>too</b> <b>big</b> for anything less...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the challenges involved in the transformation of the prison into a performance-oriented accounting entity. It examines the implication of private sector accounting and consulting expertise in redefining prison values and prison performance, and it discusses the consequences this had for definitions of risk and responsibility. The paper shows how the reforms promoted a systemic decentring of Prison Service accountability. Prison managers and regulators came to be inserted into hierarchies of expertise and credibility shaped by quests for commensuration and auditability. Further, the paper shows how the reform attempts brought about a situation of institutional lock-in by contributing, as the outgoing HM Chief Inspector of Prisons Anne Owers has put it in 2010, to the creation of an inflated prison system ‘too <b>big</b> <b>to</b> <b>fail,</b> and <b>too</b> <b>big</b> <b>to</b> succeed'...|$|R

However, the emergence of systemically important firms, most notably in the financial sector, constrains prosecutors. This paper develops {{a new model of}} corporate criminal liability and shows how the <b>Too</b> <b>Big</b> <b>To</b> Jail problem reduces the deterrence effect of a crime control policy relying primarily on large corporate fines. Furthermore, this paper shows how corporate criminal liability may not incentivize a <b>Too</b> <b>Big</b> <b>to</b> Jail firm to invest in internal controls and may even attempt to subsidize an employees’ criminal activity.
