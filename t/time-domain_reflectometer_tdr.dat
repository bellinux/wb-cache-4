The Switches also include {{an integrated}} packet sniffer built into every port that can export the information on to a web page report (see the jpg to the right, an example of top 25 talkers on a switch) or export the information to an IPFIX server. The web base reports will report top 10, 25, or 50 talkers.

Multiple ports can be monitored simultaneously or individually. A license {{is not required to}} enable this function. The Management of the system is accomplished through a serial console (which presents both a menu structure and a command line interface), a web interface or with the device manager tools, which uses SNMP to communicate with the device.|$|E

40|$|This report {{presents}} {{methodology for}} excavating one-meter cubic undisturbed soil monoliths for detailed laboratory investigations of solute transport through the soil profile. Eight soil monoliths {{were collected in}} 1992 from three field areas that had been under consistent tillage systems since 1978. The soil was predominantly a Kenyon silt loam (Typic Hapludoll) with the water table maintained by subsurface drainage. Each monolith was instrumented with <b>time-domain</b> <b>reflectometer</b> (<b>TDR)</b> waveguides, and mini-tensiometers to monitor changes in soil water content and soil matric potential on three sides. A rainfall simulator was constructed to apply water at a rainfall intensity of 33 mm-h– 1 to a 0. 8 m × 0. 8 m surface area of the monolith. A conservative tracer (KBr) {{was applied to the}} soil surface and leachate samples were collected from 36 locations at the bottom of each monolith using fiberglass wick extractors attached to 810 mm 2 areas in a 6 × 6 grid arrangement. Water application, soil water content and leachate were monitored to determine how surface tillage affected preferential flow. Results suggest that the soil monolith collection and transportation procedures maintained the integrity of the soil profile. Anion tracers provided an inexpensive means of simulating different nitrogen application methods. Grid cell samplers using fiberglass wicks allowed analysis of the spatial variation in leaching losses. Leachate samples provided information about the potential impact of nitrogen application method on leaching losses. When coupled with time domain reflectometry and mini-tensiometers, electronic data logging equipment can be used to monitor changes in soil volumetric water content and matric potential...|$|E
40|$|Characterizing the {{dynamics}} of soil moisture fields is a key issue in hydrology, offering a strategy to improve our understanding of complex climate-soil-vegetation interactions. Apart from in-situ measurements and hydrological models, soil moisture dynamics can be inferred by analyzing data acquired by sensors aboard satellite platforms. In this work, we investigated {{the use of the}} National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration – Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (NOAA-AMSU) radiometer for the remote characterization of soil water content. To this aim, a field measurement campaign, lasted about three months, was carried out using a portable <b>time-domain</b> <b>reflectometer</b> (<b>TDR)</b> to get soil water content measures over five different locations within an experimental basin of 32. 5 km 2 , located in the South of Italy. In detail, soil moisture measurements have been carried out systematically at the times of satellite overpasses, over two square areas of 400 m 2 , a triangular area of 200 m 2 and two transects of 60 and 170 m, respectively. Each monitored site is characterized by different land covers and soil textures, to account for spatial heterogeneity of land surface. Afterwards, a more extensive comparison (i. e. analyzing a 5 -yr data time series) has been made using soil moisture simulated by a hydrological model. Achieved measured and modeled soil moisture data were compared with two AMSU-based indices: the Surface Wetness Index (SWI) and the Soil Wetness Variation Index (SWVI). Both indices have been filtered to account for soil depth by means of an exponential filter. This allowed to understand the ability of each satellite-based index to account for soil moisture dynamics and to understand its performances under different conditions. As a general remark, the comparison shows a higher ability of the filtered SWI to describe the state of the soil, while the SWVI can capture soil moisture variations with a precision that increases at the higher values of SWVI and it may represent a useful and reliable tool to frequently monitor the soil moisture state for flood forecasting purposes...|$|E
40|$|Conserving more {{soil water}} {{is of great}} {{importance}} to the sustainability of arid and semiarid orchards. Here we integrated fish-scale pits, semicircular mini-catchments for hill slope runoff collection, with mulches to test their effects on soil water storage in a 12 -year-old dryland jujube orchard on the Loess Plateau of China, by using soil water measurements from April  2013 to November  2014. This experiment included four treatments: fish-scale pits with branch mulching (FB), fish-scale pits with straw mulching (FS), fish-scale pits without mulching (F), and bare land treatment (CK). Soil water was measured using the TRIME ® -IPH <b>time-domain</b> <b>reflectometer</b> (<b>TDR)</b> tool in 20  cm intervals down {{to a depth of}} 180  cm, and was measured once every 2 weeks in the 2013 and 2014 growing seasons. The results showed that fish-scale pits with mulching were better in soil water conservation. Average soil water storage (SWS, for short) of FB at soil layer depths of 0 – 180  cm increased by 14. 23  % (2013) and 21. 81  % (2014), respectively, compared to CK, but only increased by 4. 82  % (2013) and 5. 34  % (2014), respectively, for the F treatment. The degree of soil water compensation, W S, was employed here to represent to what extent soil water was recharged from precipitation {{at the end of the}} rainy season relative to that at the beginning of the rainy season. A positive (negative) W S larger (lower) soil water content at the end of rainy season than at the beginning. For the treatment of FB, the values of W S over the entire soil profile were greater than 0; for the treatment of F, negative values of W S were observed in depths of 60 – 100  cm in both years. However, the bare land treatment showed negative values in depths of 40 – 180  cm. This indicated that integrating fish-scale pits with mulching could significantly increase soil water storage by increasing infiltration and decreasing evaporation, and it showed greater soil water storage and degree of soil water compensation compared to fish-scale pits alone. Since the branches used for mulching here were trimmed jujube branches, the cost of mulching materials was largely reduced. Therefore, integration of fish-scale pits with branch mulching is recommended in orchards for soil water conservation on the Loess Plateau and potentially for other regions...|$|E
