40|$|Ultracold {{neutrons}} (UCN) are neutrons of {{very low}} energies, enough to undergo total reflection from a given surface at any angle of incidence. As a result, {{they can be}} confined to a material trap when their kinetic energies are smaller than the Fermi potential of the trap material. However, they can be lost from the trap via nuclear capture reaction and <b>thermal</b> <b>inelastic</b> <b>scattering</b> from the trap surface. They can also be lost by quasi-elastic scattering when the energy gain is sufficient to exceed the Fermi potential. ^ Possible models of UCN quasi-elastic scattering are interactions with hydrogen diffusing in an impurity surface layer or with surface waves of a liquid. Using two different experimental methods we investigated both the energy-loss and the energy-gain side of quasi-elastic scattering from a Fomblin grease surface. Fomblin is a perfluorinated polymer. We also measured the up-scattering effects for various Fomblin liquids {{as a function of}} temperature and energy transfer. For a new Fomblin oil, the measured quasi-elastic up-scattering probability tends to be negligible at low temperature T 3 ̆c 150 K. ^ We performed storage lifetime measurements using UCN traps coated with the new oil. We achieved the longest storage lifetime τs = 872 ± 2 s at T 110 K, which is only 1. 5...|$|E

The caged guests exhibit a localized "rattling" vibrational mode that provides an efficient mechanism for reducing the <b>thermal</b> conductivity. <b>Inelastic</b> neutron <b>scattering</b> and nuclear <b>inelastic</b> <b>scattering</b> measurements have yielded the phonon density of states in R 8 Ga 16 Ge 30; the line width of the localized vibrational modes {{is found to be}} an important parameter in determining the lattice thermal conductivity. Neutron diffraction studies on R 8 Ga 16 Ge 30 have shown that the guests in the larger cage are located off-center, and it was proposed that their jumping about the four off-center locations is responsible for the observed glass-like thermal conductivity at temperatures below 10 K. The detection of such slow guest motion is challenging because the typical time and energy scales involved are ca. 4 ns and 1 mu eV, respectively.

40|$|Using high {{intensity}} (∼ 70 Ci) 183 Ta Mossbauer sources, we have measured the elastic scattering fraction values, F, {{and the relative}} integrated scattering intensities for several (nnn) and (h 00) Bragg reflections of three alkali halides: sodium chloride, potassium chloride, and potassium bromide. The experiments were done {{as a function of}} temperature from 85 K to 900 K. The F values were found by Mossbauer line-shape studies (1) and were used to correct the measured integrated intensities for <b>thermal</b> diffuse (<b>inelastic)</b> <b>scattering</b> so that the Debye-Waller factors could be accurately measured. Measured elastic intensities were directly corrected for thermal expansion, in constrast to earlier treatments of Debye-Waller factor data. We show that this is the only consistent way to analyse this type of data, and it also significantly reduces the strong correlation between parameters. We observed Q 4 contributions to the Debye-Waller factors in all three crystal, though the evidence is marginal in the case of KBr. This contribution varies with crystallographic orientation. After separating the scattering from the two ion types within the NaCl and KBr crystals, we found that for both NaCl and KBr the cations and anions have the same Debye-Waller factor, and thus the same mean-square displacement from equilibrium along the (111) direction. We account for this by the equipartition theorem. We also found that the Debye temperature and Q 2 T 2 term vary with crystallographic direction. We believe this to be the first direct evidence for a non-spherical thermal cloud in cubic crystals. ...|$|R
40|$|The lattice {{dynamics}} of TiO 2 in the rutile crystal structure was studied {{by a combination}} of <b>thermal</b> diffuse <b>scattering,</b> <b>inelastic</b> x-ray <b>scattering,</b> and density functional perturbation theory. We experimentally confirm the existence of a predicted anomalous soft transverse acoustic mode with energy minimum at q=(1 / 2 1 / 2 1 / 4). The phonon energy landscape of this particular branch is reported and compared to the calculation. The harmonic calculation underestimates the phonon energies but despite this the shape of both the energy landscape and the scattering intensities are well reproduced. We find a significant temperature dependence in the energy of this transverse acoustic mode over an extended region in reciprocal space, which point to a strong role of anharmonicity in line with a substantially anharmonic mode potential-energy surface. The reported low-energy branch {{is quite different from the}} ferroelectric mode that softens at the Brillouin zone center and may help explain anomalous convergence behavior in calculating TiO 2 surface properties and is potentially relevant for real behavior in TiO 2 thin films...|$|R

40|$|The {{ultimate}} {{energy resolution}} in <b>inelastic</b> <b>thermal</b> neutron <b>scattering</b> spectroscopy {{is provided by}} neutron spin echo (NSE) spectrometers. The characteristic of a NSE spectrometer is that it detects neutron-velocity changes by spin-coding. It measures the intermediate scattering function I(Q, t) in terms of final beam polarisation. High resolution in that case means {{the extension of the}} Fourier time (t) range towards 1 µs. The most important technical limitation to increase the resolution of NSE spectrometers results from the need to equalize the field integrals that determine the coding spin-precession angles along different neutron paths by combining a suitable precession field with correction coils. Here we report on the field shape optimisation and design of precession magnetic coil arrangements with minimal intrinsic field integral inhomogeneity for a wide and diverging neutron beam with a new semi-analytical approach and a numerical method. This minimizes the amount of additionally required correction. The solenoid configuration we found fulfils all the conditions required by a real NSE spectrometer...|$|R
