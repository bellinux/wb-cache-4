Impressed with Keenan's vocals, Jones {{suggested}} that <b>they</b> <b>form</b> <b>a</b> band. Reluctant, Keenan eventually agreed and, in 1988, Tool was formed. Fronted by Keenan, the eventual lineup included guitarist Jones; his neighbor, drummer Danny Carey; and bassist Paul D'Amour, {{who would later}} be replaced by Justin Chancellor.|$|E
5|$|Based on {{studies using}} morphology, immunology, {{repetitive}} DNA, SINE analysis, multilocus phylogenetic tests, and mitochondrial genes (mtDNA), giant mouse lemurs are most {{closely related to}} mouse lemurs within the family Cheirogaleidae, and together <b>they</b> <b>form</b> <b>a</b> clade with the hairy-eared dwarf lemur (Allocebus). Both dwarf lemurs and fork-marked lemurs are more distantly related, with fork-marked lemurs being either a sister group of all cheirogaleids, or {{more closely related to}} sportive lemurs (Lepilemur).|$|E

Albanians form a majority in Čair which roughly corresponds to the Old Bazaar, and in Saraj. <b>They</b> <b>form</b> <b>a</b> large minority in Butel and Gazi Baba.

5|$|Oils {{that are}} used include heavy {{residual}} oil (HRO), animal fats, vegetable fats, and synthetic fats. HROs are gelatinous at room temperature, but at the high temperatures found in die casting, <b>they</b> <b>form</b> <b>a</b> thin film. Other substances are added to control the emulsions viscosity and thermal properties; these include graphite, aluminium, and mica. Other chemical additives are used to inhibit rusting and oxidation. Emulsifiers are added to water-based lubricants, so that oil based additives can be mixed into the water; these include soap, alcohol esters, and ethylene oxides.|$|E
5|$|Pendulum Publications {{produced}} {{one more}} issue in October 1947, shortly before going bankrupt and thus leaving New Worlds without a publisher. The magazine was saved {{by a group}} of sf fans who since 1946 had been meeting regularly on Thursday nights at the White Horse public house on New Fetter Lane, near Fleet Street. At one of those meetings it was suggested that <b>they</b> <b>form</b> <b>a</b> company to revive New Worlds; one of those present, Frank Cooper, recently retired from the RAF, agreed to look into what would be necessary to start a new company.|$|E
5|$|Pteranodon were pterosaurs, not dinosaurs. By definition, all dinosaurs {{belong to}} one of the two groups within Dinosauria, i.e. Saurischia or Ornithischia. As such, this {{excludes}} pterosaurs. Nonetheless, Pteranodon are frequently featured in dinosaur media and are strongly associated with dinosaurs by the general public.

5|$|Roridula has a {{more complex}} {{relationship}} with its prey. The plants in this genus produce sticky leaves with resin-tipped glands that look {{similar to those of}} larger Drosera. However, the resin, unlike mucilage, is unable to carry digestive enzymes. Therefore, Roridula species do not directly benefit from the insects they catch. Instead, <b>they</b> <b>form</b> <b>a</b> mutualistic symbiosis with species of assassin bugs that eat the trapped insects. The plant benefits from the nutrients in the bugs' feces.|$|E
5|$|The {{grounds of}} Taunton Castle include the Somerset County Museum and The Castle Hotel, which {{incorporates}} the Castle Bow archway. Together with the municipal buildings <b>they</b> <b>form</b> <b>a</b> three-sided {{group of buildings}} just beyond the Castle Bow archway from Fore Street.

5|$|According to the Parliamentary paper Misc. 5 of 1966, the {{background}} of the ensign is red with the ratio of its width to its length being one by two. In contrast, the ratio of the national flag of Singapore is two by three. In the centre of the ensign is a white ring, which surrounds a crescent and five stars also coloured white. The five stars are arranged such that <b>they</b> <b>form</b> <b>a</b> pentagon in the middle. The crescent and stars are taken from the national flag, although in the ensign the crescent appears underneath rather than {{to the left of the}} stars. According to a 1999 circular National Colours for Singapore Ships issued by the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA), the red colour of the civil ensign is the same as that of the national flag. The shade of red has been defined by the Ministry of Information, Communications and the Arts as Pantone 032.|$|E

5|$|After rehearsing with Strummer {{for less}} than a month, the Clash made their debut on 4 July 1976, {{supporting}} the Sex Pistols at the Black Swan in Sheffield. The band apparently wanted to make it on-stage before their rivals in the Damned—another London SS spinoff—made their own scheduled debut two days later. The Clash would not play {{in front of an audience}} again for another five weeks. Levene was becoming disaffected with his position in the group. At the Black Swan, he approached the Sex Pistols' lead singer, John Lydon (then going by Johnny Rotten), and suggested <b>they</b> <b>form</b> <b>a</b> band together if the Pistols broke up.|$|E
5|$|Areoles {{are highly}} {{specialized}} and very condensed shoots or branches. In a normal shoot, nodes bearing leaves or flowers would be separated by lengths of stem (internodes). In an areole, the nodes {{are so close}} together, <b>they</b> <b>form</b> <b>a</b> single structure. The areole may be circular, elongated into an oval shape, or even separated into two parts; the two parts may be visibly connected in some way (e.g. by a groove in the stem) or appear entirely separate (a dimorphic areole). The part nearer {{the top of the}} stem then produces flowers, the other part spines. Areoles often have multicellular hairs (trichomes) that give the areole a hairy or woolly appearance, sometimes of a distinct color such as yellow or brown.|$|E
5|$|Cordyline australis {{is one of}} the few New Zealand {{forest trees}} that can recover from fire. It can renew its trunk from buds on the {{protected}} rhizomes under the ground. This gives the tree an advantage because it can regenerate itself quickly and the fire has eliminated competing plants. Cabbage tree leaves contain oils which make them burn readily. The same oils may also slow down the decay of fallen leaves, so that they build up a dense mat that prevents the seeds of other plants from germinating. When the leaves do break down, <b>they</b> <b>form</b> <b>a</b> fertile soil around the tree. Cabbage tree seed also has a store of oil, which means it remains viable for several years. When a bushfire has cleared the land of vegetation, cabbage tree seeds germinate in great numbers to make the most of the light and space opened up by the flames.|$|E
