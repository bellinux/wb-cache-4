40|$|This paper studies robust {{resource}} allocation algorithm {{design for a}} multiuser multiple-input single-output (MISO) cognitive radio (CR) downlink communication network. We focus on a secondary system which provides unicast secure wireless layered video information to multiple single-antenna secondary receivers. The {{resource allocation}} algorithm design is formulated as a non-convex optimization problem for minimization of the total transmit power at the secondary transmitter. The proposed framework takes into account a quality of service (QoS) requirement regarding video communication secrecy in the secondary system, the imperfection of the channel state information (CSI) of potential eavesdroppers (primary receivers) at the secondary transmitter, and a limit for the maximum <b>tolerable</b> received <b>interference</b> power at the primary receivers. Thereby, the proposed problem formulation exploits the self-protecting architecture of layered transmission and artificial noise generation to ensure communication secrecy. Semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation is employed to derive a resource allocation algorithm which finds the global optimal solution to the formulated problem. Simulation results demonstrate significant transmit power savings and robustness against CSI imperfection for the proposed resource allocation algorithm for layered transmission compared to baseline schemes with traditional single-layer transmission.

40|$|For {{cooperative}} amplify-and-forward (AF) relaying in spectrum-sharing wireless systems, secondary users share spectrum resources originally {{licensed to}} primary users {{to communicate with}} each other and, thus, the transmit power of secondary transmitters is strictly limited by the <b>tolerable</b> <b>interference</b> powers at primary receivers. Furthermore, the received signals at a relay and at a secondary receiver are inevitably interfered by the signals from primary transmitters. These co-channel interferences (CCIs) from concurrent primary transmission can significantly degrade the performance of secondary transmission. This paper studies the effect of CCIs on outage probability of the secondary link in a spectrum-sharing environment. In particular, in order to compensate the performance loss due to CCIs, the transmit powers of a secondary transmitter and its relaying node are respectively optimized with respect to both the <b>tolerable</b> <b>interference</b> powers at the primary receivers and the CCIs from the primary transmitters. Moreover, when multiple relays are available, the technique of opportunistic relay selection is exploited to further improve system performance with low implementation complexity. By analyzing lower and upper bounds on the outage probability of the secondary system, this study reveals that it is the <b>tolerable</b> <b>interference</b> powers at primary receivers that dominate the system performance, rather than the CCIs from primary transmitters.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, a new beam design {{paradigm}} for coordinated beamforming (CB) for {{current and future}} cellular networks is proposed based on a relaxed zero-forcing (RZF) constraint. In the conventional zero-forcing (ZF) CB, each co-operating transmitter designs its transmit beamforming matrix to null out interference to undesired receivers completely. In the proposed RZF paradigm, however, the ZF constraint is relaxed so that a <b>tolerable</b> amount of <b>interference</b> leakage to undesired receivers is allowed for the beam design at each transmitter.

This paper deals with a novel link resource adaptation (LRA) strategy to be applied in CR scenarios for reliable packet transmissions based on bit interleaved coded orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (BIC-OFDM). We first formulate the power allocation (PA) problem constrained by both the available power at the secondary transmitter (ST) and the <b>interference</b> <b>tolerable</b> at the primary receivers, aimed at maximizing the offered layer 3 data rate, i. e., the goodput (GP) metric. Then, we derive the optimal PA strategy resorting to the customary Lagrangian dual decomposition (LDD) technique, which, however, like many other conventional numerical methods, exhibits several drawbacks, such as slow convergence and need for parameter tuning. These restrictions are circumvented {{through the development of}} a novel iterative yet simple PA algorithm, referred to as successive set reduction (SSR) approach, whose optimality conditions are analytically demonstrated by resorting to the Quasi Variational Inequality (QVI) framework. Based on this PA algorithm, an adaptive modulation and coding (AMC) scheme at the ST is eventually derived. Simulation results over a realistic scenario corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed SSR-based AMC algorithm, highlighting the GP improvements over non-adaptive LRA techniques, besides a remarkable com- plexity reduction w. r. t. conventional numerical methods...|$|R

LTE and LTE-Advanced are examples of such wireless technologies, which support high data rate {{and a large number}} of users. However, higher data rate communication requires more frequency bandwidth. Recent {{studies have shown that the}} inefficient utilization of frequency spectrum is one of the main reasons for the scarcity of frequency bandwidth. Cognitive Radio Network is introduced as a promising solution for this problem. It increases the utilization of bandwidth, by intelligently sensing the channel environment and dynamically providing access to the available resources (frequency bands) for a secondary user. In this thesis, we developed an algorithm for dynamically detecting and anticipating the existence of underutilized resources in LTE system. The algorithm should be a real-time operation, i. e. the decision on availability of a detected resource should be made within a time much less than scheduling update period of LTE. This is the only way that rest of the unused resources becomes usable. For each specific channel assignment, the algorithm requires to start sensing as soon as possible. Therefore, we develop the algorithm in three main steps. The first step is to blindly detect and identify the LTE-Downlink signal using cyclostationarity property of OFDM scheme. The second step is the acquisition of the LTE-Downlink sub-frame timing, which is basically performed by detecting the Primary Synchronization Signal. The third step is to detect unused resources, for the duration of their transmission. This step is using a frequency domain energy detector. By performing the first and second steps, the sub-frame timing and scheduling update instances are known. So basically the algorithm does not require any previous knowledge of the LTE signal.

Optimal power allocation (OPA) that either minimizes the end-to-end outage probability or maximizes the end-to-end instantaneous rate is investigated with constraints on total available power in the secondary network and <b>tolerable</b> <b>interference</b> power at the primary receiver. The OPA vector for the outage minimization problem is obtained by solving an equivalent geometric programming problem (GPP) and that for the rate maximization problem is obtained by applying the rate balancing criterion for each hop. Extensive performance evaluations conducted {{with the help of}} Monte Carlo simulations show that transmit power optimization can improve the end-to-end rate and outage probability performance of multi-hop CogFDR network in comparison to equal power allocation on average (EPA).|$|E
30|$|In this work, we have {{developed}} analytical models for finding the outage probability of the secondary user in an underlay multi-hop cognitive FDR system considering the impact of residual self-interference (RSI) due to full-duplex operation, inter-relay interference (IRI) arising due to frequency re-use, and interference induced by primary transmitter on the secondary nodes. To improve the outage probability and the end-to-end rate performance of the secondary user, optimal selection of powers for the secondary nodes were considered. We formulated an optimization problem {{in order to determine}} the optimal power allocation vector for the secondary nodes that would minimize the outage probability of the secondary network subject to constraints on total power available in the secondary network and also the <b>tolerable</b> <b>interference</b> power at the primary receiver. In order to maximize the end-to-end rate, a power allocation method based on SINR balancing was formulated. Monte Carlo simulations were carried out to substantiate the analytical results. The transmission rate and outage probability of the multi-hop CogFDR network improved significantly when transmit power optimization was employed, in comparison to equal power allocation method.|$|E
