5|$|Glencross {{was born}} December 28, 1982, in Kindersley, Saskatchewan, but {{grew up in}} Provost, Alberta. He {{is the son of}} Mel and Robin Glencross, and has a younger brother, Matthew, and sister, Kari. His parents both played hockey and say he {{inherited}} an intense competitive nature from them. His family moved to Red Deer, Alberta when he was a teenager as his parents began a livestock auction business. Glencross was small for his age, standing less than five feet tall when he was15, and as a result was often left off the top teams in minor hockey despite having <b>the</b> <b>talent</b> <b>to</b> play; he played Midget C hockey in Provost. He experienced a rapid growth spurt, growing a full foot in a period of 17months, and was recruited to play Junior A hockey for the expansion Brooks Bandits of the Alberta Junior Hockey League (AJHL) in 2000. He {{went on to become the}} first Bandit alumnus to play in the National Hockey League (NHL), and his number 17 was retired by the team in 2011.|$|E
5|$|Moore {{wrote to}} Spargo on September 18, stating that his {{commission}} had approved {{the head of}} Allen but was dissatisfied with the lettering. Spargo had mentioned that President Coolidge liked the Bennington Monument, and Moore stated that the Fine Arts Commission was anxious to get right a coin for the president's state of birth; Fry, he wrote, had <b>the</b> <b>talent</b> <b>to</b> design a handsome coin, but had not done so. The next day, Spargo replied, hopeful that they would soon resolve the dispute. He stated that the Sesquicentennial Commission felt that designs other than the monument would not do; for example, {{the use of a}} Green Mountain Boy would both require stretching history and risk charges of imitating the Minuteman seen on the Lexington-Concord Sesquicentennial half dollar, issued earlier in 1925. He was also unwilling to have a two-headed coin, as such a design combined with the depiction of Allen would be. Spargo suggested that Moore put his objections in writing and be as clear as possible to induce Fry to continue with the project, because the sculptor wanted to withdraw from it. Despite conciliatory efforts, Fry refused to continue, and after the failure of brief negotiations with Theodore Spicer-Simson, the Vermont commission engaged Charles Keck.|$|E
25|$|Cowdrey's father, Ernest Arthur Cowdrey, {{played for}} the Surrey County Cricket Club Second XI and Berkshire County Cricket Club in the Minor Counties, but lacked <b>the</b> <b>talent</b> <b>to</b> enter {{first-class}} cricket and his father made him join a bank. Ernest Cowdrey {{had been born in}} Calcutta, moved to India to run a tea plantation and played the 1926–27 MCC touring team for the Madras Europeans XI and top scored with 48. His mother, Molly Cowdrey (née Taylor), played tennis and hockey.|$|E

25|$|After Halas resigned, Gibron {{continued}} {{as an assistant}} under new head coach Jim Dooley in 1968. He switched to coaching the defensive line the following year when assistant coach Joe Fortunato resigned and Jim Ringo was hired to coach the offensive line. Dooley, however, was dismissed in late 1971 after three consecutive losing seasons, including a 1–13 record in 1969. Gibron was elevated to head coach the following January and said the team had <b>the</b> <b>talent</b> <b>to</b> {{make a run at}} the NFL championship.|$|E
25|$|In September 2005, Gallian {{became the}} first player to have twice been {{dismissed}} for 199 in first-class cricket when he was run out against Kent. His previous dismissal for that score had been in April of the same season against Sussex, and on that occasion he was also run out. Early in his career he, along with Graham Thorpe, was heralded as a brilliant prospect for England, but as his record suggests, while Gallian may have had <b>the</b> <b>talent</b> <b>to</b> play Test cricket, he apparently lacked the temperament.|$|E
25|$|Anquetil {{was fascinated}} by the British love of time-trialling and in 1964 {{discussed}} riding a British 25mile (40km) race. Gayfer and the British professional Tom Simpson explained that the course would be on flat roads and asked Anquetil how long the distance would take him. Anquetil, who had <b>the</b> <b>talent</b> <b>to</b> predict his time-trial times accurately, said 46 minutes. That was eight minutes faster than the distance had ever been ridden, the record standing to Bas Breedon at 54:23. It took until 1993 for the record to fall below Anquetil's estimation.|$|E

25|$|Late night revues, {{which would}} become a feature of Fringes, {{began to appear in}} the early 50s. The first one was the New Drama Group's After The Show, a series of {{sketches}} taking place after Donald Pleasence's Ebb Tide, in 1952. Among <b>the</b> <b>talent</b> <b>to</b> appear in early Fringe revues were Ned Sherrin in 1955, and Ken Loach and Dudley Moore with the Oxford Theatre Group in 1958. Due to many reviewers only being able to attend Fringe events late night after the official festival was finished, the Fringe came to be seen as being about revues.|$|E
25|$|Antoine Balland (27 August 1751 – 3 November 1821) {{commanded}} a French infantry division {{during the early}} years of the French Revolutionary Wars. A former private, he was promoted to command an infantry regiment after the Battle of Jemappes. He became a general of brigade in late August 1793 and a general of division less than three weeks later. Soon afterwards, he led a division in Jean-Baptiste Jourdan's victory at Wattignies. In the spring of 1794, he led his troops at Le Cateau, Beaumont and Landrecies. By this time it was obvious that he did not have <b>the</b> <b>talent</b> <b>to</b> command a combat division and he was replaced by Jean Baptiste Kléber. He was not employed after June 1795 and died at Guise in 1821.|$|E
25|$|Patrick {{left the}} group to move to Florida with his new wife. His friend John Gilmore (tenor sax) joined the group, and Marshall Allen (alto sax) soon followed. Patrick {{was in and out}} of the group until the end of his life, but Allen and Gilmore were the two most devoted members of the Arkestra. In fact, Gilmore is often criticized for staying with Sun Ra for over forty years when he {{demonstrated}} <b>the</b> <b>talent</b> <b>to</b> have been a strong leader in his own right. Saxophonist James Spaulding and trombonist Julian Priester also recorded with Sun Ra in Chicago, and both went on to careers of their own. The Chicago tenor Von Freeman also did a short stint with the band of the early 1950s.|$|E

25|$|On November 29, 2008, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, {{the apex}} Igbo {{socio-cultural}} organization announced {{the election of}} Ambassador Ralph Uwechue, an Anioma indigene as its President-General to pilot its affairs {{for the next two}} years. He was nominated by Delta State branch of Ohanaeze as their consensus candidate in a resolution reached at the palace of the Asagba of Asaba after the position was zoned to Anioma, one of the seven units that make up Ohanaeze Ndigbo. But in his acceptance speech, Uwechue expressed gratitude to all and called for unity among Igbo, which is said to possess <b>the</b> <b>talent</b> <b>to</b> and wealth it would take to take to address national issues, while also noting that the position given to him has created confidence that the Igbo from Delta State are accepted as brothers and sisters in Ohanaeze. Finally, he promised not to disappoint Anioma people as the race is for Anioma home and abroad.|$|E
25|$|In April 1976, Spurrier {{was sent}} to the {{expansion}} Tampa Bay Buccaneers in exchange for two players and a second round draft pick as part of the new franchise's first trade. The Buccaneers' new acquisition generated local excitement, as Spurrier had been a college star at the nearby University of Florida. He won the job as team's first starting quarterback, a position that he later regretted as the undermanned Bucs went on to suffer the first winless season (0-14) in modern NFL history. Though he had looked forward to playing professional football in Florida, Spurrier was frustrated by losing, the constant hits playing behind a porous offensive line, and his philosophical differences with Bucs coach John McKay. McKay insisted on employing a run-heavy attack similar to the offense he had used to win championships at The University of Southern California, while Spurrier felt that the team did not have the right personnel to run the ball effectively and should open up the offense. Another point of contention was Coach McKay's insistence that his son, John McKay, Jr., be the Buc's primary wide receiver while Spurrier and other observers felt {{that he did not have}} <b>the</b> <b>talent</b> <b>to</b> fill that role.|$|E
25|$|Hip hop {{music and}} culture {{has a big}} {{influence}} on the Namibian youth, with American rappers, Tupac Shakur and The Notorious B.I.G. being popular. Most of the urban Namibian youth has adopted a hip hop lifestyle, including their dress code. Early Namibian hip hop acts include a group called Dungeon Family, which was composed of the newly recreated group The Kalaharians and the popular girl duo Gal Level. Shikololo, Fidel O'del, Pablo, Dore, Kanibal, Catty Catt, Lalu, OmPuff, Zero Degrees, Walvis Bay based Desert Eagles, Swakop City MC's the Naughty Crew and Krazie-D of Otjiwarongo {{were among the first}} hip hop performers. Popular and most successful hip hop artists include Katutura native Jericho, Snazzy, a female MC who was nominated for Kora Awards in 2005, Rizzy, A-51, a group native to Angola, and Dee Jay, who has lived most of his life between Walvis Bay and Chicago, United States. Windhoek City based Tesh, Saint, Young Gregg, Flavio, King GD, Smartboy, G-Ride, Krespo, Black Vulcanite and Contract Killers are some of the newer rappers. Some artists rap in their indigenous languages including, Oshiwambo, Damara-Nama. Namibia now has <b>the</b> <b>talent</b> <b>to</b> compete with the rest of Africa thanks to a flood of new and exciting artists, such as Lil D, Kid Nana, KingRich, Yungin, KK, and NKN.|$|E

25|$|Overall {{the tour}} to South Africa had {{produced}} mixed results for Di Venuto. his top-score of 89 had shown he had <b>the</b> <b>talent</b> <b>to</b> compete at international level, {{but he had}} also given his wicket away {{on more than one}} occasion, and offered inconsistent scores. The tour had resulted in 150 runs at 30.00 in 5 innings for Di Venuto, the fifth best return of the Australians. It was enough to see him again called up {{for the start of the}} 1997/98 Carlton & United Series against South Africa and New Zealand, where he was again asked to open the batting. In game one against South Africa at the Sydney Cricket Ground, he could only manage a score of 1. In match three against New Zealand at the Adelaide Oval, Di Venuto returned his second best career score of 77, and starring alongside Mark Waugh (104 runs) in an excellent opening stand of 156 for the first wicket. In match four the Australians again met South Africa, this time at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, but Di Venuto failed again with only 6 runs. This inconsistency was starting to weigh against Di Venuto, and the press began to doubt his temperament. When he only returned 7 runs against New Zealand in match six at the MCG, Di Venuto was dropped from the side, and he would not return to the Australian side. In four innings during the series Di Venuto had only managed 91 runs at 22.75.|$|E
500|$|In January 2014, Marquinhos {{was named}} by British {{newspaper}} The Observer {{as one of}} the ten most promising young players in Europe.

500|$|In December 2012, {{following}} {{a series of}} poor performances that eventually led to his benching, a panel of former NFL quarterbacks were questioned about Sanchez's different attributes. It was unanimously agreed upon that his arm strength was [...] "good enough" [...] {{to succeed in the}} league and that he could be effective while mobile in the pocket. His regression was mainly attributed to his poor accuracy, a byproduct of his indecisive mentality once the ball is snapped, and the fact the Jets did little to help surround Sanchez with <b>the</b> <b>talent</b> <b>to</b> overcome his shortcomings. Ron Jaworski commented that Sanchez had lost his confidence which contributed to his decline.|$|E
50|$|Although {{the basic}} story {{in each of}} these parables is {{essentially}} the same, the differences between the parables that appear in the Gospel of Matthew and in the Gospel of Luke are sufficient to indicate that the parables are not derived from the same source. In Matthew, the opening words link the Parable of <b>the</b> <b>Talents</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> preceding Parable of the Ten Virgins, which refers to the Kingdom of Heaven. The version in Luke is also called the Parable of the Pounds.|$|R

He has a criminal past, having recently been released from prison for theft {{prior to the start}} of the series. Thompson explained that Asher becomes a street dancer to help keep himself away from crime, which he commits in order to provide for Sol. He stated that Asher would [...] "try his best to stay out of trouble", but may return to crime through learned behaviour.|$|E
500|$|The fortuitous {{timing of}} the opera's premiere, {{not long after the}} July Revolution, and its sensational and novel effects, meant that it was widely {{identified}} with the new, liberal, ideas of the July Monarchy. As Berlioz commented, Meyerbeer had [...] "not only the luck to be talented, but <b>the</b> <b>talent</b> <b>to</b> be lucky." [...] Honoré de Balzac (in his novella Gambara) and Heinrich Heine (in his poem Angélique) are just two of the contemporary writers to express their fascination with the opera. Alexandre Dumas set a chapter of The Count of Monte Cristo between two acts of Robert; and George Sand wrote about it at length in her Lettres d'un voyageur. It is the only nineteenth-century opera to have a rose named after it.|$|E
500|$|Dennis Wayne Johnson {{was born}} the eighth of sixteen children, to a social worker and a {{bricklayer}} who lived in Compton, California, a suburb of Los Angeles. Originally a baseball fan and a Little Leaguer, Johnson learned basketball from his father, but seemed to have neither the size nor <b>the</b> <b>talent</b> <b>to</b> compete with his peers: as a teenager at Dominguez High School, Johnson measured just 5'9" [...] and played only [...] "a minute or two each game". After high school, he worked several odd jobs, including a $2.75-per-hour job as a forklift driver, and played with his brothers in summer league games after work. During this period, Johnson grew to a height of 6'3", and developed what some later described as [...] "rocket launcher legs", which enabled him to jump high to grab rebounds against taller opponents.|$|E
