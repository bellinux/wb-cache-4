Transient performance analysis is important, since transient behaviour of a <b>traffic</b> <b>process</b> can in fact dominate the aci actual performance.

40|$|Active probing {{began by}} {{measuring}} end-to-end path metrics, such as delay and loss, {{in a direct}} measurement process which did not require inference of internal network parameters. The field has since progressed to measuring network metrics, from link capacities to available bandwidth and cross traffic itself, which reach {{deeper and deeper into}} the network and require increasingly complex inversion methodologies. However, although active probing heuristics are based on queuing systems, {{to the best of our}} knowledge, a rigorous probabilistic treatment of probing methods has been lacking. As a result, important issues of system identifiability have been neglected: it is not known, even in principle, what can and cannot be measured in general, nor the true limitations of existing methods. We provide a blackprobabilistic treatment for the measurement of cross traffic in the 1 -hop case. We first derive inversion formulae for the law of cross <b>traffic</b> and <b>related</b> <b>processes,</b> and explain their fundamental limits, using an intuitive geometric framework. We then use the resulting insight to design practical estimators for cross traffic, which we test in simulation and validate by using router traces. The estimators perform well, but have natural limitations, which are explained in detail...|$|R

40|$|Safety {{is one of}} {{the quality}} aspects of the <b>traffic</b> <b>process.</b> Accidents disturb the <b>traffic</b> <b>process</b> and cause damage and injury to {{vehicles}} and persons. In the aim for an optimum <b>traffic</b> <b>process</b> {{there is a need for}} the quantification and classification of this damage and injury. The quality aspect is mostly described by indicators, giving the relationship between two or more magnitudes by which a certain phenomenon is mentioned. With a series of indicators during a certain time the development of such phenomena becomes perceptible. Indicators which show the highway administrator the quality of safety on the road network can be intended for (1) the determination of attention areas for policy or research (2) as a monitor function (3) the determination of the efficiency of countermeasures and (4) the evaluation of the lack of safety against other effects in traffic. For each case the highway administrator must compose the indicators. In priority planning the highway administrator must determine the nature and magnitude of this effect and show whether in the new situation the traffic safety will be increased or decreased. Therefore the indicators can be used and the order of the effects can be made...|$|R

Changes in membrane shape are regulated by small GTPases, coat proteins and other accessory proteins, such as BAR domain-containing proteins. In addition, membrane deformation entails {{changes in the}} lipid composition as well as asymmetric distribution of lipids over the two leaflets of the membrane bilayer. Given that P 4 -ATPases, which catalyze unidirectional flipping of lipid molecules from the exoplasmic to the cytoplasmic leaflets of the bilayer, are crucial for the trafficking of proteins in the secretory and endocytic pathways, changes in the lipid composition {{are involved in the}} vesicular <b>trafficking</b> <b>process.</b> Membrane remodeling is under complex regulation that involves the composition and distribution of lipids as well as assembly of proteins...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a novel and mathematically {{rigorous}} measure of variability, called {{the index of}} variability (H v ()), that fully and accurately captures the degree of variability of a typical network <b>traffic</b> <b>process</b> at each time scale and is analytically tractable for many popular traffic models. Using this proposed measure, we then analyzed two traffic models: the Two-State Markov Modulated Poisson Process (MMPP) and the renewal process with hyperexponential interarrival time distributions of order two (RPH 2). Two-state MMPP models are popular in modeling the superposition of packet voice streams. The {{results show that the}} traffic variability can exhibit a non-monotonic behavior. In addition, the results suggest that renewal processes with interarrival times hyperexponentially distributed are suitable for modeling network <b>traffic</b> <b>processes</b> with high variability over a broad range of time scales...|$|R

The role of Ruk/CIN 85 as a scaffold protein involved in membrane <b>trafficking</b> <b>processes</b> has been demonstrated in model cell systems. However, intracellular localization of endogenous Ruk/CIN 85 has never been comprehensively assessed. We carried out detailed studies of subcellular distribution of Ruk/CIN 85 in adherent cultured human cells using antibodies that recognize distinct epitopes of the protein and revealed a punctate immunostaining pattern, common for proteins involved in intracellular <b>trafficking</b> <b>processes.</b> Our data indicate that Ruk/CIN 85 is distributed between several different membrane trafficking compartments, but the major pool of Ruk/CIN 85 {{is associated with the}} Golgi complex, mainly with a subpopulation of COPI-coated vesicles involved in retrograde endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi and intra-Golgi transport. This localization pattern is dependent on the integrity of Golgi complex and intact microtubular network. Only a small pool of Ruk/CIN 85 is present in compartments involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis and sorting. These results suggest that endogenous Ruk/CIN 85 may be involved in regulation of specific membrane <b>trafficking</b> <b>processes...</b>|$|R

However, based on traditional queueing analysis, loss performance of a connection has been typically defined in steady state and computed {{under the assumption that}} buffer size is infinite, and no exact result is available for non-Markovian processes.

40|$|Abstract: In {{this paper}} we discuss the {{application}} of some recent results obtained from studying the asymptotics and the entropy of flows in large queueing systems {{to the analysis of}} entropy variations of <b>traffic</b> <b>processes</b> in ATM networks. We argue that certain important queueing nodes/networks (e. g. ·/M/ 1, ·/GI/ ∞ nodes and Jackson networks) are entropy increasing in nature, in that the entropy of the arrival process to such a node/network is strictly less than the entropy of the departure process except when the arrival process is Poisson (which has maximum entropy). The entropy increasing nature of ·/GI/ ∞ queues is established for a class of input processes. Based on these entropy maximization results and with the aid of some simulations, we investigate the connection between the entropy and delay of ATM <b>traffic</b> <b>processes,</b> and examine the effectiveness of entropy as a measure of “burstiness ” of traffic streams in ATM virtual circuits. ...|$|R

In addition, we derive an analytical expression for the effective bandwidth estimation of the multifractal modeled <b>traffic</b> <b>process.</b> We use the proposed effective bandwidth equation to compute the effective envelope for multifractal traffic flows. The development on the multifractal traffic effective envelopment allows us to design an admission control scheme capable of efficiently guaranteeing quality of service in terms of effective envelope violation and delay probabilities for multifractal traffic flows. Through simulations, we compare the admissible number of flows in connections under different types of scheduling algorithms as well as different traffic models, such as the monofractal fBm and the proposed multifractal approach...|$|R
40|$|The {{first part}} of the thesis (Part I) is devoted to find methods to {{describe}} transient behaviour of <b>traffic</b> <b>processes,</b> where the main emphasis is put on the description and analysis of excess periods and excess volumes of quite general stochastic processes. By assuming that traffic changes on different time scales, the transient characteristics such as excess periods could be important measures to describe periods of congestion on a communication link and moreover, the corresponding excess volume will represent lost information during such periods. Although the results obtained are of rather general nature, they provide some rather fundamental insight into transient characteristics of <b>traffic</b> <b>processes.</b> The distributions of the length of excess periods may then be expressed it terms of some excess probabilities that are related to the minimum of the process in the time interval considered. Similar relationsfor the excess volumes are harder to obtain and require the joint probability of the arrived volume and the minimum of the process in the same time interval. </p...|$|R
