Told him nothing would happen this time, if the cups came back safely, but that he'd be watched ever afterwards to see he did not get into mischief. Of course he won't really be watched, you understand, but he thinks he will. Which is better, for it saves trouble. Besides, we know where the cups are--I feel sure he was speaking the truth about them, he was too frightened to invent a story--and here is most of the money. So it all ends well, if I may put it so. My advice, sir, and I think you will find it good advice--is not to prosecute.' ...|$|E

50|$|<b>Then</b> <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> is {{that the}} verb to doubt becomes intensified, which indeed deduces that the {{sentence}} is indeed false since nothing was resolved to a positive. The same applies to the third example, where the adverb more merges with the prefix no- to become a negative word, which when combined with the sentences former negative only acts as an intensifier to the verb hungry. Where {{people think that the}} sentence Im not hungry no more resolves to a positive is where the latter negative no becomes an adjective which only describes its suffix counterpart more which effectively becomes a noun, instead of an adverb. This is a valid argument since adjectives do indeed describe the nature of a noun; yet some fail to take into account that the phrase no more is only an adverb and simply serves as an intensifier. Another argument used to support the position double negatives arent acceptable is a mathematical analogy: negating a negative number results in a positive one; e.g., − −2 = +2; therefore, it is argued, I did not go nowhere resolves to I went somewhere.|$|E

50|$|The verses 59 to 70 {{pertain to}} the disciples doubt {{regarding}} permanence to the soul and the gurus explanation {{as to why the}} soul is eternal. Although the pupil is convinced on the soul’s existence, he notes that the soul emerges {{at the time of the}} birth and gets destroyed at the time of the death. Furthermore, since change occurs continuously and nothing is permanent—this also applies to the soul. Hence it is difficult to believe that soul is eternal and permanent.The guru explains that the body is merely a non-sentient form and hence cannot determine the birth and death of sentience. The knowledge of the birth and death of the body can only be experienced by the soul if it is separate from the body. A lifeless matter cannot turn into or give birth to life or consciousness, nor can sentience turn itself into non-living. This that which cannot be created by matter and has always existed has to be eternal. The guru also infers that the anger etc. of the animals like snakes is derived from the previous birth which also proves the eternity of soul. The guru also poses the question—since substances only change form and are never destroyed <b>then</b> <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> to soul when it gets destroyed? It is the body that undergoes change like old age and death, not the underlying substance, that is, the soul which is not destroyed.|$|E
