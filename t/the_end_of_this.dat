5|$|According to some sources, 26 April marks <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> battle, {{although}} {{less severe}} and isolated clashes {{in that region}} continued until 30 April. Other sources note that heavy fighting still took place on 27 April, and that the German advance was only completely halted by 28 April. By {{the end of the}} month, the Polish Second Army and the Soviet forces had repelled the German attack, forming a line toward Kamenz–Doberschütz–Dauban, and was preparing to launch an offensive toward Prague.|$|E
5|$|After {{the hamlet}} of Wethersfield, NY78 {{continues}} southwest, crossing through rural farms as a two-lane roadway, intersecting with the southern terminus of CR57 (Poplar Tree Road). A short distance after CR57, NY78 intersects {{with the northern}} terminus of NY362 while winding southwest through Wethersfield. At the intersection with Maxwell Drive, NY78 becomes westbound, remaining rural for several miles. After the intersection with Irish Road, NY78 makes a gradual bend to the southwest, then north. At <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> bend, NY78 intersects with the eastern terminus of CR54 (Chaffee Road) and the northern terminus of CR11 (East Arcade Road).|$|E
5|$|As the TUTT {{gradually}} warmed, Gordon {{was able}} to undergo a prolonged period of rapid intensification, despite having restricted outflow. Over a 30-hour period from July14 to 15, the storm's central pressure decreased by 70mbar (hPa; 2.07inHg), just below the threshold for explosive intensification. At <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> phase, Gordon attained its peak strength as a Category5 equivalent super typhoon with winds estimated at 260km/h (160mph). Around the same time, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) assessed the storm to have attained 10-minute sustained winds of 185km/h (115mph) along with a minimum pressure of 915mbar (hPa; 27.02inHg).|$|E

50|$|Allerleirauh {{is one of}} the Grimm {{fairy tales}} {{featured}} in the play The Secret in the Wings by Mary Zimmerman. <b>The</b> <b>ending</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> version is rather ambiguous, as the narrators of the story frequently contradict both one another and the actions of the characters onstage.|$|R
5|$|At <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> period Windsor Castle {{became a}} place of royal confinement. In 1788 the king first became ill during a dinner at Windsor Castle; {{diagnosed}} as suffering from madness, he was removed for a period to the White House at Kew, where he temporarily recovered. After relapses in 1801 and 1804, his condition became enduring from 1810 onwards and he was confined in the State Apartments of Windsor Castle, with building work on the castle ceasing the following year.|$|E
5|$|Being low-lying {{and largely}} {{surrounded}} by water, Norfolk is {{particularly vulnerable to}} rising sea levels. In addition, the land on which it is built is slowly subsiding. Some areas already flood regularly at high tide, and the city commissioned a study in 2012 to investigate how {{to address the issue}} in the future: it reported the cost of dealing with a sea-level rise of one foot would be around $1,000,000,000. Since then, scientists at the Virginia Institute of Marine Science in 2013 have estimated that if current trends hold, the sea in Norfolk will rise by 5 and 1/2 feet or more by <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> century.|$|E
5|$|Between 23 and 27 May {{and again}} 30 May 1951, New Jersey pounded targets near Yangyang and Kansong, {{dispersing}} troop concentrations, dropping a bridge span, and destroying three large ammunition dumps. Air spotters reported Yangyang abandoned at <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> action, while railroad facilities and vehicles were smashed at Kansong. On 24 May, she {{lost one of}} her helicopters after the crew pushed their chopper to the limit of its fuel searching for a downed aviator. The helicopter crew was able to reach friendly territory and were later returned to their ship.|$|E

5|$|By <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> period, the {{constant}} attempts at reorganisation had proved a mixed bag, {{particularly for the}} auxiliary forces. The Militia was heavily understrength and disorganised, whilst the number of recruits for the Volunteers was falling off and the financial situation of the units was becoming worrying. The system of central per-capita grants helped support the units, despite the worrying side-effect of causing an incentive to keep as many men on the books as possible regardless of fitness, but even so it was becoming apparent that many Volunteer Corps were headed towards financial collapse unless some action were taken.|$|E
5|$|Desert {{conditions}} returned briefly, {{creating the}} White Throne member, but encroaching seas again beveled the coastline, forming a regional unconformity. Thin beds of clay and silt mark <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> formation. The most prominent outcrops of this formation {{make up the}} capstone of West Temple in Zion Canyon. Rain dissolves some of the iron oxide and thus streaks Zion's cliffs red (the red streak seen on the Altar of Sacrifice is a famous example). Temple Cap iron oxide is also {{the source of the}} red-orange color of much {{the lower half of the}} Navajo Formation.|$|E
5|$|Earth {{movements}} {{after the}} Carboniferous period {{resulted in the}} up-doming of the area and, particularly in the west, the folding of the rock strata along north–south axes. The region {{was raised in a}} north–south line which resulted in the dome-like shape and the shales and sandstones were worn away until limestone was exposed. At <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> period, the Earth's crust sank here which led to the area being covered by sea, depositing a variety of new rocks.|$|E

5|$|In 1934, Nakayama {{commissioned}} the famed architect Yoshikazu Uchida {{to draw up}} a blueprint for the area. Uchida arranged ten buildings around Oyasama's Residence. A 50-meter boulevard would come out of the Residence on a north-south axis, along which six school buildings would be lined up. Classrooms and large auditoriums would be built at <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> boulevard. The international school and library were to be eventually integrated into this plan. In January 1937, a middle school (now Tenri High School) was built according to Uchida's plan, but as Japan mobilized for the Pacific War the plan had to be temporarily shelved.|$|E
5|$|Only two {{or three}} frets are needed for the guitarchords—major, minor, and {{dominant}} sevenths—which are emphasized in introductions to guitar-playing and to the fundamentals of music. Each major and minor chord can be played on two successive frets on three successive strings, and therefore each needs only two fingers. Other chords—seconds, fourths, sevenths, and ninths—are played on only three successive frets. For fundamental-chord fingerings, major-thirds tuning's simplicity and consistency are not shared by standard tuning, whose seventh-chord fingering is discussed at <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> section.|$|E
5|$|The Scottish {{economy of}} this period was {{dominated}} by agriculture and by short-distance, local trade. There was an increasing amount of foreign trade in the period, as well as exchange gained by means of military plunder. By <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> period, coins were replacing barter goods, but for most {{of this period}} most exchange was done without the use of metal currency.|$|E

50|$|Historically, Metro {{used paper}} tickets from its {{foundation}} until 1987, {{when a new}} magnetic-striped system by Crouzet was introduced. This system allowed for easier transfers across the network and an exact fare expiration time of 90 minutes. Upon <b>the</b> <b>ending</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> system, all ticketing equipment was given to Adelaide Metro, who are the last remaining company using the system.|$|R
5|$|The initial {{symptoms}} {{are followed by}} a stage called clinical latency, asymptomatic HIV, or chronic HIV. Without treatment, this second stage of {{the natural history of}} HIV infection can last from about three years to over 20years (on average, about eight years). While typically there are few or no symptoms at first, near <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> stage many people experience fever, weight loss, gastrointestinal problems and muscle pains. Between 50 and 70% of people also develop persistent generalized lymphadenopathy, characterized by unexplained, non-painful enlargement of more than one group of lymph nodes (other than in the groin) for over three to six months.|$|E
5|$|The {{regiment}} first {{served a}} 90-day term of service from April to July 1861. Near <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> first enlistment, the 5th Massachusetts was heavily {{engaged in the}} First Battle of Bull Run. Their second term of service lasted 9 months from September 1862 to July 1863 during which they were stationed in New Bern, North Carolina, participated in several expeditions and saw minor combat including the Battle of Goldsboro Bridge. Their third enlistment {{in response to the}} emergency call for troops to defend Washington, D.C. lasted 100 days from July to November 1864 during which they were stationed in various fortifications around Baltimore, Maryland, primarily in Fort McHenry.|$|E
5|$|A neutron {{spectrometer}} {{on board the}} Lunar Prospector spacecraft detected enhanced concentrations of hydrogen close to {{the northern and southern}} lunar poles, including the crater Shackleton. At <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> mission in July 1999, the spacecraft was crashed into the nearby crater Shoemaker in the hope of detecting from Earth-based telescopes an impact-generated plume containing water vapor. The impact event did not produce any detectable water vapor, and this may be an indication that the hydrogen is not in the form of hydrated minerals, or that the impact site did not contain any ice. Alternatively, {{it is possible that the}} crash did not excavate deeply enough into the regolith to liberate significant quantities of water vapor.|$|E
