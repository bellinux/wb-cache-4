40|$|In {{the context}} of Value Added Tax (VAT) on consumption, the {{importance}} of VAT deduction is increasing particularly by cross-border trade with goods and services. That is to say, the mechanism of deduction may prevent the foreign trade from VAT caused trade barriers. In this work, the conventional concept of trade barriers is initially clarified as governmental discrimination of economic sales from abroad. For VAT purposes, this concept takes a supplementation. The discrimination in terms of VAT can be proven {{on the basis of}} the so-called destination principle. According to this principle, it is solely admitted taxes to be imposed in that country in which supplied goods or services are consumed. Therefore, this principle is also called country of consumption principle. If goods or service have arrived at the country of destination and are burdened by the country of origin with VAT, this country should provide for deduction or refund of the levied VAT. Thus, the concept of trade barriers is to be supplemented by discrimination of economic sales to foreign countries. Hence, the country of origin has to award the unlimited right to deduct input VAT and the performance of this right in order to prevent trade barriers. Additionally, it is generally not allowed to levy higher taxes on the “imported” sale in the country of destination for the reason that the sale is originated from abroad. Subsequently, it is discovered certain restrictions of the VAT deduction concerning cross-border transactions of goods and services between EU member states and Turkey from the viewpoint of VAT law in the EU. Residents in Turkey as supplier or receiver of taxable sales can claim VAT deduction only in accordance to Directive 86 / 560 /EEC. This Directive concedes essential (political) scope for limitations of VAT deduction (refund), e. g. “of reciprocity” or the appointment of a tax representative, to the member states. Furthermore, the VAT refund is unavoidable excluded by the Directive, if the taxable person from Turkey supplies particular sales of insurances and financial products or incur some expenditures determined by the respective EU member state. Pursuant to Turkish VAT law, it can be stated that there are shortcomings of VAT deduction detrimental to EU residents with regard to the cross-border trade. If EU <b>taxable</b> <b>persons</b> receive goods or services from Turkey, which are subject to VAT, a VAT deduction, on a regular basis, is not permitted. Moreover, <b>taxable</b> <b>persons</b> from EU, who imports goods to Turkey, are basically obliged to pay import VAT. The deduction of this tax requires that the taxable person owes VAT due to other taxable sales in Turkey. The import VAT could be deducted from this VAT debt. But it is rarely the case that there is that kind of VAT debt. Finally, EU <b>taxable</b> <b>persons</b> supplying taxable cross-border sales in Turkey are not eligible to VAT deduction, to the extent that the input VAT on purchases exceeds the VAT debt on the cross-border sales...|$|E

40|$|This master’s thesis {{will examine}} the concept of “fixed establishment” in VAT-law. The concept {{can be found in}} the new EC-directive on the common system of value added tax, however it has existed for thirty years in {{previous}} directives. Despite this, the legislator has never provided a proper definition of the concept. Its meaning has therefore evolved through the case-law of the ECJ. The Court has put forward a number of criteria which are all to be met if a fixed establishment is to be at hand. First of all the stablishment must have the human and technical resources necessary to provide the service. Furthermore the establishment need to be fully dependent on the parent company. This criterion may be fulfilled even though the establishment is a separate legal person. Finally the Court has held that the result of a transaction being taxed in the country where the fixed establishment is located must lead to a rational taxation result. This rational result is to be examined on a case-by-case basis. It seems clear that a scheme where a fixed establishment is being used with the sole purpose of avoiding VAT would not meet this requirement. The concept of fixed establishment is not to be confused with the concept of permanent establishment existing in income taxation. This latter concept is laid down by Article 5 of the OECD Convention. The two concepts share a common heart, however the ECJ has used the concept of fixed establishment to accommodate the needs of Community law in the field of VAT. Furthermore, this master’s thesis will examine what tax planning opportunities fixed establishments may provide. Swedish companies, primarily exempt <b>taxable</b> <b>persons</b> such as banks and insurance companies, may be tempted to establish fixed establishments in states with a low VAT-rate on professional services, i. e. services provided by consultants, engineers, lawyers and accountants etc. Exempt <b>taxable</b> <b>persons</b> are not entitled to deduct input VAT. By having the fixed establishment purchase the service in question abroad at a low rate of VAT and then forward the service to the main office, savings on VAT cost can be made. A VAT-saving scheme, based on reversed charge of VAT, may involve a Swedish company purchasing a service via a fixed establishment in Luxembourg at a VAT-rate of 15 %. When the establishment subsequently forwards the service to the main office in Sweden no taxation will be made since the ECJ has held that transactions within the same legal entity are not taxable. The difference in VAT cost is ten percentage points which is what the Swedish head office saves by having the fixed establishment purchase the service rather than purchasing it directly from the provider. Similarly, a fixed establishment may be organised in Switzerland, outside the Community, where the VAT-rate is even lower. There are obstacles to these kinds of VAT-saving schemes, and these will be more thoroughly examined...|$|E

The understanding and awareness of people and <b>taxable</b> <b>person</b> about GST can be seen from the success of the advertisements and programs held by the Royal Malaysian Custom Departments (RMCD) and other government agencies throughout 2014 onwards. GST is known as a multi-stages tax affected to each stage of products or services circulation. In other words, there will be 6 % tax imposed on all goods and services with some exception on certain items. Therefore, RMCD shall look after GST governance to ensure that taxable entities are continuously complying with all the regulations enforced under GST Act 2014, GST Rules 2014 and GST Order 2014. The efficiency and effectiveness of tax collection are very important for government to support the socioeconomic development of the country. GST governance as a process in guiding an entity with regards to their tax responsibilities will lead the entity to be more concerned about their contributions to the nation building. This study discusses the GST governance from overseas practices such as governance and risk management, processing and reporting, resources and capabilities and assurance that can be adapted into Malaysian context for best practice actions. It will contribute to the GST literature from the Malaysian perspective which might differ from other countries...|$|R
