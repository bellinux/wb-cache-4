5|$|After {{retiring}} from football Young had many different jobs, including removals, managing a sports shop, delivering milk, {{working in a}} supermarket, and selling insurance. In his spare time he maintained his fitness by playing badminton, and after winning local tournaments, played the sport for Cheshire. During much of this period he struggled financially, {{to the point where}} he had to sell the family home and move in with his mother. Deeply depressed at <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> his life, at one point he attempted suicide. From the mid-1990s Young coached school football teams in the area around his Cheshire home.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the weather}} had been mostly rainy up to <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> the campaign, a snow storm arrived the night of February 13, with strong winds that brought {{temperatures}} down to 10–12°F (−12°C) and deposited 3inches (8cm) of snow by morning. Guns and wagons were frozen to the earth. Because of {{the proximity of the}} enemy lines and the active sharpshooters, the soldiers could not light campfires for warmth or cooking, and both sides were miserable that night, many having arrived without blankets or overcoats.|$|E
5|$|An 11-year {{sunspot cycle}} is {{half of a}} 22-year Babcock–Leighton dynamo cycle, which {{corresponds}} to an oscillatory exchange of energy between toroidal and poloidal solar magnetic fields. At solar-cycle maximum, the external poloidal dipolar magnetic field is near its dynamo-cycle minimum strength, but an internal toroidal quadrupolar field, generated through differential rotation within the tachocline, is near its maximum strength. At <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> the dynamo cycle, buoyant upwelling within the convective zone forces emergence of toroidal magnetic field through the photosphere, giving rise to pairs of sunspots, roughly aligned east–west and having footprints with opposite magnetic polarities. The magnetic polarity of sunspot pairs alternates every solar cycle, a phenomenon known as the Hale cycle.|$|E
5|$|Another {{issue is}} that Murray cod caught and {{released}} in winter, while developing their eggs, or in spring prior to spawning, resorb their eggs and do not spawn. This may be a minor issue compared {{to some of the}} other threats facing Murray cod, nevertheless, concerned fishermen try to avoid catching wild Murray cod at these times. At <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> time a closed season is in place for the spring spawning period, during which anglers are not allowed to target Murray cod, even on a catch and release basis.|$|E

At <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> the game, {{the letter from}} Mary is shown {{to have been a}} blank piece of paper the entire time. In another room, a final meeting with Angela sees her giving up on life as she is unable to cope with her trauma and guilt any longer. She walks into a fire and is not seen again.

5|$|At <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> 1998, Kiedis and Flea {{decided it}} was time to fire their guitarist. Navarro was furious when confronted by Kiedis and Flea, but {{eventually}} accepted his termination. The Chili Peppers were fighting, and on the verge of breaking up. Flea was beginning to question the band's future and thought it may be necessary to break the band up. He made one last attempt to keep the band together, asking Frusciante to rejoin. Frusciante had recently completed a drug rehabilitation program after more than five years of heroin addiction, and gladly accepted the invitation.|$|E
5|$|At <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> her career, Sörenstam {{says she}} lost focus having reached her biggest goals.

She {{qualified}} for the World Golf Hall of Fame when she won the 2000 Welch's/Circle K Championship, but was not eligible for induction until finishing her tenth year on the LPGA tour in October 2003.

5|$|At <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> his life, Beebe was {{forming a}} close {{friendship}} with then-president Theodore Roosevelt, which would last until Roosevelt's death in 1919. Beebe admired Roosevelt's skill {{as a field}} naturalist {{as well as his}} advocacy of conservation, and Roosevelt's fame made his support highly valuable in Beebe's scientific endeavors. Roosevelt in turn admired Beebe's writing and his respect for the natural world. Roosevelt frequently provided praise for Beebe's books, and went on to write introductions to Beebe's books Tropical Wild Life and Jungle Peace.|$|E
5|$|By <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> the year, the British Invasion—started by the Beatles' {{previous}} U.S. visit—was gathering momentum, {{and several}} more UK acts {{had come to}} the United States, including The Dave Clark Five, Billy J. Kramer, and Gerry & the Pacemakers. One third of all U.S. top ten hits in 1964 were by British acts. After the tour's final concert in New York, the Beatles were introduced to Bob Dylan, a meeting brought about at the instigation of the New York journalist Al Aronowitz, who arranged for Dylan to visit the Beatles at their hotel before they returned to the UK.|$|E
5|$|Denard Robinson had {{perhaps his}} worst game up to <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> the season: he threw three interceptions and {{was held to}} only 84 yards rushing. This {{marked the first time}} that Michigan State had {{defeated}} Michigan {{three years in a row}} since they accomplished this feat from 1965–1967. The announced crowd of 113,065 was, at the time, the second largest crowd ever at Michigan Stadium. As a testament to Michigan's ongoing kicking woes, the field goal in the first half was Michigan's first attempt since the game against UMass and the first converted kick since the game against Connecticut.|$|E

5|$|Despite having bested the Romans {{in their}} battles, Pyrrhus had {{sustained}} heavy casualties. With his Italian allies wavering, Pyrrhus decided {{to abandon his}} campaign against Rome. At <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> time, Pyrrhus had two options available. Firstly, he could return to Greece where the throne of Macedon had been left vacant {{by the death of}} King Ptolemy Keraunos {{at the hands of the}} Gallic invaders of Greece. Pyrrhus had coveted the Macedonian throne and had briefly held it from 287 BC to 285 BC. Alternatively, he could respond to the appeal of the Greek poleis of Sicily which were requesting his assistance to combat Carthaginian aggression.|$|E
5|$|Hughes {{spent four}} years at West Bromwich Albion as a schoolboy from ages 11 to 15, though was not offered a youth team contract. He instead started his career playing semi-professionally for Football Conference club Kidderminster Harriers, whilst holding down a {{part-time}} job as a roofer. Although Hughes scored 34 goals in the 1996–97 season, Kidderminster failed to gain promotion to the Football League after finishing five points behind champions Macclesfield Town. At <b>this</b> <b>point</b> <b>in</b> his career Hughes was {{regarded as one of}} England's finest semi-professionals and was called up to the England national football C team. In total, Hughes scored 70 goals in 139 games for Kidderminster in all competitions.|$|E
