5|$|At {{some point}} between 1935 and 1938, NY3 was {{truncated}} further <b>to</b> <b>end</b> at its junction with US104 in Hannibal.

NY3 continued <b>to</b> <b>end</b> at the super two until the early 1980s. On April1, 1980, ownership and maintenance of NY3's former routing between the Cayuga County line and NY104 was transferred from Oswego County to the state of New York. One year later, on April1, 1981, the state assumed ownership and maintenance of the Cayuga County portion from that county. Both transactions were part of larger highway maintenance swaps between the state and the two counties. NY3 was reextended westward to NY104A following the second swap.|$|E

5|$|Bevan {{suggested}} a political deception {{with the aim}} of convincing the Swedish government that the Allies intended to invade Norway. During the war Sweden maintained a neutral position, and had relations with both Axis and the Allied nations. It was therefore assumed that if Sweden believed in an imminent threat to Norway this would be passed on to German intelligence. Graffham was envisioned as an extension of existing pressure the Allies were placing on Sweden <b>to</b> <b>end</b> their neutral stance, one example being the requests <b>to</b> <b>end</b> the export of ball bearings (an important component in military hardware) to Germany. By increasing this pressure with additional, false requests, Bevan hoped to further convince the Germans that Sweden was preparing to join the Allied nations.|$|E
