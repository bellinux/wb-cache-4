40|$|The work {{presents}} a mathematical modelling approach to study dynamic competition during the attachment phenomena {{in the initial}} phase of biolm growth. Biofilm development is described by a set nonlinear hyperbolic partial dierential equations. Diffusion of substrates through biolm is modeled {{by a set of}} semilinear parabolic partial differential equations. The two sets of equations are mutually connected. The resulting mathematical problem is a free boundary value problem, which is essentially hyperpolic. A characteristic-like method is introduced to convert differential equations to integral equations. Fixed-point theorem is used to obtain existence, uniqueness and properties of solutions. The model has been applied to the biological competition of heterotrophic-autotrophic bacteria in a multi-specie biolm. The eects of dierent attachment rates on the biolm dynamic performances predicting biolm thickness, volume fractions of bacterial species and substrate concentration trends have been investigated. The simulations show that the dierent attachment rates infuence biolm <b>thickness,</b> <b>of</b> <b>course.</b> However, the volume fractions of bacterial species mainly depend on biolm internal dynamics and substrate concentration trends. The bulk concentrations of microbial species play a relative important role only in the outermost layers of biolm...|$|E
30|$|This {{new model}} may {{provide insight into}} how the diseased state may {{translate}} into large membrane stresses, thereby leading to ectopic electrical activity. Here, I consider a single chamber, spherical heart with a wall of finite <b>thickness.</b> <b>Of</b> <b>course,</b> the human heart is four chambered and not spherical. However, an analytic solution of elastic deformation {{is not likely to}} be found by considering the true geometry of the heart and a spherical model will retain the fundamental characteristics of the heart (e.g. increasing chamber pressure leads to an outward displacement of the muscle). The analytic solution presented here is intended only to approximate the response of the human heart. The displacement fields and hydrostatic pressures are found to be in general agreement with what we expect—namely, increasing active tension causes the heart to contract and increasing chamber pressure causes the heart to expand. The analytic solution allows us to determine the pressure and displacement fields and qualitatively comment on hearts with underlying pathologies. I conclude with a discussion of how these solutions may be applied to four specific pathologies in particular: hypertension, hypovolemic hypotension, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and dilational cardiomyopathy. My discussion of these pathologies is limited by the fact that I do not consider remodeling of the elastic parameters during progression of the diseased state.|$|E
30|$|The {{volume of}} the {{uppermost}} transparent layer was estimated as follows. The margin of the basin is at 3, 818 -m water depth, and {{the area of the}} basin is about 2.0  km 2. Thus, the sediment source area without or with consideration of the over barrier is about 42.5 or 344 times larger than the basin, respectively. The transparent layer is not of constant thickness but thins toward the basin margin (Figure  7), and hence, the estimated {{volume of the}} transparent layer was about 0.0024  km 3. An even layer of surface sediment from the theoretical source area just 28.2 - or 3.5 -mm thick could produce the transparent layer without or with consideration of the over barrier, respectively. Considering a typical porosity of 60 % to 80 %, the source layer would likely be twice that of the <b>thickness.</b> <b>Of</b> <b>course,</b> the sediment source would be heterogeneous rather than a planar layer; nevertheless, {{it can be said that}} the uppermost transparent layer could have been deposited in a short period of time. Remobilization of thin sediment veneer by earthquake shaking was also reported from turbidity sensor monitoring and surface sediment sampling 1  month after the 2011 Tohoku-oki earthquake (Noguchi et al. 2012).The ripple-like bedforms on the slope surrounding the basin are consistent with downslope gravity flows of sediment (Figure  2). Although such bedforms only indicate the paleocurrent directions during or after the fatal stage of the seismic event deposition, they can provide us with information about the paths of sediment supply to the terminal basin. The shapes of the ripple-like bedforms tend to have complex patterns on the flat basin floor, which are presumably due to the superimposition of flows of various directions and timing.|$|E

40|$|Atrial {{fibrillation}} is {{the most}} common type of cardiac arrhythmia. It is characterized by multiple waves of excitation coursing through myocardial tissue. Hence, there is an important medical need for modeling the electrical activity in the atria â e. g. for therapy planning assistance with radio-frequency ablation. The atria have very thin walls, mainly apparent as a thick surface in medical imaging. Our first objective is to derive a 2 D electrophysiology model defined over the midsurface of the geometry, and valid for thin cardiac structures. The major challenge consists in taking into account the anisotropy resulting from the preferred conduction direction along the muscle fibers, which direction rapidly varies across the <b>thickness.</b> <b>Of</b> <b>course,</b> an important motivation also lies in computational effectiveness, which is expected to be far superior than with a 3 D model. The electric wave propagating in the cardiac tissue can be represented by a nonlinear reaction-diffusion partial differential equation, coupled with an ordinary differential equation representing cellular activity. We consider here the bidomain model, see e. g. [6]. We make assumptions on the diffusion tensor in order to model the anisotropic directions. We formulate an asymptotic framework for an anisotropic diffusion model in the spirit of thin structural models â such as shells â in mechanics, see e. g. [1]. We thus identify a limit problem and we show the existence and uniqueness of a solution for this limit problem. We prove a preliminary weak convergence result prior to establishing the strong convergence. This allows us to propose a mathematically justified model defined over the midsurface, and designed for cardiac electrophysiology in thin structures. As a validation of our model, we compare the 3 D and surface-based models, especially when the fibers are rapidly-varying across the thickness, and with non-planar geometries. A pathological case is proposed as further illustration featuring spiral waves, a captivating phenomenon in cardiac electrophysiology, often considered to be responsible for atrial and ventricular fibrillation. The procedure proposed in [2] is employed to obtain the spirals. The FELiScE finite element library developed at Inria is used for all simulations. The differences between the 3 D and surface models are very limited and concentrated along the wave front. Furthermore, we obtain excellent results in terms of computational time (432 min. with 3 D model versus 26 min. with surface model for 1500 ms simulation â i. e. 2 cardiac cycles â with 15, 000 time steps). Then, we present physiological simulations with an anatomical surface mesh representing the mid-surface of the two atria. The conduction tracts between the atria have been defined, and the fibers directions at the endocardium and epicardium are prescribed based on [4]. The values of the conductivity parameters depend on the specific areas considered. The Bachman bundle, the Crista Terminalis, and the pectinate muscles are regions of established fast conduction. By contrast, the Fossa Ovalis and the isthmus of the right atrial floor are regions of known slow conduction. The Courtemanche-Ramirez-Nattel model â which has been specifically derived for human atrial cells â is used to model the reaction term representing the ionic current across the membrane. We compare the simulation results with other modeling studies [3, 5], and excellent adequacy is obtained, with greatly improved effectiveness. References [1] D. Chapelle and K. J. Bathe.

The performance of tack coat materials on AC 10 was evaluated. Three emulsions were selected as tack coat material which are RS- 1 K, RS- 2 K, and RS- 2 KL. These tack coat materials were applied at three application rates, namely 0. 25 l/m², 0. 40 l/m², and 0. 55 l/m². The selected application rates are {{in accordance with the}} JKR specification and represents low, medium and high rates respectively Three different surface thickness were considered namely 35 mm, 50 mm and 65 mm.

Results show modified emulsion can provide better shear strength than conventional emulsion where RS- 2 KL performs better than RS- 1 K and RS- 2 K due to the present of latex in RS- 2 KL which relate to the viscosity that can improve shear strength.

40|$|Thermal {{radiation}} {{is likely to}} play an important role in the calculation of the energy balance in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs), due to their high operating temperatures (600 °– 1000 °C). However, the majority of previous studies dealing with this issue have used room-temperature radiative data for determining the overall heat transfer process within a given cell, which could lead to an inexact appreciation of the role played by the thermal radiation. Consequently, the thermal field within the cell could also be incorrectly determined; however, accurate knowledge of the thermal field is important in order to understand the mechanical behavior of SOFCs. Several parameters, including chemical composition, texture, <b>thickness,</b> and <b>of</b> <b>course</b> operating temperature, have a large effect on the radiative properties of a given compound.

Benefits from reinforcement include a possible reduction in the required <b>thickness</b> <b>of</b> the base <b>course</b> layer and an increase in the design life of the pavement. Currently, mechanisms of reinforcement are not well understood and a quantitative evaluation of geosynthetic reinforcement effects on rutting behavior in flexible pavements is difficult. 21 full-scale laboratory models of flexible pavements systems were constructed and cyclically loaded. Both control (unreinforced) and reinforced sections were constructed and tested.

The major pavement distress modes namely, rutting and fatigue cracking were addressed by these output parameters of DSR. Rutting is caused by permanent deformation of paving mix while fatigue is related to the energy absorbed during repeated load application to pavement.
