40|$|<b>Tribopolymer</b> {{formed on}} the {{contacts}} of microelectromechanical and nanoelectromechanical system (MEMS/NEMS) devices {{is a major}} concern hampering their practical use in information technology. Conductive metal oxides, such as RuO$_ 2 $ and ReO$_ 3 $, have been regarded as promising candidate materials for MEMS/NEMS contacts due to their conductivity, hardness, and relatively chemically inert surfaces. However, recent experimental works demonstrate that trace amounts of polymer could still form on RuO$_ 2 $ surfaces. In this study, we demonstrate the mechanism of this class of unexpected <b>tribopolymer</b> formation by conducting density functional theory based computational compression experiments with benzene as the contamination gas. First, mechanical force during compression changes the benzene molecules from slightly physisorbed to strongly chemisorbed. Further compression causes deformation and chemical linkage of the benzene molecules. Finally, the two contacts detach, with one having a complex organic molecule attached and the other with a more reactive surface. The complex organic molecule, which has an oxabicyclic segment, can be viewed as the rudiment of <b>tribopolymer,</b> and the more reactive surface can trigger the next adsorption [...] reaction [...] <b>tribopolymer</b> formation cycle. Based on these results, we also predict <b>tribopolymer</b> formation rates by using transition [...] state theory and the second [...] order rate law. This study deepens our understanding of <b>tribopolymer</b> formation (especially on metal oxides) and provides strategies for suppressing tribopolymerization...|$|E
40|$|Micro-electro-mechanical {{system and}} nano-electro-mechanical system (MEMS and NEMS) {{transistors}} are considered promising for size-reducing and power-maximizing electronic devices. However, the <b>tribopolymer</b> which forms {{due to the}} mechanical load to the surface contacts affects the conductivity between the contacts dramatically. This {{is one of the}} challenging problems that prevent widespread practical use of these otherwise promising devices. Here, we use density functional theory (DFT) to investigate the mechanisms of <b>tribopolymer</b> formation, including normal mechanical loading, the catalytic effect, as well as the electrochemical effect of the metal contacts. We select benzene select as the background gas, because {{it is one of the}} most common and severe hydrocarbon contaminants. Two adsorption cases are considered: one is benzene on the reactive metal surface, Pt(111), and the other is benzene on the noble metal, Au(111). We demonstrate that the formation of <b>tribopolymer</b> is induced both by the mechanical load and by the catalytic effect of the contact. First, benzene molecules are adsorbed on the Pt surfaces. Then, due to the closure of the Pt contacts, stress is applied to the adsorbates, making the C-H bonds more fragile. As the stress increases further, H atoms are pressed close to the Pt substrate and begin to bond with Pt atoms. Thus Pt acts as a catalyst, accelerating the dehydrogenation process. When there is voltage applied across the contacts, the catalytic effect is enhanced by electrochemistry. Finally, due to the loss of H atoms, C atoms become more reactive and link together or pile up to form <b>tribopolymer.</b> By understanding these mechanisms, we provide guidance on design strategies for suppressing <b>tribopolymer</b> formation.

40|$|Hydrocarbon <b>tribopolymer,</b> {{a type of}} polymer formed due to {{friction}} between surfaces, is a major impediment {{to the development of}} micro- and nanoelectromechanical systems (MEMS/NEMS) devices for industrial application. <b>Tribopolymer</b> buildup can prevent MEMS and NEMS from making or breaking electrical contact. We describe the adsorption of benzene (C 6 H 6) on the RuO 2 (110) surface using density functional theory. This adsorption is an important initial step in the mechanism of hydrocarbon <b>tribopolymer</b> layer formation on MEMS and NEMS devices. The adsorption interaction is studied by considering three oxygen coverages of RuO 2 (110) and all the possible adsorption sites for benzene. We find that adsorption of benzene on O-poor RuO 2 (110) via C-Ru bonds is stronger than adsorption on the O-rich RuO 2 (110) via H-O bonds. For an in-depth study of the adsorption behavior, we include the van der Waals interaction for a holistic investigation. By incorporating the thermodynamic chemical potentials into the adsorption simulations, we describe a model that can provide guidance for realistic situations...|$|E
40|$|During this {{quarterly}} period, {{the author}} has made progress {{in a number of}} areas. He has continued to evaluate potential candidates for high load/high speed antiwear action using the approach of generating <b>tribopolymers</b> capable of withstanding high temperatures. Results are promising for ceramics as well as steel. The construction of a new instrument for high temperature studies of both liquid and vapor phase lubrication is almost complete. This will permit studies up to 350 C bulk temperature and considerably higher surface temperatures in controlled vapor-phase and liquid-phase studies. Selected monomers and monomer combinations found to be effective in hexadecane as a carrier fluid have also been tested in other fluids, including synthetic ester lubricant carriers. Additional studies using FTIRM for surface analysis of wear tracks have been made and are continuing. Further industrial contacts have been made to arrange for field testing of selected compounds as antiwear additives. The applications include the lubrication of 2 -stroke and 4 -stroke engines, machining and cutting, and fuel injector wear, particularly in gas (e. g., natural gas) engines...|$|R
40|$|Nanoelectromechanical (NEM) {{switches}} {{were identified}} by the semiconductor industry as a low-power 2 ̆ 2 beyond CMOS 2 ̆ 2 technology. However, {{the reliability of the}} contact interface currently limits the commercialization of NEM switches, as the electrical contact {{has to be able to}} physically open and close up to a quadrillion (10 ^ 15) times without failing due to adhesion (by sticking shut) or contamination (reducing switch conductivity). These failure mechanisms are not well understood, and materials that exhibit the needed performance have not been demonstrated. Thus, commercially viable NEM switches demand the development of novel contact materials along with efficient methods to evaluate the performance of these materials. To assess contact material candidates under NEM switch-like conditions, we developed a novel, high-throughput electrical contact screening method based on atomic force microscopy (AFM) that enables billions of contact cycles in laboratory timeframes. We compared the performance of self-mated and dissimilar single asperity Pt and PtxSi contacts under forces and environments representative of NEM switch operation and cycled up to 10 million times. The contact resistance increased by up to three decades due to cycling-induced growth of insulating <b>tribopolymer</b> in the case of Pt-Pt contacts whereas PtxSi exhibited reduced <b>tribopolymer</b> formation. We also pursued the development of novel contact material candidates that are highly conductive, minimally adhesive, chemically inert, mechanically robust, and amenable to CMOS fabrication processes. One promising candidate material is platinum silicide (PtxSi). The controlled diffusion of thin films of amorphous silicon and platinum allowed us to tune the chemical composition of PtxSi over a wide range (...|$|E
40|$|The {{problem of}} {{increasing}} the power efficiency of internal combustion engines by the method of its tribochemical treatment was considered. Concentrate additives Komol {{on the base of}} molybdenum complexes was developed. This concentrate reduces fuel consumption and increases engine power. In this paper the Subaru EJ- 25 engine used in aviation and automotive industry was investigated before and after the tribochemical treatment by the bench tests. It’s shown that adding tribochemically active additives into motor oil increases maximal engine power to 10, 7 % which is 8, 7 % on comparable engine rotation speeds. The effect was caused by reduced frictional losses {{as a result of the}} <b>tribopolymer</b> films formed on friction surfaces...|$|E
