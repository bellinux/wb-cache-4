Stalking is {{a common}} form of psychological intimidation, and is most often perpetrated by former or current intimate partners. Victims <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> their partner has nearly total control over them, greatly affecting the power dynamic in a relationship, empowering the perpetrator, and disempowering the victim. Victims often suffer from depression, putting them at increased risk of eating disorders, suicide, and drug and alcohol abuse.|$|E

25|$|Alcohol myopia {{has also}} been found to affect one’s level of {{commitment}} to a personal goal. Individual commitment to a goal is dependent upon level of personal desire and feasibility of the goal. A person’s ability to appropriately interpret feasibility is inhibited by alcohol myopia. This is because desire is a more salient stimulus than feasibility, causing those experiencing alcohol myopia to ignore the less salient stimulant of feasibility. Because one is less inhibited {{by the prospect of}} unfeasible goals, those under the influences of alcohol myopia <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> more committed to their goals than sober individuals. Studies testing the relationship between intoxication and level of commitment to goals support the theory that increased goal commitment (despite level of feasibility) is a side effect of alcohol myopia.|$|E

2500|$|People {{with this}} {{attachment}} style {{have mixed feelings}} about close relationships. On [...] one hand, they desire to have emotionally close relationships. On the other hand, they <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> uncomfortable with emotional closeness. These mixed feelings are combined with sometimes unconscious, negative views about themselves and their attachments. They commonly view themselves as unworthy of responsiveness from their attachments, and they don't trust the intentions of their attachments. Similar to the dismissive–avoidant attachment style, people with a fearful–avoidant attachment style seek less intimacy from attachments and frequently suppress and deny their feelings. Because of this, they are much less comfortable expressing affection.|$|E
2500|$|In November 1906 Bunin's passionate {{affair with}} Vera Muromtseva began. The girl's family was unimpressed with Bunin's {{position}} as a writer, but the couple defied social convention, moving in together and in April 1907 leaving Russia for an extended tour through Egypt and Palestine. The Bird's Shadow (Тень птицы) (1907–1911) collection (published as a separate book in 1931 in Paris) came {{as a result of}} this voyage. These travelling sketches were to change the critics' assessment of Bunin's work. Before them Bunin was mostly regarded as (using his own words) [...] "a melancholy lyricist, singing hymns to noblemen's estates and idylls of the past." [...] In the late 1900s critics started to pay more notice to the colourfulness and dynamics of his poetry and prose. [...] "In terms of artistic precision he has no equal among Russian poets," [...] Vestnik Evropy wrote at the time. Bunin attributed much importance to his travels, counting himself among that special [...] "type of people who <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> strongest for alien times and cultures rather than those of their own" [...] and admitting to being drawn to [...] "all the necropolises of the world." [...] Besides, foreign voyages had, admittedly, an eye-opening effect on the writer, helping him to see Russian reality more objectively. In the early 1910s Bunin produced several famous novellas which came as a direct result of this change in perspective.|$|E

2500|$|Rotter (1975) {{cautioned that}} internality and {{externality}} represent two {{ends of a}} continuum, not an either/or typology. Internals tend to attribute outcomes of events to their own control. People who have {{internal locus of control}} believe that the outcomes of their actions are results of their own abilities. Internals believe that their hard work would lead them to obtain positive outcomes. They also believe that every action has its consequence, which makes them accept the fact that things happen and it depends on them if they want to have control over it or not. Externals attribute outcomes of events to external circumstances. People with an external locus of control tend to believe that the things which happen in their lives are out of their control, and even that their own actions are a result of external factors, such as fate, luck, the influence of powerful others (such as doctors, the police, or government officials) and/or a belief that the world is too complex for one to predict or successfully control its outcomes. Such people tend to blame others rather than themselves for their lives' outcomes. It should not be thought, however, that internality is linked exclusively with attribution to effort and externality with attribution to luck (as Weiner's work – see below – [...] makes clear). This has obvious implications for differences between internals and externals in terms of their achievement motivation, suggesting that internal locus is linked with higher levels of need for achievement. Due to their locating control outside themselves, externals <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> they have less control over their fate. People with an external locus of control tend to be more stressed and prone to clinical depression.|$|E
6000|$|Numerous strikes {{have been}} {{conducted}} or encouraged by the I. W. W. and the Western Federation of Miners. These strikes illustrate the class-war in a more bitter and extreme form than {{is to be found}} in any other part of the world. Both sides are always ready to resort to violence. The employers have armies of their own and are able to call upon the Militia and even, in a crisis, upon the United States Army. What French Syndicalists say about the State as a capitalist institution is peculiarly true in America. In consequence of the scandals thus arising, the Federal Government appointed a Commission on Industrial Relations, whose Report, issued in 1915, reveals a state of affairs such as it would be difficult to imagine in Great Britain. The report states that ``the greatest disorders and most of the outbreaks of violence in connection with industrial `disputes arise from the violation of what are considered to be fundamental rights, and from the perversion or subversion of governmental institutions'' (p. 146). It mentions, among such perversions, the subservience of the judiciary to the mili- tary authorities,[33] the fact that during a labor dispute the life and liberty of every man within the State would seem to be at the mercy of the Governor (p. 72), and the use of State troops in policing strikes (p. 298). At Ludlow (Colorado) in 1914 (April 20) a battle of the militia and the miners took place, in which, as the result of the fire of the militia, a number of women and children were burned to death.[34] Many other instances of pitched battles could be given, but enough has been said to show the peculiar character of labor disputes in the United States. It may, I fear, be presumed that this character will remain so long as a very large proportion of labor consists of recent immigrants. When these difficulties pass away, as they must sooner or later, labor will more and more find its place in the community, and will <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> and inspire less of the bitter hostility which renders the more extreme forms of class war possible.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that defensive pessimists use problem-focused coping in stressful situations. The process of coping with stress by defensive pessimists appears to be affected by the desire for control. Therefore, the effect of the desire for control on defensive pessimism, coping and stress response in controllable and uncontrollable situations was investigated. Japanese undergraduate and graduate students (n = 325) participated in the study. Participants reported past stressful events. And they were classified into eight subgroups: those with, or without the perceived controllability of the events, which cognitive strategy to use, and the degree of desire for control. Results of analysis of variance (ANOVA) indicated that high desire for control group <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> use problem-focused coping in controllable situation. In uncontrollable situations, defensive pessimists <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> stress responses, and especially in low desire for control group, defensive pessimists felt more anxiety than strategic optimists. Additionally, high desire for control group <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> anger in uncontrollable situations. These results imply that desire for control effects coping adaptively, and defensive pessimists with low desire for control might not use emotion-focused coping so they feel more anxiety in uncontrollable situations. Although defensive pessimists supposed to have vulnerability <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> stress response easily, they might maintain their health by keeping moderate level of desire for control.

40|$|Workplace {{bullying}} can {{be defined}} as repeated and persistent negative acts that involve a power imbalance and create a hostile work environment. Partly because of the many negative consequences associated with the phenomenon, bullying has recently become the focus of many studies by contemporary organisational researchers. Drawing on a survey, this thesis provides information on the prevalence and forms of bullying among business professionals, a group of employees neglected in previous bullying research. The thesis follows a tradition among Nordic researchers that emphasises the role of the psychosocial work environment in bullying. In particular, it illustrates how high internal competition and a high degree of organisational politics in business life may lead employees to use bullying as a tactic to gain benefits over their colleagues. Furthermore, it explores the significance of gender in bullying in male-dominated work environments, with women <b>tending</b> <b>to</b> be subjected to more negative acts, <b>tending</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> less capable <b>to</b> defend themselves in these situations, and <b>tending</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> less reluctant <b>to</b> classify these experiences as bullying. In addition to the introductory essay, this thesis consists of a book chapter and four articles. These five papers address particular aspects of workplace bullying: the prevalence and forms of bullying, the significance of gender in bullying, and organisational antecedents of bullying...|$|R
