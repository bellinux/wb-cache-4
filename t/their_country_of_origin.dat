5|$|A {{small number}} of Australian volunteers fought {{on both sides of}} the Spanish Civil War, {{although}} they predominantly supported the Spanish Republic through the International Brigades. The Australians were subsequently allocated to the battalions of other nationalities, such as the British Battalion and the Lincoln Battalion, rather than forming their own units. Most were radicals motivated by ideological reasons, while a number were Spanish-born migrants who returned to fight in <b>their</b> <b>country</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin.</b> At least 66 Australians volunteered, with only one—Nugent Bull, a conservative catholic who was later killed serving in the RAF during the Second World War—known to have fought for General Francisco Franco's Nationalist forces.|$|E
5|$|Houphouët-Boigny {{adopted a}} system of {{economic}} liberalism in Côte d'Ivoire {{in order to obtain}} the trust and confidence of foreign investors, most notably the French. The advantages granted by the investment laws he established in 1959 allowed foreign business to repatriate up to 90% of their profits in <b>their</b> <b>country</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> (the remaining 10% was reinvested in Côte d'Ivoire). He also developed an agenda for modernising the country's infrastructure, for example, building an American-style business district in Abidjan where five-star hotels and resorts welcomed tourists and businessmen. Côte d'Ivoire experienced economic growth of 11–12% from 1960 to 1965. The country's gross domestic product (GDP) grew twelvefold between 1960 and 1978, from 145 to 1,750billion CFA francs, while the trade balance continued to record a surplus.|$|E

50|$|Due {{to a lack}} of {{economic}} opportunity in the Global South, many women with families leave <b>their</b> <b>countries</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> and <b>their</b> own families to pursue work in the Global North.

Domestic workers often migrate to financially support their immediate family, extended family, and even other members of their community.

40|$|Jagdish Bhagwati's {{proposal}} for a ‘brains tax’ to be levied on the incomes of the diaspora from developing countries residing {{in the developed countries}} and the proceeds to be remitted to the <b>countries</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> the diaspora is well known. In recent years the voluntary contributions or remittances from the diaspora to <b>their</b> <b>countries</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> have often been higher than the aid monies given to these countries. It is now increasingly recognised that the diaspora may have an active role to play in the development process <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>countries</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin.</b> They are not only a source of funds; they are also a rich source of skills and know-how. This paper analyses the potential of the diaspora as agents <b>of</b> change in <b>their</b> <b>countries</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> and argues that the social rate of return to a unit of diaspora investments may be higher than that for a unit of foreign direct investment from non-diaspora sources...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{argues that}} the {{correlation}} of business cycles across countries {{is largely due to}} linkages between multinational firms and their foreign affiliates.
