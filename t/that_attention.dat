5|$|Heavy {{opposition}} from the two SS panzer divisions in the area {{proved to be a}} critical factor not only in preventing the British 1st Airborne Division from holding the Rhine Bridge at Arnhem, but also imposed serious delays on the capture of the bridges at Nijmegen by the U.S. 82nd Airborne Division and the advance of the armoured units of the British XXX Corps.

5|$|Sesame Street {{has been}} used to test the {{attention}} span of infants and toddlers. In 2004, children from three months to two years were shown Sesame Street clips and a group of computer-generated black and white patterns. Their attention spans, as determined by the duration of time they looked at the stimuli, significantly increased at six to twenty-four months, but only for the Sesame Street material. A study conducted in 2006 found that infants' attention span increased more when they were presented with video clips than with still images of the same stimuli, supporting the idea that movement helps young infants gain more information from the world around them. The evidence showed <b>that</b> <b>attention</b> span depended both on age and the on the type of stimuli children viewed. The time they looked at stimuli decreased for all types of stimuli from fourteen to twenty-six weeks, but the time they looked at it increased depending on the stimuli. When older infants (age fourteen weeks to twelve months) looked at Sesame Street materials and human faces, their attention increased compared to other types of stimuli.|$|E
25|$|Those {{models that}} {{emphasize}} on lexical processes {{can be further}} {{divided into two groups}} based on how attention is allocated in the reading model. The mainstream model E-Z Reader (Reichle, Rayner, & Pollatsek, 2003), along with older ones like Reader (Just & Carpenter, 1980) and EMMA (Salvucci, 2001) assumes <b>that</b> <b>attention</b> is allocated to only one word sequentially. On the contrary, the SWIFT model assumes <b>that</b> <b>attention</b> in reading is distributed among the currently fixated word and its neighbours. Since attention allocation determines the input stream in these models, difference in attention allocation results in fundamental difference in the subsequent processing and simulation output. E-Z Reader incorporates various lexical properties into a complex structure of interaction between lexical processing, saccade programming and attention shifting; it reproduces the widest range of phenomena in reading behaviours and can be generalised to reading behaviours in elder people, in different languages and in different types of text presentation (Reichle, 2011). In contrast, SWIFT resorts to a dynamic field of parallel activation that stochastically triggers saccade programming, yielding parsimonious simulations of refixation, regression (fixate back to a previous word), and neighbouring effects (how neighbouring words affect the current fixation) (Engbert & Kliegl, 2011). The debate is still on whether attention in reading should be relaxed to more than one word.|$|E

25|$|A {{potential}} open-wheeled Aston Martin {{racing car}} had been discussed as early as 1955, and a hastily constructed prototype was tested in the Australian and New Zealand races in early 1956, driven by Reg Parnell. Following successes in this Antipodean experiment, and despite the majority of Aston's racing department being fully occupied with the sports car program, Aston Martin decided to pursue a Formula One entry in earnest. However, the company's emphasis on sports car competitions meant <b>that</b> <b>attention</b> was often diverted from the Formula One program, and development delays were common almost from the outset.|$|E
25|$|Human's {{attention}} on words is impacted by emotion grasping vocabulary. Negative and positive words are better recalled than neutral {{words that are}} spoken. Many different ways <b>that</b> <b>attention</b> is focused on hearing what the speaker has to say is the inflection of the presenter's voice in a sad, content, frustrated sound or {{in the use of}} words that are close to the hear. A study was conducted to observe if the use of emotional vocabulary was a key receptor of recall memory. The groups were put into the same lecture halls and given the same speakers, but the results came back to determine that the inflection and word choice recalled by the listeners concluded that emotional words, phrases, and sounds are more memorable than neutral speakers.|$|E
25|$|As we age, deficits {{are seen}} {{in the ability to}} integrate, manipulate, and reorganize the {{contents}} of working memory in order to complete higher level cognitive tasks such as problem solving, decision making, goal setting, and planning. More research must be completed in order to determine what the exact cause of these age-related deficits in working memory are. It is likely <b>that</b> <b>attention,</b> processing speed, capacity reduction, and inhibitory control may all play a role in these age-related deficits. The brain regions that are active during working memory tasks are also being evaluated, and research has shown that different parts of the brain are activated during working memory in younger adults as compared to older adults. This suggests that younger and older adults are performing these tasks differently.|$|E

25|$|First, {{rather than}} {{succumbing to the}} {{foreseeable}} consequences of his criminality, de Hory became something of a folk hero in the anti-establishment atmosphere that pervaded the late 1960s, an age of rebellion and social unrest. Secondly, his ensuing notoriety, he thought, would finally afford him the lifelong recognition he sought, {{to be seen as}} a fine artist in his own right. He was wrong. De Hory often referred to himself as “famously infamous,” and he enjoyed his time in the spotlight as a bad-boy media darling, though, <b>that</b> <b>attention</b> never translated into a demand for artwork in his own avant-garde style. It was a bitter but real irony for him for the rest of his life. Lastly, but perhaps most importantly, rather than learning from the mistakes made by art dealers, and collectors, de Hory’s target audience, the commerce of art remains little changed from the halcyon days of his midcentury fakery. The degree of complicity de Hory enjoyed with art dealers is open to speculation, though, even today, art sellers face no fallout from unlawful dealings unless it can be proven that they are ‘knowingly’ complicit in fraudulent transactions (see Knoedler Gallery scandal). Plausible deniability is a commonly used defense to deflect accountability. Furthermore, auction houses distance themselves in issues of provenance or authorship as they are not in the business of ascribing authenticity. (See the standard wordage explaining terms and conditions of sale for Christie’s or Sotheby’s, for example.) These loopholes that allowed many of de Hory’s fakes to fast track to public institutions and private collections are the same pathways that facilitate present-day forgers and fakers.|$|E

Eventually, they created grayscale heightmaps, extruding them to create changes in elevation. From this basic terrain, textures were painted onto a colormap which was wrapped over the landscapes.

Rand noted <b>that</b> <b>attention</b> to detail allowed Myst to deal with the limitations of CD-ROM drives and graphics, stating [...] "A lot can be done with texture…Like finding an interesting texture you can map into the tapestry on the wall, spending a little extra time to actually put the bumps on the tapestry, putting screws in things.

They also looked for ideas for a dream sequence, in Disney films such as Dumbo and the Pluto cartoon Pluto's Judgment Day, and for crowd scenes in It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World. Silverman looked at some of the Simpsons episodes he had directed, primarily his two favorites, [...] "Homie the Clown" [...] and [...] "Three Men and a Comic Book". Mike B. Anderson, Lauren MacMullan, Rich Moore, and Steven Dean Moore each directed the animation for around a quarter of the film under Silverman's supervision, with numerous other animators working on scenes.|$|E

In 1961, when To Kill a Mockingbird was in its 41st week on the bestseller list, it was awarded the Pulitzer Prize, stunning Lee. It also won the Brotherhood Award of the National Conference of Christians and Jews in the same year, and the Paperback of the Year award from Bestsellers magazine in 1962. Starting in 1964, Lee began to turn down interviews, complaining that the questions were monotonous, and grew concerned <b>that</b> <b>attention</b> she received bordered {{on the kind of}} publicity celebrities sought. Since then, she declined talking with reporters about the book. She also steadfastly refused to provide an introduction, writing in 1995: [...] "Introductions inhibit pleasure, they kill the joy of anticipation, they frustrate curiosity. The only good thing about Introductions is that in some cases they delay the dose to come. Mockingbird still says what it has to say; it has managed to survive the years without preamble." ...|$|E

500|$|Disney became {{concerned}} {{that such a}} comical approach would lessen the plausibility of the characters and, sensing that more time was needed {{for the development of}} the Queen, advised in an outline circulated on November 6 <b>that</b> <b>attention</b> be paid exclusively to [...] "scenes in which only Snow White, the Dwarfs, and their bird and animal friends appear". The names and personalities of the dwarfs, however, were still [...] "open to change". A meeting of November 16 resulted in another outline entitled 'Dwarfs Discover Snowwhite', which introduced the character of Dopey, who would ultimately prove to be the most successful and popular of the dwarf characterisations. For the rest of 1934 Disney further developed the story by himself, finding a dilemma in the characterization of the Queen, who he felt could no longer be [...] "fat" [...] and [...] "batty", but a [...] "stately beautiful type", a possibility already brought up in previous story meetings. Disney did not focus on the project again until the autumn of 1935. It is thought that he may have doubted his, and his studio's ability, and that his trip to Europe that summer restored his confidence. At this point, Disney and his writers focused on the scenes in which Snow White and the dwarfs are introduced to the audience and each other. He laid out the likely assignments for everyone working on the film in a memorandum of November 25, 1935, and had decided on the personalities of the individual dwarfs.|$|E

2500|$|Transsaccadic {{memory is}} {{characterized}} by the integration of information gathered prior to the execution of a saccade (pre-saccadic) and information gathered after the saccade (post-saccadic stimuli. This involves attention, [...] locating the targets necessary to perform a saccade and continuous updates of the environmental information. Attention occurs prior to the movement of the eyes, therefore it has a strong influence on the location of the saccade, what information is being encoded, remembered across saccades and stored into transsaccadic memory. In order to perform a successful and accurate saccade an individual is required to make an attentional shift to the saccadic target. This attentional shift causes the encoding of information to occur near the saccade target location. Attention to the target of the saccade results in better object identification and an increase in accuracy of identification. As well as, improvement in coding of locational information. Attention is restricted to one saccade target per area. It is impossible to keep attention on a target in one area, while performing another saccade simultaneously in another. This will cause prolonged saccadic latency periods (the time it takes to make a saccade from one area to another), and increased reaction times. However, attention can be distributed around the saccade target, rather than the precise location that will fall on the fovea, allowing for the detection of one or two objects situated around the saccadic target. Kowler (1995) proposed two models to explain the relationship between attention, saccades and transsaccadic memory. The spatial model, states <b>that</b> <b>attention</b> is distributed among the perceptual site (visual field) and the saccadic target during the latency period, which allows for the identification of the saccadic target and object surrounding that area. The temporal model states <b>that</b> <b>attention</b> determines [...] where the saccade will occur and releases a “go” signal to initiate a saccade within that area.|$|E
