5|$|<b>Tunneling</b> {{diffusion}} is {{a physical}} manifestation of the quantum <b>tunneling</b> effect involving particles <b>tunneling</b> across diffusion barriers. It can occur {{in the case of}} low diffusing particle mass and low Ediff, and has been observed in the case of hydrogen diffusion on tungsten and copper surfaces. The phenomenon is unique in that in the regime where the <b>tunneling</b> mechanism dominates, the diffusion rate is nearly temperature-independent.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, Dwayne Heard at the University of Leeds {{suggested}} that quantum mechanical <b>tunneling</b> could explain a reaction his group observed taking place, at {{a significantly higher}} than expected rate, between cold (around 63 kelvins) hydroxyl and methanol molecules, apparently bypassing intramolecular energy barriers which {{would have to be}} overcome by thermal energy or ionization events for the same rate to exist at warmer temperatures. The proposed <b>tunneling</b> mechanism may help explain the common observation of fairly complex molecules (up to tens of atoms) in interstellar space.|$|E
5|$|Insects {{recovered}} from inflorescences include the banksia boring moth (Arotrophora canthelias), younger instars of which eat flower and bract parts before <b>tunneling</b> into the rachis {{as they get}} older and boring into follicles and eating seeds. This <b>tunneling</b> itself damages the architecture of the spike and prevents seed development. Other seed predators include unidentified species of moth of the genus Cryptophasa, as well as Scieropepla rimata, Chalarotona intabescens and Chalarotona melipnoa, Brachmia trinervis, Carposina hyperlopha and an unidentified weevil species.|$|E
5|$|The {{second phase}} was revived under the Siddaramaiah administration. It {{proposed}} <b>tunneling</b> NH 766 beneath the runway, which requires less land than deviating the highway; but the Central Government rejected this proposal, citing security concerns. In August 2016, however, the Deccan Chronicle {{reported that the}} Ministry of Civil Aviation had directed airport officials to have a study conducted regarding <b>tunneling</b> of the highway.|$|E
5|$|Construction of {{the tunnel}} began on October 12, 1914, using a <b>tunneling</b> shield in {{conjunction}} with compressed air. The tunnel was designed by civil engineer Clifford Milburn Holland, who later served as the first chief engineer of the Holland Tunnel. The north tube was holed through on November 28, 1916.|$|E

5|$|On December 21, 2009, the MTA {{said that}} a tunnel-boring machine broke through the 34th Street station cavern wall. Both tunnel-boring {{machines}} were scheduled to finish the required <b>tunneling</b> {{in the spring of}} 2010.|$|E
5|$|Surface {{diffusion}} is {{a general}} process involving the motion of adatoms, molecules, and atomic clusters (adparticles) at solid material surfaces. The process can generally be thought of in terms of particles jumping between adjacent adsorption sites on a surface, as in figure 1. Just as in bulk diffusion, this motion is typically a thermally promoted process with rates increasing with increasing temperature. Many systems display diffusion behavior that deviates from the conventional model of nearest-neighbor jumps. <b>Tunneling</b> diffusion is a particularly interesting example of an unconventional mechanism wherein hydrogen {{has been shown to}} diffuse on clean metal surfaces via the quantum <b>tunneling</b> effect.|$|E
5|$|The {{scanning}} <b>tunneling</b> microscope is {{a device}} for viewing surfaces at the atomic level. It uses the quantum <b>tunneling</b> phenomenon, which allows particles {{to pass through}} a barrier that would normally be insurmountable. Electrons tunnel through the vacuum between two planar metal electrodes, on {{each of which is}} an adsorbed atom, providing a tunneling-current density that can be measured. Scanning one atom (taken as the tip) as it moves past the other (the sample) permits plotting of tip displacement versus lateral separation for a constant current. The calculation shows the extent to which scanning-tunneling-microscope images of an individual atom are visible. It confirms that for low bias, the microscope images the space-averaged dimensions of the electron orbitals across closely packed energy levels—the Fermi level local density of states.|$|E
5|$|The vkernel runs {{on top of}} {{hardware}} abstractions provided by the real kernel. These include the kqueue-based timer, the console (mapped to the virtual terminal where vkernel is executed), the disk image and virtual kernel Ethernet device (VKE), <b>tunneling</b> all packets to the host's tap interface.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, Juniper {{introduced}} {{new line}} cards for the MX series {{and a new}} switch fabric module, intended to upgrade the MX series' for higher bandwidth needs and for software defined networking applications. The capacity of the MX240, 480 and 960 were increased by double or more. A new Multiservice Modular Interface Card (MS-MIC) was incorporated that supports up to 9 Gbit/s for services like <b>tunneling</b> software.|$|E
5|$|In November 1989, IBM {{scientists}} {{demonstrated a}} technology capable of manipulating individual atoms. The program, called IBM in atoms, used a scanning <b>tunneling</b> microscope to arrange 35 individual xenon atoms on a substrate of chilled crystal of nickel {{to spell out}} the three letter company initialism. It {{was the first time}} atoms had been precisely positioned on a flat surface.|$|E

5|$|Proposed {{methods for}} {{controlling}} gopher populations in agricultural areas include poisoning dandelions, clover, carrots, {{sweet potatoes and}} parsnips. Camas pocket gophers are larger than other gophers, so conventional gopher traps may fail to capture them. Toxic baits and fumigants may also fail, since the gophers will sometimes wall off {{a segment of the}} burrow. Gophers may also cause local flooding if their <b>tunneling</b> activities damage levees.|$|E
5|$|The 10th ruler is nicknamed Moon Jaguar by Mayanists. He was {{a son of}} B'alam Nehn, the 7thruler. He was enthroned in May553. His {{surviving}} monuments {{were found}} in the modern village of Copán Ruinas, which was a major complex during the Classic period. The most famous construction dating to his reign is the elaborate Rosalila phase of Temple16, discovered entombed intact under later phases of the temple during archaeological <b>tunneling</b> work.|$|E
5|$|The North Link {{project was}} {{approved}} by the Sound Transit Board in June 2012, setting a $2.1 billion budget and expected completion date of 2021. The contract for <b>tunneling</b> and station construction was awarded to JCM Northlink LLC (a joint venture of Jay Dee, Coluccio, and Michels) for $462 million in 2013. The majority of design work for Roosevelt station was completed in 2014 and 2015.|$|E
5|$|The {{investments}} had drained Holmenkolbanen, {{particularly after}} it had received a massive lawsuit for damage to adjacent properties during the <b>tunneling.</b> After the issue had been resolved by the Supreme Court in 1931, the company needed more capital to start operations. Aker Municipality offered to transfer its ownership of the Smestad Line and the Sognsvann Line to Holmenkolbanen, {{in exchange for the}} majority of shares in the company.|$|E
25|$|A QCA clock induces {{four stages}} in the <b>tunneling</b> {{barriers}} of the cells above it. In the first stage, the <b>tunneling</b> barriers start to rise. The second stage is reached when the <b>tunneling</b> barriers are high enough to prevent electrons from <b>tunneling.</b> The third stage occurs when the high barrier starts to lower. And finally, in the fourth stage, the <b>tunneling</b> barriers allow electrons to freely tunnel again. In simple words, when the clock signal is high, electrons are free to tunnel. When the clock signal is low, the cell becomes latched.|$|E
25|$|This is a {{model for}} the quantum <b>tunneling</b> effect which plays an {{important}} role in the performance of modern technologies such as flash memory and scanning <b>tunneling</b> microscopy. Quantum <b>tunneling</b> is central to physical phenomena involved in superlattices.|$|E
25|$|Fowler–Nordheim <b>tunneling</b> is the wave-mechanical <b>tunneling</b> of {{electrons}} through a rounded triangular barrier created {{at the surface}} of an electron conductor by applying a very high electric field. Individual electrons can escape by Fowler-Nordheim <b>tunneling</b> from many materials in various different circumstances.|$|E
25|$|IETF {{protocols}} can be encapsulated recursively, {{as demonstrated}} by <b>tunneling</b> protocols such as Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE). GRE uses the same mechanism that OSI uses for <b>tunneling</b> at the network layer.|$|E
25|$|It {{was later}} {{claimed by the}} Keller group in Switzerland that {{particle}} <b>tunneling</b> does indeed occur in zero real time. Their tests involved <b>tunneling</b> electrons, where the group argued a relativistic prediction for <b>tunneling</b> time should be 500-600 attoseconds (an attosecond is one quintillionth (1018) of a second). All that could be measured was 24 attoseconds, which is the limit of the test accuracy. Again, though, other physicists believe that <b>tunneling</b> experiments in which particles appear to spend anomalously short times inside the barrier are in fact fully compatible with relativity, although there is disagreement about whether the explanation involves reshaping of the wave packet or other effects.|$|E
25|$|The TBM faced many {{challenges}} during the <b>tunneling.</b> Much of the <b>tunneling</b> {{took place in}} water-bearing strata of metamorphic and granitic rock. The presence of water, coupled with {{the depth of the}} tunnel, up to 1,100 feet underground, forced the <b>tunneling</b> team to deal with water pressures in excess of 150 pounds per square inch. Additionally, the tunnel alignment crossed or traversed near several significant faults and shear zones, including branches of the San Andreas and Arrowhead Springs Faults. In these faulted areas, the massive blocks of rock were broken into fine debris that were treated with grout before <b>tunneling</b> could safely cross through these zones. A particularly challenging reach of the tunnel alignment was encountered in the last 1,500 feet of the <b>tunneling</b> work as the TBM crossed five significant fault and shear zones along the tunnel alignment on its way to completion at the Devil Canyon Portal. While <b>tunneling</b> in this zone in mid-2008, the TBM began dipping as it encountered a 40-foot-wide fault zone of completely crushed, weak rock. Concrete and steel foundation pads were constructed in front of the cutter head to stabilize the TBM and correct the alignment of the machine as it crossed the weak ground within the fault zone. The tunnel was completed in August 2008, with installation of pipeline being completed in 2009.|$|E
25|$|The TFET (tunnel field-effect transistor) {{is based}} on band-to-band <b>tunneling.</b>|$|E
25|$|In some {{electronic}} devices, {{electron transfer}} from one material to another, or (in {{the case of}} sloping bands) from one band to another ("Zener tunneling"), takes place by a field-induced <b>tunneling</b> process that {{can be regarded as}} a form of Fowler-Nordheim <b>tunneling.</b> For example, Rhoderick's book discusses the theory relevant to metal-semiconductor contacts.|$|E
25|$|The {{operation}} of a scanning <b>tunneling</b> microscope (STM) relies on this <b>tunneling</b> effect. In that case, the barrier {{is due to the}} gap between the tip of the STM and the underlying object. Since the tunnel current depends exponentially on the barrier width, this device is extremely sensitive to height variations on the examined sample.|$|E
25|$|All {{these remarks}} apply in {{principle}} to FowlerNordheim <b>tunneling</b> from any conductor where (before <b>tunneling)</b> the electrons may be treated as in travelling-wave states. The approach may be adapted to apply (approximately) to situations where the electrons are initially in localized states at or very close inside the emitting surface, but this {{is beyond the scope}} of this article.|$|E
25|$|Terrain: Maglevs {{are able}} to ascend higher grades, {{offering}} more routing flexibility and reduced <b>tunneling.</b>|$|E
25|$|Oppenheimer had {{predicted}} that the field-induced <b>tunneling</b> of electrons from atoms (the effect now called field ionization) would have this i(V) dependence, had found this dependence in the published experimental field emission results of Millikan and Eyring, and proposed that CFE was due to field-induced <b>tunneling</b> of electrons from atomic-like orbitals in surface metal atoms. An alternative Fowler–Nordheim theory explained both the Millikan-Lauritsen finding and the very weak dependence of current on temperature. Fowler–Nordheim theory predicted both to be consequences if CFE were due to field-induced <b>tunneling</b> from free-electron-type states in what we would now call a metal conduction band, with the electron states occupied in accordance with Fermi–Dirac statistics.|$|E
25|$|Single-molecule magnets {{represent}} a molecular approach to nanomagnets (nanoscale magnetic particles). In addition, single-molecule magnets have provided physicists with useful test-beds {{for the study}} of quantum mechanics. Macroscopic quantum <b>tunneling</b> of the magnetization was first observed in Mn12O12, characterized by evenly spaced steps in the hysteresis curve. The periodic quenching of this <b>tunneling</b> rate in the compound Fe8 has been observed and explained with geometric phases.|$|E

25|$|In more {{sophisticated}} implementations, QM/MM methods exist to treat both light nuclei susceptible to quantum effects (such as hydrogens) and electronic states. This allows generating hydrogen wave-functions (similar to electronic wave-functions). This methodology has been useful in investigating phenomena such as hydrogen <b>tunneling.</b> One example where QM/MM methods have provided new discoveries is {{the calculation of}} hydride transfer in the enzyme liver alcohol dehydrogenase. In this case, quantum <b>tunneling</b> {{is important for the}} hydrogen, as it determines the reaction rate.|$|E
