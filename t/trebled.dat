5|$|An {{extensive}} housebuilding programme {{started in}} the 1960s, and Radyr's population grew rapidly — particularly children. In 1964 Radyr Comprehensive School had 135 pupils on its roll. This number more than <b>trebled</b> in the next decade. A new development, the Danescourt estate, was built on land surrounding Radyr Court and St John the Baptist parish church, and the land was officially incorporated as a suburb of Cardiff in 1974. Danybryn Woods, near the development, was retained as the entire forest is protected by a tree preservation order and is home to many species of plants and wildlife. Radyr railway station was renovated in 1998 and the tracks through the station were renewed, reducing journey times to Cardiff city centre.|$|E
5|$|Bute {{was closely}} {{involved}} in the developments across Glamorganshire {{during the first half}} of the 19th century. The region saw tremendous economic and social changes in a short period of time. The population almost <b>trebled</b> in the first forty years of the century and industrial outputs soured, with the output of pig iron increasing from 34,000 to 277,000 tons between 1796 and 1830. Industry and mining replaced agriculture as the main sources of work. In driving forward and responding to these changes, Bute transformed his South Wales estate into a major industrial enterprise.|$|E
5|$|Globe Town was {{established}} from 1800 {{to provide for}} the expanding population of weavers around Bethnal Green, attracted by improving prospects in silk weaving. The population of Bethnal Green <b>trebled</b> between 1801 and 1831, with 20,000 looms being operated in people's own homes. By 1824, with restrictions on importation of French silks relaxed, up to half these looms had become idle, and prices were driven down. With many importing warehouses already established in the district, the abundance of cheap labour was turned to boot, furniture and clothing manufacture. Globe Town continued its expansion into the 1860s, long after the decline of the silk industry.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Treble</b> jigs (also {{called the}} hard or heavy jig) are {{performed}} in hard shoes, {{and also to}} a [...] time metre. They are characterized by stomps, <b>trebles,</b> and clicks. Many set dances are performed in <b>treble</b> jig time, a few being Drunken Gauger, Blackthorn Stick, The Three Sea Captains, and St Patrick's Day. Two types of <b>treble</b> jigs are performed at feiseanna: the traditional and non-traditional (slow) <b>treble</b> jigs. Beginners will do a <b>treble</b> jig at traditional speed (92 bpm), while more advanced dancers will dance the non-traditional (slow) <b>treble</b> jig at 72 bpm.|$|R
25|$|The {{same thing}} happens as the player goes up the <b>treble</b> bridge – after getting to La (B in this case), one has to go {{to the left of the}} <b>treble</b> bridge.

5|$|The {{agricultural}} sector continued to perform poorly and by Brezhnev's final year, food shortages were reaching disturbing levels of frequency. Particularly embarrassing {{to the regime}} {{was the fact that}} even bread had become rationed, one commodity that they always prided themselves on being available. One reason for this was excessive consumer demand as food prices remained artificially low while incomes had <b>trebled</b> over the last 20 years. Despite the miserable failure of collective farming, the Soviet government remained committed to reducing imports of foodstuffs from the West even though they cost less than domestic production, not only for reasons of national pride, but out of fear of becoming dependent on capitalist countries for basic necessities.|$|E
5|$|Between 1848 and 1905, {{traffic on}} Beverley Beck more than <b>trebled,</b> from 33,498 tons to 101,540 tons. Coal and other {{minerals}} accounted for around {{one quarter of}} the traffic in 1905, while goods carried in 1906 included fertiliser, burnt ore, flour and scrap metal. Commercial traffic continued into the 1970s, when tolls of £2,365 were collected on 28,169 tons of cargo. Traffic on the Driffield Navigation was relatively steady between 1871 and 1905, falling slightly from 35,654 to 32,666 tons. Goods carried included coal, linseed, cottonseed, wheat, flour and artificial manures. In 1922, £7 of income was received from pleasure craft using the navigation. Traffic declined during the 1930s, with commercial traffic finally ceasing in 1944. The Leven Canal carried 4,242 tons in 1888 and 4,546 in 1905, but then succumbed to road competition, and closed in 1935.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the course}} of the 1990s, Zimbabwe's economy {{steadily}} deteriorated. By 2000, living standards had declined from 1980; life expectancy was reduced, average wages were lower, and unemployment had <b>trebled.</b> By 1998, unemployment was almost at 50%. As of 2009, three to four million Zimbabweans—the greater part of the nation's skilled workforce—had left the country. In 1997 there were growing demands for pensions from those who had fought for the guerrilla armies in the revolutionary war, and in August 1997 Mugabe put together a pension package that would cost the county ZD 4.2 billion. To finance this pension scheme, Mugabe's government proposed new taxes, but a general strike was called in protest in December 1997; amid protest from ZANU-PF itself, Mugabe's government abandoned the taxes. In January 1998, riots about lack of access to food broke out in Harare; the army was deployed to restore order, with at least ten killed and hundreds injured.|$|E

5|$|With his war service loan, Whitlam built a {{house in}} seaside Cronulla. He also bought the block of land next door, using the prize money (£1,000 in {{security}} bonds) he received for winning the Australian National Quiz Championship in 1948 and 1949 (he was runner-up in 1950). He sought {{to make a career}} in the ALP there, but local Labor supporters were sceptical of Whitlam's loyalties, given his privileged background. In the postwar years, he practised law, concentrating on landlord/tenant matters, and sought to build his bona fides in the party. He ran twice—unsuccessfully—for the local council, once (also unsuccessfully) for the New South Wales Legislative Assembly, and campaigned for other candidates. In 1951, Bert Lazzarini, the Labor member for the Federal electorate of Werriwa, announced that he would stand down at the next election. Whitlam won the preselection as ALP candidate. Lazzarini died in 1952 before completing his term and Whitlam was elected to the House of Representatives in the ensuing by-election on 29 November 1952. Whitlam <b>trebled</b> Lazzarini's majority in a 12per cent swing to Labor.|$|E

50|$|Where the G-clef {{is placed}} on the second line of the stave, it is called the <b>treble</b> clef. This is the most common clef used today, and the only G-clef still in use.

50|$|Tenor = <b>treble</b> clef with an 8 below or {{a double}} <b>treble</b> clef. Many pieces, {{particularly}} those {{from before the}} 21st century, use an unaltered <b>treble</b> clef, with the expectation the tenors will still sing an octave lower than notated.|$|R
25|$|Program {{production}} in indigenous affairs, comedy, social history and current affairs was significantly expanded, while the Corporation's output of drama was boosted.

25|$|Since the {{constitutional}} reforms, {{it has also}} been possible for a candidate to run against a serving chief judge if one third of the city's senior judges sign a petition calling for a recall election.

5000|$|Music for the dolçaina {{is always}} written in <b>treble</b> clef. G-dolçaina (dolçaina en sol)is a {{transposing}} instrument and its music {{is written in}} <b>treble</b> clef. Scores written for dolçaina should ideally be transposed into <b>treble</b> clef. Therefore, the lowest note is D4 (the first one below the <b>treble</b> clef staff) and the highest one is A5 (on the first additional line above the <b>treble</b> clef staff). In order to find the actual concert note pitches (in C) in a score for dolçaina, one must transpose them up a perfect fifth, as for the cor anglais (English Horn).|$|R
25|$|Finally, by {{improving}} personal mobility the railways were a significant force for social change. Rail transport {{had originally been}} conceived {{as a way of}} moving coal and industrial goods but the railway operators quickly realised the potential for market for railway travel, leading to an extremely rapid expansion in passenger services. The number of railway passengers <b>trebled</b> in just eight years between 1842 and 1850: traffic volumes roughly doubled in the 1850s and then doubled again in the 1860s.|$|E
25|$|By 1993 Charles Curran was {{planning}} to expand his regional television holdings in NSW and bid to buy NRTV. The move could have <b>trebled</b> the reach of Capital Television in the state taking in Newcastle, Coffs Harbour and Taree. Curran was unsuccessful and NRTV was bought by a consortium made up of Jack Cowin (Hungry Jacks), Kerry Stokes and Telecasters North Queensland. With little opportunity to expand his regional television holdings, Curren sold CTC to Southern Cross Broadcasting in December 1994, retaining ADS Adelaide and NEW Perth.|$|E
25|$|At {{this point}} in time, Blackpool played home matches at Raikes Hall (or the Royal Palace Gardens), {{part of a large}} {{entertainment}} complex containing several attractions, including a theatre and a boating lake. This meant that average attendances hovered around the two-thousand mark, making the club's early years financially successful. Profits almost <b>trebled</b> {{by the end of the}} following season, at which point the club became founder members of the Lancashire League. In the league's first season, 1889–90, Blackpool finished fifth out of the thirteen member clubs. The following three seasons saw them finish runners-up, to Bury in 1890–91 and 1891–92, and on goal-difference to Liverpool in 1892–93.|$|E

25|$|Temperature has a {{multiplicity}} of effects on plants depending {{on a variety of}} factors, including the size and condition of the plant and the temperature and duration of exposure. The smaller and more succulent the plant, the greater the susceptibility to damage or death from temperatures that are too high or too low. Temperature affects the rate of biochemical and physiological processes, rates generally (within limits) increasing with temperature. However, the Van’t Hoff relationship for monomolecular reactions (which states that the velocity of a reaction is doubled or <b>trebled</b> by a temperature increase of 10nbsp&°C) does not strictly hold for biological processes, especially at low and high temperatures.|$|E

5000|$|Most <b>trebles</b> have a {{comfortable}} {{range from the}} A below [...] "middle C" [...] (A3) to the F {{one and a half}} octaves above [...] "middle C" [...] (F5). This ability may be comparatively rare, but the Anglican church repertory, which many trained <b>trebles</b> to sing, frequently demands G5 and A5. Some <b>trebles,</b> however, can extend their voices higher in the modal register to [...] "high C" [...] (C6). The high C is considered the defining note of the soprano voice type. For high notes see, for example, the <b>treble</b> solo at the beginning of Stanford's [...] in G, David Willcocks' descant to Mendelssohn's tune for the carol Hark, the Herald Angels Sing, the even higher <b>treble</b> solo from Gregorio Allegri's , and the <b>treble</b> part in the [...] from Tippett's Evening Canticles written for St John's College, Cambridge.
