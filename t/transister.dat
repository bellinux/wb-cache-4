50|$|Around this time, Clark was {{increasingly}} {{working as a}} songwriter and record producer. He co-wrote and produced much of Lauren Christy's album Breed, the title track {{of which was a}} hit on the Billboard Alternative chart, and left <b>Transister</b> to devote more time to this.|$|E
50|$|<b>Transister's</b> {{formation}} was {{the culmination}} of various collaborations between songwriter Eric Pressly, former Danny Wilson frontman Gary Clark, and vocalist Keely Hawkes. Hawkes first made use of Pressly's songwriting on her 1993 solo debut for EMI, while Pressly and Clark first worked together in the band King L in 1995. The three were encouraged by the results of their early songwriting attempts, and decided to release a six-song EP on their own record label.|$|R
40|$|To {{deal with}} the {{increasing}} varitations of the intra-chip <b>transisters,</b> one promising approach is to dynamically de-tect and recover the timing-errors with microarchitecutre. This will induce dependability and efficiency into micropro-cessors because it allows VLSI to operate at the optimum frequency and voltage while ensuring accuracy. A few approaches for dynamically detecting timing-errors have been proposed, {{but none of them}} have focused on register writes. In this paper, we propose a technique for detecting and recovering from timing errors during reg-ister writes. We introduce a verifying technique that uses additional buffer (called the write assurance buffer (WAB)) which is provided with a sufficient timing margin. The eval-uation results reveal a performance degradation of 4. 5 % using an 8 -entry WAB; this value becomes negligible when a 16 -entry WAB is used. ...|$|R
50|$|Gary Clark (born 10 March 1962, Dundee, Scotland) is a Scottish musician, {{songwriter}} {{and record}} producer. As a performer {{he is best}} known as the frontman of 1980s pop band Danny Wilson and mid-1990s rock band King L (as well as for being a member of <b>Transister).</b> Since the mid-1990s he has concentrated on songwriting and production.|$|E
50|$|<b>Transister</b> was an {{alternative}} rock band, formed in late 1995 in Los Angeles, by music industry veterans {{from both the}} United States and the United Kingdom. Despite only having released one album to moderate sales, their work has been featured {{on a number of}} film soundtracks. The band was fronted by Keely Hawkes, the sister of Chesney Hawkes (daughter of Len 'Chip' Hawkes).|$|E
50|$|The band {{served as}} a launchpad for the career of Gary Clark, who also played in the 1990s bands King L and <b>Transister</b> before {{becoming}} a successful songwriter for other artists including Natalie Imbruglia, Liz Phair, Nick Carter, k.d. lang and former Spice Girls Melanie C and Emma Bunton. Other {{former members of the}} band have played in Simple Minds, Deacon Blue and Swiss Family Orbison.|$|E
50|$|<b>Transister</b> {{began to}} attract major label {{attention}} after KCRW DJ Christopher Douridas played {{a few of}} the self-recorded tracks on Morning Becomes Eclectic in early 1996. Interscope Records released Transister's self-titled debut in the US in 1997; UK and international distribution was handled by Virgin Records. Tracks from the album were featured on a number of film soundtracks, including Night Watch, Wild Things, Jawbreaker, Never Been Kissed, Charlie's Angels and Cheaters. Although members of the band have since gone on to other projects, Hawkes and Pressly maintained a relationship and were married on January 8, 2005.|$|E
5000|$|Following the {{relative}} commercial failure of Ten Short Songs About Love, Gary Clark abandoned solo work to form first the rock band King L (with American bass player Eric Pressly and former Bible guitarist Neill Maccoll) {{and then the}} pop band <b>Transister</b> (with Pressly and lead singer Keeley Hawkes). Clark then stepped down from performing to turn his attention to writing and producing for other artists. In 2001, He worked on Natalie Imbruglia's second album White Lilies Island, and co-wrote most of the album's songs with her, including the single [...] "Wrong Impression"; He continued to collaborate with her until 2009.|$|E
5000|$|In 1979, Stips left Sweet d'Buster {{and formed}} <b>Transister,</b> which {{released}} one album: Zig Zag. In 1981, Robert Jan Stips released his first solo LP (U.P.). The same year, Stips became the keyboard player for The Nits, {{with whom he}} had previously worked as a producer. During his years with The Nits he also produced albums for Cloud Nine and Vitesse. He was the main composer of The Nits' orchestral work, Hjuvi - A Rhapsody in Time. In 1982 Stips appeared on Golden Earring's Cut release. It featured the group's worldwide hit [...] "Twilight Zone". Stip also plays on the group's 1986 release The Hole.|$|E
5000|$|Hawkes {{was born}} in Swindon, Wiltshire to Carol (Dilworth) and Leonard Hawkes. Chesney was named after the singer and comedian Chesney Allen. His father is the singer Len 'Chip' Hawkes, {{formerly}} with the 1960s band The Tremeloes. His mother is former actress/game show hostess, Carol Dilworth, who appeared in an episode of the 1960s version of Randall and Hopkirk called [...] "For The Girl Who Has Everything", {{as well as the}} 1969 horror movie The Haunted House of Horror. Keely Hawkes, his sister, was the lead singer of 1990s band <b>Transister,</b> and is currently a songwriter based in Los Angeles. He attended Charters School in Sunningdale.|$|E
50|$|Following the {{break-up}} of Danny Wilson, Clark {{embarked on a}} solo career, releasing a 1991 single ("You Can't Turn Around Me") on Seven Records under the temporary project name of Eleven. Reverting to his own name, he released a 1993 solo album called Ten Short Songs About Love on Virgin Records subsidiary Circa Records, {{with the assistance of}} the other Danny Wilson members. Clark then formed a rock band called King L (with bass player Eric Pressly, former Bible guitarist Neill MacColl and drummer Matt Laug). The band released an album, A Great Day For Gravity, in 1995. Clark and Pressly then went on to form a band with Pressly's girlfriend Keely Hawkes to form the pop trio <b>Transister,</b> whose songs were featured on the films Nightwatch, Jawbreaker, Wild Things and Charlie's Angels.|$|E
40|$|A <b>transister</b> R-C {{oscillator}} {{was designed}} and applied to the wireless temperature measurements. A R-C oscillator of Wien bridge type was transisterized. Thermisters being used as R elements, the proper frequency of the oscillator gives the measure of temperature.

40|$|Abstract. The {{continuing}} {{improvement of}} processor performance {{has increased the}} demand on interconnection bandwidth {{at a rate that}} outpaces the bandwidth provided by conventional electrical interconnects. By combining a high-bandwidth optical interconnect technology with the ubiquitous high-performance CMOS technology, optoelectronic routers show the potential to supply greater bandwidth capacity as well as complex functionality suitable for developing high-performance interconnection networks demanded by current and next-generation processors. However, developing optoelectronic chips at this level of complexity is not conventional and, hence, there are several issues to be investigated. In this work we evaluate design issues regarding the integration of complex CMOS core circuitry with optoelectronic SEEDs using a semi-analytical model. Our results show that complex optoelectronic chips can still yield better interconnection bandwidth compared to high-performance CMOS chips, albeit at the expense of decreased <b>transister</b> density and increased critical paths...|$|E
40|$|A Neuron MOS <b>Transister</b> {{has been}} developed(1), as new {{functional}} device which behaves more intelligently {{than a mere}} switching device. This functional device calculates weighted sum of all input signals at the gate level, and turns <on< or <off< based on the result of such a weighted sum operation. Making use of this powerful function, a number of interesting circuit applications have been explored. One {{of the most striking}} features of Neuron MOS applications is the realization of a variable logic circuit. This circuit can represent any logic function AND, OR, NAND, NOR, Exclusive-OR, Exclusive-NOR, etc., by adjusting external control signals without any changes in the hardware configuration. The circuit allows us to build real-time reconfigurable systems. In this paper, we propose a design of the universal variable logic circuit which represents 16 binary logic function in 2 -variable, and another variable logic circuit which represents 6 binary logic function(AND, OR, NAND, NOR, Exclusive-OR, Exclusive-NOR) in any variable. The circuits are designed with a graphcal method which we call Floating-Gate Potential Diagram(2). PSPICE simulation results of the circuits are also presented...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the algebraic and Kripke model soundness and completeness of a logic over Boolean monoids. An additional axiom {{added to the}} logic will cause the resulting monoid models to be representable as monoids of relations. A star operator, interpreted as reflexive, transitive closure, is conservatively added to the logic. The star operator is a relative modal operator, i. e., one that is {{defined in terms of}} another modal operator. A further example, relative possibility, of this type of operator is given. A separate axiom, antilogism, added to the logic causes the Kripke models to support a collection of abstract topological uniformities which become concrete when the Kripke models are dual to monoids of relations. The machinery for the star operator is shown to be a recasting of Scott-Montague neighborhood models. An interpretation of the Kripke frames and properties thereof is presented in terms of certain CMOS <b>transister</b> networks and some circuit transformation equivalences. The worlds of the Kripke frame are wires and the Kripke relation is a specialized CMOS pass transistor network...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{describes}} the optical technique {{that has been}} developed to measure the variation of the spatial density of blowing snow particles suspended in air. The light source (the emitter) used was an incandescent lamp (12 V, 20 W), and a diameter of light beam was 46 mm. The receiver was used a photo <b>transister.</b> This instruments were set in two levels of 1 m and 2 m at Syowa Station (69 Â° S, 39. 5 Â°E) in 1973. The transmission path of light were 4. 5 m in both case. If {{it is assumed that}} snow particles in blowing snow are the same size and the same shape, then the attenuation of a light beam should depend on the spatial density of blowing snow. The emprical correlations between the attenuation of a light beam (the transmittivity) and the mean visibility, and between the transmittivity and the drift flux were given for practical use. Observations made only in night time and during the period of high winds (also called Antarctic blizzards). For example, when the mean wind speed at 10 m level was 30 m/s, the drift flux at 1 m level changed quickly between 80 and 400 g/m^ 2 ãƒ»s...|$|E
40|$|The skin blood {{volume and}} the skin {{temperature}} were measured on 25 sites of the skin surface of 22 males and 30 females at a room temperature of 24 ãƒ¼C and 13 ãƒ¼C by the topogaphicai photoelectric plethysmograph using a <b>transister</b> and a thermister thermometer. The results were as follows; 1) The skin blood volume is larger at higher room temperatures and smaller at lower temperatures. The same tendency was seen in skin temperature. 2) The skin blood volume is larger in females than males in both high and low room temperatures. The skin temperature is higher in females at high room temperatures but is low in the low room temperature. 3) The individual variation of the skin blood volume is large at high room temperatures, but that of the skin temperature is large at low temperatures. It was noted that both variations are larger in the female than in the male. 4) The differences of the skin blood volume between the body trunk and limbs are small in both high and low room temperatures, but the differences of the skin temperature is large between the sites in the low room temperature. 5) in the limbs, the brachial and internal femoral sites have a larger skin blood volume and high skin temperature. The bending side of antihrachial and crural site has a larger skin blood volume and higher skin temperature than the stretch side. 6) Among the sites, the cervical side has a larger skin blood volume and high skin temperature, but the gluteal side has a small volume and low temperature, especialy in the females, at low room temperatures. 7) The skin blood volume {{and the skin}} temperature ran in parallel together on the whole, but not generally. In the fingers, digitals, hands and feet the above do not run in parallel with each other. 8) It was concluded that measuring of skin blood volume {{is important for the}} study of skin microcirculation...|$|E
40|$|The {{conventional}} {{high voltage}} power transistor is a vertical device. That is, {{one in which}} the current flow is vertical. This construction technique has evolved from both physical reasons and the relative ease of construction of these devices. Whether the device is a Field Effect <b>Transister</b> (FET) or a Bipolar Junction Transistor (BJT), this vertical current flow results in the substrate, that part of the silicon wafer on which the device is built, being the drain or the collector terminal. If it is wished to integrate circuitry to control the power device on the same chip, the fact that the substrate is a terminal which can change its potential as the load or device characteristics are varied, presents severe common mode problems. A lateral transistor, one in which all terminals are {{on the top of the}} chip and the resultant current flow is lateral to the top, can alleviate these problems to some extent. While this construction technique is not common, numerous examples of these devices exist in the literature. Generally these devices are either low voltage units or, for a given value of voltage/current capability, they use considerably more chip surface than a comparable vertical device. In this study, a new lateral device, The LAteral Bipolar Field Effect Transistor or LABFET, is described. This device replaces the normal n+-drain diffusion, used in the typical Double Diffused MOS (DMOS) transistor with a p-type diffusion. This p-diffusion acts as the emitter of a low gain p- n-p bipolar transistor. The base of this device is the n-substrate or n-well, when the device is part of an integrated circuit. The base current is supplied by turning on the DMOS Field Effect Transistor. The result is a conductivity modulated device, with all terminals on the top of the chip, a voltage withstand capability of 100 V and an on-staAte conductance of. 71 Siemans per cm of gate width. This is comparable with conventional vertical FET devices. The static and dynamic characteristics of 2 Ì† 2 Unit cell 2 Ì† 2 devices are presented with an explanation of the results and a description of the processing to produce them. Finally, suggestions are made which would allow the extension of this concept to a large device suitable for integration into a power integrated circuit...|$|E
