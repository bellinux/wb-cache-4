5|$|Saddlebreds are {{popularly known}} as show horses, with horses being shown saddle seat in both three-gaited and five-gaited classes. The former are the three common gaits seen in most breeds, the walk, trot and canter. The latter {{includes}} the three regular gaits, plus two four-beat ambling gaits known as <b>the</b> <b>slow</b> gait and the rack. <b>The</b> <b>slow</b> gait today is a four-beat gait in which the lateral pairs of legs leave the ground together, but strike the ground at different times, the hind foot connecting slightly before the forefoot. In the show ring, the gait should be performed with restraint and precision. The rack is also a four-beat gait, but with equal intervals between each footfall, making it a smooth gait to ride. In the show ring, the gait is performed with speed and action, appearing unrestrained. Historically, <b>the</b> <b>slow</b> gait could be either a running walk, the stepping pace, or the fox trot, however, the modern five-gaited Saddlebred usually performs the stepping pace.|$|E

40|$|We study <b>the</b> <b>slowing</b> down of {{particle}} beams {{passing through the}} dusty plasma with power-law kappa-distributions. Three plasma components, electrons, ions and dust particles, can have different kappa-parameter. We derive the deceleration factor (the velocity moment equation) and <b>the</b> <b>slowing</b> down time of a test particle, and numerically study <b>the</b> <b>slowing</b> down properties of an electron beam, a proton beam and a dust particle beam, respectively, in the kappa-distributed dusty plasma. We show that <b>the</b> <b>slowing</b> down properties {{of particle}} beams depend strongly on the kappa-parameters of the plasma components, and the dust component plays a dominant role in <b>the</b> <b>slowing</b> down. And <b>the</b> <b>slowing</b> down also depends on mass and charge of the dust particles in the dusty plasma. More detailed results are shown in 17 numerical graphs.

40|$|A {{transverse}} Zeeman slower {{composed of}} {{an array of}} compact discrete neodymium magnets is considered. A simple and precise model of such a slower based on magnetic dipoles is developed. The theory of a general Zeeman slower is modified to include spatial nonuniformity of <b>the</b> <b>slowing</b> laser beam intensity due to its convergence and absorption by <b>slowed</b> atoms. <b>The</b> <b>slower</b> needs no high currents or water cooling and the spatial distribution of its magnetic field can be adjusted. In addition <b>the</b> <b>slower</b> provides a possibility to cool <b>the</b> <b>slowed</b> atoms transversally along the whole length of <b>the</b> <b>slower.</b> Such a slower would be ideal for transportable optical atomic clocks and their future applications in space physics.

40|$|In {{accordance}} with the Navier-Stokes equation between planar plates, the equation of motion of the Binghamian grouts is deduced in smooth and inclined fissures. The model indicates that the velocity of flow gradually reduce {{with the development of}} time. And the greater the pressure is, the greater the speed is, as a result, the Binghamian grouts has a further infiltration. The velocity of flow of Binghamian grouts {{has nothing to do with}} fissure inclination. In addition, in the circumstance of the same parameters, the wider the fissure is, <b>the</b> <b>slower</b> <b>the</b> velocity of flow of Binghamian grouts is; the bigger the viscosity of grouts is, <b>the</b> <b>slower</b> <b>the</b> flow is; the smaller the initial shear strength is, <b>the</b> <b>slower</b> <b>the</b> flow is; the bigger the Binghamian grouts density is, <b>the</b> <b>slower</b> <b>the</b> flow is; and vice versa. 特集 : 「資源、新エネルギー、環境、防災研究国際セミナー...|$|R

5|$|International trade usually {{results in}} a high {{mortality}} rate during transit, between 30% and 90%. Slow lorises also experience many health problems {{as a result of}} both local and international trade. To give the impression that the primates are tame and appropriate pets for children, to protect people from their potentially toxic bite, or to deceive buyers into thinking the animal is a baby, animal dealers either pull the front teeth with pliers or wire cutters or they cut them off with nail cutters. This results in severe bleeding, which sometimes causes shock or death, and frequently leads to dental infection, which is fatal in 90% of all cases. Without their teeth, the animals are no longer able to fend for themselves in the wild, and must remain in captivity for life. <b>The</b> <b>slow</b> lorises found in animal markets are usually underweight and malnourished, and have had their fur dyed, which complicates species identification at rescue centers.

30|$|Since in our technique, slower {{vehicles}} {{will be in}} one cluster and faster {{vehicles will}} be in a different cluster, we can start the cluster formation process either from <b>the</b> <b>slowest</b> or fastest vehicle. For example, if we start with <b>the</b> <b>slowest</b> vehicle, then all the neighboring vehicles of this slowest vehicle that satisfy the speed threshold will be in the first cluster. The remaining vehicles will then go through the same cluster formation process to create other clusters. By extracting the velocity data embedded in the periodic messages, any vehicle can determine whether it has <b>the</b> <b>slowest</b> velocity among all its neighbors within R communication range. <b>The</b> <b>slowest</b> vehicle, in our method, is supposed to initiate the cluster formation process by sending a cluster formation request and only its stable neighbors participate in this process.

5|$|Slow lorises have a {{round head}} because their skull is shorter {{than in other}} living strepsirrhine.
