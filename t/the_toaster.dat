25|$|<b>The</b> <b>toaster</b> is {{typically}} a small electric kitchen appliance designed to toast multiple types of bread {{products such as}} sliced bread, bagels, and English muffins. Although {{not the first to}} invent <b>the</b> <b>toaster,</b> the pop-up toaster was invented by Charles Strite in 1919, consisting of a variable timer and springs in order to prevent burnt toast. Strite received a patent for his invention on May 29, 1919.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>toasters</b> were <b>the</b> {{subject of}} two lawsuits, {{the first in}} 1993, Berkeley Systems vs Delrina Corporation, over a module of Delrina's Opus 'N Bill screen saver in which Opus the Penguin shoots down <b>the</b> <b>toasters.</b> Delrina later changed the wings of <b>the</b> <b>toasters</b> to {{propellers}} {{in order to avoid}} infringing the trademark. The second case was brought in 1994 by the 1960s rock group Jefferson Airplane who claimed that <b>the</b> <b>toasters</b> were a copy of <b>the</b> winged <b>toasters</b> featured on <b>the</b> cover of their 1973 album Thirty Seconds Over Winterland. The case was dismissed, because the cover art had not been registered as a trademark by the group prior to Berkeley Systems' release of the screen saver.|$|R

50|$|The Bronze Toaster was {{the first}} {{creation}} suggested by Daji. It was suggested in chapter 6. Intended as a torture device, it was a bronze cylindrical device that stood over twenty feet tall and eight feet wide. It also had two wheels on each side {{to allow it to}} be moved around. Once <b>the</b> <b>toaster</b> was created, three layers of burning charcoal over three layers of burning fire could be seen inside. The victims were stripped naked and bound before being placed in <b>the</b> <b>toaster.</b> <b>The</b> <b>toaster</b> was used to execute Grand Counselor Mei Bo. Great fans were also applied to quicken the frying of his body. After this execution in chapter 6, <b>the</b> <b>toaster</b> was never mentioned again.|$|E

5000|$|Fig. 4. {{shows an}} event segment (top) and the {{associated}} state trajectory (bottom) of the left slot of the two-slot toaster introduced in Fig. 2. Like Fig.3, {{the status of the}} left slot is described as (state, lifespan, elapsed time)= (...) in Fig. 4. Since the initial state of <b>the</b> <b>toaster</b> is ``I`` and its lifetime is infinity, the height of (Wait, inf, [...] ) can be determined by when ?push occurs. Fig. 4. illustrates the case ?push happens at time 40 and <b>the</b> <b>toaster</b> changes into (T, 20, 0). From that time, 20 seconds later when its status becomes (T, 20, 20), <b>the</b> <b>toaster</b> gets back to (Wait, inf, 0) where we don't know when it gets back to ``Toast`` again. Fig. 4. shows the case that ?push occurs at time 90 so <b>the</b> <b>toaster</b> get into (T,20,0). Notice that even though there someone push again at time 97, that status (T, 20, 7) doesn't change at all because (T,?push)=(T,1).|$|E

5000|$|In pop-up or {{automatic}} toasters, {{bread slices}} are inserted vertically into the slots (generally only {{large enough to}} admit a single slice of bread each) {{on the top of}} <b>the</b> <b>toaster.</b> A lever on the side of <b>the</b> <b>toaster</b> is pressed, activating <b>the</b> <b>toaster.</b> When an internal device determines that the toasting cycle is complete, <b>the</b> <b>toaster</b> turns off and the toast pops up out of the slots. The heating elements of a pop-up toaster are usually oriented vertically, parallel to the bread slice - although there are some variations.In earlier days, the completion of the toasting operation was determined by a mechanical clockwork timer; the user could adjust the running time of the timer to determine the degree of [...] "doneness" [...] of the toast, but the first cycle produced less toasted toast than subsequent cycles because <b>the</b> <b>toaster</b> was not yet warmed up. Toasters made since the 1930s frequently use a thermal sensor, such as a bimetallic strip, located close to the toast. This allows the first cycle to run longer than subsequent cycles. The thermal device is also slightly responsive to the actual temperature of the toast itself. Like the timer, it can be adjusted by the user to determine the [...] "doneness" [...] of the toast.|$|E
