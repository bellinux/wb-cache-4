500|$|Ra is {{not unique}} in this {{relationship}} with <b>the</b> <b>Eye.</b> Other solar gods may interact {{in a similar way}} with the numerous goddesses associated with <b>the</b> <b>Eye.</b> Hathor, a goddess of the sky, the sun, and fertility, is often called <b>the</b> <b>Eye</b> <b>of</b> Ra, and she also has a relationship with Horus, who also has solar connections, that is similar to the relationship between Ra and his Eye.
