40|$|A {{monoclonal}} antibody (mAb) product development {{case study is}} presented {{to address some of}} the issues faced during developing a pre-filled syringe (PFS) product for a biotherapeutic. In particular, issues involving incompatibility with silicone oil and a stability-based approach for selection of PFS barrel and <b>tip</b> <b>cap</b> components have been discussed. Silicone spiking studies followed by exposure to agitation stress or accelerated temperature conditions were used to check for incompatibilities of the mAb with silicone oil, a necessary product contact material in PFS. In addition, screening studies to compare various closure materials as well as syringe barrel processing methods were used to select the optimum closure materials as well as the correct syringe processing method. Results indicate that the model mAb formulation used was sensitive to high levels of silicone oil especially under accelerated temperature conditions resulting in formation of protein–silicone particles in the solution for samples that were spiked with the silicone oil. Agitation stress did not have any significant impact on the quality attributes tested. Samples stored in syringe barrels that were processed with sprayed-on silicone had higher levels of subvisible particles as compared to those that were processed with the baked-on process. The <b>tip</b> <b>cap</b> comparability study resulted in one <b>tip</b> <b>cap</b> material having superior compatibility among the three that were tested. The quality attribute that was most impacted by the <b>tip</b> <b>cap</b> materials was mAb oxidation. An approach for evaluation of primary packaging components during the development of pre-filled syringe presentations for biotechnology-based compounds has been highlighted...|$|E

40|$|Color {{information}} {{is widely used}} in non-destructive quality assessment of perishable horticultural produces. The presented work investigated color changes of pepper (Capsicum annuum L.) samples received from retail system. The effect of storage temperature (10 ± 2 °C and 24 ± 4 °C) on surface color and firmness was analyzed. Hue spectra was calculated using sum of saturations. A ColorLite sph 850 (400 - 700 nm) spectrophotometer was used as reference instrument. Dynamic firmness was measured on three locations of the surface: <b>tip</b> <b>cap,</b> middle and shoulder. Significant effects of storage conditions and surface location on both color and firmness were observed. Hue spectra responded sensitively to color development of pepper. Prediction model (PLS) was used to estimate dynamic firmess based on hue spectra. Accuracy was very different depending on the location. Firmness of the <b>tip</b> <b>cap</b> was predicted with the highest accuracy (RMSEP= 0. 0335). On the other hand, middle region cannot be used for such purpose.

40|$|A {{generalized}} one-dimensional {{computer code}} for analyzing the flow and heat transfer in the turbomachinery cooling passages was developed. This code {{is capable of}} handling rotating cooling passages with turbulators, 180 degree turns, pin fins, finned passages, by-pass flows, <b>tip</b> <b>cap</b> impingement flows, and flow branching. The code {{is an extension of}} a one-dimensional code developed by P. Meitner. In the subject code, correlations for both heat transfer coefficient and pressure loss computations were developed to model each of the above mentioned type of coolant passages. The code has the capability of independently computing the friction factor and heat transfer coefficient on each side of a rectangular passage. Either the mass flow at the inlet to the channel or the exit plane pressure can be specified. For a specified inlet total temperature, inlet total pressure, and exit static pressure, the code computers the flow rates through the main branch and the subbranches, flow through <b>tip</b> <b>cap</b> for impingement cooling, in addition to computing the coolant pressure, temperature, and heat transfer coefficient distribution in each coolant flow branch.

40|$|A {{combined}} numerical {{and experimental}} investigation is {{performed on the}} fundamental aspects of tip vortex formation and convection mechanisms for a two bladed rotor. The paper is focused on identifying similarities and differences in the near wake fields caused by blade tip geometry modification. Two different configurations are investigated. The first one corresponds to a square blade tip while the second one corresponds to a rounded blade <b>tip</b> <b>cap.</b> PIV measurements of the crossflow velocities around the forming tip vortex were performed for a forward flight regime characterized by a 0. 1 advance ratio. RANS simulations of the rotor flow were conducted for the same rotor configurations as used in the experimental tests but considering only the hover regime. Both experimental and numerical tests confirm {{that there is a}} qualitative difference in the tip vortex formation and evolution between the square blade tip and rounded blade tip configurations. This qualitative change is shown in the velocity distributions measured and computed around and downstream of the tip. It is explained by the differences in the flow separation identified for the two configurations...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} studies was {{conducted}} using SEM in conjunction with chemical analysis, in situ and in vitro digestion techniques, to characterize the anatomical components from barley, corn, sorghum and wheat grains which constitute "fiber" and investigate their susceptibility to rumen microbial digestion. Fractured grains were used to identify anatomical features and cell types prior to and after extraction or digestion. Certain anatomical features, including pericarp tissue, aleurone cells, endosperm cell walls, corneous and floury endosperm tissue and lemma and palea from barley, were easily identifiable in fractured and ground grains, and in neutral detergent extracted or digested residues. In situ and in vitro incubation conditions were varied to assess the effect of concentrate and/or reduction of pH on the disappearance of identifiable grain fractions. In situ incubations were conducted using steers adapted to 0 -, 30 - and 90 % concentrate diets. In vitro inoculum buffered at pH 7 or 6 was provided by a steer fed 0 - or 90 % concentrate. Tissues resistant to rumen microbial digestion during extended (144 -h) in situ incubations and shorter term (12 - to 48 -h) in vitro incubations were primarily those identified in NDF, and included pericarp, lemma and palea, and small amounts of corneous endosperm. Remaining tissues identified included barley lemma, palea and pericarp; corn pericarp, <b>tip</b> <b>cap</b> and small amounts of corneous endosperm; sorghum pericarp and corneous endosperm with matrix and protein bodies; and wheat pericarp. In vitro disappearance of isolated NDF after 48 -h ranged from 43 % for barley to 89 % for corn. Labile structures included embryonic tissue and portions of endosperm cell walls, protein matrix and residual starch. Resistant tissues included pericarp, aleurone cell walls, <b>tip</b> <b>cap</b> and portions of the corneous endosperm. Relative rankings of NDF digestibility under all conditions studied were similar (corn > sorghum > wheat > barley) whether determined using isolated NDF or calculated from TIVDMD residues. Neither concentrate level fed to the host animal nor pH of the in vitro incubation flask affected rankings among grains, although increasing concentrate level and/or reducing pH appeared to reduce in vitro NDF disappearance. Evaluation of electron micrographs of fractured grains suggested that similar anatomical structures in the various grains differed in their resistance to microbial digestion. For example, pericarp from barley and wheat appeared to be more resistant than that from corn or sorghum. Endosperm of barley was less resistant than that of sorghum...|$|E
40|$|The {{efficiency}} of fractionating cereal grains (e. g., dry corn milling) can be evaluated and monitored by quantifying {{the proportions of}} seed tissues {{in each of the}} recovered fractions. The quantities of individual tissues are typically estimated using indirect methods such as quantifying fiber or ash to indicate pericarp and <b>tip</b> <b>cap</b> contents, and oil to indicate germ content. More direct and reliable methods are possible with tissue-specific markers. We used two transgenic maize lines, one containing the fluorescent protein green fluorescent protein (GFP) variant S 65 T expressed in endosperm, and the other containing GFP expressed in germ to determine the fate of each tissue in the dry-milling fractionation process. The two lines were dry-milled to produce three fractions (bran-, endosperm-, and germ-rich fractions) and GFP fluorescence was quantified in each fraction to estimate the tissue composition. Using a simplified laboratory dry-milling procedure and our GFP-containing grain, we determined that the endosperm-rich fraction contained 4 % germ tissue, the germ-rich fraction contained 28 % germ, 20 % endosperm, and 52 % nonendosperm and nonembryo tissues, and the bran-rich fraction contained 44 % endosperm, 13 % germ, and 43 % nonendosperm and nonembryo tissues. GFP-containing grain can be used to optimize existing fractionation methods and to develop improved processing strategies...|$|E

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation was}} made to evaluate the durability and permeability {{of a group of}} transpiration-cooled, strut-supported turbine blades. The porous shells were formed from a woven-wire material. The blades were fabricated by a contractor for the Bureau of Aeronautics. The results of permeability tests indicated that the shell material exhibited large random variations in local permeability, which result in excessive coolant flows and very nonuniform cooling. For this reason no heat-transfer evaluations were made because any results would have been inconclusive. Four blades were investigated for structural soundness in a turbo-jet engine operating at a turbine-inlet temperature of approximately 1670 deg F and a turbine tip speed of approximately 1305 feet per second. The maximum temperature of the porous-shell material was approximately 1050 deg F. Inspection of the first two blades after 10 minutes of engine operation revealed that the tips of both of the blades had failed. For the second pair of blades, an improved <b>tip</b> <b>cap</b> was provided by the use of built-up weld extending from strut tip to shell. One of these blades was then operated for 33 hours without failure, and was found to be in good condition {{at the end of this}} time.

40|$|Nephron {{number in}} the {{mammalian}} kidney is known to vary dramatically, with postnatal renal function directly inﬂuenced by nephron complement. What determines ﬁnal nephron number is poorly understood but nephron formation in the mouse kidney ceases within the ﬁrst few days after birth, presumably due {{to the loss of}} all remaining nephron progenitors via epithelial differentiation. What initiates this event is not known. Indeed, whether nephron formation occurs in the same way at this time as during embryonic development has also not been examined. In this study, we investigate the key cellular compartments involved in nephron formation; the ureteric <b>tip,</b> <b>cap</b> mesenchyme and early nephrons; from postnatal day (P) 0 to 6 in the mouse. High resolution analyses of gene and protein expression indicate that loss of nephron progenitors precedes loss of ureteric tip identity, but show spatial shifts in the expression of cap mesenchyme genes during this time. In addition, cap mesenchymal volume and rate of proliferation decline prior to birth. Section-based 3 D modeling and Optical Projection Tomography revealed a burst of ectopic nephron induction, with the formation of multiple (up to 5) nephrons per ureteric tip evident from P 2. While the distal–proximal patterning of these nephrons occurred normally, their spatial relationship with the ureteric compartment was altered. We propose that this phase of nephron formation represents an acceleration of differentiation within the cap mesenchyme due to a displacement of signals within the nephrogenic niche...|$|E
40|$|To improve {{gas turbine}} performance, the {{operating}} temperature has been increased continuously. However, the heat {{transferred to the}} turbine blade is substantially increased as the turbine inlet temperature is increased. Cooling methods are therefore much needed for the turbine blades to ensure a long durability and safe operation. The blade tip region is exposed to the hot gas flows and is difficult to cool. A common way to cool the tip is to use serpentine passages with a 180 turn under the blade <b>tip</b> <b>cap</b> {{taking advantage of the}} three-dimensional turning effect and impingement. Increasing internal convective cooling is however required to increase the blade tip life. In this article, enhanced heat transfer of a blade tip has been investigated numerically. The computational models consist of a two-pass channel with a 180 turn and arrays of pin-fins mounted on the tip-cap, and a smooth two-pass channel. Inlet Reynolds numbers range from 100, 000 to 600, 000. The computations are 3 -D, steady, and incompressible. The detailed 3 -D fluid flow and heat transfer over the tip surfaces are presented. The overall performance of the two models is evaluated. It is found that due to the combination of turning, impingement, and pin-fin crossflow the heat transfer coefficient of the pin-finned tip might be a factor of 1. 84 higher than that of a smooth tip. This augmentation is achieved at the expense of a penalty of pressure drop around 35 %. It is suggested that the pin-fins could be used to enhance blade tip heat transfer and cooling...|$|E
