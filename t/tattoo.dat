40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{relationship}} between prison <b>tattoos</b> and the criminal lifestyle and recidivism. Participants consisted of 81 male inmates with prison <b>tattoos</b> (i. e., prison-themed or prison-made <b>tattoos),</b> 75 inmates with nonprison <b>tattoos</b> (e. g., animal <b>tattoos,</b> <b>tattoos</b> of ethnic origin), 52 male inmates with no <b>tattoos,</b> and 66 college students with <b>tattoos.</b> Results indicated that inmates with prison <b>tattoos</b> differed from inmates with nonprison <b>tattoos,</b> inmates without <b>tattoos,</b> and college students with <b>tattoos</b> with regard to criminal thinking styles, were at increased risk of recidivism, and presented more institutional behavioral problems, resulting in more disciplinary infractions. There were no significant differences between inmate groups with regard to number of convictions; however, additional group comparisons indicated that inmates with visible <b>tattoos</b> and antisocial-themed <b>tattoos</b> were at greater risk for recidivism and received more disciplinary infractions than inmates without visible or antisocial-themed <b>tattoos.</b> Implications of these findings are discussed...|$|R
50|$|<b>Tattoos</b> {{developed}} in the underclass of mariner culture; in time, they grew in popularity in the port districts frequented by those sailors. Consequently, the <b>tattoos</b> became associated with the criminals, prostitutes, and gangs who dwelt in these same districts. Sailor <b>tattoos</b> differentiated from these terrestrial <b>tattoos</b> as sailors continued to design new mariner motifs of their own, creating a distinct <b>tattooing</b> culture among sailors. By the 19th century, about 90% of all United States Navy sailors had <b>tattoos.</b> In 2016 the US Navy issued new, more liberal policies on sailor <b>tattoos,</b> allowing Sailors to have <b>tattoos</b> below the knee and on the forearms and hands, as well as allowing <b>tattoos</b> up to one inch by one inch on the neck including behind the ear. Additionally, Sailors with visible <b>tattoos</b> {{will be eligible for}} recruiting duty or duty leading Sailors at boot camp.|$|R

5|$|In flashbacks, Jack is in Phuket, Thailand, {{where he}} meets a local woman named Achara (Bai Ling); the two soon {{enter into a}} relationship. After finding out that she works in a <b>tattoo</b> parlor and claims {{to be able to}} see who people really are, Jack demands that she give him a <b>tattoo.</b> Achara is {{hesitant}} to give him a <b>tattoo,</b> but she does so anyway and tells him there will be consequences. The next morning, he is beaten up by her brother and other locals and told to leave.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Ed {{is fired}} via telephone. He hears the same voice as before and yells {{at the woman}} living below him, {{thinking}} it was her. Upon hearing the voice after a pair of Jehovah's Witnesses stop by, Ed goes downstairs and murders his neighbor, throwing her body in the furnace. When her voice talks to him again, Jerse realizes it is coming from his new <b>tattoo.</b> Scully heads to Philadelphia and watches Pudovkin enter a <b>tattoo</b> parlor. Inside, she sees Ed arguing with the owner, wanting the <b>tattoo</b> removed. Ed strikes {{up a conversation with}} Scully and invites her out to dinner, which she initially declines.|$|E
5|$|That night, Scully {{talks to}} Mulder {{over the phone}} and informs him that Pudovkin is a con man {{and part of the}} Russian mafia. Frustrated by the conversation, Scully calls Jerse and tells him that she changed her mind. At a nearby lounge, Scully is {{concerned}} about Ed's arm, where he has burned the <b>tattoo</b> with a cigarette butt. Ed convinces Scully to get a <b>tattoo,</b> and she has one of an Ouroboros applied to her back. Scully stays at Ed's apartment. The <b>tattoo</b> is angry at him, saying she will be dead if he kisses her, which he does anyway.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tattoos,</b> {{including}} bum tatts (amateur <b>tattoos),</b> {{were common}} among Australian rockers.

50|$|Chinese {{calligraphy}} <b>tattoos</b> are {{a form of}} <b>tattooing</b> and a {{style of}} calligraphy combined into one form of art. Originally, Chinese calligraphy and <b>tattoos</b> were combined to distinguish social class or tribes. Calligraphy started in Europe and Asia and then spread to other continents and countries. Today, Chinese calligraphy <b>tattoos</b> can be found worldwide and anyone is able to receive them. People who tend to get these <b>tattoos</b> are fond of this style of <b>tattooing</b> because of their perceived uniqueness.|$|R
50|$|There {{are five}} types of tattoos: traumatic, amateur, professional, cosmetic, and medical. Chinese {{calligraphy}} <b>tattoos</b> may be amateur, professional, or cosmetic. Amateur and professional <b>tattoos</b> {{are the most}} common because they were used in tribes, where <b>tattoos</b> originated. However, cosmetic <b>tattoos</b> are becoming more popular because many people want to change or enhance their features. Amateur and professional <b>tattoos</b> are mostly used to express emotions or how a person felt about someone they cared deeply about. Many tribe members had <b>tattoos</b> to identify whom they were, in social class, and if they belonged to someone. Both medical and traumatic <b>tattoos</b> are not as common as the other types and usually do not make use of Chinese calligraphy. Medical <b>tattoos</b> are mostly used on patients who have a skin pigmentation disorder. Traumatic <b>tattoos</b> are caused by substances, such as asphalt, rubbing into the skin and ultimately changing the color of the skin.|$|R

5|$|As Scully {{heads to}} the other room to get ready, her FBI badge falls out of her coat pocket. Scully discreetly picks it back up without Ed noticing. The <b>tattoo</b> begins to talk again, convincing Ed to redial Scully's last call to see who she was {{speaking}} to. An FBI operator answers and, upon learning that Scully is an FBI agent, the <b>tattoo</b> forces Ed to attack her. Scully tries to escape but is overpowered by Ed, who wraps her in a bedsheet and carries her {{down to the basement}} to throw her in the furnace. At the last moment, Ed is able to overpower the impulses of the <b>tattoo</b> and instead thrusts his own arm into the furnace.|$|E

40|$|This article aims {{to analyse}} <b>tattooing</b> and <b>tattooing</b> {{tradition}} in Siverek, in the Turkish province of ¸Sanlıurfa. Although Islam prohibits <b>tattooing</b> with strict injunctions, several <b>tattooing</b> practices have existed in Siverek in the past, {{and some have}} survived until now. However, even though Islam prohibits <b>tattooing,</b> it does not explicitly condemn adorning techniques. It was precisely in this liminal terrain {{that a number of}} <b>tattooing</b> practices developed and even prospered, although in speciﬁc cultural and topographic contexts. However, if on the one hand the religious dimension of tattooing-related beliefs changed, on the other hand the tradition of <b>tattooing</b> continued through its decorative functions. When people eventually forgot the last remains of the religiously driven characters in <b>tattooing,</b> they kept the tradition by continuing the practice with exclusive reference to its adorning function...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{indicated}} that nurses with <b>tattoos</b> are viewed less favorably than nurses without <b>tattoos,</b> regardless of gender. Additionally, older adults are more likely to negatively evaluate nurses with <b>tattoos</b> than young adults. Images of male and female nurses with and without <b>tattoos</b> were shown to 128 participants between the ages of 18 - 80 years on an iPad. Participants selected according to gender which nurse possessed more of the following professional characteristics based on their initial impression of their physical traits, or selected no difference: respectfulness, kindness, trustworthiness, intelligence and competence. The study showed that male nurses with <b>tattoos</b> were perceived the same as male nurses without <b>tattoos</b> across all ages of participants, but female nurses with <b>tattoos</b> were perceived to be less kind and less trustworthy than female nurses without <b>tattoos</b> across all ages of participants. Participants’ genders did not affect their responses. The results were discussed with respect to the overall decreasing stigma of visible <b>tattoos</b> on nurses as well as the implications of the results for male and female nurses with <b>tattoos...</b>|$|R

40|$|<b>Tattooing</b> was practised by many ancient societies, {{including}} the ancient Egyptians and Nubians. Egypt, for example, boasts iconographic and physical evidence for <b>tattooing</b> {{for a period}} spanning at least 4000 years – the longest known history of <b>tattooing</b> in the world. The second oldest physical evidence for <b>tattooing</b> worldwide was recovered from Middle Kingdom contexts in Egypt and C-Group contexts in Nubia (the Hanslabjoch ice man being the oldest). It {{has been suggested that}} <b>tattooing</b> was also practised in the Predynastic period as evidenced by figurines with geometric designs, however, no physical evidence for <b>tattooing</b> has yet been found for this early period. Strangely there is almost no mention of <b>tattooing</b> in ancient Egyptian written records. Historical and ethnographic records indicate that <b>tattooing</b> was also practised much more recently in the Coptic, Islamic and modern eras. Unlike many past societies, <b>tattooing</b> in Egypt {{appears to have been a}} custom practised almost exclusively on women. <b>Tattooing</b> tools have not yet been positively identified from ancient Egypt. Ethnographic sources suggest that bundles of metal rods were used in Egypt’s more recent history. This paper discusses physical and iconographic evidence for <b>tattooing</b> in ancient Egypt and investigates whether five copper rods found at Kafr Hassan Dawood, a Predynastic to Early Dynastic site in the East Delta, could be physical evidence for <b>tattooing</b> during this early period. </span...|$|R

40|$|<b>Tattooing</b> {{refers to}} marking {{of the skin}} by {{puncturing}} and introducing pigmented material. Although it derives from a Polynesian word, tautau, decorative <b>tattooing</b> {{has been found in}} most societies over many centuries. The purpose of <b>tattooing</b> has varied from simple decoration, to a marker of social rank, criminal and noncriminal group membership, or a particular rite of passage in tribal communities. <b>Tattooing</b> may be used in medicine to mark areas for radiotherapy, and may occur inadvertently associated with certain occupations such as coal mining. Forensically, <b>tattoos</b> may be very useful in assisting with body identification if facial features or fingers have been damaged or removed. Aspects of a decedent's history may also be deduced from certain <b>tattoos</b> such as military <b>tattoos</b> in service personnel, rudimentary line <b>tattoos</b> with antisocial and anti-police messages in ex-prisoners, and syringes, marihuana leaves or mushrooms in illicit drug users. <b>Tattoos</b> have become more common in recent years in younger individuals in the West and so should be expected to be found with increasing incidence at the time of forensic autopsy examinations. Increasing population movements also mean that less common <b>tattoos</b> may be encountered during forensic evaluations. Roger W. Byar...|$|R
