[...] "Your uncle's {{the same kind}} of a man as I am, and one can see you have been up against it since you came to this country. That's one of the best <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>happen</b> to any young man. I guess it's not our fault we don't like all the young men they send us out from the Old Country." [...] He glanced down at his cigar. [...] "Well, I've pretty well smoked this thing out. It's the kind of cigar I was raised on, but I'm not allowed to use that kind {{anywhere}} in my house." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{right people}} did come: Mrs. Denton being a personage that a landed gentry, {{rendered}} jumpy by the perpetual explosion {{of new ideas}} under their very feet, and casting about eagerly for friends, {{could not afford to}} snub. A kindly, simple folk, quite intelligent, some of them, as Phillips had surmised. Mrs. Denton made no mystery of why she had invited them. Why should all questions be left to the politicians and the journalists? Why should not the people interested take a hand; meet and talk over these little matters with quiet voices and attentive ears, amid surroundings where the unwritten law would restrain ladies and gentlemen from addressing other ladies and gentlemen as blood-suckers or anarchists, as grinders of the faces of the poor or as oily-tongued rogues; arguments not really conducive to mutual understanding and the bridging over of differences. The latest Russian dancer, the last new musical revue, the marvellous <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>happen</b> at golf, the curious hands that one picks up at bridge, the eternal fox, the sacred bird! Excellent material for nine-tenths of our conversation. But the remaining tenth? Would it be such excruciatingly bad form for us to be intelligent, occasionally; say, on one or two Fridays during the season? Mrs. Denton wrapped it up tactfully; but that was her daring suggestion.|$|E

5000|$|Richert's {{attitude}} to the War {{was clear from}} the outset: ... I thought straight away that the most likely <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>happen</b> to you in a war is that you will be shot dead. That was a really unpleasant prospect. In addition, I was worried about my relatives and my home, because they were near the border and therefore at risk of being destroyed.|$|R
5000|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times {{gave the}} film an {{unfavorable}} review, stating {{that there were}} [...] "too many characters, not enough plot, and a disconnect between the two stars' acting styles".

50|$|Solar minima and maxima {{are the two}} {{extremes}} of the sun's 11-year activity cycle. At a maximum, the sun is peppered with sunspots, solar flares erupt, and the sun hurls billion-ton clouds of electrified gas into space. It's {{a good time for}} sky watchers who enjoy auroras, but not so good for astronauts who have to be wary of radiation storms. Power outages, satellite malfunction and communication disruptions, and GPS receiver malfunctions {{are just a few of}} the <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>happen</b> during a solar maximum.|$|E

A mopoke {{in the forest}} warns Napoleon of terrible <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>happen</b> to pets in the wild, but Napoleon ignores him as well and {{continues}} on his way. He discovers a large tree used by a psychotic cat as a home. The cat spots Napoleon and, thinking he is a mouse, chases him. Napoleon escapes when the mopoke pushes the cat into a pond. The mopoke then warns Napoleon that the cat will not rest until he is dead. As Napoleon runs off, the cat pulls herself from the pond angrily swearing revenge.|$|E
5000|$|The Vultures critics {{praised the}} direction, script, editing, score, visual style, and performances, {{particularly}} from Pike, Affleck, Tyler Perry, Carrie Coon, and Missi Pyle. Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times wrote: [...] "Superbly cast {{from the two}} at the top to the smallest speaking parts, impeccably directed by Fincher and crafted by his regular team to {{within an inch of}} its life, Gone Girl shows the remarkable <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>happen</b> when filmmaker and material are this well matched." [...] The Economist called the film a [...] "brilliantly glacial adaptation... This may not be the perfect film—but it is a perfect adaptation".|$|E
5000|$|James Dean: According to James Dean biographer W. Bast, [...] "Proud of this accomplishment, Dean {{referred}} to the studio in a 1952 letter, when he was 21 years old, to his family as 'The greatest school of the theater. It houses great people like Marlon Brando, Julie Harris, Arthur Kennedy, Mildred Dunnock ... Very few get into it.... It's the best <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>happen</b> to an actor.

It is the best <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>happen</b> to an actor. I {{am one of the}} youngest to belong."

5000|$|Facing up to {{four years}} in prison, Manning pleaded no contest in September 2006 to felony assault in {{exchange}} for another probation deal. Later, Manning proclaimed his innocence. He acknowledged having words with the victim then pushing him in the head—but after that, according to him, his former UCLA teammates did the damage. [...] "Yeah, I did it" [...] explained Manning (AP report). [...] "If I don't plea to this I {{have to go through}} trial. We're in season now. Then I'd have {{to put it in the}} hands of a jury. There are tons of <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>happen</b> with a jury... I just can't risk that." ...|$|E
50|$|A {{person may}} fall {{overboard}} {{for any number}} reasons: {{they might have been}} struck by one of the ship's booms, they may have lost their footing on a slippery deck or while climbing the ship's ratlines, they may have deliberately jumped overboard in a suicide attempt, or any number of other reasons. Falling overboard {{is one of the most}} dangerous and life-threatening <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>happen</b> at sea. This is especially so if falling from a large vessel that is slow to maneuver, or from a short-handed (i.e., undermanned, lacking sufficient crew) smaller boat. When single-handed and using self-steering gear, or when taking place at night or in stormy conditions, the situation is usually fatal.|$|E
5000|$|Like Mastodon's {{previous}} studio work Leviathan, Blood Mountain is {{a concept}} album. According to bassist Troy Sanders, [...] "It's about climbing up a mountain and the different <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>happen</b> to you when you're stranded on a mountain, in the woods, and you're lost. You're starving, hallucinating, running into strange creatures. You're being hunted. It's about that whole struggle." [...] Guitarist Bill Kelliher considers this album to represent the earth element. At the time, bassist Troy Sanders called it [...] "sonically the best album we have done." [...] The band's emphasis on clean, melodic vocals instead of the harsher vocals that the band used on their early work continues to grow on this album.|$|E
5000|$|In 1999, Vinnie was {{diagnosed}} with testicular cancer. Vinnie is devastated by the diagnosis and is left terrified about his future. Kwanten told Jason Herbison of Inside Soap that the illness is probably the biggest <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>happen</b> to the male ego {{and that it would}} obviously affect Vinnie badly as he has a very big ego. The actor added [...] "He is proud of his manhood and he thinks he's God's gift, so this is going to cut him down to size, so to speak." ...|$|R
5000|$|For almost 10 years, I've {{been going}} toe to toe {{with these people}} at Fort Meade. The success of this company RSA is the worst <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>happen</b> to them. To them, we're the real enemy, we're the real target. We have the system that they're most afraid of. If the U.S. adopted RSA as a standard, {{you would have a}} truly international, interoperable, unbreakable, easy-to-use {{encryption}} technology.

5000|$|In his review, {{reprinted in}} In Search of Wonder, Damon Knight faulted the high-concept format: [...] "The trouble is that, {{no matter how}} {{interesting}} the background may be, there’s probably at most only one dramatic way of using it in a story, and when you toss it up for grabs the best <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>happen</b> is <b>that</b> {{one out of three}} writers will use it effectively. The trouble is, further, that shoehorning the postulated background into three different stories does not unify them but makes them mutually contradictory." ...|$|R
5000|$|Castellari later noted {{his work}} with Nero, stating [...] "I think that to have an actor like Franco Nero {{is one of the}} best <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>happen</b> to a {{director}}...if it had been possible, I would have made all my films with him" [...] Nero would work with Casterllari on the Western Keoma which was only a mild success in Italy on its release, but would later be praised as one of Castellari's best films. Casterllari created further poliziotteschi films in the late 1970s as well as the war film The Inglorious Bastards. Castellari was offered to direct the film Zombi 2, but turned it down as he didn't feel he would be the right director for a horror film.|$|E
5000|$|In {{portfolio}} theory, {{risks of}} price changes {{due to the}} unique circumstances of a specific security, {{as opposed to the}} overall market, are called [...] "idiosyncratic risks". This specific risk, also called unsystematic, can be nulled out of a portfolio through diversification. Pooling multiple securities means the specific risks cancel out. In complete markets, there is no compensation for idiosyncratic risk—that is, a security's idiosyncratic risk does not matter for its price. For instance, in a complete market in which the capital asset pricing model holds, the price of a security is determined by the amount of systematic risk in its returns. Net income received, or losses suffered, by a landlord from renting of one or two properties is subject to idiosyncratic risk due to the numerous <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>happen</b> to real property and variable behavior of tenants.|$|E
5000|$|Ebner won {{his first}} Super Bowl ring when the Patriots won Super Bowl XLIX after the 2014 season. He played 48 percent of special teams snaps, making 11 tackles (second on the team), while missing four games with a broken thumb during the 2014 season. [...] Coach Bill Belichick said: [...] His {{development}} has really been outstanding. I would probably put him in the, not the all-time top, but maybe in the top-five percent all time of players that I’ve coached, from where they were in college to how they grew in the NFL. He has adapted {{in a relatively short}} amount of time to the knowledge of our defense, to the understanding of opponents’ offenses, to instinctiveness and reading and recognition at a position that he plays {{right in the middle of}} the field, which is among the most difficult - inside linebacker and safety - where the number of <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>happen</b> is the greatest.|$|E
5000|$|Former student Elia Kazan {{directed}} James Dean in East of Eden (1955), {{for which}} Kazan and Dean were nominated for Academy Awards. As a student, Dean wrote that Actors Studio was [...] "the greatest {{school of the}} theater and the best <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>happen</b> to an actor". Playwright Tennessee Williams, writer of A Streetcar Named Desire, said of Strasberg's actors, [...] "They act from the inside out. They communicate emotions they really feel. They {{give you a sense}} of life." [...] Directors such as Sidney Lumet, a former student, have intentionally used actors skilled in Strasberg's [...] "method".|$|R
5000|$|The {{immigration}} reform that Fox sought included a guest worker plan. Fox said, [...] "The best <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>happen</b> to both our countries {{is to have}} an orderly flow, a controlled flow, of migration to the United States". This reform was supported by President Bush and approved by the U.S. Senate, however, the bill was rejected by the House of Representatives. According to the Washington Post, the hopes were complicated by the recent approval of the SBI (Secure Border Initiative), a bill that includes building a 700 mi triple fence between the U.S. and Mexico.|$|R
5000|$|During {{an episode}} of the reality show The Surreal Life, Dickinson {{revealed}} in-depth information about the emotional abuse she endured {{as a child and}} teenager. She stated to her cast mates, [...] "My father was a pedophile. He was a dark, angry guy. Being forced to have a pedophile for a father is probably the most horrible <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>happen</b> to a child, bar none." [...] She said, [...] "I survived a monster... 16 years I was forced to keep the secret... If I ever exposed my pedophile father, I would've been murdered. So you know what he did instead? He beat me on a daily basis." ...|$|R
