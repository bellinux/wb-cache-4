5|$|Occurring {{in spring}} (August to October), {{the bright red}} or orange-red inflorescences are {{terminal}} and well displayed, and consist of anywhere from 10 to 52 individual flowers split into smaller groups of 2 to 20 flowers, arranged in a corymb. The flowers sit atop stalks (known as pedicels) up to 3.5cm (1.6in) in length, which arise in pairs off main horizontal stalks within the inflorescence. Each flower consists of a tubular perianth up to 4cm (1.8in) long, which partly splits along one side at anthesis to release the thick style. The stigma is contained within a slanting disc-like structure {{at the tip of}} the style. The tubular perianth splits into four segments at its tip, and the anther lies in the concave parts within each of these segments. The pedicel and the outer surface of the perianth are pubescent (covered in short fine fur). Flowers are followed by woody rectangular seed pods <b>that</b> <b>sit</b> on long stalks, and are 7–10cm (2.8–4in) long. Each pod contains 8 to 10seeds, and is ripe in February and March. Each seed is separated from the others by a membranous separator, and has a long rectangular wing, which is much longer than the seed itself. The seedlings have obovate cotyledons that are 0.8–1cm (0.3–0.4in) wide by 1cm (0.4in) long.|$|E

25|$|There {{are other}} avenues of {{alternative}} {{learning in the}} Philippines such as the Radio-Based Instruction (RBI) Program. This is designed to give the lectures through a radio transmission {{making it easier for}} people to access wherever they are.

25|$|The telescope's primary {{reflecting}} mirrors are {{a pair of}} Gregorian 1.4m × 1.6m dishes (facing opposite directions), {{that focus}} the signal onto a pair of 0.9m × 1.0m secondary reflecting mirrors. They are shaped for optimal performance: a carbon fibre shell upon a Korex core, thinly-coated with aluminium and silicon oxide. The secondary reflectors transmit the signals to the corrugated feedhorns <b>that</b> <b>sit</b> on a focal plane array box beneath the primary reflectors.|$|E
25|$|Supra-aural {{headphones}} or on-ear headphones have pads {{that press}} against the ears, rather than around them. They were commonly bundled with personal stereos during the 1980s. This type of headphone generally {{tends to be}} smaller and lighter than circumaural headphones, resulting in less attenuation of outside noise. Supra-aural headphones {{can also lead to}} discomfort due to the pressure on the ear as compared to circumaural headphones <b>that</b> <b>sit</b> around the ear. Comfort may vary due to the earcup material.|$|E

25|$|Peseros are {{typically}} half-length passenger buses (known as microbús) <b>that</b> <b>sit</b> 22 passengers {{and stand up}} to 28. , the approximately 28,000 peseros carried up to 60 percent of the city's passengers. In August 2016, Mayor Mancera announced that new pesero vehicle and concessions would be eliminated completely unless they were ecologically friendly vehicles, and in October 2011 the city's Secretary of Mobility Héctor Serrano states {{that by the end}} of the current administration (2018) there would no longer by any peseros/microbuses circulating at all, and that new full-sized buses would take over the routes.|$|E
25|$|A {{combination}} squat/Western toilet also exists, where a seat can be flipped {{down over}} a squat toilet, and the toilet {{can be used}} essentially {{the same way as}} the Western style. This hybrid seems to be common only in rural areas for the benefit of resident foreigners. Adapters <b>that</b> <b>sit</b> on top of the Japanese toilet to convert it to a functional sit-down toilet are much more common. There are also permanently installed extensions available to convert a squat toilet into a Western-style washlet. Inversely, there also exists a conversion platform available, that allows someone who prefers a squat toilet to raise himself up to the level of a Western toilet.|$|E
25|$|Hydrogen sulfide– Often {{produced}} by yeast during fermentation {{because of a}} nitrogen deficiency in the must. This {{can be done by}} a reduction of sulfates or sulfites available in the must or by the decomposition of dead yeast cells by other yeast that releases sulfur-containing amino acids that are further broken down by the yeast. The latter often happens with wines <b>that</b> <b>sit</b> in contact with their lees {{for long periods of time}} between rackings. In the presence of alcohol, hydrogen sulfide can react with ethanol to form ethyl mercaptans and disulfides that contribute to off aromas and wine faults. Some commercial yeast strains, such as Montrachet 522 are known to produce higher levels of hydrogen sulfides than other strains, particularly if the must has some nutrient deficiencies.|$|E

25|$|Proteins {{that are}} {{destined for the}} plasma {{membrane}} or export to the extracellular environment in eukaryotic cells are translated on ribosomes <b>that</b> <b>sit</b> on the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER). Most proteins are co-translationally transported into the ER (i.e., while the ribosome is translating the mRNA code into a polypeptide, the polypeptide is simultaneously inserted via the translocon pore into the ER). The ER provides an environment that helps nascent polypeptides fold into and become functional or partially functional proteins. The ER provides an oxidizing environment (for formation of disulfide bonds) and the necessary chaperones (folding assisting agents that {{are not part of}} the final protein). Numerous exported proteins form disulfide bonds—covalent bonds that stabilize the protein structure in harsh extracellular environments. A classic example are the disulfide-linked heavy and light chain polypeptides of antibodies secreted by B-cells of the immune system.|$|E
25|$|Fast-flying pucks are {{potentially}} dangerous to players and spectators. Puck-related injuries at hockey games are not uncommon. This {{led to the}} evolution of various types of protective gear for players, most notably the goaltender mask. The most serious incident involving a spectator took place on March 18, 2002, when a 13-year-old girl, Brittanie Cecil, died two days after being struck on the head by a hockey puck deflected into the crowd at a NHL game between the Calgary Flames and Columbus Blue Jackets in Columbus. This is the only known incident of this type to have occurred {{in the history of the}} league. Partly as a result of this event, the glass or plexiglass panels <b>that</b> <b>sit</b> atop the boards of hockey rinks to protect spectators have been supplemented with mesh nets that extend above the upper edge of the glass.|$|E
25|$|The stem divides into ten or more branches, each {{of which}} is topped by a {{compound}} spiny ovoid inflorescence of 4–8cm in diameter, which may be covered in dense arachnoid hairs. This inflorescence is unusual for members of the Asteraceae family, as each true flowerhead is so far reduced as to only contain one floret, which is surrounded by its own involucre. Five to seven of these monofloral flowerheads combine into secondary flowerheads, each subtended by a spiny bract hardly or substantially longer than the secondary flowerheads, with only the centre floret developing a cypsela, and the surrounding ones only producing pollen. These secondary flowerheads later break free from the globose assembly of flowerheads <b>that</b> <b>sit</b> on the end of each branch of the stem during the tumbleweed-stage. Remarkable for a member of the Cichorieae tribe are also the disk florets, a trait that is further only present in Warionia saharae.|$|E

25|$|The {{basement}} {{is thought}} to be Older North American basement, especially in the North, and a number of different accreted terranes, which are mostly covered by Cenozoic volcanism. The northern extent of the Sierra Madre is the Cortés Terrane, although the northern extreme of this contains {{a small portion of the}} Carborca Terrane. Some of the northern end may also be underlain by a Precambrian basement placed around the same time as the Grenville Orogeny. Some of this area has a series of Paleozoic sedimentary sequences from a deep marine environment underlying it, which considered by some to be part of the Cotes Terrane and by others to be transported. In some areas distinct sedimentary rocks can be identified by shallow-water Silurian and Mississippian sedimentary rocks underlying deep-water Pennsylvanian and Permian, which are divided by Mississippian rhyolite. The Permian clastics contain some detrital rock <b>that</b> <b>sit</b> alongside low-grade metamorphosed sedimentary and volcanic rocks with serpentinite.|$|E
25|$|For {{years it}} has been a United States Coast Guard Academy {{tradition}} for fourth-class cadets (freshman) to hide the chain links <b>that</b> <b>sit</b> outside the cadet library, also known as Waesche Hall. The chain links are historic: they were used during the Revolutionary War to prevent ships from transiting up the Hudson River and attacking West Point. When Benedict Arnold betrayed the United States, the chain links were one of the secrets that he revealed to the British. The family that originally forged the chain donated the links to the United States Coast Guard Academy. Since the donation, the fourth class is challenged each year at the annual homecoming football game to outwit the second class (juniors) and keep the chain hidden until half-time. If the fourth class is successful in hiding the links {{until the end of the}} second quarter, it is granted some sort of reward such as carry-on (this allows the fourth class to have privileges of the upper upperclassman for a day).|$|E
25|$|Skiers in this {{classification}} {{compete with}} two skis and two ski poles in both para-Alpine and para-Nordic skiing. During training, skiers may use prosthesis, cants, wedges, ski-bras, outriggers or short skis. For skiers using a prosthesis, a special skiing prosthesis is used {{and they may}} also require the user of outriggers. The nature of their disability will dictate the type of equipment required. Ski bras are devices clamped to the tips of skis, which result in the skis being attached to each other. Outriggers are forearm crutches with a miniature ski on a rocker at the base. Cants are wedges <b>that</b> <b>sit</b> under the binding that are intended to more evenly distribute weight. They are customised for {{the specific needs of}} the skier. The ski boot for below the knee amputees often has the prosthetic built into it, though for all competitors in this class, FIS rules for para-Alpine ski boots and binding heights are modified for this class from rules applied to able bodied competitor's equipment. In the Biathlon, athletes with amputations can use a rifle support while shooting.|$|E
