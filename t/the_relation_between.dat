5|$|Over time, {{emphasis}} {{in studies of}} leisure has shifted from the work-leisure relation, particularly in well-researched majorities, to study of minorities and <b>the</b> <b>relation</b> <b>between</b> leisure and culture. Marshall Gordon noted {{that there are two}} approaches in the study of leisure: formal and historical-theoretical. The formal approach focuses on empirical questions, such as the shifting of leisure patterns over an individual's life cycle, <b>the</b> <b>relation</b> <b>between</b> leisure and work, and specific forms of leisure (such as the sociology of sport). The historical-theoretical approach studies <b>the</b> <b>relation</b> <b>between</b> leisure and social change, often from structural-functionalist and neo-Marxist perspectives. Sheila Scraton provided a different analysis, comparing North American and British studies. The British approaches focus on input from pluralism, critical Marxism, and feminism; the American approaches concentrate on the social-psychological tradition.|$|E

5|$|Jerry Fodor, Putnam, {{and others}} noted that, along with being an {{effective}} argument against type-identity theories, multiple realizability implies that any low-level explanation of higher-level mental phenomena is insufficiently abstract and general.

In fact, there are many functional kinds, such as mousetraps, software and bookshelves, which are multiply realized at the physical level.|$|E

The article identifies four major frameworks that analyse finance: orthodox, drawing on Adam Smith; political economy, drawing on Marx; heterodox, drawing on Keynes and Minsky; and societal, drawing on Polanyi. These frameworks are critically analysed along five dimensions: the conceptualization of finance; <b>the</b> <b>relations</b> <b>between</b> finance and <b>the</b> economy; <b>the</b> <b>relations</b> <b>between</b> finance and <b>the</b> state; <b>the</b> <b>relations</b> <b>between</b> finance and society; {{and the nature of the}} social system.
