5|$|Cosell:... but (the game)'s {{suddenly}} {{been placed}} in total perspective for us; I'll finish this, they're in the hurry-up offense.Gifford: Third down, four. (Chuck) Foreman... it'll be fourth down. (Matt) Cavanaugh will let it run down for one final attempt, he'll let the seconds tick off to give Miami no opportunity whatsoever. (Whistle blows.) Timeout is called with three seconds remaining, John Smith is on the line. And I don't care what's on the line, Howard, {{you have got to}} say what we know in the booth.Cosell: Yes, we have to say it. Remember this is just a football game, no matter who wins or loses. An unspeakable tragedy confirmed <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>by</b> ABC News in New York City: John Lennon, outside of his apartment building on the West Side of New York City, the most famous perhaps, of all of the Beatles, shot twice in the back, rushed to Roosevelt Hospital, dead on arrival. Hard {{to go back to the}} game after that newsflash, which, in duty bound, we have to take. Frank?Gifford: (after a pause) Indeed, it is.|$|E
5|$|The most {{detailed}} account of this period is handed down <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>by</b> Tacitus, whose Annals dedicate the first six books entirely to the reign of Tiberius. Tacitus was a Roman senator, born {{during the reign of}} Nero in 56 AD, and consul suffect in AD 97. His text is largely based on the Acta Senatus (the minutes of the session of the Senate) and the Acta Diurna (a collection of the acts of the government and news of the court and capital), as well as speeches by Tiberius himself, and the histories of contemporaries such as Marcus Cluvius Rufus, Fabius Rusticus and Pliny the Elder (all of which are lost).|$|E
25|$|Little {{is known}} about pre-Christian Armenian {{literature}}. Many literature pieces known to us were saved and then presented <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>by</b> Moses of Chorene. This is a pagan Armenian song, telling about the birth of Vahagn.|$|E

25|$|Xiao: Your country {{arose in}} Silla {{territory}}. Koguryŏ territory {{is in our}} possession. But you have encroached on it.

If you relinquish land to us and establish a tributary relationship, {{everything will be all}} right.|$|E
25|$|This is {{an opera}} for {{children}} because {{it tries to}} recapture my own childhood. You see, when I was a child I lived in Italy, and in Italy we have no Santa Claus. I suppose that Santa Claus is much too busy with American children {{to be able to}} handle Italian children as well. Our gifts were brought <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>by</b> the Three Kings, instead.|$|E

25|$|The {{surgical}} {{teachings of}} Hanaoka were also preserved {{in a series}} of eight handwritten books by unnamed pupils, but known <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>by</b> the following titles: Shoka shinsho, Shoka sagen, Kinso yojutsu, Kinso kuju, Geka chakuyo, Choso benmei, Nyuiganben, and Koho benran. No dates are known for any of these writings. Since Hanaoka himself made only manuscript copies and none were ever published, it is doubtful if many copies of his surgical writings are now extant.|$|E

25|$|The {{political}} career of Vespasian included {{the offices of}} quaestor, aedile and praetor, and culminated with a consulship in 51, the year Domitian was born. As a military commander, he gained early renown by participating in the Roman invasion of Britain in 43. What little is known of Titus's early life has been handed down <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>by</b> Suetonius, who records that he was brought up at the imperial court {{in the company of}} Britannicus, the son of emperor Claudius, who would be murdered by Nero in 55.|$|E

25|$|Next to {{the study}} of the Scriptures which I earnestly inculcate, I exhort my pupils to peruse Calvin’s Commentaries, which I extol in loftier terms than Helmich himself (a Dutch divine, 15511608); for I affirm that he excels beyond {{comparison}} in the interpretation of Scripture, and that his commentaries ought to be more highly valued than all that is handed down <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>by</b> the library of the fathers; so that I acknowledge him to have possessed above most others, or rather above all other men, what may be called an eminent spirit of prophecy. His Institutes ought to be studied after the (Heidelberg) Catechism, as containing a fuller explanation, but with discrimination, like the writings of all men.|$|E
25|$|The 'Man on the throne' in {{the vision}} of Ezekiel descriptively {{represents}} God, who is controlling everything {{that goes on in}} the world, and how all of the archetypes He set up should interact. The 'Man on the throne', however, drives when the four angels connect their wings. This means that God will not be revealed <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>by</b> us looking at all four elements (for instance) as separate and independent entities. However, when one looks at the way that earth, wind, fire and water (for instance) which all oppose each other are able to work together and coexist in complete harmony in the world, this shows that there is really a higher power (God) telling these elements how to act.|$|E
25|$|Schelling {{held that}} the {{divisions}} imposed on nature, by our ordinary perception and thought, do not have absolute validity. They should be interpreted as {{the outcome of the}} single formative energy which is the soul or inner aspect of nature. In other words he was a proponent of a variety of organicism. The dynamic series of stages in nature, the forms in which the ideal structure of nature is realized, are matter, as the equilibrium of the fundamental expansive and contractive forces; light, with its subordinate processes (magnetism, electricity, and chemical action); organism, with its component phases of reproduction, irritability and sensibility. The continual change presented <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>by</b> experience, taken together with the thought of unity in productive force of nature, leads to the conception of the duality through which nature expresses itself in its varied products.|$|E

500|$|The {{pioneers of}} the genre Skyclad avoided fantasy lyrics because [...] "there was already enough fantasy in the world, told <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>by</b> our {{politicians}} every day." [...] Nonetheless, other folk metal bands {{have been known to}} feature fantasy themes in their lyrics including Ensiferum, Midnattsol and Cruachan. For Elvenking, fantasy themes are used [...] "as a metaphor to cover deeper meanings." [...] Similarly, the fantasy themes in Turisas belie the coverage of issues [...] "that are deeper and have greater significance." ...|$|E
500|$|Recording for {{the album}} began in 2008, {{less than a}} year after the release of Minutes to Midnight (2007). As with Minutes to Midnight, Shinoda and Rick Rubin {{produced}} the album. Primary recording sessions for A Thousand Suns took place at NRG Recording Studios in North Hollywood, Los Angeles, California. In November 2008, lead singer Chester Bennington said the new record was a concept album; he said it [...] "sound a little daunting to me, so, I think my confidence level will drop, but when it was presented <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>by</b> this friend of ours, we liked the idea. It was an inspiring idea, and it was something we could relate a lot of the things we like to write about to." ...|$|E
500|$|Huey P. Newton, devoting {{an entire}} issue of The Black Panther to the film's revolutionary implications, celebrated and welcomed {{the film as}} [...] "the first truly revolutionary Black film made [...] {{presented}} <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>by</b> a Black man." [...] Newton wrote that Sweetback [...] "presents the need for unity among all members and institutions within the community of victims," [...] contending that this {{is evidenced by the}} opening credits which state the film stars [...] "The Black Community," [...] a collective protagonist engaged in various acts of community solidarity that aid Sweetback in escaping. Newton further argued that [...] "the film demonstrates the importance of unity and love between Black men and women," [...] as demonstrated [...] "in the scene where the woman makes love to the young boy but in fact baptizes him into his true manhood." [...] The film became required viewing for members of Black Panther Party.|$|E
