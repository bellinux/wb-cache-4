Rarely, M. pneumoniae pneumonia results in death due to lesions and ulceration of the epithelial lining, pulmonary edema, and bronchiolitis obliterans.

30|$|In this study, Aspergillus spp. {{was found}} to be the most common {{pathogenic}} species of IFT (19 patients [61.3 %]), followed by Mucorales (8 patients [25.8 %]). Candida spp. was the causative pathogen of IFT in two patients (6.5 %). A further two patients were infected by undifferentiated mold (Table  2). The galactomannan antigen levels were evaluated in 16 of the 19 patients with Aspergillus <b>tracheobronchitis</b> and in 4 of the 12 patients with non-Aspergillus-related fungal <b>tracheobronchitis.</b> In patients with Aspergillus <b>tracheobronchitis,</b> the galactomannan antigen levels in the serum and BAL were 3.44  ±  2.8 and 4.87  ±  2.6, respectively.

The two survivors were infected by Aspergillus spp. and undifferentiated mold. The mortality rate did not differ among patients with IFT caused by different fungal species. Only nine patients (29 %) had positive fungal culture results for lower respiratory tract specimens before bronchoscopy. Six patients (19.4 %) had negative fungal culture results for BAL fluid after bronchoscopy. They were diagnosed through histopathology of bronchial biopsy specimens.|$|E

40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: Ventilator-associated <b>tracheobronchitis</b> {{has been}} {{suggested}} as an intermediate process between tracheobronchial colonisation and ventilator-associated pneumonia in patients receiving mechanical ventilation. We aimed to establish the incidence and effect of ventilator-associated <b>tracheobronchitis</b> in a large, international patient cohort. METHODS: We did a multicentre, prospective, observational study in 114 intensive care units (ICU) in Spain, France, Portugal, Brazil, Argentina, Ecuador, Bolivia, and Colombia over a preplanned time of 10 months. All patients older than 18 years admitted to an ICU who received invasive mechanical ventilation for more than 48 h were eligible. We prospectively obtained data for incidence of ventilator-associated lower respiratory tract infections, defined as ventilator-associated <b>tracheobronchitis</b> or ventilator-associated pneumonia. We grouped patients {{according to the presence}} or absence of such infections, and obtained data for the effect of appropriate antibiotics on progression of <b>tracheobronchitis</b> to pneumonia. Patients were followed up until death or discharge from hospital. To account for centre effects with a binary outcome, we fitted a generalised estimating equation model with a logit link, exchangeable correlation structure, and non-robust standard errors.

40|$|<b>Tracheobronchitis</b> is an {{uncommon}} manifestation of infection due to Aspergillus species, occur-ring in < 7 % {{of cases of}} pulmonary aspergillosis. At least 58 cases of invasive aspergillus tracheo-bronchitis have been described since 1962. We describe four patients with AIDS, {{all of whom were}} severely immunocompromised, who had ulcerative <b>tracheobronchitis</b> due to Aspergillus species demonstrated histologically. Three patients had received corticosteroids or were neutro-penic at presentation. At bronchoscopy, three patients had some degree of diffuse tracheobron-chitis, multiple ulcerative or "plaque-like " inflammatory lesions, and occasionally nodules in-volving the mainstem and segmental bronchi. The remaining patient had a single deep ulceration of the proximal trachea. Aspergillus was isolated from biopsy specimens from all four patients. There were varied degrees of invasion of the mucosa, submucosa, and cartilage on histological examination in three patients, one of whom had evidence of disseminated aspergillosis.

30|$|Invasive fungal <b>tracheobronchitis</b> (IFT) {{is a rare}} but severe form of {{pulmonary}} {{fungal infection}} that has been increasingly observed in critically ill patients [2, 10].

The mortality rate of IFT caused by different fungi varies from 20 to 80 % [11, 13 – 16]. Patients with Aspergillus <b>tracheobronchitis</b> who have developed acute respiratory failure exhibit substantially poorer outcomes than those without respiratory distress do (mortality rate 69.2 – 93.8 vs. 25 – 32.8 %) [11, 15, 16].

40|$|Abstract Background Neutrophils sequestered {{in lower}} {{respiratory}} tract secretions in the inflamed lung may undergo apoptosis and/or necrosis and release toxic cellular contents that can injure airways or parenchyma. This study examined the viability of neutrophils retrieved from the proximal airways of lung transplant recipients with bacterial <b>tracheobronchitis.</b> Methods Integrity and stability of intracellular proteins in neutrophils from proximal airways and peripheral blood from lung transplant recipients with bacterial <b>tracheobronchitis</b> were analyzed via Western blot analysis and determination of neutrophil viability by morphologic appearance and flow cytometry. Results Neutrophils in tracheobronchial secretions from lung transplant recipients with cystic fibrosis who had normal chest radiographic imaging but bronchoscopic evidence of purulent <b>tracheobronchitis</b> post-transplant were necrotic and associated with degradation of intracellular protein annexin 1. The neutrophil influx was compartmentalized to large airways and not detected in peripheral bronchoalveolar airspaces sampled via bronchoalveolar lavage. Peripheral blood neutrophils from healthy subjects cultured in vitro demonstrated that annexin 1 degradation, particularly to a 33 [*]kDa annexin 1 breakdown product (A 1 -BP), was associated with neutrophil necrosis, but not apoptosis. Although annexin 1 degradation was not specific to neutrophil necrosis, it was a sensitive marker of intracellular protein degradation associated with neutrophil necrosis. Annexin 1 degradation to 33 [*]kDa A 1 -BP was not observed in peripheral blood neutrophils from healthy subjects, but annexin 1 appeared to be degraded in peripheral blood neutrophils of lung transplant recipients despite a normal morphologic appearance of these cells. Conclusions Neutrophils were necrotic from the proximal airways of lung transplant recipients with bacterial <b>tracheobronchitis,</b> and this process may begin when neutrophils {{are still in the}} systemic circulation prior to sequestration in inflamed airways. Annexin 1 degradation to 33 [*]kDa A 1 -BP may be useful as a sensitive marker to detect neutrophil necrosis. </p...|$|E
