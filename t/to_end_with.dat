5|$|Johnston was rested for the {{subsequent}} match against Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge, which was drawn. He returned against Hampshire {{and played a}} major role in Australia's eight-wicket win. The home team were put into bat on a drying pitch by vice-captain Lindsay HassettBradman had rested himself for the match. Johnston bowled for almost the whole innings, sending down 38.4 of 85.4 overs. He took wickets at regular intervals <b>to</b> <b>end</b> <b>with</b> 6/74 as Hampshire were bowled out for 195. Johnston was unbeaten on two as Australia lost 8/47 and collapsed to 117 all out, trailing by 78 runs. It was the first time that the tourists had conceded a first innings lead for the season. In the second innings, Johnston bowled unchanged at his end for the entire innings, providing steady breakthroughs <b>to</b> <b>end</b> <b>with</b> 5/43 as Hampshire were bowled out for 103. This left Australia a target of 182, and they batted fluently in their second innings to win by eight wickets. Johnston ended with match figures of 11/117. He was rested in the innings win over Sussex, in the last fixture before the First Test.|$|E

5|$|The 1959–60 season saw Davidson {{confronted with}} an arduous eight Test {{tour of the}} Indian subcontinent, with three and five Tests against Pakistan and India respectively. Flat and dry pitches unconducive to fast bowling {{combined}} with oppressive heat confronted the players. On the last tour, many of the Australians had fallen ill with food positioning, and Davidson had asked Donald Bradman, the Australian Chairman of Selectors if opting out of the tour was permitted. Bradman turned him down. Davidson was consistent throughout the Pakistan series, taking four wickets {{in each of the}} three Tests, <b>to</b> <b>end</b> <b>with</b> 12 wickets at 24.83. He also batted solidly, with 47 and 39* in the latter two Tests <b>to</b> <b>end</b> <b>with</b> 90runs at 45.00. His contributions helped Australia to a 2–0 series result; it was the first time Pakistan had lost a Test on home soil and the pair of victories were its last in Pakistan for 39years. He had particular success against Imtiaz Ahmed, removing him four times.|$|E
5|$|The century saw Harvey {{retained}} in the side and started a productive {{second half of the}} season. He made 2 and 58 in the next match starting on New Year’s Day, against New South Wales. Harvey then made 84 in the only innings of a drawn match against Victoria, before scoring 111 in an innings win against Western Australia. It {{was the first time in}} over two years that Harvey had played in a victorious Queensland side.

5|$|The tour {{ended with}} two non-first-class matches against Scotland. In the first, Australia scored 236 before Johnston took 6/15 from 12.5 overs. He took {{the last four}} wickets as the home team fell from 6/81 to be all out for 85. Johnston bowled four wicketless overs in the second innings as Australia {{completed}} victory without needing to bat for a second time. In the second match, he signed off on his tour in a low key manner, taking a wicket in each innings <b>to</b> <b>end</b> <b>with</b> a match total of 2/48 as Australia completed another innings triumph.|$|E
5|$|Worcestershire {{elected to}} bat first, and Johnson took 3/52 from 23 overs, the most bowled by any Australian, {{cleaning}} up the lower order as Australia removed the hosts for 233. When Australia batted, Johnson came in at No. 10 and made an unbeaten 12 as Australia declared their innings closed at 8/462. Australia dismissed the hosts for 212 to complete victory by an innings and 17 runs. Johnson took the last three wickets <b>to</b> <b>end</b> <b>with</b> 3/75 from 13.3 overs; {{he was the most}} uneconomical bowler among those who sent down more than 18 deliveries.|$|E
5|$|After World War II, the US Navy {{sought to}} acquire a nuclear strike capability, and the Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Air, Rear Admiral Arthur W. Radford wanted them to operate from {{aircraft}} carriers. There were practical problems with this. Nuclear weapons at that time were bulky and required a large aircraft to carry them. After Operation Crossroads, Radford asked Hayward if the Navy had such an aircraft, and Hayward suggested modifying the Lockheed P2V Neptune for carrier operations using jet-assisted takeoff (JATO) rocket boosters. It was an interim solution, as it a could not carry a Fat Man, but only the smaller Little Boy bomb; {{it could only be}} operated by the large Midway class aircraft carriers, which still had to be modified for the task; and initially had no tailhook, so it was unable to land on a carrier, and a mission would have <b>to</b> <b>end</b> <b>with</b> it either landing at a land base or ditching at sea.|$|E

5|$|After the World Twenty20 {{ended in}} June 2009, Ebsary stayed in England for a {{bilateral}} {{series against the}} hosts, who were the reigning world champions in both ODIs and T20s. She scored 24 not out as Australia upset England in the only T20 by 34 runs. She played {{in all of the}} five ODIs, and after making 23, 38 and 40, her form tapered away in the last two matches, making single-figure scores <b>to</b> <b>end</b> <b>with</b> 112 runs at 22.40. Batting in a variety of positions from No. 5 to 8, she scored quickly at a strike rate of 88.18. In the fourth match, she took 1/16, {{the first time she had}} bowled in 19 international matches, removing Claire Taylor. England won all the matches except the last, which was washed out.|$|E
5|$|After three {{consecutive}} three-day matches, which involved playing in nine {{days out of}} ten, Miller sat out the next match against Surrey at The Oval, which Australia won by an innings. He returned to take seven wickets in the next fixture against Cambridge University. In the first innings, he resumed his battle with John Dewes, whom he had troubled during the Victory Tests in 1945. This time, Dewes put a thick towel under his shirt for protection against an anticipated short-pitched barrage; instead, Miller followed a short ball with a yorker to dismiss him. He then took the last three wickets <b>to</b> <b>end</b> <b>with</b> 5/46 as the hosts were bowled out for 167 in the first innings. Miller was not required to bat as Australia amassed 4/414 declared then took 2/29 as his team completed an innings victory.|$|E
5|$|Although modern fantasy {{may often}} embrace strangeness, the Ice and Fire series is {{generally}} praised {{for what is}} perceived as a sort of medieval realism. Believing that magic should be used moderately in the epic fantasy genre, Martin set out to make the story feel more like historical fiction than contemporary fantasy, with less emphasis on magic and sorcery and more on battles, political intrigue, and the characters. Though the amount of magic has gradually increased throughout the story, the series is still <b>to</b> <b>end</b> <b>with</b> less overt magic than most contemporary fantasies. In Martin's eyes, literary effective magic needs to represent strange and dangerous forces beyond human comprehension, not advanced alien technologies or formulaic spells. As such, the characters understand only the natural aspects of their world, but not the magical elements like the Others.|$|E
