This was done, except that the fifteenth century chancel roof was retained between the new roof and the ceiling.|$|E

5|$|According to Lafcadio Hearn, a {{butterfly}} {{was seen in}} Japan as the personification of a person's soul; whether they be living, dying, or already dead. One Japanese superstition says that if {{a butterfly}} enters your guest room and perches behind the bamboo screen, the person whom you most love is coming to see you. Large numbers of butterflies are viewed as bad omens. When Taira no Masakado was secretly preparing for his famous revolt, there appeared in Kyoto so vast a swarm of butterflies that the people were frightened— <b>thinking</b> <b>the</b> apparition to be a portent of coming evil.|$|E
5|$|American {{historian}} Richard Landes, {{who specializes}} {{in the history of}} apocalypticism and was co-founder and director of the Center for Millennial Studies at Boston University, argues that new and emerging technologies often trigger alarmism among millenarians and even the introduction of Gutenberg's printing press in 1436 caused waves of apocalyptic <b>thinking.</b> <b>The</b> Year 2000 problem, bar codes and Social Security numbers all triggered end-time warnings which either proved to be false or simply were no longer taken seriously once the public became accustomed to these technological changes. Civil libertarians argue that the privatization of surveillance {{and the rise of the}} surveillance-industrial complex in the United States does raise legitimate concerns about the erosion of privacy. However, skeptics of mass surveillance conspiracism caution that such concerns should be disentangled from secular paranoia about Big Brother or religious hysteria about the Antichrist.|$|E

5|$|Discontent with Richard's actions {{manifested}} itself in the summer after he {{took control of the}} country, as a conspiracy emerged to displace him from the throne. The rebels were mostly loyalists to Edward IV, who saw Richard as a usurper. Their plans were coordinated by a Lancastrian, Henry's mother Lady Margaret, who was promoting her son as a candidate for the throne. The highest-ranking conspirator was Buckingham. No chronicles tell of the duke's motive in joining the plot, although historian Charles Ross proposes that Buckingham was trying to distance himself from a king who was becoming increasingly unpopular with the people. Michael Jones and Malcolm Underwood suggest that Margaret deceived Buckingham into <b>thinking</b> <b>the</b> rebels supported him to be king.|$|E

5|$|In {{the summer}} of 479BC the Greeks {{assembled}} a huge (by ancient standards) army and marched out of the Peloponnesus. The Persians retreated to Boeotia and built a fortified camp near Plataea. The Greeks, however, refused {{to be drawn into}} the prime cavalry terrain around the Persian camp, resulting in a stalemate that lasted 11 days. While attempting a retreat after their supply lines were disrupted, the Greek battle line fragmented. <b>Thinking</b> <b>the</b> Greeks in full retreat, Mardonius ordered his forces to pursue them, but the Greeks (particularly the Spartans, Tegeans and Athenians) halted and gave battle, routing the lightly armed Persian infantry and killing Mardonius.|$|E
5|$|Jewish {{philosophy}} {{divides the}} 613 mitzvot into three groups—laws {{that have a}} rational explanation and would probably be enacted by most orderly societies (mishpatim), laws that are understood after being explained but would not be legislated without the Torah's command (edot), and laws {{that do not have}} a rational explanation (chukim). Some Jewish scholars say that kashrut should be categorized as laws {{for which there is no}} particular explanation, since the human mind is not always capable of understanding divine intentions. In this line of <b>thinking,</b> <b>the</b> dietary laws were given as a demonstration of God's authority, and man must obey without asking why. However, Maimonides believed that Jews were permitted to seek out reasons for the laws of the Torah.|$|E

He ordered an inquiry of Manuel, directed by the priest of Oncogate (Quispicanchi), a village close to the mountain. On June 12, 1783, the commission ascended Qullqipunku with Mariano; they found Manuel dressed in white and shining with a bright light. Blinded, they retreated, returning with a larger party. On their second try they reached the boy. But when they touched him, he was transformed into a tayanka bush (Baccharis odorata) with the crucified Christ hanging from it. <b>Thinking</b> <b>the</b> party had harmed his friend, Mariano fell dead on the spot. He was buried under the rock where Manuel had last appeared.|$|E
5|$|Mr. Largo catches Lisa looking {{outside at}} Nelson during a music lesson, {{and as a}} result, she is given detention. After school, she {{continues}} to watch Nelson and develops a crush on the school bully. Lisa tries to let Nelson know how she feels about him by getting Milhouse to pass a love note to him in class. The plan backfires, with Nelson hurting Milhouse, <b>thinking</b> <b>the</b> note came from him. Lisa confesses that she wrote the letter and although Nelson seems indifferent about the matter, he begins visiting her home. Lisa is resolved to turn Nelson from a trouble maker into a sweet, sensitive young man. Later, Lisa and Nelson share a kiss during their date at the Springfield Observatory.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} is outdoor learning. Program leaders believe that the outdoors environment provides a context for learning that is physically demanding and entirely different from that experienced every day at home and in school. The outdoors stimulates new ways of thinking and approaching both task- and group-related problems. As participants learn they can exceed what they perceive to be their physical limits, they find their mental capacity also grows. White Stag uses the physical environment to tire the individual and open their minds to new ways of <b>thinking.</b> <b>The</b> program does nothing indoors that can be done outdoors, and encourages physical fitness through outdoor activities. Using the outdoors avoids the negative association of a standard classroom environment.|$|E

5|$|Rodgers {{had long}} {{wanted to write}} a musical comedy about the cast and crew {{backstage}} at a theatre. After Rodgers and Hammerstein had another hit with The King and I in 1951, Rodgers proposed the backstage project to his partner. Hammerstein was unenthusiastic, <b>thinking</b> <b>the</b> subject matter trivial, but agreed to do the project. The play required complex machinery, designed by Jo Mielziner, so that the audience could view action not only on the stage of the theatre where the show-within-the-show (also named Me and Juliet) takes place, but in the wings and on the light bridge (high above the stage, from which the lighting technicians train spotlights) as well.|$|E
5|$|The North Koreans, in the meantime, {{advanced}} to Hadong and captured the village which was lightly defended {{by a group}} of South Korean police, as no military was available due to manpower shortages. The Koreans, members of the NK 6th Division, set up in roads east of the village and began sending probes and scout parties to the east. The move {{was part of a larger}} coordinated operation by the 6th Division to take Chinju, and then Masan, in hopes of flanking the UN lines at their vulnerable southern limit. <b>Thinking</b> <b>the</b> UN units were disorganized and suffering low morale, NK 6th Division commander General Pang Ho San ordered his forces to aggressively advance to Chinju as quickly as possible.|$|E

He was then shot by snipers concealed in the bush. A battle ensued in which four Congolese soldiers were lost. Three Italians and an estimated 40 Eritrean ascari were killed, with approximately 70 ascari wounded.|$|E
