5|$|Although Ferugliotherium {{teeth are}} much lower-crowned {{than those of}} the Sudamericidae, they share an {{essentially}} similar pattern on the occlusal (chewing) surface of mf1 and mf2, similar incisors, backward jaw movement during chewing, and enamel with small prisms. Ferugliotherium is thought <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> small animal, with a body mass of about 70g (2.5oz), and may have eaten insects and plant material. Its remains have been found in two geological formations of southern Argentina, where {{it is part of a}} mammal fauna that also includes the sudamericid Gondwanatherium and a variety of dryolestoids.|$|E

5|$|Although {{little is}} known about the life and career of Nerva before his {{accession}} as Emperor in 96, he appears <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> highly adaptable diplomat, surviving multiple regime changes and emerging as one of the Flavians' most trusted advisors. His consulship may therefore have been intended to emphasize the stability and status quo of the regime. The revolt had been suppressed and the Empire returned to order.|$|E

5|$|As he {{was unable}} to travel during 1916, Kropotkin found himself in {{frequent}} correspondence with others, including Jean Grave, who visited Kropotkin from France with his wife. Together, they discussed the war and Kropotkin's firm support for it. At Kropotkin's suggestion that he would like <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> combatant were he younger, Grave suggested publishing a document urging anarchists to support the war effort {{on the side of the}} Allied Powers. Initially hesitant, due to his personal inability to sign up for active duty, Kropotkin was eventually persuaded by Grave.|$|E
5|$|As well as {{his service}} as a sheriff, Basset {{also served as a}} royal justice, hearing pleas in Leicestershire in 1129 and 1130.

He was present at the councils held at Northampton in 1131 and at Westminster in 1132. Basset witnessed no royal documents after 1133, when King Henry left England for Normandy for the final time.|$|E
