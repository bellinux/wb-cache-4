In his strongest call yet for a managed approach, Hammond said a comprehensive trade agreement, a <b>transitional</b> <b>deal</b> after the 2019 deadline for the end of talks, and a commitment to keep borders open should form a three-point Brexit plan for Britain. There would be “audible sighs of relief”, he said, if the talks that ended with a business-friendly agreement.|$|E

This article examines {{one of the}} most comprehensive programmes of transitional justice which has been implemented in the Czech Republic since 1990. Based on a survey conducted in 2010, 10 policies are assessed by means of descriptive statistics, and by examining their effect on the perception of justice, truth and reconciliation. Property restitution is viewed as the most successful policy for dealing with the past; it contributes to the positive perception of both justice and truth but it undermines the perception of reconciliation...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{argues that}} an {{organizational}} discourse on consumerism is replacing a prior discourse of dependency. This discourse encourages, and is encouraged by, economic rationales for behavior and {{is marked by}} the collapse of many complex societal roles into the simpler category of 'customer'. Moreover, practices emergent from consumerism and economic rationalism often act as organizational and social defences against anxieties about the uncertainties and changes occurring in a world increasingly dominated by global markets where the customer is 'sovereign'. Six working hypotheses are proposed to explain the operation of these new social defences. Evidence in support of these hypotheses comes from collaborative action research projects in which the author is involved. The argument moves toward a consideration of the new 'consumer-provider pair' which, it is proposed, has become a major signifier within the consumer discourse and which might be considered as a <b>transitional</b> pair in <b>dealing</b> with widespread organizational change...|$|R
40|$|How do <b>transitional</b> democracies <b>deal</b> with {{officials}} who have been tainted by complicity with prior governments? Should they be excluded or should they {{be incorporated into the}} new system? In Lustration and Transitional Justice, Roman David examines major institutional innovations that developed in Central Europe following the collapse of communist regimes. While the Czech Republic approved a lustration (vetting) law based on the traditional method of dismissals, Hungary and Poland devised alternative models that granted their tainted officials a second chance in exchange for truth. David classifies personnel systems as exclusive, inclusive, and reconciliatory; they are based on dismissal, exposure, and confession, respectively, and they represent three major classes of transitional justice. David argues that in addition to their immediate purposes, personnel systems carry symbolic meanings that help explain their origin and shape their effects. In their effort to purify public life, personnel systems send different ideological messages that affect trust in government and the social standing of former adversaries. Exclusive systems may establish trust at the expense of reconciliation, while inclusive and reconciliatory systems may promote both trust and reconciliation. In spite of its importance, the topic of inherited personnel has received only limited attention in research on transitional justice and democratization. Lustration and Transitional Justice is the first attempt to fill this gap. Combining insights from cultural sociology and political psychology with the analysis of original experiments, historical surveys, parliamentary debates, and interviews, the book shows how perceptions of tainted personnel affected the origin of lustration systems and how dismissal, exposure, and confession affected trust in government, reconciliation, and collective memory...|$|R
40|$|Dyad-year data on {{international}} conflict are simultaneously qualitative and serially dependent. Extending Beck, Katz, and Tucker’s (1998) methodological contribution, I propose <b>transitional</b> models that <b>deal</b> {{with these two}} features of the data. These statistical models explicitly deal with the way a dyad’s particular history of peace or conflict structures current outcomes, consistent with important substantive notions in the IR literature such as reputation-building, signalling, alliance reliability, territoriality, and enduring rivalries. That is, I propose statistical models that (a) are easily estimated; (b) resolve long-standing methodological dilemmas, and (c) speak to important theoretical ideas {{in the study of}} international relations. The transitional models I propose generalize beyond the international conflict data analyzed here, to any type of discrete time-series setting. One of the transitional models I propose is a novel methodological contribution in its own right [...] - a dynamic probit model [...] - unifying two hitherto disparate branches of quantitative political methodology (time series and discrete choice). 1 Dyad-year data {{on international}} conflict are widely used in quantitative studies of international relations...|$|R
40|$|Transitional {{justice is}} the study of those {{mechanisms}} employed by communities, states and the international community to deal with a legacy of systematic human rights abuses and authoritarianism in order to promote social reconstruction. There is a well developed transitional justice literature on how states can deal with past violations of civil and political rights, which discusses the value of truth commissions, and international and domestic prosecutions. The transitional justice literature {{on how to deal with}} past violations of property rights, however, is significantly less developed. The goal of this essay is to begin an important conversation about how <b>transitional</b> states can <b>deal</b> with multiple layers of past land dispossession in order to promote social reconstruction. I discuss the strengths and weakness of a state’s three main options: Maintaining the present property status quo, fully or partially returning to a prior status quo, or creating a new property status quo altogether. I argue that a state should decide which option it will choose in the context of a well-informed, inclusive public dialogue rather than through a less time consuming process involving only elites...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the paper is to {{contribute}} to the debate of corporate governance models in European transition economies. The paper consists of four parts. In the introduction, after giving a historic overview of the corporate governance evolution, different understandings of the corporate governance function are presented and the contemporary corporate governance issues are described. The second part deals with governance systems in the (mainly domestically) privatised former state-owned companies in Central European transitional countries, with the main types of companies 2 ̆ 7 ownership structures, relationships between governance and management functions and deficiencies in existing governance systems. The third part is dedicated to the analysis of factors that determine the efficient relationship between the corporate governance and management functions in Central European <b>transitional</b> economies. It <b>deals</b> with the issue of why the German (Continental European) governance model is usually the preferred choice and why the chosen models underperform. In the conclusion, the author offers his suggestions of how the Central European transition countries should improve their corporate governance in the future...|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{proposes a}} reappraisal of {{transitional}} justice through {{the study of}} the nature and function {{of the rule of law}} it conveys. As originally conceived, transitional justice embraces a concept of the rule of law that is sensitive to the conditions of the political transition, in which law is caught in inexorable tensions between the past and the future. Yet, the increasing use of <b>transitional</b> justice to <b>deal</b> with armed conflicts and human rights violations irrespective of any political transition has created a conceptual and normative disorder, which leads to assimilating the use of transitional mechanisms to that of transitional justice. Should transitional justice apply to situations other than those of political transition? In what other transition-like situations is a sui generis concept of the rule of law justified? Can transitional justice mechanisms be used in situations other than political transitions? The author analyzes these questions bearing in mind that an enlarged and unjustified use of transitional justice may render the concept of transitional justice analytically, descriptively, and normatively meaningless to law. The case study of Colombia shows the perverse effects of conceptual vagueness and brings to light the practical impacts that using an enlarged conception of transitional justice has upon the ordinary rule of law.

40|$|In {{the last}} years the {{analysis}} of flow figures {{turned out to be}} essential for labour market research and policy advice. The ongoing debate about how flexible is the German labour market could not been answered just analysing stock figures or turnover rates. Here we follow the useful analytical framework of <b>transitional</b> labour markets <b>dealing</b> centrally with flow figures. By developing a multi-account system (MAS) we go some steps ahead compared to indicators like job and labour turnover rates. First we combine the information of administrative data of the micro level with macro data containing pupils, self employed, retired persons. Embedded in an external framework, which is given by demography, the MAS describes the transition process of the labour market on the regional level and contains all 180 local employment agencies in Germany. The multi-account model thus serves as a basis for strategically aligning each agency with the individual local situation of the labour market by explicitly taking into account the regional specifics. Thus it helps for future strategic decisions of active labour market policy, which has been regionalized increasingly. For estimating the unknown transitions of the data matrix we use a new algorithm the so called ADETON tool, which has the additional merit comparing to other entropy maximizing methods, that constraints can be formulated in a fuzzy way rather than exactly. Further we demonstrate on the basis of three agencies (Ingolstadt, Memmingen, Halle) some practice and numerical examples concerning transitions from vocational training to the following labour market status. We state that the analytical potential of this instrument is not yet exhausted. In any event, it is already clear that the information content of this model by far exceeds that of a system of individual indicators. Details and relations of the regional labour market become apparent which show a high-resolution image of possible obsolete structures or increasing labour market dynamics. The model thus gives clear hints as to the scope and limits of the active labour market policy. ...|$|R
40|$|Writing {{is one way}} of {{communication}} that enables people to communicate with others through a written text. As a way {{of communication}}, writing must be effective; and one requirement of an effective writing is coherence. One way that can make a writing being coherent is by using transitional words that has a function to tie the ideas together. Dealing with the use of transitional words; this study tries analyzing the use of transitional words in five essays written by the students of English department of the state Islamic University of Malang and their contribution in achieving coherence within paragraph and between paragraphs. This study uses descriptive qualitative research because the researcher discussed, analyzed and found the phenomena which occur naturally; it is not controlled or based on laboratory research. In this research, the researcher firstly analyzes transitional words used in those essays and then classified them based on their types. After finding the transitional words used, the researcher analyzes their contribution in making coherence within paragraph or between paragraphs on each essays. The finding of the analysis is then discussed and presented in the form of words and table. After analyzing the data, it is found that there are seven types of transitional words used in the first essay. In the second essay, there are five types of transitional words. Moreover, the analysis on the third essay found that there are six types of transitional words and in the fourth essay, the writer uses five types of transitional words. Finally, the last essay uses five types of <b>transitional</b> words. <b>Dealing</b> with the second problem, it is found that, in the first essay, the transitional words used only contribute the achievement of coherence in the first paragraph. In addition, they do not support the achievement of coherence between paragraphs. In the second essay, the use of transitional word adds the achievement of coherence in the second paragraph only. They also assist coherence achievement of the whole essay. In the third essay, the use of transitional words supports the achievement of coherence in the first paragraph only and do not contribute coherence achievement of the whole essay. Furthermore, in the fourth essay, the use of transitional words contributes the achievement of coherence in the first and fourth paragraph only. Finally, the use of transitional words in the fifth essay only adds the achievement of coherence in the first, fourth, and fifth paragraph. After doing the analysis and finding the answer of the formulated question, the suggestions are made for the next researcher, the writing lecturer and the students. For the next researchers it is expected to do better research than this research, for example by using new theories, and to choose another object for example in opinion column in a newspaper or journal. For the writing lecturers it is expected to give more attention to the appropriate use of transitional words by their students and finally, for the students it is suggested that they should give more attention to the appropriate use of transitional words in their essay...|$|R
