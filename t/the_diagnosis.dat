30|$|Other (systematic) reviews on the {{accuracy}} of DAT SPECT imaging showed somewhat lower sensitivity (79 to 100 %) and specificity (80 to 100 %) [18, 50, 51].

The accuracy of <b>the</b> clinical <b>diagnosis</b> increases with <b>the</b> duration of symptoms [49, 52]. However, most studies and clinical trials use <b>the</b> clinical <b>diagnosis</b> 3 to 36  months after <b>the</b> initial <b>diagnosis</b> as reference standard [53 - 56].

5|$|An {{electroencephalogram}} (EEG) {{can assist}} in showing brain activity suggestive of {{an increased risk of}} seizures.

5|$|As many {{symptoms}} {{of carbon monoxide}} poisoning also occur with many other types of poisonings and infections (such as the flu), <b>the</b> <b>diagnosis</b> is often difficult.

5|$|Decompression {{sickness}} {{should be}} suspected {{if any of}} the symptoms associated with the condition occurs following a drop in pressure, in particular, within 24 hours of diving. In 1995, 95% of all cases reported to Divers Alert Network had shown symptoms within 24 hours. An alternative diagnosis should be suspected if severe symptoms begin more than six hours following decompression without an altitude exposure or if any symptom occurs more than 24 hours after surfacing. <b>The</b> <b>diagnosis</b> is confirmed if the symptoms are relieved by recompression. Although MRI or CT can frequently identify bubbles in DCS, they are not as good at determining <b>the</b> <b>diagnosis</b> as a proper history of the event and description of the symptoms.|$|E
30|$|In this paper, {{a hybrid}} {{intelligent}} diagnosis approach for computer-aided auditory diagnosis, based on neural classifications and fuzzy decision-making systems is suggested. In fact, the double classification is exploited in PFS, for a primary diagnosis, {{to ensure a}} satisfactory reliability. Second, this reliability is reinforced using a confidence parameter AT with <b>the</b> primary <b>diagnosis</b> result, exploited in FFS, in order to generate <b>the</b> final <b>diagnosis</b> giving <b>the</b> appropriate <b>diagnosis</b> with a CI. In effect, a first reliability degree of <b>the</b> suggested computer-aided <b>diagnosis</b> is obtained from the Primary Fuzzy System (PFS) exploiting the redundancy of the two neural classifiers. Then, this reliability degree is reinforced (enhanced) exploiting <b>the</b> obtained <b>diagnosis</b> result associated with a confidence parameter, Auditory Threshold (AT) of patients in the application at hand, in the Final Fuzzy System (FFS) in order to generate <b>the</b> final <b>diagnosis</b> result (<b>the</b> appropriate <b>diagnosis</b> with a confidence index CI). Note that such a confidence index is very desirable in decision support systems (decision help systems), and particularly in biomedicine (e.g., biomedical application at hand, see the example given {{at the end of}} Sect.  5).|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{examine the}} {{relationships}} among different performance scores for each of four diagnostic decision support systems (DDSSs). Design: Intercorrelations among seven performance scores {{on a set of}} 105 cases for each of four DDSSs (DXplain, Iliad, Meditel, QMR) were computed. METHODS: The performance scores for each case reflected: 1) presence or absence of <b>the</b> case <b>diagnosis</b> in <b>the</b> DDSS knowledge base; 2) presence or absence of <b>the</b> correct <b>diagnosis</b> anywhere on <b>the</b> DDSS <b>diagnosis</b> list; 3) presence or absence of <b>the</b> correct <b>diagnosis</b> in <b>the</b> top ten diagnoses; 4) relevance of <b>the</b> DDSS <b>diagnosis</b> list; 5) comprehensiveness of <b>the</b> DDSS <b>diagnosis</b> list; 6) whether the DDSS suggested additional diagnoses to the experts' list; and 7) the length of <b>the</b> DDSS <b>diagnosis</b> list. Results: For all DDSSs, <b>the</b> two Correct <b>Diagnosis</b> scores (top ten and total list) were significantly related: 1) to the presence of <b>the</b> correct <b>diagnosis</b> in <b>the</b> knowledge base; 2) to the Comprehensiveness score; and 3) to each other. There were significant differences among the four DDSSs on the magnitude and/or direction of the relationships between: 1) <b>the</b> two Correct <b>Diagnosis</b> scores; 2) <b>the</b> Relevance and Length scores; and 3) the Relevance and Additional Diagnoses scores. CONCLUSION: The production of a correct diagnosis for a given case is not related to the number of diagnoses suggested by the DDSS and, across different DDSSs, is not consistently related to other measures of performance. These data indicate that multiple measures are needed to fully describe the performance of a DDSS...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{evaluate}} a self-administered questionnaire on hand dermatitis that was developed to identify persons with hand dermatitis in epidemiological studies. A total of 109 nurses were subject to dermatological examination of the hands within 1 month of returning the questionnaire. 2 types of questionnaire diagnoses were made: a 'symptom-based' diagnosis and a 'self-reported diagnosis'. These were compared to <b>the</b> medical <b>diagnosis</b> of hand dermatitis. The prevalence of hand dermatitis in the 12 months before the study, based on <b>the</b> medical <b>diagnosis,</b> was 18. 3 %. The prevalence according to <b>the</b> symptom-based <b>diagnosis</b> and <b>the</b> self-reported <b>diagnosis</b> was 47. 7 % and 17. 4 %, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of <b>the</b> symptom-based <b>diagnosis</b> were 100 % and 64 %, respectively. It is concluded that <b>the</b> symptom-based <b>diagnosis</b> can be used as screening instrument for the detection of cases in large study populations, if followed by dermatological examination of persons with a positive <b>diagnosis.</b> <b>The</b> sensitivity and specificity of <b>the</b> self-reported <b>diagnosis</b> were 65 % and 93 %, respectively. It is concluded that <b>the</b> self-reported <b>diagnosis</b> can be used to obtain a rough estimate of the prevalence, although comparison of prevalence figures between study populations may be distorted due to a difference in reporting of hand dermatitis. The results of the study illustrate the size of the differences in prevalence estimates that may arise as a result of differences in the definition and method of diagnosing hand dermatitis...|$|R
