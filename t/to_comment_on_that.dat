500|$|The first segment, [...] "The Diving Bell and the Butterball", was {{met with}} mixed reactions. Marnell called the parody [...] "wildly unfunny", while Childs was {{critical}} of Homer turning into a paralyzed Spider-Man and stated that it was [...] "simply not very funny." [...] Tim Surette of TV.com was more ambivalent and said: [...] "I found this sketch to be simultaneously awesome and terrible because I have the maturity of a 6-year old and the intelligence of an average man." [...] The reference to the Broadway musical Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark was noticed by the producers of the musical. They [...] reacted by issuing a statement the following day: [...] "Everyone at 'Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark' was extremely flattered by last night’s tribute on 'The Simpsons.' 'The Simpsons' is an iconic American institution, and being part of last night's episode was an honor and dream come true." [...] Coincidentally, the previous aired episode of South Park, [...] "Broadway Bro Down", also had {{a reference to the}} musical, but the spokesperson for the Broadway show did not want <b>to</b> <b>comment</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> episode.|$|E
2500|$|After {{one pass}} {{interference}} penalty against the Red Raider, Tech defensive back Darcel McBath threw his mouthpiece towards the officials. After the game, Texas Tech coach Mike Leach implied {{that there may}} have been mistakes made by the officiating crew. [...] He said, [...] "There were some things that happened in the course of the game, in particular the second half, that were outside of our control that I'm not able <b>to</b> <b>comment</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> were very detrimental to our effort." [...] Leach sent Big Twelve Conference officials a video tape showing 18 calls, no calls, or other rulings that were disputed by Texas Tech. [...] The disputed play-calls include plays accounting for more than half of the penalty yardage assessed against Tech as well the spot of the ball following a [...] fourth down pass on Tech's penultimate drive of the game. [...] The officials said that play came up less than a yard short of the first down marker, giving Texas the ball.|$|E
2500|$|Blur were {{involved}} in a vibrant social scene in London (dubbed [...] "The Scene That Celebrates Itself" [...] by Melody Maker) [...] that focused on a weekly club called Syndrome in Oxford Street; the bands that met up were a mix of music styles, some would be labelled shoegazing, while others would go on to be part of Britpop. The dominant musical force of the period was the grunge invasion from the United States, which filled the void left in the indie scene by The Stone Roses' inactivity. Blur, however, took on an Anglocentric aesthetic with their second album Modern Life Is Rubbish (1993). Their new approach was inspired by a tour of the United States in the spring of 1992. During the tour, frontman Damon Albarn began to resent American culture and found the need <b>to</b> <b>comment</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> culture's influence seeping into Britain. Justine Frischmann, formerly of Suede and leader of Elastica (and at the time in a relationship with Damon Albarn) explained, [...] "Damon and I felt like we were in the thick of it at that point ... it occurred to us that Nirvana were out there, and people were very interested in American music, and there should be some sort of manifesto for the return of Britishness." [...] John Harris wrote in an NME article just prior to the release of Modern Life is Rubbish, [...] " [...] timing has been fortuitously perfect. Why? Because, as with baggies and shoegazers, loud, long-haired Americans have just found themselves condemned to the ignominious corner labeled 'yesterday's thing'". The music press also fixated on what the NME had dubbed the New Wave of New Wave, a term applied to the more punk-derivative acts such as Elastica, S*M*A*S*H and These Animal Men.|$|E

5000|$|Julian MacLaren-Ross enthusiastically {{reviewed}} the novel in the 20 April 1951 issue of The Times Literary Supplement {{when he said}} it was: [...] "more of a thriller than a detective story, though there are plenty of mysteries and two surprises reserved for the closing chapters; one of these is perhaps her best since the unmasking of the criminal in The Seven Dials Mystery". He went on <b>to</b> <b>comment</b> <b>on</b> <b>that,</b> [...] "the easy expertise of the writing is once more a matter for admiration" [...] and concluded that Christie's powers of invention [...] "never fail her".|$|E

50|$|Parabasis: Here {{the first}} parabasis follows a {{conventional}} form (lines 626-701). However, the second parabasis (lines 971-99) is unusual. It {{can be interpreted}} as a conventional symmetrical scene and yet {{it seems to be a}} hybrid parabasis/song without any clear distinction between the sung and declaimed sections. Moreover, the Chorus in those lines seems <b>to</b> <b>comment</b> <b>on</b> action <b>that</b> occurs <b>on</b> stage during its address to the audience and this is unusual for a parabasis. A later passage (lines 1143-73) begins with a valediction to the actors, which typically clears the stage for a parabasis and yet it has the form of a conventional song rather than a parabasis.|$|R
