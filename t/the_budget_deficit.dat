5|$|Going {{into the}} 2010 state elections, the Minnesota {{government}} faced an approximately $5 billion budget shortfall {{in the coming}} 2011–2013 biennium, {{left over from the}} outgoing administration of Republican Governor Tim Pawlenty. The Republican Party claimed that the shortfall was a result of unsustainable increases in spending, and pledged to balance the budget without raising taxes. In the gubernatorial election, former U.S. Senator Mark Dayton campaigned pledging to close <b>the</b> <b>budget</b> <b>deficit</b> by increasing income taxes on the state's highest earners.|$|E
5|$|Lawsuits pending (House v. Price) such {{as whether}} cost-sharing {{subsidies}} must be paid. President Trump threatened not to pay these subsidies in early 2017 and later decided to stop paying them. CBO estimated in September 2017 that discontinuing the payments would add an average of 15-20 percentage points to health insurance costs on the exchanges in 2018 while increasing <b>the</b> <b>budget</b> <b>deficit</b> nearly $200 billion over a decade.|$|E
5|$|Portugal's {{debt was}} in September 2012 {{forecast}} by the Troika to peak at around 124% of GDP in 2014, {{followed by a}} firm downward trajectory after 2014. Previously the Troika had predicted it would peak at 118.5% of GDP in 2013, so the developments {{proved to be a}} bit worse than first anticipated, but the situation was described as fully sustainable and progressing well. As a result, from the slightly worse economic circumstances, the country has been given one more year to reduce <b>the</b> <b>budget</b> <b>deficit</b> to a level below 3% of GDP, moving the target year from 2013 to 2014. <b>The</b> <b>budget</b> <b>deficit</b> for 2012 has been forecast to end at 5%. The recession in the economy is now also projected to last until 2013, with GDP declining 3% in 2012 and 1% in 2013; followed by a return to positive real growth in 2014. Unemployment rate increased to over 17% by end of 2012 but it has since decreased gradually to 10,5% as of November 2016.|$|E

5|$|The {{effective}} {{tax rate}} for any household would be variable due to the fixed monthly tax rebate {{that are used to}} rebate taxes paid on purchases up to the poverty level. The tax would be levied on all U.S. retail sales for personal consumption on new goods and services. Critics argue that the sales tax rate defined in the legislation would not be revenue neutral (that is, it would collect less for the government than the current tax system), and thus would increase <b>the</b> <b>budget</b> <b>deficit,</b> unless government spending were equally reduced.|$|E
5|$|The ACA's major {{provisions}} {{came into}} force in 2014. By 2016, the uninsured {{share of the}} population had roughly halved, with estimates ranging from 20–24 million additional people covered during 2016. The increased coverage was due, roughly equally, to an expansion of Medicaid eligibility and to major changes to individual insurance markets. Both involved new spending, funded {{through a combination of}} new taxes and cuts to Medicare provider rates and Medicare Advantage. Several Congressional Budget Office reports said that overall these provisions reduced <b>the</b> <b>budget</b> <b>deficit,</b> and that repealing the ACA would increase the deficit. The law also enacted a host of delivery system reforms intended to constrain healthcare costs and improve quality. After the law went into effect, increases in overall healthcare spending slowed, including premiums for employer-based insurance plans.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 2000s, Krugman {{repeatedly}} criticized the Bush tax cuts, {{both before and}} after they were enacted. Krugman argued that the tax cuts enlarged <b>the</b> <b>budget</b> <b>deficit</b> without improving the economy, and that they enriched the wealthy – worsening income distribution in the US. Krugman advocated lower interest rates (to promote investment and spending on housing and other durable goods), and increased government spending on infrastructure, military, and unemployment benefits, arguing that these policies would have a larger stimulus effect, and unlike permanent tax cuts, would only temporarily increase <b>the</b> <b>budget</b> <b>deficit.</b> In addition, he was against Bush's proposal to privatize social security.|$|E

40|$|This study re-examines the Ricardian Equivalence theorem (RET) {{by using}} {{advanced}} time series econometric models to investigate updated data of <b>the</b> U. S. <b>budget</b> <b>deficits</b> and real interest rates. We employ a multi-model approach to thoroughly investigate {{the properties of}} two time series, namely the U. S. federal <b>budget</b> <b>deficits</b> (BDEF) and real interest rates (INTRATE) for the study period from 1798 to 2009. It is found that BDEF and INTRATE are I(0) processes. The AR (2) is the most appropriate model for the BDEF series, while the ARMA (3, 2) is the proper model for the INTRATE series. The estimated VAR (2) model, comprising the two stationary series BDEF and INTRATE, implies that the BDEF series {{has no effect on}} the INTRATE series. The Granger-causality test also shows that there is no direction of causality from the BDEF series to the INTRATE series. Our findings are consistent with what the Ricardian Equivalence theorem predicts and, therefore, support the proposition that <b>the</b> <b>budget</b> <b>deficits</b> are neutral. This study significantly contributes to the extant literature of the relationship between <b>the</b> <b>budget</b> <b>deficits</b> and <b>the</b> real interest rates by applying the multi-model approach.
