5|$|In a contest, a row {{of small}} cages, each housing a single male finch, is lined up {{approximately}} six feet apart along a street. The close proximity of <b>the</b> <b>cages</b> increases the number of calls, as the birds sing for mates and to establish territory. A timekeeper begins and ends the contest with a red flag. Every time a bird sings a correct terminating flourish to their callmost often transcribed as susk-e-wieta tally mark in chalk is made on a long wooden stick. The bird singing its song the most times during one hour wins the contest. Champion finches regularly sing hundreds of calls in contests.|$|E
5|$|He {{returns to}} the {{observation}} room and finds the letter he'd written to Amanda, in which he'd used his knowledge of her role in Jill's miscarriage to blackmail her into killing Lynn Denlon. The letter was found by Pamela and given to Jill, who uses it to ambush Hoffman as William reaches {{the end of his}} path with one second left, finding himself between <b>the</b> <b>cages.</b> It is revealed that Pamela is his sister, while Tara and Brent are Harold's family. Tara is informed by a videotape of Kramer that she can either kill William or free him using the switch; when she is unable to make a decision, Brent angrily shifts the switch and a bed of needles swings down and injects William's body with the acid, killing him. Jill restrains Hoffman and locks a new reverse bear trap to his head. She shows him the sixth envelope, which contains his photo, and leaves him with 45 seconds but no key. Hoffman escapes by breaking his hand and jamming the trap as it activates, and he pulls his head free, ripping open his cheek.|$|E
5|$|Next to {{the south}} {{entrance}} to the park is the Bärenzwinger (bear pit). This was built in 193839 {{on the site of}} a former sanitation depot, also designed by Ludwig Hoffmann and already decorated with more than 50 plaques by Otto Lessing depicting bears, and a public lavatory, and opened on 17 August 1939. It consists of indoor sleeping quarters and outdoor exercise areas which have held as many as five bears (the armorial animal of Berlin) who are the official bears or mascots of the city. The impetus for building the Bärenzwinger was a letter to the newspaper Berliner Zeitung am Mittag (now B.Z.) from Wilfried Bade which appeared the day {{after the end of the}} celebration of the city's 700-year anniversary, and the Lord Mayor, Julius Lippert, had it completed despite objections from some Nazi functionaries that there were more important things to be done in what proved to be the run-up to World War II. Two of the original bears were gifts from Bern, which also has a bear on its arms. It remains largely unchanged, although it had to be reconstructed after the war; it reopened in 1949 with two new bears, again from Bern; one of these, Jente, produced 33 cubs (including 4 sets of triplets and 9 pairs of twins) before being retired to the zoo. The last official city bear, Schnute, lived there until her death in 2015; her daughter Maxi also lived there until her death in August 2013. The Bärenzwinger is a listed Berlin landmark. It was threatened with closure in 1990 due to lack of funds for needed modernisation, but after public protest, the Berlin Senate undertook to pay for the project. Underfloor heating in <b>the</b> <b>cages</b> and a skylight dome were added, and the electricity supply was overhauled. The facility reopened in 1993 and celebrated its 70th anniversary in 2009. Some animal protection advocates, including the city's own animal protection officer, have called for it to be closed as oldfashioned and inhumane.|$|E

50|$|If {{a charge}} is placed inside an {{ungrounded}} Faraday <b>cage,</b> <b>the</b> internal face of <b>the</b> <b>cage</b> becomes charged (in {{the same manner}} described for an external charge) to prevent {{the existence of a}} field inside the body of <b>the</b> <b>cage,</b> however, this charging of the inner face re-distributes the charges in the body of <b>the</b> <b>cage.</b> This charges <b>the</b> outer face of <b>the</b> <b>cage</b> with a charge equal in sign and magnitude to the one placed inside <b>the</b> <b>cage.</b> Since <b>the</b> internal charge and the inner face cancel each other out, the spread of charges on the outer face is not affected by the position of the internal charge inside <b>the</b> <b>cage.</b> So for all intents and purposes, <b>the</b> <b>cage</b> generates <b>the</b> same DC electric field that it would generate if it were simply affected by the charge placed inside.

25|$|In New York, <b>the</b> <b>Cages</b> first {{stayed with}} painter Max Ernst and Peggy Guggenheim. Through them, Cage met {{numerous}} important {{artists such as}} Piet Mondrian, André Breton, Jackson Pollock, Marcel Duchamp, and many others. Guggenheim was very supportive: <b>the</b> <b>Cages</b> could stay with her and Ernst {{for any length of}} time, and she offered to organize a concert of Cage's music at the opening of her gallery, which included paying for transportation of Cage's percussion instruments from Chicago. After she learned that Cage secured another concert, at the Museum of Modern Art, Guggenheim withdrew all support, and, even after the ultimately successful MoMA concert, Cage was left homeless, unemployed and penniless. The commissions he hoped for did not happen. He and Xenia spent the summer of 1942 with dancer Jean Erdman and her husband. Without the percussion instruments, Cage again turned to prepared piano, producing a substantial body of works for performances by various choreographers, including Merce Cunningham, who had moved to New York City several years earlier. Cage and Cunningham eventually became romantically involved, and Cage's marriage, already breaking up during the early 1940s, ended in divorce in 1945. Cunningham remained Cage's partner {{for the rest of his}} life. Cage also countered the lack of percussion instruments by writing, on one occasion, for voice and closed piano: the resulting piece, The Wonderful Widow of Eighteen Springs (1942), quickly became popular and was performed by the celebrated duo of Cathy Berberian and Luciano Berio.|$|E
25|$|Poultry housing {{has been}} shown to have adverse effects on the {{respiratory}} health of workers, ranging from a cough to chronic bronchitis. Workers are exposed to concentrated airborne particulate matter (PM) and endotoxins (a harmful waste product of bacteria). In a conventional hen house a conveyor belt beneath <b>the</b> <b>cages</b> removes the manure. In a cage-free aviary system the manure coats the ground, resulting in the build-up of dust and bacteria over time. Eggs are often laid on the ground or under cages in the aviary housing, causing workers to come close to the floor and force dust and bacteria into the air, which they then inhale during egg collection.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>cages</b> are {{arranged}} in long rows as multiple tiers, often with cages back-to-back (hence the term 'battery cage').

Light intensity is often kept low (e.g. 10 lux) to reduce feather pecking and vent pecking. Benefits of battery cages include easier care for the birds, floor eggs which are expensive to collect are eliminated, eggs are cleaner, capture at the end of lay is expedited, generally less feed is required to produce eggs, broodiness is eliminated, more hens may be housed in a given house floor space, internal parasites are more easily treated, and labor requirements are generally much reduced.|$|E

25|$|There {{are both}} {{advantages}} and disadvantages to using bath treatments. Bath treatments are more difficult and need more manpower to administer, requiring skirts or tarpaulins to be placed around <b>the</b> <b>cages</b> to contain the drug. Prevention of reinfection is a challenge since it is practically impossible to treat an entire bay {{in a short time}} period. Since the volume of water is imprecise, the required concentration is not guaranteed. Crowding of fish to reduce the volume of drug can also stress the fish. Recent use of well-boats containing the drugs has reduced both the concentration and environmental concerns, although transferring fish to the well boat and back to the cage can be stressful. The major advantage to bath treatments is that all the fish will be treated equally, in contrast to in-feed treatments where amount of drug ingested can vary due to a number of reasons.|$|E
25|$|The guard room above {{included}} an iron cell for drunks and less dangerous prisoners including women. Due to the courthouse's small size, the county needed to rent additional office space nearly immediately after completion. The building's inadequate space {{combined with a}} leaking roof would cause repairs and improvements to consume the majority of commissioners' time after 1982. In 1883, county commissioners denounced the building as too small and {{badly in need of}} repairs. After publishing an invitation for bids to construct a new, two-floor facility, they accepted one offered by Keesey due to his original land donation. One month later, after political infighting that resulted in the resignation of the county judge, all bids were then rejected. In the aftermath, the next meeting of the Commissioners Court called for a new tax levy to provide additional rooms for the jail and county clerk's office and five iron cages for upper jail cell. Although <b>the</b> <b>cages</b> were indeed installed, there is little proof that the building underwent any further expansion. In 1884, glass was installed in the windows of the clerk's office, and the sheriff was ordered to remove the water closet and fill the well in the courtyard.|$|E

Captive moths have been known to lay eggs in <b>the</b> <b>cages</b> they have been sequestered in. Egg size in the Lepidoptera is affected by a number of factors. Lepidoptera species which overwinter in the egg stage usually have larger eggs than the species that do not. Similarly, species feeding on woody plants in larval stage have larger eggs than those species feeding on herbaceous plants. Eggs laid by older females of a few butterfly species have been noted to be smaller in size than their younger counterparts. In the absence of adequate nutrition, the females of the corn-borer moth ( [...] Ostrinia spp.) have been recorded to lay clutches with egg sizes below normal.|$|E
50|$|The fourth match, the Lucha de Apuesta for {{the hair}} of the referee, was {{surprisingly}} turned into a Steel Cage match without any build.
