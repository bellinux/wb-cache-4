40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that anti-HLA antibodies might be involved in the pathogenesis of herpes gestationis (HG). Accordingly, we have studied the frequency and specificity of such antibodies in 26 female patients with immunologically proven HG. In addition, to further investigate the potential association of <b>the</b> <b>husband's</b> antigens in <b>the</b> development of this disorder, we have performed HLA typing in 20 of <b>the</b> <b>husbands</b> of these women. HLA-DR 2 was found in 50 % of <b>the</b> <b>husbands</b> (controls 25 %, p = 0. 04). The increase was more pronounced in <b>the</b> <b>husbands</b> of patients with the HLA-DR 3, DR 4 combination (64 %, p <. 01) than in <b>the</b> <b>husbands</b> of those with other antigen combinations. Anti-HLA antibodies were found in 85 % of women with a history of HG. Approximately 25 % of normal, multiparous women have such antibodies in their sera. In normal women, their presence has not been associated with increased fetal or maternal risk. These data suggest that <b>the</b> <b>husband's</b> HLA type may be associated with the development of HG in the wife. Anti-HLA antibodies are present in most patients, but their significance remains uncertain...|$|R

5|$|In Muslim families, {{women and}} men are {{considered}} equal, {{but not in the}} westernised sense.

5|$|Just as {{the image}} of the wife in {{advertising}} has reflected the general views of the appropriate roles of a wife, images of <b>the</b> <b>husband</b> also reflect the cultural values surrounding what role was believed a husband should be engaged in. For example, over time, it is common find images of <b>the</b> <b>husband</b> as performing work outside of the home and taking care of the family finances. It has been noted that this role has been especially prevalent during 1920, 1936, and 1970. On the other hand, one is not likely to find an advertisement depicting husbands engaged in household chores, except when they are depicted as particularly bad at performing the housework. In addition, it has been noted that over time, the portrayal of husbands and wives in an intimate, romantic relationship has been on the rise.|$|E

50|$|Another mystery behind <b>The</b> <b>Husband’s</b> Message is <b>the</b> {{connection}} it {{may or may}} {{not have}} to The Wife’s Lament and Exeter Book Riddle 60. The Wife’s Lament and <b>The</b> <b>Husband’s</b> Message are similar in style and mood. Some Anglo-Saxon scholars link the two poems on grounds that both treat a separation of lovers, but there is no conclusive evidence to link them together, only by their modern titles and their similar styles. The connection to Riddle 60 could be more convincing only because Riddle 60 is directly before <b>The</b> <b>Husband’s</b> Message. Lines 49-50 of <b>The</b> <b>Husband’s</b> Message speak of a rune-stave, which is used as a sense of personification. This idea of personification is used in Riddle 60, and the object which is being personified is a tree or plant. Due to the connection of personification of a tree or plant, have argued that Riddle 60 is the beginning of <b>The</b> <b>Husband’s</b> Message, but <b>the</b> consensus view is that they are separate texts. The 17 lines of Riddle 60 do not contain the contradictions that are found in the other riddles of the Exeter Book which are seemingly meant to confound the reader.|$|R
50|$|Naming in the Pokomo {{community}} {{is based on}} <b>the</b> <b>husband's</b> family tree. <b>The</b> first born if a boy is given the name of <b>the</b> <b>husband's</b> father and if a girl the name of <b>the</b> <b>husband's</b> mother. <b>The</b> second, third, fourth.. born boys takes the names of <b>the</b> <b>husband's</b> brothers in that order {{and if they are}} girls, the names of <b>the</b> <b>husband's</b> sisters in that order. There are names that are referred to both boys and girls by putting the prefix Ha before the name. If this prefix is put in the name it changes it to a girl's name. For example, Babwoya (name for a man), Habwoya (name for a lady); Maro (for Man), Hamaro (for a lady). Names are also given to children from plants and animal's names if the first born died during pregnancy or delivery. There was the belief that this will cut short the bad omen following the unborn child and thus enable the subsequent children to live to adulthood, children with such names are referred to as Mwana Fwisa such names include Mabuke (banana suckers), Nchui (cheetah) etc. Names also are given to children who are born during a certain season.|$|R
