5|$|The second {{first became}} {{a de facto}} base unit within the metric system when, in 1832, Carl Friedrich Gauss used it, the {{centimetre}} and the gram to derive the units associated with values of absolute measurements of the Earth's magnetic field. The second, if based on the Earth's rotation, is not a constant as the Earth's rotation is slowing down—in 2008 the solar day was 0.002s longer than in 1820. This had been known for many years; consequently in 1952 the International Astronomical Union (IAU) defined the second {{in terms of the}} Earth's rotation in the year 1900. Measurements of time were made using extrapolation from readings based on astronomy. With the launch of SI in 1960, the 11th CGPM adopted the IAU definition. In the years that followed, atomic clocks became significantly more reliable and precise; and in 1968 the 13th CGPM redefined the second in terms of a specific frequency from the emission spectrum of the caesium 133 atom, a component of atomic clocks. This provided the means to measure the time associated with astronomical phenomena rather than using astronomical phenomena as the basis from which <b>time</b> <b>measurements</b> were made.|$|E

25|$|During {{the time}} of the Franco-Flemish school in Renaissance music, use of the French {{notation}} system spread throughout Europe. This period brought the replacement of black with white notation. It also brought a further slowing down of the duration of the larger note values while introducing even more new small ones (fusa, semifusa etc.). Towards the end of this period, the original rules of perfection and imperfection became gradually obsolescent, as did the use of ligatures. During the 17th century, the system of mensuration signs and proportions gradually developed into the modern time signatures, and new notation devices for <b>time</b> <b>measurements,</b> such as bar lines and ties, were introduced, thus ultimately leading towards the modern notation system.|$|E

TEPCO was able to estimate radiation levels of 530 Sv/hr, the highest level measured since the March 2011 accident when the previous high was measured at 73 Sv/hr. This doesn't represent an increase in radiation, however is the first <b>time</b> <b>measurements</b> in the containment were taken at this location. This investigation provided visual evidence that the core melt partially breached the reactor vessel.A 1x1 meter hole in the grating of the undervessel Control Rod Drive inspection platform was identified along with various deposits of core debris and sediment.TEPCO is using this information to help plan an upcoming robot entry to the under-vessel region of the concrete-floored containment. These radiation levels are indicative {{of the presence of}} corium.|$|E
25|$|Fortunately, Galileo possessed an {{additional}} low-gain antenna that {{was capable of}} transmitting information back to Earth, although since it transmitted a signal isotropically, the low-gain antenna's bandwidth was significantly less than what the high-gain antenna's would have been; the high-gain antenna was to have transmitted at 134kilobits per second, whereas the low-gain antenna was only intended to transmit at about 8 to 16bits per second. Galileo low-gain antenna transmitted with a power of about 15 to 20watts, which, {{by the time it}} reached Earth and had been collected by one of the large aperture (70 m) NASA Deep Space Network antennas, had a total power of about −170dBm or 10zeptowatts (watts). Through the implementation of sophisticated technologies, the arraying of several Deep Space Network antennas and sensitivity upgrades to the receivers used to listen to Galileo signal, data throughput was increased to a maximum of 160bits per second. By further using data compression, the effective data rate could be raised to 1,000bits per second. The data collected on Jupiter and its moons was stored in the spacecraft's onboard tape recorder, and transmitted back to Earth during the long apoapsis portion of the probe's orbit using the low-gain antenna. At the same <b>time,</b> <b>measurements</b> were made of Jupiter's magnetosphere and transmitted back to Earth. The reduction in available bandwidth reduced the total amount of data transmitted throughout the mission, although 70% of Galileo science goals could still be met.|$|E

This paper {{discusses}} {{the problem of}} program execution <b>time</b> <b>measurement.</b> Program execution <b>time</b> <b>measurement</b> is problematic because the conventional measurement method, based on the real-time clock interrupt counting, is prone to inherent errors. These errors are caused by discrete nature of real-time clock interrupts and by the overhead of clock interrupt processing. Ways of reducing relative magnitude of these errors are described. The program execution <b>time</b> <b>measurement</b> and error estimation are illustrated by the measurement of real-time kernel operations’ execution time on the Intel 80386 EX micro-controller...|$|R

2500|$|Eventually, this {{definition}} too {{was found to}} be inadequate for precise <b>time</b> <b>measurements,</b> so in 1967, the SI second was again redefined as 9,192,631,770 periods of the radiation emitted by a caesium-133 atom in the transition between the two hyperfine levels of its ground state. That value agreed to 1 part in 1010 with the astronomical (ephemeris) second then in use. It was also close to [...] of the mean solar day as averaged between years 1750 and 1892.|$|E
2500|$|The Babylonians {{may have}} been the first to set out the concept of house division. Specifically, they timed the birth {{according}} to three systems of time division: (a) a three-part division of the night into watches, (b) a four-part division of the nychthemeron with respect to sunrise and sunset, and (c) a twelve-part division of the day-time into hours. Babylonian astronomers studied the rising times of the signs and calculated tables of ascensions for their latitude, [...] but it would take better <b>time</b> <b>measurements</b> by the Egyptians and the introduction of the concept of ascendant, around the 2nd century B.C., to give astrological houses their first recognisable structure and meaning, from the perspective of Classical Western astrology.|$|E
2500|$|Long {{baseline}} systems {{determine the}} position of a vehicle or diver by acoustically measuring the distance from a vehicle or diver interrogator to three or more seafloor deployed baseline transponders. These range measurements, which are often supplemented by depth data from pressure sensors on the devices, are then used to triangulate {{the position of}} the vehicle or diver. [...] In figure 1, a diver mounted interrogator (A) sends a signal, which is received by the baseline transponders (B, C, D). [...] The transponders reply, and the replies are received again by the diver station (A). [...] Signal run <b>time</b> <b>measurements</b> now yield the distances A-B, A-C and A-D, which are used to compute the diver position by triangulation or position search algorithms. [...] The resulting positions are relative to the location of the baseline transducers. These can be readily converted to a geo-referenced coordinate system such as latitude/longitude or UTM if the geo-positions of the baseline stations are first established.|$|E

2500|$|Already in his {{philosophical}} {{writing on}} <b>time</b> <b>measurements</b> (1898), Poincaré wrote that astronomers like Ole Rømer, {{in determining the}} speed of light, simply assume that light has a constant speed, and that this speed is the same in all directions. Without this postulate {{it would not be}} possible to infer the speed of light from astronomical observations, as Rømer did based on observations of the moons of Jupiter. Poincaré went on to note that Rømer also had to assume that Jupiter's moons obey Newton's laws, including the law of gravitation, whereas {{it would be possible to}} reconcile a different speed of light with the same observations if we assumed some different (probably more complicated) laws of motion. According to Poincaré, this illustrates that we adopt for the speed of light a value that makes the laws of mechanics as simple as possible. (This is an example of Poincaré's conventionalist philosophy.) Poincaré also noted that the propagation speed of light can be (and in practice often is) used to define simultaneity between spatially separate events. However, in that paper he did not go on to discuss the consequences of applying these [...] "conventions" [...] to multiple relatively moving systems of reference. This next step was done by Poincaré in 1900, when he recognized that synchronization by light signals in earth's reference frame leads to Lorentz's local time. (See the section on [...] "local time" [...] above). And in 1904 Poincaré wrote: ...|$|E
