5000|$|A common {{method of}} grading {{cerebral}} AVMs is the Spetzler-Martin (SM) grade. [...] <b>This</b> <b>system</b> <b>was</b> {{designed to assess}} the patient's risk of neurological deficit after open surgical resection (surgical morbidity), based on characteristics of the AVM itself. Based on <b>this</b> <b>system,</b> AVMs may <b>be</b> classified as grades 1 - 5. <b>This</b> <b>system</b> <b>was</b> not intended to characterize risk of hemorrhage.|$|R

5|$|Gunnerkrigg Court {{is set in}} a {{boarding}} school in a country that resembles the United Kingdom, identifiable from the grey skies and mandatory uniforms. The comic contains other clues about the setting, such as the house system that is described {{at the end of the}} first chapter. <b>This</b> <b>system</b> <b>is</b> similar to that used by many UK schools, including the one the author attended; Siddell has even stated that the school in which Gunnerkrigg Court takes place is modeled after his own secondary school.|$|E
5|$|Located around 4 degrees {{northeast}} of Alpha is T Pyxidis, a binary star system {{composed of a}} white dwarf with around 0.8 times the Sun's mass and a red dwarf that orbit each other every 1.8 hours. <b>This</b> <b>system</b> <b>is</b> located around 15,500 light-years away from Earth. A recurrent nova, it has brightened to the 7th magnitude in the years 1890, 1902, 1920, 1944, 1966 and 2011 from a baseline of around 14th magnitude. These outbursts {{are thought to be}} due to the white dwarf accreting material from its companion and ejecting periodically.|$|E

5|$|Some Heathens {{celebrate}} the eight festivals {{found in the}} Wheel of the Year, a tradition that they share with Wiccans and other contemporary Pagan groups. Others celebrate only six of these festivals, as represented by a six-spoked Wheel of the Year. The use of such festivals is criticized by other practitioners, who highlight that <b>this</b> <b>system</b> <b>is</b> of modern, mid-20th century origin and does not link with the original religious celebrations of the pre-Christian Germanic world.|$|E
5|$|The Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite is {{a system}} of 33 degrees (including the three Blue Lodge degrees) {{administered}} by a local or national Supreme Council. <b>This</b> <b>system</b> <b>is</b> popular in North America and in Continental Europe. The York Rite, with a similar range, administers three orders of Masonry, namely the Royal Arch, Cryptic Masonry and Knights Templar.|$|E
5|$|The gymnasia have forms which {{operate on}} a unit-credit system, {{that is to say}} a term is divided into course units, each of which is worth a certain number of credits.

5|$|The unrooted {{cladogram}} to {{the right}} shows the relationship between various subgenera and classes {{as defined by the}} analysis of Rivadavia et al. in 2002. The monotypic section Meristocaulis {{was not included in the}} study, so its place in <b>this</b> <b>system</b> <b>is</b> unclear. More recent studies have placed this group near section Bryastrum, so it is placed there below. Also of note, the placement of the section Regiae in relation to Aldrovanda and Dionaea is uncertain. Since the section Drosera is polyphyletic, it shows up multiple times in the cladogram (*).|$|E
5|$|Independent twin sets or {{independent}} doubles {{consists of two}} independent cylinders and two regulators, each with a submersible pressure gauge. <b>This</b> <b>system</b> <b>is</b> heavier, more expensive to buy and maintain and more expensive to fill than a single cylinder set. The diver must swap demand valves during the dive to preserve a sufficient reserve of gas in each cylinder. If this is not done, then if a cylinder should fail the diver may end up having an inadequate reserve. Independent twin sets do not work well with air-integrated computers as they usually only monitor one cylinder. The complexity of switching regulators periodically to ensure both cylinders are evenly used may be offset by the redundancy of two entirely separate breathing gas supplies. The cylinders may be mounted as a twin set on the diver's back, or alternatively can be carried in a sidemount configuration where penetration of wrecks or caves requires it, and where the cylinder valves are in easy reach.|$|E
5|$|Integer {{powers of}} 2 are {{important}} in computer science. The positive integer powers 2n give the number of possible values for an n-bit integer binary number, e.g. 28 = 256 different values for 1byte. For a given number the binary number system denotes {{on one side of}} the binary point all the positive integer powers of 2, that are contained in the integer part of this number, and the negative powers to the other side of the binary point represent the fractional part. <b>This</b> <b>system</b> <b>is</b> consistently used to represent numbers in computers for hardware reasons.|$|E

50|$|The {{first version}} of Microsoft’s machine {{translation}} <b>system</b> <b>was</b> developed between 1999 and 2000 within Microsoft Research. <b>This</b> <b>system</b> <b>was</b> based on semantic predicate-argument structures known as logical forms (LF), and was spun from the grammar correction feature developed for Microsoft Word. <b>This</b> <b>system</b> <b>was</b> eventually used to translate the entire Microsoft Knowledge Base into Spanish, French, German, and Japanese.|$|R
5|$|Other {{developmental}} and reproductive variations include haplodiploidy, polymorphism, paedomorphosis or peramorphosis, sexual dimorphism, parthenogenesis and more rarely hermaphroditism. In haplodiploidy, {{which is a}} type of sex-determination system, the offspring's sex is determined by the number of sets of chromosomes an individual receives. <b>This</b> <b>system</b> <b>is</b> typical in bees and wasps. Polymorphism is where a species may have different morphs or forms, as in the oblong winged katydid, which has four different varieties: green, pink and yellow or tan. Some insects may retain phenotypes that are normally only seen in juveniles; this is called paedomorphosis. In peramorphosis, an opposite sort of phenomenon, insects take on previously unseen traits after they have matured into adults. Many insects display sexual dimorphism, in which males and females have notably different appearances, such as the moth Orgyia recens as an exemplar of sexual dimorphism in insects.|$|E
5|$|Since 1949, a more {{detailed}} classification system has been put into use based on thematic content and the historical period of a play's creation. The first category in <b>this</b> <b>system</b> <b>is</b> chuantongxi, traditional plays that were in performance before 1949. The second category is xinbian de lishixi, historical plays written after 1949. This type of play was not produced at all during the Cultural Revolution, but is a major focus today. The final category is xiandaixi, contemporary plays. The subject matter of these plays is taken from the 20th century and beyond. Contemporary productions are also frequently experimental in nature, and may incorporate Western influences. In {{the second half of}} the 20th century, Western works have increasingly been adapted for Peking opera. The works of Shakespeare have been especially popular. The movement to adapt Shakespeare to the stage has encompassed all forms of Chinese theatre. Peking opera in particular has seen versions of A Midsummer Night's Dream and King Lear, among others.|$|E
5|$|Single {{cylinder}} with dual regulators {{consists of}} a single large back mounted cylinder, with two first-stage regulators, each with a second-stage regulator. <b>This</b> <b>system</b> <b>is</b> used for diving where cold water makes the risk of regulator freezing high and functional redundancy is required. It is common in continental Europe, especially Germany. The advantage is that a regulator failure can be solved underwater to bring the dive to a controlled conclusion without buddy breathing or gas sharing. However, {{it is hard to}} reach the valves, so there may be some reliance on the dive buddy to help close the valve of the free-flowing regulator quickly.|$|E

5|$|The game is {{presented}} in an isometric format and set on board a starship. Taking {{on the role of}} the robot, Alien 8, the player must explore the large starship in order to ensure that the cryogenic life support systems preserving the biological crew are re-activated. The core of <b>this</b> <b>system</b> <b>is</b> a series of geometrically-shaped circuits. However, the circuits have been removed by the invading aliens and distributed around the starship. The main objective of the game is to collect the correct circuits and return them to their respective locations before the starship reaches its destination. The circuits are variously shaped as cubes, pyramids, domes or cylinders.|$|E
5|$|The {{glutathione}} system includes glutathione, glutathione reductase, glutathione peroxidases, and glutathione S-transferases. <b>This</b> <b>system</b> <b>is</b> {{found in}} animals, plants and microorganisms. Glutathione peroxidase is an enzyme containing four selenium-cofactors that catalyzes {{the breakdown of}} hydrogen peroxide and organic hydroperoxides. There are at least four different glutathione peroxidase isozymes in animals. Glutathione peroxidase 1 is the most abundant and is a very efficient scavenger of hydrogen peroxide, while glutathione peroxidase 4 is most active with lipid hydroperoxides. Surprisingly, glutathione peroxidase 1 is dispensable, as mice lacking this enzyme have normal lifespans, but they are hypersensitive to induced oxidative stress. In addition, the glutathione S-transferases show high activity with lipid peroxides. These enzymes are at particularly high levels in the liver and also serve in detoxification metabolism.|$|E
5|$|These {{are used}} when the casting alloy {{cannot be used}} in hot-chamber machines; these include aluminium, zinc alloys with a large {{composition}} of aluminium, magnesium and copper. The process for these machines start with melting the metal in a separate furnace. Then a precise amount of molten metal is transported to the cold-chamber machine where it is fed into an unheated shot chamber (or injection cylinder). This shot is then driven into the die by a hydraulic or mechanical piston. The biggest disadvantage of <b>this</b> <b>system</b> <b>is</b> the slower cycle time due {{to the need to}} transfer the molten metal from the furnace to the cold-chamber machine.|$|E
