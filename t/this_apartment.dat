'Intro' and 'Breathless' were recorded here, along with various guitar and keyboard overdubs. A version of 'Torch Song' was also recorded, but was scrapped due to excessive background noise. Rundgren recalled that recording at home meant he could spend time working on pieces of technology or production, such as programming a VCS3 synthesizer, at his leisure without wasting anyone else's time. The artwork on the original gatefold sleeve was also shot in <b>this</b> <b>apartment.</b> Despite working long hours each day in both I.D and at home, with minimum breaks for sleeping and eating, Rundgren said he enjoyed the recording experience, and [...] "wouldn't have had it any other way." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Bryson {{was built}} in 1913 by real estate developer, Hugh W.

[...] Bryson acquired the property in 1911, purchasing and razing four houses that occupied the space. [...] He had originally intended to construct a six-story building flush with the sidewalks along Wilshire Boulevard and Rampart Street. [...] When neighbors complained about his plans, Bryson chose instead to build a taller structure, but one set back [...] from the centerlines of Wilshire Boulevard and Rampart Street. [...] In March 1912, Bryson announced his revised plans: [...] "It is my intention to make <b>this</b> <b>apartment</b> house in a class by itself on this coast and finer than any other west of New York City.

Haarmann would then begin paring the flesh from the limbs and torso. This surplus flesh would be disposed of in the toilet or, usually, in the nearby river.|$|E
2500|$|Krasner retold from a story {{related to}} him in long {{discussion}} with Schoenberg's son Görgi, a Jew who remained in Vienna during the war, that the Weberns, much to their risk and credit, had provided Görgi and his family with food and shelter {{toward the end of}} the war at the Weberns' home in a Mödling apartment belonging to their son-in-law. Görgi and his family were left behind for their safety when Webern fled on foot with his family to Mittersill, about 75km. away, for safety of their own in light of the coming Russian invasion; Amalie, one of Webern's daughters, wrote of '17 persons pressed together in the smallest possible space' upon their arrival. Ironically, the Russians pronounced Görgi a [...] "Nazi spy" [...] when he was discovered due to the Nazi munitions and propaganda in the Weberns' basement store-room. Görgi is said to have saved himself from execution by protesting and drawing attention to his clothes, sewn as specified by the Nazis with the yellow Star of David.
