5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the Great War, the Roman Catholic Church encountered great difficulties in the region. There was insufficient staffing, the cost of living was rising, and the harsh climate began <b>to</b> <b>wear</b> <b>on</b> the buildings. In 1920, the diocese had, in addition to Carabane, thirteen churches and approximately thirty-five chapels. The thirteen churches were located in Dakar, Saint-Louis, Gorée, Rufisque, Thiès, Ngazobil, Joal, Fadiouth, Foundiougne, Kaolack, Ziguinchor, Bignona and Banjul. In 1922, the Governor decreed which buildings were authorized to practise Catholicism. While the Carabane church was one of the buildings selected, some members blamed the colonial administration for having facilitated the expansion of Islam in the country.|$|E
5|$|The Confederate {{trousers}} {{were very}} {{similar to those of the}} Union forces. Early on, the trousers were sky blue in color. They were most often made of wool, and were easily worn during long marches. If trousers did not arrive for the troops the soldiers would have to use their own pants to wear. Regimental and company officers wore the colors of their respective branch on the outer seam of their pants on one and one-quarter inch stripes. Generals wore two and five-eighths inch stripes on each pant leg. While the quartermasters, commissary, and engineer officers wore a single magenta, one and one-quarter inch outer-seam stripe.

5|$|There are {{a variety}} of end uses to weather forecasts. Weather {{warnings}} are important forecasts because they are used to protect life and property. Forecasts based on temperature and precipitation are important to agriculture, and therefore to traders within commodity markets. Temperature forecasts are used by utility companies to estimate demand over coming days. On an everyday basis, people use weather forecasts to determine what <b>to</b> <b>wear</b> <b>on</b> a given day. Since outdoor activities are severely curtailed by heavy rain, snow and wind chill, forecasts can be used to plan activities around these events, and to plan ahead and survive them. In 2014, the US spent $5.1 billion on weather forecasting.|$|E
5|$|By early 1918, {{the long}} periods of {{inactivity}} had begun <b>to</b> <b>wear</b> <b>on</b> the crews of several warships at Cattaro, including Kaiser Karl VI. On 1 February, the Cattaro Mutiny broke out, starting aboard Sankt Georg and quickly spreading to Kaiser Karl VI. Officers were confined to their quarters while a committee of sailors met to formulate a list of demands, which ranged from longer periods of leave and better rations to {{an end to the}} war, based on the United States President Woodrow Wilson's Fourteen Points. The following day, shore batteries loyal to the government fired on the old ironclad , which prompted many of the mutinous ships to abandon the effort. Late in the day on 2 February, the red flags were struck from Kaiser Karl VI and she rejoined the loyalist ships in the harbor. The next morning, the s of the III Division arrived in Cattaro, which convinced the last holdouts to surrender. Trials on the ringleaders commenced quickly and four men were executed.|$|E
5|$|Juventus {{moved to}} the Stadio Comunale, {{but for the rest}} of the 1930s and the {{majority}} of the 1940s they were unable to recapture championship dominance. After the Second World War, Gianni Agnelli was appointed honorary president. The club added two more league championships to its name in the 1949–50 and 1951–52 seasons, the latter of which was under the management of Englishman Jesse Carver. Two new strikers were signed during 1957–58: Welshman John Charles and Italian Argentine Omar Sívori, playing alongside longtime member Giampiero Boniperti. That season saw Juventus awarded with the Golden Star for Sport Excellence <b>to</b> <b>wear</b> <b>on</b> their shirts after becoming the first Italian side to win ten league titles. In the same season, Sívori became the first ever player at the club to win the European Footballer of the Year. The following season, they beat Fiorentina to complete their first league and cup double, winning Serie A and Coppa Italia. Boniperti retired in 1961 as the all-time top scorer at the club, with 182goals in all competitions, a club record which stood for 45 years.|$|E

Things deteriorated {{as the year}} progressed. Goaltender Roberto Luongo became disgruntled {{with a lack of}} playing time and forced a trade in March, while the team continued to fall in the standings. General Manager Mike Gillis was fired in April. Vancouver ended the season finishing sixth last overall out of thirty teams. This finish allowed the team to select sixth overall at the 2014 Entry Draft, the lowest the Canucks had selected since 1999 when the team selected second and third overall.|$|E
25|$|By all accounts, Smith was a well-respected and even-tempered man. However Bogan's taunts began <b>to</b> <b>wear</b> <b>on</b> Smith, who {{eventually}} climbed {{down from his}} wagon and headed toward Bogan. As Smith walked toward Bogan, the latter stuck his hand into his coat. Smith told {{him that if he}} pulled his gun, he'd knock him to the ground. Bogan did pull his pistol, at which point Smith did knock him down with one punch. The two then wrestled briefly before Smith was able to take the young man's gun from him. As he did this, Kemp ran over producing his own handgun, and hit Smith {{in the back of the}} head. Smith then turned and pointed his pistol at Kemp, and pulled the trigger. However, the pistol misfired, according to witnesses, and Kemp fled at top speed. Smith turned Bogan's pistol over to the town marshal.|$|E
