"So off I sot, {{and there}} wos a crowd o' {{about two hundred}} miners round a tree; and, jest as I come up, <b>they</b> <b>wos</b> puttin' the rope round the neck of a poor wretch of an old grey-haired red-skin, whose limbs trembled so that <b>they</b> <b>wos</b> scarce able to hold him up.|$|R

'Tis said the first hunters used to wonder greatly at these myster'ous circles, and they invented all sorts o' stories to account for 'em.

Four an' fourpence a year! think o' that--not to mention the {{deduction}} w'en they goes {{for a month or}} two to the country each summer. Four an' fourpence a year, Dick! Some of 'em even goes so low as a halfpenny, which makes two an' twopence a year--7 pounds, 11 shillings, 8 pence in a seventy-year lifetime, Dick, supposin' their liberality began to flow the day <b>they</b> <b>wos</b> born!' ...|$|R

"Faix, that's true," [...] replied Jerry; [...] "there's two {{philosophers}} aboord of {{this here}} light, an' the luminous power of our united intellicks {{is so strong}} that I've had it in my mind more than wance to suggest that if <b>they</b> <b>wos</b> to hoist you and me to the masthead together, the Gull would git on first-rate without any lantern at all." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "No, sir; I {{object to}} givin' dogs names on principle.

6000|$|... "Why? {{because from}} my {{earliest}} years I always {{was fond of}} animals.

"Well, I dunno," [...] {{rejoined the}} farrier, [...] "it don't seem nateral for white men to quarrel {{with each other}} about the way to treat an Injin, and that Injin lyin' in ambush to shoot 'em both. And ef gov'ment would only make up its mind how to treat 'em, instead of one day pretendin' to be their 'Great Father' and treatin' them like babies, and the next makin' {{treaties}} with 'em like as <b>they</b> <b>wos</b> forriners, and the next sendin' out a handful of us to lick ten thousand of them--Wot's the use of ONE regiment--even two--agin a nation--on their own ground?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Both,' replied Sam; 'easy shavin' was his natur', and cuttin' and curlin' was {{his pride}} and glory. His whole delight wos in his trade.

6000|$|Mr Sloppy having shaken {{his head}} to a {{considerable}} extent, proceeded to remark that he thought Johnny 'must have took 'em from the Minders.' Being asked what he meant, he answered, them that come out upon him and partickler his chest.

Pressed to fall back upon a nominative case, he opined that <b>they</b> <b>wos</b> about as red as ever red could be. 'But as long as they strikes out'ards, sir,' continued Sloppy, 'they ain't so much. It's their striking in'ards that's to be kep off.' ...|$|R

A brig saw 'em at daylight, {{but just}} as <b>they</b> <b>wos</b> being picked up, one wos so {{exhausted}} he slipped off the wreck an wos drownded. 'Nother time," [...] continued Moy, as he paced slowly to and fro, [...] "we seed a corp float past, and tried to 'ook it with the boat-'ook, but missed it.

6000|$|... "But there's brave fellers {{among the}} redskins," [...] rejoined Bounce. [...] "I knowed a set o' young fellers as banded theirselves together, and swore they'd go through fire an' water, thick an' thin, but they'd niver turn {{back from the}} face o' danger {{wherever}} they met it.

Of course the redskins niver lost a chance o' killin' the whites; an' so they come to sich a state o' war, that they had to make peace by givin' them no end o' presents o' guns an' cloth an' beads--enough to buy up the furs o' a whole tribe." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "That's how it is," [...] {{continued}} Bounce; [...] "an' that bein' the case, savages always invariably thinks o' {{number one}} before they thinks on anythin' else.

6000|$|Such were Glynn and Ailie. [...] "So they married, of course," [...] you remark. Well, reader, and why not? Nothing {{could be}} more natural. Glynn felt, and said, too, that nothing was nearer his heart. And Ailie admitted-- after being told by Glynn that she must be his wife, for {{he wanted to have}} her, and was {{determined}} to have her whether she would or not--that her heart was in similar proximity to the idea of marriage. Captain Dunning did not object--it would have been odd if he had objected to the fulfilment of his chief earthly desire. Tim Rokens did not groan when he heard of the proposal--by no means; on the contrary, he roared, and laughed, and shouted with delight, and went straight off to tell Phil Briant, who roared a duet with him, and they both agreed that it [...] "wos the most gloriously nat'ral thing they ever did know since <b>they</b> <b>wos</b> launched upon the sea of time!" ...|$|R

Well, soon after, we shot a buffalo bull, so when it fell, off he jumps from his horse an runs up to it.
