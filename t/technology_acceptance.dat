After sketching {{some of the}} problems in e-commerce and e-business, we introduce the conversational paradigm as applied to ecommerce.

In an era of public disenchantment on democratic institutions, modern democratic parliaments utilize Information Communication Technologies (ICTs) to enhance their accessibility and interaction with citizens for inclusive decision making process. In spite of the unprecedented diffusion, acceptance and usage of ICTs in Africa, legislative assemblies of most African countries are inaccessible and lack adequate meeting facilities to regularly interact meaningfully with the public.

5000|$|A {{simplified}} modification to flow {{has been}} {{combined with the}} <b>technology</b> <b>acceptance</b> model (TAM) to help guide the design of and explain the adoption of intrinsically motivated computer systems. This model, the hedonic-motivation system adoption model (HMSAM) is model to improve the understanding of hedonic-motivation systems (HMS) adoption. HMS are systems used primarily to fulfill users' intrinsic motivations, such for online gaming, virtual worlds, online shopping, learning/education, online dating, digital music repositories, social networking, online pornography, gamified systems, and for general gamification. Instead of a minor, TAM extension, HMSAM is an HMS-specific system acceptance model based on an alternative theoretical perspective, which is in turn grounded in flow-based concept of cognitive absorption (CA). The HMSAM further builds on van der Heijden's (2004) model of hedonic system adoption by including CA as a key mediator of perceived ease of use (PEOU) and of behavioral intentions to use (BIU) hedonic-motivation systems. Typically, models simplistically represent [...] "intrinsic motivations" [...] by mere perceived enjoyed. Instead, HMSAM uses the more complex, rich construct of CA, which includes joy, control, curiosity, focused immersion, and temporal dissociation. CA is construct that {{is grounded in the}} seminal flow literature, yet ironically CA has traditionally been used as a static construct, as if all five of its subconstructs occur at the same time—in direct contradiction to the flow literature. Thus, part of HMSAM's contribution is to return CA closer to its flow roots by re-ordering these CA subconstructs into more natural process-variance order as predicted by flow. Empirical data collection along with mediation tests further support this modeling approach.|$|E
