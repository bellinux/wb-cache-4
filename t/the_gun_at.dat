5|$|Following the arming of the Italian ironclads Duilio and Dandolo with 100-ton guns, the British feared an Italian {{attack on}} Malta, as the ships could fire on Malta's batteries, {{destroying}} them {{one after the}} other, while keeping outside their guns' range. To prevent this, the British requested that four 100-ton guns be built. Two of these were installed in Malta, and Cambridge Battery and Rinella Battery were built specifically to house these guns. Construction of the batteries began in 1878 and they were complete by 1886. <b>The</b> <b>gun</b> <b>at</b> Rinella still exists.|$|E
5|$|Scully {{finds the}} two {{sitting at a}} table with the dead guard's revolver. Modell forces Mulder to play Russian {{roulette}} with him. Despite Scully's pleading, Mulder pulls the trigger first at Modell and then himself, the hammer falling on an empty chamber both times. Modell then makes him aim <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> <b>at</b> Scully. At the last instant, Scully sees a fire alarm in a mirror and pulls it in desperation, breaking Modell's concentration. Mulder instantly switches his aim to Modell and pulls the trigger; the bullet is fired and Modell is severely wounded.|$|E
5|$|In November, the Board {{agreed to}} a {{compromise}} design that incorporated a secondary battery of eight 8in guns in four twin turrets amidships and twelve 7in guns in casemates. The decision to retain the 8in guns was made in large part due to American experiences in the Spanish–American War three years before. US Navy officers had been impressed {{with the performance of}} <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> <b>at</b> the Battle of Santiago de Cuba; despite scoring only 13 hits out of 309 shells fired, the gun had a flat trajectory and good range for its size. Armor protection was improved over the BuOrd design, with a thicker armored belt and casemate protection, albeit at the expense of thinner armor covering the barbettes that supported the gun turrets. The designers reasoned that since the barbettes were behind the belt and a transverse bulkhead, weight could be saved by reducing the level of direct protection.|$|E

25|$|Whether in {{the main}} sweep or in an {{individual}} stop's sweep, the same tactics would be applied. The sweepline would proceed forward with each soldier scanning line of sight ahead through the bush and undergrowth. The speed of this movement varied depending on the terrain and density of the bush, but when the troops sensed enemy ahead the sweep slowed markedly, edging forward inch by inch, rifles at ready and pointed ahead with the safety catches off. MAG gunners would bear <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> <b>at</b> the hip, held by a sling from their shoulders.|$|E

When the Winchesters travel to 1861, they meet Samuel Colt, from whom Sam gets the Colt, and Dean uses it to kill a phoenix, as they need its ashes. Dean drops the Colt just before being transported back to the present day, where it is presumably retrieved by the saloon owner Elkins, the ancestor of Daniel Elkins.|$|E

25|$|Posing as {{an elderly}} woman named Betsy, Sheila takes Phyllis, Summer, and Fen to a nearby {{retirement}} home to hide out. After learning of their location, Lauren goes to that home carrying a gun in her purse. Following a tip from a neighbor, Lauren finds Sheila's apartment and forces her way inside. Sheila and Phyllis then argue over who is who, and Lauren screams at them to stop. Sheila then runs to grab baby Summer {{in order to use}} her as a shield against Lauren; Phyllis tells Lauren to point <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> <b>at</b> her to protect her daughter, and a frightened Lauren, realizing the real Phyllis would never put her daughter in the line of fire, turns to Sheila and shoots her. Sheila is then declared dead at the scene.|$|E
25|$|Breech-loading swivel {{guns were}} {{developed}} surprisingly early, and were used from 1370 onward. The guns were loaded with mug-shaped chambers, in which gunpowder and projectile {{had been filled}} in advance. The chamber was then put in place, blocked with a wedge, and then fired. As the loading was made in advance and separately, breech-loading swivel guns were quick-firing guns for their time. An early description of a breech-loading swivel gun puts the weight of <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> <b>at</b> 118kg, equipped with three chambers for rotations, each 18kg in weight, and firing a 280 g lead shot. The guns had a disadvantage: they leaked and lost power around the chambers, but this was compensated by {{the high rate of}} fire as multiple chambers could be prepared in advance. Breech-loading swivel gun could fire either cannonballs against obstacles, or grapeshot against troops.|$|E

25|$|The rear COW gun {{mounting}} {{was installed}} immediately aft of the wing, in a fixed mount that only {{allowed for a}} limited adjustment of the angle. A special sight for this gun was installed in the pilot's cockpit. This armament would be aimed by the pilot from a position below the aircraft attacked, {{in the manner of}} the Schräge Musik installation used by the Germans during WWII. However, the concept was based on the theory of no allowance sighting, which sought to install <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> <b>at</b> an angle at which the body lift of the projectile, due to the forward motion of the aircraft, would compensate for the effect of gravity, straightening the trajectory. The first firing trials resulted in several broken wing ribs, and a special rubber-spring shield was developed to protect the upper wing.|$|E
25|$|Less {{than two}} months after the murder of Dawn Basom, on June 9, three teenage boys {{discovered}} a partially nude body of a young woman in a field close to an abandoned farmhouse on North Territorial Road. The victim had received multiple slash and stab wounds to the body (including two stab wounds which had pierced her heart), and a gunshot wound to the forehead before her neck had been cut through to the spine. The victim's right thumb had also received a gunshot wound, suggesting the woman had instinctively raised her hand to protect herself before her killer had fired <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> <b>at</b> point-blank range. She had also been raped, although the pathologist was unable to determine whether this act had occurred before or after death. Sections of her clothing were scattered around her body, although one of her shoes was missing.|$|E
25|$|Adebolajo {{also gave}} a {{bystander}} {{at the scene}} a handwritten two-page note which set out his justification for his actions. The assailants remained at the scene and asked bystanders to call the police. The Metropolitan Police received the first 999 call about an assault at 14:20 and unarmed police were deployed. Subsequent 999 calls said the attackers had a firearm, and armed police were ordered to the scene at 14:24. Unarmed police arrived at 14:29, set up a cordon, and remained behind it. Authorised Firearms Officers arrived at 14:34. The two men, one brandishing a cleaver {{and the other a}} revolver, charged at the police. Armed police fired eight times and both men were wounded. They were arrested and taken to separate hospitals. A revolver, knives, and a cleaver were seized at the scene. The victim, Rigby, was pronounced dead and formally identified. The revolver was later determined to be a non-functioning 90-year-old Dutch KNIL 9.4mm. Adebowale pointed <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> <b>at</b> responding armed police officers, who opened fire and shot off one of his thumbs.|$|E

500|$|At {{the motel}} room, Selena and Saldívar began arguing. Motel guests complained about loud noises coming from Saldívar's room.

Selena then dumped Saldívar's satchel containing bank statements onto the bed and saw <b>the</b> <b>gun.</b> <b>At</b> 11:48a.m. (CST), Saldívar pointed it at Selena. As Selena tried to flee, Saldívar shot her once on the lower right shoulder, severing an artery and causing a massive loss of blood. Trinidad Espinoza, the hotel's maintenance man, reported hearing a [...] "loud bang", which he likened to a car engine misfiring. Selena was critically wounded; she ran towards the lobby, leaving a trail of blood [...] long. She was seen clutching her chest screaming, [...] "Help me! Help me! I've been shot!"; Saldívar was still chasing after her, pointing <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> <b>at</b> her, and calling her a [...] "bitch". According to Carlos Morales, who was waiting outside the motel, he heard screaming and saw Selena running towards him. She grabbed Morales and screamed, [...] "they'll shoot me again". Selena collapsed on the floor at 11:49a.m. (CST) as hotel general manager Barbara Schultz telephoned the emergency services. The singer identified Saldívar as her assailant and gave the number of the room where she had been shot. Shawna Vela and hotel sales manager Ruben DeLeon tried to stop the flow of blood. Selena's condition began to deteriorate rapidly as motel staff attended to her. Selena screamed at the staff, telling them, [...] "lock the door, she'll shoot me again". DeLeon tried to talk to Selena but noticed she was beginning to lose consciousness; he said she was moaning and moving less often. DeLeon noticed Selena's eyes had rolled back and that she went limp.|$|E

500|$|During trial {{proceedings}} for the Otterstrom {{murder on}} April 2, 1985, Gardner attempted {{to escape from}} custody with a revolver smuggled into the Metropolitan Hall of Justice at Salt Lake City. Jim Kleine of the Salt Lake City Fire Department believed that the gun was passed to Gardner as he was being escorted into the courthouse from the underground parking lot. Gardner was immediately shot in the chest by guard Luther Hensley. Gardner then wounded unarmed bailiff George [...] "Nick" [...] Kirk in the abdomen. After running to the courtroom archives, Gardner confronted attorneys Robert Macri and Michael Burdell. According to Macri, after Gardner pointed <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> <b>at</b> him, he changed aim to Burdell, who had been doing pro bono work for his church. Burdell yelled, [...] "Oh, my God," [...] when Gardner {{shot him in the}} eye. Gardner made his way outside the building, where he was surrounded by dozens of police officers.

500|$|The Court {{held that}} despite not {{mentioning}} the words [...] "straw buyers", the federal gun law that regulates transactions with “persons” or “transferees” considers the “persons” or “transferees” {{to be the}} ones getting <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> <b>at</b> the end of the day, not the straw persons completing the transaction on their behalf. Failure to interpret the law in such way, the Court held, would undermine the purpose of the law, which is to prevent guns from falling into the wrong hands. [...] "Deliverymen, after all, are not so hard to come by." [...] The majority found Abramski's theory, that the federal law only cares about the person that is buying the gun and not the final buyer not to be true. The Court's majority opinion, written by Justice Kagan, held that if you interpret the terms “person” and “transferee,” to mean “the man at the counter”, you would undermine the purpose of the statutes, which is to prevent guns from falling into the wrong hands. The Court therefore preferred to interpret the terms “person,” and “transferee,” to mean “the man getting, and always meant to get, the firearm”.|$|E
