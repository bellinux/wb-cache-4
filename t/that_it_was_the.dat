5|$|Another blow to Soviet {{communism}} in the First World {{came with the}} establishment of eurocommunism. Eurocommunists espoused and supported the ideals of Soviet communism {{while at the same time}} supporting rights of the individual. The largest obstacle was <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> largest communist parties, those with highest electoral turnout, which became eurocommunists. Originating with the Prague Spring, this new thinking made the First World more skeptical of Soviet {{communism in}} general. The Italian Communist Party notably declared that should war break out in Europe, they would rally to the defense of Italy and resist any Soviet incursion on their nation's soil.|$|E

5|$|Edgar T.

Herb Wagner, in 1953, suggested instead <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> hybrid of A.montanum and A.platyneuron, noting that Eaton and W. N. Clute had already made tentative suggestions along those lines. His cytological studies the following year showed that A.bradleyi was an allotetraploid, the product of hybridization between A.montanum and A.platyneuron to form a sterile diploid, followed by chromosome doubling that restored fertility.|$|E
