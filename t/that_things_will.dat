25|$|Atli {{discusses}} matters with Guðrún. She {{tells him}} <b>that</b> <b>things</b> <b>will</b> go badly for him unless he kills her too. He tries to console her by promising precious gifts and she pretends to relent, asking Atli {{for a great}} ale-feast to commemorate her brothers. Guðrún then kills their two sons and has the unsuspecting Atli use their heads as drinking vessels and eat their roasted hearts. Later Guðrún kills Atli {{with the aid of}} Hniflungr, son of Högni. The final part of the poem consists of exchanges between Guðrún and Atli. Guðrún recalls her glorious past when she went harrying with Sigurðr and her brothers. Atli recalls his marriage proposal to Guðrún and how she was never content in their marriage, despite all their riches. In the end he asks Guðrún to give him an honorable burial and she agrees. She then attempts suicide and fails. The poem ends on a note that any man who begets such offspring as Gjúki's is fortunate.|$|E
500|$|Green is {{the color}} most {{commonly}} associated in the U.S. and Europe with springtime, freshness, and hope. Green {{is often used to}} symbolize rebirth and renewal and immortality. [...] In Ancient Egypt; the god Osiris, king of the underworld, was depicted as green-skinned. Green as the color of hope is connected with the color of springtime; hope represents the faith <b>that</b> <b>things</b> <b>will</b> improve after a period of difficulty, like the renewal of flowers and plants after the winter season.|$|E

After the pleasantries, Lisa {{finds herself}} at home alongside the Mensa members, whose {{sense of humor}} is so esoteric that {{it is said to}} be enjoyed by the [...] "Dennis Miller ratio" [...] of Americans. After being bullied out of their reserved gazebo at a park by drunks and Chief Wiggum, they fear that Springfield's quality is poor because of the city's stupidest residents having power over their civic institutions. The Mensa group goes to confront Mayor Quimby about the gazebo incident, until he escapes from the city when he mistakenly thinks the group has evidence about his corruption. The town's constitution states that {{in the absence of the}} mayor, the town is to be governed by the smartest by geniocracy. Now in control of Springfield, the group hopes <b>that</b> <b>things</b> <b>will</b> become much better.|$|E
500|$|Diana Steenbergen of IGN {{also criticized}} John for {{his lack of}} explanation, feeling that [...] "it is not exactly easy to watch John treat Dean and Sam so dismissively, {{especially}} {{after they have been}} nearly killing themselves all season to find him". However, Steenbergen praised Morgan for his acting, writing, [...] "Even though he is used sparingly throughout the series, Jeffrey Dean Morgan is always effective as John." [...] She also felt that he brought [...] "emotional weight" [...] to the character, allowing the audience to [...] "feel John's weariness, and his resignation <b>that</b> <b>things</b> <b>will</b> most likely not go well". While Brian Tallerico of UGO enjoyed Morgan's performance, he was happy that the character was killed off because John's presence made Sam and Dean into [...] "followers" [...] that were [...] "merely existing in the wake of their father". With their father gone, the brothers are no longer prevented from [...] "heading up the battle with the other side".|$|E

Metcalfe went onto tease <b>that</b> <b>things</b> <b>will</b> get [...] "darker" [...] for her character. Mercedes became depressed and her sister Jacqui decided to help her. Mercedes attempted to seduce Jacqui's husband Rhys Ashworth (Andrew Moss), who told Jacqui. Cooper said Jacqui [...] "knows what state of mind" [...] Mercedes was in and [...] "lays into" [...] Mercedes, who revealed she has been working as a prostitute. Cooper explained Jacqui's reaction is [...] "pretty harsh" [...] and that she thought Mercedes was a [...] "promiscuous tart and a pathetic excuse for a woman" [...] with [...] "no morals". Cooper said Jacqui had [...] "given Mercedes chance after chance, and feels that she doesn't deserve anything more".|$|E

500|$|In {{regards to}} the miniseries' cynosural song [...] "Everything Stays", Nyström {{revealed}} that, during the storyboarding of the episode of the same name, she found herself unable to write a lullaby for the scene between Marceline and her mother. She relayed her issue to Muto, who contacted Sugar {{and asked if she}} would be willing to pen the song. Sugar agreed and based the song on an incident in which she lost a stuffed animal in a garden. A year later, she found it; the sun had bleached the exposed surfaces, but the underside was still the same. She explained, [...] " [...] wasn’t better, or worse, just different. It was the first time I realized <b>that</b> <b>things</b> <b>will</b> change no matter what, even if they’re left alone, and stay completely still." [...] Muto was excited to have Sugar return to work on the show, and noted at the 2015 Adventure Time San Diego Comic-Con International panel that [...] "because [...] was a Marceline miniseries, it wouldn't really feel complete unless Rebecca Sugar wrote a song for it." [...] At San Diego Comic-Con, Sugar and Olson performed the song live.|$|E
500|$|While {{watching}} the local news, {{it is also}} discovered that former President George W. Bush, who has lost the 2004 election, has returned to Texas which has seceded from the United States, {{along with the rest}} of the southern United States, reforming the Confederate States of America, resulting in a second Civil War. Brian insists <b>that</b> <b>things</b> <b>will</b> still be better in the end, but when they travel five years into the future they find a computer generated post-apocalyptic future caused by nuclear attacks all across the United States which results in the deaths of over 17 million people (including Cesar Millan much to Brian's horror). Admitting that he made a mistake, Brian asks how the situation can be resolved. The two then return to prevent Brian from telling his past self about the attacks. They then return to the present, whereupon Stewie learns that Brian has taken false credit for the Harry Potter series. Seeing that Brian has learned nothing from his warnings, Stewie says they have to repair this by again trying to prevent themselves from telling any future events. This causes hundreds of Stewies and Brians to appear, however, to prevent them from telling the future. This number includes one Brian and Stewie with their Peter who says he [...] "just came for the can", another Brian and Stewie trapped in barber shop twirls, one Brian and Stewie dressed up in their banana outfits, and a Stewie who arrives with his Brian whose throat is slit. Having had enough of this, one Stewie tells all of his and his Brian's numerous future selves to decide whether or not to prevent 9/11, which results in the majority saying no, not to for tell any future events, and to return to their time and stay there. All the Brians and Stewies do it as they are told. From there, Stewie takes Brian back a minute before their past selves arrive and forces them at gunpoint to return to their time. After initial confusion resulting with the Brian that just arrived being shot in the leg, they comply. With that, the altered timeline ceases to exist along with its corresponding Stewie and Brian.|$|E
500|$|Dale's {{death was}} adulated by commentators, who affirmed {{that it was}} a gruesome and {{emotional}} scene. Scott Meslow of The Atlantic suggested that because of his death, The Walking Dead embraced a more dark and sinister philosophy. He asserted, [...] "Taken broadly, his death marks the death of a certain morality on the show, and the embrace of a philosophy that's something crueler and darker. Dale, unlike any of the other survivors, maintained his humanity to the very end of his waking life—but even he couldn't choose not to come back as something amoral and inhuman. In a world that seems utterly incapable of getting better, it's a none-too-reassuring sign <b>that</b> <b>things</b> <b>will</b> almost certainly get worse." [...] Gina McIntyre of Los Angeles Times echoed synonymous thoughts: [...] "It's left to Daryl to shoot the man to end his suffering, which is profoundly too bad. Without Dale to raise all those nagging concerns about doing what's right, zombie apocalypse or no zombie apocalypse, I fear for the future of this walker-infested world." [...] Handlen and Calgary Herald Kimberly Potts thought {{that it was a}}mong the shocking moments in the series, while Friedman expressed that she was [...] "riveted by the awesome attack [...] and filled with sadness, as the original gang watched their friend die a slow and painful death". Handlen remarked: [...] "It’s a shocking scene, partially for its straight-forward gore, and partially for the astonished, uncomprehending expression on Dale’s face. [...] This, right here, is the kind of sequence the show needs. There’s too little sense of danger right now." [...] Verne Gay of Newsday described the sequence as [...] "violent", and ultimately summated that DeMunn's absence will be felt as the show progresses. However, Lamar professed that the writers should have written off Dale in a more respectable way; [...] "That wasn't the way to off the show's most annoyingly sane character. Dale's redeeming quality was his ability to guilt everybody into paying lip service to rule of law; his weakness was his naïveté. Having an escaping Randall kill him would've offered some poetic symmetry. I'm not going to miss this character, but he deserved a better send-off." [...] Time journalist Nate Rawlings drew allusions from Dale's attack to the episode title, commenting that [...] "when the lone zombie we see in this episode tears open Dale’s stomach, spilling the contents of his body onto the cold ground, we’re reminded that the walkers are the judges, they’re the jury, and this particular one was a most brutal executioner." [...] Although he was shocked by the sequence, Goldman assailed the earlier development of Dale in the episode, opining that he was obnoxious.|$|E

[...] It has also been suggested that dispositional optimism may not be distinct from neuroticism or other dispositional traits. [...] Future research should examine the theory more empirically and provide a distinction of how broad, fundamental, and evaluative a trait must be in order to be included in core self-evaluations research.|$|E
