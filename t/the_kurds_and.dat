5|$|Because if we'd gone to Baghdad {{we would}} have been all alone. There wouldn't have been anybody else with us. There would have been a U.S. {{occupation}} of Iraq. None of the Arab forces that were willing to fight with us in Kuwait were willing to invade Iraq. Once you got to Iraq and took it over, took down Saddam Hussein's government, then {{what are you going to}} put in its place? That's a very volatile part of the world, and if you take down the central government of Iraq, you could very easily end up seeing pieces of Iraq fly off: part of it, the Syrians would like to have to the west, part of it—eastern Iraq—the Iranians would like to claim, they fought over it for eight years. In the north you've got <b>the</b> <b>Kurds,</b> <b>and</b> if the Kurds spin loose and join with the Kurds in Turkey, then you threaten the territorial integrity of Turkey. It's a quagmire if you go that far and try to take over Iraq. The other thing was casualties. Everyone was impressed with the fact we were able to do our job with as few casualties as we had. But for the 146 Americans killed in action, and for their families—it wasn't a cheap war. And the question for the president, in terms of whether or not we went on to Baghdad, took additional casualties in an effort to get Saddam Hussein, was how many additional dead Americans is Saddam worth? Our judgment was, not very many, and I think we got it right.|$|E

40|$|This Bachelor {{dissertation}} {{will focus}} on America’s policy regarding <b>the</b> Iraqi <b>Kurds</b> <b>and</b> their quest for autonomy between 1958 and 1975, {{in the context of}} Washington’s seventeen year-long Cold War competition during these years with the Soviet Union for influence in Iraq. Was foreign policy of the United States towards <b>the</b> Iraqi <b>Kurds</b> contradictory or consistent between 1958 and 1975 ? What factors determined Washington’s policy towards <b>the</b> Iraqi <b>Kurds</b> between 1958 <b>and</b> 1975 ? And what factors caused it to change? These are the main research questions which should provide sufficient insight in Washington’s motives and goals which determined its policy on <b>the</b> Iraqi <b>Kurds,</b> <b>and</b> should explain how that policy finally took shape. First of all, Washington’s main policy interests in relation to <b>the</b> Iraqi <b>Kurds</b> during General Qasim’s regime from 1958 till 1963 will be examined. Second, the main U. S. policy interests regarding <b>the</b> Iraqi <b>Kurds</b> during <b>the</b> Ba’athist regime of 1963 and during the presidencies of the brothers Arif will be investigated. And finally, these same U. S. policy interests will be examined during the Ba’athist regime of President al-Bakr from July 1968, until the 1975 Algiers Agreement between Iran and Iraq. During these three separate periods, this dissertation will also focus on how these U. S. interests were eventually pursued...|$|R

25|$|The Russo-Turkish War of 1877–78 was {{followed}} by the attempt of Sheikh Ubeydullah in 1880–1881 to found an independent Kurd principality under the protection of Turkey. The attempt, at first encouraged by the Porte, as a reply to the projected creation of an Armenian state under the suzerainty of Russia, collapsed after Ubeydullah's raid into Persia, when various circumstances led the central government to reassert its supreme authority. Until the Russo-Turkish War of 1828–1829 there had been little hostile feeling between <b>the</b> <b>Kurds</b> <b>and</b> the Armenians, and as late as 1877–1878 the mountaineers of both races had co-existed fairly well together.|$|E
25|$|In their {{literature}} and writings, the Assyrians of Baghdida remember vividly the raids of the Persians and Kurds on their village and churches. In 1171, while {{the governors of}} Mosul and Damascus were fighting each other, the Kurds used the opportunity to attack the Mar Mattai monastery. According to the 13th century writer Bar Hebraeus, in 1261 the Kurds came down to Mosul, killing many Christians who refused to follow Islam and looting their homes and churches. The Kurds then occupied the nunnery of Naqortaya and killed many of the nuns and others who had sought refuge there. In 1288 a battle took place between <b>the</b> <b>Kurds</b> <b>and</b> Tatars near Baghdida. In 1324 Baghdida was attacked by the Kurds again and many homes and four churches were burned. In 1742 the Afsharids led by Nadir Shah plundered and looted the whole region of Mosul Vilayet, including many Christian villages.|$|E
25|$|The Hakkari {{region was}} the main center of Assyrian {{population}} in early 20th century. According to the Armenian Patriarch of Constantinople, there were 18,000 Assyrians in Van Vilayet, 15,000 in Bitlis Vilayet and 25,000 in Diyarbekir Vilayet in 1912/1913. In 1914, Young Turks {{with the aid of}} <b>the</b> <b>Kurds</b> <b>and</b> other Muslim ethnic groups, began to systemically target the ancient indigenous Christian communities of Asia Minor, primarily composed of Armenians, Assyrians, Greeks and to a small degree Georgians. Events such as the Assyrian Genocide, Greek Genocide and Armenian Genocide followed, as did the similarly motivated Great Famine of Mount Lebanon which targeted Maronite Christians. In the beginning, key Assyrian nationalist leaders and religious figures were wiped out of communities, followed by the systematic massacre and ethnic cleansing by the Turks, Arabs, Kurds, Chechens and Circassians {{of hundreds of thousands of}} unarmed men, women and children.|$|E

25|$|In 1973, the US made {{a secret}} {{agreement}} with the Shah of Iran to begin covertly funding Kurdish rebels against Bagdad through the Central Intelligence Agency and in collaboration with Mossad, both {{of which would be}} active in the country through the launch of the Iraqi invasion and into the present. By 1974, the Iraqi government retaliated with a new offensive against <b>the</b> <b>Kurds</b> <b>and</b> pushed them close to the border with Iran. Iraq informed Tehran that it was willing to satisfy other Iranian demands in return for an end to its aid to the Kurds. With mediation by Algerian President Houari Boumediene, Iran and Iraq reached a comprehensive settlement in March 1975 known as the Algiers Pact. The agreement left the Kurds helpless and Tehran cut supplies to the Kurdish movement. Barzani went to Iran with many of his supporters. Others surrendered en masse and the rebellion ended after a few days.|$|E
