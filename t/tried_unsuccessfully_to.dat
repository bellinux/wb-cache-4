5|$|The {{proposed}} constitution (co-written by the Queen and two legislators, Joseph Nāwahī and William Pūnohu White) {{would have}} restored {{the power to}} the monarchy, and voting rights to economically disenfranchised native Hawaiians and Asians. Her ministers, and closest friends, were all opposed to this plan; they <b>tried</b> <b>unsuccessfully</b> <b>to</b> dissuade her from pursuing these initiatives, both of which came to be used against her in the brewing constitutional crisis.|$|E
5|$|After their {{defeat the}} Royalists {{effectively}} abandoned Northern England, losing {{much of the}} manpower from the northern counties of England (which were strongly Royalist in sympathy) and also losing access to the European continent through the ports on the North Sea coast. Although they partially retrieved their fortunes with victories {{later in the year}} in Southern England, the loss of the north was to prove a fatal handicap the next year, when they <b>tried</b> <b>unsuccessfully</b> <b>to</b> link up with the Scottish Royalists under the Marquess of Montrose.|$|E

5|$|On March 7, Prince William of Wied {{arrived in}} Albania, and intense {{fighting}} occurred north of Gjirokastër, {{in the region}} of Cepo, in an attempt to take control over Northern Epirus; Albanian gendarmerie units <b>tried</b> <b>unsuccessfully</b> <b>to</b> infiltrate southwardly, facing resistance from the Epirotes. On March 11, a provisional settlement was brokered in Corfu by Dutch Colonel Thomson. Albania was prepared to accept a limited Northern Epirote government, but Karapanos insisted on complete autonomy, a condition rejected by the Albanian delegates, and negotiations reached a deadlock. Meanwhile, Epirote bands entered Erseka and continued on to Frashër and Korçë.|$|E
5|$|The Indian Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore, {{a strong}} {{supporter}} of Pan-Asianism, met Japanese premier Count Terauchi and Count Okuma, a former premier, in an attempt to enlist support for the Ghadarite movement. Tarak Nath Das urged Japan to align with Germany, on the grounds that American war preparation could actually be directed against Japan. Later in 1915, Abani Mukherji— a Jugantar activist and associate of Rash Behari Bose— is also known to have <b>tried</b> <b>unsuccessfully</b> <b>to</b> arrange for arms from Japan.|$|E
5|$|When Karl Alexander died suddenly, Oppenheimer {{was arrested}} and accused of various things, {{including}} fraud, embezzlement, treason, lecherous relations with the court ladies, accepting bribes, and trying to reestablish Catholicism. The Jewish community <b>tried</b> <b>unsuccessfully</b> <b>to</b> ransom him. After a heavily publicized trial during which no proofs were produced, {{he was sentenced to}} death. When his jailers demanded that he convert to Christianity, he refused. Joseph Süß Oppenheimer was led to the gallows on 4 February 1738, and given a final chance to convert to Christianity, which he refused to do.|$|E

Jardine and his wife initially lived in Kensington but moved to Reading {{after the birth of}} their first child, daughter Fianach. A second daughter, Marion, followed but the family suffered from financial worries. Jardine, as well as working in journalism, earned money from playing bridge. The family also <b>tried</b> <b>unsuccessfully</b> <b>to</b> engage in market gardening. To make more money, Jardine became a salesman with Cable & Wireless before working for a coal mining company in the late 1930s. In 1939, he returned to cricket journalism and according to Christopher Douglas, achieved his highest standard as a writer.|$|E
5|$|Cheney campaigned against Al Gore's running mate, Joseph Lieberman, in the 2000 presidential {{election}}. While {{the election}} was undecided, the Bush-Cheney team was not eligible for public funding to plan a transition to a new administration. So, Cheney opened a privately funded transition office in Washington. This office worked to identify candidates for all important positions in the cabinet. According to Craig Unger, Cheney advocated Donald Rumsfeld for the post of Secretary of Defense to counter the influence of Colin Powell at the State Department, and <b>tried</b> <b>unsuccessfully</b> <b>to</b> have Paul Wolfowitz named to replace George Tenet {{as director of the}} Central Intelligence Agency.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{his years}} in the Philippines, Taft was keenly {{interested}} as president in East Asian affairs. Taft considered relations with Europe relatively unimportant, {{but because of the}} potential for trade and investment, Taft ranked the post of minister to China as most important in the Foreign Service. Knox did not agree, and declined a suggestion that he go to Peking to view the facts on the ground. Taft considered Roosevelt's minister there, William W. Rockhill, as uninterested in the China trade, and replaced him with William J. Calhoun, whom McKinley and Roosevelt had sent on several foreign missions. Knox did not listen to Calhoun on policy, and there were often conflicts. Taft and Knox <b>tried</b> <b>unsuccessfully</b> <b>to</b> extend John Hay's Open Door Policy to Manchuria.|$|E

5|$|During high school, Barbera {{worked as}} a tailor's {{delivery}} boy. During the Great Depression, he <b>tried</b> <b>unsuccessfully</b> <b>to</b> become a cartoonist for a magazine called The NY Hits Magazine. He supported himself with {{a job at a}} bank, and continued to pursue publication for his cartoons. His magazine drawings of single cartoons, not comic strips, began to be published in Redbook, Saturday Evening Post, and Collier's—the magazine with which he had the most success. Barbera also wrote to Walt Disney for advice on getting started in the animation industry. Disney wrote back, saying he would call Barbera during an upcoming trip to New York, but the call never took place.|$|E
5|$|In 1875, Goldfaden {{headed for}} Munich, {{intending}} to study medicine. This {{did not work}} out, and he headed for Lvov/Lemberg in Galicia, where he again met up with Linetsky, now editor of a weekly paper, Isrulik or Der Alter Yisrulik (which was well reputed, but was soon shut by the government). A year later, {{he moved on to}} Chernivtsi in Bukovina, where he edited the Yiddish-language daily Dos Bukoviner Israelitishe Folksblatt. The limits of the economic sense of this enterprise can be gauged from his inability to pay a registration fee of 3000 ducats. He <b>tried</b> <b>unsuccessfully</b> <b>to</b> operate the paper under a different name, but soon moved on to Iaşi on the invitation of Isaac Librescu (1850–1930), a young wealthy communitary activist interested in theatre.|$|E
5|$|In 1983, Sounds President Larry Schmittou {{noticed a}} 5%drop in season ticket sales, a higher ratio of no-shows from season ticket holders, {{and a slight}} decline in overall attendance. These issues with spectator turnout were {{accompanied}} by a decline in local media coverage, particularly in regard to road games. In order to boost interest in the team, Schmittou <b>tried,</b> <b>unsuccessfully,</b> <b>to</b> purchase a Triple-A franchise late in the 1983 season. His desire to land a Triple-A team {{was part of a}} larger plan to put Nashville in a position to contend for a major league franchise in the future. Attendance continued to drop in 1984, as season ticket sales were down 12% and overall attendance was down almost 20%.|$|E

5|$|Lieutenant-General William Birdwood, {{commanding}} the inexperienced Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC), comprising the Australian Division and two brigades of the New Zealand and Australian Division, {{was ordered to}} conduct an amphibious assault {{on the western side}} of the Gallipoli Peninsula. The New Zealand and Australian Division normally also had two mounted brigades assigned to it, but these had been left in Egypt, as it was believed there would be no requirement or opportunities to use mounted troops on the peninsula. To bring the division up to strength, Hamilton had <b>tried</b> <b>unsuccessfully</b> <b>to</b> get a brigade of Gurkhas attached to them. In total ANZAC strength was 30,638 men.|$|E

In September 2011, Lin played a few games for the Chinese Basketball Association (CBA) club Dongguan Leopards at the ABA Club Championship in Guangzhou, China, where he was named the MVP of the tournament. Shanghai Sharks president and former NBA star Yao Ming also <b>tried,</b> <b>unsuccessfully,</b> <b>to</b> sign Lin for the upcoming CBA season; Lin explained that as someone still under contract with the Golden State Warriors, he could not play in the CBA as the league would only admit NBA free agents. A {{few days before the}} lockout was lifted on November 26, Lin had been close to signing with an undisclosed club in Italy.|$|E
5|$|Midas is a verse {{drama in}} blank verse by the Romantic writers Mary Shelley and Percy Bysshe Shelley. Mary wrote the drama and Percy contributed two lyric poems to it. Written in 1820 while the Shelleys {{were living in}} Italy, Mary Shelley <b>tried</b> <b>unsuccessfully</b> <b>to</b> have the play {{published}} by children's magazines in England in the 1830s; however, it was not published until A. Koszul's 1922 scholarly edition. Whether or not the drama was ever meant to be staged {{is a point of}} debate among scholars. The play combines the stories of the musical contest between Apollo and Pan and that of King Midas and his ability to turn everything he touches to gold.|$|E
