5|$|As a United States {{district}} court, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri conducts civil {{trials and}} issues orders. The cases it hears concern either federal question jurisdiction, where {{a federal law}} or <b>treaty</b> <b>is</b> applicable, or diversity jurisdiction, where parties are domiciled in different states. The court also holds criminal trials of persons charged with violations of federal law. Appeals from cases brought in the Eastern District of Missouri are heard by the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit (except for patent claims and claims against the U.S. government under the Tucker Act, which are appealed to the Federal Circuit). These cases can then be appealed to the United States Supreme Court.|$|E
5|$|At first, Hitler rebuffed Soviet {{diplomatic}} {{hints that}} Stalin desired a treaty; but in early August 1939, Hitler authorised Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop to begin serious negotiations. A trade agreement was concluded on 18 August; and on 22 August, Ribbentrop flew to Moscow to conclude a formal non-aggression treaty. Although the <b>treaty</b> <b>is</b> {{known as the}} Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, it was Stalin and Hitler, and not Molotov and Ribbentrop, who decided {{the content of the}} treaty.|$|E

5|$|Complicating {{the account}} of this period {{is the issue of}} the Peace of Callias, which {{allegedly}} ended hostilities between the Greeks and the Persians. The very existence of the <b>treaty</b> <b>is</b> hotly disputed, and its particulars and negotiation are ambiguous. Ernst Badian believes that a peace between Athens and Persia was first ratified in 463 BC (making the Athenian interventions in Egypt and Cyprus violations of the peace), and renegotiated {{at the conclusion of the}} campaign in Cyprus, taking force again by 449–448BC.|$|E
5|$|One of the Prussian playing-for-time {{requests}} to the Patriotic Party was {{that before the}} <b>treaty</b> <b>is</b> signed, {{they need to see}} more reforms within the Commonwealth government. In October 1789, the changing international situation (primarily the military defeats of the Ottoman Empire) suddenly and temporarily increased the value of an alliance with Poland for Prussia. In the meantime, the previously anti-royalist Patriotic Party has begun drifting closer to the king. In February and March 1790, concrete proposals were exchanged between Warsaw and Berlin. Some difficulties were centered around Prussian demands for the cession of Gdańsk and Toruń, and tariffs, but a threat of a Polish-Austrian alliance, recently brought forward by Austria, caused Prussia to withdraw most of the demands the Polish side was finding difficult to accept.|$|E
5|$|During his voyage, Cook also visited New Zealand, first {{discovered}} by Dutch explorer Abel Tasman in 1642, and claimed the North and South islands for the British crown in 1769 and 1770 respectively. Initially, {{interaction between the}} indigenous Māori population and Europeans {{was limited to the}} trading of goods. European settlement increased through {{the early decades of the}} 19th century, with numerous trading stations established, especially in the North. In 1839, the New Zealand Company announced plans to buy large tracts of land and establish colonies in New Zealand. On 6 February 1840, Captain William Hobson and around 40 Maori chiefs signed the Treaty of Waitangi. This <b>treaty</b> <b>is</b> considered by many to be New Zealand's founding document, but differing interpretations of the Maori and English versions of the text have meant that it continues to be a source of dispute.|$|E
50|$|The Nepal-Britain <b>Treaty</b> of 1923 <b>is</b> {{considered}} {{to be one of}} the most important treaties in the History of Nepal. The <b>treaty</b> <b>was</b> first discussed in 1921 and the final <b>treaty</b> <b>was</b> signed in 1923 December 21 in Singha Durbar. The <b>treaty</b> <b>was</b> the first to define the international status of Nepal as an independent and a sovereign country and is {{considered to}} be “A great achievement of 25 years of Chandra Shumsher's diplomacy”. The <b>treaty</b> <b>was</b> recorded in 1925 in the League of Nations.|$|R

5|$|Twelve years later, the Kingsglaive {{fight to}} protect Lucis's borders from attacks by Niflheim's Magitek army and Daemons, unnatural monsters tamed for {{military}} use. During one such operation, Nyx Ulric defies his orders to withdraw to rescue his friend Libertus from a Daemon. Regis, whose magic powers the Wall and is growing weaker due to advancing age, accepts Imperial Chancellor Ardyn Izunia's offer of peace. This causes dissension among the Kingsglaive, who feel Regis is abandoning their families. Two {{days before the}} <b>treaty</b> <b>is</b> to be signed, Kingsglaive member Crowe is sent {{on a mission to}} escort Lunafreya to Lucis, but is killed en route. Her death causes Libertus to leave the Kingsglaive and join a group of Lucian rebels. At a party dedicated to the signing of the treaty, attended by both Regis and Niflheim's emperor Iedolas Aldercapt, Lunafreya meets with Nyx before being secretly abducted by Glauca. Nyx discovers this and finds that Niflheim has stationed their army outside Insomnia.|$|E
5|$|Opinion amongst modern historians is also split; for instance, Fine {{accepts the}} concept of the Peace of Callias, whereas Sealey {{effectively}} rejects it. Holland accepts that some kind of accommodation was made between Athens and Persia, but no actual treaty. Fine argues that Callisthenes's denial that a treaty was made after the Eurymedon does not preclude a peace being made at another point. Further, he suggests that Theopompus was actually referring to a treaty that had allegedly been negotiated with Persia in 423 BC. If these views are correct, it would remove one major obstacle to the acceptance of the treaty's existence. A further argument for the existence of the <b>treaty</b> <b>is</b> the sudden withdrawal of the Athenians from Cyprus in 449 BC, which Fine suggests makes most sense in the light of some kind of peace agreement. On the other hand, if there was indeed some kind of accommodation, Thucydides's failure to mention it is odd. In his digression on the pentekontaetia, his aim is to explain the growth of Athenian power, and such a treaty, {{and the fact that the}} Delian allies were not released from their obligations after it, would have marked a major step in the Athenian ascendancy. Conversely, it has been suggested that certain passages elsewhere in Thucydides's history are best interpreted as referring to a peace agreement. There is thus no clear consensus amongst modern historians as to the treaty's existence.|$|E

50|$|Three {{treaties}} {{resulted from}} the council. The first <b>treaty</b> <b>was</b> signed October 21, 1867, with the Kiowa and Comanche tribes. The second, with the Kiowa-Apache, was signed the same day. The third <b>treaty</b> <b>was</b> signed with the Southern Cheyenne and Arapaho on October 28. Although provisions of the <b>treaties</b> <b>were</b> to be later violated by the United States, the tribes which signed the <b>treaty</b> <b>were</b> able to win a number of court cases against the United States government in the 20th Century.|$|R

5000|$|The <b>treaties</b> <b>are</b> {{endlessly}} disputed for {{a number}} of reasons and have been subject to numerous court cases.

50|$|The <b>treaty</b> <b>was</b> {{asked by}} Skanderbeg {{in order to}} ensure {{protection}} from the Ottoman Empire. Although the party on the <b>treaty</b> <b>was</b> Alfonso V himself, the <b>treaty</b> <b>was</b> signed by his main notery, Arnaldo Fonolleda. The ambassadors of Skanderbeg were respectively two bishops: Stefan was an orthodox bishop and de Berguçi was a Catholic Dominican bishop.|$|R
50|$|In 1850, another <b>treaty</b> <b>was</b> {{signed in}} San Saba, between the United States {{government}} {{and a number of}} local tribes, among which were the Comanches.

50|$|The <b>treaty</b> <b>was</b> {{signed for}} Persia by Crown Prince Abbas Mirza and Allah-Yar Khan Asaf al-Daula, {{chancellor}} to Shah Fath Ali (of the Qajar Dynasty), and for Russia by General Ivan Paskievich.

Some commentators have argued that the treaty remains essentially incomprehensible in the absence of such a compendium.|$|E
25|$|The Pangkor Treaty of 1874 was {{a treaty}} signed between the British and the Sultan of Perak. Signed on 20 January 1874, on the HMS Pluto, {{anchored}} {{off the island}} of Pangkor (off the coast of Perak), the <b>treaty</b> <b>is</b> significant {{in the history of}} the Malay states as it legitimized British control of the Malay rulers and paved the way for British imperialism in Malaya.|$|E
25|$|As noted above, Coast Salish did {{not have}} {{permanent}} political offices or formal political institutions that were understood by Whites.

50|$|The Harmand <b>treaty</b> <b>was</b> {{eventually}} {{replaced by}} a new Treaty of Huế, signed on 6 June 1884.
