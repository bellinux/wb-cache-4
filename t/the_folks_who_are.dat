It is fifteen years since she came here one summer to board. She was a child of {{thirteen}} then, and hadn't any relations except an old uncle who sent her to school in winter and boarded her out in summer, and didn't care a rap about her. The child was just starving for love, Jordan, and she got it here. William and his brothers were just children then, and they hadn't any sister. We all just worshipped her. She was so sweet, Jordan. And pretty, oh my! {{like a little girl}} in a picture, with great long curls, all black and purply and fine as spun silk, and big dark eyes, and such pink cheeks--real wild rose cheeks. And sing! My land! But couldn't she sing! Always singing, every hour of the day that voice was ringing round the old place. I used to hold my breath to hear it. She always said that she meant to be a famous singer some day, and I never doubted it a mite. It was born in her. Sunday evening she used to sing hymns for us. Oh, Jordan, it makes my old heart young again to remember it. A sweet child she was, my little Joscelyn! She used to write me for three or four years after she went away, but I haven't heard a word from her for long and long. I daresay she has forgotten me, as Maria says. 'Twouldn't be any wonder.

40|$|The word {{seems to}} be coming down from Washington these days that it's time to declare victory in the war on the Digital Divide and find new targets for our public policy discussions and interventions. <b>The</b> <b>folks</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> saying this are looking at {{statistics}} in this country, the United States, that are showing that well over half of all households have access to the Internet, that the proportion of minorities and low-income people who have access to the Internet is increasing overall, and that the cost of Internet access including the cost of the computer to enable the access seems to have come down to a level affordable by most. Parallel developments in many {{other parts of the world}} are likely. Also in the United States, a rising proportion of minority and lower-income populations using the Internet have relieved some of the early anxiety that existing social inequalities would be aggravated in this new and rapidly expanding sphere. Public authorities are being urged to relax and let the market continue what appears to be the inexorable drive to more or less universal Internet access (with all those wanting access having access). This argument leads to an emerging position that there is no need to fund development of local technology projects or for public Internet access through community technology centers, which in other countries would be called telecenters, telekiosks, telepublicos, and so on...|$|E
40|$|A common {{assumption}} in {{the political}} economy literature holds that people’s preferences on trade policy reflect the objective economic effects market openness has on them; those who gain from free trade support it, and those adversely affected by it oppose it. This paper studies {{the characteristics of the}} self-perceived losers from globalization and offers an alternative account that puts this assumption into question. I argue that many individuals view free trade as an inseparable component of a wider openness ‘package’, which also includes social and cultural dimensions. Peoples ’ sense of loss from free trade therefore reflects, to a large extent, anxiety about non-economic cultural changes they associate with increased market openness. Using survey data from 44 countries, the paper offers an empirical test of the argument. The analysis also helps explain the often-observed anomaly of the support, by economic losers from free trade, of pro-trade yet socially conservative parties. 2 ”The representatives of the World Bank had better listen to us … The World Bank and IMF and the transnationals must stop looting our natural resources, and stop privatizing basic services… They must respect human life”- Evo Morales, Bolivia’s leading presidential candidate (November 2003) “We need a president who will change the trade policy of this country.

The uprising of the Commons, as they called themselves--that is to say, chiefly <b>the</b> <b>folk</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> still kept in a state of serfdom in the reign of Richard II.--was in itself justifiable.

When in 1809 Finland became an autonomous grand-duchy within the Russian empire, there was a university, the Turku (Åbo) Academy, founded in 1640, a Lutheran church using the vernacular, and a judicial system, whose judges were not in practice required to speak Finnish (Danielsson...|$|R
