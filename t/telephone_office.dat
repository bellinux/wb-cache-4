500|$|In 1909, after Heinze {{abandoned}} his properties in Basin, the Butte and Superior Mining Company used buildings and machinery {{at the site}} of the Basin Reduction Works to treat zinc ore by a new process called froth flotation. Sued for patent infringement, the company shut down its Basin plant in 1912. Max Atwater, a mining engineer who had worked for Butte and Superior, obtained a license for the process and ran a smaller zinc-extraction plant in Basin from 1914 through 1918. His wife, Mary Meigs Atwater, described Basin as [...] "a mining camp, subject to recurring periods of [...] boom and bust... A tiny <b>telephone</b> <b>office</b> and a drugstore died with the end of our era of boom... Just above the town were the headframe of our mine, and the old mill, and the never-quite-finished skeleton of a projected smelter." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ruby toured with Mildred {{during the}} summers of 1916 and 1917, and practiced her sister's {{routines}} backstage. Watching the movies of Pearl White, whom Ruby idolized, also influenced her drive to be a performer. At {{the age of}} 14, she {{dropped out of school}} to take a job wrapping packages at a department store in Brooklyn. Ruby never attended high school, [...] "although early biographical thumbnail sketches had her attending Brooklyn's famous Erasmus Hall High School." [...] Soon afterward, she took a job filing cards at the Brooklyn <b>telephone</b> <b>office</b> for $14 a week, which allowed her to become financially independent. She disliked both jobs; her real goal was to enter show business, even as her sister Mildred discouraged the idea. She then took a job cutting dress patterns for Vogue magazine, but because customers complained about her work, she was fired. Her next job was as a typist for the Jerome H. Remick Music Company, a job she reportedly enjoyed. However, her continuing ambition was to work in show business, and her sister finally gave up trying to dissuade her.|$|E

60|$|They {{remembered to}} have passed along this road before, that afternoon, {{on their way}} home from town. At that time they had seen no sign of the nurses or the baby. But to make {{assurance}} doubly sure Arthur stopped at every house to make inquiries and the road was inspected carefully. When they reached town they first visited the local police station and then the <b>telephone</b> <b>office.</b> Here they arranged to have every ranch house within a wide radius called and questioned in regard to the missing baby. Arthur also tried to get his own house, but the wire was still out of service.|$|E
60|$|So they rested, {{and then}} {{they went to the}} public dining-room and dined, and then he started on his search for employment. But they soon {{realised}} that in the matter of one convenience the world was just as badly off as it had ever been, and that was a nice, secure, honourable, remunerative employment, leaving ample leisure for the private life, and demanding no special ability, no violent exertion nor risk, and no sacrifice of any sort for its attainment. He evolved a number of brilliant projects, and spent many days hurrying from one part of the enormous city to another in search of influential friends; and all his influential friends were glad to see him, and very sanguine until it came to definite proposals, {{and then they}} became guarded and vague. He would part with them coldly, and think over their behaviour, and get irritated on his way back, and stop at some <b>telephone</b> <b>office</b> and spend money on an animated but unprofitable quarrel. And as the days passed, he got so worried and irritated that even to seem kind and careless before Elizabeth cost him an effort--as she, being a loving woman, perceived very clearly.|$|E
60|$|Next day I {{went up to}} the <b>telephone</b> <b>office</b> {{and found}} that the king had passed through two towns that were on the line. I spotted his {{progress}} on the succeeding day in the same way. I kept these matters to myself. The third day's reports showed that if he kept up his gait he would arrive by four in the afternoon. There was still no sign anywhere of interest in his coming; {{there seemed to be no}} preparations making to receive him in state; a strange thing, truly. Only one thing could explain this: that other magician had been cutting under me, sure. This was true. I asked a friend of mine, a monk, about it, and he said, yes, the magician had tried some further enchantments and found out that the court had concluded to make no journey at all, but stay at home. Think of that! Observe how much a reputation was worth in such a country. These people had seen me do the very showiest bit of magic in history, and the only one within their memory that had a positive value, and yet here they were, ready to take up with an adventurer who could offer no evidence of his powers but his mere unproven word.|$|E
