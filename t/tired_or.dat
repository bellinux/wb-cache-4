25|$|Gastrointestinal {{bleeding}} (GI bleed), {{also known}} as gastrointestinal hemorrhage, is all forms of bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract, from the mouth to the rectum. When there is significant blood loss over a short time, symptoms may include vomiting red blood, vomiting black blood, bloody stool, or black stool. Small amounts of bleeding over a long time may cause iron-deficiency anemia resulting in feeling <b>tired</b> <b>or</b> heart-related chest pain. Other symptoms may include abdominal pain, shortness of breath, pale skin, or passing out. Sometimes in those with small amounts of bleeding no symptoms may be present.|$|E
25|$|The {{sensitive}} caregiver responds socially to {{attempts to}} initiate social interaction, playfully to {{his attempts to}} initiate play. She picks him up when he seems to wish it, and puts him down {{when he wants to}} explore. When he is distressed, she knows what kinds and degree of soothing he requires to comfort him – and she knows that sometimes a few words or a distraction will be all that is needed. On the other hand, the mother who responds inappropriately tries to socialize with the baby when he is hungry, play with him when he is <b>tired,</b> <b>or</b> feed him when he is trying to initiate social interaction.|$|E

25|$|There {{are many}} other little tactics used {{in the game of}} hockey. Cycling moves the puck along the boards in the {{offensive}} zone to create a scoring chance by making defenders <b>tired</b> <b>or</b> moving them out of position. Pinching is when a defenceman pressures the opposition's winger in the offensive zone when they are breaking out, attempting to stop their attack and keep the puck in the offensive zone. A saucer pass is a pass used when an opposition's stick or body is in the passing lane. It is the act of raising the puck over the obstruction and having it land on a teammate's stick.|$|E
25|$|Rip {{currents}} are water {{channels that}} flow {{away from the}} shore. Under the wrong circumstances these currents can endanger both experienced and inexperienced surfers. Since a rip current {{appears to be an}} area of flat water, <b>tired</b> <b>or</b> inexperienced swimmers or surfers may enter one and be carried out beyond the breaking waves. Although many rip currents are much smaller, the largest rip currents have a width of forty or fifty feet. However, by paddling parallel to the shore, a surfer can easily exit a rip current. Alternatively, some surfers actually ride on a rip current because it is a fast and effortless way to get out beyond the zone of breaking waves.|$|E
25|$|By {{the time}} {{those who have}} DSPD seek medical help, they usually have tried many times to change their {{sleeping}} schedule. Failed tactics to sleep at earlier times may include maintaining proper sleep hygiene, relaxation techniques, early bedtimes, hypnosis, alcohol, sleeping pills, dull reading, and home remedies. DSPD patients who have tried using sedatives at night often report that the medication makes them feel <b>tired</b> <b>or</b> relaxed, but that it fails to induce sleep. They often have asked family members to help wake them in the morning, or they have used multiple alarm clocks. As the disorder occurs in childhood and is most common in adolescence, it is often the patient's parents who initiate seeking help, after great difficulty waking their child in time for school.|$|E

25|$|In 1561, Kenshin and Shingen {{fought the}} biggest battle they would fight, the fourth battle of Kawanakajima. Kenshin used an ingenious tactic: a special {{formation}} where {{the soldiers in}} the front would switch with their comrades in the rear, {{as those in the}} frontline became <b>tired</b> <b>or</b> wounded. This allowed the tired soldiers to take a break, while the soldiers who had not seen action would fight on the front lines. This was extremely effective and because of this Kenshin nearly defeated Shingen. In Kōyō Gunkan there {{is one of the most}} famous instances of single combat in samurai history; during this battle, Kenshin managed to ride up to Shingen and slashed at him with his sword. Shingen fended off the blows with his iron war fan or tessen. Kenshin failed to finish Shingen off before a Takeda retainer drove him away. Shingen made a counter-attack and the Uesugi army retreated. The result of the fourth battle of Kawanakajima is still uncertain. Many scholars are divided on who the actual victor was, if the battle was actually decisive enough to even declare one, thus is generally considered a draw. It is considered to be the largest casualty battle in the Sengoku period, with loss of estimated 72 percent of Kenshin's army and 62 percent of Shingen's army, but Shingen also lost two of his most important generals during the battle, namely his advisor Yamamoto Kansuke and younger brother Takeda Nobushige. Some more conservative estimates place the casualties around 20 percent.|$|E

500|$|The most {{important}} tenet of attachment {{theory is that}} an infant needs to develop a relationship {{with at least one}} primary caregiver for the child's successful social and emotional development, and in particular for learning how to effectively regulate their feelings.

Writing for Wewomen.com, Carla Cain Walther observed that the series [...] "scoffed at the 'damsel in distress' trope used in action films" [...] by having Kim save Ron [...] "using her ingenuity and strength", reinforcing the idea that girls are capable of helping themselves. Identifying Kim as a postfeminist heroine because she is intelligent {{in addition to being}} [...] "shaped like Barbie" [...] and having a male assistant similar to female executives, The New York Times Julie Salamon joked that [...] "Kim's job seems to be making the world safe for cheerleaders again, following the path forged by Reese Witherspoon in Legally Blonde on behalf of sorority girls." [...] Tor.com's Sarah Gailey observed that while Shego proudly spends much of her time lounging poolside and deciding what she does and does not want to do, Kim is forced [...] "to leap into action regardless of whether she's <b>tired</b> <b>or</b> sad or sick or, heaven forbid, too busy". Bustles Sarah Freymiller wrote that [...] "Kim offers a model for femininity that both bolsters and works against the typical 'high school cheerleader' stereotype", citing cheerleading as an outlet the character chooses willingly. Kim is not a tomboy; Julia Pugachevsky of BuzzFeed credits the series with [...] "show that you could be traditionally feminine and strong at the same time." [...] Conversely, Geek Chic: Smart Women in Popular Culture author S. Inness argued that Kim Possible reinforces that [...] "girls can do anything they choose" [...] but must look a certain way in order to do so since its female character participate in consumerism and normative femininity that its male characters do not, such as shopping and spending much time on their appearance. Inness also felt that show's feminist potential is compromised by the fact that Kim mostly surrounds herself with male companions as opposed to female, [...] "contradict the messages of female solidarity".|$|E
500|$|Despite Fischer's results against Taimanov and Larsen, his {{upcoming}} match against Petrosian seemed a daunting task. Nevertheless, the Soviet government {{was concerned about}} Fischer. [...] "Reporters asked Petrosian whether the match would last the full twelve games... 'It might be possible that I win it earlier,' Petrosian replied", and then stated: [...] "Fischer's [...] wins do not impress me. He is a great chess player but no genius." [...] Petrosian played a strong [...] in the first game, gaining the advantage, but Fischer eventually won the game after Petrosian faltered. This gave Fischer a run of 20 consecutive wins against the world's top players (in the Interzonal and Candidates matches), a winning streak topped only by Steinitz's 25 straight wins in 1873–1882. Petrosian won the second game, finally snapping Fischer's streak. After three consecutive draws, Fischer swept the next four games to win the match 6½–2½ (+5−1=3). Sports Illustrated ran {{an article on the}} match, highlighting Fischer's domination of Petrosian as being due to Petrosian's outdated system of preparation:Fischer's recent record raises the distinct possibility that he has made a breakthrough in modern chess theory. His response to Petrosian's elaborately plotted 11th move in the first game is an example: Russian experts had worked on the variation for weeks, yet when it was thrown at Fischer suddenly, he faced its consequences alone and won by applying simple, classic principles. Upon completion of the match, Petrosian remarked: [...] "After the sixth game Fischer really did become a genius. I on the other hand, either had a breakdown or was <b>tired,</b> <b>or</b> something else happened, but the last three games were no longer chess." [...] "Some experts kept insisting that Petrosian was off form, and that he should have had a plus score {{at the end of the}} sixth game..." [...] to which Fischer replied, [...] "People have been playing against me below strength for fifteen years." [...] Fischer's match results befuddled Botvinnik: [...] "It is hard to talk about Fischer's matches. Since the time that he has been playing them, miracles have begun." [...] "When Petrosian played like Petrosian, Fischer played like a very strong grandmaster, but when Petrosian began making mistakes, Fischer was transformed into a genius." ...|$|E
