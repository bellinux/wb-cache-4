5|$|Individual photons can be {{detected}} by several methods. The classic photomultiplier tube exploits the photoelectric effect: a photon of sufficient energy strikes a metal plate and knocks free an electron, initiating an ever-amplifying avalanche of electrons. Semiconductor charge-coupled device chips use a similar effect: an incident photon generates a charge on a microscopic capacitor that can {{be detected}}. Other detectors such as Geiger counters use the ability of photons <b>to</b> <b>ionize</b> gas molecules contained in the device, causing a detectable change of conductivity of the gas.|$|E

25|$|The matrix {{can be used}} to tune the {{instrument}} <b>to</b> <b>ionize</b> the sample in different ways. As mentioned above, acid-base like reactions are often utilized <b>to</b> <b>ionize</b> the sample, however, molecules with conjugated pi systems, such as naphthalene like compounds, can also serve as an electron acceptor and thus a matrix for MALDI/TOF. This is particularly useful in studying molecules that also possess conjugated pi systems. The most widely used application for these matrices is studying porphyrin like compounds such as chlorophyll. These matrices have been shown to have better ionization patterns that do not result in odd fragmentation patterns or complete loss of side chains. It has also been suggested that conjugated porphryin like molecules can serve as a matrix and cleave themselves eliminating the need for a separate matrix compound.|$|E

25|$|The term matrix-assisted laser {{desorption}} ionization (MALDI) {{was coined}} in 1985 by Franz Hillenkamp, Michael Karas and their colleagues. These {{researchers found that}} the amino acid alanine could be ionized more easily if it was mixed with the amino acid tryptophan and irradiated with a pulsed 266nm laser. The tryptophan was absorbing the laser energy and helping <b>to</b> <b>ionize</b> the non-absorbing alanine. Peptides up to the 2843 Da peptide melittin could be ionized when mixed {{with this kind of}} “matrix”. The breakthrough for large molecule laser desorption ionization came in 1987 when Koichi Tanaka of Shimadzu Corporation and his co-workers used what they called the “ultra fine metal plus liquid matrix method” that combined 30nm cobalt particles in glycerol with a 337nm nitrogen laser for ionization. Using this laser and matrix combination, Tanaka was able <b>to</b> <b>ionize</b> biomolecules as large as the 34,472 Da protein carboxypeptidase-A. Tanaka received one-quarter of the 2002 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for demonstrating that, with the proper combination of laser wavelength and matrix, a protein can be ionized. Karas and Hillenkamp were subsequently able <b>to</b> <b>ionize</b> the 67 kDa protein albumin using a nicotinic acid matrix and a 266nm laser. Further improvements were realized {{through the use of a}} 355nm laser and the cinnamic acid derivatives ferulic acid, caffeic acid and sinapinic acid as the matrix. The availability of small and relatively inexpensive nitrogen lasers operating at 337nm wavelength and the first commercial instruments introduced in the early 1990s brought MALDI to an increasing number of researchers. Today, mostly organic matrices are used for MALDI mass spectrometry.|$|E

25|$|The {{infrared}} light {{that we now}} observe from the galaxy was emitted as ultraviolet radiation {{toward the end of}} an era when the universe was filled with atomic hydrogen, which absorbed at ultraviolet wavelengths. Because the galaxy's own light alone would not have been intense enough <b>to</b> <b>ionize</b> a large region and render it transparent, scientists suspect that a population of smaller, undetected galaxies, contributed to the reionization making UDFy-38135539 visible.|$|E
25|$|A photoabsorbed photon {{transfers}} all {{its energy}} to the electron with which it interacts, thus ionizing the atom to which the electron was bound and producing a photoelectron that is likely <b>to</b> <b>ionize</b> more atoms in its path.

These effects {{can be used for}} elemental detection through X-ray spectroscopy or Auger electron spectroscopy.|$|E
25|$|Nebulae may be {{described}} as matter bounded or radiation bounded. In the former case, {{there is not enough}} matter in the nebula to absorb all the UV photons emitted by the star, and the visible nebula is fully ionized. In the latter case, there are not enough UV photons being emitted by the central star <b>to</b> <b>ionize</b> all the surrounding gas, and an ionization front propagates outward into the circumstellar envelope of neutral atoms.|$|E
40|$|The p 53 {{protein is}} one of the major tumor {{suppressor}} proteins. In response to DNA damage, p 53 is prevented from degradation and accumulates <b>to</b> high levels. <b>Ionizing</b> radiation leads <b>to</b> hypophosphorylation of the p 53 ubiquitin ligase Mdm 2 at sites where phosphorylation is critical for p 53 degradation and to the phosphorylation and activation of Akt/PKB, a kinase that phosphorylates and inhibits GSK- 3. GSK- 3, which normally phosphorylates Mdm 2, is inactivated in response <b>to</b> <b>ionizing</b> radiation. We show that p 53 accumulates in lymphoblasts from patients with the hereditary disorder ataxia telangiectasia in response <b>to</b> <b>ionizing</b> radiation despite the absence of a functional ATM kinase. Also, knockdown of ATR did not prevent p 53 accumulation in response <b>to</b> <b>ionizing</b> radiation. Instead, p 53 stabilization in response <b>to</b> <b>ionizing</b> radiation depended on the inactivation of GSK- 3 and the presence of Akt/PKB. Akt/PKB is a target of DNA-PK, a kinase that is activated after ionizing radiation. Correspondingly, down-regulation of DNA-PK prevented phosphorylation of Akt/PKB and GSK- 3 after ionizing radiation and strongly reduced the accumulation of p 53. We therefore propose a signaling cascade for the regulation of p 53 in response <b>to</b> <b>ionizing</b> radiation that involves activation of DNA-PK and Akt/PKB and inactivation of GSK- 3 and Mdm 2...|$|R

In medical imaging this increased cancer risk is generally greatly outweighed by the benefits of the examination. The ionizing capability of X-rays can be utilized in cancer treatment to kill malignant cells using radiation therapy. It is also used for material characterization using X-ray spectroscopy.|$|E
25|$|Small {{red dwarf}} stars {{conversely}} have small habitable zones wherein planets are in tidal lock—one side always faces {{the star and}} becomes very hot and the other always faces away and becomes very cold—and are also at increased risk of solar flares (see Aurelia) that would tend <b>to</b> <b>ionize</b> the atmosphere and be otherwise inimical to complex life. Rare Earth proponents argue that life therefore cannot arise in such systems and that only central stars that range from F7 to K1 stars are hospitable. Such stars are rare: G type stars such as the Sun (between the hotter F and cooler K) comprise only 9% of the hydrogen-burning stars in the Milky Way.|$|E
25|$|Strobe lights usually use flashtubes {{with energy}} {{supplied}} from a capacitor, an energy storage device {{much like a}} battery, but capable of charging and releasing energy much faster. Recently, some strobe lights {{have been found to}} use rectified mains electricity and no capacitors at all. In a capacitor-based strobe light, the capacitor is charged up to around 300 V. Once the capacitor has been charged, a small amount of power is diverted into a trigger transformer, a small transformer with a high turns ratio. This generates the weak but high voltage spike required <b>to</b> <b>ionize</b> the xenon gas in a flash tube. An arc is created inside the tube, which acts as a bridge for the much bigger pulse to flow down later. Arcs present almost a direct short circuit, allowing the capacitors to quickly release their energy into the arc. This rapidly heats the xenon gas, creating an extremely bright plasma discharge, which is seen as a flash.|$|E

25|$|After a star {{passes through}} the {{asymptotic}} giant branch (AGB) phase, the short planetary nebula phase of stellar evolution begins as gases blow away from the central star at speeds of a few kilometers per second. The central star is the remnant of its AGB progenitor, an electron-degenerate carbon-oxygen core that has lost most of its hydrogen envelope due to mass loss on the AGB. As the gases expand, the central star undergoes a two-stage evolution, first growing hotter as it continues to contract and hydrogen fusion reactions occur in the shell around the core and then slowly cooling when the hydrogen shell is exhausted through fusion and mass loss. In the second phase, it radiates away its energy and fusion reactions cease, as the central star is not heavy enough to generate the core temperatures required for carbon and oxygen to fuse. During the first phase, the central star maintains constant luminosity, {{while at the same}} time it grows ever hotter, eventually reaching temperatures around 100,000K. In the second phase, it cools so much that it does not give off enough ultraviolet radiation <b>to</b> <b>ionize</b> the increasingly distant gas cloud. The star becomes a white dwarf, and the expanding gas cloud becomes invisible to us, ending the planetary nebula phase of evolution. For a typical planetary nebula, about 10,000years passes between its formation and recombination of the star.|$|E
