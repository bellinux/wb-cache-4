Once he had recovered, Verdugo massed some cavalry and completed the Anglo-Dutch defeat by destroying an English troop which, <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>save</b> <b>the</b> flags, fled across a field towards the Niezijl canal. Most of the English flags and all of their artillery were lost.

5|$|Written by Peter Ling & Hazel Adair, {{this story}} {{developed}} out of plans by producer Nathan-Turner {{to create a}} sequel to the 1960s soap opera Compact, entitled Impact. When, after drafting three or four scripts for the proposed Impact, Nathan-Turner informed the pair that plans for the soap had been cancelled, the producer offered {{them the opportunity to}} write for Doctor Who as a form of compensation. A scene breakdown (whittled down from six parts to four) was commissioned on 12 July 1983, but after three months of development on the scripts, during which the story was restructured into two 45-minute episodes, it was ultimately rejected. The plot involves the disappearance of various people on Earth, which leads the Doctor and Peri to the planet Hexagora where the Doctor becomes romantically involved with Queen Zafia who is <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>save</b> <b>the</b> insect race of Hexagora from destruction through a plan to infiltrate and take over Earth.

25|$|During in Huiyang, Holmes {{was under}} the command of Colonel (later Sir) Douglas Clague. He was {{assigned}} to deal with external affairs and to co-operate closely with the guerillas of the East River Column (東江縱隊). With the help from the guerillas, Holmes had organised a number of rescue plans <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>save</b> <b>the</b> prisoners of war from the Japanese concentration camps and had conducted espionage in the Japanese-occupied region. According to the recollection of Paui Tsui, Holmes and his companions once secretly entered Hong Kong and reached the foot of Lion Rock. From the foot of the mountain, he used binoculars to spy the concentration camp far away in To Kwa Wan regardless the potential danger of being discovered by the Japanese. Fortunately, although Holmes was a Westerner, the Japanese had never recognised that the fluent Cantonese speaker was in fact a British. Tsui explained the reason was because Holmes was not huge physically and with the disguise of wearing bamboo hat and grey linen clothing, he just looked the same as a common Chinese farmer. His bravery was appreciated by the British government that he was awarded a Military Cross in early 1943 and was made a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) of the Military Division a few months later. It was rare at that time to be decorated twice in a single year.|$|E
