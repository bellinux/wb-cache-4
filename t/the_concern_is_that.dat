25|$|Imbrication of the rectus muscles over a nonintegrated implant {{traditionally}} {{was thought}} to impart movement to the implant and prosthesis. Like a ball-and-socket joint, when the implant moves, the prosthesis moves. However, because the so-called ball and socket are separated by layers of Tenon’s capsule, imbricated muscles, and conjunctiva, the mechanical efﬁciency of transmission of movement from the implant to the prosthesis is suboptimal. Moreover, <b>the</b> <b>concern</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> imbrication of the recti over nonintegrated implants actually can result in implant migration. The recent myoconjuctival technique of enucleation is an alternative to muscle imbrication.|$|E
25|$|Another {{controversy}} {{concerns the}} fact that most traditional tests of APD use verbal materials. The British Society of Audiology has embraced Moore's (2006) recommendation that tests for APD should assess processing of non-speech sounds. <b>The</b> <b>concern</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> if verbal materials are used to test for APD, then children may fail because of limited language ability. An analogy may be drawn with trying to listen to sounds in a foreign language. It is much harder to distinguish between sounds or to remember a sequence of words in a language you do not know well: the problem is not an auditory one, but rather due to lack of expertise in the language.|$|E
25|$|The National Public Radio investigative {{report on}} Acu-Gen {{predicted}} that parents {{may use the}} Baby Gender Mentor test {{as a basis for}} determining whether to get a sex-selective abortion. KMSP-TV interviewed genetic counselor Dr. Analia Bortz who made the same prediction. <b>The</b> <b>concern</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> learning the sex at such an early point may lead parents to terminate the pregnancy if they were hoping for a baby of the opposite sex to that indicated by the test. Americans United for Life argues that women disappointed by the result of their test would find it easier to have an abortion if they get the results early. They say that women who want to have a specific sex will be learning the results {{at a time when it}} is safer for them to have an abortion, without the complications associated with aborting later in pregnancy.|$|E

30|$|Coulomb’s constant, k = 8.99 × 109 N m 2 C− 2 is {{very small}} and not addressed. <b>The</b> <b>concern</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> for novice science students, it would be needlessly confusing.|$|R
500|$|In June 2008, a major nuclear {{equipment}} supplier, Holtec International, criticized the Department of Energy's safety plan for handling containers of radioactive waste {{before they are}} buried at the proposed Yucca Mountain dump. <b>The</b> <b>concern</b> <b>is</b> <b>that,</b> in an earthquake, the unanchored casks of nuclear waste material awaiting burial at Yucca Mountain could be sent into a [...] "chaotic melee of bouncing and rolling juggernauts".|$|E
2500|$|Researchers believe one in 2,000 {{people in}} the UK is a carrier of the disease linked to eating {{contaminated}} beef (vCJD). The survey provides the most robust prevalence measure to date—and identifies abnormal prion protein across a wider age group than found previously and in all genotypes, indicating [...] "infection" [...] may be relatively common. This new study examined over 32,000 anonymous appendix samples. Of these, 16 samples were positive for abnormal prion protein, indicating an overall prevalence of 493 per million population, or one in 2,000 {{people are likely to}} be carriers. No difference was seen in different birth cohorts (1941–60 and 1961–85), in both sexes, and there was no apparent difference in abnormal prion prevalence in three broad geographical areas. Genetic testing of the 16 positive samples revealed a higher proportion of valine homozygous (VV) genotype on the codon 129 of the gene encoding the prion protein (PRNP) compared with the general UK population. This also differs from the 177 patients with vCJD, all of whom to date have been methionine homozygous (MM) genotype. <b>The</b> <b>concern</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> individuals with this VV genotype may be susceptible to developing the condition over longer incubation periods.|$|E
50|$|Some {{are expressing}} caution {{about the way}} that {{conscious}} business might {{be reduced to a}} formulaic framework and schema. <b>The</b> <b>concern</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> these play down the attention that we give to everyday practices and how people relate to each other.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>concern</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> non-Jews {{would not}} bury their dead in {{established}} cemeteries, but would instead opt for burial at any opportune site -without erecting a fixed and element-proof tombstone marking the burial site.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>concern</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> key protections {{to privacy}} had been eroded away with {{technological}} advancements, therefore needed robust support {{in some areas}} to raise international human rights to the standards which had developed in the pre-digital age.|$|R
50|$|The {{need for}} a secure police van was {{realised}} when prisoners who were resisting arrest needed to <b>be</b> transported. <b>The</b> <b>concern</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> if transported in a conventional patrol car, the prisoner might attack the officers during the journey.|$|R
50|$|Data {{from the}} PCEHR {{is to be}} {{predominantly}} used in patient healthcare, but other uses are possible, for policy, research, audit and public health purposes. <b>The</b> <b>concern</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{in the case of}} research, what is allowed goes beyond existing privacy legislation.|$|E
50|$|Foxx had {{authored}} {{a previous}} {{version of this}} bill, which also passed the house, as H.R. 899 (113th Congress) in February 2014.The bill would allow private companies and trade associations to look at proposed rules before they are announced to the public. <b>The</b> <b>concern</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> private companies could weaken upgrades to public protections.|$|E
50|$|In April, 2017, Moody's Investors Services {{revised the}} outlook on Guitar Center's B2 rating to negative, meaning it could {{downgrade}} the rating further into junk {{territory in the}} medium tern. <b>The</b> <b>concern</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Guitar Center may be overwhelmed by it's $1 billion debt {{in the face of}} flat sales in the musical instrument industry as a whole.|$|E
50|$|Another {{reason for}} the {{construction}} of hair jewelry in the home was a lack of trust in commercial manufacturers. <b>The</b> <b>concern</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> hair used in the jewelry would not <b>be</b> the hair <b>that</b> had <b>been</b> given to the jeweler, having been substituted with other hair.|$|R
50|$|During production, Daniel Justice, {{leader of}} First Nations and Indigenous Studies in the University of British Columbia, complained about a Facebook post from Iqaluit {{resident}} and crew member Pascale Arpin, seeking fellow-Iqaluit residents {{to eat a}} seal for <b>the</b> film. <b>The</b> <b>concern</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> this amounted to cultural exploitation.|$|R

50|$|In September 2004, {{two members}} of the House Appropriations Committee {{requested}} that auditors review how the Homeland Security Department is using its authority to withhold transportation security information from the public. <b>The</b> <b>concern</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> material needs to be protected, but the public also needs to be advised of information that affects their safety and security.|$|E
5000|$|On May 20, 2011, the FDA {{issued a}} press release about SimplyThick, a food-thickening {{additive}} containing xanthan gum as the active ingredient, [...] "warning parents, caregivers and health care providers not to feed SimplyThick, a thickening product, to premature infants because the pathway is still developing."

5000|$|Black {{speculative}} fiction often {{focuses on}} race {{and the history of}} race relations in Western society. The history of slavery, the African diaspora, and the Civil Rights Movement sometimes influences the narrative of SF stories written by black authors.

50|$|One {{public health}} concern {{regarding}} exposure to blue light {{is based on}} the fact that children may be more susceptible to its effects. <b>The</b> <b>concern</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> not only are children the most vulnerable to the effects of blue light exposure but they are also more likely to frequently use devices that emit blue light and will likely be exposed to more blue light sources over the course of their lifetime.|$|E
5000|$|Human {{rights groups}} and activists in Pakistan have also criticized the bill, with one group complaining: [...] "The {{so-called}} Women's Protection Bill is a farcical attempt at making the Hudood Ordinance palatable". <b>The</b> <b>concern</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> thousands of rapes go unreported as victims {{fear that they}} would be treated as criminals. In contrast Martin Lau has said that the Act [...] "cannot be dismissed as a mere window dressing undertaken to satisfy a Western audience." ...|$|E
5000|$|Just as a martial artist {{would not}} use skills against someone who was not {{threatening}} them, verbal self-defense artists should not consider their skills {{as a means of}} influencing others. <b>The</b> <b>concern</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> verbal self defense and [...] "verbal manipulation" [...] are not one and the same. Proponents of verbal self-defense as a way to influence and guide others, however, argue that skills of persuasion {{can be used as a}} way to ensure one's mental and emotional safety.|$|E
25|$|Lee Myung-bak faced strong {{criticism}} {{over his}} choice of political appointees, many of whom <b>were</b> wealthy. <b>The</b> <b>concern</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> Lee's appointees would favor policies that protect the rich, while failing {{to address the needs}} of the underprivileged. Another criticism <b>was</b> <b>that</b> these appointees have mostly chosen from the nation's southeast region (Gyeongsangbuk-do and Gyeongsangnam-do), which is known as a GNP stronghold.|$|R
5000|$|Following the {{announcement}} of the decision to transfer the presidency of the Union, the Libyan leader, Muammar Gaddafi, stated <b>that</b> it <b>was</b> time to put the Union [...] "in the freezer".

50|$|CRKP is {{resistant}} to almost all available antimicrobial agents, and infections with CRKP have caused {{high rates of}} morbidity and mortality, in particular among persons with prolonged hospitalization and those critically ill and exposed to invasive devices (e.g., ventilators or central venous catheters). <b>The</b> <b>concern</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> carbapenem is often used as a drug of last resort when battling resistant bacterial strains. New slight mutations could result in infections for which healthcare professionals can do very little, if anything, to treat patients with resistant organisms.|$|E
50|$|Critics have {{contended that}} when lawmakers are drawn into battles to {{determine}} {{issues such as}} the composition over school lunches or how much an ATM fee should be, more serious issues such as deficit reduction or global warming or social security are neglected. It leads to legislative inertia. <b>The</b> <b>concern</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the preoccupation with what are seen as superficial issues prevents attention to long-term problems. Critics suggested that the 2011 Congress spent more time discussing per-transaction debit-card fees while neglecting issues seen as more pressing.|$|E
5000|$|Critics {{of formal}} {{certification}} also fear {{an erosion of}} organic standards. Provided with a legal framework within which to operate, lobbyists can push for amendments and exceptions favorable to large-scale production, resulting in [...] "legally organic" [...] products produced in ways similar to current conventional food. Combined {{with the fact that}} organic products are now sold predominantly through high volume distribution channels such as supermarkets, <b>the</b> <b>concern</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the market is evolving to favor the biggest producers, and this could result in the small organic farmer being squeezed out.|$|E
25|$|In February 2006, a {{coalition}} of church leaders {{and members of the}} Lawyers' Christian Fellowship declared their opposition to the privacy provisions of a proposed Charter of Rights that would form the basis of an amended Jamaican Constitution.

50|$|Calls for the {{military}} training of settlers began in the colony's earliest days. <b>The</b> <b>concern</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> settlers <b>were</b> not used to firearms and this could result in their being unable to defend themselves should the need arise.
