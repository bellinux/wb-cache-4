5|$|On 18 November 1966, a B-52G AF Ser. No. 58-0228 {{deployed}} from Barksdale Air Force Base {{crashed and}} was destroyed when it {{flew into the}} ground in swampland south of Stone Lake, Sawyer County, Wisconsin. The crew was on a low level terrain avoidance night mission, before SAC stopped such flights, and had just entered low altitude and were calibrating their terrain avoidance radar, when they flew too low, clipped <b>the</b> <b>tops</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> forest and crashed.|$|E
5|$|St Eugrad's {{is built}} in Decorated style using rubble masonry with gritstone dressings. The roof {{is made of}} slate and has stone coping. It has a 17th-century bellcote at the west end {{containing}} one bell, and stone crosses at <b>the</b> <b>tops</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gables. All of the church's external walls have been pebbledashed apart {{from the north and}} west wall of the chapel and the south porch. The vestry and the porch both have flat roofs and battlements.|$|E
5|$|Angkor Wat is {{decorated}} with depictions of apsaras and devata; {{there are more than}} 1,796 depictions of devata in the present research inventory. Angkor Wat architects employed small apsara images (–) as decorative motifs on pillars and walls. They incorporated larger devata images (all full-body portraits measuring approximately –) more prominently at every level of the temple from the entry pavilion to <b>the</b> <b>tops</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> high towers. In 1927, Sappho Marchal published a study cataloging the remarkable diversity of their hair, headdresses, garments, stance, jewellery and decorative flowers, which Marchal concluded were based on actual practices of the Angkor period.|$|E
5000|$|Corpus Christi Cathedral {{measures}} 176 ft {{in length}} and 90 ft in width. [...] The south tower is 125 ft to <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dome and 133 ft to <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cross. [...] The north tower is <b>the</b> shorter <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two towers and it rises to 97 ft to <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dome and 105 ft to <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cross.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> minaret {{is similar}} to <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> minaret at <b>the</b> Mosque <b>of</b> Bashtak.|$|R

5|$|Despite Canterbury's walls, a Viking army {{successfully}} {{attacked the}} city in 835, killing many of the inhabitants. Scandinavian raids recommenced from 991 onwards and in 1011 a Danish army demanded fresh tribute from the city. The city walls were used to defend the city during an 11-day siege, and the chronicler Roger of Hoveden recounts how the attacking Danes were thrown off <b>the</b> <b>tops</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> walls to their deaths by the citizens. Roger's account may be an exaggeration, but the story shows that the city walls were in sufficiently good condition for such a story to be considered plausible at the time. After a fire {{broke out in the}} city, however, the Danes entered and pillaged Canterbury.|$|E
5|$|During the mafic capping stage, basanite, alkali olivine basalt and hawaiite erupted {{mainly from}} small {{parasitic}} cones, tuff rings and fissures {{in the eastern}} half of the shield. Eruptions occurred subglacially, subaqueously and/or subaerially as shown by a wide range in the degree of vesicularity, freshness and glass content of the lavas. In most cases, each parasitic cone produced three or four lava flows from breaches in the cone walls. These were erupted as pāhoehoe and ʻaʻā, but <b>the</b> <b>tops</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lava flows are commonly missing due to erosion. Hawaiite was the most extensively erupted lava of the mafic capping stage, occurring mostly {{at the southern end of}} the Itcha Range but also in its interior.|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s the {{dovecote}} was inspected {{as part of}} {{an investigation}} into an outbreak of psittacosis (also known as parrot disease or parrot fever), a zoonotic infectious disease caused by the bacterium Chlamydophila psittaci, at the adjoining King's School. No cause was found for the infection. In 2010 restoration work was undertaken including repairs to <b>the</b> <b>tops</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> walls; these are exposed as the building no longer has a roof. Wall ties were used on the south west corner where the masonry was bulging. In addition, car parking and educational signage was provided. This was partially funded by South Somerset council, Bruton Town Council and the Heritage Lottery Fund to a total of £105,000.|$|E
2500|$|... (i) {{does not}} {{protrude}} beyond the straight line joining <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> index finger to <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> thumb.|$|R

5|$|Orangutan {{hands are}} similar to human hands; they have four long fingers and an opposable thumb. However, the joint and tendon {{arrangement}} in the orangutans' hands produces two adaptations that are significant for arboreal locomotion. The resting configuration of the fingers is curved, creating a suspensory hook grip. Additionally, {{without the use of}} the thumb, the fingers and hands can grip tightly around objects with a small diameter by resting <b>the</b> <b>tops</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fingers against the inside of the palm, creating a double-locked grip.|$|E
5|$|Pettigrew State Park is home {{to several}} species of birds of prey. Ospreys build their nests in <b>the</b> <b>tops</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tallest trees {{in the park and}} feed on the {{abundant}} fish of Lake Phelps. The population of bald eagles is increasing and they are occasionally seen over the park. At least three species of owl, the great horned owl, barred owl and eastern screech owl, make their home in the forests of the park, as do red tailed and red shouldered hawks. American kestrel and northern harriers also find suitable habitats at Pettigrew State Park.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the {{outbreak}} of war, Congress Heights (so called because the Capitol building in downtown Washington could be seen from <b>the</b> <b>tops</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hills) were owned by the Berry family, who also owned much of the Anacostia River bottomland {{to the west of}} the Heights. In the days following the First Battle of Bull Run, panicked efforts by the Union were made to defend Washington from what was perceived as an imminent Confederate attack. These makeshift entrenchments were largely confined to the direct approaches to Washington and the bridges that spanned the Potomac.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hill offers {{flat and}} paved areas that {{date back to}} civic {{waterworks}} that once existed on <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hill.|$|R

50|$|Yes or No and Down You Go - This round {{sees the}} celebrity from each team being hoisted to <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Detonator tower ride with the non-celebrity {{from the other}} team. Once at <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tower, the celebrity must ask the non-celebrity a series <b>of</b> questions. Should <b>the</b> non-celebrity say 'Yes', 'No', or 'Maybe', the round ends, and they are dropped from <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tower. Points are scored based on how many seconds they remain at <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tower.|$|R
5|$|The 20 {{locomotives}} of {{the first}} production batch were split equally between Brighton and Ashford works, and all were completed by December 1929. The production locomotives had a slightly different profile to the K class rebuilds and featured left-hand drive to improve the visibility of signals from the driver's side of the footplate. They also had higher running plates {{along the sides of}} the boiler than the rebuilds, which required smaller wheel splashers to cover <b>the</b> <b>tops</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> driving wheels. Another variation was the flatter top to the dome covers, as the rebuilds retained the high N class type used on the K class.|$|E
5|$|The castle was {{purchased}} from the Wollaston family in 1788 by Clement Winstanley. In 1790, {{the remains of}} the north tower were still standing, albeit in very poor condition. Clement Winstanley reportedly wanted to pull the northern ruins down, intending to reuse the bricks to make a barn, but his son, also called Clement, intervened, and subsequently carried out repairs to the castle. By the 19th century the ruins were covered in ivy; by the early 20th century, trees were growing out of <b>the</b> <b>tops</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> walls, which were frequented by grazing goats and cattle. Much of the moat had silted up and {{the remains of the}} bridge had been buried by the accumulated debris.|$|E
5|$|The mixed {{woodland}} region is a dense forest with {{many species of}} trees, located near <b>the</b> <b>tops</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plateaus. The forest canopy shades the ground, resulting in a cooler temperature. The canopy also reduces {{the amount of water}} evaporation. California black oak, Douglas fir, Pacific madrone, incense cedar, and other plants grow in the {{mixed woodland}}. Shrubs such as Oregon grape, honeysuckle, blue elderberry, and Pacific poison oak also grow here. The soil in this area is mostly loam.|$|E
50|$|The {{building}} is 79 ft by 116 ft and rises 50 ft to <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> roof, then 58 ft to <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dome.|$|R
50|$|Note {{that one}} cannot {{put down a}} meld or {{condition}} (and/or collect chip payments) unless he can use <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stock or <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> discards.|$|R
5000|$|Squats can be {{performed}} to varying depths. The competition standard is for <b>the</b> crease <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hip (<b>top</b> surface <b>of</b> <b>the</b> leg at the hip joint) to fall below <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> knee; this is colloquially known as [...] "parallel" [...] depth. Confusingly, many other definitions for [...] "parallel" [...] depth abound, none <b>of</b> which represents <b>the</b> standard in organized powerlifting. From shallowest to deepest, these other standards are: bottom of hamstring parallel to the ground; the hip joint itself below <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> knee, or femur parallel to <b>the</b> floor; and <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> upper thigh (i.e., <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> quadriceps) below <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> knee.|$|R
5|$|The species favours lowland {{areas that}} are {{seasonally}} wet but never inundated, such as the margins of swamps and marshes. For example, in the Yule Brook Botany Reserve, where parallel sand ridges cross a clay flat, B.telmatiaea occurs neither in the lowest parts of the flat, where seasonal inundation occurs; nor on <b>the</b> <b>tops</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ridges, where the drainage is good; {{but it is one}} of the most abundant plants of intermediate habitats, on ridge slopes and in higher areas of the clay flat.|$|E
5|$|To {{enhance the}} {{illusion}} of the puppets, David Lane ensured that camera shots frequently omitted <b>the</b> <b>tops</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> heads and the visible control wires, and also incorporated low-angle shots for dramatic effect. Location shooting in Portugal was arranged for Lane, Derek Meddings and camera operator Alan Perry to film overhead landscape shots for the climax in which Alan rescues the Zero-X astronauts during re-entry. However, when the footage was deemed unsatisfactory, it was replaced with a painted backdrop made by associate producer Reg Hill.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{watertight}} bulkheads extended {{well above}} the water line, they were not sealed at the top. If too many compartments were flooded, the ship's bow would settle deeper in the water, and water would spill from one compartment to the next in sequence, rather like water spilling {{across the top of}} an ice cube tray. This was what happened to Titanic, which had suffered damage to the forepeak tank, the three forward holds and No.6 boiler room, a total of five compartments. Titanic was only designed to float with any two compartments flooded, but it could remain afloat with certain combinations of three or even four compartments (the first four) open to the ocean. With five compartments, <b>the</b> <b>tops</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bulkheads would be submerged and the ship would continue to flood.|$|E
5000|$|... MLI-84M {{converted}} into an ARV with its turret {{replaced by a}} large three-section hydraulic crane controlled from outside the vehicle, winching frame mounted on <b>the</b> rear <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hull, stowage box on the left hand side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rear <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hull and two stowage boxes on the right hand side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hull.|$|R

5|$|Both {{ships were}} {{assigned}} to the Channel Fleet upon commissioning in 1865. Scorpion was refitted in 1867 with a flying bridge that connected the forecastle to the poop, above <b>the</b> <b>tops</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> turrets, and her sailing rig was reduced to a fore-and-aft rig. The ship recommissioned in 1868 for another tour with the Channel Fleet. She arrived in Bermuda in November 1869 where she became the local guard ship. In 1873 a proposal was made to remove her poop and forecastle, masts and deck fitting to convert her to a harbour defence monitor with all-around fire, but this was deemed too expensive and the project was abandoned in 1878. At some point during her service in Bermuda her rigging was removed and she was reduced to simple pole masts. The ship was fitted with searchlights and quick-firing guns in 1890. Scorpion was sunk as a target in 1901; she was raised in 1902 and sold in February 1903 for £736. She sank while under tow to Boston, Massachusetts.|$|E
5|$|Castles saw an {{increasing}} use of arrowslits by the 13th century, especially in England, almost certainly linked {{to the introduction of}} crossbows. These arrowslits were combined with firing positions from <b>the</b> <b>tops</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> towers, initially protected by wooden hoarding until stone machicolations were introduced in England in the late 13th century. The crossbow was an important military advance on the older short bow and was the favoured weapon by the time of Richard I; many crossbows and vast numbers of quarrels were needed to supply royal forces, in turn requiring larger scale iron production. In England, crossbows were primarily made at the Tower of London but St Briavels Castle, with the local Forest of Dean available to provide raw materials, became the national centre for quarrel manufacture. In Scotland, Edinburgh Castle became the centre for the production of bows, crossbows and siege engines for the king.|$|E
5|$|On {{the eastern}} side of Exmouth, the coast path climbs up onto the High Land of Orcombe. This is the start of the Jurassic Coast, a World Heritage Site. The next town is Budleigh Salterton, beyond which lies the River Otter. The path then skirts Chiselbury Bay and Ladram Bay towards Sidmouth which sits {{at the mouth of the}} River Sid. Access to the beach is via a wooden {{staircase}} known as Jacob's ladder. Sidmouth is surrounded by the East Devon AONB. Erosion remains a serious concern east of the mouth of the River Sid. The cliffs have been heavily eroded, threatening cliff top homes and the footpath, which passes along <b>the</b> <b>tops</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cliff, around Lyme Bay, avoiding The Undercliff towards Branscombe. The path then follows Seaton Bay past Beer, with Beer Quarry Caves a man-made cave complex, resulting from the quarrying of Beer stone and Seaton before going through The Undercliff SSSI and NNR and crossing the border into Dorset shortly before reaching Lyme Regis.|$|E
