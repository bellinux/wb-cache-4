5|$|In Abels' view, Æthelred's sons {{attempted}} to shame Alfred into handing over the lands they claimed {{so as to}} strengthen <b>their</b> <b>position</b> <b>in</b> the inevitable battle that would break out over the succession when Alfred died, and the Langandene assembly was Alfred's riposte.|$|E
5|$|These routes – {{spreading}} religion, {{trade and}} technology – {{have historically been}} vital {{to the growth of}} urban civilization.

5|$|As {{the course}} of the Napoleonic Wars turned, the {{territory}} was invaded by Russian and Prussian forces. After Napoleon's defeat and exile in 1814, the Southern Netherlands were occupied jointly by the Austrians, Prussians and Dutch. In an attempt to strengthen <b>their</b> <b>position</b> <b>in</b> Belgium, the Austrians began to recruit a Belgian Legion of infantry, cavalry and artillery, which was merged with the Dutch army. The Hundred Days' Campaign, launched by Napoleon after his escape from exile, was largely fought in Belgium in early 1815, and Napoleon's final defeat at the Battle of Waterloo occurred just miles from Brussels.|$|E

5|$|In {{terms of}} {{chemical}} behaviour, and trends going down group 3 for properties such as melting point, electronegativity and ionic radius, scandium, yttrium, lanthanum and actinium {{are similar to}} their group 1–2 counterparts.

5|$|On 16 February, {{two weeks}} {{following}} {{the arrival of}} Charlie Davies in camp, the club made local and national headlines when they announced that they successfully acquired Davies on a 12-month loan deal from Sochaux.

5|$|Senior safety Junior Rosegreen, {{freshman}} end Stanley McClover {{and junior}} nose guard Tommy Jackson were first-team all-SEC picks, signifying {{they were the}} best players at <b>their</b> <b>position</b> <b>in</b> the conference. Rosegreen had fiveinterceptions during the regular season, including four in Auburn's game against Tennessee. That single-game performance tied the SEC record and set the Auburn record for the most interceptions in one game. Jackson finished the regular season with 49tackles, six tackles for loss, and one sack.|$|E
5|$|The {{appointment}} of Tom Watson as the club's manager in 1896 {{led to the}} club's first period of sustained success. Liverpool consolidated <b>their</b> <b>position</b> <b>in</b> the Football League following promotion to the First Division, and won their first League championship in 1901. A further championship followed in 1906, and in 1914 the club reached their first FA Cup final, losing to Burnley. Watson died suddenly in 1915 of pneumonia after {{the outbreak of the}} First World War. The club won two further championships in 1922 and 1923 when football resumed after the war.|$|E

5|$|As the {{radiation}} sources can be precisely positioned at the tumour treatment site, brachytherapy enables a high {{dose of radiation}} {{to be applied to}} a small area. Furthermore, because {{the radiation}} sources are placed in or next to the target tumour, the sources maintain <b>their</b> <b>position</b> <b>in</b> relation to the tumour when the patient moves or if there is any movement of the tumour within the body. Therefore, the radiation sources remain accurately targeted. This enables clinicians to achieve a high level of dose conformity – i.e. ensuring the whole of the tumour receives an optimal level of radiation. It also reduces the risk of damage to healthy tissue, organs or structures around the tumour, thus enhancing the chance of cure and preservation of organ function.|$|E
5|$|Athletes from 39 nations won {{at least}} one medal, and athletes from 27 of these nations secured {{at least one}} gold. Eight NOCs—Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, India, Singapore, Vietnam, Qatar, Philippines and Kyrgyzstan—improved <b>their</b> <b>position</b> <b>in</b> the general medal table {{compared}} to the 1998 Asian Games. China topped the medal table for the sixth consecutive time in the Asian Games, with 150 gold medals. Athletes from China won the most silver medals (84) and the most medals overall (308). Competitors from the South Korea led the bronze medal count with 84. South Korea also won 96 gold medals, 80 silver medals {{and a total of}} 260 medals, finishing second on the medal table. Japanese athletes claimed 189 medals in total (including 44 gold), earning third spot on the table.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{these changes}} the {{highlands}} remained very poor and traditional, with few {{connections to the}} uplift of the Scottish Enlightenment and little role in the Industrial Revolution. A handful of powerful families, typified by the dukes of Argyll, Atholl, Buccleuch, and Sutherland, owned the best lands and controlled local political, legal and economic affairs. As late as 1878, 68 families owned nearly half the land in Scotland. Particularly {{after the end of}} the boom created by the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars (1790–1815), these landlords needed cash to maintain <b>their</b> <b>position</b> <b>in</b> London society, and had less need of soldiers. They turned to money rents, displaced farmers to raise sheep, and downplayed the traditional patriarchal relationship that had historically sustained the clans. This was exacerbated after the repeal of the Corn Laws in mid-century, when Britain adopted a free trade policy, and grain imports from America undermined the profitability of crop production.|$|E

In September 1968 ÚRO reaffirmed {{that the process of}} internal reforms and adoptions of new statues in the affiliated unions would continue.

5|$|During the 12 {{years in}} which Belgium failed to qualify for major tournaments, another golden {{generation}} matured, most of whom later featured in foreign top football leagues; as of July 2013, 12 Belgian national team players would play the next season in the English Premier League. Five players of this generation gained both prime individual and team awards in foreign top competitions or European club competitions: defenders Vincent Kompany and Jan Vertonghen, wingers Eden Hazard and Kevin De Bruyne, and forward Kevin Mirallas. However, as of November 2016 {{none of them were}} regarded by FIFA or UEFA to be the best at <b>their</b> <b>position</b> <b>in</b> any major international tournament yet.|$|E
5|$|Five NOCs—Greece, Tunisia, Morocco, Cyprus and San Marino—improved <b>their</b> <b>position</b> <b>in</b> {{the medal}} table {{compared}} to the 2005 Mediterranean Games. The host nation, Italy, topped the medal table for a record eleventh {{time in the history}} of the Games, having collected 64 gold medals; it also secured the most bronze medals (63) and the most medals overall (176). The Italian delegation also obtained the most medals in athletics, bowls, boxing, canoeing, fencing, karate, road cycling, rowing, shooting, swimming and volleyball, and tied for the most in football, judo, rhythmic gymnastics and water polo. France led the silver medal count with 53, and with 48 golds, 39 bronzes and a total of 140 medals, finished second on the medal table. Spanish athletes claimed 83 medals in total (including 28 gold), earning third spot on the table.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the €23.4million and €19.8million earned respectively by the two clubs as prize money, Manchester United and Chelsea received money from the UEFA market pool share. The market pool share had a total value of €277million, shared between the 32 clubs that qualified for the group stage. The pool was split in proportion to each national association's strength in the television market, with the Premier League clubs receiving around €60million in total from the pool. The money was then split between the four teams who qualified for the Champions League from the 2006–07 FA Premier League based on <b>their</b> <b>position</b> <b>in</b> the league {{and the number of}} matches played in the 2007–08 Champions League. This meant that Manchester United, having won the 2006–07 Premier League, received around €19.5million, and Chelsea, as runners-up, received around €16.5million.|$|E
