25|$|It's {{a complex}} {{question}} to answer, really.

Louis Vauxcelles in Gil Blas attacked them with a violence that was quite extraordinary. Younger critics who wrote columns in Comoedia, Excelsior, Action, and L'Oeuvre were more reserved, some of them even welcomed the Cubists with sympathy; in Paris-Journal, the free spirited poet André Salmon wrote an account of Room 41 that was full of intelligence and sympathy. <b>The</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> Gleizes was that the younger generation of critics had been won over by Cubism.|$|E
25|$|Protagoras {{states that}} he has two good pieces of {{evidence}} that people agree with him. First, people do not rebuke the ugly, dwarfish, and weak, but pity them, because they cannot help being as they are, yet they punish the unjust and generally feel as though someone is responsible for not knowing {{something that can be}} taught (323d). Second, they do instruct people who are unjust and irreligious, hoping to impart goodness in them. He says that parents begin with their children from earliest childhood, and teachers carry on the task. Protagoras notes that none of this is surprising, but what would be surprising is if this were not the case (326e). He closes by addressing Socrates' question why, if virtue is teachable, the sons of virtuous men often lack virtue. Protagoras lays out a thought experiment where a hypothetical city state is resting its survival as such to the skill of flute playing. Being <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> that society, parents would be eager to teach the skill to their sons. Not everyone would be successful though, as we can imagine, as some would have a greater natural inclination than others and often the son of a good flute player would turn out bad and vice versa. Any of them however, even the bad ones, would be better than an average citizen in the real world which might have never been taught how to play. Same goes for virtue, it is considered so important that everyone is taught to a certain degree, {{to the point that it}} seems like a part of human nature while it is not (327b–d).|$|E
25|$|Šarūnas {{started going}} to school in Jonas Jablonskis Middle School in 1982 and {{attended}} it till 1987. He {{had to take the}} bus to go to school even though the thermometer outside read minus twenty and he knew that <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> his parents was that he spent as little time as possible with the toughest people of Partizanai Street. From 1987 to 1993, he was studying at Kaunas 4th Middle School. His first trip destination was Moscow, which he visited before the tournament. Jasikevičius's greatest youth memory in the city was the opening of the first McDonald's in Russia. He remembers that his classmates were listening with their mouths gaping when he was narrating about the French fries, bread rolls with minced beef and fizzy drinks. One of his childhood passions was history, especially about the Native Americans, as well as books about basketball as he was capable of reading a book of more than four hundred pages on basketball in two days. He was also curious about politics, especially when Perestroika began, because of which he was able to travel to Berlin with his father and brother, and was amazed by the visit to the Checkpoint Charlie Museum. His childhood favorite Lithuanian player was Arvydas Sabonis, which he admired more than other Lithuanian superstars, such as Rimas Kurtinaitis and Valdemaras Chomičius, due to his passing. However, his idol was Dražen Petrović, and he wished {{to be as good as}} him, watching matches of him over and over again, dozens of times, for hours and hours, and later started imitating him in workouts. After one of his trips, his dad came back with a videocassette recorder, using which he was able to record an NBA All-Star Game with Michael Jordan, Clyde Drexler, Larry Bird, Magic Johnson, David Robinson, and later to watch it for couple of years, more than hundred times. Jasikevičius also started to record games of Žalgiris and Petrović every time he was able to. Thanks to the video recorder, he discovered the existence of a no-look pass of Magic Johnson. For him, he was the NBA, not Michael Jordan. His unselfishness, imagination and the way he dribbled, passed between his opponent's legs bewitched Jasikevičius. Consequently, his favorite element of basketball quickly became assisting his teammates, and he was trying to do it like Petrović or Johnson.|$|E

500|$|Bergkamp {{attracted}} the attention of several European clubs {{as a result of his}} performances for Ajax. Johan Cruyff advised him not to join Real Madrid, one of the teams said to have been interested in him. But Bergkamp was insistent on playing in Italy. He considered Serie A [...] "the biggest league at the time" [...] and preferred a move to either Juventus or Internazionale. On 16 February 1993, Bergkamp agreed a £7.1million move to the latter club in a deal which included his Ajax teammate Wim Jonk. Upon signing, Bergkamp said Inter [...] "met all my demands. <b>The</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> me was the stadium, the people at the club and their style of play." ...|$|E

500|$|<b>The</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> Paterson was to {{keep the}} spirit of the book alive while finding a way to {{transform}} it from [...] "a novel that takes place mostly in the characters' heads to a dynamic visual medium". Paterson knew that the film had to be about friendship and imagination. While Paterson focused on [...] "bringing out the emotions of the story," [...] he admitted to having difficulty writing about Terabithia [...] "because it was too close". He credited fellow screenwriter Jeff Stockwell for recreating Terabithia for the film. [...] "What Jeff was able to do as an outsider who wasn't so attached to the story was to really let his imagination go free and make up this world in a wonderful way", David said. Csupó noted that the two main characters are a little bit older in the film than they are in the book. Csupó reasons that the movie [...] "deals with so many issues including friendship, and maybe first innocent love, things like that", so it [...] "made more sense" [...] to make the characters older.|$|E

[...] "I have {{said in the past}} – and I'll repeat again – that the best reparations we can provide are good schools in the inner city and jobs for people who are unemployed," [...] Obama said. An apology for slavery would be appropriate but not particularly helpful in improving the lives of African Americans, he said. Reparations could also be a distraction, Obama said. [...] "I consistently believe {{that when it comes to}} whether it's Native Americans or African-American issues or reparations, <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> the U.S. government to do is not just offer words, but offer deeds," [...] Obama told a meeting in Chicago in July 2008.|$|E
2500|$|One {{advantage}} Rachmaninoff had in {{this building}} process over most of his contemporaries was in approaching the pieces he played {{from the perspective of}} a composer rather than that of an interpreter. He believed [...] "interpretation demands something of the creative instinct. If you are a composer, you have an affinity with other composers. You can make contact with their imaginations, knowing something of their problems and their ideals. You can give their works color. That is <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> me in my interpretations, color. So you make music live. Without color it is dead." [...] Nevertheless, Rachmaninoff also possessed a far better sense of structure than many of his contemporaries, such as Hofmann, or the majority of pianists from the previous generation, judging from their respective recordings.|$|E

Lee was inspired to record the latter songs because, [...] "as far as I am concerned, Don Quixote is the most metal fictional character that I know". His fourth EP and third annual Christmas release came in December 2014, as he put out [...] "Darkest Carols, Faithful Sing", a playful take on [...] "Hark! The Herald Angels Sing". He explained: [...] "It's light-hearted, joyful and fun... At my age, <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> me is to keep active by doing things that I truly enjoy.

2500|$|Recording {{the album}} soon became an {{obsession}} to Parker, {{as he worked}} [...] "all day, every day," [...] growing increasingly isolated. He said, [...] "At some point, life outside the studio fades into the distance. That's how I know that I'm into it." [...] He reasoned that any alternate approach would imply that the music was not powerful enough. Pitchfork writer Corban Goble described Parker's daily routine in an article shortly preceding the album's release: [...] "During the making of an album, the 29-year-old generally likes to rise around midday and then work, slowly and methodically, {{late into the night}} while drinking and smoking." [...] Parker contended this approach helped his writing, noting, [...] "Things flow easier — the flow is <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> me for recording." [...] He also often went swimming during breaks, which he dubbed [...] "the ultimate purifier." [...] He followed a mantra of [...] "give the song what it deserves," [...] which entailed creating music without [...] "any sensible or logical decisions." [...] Parker recorded dozens of vocals takes; according to him, for one song, he performed over 1,056 partial vocal takes. For one week, he rented another house located four hours south of Perth—the same one where he recorded Innerspeaker—to brainstorm drum ideas for songs.|$|E
