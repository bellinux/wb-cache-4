5|$|The Chaser group's {{founding}} members were Charles Firth, Dominic Knight, Craig Reucassel, and Julian Morrow. In 1999 <b>they</b> <b>started</b> <b>The</b> Chaser, a fortnightly satirical newspaper. Chas Licciardello, Andrew Hansen, and Chris Taylor later joined the group; and in 2006, after various ventures in radio, stage, and television, this line-up created The Chaser's War on Everything, its most successful program, which screened on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) station ABC1.

Later the same evening, they reached the main shelf where the {{aircraft}} body lay. Although finding the remaining bodies, the team only salvaged some post, concluding {{that it would be}} too difficult for them to take down the bodies. They were down again at 01:30. At 10:00 on 20 June, the team again ascended the mountain. Bernt Porten climbed halfway up at least a dozen times, taking water up and bringing down bodies wrapped in tarpaulin. All three bodies and the climbers were down again at 21:00.|$|E
5|$|Watford {{went into}} the 2013–14 season full of confidence. <b>They</b> <b>started</b> <b>the</b> season well with {{positive}} results, including a 6–1 win over A.F.C. Bournemouth and then a 5–1 win over Barnsley. The club's form, however, soon dipped, and Watford struggled, losing five consecutive home matches. This lack of form ultimately led to Gianfranco Zola's departure from the club. In December 2013, Watford appointed Beppe Sannino as their new manager and finished the 2013–14 season in 13th place.|$|E

They reached the final of the 2001–02 Umm Al-Ma'arik Cup, after defeating Al-Karkh 1–0 in the semi-finals, against Al-Shorta where they lost with a single goal after extra time. Younis Mahmoud was the top goalscorer of the tournament. Al-Talaba also won their first-ever Iraq FA Cup that season, after meeting Al-Shorta again in the final and defeating them with Qusay Hashim's late 85th-minute goal. Al-Talaba also won the 2001 Baghdad Challenge Cup by defeating Al-Zawra'a 2–1 and won the 2002 Al-Muthabara Cup against the league runners-up, Al-Quwa Al-Jawiya, 2–1 after extra time.|$|E
5|$|Forglen House is {{a mansion}} house {{that forms the}} centrepiece of the Forglen estate in the parish of Forglen, {{northwest}} of Turriff, Aberdeenshire, in the northeast of Scotland. The lands {{were given to the}} abbots of the Abbey of Arbroath by King William the Lion before 1211 and the Monymusk Reliquary was held there. The original castle, built around 1346, was replaced by a vernacular harled house that was later extended. Significant development of the estate began when it was acquired by the family of Lord Banff and <b>they</b> <b>started</b> <b>the</b> work of landscaping and planting trees. It became their main family seat during the 18th century. After the death of William Ogilvy, the eighth and final Lord Banff, the estate passed by marriage to the Abercromby baronets who continued to enhance the property and maintained it as their main residence. Sir Robert Abercromby, 5th Baronet commissioned the Aberdeen City Architect, John Smith to design the present house in 1839.|$|E
5|$|Saturday afternoon's {{qualifying}} {{session was}} divided into three parts. The first part ran for twenty minutes and eliminated the cars that finished the session eighteenth or lower.

He again moved to the city during the Nigerian Civil War after escaping Lagos with his family. It was at this time that he met and became friends with Nigerian poet Christopher Okigbo where <b>they</b> <b>started</b> <b>the</b> publishing house Citadel Press, among its titles How the Dog was Domesticated and How the Leopard Got His Claws. Okigbo lived in Enugu during the early months of the Nigerian Civil War. His home in Hilltop contained many of his unpublished writings which were mostly destroyed by bombing early in the war. Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, writer of Half of a Yellow Sun, a winner of the Orange Prize for Fiction in 2007, was born in Enugu in 1977 and grew up in Nsukka.|$|E
5|$|The Rockets' two-year {{championship}} run {{ended when}} they were eliminated {{in the second round}} of the 1996 NBA Playoffs by the eventual Western Conference Champion Seattle SuperSonics. Michael Jordan had returned from an 18-month hiatus in March 1995, and his Chicago Bulls dominated the league for the next three years (1996–98). The Bulls and Rockets never met in the NBA Playoffs. The Rockets posted a 57–win season in 1996–97 season when they added Charles Barkley to their roster. <b>They</b> <b>started</b> <b>the</b> season 21–2, but lost the Western Conference Finals in six games to the Utah Jazz. After averaging 26.9 and 23.2 points in 1995–96 and 1996–97 respectively, Olajuwon's point production dipped to 16.4 in 1997–98. After the Rockets lost in the first round in five games to the Jazz in 1998, Drexler retired. In 1998–99 the Rockets acquired veteran All-Star Scottie Pippen and finished 31–19 in the lockout-shortened regular season. Olajuwon's scoring production rose to 18.9 points per game, and he made his twelfth and final All-NBA Team. However, they lost in the first round again, this time to the Lakers. After the season, Pippen was traded to the Portland Trail Blazers.|$|E
5|$|In June 2008, Rhodes {{returned}} to League Two, {{when he signed}} a one-year deal with Rotherham United, after their manager Mark Robins was impressed by Rhodes' performance against them the previous season. Rotherham were deducted 17points {{at the start of}} the 2008–09 season because of improperly exiting administration. <b>They</b> <b>started</b> <b>the</b> season with a 1–0 against Lincoln City, in which Rhodes made his debut before he was substituted in the second half. He scored his first goal for Rotherham in a League Cup first round tie against local rivals Sheffield Wednesday at Hillsborough on 12 August 2008. Rhodes' goal game only seconds after Wednesday had opened the scoring, before the game finished 2–2. Rotherham eventually won through to the second round on penalties. His first league goal for the club came less than two weeks later as Rotherham beat Chester City 3–1 to maintain their winning start to the season. Rhodes was a regular in the Rotherham side {{at the start of the}} season as the team overhauled their point deduction to go above Grimsby Town in the league, but he was dropped for a game against his former side Bradford City in November 2008. He briefly {{returned to}} the side the following month for a Football League Trophy area semi-final with Darlington, which Rotherham won on penalties, but did not play again until the two sides met once more in a league game at the end of January 2009.|$|E

Six laps later, after the leaders ran single file, Kenseth {{received}} help from Johnson while running on the outside line {{to prepare for a}} race winning slingshot. Kenseth slid underneath teammate Biffle as <b>they</b> <b>started</b> <b>the</b> final lap, as Biffle attempted to block Kenseth. Kenseth maintained the lead and crossed the finish line on lap 60 to win the race, with Smith in second and Johnson third. Sadler and Biffle rounded out the top five finishers. Blaney and Nemechek earned the second pair of transfer spots to qualify for the Daytona 500. Bayne, Tony Raines and David Stremme secured qualification for the Daytona 500 based on their lap times in the qualifier, with Terry Labonte using a champion's provisional to qualify. The following six drivers failed to qualify for the Daytona 500 because they did not finish high enough in their respective Duels or turn a fast-enough qualifying lap: Waltrip, Richardson, Bill Elliott, Mike Wallace, Kenny Wallace and J.J. Yeley. The second race had a total of five lead changes among four different drivers and no cautions were shown. Biffle's total of 40 laps led was the highest of any competitor. Kenseth led two times for a total of ten laps.|$|E

Vettel set the fastest times {{in the second and third}} sessions and clinched his fourth pole position of the season with a time of 1:37.587. It was the Red Bull team's eighth pole in the season's nine races. He was joined on the grid's front row by Webber who recorded a lap time 0.075 seconds slower than Vettel. Hamilton qualified third but locked his rear tyres on his final timed heading into turn 17 and slowed down, preventing him from improving his grid position. The two Ferrari drivers were fourth and fifth (with Alonso ahead of Massa); Massa encountered slower cars which prevented him from gaining optimum tyre temperature and could not improve his fastest lap time. Kubica took sixth position and felt more movement on his Renault when he had the medium compound tyre equipped. Button had oversteer through turn 24 and made a mistake in the following corner which restricted him to seventh. Nico Hülkenberg was eighth, ahead of Williams teammate Barrichello in ninth who was affected by a brake-warm up problem. Petrov rounded out the top ten and made mistakes on his final timed lap which prevented him from getting a better starting position.|$|E
