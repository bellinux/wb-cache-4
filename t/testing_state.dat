50|$|People {{who are in}} {{opposition}} to integrity <b>testing</b> <b>state</b> that it is unfair to not hire someone {{because they have a}} predisposition to do something that they might never do. Critics also say integrity tests can violate legal and ethical privacy standards, because there could be some questions that are not related to specific duties of the job, and there is not protection for the illegal use of the data. Another criticism is the possibility that an integrity test would have adverse impact in screening out a higher proportion of minority group members. Critics also say if a client learns of their own score, it may have an adverse effect on their morale, but even if the scores were only shown to the employers, it could affect the employers attitude towards the employee which could hurt the effectiveness of the employee.|$|E
5000|$|CORE was {{established}} in 1942 in Chicago. It was a branch of a [...] "Peace-Lover" [...] organization, which was called the Fellowship of Reconciliation (FOR). CORE used nonviolent actions procedures that involved sit-ins, which were done in lunch counters in Chicago. By 1947, CORE contributed with an interracial bus ride across {{the upper part of}} the South. They were <b>testing</b> <b>state</b> buses that the U.S Supreme Court ordered to be desegregated, which was the Morgan v. Virginia decision in 1946. This led to some success for the facilities that were testing out the orders they were given, but it didn't grab much attention especially in the national level, which was their main goal. By 1960, there was a new wave of nonviolent direct action protests that initiated through the student sit-in movement. CORE's national director James Farmer repeated the Journey of Reconciliation. Another Supreme Court ruling, Boynton v. Virginia (1960), ordered a stop to segregation in the interstate bus terminals. That came to be the Freedom Rides. The Freedom Riders traveled deep into the south and were attacked by segregationists along Alabama.|$|E

Applying the successful schools observation method and cost function analysis method to integrated data-sets that match schools' eight-grade mathematics test performance measures to district funding, this study conducts empirical searches for adequate instructional expenditures per pupil to meet desired proficiency targets on national versus state assessments. While Kentucky (high-stakes <b>testing</b> <b>state)</b> had a lower performance standard than Maine (low-stakes <b>testing</b> <b>state),</b> this study reveals a relatively lower level of school funding adequacy and a weaker relationship between school expenditures and performance for Kentucky than for Maine. The study suggests that state educational accountability systems and policies may influence the level of state performance standards and the proficiency gaps between national and state assessments, which in turn lead to potential gaps in school funding. Implications for policy and research are discussed to address problems with dual standards of school performance and to improve school funding adequacy and efficiency. accountability, adequacy, school funding, performance standards, high-stakes testing,...|$|E

Conversely, students care very little about the STAR tests and generally do not try on it. The teacher survey showed little consistency in the amount and type of test preparation done.

40|$|A {{total of}} 62 single shear bolted {{connection}} specimens were <b>tested</b> using transient <b>state</b> <b>test</b> method. The specimens of single shear bolted connections were fabricated by three different thicknesses of thin sheet steels.

The tendency of the test strength reduction of the single shear bolted connections conducted using the transient <b>state</b> <b>test</b> method is generally similar to that for the steady <b>state</b> <b>test</b> method.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a state-based approach to testing aspect-oriented programs. Aspectual state models, {{as an extension}} to the testable FREE state model of classes, are exploited to capture the impact of aspects on the state models of classes. To generate test suites for adequately testing object behavior and interaction between classes and aspects in terms of message sequences, we transform an aspectual state model to a transition tree, where each path from the root to some leaf node indicates a template of test cases, i. e. message sequences. Since the statebased approach is directly built upon the test design patterns for object-oriented programs, {{it is not only}} applicable to the simultaneous development of classes and aspects, but also to the incremental development of aspects based on the existing classes.

40|$|The {{software}} <b>testing</b> <b>state</b> {{of practice}} {{is not as}} good as it ought to be. To reduce the gap between the state of practice and the state of the art, improvement of software testing is necessary. Existing improvement models focus too little on, or lack important aspects of, software testing. Therefore a new model is required. This paper describes a test improvement model called TIM. The model functions as a guidebook for test improvement. It is mainly inspired by SEI's Capability Maturity Model and Gelperin's Testability Maturity Model. TIM introduces new perspectives to test improvement, with explicit focus on cost-effectiveness and risk management. The model addresses five &quot;key areas &quot; of testing: organisation, planning and tracking, test cases, testware, and reviews. TIM also includes an assessment procedure. The model is continuously revised as knowledge is gained through research and experience of use. This paper presents results from three applications of TIM...|$|E

In this study, the ALL reconstruction was able to further reduce the knee laxity when tested in conjunction with an ACL reconstruction. A primary finding was that during a simulated pivot-shift test, {{a significant reduction in}} internal rotation at 30 °, 45 ° and 60 ° of knee flexion was noted for the ACL reconstruction in conjunction with an ALL reconstruction. This was statistically significant when compared to the ACL reconstruction with deficient ALL <b>testing</b> <b>state.</b> Favourable isometry is seen at the proximal and posterior to epicondyle femoral position, with the ALL being tight in extension and in internal rotation at 20 ° and lax at flexion at 120 ° and internal rotation at 90 ° [41].

Furthermore, the probabilities of loans for economic sectors to migrate down into lower levels are estimated by loan transition matrices. Finally, credit stress testing was applied to each bank respectively using the parameters found in previous analyses. To mention some results: bigger bank's nonperforming loans are related to GDP in negative ways but mid-sized and smaller banks have positive relationship between their nonperforming loan and GDP.
