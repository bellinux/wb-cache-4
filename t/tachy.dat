40|$|The life-history of Raillietina cesticillus {{living on}} a chicken has been studied well, for cestodes are {{prevalent}} all over the world. At present, 17 genus, 35 species, of their intermediate hosts are found in Europe and American. In Japan, they belong to common cestodes, but the writer has never found any references dealing with the life-history of them. This paper describs {{the movements of the}} segments and the life-history of the cestodes. They injure their hosts by destroging the tissue of the small intestinal wall, thrusting deep their scolex into its wall, still more entering the muscularis mucosa, and forming intestinal nodules. There are many groups of white Leghorn chickens of 2 years old in the hen-house of Nara Agricultural Laboratory, {{and many of them are}} infected with R. cesticillus. Many gravid segments are found on new feces and many insects gather on the feces to eat the gravid segments. (1) Behavior of gravid segments. Most gravid segments of the excreted R. cesticillus are connected into 4 - 5 segments. They creep about freely on the surface of the new feces. The description of their movements were made by REID, ACKERT and CASE in 1938. When feces are excreted on the ground, the segments move to the edges of moist parts made by the excrements, or to the dark parts of the feces and also to dry sand granule in the circumference of them. In other words, their movements show any tropism against light, heat or gravity. The process of their movements are illustrated in Fig. 1. When their movements stop, the conective segments are separated into a single segment and each segment changes into a milkly white sperical mass. (2) Natual infection of <b>Tachys</b> laetifius. In order to find the intermsdiate hosts of the cestode, the writer collected the following 6 species of the insects; Tetramorium caespitum jacoti WHEELER, Euponera solitaria, <b>Tachys</b> laetificus BATES, Bcmbidion mcrawiti CSIKI, Euborellia pallipes SHIRAKT, Onthophagus atcr WATERHOUSE, from April to September 1951, which were found in the experimental chicken yards mentioned already. By examining whether the above mentioned insects were infected with cysticercoid or not, the writer found that only <b>Tachys</b> laetificus were naturally infected. The dissection of 125 <b>Tachys</b> laetificus, led me to find the fact that 45 beetles (36 %) were infected with cysticercoids. The avarage number of cysticercoids found in one insects were 4. 4 and the maximam number was 19. (3) Forms of onchosphere and cysticercoid. The egg (Fig. 2) of R. cesticillus is about 92 -ll 9 μ long and 72 - 108 μ wide the onchosphero having four membranes is recognized in center of the egg. The onchosphere is about 3 l- 53 μ long and 38 - 46 μ wide and has six embryonal hooks. The middle two hooks (Fig. 2. D.) are about 21 μ and the lateral four hooks (Fig. 2. E.) 17 μ in length. <b>Tachys</b> lactificus, having eaten the onchosphere, begin to grow in the abdominal cavity of the insect and develop into mature cysticercoids. Their developmental process is illustrated in Fig. 3. The mature cysticercoid (Fig. 4) is approximately elliptical and has a larval scolex invaginated in the bladder, which is entirely surrounded by a heavy cyst wall. Neither caudal appendage, a embryonal hook, nor sucher is ackowledged on any of the specimens examined. The size of cysticercoid is 327 - 489 μ long anp 267 - 337 μ wide. (4) Experimental infection of chicken. The writer succeeded in infecting chickens by feeding them cysticercoid taken from <b>Tachys</b> laetificus. That is, the writer examined chicken No. 1 and No. 2 on Aug. 20, 15 th day after the infection; No. 3, No. 1, on Aug. 25, 20 th day after the infection and found parasites of R. cesticillus in the small intestines. The percentage of infection of the cysticercoids in tapeworms was 73. 8 %. As for the controlbirds, kept side by side the experimented birds, they were found negative by the post-mortem examination. Thus the writer could ascertain that <b>Tachys</b> lactificus was the suitable intermediate host for this tapeworm...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Endothelins (ETs) are {{a family}} of novel {{regulatory}} peptides and various lines of evidence suggest an important role for ETs in regulating pulmo-nary function. Two receptors for endothelin, ETA and ETB, {{have been found in}} the human lung, and according to recent studies a non-ETA receptor seems to mediate the contraction of large sized human bronchi. Several studies have empha-sized the importance of small bronchi in the pathogenesis of airway disease. In the present paper, improved methodology was used which enables in vitro studies of small human bronchi down to a diameter of 0. 5 – 1. 0 mm. Using the new methodology we have tried to further characterize this receptor. Small bronchi from the distal parts of the bronchial tree were obtained from pulmonary tissue removed from 15 patients with lung cancer. They were dissected and cut into ring segments, in which isometric tension was recorded. ET- 1, ET- 2 and ET- 3 elicited strong concentration-dependent contractions of the human small bronchus.

The methods used to optimize VV delay included ultrasonography, radioisotope diagnosis, scintigraphy, electrocardiography, Swan–Ganz catheterization, and thoracic impedance. Their populations and results were analyzed to identify convincing rules. Methods for VV delay optimization in the literature can be categorized into four patterns. Time and cost were high in several categories. Most studies concluded that their method was effective but no small amount of papers denied individual detailed optimization. There were some population biases in most papers. Individual optimization had a major impact in patients with ischemic heart disease but no significant impact in patients with non-ischemic heart diseases.

40|$|SUMMARY Daily {{subcutaneous}} {{injections of}} lente insulin reduced the hypertension and bradycar-dia which developed consistently in streptozotocin diabetic rats. Insulin-treated rats also became less hyperglycemic, drank less water, and gained weight faster than untreated diabetic controls. Behavior-al and <b>tachy</b> card lac effects elicited by electrical {{stimulation of the}} ventromedial hypothalamus while the rats were awake were similar, but attendant pressor responses were larger in those that had been treated with insulin. Under subsequent urethane anesthesia, pressor and sympathetic responses to hypothalamic stimulation, as well as pressor responses to tyramine and vasopressin, were augmented in insulin-treated rats. A generalized increase in cardiovascular reactivity caused by insulin seemed unlikely since pressor responses to norepinephrine were unaltered. Enhanced hypothalamic respon-siveness was considered due to improvement of diabetic encephalopathy rather than to direct CNS stimulation by insulin because the injected insulin had mostly dissipated by the time pressor responses were recorded. By showing that insulin treatment produced changes opposite to those occurring during induction of diabetes our results suggest that insulin can alleviate cardiovascular and hypotha-lamic dysfunction in streptozotocin-induced diabetes.
