5|$|The {{pre-production}} Griffon I {{shared the}} R engine's bore and stroke, but was otherwise {{a completely new}} design that first ran in the Experimental Department in November 1939. Although this single engine was never flown, the production version, the Griffon II, first flew in 1941 installed in the Fairey Firefly. A {{significant difference between the}} R and the production Griffon was the re-location of <b>the</b> <b>camshaft</b> and supercharger drives {{to the front of the}} engine to reduce overall length. Another length-reducing measure was the use of a single magneto (the R had two, mounted at the rear), this again was moved to the front of the engine.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>camshaft</b> {{was first}} {{described}} in Turkey (Diyarbakır) by Al-Jazari in 1206. He employed {{it as part}} of his automata, water-raising machines, and water clocks such as the castle clock. <b>The</b> <b>camshaft</b> later appeared in European mechanisms from the 14th century.|$|E
25|$|Depending on the {{location}} of <b>the</b> <b>camshaft,</b> the cam operates the valves either directly or through a linkage of pushrods and rockers. Direct operation involves a simpler mechanism and leads to fewer failures, but requires <b>the</b> <b>camshaft</b> to be positioned {{at the top of}} the cylinders. In the past when engines were not as reliable as today this was seen as too much trouble, but in modern gasoline engines the overhead cam system, where <b>the</b> <b>camshaft</b> is on top of the cylinder head, is quite common.|$|E
50|$|Train of ten {{cascading}} gears at {{front of}} the engine operate <b>the</b> <b>camshafts,</b> magnetos, oil and water pumps. The crankshaft gear drives the two magneto gears at crank speed. The two to one speed reduction to <b>the</b> <b>camshafts</b> {{takes place at the}} first stage of the gear train; all the remaining gears between the first intermediate gear and the gears at <b>the</b> <b>camshafts</b> are idlers.|$|R
50|$|The DOHC {{cylinder}} head had 16 valves and {{was made of}} lost foam cast aluminium. <b>The</b> <b>camshafts</b> were held in the {{cylinder head}} with bearing caps and driven by a chain off the front crankshaft sprocket. Motion from <b>the</b> <b>camshafts</b> was transmitted to the 16 valves by direct-acting hydraulic lifters.|$|R
50|$|The {{variable}} valve timing (VANOS) is a continuously variable design and is present on both the intake and exhaust <b>camshafts.</b> <b>The</b> VANOS units were designed as integral components of the chain drive, and the adjustment ranges are 63 degrees for <b>the</b> intake <b>camshaft</b> and 60 degrees for <b>the</b> exhaust <b>camshaft.</b> <b>The</b> redline for the N73 is 6500 rpm.|$|R
25|$|In a {{two-stroke}} engine {{that uses a}} camshaft, each valve is opened once for every rotation of the crankshaft; in these engines, <b>the</b> <b>camshaft</b> rotates {{at the same speed}} as the crankshaft. In a four-stroke engine, the valves are opened only half as often; thus, two full rotations of the crankshaft occur for each rotation of <b>the</b> <b>camshaft.</b>|$|E
25|$|Lubricating oil was {{mechanically}} pumped through cast-in {{channels in}} the crankcase {{to all the}} crankshaft bearings. <b>The</b> <b>camshaft</b> was contained in an oil tight sleeve.|$|E
25|$|On current Ducati motors, {{except for}} the Desmosedici and 1199 Panigale, the valves are {{actuated}} by a standard valve cam shaft which is rotated by a timing belt driven by the motor directly. The teeth on the belt keep <b>the</b> <b>camshaft</b> drive pulleys indexed. On older Ducati motors, prior to 1986, drive was by solid shaft that transferred to <b>the</b> <b>camshaft</b> through bevel-cut gears. This method of valve actuation was used on many of Ducati's older single-cylinder motorcycles — the shaft tube is visible {{on the outside of}} the cylinder.|$|E
50|$|Most modern {{production}} automobile engines use a {{timing belt}} or chain to synchronize crankshaft and camshaft rotation; some engines instead use gears to directly drive <b>the</b> <b>camshafts.</b> <b>The</b> {{use of a}} timing belt or chain instead of direct gear drive enables engine designers to place <b>the</b> <b>camshaft(s)</b> further from <b>the</b> crankshaft, and in engines with multiple camshafts a timing belt or chain also enables <b>the</b> <b>camshafts</b> to be placed further from each other. Timing chains were common on production automobiles through the 1970s and 1980s, when timing belts became the norm, but timing chains have seen a resurgence in recent years. Timing chains are generally more durable than timing belts - though neither is as durable as direct gear drive - however, timing belts are lighter, less expensive, and operate more quietly.|$|R
5|$|Aluminium casting {{fitted to}} rear of crankcase. Houses drives to <b>the</b> <b>camshafts,</b> magnetos, coolant and oil pumps, supercharger, hand and {{electric}} starters, and the electric generator.|$|R
50|$|The rotary cam {{poppet valve}} gear {{consists}} of two admission valves and two exhaust valves per cylinder, operated by a camshaft arranged in a box fixed to each cylinder between the valve chambers. The cam boxes are self-contained and detachable, and replacement cam boxes can be fitted at running sheds within a few hours. <b>The</b> <b>camshafts</b> are driven from the return cranks on the driving wheels through worm wheels and universal propeller shafts, arranged so that <b>the</b> <b>camshafts</b> and <b>the</b> coupled wheels revolve at the same speed.|$|R
25|$|The same {{engine base}} {{was used for}} the Audi R8 when Audi wanted to build their first Supercar. However, <b>the</b> <b>camshaft</b> drive system was moved {{to the front of the}} block for the mid-engine R8.|$|E
25|$|Drive {{was from}} <b>the</b> <b>camshaft</b> {{operating}} rods of an Austro-Daimler engine via a wormgear. The early Schwarzlose gun had a synchronized rate of 360 {{rounds per minute}} with this gear – this was later boosted to 380 rounds with the MG16 model.|$|E
25|$|Based on the {{principle}} of the Fokker Zentralsteuerung gear, with flexible drives linked to <b>the</b> <b>camshaft,</b> and firing impulses being generated by the trigger motor of each gun. Geared down to operate more reliably with the difficult Schwarzlose gun, its rate of fire was limited to 360–380 rounds per minute.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>camshafts</b> {{and fuel}} {{injection}} pump are driven by a duplex chain from the crankshaft. A separate single row chain drives the oil pump from the crankshaft.|$|R
50|$|In the {{internal}} combustion engine application the timing belt or chain connects the crankshaft to <b>the</b> <b>camshaft(s),</b> which in turn control the opening and closing of the engine's valves. A four-stroke engine requires that the valves open and close once every other revolution of the crankshaft. The timing belt does this. It has teeth to turn <b>the</b> <b>camshaft(s)</b> synchronised with <b>the</b> crankshaft, and is specifically designed for a particular engine. In some engine designs the timing belt may also be used to drive other engine components such as the water pump and oil pump.|$|R
50|$|Engine {{configuration}} is {{an engineering}} {{term for the}} layout of the major components of a reciprocating piston internal combustion engine. These components are the cylinders and crankshafts in particular but also, sometimes, <b>the</b> <b>camshaft(s).</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{timing of}} <b>the</b> <b>camshaft</b> can be {{advanced}} to produce better low RPM torque, or retarded for better high RPM power. Changing cam timing moves the overall power {{produced by the}} engine down or up the RPM scale. The amount of change is very little (usually < 5 deg), and affects valve to piston clearances.|$|E
25|$|In {{internal}} combustion engines with pistons, <b>the</b> <b>camshaft</b> {{is used to}} operate poppet valves. It consists of a cylindrical rod running {{the length of the}} cylinder bank with a number of oblong lobes protruding from it, one for each valve. The cam lobes force the valves open by pressing on the valve, or on some intermediate mechanism, as they rotate.|$|E
25|$|This gear was {{designed}} by Oberleutnant Eduard Zaparka. Drive was {{from the rear of}} <b>the</b> <b>camshaft</b> of a Hiero engine through a transmission shaft with Carden joints. The rate of fire, with the later Schwarzlose gun, was up to 500 rounds per minute. The machine gun had to be placed well forward, where it was inaccessible to the pilot, so that jams could not be cleared in flight.|$|E
50|$|VANOS is a {{variator}} {{system that}} varies {{the timing of}} the valves by moving the position of <b>the</b> <b>camshafts</b> in relation to the drive gear. The relative timing between inlet and exhaust valves is changed.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: A {{comparison}} of <b>the</b> standard Suzuki <b>camshaft</b> lobe profile with the base duration profile of <b>the</b> helical <b>camshaft</b> {{shows that they}} are virtually identical.|$|R
50|$|Toothed belts {{are used}} widely in {{mechanical}} devices, including sewing machines, photocopiers and many others. A major use of toothed belts is as the timing belt {{used to drive}} <b>the</b> <b>camshafts</b> within an automobile or motorcycle engine.|$|R
25|$|This {{model of}} SHO gained a {{reputation}} of being trouble-prone due to {{a large number of}} engine failures at around the 50,000-mile mark due to separation of <b>the</b> <b>camshaft</b> from its sprocket. However, this problem can be rectified by having the camshafts welded. Possibly because of this, this generation of SHO sold substantially worse than its predecessor, with sales peaking at 9,000 in 1997. As a result, the SHO was discontinued outright after the 1999 model year.|$|E
25|$|The R32 Skyline GT-R N1 street car {{marked the}} N1 engine's {{introduction}} to the consumer. R32, 33, and 34 N1 street cars were known for lack of amenities and their light weight. The R33 N1 engine and turbochargers were slightly revised, and the R34 N1 engine saw further improvement. <b>The</b> <b>camshaft</b> timing was altered slightly for more torque. R33 and R34 N1 turbochargers are the same size however R34 N1s use a ball bearing center section. NISMO states the ball bearings in the R34 N1 allow them to spool 400rpm faster than R33 N1.|$|E
25|$|The {{radial engine}} {{normally}} uses fewer cam lobes than other types. As with most four-strokes, the crankshaft takes two revolutions {{to complete the}} four strokes of each piston (intake, compression, combustion, exhaust). <b>The</b> <b>camshaft</b> ring is geared to spin slower and {{in the opposite direction}} to the crankshaft. The cam lobes are placed in two rows for the intake and exhaust. For the example, four cam lobes serve all five cylinders, whereas 10 would be required for a typical inline engine with the same number of cylinders and valves.|$|E
40|$|A {{combined}} lumped/finite element {{model of}} {{a portion of the}} desmodromic valve train of a racing motorbike engine was developed and validated in order to simulate the elastodynamic behaviour of such a particular timing system. The model includes the lumped parameter model of the belt transmission that drives <b>the</b> <b>camshafts,</b> <b>the</b> finite element model of <b>the</b> <b>camshafts,</b> and <b>the</b> lumped parameter model of two cam-valve mechanisms (one for each <b>camshaft).</b> <b>The</b> procedure to validate the model, based on experimental tests carried out on a test bench described here, is presented and discussed. The comparison between the numerical results and the experimental data shows that the effectiveness of the model is satisfactorily achieved. It will be possible, in a further study, to add the other cam-valve mechanisms and the missing external forces, in order to obtain a complete system model. Some possible applications of the presented model are provided in order to show how the overall model could be employed to perform both design optimisation and diagnostic...|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> dual {{overhead}} <b>camshafts</b> {{are driven}} by a single-stage roller chain of 8.0 mm (0.3-in) pitch, enabling a narrow included valve angle of 27.5°. <b>The</b> <b>camshafts</b> act on four valves per cylinder via bucket tappets. As in the recent Toyota engine practice, no clearance adjusting shim is employed. Valve diameters are 34.0 mm (1.3 in) for intake and 29.5 mm (1.2 in) for exhaust, with 8.0 mm (0.3-in) lift for both intake and exhaust. The four-vane VVT-i device is fitted on <b>the</b> intake <b>camshaft,</b> altering timing by 50°. The valve cover is made of magnesium to save weight.|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} analysed {{the influence}} of standard and modification variation camshaft’s profile on closing intake valve toward the torsion, power and specific fuel consumption of Otto Cycle Machine with Atkinson Cycle Approach. It was conduct to modify the cycle of otto to make it closer to the characteristic of Atkinson cycle. standard and modification variation camshaft’s profile on closing intake valve by modifying <b>the</b> <b>camshaft’s</b> profile causes <b>the</b> delaying of the valve closing process. Then, the result was compared with <b>the</b> standard <b>camshaft.</b> In <b>the</b> standard condition, the highest torsion machine was 5. 50 N-m by 2400 rpm, and the lower torsion machine was on 0. 86 N-m by 4300 rpm. In the modified condition, the highest torsion was 2. 36 N-m by 2800 rpm, and the lower torsion was 0. 65 N-m by 4300 rpm. On standardcondition the higher torsion was 1. 91 hp by 2600 rpm, and the lower was 0. 52 hp by 4300 rpm. On <b>the</b> modified <b>camshaft</b> condition,the highest was 0. 98 hp by 3200 rpm, and the lower was 0. 39 hp by 4300 rpm. The higher torsion and the power were obtained in <b>the</b> standard <b>camshaft</b> condition. Spesific Fuell Consumtion (SFC) in standard condition was lower than modify camshaft condition. On standard <b>camshaft,</b> <b>the</b> lowervalue was 0. 38 kg/hp-h by 2600 rpm,and on <b>the</b> modified <b>camshaft</b> <b>the</b> lower SFCin was 0. 91 kg/hp-h by 3200 rpm...|$|R
25|$|One {{significant}} difference was the incorporation of <b>the</b> <b>camshaft</b> and magneto drives into the propeller reduction gears {{at the front of}} the engine, rather than using a separate system of gears driven from the back end of the crankshaft; this allowed the overall length of the engine to be reduced as well as making the drive train more reliable and efficient. The drive for the supercharger was also taken off the front of the engine, which required a long shaft to run to its location at the back of the engine.|$|E
25|$|Billet Steel: When a {{high quality}} {{camshaft}} or low volume production is required, engine builders and camshaft manufacturers choose steel billet. This {{is a much more}} time consuming process, and is generally more expensive than other methods. However, the finished product is far superior. CNC lathes, CNC milling machines, and CNC camshaft grinders will be used during production. Different types of steel bar can be used, one example being EN40b. When manufacturing a camshaft from EN40b, <b>the</b> <b>camshaft</b> will also be heat treated via gas nitriding, which changes the micro-structure of the material. It gives a surface hardness of 55-60 HRC. These types of camshafts can be used in high-performance engines.|$|E
25|$|On September 9–10, 1925, Duff {{went to the}} high-banked Montlhéry track, near Paris, for {{an attempt}} at the {{absolute}} 24Hour Record. He had a special single-seater Weymann body on his Bentley and works driver Dudley Benjafield as his co-driver. In driving rain, they did the first 12hours at 97.7mph but missed the 12hour record. At 18 ½ hours, <b>the</b> <b>camshaft</b> drive failed, ending the attempt. He was able to claim two world records: 1,000 Kilometres in 6 hrs, 23 mins, 55 secs and 1,000 miles in 10 hrs 15 mins 59secs. On September 21, Duff returned to Montlhéry with Woolf Barnato as his co-driver. Driving on a damp track in heavy mist, they covered 2,280miles in 24hours, averaging 95.02mph. They beat the previous record, held by the 9-litre Renault of Garfield and Plessier, by over 7mph. Along the way, the 3-litre Bentley took 21 world records, including those for six and twelve hours, and 500, 1000, and 2000miles.|$|E
50|$|The OM 668 {{makes use}} of the common rail system. Compared to the otto engine M 166 it has four valves per {{cylinder}} instead of two. Two chain driven overhead <b>camshafts</b> are used. <b>The</b> intake <b>camshaft</b> is driven by a chain, <b>the</b> exhaust <b>camshaft</b> is connected to <b>the</b> intake <b>camshaft</b> with a gear. Another chain drives the oil pump from the crankshaft. All engines have a turbocharger and all engines with more than 44 kW power also have an intercooler. In 1997 the OM 668 was the smallest diesel engine by Mercedes-Benz.|$|R
50|$|The base or {{shortest}} duration {{profile of}} <b>the</b> helical <b>camshaft</b> system is {{almost identical to}} a standard production engine profile. <b>The</b> helical <b>camshaft</b> base profile belongs to the general group of lobe shapes which are used with pivoting cam followers, especially those with a fairly high rocker ratio, around 2:1.|$|R
50|$|Like {{the larger}} {{capacity}} M30 engine {{from which it}} is derived, the M20 has a SOHC and 2 valves per cylinder. While <b>the</b> M30 <b>camshaft</b> is chain driven, <b>the</b> M20 <b>camshaft</b> and auxiliary shaft are driven by a timing belt. Initially released with a carburetor, later models used Bosch fuel injection.|$|R
