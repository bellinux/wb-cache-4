[...] As a measure of their success in this effort, on 1 August 2005, during a round-table interview with reporters from five Texas newspapers, President Bush said that he believes schools should discuss intelligent design alongside evolution when teaching students {{about the origin of}} life. Bush, a conservative Christian, declined to go into detail on his personal views of the origin of life, but advocated the Teach the Controversy approach - [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>part</b> of education is to expose people to different schools of thought... you're asking me whether or not people ought to be exposed to different ideas, the answer is yes."

"Dr. John," [...] I began, [...] "Love is blind;" [...] {{but just}} then a blue subtle ray sped {{sideways}} from Dr. John's eye: {{it reminded me of}} old days, it reminded me of his picture: it half led me to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>part,</b> at least, of his professed persuasion of Miss Fanshawe's naïveté was assumed; it led me dubiously to conjecture that perhaps, in spite of his passion for her beauty, his appreciation of her foibles might possibly be less mistaken, more clear-sighted, than from his general language was presumable. After all it might be only a chance look, or at best the token of a merely momentary impression. Chance or intentional real or imaginary, it closed the conversation.|$|E

60|$|The Evangelist St. Luke says, the Devil besought {{him that}} he would not command them {{to go out into the}} Deep: Our learned Annotators <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>part</b> is not rightly render'd; adding, that they do not believe the Devil fears drowning; but with Submission, I believe the meaning is, that they would not be confin'd to the vast Ocean, where no Inhabitants being to be seen, they would be effectually imprison'd and tied down from doing Mischief, which would be a Hell to them; as to their going into the Swine, that might afford us some Allegory; but I am not {{disposed}} to jest with the Scripture, no nor with the Devil neither, farther than needs must.|$|E
60|$|It is very {{reasonable}} to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>part</b> {{at least of}} the inward response to spiritual yearnings is of similar origin to the visions, thoughts, and phrases that arise automatically when the mind has prepared itself to receive them. The devout man attunes his mind to holy ideas, he excludes alien thoughts, and he waits and watches in stillness. Gradually the darkness is lifted, {{the silence of the}} mind is broken, and the spiritual responses are heard in the way so often described by devout men of all religions. This seems to me precisely analogous to the automatic presentation of ordinary ideas to orators and literary men, and to the visions of which I spoke in the chapter on that subject. Dividuality replaces individuality, and one portion of the mind communicates with another portion as with a different person.|$|E

"It {{is healthy}} up here among the hills," [...] said the mother, also looking round at the {{landscape}} and thinking doubtless of a very different scene; [...] "they have an outdoor life and plenty of liberty. They have their ponies to ride, {{and there is a}} lake up above us that is a fine place for them to bathe and boat in; the three boys are there now, having their morning swim. The eldest is sixteen and he is allowed to have a gun, and there is some good wild fowl shooting to be had in the reed beds at the further end of the lake.

5000|$|El Camino was {{recorded}} in Nashville, Tennessee, at Easy Eye Sound Studio, which was opened by guitarist/vocalist Dan Auerbach in mid-2010 after he relocated from the group's long-time hometown of Akron, Ohio. Carney spoke of how the success of Brothers impacted the follow-up record: [...] "For me, there were physical jitters about everything that was going on. Seeing how big the shows were getting, feeling like people were paying attention, kind of made me anxious, and I <b>think</b> <b>that's</b> <b>part</b> of the reason El Caminos songs are so fast. I think we wanted to just muscle through it." [...] Despite the growing expectations of the band, Carney said that the El Camino recording sessions were much more relaxed than those for Brothers, during {{which he had been}} dealing with his divorce.|$|R
6000|$|... 51. I {{believe that}} you can bring forward no other serious {{objection}} to the principles for which I am pleading. They are so simple, and, it seems to me, so incontrovertible, that I trust you will not leave this room, without determining, as you have opportunity, {{to do something to}} advance this long-neglected art of domestic architecture. The reasons I have laid before you would have weight, even were I to ask you to go to some considerable expenditure beyond what you at present are accustomed to devote to such purposes; but nothing more would be needed than the diversion of expenditures, at present scattered and unconsidered, into a single and effective channel. Nay, the mere interest of the money which we are accustomed to keep dormant by us in the form of plate and jewelry, would alone be enough to sustain a school of magnificent architecture. And although, in highly wrought plate, and in finely designed jewelry, noble art may occasionally exist, yet in general both jewels and services of silver are matters of ostentation, much more than sources of intellectual pleasure. There are also many evils connected with them--they are a care to their possessors, a temptation to the dishonest, and a trouble and bitterness to the poor. So that I cannot but <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>part</b> of the wealth which now lies buried in these doubtful luxuries, might most wisely and kindly be thrown into a form which would give perpetual pleasure, not to its possessor only, but to thousands besides, and neither tempt the unprincipled, nor inflame the envious, nor mortify the poor; while, supposing that your own dignity was dear to you, this, you may rely upon it, would be more impressed upon others by the nobleness of your house-walls than by the glistening of your sideboards.|$|E
6000|$|We {{went to see}} the Ocean, {{and that}} is {{probably}} the best place of all our coast to go to. If you go by water, you may experience what it is to leave and to approach these shores; you may see the Stormy Petrel by the way, [Greek: thalassodroma,] running over the sea, and if the weather is but a little thick, may lose sight of the land in mid-passage. I do not know where there is another beach in the Atlantic States, attached to the mainland, so long, {{and at the same time}} so straight, and completely uninterrupted by creeks or coves or fresh-water rivers or marshes; for though there may be clear places on the map, they would probably be found by the foot traveller to be intersected by creeks and marshes; certainly there is none where there is a double way, such as I have described, a beach and a bank, which at the same time shows you the land and the sea, and part of the time two seas. The Great South Beach of Long Island, which I have since visited, is longer still without an inlet, but it is literally a mere sand-bar, exposed, several miles from the Island, and not the edge of a continent wasting before the assaults of the Ocean. Though wild and desolate, as it wants the bold bank, it possesses but half the grandeur of Cape Cod in my eyes, nor is the imagination contented with its southern aspect. The only other beaches of great length on our Atlantic coast, which I have heard sailors speak of, are those of Barnegat on the Jersey shore, and Currituck between Virginia and North Carolina; but these, like the last, are low and narrow sandbars, lying off the coast, and separated from the mainland by lagoons. Besides, as you go farther south, the tides are feebler, and cease to add variety and grandeur to the shore. On the Pacific side of our country also no doubt there is good walking to be found; a recent writer and dweller there tells us that [...] "the coast from Cape Disappointment (or the Columbia River) to Cape Flattery (at the Strait of Juan de Fuca) is nearly north and south, and can be travelled almost its entire length on a beautiful sand-beach," [...] with the exception of two bays, four or five rivers, and a few points jutting into the sea. The common shell-fish found there seem to be often of corresponding types, if not identical species, with those of Cape Cod. The beach which I have described, however, is not hard enough for carriages, but must be explored on foot. When one carriage has passed along, a following one sinks deeper still in its rut. It has at present no name any more than fame. That portion south of Nauset Harbor is commonly called Chatham Beach. The part in Eastham is called Nauset Beach, and off Wellfleet and Truro the Back-side, or sometimes, perhaps, Cape Cod Beach. I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>part</b> which extends without interruption from Nauset Harbor to Race Point should be called Cape Cod Beach, and do so speak of it.|$|E

500|$|Some viewers {{criticized the}} graphic nudity {{seen in the}} pilot, {{especially}} in the US. Heller commented, [...] "Romans didn't have our body shame and fear of sexuality.

2500|$|Later, on August 10, 2007, Jon Foreman {{revealed}} that the band had severed ties with Columbia Records in order to release music as an Indie band. [...] "Neither party has any hard feelings," [...] {{he said of the}} split a few months later. [...] "I think for us, the reason why we signed with Columbia was because of the people that were there. So it's very understandable when all those people are gone, you don't hold any real bad feelings or good feelings towards a company name. I <b>think</b> <b>that's</b> <b>part</b> of the problem with the corporate entity as a whole is that there's no true responsibility." [...] Later in October, the band announced that they had created a new record label called lowercase people records, in order to better make a direct connection with their fans.|$|R
5000|$|Satoshi Kanazawa <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> <b>part</b> of {{the success}} of eHarmony can be {{explained}} by the high cost of entry in terms of time required to fulfill the initial questionnaire—over 18 hours, but other sources put the time to complete the relationship questionnaire at approximately one hour. Using Laurence Iannaccone's original idea that success of fundamentalist churches is explained by the high demands imposed on their members, Kanazawa hypothesizes that a similar self-selection mechanism is at work with eHarmony: [...] "they select their members very carefully, and only admit those who are very committed (or desperate; if anyone who chooses to join eHarmony is truly desperate to get married, then it can potentially and partially explain why it produces such a high proportion of all marriages in the US)." [...] Another factor suggested by Dan Ariely is the limited choice of partners offered, which may make the decision easier for some.source ...|$|R
5000|$|Networked feminism's {{impact is}} {{somewhat}} limited because {{not everyone has}} access to the internet.

A lot of people are online but not everybody, not by a long shot." ...|$|E
50|$|I {{will say}} that I'm not, I don't want to sound that like I'm anti-drug, because I'm not anti-drug. I {{happen to be a}} drug addict. And when I take a drug, I can't stop. And um, or if I have a drink, I {{continue}} drinking until I black out. So, I had to stop. But, I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>part</b> of {{that has to do with}} my, perhaps my environment, but I think a great deal of it has to do with genetic physical causes.|$|E
5000|$|These {{are things}} I am not proud of, and I {{find it hard}} to speak {{publicly}} about them and to tease out what was right from what was wrong.

It was this knowledge that we just couldn't handle; it was too big. We didn't know what to do. In a way I still don't {{know what to do with}} this knowledge. I don't know what needs to be done now, and it's still eating away at me just as it did 30 years ago. Mark Rudd ...|$|E
500|$|A {{co-owner}} for Swedish lifestyle magazine Millennium, Blomkvist {{is devoted}} to exposing the corruptions and malfeasance of government, attracting infamy for his tendency to [...] "go too far". Craig competed with Brad Pitt, George Clooney, Viggo Mortensen, and Johnny Depp as candidates for the role. Initial concerns over schedule conflicts with the production of Cowboys & Aliens (2011) and Skyfall (2012) prompted Craig to postpone the casting process. Given the uncertainty surrounding Skyfall following Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's bankruptcy, Sony Pictures Entertainment and DreamWorks worked out a schedule and Craig agreed to take the part. The British actor was required to gain weight and adopted a neutral accent to befit Stockholm's worldly cultural fabric. Having read the book amid its [...] "initial craze", Craig commented, [...] "It's one of those books you just don't put down" [...] There's just this immediate feeling that bad {{things are going to}} happen and I <b>think</b> <b>that's</b> <b>part</b> of why they've been so readable for people." ...|$|R

50|$|Every day we {{comment on}} things that aren't formal cases. Part of {{our job is to}} {{identify}} discrimination and to work to address it, but more often it is putting out a statement, having a debate, meeting with people, discussing and understanding the impact. Whenever we comment on what someone has said or done, we comment because we want them to think about the Human Rights Code, and the implications of it, and to think seriously about what they're saying or doing does to other people. I think that's an important and legitimate part of our role...
