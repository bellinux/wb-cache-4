He began tackling the imbalance from the retail sector, whose success up to <b>that</b> <b>point</b> <b>was</b> largely dependent on foreign companies. He drew up plans to protect Chinese industries' competitive position within a domestic market that was quickly being crowded out by foreign competition.|$|E
5|$|With {{the coming}} of night, most of the crowd that had {{accompanied}} the storming of the palace earlier that day departed, intending to resume looting the next day. In the meantime, Alexios III, who resided in the Blachernae Palace in the city's northwestern corner, rallied for a counter-strike. A small force was dispatched with boats around the city's peninsula to the Hodegetria Monastery north of the Great Palace. It was led by the emperor's son-in-law Alexios Palaiologos, who at <b>that</b> <b>point</b> <b>was</b> likely regarded as his heir-apparent, and quickly made contact with the Varangians who had held out in the palace's northern parts.|$|E

5|$|Around 820 Coenwulf forced Wulfred into an {{unfavourable}} settlement {{by which}} Wulfred gained {{control over the}} debated monasteries {{in exchange for a}} large payment of gold and the loss of a very large estate to the king. Nor did Coenwulf and his followers quickly cede control of Minster and Reculver to the archbishop. In September 822, Wulfred reached a settlement with Coenwulf's successor Ceolwulf signified by the consecration of Ceolwulf as king, which had been delayed about a year because of the dispute with the archbishop. After Ceolwuf's deposition in 823 Wulfred's situation improved. The new Mercian king, Beornwulf, presided over another council at Clofesho in 825 where the conflict was finally settled in Wulfred's favour and an account of the whole conflict up to <b>that</b> <b>point</b> <b>was</b> written down. Coenwulf's daughter Cwenthryth, abbess of Winchcombe and Minster, paid compensation to Wulfred and lost control over the houses in Kent. Later in 825 (or possibly the following year), however, Kent was lost to Mercia after Egbert of Wessex defeated Beornwulf at Ellendun. Relations between Wulfred and the new West Saxon rulers were cold, and coinage in Wulfred's name appears to have ceased for a time, though it had been restored before Wulfred's death in 832. Final settlement of the debate over lordship of monasteries came in 838 at Kingston, shortly before Egbert's death.|$|E
5|$|Miller was {{selected}} to his first All-Star Game via the player balloting. His ERA up to <b>that</b> <b>point</b> <b>was</b> 2.07, which was the third lowest in all of baseball. However, Miller didn't appear in the game at all. The two-hitter against the Marlins would serve as Miller's last win until his final start of the season, on October 4, when he pitched eight innings in a shutout effort against the St. Louis Cardinals. Miller set a new franchise record winless streak of 24, despite quality starts in fourteen of those games. His ERA during the streak was 3.83, and was marred by a rocky September, in which he recorded a 7.11 ERA. Until the October 4, 6–0 win against his former team, Miller's run support was at 2.3 runs per nine innings, ranking him third {{on a list of}} worst run support compiled since 1975. He finished the season with 2.6 runs of support per nine innings, a 6–17 record, 3.02 ERA, and 173 strikeouts. A run support average of 2.38 ranked tenth worst in MLB history.|$|E
5|$|The high {{mountain}} Stage 14 into the Italian Alps saw Contador rise to second overall, just five seconds behind race leader Gabriele Bosisio. The next day, Contador finished twelve minutes ahead of Bosisio {{and took the}} race leader's pink jersey. His main rival at <b>that</b> <b>point</b> <b>was</b> Riccardo Riccò, who had gained 16 seconds on him that day and was only 33 back overall. Contador padded his lead over Riccò slightly in short time trial in Stage 16, and stayed out of trouble in Stages 17 and 18, stages where the contenders all finished together. The long and mountainous Stage 19 saw Riccò and Danilo Di Luca both put time into Contador with late attacks, {{but not enough to}} take the jersey from him. Di Luca found himself effected the next day, losing over five minutes and falling from contention, but Contador and Riccò finished together and were separated by just 4 seconds entering the Stage 21 time trial. Riccò was unable to challenge Contador in the Giro's finale, finishing 68th on the stage and losing close to two minutes to Contador, who was 11th. Though neither Contador himself nor anyone from the team won any stage in the Giro, Contador took the overall victory in the General Classification.|$|E
