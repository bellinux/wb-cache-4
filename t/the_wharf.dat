5|$|Combwich Pill, a small creek {{near the}} mouth of the river, had been used for {{shipping}} since the 14th century. From the 1830s, with the development of the brick and tile industry in the Combwich area, <b>the</b> <b>wharf</b> was used by two local brickyards to import coal and export tiles to Wales and parts of Gloucestershire. This traffic ceased in the 1930s; in the late 1950s <b>the</b> <b>wharf</b> was taken over and upgraded by the Central Electricity Generating Board (CEGB) to bring in heavy materials for the Hinkley Point nuclear power stations. Construction of Hinkley Point A nuclear power station was ordered in 1957, with a scheduled completion date of 1960, but was not completed until 1965. This was followed by Hinkley Point B nuclear power station, which began operation in 1976. It is proposed to use <b>the</b> <b>wharf</b> again for the construction of Hinkley Point C.|$|E

5|$|Late in its duration, Gert passed just {{southeast}} of Newfoundland before becoming extratropical, producing wave heights of 77.4ft (23.6m) offshore and 30ft (9m) onshore. In St. Bride's along the Avalon Peninsula, a large wave severely damaged a wharf, destroying five boats and damaging 45 others. Along <b>the</b> <b>wharf,</b> a wave swept three {{people into the}} ocean, hospitalizing one of them. <b>The</b> <b>wharf</b> required $2million (1999CAD, $1.9million 1999USD) in repairs, forcing its closure. Further west, high waves damaged a fish plant in Lord's Cove. Gale-force winds extended across southeastern Newfoundland, and in the Grand Banks a station reported winds of 74mph (120km/h). Onshore, the winds downed trees and caused power outages, primarily in the St. John's area. In addition, the adverse conditions from Gert prompted the cancellation of flights to and from St. John's International Airport.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> Cairns <b>wharves</b> site is {{important}} because of its aesthetic significance as <b>the</b> <b>wharves,</b> number 2 gate, White's shed and wharf sheds, numbers 2 and 3, including the clock tower, contribute to the streetscape of inner-city Cairns. <b>The</b> <b>wharves</b> run {{at right angles to}} the main city streets of Cairns, terminating the long views down Abbott, Lake and Grafton streets south. These views are framed by the mountains and mangroves behind and across Trinity Inlet. The clock tower is particularly of aesthetic significance as a local landmark.|$|R
5|$|The {{restaurant}} was converted into {{housing in the}} 1950s, and in May 1970 the station building was demolished {{to make room for}} a new bus station.

Most of the line and infrastructure is however intact.|$|E
5|$|A further Bill in 1740 sought {{powers to}} improve the river from Barnby Dun to Fishlake Ferry. Despite serious opposition, which {{included}} the merchants and traders of Doncaster as well as Doncaster Corporation, the Bill was passed, giving the company new powers to make the river deeper and create a cut to avoid the shallows at Stainforth and Bramwith. Work on this northern section started almost immediately. The southern section to Tinsley was navigable by 1751, although <b>the</b> <b>wharf</b> and warehouse had not been completed by that date, and the towpath from Rotherham was not completed until 1822.|$|E
5|$|Kuching, {{like most}} towns in Sarawak, has {{connections}} to other urban centres and settlements by water transport. Between {{the banks of}} Sarawak River, near the city centre, many 'tambang' (traditional roofed wooden sampan) can be seen carrying passengers from one riverbank to another. For those staying along the river banks, it is a short way to getting to the city-proper. <b>The</b> <b>wharf</b> for express boats servicing transport to further areas such as Sibu and Bintulu, {{is located in the}} east of the city at the Sim Kheng Hong Port (formerly known as the Tanah Puteh Port) in Pending.|$|E

5|$|Meeker's first {{employment}} in the Pacific Northwest was unloading a ship that had docked at Portland.

5|$|On June 2, 1775, Jones' ships {{arrived in}} the port at Machias. However, they were met with {{resistance}} from the townspeople when Jones refused to sell his pork and flour unless {{he was allowed to}} load lumber for Boston. In a meeting on June 6, 1775, the townspeople voted against doing business with Jones. The hostile climate forced Jones to take action by ordering Moore to bring the Margaretta within firing distance of the town. The threat prompted the townspeople to meet for a second time, and they voted to permit trade. The Unity was docked at <b>the</b> <b>wharf</b> to begin unloading the supplies.|$|E
5|$|The fort {{was linked}} to a jetty, Coalhouse Wharf, on the {{riverside}} a short distance to the south. A standard gauge railway track led from the fort's interior to the jetty and was used to bring guns and supplies from <b>the</b> <b>wharf.</b> The heaviest guns were transported to and from Coalhouse Fort (and other Thames forts) aboard two specialised gun barges called Gog and Magog, built in 1886 and 1900 respectively and used until the 1960s.

5|$|The {{terminus}} of the Rother Navigation {{was on a}} side stream, at {{the southern}} edge of Midhurst. There was a wharf and basin, close to a road which is still called <b>The</b> <b>Wharf,</b> and an ashlar bridge crosses the navigation between <b>the</b> <b>wharf</b> and the junction with the main river. It was built in 1794, and was restored in 1977 to commemorate the silver jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II. The first lock was near Little Topham farm. There was a lock cut across a loop to the north. Costers Brook, which flows north from springs near Cocking, and then alongside the river for a short distance, joins below the site of the lock. The bridge at South Ambersham was built of stone rubble in 1791, with a main arch across the navigation and a smaller arch to the north, which has been repaired with brick. Moorland Lock was on a straight cut across a large meander to the south, close to Moorlands Farm. Lodsbridge Lock also bypasses a meander to the south, which fed Lodsbridge Mill. The mill building dates from the eighteenth century, and has been converted into a house. The seventeenth-century timber-framed mill house is also a listed building. There was a motte castle immediately to the south of the mill. A modern timber yard and saw mill is located {{to the north of the}} lock site, and Lods Bridge, which carries a minor road over the river, dates from the construction of the navigation. The River Lod joins on the north bank just below the bridge.|$|E
5|$|There was a wharf on {{the river}} in 1874, served by a railway line, and sidings which were used to collect shingle. By 1909, <b>the</b> <b>wharf</b> had been {{replaced}} by a landing stage slightly further downstream, which was also served by the railway. As it nears the sea, a Martello tower, built in 1806 to protect against French invasion, stands {{to the west of the}} channel. It is numbered 28, and was one of many such structures built at the time. Nearby is an Inshore Rescue station, run by the Royal National Lifeboat Institution The river then enters Rye Bay, part of the English Channel.|$|E
5|$|Cley {{and nearby}} Blakeney had been prosperous and {{important}} ports in the Middle Ages, but land reclamation schemes, especially those by Henry Calthorpe in 1640 {{just to the}} west of Cley, led to the silting up of the shipping channel and relocation of <b>the</b> <b>wharf.</b> Further enclosure in the mid-1820s aggravated the problem, and also allowed the shingle ridge at the beach to block the former tidal channel to the Salthouse marshes to the east of Cley. In an attempt to halt the decline, Thomas Telford was consulted in 1822, but his recommendations for reducing the silting were not implemented, and by 1840 almost all of Cley's trade had been lost to Blakeney and other Norfolk ports. The population stagnated, and the value of all property decreased sharply. In the mid-nineteenth century, the Lord of the Manor constructed the present road to the beach in exchange for closing the ancient right of way across the marshes.|$|E

25|$|White also {{discussed}} the District of Columbia's lengthy history regarding <b>the</b> regulation of <b>wharves</b> and docks. In his view, the city's treatment of <b>the</b> <b>wharves</b> demonstrated that <b>the</b> <b>wharves</b> were private property on private riverbed land, not private property licensed to be emplaced on a riverbed {{held in the}} public trust. White interpreted Potomac Steam-Boat Co. as superimposing an easement on top of existing riparian water rights. It was not, as the majority held, the government's purpose all along to bound the plots of land with Water Street.|$|R
