5|$|In his Critique of Pure Reason, German philosopher Immanuel Kant {{stated that}} no {{successful}} argument for God's existence arises from reason alone. In his Critique of Practical Reason {{he went on}} to argue that, despite the failure of these arguments, morality requires that God's existence is assumed, owing to practical reason. Rather than proving the existence of God, Kant was attempting to demonstrate that all moral thought requires the assumption that God exists. Kant argued that humans are obliged to bring about the summum bonum: the two central aims of moral virtue and happiness, where happiness arises out of virtue. As ought implies can, Kant argued, it must be possible for the summum bonum to be achieved. He accepted that it is not within the power of humans to bring the summum bonum about, because we cannot ensure that virtue always leads <b>to</b> <b>happiness,</b> so there must be a higher power who has the power to create an afterlife where virtue can be rewarded by happiness.|$|E

25|$|Professor Ruut Veenhoven {{showed that}} social {{security}} payments {{do not seem to}} add <b>to</b> <b>happiness.</b> This {{may be due to the}} fact that non-self-earned income (e.g., from a lottery) does not add <b>to</b> <b>happiness</b> in general either. Happiness may be the mind's reward to a useful action. However, Johan Norberg of CIS, a free enterprise economy think tank, presents a hypothesis that as people who think that they themselves control their lives are more happy, paternalist institutions may decrease happiness.|$|E

25|$|Simple hedonism is {{the view}} that {{physical}} pleasure is the ultimate good. However, the ancient philosopher Epicurus used the word 'pleasure' in {{a more general sense}} that encompassed a range of states from bliss to contentment to relief.

25|$|Aristotle's {{analysis}} of procreation describes an active, ensouling masculine element bringing life to an inert, passive female element.

25|$|Happiness is {{typically}} measured using subjective measures – e.g. self-reported surveys – and/or objective measures. One concern {{has always been}} the accuracy and reliability of people's responses <b>to</b> <b>happiness</b> surveys. Objective measures such as lifespan, income, and education are often used as well as or instead of subjectively reported happiness, though this assumes that they generally produce happiness, which while plausible may not necessarily be the case. The terms quality of life or well-being are often used to encompass these more objective measures.|$|E

25|$|American beat {{generation}} writer Jack Kerouac {{became a}} well-known literary Buddhist, for his roman à clef The Dharma Bums and other works. Also influential was Alan Watts, who wrote {{several books on}} Zen and Buddhism. The steady influx of refugees from Tibet in the 1960s and from Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia in the 1970s led to renewed interest in Buddhism, and the countercultural movements of the 1960s proved fertile ground for its Westward diffusion. Buddhism supposedly promised a more methodical path <b>to</b> <b>happiness</b> than Christianity and {{a way out of}} the perceived spiritual bankruptcy and complexity of Western life.|$|E

25|$|A gay couple, José María Di Bello and Alex Freyre, were {{forbidden}} to marry in Buenos Aires. According to Di Bello and Freyre, articles 172 and 188 of the civil code (restricting marriage to people of different genders) was unconstitutional; judge Gabriela Seijas agreed, and they married (the first same-sex marriage in Latin America) in 2009. Macri did not appeal the ruling, saying that same-sex marriage was becoming universally accepted and individuals had a right <b>to</b> <b>happiness.</b> He compared the controversy with the sanctioning of divorce during the 1980s; highly controversial at first, it was eventually accepted. A federal law permitting same-sex marriage was passed the following year.|$|E
25|$|If Not Now, When ? is {{an album}} that expresses sincere love, peace, and happiness. Each song taps {{into its own}} theme that speaks on love and “hailing halleluiah every day.” The songs speak on life and the process and journey to {{discovering}} happiness. Although much of the album takes on a very peaceful tone, Incubus also incorporates a political perspective in their song Thieves. The song thieves speak on “the paragon of civilization.” In this song, he poses the question “why should the thieves have all the fun, selling water by the river?” He references to “god fearing white Americans” and insinuates that in America, that privilege is the ticket <b>to</b> <b>happiness.</b>|$|E
25|$|Machiavelli {{felt that}} his early {{schooling}} {{along the lines}} of a traditional classical education was essentially useless for the purpose of understanding politics. Nevertheless, he advocated intensive study of the past, particularly regarding the founding of a city, which he felt was a key to understanding its later development. Moreover, he studied the way people lived and aimed to inform leaders how they should rule and even how they themselves should live. For example, Machiavelli denies that living virtuously necessarily leads <b>to</b> <b>happiness.</b> And Machiavelli viewed misery as one of the vices that enables a prince to rule. Machiavelli stated that {{it would be best to}} be both loved and feared. But since the two rarely come together, anyone compelled to choose will find greater security in being feared than in being loved. In much of Machiavelli's work, it seems that the ruler must adopt unsavory policies for the sake of the continuance of his regime.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} Anna Christie {{searches for}} happiness in Eugene O?Neill?s Anna Christie. Anna Christie has a terrible childhood, {{since she was}} left by her father. Therefore she lacks of affection and feels lonely. She wants <b>to</b> search for <b>happiness.</b> I want <b>to</b> know the causes and her ways <b>to</b> search for <b>happiness.</b> <b>To</b> analyze why and how Anna Christie searches for happiness, I use literary approach, namely conflict and characterization. I also use the concept of <b>happiness</b> <b>to</b> support my analysis. Through the analysis, I find {{out that there are}} two causes that make Anna Christie searches for happiness. First, she lacks affection and the second she is lonely. She lacks affection because she never felt the love from her parents and her relatives. She is also lonely. She has nobody to share her problems with, so she wants <b>to</b> find <b>happiness.</b> In order <b>to</b> find <b>happiness,</b> Anna Christie has to look for her father and accept the reality of her father?s condition. As a result, she finds that the sea can give her the happiness which she never got...|$|R
