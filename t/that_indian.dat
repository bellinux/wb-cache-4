5|$|Grant's claims <b>that</b> <b>Indian</b> spiritual traditions like Tantra and Yoga {{correlate}} to Western esoteric traditions, {{and that}} both stem from a core, ancient source, has parallels in the perennial philosophy promoted by the Traditionalist School of esotericists. However, Grant differed from Traditionalists like René Guénon and Ananda Coomaraswamy in his positive assessment of Western occultism. Moreover, Grant's appreciation of Asian spiritual traditions has {{much in common with}} Theosophy, although Grant differed from the Theosophical movement with his valorisation of the 'left hand path'.|$|E
5|$|The Supreme Court held <b>that</b> <b>Indian</b> tribes have {{a common}} law cause of action for possessory land claims based upon {{aboriginal}} title, that the Nonintercourse Act did not preempt that cause of action, and {{that the cause of}} action was not barred by a statute of limitations, abatement, implicit federal ratification, or nonjusticiability. Four dissenting justices would have held for the counties on the defense of laches, a question which the majority did not reach, but expressed doubts about.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the draft}} treaty of January 1916, apprehensions grew in Delhi of trouble from tribes in the North-West Frontier Province. That spring, Indian {{intelligence}} received rumours {{of letters from}} Habibullah to his tribal chiefs exhorting holy jihad. Alarmed, Hardinge called 3,000 tribal chiefs to a grand Jirga in Peshawar, where aerial bombing displays were held; Hardinge demonstrated the Empire's goodwill by increasing British subsidies to the chiefs. These measures helped convince the frontier tribes that Britain's wartime position remained strong and <b>that</b> <b>Indian</b> defences were impregnable.|$|E

5|$|Some {{uncertainty}} {{exists in}} the distribution data for the spinner shark due to confusion with the blacktip shark. In the western Atlantic Ocean, it occurs from North Carolina to the northern Gulf of Mexico, including the Bahamas and Cuba, and from southern Brazil to Argentina. In the eastern Atlantic, it occurs from off North Africa to Namibia. In the Indian Ocean, it is found from South Africa and Madagascar, to the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, to India and nearby islands, to Java and Sumatra. In the Pacific Ocean, it occurs off Japan, Vietnam, Australia, and possibly the Philippines. Parasitological evidence suggests <b>that</b> <b>Indian</b> Ocean spinner sharks have passed through the Suez Canal into the Mediterranean Sea, becoming Lessepsian migrants.|$|E
5|$|There were fears {{among some}} traders in India <b>that</b> <b>Indian</b> goods {{would find a}} limited outlet in Tibet, while China would {{have access to a}} ready market in Sikkim and West Bengal.

5|$|In 1796 Georges Cuvier {{presented}} {{a paper on}} living and fossil elephants comparing skeletal remains of Indian and African elephants to fossils of mammoths and of an animal he would later name mastodon utilizing comparative anatomy. He established {{for the first time}} <b>that</b> <b>Indian</b> and African elephants were different species, and that mammoths differed from both and must be extinct. He further concluded that the mastodon was another extinct species that also differed from Indian or African elephants, more so than mammoths. Cuvier made another powerful demonstration of the power of comparative anatomy in paleontology when he {{presented a}} second paper in 1796 on a large fossil skeleton from Paraguay, which he named Megatherium and identified as a giant sloth by comparing its skull to those of two living species of tree sloth. Cuvier’s ground-breaking work in paleontology and comparative anatomy led to the widespread acceptance of extinction. It also led Cuvier to advocate the geological theory of catastrophism to explain the succession of organisms revealed by the fossil record. He also pointed out that since mammoths and wooly rhinoceros were not the same species as the elephants and rhinoceros currently living in the tropics, their fossils could not be used as evidence for a cooling earth.|$|E

In April, 1879 Judge Dundy ruled that Standing Bear and other Ponca were [...] "people" [...] who able to bring petitions for habeas corpus, and <b>that</b> <b>Indians</b> who had severed their relationships with their tribes could not be ordered to a reservation against their will.

In 1884, the U.S. Supreme Court rejected Elk's petition, holding <b>that</b> <b>Indians</b> born in tribal relations in the United States could only become citizens under specific federal laws.
