The large hill competition was won by Austria's Ernst Vettori, the normal hill event was won by Finland's Toni Nieminen and the team event was won by Finland.

5|$|Luna {{was one of}} <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> {{action in}} Manila on 13 August 1898, when the Americans landed troops in Intramuros. Since June 1898, Manila had been {{completely}} surrounded by the revolutionary troops. Colonel Luciano San Miguel occupied Mandaluyong; General Pío del Pilar, Makati; General Mariano Noriel, Parañaque; Colonel Enrique Pacheco, Navotas, Tambobong, and Caloocan. General Gregorio del Pilar marched through Sampaloc, taking Tondo, Divisoria, and Azcárraga; Noriel cleared Singalong and Paco, and held Ermita and Malate. Luna thought the Filipinos should enter Intramuros to have joint occupation of the walled city. But Aguinaldo, heeding the advice of General Wesley Merritt and Commodore (later Admiral) George Dewey, whose fleet had moored in Manila Bay, sent Luna to the trenches where he ordered his troops to fire on the Americans. After the chaos following the American occupation, {{at a meeting in}} Ermita, Luna tried to complain to American officers about the disorderly conduct of their soldiers.|$|E

5|$|With {{the death}} of President Harrison, Tyler became the first vice {{president}} to succeed to the presidency without election. After Harrison's one-month term, Tyler served longer than any president in U.S. history not elected to the office. To forestall constitutional uncertainty, Tyler immediately took the oath of office, moved into the White House, and assumed full presidential powers, a precedent that governed future successions and was codified in the Twenty-fifth Amendment. A strict constructionist, Tyler found much of the Whig platform unconstitutional, and vetoed several of his party's bills. Believing {{that the president should}} set policy rather than Congress, he sought to bypass the Whig establishment, most notably Kentucky Senator Henry Clay. Most of Tyler's Cabinet resigned soon into his term, and the Whigs, dubbing him His Accidency, expelled him from the party. Tyler was <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> his veto of legislation overridden by Congress. Although he faced a stalemate on domestic policy, he had several foreign-policy achievements, including the Webster–Ashburton Treaty with Britain and the Treaty of Wanghia with Qing China.|$|E

The best overview of Leibniz's writings on calculus may be found in Bos (1974).|$|E
25|$|After Huxley {{the most}} {{important}} influence on his thought was August Weismann, the German zoologist who rejected Lamarckism, and wholeheartedly advocated natural selection as the key force in evolution {{at a time when}} other biologists had doubts. Weismann's separation of germplasm (genetic material) from soma (somatic cells) was an idea which took many years before its significance was generally appreciated. Lankester was one of <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> its importance: his full acceptance of selection came after reading Weismann's essays, some of which he translated into English.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1950s, French New Wave critics, {{especially}} Éric Rohmer, Claude Chabrol and François Truffaut, were among <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> and promote Hitchcock's films as artistic works. Hitchcock {{was one of}} the first directors to whom they applied their auteur theory, which stresses the artistic authority of the director in the filmmaking process. Hitchcock's innovations and vision have influenced a great number of filmmakers, producers, and actors. His influence helped start a trend for film directors to control artistic aspects of their films without answering to the film's producer.|$|E

25|$|During this period, Stieglitz became {{increasingly}} intrigued {{with a more}} modern visual aesthetics for photography. He became aware {{of what was going}} on in avant-garde painting and sculpture and found that pictorialism no longer represented the future – it was the past. He was influenced in part by painter Charles Sheeler and by photographer Paul Strand. In 1915, Strand, who had been coming to see shows at 291 for many years, introduced Stieglitz to a new photographic vision that was embodied by the bold lines of everyday forms. Stieglitz was one of <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the beauty and grace of Strand's style, and he gave Strand a major exhibit at 291. He also devoted almost the entire last issue of Camera Work to his photographs.|$|E
25|$|Clement Greenberg {{included}} {{the work of}} both Morris Louis and Kenneth Noland in a show that he did at the Kootz Gallery in the early 1950s. Clem was <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> their potential. He invited them up to New York in 1953, I think it was, to Helen's studio to see a painting that she had just done called Mountains and Sea, a very, very beautiful painting, which was in a sense, out of Pollock and out of Gorky. It also {{was one of the}} first stain pictures, one of the first large field pictures in which the stain technique was used, perhaps the first one. Louis and Noland saw the picture unrolled on the floor of her studio and went back to Washington, DC., and worked together for a while, working at the implications of this kind of painting.|$|E
25|$|Fossey {{turned down}} an offer to join the Henrys on an African tour {{due to lack of}} finances, but in 1963 she {{borrowed}} $8,000 (one year's salary), took out her life savings and went on a seven-week visit to Africa. In September 1963, she arrived in Nairobi, Kenya. While there, she met actor William Holden, owner of Treetops Hotel, who introduced her to her safari guide, John Alexander. Alexander became her guide for the next seven weeks through Kenya, Tanzania, Democratic Republic of Congo, and Rhodesia. Alexander's route included visits to Tsavo, Africa's largest national park; the saline lake of Manyara, famous for attracting giant flocks of flamingos; and the Ngorongoro Crater, well known for its abundant wildlife. The final two sites for her visit were Olduvai Gorge in Tanzania (the archeological site of Louis and Mary Leakey); and Mt. Mikeno in Congo, where in 1959, American zoologist George Schaller had carried out a yearlong pioneering study of the mountain gorilla. At Olduvai Gorge, Fossey met the Leakeys while they were examining the area for hominid fossils. Leakey talked to Fossey about the work of Jane Goodall and the importance of long-term research of the great apes. Although she had broken her ankle while visiting the Leakeys, by October 16, Fossey was staying in Walter Baumgartel's small hotel in Uganda, the Travellers Rest. Baumgartel, an advocate of gorilla conservation, was among <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the benefits that tourism could bring to the area, and he introduced Fossey to Kenyan wildlife photographers Joan and Alan Root. The couple agreed to allow Fossey and Alexander to camp behind their own camp, and it was during these few days that Fossey first encountered wild mountain gorillas. After staying with friends in Rhodesia, Fossey returned home to Louisville to repay her loans. She published three articles in The Courier-Journal newspaper, detailing her visit to Africa.|$|E

500|$|From 1816 he was {{involved}} in mining research and projects. He also actively supported industrial development in Poland.

He was also involved in the development of ceramic and textile industries, and improving the transport infrastructure (roads, canals).

Between 1816 and 1824 he was the de facto minister of industry of the Congress Poland (styled officially the [...] "director of the Department of Trade, Crafts and Industry") and initiated construction of the Old Polish Industrial Area (Staropolski Okręg Przemysłowy). As his projects did not result in quick returns, he incurred increasing criticism, and eventually resigned from his position in 1824.|$|E
