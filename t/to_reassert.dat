5|$|After {{decades of}} upheavals and rebellions mounted by Arab tribes in the Middle East, the Ottomans {{attempted}} <b>to</b> <b>reassert</b> centralized {{control over the}} Arab vilayets. In 1657, they sent an expeditionary force led mostly by Arab sipahi officers from central Syria <b>to</b> <b>reassert</b> Ottoman authority in Nablus and its hinterland, {{as part of a}} broader attempt to established centralized rule throughout the empire at that time. In return for their services, the officers were granted agricultural lands around the villages of Jabal Nablus. The Ottomans, fearing that the new Arab land holders would establish independent bases of power, dispersed the land plots to separate and distant locations within Jabal Nablus to avoid creating contiguous territory controlled by individual clans. Contrary to its centralization purpose, the 1657 campaign allowed the Arab sipahi officers to establish their own increasingly autonomous foothold in Nablus. The officers raised their families there and intermarried with the local notables of the area, namely the ulama and merchant families. Without abandoning their nominal military service, they acquired diverse properties to consolidate their presence and income such as soap and pottery factories, bathhouses, agricultural lands, grain mills and, olive and sesame oil presses.|$|E
5|$|Following Khumarawayh's {{ascension}} {{to power}} in 884, the Abbasid central government decided <b>to</b> <b>reassert</b> its control over the provinces ruled by him and invaded northern Syria that year. By early 885 the conflict was proceeding favorably for the Abbasids, forcing Khumarawayh to personally take the field and try to stop their advance toward Egypt. In the battle that followed, the Abbasid troops initially defeated the Tulunids and plundered Khumarawayh's camp, but were then ambushed by a Tulunid reserve force and routed in turn.|$|E
5|$|Following its {{incorporation}} into the Ottoman Empire in 1517, Nablus was designated capital of the Jabal Nablus ("Mount Nablus") district. In 1657, {{after a series of}} upheavals, a number of Arab clans from the northern and eastern Levant were dispatched to the city <b>to</b> <b>reassert</b> Ottoman authority, and loyalty from among these clans staved off challenges to the empire's authority by rival regional leaders, like Zahir al-Umar in the 18th century, and Muhammad Ali—who briefly ruled Nablus—in the 19th century. When Ottoman rule was firmly reestablished in 1841, Nablus prospered as a center of trade.|$|E

In the light of recent criticism of the nurse-patient relationship in the Burdekin Report, it is perhaps timely to explore the basic commonality of {{what it is to be}} in illness and in wellness.

Laing, Man. in Heidegger and Jean-Paul Same with a view <b>to</b> <b>reasserting</b> the primacy of a Being to Eieing interaction in the therapeutic relationship...|$|R
50|$|In December 1774 HMS Canceaux {{attempted}} {{to restore order}} to Fort William and Mary following the seizure of supplies by colonial forces led by Paul Revere. The fort, located on New Castle Island near Portsmouth, New Hampshire, was seen as essential <b>to</b> <b>reasserting</b> control over the insurrection mounting amongst the populace. The concern caused by the colonial seizure of sixteen cannon and about one hundred barrels of gunpowder prompted the Canceaux to quickly depart Boston for Portsmouth. She arrived {{four days after the}} colonial forces had taken said resources from the fort. She was then grounded by the local maritime pilot and thus remained within an estuary of the Piscataqua River, stranded for many days.|$|R
50|$|The Qing {{government}} sent {{an imperial}} official {{to the region}} <b>to</b> begin <b>reasserting</b> Qing control soon after the British invasion of Tibet under Francis Younghusband in 1904, which alarmed the Manchu Qing rulers in China, but the locals revolted and killed him.|$|R
5|$|In 367BC, plebeians {{were allowed}} to stand for the consulship, and this implicitly opened both the {{censorship}} {{as well as the}} dictatorship to plebeians. Around this time, the practice of electing military tribunes with consular authority was dropped. In 366BC, in an effort by the patricians <b>to</b> <b>reassert</b> their influence over the magisterial offices, two new offices were created. These two offices, the praetorship and the curule aedileship (so-called because its holder, like consuls and praetors, had the right to sit in a curule seat), were at first open only to patricians, but within a generation they were open to plebeians as well.|$|E
5|$|Michael Scott (Steve Carell) {{initially}} makes {{light of}} the exposure incident. After being shamed by how offended the other employees are by his antics, he attempts <b>to</b> <b>reassert</b> his sensitivity to women by holding a seminar on women's issues. He closes the meeting by offering to take the women to the Mall at Steamtown. Before leaving, he receives a call from Jan Levinson (Melora Hardin), who asks {{to meet with him}} to have sex. Michael balks at the proposal, and only becomes more uncomfortable when she offers to pay him for the sex.|$|E
5|$|The Northumbrian hegemony over Northern Britain, won by Ecgfrith's predecessors, {{had begun}} to disintegrate. Several of Northumbria's subject nations had rebelled in recent years, leading {{to a number of}} {{large-scale}} battles against the Picts, Mercians, and Irish, with varied success. Following sieges on neighbouring territories carried out by the Picts, Ecgfrith led his forces against them, despite advice to the contrary, in an effort <b>to</b> <b>reassert</b> his suzerainty over the Pictish nations.|$|E
50|$|Evangelicals {{held the}} view that the modernist and liberal parties in the Protestant churches had {{surrendered}} their heritage as Evangelicals by accommodating the views and values of the world. At the same time, they criticized their fellow Fundamentalists for their separatism and their rejection of the Social Gospel as it had been developed by Protestant activists of the previous century. They charged the modernists with having lost their identity as Evangelicals and the Fundamentalists with having lost the Christ-like heart of Evangelicalism. They argued that the Gospel needed <b>to</b> be <b>reasserted</b> <b>to</b> distinguish it from the innovations of the liberals and the fundamentalists.|$|R
25|$|The {{period of}} {{relative}} autonomy ended in 1593. By then, all five invasions of Siam (1584–93) had ended in failure, and Nanda had finally {{given up on}} winning back Siam. He now turned his attention <b>to</b> <b>reasserting</b> his authority closer to home. Minye Thihathu had to pay attention because Toungoo was surrounded on three sides by the states ruled by Nanda and his sons (Ava in the north, Prome {{in the west and}} Pegu in the south). When Nanda asked him to lead an army to put down a Siam-backed rebellion in Moulmein (Mawlamyaing) in October 1594, he agreed. But his 8,000-man army was badly defeated outside Moulmein by the Siamese army. At Pegu, Minye Thihathu was severely reprimanded by Nanda, before being allowed to return to Toungoo.|$|R
50|$|In 1857, the Indian Mutiny {{broke out}} in South Asia and the 21st Native Infantry {{stationed}} in Karachi declared allegiance to rebels, joining their cause on 10 September 1857. Nevertheless, the British were able <b>to</b> quickly <b>reassert</b> control over Karachi and defeat the uprising. Karachi was known as Khurachee Scinde (i.e. Karachi, Sindh) during the early British colonial rule.|$|R
5|$|While {{none of the}} {{historical}} sources explicitly state Ecgfrith's reason for attacking Fortriu in 685, {{the consensus is that}} it was <b>to</b> <b>reassert</b> Northumbria's eroded hegemony over the Picts. The most thorough description of the battle is given by Bede in his 8th century work Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum (The Ecclesiastical History of the English People) (completed c731), but this is still brief. Additional detail is given in the Irish annals of Ulster and Tigernach, and by the early Welsh historian Nennius in his Historia Brittonum (written c. 830).|$|E
5|$|With the pre-War team dispersed, {{the club}} {{struggled}} <b>to</b> <b>reassert</b> its {{dominance in the}} late 1940s and eventually suffered relegation to the Second Division under Cliff Britton in the 195051 season. After finishing second in the 195354 season, the club returned to the top tier of English football, {{the level at which}} they have played ever since. In 1961, the club appointed Harry Catterick as manager who led the club to the league title again in both the 196263 and 196970 seasons, with the league successes punctuated by another FA Cup triumph, this time a 32 victory over Sheffield Wednesday at Wembley.|$|E
5|$|During 1864, {{these actions}} were {{successfully}} countered by armed retaliations by foreign powers, {{such as the}} British Bombardment of Kagoshima and the multinational Shimonoseki Campaign. At the same time, the forces of Chōshū, together with rōnin, raised the Hamaguri rebellion trying to seize the city of Kyoto, where the Emperor's court was held, but were repelled by Shogunate forces under the future Shogun Tokugawa Yoshinobu. The Shogunate further ordered a punitive expedition against Chōshū, the First Chōshū expedition, and obtained Chōshū's submission without actual fighting. At this point initial resistance among the leadership in Chōshū and the imperial court subsided, {{but over the next}} year the Tokugawa proved unable <b>to</b> <b>reassert</b> full control over the country as most daimyōs began to ignore orders and questions from Edo.|$|E
50|$|The central {{challenge}} to Silva and his battlefield engineers was {{to overcome the}} isolated plateau and its fortifications, originally constructed by King Herod. Silva surrounded the mountain fortress by constructing a 1.8 m, 11 km siege wall (circumvallation) to prevent attacks and escapes. The wall also enclosed the eight base camps established for the army. After initial efforts to breach Masada's defenses failed, Silva's army built a siege ramp against the western face of the plateau, using {{thousands of tons of}} stones and beaten earth. The huge dirt ramp, which survives to this day, allowed the Romans to roll up a battering ram to breach Masada's walls. Silva's victory was incomplete. His opponents, some 960 men, women and children, had committed mass suicide shortly before the Romans took the mountain top. However, the Romans succeeded in making their point clear and removed an obstacle <b>to</b> <b>reasserting</b> their rule in Judaea.|$|R
50|$|The ICP {{provided}} {{leadership to}} these associations. Bernal {{notes that the}} central committee was not in favour of this rapid dismantling of county administrations and the setting up of “soviets” because the “time for revolution was not yet ripe”. However, since these peasant associations were mushrooming in many places, the Central Committee soon changed its approach and advised local Communist members to covertly direct and support the peasant association leaders in the soviets to “maintain and strengthen {{the influence of the}} party”. However, these associations tended <b>to</b> <b>reasserted</b> traditional values, in general, and did not establish new ones. In the case of the redistribution of land, for example, the local party leadership attempted to enforce a relatively moderate policy: provincial party directives called for the seizure of previously communal lands, but not for the confiscation of all landlord lands. These “village peasant sections” or “soviets” survived in west Nghệ An until August 1931 and in Hà Tĩnh till the end of the year.|$|R
25|$|Tibetans {{claimed that}} Tibetan {{control of the}} Batang region of Kham in eastern Tibet appears to have {{continued}} uncontested {{from the time of}} an agreement made in 1726 until soon after the British invasion, which alarmed the Qing rulers in China. They sent the imperial official Fengquan (凤全) to the region <b>to</b> begin <b>reasserting</b> Qing control, but the locals revolted and killed him and two French Catholic priests and burned the church.|$|R
5|$|During the Seven Years' War (in America, {{known as}} the French and Indian War), British forces seized Canada from the French, but the francophone {{population}} remained politically isolated from the southern colonies. Excluding the Native Americans, who were being conquered and displaced, the 13 British colonies had a population of over 2.1 million in 1770, about one-third that of Britain. Despite continuing new arrivals, the {{rate of natural increase}} was such that by the 1770s only a small minority of Americans had been born overseas. The colonies' distance from Britain had allowed the development of self-government, but their success motivated monarchs to periodically seek <b>to</b> <b>reassert</b> royal authority.|$|E
5|$|Governors {{first began}} to assert their own power during the American Civil War as the General Assembly {{attempted}} to remove command of the militia from the governor. In response, the General Assembly was effectively suppressed, during which time the governor assumed many powers to appoint public officials, hire and remove state employees, and manage state finances. When the General Assembly reconvened with a majority sympathetic to the governor, he was permitted to continue many of his assumed powers. In 1889, the General Assembly began <b>to</b> <b>reassert</b> its authority over hiring state employees. The issued ended when the Supreme Court {{ruled in favor of}} the legislature, again returning to it final authority over hiring state employees. The legislature passed acts in 1895 that removed the last of the governor's authority to appoint anyone to executive positions.|$|E
5|$|Henry now {{appeared}} to his contemporaries {{to be stronger}} than ever, and he was courted as an ally by many European leaders and asked to arbitrate over international disputes in Spain and Germany. He was nonetheless busy resolving some of the weaknesses that he believed had exacerbated the revolt. Henry set about extending royal justice in England <b>to</b> <b>reassert</b> his authority and spent time in Normandy shoring up support amongst the barons. The King also made use of the growing Becket cult to increase his own prestige, using {{the power of the}} saint to explain his victory in 1174, especially his success in capturing William.|$|E
40|$|As is well-known, {{there is}} a tension {{at the heart of}} {{international}} law in relation to the detention of non-nationals. On the one hand, human rights law seems to provide a framework in which the protection of ‘human dignity’ is paramount and rights are accorded every human being qua human being. On the other hand, the law has permitted serious inroads into the notions of absolute freedom and equality through such concepts as reasonableness, proportionality and legitimacy. Westphalian sovereignty continues to wield significant power in the migration context, with few institutions willing or able to threaten its domain. Taking as a case-study the detention of asylum seekers in the UK, this paper will explore whether {{there is a}}ny evidence that members of the judiciary may now be prepared to challenge the traditional interpretation of detention - either through human rights or common law presumptions - with a view <b>to</b> <b>reasserting</b> the moral imperative of freedom over the state’s desire to control inward migration, or whether a re-evaluation of the practice of detention of non-nationals is impossible within the current state-centric, pro-citizen, and security-conscious environment in which we live...|$|R
50|$|By 60 BC, Celtic {{political}} hegemony in {{the region}} appears to have collapsed, and the indigenous Dacian tribes throughout the region appear <b>to</b> have <b>reasserted</b> their identity and political independence. This process may have been {{partly due to the}} career of the Getan king Burebista (ruled ca 80 - 44 BC), who appears to have coalesced several Getic and Dacian tribes under his leadership. It is likely that in this period, the Dacian language regained its former predominance in Transylvania.|$|R
25|$|By {{the early}} nineteenth century, however, Aceh had become an {{increasingly}} influential power due to its strategic location for controlling regional trade. In the 1820s it was the producer of over half the world's supply of black pepper. The pepper trade produced new wealth for the Sultanate and for the rulers of many smaller nearby ports that had been under Aceh's control, but were now able to assert more independence. These changes initially threatened Aceh's integrity, but a new sultan Tuanku Ibrahim, who controlled the kingdom from 1838 <b>to</b> 1870, <b>reasserted</b> power over nearby ports.|$|R
5|$|In 1906, Cuba was in {{the midst}} of a {{constitutional}} crisis as a result of a disputed election and an attempt by elected President Tomás Estrada Palma to stay in power after the conclusion of his term. This led to a revolt, and the U.S. military sent in 5,600 men <b>to</b> <b>reassert</b> control over the country in what would be called the Second Occupation of Cuba. This was permitted under the Cuban-American Treaty of Relations of 1903, a treaty that stipulated the degree of United States intervention in Cuba. After a brief period of stabilization by Secretary Taft, Magoon was appointed governor under the Constitution of Cuba, effectively with absolute authority and backed by the U.S. military.|$|E
5|$|In 449 BC, the Senate promulgated the Twelve Tables as the {{centerpiece}} of the Roman Constitution. In 443 BC, the office of Censor was created, and in 367 BC, Plebeians were allowed to stand for the Consulship. The opening of the Consulship to the Plebeian class implicitly opened both the Censorship as well as the Dictatorship to Plebeians. In 366 BC, in an effort by the Patricians <b>to</b> <b>reassert</b> their influence over the magisterial offices, two new offices were created. While these two offices, the Praetorship and the Curule Aedileship, were at first open only to Patricians, within a generation, they were open to Plebeians as well.|$|E
5|$|In January 1905, the {{massacre}} of protesters {{that came to be}} known as Bloody Sunday took place in St. Petersburg, sparking the civil unrest known as the Revolution of 1905. In response to these events, Lenin urged Bolsheviks in the Empire to take a greater role in the unrest, encouraging violent insurrection against the Tsarist establishment, including police and the Black Hundreds. He also insisted that the Bolsheviks split completely with the Mensheviks, although many Bolsheviks, among them close colleagues like Gusev and Zemlyachka, disagreed with him. Thus, both groups were invited to the 3rd RSDLP Congress, held in London in April 1905; nevertheless, few Mensheviks attended, and Lenin used the Congress <b>to</b> <b>reassert</b> his dominance within the party. He also oversaw the formation of a new Bolshevik newspaper, Proletari (The Worker).|$|E
50|$|When Stringer asserts his {{opposition}} to Avon's war against the Stanfield Crew, Avon accuses him of lacking the masculinity necessary for their business—and based {{on the lack of}} progress on his condominiums, also accuses him of not being smart enough for the legitimate business world. This causes Stringer <b>to</b> angrily <b>reassert</b> his masculinity by revealing that he had ordered D'Angelo's death. Stringer tells Avon that he chose to have D'Angelo killed because Avon himself would be unable to order the death of his own nephew, even if he knew that D'Angelo would eventually flip.|$|R

5|$|In {{subsequent}} years Perfini released {{a number of}} commercially oriented films, such as Delapan Pendjuru Angin (Eight Compass Directions, 1957) and Asrama Dara (Dormitory for Girls, 1958). Though none of these were commercial failures, none except for Asrama Dara approached the financial success of Tiga Dara. Ismail attempted <b>to</b> <b>reassert</b> himself as a director of quality not-for-profit films through Pedjuang (Warriors for Freedom, 1960), which was screened in competition at the 2nd Moscow International Film Festival in 1961. However, {{as the years passed}} he became increasingly distanced from his early goals and had made attempts to enter banking, the nightclub industry, and parliament by {{the time of his death}} in 1971.|$|E
5|$|Mercia was the {{dominant}} kingdom in southern England {{in the eighth}} century, and maintained its position until it suffered a decisive defeat by King Egbert of Wessex at the Battle of Ellandun in 825. Egbert briefly conquered Mercia, but it recovered its independence in 830, and thereafter the two kingdoms became allies, {{which was to be}} an important factor in English resistance to the Vikings. The Mercians traditionally held overlordship over Wales, and in 853 King Burgred of Mercia obtained the assistance of King Æthelwulf of Wessex in an invasion of Wales in order <b>to</b> <b>reassert</b> their hegemony. The same year, Burgred married Æthelwulf's daughter.|$|E
5|$|Normandy {{faced an}} {{increased}} threat from France, Anjou and Flanders after 1108. Louis VI succeeded to the French throne in 1108 and began <b>to</b> <b>reassert</b> central royal power. Louis demanded Henry give homage {{to him and}} that two disputed castles along the Normandy border be placed into the control of neutral castellans. Henry refused, and Louis responded by mobilising an army. After some arguments, the two kings negotiated a truce and retreated without fighting, leaving the underlying issues unresolved. Fulk V assumed power in Anjou in 1109 and began to rebuild Angevin authority. Fulk also inherited the county of Maine, but refused to recognise Henry as his feudal lord and instead allied himself with Louis. Robert II of Flanders also briefly joined the alliance, {{before his death in}} 1111.|$|E
50|$|Growing more {{suspicious}} of the subjective theological liberalism of the day, he published A Christian Manifesto in 1934.
