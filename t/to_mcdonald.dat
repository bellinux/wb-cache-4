5|$|The All Blacks played Glamorgan in Swansea on 21 December. The All Blacks had the {{advantage}} of the wind in the first 30 minutes. Late in the first half Roberts worked a move from a scrum to pass to Smith, who passed to Harold Abbott. Abbott then passed back to Smith who scored in the corner. In the second half Glamorgan attacked but could not score, and late in the game the All Blacks scored tries <b>to</b> <b>McDonald</b> and Wallace to win 9–0.|$|E

25|$|McDonald's {{influence}} weakened Reuther's {{attempts to}} win strong guarantees on civil rights, union corruption, and industrial unionism in the unity talks.

Reuther, unable to stand up <b>to</b> <b>McDonald</b> any longer, settled for a paper statements against corruption and racial discrimination. There were no mechanisms to enforce the lofty goals, and many AFL unions continued to segregate blacks and engage in racist practices.|$|E

Riffe, a veteran organizer with several CIO unions, {{to be appointed}} in Haywood's stead. Reuther acquiesced. McDonald then pushed Riffe, who was in ill health, to promote McDonald's views within the CIO. McDonald also won a CIO staff position for his longtime personal assistant, Oral Garrison, who also pressured Riffe and reported on CIO affairs <b>to</b> <b>McDonald.</b>|$|E
25|$|Dwyer {{played his}} three matches for NSW {{sporadically}} {{between the end}} of the First World War and the year of the Wall Street Crash. His first match took place of 26 December 1918 against Victoria at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. Winning the toss, NSW inserted Victoria in to bat, and dismissed them for 266, largely composed of a century by Frederick Baring. Dwyer, at number two, formed an opening partnership of 26 with Australian international Warren Bardsley before the latter fell lbw to Baring for 18 and Dwyer was dismissed by international Edgar McDonald. NSW fell to 123 all out, and were unable to stop Victoria from reaching 299 all out in their second innings, thanks to a century by Edgar Mayne. NSW notched up 226 in reply, Dwyer falling again <b>to</b> <b>McDonald</b> for nine.|$|E
25|$|After a {{very public}} row, it was finally decided in Australia that the AIF would play three of the state teams: Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland. The team arrived home in December and were at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) 16 to 19 January for the first match against Victoria which they won by six wickets. Collins won the toss against his future Test captain Warwick Armstrong and put Victoria in. Gregory took seven for 22 and bowled them out for only 116. The AIF batsmen {{had to contend with}} Ted McDonald, Gregory's future Test bowling partner, and he took a modest three for 76 as Willis scored 111 in a total of 311. At close of play on the second day, Victoria had reached 31 for one. They totalled 270 all out with Lampard taking seven for 99. The AIF needed 76 to win and made hard work of it, losing four wickets <b>to</b> <b>McDonald</b> and Armstrong before Gregory saw them home.|$|E

500|$|During {{the onset}} of the American Revolution, McDonald was an ardent Whig. In March 1777, McDonald {{received}} a personal letter from General George Washington appointing him a lieutenant colonel in a battalion of Thruston's Additional Continental Regiment under the command of Colonel Charles Mynn Thruston, a former rector of Cunningham Chapel in present-day Clarke County, Virginia, and a former associate magistrate of the Frederick County court, where he served alongside McDonald. Despite his loyalty to the American Revolutionary cause, McDonald refused the appointment for either of two reasons: he would have been second-in-command to a colonel lacking prior military experience and McDonald had previously {{been a member of the}} vestry of Cunningham Chapel and resigned following a dispute with Thruston over [...] "a matter of business with the church". General Adam Stephen, a fellow Scotsman, wrote a letter <b>to</b> <b>McDonald</b> dated March 15, 1777, in which he implored him to accept Washington's appointment, stating [...] "Your appointment comes entirely from your own merit." [...] Stephen warned McDonald not to let his [...] "Highland pride" [...] dissuade him from serving under Thruston and in the event McDonald still refused Washington's offer, Stephen wrote: [...] "Write a polite letter to General Washington thanking his excellency for his notice and making the best excuse you can." ...|$|E
500|$|Following the ambush, McDonald and {{his forces}} reached the Muskingum River around nightfall on August 2, 1774. McDonald and his forces {{arrived at the}} [...] "chief Wakatomika town" [...] only to {{discover}} that it had been evacuated by its Shawnee inhabitants, who were found nearby preparing to ambush McDonald's forces. The Shawnee in ambuscade surrendered <b>to</b> <b>McDonald</b> in exchange for peace. McDonald's forces continued their march onto the next Wakatomika settlement, where a further ambush ensued resulting in the burning of Shawnee cabins and villages. The ambush also resulted in the destruction of Shawnee plantations and maize fields. McDonald and his forces took three Shawnee scalps and one prisoner. McDonald and his forces returned to Wheeling with three Shawnee tribal chiefs as captives, who were then sent on to the colonial Virginia seat of government, Williamsburg. McDonald completed the expedition, which met its goal of temporarily relieving western Virginia frontier settlements from Native American attack. He continued to serve under Lord Dunmore {{until the end of the}} war. In a letter dated January 8, 1775, following his return to Winchester from Williamsburg, McDonald recounted of the war, [...] "all the Country is well pleased with the Governours Expeditions." [...] Following Dunmore's War in December 1774, McDonald was further promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel.|$|E

500|$|ED Denson, the {{co-publisher}} of Rag Baby, introduced McDonald to Chris Strachwitz, {{who owned}} Arhoolie Recording Studios, to self-produce the EP. Sensing the band's potential, Denson assumed management control, and {{was responsible for}} coining the group's name—a reference to Josef Stalin and to Mao Zedong's description of revolutionaries as [...] "the fish who swim {{in the sea of}} the people". McDonald, who had recording experience, began utilizing Arhoolie Recording Studios to record four songs split equally between the band and a local folk musician, Peter Krug. It was during this time at Arhoolie Records that Country Joe and the Fish's folk sound and political protest prowess—an amalgam of their own Guthrie-influenced material and their folk music roots—began to emerge. The band's side of the EP featured two originals by McDonald, an acoustic version of [...] "I Feel Like I'm Fixin' to Die Rag" [...] (also known as [...] "The Fish Cheer"), and [...] "Superbird". According <b>to</b> <b>McDonald,</b> [...] "The Fish Cheer" [...] was written in 30 minutes, with a purpose of expressing satiric and dark commentary on the US's involvement in the Vietnam conflict. In October 1965, 100 copies of the EP, titled Rag Baby Talking Issue No. 1, were distributed on McDonald's independent label at a Teach-in in UC Berkeley and underground shops selling Rag Baby magazine.|$|E
500|$|At 36 {{years old}} and {{approaching}} {{the end of his}} career, the 1989 Stanley Cup playoffs was potentially his last chance at winning the Stanley Cup. The Flames defeated the Vancouver Canucks, Los Angeles Kings and Chicago Blackhawks to set up a Stanley Cup Final rematch of the 1986 Final with the Montreal Canadiens. McDonald was left out of the Flames' lineup for the third, fourth and fifth games, but with Calgary leading the series three wins to two, head coach Terry Crisp felt that if the Flames were to win the championship, McDonald deserved to be in the game. [...] Crisp's decision paid dividends, as midway through the sixth game, McDonald stepped onto the ice after serving a penalty to join Håkan Loob and Joe Nieuwendyk in a three-on-one rush toward the Montreal goal. [...] Loob passed the puck up to Nieuwendyk, who saw a streaking McDonald coming up {{the right side of the}} ice. [...] McDonald received the pass then shot the puck over Montreal goaltender Patrick Roy's glove to give the Flames a 2–1 lead. Doug Gilmour added two goals, and Calgary won the game 4–2 to earn the franchise's first Stanley Cup championship. League president John Ziegler presented the trophy <b>to</b> <b>McDonald,</b> co-captain Jim Peplinski and alternate Tim Hunter.

In late 2005, University of Western Australia Press published Glenys McDonald's book, Seeking the Sydney: A Quest for the Truth. McDonald had conducted extensive interviews with residents of the coastal area nearest the battle, much of which had been tabled at the 2001 SPC seminar. According <b>to</b> <b>McDonald,</b> many residents of Port Gregory, about [...] north of Geraldton, reported {{the sights and sounds of}} a naval battle at about the time that Sydney and Kormoran engaged.

2500|$|Prior to the {{outbreak}} of the American Civil War, McDonald sympathized with the secessionist cause, but his feelings softened during his trip abroad, where he found a [...] "united republic" [...] preferable to a cluster of sovereign states like Europe. Upon his return, McDonald renewed his secessionist sentiments and following Virginia's secession from the United States in April 1861, he traveled to Harpers Ferry to volunteer his services to the Confederate States Army. General Kenton Harper assigned McDonald to the duty of guarding the bridges and fords crossing the Potomac River downstream of Harpers Ferry. A company that included Captain Turner Ashby was assigned <b>to</b> <b>McDonald,</b> who divided it into small detachments that were sent out on scouting expeditions as far south as Washington City. Following the scouting expeditions, McDonald realized the need for a topographic corps and after selecting suitable men for this service, he organized the first topographic corps in Virginia. McDonald was commissioned as a captain of cavalry.|$|E
2500|$|According <b>to</b> <b>McDonald,</b> a {{star system}} emerged in Hollywood as talent scouts, coaches, and publicists were {{involved}} with finding performers and making them into stars. In the vertically integrated Hollywood film industry of the 1920s, 1930s, and 1940s, these responsibilities were all undertaken by the studios themselves. The studios made the stars and, due to notoriously restrictive terms imposed by exclusive services contracts, the studios also owned the stars (McDonald, 2000). As is common in commercial cinema, the industry's heart is a highly developed star system. [...] In earlier days, beloved performers from the Chinese opera stage often brought their audiences {{with them to the}} screen. [...] For the past three or four decades, television has been a major launching pad for movie stardom, through acting courses and widely watched drama, comedy and variety series offered by the two major stations. [...] Possibly even more important is the overlap with the Cantonese pop music industry. [...] Many, if not most, movie stars have recording sidelines, and vice versa; this has been a key marketing strategy in an entertainment industry where American-style, multimedia advertising campaigns have until recently been little used (Bordwell, 2000). [...] In the current commercially troubled climate, the casting of young Cantopop idols (such as Ekin Cheng and the Twins) to attract the all-important youth audience is endemic.|$|E
2500|$|Under {{contract}} to release another album in 1976, the Doobies {{were at a}} crossroads. Their primary songwriter and singer remained unavailable, so they turned <b>to</b> <b>McDonald</b> and Porter for material to supplement that of Simmons. The resulting LP, Takin' it to the Streets, debuted a radical change in their sound. Their electric-guitar-based rock and roll {{gave way to a}} more soft rock and blue-eyed soul sound, emphasizing keyboards and horns and subtler, more syncopated rhythms. Baxter contributed jazz-inflected guitar stylings reminiscent of Steely Dan (as he had played with that group), along with more emphasis on compound chords and unusual, complex chords and sophisticated progressions with key changes and longer, more developed melody lines. Above all, McDonald's voice became the band's new signature sound. Takin' It to the Streets featured McDonald's title track and [...] "It Keeps You Runnin'," [...] both hits. (A second version of [...] "It Keeps You Runnin'", performed by Carly Simon, appeared on her album Another Passenger, with the Doobies backing her.) Bassist Porter wrote and sang [...] "For Someone Special" [...] as a tribute to the absent Johnston. A greatest hits compilation, Best of the Doobies, followed before year's end. (In 1996, the Recording Industry Association of America certified Best of the Doobies [...] "Diamond" [...] for sales in excess of 10 million units.) ...|$|E
