5|$|Just as predators such as {{angler fish}} have a {{structure}} that lures prey, so some parasites mimic their host's natural prey, but with roles reversed; the parasite gets eaten by the host. This deception provides the parasite easy entry into the host, which <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>then</b> feed upon, allowing them to continue their life cycle. Researchers {{may be able to}} predict the host of such parasites based on their appearance and behavior.|$|E
5|$|Guitar Hero 5 allows {{players to}} start in a Band Lobby from where <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>then</b> launch {{into any of the}} game's modes, add other local and remote players to a party, and switch between the game modes without having to leave the party or lobby, a {{significant}} change in response to the difficulties players found in World Tour. The game supports a Career mode (described below), a Quickplay mode, where players can create a set list of numerous songs and play through them. All songs on disc and through downloadable content are immediately available to play in this mode. The game also carries over the competitive modes from previous Guitar Hero games.|$|E

5|$|The leader Uruk {{will have}} a range of {{strengths}} and weaknesses, the latter that can be exploited in combat to quickly weaken and defeat the leader. The player can gain knowledge of these through finding intelligence mostly by draining and interrogating marked Uruks for this. Being able to exploit such weaknesses in defeating the leader will gain a better quality rune and more experience points in this manner. Once the player gains the ability to brand Uruks, they can brand these leaders and convert portions of Sauron's army to their side. At this point, the player can use the Nemesis system to trigger infighting within the Uruk forces which <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>then</b> directly participate in, helping to weaken the army further. Uruks that survive their encounter with Talion will remember this when Talion combats them again; for example, an Uruk who was thrown into a fire by Talion might want revenge on him for being disfigured.|$|E
5|$|The {{story begins}} in a {{different}} place for each playable character. With the exception of Carlie, the main character is soon told (or otherwise decides) to seek the advice of the Priest of Light in the Holy City Wendel. They arrive at the city of Jadd soon after the Beastmen have invaded. Due to the Beastmen's werewolf powers, they are able to make an escape by night. The main character—now including Carlie—on the way to Wendel stays overnight in Astoria where they are woken by a bright light. Following it, it reveals itself to be a Faerie from the Mana Sanctuary, exhausted by her journey. Out of desperation, the Faerie chooses the main character to be her host, and tells them to get to Wendel. There, while they explain their grievances to the Priest of Light, the Faerie interrupts and explains that the Mana Tree is dying and that the Sanctuary is in danger. The Priest explains that if the Tree dies, the God Beasts will reawaken and destroy the world. He goes on to explain further that, because the Faerie has chosen the main character as its host, they must travel to the Sanctuary to draw the Sword of Mana from the foot of the Mana Tree. <b>They</b> <b>can</b> <b>then</b> restore peace to the world, and have their wishes granted by the Mana Goddess if the sword is drawn before the Tree dies. A great deal of power is needed to open the gate to the Sanctuary. The Faerie does not have the strength to do it, and the ancient spell which would do so by unlocking the power in the Mana Stones also takes the caster's life. The Stones' guarding elemental spirits, however, will to be able to open the gate if their powers are combined.|$|E

25|$|Adults are {{particularly}} fond of nectar-rich flowers {{with a long}} and narrow calyx, since <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>then</b> {{take advantage of their}} long proboscis and avoid competition from other insects. Examples of such plants include Centranthus, Jasminum, Buddleia, Nicotiana, Primula, Viola, Syringa, Verbena, Echium, Phlox, and Stachys. They are reported to trap-line, that is, to return to the same flower beds {{at about the same time}} each day.|$|E
25|$|Rearing is {{also another}} method {{that can bring}} the most rewards. This {{can be done with}} wild host eggs or laboratory-prepared host eggs that are exposed in {{suitable}} habitats outside. <b>They</b> <b>can</b> <b>then</b> be taken in after a sufficient amount of time has passed and examined for developing fairyflies. With this method, it is possible to observe the life history and determine the hosts of particular species of discovered fairyflies.|$|E

50|$|In the {{supersymmetry}} {{theory of}} particle physics, ordinary quarks and leptons have scalar partners that carry baryon and lepton numbers. As the latter decay into fermions {{during the early}} Universe, the net baryon number that <b>they</b> carry <b>can</b> <b>then</b> form the currently observed excess of ordinary baryons. This occurs due to interactions of the scalars with the inflaton field, resulting in CP violations.|$|R
50|$|Flames of Judgment is a turn-based, {{tactical}} role-playing game, where players engage their band {{of warriors}} in turn-based combat on a three-dimensional isometric grid against an opposing force. Each character performs an action each turn where <b>they</b> <b>can</b> move, <b>then</b> use a weapon, item or magical ability. Every action increases the character's skill, slowly leveling up overall as the player progresses {{through the main}} story.|$|R

25|$|In the hepatic 17-ketosteroid pathway of {{testosterone}} metabolism, testosterone is converted {{in the liver}} by 5α-reductase and 5β-reductase into 5α-DHT and the inactive 5β-DHT, respectively. Then, 5α-DHT and 5β-DHT are converted by 3α-HSD into 3α,5α-androstanediol and 3α,5β-androstanediol, respectively. Subsequently, 3α,5α-androstanediol and 3α,5β-androstanediol are converted by 17β-HSD into androsterone and etiocholanolone, which is followed by their conjugation and excretion. 3β,5α-Androstanediol and 3β,5β-androstanediol can also be formed in this pathway when 5α-DHT and 5β-DHT are acted upon by 3β-HSD instead of 3α-HSD, respectively, and <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>then</b> be transformed into epiandrosterone and epietiocholanolone, respectively. A small portion of approximately 3% {{of testosterone}} is reversibly converted in the liver into androstenedione by 17β-HSD.|$|E
25|$|Cradle-to-gate is an {{assessment}} of a partial product life cycle from resource extraction (cradle) to the factory gate (i.e., before it is transported to the consumer). The use phase and disposal phase of the product are omitted in this case. Cradle-to-gate assessments are sometimes the basis for environmental product declarations (EPD) termed business-to-business EDPs. One of the significant uses of the cradle-to-gate approach compiles the life cycle inventory (LCI) using cradle-to-gate. This allows the LCA to collect all of the impacts leading up to resources being purchased by the facility. <b>They</b> <b>can</b> <b>then</b> add the steps involved in their transport to plant and manufacture process to more easily produce their own cradle-to-gate values for their products.|$|E
25|$|Destiny {{features}} three character classes. Each {{class has}} their own specific upgrades, perks, special abilities, and two sub-classes that allow the player to finely tune their individual characters to provide a different play style. After choosing a class, players select one of three species for their character: Human, Awoken (bluish-gray-skinned descendants of Humans), or Exo (humanoid machines). <b>They</b> <b>can</b> <b>then</b> customize their character, such as changing its gender or skin color. A character's species is only cosmetic and does not affect gameplay. Players can create two more characters to have a character of each class. The Taken King added a third sub-class for each class, but requires {{the purchase of the}} DLC to access the new sub-classes.|$|E
50|$|An aging American millionairess {{journeys}} to Rome {{each year}} with her chauffeur George {{to play the}} card game scopone with destitute Peppino and his wife Antonia.

Eventually their daughter Cleopatra seeks revenge on her parents' behalf.|$|R
25|$|Sample {{metadata}} {{is linked}} to relevant experimental data across many archival databases relieving submitter burden by enabling one-time submission of sample description. <b>They</b> <b>then</b> <b>can</b> reference that sample, when necessary, when making data deposits to other archives.|$|R
50|$|The USAF and RAAF {{organize}} a strike force to reclaim major attacked {{points in the}} two countries {{with the assistance of the}} best mech operators <b>they</b> <b>can</b> find.

25|$|The {{player can}} also {{gain control of}} {{warehouses}} and hubs. Warehouses supply rackets, and hubs supply warehouses. Both warehouses and hubs are heavily guarded, and the player must fight their way inside, and find the boss, who <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>then</b> intimidate as with business owners and racket bosses. Warehouses pay out more than rackets and hubs pay out more than warehouses. Ultimately, the player must tackle the enemies' strongest holdout - their compound. Once the compound is destroyed, that family has been defeated. To destroy a compound, the player must fight their way inside and then plant a bomb. All compounds have two buildings, both of which must be bombed. Each compound is heavily guarded by opposing family members.|$|E
25|$|Along {{with the}} many {{additions}} that X & Y brought, various improvements to the communication features took place. Using the Player Search System (PSS), players can encounter various online players, including strangers, allowing them to easily initiate battles or trades through consent. The Holo Caster allows the player to receive messages and updates from NPCs via StreetPass and SpotPass. Wonder Trade is a new trading feature that lets players make blind trades with anyone in the world. Other features include O-Powers, temporary powers that can increase stats and can be exchanged with other players, and improvements to the Global Trade System, allowing players to request Pokémon they have not encountered. At certain points in the game, players {{will be able to}} take in-game screenshots, which <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>then</b> share on the Pokémon Global Link site.|$|E
25|$|Ingested {{proteins}} {{are usually}} broken up into single amino acids or dipeptides {{in the small}} intestine, and then absorbed. <b>They</b> <b>can</b> <b>then</b> be joined to make new proteins. Intermediate products of glycolysis, the citric acid cycle, and the pentose phosphate pathway {{can be used to}} make all twenty amino acids, and most bacteria and plants possess all the necessary enzymes to synthesize them. Humans and other mammals, however, can synthesize only half of them. They cannot synthesize isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, and valine. These are the essential amino acids, since it is essential to ingest them. Mammals do possess the enzymes to synthesize alanine, asparagine, aspartate, cysteine, glutamate, glutamine, glycine, proline, serine, and tyrosine, the nonessential amino acids. While they can synthesize arginine and histidine, they cannot produce it in sufficient amounts for young, growing animals, and so these are often considered essential amino acids.|$|E
