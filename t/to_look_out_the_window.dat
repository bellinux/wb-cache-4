25|$|Imagine {{for example}} using a {{stopwatch}} to mark-off tiny increments {{of time as}} a car travels down a highway. Imagine also looking at the car's speedometer as it travels, so that at every moment you know the velocity of the car. To understand {{the power of this}} theorem, imagine also that you are not allowed <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> of the car, so that you have no direct evidence of how far the car has traveled.|$|E
500|$|The {{office and}} {{warehouse}} of the Scranton branch office were sets {{on the production}} company's office in Van Nuys, California, although a real office {{was used in the}} show's first season. For episodes in season two and beyond, scenes set in the parking lot made use of the exterior of the production company's office building. Since the stage set had no windows, writer Jennifer Celotta's office was dressed to look like Michael Scott's when the script called for him or someone else <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> into the parking lot. [...] In the second and subsequent seasons, the office interiors and exteriors are at a different location in Van Nuys.|$|E
6000|$|... "But now I {{begin to}} be tired of writing. I should have been tired a great while ago, only I have stopped to rest pretty often, and <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>window,</b> and see what is going by on the canal.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{time before}} {{you come to}} the place you would reconnoitre, make a stand, and send one or two men in whom you can confide, <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> best ground for making your observations.|$|R
5000|$|The Golden Submarine {{was built}} from {{aluminum}} with holes for <b>the</b> driver <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>out.</b> <b>The</b> gold color was achieved {{with a combination}} of bronze dust and lacquer. [...] The car cost $US 15,000 to build.|$|R
5000|$|I&J Children's Play Centre - Various {{activities}} {{to keep the}} young visitors entertained. Puppet shows, arts and craft. A place for visitors <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> old seal pool and maybe even see the rockhopper penguins swimming.|$|R
6000|$|... "After I'd {{smoked a}} few, {{and listened to}} the sartorial {{breathing}} of H. O., I happened <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> toward the shearing-pens, where {{there was a kind of}} a road coming up from a kind of a road across a kind of a creek farther away.|$|E
60|$|This was not long, however; Marco soon {{grew tired}} of it, and then began <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>window.</b> There was a little staple in the window sill, placed there {{as a means of}} {{fastening}} the blind. Marco pushed the point of his pencil into this staple, in order to see if it would go through. It did go through in an instant, and slipping through his fingers, it fell out of the window.|$|E
60|$|He {{occupied}} one window, and I the other; and I {{saw that}} if one stayed there long, his principal business would be <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>window.</b> I had soon read all the tracts that were left there, and examined where former prisoners had broken out, and where a grate had been sawed off, and heard {{the history of the}} various occupants of that room; for I found that even here there was a history and a gossip which never circulated beyond the walls of the jail. Probably this is the only house in the town where verses are composed, which are afterward printed in a circular form, but not published. I was shown quite a long list of verses which were composed by some young men who had been detected in an attempt to escape, who avenged themselves by singing them.|$|E
6000|$|... "Be so good as <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> trains for me," [...] Wingrave continued. [...] "I cannot {{go until}} the afternoon," [...] he added after a {{momentary}} pause. [...] "I have an engagement for luncheon. Perhaps, {{if you are}} not too busy, you will see that Morrison packs some things for me." ...|$|R
60|$|After obtaining all the {{information}} he could from this man and from the other passengers, <b>the</b> captain steamed <b>out</b> to sea in a westerly direction, keeping a man at <b>the</b> mast-head <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>out.</b> <b>The</b> captives were in the meanwhile made as comfortable as circumstances would admit of, and the ten pirates were put in irons in the hold.|$|R

60|$|Marco was {{but little}} {{accustomed}} to solitary study, and, after performing {{one of the}} examples which Forester had given him, {{he thought he was}} tired, and he began <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> and to play with his pencil. He would lay his pencil upon the upper side of his slate, and let it roll down. As the pencil was not round, but polygonal in its form, it made a curious clicking sound in rolling down, which amused Marco, though it disturbed and troubled Forester. Whatever may have been the nice peculiarities in the delicate mechanism of Forester's ear, and of the nerves connected with it, compared with that of Marco's, by which the same sound produced a sensation of pleasure in one ear, while it gave only pain in the other, it would require a very profound philosopher to explain. But the effect was certain. Forester, however, did not speak, but let Marco roll his pencil down the slate as long as he pleased.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. George {{got into}} the coach, and Rollo {{followed}} him. As they drove along the streets, Rollo tried <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> and see; but the window was so small, and the streets were so narrow, and the coachman, moreover, drove so fast, that he had very little opportunity to make observations. At length he caught a momentary glimpse of a monstrous column {{standing in the middle}} of an open square; and immediately afterward the carriage drove in under an archway, and came to a stand, in a small, open court, surrounded with lofty buildings. This was the hotel. There was a small room, which served as a porter's lodge, in this court, near where the coach stopped. A girl came to the door of this lodge to receive the guests. She bowed to Mr. George and Rollo with great politeness, and seemed glad to see them. Mr. George spoke to her in French, to say what rooms he wished to engage. What he said, literally translated, was this:-- ...|$|E
50|$|With her {{suitcases}} packed, Maud {{leaves the}} house. Ã‰mile also leaves, and briefly encounters an ex-prisoner on the street. (This {{is the same}} person who {{was sitting next to}} Louis at the film's outset.) Louis is thrilled <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> door at the departing Maud, but does not see the ex-prisoner, who makes a nod of understanding to himself.|$|R
50|$|The park offers {{good and}} {{accessible}} viewpoints <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>out</b> over <b>the</b> North Kent Marshes beside the River Medway.|$|R
50|$|The {{community}} was so {{named for the}} fact Indians used the elevated town site <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>out</b> over <b>the</b> surrounding area.|$|R
60|$|The next morning, Rollo awoke early, and he {{was very}} much pleased to see, as soon as he opened his eyes, that the sun was shining in at the windows. He was not only pleased to find that the {{prospect}} was so good for a pleasant ride, but his vanity was gratified at the thought that it had turned out that he knew better about the weather than his father. He began to dress himself, {{as far as he could}} without help, and was preparing to hasten down to his father, to tell him that it was going to be a pleasant day. When he was nearly dressed, he was surprised lo observe that the bright sunlight on the wall was gradually fading away, and at length it wholly disappeared. He went <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> to see what was the cause. He found that there was a broad expanse of dark cloud covering the eastern sky, excepting a narrow strip quite low down, near the horizon. When the sun first rose, it shone brightly through this narrow zone of clear sky; but now it had ascended a little higher, and gone behind the cloud.|$|E
50|$|Miss Beanpole, a {{neighbour}} {{who likes}} <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> and locks {{herself in her}} own apartment. Miss Beanpole is not her real name; TJ cannot remember it.|$|E
50|$|With {{turnaround}} accomplished, the Air Force jet {{pilot for}} the first time became a space pilot, assuming manual-proportional control. A constant urge <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> made concentrating on his control tasks difficult. He told Shepard back in Mercury Control that the panorama of Earth's horizon, presenting an 800 mi (1 300 km) arc at peak altitude, was fascinating. His instruments rated a poor second to the spectacle below.|$|E
6000|$|They {{continued}} <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>out</b> from <b>the</b> window, {{from which}} they had now removed the bars. Half an hour later, Dick exclaimed: ...|$|R
60|$|The day came. I had not slept {{during the}} night that preceded it; so I rose early <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>out</b> on <b>the</b> morning.|$|R

50|$|Inara built a {{house on}} a cliff {{and gave it to}} Hupasiyas. She left one day with {{instructions}} that he was not <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>window,</b> as he might see his family. But he looked and the sight of his family made him beg to be allowed to return home. It is not known what happened next, but there is speculation that Inara killed Hupasiyas for disobeying her, or for hubris, or that he was allowed to return to his family.|$|E
5000|$|She takes {{a picture}} (the last picture) of Chester and Woodward's {{bodies in the}} {{courtyard}} below the window, and begins collecting the day's winnings, planning to check out of the hotel. Before Paula can leave, Pierre returns and robs her, telling her that he knows about their crimes and will turn her in to the police if she calls them for help. He notes that her last picture shows [...] "more than two" [...] bodies in the courtyard. Panicked, Paula runs <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>window,</b> trips over a cord on the floor, and falls to her demise leaving only one of her high heels behind in the room.|$|E
60|$|She warns us <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>out</b> for <b>the</b> back-wash {{of the bad}} vortex {{in which}} (her beam shows it) she is even now reeling.|$|R
60|$|Fifty yards farther on, a stout, red-faced, elderly gentleman was {{observed}} <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>out</b> at <b>the</b> street door and frown at things in general.|$|R
6000|$|Almost it hurt her, <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> {{window and}} see the lilacs towering in the vivid sunshine. Or was this the jewelled glass? ...|$|R
50|$|Her brother Reginer, a coachman to the king, {{asks for}} a {{portrait}} of her, and hangs it in his room. The king sees it and resolves to marry her. Her brother sends for her, and the stepmother and stepsister come too. The stepmother enchants the coachman so he is half-blind, and the bride so she is half-deaf. The white bride does not hear what the coachman says, and instead follows the stepmother's command to remove her dress and garments, and then <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>window,</b> where she is pushed out. The king is horrified by the black bride, and throws the brother into a snakepit, but the stepmother persuades him to marry the black bride.|$|E
5000|$|Back in the States, after {{viewing the}} {{commercial}} to Mr. Imahara and his assistant, Kana, the commercial is {{met with a}} positive response and agree to air it on television. Ian then receives {{a phone call from}} Kittie, and tells him <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>window.</b> When he does, he sees that Will, Chloe, Kittie and Silo are on top of a train performing stunts, something they also did {{at the beginning of the}} film when they were en route to the Alps. The film ends when the four enthusiasts let go of their skateboards and let them fly through the commercial's billboard, one of which goes through Chloe's mouth as Ian says [...] "There we go again" [...] while smiling.|$|E
50|$|One day Larsen starts {{reading a}} book on 'Psychotic time', but decides to take a stroll outside instead. When walking around his chalet, he looks into the window and sees a man sitting where he just was and reading the same book, then put the book aside <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>window.</b> Larsen realises {{that it is the}} same man from the garage, and by seeing him clearly, realises that it is himself mere moments ago. Bayliss tells him that the {{hallucinations}} are psychoretinal streams of images, {{and the only way to}} fuse the two time channels back together is to be in the same place as one of the doubles, and 'forcibly occupy the same physical co-ordinates'. The idea vexes Larsen, who is deeply troubled by the idea of seeing himself in a different time frame, and decided to keep a revolver in his letterbox for protection.|$|E
60|$|I {{must begin}} <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>out</b> for <b>the</b> box of bon-bons for the noble and {{fascinating}} Plornish-Maroon. Give him my love {{and a thousand}} kisses.|$|R
60|$|After {{pitching}} the hay down {{a little}} while, Rollo descended, {{though it was not}} necessary for Jonas to help him, for he jumped down upon the heap of hay which he had made. They then went together, attending to Jonas's work about the barn, while Rollo stopped occasionally <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> open door or window, where the sun was shining in very pleasantly. Rollo began to think it was a warm, pleasant morning.|$|R
