50|$|Fuchsia tissue {{becomes so}} {{distorted}} {{as a result}} of gall mite infestation that affected plants fail to produce normal growth and flowers, which seriously impacts their horticultural amenity value. The mites are resistant to chemical treatments, because once symptoms are visible, the mites have already entered leaf and flower buds, which afford them protection. Products that contain abamectin or spirodiclofen provide some control, though repeated applications at four-day intervals may be necessary to break the mite life cycle. Insecticidal soap and horticultural oils can also be used, and acephate may provide control on susceptible Fuchsia cultivars. Some mites can be removed from plants by cutting off distorted <b>tissue,</b> though <b>regrowth</b> is likely to be recolonised. Trials in California showed that the best control was achieved by combining the removal of tissue with pesticide application. The options for biological control are also limited, though the predatory mite Amblyseius californicus might depress fuchsia gall mite populations.|$|R
40|$|Acellular corneal stroma matrix {{has been}} used for corneal stroma engineering. However, because of its compact <b>tissue</b> structure, <b>regrowth</b> of keratocytes into the {{scaffold}} is difficult. Previously, we developed a sandwich model for cartilage engineering using acellular cartilage sheets. In the present study, we tested this model for corneal stroma regeneration using acellular porcine corneal stroma (APCS) sheets and keratocytes. Porcine corneas were decellularized by NaCl treatment, and the APCS was cut into 20 -μm-thick sheets. A rabbit corneal stroma defect model was created by lamellar keratoplasty and repaired by transplantation of five pieces of APCS sheets with keratocytes. Six months after transplantation, transparent corneas were present in the experimental group, which were confirmed by anterior segment optical coherence tomography examination and transmittance examination. The biomechanical properties in the experimental group were similar to those of normal cornea. Histological analyses showed an even distribution of keratocytes and well-oriented matrix in the stroma layer in the experimental group. Together, these results demonstrated that the sandwich model using acellular corneal stroma sheets and keratocytes could be potentially useful for corneal stroma regeneration...|$|R
50|$|Large pruning wounds, such {{as those}} left behind in trees after topping, may become entry points for {{pathogens}} and may result in extensive decay. Decay undermines, to greater or lesser extent, the long-term health and physical stability of trees; most notably in those species which compartmentalize decay less effectively. Should a tree survive topping, <b>tissue</b> <b>regrowth</b> {{at the site of}} the original topping wound(s) is generally profuse. These new multiple leaders are less well-attached than was the original treetop, partly due to the effect of advancing decay at the wound site. As these weakly attached trunks increase in size, they become more prone to fall from the tree. Wind can increase this potential. Previously topped trees can present significant hazards and should be inspected by a qualified arborist, who can recommend possible solutions, such as removal, cabling, bracing, or ongoing inspection.Aesthetic appeal is also compromised by topping, as the natural shapes of trees are lost.|$|E

As shown in our last paper, microporous Annealed Particle (MAP) gels can provide a stably linked interconnected network for <b>tissue</b> <b>regrowth.</b> While current applications of MAP gel composed of 4 -arm poly(ethylene) glycol-vinyl sulphone (PEG-VS) backbone is limited to mimicking soft tissues new backbone material 8 -arm PEG-VS increases the range of gel stiffness. Stiffer gel scaffold facilitates cell infiltration rate and expands application to tissues with greater mechanical movement. However, backbone and cross-linker materials can react in the channel and form polymers due to transverse diffusion, which causes jetting in the device and interrupts monodisperse droplet production. Here we present a three-inlet flow-focusing droplet generator which can prevent polymerization in the channel by controlling {{the width of a}} middle buffer stream. We have shown that it enables 4 times longer production time for previous material and at least 2 times longer production time for new material. MAP gel with a higher stiffness and annealing force is achieved using the 3 -inlet device. The 3 -inlet device empowers mass production of MAP gel, leading to higher reproducibility of MAP gel related research studies.

40|$|Tissue {{regeneration}} {{and repair}} have received much attention in the medical field over the years. The study of amphibians, such as newts and salamanders, has uncovered many of the processes that occur in these animals during full-limb/digit regeneration, {{a process that is}} highly limited in mammals. Understanding these processes in amphibians could shed light on how to develop and improve this process in mammals. Amputation injuries in mammals usually result in the formation of scar <b>tissue</b> with limited <b>regrowth</b> of the limb/digit; however, it has been observed that the very tips of digits (fingers and toes) can partially regrow in humans and mice under certain conditions.

40|$|PURPOSE: Oxygen {{deficiency}} in tumors reduces {{the efficacy of}} nonsurgical treatment modalities. We tested the hypothesis that electrical stimulation of the sciatic nerve could modify the oxygenation status and the blood flow of tumors implanted in the thigh of mice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The sciatic nerve was electrically stimulated at 5 Hz. Local transplantable liver tumor (TLT) and fibrosarcoma (FSaII) tumor oxygen pressure (pO(2)) and perfusion measurements were carried out using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) oximetry and the OxyLite/OxyFlo technique. The radiosensitizing effect of the protocol was assessed by irradiating FSaII tumors with X-rays. RESULTS: Tumor pO(2) increased from approximately 3 mm Hg to approximately 8 mm Hg, and relative tumor blood flow was increased by 241 % and 162 % for TLT and FSaII tumor models, respectively. The effect on the tumor oxygenation was inhibited by a nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor, {{and an increase in}} the tumor nitric oxide (NO) content was observed using EPR spin-trapping. The tumor oxygen consumption rate was decreased after the stimulation protocol. In addition, the electrical stimulation of the host <b>tissue</b> increased <b>regrowth</b> delays by a factor of 1. 65. CONCLUSIONS: This increase in tumor oxygenation is due to the temporary increase in tumor blood flow, but particularly to a decrease in the tumor oxygen consumption rate (inhibition of respiration) that is mediated by a local production of NO during the protocol. Those tumor hemodynamic changes resulted in a radiosensitizing effect...|$|R
40|$|Macrophages and {{neutrophils}} are {{the pivotal}} immune phagocytes that enter the wound after tissue injury {{to remove the}} cell debris and invaded microorganisms, which presumably facilitate the <b>regrowth</b> of injured <b>tissues.</b> Taking advantage of the regeneration abilities of zebrafish and the newly generated leukocyte-specific zebrafish lines with labeling of both leukocyte lineages, we assessed the behaviors and functions of neutrophils and macrophages during tail fin regeneration. Live imaging showed that within 6 hours post amputation, the inflammatory stage, neutrophils were the primary cells scavenging apoptotic bodies and small cell debris, although they had limited phagocytic capacity and quickly underwent apoptosis. From 6 hours post amputation on, the resolution and regeneration stage, macrophages became the dominant scavengers, efficiently resolving inflammation and facilitating <b>tissue</b> remodeling and <b>regrowth.</b> Ablation of macrophages but not neutrophils severely impaired the inflammatory resolution and tissue regeneration, resulting {{in the formation of}} large vacuoles in the regenerated fins. In contrast, removal of neutrophils slightly accelerates the regrowth of injured fin.

40|$|Two major {{difficulties}} facing widespread clinical {{implementation of}} existing Tissue Engineering (TE) {{strategies for the}} treatment of musculoskeletal disorders are (1) the cost, space and time required for ex vivo culture of a patient’s autologous cells prior to re-implantation as part of a TE construct, and (2) the potential risks and availability constraints associated with transplanting exogenous (foreign) cells. These hurdles have led to recent interest in endogenous TE strategies, in which the regenerative potential of a patient’s own cells is harnessed to promote <b>tissue</b> <b>regrowth</b> without ex vivo cell culture.

40|$|Liver {{regeneration}} is {{a highly}} organized <b>tissue</b> <b>regrowth</b> process and {{is the most important}} reaction of the liver to injury. The overall process of liver regeneration includes three phases: priming stage, proliferative phase, and termination phase. The initial step aims to induce hepatocytes to be sensitive to growth factors with the aid of some cytokines, including TNF-α and IL- 6. The proliferation phase promotes hepatocytes to re-enter G 1 with the stimulation of growth factors. While during the termination stage, hepatocytes will discontinue to proliferate to maintain normal liver mass and function. Except for cytokine- and growth factor-mediated pathways involved in regulating liver regeneration, new substances and technologies emerge to influence the regenerative process.

The absence of Schwann cells or an equivalent cell {{type in the}} central nervous system (CNS) may limit the regeneration capacity of the CNS. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have therefore been investigated for their potential to be induced to develop a Schwann cell phenotype. The methods for derivation of Schwann cell-like cells from MSCs and the benefits and limitations of each of these methods are presented in this review. Issues related to instability of the derived Schwann cell phenotype, apoptosis of derived cells in transplants, and the inability to predict with confidence how the cells will behave after transplantation are discussed. Finally, we suggest the need for further elucidation of the biology of Schwann cell differentiation and the signals for their derivation from MSC, in order to resolve these obstacles and to enable transplantation of MSC-derived Schwann cells as a therapeutic strategy in CNS injury. © 2011 Bentham Science Publishers. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Numerous {{strategies}} have been managed to improve functional recovery after {{spinal cord injury}} (SCI) but an optimal strategy doesn’t exist yet. Actually, it is {{the complexity of the}} injured spinal cord pathophysiology that begets the multifactorial approaches assessed to favour <b>tissue</b> protection, axonal <b>regrowth</b> and functional recovery. In this context, it appears that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) could take an interesting part. The aim {{of this study is to}} graft MSCs after a spinal cord compression injury in adult rat to assess their effect on functional recovery and to highlight their mechanisms of action. We found that in intravenously grafted animals, MSCs induce, as early as 1 week after the graft, an improvement of their open field and grid navigation scores compared to control animals. At the histological analysis of their dissected spinal cord, no MSCs were found within the host despite their BrdU labelling performed before the graft, whatever the delay observed: 7, 14 or 21 days. However, a cytokine array performed on spinal cord extracts 3 days after MSC graft reveals a significant increase of NGF expression in the injured tissue. Also, a significant tissue sparing effect of MSC graft was observed. Finally, we also show that MSCs promote vascularisation, as the density of blood vessels within the lesioned area was higher in grafted rats. In conclusion, we bring here some new evidences that MSCs most likely act throughout thei...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1965 The single-cross {{and most}} F₂ {{progenies}} of 19 genotypes of tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea, Schreb.) {{were used to}} study the breeding behavior of forage yield. Parental genotypes were selected for high self-sterility, high chromogen and high crude protein. These were studied in two groups of nine intermediate and ten late-flowering genotypes. Progenies were grown on the Hyslop Agronomy Farm, Corvallis, Oregon as plants spaced one foot apart with three feet between rows. Ten plants of each cross for each generation were arranged in a randomized block design with four replications. Variables measured were plant width, natural plant height, plant spread, leaf length, total plant height of <b>regrowth</b> <b>tissue,</b> plant density and forage yield. The collected data were converted to plant means. Broad- and narrow-sense estimates of heritability were obtained from expected mean squares according to Griffing's analysis (random model, method four) and compared with estimates of heritability obtained by F₂-single-cross regression. General and specific combining ability effects were observed and the single-cross-F₂ inbreeding depressions were studied. The F₂ families were obtained by the self-pollination of five single-cross plants. General combining ability mean squares averaged from two to nine {{times greater than the}} mean squares for specific combining ability, with the largest difference being 54. 7 times greater. The two populations responded similarly for the variables measured except for total plant height and plant spread. Greater progress from selection could be expected in the late- maturing group with the exception of these two traits. In most cases, single-cross progenies performed better than their corresponding F₂ progenies. The average of all single-crosses differed from the average of all F₂ progenies in 12 of 20 analyses in 1963, but in only 2 of 12 in 1964. The inbreeding characteristic was most pronounced for forage yield. High-performing single-crosses for the traits studied tended to produce high-performing F₂ progenies. Little or no heterosis was expressed and the expression of inbreeding depression appeared to be influenced greatly by the environment. Heritability estimates indicated that most traits could be studied more effectively after the second year of plant establishment. The environmental influence appeared to be less pronounced at that time. Where the coefficient of determination was high between the single-cross and F₂ generations, traits were less influenced by the environment and the disparity between the estimates of heritability was less. When used on cross-pollinated polyploid grasses, the method of diallel analysis proposed by Griffing does not appear to remove all environmental influence and thus overestimates heritability. Forage yield in the two populations of tall fescue studied was governed principally by additive gene action. Heterosis expressed was mostly in crosses involving low-performing parents...|$|R

40|$|Little {{is known}} about whether bone marrow–derived {{circulating}} progenitor cells (BMDCPCs) can transdifferentiate into adipocytes in adipose tissues or {{play a role in}} expanding adipocyte number during adipose tissue growth. Using a mouse bone marrow transplantation model, we addressed whether BMDCPCs can transdifferentiate into adipocytes under standard conditions {{as well as in the}} settings of diet-induced obesity, rosiglitazone treatment, and exposure to G-CSF. We also addressed the possibility of transdifferentiation to adipocytes in a murine parabiosis model. In each of these settings, our findings indicated that BMDCPCs did not transdifferentiate into either unilocular or multilocular adipocytes in adipose tissues. Most BMDCPCs became resident and phagocytic macrophages in adipose tissues — which resembled transdifferentiated multilocular adipocytes by appearance, but displayed cell surface markers characteristic for macrophages — in the absence of adipocyte marker expression. When exposed to adipogenic medium in vitro, bone marrow cells differentiated into multilocular, but not unilocular, adipocytes, but transdifferentiation was not observed in vivo, even in the contexts of adipose <b>tissue</b> <b>regrowth</b> or dermal wound healing. Our results suggest that BMDCPCs do not transdifferentiate into adipocytes in vivo and play little, if any, role in expanding the number of adipocytes during the growth of adipose tissues...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Red cedar, Toona ciliata (M. Roem) and its relatives, the mahoganies and {{tropical}} cedars of the Swietenioideae (Meliaceae) are highly sought after timber species inhabiting {{the old and}} new world tropics. While interest in establishing plantations is high, efforts to date have failed because larvae of the Hypsipyla spp. moth destroy the growing shoots, resulting in increased branching and poor form. Red cedar is the host of the cedar tip moth, Hypsipyla robusta Moore throughout most of its range, which includes Australasia and the western pacific. It reaches over 40 m in height when mature, with a spreading crown, long pinnate leaves and a buttressed trunk. It is an early successional tree, with a very high growth rate, favouring wide forest gaps. While there are many studies assessing attack by Hypsipyla spp. on their respective hosts, far fewer studies exist on the response of the Swietenioideae to attack. Studies to date have focused on tree height, branch number or basic biomass partitioning. This thesis is the world’s first model of tree architecture in the Swietenioideae, including damage from Hypsipyla spp. attack. All experiments were conducted in South East Queensland, Australia over three summer/autumn seasons, lasting three, eight and eight months respectively. In the first season, unmoderated tip moth attack and red cedar regrowth were monitored for 70 days in full sun. Treatments included wild tip moth damage, mechanical stem decapitation and undamaged controls. Feeding behaviour, levels of borer attack, stem <b>tissue</b> killed and <b>regrowth</b> branch numbers were all recorded. An allied experiment used damage in 20 greenhouse trees to assess resistance induction against future larvae establishment. All treatments, including controls gained secondary branches at statistically the same rate, stabilising at 9. 3 branches per plant. Tertiary branch numbers were quite variable, likely a factor of stem damage timing and oviposition. No regrowth differences between mechanical and insect damage were recorded, suggesting no growth stimulation from insect feeding. Environmental stress appeared to exert some suppression on branching. Sap exudate in the greenhouse and gallery resin outdoors suggested resistance to be the preferred mode of defence under stress. No induction effect was found from pre-feeding. In the second and third seasons, the development rules for red cedar were derived from repeated growth measurements of trees in a greenhouse and a dedicated plantation. In the greenhouse, secondary and tertiary growth responses to two levels of larval damage were recorded over two eight month periods, using a digitiser. In the plantation, growth responses to managed larvae and mechanical damage were recorded under full sun and 70 % lateral shade for two eight month periods, using plant mapping. Up to six regrowth branches were produced adjacent to the damaged tip in all greenhouse and field damage treatments, with three being the most common. There {{was no significant difference in}} branching rates between the two larval infestation rates in the greenhouse or between larval and mechanical treatments in the field (within each light treatment). But, node and leaf morphology were distinctly different between field light treatments. In the greenhouse, control plants produced no branches. In the field, full sun controls produced up to 8. 5 branches from low on the stem, while lateral shade controls produced less than one lower branch. Leaves were determinate and produced from 1 to 17 leaflet pairs, as a function of stem or branch node. Leaflet size was a function of light, number of leaflet pairs and position on the rachis. Formulae describing the growth trends of stems, branches and leaves in 3 D were then derived from the growth data and incorporated into sets of stochastic L-systems. L-systems were conceived by Aristid Lindenmayer as a formal language for the mathematical description of the development of cellular structures, such as the branching architecture of plants. The L-systems are animated as ‘Virtual Models’ written in the cpfg language through the L-Studio 54 interface. A greenhouse model, a lateral shade field model and a full sun field model are presented. They are largely to serve as future research tools, but have been utilised here to assess the diurnal light interception efficiency of the natural stem phyllotactic angle versus near alternatives, in both branched and unbranched architectures. Results show that the natural angle is the most efficient and this is discussed in terms of biological, physical and pest influences. Finally the field shade model is used to demonstrate a possible mechanism for producing a straight trunk tree in a forest gap, under a regime of probabilistic tip moth attack and stochastic regrowth branching. The tree is grown for 10 years, ending in an approximate canopy. Finally, a hypothetical integrated scenario for the growth of red cedar is presented as an adaptive compromise to a changing physical environment, within a gradually closing forest gap and a trade-off between height gain and losses to the cedar tip moth...|$|R
40|$|The wound {{repair process}} is a highly ordered {{sequence}} of events that encompasses haemostasis, inflammatory cell infiltration, <b>tissue</b> <b>regrowth</b> and remodelling. Wound healing follows tissue destruction so we hypothesized that antibodies might bind to wounded tissues, which would facilitate the engulfment of damaged tissues by macrophages. Here, we show that B cells, which produce antibodies to damaged tissues, are engaged {{in the process of}} wound healing. Splenectomy delayed wound healing, and transfer of spleen cells into splenectomized mice recovered the delay in wound healing. Furthermore, wound healing in splenectomized nude mice was also delayed. Transfer of enriched B 220 + cells by magnetic beads accelerated wound healing in splenectomized mice. We detected immunoglobulin G 1 (IgG 1) binding to wounded tissues by using fluorescein isothiocyanate-labelled anti-IgG 1 6 – 24 hr after wounding. Splenectomy reduced the amount of IgG 1 binding to wounded tissues. Immunoblotting studies revealed several bands, which were reduced by splenectomy. Using immunoprecipitation with anti-IgG bound to protein G we found that the intensity of several bands was lower in the serum from splenectomized mice than in that from sham-operated mice. These bands were matched to myosin IIA, carbamoyl-phosphate synthase, argininosuccinate synthase, actin and α-actinin- 4 by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry analysis...|$|E

(~ 10 cm) core barrel. The transplants were fixed to Reef Ball™ substrates using an adhesive marine epoxy. Drill holes in the donor corals (core holes) were filled with concrete plugs. Control corals, of comparable size to both donor colonies and transplant corals, were monitored for comparison. Transplant corals, donor corals, and controls on the natural reef were monitored for growth and survivorship. Core holes were monitored for <b>tissue</b> <b>regrowth</b> over the surface of concrete plugs. Growth during the transplantation project was defined as an increase in surface area of tissue and skeleton. Growth was monitored on a quarterly basis using photographic techniques.

No significant difference in the change in percent tissue coverage between both species of donor corals or between their respective controls was determined. The process of filling core holes in donor colonies with concrete plugs was effective, however, tissue did not completely regenerate over the surface of plugs in either species over the relatively short 15 -month observation period.

40|$|Micro-plasma is a {{possible}} alternative treatment for wound management. The effect of micro-plasma on wound healing depends on its composition and temperature. The authors previously developed a capillary-tube-based micro-plasma system that can generate micro-plasma with a high nitric oxide-containing species composition and mild working temperature. Here, the efficacy of micro-plasma treatment on wound healing in a laser-induced skin wound mouse model was investigated. A partial thickness wound {{was created in the}} back skin of each mouse and then treated with micro-plasma. Non-invasive methods, namely wound closure kinetics, optical coherence tomography (OCT), and laser Doppler scanning, were used to measure the healing efficiency in the wound area. Neo-tissue growth and the expressions of matrix metallopeptidase- 3 (MMP- 3) and laminin in the wound area were assessed using histological and immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis. The results show that micro-plasma treatment promoted wound healing. Micro-plasma treatment significantly reduced the wound bed region. The OCT images and histological analysis indicates more pronounced <b>tissue</b> <b>regrowth</b> in the wound bed region after micro-plasma treatment. The laser Doppler images shows that micro-plasma treatment promoted blood flow in the wound bed region. The IHC results show that the level of laminin increased in the wound bed region after micro-plasma treatment, whereas the level of MMP- 3 decreased. Based on these results, micro-plasma has potential to be used to promote the healing of skin wounds clinically...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: The {{present study}} {{established}} characteristics of <b>tissue</b> <b>regrowth</b> in patients suffering knee lesions treated with grafts of autologous chondrocytes grown on three-dimensional hyaluronic acid biomaterials. METHODS: This multicentred study involved a second-look arthroscopy/biopsy, 5 to 33 months post implant (n = 63). Seven patients allowed a third-look biopsy, {{three of which}} were performed 18 months post implant. Characteristics of tissues were histologically and histochemically evaluated. The remaining bone stubs were evaluated for cartilage/bone integration. For data analysis, biopsies were further divided into those obtained from postoperative symptomatic patients (n = 41) or from asymptomatic patients (n = 22). RESULTS: The percentage of hyaline regenerated tissues was significantly greater in biopsies obtained after, versus within, 18 months of implantation. Differences were also observed between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients: reparative tissues taken from symptomatic patients 18 months after grafting were mainly fibrocartilage or mixed (hyaline-fibrocartilage) tissue, while tissues taken from asymptomatic patients were hyaline cartilage in 83 % of biopsies. In {{a small group of}} asymptomatic patients (n = 3), second-look and third-look biopsies taken 18 months after surgery confirmed maturation of the newly formed tissue over time. Cartilage maturation occurred from the inner regions of the graft, in contact with subchondral bone, towards the periphery of the implant. CONCLUSIONS: The study indicates that, in asymptomatic patients after chondrocyte implantation, regenerated tissue undergoes a process of maturation that in the majority of cases takes longer than 18 months for completion and leads to hyaline tissue and not fibrous cartilage. Persistence of symptoms might reflect the presence of a nonhyaline cartilage repair tissue...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} partial removal of epididymal (EPI) and retroperitoneal (RET) adipose tissues (partial lipectomy) on the {{triacylglycerol}} deposition of high fat diet induced obese rats were analyzed, aiming {{to challenge the}} hypothesized body fat regulatory system. Male 28 -day-old wistar rats received a diet enriched with peanuts, milk chocolate and sweet biscuits during the experimental period. At the 90 th day of life, rats were submitted to either lipectomy (L) or sham surgery. After 7 or 30 days, RET, EPI, liver, brown adipose tissue (BAT), blood and carcass were obtained and analyzed. Seven days following surgery, liver lipogenesis rate and EPI relative weight were increased in L.

L rats also presented increased liver malic enzyme activity, BAT lipogenesis, and triacylglycerol and corticosterone serum levels. the partial removal of visceral fat pads affected the metabolism of high fat diet obese rats, which leads to excised <b>tissue</b> <b>regrowth</b> and possibly compensatory growth of non-excised depots at a later time.

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{developing}} a tissue either in vitro or in vivo taking inspiration from physiological events has prompted toward the integration of molecular signals such as growth factors (GFs) in tissue engineering strategies with the aim to guide cell proliferation, differentiation and migration. After the first studies, the awareness emerged that a fine tuning of GF levels in the scaffold, when present, and at boundary with healthy tissue was needed to give successful results. Thus, the modality of GF presentation to cells has been recognized as a key fundamental in many tissue engineering applications and applied through different approaches. In this scenario the potential of particulate systems for GF delivery was promptly perceived {{as a mean to}} protect GFs during <b>tissue</b> <b>regrowth</b> and to offer adequate control over release rate. The use of tissue engineering constructs based on GF-loaded particles integrated in different scaffold types has impressively grown in recent years and led to significant advances in the field. Release of more than one GF at rates mimicking in vivo situation has become possible as well as to exert a fine control over GF spatial concentration by developing constructs with specific areas of bioactivities. However, if we consider the strategies for protein delivery currently applied in tissue engineering, it is soon realized that much more can be done. Thus, the aim here is to review some tissue engineering approaches involving the use of GFs by {{the point of view of}} delivery issues trying to highlight the remarkable impact that particulate systems can have in the next future...|$|E
40|$|Apoptosis is {{a tightly}} {{controlled}} process in mammalian cells. It {{is important for}} embryogenesis, tissue homoeostasis, and cancer treatment. Apoptosis not only induces cell death, but also leads {{to the release of}} signals that promote rapid proliferation of surrounding cells through the Phoenix Rising (PR) pathway. To quantitatively understand the kinetics of interactions of different molecules in this pathway, we developed a mathematical model to simulate the effects of various changes in the PR pathway on the secretion of prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2), a key factor for promoting cell proliferation. These changes include activation of caspase 3 (C 3), caspase 7 (C 7), and nuclear factor kB (NFkB). In addition, we simulated the effects of cyclooxygenase- 2 (COX 2) inhibition and C 3 knockout on the level of secreted PGE 2. The model predictions on PGE 2 in MEF and 4 T 1 cells at 48 hours after 10 -Gray radiation were quantitatively consistent with the experimental data in the literature. Compared to C 7, the model predicted that C 3 activation was more critical for PGE 2 production. The model also predicted that PGE 2 production could be significantly reduced when COX 2 expression was blocked via either NFkB inactivation or treatment of cells with exogenous COX 2 inhibitors, which led to a decrease in the rate of conversion from arachidonic acid to prostaglandin H 2 in the PR pathway. In conclusion, the mathematical model developed in this study yielded new insights into the process of <b>tissue</b> <b>regrowth</b> stimulated by signals from apoptotic cells. In future studies, the model can be used for experimental data analysis and assisting development of novel strategies/drugs for improving cance...|$|E
40|$|Since it was {{introduced}} {{at the end of}} the ' 60 s, the 45 S 5 Bioglass (R) has played a fundamental role among the materials for orthopedic applications because of its ability to build a stable bond with the surrounding bone. The recent development of bone tissue engineering has led the interest of many scientists in the design of Bioglass (R) -based scaffolds, i. e. porous systems able to drive and foster the bone <b>tissue</b> <b>regrowth.</b> Among the available techniques to realize scaffolds, the polymer burning out method, which employs organic particles as pore generating agents in a ceramic matrix, combines versatility and low cost. In spite of the advantages of the polymer burning out method, this technique has been rarely applied to 45 S 5 Bioglass (R) and a systematic feasibility study has not been carried out on this issue yet. In order to fill this gap, in the present contribution the polymer burning out method was employed to design macroporous scaffolds based on 45 S 5 Bioglass (R). Different amounts of organic phase were used to obtain samples with different porosity. The samples were characterized from a microstructural point of view, in order to evaluate the pore morphology, dimension and degree of interconnectivity. Such findings proved that a proper setting of the processing parameters made it possible to achieve very high porosity values, among the best ones obtained in the literature with the same technique, together with an appreciable mechanical behaviour, according to compression tests. Finally, the scaffolds bioactivity was assessed by means of in vitro tests in a simulated body fluid (SBF) solution. Moreover, in the view of a potential application for bone tissue engineering, a preliminary biological evaluation of the obtained scaffolds to sustain cell proliferation was carried ou...|$|E
40|$|Injuries to {{the spinal}} cord induce {{distinct}} changes at the lesion site. Over recent years, {{it has been shown}} that the hostile environment of the reactive, lesioned central nervous system inhibits axonal regrowth. This is in stark contrast to the lesioned peripheral nervous system which has a strong capacity for axon regeneration and functional recovery. In the present thesis, a tissue engineering strategy to promote orientated axonal regrowth and functional tissue repair has been investigated in an experimental animal model of acute spinal cord injury. After undergoing a mid-cervical (C 4) dorsal laminectomy, adult female Lewis rats were subjected to a unilateral funiculotomy (involving a tissue resection of 1 - 2 mm). A novel, orientated, type I collagen matrix (either seeded or non-seeded with syngeneic olfactory ensheathing cells, OEC) was implanted into the lesion gap and the function of the ipsilateral fore-paw was monitored. At the end-point survival time of 5 months, animals were perfused and the lesion site dissected and processed for immunohistochemistry to demonstrate host astrocystic, axonal and dendritic responses using antibodies to glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), growth associated protein- 43 (Gap- 43 /B 50), 200 kDa phosphorylated neurofilament (NF 200) and microtubule associated protein 2 (MAP- 2). The type I collagen matrix was found to be biocompatible and acted as a guidance system, supporting the longitudinally orientated regeneration of host axon Integration of the OEC-seeded matrix was most successful, with both host astrocytic and axonal profiles crossing the graft-host interface and penetrating the implant to varying degrees. Surprisingly, host dendrites were also found to penetrate the implanted matrices, a so-far undescribed phenomenon. Furthermore, the interface between the matrix and dura mater was found to be a region of substantial <b>tissue</b> <b>regrowth</b> and orientated axon regeneration. Although implanted scaffolds supported improved motor performance of the ipsilateral fore-paw, there was no clear correlation between the extent of axon regeneration and the degree of functional recovery. It is likely, therefore, that implanted devices may exert hitherto unexpected beneficial effects on the lesioned central nervous system...|$|E
40|$|Background: Delayed {{reconstruction}} of transection or laceration injuries of peripheral nerves is inflicted by a reduced regeneration capacity. Diabetic conditions, more frequently encountered in clinical practice, {{are known to}} further impair regeneration in peripheral nerves. Chitosan nerve guides (CNGs) have recently been introduced as {{a new generation of}} medical devices for immediate peripheral nerve reconstruction. Here, CNGs were used for 45 days delayed {{reconstruction of}} critical length 15 mm rat sciatic nerve defects in either healthy Wistar rats or diabetic Goto-Kakizaki rats; the latter resembling type 2 diabetes. In short and long-term investigations, we comprehensively analyzed the performance of one-chambered hollow CNGs (hCNGs) and two-chambered CNGs (CFeCNGs) in which a chitosan film has been longitudinally introduced. Additionally, we investigated in vitro the immunomodulatory effect provided by the chitosan film. Results: Both types of nerve guides, i. e. hCNGs and CFeCNGs, enabled moderate morphological and functional nerve regeneration after reconstruction that was delayed for 45 days. These positive findings were detectable in generally healthy as well as in diabetic Goto-Kakizaki rats (for the latter only in short-term studies). The regenerative outcome did not reach the degree as recently demonstrated after immediate reconstruction using hCNGs and CFeCNGs. CFeCNG-treatment, however, enabled <b>tissue</b> <b>regrowth</b> in all animals (hCNGs: only in 80 % of animals). CFeCNGs did further support with an increased vascularization of the regenerated tissue and an enhanced regrowth of motor axons. One mechanism by which the CFeCNGs potentially support successful regeneration is an immunomodulatory effect induced by the chitosan film itself. Our in vitro results suggest that the pro-regenerative effect of chitosan is related to the differentiation of chitosan-adherent monocytes into pro-healing M 2 macrophages. Conclusions: No considerable differences appear for the delayed nerve regeneration process related to healthy and diabetic conditions. Currently available chitosan nerve grafts do not support delayed nerve regeneration to the same extent as they do after immediate nerve reconstruction. The immunomodulatory characteristics of the biomaterial may, however, be crucial for their regeneration supportive effects...|$|E
40|$|Currently {{available}} clinical therapies are {{not capable}} to regenerate tissues that are lost by periodontitis. Tissue engineering {{can be applied}} as a strategy to regenerate reliably the tissues and function of damaged periodontium. A prerequisite for this regeneration is the colonization of the defect with the adequate cell populations. In this study, we proposed a bilayered system composed of (1) a platelet lysate (PL) -based construct produced by crosslinking of PL proteins with genipin (gPL) for the delivery of rat periodontal ligament cells (rat-PDLCs); combined with (2) an injectable composite consisting of calcium phosphate cement incorporated with PL loaded poly(d, l-lactic-co-glycolic acid) microspheres. This system was expected to promote periodontal regeneration by the delivery of adequate progenitor cells and providing a stable system enriched with adequate cytokines and growth factors for the orchestration of <b>tissue</b> <b>regrowth</b> in periodontal defects. The bilayered system was tested in a three-wall intrabony defect in rats and the healing of periodontal tissue was assessed 6 weeks after surgery. Results showed that the bilayered system was able to promote the regrowth of functional periodontal tissues, both with (cells + gPL) and without the loading of PDLCs (gPL). Significant connective tissue attachment (45. 0 â 15. 0 % and 64. 0 â 15. 0 % for gPL and cells + gPL group, respectively) and new bone area (33. 8 â 21 % and 21. 3 â 3 % for gPL and cells + gPL group, respectively) were observed. Nevertheless, rat PDLCs delivered with gPL construct in the defect area were hardly visible 6 weeks after surgery and did not contribute for the regeneration of new periodontal tissue. Overall, our findings show that the bilayered system promotes the stabilization of PL proteins on the root surface and has a positive effect in the repair of periodontal tissues both in quality and in quantity.

40|$|Upon {{forming a}} biofilm, {{bacteria}} undergo several changes that {{prevent them from}} being eradicated with antimicrobials alone. These biofilms manifest as persistent infections and biofouling in the medical and industrial world, respectively, constituting an ongoing medical crisis and creating a huge financial burden. Biofilms on implanted medical devices cause thousands of patients each year to undergo multiple surgeries to explant and replace the implant, driving {{billions of dollars in}} increased health care costs {{due to the lack of}} viable treatment options for in situ biofilm eradication. Heat has been used to reliably eliminate biofilms for many years, but the temperatures employed are infeasible for many applications, particularly in vivo medical treatment. Remotely activated localized heat can be applied through a superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticle polymer coating when paired with an alternating magnetic field. However, there is very little known about the temperatures required to kill the biofilms and the effects of the heat in conjunction with antibiotics. To better understand the required parameters to effectively kill off bacteria in biofilms a variety of heat treatments were investigated for a variety of Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms grown in different conditions. Additionally, these heat treatments were combined with antibiotics to better understand any combined effects of the two orthogonal treatment plans. It was found that heat is an effective method for killing the bacteria in biofilms. Temperatures ranging from body temperature, 37 °C, to 80 °C were used to heat shock the biofilms for 1 to 30 minutes. Higher temperatures for short exposure times yielded similar results to lower temperatures for longer exposure time. Biofilms grown in different conditions did vary in their susceptibility to the heat shocks; however, at the higher temperatures the differences became negligible. Therefore, the more effective treatments were the higher temperature heat shocks with shorter exposure times to maximize bacterial cell death and minimize the potential heat transfer to the surrounding <b>tissue.</b> <b>Regrowth</b> studies indicate a critical post-shock bacterial loading (~ 103 CFU/cm 2) below which the biofilms were no longer viable, while films above that loading slowly regrew to their previous population density. Combined treatments with antibiotics had synergistic effects for all antibiotics across a window of heat shock conditions. Erythromycin in particular, which showed no effect on the biofilm alone, decreased biofilm population by six orders of magnitude at temperatures which had no effect in the absence of antibiotics. These studies will evolve the understanding of biofilms and how to efficiently eradicate them on implant surfaces. The introduction of such a novel coating in conjunction with antibiotics could obviate thousands of surgeries and save billions of dollars spent on explantation, recovery, and re-implantation...|$|E
40|$|Porites lobata is an {{important}} reef building coral in the tropical eastern Pacific and the dominant Porites species in the Galápagos archipelago. Following the 1982 - 83 El Niño-Southern Oscillation the Galápagos Islands experienced 97 - 99 % coral mortality, leaving many areas throughout the archipelago denuded of corals. Because very few long term assessments have been conducted on the growth and resilience of P. lobata to natural disturbances in the Galápagos Islands (Glynn et al., 2001; Glynn et al., 2009), benthic surveys were performed on a uniquely dense aggregation of P. lobata colonies at Devil’s Crown, Floreana Island between 1993 and 2011. Annual changes in live tissue area were calculated {{for the majority of}} the population (n= 17) using Coral Point Count with Excel extensions (CPCe 3. 6) software to determine growth and recovery trends for this aggregation. Total live tissue area (n= 10) increased from 1993 to 2011, however due to high interannual variability this increase was not significant. Within this overall pattern, a general trend of decline was observed in live tissue cover from 1993 to 2000, with increases in tissue area observed from 2000 to 2011. Severe bleaching (85 - 100 %) was observed during the 1998 survey, followed by 42 % tissue loss (n= 10), coinciding with sea water warming associated with the very strong 1997 - 1998 El Niño-Southern Oscillation event. Subsequent regrowth of coral tissue was observed during the 2001 survey with continued recovery through 2009. Multiple comparison testing revealed a significant difference between the impacted state (1999) and the recovered state (2009), (p = 0. 002, Dunn’s method, n= 17), suggesting this aggregation required a period of ten years to recover from this disturbance. During this recovery period the moderately strong 2007 - 2008 La Niña, with accompanying stressful low temperatures, occurred but did not interrupt <b>tissue</b> <b>regrowth.</b> Warmer than average sea surface temperatures occurred during the warm months from 2008 to 2011, during which time a cool period occurred from 2010 to 2011. While the magnitude and duration of temperature anomalies during warming were not as great as those observed during the 1997 - 98 ENSO, low temperatures observed during the cool period were similar to those experienced throughout the 2007 - 08 La Niña. During this time total live tissue cover was reduced by 19 % (n= 10); however it is unknown whether this was due to warming or the following cool period. Based on results from the 1997 - 98 El Niño and 2007 - 08 La Niña, this reduction in live tissue was most likely caused by elevated sea surface temperatures. Data on the growth and resilience of P. lobata populations at Devil’s Crown will be used for conservation and management of this important resource...|$|E
40|$|The {{growth and}} {{survivorship}} of {{two species of}} scleractinian coral transplants, Meandrina meandrites and Montastrea cavernosa, were investigated. Identically sized replicate transplants {{were obtained from the}} second reef, off Dania Beach, using a hydraulic drill fitted with a 4 ” core barrel. The transplants were fixed to Reef Ball™ substrates using an adhesive marine epoxy. Drill holes in the donor corals (core holes) were filled with concrete plugs to prevent the detrimental effects of bioeroders. Control corals, of comparable size to both the donor colonies and the transplant corals, were selected for comparison. The transplant corals, donor corals, and controls on the natural reef were monitored for growth and survivorship. The core holes were monitored for <b>tissue</b> <b>regrowth</b> over the surface of the concrete plug, in order to assess the effectiveness of the plugging process. Growth during the transplantation project was defined as an increase in surface area or radius, and was monitored on a quarterly basis using photographic techniques. SigmaScan© Pro 4 image analysis software (Jandel Scientific Corporation) was used for the analysis of the photographic data. The following main hypothesis was tested: species-specific differences will occur in the responses of coral colonies to drilling and transplantation. Additional sub-hypotheses were tested, including: 1) a change in surface area and/ or radius in the experimental corals and the control corals will take place, 2) the survivorship of the experimental corals and their control corals will be similar, 3) a change in surface area and/ or radius of the tissue surrounding the core holes will take place. Meandrina meandrites transplants exhibited a substantial amount of mortality and displayed significantly less growth (both in surface area and radius change) than M. cavernosa transplants, and the M. meandrites controls. Montastrea cavernosa transplants experienced significantly more growth than their same species controls. All donor corals that experienced drill damage (separate from the drill holes) were able to regenerate the injured tissue in a period of less than three months. No significant difference was found for the change in percent tissue coverage for either donor species when compared {{with each other and with}} their same species controls. Tissue did not completely regenerate over the surface of the concrete core hole plugs in either species. However, there was no significant difference between the initial area/ radius of the core holes and the final area/ radius for either M. meandrites or M. cavernosa. Additionally, there was no significant difference in the total area change of the core holes when the two species were compared. The results of this study indicated that M. meandrites did not demonstrate statistically significant survivorship or growth as a transplant coral. The M. cavernosa transplants were successful, and displayed a significant increase in surface area. The areas surrounding the core holes did not significantly increase in surface area in either species of donor corals...|$|E
