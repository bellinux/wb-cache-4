5|$|With a {{fight about}} to break out over Jon Snow's (Kit Harington) body {{following}} his assassination, the Wildlings arrive at Castle Black and force Alliser Thorne (Owen Teale) and his allies to surrender, allowing Melisandre (Carice van Houten) to resurrect Jon. At Winterfell, news of a son being born to Walda Frey (Elizabeth Webster) leads Ramsay Bolton (Iwan Rheon) to murder his father Roose Bolton (Michael McElhatton), {{as well as his}} step-mother and newborn brother. Across the Narrow Sea, Tyrion Lannister (Peter Dinklage) unchains the dragons being held in the catacombs of Meereen, and Arya Stark (Maisie Williams) proceeds <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>step</b> in her training in Braavos.

5|$|Preckwinkle {{chairs the}} ward organization, the Fourth Ward Democratic Organization, {{which was one}} of sixteen Chicago Democratic ward {{organizations}} named in a complaint filed on August 31, 2005 with the Illinois State Board of Elections by the Cook County Republican Party charging that Democratic Party ward organizations are illegally housed in City-funded neighborhood ward offices. Taxpayers fund aldermanic service centers, which are open to the public. State law prohibits the use of public funds by any candidate for political or campaign purposes. The complaint against Preckwinkle's ward organization was one of nine that a Hearing Officer appointed by the Board recommended proceed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>step</b> of the hearing process, an Open Preliminary Hearing. On October 17, 2005, at a regularly scheduled meeting of the Board of Elections, the Board entered an executive session and voted, in a 4–4 tie, along strict party lines, failing to adopt the recommendation of the Hearing Officer, and ordered the complaints dismissed. The complaint against Preckwinkle's ward organization was one of eight that the Cook County Republican Party appealed {{all the way to the}} Supreme Court of Illinois. On January 23, 2009, the Illinois Supreme Court unanimously ordered the Illinois appellate court to conduct a judicial review of the Board's dismissals of the complaints.|$|E

500|$|Many critics {{complained that}} Conan copied many ideas from God of War. [...] Game Informer {{referred}} to this imitation as [...] " [...] groveling at Kratos' feet, begging for gameplay wisdom". [...] A few reviewers, however, found this forgivable and stated that the game was made to be fun without any higher ambitions. [...] Conans camera system irritated several critics for failing to provide an adequate view of the situation at certain critical moments. [...] Its puzzles were oversimple and lacked clear directions for proceeding <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>step.</b> [...] The artificial intelligence for the adversaries in the game {{was found to be}} predictable and flawed by a few critics. [...] In addition, they found the final encounter with Graven to be overlong and frustrating.

500|$|What's Cooking? is an {{interactive}} cookbook and food preparation video game with recipes that each list preparation times, ingredients and courses. Recipes can be sorted by criteria such as dishes that take less than 20 minutes to prepare, or vegetarian-only meals. After opening a recipe, an ingredient list is presented. Items {{on the list}} can be earmarked and added to a shopping list as a reminder to purchase in the future. A timer option is also available, which counts down from a specified time and makes an audible sound when it is done. Before doing any real cooking, a virtual representation of each step in the recipe is given on the screen that must be performed by the player. The Nintendo DS touchscreen and stylus are used to perform tasks such as whisking eggs, pouring sauces and cutting vegetables. Tutorials are also available to teach the player how to perform simple cooking preparation tasks. While cooking, the Nintendo DS responds to audible commands; saying [...] "next" [...] into the device's microphone will move the recipe on <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>step.</b> One hundred recipes {{are included in the}} game, and players can create their own dishes in the game. Afterward, they can share them with others via Wi-Fi. In addition to the game's cooking aspects, What's Cooking? features challenges in which the player uses the stylus to chop, stir, and serve as quickly as possible.|$|E

500|$|William Grimes, {{writing in}} the New York Times, {{described}} The Utility of Force as [...] "a closely argued, searching textbook on strategy and the efficient use of military power in the post-Cold War era". Grimes also {{described it as a}} [...] "difficult, challenging book", saying [...] "you can almost hear the pointer hit the blackboard as he works his way rigorously through each argument and sub-arguments A, B and C, before proceeding <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>step.</b> At times the history lecture becomes a forced march over very familiar terrain, but patient readers will discover that there is indeed a final destination". In a second review for the New York Times in 2007, Niall Ferguson, a history professor at Harvard University, described The Utility of Force as an update of Clausewitz's On War [...] "for our times". Ferguson went on to criticise Smith for drawing too clear a distinction between [...] "war amongst the people" [...] and [...] "war between peoples", pointing out that in several conflicts there was no single, homogeneous [...] "people" [...] and that wars amongst the people can easily transform into wars between people, citing Bosnia as an example. Ferguson was underwhelmed by Smith's recommendations for the future—Smith believes that new equipment and strategies are required in order for armies to be effective in the new paradigm, but does not offer any suggestions. Ferguson's final criticism was what he described as the book's [...] "limited historical perspective"; Smith argues that [...] "war amongst the people" [...] emerged {{in the second half of}} the 20th century during the proxy wars and de-colonisation campaigns of the Cold War era, but Ferguson gave examples of similar campaigns which pre-dated the Cold War, including the First Boer War (1880–81) and campaigns fought in Eastern Europe during the Second World War. Nonetheless, Ferguson concludes that The Utility of Force is [...] "an impressive and absorbing work", and described Smith as [...] "the Clausewitz of low-intensity conflict and peacekeeping operations".|$|E
