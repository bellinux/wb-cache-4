25|$|Smoke is {{primarily}} mitigated by more evenly mixing the fuel with air. As {{discussed in the}} fuel injector section above, modern fuel injectors (such as airblast fuel injectors) evenly atomize the fuel and eliminate local pockets of high fuel concentration. Most modern engines use these <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>fuel</b> injectors and are essentially smokeless.|$|E
25|$|The major {{application}} of PEM fuel cells focuses on transportation {{primarily because of}} their potential impact on the environment, e.g. the control of emission of the green house gases (GHG). Other applications include distributed/stationary and portable power generation. Most major motor companies work solely on PEM fuel cells due to their high power density and excellent dynamic characteristics as compared with other <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>fuel</b> cells.|$|E

50|$|The {{most common}} <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>fuel</b> gas in current use is natural gas.|$|R
25|$|Solid {{oxide fuel}} cells (SOFCs) use a solid material, most {{commonly}} a ceramic material called yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ), as the electrolyte. Because SOFCs are made entirely of solid materials, {{they are not}} limited to the flat plane configuration of other <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>fuel</b> cells and are often designed as rolled tubes. They require high operating temperatures (800–1000°C) and can be run on a variety of fuels including natural gas.|$|E
25|$|The 3-carbon alcohol, {{propanol}} (C3H7OH), is {{not often}} used as a direct fuel source for petrol engines(unlike ethanol, methanol and butanol), with most being directed into use as a solvent. However, it {{is used as a}} source of hydrogen in some <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>fuel</b> cell; it can generate a higher voltage than methanol, which is the fuel of choice for most alcohol-based fuel cells. However, since propanol is harder to produce than methanol (biologically OR from oil), methanol-utilising fuel cells are preferred over those that utilise propanol.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to this pure hydrogen type, there are hydrocarbon fuels for fuel cells, including diesel, methanol (see: direct-methanol fuel cells and indirect methanol fuel cells) and chemical hydrides. The waste products with these <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>fuel</b> are carbon dioxide and water. When hydrogen is used, the CO2 is released when methane from natural gas is combined with steam, in a process called steam methane reforming, to produce the hydrogen. This can {{take place in a}} different location to the fuel cell, potentially allowing the hydrogen fuel cell to be used indoors—for example, in fork lifts.|$|E

50|$|A {{pressure}} carburetor is a <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>fuel</b> {{metering system}} manufactured by the Bendix Corporation for piston aircraft engines, {{starting in the}} 1940s. It is recognized as an early <b>type</b> <b>of</b> throttle-body <b>fuel</b> injection and was developed to prevent fuel starvation during inverted flight.|$|R
25|$|In {{a nuclear}} power reactor, there are two <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>fuel.</b> The first is fissile material, which splits when hit by neutrons, {{releasing}} {{a large amount of}} energy and also releasing two or three new neutrons. These can split more fissile material, resulting in a continued chain reaction. Examples of fissile fuels are U-233, U-235 and Pu-239. The second type of fuel is called fertile. Examples of fertile fuel are Th-232 (mined thorium) and U-238 (mined uranium). Often the amount of fertile fuel in the reactor is far greater than the amount of fissile, but it cannot be fissioned directly. It must first absorb one of the 2 or 3 neutrons produced in the fission process, which is called neutron capture, then it becomes a fissile isotope by radioactive decay. This process is called breeding.|$|E
25|$|Fuel {{dispensers}} {{are used}} to pump petrol/gasoline, diesel, compressed natural gas, CGH2, HCNG, LPG, liquid hydrogen, kerosene, alcohol fuel (like methanol, ethanol, butanol, propanol), biofuels (like straight vegetable oil, biodiesel), or other <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>fuel</b> into the tanks within vehicles and calculate the financial cost of the fuel transferred to the vehicle. Fuel dispensers are also known as bowsers (in some parts of Australia), petrol pumps (in most Commonwealth countries) or gas pumps (in North America). Besides fuel dispensers, one other significant device which {{is also found in}} filling stations and can refuel certain (compressed-air) vehicles is an air compressor, although generally these are just used to inflate car tyres. Also, many filling stations incorporate a convenience store, which like most other buildings generally have electricity sockets; hence plug-in electric vehicles can be recharged.|$|E
25|$|Due {{to their}} light weight, PEMFCs are most suited for {{transportation}} applications. PEMFCs for buses, which use compressed hydrogen for fuel, can operate {{at up to}} 40% efficiency. Generally PEMFCs are implemented on buses over smaller cars because of the available volume to house the system and store the fuel. Technical issues for transportation involve incorporation of PEMs into current vehicle technology and updating energy systems. Full fuel cell vehicles are not advantageous if hydrogen is sourced from fossil fuels; however, they become beneficial when implemented as hybrids. There is potential for PEMFCs {{to be used for}} stationary power generation, where they provide 5kW at 30% efficiency; however, they run into competition with other <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>fuel</b> cells, mainly SOFCs and MCFCs. Whereas PEMFCs generally require high purity hydrogen for operation, other fuel cell types can run on methane and are thus more flexible systems. Therefore, PEMFCs are best for small scale systems until economically scalable pure hydrogen is available. Furthermore, PEMFCs have the possibility of replacing batteries for portable electronics, though integration of the hydrogen supply is a technical challenge particularly without a convenient location to store it within the device.|$|E

This <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>fuel</b> injector led to the first smokeless combustors. The air used is just same amount of the primary air (see Air flow paths below) that is diverted through the injector, rather than the swirler. This <b>type</b> <b>of</b> injector also requires lower fuel pressures than the pressure atomizing type.|$|R

2500|$|A fuel {{dispenser}} {{is used to}} pump gasoline, diesel, or other <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>fuel</b> into vehicles or containers. As the automobile was not invented yet, the gas pump was used for kerosene lamps and stoves. Sylvanus F. Bowser of Fort Wayne, Indiana invented the gasoline/petrol pump on September 5, 1885. Coincidentally, the term [...] "bowser" [...] is still often used {{in countries such as}} New Zealand and Australia as a reference to the {{fuel dispenser}}.|$|E
2500|$|In most {{stations}} in Canada and the USA, the pump {{has a single}} nozzle and the customer selects the desired octane grade by pushing a button. Some pumps require the customer {{to pick up the}} nozzle first, then lift a lever underneath it; others are designed so that lifting the nozzle automatically releases a switch. [...] Some newer stations have separate nozzles for different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>fuel.</b> [...] Where diesel fuel is provided, it is usually dispensed from a separate nozzle even if the various grades of gasoline share the same nozzle.|$|E

2500|$|The fuel {{injector}} {{is responsible for}} introducing fuel to the combustion zone and, along with the swirler (above), is responsible for mixing the fuel and air. There are four primary <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>fuel</b> injectors; pressure-atomizing, air blast, vaporizing, and premix/prevaporizing injectors. Pressure atomizing {{fuel injector}}s rely on high fuel pressures (as much as [...] ) to atomize the fuel. This type of fuel injector {{has the advantage of}} being very simple, but it has several disadvantages. The fuel system must be robust enough to withstand such high pressures, and the fuel tends to be heterogeneously atomized, resulting in incomplete or uneven combustion which has more pollutants and smoke.|$|E
2500|$|SOFCs {{are unique}} since in those, {{negatively}} charged oxygen ions travel from the cathode (positive {{side of the}} fuel cell) to the anode (negative side of the fuel cell) instead of positively charged hydrogen ions travelling from the anode to the cathode, {{as is the case}} in all other <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>fuel</b> cells. Oxygen gas is fed through the cathode, where it absorbs electrons to create oxygen ions. The oxygen ions then travel through the electrolyte to react with hydrogen gas at the anode. The reaction at the anode produces electricity and water as by-products. Carbon dioxide may also be a by-product depending on the fuel, but the carbon emissions from an SOFC system are less than those from a fossil fuel combustion plant. The chemical reactions for the SOFC system can be expressed as follows: ...|$|E
2500|$|While {{there are}} {{different}} <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>fuel</b> that may power cars, most rely on gasoline or diesel. The United States Environmental Protection Agency states that the average vehicle emits 8,887 grams of carbon dioxide per gallon of gasoline. The average vehicle running on diesel fuel will emit 10,180 grams of carbon dioxide. Many governments are using fiscal policies (such as road tax or the US gas guzzler tax) to influence vehicle purchase decisions, with a low [...] figure often resulting in reduced taxation. Fuel taxes may act as an incentive {{for the production of}} more efficient, hence less polluting, car designs (e.g. hybrid vehicles) and the development of alternative fuels. High fuel taxes may provide a strong incentive for consumers to purchase lighter, smaller, more fuel-efficient cars, or to not drive. On average, today's cars are about 75 percent recyclable, and using recycled steel helps reduce energy use and pollution. In the United States Congress, federally mandated fuel efficiency standards have been debated regularly, passenger car standards have not risen above the [...] standard set in 1985. Light truck standards have changed more frequently, and were set at [...] in 2007.|$|E

2500|$|There {{are many}} <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>fuel</b> cells, {{but they all}} consist of an anode, a cathode, and an {{electrolyte}} that allows positively charged hydrogen ions (protons) to move {{between the two sides}} of the fuel cell. At the anode a catalyst causes the fuel to undergo oxidation reactions that generate protons (positively charged hydrogen ions) and electrons. The protons flow from the anode to the cathode through the electrolyte after the reaction. At the same time, electrons are drawn from the anode to the cathode through an external circuit, producing direct current electricity. At the cathode, another catalyst causes hydrogen ions, electrons, and oxygen to react, forming water. Fuel cells are classified by the type of electrolyte they use and by the difference in startup time ranging from 1 second for proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEM fuel cells, or PEMFC) to 10 minutes for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC). Individual fuel cells produce relatively small electrical potentials, about 0.7 volts, so cells are [...] "stacked", or placed in series, to create sufficient voltage to meet an application's requirements. In addition to electricity, fuel cells produce water, heat and, depending on the fuel source, very small amounts of nitrogen dioxide and other emissions. The energy efficiency of a fuel cell is generally between 40–60%; however, if waste heat is captured in a cogeneration scheme, efficiencies up to 85% can be obtained.|$|E
