5|$|Almost simultaneously, an {{explosion}} devastated the north {{wing of the}} Bath Consolidated School building, killing 36 schoolchildren and two teachers. Kehoe had used a timed detonator to ignite hundreds of pounds of dynamite and incendiary pyrotol, which he had secretly planted inside the school {{over the course of}} many months. As rescuers began working at the school, Kehoe drove up, stopped, and used a rifle <b>to</b> <b>detonate</b> dynamite inside his shrapnel-filled truck, killing himself, the school superintendent, and several others nearby, as well as injuring more bystanders. During rescue efforts at the school, searchers discovered an additional 500pounds (230kg) of unexploded dynamite and pyrotol connected to a timing device set <b>to</b> <b>detonate</b> {{at the same time as}} the first explosions; the material was hidden throughout the basement of the south wing. Kehoe had apparently intended to blow up and destroy the entire school.|$|E
5|$|Before the Agency {{can pursue}} Rhoemer, he assaults Washington, D.C. and threatens <b>to</b> <b>detonate</b> viral bombs {{scattered}} across the city.

5|$|Attacks {{against the}} Han River pontoon bridges at Seoul {{do not seem}} to have been {{successful}} until FEAF ordered the Bomber Command to lay delayed action bombs alongside the bridges on August 27, set <b>to</b> <b>detonate</b> at night. This method of attack seems to have caused such heavy casualties among the North Korean labor force trying to keep the pontoons in repair that they finally abandoned the effort. These bridges remained unfinished when the UN forces recaptured Seoul later in the year.|$|E

50|$|The Mark 8 was {{an early}} earth-penetrating bomb (see nuclear bunker buster), {{intended}} to dig into the earth some distance prior <b>to</b> <b>detonating.</b> According <b>to</b> one government source, the Mark 8 could penetrate 22 ft of reinforced concrete, 90 ft of hard sand, 120 ft feet of clay, or 5 in of hardened armor-plate steel.|$|R
50|$|A nuclear bunker buster negates {{most of the}} {{countermeasures}} {{involved in}} the protection of underground bunkers by penetrating the defenses prior <b>to</b> <b>detonating.</b> A relatively low yield {{may be able to}} produce seismic forces beyond those of an air burst or even ground burst of a weapon with twice its yield. Additionally, the weapon has the ability to impart more severe horizontal shock waves than many bunker systems are designed <b>to</b> combat by <b>detonating</b> at or near the bunker's depth, rather than above it.|$|R

5|$|About 20 {{minutes before}} the plane landed, on its final descent, he {{secretly}} ignited a small explosive device consisting of a mix of plastic explosive powder and acid. Abdulmutallab apparently had a packet of the plastic explosive sewn to his underwear, and injected liquid acid from a syringe into the packet to cause a chemical reaction. While {{there was a small}} explosion and fire, the device failed <b>to</b> <b>detonate</b> properly. Passengers heard popping noises resembling firecrackers, smelled an odor, and saw the suspect's pants, leg and the wall of the plane on fire.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of the project's conception, {{newspapers}} were reporting a rumor that the Soviet Union was planning <b>to</b> <b>detonate</b> a hydrogen bomb on the Moon. According to press reports in late 1957, an anonymous source had divulged to a United States Secret Service agent that the Soviets planned to commemorate the anniversary of the October Revolution by causing a nuclear explosion on the Moon to coincide with a lunar eclipse on 7 November. News reports of the rumored launch included mention of targeting {{the dark side of the}} terminator—Project A119 would also consider this boundary as the target for an explosion. It was also reported that a failure to hit the Moon would likely result in the missile returning to Earth.|$|E

5|$|During the {{bombardment}} of 19 February, Gaulois bombarded Turkish forts covering {{the mouth of}} the Dardanelles, although Charlemagne did not participate that day. During the day's action, the ship was hit twice, but was only lightly damaged. The two ships traded positions during {{the bombardment}} of 25 February, although Charlemagne was not damaged. On 2 March, the French squadron bombarded targets in the Gulf of Saros, {{at the base of the}} Gallipoli Peninsula. Five days later, the French squadron attempted to suppress the Turkish guns while British battleships bombarded the fortifications. Gaulois was hit by one shell during this attack that failed <b>to</b> <b>detonate.</b> Admiral Guépratte and his squadron returned to the Gulf of Saros on 11 March where they again bombarded Turkish fortifications.|$|E
5|$|From late 1987, the British {{authorities}} {{were aware that}} the IRA was planning <b>to</b> <b>detonate</b> a bomb at {{the changing of the}} guard ceremony outside the governor's residence in the British Dependent Territory of Gibraltar.

40|$|Decreasing the {{magnetic}} field signature of a naval vessel will reduce its susceptibility <b>to</b> <b>detonating</b> naval influence mines and {{the probability of a}} submarine being detected by underwater barriers and maritime patrol aircraft. Both passive and active techniques for reducing {{the magnetic}} signatures produced by a vessel's ferromagnetism, roll-induced eddy currents, corrosion-related sources, and stray fields are presented. Mathematical models of simple hull shapes are used to predict the levels of signature reduction that might be achieved through the use of alternate construction materials. A...|$|R
5000|$|The {{first known}} suicide bomber was Russian. [...] The {{invention}} of dynamite in the 1860s presented revolutionary and terrorist groups in Europe {{with a weapon}} nearly twenty times more powerful than gunpowder, but with technical challenges <b>to</b> <b>detonating</b> it at the right time. One way around that obstacle was to use a human trigger, {{and this was the}} technique that assassinated Tsar Alexander II of Russia in 1881. A would-be suicide-bomber killed Vyacheslav von Plehve, the Russian Minister of the Interior, in St Petersburg in 1904.|$|R
5|$|Goeben {{returned}} fire shortly afterwards and hit Evstafi in {{the middle}} funnel; the shell detonated after it passed through the funnel and destroyed the antenna for the fire-control radio, which meant that Evstafi could not correct Ioann Zlatousts inaccurate range data. Goeben hit Evstafi four more times. although one shell failed <b>to</b> <b>detonate,</b> before Rear Admiral Wilhelm Souchon decided to turn away and break contact after fourteen minutes of combat. Evstafi suffered 34 killed and 24 wounded from those hits. Evstafi only fired between 12 and 16 12-inch shells as well as 14 eight-inch and 19 six-inch shells.|$|E
5|$|In 1944 {{he moved}} to the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos Laboratory in New Mexico, where he worked with George Kistiakowsky on the {{development}} of explosive lenses required <b>to</b> <b>detonate</b> the implosion-type nuclear weapon. Morrison transported the core of the Trinity test device to the test site {{in the back seat of}} a Dodge sedan. As leader of Project Alberta's pit crew he helped load the atomic bombs on board the aircraft that participated in the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. After the war ended, he traveled to Hiroshima as part of the Manhattan Project's mission to assess the damage.|$|E
