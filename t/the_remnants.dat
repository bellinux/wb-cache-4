40|$|The ALP {{grant was}} used to support our {{analysis}} of the RXTE, ASCA, and ROSAT data for <b>the</b> supernova <b>remnant</b> RX J 1713. 7 - 3946 and to publicize the results of <b>the</b> analysis. This <b>remnant</b> {{is one of only}} two whose X-ray emission is dominated by non-thermal emission and that have been detected at Texas energies. Previous X-ray studies failed to find evidence of thermal X-ray emission. For the first time, we have found such evidence for emission from the center of <b>the</b> <b>remnant.</b> <b>The</b> results of our analysis indicate that the average density of the material into which <b>the</b> <b>remnant</b> has expanded is very low. The lack of evidence of thermal emission from the bright northwestern rim of <b>the</b> <b>remnant</b> places an extremely strong constraint on the amount of Texas emission that can be produced by the interaction of very-high energy cosmic-ray protons accelerated in <b>the</b> <b>remnant</b> with other protons in <b>the</b> <b>remnant.</b> This constraint is inconsistent with the published claim that the Texas emission from the rim is due to the decay of neutral plans produced by the collision of Texas protons with material in <b>the</b> <b>remnant.</b> We offer an alternative interpretation of the gamma-ray data which is consistent with all of the available data: the gamma-ray emission is produced by inverse Compton emission from very-high energy electrons. In summary the grant has helped us solve two mysteries about <b>the</b> <b>remnant.</b> <b>The</b> results of this analysis will be published soon in the Astrophysical Journal...|$|R

40|$|Underlying {{nearly every}} {{quantitative}} {{discussion of the}} Cygnus Loop supernova remnant is uncertainty about its distance. Here we present optical images and spectra of nebulosities around two stars whose mass-loss material appears to have interacted with <b>the</b> <b>remnant's</b> expanding shock front and thus {{can be used to}} estimate the Cygnus Loop's distance. Narrow passband images reveal a small emission-line nebula surrounding an M 4 red giant near <b>the</b> <b>remnant's</b> eastern nebula NGC 6992. Optical spectra of the nebula show it to be shock-heated with significantly higher electron densities than seen in <b>the</b> <b>remnant's</b> filaments. This along with a bow-shaped morphology suggests it is likely red giant mass-loss material shocked and accelerated by passage of the Cygnus Loop's blast wave. We also identify a B 7 V star located along <b>the</b> <b>remnant's</b> northwestern limb which also appears to have interacted with <b>the</b> <b>remnant's</b> shock wave. It lies within a small arc of nebulosity in an unusually complex region of highly curved and distorted filaments along <b>the</b> <b>remnant's</b> northern shock front suggestive of a localized disturbance of the shock front due to the B star's stellar winds. Based on the assumption that these two stars lie inside <b>the</b> <b>remnant,</b> combined with an estimated distance to a molecular cloud situated along <b>the</b> <b>remnant's</b> western limb, we propose a distance to the Cygnus Loop of 1. 0 +/- 0. 2 kpc. Although larger than several recent estimates of 500 - 800 pc, a distance ~ 1 kpc helps resolve difficulties with <b>the</b> <b>remnant's</b> postshock cosmic ray and gas pressure ratio and estimated supernova explosion energy.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{information flow}} and Page curves for tripartite systems. We prepare a tripartite system (say, A, B, and C) {{of a given}} number of states and calculate information and entropy contents by assuming random states. Initially, every particle was in A (this means a black hole), and as time goes on, particles move to either B (means Hawking radiation) or C (means a broadly defined remnant, including a non-local transport of information, the last burst, an interior large volume, or a bubble universe, etc.). If the final number of states of <b>the</b> <b>remnant</b> is smaller than that of Hawking radiation, then information will be stored by both of the radiation and the mutual information between the radiation and <b>the</b> <b>remnant,</b> while <b>the</b> <b>remnant</b> itself does not contain information. On the other hand, if the final number of states of <b>the</b> <b>remnant</b> is {{greater than that of}} Hawking radiation, then the radiation contains negligible information, while <b>the</b> <b>remnant</b> and <b>the</b> mutual information between the radiation and <b>the</b> <b>remnant</b> contain information. Unless the number of states of <b>the</b> <b>remnant</b> is large enough compared to the entropy of the black hole, Hawking radiation must contain information; and we meet the menace of black hole complementarity again.

40|$|AbstractIntroductionObjective and {{quantitative}} intraoperative methods of bowel viability assessment could decrease {{the risk of}} postoperative ischemic complications in gastrointestinal surgery. Because <b>the</b> <b>remnant</b> stomach and <b>the</b> pancreas share an arterial blood supply, it is often unclear whether <b>the</b> <b>remnant</b> stomach can be safely preserved when performing pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) or distal pancreatectomy (DP) post gastrectomy. We herein report two cases in which <b>the</b> <b>remnant</b> stomach was safely preserved using near-infrared spectroscopy to assess the regional saturation of oxygen (rSO 2) in <b>the</b> <b>remnant</b> stomach during operation. Presentation of caseThe first patient, a 68 -year-old man, {{was diagnosed with cancer}} of the pancreatic head and underwent PD a year after proximal gastrectomy for gastric cancer. <b>The</b> <b>remnant</b> stomach was safely preserved by evaluation of the rSO 2 before and after reconstruction of the arteries. The second patient, an 82 -year-old woman with a history of distal gastrectomy for gastric cancer 40 years previously, was diagnosed with a main duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm of the pancreatic body, requiring DP. As in the previous case, we could safely preserve <b>the</b> <b>remnant</b> stomach through assessing the intraoperative rSO 2 of <b>the</b> <b>remnant</b> stomach. DiscussionThrough comparing changes in the rSO 2 during surgery, near-infrared spectroscopy provides objective {{and quantitative}} assessments of intestinal viability to predict ischemic complications.
