50|$|Most modern cars {{include a}} <b>trip</b> <b>meter</b> (trip odometer). Unlike the odometer, a <b>trip</b> <b>meter</b> is reset {{at any point}} in a journey, making it {{possible}} to record the distance traveled in any particular journey or part of a journey. It was traditionally a purely mechanical device but, in most modern vehicles, it is now electronic. Luxury vehicles often have multiple trip meters. Most trip meters will show a maximum value of 999.9. The <b>trip</b> <b>meter</b> may be used to record the distance traveled on each tank of fuel, making it very easy to accurately track the energy efficiency of the vehicle; another common use is resetting it to zero at each instruction in a sequence of driving directions, to be sure when one has arrived at the next turn.|$|E

50|$|In 1903 Arthur P. and Charles H. Warner, two {{brothers}} from Beloit, Wisconsin, introduced their patented Auto-meter. The Auto-Meter used a magnet {{attached to a}} rotating shaft to induce a magnetic pull upon a thin metal disk. Measuring this pull provided accurate measurements of both distance and speed information to automobile drivers in a single instrument. The Warners sold their company in 1912 to the Stewart & Clark Company of Chicago. The new firm was renamed the Stewart-Warner Corporation. By 1925, Stewart-Warner odometers and <b>trip</b> <b>meters</b> were standard equipment on {{the vast majority of}} automobiles and motorcycles manufactured in the United States.|$|R

40|$|Thousands of taxis cruise a {{metropolitan}} road network looking for passengers {{that may be}} scattered or clustered in highly active locations. Taxicab drivers tend to gravitate to the known clusters, often leading to supply and demand disequilibrium as areas become under or over served.

This paper presents the Service Disequilibrium Detection (SDD) framework which aims at identifying regions of service disequilibrium using this information.

For 2009, Kawasaki released an updated Ninja 650R which includes new bodywork, mirrors, gauges, lighting, and a new tune on the same [...] engine. Along with chassis and minor tweaks, an all-new bodywork design {{was introduced to the}} 2012 Ninja 650 and ER-6n along with a new 2-piece seat assembly, 20mm wider handlebars, and a new tachometer above an LCD display that shows speed, <b>trip</b> <b>meters,</b> fuel consumption and etc. The new Ninja 650 also comes equipped with an ECO Mode indicator when the bike is consuming low amounts of fuel. For 2017 Kawasaki has updated the Ninja 650 with a new frame trellis style adding to the new lighter weight and better handling. With new sharper styling it has done away with the distinctive side mount rear shock for a more conventional one, it has also added a slipper clutch.|$|R

40|$|This article {{proposes a}} method to quantitatively measure the {{resilience}} of transportation systems using GPS data from taxis. The granularity of the GPS data necessary for this analysis is relatively coarse; it only requires coordinates for {{the beginning and end}} of <b>trips,</b> the <b>metered</b> distance, and the total travel time. The method works by computing the historical distribution of pace (normalized travel times) between various regions of a city and measuring the pace deviations during an unusual event. This method is applied to a dataset of nearly 700 million taxi trips in New York City, which is used to analyze the transportation infrastructure resilience to Hurricane Sandy. The analysis indicates that Hurricane Sandy impacted traffic conditions for more than five days, and caused a peak delay of two minutes per mile. Practically, it identifies that the evacuation caused only minor disruptions, but significant delays were encountered during the post-disaster reentry process. Since the implementation of this method is very efficient, it could potentially be used as an online monitoring tool, representing a first step toward quantifying city scale resilience with coarse GPS data.

40|$|JTLU vol. 6 no. 3. pp. 43 - 59 (2013) Pedestrian travel {{data are}} {{critical}} for measuring and analyzing sustainable transportation systems. However, traditional household travel surveys and analysis methods often ignore secondary modes, such as walking from a street parking space to a store entrance or walking from a bus stop to home. New {{data collection and analysis}} techniques are needed, especially in areas where walking is common. This paper describes an intercept survey methodology used to measure retail pharmacy customer travel to, from, and within 20 shopping districts in the San Francisco Bay Area. Of the 1003 respondents, 959 (96 percent) reported all modes of travel used from leaving home until returning home, including secondary modes. Walking was the primary travel mode on 21 percent of respondent tours, but an analysis of secondary modes found that 52 percent of tours included some walking. Pedestrian travel was particularly common within shopping districts, accounting for 65 percent of all <b>trips</b> within 804 <b>meters</b> (0. 5 miles) of survey stores. Detailed walking path data from the survey showed that respondents in denser, more mixed-use shopping districts tended to walk along the main commercial street as well as other streets connecting to the core shopping area, while respondent pedestrian movements in automobile-oriented shopping districts tended to be contained within specific shopping complexes...|$|R
40|$|Annexes {{end of the}} chapterWith {{the heavy}} use of {{sophisticated}} equipment several problems arise related to electricity, within the user's premises and to the nearby users and to the utility. People tend to use the equipment, which save time, reduce labor and increase productivity of the office/industrial environment. Those equipment such as fax machine, photocopiers, printers, computers, CFLs, VSDs etc. comprises with electronic circuits, which consume harmonics. When Harmonics are injected to the system several problems such as frequent breaker <b>tripping,</b> Error in <b>meter</b> readings, mal operation of relays, capacitor bank blasting, Telephone interference, overheating of conductors and transformers, over loading of neutral conductor, higher losses in conductors and transformers etc. can happen. Harmonic currents generated by modem office/industrial equipment cause power system heating and add to user power bills. The {{aim of this study}} was to analyze the harmonic related losses in several electrical systems and quantify its energy usage in cost wise. How site selection was done, the type of equipment used to gather data and the process of data analysis which are the key elements which this study is based upon are described in separate chapters. The analysis shows that building-wiring losses related to powering non-linear electronic load equipment might be more than double the losses for linear load equipment. Current related power losses such as 12 R, Skin Effect of conductors, Proximity Effect of Conductors are considered. A special emphasis is made upon the underlined theories, which the study is based upon which includes defining harmonics, generating sources, theirs adverse impacts, adopted methods of measuring or identifying, other methods of eliminating etc. i...|$|R

5000|$|Fuel gauges are {{becoming}} more common, but traditionally a reserve tank arrangement is used with a petcock (petrol tap) {{on the side of}} the motorcycle allowing the rider to switch to a reserve fuel supply when the main fuel supply is exhausted. There is not actually a separate reserve tank: The intake for the petcock has two pipes, one extending higher into the fuel tank than the other. When fuel no longer covers the longer pipe the engine will lose power/splutter and the rider switches the petcock to the [...] "reserve" [...] setting, which accesses the shorter pipe. Riders whose bikes lack a fuel gauge (most machines prior to the past few years) usually learn how far they can go with a full tank of fuel, and then use a <b>trip</b> <b>meter</b> if available to judge when they must refill the tank.|$|E
