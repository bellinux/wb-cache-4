40|$|ABSTRACT DETERMINING THE PRIORITY DAM IN CISANGGARUNG WATERSHED In a {{study of}} Cisanggarung river basin {{development}} project has identified 15 potential dams. In according {{to the number of}} potential dam are identified, the limited funds, the difference of conditions, the variety needs of society and government, and the importance of water resources development in Cisanggarung watershed through the dam construction, so this research aimed to determine the priority dam in Cisanggarung watershed. The method used in this research is descriptive evaluative. The method used to determine the priority in this study is AHP (Analytical Hierarchy Process) and Weighted Average. Parameter that used to determine the priority in this study consist of <b>technical</b> <b>aspect</b> and non <b>technical</b> <b>aspect.</b> <b>Technical</b> <b>aspect</b> consist of topography, geology, hydrology and flood area. Non <b>technical</b> <b>aspect</b> consist of social, accesibility, cost and benefit. Based on this research, we can conclude that: 1) the results of AHP analysis showed that the geological foundation aspects, regarded as the most important <b>technical</b> <b>aspect</b> in determining the priority of the dam, 2) the results of AHP analysis showed that the accessibility aspect of the dam location, regarded as the most important non <b>technical</b> <b>aspect</b> in determining the priority of the dam, 3) the results of this research showed that based on calculations using the method of AHP and Weighted Average, the most prioritized dam is Cihirup. The dam is feasible priority because of both technical and non technical is included in good condition, 4) the results of this research showed that AHP method is more detail than Weighted Average method, because the result of AHP method is closer to the conditions of each dam in the field...|$|R

In some developing countries, shortwave listening enables remote communities to obtain regional programming traditionally provided by local medium wave AM broadcasters.

5|$|The {{growth in}} {{computer}} crime during the 1980s and 1990s caused {{law enforcement agencies}} to begin establishing specialized groups, usually at the national level, to handle the <b>technical</b> <b>aspects</b> of investigations. For example, in 1984 the FBI launched a Computer Analysis and Response Team and the following year a computer crime department was set up within the British Metropolitan Police fraud squad. As well as being law enforcement professionals, many of the early members of these groups were also computer hobbyists and became responsible for the field's initial research and direction.|$|E

5|$|Alan Brigman was the {{technical}} director and co-producer. He and Mike Woodroffe developed a game creation system, Adventure Graphic Operating System (AGOS) II, which facilitated {{the development of}} Simon the Sorcerer and enabled the team {{to focus on the}} gameplay and story without worrying about the <b>technical</b> <b>aspects.</b> The system allowed the developers to input text commands on a separate monitor, and the engine could be ported to other platforms. Other features of the engine included translating actions performed by the mouse into text commands (a sentence parser carries them out), the loading of data as-needed, and functions could be implemented by the simple addition of commands. The game was built as a database, which contained tables for rooms and objects. These tables contained animation code and information about what is supposed to happen. Alan Cox was also involved {{in the development of the}} AGOS engine, which is based on AberMUD.|$|E

5|$|In his youth, Dugan {{was fascinated}} by the <b>technical</b> <b>aspects</b> of theatre. He worked as a {{lighting}} designer then transitioned to sound design in 1967. Dugan became interested in achieving the automatic adjustment of sound controls after a frustrating experience staging the musical Hair. His first automixer design was not fully practical but his second design was successful; it used a reference derived from a total of all of its microphone signals. Dugan devised a third improvement which helped prevent audio feedback in the presence of sound reinforcement loudspeakers. Dugan next produced an automixer design that could be inserted into an existing mixing console. This proved popular for broadcast and live sound applications. Each of Dugan's subsequent automixer models has been of the insertable type.|$|E

5|$|The {{development}} project became controversial as environmental protection non-governmental organizations (NGOs) drew public {{attention to a}} possible threat that may arise to seven species of bats. Subsequently, the NGOs alleged that the project is illegal, environmentally unsafe, financially not feasible, and technically questionable. Project legality was disputed because {{it is based on}} a 1999 environmental impact assessment (EIA), while Croatian legislation requires that EIAs must not be more than two years old. Flooding of Vilina Cave is cited as an environmental concern, while the financial issues are based on previous cost overruns by Hrvatska elektroprivreda—the state-owned company planning the development—in other projects. One objection to the <b>technical</b> <b>aspects</b> of the project is the possibility that the groundwater may trigger earthquakes. Opponents of the project have urged the Prime Minister of Croatia to cancel development of the plant.|$|E
