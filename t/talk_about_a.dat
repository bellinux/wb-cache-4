5|$|A URN is a URI that {{identifies}} a resource by {{name in a}} particular namespace. A URN {{may be used to}} <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> resource without implying its location or how to access it. For example, in the International Standard Book Number (ISBN) system, ISBN 0-486-27557-4 identifies a specific edition of Shakespeare's play Romeo and Juliet. The URN for that edition would be urn:isbn:0-486-27557-4. To gain access to the book, its location is needed, for which a URL would have to be specified.|$|E
5|$|After the Square Enix merger, {{however, the}} {{individual}} teams still continued to program and customize their own tools for each game, which would eventually {{go to waste}} as only their respective creators {{knew how to use}} them. With the amount of assets and tools required by the in-development Final Fantasy XII and the impending advent of the seventh console generation, a common data format for the company was proposed in 2004. It was to be developed in-house and replace general-purpose formats such as FBX and COLLADA. Realizing the goal of an engine with a common set of tools proved to be difficult, as many production teams wanted to further their own interests rather than those of the company as a whole. Select staff members from different company divisions teamed up to work on the project on a voluntary basis, but their loose organizational structure failed to yield results. Nevertheless, Murata considered this group effort a first step in the right direction. In 2005, he was appointed general manager of the newly formed Technology Division. Although this enabled Murata and his subordinates to <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> company-wide engine more extensively, the lack of manpower again prevented any significant achievements.|$|E

With {{reference}} to Kushida. s (2006) procedures in the opening of “personal matters talk”, in this paper I will present the following six ways of openings: <b>a)</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> new “personal matter” when inserting reason description/explanation, b) <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> common experience as an example, c) emphasizing a contrasting experience as an example, d) creating <b>an</b> opportunity to <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> one. s own experience, e) <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> “personal matter” as a topic change, f) <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> “personal matter” as a response. Moreover, I will analyze the frequency of “Watashi ha” and “Watashi φ” in each of the openings. The ﬁndings showed that “Watashi φ” can be used in most of the cases. However, in the case of c) emphasizing a contrasting experience as an example and f) <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> “personal matter” as a response, the use of “Watashi ha” is preferred...|$|R

SEM is able to route correct responses to the right team, member, or customer-experience channel to ensure the best customer service. The analysis helps vendors to understand what is important to customers. It identifies trends, spikes, and anomalies to make real-time course corrections. It also can identify brand advocates. The SEM cloud identifies customer intention and interests by analyzing the common ways customers <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> product or a service.|$|E
25|$|Ebenezer Howard's urban {{planning}} concepts were only adopted {{on a large}} scale after World War II. The damage brought on by the war provoked significant public interest in what post-war Britain would be like, which was encouraged by the government, who facilitated <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> ‘Better Britain’ to boost morale. Post-war rebuilding initiatives saw new plans drafted for London, which, for the first time, addressed the issue of de-centralisation. Firstly, the County of London Plan 1943 recognised that displacement of population and employment was necessary if the city was to be rebuilt at a desirable density. Moreover, the Greater London Plan of 1944 went further by suggesting that over one million people would need to be displaced into a mixture of satellite suburbs, existing rural towns, and new towns.|$|E

25|$|The Co-op {{refinery}} was {{a product}} of the Co-operative movement, which began in Britain in the mid-19th century. Frequently expanded and modernized, the Co-op plant (first constructed in 1935) was a small but modern refinery when <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> refinery/upgrader complex began in the early 1980s. Both the federal and Saskatchewan governments had forbidden their Crown corporations to participate in the project, yet both took part themselves. The province had a particular interest, since an upgrader would increase the market for heavy oil from Saskatchewan's fields. This would give the provincial oil industry an important boost. The federal government saw the project as an opportunity to move the nation one small step towards the stated goal of crude oil self-sufficiency. For its part, the Co-op wanted an assured supply of crude oil for its refinery.|$|E
25|$|One {{analogy is}} to think of helium-4 as ash, {{and the amount of}} ash that one forms when one {{completely}} burns a piece of wood is insensitive to how one burns it. The resort to the BBN theory of the helium-4 abundance is necessary as there is far more helium-4 in the universe than can be explained by stellar nucleosynthesis. In addition, it provides an important test for the Big Bang theory. If the observed helium abundance is significantly different from 25%, then this would pose a serious challenge to the theory. This would particularly be the case if the early helium-4 abundance was much smaller than 25% because it is hard to destroy helium-4. For a few years during the mid-1990s, observations suggested that this might be the case, causing astrophysicists to <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> Big Bang nucleosynthetic crisis, but further observations were consistent with the Big Bang theory.|$|E
25|$|The {{success of}} a new racino at Aqueduct Racetrack led to a {{proposal}} from Governor Andrew Cuomo to build a massive convention center in the vicinity.

Goldfeder commented “The commute for people here {{is only going to}} go from bad to worse. You can’t <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> convention center without talking about transportation.” Goldfeder and Miller said they are not opposed to turning sections of the line into a park named Queensway, but said people who live in Rockaway, Ozone Park, Howard Beach, and other areas along the right-of-way have no quick or easy way to get into Manhattan. The Genting Group, which operates the racino and has been asked to construct the convention center, was evaluating several plans to increase transportation access, and was committed to paying for part of the transportation improvements. Queensway advocates are against resumption of rail service, stating that current bus service fills current transportation needs in the area.|$|E

25|$|The Romanian popular costume {{finds its}} roots in the part of Thracian, Dacian and Getae {{ancestors}} and resembles with that of the peoples of the Balkan Peninsula, of course with differences consisting of decorative and colorful details. Between 7000 and 3500 BC was founded the belief in the one controlling power of the cosmos. Fabrics wore symbols appointed by virtue of faith, thus spinning and weaving became sacred. Therefore, were customary on the dresses the solar circle, the column of the sky, the rhomb, the hatch or the curved lines. Since 3500 BC and until year zero has passed from the sacred weaving to the vestment, the ritual reaching from the imposing space of the temple to the household hearth. The purpose of the garments worn by the ancestors was to facilitate dialogue with the unseen forces of the cosmos. Thus, it is still possible to <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> civilization of sacred fabrics. For example, the thread of spun is column-shaped and spirally twisted, which increases the sacredness of the fabric. Also, having different colors is the most useful means for expressing feelings and behaviors. Popular clothes Carpatho-Danubian territory summarizes existential and spiritual dimension of Romanians, but component parts of clothes multiplied and the clothing became a costume. As a result, the autochthonous popular garment is a system of which developed the regional variations, through innovations and contaminations caused by each creator against the prototype schema.|$|E
