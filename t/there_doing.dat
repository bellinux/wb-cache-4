The fact that the first three went to Princeton helped induce Berg to enroll. Berg spent his college years at Princeton, the college Wilson was {{president}} of, graduating in 1971. He also taught a class in biography writing while <b>there</b> <b>doing</b> research for the book.|$|E

[...] There was further difficulties in production as Zicree also hired a professional assistant director, but he walked off set during a night shoot early in the production and did not return.

500|$|The 1924 Rose Bowl was {{the first}} meeting between Navy and Washington, and {{was the first}} bowl game that either team participated in. The {{competitors}} were announced on November 30, 1923, and the teams arrived for the bowl in mid-December, holding practices until the evening before the game. Heavy rain fell the night before the competition; Bagshaw said, [...] "Wet weather will not bother us", and Folwell said, [...] "My men will know what to do in the mud and will be <b>there</b> <b>doing</b> it". However, because of the wet conditions, several football critics predicted that Washington would have a slight advantage in the game due to their larger size. It was estimated that 52,000 people would attend the game. For the first time, the participating teams were responsible for ticket sales, and as a result only 40,000 people actually attended; a large number of tickets were sold to a navy fleet which was called to service on December 31, the day before the game. The competition was the first Rose Bowl to be broadcast on radio, and was aired by a local Pasadena station.|$|E
500|$|Bible Student Alexander H. Macmillan, {{who served}} as an aide to the {{executive}} committee, later wrote that tensions at the Watch Tower Society headquarters mounted as the day for election of the Society's officers approached. He wrote: [...] "A few ambitious ones at headquarters were holding caucuses here and <b>there,</b> <b>doing</b> a little electioneering to get their men in. However, Van Amburgh and I held {{a large number of}} votes. Many shareholders, knowing of our long association with Russell, sent their proxies to us to be cast for the one whom we thought best fitted for office." [...] Macmillan, who claimed he had declined an offer from an ailing Russell months earlier to accept the position of president after his death, agreed with Van Amburgh that Rutherford was the best candidate. According to Macmillan, [...] "Rutherford did not know what was going on. He certainly didn't do any electioneering or canvassing for votes, but I guess he was doing some worrying, knowing if he was elected he would have a big job on his hands ... There is no doubt in our minds that the Lord's will was done in this choice. It is certain that Rutherford himself {{had nothing to do with}} it." ...|$|E

500|$|While Carey paved {{a lot of}} {{the album}} with slower and autobiographical ballads, she also {{attempted}} at making an album with a mixture of several different genres. According to Jon Pareles of The New York Times, the album showed off Carey's musical and vocal versatility, especially when viewing the differences in the record's first and second singles, [...] "Ms. Carey is known for her voice, of course: she can hit high notes that barely sound human, and few singers leap around the octaves as gracefully as she does. But as she tries to regain her audience, her greatest weapon may be her versatility: Ms. Carey also knows how to make a hip-hop hit by holding back and letting the beat shine." [...] Carey decided to work with Just Blaze after she heard the song [...] "Oh Boy" [...] he had produced for Cam'ron. Together they produced [...] "Boy (I Need You)", a remake of [...] "Oh Boy", and [...] "You Got Me". Carey described the former as one of her favorites on the album. [...] "It's definitely one of my favorites, 'cause I love the original. It was cool to have him out <b>there</b> <b>doing</b> his thing in such a random environment," [...] she said.

[...] Crime reporter Art Harris suggests that such questions are not designed to elicit real answers: [...] "Usually you get no response.

2500|$|In 2004, Jackson {{released}} her eighth studio album, Damita Jo. The album debuted at number two on Billboard 200, was certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), and sold over three million copies worldwide. However, its singles received minimal airplay {{due to a}} blacklist of Jackson's music and videos on many music channels and radio formats caused by legalities surrounding the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy. Jackson then decided to start {{to work on a}} new project in the coming year, involving her then-fiancé, record producer Jermaine Dupri, who was commissioned to executive produce the project, in addition to a number of other producers. She decided to create a modern record, while returning to dance music, in the vein of her hit album, Control (1986). Producer Jimmy Jam revealed that while recording the album, Janet became more confident with her writing ability, doing the bulk of the writing. He also commented, [...] "We're all kind of back in <b>there</b> <b>doing</b> it again together, which I really enjoy." [...] It's the physical nature of sitting in the same room and really hashing it out. It's like, 'You're not going to leave until we have a lyric,' so it's fun." [...] Jackson and Jimmy both agreed that Dupri molded well into their tri due to him being a fan of Jam and Lewis' work and vice versa.|$|E
