EU was working to deregulate the airline market from 1995, which could cause problems for the Scandinavian agreements. In preparation for this, Braathens SAFE started negotiations with Linjeflyg of Sweden and Maersk Air of Denmark <b>to</b> <b>crate</b> an alliance to compete with SAS. In particular, the three airlines wanted to capture the two million passengers that travelled between the three Scandinavian capitals: Oslo, Copenhagen and Stockholm. Instead, SAS was given permission to purchase Linjeflyg in exchange for the Swedish airline market being deregulated from 1 July 1992. From 23 October 1992, the Norwegian Armed Forces stopped chartering aircraft and started using scheduled flights to fly 240,000 personnel annually. Since most of the transport was between Northern and Southern Norway, this gave reduced revenue for Braathens SAFE.|$|E

BKH observed the sales trends and market acceptance of the products for several months after the introduction for the possible purpose of extending the concept in other markets. While the concept was tailored for the New Zealand market, TPF executives stated {{that it would be}} easy to adapt the concept to other regions. Some restaurant industry observers agreed with the TPF assessment of the products and separately stated other sauces and ingredients could be used <b>to</b> <b>crate</b> variations in the US and other markets. Eventually, the sandwiches were discontinued, with the Sweet Ride and Mango Jammin burgers the first to be removed from the menu.|$|E

[...] And so by force they dragged him to the King. [...] And then he taught the King to charm the Queen [...] In such-wise, that no man could see her more, [...] Nor saw she save the King, who wrought the charm, [...] Coming and going, and she lay as dead, [...] And lost all use of life: but when the King [...] Made proffer of the league of golden mines, [...] The province with a hundred miles of coast, [...] The palace and the princess, that old man [...] Went back to his old wild, and lived on grass, [...] And vanished, and his book came down to me.' ...|$|E

5000|$|Crates made {{a strong}} {{distinction}} between criticism and grammar, the latter of which he regarded as subordinate to the former. A critic, according <b>to</b> <b>Crates,</b> should investigate everything which could throw light upon literature; the grammarian was only to apply the rules of language to clear up the meaning of particular passages, and to settle the text, prosody, accentuation, etc. From this part of his system, Crates derived the surname of Kritikos.|$|R
