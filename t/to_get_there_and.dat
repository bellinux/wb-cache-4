500|$|Regarding her {{approach}} to acting, Moore {{said in a}} 2002 interview that she leaves 95 percent of the performance to be discovered on set: [...] "I {{want to have a}} sense of who a character is, and then I want <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> have it happen to me on camera." [...] The aim, she said, is to [...] "try to get yourself in a position to let the emotion [...] to you, that you don't bring the emotion to it... and when it happens, there's nothing better or more exciting or more rewarding." ...|$|E
500|$|Executive {{producer}} J. H. Wyman later indicated how [...] "White Tulip" [...] {{helped with}} {{the evolution of the}} show in an interview: [...] "It's very important to constantly try to attract more viewers and to try and not make the show alienating... Our solution {{came in the form of}} ‘White Tulip' and episodes like that, because we realized what we need to do to satiate both our hardcore fans and our financial responsibility is to create a term that we coined a 'mythalone.' It sounds really simple when you say it now, like, ‘Yes, sure, you have a great standalone case, plus you thread in some great mythology.' But I've got to tell you it took us a long time <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> realize it. Now we have that our template for telling stories that we think satisfies both parties". He and Pinkner later listed [...] "White Tulip" [...] as one of their favorite episodes.|$|E
500|$|In {{a review}} in the online {{speculative}} fiction magazine Strange Horizons, Tony Keen was critical of Bear's novel, saying that {{the present and future}} passages [...] "do not mesh terribly well", and that it is [...] "too long" [...] with [...] "too many ideas". He complained that the book was difficult to follow and that Bear keeps [...] "moving the goalposts as it suits his narrative". Keen said that for a science fiction novel, he was surprised at its [...] "lack of consistency", and called it more a work of fantasy than science fiction. He said the [...] "revelations" [...] at the end still did not help explain what had happened, but that [...] "by this point, it was for me hard to care". A {{review in the}} Oakland Tribune complained that Bear, who it felt is not strong on [...] "crafting memorable characters", [...] "struggles" [...] with the novel's multiple viewpoints. The review added that while he [...] "takes a long time <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> arrives with a palpable scent of anticlimax, [...] does deliver at the end", although with not enough to satisfy the reviewer.|$|E
5000|$|Seeing the US {{stock market}} boomed and then busted in 2001 {{and how the}} capital markets {{affected}} everyone, it made her realised [...] "the big world outside and she wanted <b>to</b> <b>get</b> out <b>there</b> <b>and</b> learn some more." ...|$|R

5000|$|To further {{describe}} the show, Parton stated: [...] "We're so excited <b>to</b> <b>get</b> out <b>there</b> <b>and</b> see the fans again. I'm {{really looking forward}} to singing songs the fans have not heard in a while, as well as the hits, while debuting a few new ones off Pure & Simple" ...|$|R
500|$|Just {{minutes after}} the game ended, Appalachian State {{students}} began celebrating on the two main streets in Boone, North Carolina: King Street and Rivers Street. The group eventually advanced to Kidd Brewer Stadium, Appalachian State's home field, and tore {{down one of the}} goalposts. The students proceeded to carry the goalpost over a mile before depositing it in the front yard of the school's chancellor, Kenneth E. Peacock. He was fine with this, saying [...] "as good as today was for Appalachian State, they can take it up there and put it down. I can't wait <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> see it." [...] Several students jumped nude into the duck pond behind ASU's dining hall, a campus tradition for celebrating big football victories. When the team returned to their stadium in buses at 11:00p.m., they were greeted by a crowd of thousands of students and fans. It took the team 20minutes to get from their buses to the locker room due to the crowd. The celebration in Boone was not limited to Appalachian State's campus; the Boone Mall was [...] "flooded" [...] with cars, and a sports apparel shop carrying ASU gear, Sports Fanatic, reported that sales were seven times higher than normal.|$|E
500|$|The young Alf Ramsey was {{described}} by his friend Fred Tibble as [...] "a very quiet boy who really loved sport". In his 1952 autobiography Talking Football, Ramsey would describe [...] "liv for the open air from the moment I could toddle", spending hours each day in the meadow behind the family cottage, playing ball games with his brothers. He learned skills such as ball control, kicking and heading with a tennis ball. From the age of five, Ramsey attended Becontree Heath School, which had a roll of about 200 pupils aged from four to 14. He and his brothers had to walk two hours from their house <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> passed a ball between {{each other on the}} way to break the monotony. Ramsey was not especially popular socially, nor particularly diligent as a student, but he excelled in sports. In addition to football, he played cricket to a high standard and represented the school in the high jump, the long jump, the 100-yard and 200-yard dash. Despite his diminutive stature, he also enjoyed boxing until an incident when he was 10 years old, when a much larger opponent—"as wide as I was tall" [...] in Ramsey's recollection—gave him a severe beating in a school tournament. Ramsey carried a noticeable scar above his mouth, a memento of this fight, {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E
500|$|Less than a {{week after}} the election, Douglas wrote to one of her {{supporters}} that she did not think there was anything her campaign could have done to change the result. Blaming the war, voter mistrust of Truman's foreign policy, and high prices at home, Douglas stated that she lost in California because Nixon was able to take {{a large part of the}} women's vote and the labor vote. Later in November, she indicated that liberals must undertake a massive effort to win in 1952. In 1956, she stated in an interview that, while Nixon had never called her a communist, he had designed his whole campaign to create the impression that she was a communist or [...] "communistic". In 1959, she wrote that she had not particularly wanted to be a senator, and in 1962 she stated that the policy of her campaign was to avoid attacks on Nixon. In her memoirs, published posthumously in 1982, she wrote, [...] "Nixon had his victory, but I had mine... He hadn't touched me. I didn't carry Richard Nixon with me, thank God." [...] She concluded her chapter on the 1950 race with, [...] "There's not much to say about the 1950 campaign except that a man ran for Senate who wanted <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> didn't care how." ...|$|E

However, the Doom Troopers (DTs), led by Dr. Kao (Tim Curry), want <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>there</b> first <b>and</b> will do anything to stop the children.

2500|$|The Scotiabank Saddledome {{was one of}} many {{buildings}} impacted by the 2013 Alberta floods. [...] The flooding of the Elbow and Bow Rivers swamped many areas of the city, including Stampede Park where the Saddledome is located. [...] The event level of the arena was reported to be filled with water up to the 10th row of seating and the dressing rooms and control room for the video replay screen were under water. At a press conference held on June 22, 2013, team president Ken King stated that the arena had flooded up to the eighth row and that the event level of the facility was a [...] "total loss." [...] He added that the team's equipment and some memorabilia had also been destroyed, but expressed confidence that the facility would be repaired and ready in time for the October start to the season. Prospect Ben Hanowski was among the 100,000 people forced to evacuate by the floods. He described the situation as [...] "almost terrifying," [...] but praised the city's community spirit in the disaster: [...] "I didn’t know how I was going to get [...] I didn’t know if I could get a rental car out of the garage and through some water to get up here, and I had a person come up to me right away and ask if I had a place to go and if I had a way <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> basically offered me a ride somewhere. I’d never met the person before. I think that example, right there, kind of speaks to what the city of Calgary is all about." ...|$|E

40|$|A {{desirable}} future critically {{depends on}} {{our ability to}} ensure the supply of key resources while simultaneously respecting planetary boundaries. This paper looks at the potential implications of living within the "safe operating space" for people, business and the economy. It develops a positive {{vision of the future}} based on three pillars: a safe and fair use of global resources, a sustainable society, and a transformed economy. We review and build on recent sustainability visions to develop a holistic reflection on what life in 2050 could look like, and explore the key changes in the economy needed <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>there.</b> In particular we show that resource efficiency requires a systemic shift in values, innovation, governance and management regimes. We present a bold vision for Europe underlined by indicators and targets, explore transition challenges <b>to</b> <b>getting</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> conclude with a list of key policies needed for overcoming challenges and reaching the vision.
