5|$|Bin Laden {{peered through}} his bedroom {{door at the}} Americans {{advancing}} up the stairs, and then retreated into the room as the lead SEAL fired a shot at him, which either missed or {{hit him in the}} side. Robert Oâ€™Neill, who later publicly identified himself as the SEAL who shot bin Laden, rolled through <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> confronted bin Laden inside the bedroom. Seymour Hersh reports that, according to his sources, bin Laden was found cowering and shot dead.|$|E
5|$|In these reports, {{there were}} said to be two weapons near bin Laden in his room, {{including}} an AKS-74U carbine and a Russian-made Makarov pistol, but according to his wife Amal, he was shot before he could reach his AKS-74U. According to the Associated Press, the guns were on a shelf next to <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> the SEALs did not see them until they were photographing the body.|$|E
5|$|Kate Farrar {{was interviewed}} by {{investigators}} on October 26. She stated that on the night she had woken up to find the fire already burning. Seeing smoke seeping into her room, she opened the bedroom door and called to her brother, then closed <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> placed the hang-up 9-1-1 call that alerted police. She then crawled out of her bedroom window to escape the fire.|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} evaluates whether lifting <b>the</b> trawl <b>doors</b> <b>and</b> sweeps from <b>the</b> seabed can reduce bycatch in shrimp trawl fisheries. We {{carried out a}} catch {{comparison}} and catch ratio analysis between two gear setups, one with <b>the</b> trawl <b>doors</b> <b>and</b> sweeps at <b>the</b> seabed (the traditional way) {{and the other with}} <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> <b>and</b> sweeps lifted. <b>The</b> study was carried out on American plaice. The results showed that when fishing with <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> <b>and</b> sweeps at <b>the</b> seabed, the gear is significantly more efficient at catching flatfish. The gear setup with <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> <b>and</b> sweeps at <b>the</b> seabed captures between 50 % and 70 % more American plaice than the gear setup with <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> <b>and</b> sweeps lifted. This difference is significant for sizes between 10 and 36 cm. Further, this efficiency is size dependent and increases with fish size. The results obtained are encouraging for the shrimp fishing industry as lifting <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> <b>and</b> sweeps from <b>the</b> seabed could help mitigate fish bycatch problems, and reduce bottom impact. Further studies are recommended to investigate if lifting <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> <b>and</b> sweeps from <b>the</b> seabed is equally efficient at reducing bycatch of other species, and if it also affects the shrimp catches...|$|R
50|$|Nine {{substances}} are explained as:Consider {{a family}} {{living in a}} house. One day, they were enjoying a fresh cool breeze coming through their open <b>doors</b> <b>and</b> windows of <b>the</b> house. However, the weather suddenly changed to a terrible dust storm. The family, realizing the storm, closed <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> <b>and</b> windows. But, {{by the time they}} could close all <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> <b>and</b> windows some of the dust had been blown into the house.

5|$|The large, maze-like mansion's {{walls were}} {{constructed}} with angles slightly askew, resulting in off-center perspectives and doors that {{open and close}} by themselves. The immense library contains the ramshackle spiral staircase from which the previous owner hanged herself; the vast conservatory is adorned with eerie statues. During their first night in the house, Eleanor and Theo are terrified by supernatural occurrences outside Theo's bedroom door. Deafening banging is heard against <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> {{the voice of a}} young girl is heard echoing with laughter. Despite the turbulence, Eleanor feels a tentative affinity to Hill House.|$|E
5|$|The {{men were}} met with jeers by a crowd of 2,000 to 4,000. This {{escalated}} into paving stones thrown through <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> windows of the building. Soldiers who subsequently arrived were beaten and driven away. Additional police were sent for in hopes of clearing the way and relieving the troops {{of the need to}} use force against the crowd, but those who arrived were unable to effect any order, and were forced to shelter in the armory along with the soldiers.|$|E
5|$|The {{next day}} at the tavern, Morrison meets Brown's wife (Agi Szirtes), and tells her that Brown is under {{suspicion}} for the theft and for the murder at the quayside. He asks for her help in finding him and repeats to her Mitchell's offer to Brown, but she remains silent. At home, Henriette tells Maloin she found a man in their hut at the seaside, and in fear locked <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> ran home. An agitated Maloin tells her not to tell anyone, and leaves for the hut. He unlocks <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> <b>and</b> receiving no response to his calling Brown's name, steps inside, closing the door behind. Minutes later he re-emerges, breathing heavily. After pausing to compose himself, he locks <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> leaves. In the next scene, Maloin presents the briefcase to Morrison in the tavern, and asks him to arrest him, confessing to having killed Brown an hour ago. Morrison leaves with Maloin for the hut, dismissing the frenzied inquiries of Brown's wife about her husband and handing the briefcase to the barkeep on the way out. Brown's wife follows the men to the hut, and emerges weeping with Morrison moments later. Back at the tavern, Morrison prepares two envelopes with {{a small portion of}} the recovered money in each. One he leaves with the grieving widow to whom he apologizes and wishes well, while the other he gives to Maloin, telling him that his case was one of self-defense. As he is preparing to leave, Morrison advises Maloin to go home and forget the whole affair. The camera focuses on the expressionless face of Brown's wife momentarily before fading to white.|$|E

Flashbacks show that John Kramer found him unconscious by the steam pipe and nursed him back to health, and Lawrence has assisted him ever since. This was known only by Jill, who delivered a package to him at the hospital, a videotape in which John asked him to watch over Jill and take action if anything happened to her. To this end, Lawrence has Hoffman brought to the disused bathroom and shackled by the ankle to a pipe. Lawrence appears, throws the hacksaw he used to sever his own foot out <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> <b>and</b> then turns off the lights and seals the door, leaving Hoffman to die.|$|E

He discussed his wife's beauty with his favourite bodyguard Gyges, but felt Gyges was lying when he told him that he agreed about her beauty. Candaules arranged, over the protests of Gyges, for Gyges to hide behind his bedroom door and secretly watch Nyssia undressing without her knowledge. Although he was unhappy at being forced to take part, Gyges reluctantly hid behind <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> watched Nyssia undress.

Epstein was found on a single bed, dressed in pyjamas, with various correspondence spread over a second single bed. At the statutory inquest his death was officially ruled an accident; caused by a gradual buildup of Carbitral in his system, combined with alcohol. It was revealed {{that he had taken}} six Carbitral pills in order to sleep, which was probably normal for him, but in combination with alcohol they reduced his tolerance to lethal levels.|$|E

She buys far more than what is requested in the letter, wanting to see the children's happiness. When Liz delivers the presents to the apartment in the letter, however, the door is answered by two adults who take the gifts, and she believes she has been tricked. Receiving no help from the US Postal Service, who run the charity, she attempts to have it shut down. This upsets Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) who refuses to believe anyone would scam a Christmas charity.

Alien 3 editor Terry Rawlings said in the 2003 special-edition DVD release of the Alien Anthology that a parallel exists between Golic and Renfield in Dracula; both are deranged lunatics, who fall under the influence of a paranormal entity which they try to appease.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, O'Connor takes Gracie back to {{his church}} and baptizes her. Suddenly, she goes into labor and gives birth to live snakes.
