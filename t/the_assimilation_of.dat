At an earlier stage (from the late 16th century), they manifested themselves in the religious Union of Brest, which split the Eastern Christians of the Commonwealth, and on the military front, in a series of Cossack uprisings.|$|E
5|$|From the mid-14th century, {{after the}} Black Death, Norman {{settlements}} in Ireland {{went into a}} period of decline. The Norman rulers and the Gaelic Irish elites intermarried and the areas under Norman rule became Gaelicised. In some parts, a hybrid Hiberno-Norman culture emerged. In response, the Irish parliament passed the Statutes of Kilkenny in 1367. These were a set of laws designed to prevent <b>the</b> <b>assimilation</b> <b>of</b> the Normans into Irish society by requiring English subjects in Ireland to speak English, follow English customs and abide by English law.|$|E

5|$|After {{the fall}} of Rome, the key {{challenge}} to the Empire was to maintain a set of relations between itself and its neighbours. When these nations set about forging formal political institutions, they often modelled themselves on Constantinople. Byzantine diplomacy soon managed to draw its neighbours into a network of international and inter-state relations. This network revolved around treaty making, and included the welcoming of the new ruler into the family of kings, and <b>the</b> <b>assimilation</b> <b>of</b> Byzantine social attitudes, values and institutions. Whereas classical writers are fond of making ethical and legal distinctions between peace and war, Byzantines regarded diplomacy {{as a form of}} war by other means. For example, a Bulgarian threat could be countered by providing money to the Kievan Rus'.|$|E
5|$|Historically, {{the largest}} {{specified}} ethnic group inhabiting this area were those identifying as Poles. Under Austrian rule, Cieszyn Silesia was initially {{divided into three}} (Bielitz, Friedek and Teschen), and later into four districts (plus Freistadt). One of them, Frýdek, had a mostly Czech population, the other three were mostly inhabited by Poles. During the 19th century the number of ethnic Germans grew. After declining {{at the end of}} the 19th century, at the beginning of the 20th century and later from 1920 to 1938 the Czech population grew significantly (mainly as a result of immigration and <b>the</b> <b>assimilation</b> <b>of</b> locals) and Poles became a minority, which they are to this day. Another significant ethnic group were the Jews, but almost the entire Jewish population was exterminated during World War II.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{the police}} focused their law {{enforcement}} efforts {{on dealing with}} the illegal consumption of alcohol, which was considered to promote violent behaviour among the First Nations. By the 1880s, however, the police also began to tackle horse theft. Horse stealing was common among the First Nations on the prairies: it formed part of intertribal competition and warfare, and the stolen horses enabled their hunting expeditions. In part the police crackdown was driven by the Department for Indian Affairs, who believed {{that the practice of}} horse theft was slowing <b>the</b> <b>assimilation</b> <b>of</b> the First Nations into broader Canadian society. The authorities were also concerned that if the First Nations were allowed to steal horses from across the border in the United States, it could provoke a military intervention into Canada.|$|E

Curtis was the original author of the 1898 Curtis Act, which dissolved the tribal governments of the five civilized tribes, including the Cherokee, and promoted the allotment of formerly communal tribal lands to individuals, {{with a view to}} encouraging <b>the</b> <b>assimilation</b> <b>of</b> Indians into mainstream US society and the market economy (though the bill was heavily amended in committee, to the point where Curtis himself had reservations about the legislation in its final form).

5|$|The Danish {{name is not}} unexpected; the {{language}} of the Ormulum, an East Midlands dialect, is stringently of the Danelaw (Bennett and Smithers 1982, pp.174–75). It includes numerous Old Norse phrases (particularly doublets, where an English and Old Norse term are co-joined), but there are very few Old French influences on Orm's language (Bennett 1986, p.33). Another—likely previous—East Midlands work, the Peterborough Chronicle, shows a great deal of French influence. The linguistic contrast between it and the work of Orm demonstrates both the sluggishness of the Norman influence in the formerly Danish areas of England and <b>the</b> <b>assimilation</b> <b>of</b> Old Norse features into early Middle English (Bennett 1986, pp.259–63).|$|E
5|$|The emperor's {{political}} reforms were connected with {{his desire to}} conquer all of China and to legitimize himself as a Chinese emperor. The prospect of conquering southern China was cut short by Wanyan Liang's assassination.

He sanctioned new policies {{with the intent to}} slow <b>the</b> <b>assimilation</b> <b>of</b> the Jurchens.

5|$|Historical records {{report that}} Minyue and Dongyue were emptied of people, {{and that its}} {{residents}} were deported to the territories between the Huai River and the Yangtze River. The alleged population transfer was a resumption of a policy that had been planned since 138 BC. The Han government considered the mountainous region difficult to control and was wary of trusting its residents. Modern historians doubt the event happened. The deportation of an entire kingdom is implausible, and nothing {{has been found to}} verify a migration of Han settlers to the Minyue region around the year 1, something that would have occurred had the area been abandoned while under Han control. There was only one town of Han settlers, Dongyue, in Minyue. Dongyue was built where the Min River meets the sea, around the time of Emperor Wu's reign. It is more likely that <b>the</b> <b>assimilation</b> <b>of</b> Minyue into Han Chinese culture through Han conquest happened later in the dynasty.|$|E
5|$|In 1879, again head of Internal Affairs, Kogălniceanu began {{organizing}} {{the administration of}} Northern Dobruja, through decrees. He supported a distinct legal regime, as a transition from Ottoman administration, and a period of rebuilding—in effect, a colonial rule, aiming for <b>the</b> <b>assimilation</b> <b>of</b> locals into the Romanian mainstream, but respectful of Dobrujan Islam. Unlike other partisans of colonization (including scientist Ion Ionescu de la Brad), Kogălniceanu saw the new territory as open only to ethnic Romanian homesteaders. His intercession {{played a part in}} the ethnic policies: he is reported to have personally urged the Romanian pastoralists (mocani) to abandon their traditional lifestyle and their Budjak homes, offering them the option of purchasing Northern Dobrujan land. This had become widely available after the partition of Ottoman estates, the nationalization of land once owned by the Muhajir Balkan, and the appropriation of uncultivated plots (miriè). Kogălniceanu also advised the local administration to overrepresent existing Romanian communities in the decision-making process.|$|E
5|$|The {{desire for}} {{responsible}} government {{resulted in the}} abortive Rebellions of 1837. The Durham Report subsequently recommended responsible government and <b>the</b> <b>assimilation</b> <b>of</b> French Canadians into English culture. The Act of Union merged the Canadas into a united Province of Canada and responsible government was established for all provinces of British North America by 1849. The signing of the Oregon Treaty by Britain and the United States in 1846 ended the Oregon boundary dispute, extending the border westward along the 49th parallel. This {{paved the way for}} British colonies on Vancouver Island (1849) and in British Columbia (1858). In 1867, the same year as Canadian Confederation, Britain declined to purchase for Canada the Alaska territory that was to that point tenuously held by Russia. With the United States purchasing Alaska instead, clearly demarcated borders for Canada, although there would continue to be some disputes about the exact demarkation of the Alaska-Yukon and Alaska-BC border for years to come.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>assimilation</b> {{efficiency}} <b>of</b> zooplankton is {{an essential}} parameter required to estimate energy transfer to higher trophic levels in marine ecosystems. However, little information is available for large oceanic copepods, especially the Neocalanus and Eucalanus species dominant in the subarctic Pacific. In this study, <b>the</b> <b>assimilation</b> efficiencies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> C 5 stages of Neocalanus cristatus, Neocalanus flemingeri and Eucalanus bungii were evaluated using eight phytoplankton species as food. <b>The</b> average <b>assimilation</b> efficiencies <b>of</b> N. cristatus, N. flemingeri and E. bungii ranged between 45 and 66 %, 44 and 66 % and 34 and 65 %, respectively. <b>The</b> <b>assimilation</b> efficiency was highly variable depending on the food phytoplankton species. In all species, <b>the</b> <b>assimilation</b> efficiency showed a significant negative relationship with the ash content of the phytoplankton (r 2 = 0. 79 – 0. 87, p < 0. 001). <b>The</b> <b>assimilation</b> efficiency <b>of</b> large-body sized N. cristatus for large-sized diatoms was higher than for the other copepod species. In population models of N. cristatus, changes in <b>assimilation</b> efficiency affect <b>the</b> growth and survival rates of the population. The Lagrangian ensemble model (LEM) for N. cristatus showed that, for assimilation efficiencies less than 57 %, the population could not be maintained. Because variations in assimilation efficiency may have significant effects on the copepod population, their variability should be incorporated into marine ecosystem models in the future...|$|R
40|$|Studies on <b>the</b> {{earnings}} <b>assimilation</b> <b>of</b> {{immigrants have}} traditionally focused exclusively on immigrants in employment. However, given evidence of immigrants' difficulties in entering and {{remaining in the}} labor market, restricting the population to those in employment may entail a selection bias. In addition, the primary variable of interest in such studies is often the duration of residence or the years since migration (YSM), which is interpreted {{as a proxy for}} potential labor market experience in the host country. The appropriateness of that proxy will, however, also depend {{on the extent to which}} immigrants are able to quickly enter and remain in the labor market. This study thus re-examines evidence on <b>the</b> earnings <b>assimilation</b> <b>of</b> immigrants in light of selection into the labor market and with better information on actual labor market experience in the host country.

5|$|Urban elites {{throughout}} the Empire shared a literary culture embued with Greek educational ideals (paideia). Hellenistic cities sponsored schools {{of higher learning}} {{as an expression of}} cultural achievement. Young men from Rome who wished to pursue the highest levels of education often went abroad to study rhetoric and philosophy, mostly to one of several Greek schools in Athens. The curriculum in the East was more likely to include music and physical training along with literacy and numeracy. On the Hellenistic model, Vespasian endowed chairs of grammar, Latin and Greek rhetoric, and philosophy at Rome, and gave teachers special exemptions from taxes and legal penalties, though primary schoolmasters did not receive these benefits. Quintilian held the first chair of grammar. In the eastern empire, Berytus (present-day Beirut) was unusual in offering a Latin education, and became famous for its school of Roman law. The cultural movement known as the Second Sophistic (1st–3rd century AD) promoted <b>the</b> <b>assimilation</b> <b>of</b> Greek and Roman social, educational, and aesthetic values, and the Greek proclivities for which Nero had been criticized were regarded from the time of Hadrian onward as integral to Imperial culture.|$|E
5|$|Local Czech militants forced about 5,000 local Poles, {{mostly from}} the {{northern}} part of the region, to flee to Poland already before July 1920. 4,000 of these expellees were located in a transitional camps in Oświęcim. About 12,000 Poles in total were forced to leave the region and flee to Poland in the aftermath of the division of Cieszyn Silesia. The local Polish population felt that Warsaw had betrayed them and they were not satisfied with the division. It is not quite clear how many Poles were in Zaolzie in Czechoslovakia. Estimates range from 110,000 to 140,000 people in 1921. The 1921 and 1930 census numbers are not accurate since nationality depended on self-declaration and many Poles declared Czech nationality mainly as a result of fear of the new authorities and as compensation for some benefits. Czechoslovak law guaranteed rights for national minorities, but the reality in Zaolzie was quite different. The local Czech authorities made it more difficult for local Poles to obtain citizenship, while the process was expedited when the applicant pledged to declare Czech nationality and send his children to a Czech school. Newly built Czech schools were often better supported and equipped, thus inducing some Poles to send their children there. This and other factors contributed to <b>the</b> <b>assimilation</b> <b>of</b> Poles and also to significant emigration to Poland. After a few years, the heightened nationalism typical of the period around 1920 receded and local Poles increasingly co-operated with the Czechs. Still, Czechization was supported by Prague, which did not abide by certain laws related to language, legislative, and organizational issues. Polish deputies in Czechoslovak National Assembly frequently tried to put that issues on agenda. One way or the other, increasingly local Poles thus assimilated into the Czech population.|$|E
