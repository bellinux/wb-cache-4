5000|$|Lock and Dam No. 15, a 1,200-foot roller dam with <b>twin</b> <b>locks</b> {{across the}} Mississippi River between Arsenal Island and Davenport. The roller dam, {{billed as the}} longest of its type, {{maintains}} a pool upstream that allows river traffic {{to pass through the}} once notorious Rock Island Rapids.|$|R
5000|$|Government Bridge, a double-decked bridge {{adjacent}} to Locks and Dam 15, carrying motor and rail traffic between Arsenal Island and Davenport. The 1896 truss bridge, about 1,950 feet long, includes a 360-degree swing span over the <b>twin</b> <b>locks.</b> It {{connects to the}} Illinois {{side of the river}} via the Rock Island Viaduct.|$|R
5000|$|Camden Lock is a {{small part}} of Camden Town, London Borough of Camden, England, which was {{formerly}} a wharf with stables on the Regent's Canal. It is immediately to the north of Hampstead Road <b>Locks,</b> a <b>twin</b> manually operated <b>lock.</b> The <b>twin</b> <b>locks</b> together are [...] "Hampstead Road Lock 1"; each bears a sign so marked. Hawley Lock and Kentish Town Lock are a short distance away to the east, while to the west there is a long level pound, and it is 27 mi to the next lock.|$|R
2500|$|The once-famous {{staircase}} at Lockport, New York {{was also}} a doubled set of <b>locks.</b> Five <b>twinned</b> <b>locks</b> allowed east- and west-bound boats to climb or descend the [...] Niagara Escarpment, a considerable engineering feat in the nineteenth century. While Lockport today has two large steel locks, half of the old twin stair acts as a spillway and can still be seen (without lock gates).|$|R

50|$|There are {{two types}} of locked twins: breech/vertex and vertex/vertex. In breech/vertex presentations, which are much more common, the first twin is in the breech position, {{presenting}} feet-first, and the second is in the cephalic (vertex) position, presenting in the normal head-first manner. In these cases, the chin of the first <b>twin</b> <b>locks</b> behind the chin of the second twin while in the uterus or birth canal, preventing vaginal delivery. In vertex/vertex presentations, where both twins are positioned for head-first delivery, the two heads become locked at the pelvic brim, preventing either fetus from passing through the pelvic inlet in a vaginal delivery.|$|R

50|$|<b>Locked</b> <b>twins</b> {{is a rare}} {{complication}} of multiple pregnancy where two fetuses become interlocked during presentation before birth. It occurs in roughly 1 in 1,000 twin deliveries and 1 in 90,000 deliveries overall. Most often, <b>locked</b> <b>twins</b> are delivered via Caesarean section, given that the condition has been diagnosed early enough. The fetal mortality rate is high for the twin that presents first, with over 50% being stillborn.|$|R
50|$|The tidal Outer Harbour is {{only used}} for {{entrance}} to the marina through <b>twin</b> sea <b>locks,</b> which are operated 24 hours a day. It needs frequent dredging to keep the access channel from the sea to the locks open and deep enough for vessels. The local RNLI lifeboat has its own mooring there. The entrance is beside Martello Tower No.66.|$|R
50|$|If <b>locked</b> <b>twins</b> are {{diagnosed}} in early delivery, before either twin is born, both fetuses {{can be delivered}} by Caesarean section. If one fetus has been partially born, attempts {{can be made to}} disimpact the twins manually, such as by the Zavanelli maneuver, with a view to performing an assisted delivery with ventouse or forceps. If the diagnosis is made only after the first <b>locked</b> <b>twin</b> has died in the birth canal, or if it is not expected to survive, the first twin may be decapitated and its head pushed up to allow safe delivery of the second twin.|$|R
2500|$|Locks {{can be built}} {{side by side on}} {{the same}} waterway. This is {{variously}} called doubling, pairing, or twinning. The Panama Canal has three sets of double locks. Doubling gives advantages in speed, avoiding hold-ups at busy times and increasing the chance of a boat finding a lock set in its favour. There can also be water savings: the locks may be of different sizes, so that a small boat does not need to empty a large lock; or each lock may be able to act as a side pond (water-saving basin) for the other. In this latter case, the word used is usually [...] "twinned": here indicating the possibility of saving water by synchronising the operation of the chambers so that some water from the emptying chamber helps to fill the other. This facility has long been withdrawn on the English canals, although the disused paddle gear can sometimes be seen, as at Hillmorton on the Oxford Canal. Elsewhere they are still in use; a pair of <b>twinned</b> <b>locks</b> has been opened in 2014 on the Dortmund-Ems Canal near Münster, Germany.|$|R
50|$|Since <b>locked</b> <b>twins</b> {{are often}} {{diagnosed}} {{in the late}} stages of delivery, it is often too late to intervene {{to save the life}} of the first twin and thus there is a high rate of stillbirth, estimated to be over 50%.|$|R
2500|$|There {{are eight}} locks on the Welland Canal. From {{the north to}} the south, there is the Lake Ontario level control lock at Port Weller, {{followed}} by Lock 2 and then Lock 3, a site with a visitors' information centre and museum in St. Catharines, Ontario. [...] There are four locks in Thorold, Ontario, including <b>twin</b> flight <b>locks</b> 4, 5 and 6, with Lock 7 {{leading up to the}} main channel. The Lake Erie level control lock sits in Port Colborne, Ontario.|$|R
50|$|The Model 597 is {{available}} {{in a number of}} configurations. Both synthetic and laminated wood stocks are available. The standard barrel length is 20 inches. The bolt system rides on <b>twin</b> rails, and <b>locks</b> in the open position when the last round is fired.|$|R
50|$|Andrew (Jase Blankfort) and {{his older}} brother Carl (Trey Rogers) enjoy {{listening}} to ghost stories that the local undertaker, Mr. Bennett (Frank Langella), tells them. One night Bennett tells the tale of a local farmer whose wife gave birth to conjoined twins, one being good-natured while the other was clearly evil. The farmer, ashamed of them, kept the <b>twins</b> <b>locked</b> in their room. Eventually the twins got sick from a liver disease and died together, so the farmer sawed them in half and buried the good twin in a cemetery and the bad twin in a shallow grave near the house, {{at the end of an}} old dirt road called Cry Baby Lane, as whoever is caught out there at night will hear the cries of the deceased twin. Later, Andrew, Carl, and a group of friends decide to hold a séance in the cemetery where the good twin is buried, but soon after the seance, a creepy phenomenon occurs around the town. When Andrew consults Mr. Bennett about it, he confesses that when the twins were separated, the farmer mixed up the twins and tossed the good one in the field and that the good twin is crying for help, not vengeance, and the bad twin possesses nearly everyone in town, and it is up to Andrew to stop him.|$|R
50|$|Today, we {{consider}} there being only one <b>twin</b> to The <b>Lock,</b> {{a work of}} more sacred inspiration, The Adoration of the Shepherds (1775). This canvas, also commissioned by the marquis, had been suggested by Fragonard himself. It shows the will of Fragonard to revive holy artwork and allow the contrast of two meanings of love: carnal or libertine love, belonging to the 18th century, and sacred, religious love.|$|R
50|$|Sadako {{eventually}} {{split into}} identical twins, one good and innocent, {{and the other}} destructive. After Shizuko committed suicide due to severe depression from the infamous ESP demonstration, Ikuma moved to Izu with the twins. The good Sadako grew into an adult and became an actress, while the evil <b>twin</b> was <b>locked</b> up by Ikuma and drugged. Sadako's evil self haunted her, leading to a lynching by fellow theatre troupe members aside from Toyama. Akiko Miyaji, the fiancé of the journalist whom Sadako killed, leads an angry mob to kill the evil Sadako, only for the twins to merge into one and slaughter her tormenters. Ikuma then wounded threw Sadako down the well behind his house. Sadako survived within for thirty years and died shortly before the events of Ring, creating the cursed videotape.|$|R
50|$|Construction of {{the fourth}} canal (officially known as the Welland Ship Canal) began in 1914 but, because of delays due to the First World War, it was not opened until 1932. The number of locks, now built of concrete, was reduced to eight; four of these, {{including}} the world-famous <b>Twin</b> Flight <b>Locks,</b> are in Thorold. The canal adopted a direct north-south route over the Escarpment, following {{the valley of the}} Ten Mile Creek all the way to a new Lake Ontario outlet at Port Weller. New industries associated with the canal {{led to the creation of}} the community of Thorold South in the 1920s. In 1973, a by-pass was excavated around the City of Welland. This was to be the first phase of a fifth Welland Canal, which would cross the Escarpment in one super-lock, but plans for further development have been shelved.|$|R
2500|$|The Oxford Canal was {{originally}} {{built as a}} contour canal, meaning that it twisted around hills to minimise vertical deviations from a level contour. However, with {{one eye on the}} developing railway network, in the 1820s the northern section of the canal between Braunston and Hawkesbury Junction was straightened out to reduce navigation time. This work reduced the distance by 14miles 6furlongs (23.7km). The section south of Napton was never straightened. The straightening challenged the capacity of three locks at Hillmorton, the first on the canal after the stop lock at Hawkesbury Junction. The solution to the congestion was to duplicate or <b>twin</b> the existing <b>locks</b> at Hillmorton, creating three pairs of two parallel narrow locks, which allowed for twice the traffic to pass the lock at any time. The work to double the locks was completed in August 1840. Not only was the capacity to pass the lock doubled, but the time taken was decreased as the locks were narrower. Tests showed that the locks could be operated in as little as one minute and 20 seconds! ...|$|R
50|$|In the 1960s the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers {{began to}} {{modernize}} the locks on the Ohio River and added 1200 ft chambers that permit a typical tow to pass in a single lockage. This modernization process continues today {{with the construction of}} a new dam with <b>twin</b> 1200 ft <b>locks</b> at Olmsted, Illinois located at the confluence of the Ohio and Mississippi rivers and a second 1200 ft chamber at McAlpine Locks and Dam near Louisville. Modern 1200 ft chambers are also being constructed at Kentucky Lock on the Tennessee River and at the Inner Harbor Lock on the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway at New Orleans. Other projects are underway in Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Arkansas. In addition, several major rehabilitations are also underway. Altogether, this ongoing work represents an investment of over $3.5 billion in inland waterway modernization that will be completed over the next decade. Half this investment will come from fuel taxes paid by the inland towing industry. These projects include not only modern navigation facilities, but also important investments in environmental restoration and management.|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} effect of surface {{modifications}} and constraints on the mechanical properties of Ni-Mn-Ga single crystals, which are imposed by (i) structural modifications near the surface, (ii) mounting to a solid surface, and (iii) guiding the stroke. Spark eroded samples were electropolished and characterized before and after each polishing treatment. Surface damage was then produced with spark erosion and abrasive wearing. Surface damage stabilizes and pins a dense twin-microstructure and prevents twins from coarsening. The density of twins increases with increasing degree of surface deformation. Twinning stress and hardening rate during mechanical loading increase with increasing surface damage and twin density. In contrast, when a damaged surface layer is removed, twinning stresses, hardening rate, and twin density decrease. Constraining the sample by mounting and guiding reduces the magnetic-field-induced strain by <b>locking</b> <b>twins</b> at the constrained surfaces. For single-domain crystals and for hard magnetic shape-memory alloys, external constraints strongly reduce the magnetic-field-induced strain and the fatigue lifetime is short. In contrast, for selfaccommodated martensite and for soft magnetic shape-memory alloys, the twin-microstructure adapts well to external constraints and the fatigue lifetime is long. The performance of devices with MSMA transducers requires managing stress distributions through design and control of surface properties, microstructure, and constraints...|$|R
50|$|In twin pregnancies, it is {{very common}} for one or both babies {{to be in the}} breech {{position}}. Most often twin babies do not have the chance to turn around because they are born prematurely. If both babies are in the breech position and the mother has gone into labour early, a cesarean section may be the best option. About 30-40% of twin pregnancies result in only one baby being in the breech position. If this is the case, the babies can be born vaginally. After the first baby who is not in the breech position is delivered, the baby who is presented in the breech position may turn itself around, if this does not happen another procedure may performed called the breech extraction. The breech extraction is the procedure that involves the obstetrician grabbing the second twin's feet and pulling him/her into the birth canal. This will help with delivering the second twin vaginally. However, if the second twin is larger than the first, complications with delivering the second twin vaginally may arise and a cesarean section should be performed. At times, the first twin (the twin closest to the birth canal) can be in the breech position with the second twin being in the cephalic position (vertical). When this occurs, risks of complications are higher than normal. In particular, a serious complication known as <b>Locked</b> <b>twins.</b> This is when both babies interlock their chins during labour. When this happens a cesarean section should be performed immediately.|$|R
