5|$|If {{ever there}} was a book {{calculated}} to make a man in love with its author, this appears <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the book. She speaks of her sorrows, in a way that fills us with melancholy, and dissolves us in tenderness, {{at the same time that}} she displays a genius which commands all our admiration. Affliction had tempered her heart to a softness almost more than human; and the gentleness of her spirit seems precisely to accord with all the romance of unbounded attachment.|$|E
5|$|On atheism, Sagan commented in 1981: An atheist {{is someone}} who is certain that God does not exist, someone who has {{compelling}} evidence against the existence of God. I know of no such compelling evidence. Because God can be relegated to remote times and places and to ultimate causes, {{we would have to}} know a great deal more about the universe than we do now to be sure that no such God exists. To be certain of the existence of God and to be certain of the nonexistence of God seem <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the confident extremes in a subject so riddled with doubt and uncertainty as to inspire very little confidence indeed.|$|E
25|$|I {{would like}} to see Punjab, North-West Frontier Province, Sindh and Balochistan amalgamated into a single state. Self {{government}} within the British Empire or without the British Empire, the formation of a consolidated North-West Indian Muslim state appears <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the final destiny of the Muslims, at least of North-West India.|$|E

25|$|The {{author of}} the 'Vestiges of Creation' would, I presume, say that, after a certain unknown number of generations, some bird {{had given birth to}} a woodpecker, and some plant to the mistletoe, and that these had been {{produced}} perfect as we now see them; but this assumption seems <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> no explanation, for it leaves the case of the coadaptations of organic beings {{to each other and to}} their physical conditions of life, untouched and unexplained.|$|E
25|$|Samuel Pepys {{recorded}} {{in his diary}} for 13 April 1661: To Whitehall to the Banquet House and there saw the King heale, {{the first time that}} ever I saw him do it— which he did with great gravity; and it seemed <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> an ugly office and a simple one. John Evelyn also refers to the ceremony in his Diary on the dates of 6 July 1660 and 28 March 1684.|$|E
25|$|I saw in {{his hand}} a long spear of gold, and at the point {{there seemed to be}} a little fire. He {{appeared}} <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> thrusting it at times into my heart, and to pierce my very entrails; when he drew it out, he seemed to draw them out also, and to leave me all on fire with a great love of God. The pain was so great, that it made me moan; and yet so surpassing was the sweetness of this excessive pain, that I could not wish to be rid of it...|$|E

"You are too just, madam, <b>to</b> require <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{thankful for}} the cold neglect with which your husband has uniformly treated me--neglect not unmingled with fixed aversion. You are too just, madam, <b>to</b> require <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{grateful}} for the constant and unceasing marks of scorn and malevolence with which I have been treated by others, or for such a homily as that with which your reverend chaplain has, at my expense, this very day regaled the assembled household." ...|$|R

25|$|I {{have long}} been gravitating towards the Socialist {{position}} — {{of course there is}} Socialism and Socialism, and mine is of the reasonable and moderate kind. When I look over my public efforts through the years, {{it seems to me that}} I have been a Socialist all my life. So far as any Party can express what appears <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the country's needs, the ILP approximates nearer to my outlook that any other, although I still look forward to and hope for the day when all really progressive forces can unite under the title of the Democratic Party. But Liberalism as represented by both wings — the Lloyd George wing, and the Asquith wing, is right outside my outlook now.|$|E
500|$|Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark was Wollstonecraft's {{most popular}} {{book in the}} 1790s. It sold well and was {{reviewed}} positively by most critics. Godwin wrote [...] "if {{ever there was a}} book calculated to make a man in love with its author, this appears <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the book." [...] It influenced Romantic poets such as William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge, who drew on its themes and its aesthetic.|$|E

6000|$|... "But," [...] said he, half-laughing, [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>to</b> {{have new}} troubles, which will <b>be</b> terrible <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> There <b>are</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> twelve old women, and a matron. How shall I manage twelve {{women and a}} matron!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{require no}} {{argument}} <b>to</b> urge <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> kind <b>to</b> a pretty woman; but this Catharine has <b>been</b> ever cold <b>to</b> me," [...] said the Prince.|$|R
500|$|Despite {{the success}} of the serial, Kneale felt that he had now taken the {{character}} of Quatermass as far as he could. [...] "I didn't want to go on repeating because Professor Quatermass had already saved the world from ultimate destruction three times, and that seemed <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> quite enough," [...] he said in 1986. It was also his final new collaboration with Rudolph Cartier, although the director did later handle a new version of Kneale's 1953 adaptation of Wuthering Heights for the BBC in 1962.|$|E
500|$|In 1909, Beecham {{conducted}} the first complete performance of A Mass of Life, {{the largest and}} most ambitious of Delius's concert works, written for four soloists, a double choir, and a large orchestra. Although the work was based on the same Nietzsche work as Richard Strauss's Also sprach Zarathustra, Delius distanced himself from the Strauss work, which he considered a complete failure. Nor was Strauss an admirer of Delius, as he was of Elgar; he told Delius that he did not wish to conduct Paris: [...] "the symphonic development seems <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> too scant, and it seems moreover to be an imitation of Charpentier".|$|E
500|$|... "His {{figure was}} that of a robust, large-framed man, worn down by {{confinement}} and hard fare; but he was now recovering his flesh and spirits; and a suit of blue clothes, with a gold laced hat that had been presented to him by the gentlement of Cork, enabled him to make a very passable appearance for a rebel colonel ... I have seldom met with a man, possessing, in my opinion, a stronger mind, or whose mode of expression was more vehement and oratorical. [...] Notwithstanding that Allen might have had something of the insubordinate, lawless frontier spirit in his composition ... he appeared <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a man of generosity and honor." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do not say {{anything}} about that," [...] the general said, heartily. [...] "It <b>is</b> a pleasure, <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>to</b> have <b>been</b> able <b>to</b> advance a promising young soldier.|$|R

[...] It influenced Romantic poets such as William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge, who drew on its themes and its aesthetic. While the book initially inspired readers to travel to Scandinavia, it failed to retain its popularity after the publication of Godwin's Memoirs of the Author of A Vindication of the Rights of Woman in 1798, which revealed Wollstonecraft's unorthodox private life.|$|E
500|$|Although Either/Or was Kierkegaard's {{first major}} book, {{it was one}} of his last books to be {{translated}} into English, as late as 1944. Frederick DeW. Bolman, Jr. insisted that reviewers consider the book in this way: [...] "In general, {{we have a right to}} discover, if we can, the meaning of a work as comprehensive as Either/Or, considering it upon its own merits and not reducing the meaning so as to fit into the author's later perspective. It occurred to me that this was a service to understanding Kierkegaard, whose esthetic and ethical insights have been much slighted by those enamored of his religion of renunciation and transcendence. ... Kierkegaard's brilliance seems <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> showing that while goodness, truth, and beauty can not speculatively be derived one from another, yet these three are integrally related in the dynamics of a healthy character structure".|$|E
500|$|The {{danger is}} perhaps not great if the people of one State, through their legislature, decide that Lady Chatterley's Lover goes so far beyond the {{acceptable}} standards of candor {{that it will be}} deemed offensive and non-sellable, for the State next door is still free to make its own choice. At least we do not have one uniform standard. But the dangers to free thought and expression are truly great if the Federal Government imposes a blanket ban over the Nation on such a book. [...] The fact that the people of one State cannot read some of the works of D. H. Lawrence seems to me, if not wise or desirable, at least acceptable. But that no person in the United States should be allowed to do so seems <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> intolerable, and violative of both the letter and spirit of the First Amendment.|$|E
6000|$|... "Never mind, {{you can ask}} him yourself," [...] said Nelly, as {{they drew}} near to the hut; [...] "he seems <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> have <b>been</b> badly wounded by his enemies." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Good God! I don't {{stand up}} to have you at an advantage,' said Nicholas (for Nicholas it was), as he {{observed}} a gesture of alarm {{on the part of}} Gride. 'Listen <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> You <b>are</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> married tomorrow morning.' ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{popular song}} {{reflects}} Crosby's walk of faith, as {{expressed by the}} apostle Paul in Philippians 1:21, [...] "For <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>to</b> live <b>is</b> Christ and <b>to</b> die <b>is</b> gain" [...] (ESV).|$|R
500|$|Critical {{reception}} of The Secret Service has been mostly negative. Gerry Anderson, however, {{said that it}} was his favourite of all the series that he had produced. Leo Eaton, who directed four episodes, has referred to The Secret Service as [...] "just a bit weird" [...] and questioned the effectiveness of Unwin's humour. Production manager Desmond Saunders' verdict was [...] "strange. I suppose it was the gobbledegook and the mixture of live action with puppets. It never seemed <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a very good idea." [...] In discussing the production of the series on the website TVCentury21.com, Simon Wickes judges the premise [...] "very strange", and suggests that The Secret Service was made first and foremost to bridge the Andersons' Supermarionation series and their subsequent efforts in live action. Kif Bowden-Smith of the Transdiffusion website concurs with this latter point, describing the mix of puppetry and live action as [...] "an experimental format for the following live-action series".|$|E
500|$|Lem {{was born}} in 1921 into a secular Jewish family in Lwów, interwar Poland (now Lviv, Ukraine). According to his own account, he was {{actually}} born on the 13th of September, but the date was changed to the 12th on his birth certificate because of superstition. He {{was the son of}} Sabina [...] Woller (1892–1979) and Samuel Lem (1879–1954), a wealthy laryngologist and former physician in the Austro-Hungarian Army, and first cousin to Polish poet Marian Hemar (Lem's father and Hemar's mother were brother and sister). In later years Lem sometimes claimed to have been raised Roman Catholic, but he went to Jewish religious lessons during his school years. He later became an atheist [...] "for moral reasons [...] [...] [...] the world appears <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> put together in such a painful way that I prefer to believe that it was not created [...] [...] [...] intentionally". In later years he would call himself both an [...] "agnostic" [...] and an atheist, ...|$|E
500|$|Lisa Henderson {{commented on}} the {{intersection}} between social class and gender in the film, particularly Brandon's working-class status: [...] "My reading of Boys [...] {{through the lens of}} class representation is not born of a univocal search for so-called positive images, but I do recoil at what appears <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a new instalment in a long history of popular images of working-class pathology. [...] But that is not the whole story. Within this universe of feeling and reaction structured by lack and tinted blue by country lyrics and a protective and threatening night-time light, characters imbricate gender and class through their longings for love, acceptance and a better life." [...] Jennifer Devere Brody {{commented on the}} film's exclusion of Philip DeVine, a disabled African-American man who was another victim of the shooting. [...] "Perhaps one can only speculate about the motivations behind this decision. But the effects are familiar ones in the history of racist representations.|$|E
