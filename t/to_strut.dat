25|$|November 6, 1976: Georgia Tech 23, #11 Notre Dame 14In {{the most}} memorable game of a 4-6-1 season, Georgia Tech {{defeated}} #11 Notre Dame without throwing a forward pass. After quarterback Gary Lanier was sacked while dropping back to pass in the first quarter, Notre Dame's Ross Browner and Willie Fry celebrated on the field. Georgia Tech coach Pepper Rodgers decided to not allow the Fighting Irish the chance <b>to</b> <b>strut</b> after a sack, {{and called for a}} run on every subsequent play. The unusual strategy worked, and the Yellow Jackets upset Notre Dame.|$|E
500|$|The video {{begins with}} {{close-up}} shots of Berrabah, Buchanan and Range; {{all three are}} wearing red dresses, while Berrabah is also wearing a black mask. Buchanan drops two large, blue feathers {{on the floor and}} begins strutting. Berrabah later removes her mask and is shown lying on a red chair. The next scene shows all three members on a fluffy, white couch in hosiery; Range, Buchanan and Berrabah are wearing blue, pink and white tops, respectively. The trio begin strutting together in a linear motion, resembling a catwalk. Range is shown on a bubble chair, and later on a red floor, resting her leg on a disco ball. Throughout the video, the Sugababes continue <b>to</b> <b>strut</b> in red dresses, corresponding with the song's theme. The video ends with Range, Buchanan and Berrabah posing with their hands on their hips. The music video for [...] "Red Dress" [...] earned the Sugababes a 2006 Music Vision Award nomination. The video peaked at number two on the UK TV airplay chart for three weeks.|$|E
500|$|In late 1999, Ivory began portraying a more {{conservative}} character. On January 23, 2000 at the Royal Rumble, she grudgingly {{took part in the}} [...] "Miss Royal Rumble" [...] swimsuit contest, which was won by Mae Young. She challenged Jacqueline for the WWF Women's Championship on March 9, but she was unsuccessful. After an absence, Ivory returned to WWF television in September 2000 {{as a member of a}} villainous alliance of conservative wrestlers known as Right to Censor. The change in character saw her don less suggestive ring attire and {{more conservative}} hairstyles. Ivory quickly began a rivalry with Women's Champion Lita, winning the Women's Championship for the third time by defeating Lita, Jacqueline, and Trish Stratus in a Fatal Four-Way match. She retained the title against Lita at the Survivor Series on November 19, with the assistance of Right to Censor leader Steven Richards, in a match that SLAM! Wrestling claimed [...] "illustrated to what heights women's wrestling is capable of reaching in North America if the right talent is permitted <b>to</b> <b>strut</b> their stuff in a wrestling ring and not a pit full of jello." [...] Ivory also retained her title in a Triple Threat match against Stratus and Molly Holly at Armageddon on December 10.|$|E

500|$|Reviewers {{praised the}} in-game voice acting. [...] G4TV's Matt Kell noted that Peter Cullen's voice work as Optimus was [...] "commanding and familiar", {{adding that the}} other actors [...] "even {{do their best to}} {{replicate}} the voices of the original cartoon." [...] Mike Nelson of Game Informer agreed and noted the game's excellent dialogue, stating [...] "the script has all the overwrought melodrama you’d expect from giant talking robots." [...] Several critics also gave high marks for War for Cybertrons multiplayer. [...] IGN's Arthur Gies noted the influences from Unreal Championship, Tribes, Team Fortress 2, and [...] adding that [...] "War for Cybertron leverages its transformation mechanic to create something that feels shockingly new." [...] Tom McShea of GameSpot noted that the game's Escalation mode provided a Transformers twist on Gears of Wars Horde mode. [...] GamePros Kat Bailey noted that the multiplayer was [...] "probably the most appealing part of the package", adding it had a [...] "strong suite [...] options." [...] 1UP.com's Matt Miller lauded the ability to play through the game's campaign with up to three players online, as did G4TV's Matt Kell. [...] Both reviewers also praised the new character designs, with Kell calling them [...] "inventive." [...] Wired.com's John Mix Meyer gave praise to the game's campaign length, stating [...] "The game’s 10-hour single-player campaign means there’s plenty of time for the crazy transformations <b>to</b> <b>strut</b> their stuff." [...] John Hamblin of Eurogamer praised the transformation animations. [...] He stated players will [...] "occasionally wish there was a Max Payne slow-mo option so you could appreciate the nuance of these feats a little more." ...|$|E

2500|$|There {{was also}} the popular [...] "Soul Train Line" [...] (a variant of the 1950s fad then known as The Stroll), {{in which all the}} dancers form two lines with a space in the middle for dancers <b>to</b> <b>strut</b> down and dance in {{consecutive}} order. Originally, this consisted of a couple—with men on one side and women on the other. In later years, men and women had their own individual lineups. Sometimes, new dance styles or moves were featured or introduced by particular dancers. In addition, there was an in-studio group of dancers who danced along to the music as it was being performed. Rosie Perez, Damita Jo Freeman, Darnell Williams, Cheryl Song, Louie [...] "Ski" [...] Carr, Alfie Lewis, [...] Alise Mekhail, Andrea N. Miles, Carmen Electra, Nick Cannon, MC Hammer, Jermaine Stewart, Heather Hunter, Fred [...] "Rerun" [...] Berry, Laurieann Gibson, Pebbles, and NFL legend Walter Payton were among those who got noticed dancing on the program over the years. Two former dancers, Jody Watley and Jeffrey Daniel, enjoyed years of success as members of the R group Shalamar after they were chosen by Soul Train talent booker/record promoter Dick Griffey and Cornelius to replace the group's original session singers in 1978.|$|E

Extensive tensile and stress rupture testing of several joint orientation at several temperatures provided a critical assessment of joint integrity of both material combinations.
