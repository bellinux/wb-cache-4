25|$|Following the 1783 Cedula of Population, many {{sugarcane}} plantations {{were established}} in the Naparima Plains surrounding San Fernando.

25|$|Tariffs {{in rural}} areas, where they exist, are {{set at the}} local level and differ from one {{locality}} to the other. In the Hauts-Bassins Region and Cascades Region, a Federation of water user groups has set the tariff in rural areas at CFAF 500/m3 (US$1/m3). 40% of this amount is supposed to be used for operating costs at the village level and 60% is paid into funds for maintenance, renewal and new investments as well as for a support unit at the regional level. The water tariff for rural areas in <b>this</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> thus is higher than the national urban water tariff for residential users charged by ONEA.|$|E

Previously hindered by national caveats, the deteroriating security situation prompted the German-led Regional Command North to launch a series of operations to take on the rising insurgency. Concerted operations began after an insurgent attack on PRT Kunduz within minutes of German Chancellor Angela Merkel's departure from a visit. Within two years, the German presence would be doubled and additional reinforcements from the American ISAF contingent were called in, including heavy German armoured vehicles and US aviation assets, allowing for a more aggressive approach towards the insurgency.|$|E
25|$|Ya'an is {{the main}} market for {{a special kind of}} tea which is grown in <b>this</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> and {{exported}} in very large quantities to Tibet via Kangding and over the caravan routes through Batang (Paan) and Teko. Although the Chinese regard it as an inferior product, it is greatly esteemed by the Tibetans for its powerful flavor, which harmonizes particularly well with that of the rancid yak's butter which they mix with their tea. Brick tea comprises not only what we call tea leaves, but also the coarser leaves and some of the twigs of the shrub, as well as the leaves and fruit of other plants and trees (the alder, for instance). This amalgam is steamed, weighed, and compressed into hard bricks, which are packed up in coarse matting in subunits of four. These rectangular parcels weigh between twenty-two and twenty-six pounds—the quality of the tea makes a slight difference to the weight—and are carried to Kangting by coolies. A long string of them, moving slowly under their monstrous burdens of tea, was a familiar sight along the road I followed.|$|E

25|$|All three enclosures, {{the only}} sites {{of this type}} known from the county, are notable for their small size and {{circular}} shape. In national terms their morphology is rather anomalous, a characteristic which can be interpreted {{in a number of}} ways. It has been suggested that they may {{have more in common with}} hengiform monuments of the later Neolithic and early Bronze Age than with 'normal' causewayed enclosures of the fourth millennium BC. Alternatively, they might represent a regional tradition distinct to <b>this</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>country.</b> In addition, the geographical distribution of the sites is confined to north-east Norfolk. While some allowance can be made for the usual factors associated with the distribution of cropmark sites (soils, geology, etc.), at present it seems that the clustering of the three sites in the north-east of the county may be of archaeological significance. The smaller dimensions of the Norfolk sites may be a reflection of the size and dispersal of the communities creating, maintaining and using them and it may not be necessary to assume that they occurred later than elsewhere in Britain. Although at present no excavation has taken place on any of the Norfolk 'causewayed' enclosures so these questions have yet to be answered.|$|E
25|$|In <b>this</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>country,</b> snake {{is named}} Bhujang, {{which is also}} the Sanskrit name for snake, in the Kutch region. The name is {{attributed}} to the city of Bhuj which is located below the hill named Bhujiya, after Bhujang, as it was the abode of snakes. On top of this hill there is a fort known as the Bhujia Fort where a temple has been built for the snake god and a second temple is {{at the foot of the}} hill known as Nani Devi. Bhujia Fort was the scene of a major battle between Deshalji I, the ruler of Kutch and Sher Buland Khan, Mughal Viceroy of Gujarat who had invaded Kutch. It was the early period of Deshalji's reign. When the army of Kutch was in a state of losing the battle, a group of Naga Bawas opened the gate of Bhujia Fort by a clever ploy of visiting Nag temple for worship and joined the fray against Sher Buland Khan's army. Eventually Deshalji I won the battle. Since that day Naga Bawa and their leader have a pride of place in the procession held on Nag Panchami day. Within the fort, at one corner, there is a small square tower dedicated to Bhujang Nag (snake god), who in folklore is said to have been the brother of Sheshnag. It is said Bhujang Nag came from Than of Kathiawar and freed Kutch from the oppression of demons known as daityas and rakshasas. The Snake Temple was also built at the time of the fortification of the hill during Deshalji I's reign and provided with a chhatri. Every year on Nag Panchami day a fair is held at the temple premises. In the Sindhi community Nag Panchami is celebrated in honour of Gogro.|$|E
500|$|The Romans {{built the}} fort on a {{naturally}} defensible sandstone bluff that overlooked a nearby crossing over the River Medlock. The area {{became an important}} junction {{for at least two}} major military roads through <b>this</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>country.</b> One highway ran east to west between the legionary fortresses of Deva Victrix (Chester) and Eboracum (York) the other ran north to Bremetennacum (Ribchester). In addition, Mamucium may also have overlooked a lesser road running north west to Coccium (Wigan). The fort was one of a chain of fortifications along the Eboracum to Deva Victrix road, with Castleshaw Roman fort lying [...] to the east, and Condate (Northwich) [...] to the west. Stamps on tegulae indicate that Mamucium had administrative links not only with Castleshaw, but also with Ardotalia, the nearest fort (12 miles), Slack and Ebchester; all the forts probably got the tegulae from the same place in Grimescar Wood near Huddersfield.|$|E

2500|$|Historically, {{this well}} {{plays a major}} role in joining the people in <b>this</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>country,</b> {{breaking}} the caste based discrimination preveals among them. Before and during the period of Lord Vaikundar, this part of the subcontinent was under the grip of feudalism, casteism and untouchability. There were separate wells and tanks for each caste, and people from the other caste were not allowed to draw out water from those wells. As in the Vinchai, since the social aim of 'uplifting the lowely treated people in the society' occupies a major part in the spiritual mission of Vaikundar which is projected towards the ideal Dharma Yukam, he wanted to stop this evil practice. So as the first step to reach this aim, this well is established at Swamithoppe. Apart from religious sacredness this well was also a historical icon since it was the first well in <b>this</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> where people could use water freely irrespective of their caste.|$|E
