In this study, transparent acrylic is used to construct a water model, which is 60 % {{as big as the}} original experimental melting reduction furnace of the China Steel Corporation. The mixing time of the molten iron phase in the water model is measured by using gas bottom blowing and changing the number of tuyeres (from three to five), the tuyere placement, the tuyere size (6. 0 – 15. 0 mm), and the gas <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> per tuyere (80 – 120 NL/min). The mixing trials adopt KCl as an indicator and use water filtrated using reverse osmosis (RO) in place of liquid iron to investigate the effect of gas bottom blowing conditions on mixing of the molten iron phase. The experimental results indicate that in the cases of four tuyeres in the square-corner and triangle-corner-center placements, 10. 0 mm tuyeres yield the shortest mixing time (and thus the best mixing effect) under different <b>total</b> gas <b>flow</b> <b>rates.</b> In the case of five tuyeres in the square-corner-center placement, 10. 0 mm tuyeres also have the shortest mixing time under <b>total</b> gas <b>flow</b> <b>rates</b> of 400 NL/min and 500 NL/min.

Under the premise of high phenol extraction rate, composite YH- 3 extraction agent reduces π–π interaction between phenolic compounds and aromatic hydrocarbons, thus decreasing the entrainment of neutral oil. The optimization of operation conditions, such as the diameter of heavy phase weir HWD, the flow ratio, the <b>total</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> and the rotation speed, are necessary. For single stage extraction experiment, the mass transfer efficiency was up to 84 % while the rate of extraction agent loss was lower than 0.28 % with the operation conditions of 29  mm of the heavy phase weir diameter (HWD), 1 : 1 – 1.4 : 1 of the flow ratio range, 160 – 200  mL/min of the <b>total</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> and the rotation speed varied from 2200 to 2600  r/min.

A network of microchannels with five generations is made {{and used as}} a simplified model of the pulmonary airway tree.

The resistance associated {{with the presence of}} one plug in a given generation is defined to establish a linear relation between the driving pressure and the <b>total</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> in the network. Based on this resistance, we have good predictions of the flow of two successive plugs in the network. For two-plug flows under the same driving pressure, the <b>total</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> depends not only on the lengths of the plugs but also the initial distance between the two.
