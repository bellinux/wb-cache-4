40|$|The paper {{addresses}} {{the effect of}} the external shape of lip-type nuts on the fatigue strength of commercial M 10 bolts loaded in tension. Evolving from the standard configuration, six nut geometries are compared, characterized by lips of different shape (cylindrical or tapered) and length. Testing and statistical treatment of the data are performed in accordance with a JSME standard involving 14 specimens for each geometry. Within the class of merely cylindrical lips, only limited advantages over the standard assembly are detected. In particular, the bolt strength remains mostly unaffected by lengthening of the lip beyond one-third of the nut height. Conversely, tapering of the lip end so as to thin its wall around the entry section of the bolt results in substantial improvements. In this case, the strength increase is roughly proportional to the taper length. Adoption of a <b>tapered</b> <b>lip</b> covering two-thirds of the nut height enhances the bolt strength by about one-fourth with respect to the standard geometry...|$|E
40|$|Three new Longidorus species, L. alaskaensis n. sp., L. paralaskaensis n. sp., and L. bernardi n. sp., are {{described}} from specimens collected near Fairbanks, Alaska. Longidorus alaskaensis differs from all species of Longidorus {{by the presence}} of a caecum-like structure situated at the reflex of the oviduct. Longidorus paralaskaensis most closely resembles L. alaskaensis n. sp., L. crassus Thorne, L. picenus Roca, Lamberti &Agostinelli, and L. silvae Roca, differing from the last three of these species by having a parallel vs. a <b>tapered</b> <b>lip</b> region, and from all four by having a more narrowly rounded tail tip. Longidorus paralaskaensis differs from L. alaskaensis by having a longer odontostyle (119 - 128 vs. 110 - 118 μm) and by lacking the caecum-like structure found at the reflex of the oviduct. Longidorus bernardi n. sp. most closely resembles L. mirus Khan, Chawla &Seshadri, from which it differs by having a longer tail with a more acutely rounded tip, a longer body length (3. 5 - 4. 6 vs. 3. 0 - 3. 6 μm), and a larger c' value (1. 6 - 1. 8 vs. 1. 3 - 1. 6). Longidorus bernardi differs from L. sylphus Thorne, L. africanus Merny, L. auratus Jacobs &Heyns, and L. conicaudatus Khan by having a slightly expanded lip region vs. a lip region with parallel body walls and a more finely rounded tail tip...|$|E
40|$|Ottolenchus azadkashmirensis n. sp. and O. longicauda n. sp., are {{described}} and illustrated herein. These two species differ from al 1 the known {{species of the}} genus Ottolenchus Husain & Khan, 1967 {{by the presence of}} markedly <b>tapering</b> <b>lip</b> region with distinct labial disc at the apex; spindleshaped, non muscular median bulb; prominent excretory pore with sclerotized duct and open vulva. O. longicauda n. sp. is recognized from O. azadkashnzirensis n. sp. by its longer body size, smooth body cuticle, short stylet, anterior vulva and more elongated tail. O. facultativus (Szczygiel, 1969) Brzeski, 1982 is reported {{for the first time in}} Pakistan. A key to the species of the genus Ottolenchus is also presented. =SUME Deux nouvelles espèces du genre Ottolenchus Husain & Khan, 1967 (Nenzatoda: Tylenchidae) ainsi qu’une clé des espèces et de...|$|R
25|$|Black-figure vase {{painting}} in Euboea was {{also influenced by}} Corinth and especially by Attica. It {{is not always easy}} to distinguish these works from Attic vases. Scholars assume that most of the pottery was produced in Eretria. Primarily amphoras, lekythos, hydria and plates were painted. Large-format amphoras were usually decorated with mythological scenes, such as the adventures of Herakles or the Judgment of Paris. The large amphoras, derived from 7th century shapes, have <b>tapering</b> <b>lips</b> and usually scenes relating to weddings. They are apparently funerary vases produced for children who died before they could marry. Restrained employment of incising and regular use of opaque white for the floral ornaments were typical features of black-figure pottery from Eretria. In addition to scenes reflecting Attic models, there were also wilder scenes like the rape of a deer by a satyr or Heracles with centaurs and demons. The vases of the Dolphin Class were previously regarded as being Attic, but are now considered to be Euboic. However, their clay does not match any known Eretrian sources. Perhaps the pieces were produced in Chalcis.|$|R
40|$|The {{results of}} a scale model static {{performance}} test of target thrust reverser configurations for the Pratt and Whitney Aircraft JT 8 D- 100 series engine are presented. The objective of the test was to select a series of suitable candidate reverser configurations for the subsequent airplane model wind tunnel ingestion and flight controls tests. Test results indicate that adequate reverse thrust performance with compatible engine airflow match is achievable for the selected configurations. <b>Tapering</b> of the <b>lips</b> results in loss of performance and only minimal flow directivity. Door pressure surveys were conducted on a selected number of lip and fence configurations to obtain data to support {{the design of the}} thrust reverser system...|$|R
50|$|The skull is {{of medium}} length, {{and should be}} broad, {{especially}} between the ears. The forehead line is moderately arched {{as seen from the}} side, with the occipital bone well developed without being conspicuous. The stop is well defined. The Rottweiler nose is well developed, more broad than round, with relatively large nostrils and always black. The muzzle should appear neither elongated nor shortened in relation to the cranial region. The nasal bridge is broad at the base and moderately <b>tapered.</b> The <b>lips</b> are black and close fitting with the corner of the mouth not visible. The gums should be black, or as dark as possible. Both the upper and lower jaws are strong and broad. According to the FCI Standard Rottweilers should have strong and complete dentition (42 teeth) with scissor bite, the upper incisors closely overlapping the lower incisors. The zygomatic arches should be pronounced. The eyes should be of medium size, almond-shaped and dark brown in colour. The eyelids are close fitting and should not droop. The ears are medium-sized, pendant, triangular, wide apart, and set high on the head. With the ears laid forward close to the head, the skull appears to be broadened. The skin on the head is tight fitting overall. When the dog is alert, the forehead may be slightly wrinkled.|$|R
40|$|With age, {{the lips}} acquire a “deflated ” appear-ance due to {{inversion}} and soft-tissue atrophy. 1 Furthermore, as youthful pout {{gives way to}} a flattened contour, labial rhytids make {{their way across the}} vermilion border. Lip augmentation is a common means of reversing these by-products of involution. Today’s plethora of lip augmentation approach-es, however, implies the absence of a definitive solu-tion. We agree with others 2 – 8 that such a filler should be natural in appearance and feel and permanent, yet easily reversible, replaceable, and adjustable. It should preserve labial architecture and contours (eg, Cupid’s bow, white roll, philtral dimple, central tubercle, and <b>tapering</b> of <b>lip</b> toward the commis-sures), thus avoiding “sausage ” lips. 9 From a functional standpoint, it should adapt to the shape of the lips such that they are not restrict-ed or distorted during animation. Operative goals should consist of increasing vermilion height, add-ing volume uniformly, enhancing pout, masking ex-cess visible dentition, and effacing lines and wrinkles without leaving visible scarring. Lastly, the prototypic technique must be facile, reproducible, brief, and well tolerated with rapid recovery. Based on extensive experience with Perma Facial Implant (PFI) (SurgiSil LLC, Plano, Tex.), we con-clude that it meets these criteria. In 2006, it secured CE marking for lip augmentation in Europe under the label PermaLip. As of 2007, it has been Food and Drug Administration cleared for facial soft-tissue en-hancement in areas such as the cheeks, chin, and nose. Composed of soft, solid, pliable silicone, this biocompatible product is ideally suited to the lips as well. Herein, we elaborate our lip implantation technique, detail the results and complications of a patient series, and compare this method with others...|$|R
