5|$|The book {{begins with}} Arthur Penhaligon and Leaf {{attempting}} {{to return to}} Earth after their adventures in the Border Sea. While Leaf is able to pass through <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> return to Earth, {{the presence of a}} Nithling duplicate of Arthur prevents him from doing so, and he is forced to remain in the Lower House.|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} couple of years, Phillips made music {{compilation}} discs for local businesses such as the local ice rink or cinema, men singing songs for loved ones, children playing an instrument, or even a neighbour’s dog howling along to piano accompaniment. As the record shop and studio took over the business, he had a brass plate made which he put on the wall just outside <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door,</b> <b>and</b> had labels made for the discs, but changed the design of the disc label every year. By 1957, Phillips was recording more and more groups of young men with guitars, basses, washboards and drums, who played skiffle.|$|E
5|$|Hamilton {{participated in}} the Battle of Princeton on January 3, 1777. After an initial setback, Washington rallied the American troops and led them in a {{successful}} charge against the British forces. After making a brief stand, the British fell back, some leaving Princeton, and others taking up refuge in Nassau Hall. Hamilton brought three cannons up and had them fire upon the building. Then some Americans rushed <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door,</b> <b>and</b> broke it down. The British subsequently put a white flag outside one of the windows. 194 British soldiers {{walked out of the}} building and laid down their arms, thus ending the battle in an American victory.|$|E

5|$|Later, {{they play}} their {{favorite}} game, Eels and Escalators. Patrick always gets escalators but SpongeBob always gets eels. Eventually, he loses {{the game and}} accidentally utters the swear word. Patrick then races to the Krusty Krab to tell Mr. Krabs with SpongeBob trying to stop him, inadvertently getting Patrick to say the word in the process. When SpongeBob bursts through <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> tells Mr. Krabs that Patrick said the swear word, Patrick then joins along. Eventually, Mr. Krabs stops their gibberish explanations, and takes SpongeBob and Patrick outside and makes them paint the Krusty Krab as punishment.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Maggie's baby monitor {{receives}} transmissions {{from the}} cellular tower. Rather than report this to Omnitouch, Marge becomes obsessed with eavesdropping on private calls. Eventually Bart and Milhouse play a prank on Marge by making her think that an escaped convict {{was attempting to}} break into the house. When Milhouse opens <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> tries to tell Marge that it was just a prank, Marge smashes the baby monitor on Milhouse's head and knocks him out and Bart rebukes that it was a fair punishment for eavesdropping, to which Marge reluctantly agrees.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{the police}} located the embassy {{caretaker}} {{and took him}} to their forward headquarters to brief the SAS and senior police officers. He informed them that the embassy's front door was reinforced by a steel security door, and that the windows on the ground floor and first floor were fitted with armoured glass—the result of recommendations made after the SAS had been asked to review security arrangements for the embassy several years earlier. Plans for entering the embassy by battering <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> ground-floor windows were quickly scrapped and work began on other ideas.|$|E
50|$|The synagogue {{was built}} by a Reform Jewish {{congregation}} in 1898. It is a wood-frame building, with clapboard siding, keyhole windows in <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>doors,</b> <b>and</b> a pair of octagonal towers topped by onion domes.|$|R
50|$|The lock-in lasts {{only until}} the police get an {{injunction}} {{to remove the}} staff. A tow truck rips off <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>doors</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> police enter the building. The DJs battle back using a fire hose and throwing tapes and other office objects at the police.|$|R
50|$|Patrol {{cars have}} had several {{different}} color schemes. They were originally painted dark blue, with white on <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>doors</b> <b>and</b> top (see image at right), showing the department logo on <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>doors.</b> A blue, rotating code-3 light bar was {{mounted on the}} roof. Unmarked vehicles used a single rotating light inside the car.|$|R
25|$|On the Select Bus Service routes except S79: {{customers}} paying with coins {{requiring a}} transfer must board via <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> request a transfer from the operator. All other customers may board via {{any of the}} three doors on Select Bus Service buses only.|$|E
25|$|The {{building}} was expanded and largely rebuilt from 2012 to 2014, re-opening on September 14, 2014 {{just in time}} for the High Holydays. The architects were Acton/Ostry of Vancouver. The {{building was}} completely rebuilt except for part of the foundation and three exterior walls. <b>The</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> (<b>and</b> address) are now at 989 West 28th Avenue although the building occupies the same site.|$|E
25|$|All {{other local}} bus {{services}} are now operated by modern low-floor buses, {{which may be}} single-deck or double-deck. Most buses operating in London have two sets of doors, and passengers board the bus using <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> alight using the rear door, whilst some buses on less busy routes have only one door. All these buses conform to the Disability discrimination act, and can accept passengers in wheelchairs and other mobility impaired passengers.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} {{first decade of}} the 21st century, {{legislation}} was passed to allow sheriffs to purchase white vehicles (if agreed to by the city or county), and allowing sheriffs' deputies to wear any color uniform the sheriff chose. Sheriffs' vehicles still must have the star on <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>doors</b> <b>and</b> markings on <b>the</b> trunk as before.|$|R
25|$|Nathaniel Gilman House {{was built}} in 1740. The Gilman House is a large colonial white {{clapboard}} home with a gambrel roof hipped at one end, a leaded fanlight over <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> a wide panelled entry hall. This home, {{as well as the}} Benjamin Clark Gilman House which is also owned by the Academy, were built for members of Exeter's Gilman family, who donated the Nathaniel Gilman House to the academy in 1905. The home now houses the academy's Alumni and Alumnae Affairs and Development Office.|$|E
25|$|The MBTA's {{solution}} was to turn the surface portion of the Green Line into a proof-of-payment system {{to increase the efficiency}} of boarding at peak times on surface Green Line stops. All doors on all trolleys open at some or all stations, depending on the branch. Passengers can pay their fare in several ways, depending on their payment method. Passengers paying with cash must enter through <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> pay at the farebox, where they may receive a proof-of-payment receipt. Stored-value CharlieCard or CharlieTicket holders may also need to pay at the farebox.|$|E
25|$|When {{the film}} ended, Purvis stood by <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> {{signaled}} Dillinger's exit by lighting a cigar. Both {{he and the}} other agents reported that Dillinger turned his head and looked directly at the agent as he walked by, glanced across the street, then moved ahead of his female companions, reached into his pocket but failed to extract his gun, and ran into a nearby alley. Other accounts stated Dillinger ignored a command to surrender, whipped out his gun, then headed for the alley. Agents already had the alley closed off, but Dillinger was determined to shoot it out.|$|E

5000|$|In October 1952 the Paris Motor Show welcomed a {{modified}} 203 which now featured hinged quarter light windows [...] on <b>the</b> <b>front</b> ends of <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>doors</b> <b>and</b> an enlarged rear {{window on the}} saloon versions. [...] This upgrade also saw {{the removal of the}} speedometer from the centre of the dashboard to a position directly ahead of the driver.|$|R

25|$|The current Hubbard House {{is mostly}} a typical I-house design but the two-story front (west) section {{of the house was}} not {{constructed}} until 1872. Until that time the Hubbard family was confined to the smaller, one-story portion of the house. Quarters were cramped during this time. The two-story portion of the house features windows on both sides of <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> three windows on the second-floor, representing the typical I-house design. Sometime after both sections were completed a bay window was added in the angle between the wings. Elbert's room was in the attic, a room which still existed when the building was nominated to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places.|$|E
25|$|According to {{accounts}} of the following event reported by Glenn Boyer in I Married Wyatt Earp, Earp had run two cowboys, Tobe Driscall and Ed Morrison, out of Wichita earlier in 1878. During the summer, the two cowboys—accompanied by another two dozen men—rode into Dodge and shot up the town while galloping down Front Street. They entered the Long Branch Saloon, vandalized the room, and harassed the customers. Hearing the commotion, Earp burst through <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door,</b> <b>and</b> before he could react, {{a large number of}} cowboys were pointing their guns at him. In another version, there were only three to five cowboys. In both stories, Holliday was playing cards {{in the back of the}} room and upon seeing the commotion, drew his weapon and put his pistol at Morrison's head, forcing him and his men to disarm, rescuing Earp from a bad situation. No account of any such confrontation was reported by any of the Dodge City newspapers at the time. Whatever actually happened, Earp credited Holliday with saving his life that day, and the two men became friends.|$|E
25|$|The Julian Street Jr. {{residence}} {{is still}} extant. By 1974, {{the house was}} owned by Howard and Janette R. Tomkins and the property was subdivided to allow a separate building lot. Other changes were {{the removal of the}} stone wall and guardrail by the driveway, which was then paved with asphalt, and building a playhouse {{at the top of a}} rock pile in front of the house. The house was also changed: the stone wall behind the house was extended into a curve while the front gravel walkway was retained, the ramp behind the serpentine wall had stairs added to it, a curved wall was added in front of <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door,</b> <b>and</b> a flagstone terrace was added to the back and side of the west part of the house. By the late 1970s, the house was owned by the Birnbaum family, who added steps to the front ramp up to the house, reduced the height of the serpentine wall, and added a raised entertainment area in part of the large living room.|$|E
60|$|Tony {{entered a}} small sitting-room, into which <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> opened, <b>and</b> {{took a seat}} by Cousin Maria.|$|R
25|$|Some {{cars from}} the 1920s to early 1960s used {{retractable}} semaphores called trafficators rather than flashing lights. They were commonly mounted high up behind <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>doors</b> <b>and</b> swung out horizontally. However, they were fragile {{and could be}} easily broken off and also {{had a tendency to}} stick in the closed position. These can be fitted with flashing lights as an upgrade.|$|R
5000|$|In 1959, Chrysler {{started to}} {{advertise}} the car's new wedge-head [...] "B" [...] engines as [...] "Golden Lions" [...] and the cars as [...] "Lion Hearted". The RB 383 produces [...] with a twin-barrel carburetor. Lions {{were used in}} the advertising, and the cars had lion emblems on <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>doors</b> <b>and</b> on <b>the</b> cylinder heads. Air conditioning was a $510 option.|$|R
500|$|The Earps and a posse {{tracked the}} men down and arrested Luther King, who confessed {{he had been}} holding the reins while Bill Leonard, Harry [...] "The Kid" [...] Head, and Jim Crain robbed the stage. They arrested King and Sheriff Johnny Behan escorted him to jail, but somehow King walked in <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> almost {{immediately}} out the back door.|$|E
500|$|The {{western part}} of the first floor is {{dominated}} by a large formal living room. The room has two entrances, one {{at the front of the}} hall, near <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>and</b> the other at the back end of the hall. This was the room in which Elva Glidden married in the late 19th century. After 1941 the rear part of the living room, or [...] "west" [...] room, was walled off and a second kitchen added. When Jessie Glidden, the last Glidden to occupy the old homestead, moved in 1998, the west room was restored to its original size and the second kitchen removed.|$|E
500|$|Several {{shots were}} exchanged: {{the house was}} riddled with bullets, but the whites did not {{overtake}} it. [...] The standoff lasted long into the next morning, when Sarah and Sylvester Carrier were found dead inside the house; several others were wounded, including a child who {{had been shot in}} the eye. Two white men, C. P. [...] "Poly" [...] Wilkerson and Henry Andrews, were killed; Wilkerson had kicked in <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door,</b> <b>and</b> Andrews was behind him. At least four whites were wounded, one possibly fatally. The remaining children in the Carrier house were spirited out the back door into the woods. They crossed dirt roads one at a time, then hid under brush until they had all gathered away from Rosewood.|$|E
50|$|The final {{model year}} of the RELAY. The Saturn logos had been dropped from <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>doors,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> all-wheel drive option was no longer available. The Relay was {{discontinued}} after the 2007 model year. The Doraville, Georgia assembly plant closed in September 2008. The last 2007 RELAY rolled off the line on November 17, 2006. The Relay {{was replaced by the}} 8-passenger, Lambda-based Outlook crossover SUV.|$|R
5000|$|In Argentina and Chile the 4 van (Fourgonette) {{is known}} as [...] "Renoleta", {{following}} the nickname given to the Citroën 2CV van, [...] "Citroneta". Due to heavy taxation on passenger vehicles in the late 1950s, the first 2CVs were imported unfinished, only up to <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>doors</b> <b>and</b> completed with an Argentine-made pickup truck bed. The Spanish word for pickup truck is [...] "camioneta", hence [...] "Renoleta".|$|R
