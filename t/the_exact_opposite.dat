Shading is a powerful cue used by animals in different phyla to identify the shapes of objects. Research with chicks showed that they preferred to peck at grains with shadows falling below them (as if illuminated from above), so both humans and birds may make use of shading as a depth cue.|$|E
5|$|Although a close {{game was}} predicted, {{the game was}} <b>the</b> <b>exact</b> <b>opposite,</b> as the Wolverines finally {{displayed}} the long sought offensive firepower from a Rich Rodriguez offense. Michigan scored the only points of the first quarter, as Vincent Smith opened the scoring with a 12-yard touchdown run and quarterback Denard Robinson added another touchdown on a 32-yard run. Michigan started the second quarter with another touchdown, {{this time with a}} 3-yard run by Michael Shaw. All of Connecticut's scoring came in the second quarter: a 32-yard field goal by Dave Teggert, and then a 2-yard run by Jordan Todman. The only scoring of the third quarter came on a 24-yard Michigan field goal by Brendan Gibbons. Connecticut managed to enter Michigan's red zone during the third quarter, but D.J. Shoemate fumbled the ball after a hit by J.T. Floyd and Obi Ezeh recovered it to prevent Connecticut from scoring. In the fourth quarter, Smith caught an 11-yard touchdown pass from Robinson; however, the extra point attempt was no good.|$|E

5|$|Enterprise {{victory over}} Tripoli had very {{different}} {{consequences for the}} two nations involved. In Tripoli, the defeat, combined with severity of the Rous' punishment, severely hurt morale throughout the city, and led to significant reductions in recruitment for Tripolitan ships' crews. In the United States, <b>the</b> <b>exact</b> <b>opposite</b> occurred, with wild publicity surrounding the arrival of news that the Americans had won their first victory over the Tripolitans. The American government gave a month's pay as a bonus to each of Enterprise crew members, and honored Sterett by granting him a sword and calling for his promotion. Fanciful plays were written about the victorious Americans, and morale and enthusiasm about the war reached a high point. The victory {{did not have any}} long-term consequences in the conduct of the war, however. Dale's blockade of Tripoli was ineffective in preventing ships from entering and leaving the port, and was equally ineffective in altering the Pasha's diplomatic stance toward the Americans. Dale's squadron was relieved in 1802 by another under Richard Morris, and the war continued until 1805.|$|E

6000|$|BROWNING'S PLACE AND MESSAGE. Browning's {{place in}} our {{literature}} will be better appreciated by comparison with his friend Tennyson, whom we have just studied. In one respect, at least, these poets are in perfect accord. Each finds in love the supreme purpose and meaning of life. In other respects, especially in their methods of approaching the truth, {{the two men are}} <b>the</b> <b>exact</b> <b>opposites.</b> Tennyson is first the artist and then the teacher; but with Browning the message is always the important thing, and he is careless, too careless, of the form in which it is expressed. Again, Tennyson is {{under the influence of the}} romantic revival, and chooses his subjects daintily; but [...] "all's fish" [...] that comes to Browning's net. He takes comely and ugly subjects with equal pleasure, and aims to show that truth lies hidden in both the evil and the good. This contrast is all the more striking when we remember that Browning's essentially scientific attitude was taken by a man who refused to study science. Tennyson, whose work is always artistic, never studied art, but was devoted to the sciences; while Browning, whose work is seldom artistic in form, thought that art was the most suitable subject for a man's study.|$|R
40|$|The past {{forty years}} have {{witnessed}} spectacular progress in precision measurements, {{beginning with the}} first coherent optical source, the HeNe CW laser. Almost immediately, the pioneers of the stable laser epoch introduced optical heterodyne techniques to explore {{the stability of the}} laser 2 ̆ 7 s optical frequency, expecting the few milliHertz linewidth predicted by the Schawlow-Townes formula for phase diffusion, and instead finding myriad physical processes that broaden and jiggle optical frequencies far beyond that narrow range. After a huge time and learning effort, most of these technical limitations can now be overcome. The paper is intended to offer a bystander/sometimes-participant 2 ̆ 7 s view into the advances in laser tools and the exciting scientific/technical worlds that were opened by them. Roughly one 2 ̆ 2 zillion 2 ̆ 2 further clever inventions and techniques have added capability to the laser and have enabled many bursts of productive research. Now, after nearly forty years of incremental progress, the astonishing reality is that within the past one year - absolute optical frequency measurements have suddenly become feasible, simple - even routine. This welcome and unexpected progress is based on the merger of techniques from the ultrastable lasers and the ultrafast lasers research communities. In a very real sense, these research objectives seem to be <b>the</b> <b>exact</b> <b>opposites</b> - <b>the</b> most unchanging versus the most quickly changing...|$|R

Presumably someone at BBC Three saw that he {{looks a little like}} Kevin Bishop, noticed that Ali G hasn’t been around for the best part of a decade and calculated success on that shaky basis.' Stuart Heritage of The Guardian remarks in an article concerning the justification behind Television Show names that 'BBC3's Lee Nelson's Well Good Show suffers from the fact that it's almost <b>the</b> <b>exact</b> scientific <b>opposite</b> of well good.'

25|$|Global brain theorists {{reply that}} the {{emergence}} of distributed intelligence would lead to <b>the</b> <b>exact</b> <b>opposite</b> of this vision.

Moreover, a more distributed form of decision-making would decrease the power of governments, corporations or political leaders, thus increasing democratic participation and reducing the dangers of totalitarian control.|$|E

6000|$|There {{was no more}} chance, {{for there}} were now no more flies, except a small [...] "cobbery," [...] a sea-trout fly from the Sound of Mull. It was {{time for us to}} go, with a heavy heart and a basket empty, except for two or three miserable trout. The loss of those two salmon, whether big or little fish, was not the whole misfortune. All the chances of the day were gone, and seldom have salmon risen so freely. I had not been casting long enough to smoke half a cigarette, when I hooked each of those fish. They rose at flies which were <b>the</b> <b>exact</b> <b>opposites</b> of each other in size, character, and colour. They were ready to rise at {{anything}} but the sniggler. And I had nothing to offer them, absolutely nothing bigger than a small red-spinner from the Test. On that day a fisher, not far off, hooked nine salmon and landed four of them, in one pool, I never had such a chance before; the heavy flood and high wind had made the salmon as [...] "silly" [...] as perch. One might have caught half a dozen of the great sturdy fellows, who make all trout, even sea-trout, seem despicable minnows. Next day I fished again in the same water, with a friend. I rose a fish, but did not hook it, and he landed a small one, five minutes after we started, and we only had one other rise {{all the rest of the}} day. Probably it was not dark and windy enough, but who can explain the caprices of salmon? The only certain thing is, that carelessness always brings misfortune; that if your tackle is weak fish will hook themselves on days, and in parts of the water, where you expected nothing, and then will go away with your fly and your casting-lines. Fortune never forgives. He who is lazy, and takes no trouble because he expects no fish, will always be meeting heart-breaking adventures. One should never make a hopeless or careless cast; bad luck lies in wait for that kind of performance. These are the experiences that embitter a man, as they embittered Dean Swift, who, old and ill, neglected and in Irish exile, still felt the pang of losing a great trout when he was a boy. What pleasure is there in landscape and tradition when such accidents befall you? ...|$|R
