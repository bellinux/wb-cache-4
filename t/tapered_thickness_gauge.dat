40|$|When {{inspecting}} {{the thickness of}} rolled metal {{with the use of}} <b>thickness</b> <b>gauges</b> we cannot obtain the true value of thickness. That means the measurement gives us only an approximate value. This is explained by both precision consideration in principle of the <b>thickness</b> <b>gauge</b> {{and the nature of the}} inspected material. The accuracy of <b>thickness</b> <b>gauge</b> is a characteristic that shows the degree of approximation of test indication to the true value of thickness. It correlates with physical phenomena that the device is based on, its schematic circuit and the tolerance of individual units of the gauge. The key disadvantage of the X-ray technique in thickness measurement is difficult interpretation of readings, namely the conversion of radiation attenuation in material into its thickness. According to the current Russian standard, the variation in metal density and its chemistry is not taking into consideration when measuring. To compensate this and to eliminate its influence on the measurement accuracy, we offered a new scheme for the X-ray <b>thickness</b> <b>gauge</b> design (patents 22152601...|$|R
