Following the announcement, Wam stated that NSB would continue to operate the service, and use the Timetoget concept. An internal document the newspaper Varden received access to showed that NSB needed to calm down the heated discussions with <b>the</b> <b>labor</b> <b>unions,</b> and that their negativity to Timetoget was a tactical move to satisfy <b>the</b> <b>labor</b> <b>unions.</b> Minister of Transport, Terje Moe Gustavsen from the Labour Party, stated in a meeting with two parliamentarians from Telemark, that he would allow a new private company, without NSB ownership, to operate the line.|$|E

5|$|Truman cooperated {{closely with}} the Republican leaders on foreign policy, though he fought them bitterly on {{domestic}} issues. The power of <b>the</b> <b>labor</b> <b>unions</b> was significantly curtailed by the Taft–Hartley Act, which was enacted over Truman's veto. Truman twice vetoed bills to lower income tax rates in 1947. Although the initial vetoes were sustained, Congress overrode his veto of a tax cut bill in 1948. The parties did cooperate on some issues; Congress passed the Presidential Succession Act of 1947, making the Speaker of the House and the President pro tempore of the Senate rather than the Secretary of State next in line to the presidency after the Vice President.|$|E

5|$|Peronism still {{controlled}} <b>the</b> <b>labor</b> <b>unions,</b> {{the most}} powerful ones in all of Latin America. The biggest one was the General Confederation of Labour (CGT). Alfonsín sought to reduce the Peronist influence over the unions, fearing that they may become a destabilizing force for the fledgling democracy. He rejected their custom of holding single-candidate internal elections, and deemed them totalitarian and not genuine representatives of the workforce. His proposal was to change the laws for those internal elections, remove the union leaders appointed during the dictatorship, and elect new ones under the new laws. The CGT rejected the proposal as interventionist, and prompted Peronist politicians to vote against it. The law {{was approved by the}} Chamber of Deputies but failed to pass in the Senate by one vote. A second bill proposed simply a call to elections, without supervision from the government, which was approved. As a result, the unions remained Peronist.|$|E

25|$|After {{the first}} half of the 1970s gave high prices, the company {{experienced}} low prices during the latter part of the decade. Meanwhile, it was a severely unmodern mill, oftentimes employing archaic and inefficient production processes. Per Ethold was hired as chief executive officer in 1977 and started the process of modernizing the mill. By 1981 all auxiliary production mills were closed, including fine-grade paper, sulfite pulp and sawed wood. This led to major layoffs and demonstrations by <b>the</b> <b>labor</b> <b>unions.</b>|$|E

25|$|The National Labor Relations Act of 1935, {{also known}} as the Wagner Act, finally {{guaranteed}} workers the rights to collective bargaining through unions of their own choice. The Act also established the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) to facilitate wage agreements and to suppress the repeated labor disturbances. The Wagner Act did not compel employers to reach agreement with their employees, but it opened possibilities for American labor. The result was a tremendous growth of membership in <b>the</b> <b>labor</b> <b>unions,</b> especially in the mass-production sector, composing the American Federation of Labor. Labor thus became a major component of the New Deal political coalition.|$|E
25|$|Busy Bee won a {{contract}} to operate several inter-Scandinavian routes for Scandinavian Airlines System from 1982. This were mostly out of Copenhagen Airport to Stavanger, Kristiansand, Göteborg Landvetter Airport and Jönköping Airport, {{as well as between}} Oslo and Gothenburg. For instance, the Oslo–Gothenburg route replaced a Douglas DC-9 service which was running at a loss. With smaller capacity and higher frequency, Busy Bee was able to triple patronage within three years and brought profitability to the route. Due to disputes with <b>the</b> <b>labor</b> <b>unions,</b> SAS terminated parts of its contract with Busy Bee in March 1984. Instead they established what would become SAS Commuter. However, delays postponed the route transfer until December.|$|E

25|$|New enemies {{appeared}} for <b>the</b> <b>labor</b> <b>unions</b> after 1935. Newspaper columnist Westbrook Pegler {{was especially}} {{outraged by the}} New Deal's support for powerful labor unions that he considered morally and politically corrupt. Pegler saw himself a populist and muckraker whose mission was to warn the nation that dangerous leaders were in power. In 1941 Pegler became the first columnist ever to win a Pulitzer Prize for reporting, {{for his work in}} exposing racketeering in Hollywood labor unions, focusing on the criminal career of William Morris Bioff. Pegler's popularity reflected a loss of support for unions and liberalism generally, especially as shown by the dramatic Republican gains in the 1946 elections, often using an anti-union theme.|$|E
25|$|The NWP's {{agenda was}} at times opposed by working class women and by <b>the</b> <b>labor</b> <b>unions</b> that {{represented}} working class men who feared low-wage women workers would lower the overall pay scale and demean {{the role of}} the male breadwinner. Eleanor Roosevelt, an ally of the unions, generally opposed the NWP policies because she believed women needed protective legislation, not equality. However, the National Woman's Party found protective legislation to relegate women to a lower class, and aimed their work on the ERA and other legislation to combat this second class citizenship status. The NWP argued that protective labor legislation would continue to depress women's wages and prevent women from gaining access to all types of work and parts of society.|$|E
25|$|Senator Robert Wagner {{wrote the}} National Labor Relations Act, which {{guaranteed}} workers {{the rights to}} collective bargaining through unions of their own choice.

When the Flint sit-down strike threatened the production of General Motors, Roosevelt broke with the precedent set by many former presidents and refused to intervene; the strike ultimately led to the unionization of both General Motors and its rivals in the American automobile industry.|$|E

25|$|To cut costs, Oslo Sporveier {{considered}} {{during the}} late 1960s if it could introduce one-man operation and abolish the conductor during off-peak hours. This would require a redesign of the interior. Inspiration was gathered from the Hamburg Tramway and unit 206 was rebuilt in 1970. However, <b>the</b> <b>labor</b> <b>unions</b> were opposed to the change, fearing for their jobs, and succeeded at vetoing the change. From 1971 one-man operations were introduced by Bærumsbanen on their Gullfisk units, creating a certain precedence for future conversion. From 29 September 1974 the Lilleaker and Ekeberg Lines were combined as Line 9, and all available Gullfisk were moved there. Thus all street tram services were being served with SM53. However, there were soon a lack of Gullfisk, resulting {{in some of the}} Høka trams reentering service on the suburban lines.|$|E
25|$|In Sweden, <b>the</b> <b>labor</b> <b>unions</b> protested after LKAB {{demanded that}} the {{employees}} switch union from Swedish Union for Service and Communications Employees to the Swedish Metalworkers Union.

In May the Opseth stated that the Norwegian Government would give the necessary rights to the joint venture. At the same time, the state would give Narvik Municipality economic support and real estate for commercial development. With Malktrafik's take-over, 50 employees, equally distributed between the two countries, became redundant. On 28 May, 22 train drivers, all Swedish, took out sick leave in protest towards being forced to switch labor union and receive lower wages and worse pension rights. This caused a third of the ore trains to be canceled.|$|E
