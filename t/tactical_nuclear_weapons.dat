5|$|Five {{of these}} had been {{completed}} {{by the spring of}} 1956 and were undergoing preflight tests when the entire program was canceled on 13 April 1956 and all components in preparation scrapped. A week later, the Attack Aviation branch of the VVS was superseded by the Fighter-Bomber branch and the doctrine of the VVS was drastically modified. No longer would the VVS provide close support to the Army, but rather it would use <b>tactical</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> as part of the nuclear battlefield.|$|E
5|$|Mastodon {{called for}} the {{deployment}} of two squadrons of eight Handley Page Victors to Tengah and one of eight Avro Vulcans to Butterworth. The British nuclear stockpile consisted of only 53 nuclear weapons in 1958, {{most of which were}} of the old Blue Danube type, but plans called for 48 of the new, lighter Red Beard <b>tactical</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> to be stored at Tengah when they became available, so each Vbomber could carry two. Up to 48 Red Beards were secretly stowed in a highly secured weapons storage facility at RAF Tengah, between 1962 and 1971, for possible use by the Vbomber force detachment and for Britain's military commitment to SEATO.|$|E
5|$|During this period, the United States Army {{had been}} {{introducing}} the UH-1 Iroquois into service. First used in its intended {{role as a}} transport, it was soon modified {{in the field to}} carry more machine guns in {{what became known as the}} helicopter gunship role. This proved effective against the lightly armed enemy, and new gun and rocket pods were added. Soon the AH-1 Cobra was introduced. This was an attack helicopter armed with long-range BGM-71 TOW missiles able to destroy tanks from outside the range of defensive fire. The helicopter was effective, and prompted the U.S. military to change its defensive strategy in Europe by blunting any Warsaw Pact advance with anti-tank helicopters instead of the <b>tactical</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> that had been the basis for NATO's battle plans since the 1950s.|$|E

5|$|From October 1951 to May 1954 Wolson was Commandant of the Air War College at Maxwell Air Force Base, Alabama. He {{then became}} {{commander}} of the Third Air Force in the United Kingdom, also becoming head of the Military Assistance Advisory Group for the United Kingdom on 1 November 1956. At the time, the Third Air Force {{was responsible for the}} only <b>tactical</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> in Europe, so Wilson was a logical choice as commander. After returning to the United States in July 1957, he became the Air Force member of the Weapons Systems Evaluation Group in the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Development. He was promoted to lieutenant general on 1 July 1958 when he became Deputy Chief of Staff, Development. In a reorganization of the area on 1 July 1961, he became Deputy Chief of Staff, Research and Technology.|$|E
5|$|The Ilyushin Il-40 (NATO {{reporting}} name: Brawny) was a two-seat Soviet jet-engined armored ground-attack aircraft. The first prototype flew in 1953 and {{was very}} successful except when it fired its guns, as their combustion gasses disturbed the airflow into the engines and caused them to flameout or hiccup. Remedying this problem took over a year and involved the radical change of moving the engine air intakes {{all the way to}} the very front of the aircraft and repositioning the guns from the tip of the nose to the bottom of the fuselage, just behind the nosewheel. The aircraft, now resembling a double-barreled shotgun from the front, was ordered into production in 1955. Only five production aircraft had been completed before the entire program was canceled in early 1956 when the VVS discarded its close air-support doctrine in favor of <b>tactical</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> on the battlefield.|$|E
5|$|The {{intention}} was to rationalise the industry to cut costs, and the government offered incentives for amalgamation through promises of contracts for new aircraft orders for the armed forces. At the time, the RAF were looking to replace the English Electric Canberra light bomber in the long-range interdictor role, and the Hawker Hunter in the close air support role, while the Royal Navy sought an aircraft to assume the fleet air defence role from the de Havilland Sea Vixen. BAC, through its English Electric subsidiary, had begun developing a new high-performance strike aircraft, the TSR-2, which was intended for long-range, low-level strike missions with conventional and <b>tactical</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons,</b> as well as tactical reconnaissance. Hawker Siddeley was also developing a new aircraft, based on its P.1127 V/STOL demonstrator. The P.1154 was proposed as a supersonic version that could be marketed to both the RAF and Royal Navy to fulfil a number of roles: close air support, air superiority and fleet air defence.|$|E

5|$|In {{order to}} {{increase}} the mission range and flight time for Vulcan operations, in-flight refuelling capabilities were added in 1959 onwards; several Valiant bombers were refurbished as tankers to refuel the Vulcans. Continuous airborne patrols proved untenable, however, and the refuelling mechanisms across the Vulcan fleet fell into disuse in the 1960s. Both Vulcans and the other V-force aircraft routinely visited the Far East, in particular Singapore, where a fully equipped nuclear weapons storage facility had been constructed in 1959. During the Indonesiaâ€“Malaysia confrontation Britain planned to deploy three squadrons of V-bomber aircraft and 48 Red Beard <b>tactical</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> to the region; although this was ultimately decided against, Vulcans trained in the region for both conventional and nuclear missions. Britain regularly deployed Vulcans to the Far East {{as a part of}} their contribution to SEATO operations, often to test the defenses of friendly nations in joint exercises. In the early 1970s, the RAF decided to permanently deploy two squadrons of Vulcans overseas in the Near East Air Force Bomber Wing, based at RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus; the Vulcans were withdrawn as Cypriot intercommunal violence intensified in the mid-1970s.|$|E
25|$|The Washington Times {{wrote on}} January 3, 2001, citing {{anonymous}} intelligence reports, that Russia had transferred <b>tactical</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> into {{a military base}} in Kaliningrad {{for the first time}} since the end of the Cold War. Russian top-level military leaders denied those claims. A Pentagon spokesperson said that such deployment would violate the Russian pledge to remove nuclear weapons from the Baltics. Russia and the United States announced in 1991 and 1992 a non-binding agreement to reduce arsenals of <b>tactical</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons.</b>|$|E
25|$|Until 1992 UK forces also {{deployed}} US <b>tactical</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> {{as part of}} a US-UK dual-key NATO nuclear sharing role.

25|$|When Japan {{asserted}} that nuclear weapons {{must be removed}} after reversion, they were withdrawn from sites in Okinawa during the early 1970s. Kristensen writes that criticisms following a 1969 Far East visit by a U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee prompted the JCS in 1974 to order {{a study of the}} forward-deployed <b>tactical</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> at East Asian bases. The study found the number of sites could be reduced because they had had more weapons than required, as well as that response teams at sites with nuclear weapons were unprepared for a coordinated attack and might be vulnerable to terrorists. Following the JCS order, the Department of Defense began withdrawing U.S. <b>tactical</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> from Taiwan in 1974, and from the Philippines in 1976. Kristensen writes that the DOD withdrawal of forward-deployed weapons was 'not simply' due to the sovereignty-return negotiations.|$|E

25|$|In January 2001, as George W. Bush {{prepared}} to take office, Hadley served on a panel for nuclear weapons issues sponsored by the National Institute for Public Policy, a conservative think tank. Other members of the panel included Stephen Cambone, William Schneider, and Robert Joseph. This panel advocated using <b>tactical</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> as a standard part of the United States defense arsenal.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to this, the U.S. military can also deploy smaller <b>tactical</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> either through cruise missiles or with conventional fighter-bombers. The U.S. maintains about 400 nuclear gravity bombs capable of use by F-15, F-16, and F-35. Some 350 of these bombs are deployed at seven airbases in six European NATO countries; of these, 180 tactical B61 nuclear bombs fall under a nuclear sharing arrangement.|$|E

25|$|The {{opening of}} the Cold War and fears of an attack by the Soviet Union led to {{increasing}} interest in Sweden possessing its own nuclear arsenal. They were only interested in <b>tactical</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> {{that would be used}} in a defensive role on Swedish territory or nearby seas. For reasons not directly related to security, Sweden never considered strategic nuclear weapons that could reach the Soviet Union. British and U.S. ideas heavily influenced the Swedish Armed Forcesâ€™ doctrinal thinking at that time.|$|E
25|$|In 1999, at {{the start}} of the Second Chechen War, Zhirinovsky, an ardent {{supporter}} of the first war in Chechnya in the mid-1990s, advocated hitting some Chechen villages with <b>tactical</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons.</b> He has also advocated using nuclear weapons and naval blockade-imposed starvation in the event of a Russian war against Japan. In 2008, during the resulting political row between the United Kingdom and Russia, he suggested dropping nuclear bombs over the Atlantic Ocean in an effort to flood Britain.|$|E
25|$|At one time, the Soviet Union {{maintained}} the world's largest nuclear arsenal in history. According to estimates by the Natural Resources Defense Council, {{the peak of}} approximately 45,000 warheads was reached in 1986. Roughly 20,000 of these {{were believed to be}} <b>tactical</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons,</b> reflecting the Red Army doctrine that favored the use of these weapons if war came in Europe. The remainder (approximately 25,000) were strategic ICBMs. These weapons were considered both offensive and defensive in nature.
