5|$|Cristina is re-hired and Owen {{asks for}} a divorce once Cristina wants to reconcile. Shocked, Cristina agrees, but later finds out that the {{potential}} conflict of interest regarding the plane crash lawsuit was a key motive behind Owen's request and confronts him. Owen tells her that he 'feels responsible' and was worried as {{he thought she was}} dead. They have a sexual relationship after divorcing. The hospital is sued and found guilty of negligence. The surviving doctors, including Yang, must receive $15 million of compensation each, which leads the hospital to a near bankruptcy as the insurers refuse to pay. Yang, Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez), and the other surviving doctors buy the hospital {{with the help of the}} Harper-Avery Foundation to prevent it from closing, and each become members of the new directing board. After buying the hospital, Yang realizes that she was made for the O.R. and breaks <b>things</b> <b>off</b> with Owen because he still wants kids and she still doesn't.|$|E
5|$|The Yankees {{immediately}} {{took advantage}} of Sherdel {{in the top of}} the tenth inning. Koenig led <b>things</b> <b>off</b> by singling into left field. Sherdel threw a wild pitch to Ruth, and Koenig advanced to second base. Ruth then walked, and Meusel followed with a sacrifice bunt straight to pitcher Sherdel. Meusel was out at first base, but Ruth and Koenig were safe at second and third base, respectively. Gehrig was intentionally walked, loading the bases. Lazzeri hit a fly ball to left field, and Koenig tagged up on the play to score a run and give the Yankees a one-run lead. Mike Gazella, in place of Joe Dugan at third base, was hit by a pitch from Sherdel. With the bases loaded again, Severeid popped up to second baseman Rogers Hornsby to end the Yankee rally. The Cardinals got a single from Thevenow in the bottom of the tenth inning, but they could not score any runs. The game ended with the Yankees winning by a score of 3–2. Both Pennock and Sherdel pitched ten-inning complete games. Sherdel gave up nine hits and two earned runs, while walking five and striking out two. Pennock finished the game giving up just seven hits and two runs, while striking out four batters.|$|E

However, England were unable to finish <b>things</b> <b>off</b> and Chaminda Vaas, who had shown resistance batting throughout the series, added 92 runs with the last two wickets. Muttiah Muralitharan hit 3 fours and 1 six in a very useful cameo, which included some remarkable shots. This late flurry of runs would prove critical in the match.|$|E

The Irish had reached 89/5 from 38.1 overs when it rained, and the Duckworth–Lewis method was used to {{calculate}} a target of 131 from 38 overs for the South Africans, who won by making 133/6. South Africa then bowled out Bangladesh for a paltry 79 and made 80/5 for a five-wicket victory, before rounding <b>things</b> <b>off</b> against Barbados. The Barbadians set a useful 254/6 (Wallace 74), but 71 from Kallis and 54 from Gibbs saw their opponents through to 257/6 with ten balls remaining.|$|E

After a horror start to the series, he came back strongly, capping <b>things</b> <b>off</b> with 267 in the final Test. It was his highest Test score that came off 504 balls in the first innings, to set up a series levelling victory in Bangalore.|$|E
25|$|England made six {{changes and}} one of the newcomers, Harold Rhodes, took wickets with his fourth and twelfth balls in Test cricket to reduce India to 23 for four, with new wicketkeeper Roy Swetman taking three catches. Later Indian batsmen did better, but no one reached 30 on a bland wicket. England's new opening pair of Gilbert Parkhouse and Geoff Pullar put on 146 for the first wicket, and then Cowdrey and Barrington put on 193 for the fourth wicket, Cowdrey going on to make 160.

On 9 July 2013, the {{official}} press conference took place to announce the fight. Cleverly, as champion, was given the underdog status by bookmakers. Cleverly said he had trained hard and was expecting the fight to be toughest of his career so far.

Kovalev picked things right back up in the fourth, throwing bombs to send Cleverly down {{for a third time}} and the referee waved <b>things</b> <b>off</b> 29 seconds into the round. Cleverly considered retiring after the bout, but decided not to. In October 2013, Cleverly told the Daily Mirror that he wanted to rematch Kovalev.|$|E

25|$|The most {{prominent}} {{struggle for power}} was the conflict that erupted {{after the death of}} Yaroslav the Wise. The rivaling Principality of Polotsk was contesting the power of the Grand Prince by occupying Novgorod, while Rostislav Vladimirovich was fighting for the Black Sea port of Tmutarakan belonging to Chernihiv. Three of Yaroslav's sons that first allied together found themselves fighting each other especially after their defeat to the Cuman forces in 1068 at the Battle of the Alta River. At the same time an uprising took place in Kiev, bringing to power Vseslav of Polotsk who supported the traditional Slavic paganism. The ruling Grand Prince Iziaslav fled to Poland asking for support and in couple of years returned to establish the order. The affairs became even more complicated {{by the end of the}} 11th century driving the state into chaos and constant warfare. On the initiative of Vladimir II Monomakh in 1097 the first federal council of Kievan Rus took place near Chernihiv in the city of Liubech with the main intention to find an understanding among the fighting sides. However even though that did not really stop the fighting, it certainly cooled <b>things</b> <b>off.</b>|$|E

Instead of going back home, Cameron chooses to relocate to Salem permanently, mainly to stay close Theo and Abby, despite Celeste warning him against getting involved with her. However, Abby is afraid to get too serious with Cameron believing he will eventually leave town.

500|$|Although [...] "Angel of Death" [...] did not chart, it {{was highly}} praised by critics {{reviewing}} Reign in Blood.

[...] When asked why Reign in Blood has retained its popularity, King replied: [...] "If you released Reign in Blood today, no one would give a shit. It was timing; it was a change in sound.

500|$|The game uses an {{optimized}} {{version of}} the Dinosaur Hunter engine, which allowed developers to create environments with more complex geometry and incorporate a lighting system where light sources could cast shadows on objects in real-time. The game's distance fog was reduced and disguised as an atmospheric effect, resulting in players {{being able to see}} five time as far than they could in the original game. The game's progression, focus on exploration and mission objectives were inspired by the Mario and Zelda franchises. As Dienstbier explained, [...] "That's something that we learned from Miyamoto: Start <b>things</b> <b>off</b> simple and gradually add to it as you progress. Later objectives will make far more use of the dynamic environments." [...] Unlike the original game, where levels shared graphic assets, Seeds of Evil features unique levels with different geometry, textures and enemies.|$|E

Both Daltrey and Townshend felt they had to describe the plot in detail to the audience, which took up valuable time on stage. A few shows later in Newcastle upon Tyne, the backing tapes to [...] "5:15" [...] came in late. Townshend stopped the show, grabbed Pridden, who was controlling the mixing desk, and dragged him onstage, shouting obscenities at him. Townshend subsequently picked {{up some of the}} tapes and threw them over the stage, kicked his amplifier over, and walked off. The band returned 20 minutes later, playing older material.
