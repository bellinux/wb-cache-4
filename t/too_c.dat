We find that the simulations predict far <b>too</b> little <b>C</b> IV absorption unless the UVB is extremely soft, and always predict far <b>too</b> small <b>C</b> III/C IV ratios. We note, however, that much of the enriched gas is in a phase (T ∼ 10 5 − 10 7 K, ρ/〈ρ 〉 ∼ 0. 1 − 10, Z � 0. 1 Z⊙) that should cool by metal line emission – which was not included in our simulations. When the effect of cooling is modeled, the predicted C IV absorption increases substantially, but the C III/C IV ratios are still far too small because the density of the enriched gas is too low. Finally, we find that the predicted metal distribution is much too inhomogeneous to reproduce the observed probability distribution of C IV absorption. These findings suggest that strong z � 6 winds cannot fully explain the observed enrichment, and that an additional (perhaps higher-z) contribution is required.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{excitation}} energy transfer between light-harvesting complex I (LH-I) and the photosynthetic reaction center (RC) of the purple bacterium Rhodobacter (Rb.) sphaeroides is investigated {{on the basis}} of the atomic level structures of the two proteins, assuming a ring-shaped model for LH-I. Rates of {{excitation energy}} transfer are calculated, based on Förster theory. The LH-I and RC electronic excitations are described through effective Hamiltonians established previously, with parameters derived from quantum chemistry calculations by Cory and co-workers. We also present an effective Hamiltonian description with parameters based on spectroscopic properties. We study two extreme models of LH-I excitations: electronic excitations delocalized over the entire LH-I ring and excitations localized on single bacteriochlorophylls. The role of accessory bacteriochlorophylls in bridging the excitation energy transfer is investigated. The rates of back-transfer, i. e., RC!

40|$|International audienceWe {{study the}} breakup of an {{axisymmetric}} low viscosity liquid volume (ethanol and water), held by surface tension on supporting rods, when subject to a vigorous axial stretching. One of the rods is promptly set into a fast axial motion, either with constant acceleration, or constant velocity, and we aim at describing the remnant mass m adhering to it. A thin ligament is withdrawn from the initial liquid volume, which eventually breaks up at time t(b). We find that the breakup time and entrained mass are related by t(b) similar to root m/sigma, where sigma is the liquid surface tension. For a constant acceleration gamma, and although the overall process is driven by surface tension, t(b) {{is found to be}} independent of sigma, while m is inversely proportional to gamma.

40|$|Hydrogenated {{amorphous}} silicon carbon (a-SiC:H) ultra thin films obtained by Hot wire {{chemical vapor deposition}} (HWCVD) {{have been shown to}} act as efficient diffusion barriers for copper on inter metal dielectric (IMD) layers which are of great significance for ultra-large scale integration (ULSI) circuits. In this work, we have studied the influence of the a-SiC:H barrier layer obtained by HWCVD which has implications towards issues related to the resistance to electromigration of Cu in the low dielectric (low-k) hydrogen silsesquioxane (HSQ) film. The presence of the ultra thin a-SiC:H film maintains the integrity of the Cu metal not only by suppressing Cu diffusion but also by increasing its crystallinity, which would have implications with respect to the mean time to failure (MTF) arising from metal electromigration. Though, we demonstrate this aspect on the low-k (HSQ) /Cu system, this should yield similar benefits for other low-k dielectric materials <b>too.</b> (<b>c)</b> 2007 Elsevier B. V.

For this purpose, both liquids were processed with four types of ultrafiltration (100, 25, 10 and 2 kDa) and one nanofiltration membranes under optimum transmembrane pressure. Retention coefficients and performance parameters were monitored for each experiment. The membranes of 25 and 100 kDa showed very satisfying results with regard to the concentration of pectin solutions as they were able to separate it from cations and phenols. The membrane of 25 kDa was also able to partially remove the heavier fragments of hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives and flavonols, and simultaneously to sustain the antioxidant properties of the phenol containing beverage in the permeate stream.
