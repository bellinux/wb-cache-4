This report is the result of 3 months long practical desk work of the Premier Bank Ltd, Head Office. Premier Bank Limited has started its journey as a private commercial bank on June 10, 1999. The bank has 92 branches throughout Bangladesh. The Premier Bank {{is one of the largest}} private commercial bank of the country.

It is one important area that influences a number of employees' attitudes and behavior such as intent to leave, levels of job satisfaction, and organizational commitment. Human resource management practices are those that create trust in employees and these practices include giving employees empowerment and involvement in decision making; extensive communication about functioning and performance of the employees service; designing training for skills and personal development of employees; selective hiring; team-working; rewards system that commensurate with effort; reduction of status between the management and staff and all workers are valued regardless of their role. In this new era, people are the primary source for a organization’s competitive advantage and organizational prosperity and survival depends on how employees are treated. The report contains my practical observation on an experience in Premier Bank Limited Human Resources Division, Head Office, Dhaka. Before going to the analysis, it is necessary to have some knowledge about the bank. For this purpose an overview of the Premier Bank has been made.

While running practical orientation with PBL Motijheel Branch; generally I was placed in Credit, Foreign Exchange & General Banking. This report tries to identify Consumer credit scheme of PBL. Bank credit is an important catalyst for bringing about economic development in a country. Without adequate finance, {{there can be no}} growth or maintenance of a stable economy. It provides different types of credit facilities to its customers like Overdraft (against work order), Cash Credit (Hypothecation), Cash credit (Pledge), Loan Against <b>Trust</b> <b>Receipt</b> (LTR), Loan Against Imported Merchandise (LIM), Demand Draft Purchase (DDP), IBP (Inland Bill Purchase), IT loan, Consumer Credit scheme, Executives Car Loan, House Finance is the main spring of the credit department and some Special credit. My report based on Consumer Credit Scheme spring of the credit department. Prime Bank Limited introduced “Consumer Credit Scheme” in the year 1995 to enhance the living standard of the people of limited and fixed income group. It provides financing for the purpose of purchasing household products, car, and equipment for medical services etc. It also provides CCS loan to meet emergency needs, to arrange marriage, to enjoy vacation, to meet educational expenses and to convert a vehicle engine into CNG. In this report, the total credit portfolio of Prime Bank has been shown that indicated a positive growing trend in the retail credit amount disbursed. Again, in terms of interest income, retail credit is also accounting an increasing trend. One of the crucial parts of this report is that, Prime Bank Consumer Credit scheme has been compared with other three similar second generation banks like Eastern Bank, Dhaka Bank and National Credit and Commerce Bank in some aspects to understand the current position in the market. From the comparison with three second generation banks, some problems and prospects are found in Prime Bank Retail Credit. The most important prospects of Prime Bank Retail credit are that, it has diversified product portfolio and lowest rates in different charges of retail credit which is the strength of Prime Bank to proceed further in retail credit business. Again, Prime Bank has a few problem regarding target client segments and promotional activities that should be rectified. Overall, there are huge opportunities for Prime Bank to develop and enter in retail credit market. The popularity of Consumer Credit Scheme is increasing day by day. This product is popular because Bank can disburse this loan within a short time, with fewer amounts and the loan is also easily recoverable. Keeping the popularity to Consumer Credit Scheme in mind, most of banks are offering this product. So competition is increasing day by day in CCS program. Md. Mehrear Rahman ChowdhuryB.

In biological assays, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) is often included as a co-solvent to dissolve organic molecules. While low levels of DMSO are known to reduce the charge of protein ions generated by ESI, the exact mechanism by which this occurs has been debated. In this study, we describe the first application of IM–MS to study the effect of DMSO subcharging on native protein conformation. We find that at low concentrations, DMSO induces modest (1 - 2 [*]%), but repeatable, reductions in protein collision-cross sections (CCSs) of four different protein complexes, avidin, concanavalin A, alcohol dehydrogenase, and pyruvate kinase, as measured by traveling-wave (TW) IM–MS.

40|$|In {{order to}} ease the burden on workers during the {{retirement}} {{of the baby boom}} generation, the 1983 Social Security Reforms set payroll taxes above the level needed to pay current benefits, thus partially prefunding the baby boomers' retirement. The military and civil service retirement programs followed suit in the mid- 1980 s and switched from pay-as-you-go financing to funded systems. The excess income generated by these retirement programs was held in the federal trust funds, which have accumulated almost $ 3 trillion since the reforms took place. However, this paper presents evidence that the trust fund build-up may not help future generations due to the adoption of the Unified Budget in 1970. The Unified Budget includes <b>trust</b> fund <b>receipts</b> as income and trust fund payments as expenditures. The empirical evidence suggests that attempts to balance the Unified Budget while the trust funds were generating surpluses has led to increased government spending and personal and corporation income tax cuts within the rest of the federal government. There is no evidence of increased government saving {{as a result of the}} trust fund accumulations. An alternate theory of increased national saving is also explored, where increased payroll taxes accompanied by decreased income taxes induces higher personal saving. This mechanism, suggested by Diamond, also does not appear to have significantly enhanced the wealth of future generations. ...|$|R
40|$|In trust {{negotiation}} {{approaches to}} authorization, previously unacquainted entities establish trust {{in one another}} gradually via the bilateral and iterative exchange of policies and digital credentials. Although this affords resource providers with an expressive means of access control for open systems, the trust negotiation process incurs non-trivial computational and communications costs. In this paper, we propose Receipt-Mode Trust Negotiation (RMTN) {{as a means of}} mitigating the performance penalties on servers that use trust negotiation. RMTN provides a means of off-loading the majority of the trust negotiation process to delegated receipt-generating helper servers. RMTN ensures that helpers produce correct <b>trust</b> negotiation protocol <b>receipts,</b> and that the helpers are incapable of impersonating the resource server outside of the RMTN protocol. We describe an initial implementation of our RMTN protocol on a Linux testbed, discuss the security of this protocol, and present experimental results indicating that the receipt-mode protocol does indeed enhance the performance of resource servers that rely on trust negotiation approaches to authorization.

50|$|Goldsmiths in England {{had been}} craftsmen, bullion merchants, money changers and money lenders since the 16th century. But {{they were not}} the first to act as {{financial}} intermediates; in the early 17th century, the scriveners were the first to keep deposits {{for the express purpose of}} relending them. Merchants and traders had amassed huge hoards of gold and entrusted their wealth to the Royal Mint for storage. In 1640 King Charles I seized the private gold stored in the mint as a forced loan (which was to be paid back over time). Thereafter merchants preferred to store their gold with the goldsmiths of London, who possessed private vaults, and charged a fee for that service. In exchange for each deposit of precious metal, the goldsmiths issued receipts certifying the quantity and purity of the metal they held as a bailee (i.e. in <b>trust).</b> These <b>receipts</b> could not be assigned (only the original depositor could collect the stored goods). Gradually the goldsmiths took over the function of the scriveners of relending on behalf of a depositor and also developed modern banking practices; promissory notes were issued for money deposited which by custom and/or law was a loan to the goldsmith, i.e. the depositor expressly allowed the goldsmith to use the money for any purpose including advances to his customers. The goldsmith charged no fee, or even paid interest on these deposits. Since the promissory notes were payable on demand, and the advances (loans) to the goldsmith's customers were repayable over a longer time period, this was an early form of fractional reserve banking. The promissory notes developed into an assignable instrument, which could circulate as a safe and convenient form of money backed by the goldsmith's promise to pay. Hence goldsmiths could advance loans in the form of gold money, or in the form of promissory notes, or in the form of checking accounts. Gold deposits were relatively stable, often remaining with the goldsmith for years on end, so there was little risk of default so long as public trust in the goldsmith's integrity and financial soundness was maintained. Thus, the goldsmiths of London became the forerunners of British banking and prominent creators of new money based on credit.|$|R
