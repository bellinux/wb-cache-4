500|$|Mark Bego, {{author of}} Madonna: Blonde Ambition wrote that [...] "Spotlight" [...] was a [...] "typical Madonna 'look-at-me' dance routine, that sounds flat besides the heavy remixes in You Can Dance." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine from Allmusic {{said that the}} song [...] "sounds dated—this is quite clearly {{extended}} mixes from the mid 80's—but that's part of the charm." [...] Dave Barry from The Miami Herald commented that although You Can Dance sounds like [...] "old Madonna", [...] "Spotlight" [...] sounds surprisingly fresh <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>ears.</b> Joe Brown from The Washington Post commented that the song {{should have been a}} [...] "flat reject". Don McLeese from Chicago Sun-Times called the song [...] "exuberant". Dennis Hunt from Los Angeles Times commented that [...] " [...] is an attractive package for dance fans—particularly with the inclusion of a new cut, 'Spotlight'". He went on to add that the [...] "lyrics of 'Spotlight' aren't great, but they're still more interesting than the others. Still, the words, like those of most dance songs, are just window dressing that's secondary to the beat. The big attraction of 'Spotlight' is a long, hard-driving, closing passage that's guaranteed to turn dancers on." [...] Jan DeKnock, while writing for Orlando Sentinel, noted that the song was already receiving airplay from radio stations.|$|E

2500|$|Paul began {{suffering}} from arthritis in the mid-1960s. As he got older, the condition worsened, {{and in his}} final years he lost much {{of the use of}} his right hand except the ring and pinky fingers. In 1969, he began to lose his hearing. He had difficulty tuning guitars properly due <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>ears</b> [...] "misinterpreting" [...] pitch. Frustrated with the quality of most hearing aids, he set to work designing his own and was still at the job when he died. He once joked that [...] "Audio engineers and musicians are the two kinds of people that hearing aid manufacturers fear the most." ...|$|E

2500|$|The song [...] "Make You Feel My Love" [...] was {{recorded}} twice {{under the title}} [...] "To Make You Feel My Love" [...] by other artists: Billy Joel recorded the song for his Greatest Hits Volume III collection before Dylan released the song; subsequently, Garth Brooks recorded it for the Hope Floats soundtrack. It {{was recorded}} under the original title by Bryan Ferry on Dylanesque and by Adele on 19. This song was criticized for its lyrical inferiority by Robert Christgau and Greg Kot of Rolling Stone. In his review, Kot described the track as [...] "a spare ballad undermined by greetingcard lyrics [...] breaks the album's spell". Opposing his view, Dylan critic Paul Williams {{said that it was}} [...] "refreshing" [...] <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>ears.</b> He said: [...] "...the ultimate effect is to strengthen the spell the whole record casts—this musical and verbal break is exactly in place." ...|$|E
2500|$|When Figo {{returned}} to Barcelona {{for the first}} time in a Real Madrid shirt on 21 October 2000, the noise at Camp Nou was deafening. There were banners hung around the stadium with words like [...] "Traitor", [...] "Judas", [...] "Scum", and [...] "Mercenary". Figo was mercilessly taunted throughout, and when he came out of the tunnel and ran onto the field the jeers of almost 98,000 Barcelona fans escalated, with a visibly shocked Figo putting his fingers <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>ears.</b> When El Clásico started, each time Figo got the ball the noise rose with insults and missiles flying such as oranges, bottles, cigarette lighters and mobile phones. The regular corner taker for Madrid, Figo did not take any corners at the Camp Nou to avoid being in close proximity to the fans. Barcelona were victorious, winning 2–0, and Real Madrid President Florentino Pérez stated after the match, [...] "The atmosphere got to us all." [...] Madrid defender Iván Campo commented, [...] "That night when Figo first went back was incredible. I’ve never heard anything like it. Luís didn't deserve that. He'd given his all for Barcelona. It was built up before: 'a traitor’s coming,' the media said. No, Luís Figo is coming, one of the greats for you. That night hurt him, you could see. His head was bowed and he was thinking: 'bloody hell, I was here last season ...' But my lasting emotion was admiration: you’ve got balls." ...|$|E
