5|$|Through February, Grand Duke Alexander, Duma President Rodzianko and Michael {{pressured}} Nicholas and Alexandra {{to yield}} to popular demands. Public unrest grew and, on 27 February, soldiers in Petrograd joined demonstrators, elements of the military mutinied and prisoners were freed. Nicholas, who was at army headquarters in Mogilev, prorogued <b>the</b> <b>Duma,</b> but the deputies refused to leave and instead {{set up their own}} rival government. After consulting Rodzianko at the Mariinsky Palace in Petrograd, Michael advised Nicholas to dismiss his ministers and set up a new government led by the leader of the majority party in <b>the</b> <b>Duma.</b> His advice was supported by General Mikhail Alekseyev, Nicholas's chief of staff. Nicholas rejected the suggestion and issued futile orders for troops to move on Petrograd.|$|E
5|$|After {{the end of}} the Russo-Japanese War the Imperial Russian Navy was in a {{state of}} confusion. Its leadership, tactics and ship designs had all been cast into disrepute by its {{repeated}} defeats by the Japanese at the Battle of Tsushima, Battle off Ulsan and the Battle of the Yellow Sea. The Navy took quite some time to absorb the design lessons from the war while the government reformed the Naval Ministry and forced many of its more conservative officers to retire. It conducted a design contest for a dreadnought in 1906, but <b>the</b> <b>Duma</b> refused to authorize it, preferring to spend the money on rebuilding the Army.|$|E
5|$|All four {{ships were}} laid down on 16 June 1909, {{but this was}} just a {{ceremonial}} event as actual work did not begin until September–October. One major complication was that the design for the turrets and their magazines was not completed when construction began so their weights and dimensions had to be estimated. The machinery for these ships was built by either the Baltic Works or the Franco-Russian Works as the New Admiralty Shipyard lacked its own engine shop. Construction was initially very slow because <b>the</b> <b>Duma</b> did not allocate any money for these ships until May 1911. Initial funding was taken from other budget items or the emperor's discretionary fund and the shipyards had to use their own money to keep the work going. They were enormously expensive with their cost estimated at 29.4 million rubles each, including armament. By way of comparison the preceding class of pre-dreadnoughts had only cost 11 million rubles each. Once <b>the</b> <b>Duma</b> provided the funding the pace of work accelerated and the ships were launched later that year, although delays in the delivery of engines and turrets hindered their completion. All of the ships completed abbreviated trials by the end of 1914 and reached the fleet in December 1914 – January 1915.|$|E
50|$|After {{the merger}} with the Gould School District, <b>the</b> <b>Dumas</b> {{district}} inherited <b>the</b> Gould school facilities.

5|$|Elected to the State Duma of the Russian Federation in December 1995 as an independent, Ryzhkov {{subsequently}} led the Power to the People block, later {{becoming the}} formal {{leader of the}} People's Patriotic Union of Russia alongside Gennady Zyuganov, who was an unofficial leader.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Duma</b> {{approved}} {{construction in}} May 1912, before the design was finalised, and allocated 45.5 million rubles for each ship. However, {{the increase in}} armaments and consequential increase {{in the size of}} the ships raised their estimated cost by seven million rubles each, and some money was diverted from the budget for the s. Orders were placed on 18 September 1912 for a pair of ships each from the New Admiralty Shipyard and the Baltic Works. The first pair was to be ready for trials on 14 July 1916 and the second pair on 14 September 1916.|$|E
5|$|In April 1908, during Edward's annual stay at Biarritz, he {{accepted}} the resignation of British Prime Minister Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman. In a break with precedent, Edward asked Campbell-Bannerman's successor, H. H. Asquith, to travel to Biarritz to kiss hands. Asquith complied, but the press criticised {{the action of the}} King in appointing a prime minister on foreign soil instead of returning to Britain. In June 1908, Edward became the first reigning British monarch to visit the Russian Empire, despite refusing to visit in 1906, when Anglo-Russian relations were strained {{in the aftermath of the}} Russo-Japanese War, the Dogger Bank incident, and the Tsar's dissolution of <b>the</b> <b>Duma.</b> The previous month, Edward visited the Scandinavian countries, becoming the first British monarch to visit Sweden.|$|E
50|$|In 2004 the Arkansas Legislature {{approved}} {{a law that}} forced school districts with fewer than 350 students apiece to consolidate with other districts. As a result, on July 1, 2004, the Gould School District was merged into <b>the</b> <b>Dumas</b> district. At <b>the</b> time of the merger, according to a June 30, 2004 audit report, the Gould district had a $322,873 deficit. <b>The</b> <b>Dumas</b> district inherited <b>the</b> Gould district's deficit. Thomas Cox, the superintendent of <b>the</b> <b>Dumas</b> district, opposed <b>the</b> merger; in May 2004 he told the Arkansas Board of Education that it would increase the racial imbalance in the school district as African-American percentage of <b>the</b> <b>Dumas</b> district would increase from 64% to 68%; {{at the time the}} Gould district was 99% African-American. The former superintendent of the Gould district became an assistant superintendent of <b>the</b> <b>Dumas</b> district.|$|R
5|$|Rudy Giecek {{claims that}} <b>the</b> <b>Dumas</b> {{is haunted by}} the ghost of Elinore Knott. Author Karen Stevens also {{recalled}} paranormal experiences related to the brothel. It is suggested that Knott's ghost {{is one of several}} at <b>the</b> <b>Dumas.</b>|$|R

5|$|Michael {{and other}} members of the {{imperial}} family, including Grand Dukes Alexander, George, Nicholas and Dmitri and Grand Duchess Elizabeth, warned of the growing public unrest, and of the perception that Nicholas was governed by his German-born wife Alexandra and the self-styled holy man Rasputin. Nicholas and Alexandra refused to listen. In December 1916, Dmitri and four of his friends killed Rasputin. Michael learned of the murder at Brasovo, where he was spending Christmas with his family. On 28 December, according to the French ambassador, there was a failed attempt to assassinate Alexandra; the lone assailant was caught and hanged the next day. <b>The</b> <b>Duma</b> President Mikhail Rodzianko, Grand Duchess Marie Pavlovna and British ambassador Buchanan joined calls for Alexandra to be removed from influence, but Nicholas still refused to take their advice. Plots and gossip against Nicholas and Alexandra continued to build.|$|E
5|$|The Communist Party {{strongly}} supported {{the restoration of}} Alexandrov's melody, but some members proposed other changes to the anthem. In March 2010, Boris Kashin, a CPRF member of <b>the</b> <b>Duma,</b> advocated {{for the removal of}} any reference to God in the anthem. Kashin's suggestion was also supported by Alexander Nikonov, a journalist with SPID-INFO and an avowed atheist. Nikonov argued that religion should be a private matter and should not be used by the state. Kashin found that the cost for making a new anthem recording will be about 120,000rubles. The Russian Government quickly rejected the request because it lacked statistical data and other findings. Nikonov asked the Constitutional Court of Russia in 2005 if the lyrics were compatible with Russian law.|$|E
5|$|The anthem is {{mandatory}} at the swearing-in of the President of Russia, for {{opening and closing}} sessions of <b>the</b> <b>Duma</b> and the Federation Council, and for official state ceremonies. It is played on television and radio {{at the beginning and}} end of the broadcast day. If programming is continuous, the anthem is played once at 0600 hours and again at midnight. The anthem is also played on New Year's Eve after the New Year Address by the President. It is played at sporting events in Russia and abroad, according to the protocol of the organisation hosting the games. According to the law, when the anthem is played officially, everybody must stand up (in case the national flag is raising, facing to the flag), men must remove their headgear (in practice, excluding those in military uniform and clergymen). Uniformed personnel must give a military salute when the anthem plays.|$|E

5|$|Lenin had {{not wanted}} {{to return to the}} Russian Empire, fearing arrest. He changed his opinion when Tsar Nicholas II {{accepted}} a series of liberal reforms in his October Manifesto, with Lenin believing that these would protect him from the Okhrana. Thus, Lenin and his wife returned to Russia in cognito via Sweden and Finland, moving between different safe houses in St. Petersburg, from which he monitored events and wrote up many of his ideas on the progress of the revolution. He was invited to join the editorial board of Novaya Zhizn (New Life), a radical legal newspaper run by Maxim Gorky's wife M.F. Andreyeva, and used this as a vehicle to discuss issues facing the RSDLP. He encouraged the party to seek out a much wider membership, and also advocated the continual escalation of violent confrontation, believing both to be necessary for the revolution to succeed. However, after the armed Moscow Uprising failed, Lenin began to urge the party to stand in elections for <b>the</b> <b>Duma,</b> believing that this would raise the party's public profile. At a Bolshevik Congress in Tampere, Finland, Lenin first met young Bolshevik Joseph Stalin. He also changed his mind {{on the issue of the}} Mensheviks, and began calling for reconciliation between the party's two factions. Members of both groups met at the 4th Party Congress in Stockholm, Sweden in April 1906 where the Mensheviks condemned Lenin for supporting bank robberies and encouraging violence. The Congress resulted in the election of a new Central Committee comprising 7 Mensheviks and 3 Bolsheviks.|$|E

500|$|When Lillian Walden {{retired in}} 1950, {{the price for}} {{a woman at the}} brothel was $5. Afterwards, the Dumas's {{operations}} went to Elinore Knott. The Nadeaus also ceased being owners of the brothel around this time. Knott's management of <b>the</b> <b>Dumas</b> was short. In 1955 she committed suicide after her lover died of a heart attack. When the late 1960s came about, several local police officers were taking the initiative to close the three operating high-class sex houses: Hotel Victoria, Windsor Hotel and <b>the</b> <b>Dumas.</b> <b>The</b> <b>Dumas</b> did not remain closed for long however, with its next madam, Bonita Farren, operating it from 1955 until her death from cancer in 1969. In 1970 <b>the</b> <b>Dumas</b> was listed in the National Register of Historic Places as a [...] "Victorian Brothel" [...] and an active house of prostitution. By the following year, Ruby Garret, a local resident of Butte for some thirty years, had purchased <b>the</b> <b>Dumas.</b> Garret would pay local police officers and officials $200 to $300 a month in return for their silence about the Dumas's activities. Under Garrett, the cost of a prostitute was $20. She would come upon financial difficulties however, being charged with tax evasion in 1981. <b>The</b> <b>Dumas</b> Brothel was closed the following year.|$|R

500|$|Garret sold <b>the</b> <b>Dumas</b> to an {{antiques}} dealer named Rudy Giecek on {{the condition}} that it was preserved in its original state. Giecek turned the brothel into a museum and operated it as such for most of the 1990s. However, in 1998 Giecek encountered financial difficulties and attempted to sell the building. The International Sex Worker Foundation for Art, Culture and Education (ISWFACE) responded. The ISWFACE sought to reopen <b>the</b> <b>Dumas</b> as not only a museum but also a gallery and convention center. Ellen Baumler of the National Register of Historic Places wrote in support for the rescue of <b>the</b> <b>Dumas</b> that [...] " [...] is not only significant as the last standing parlor house in this area of Butte, but also because of its length of operation as a rare, intact commentary on social history." [...] Some were against the restoration of <b>the</b> <b>Dumas,</b> including former prostitutes in Butte, but the operation proceeded—at least until September 2000, when Giecek claimed the ISWFACE owed him $52,000 in wages for work performed at <b>the</b> <b>Dumas.</b> Giecek sued and was granted the wages he petitioned for and additional penalties. The business deal with ISWFACE was terminated however. In the years that followed, <b>the</b> <b>Dumas</b> was put up for auction twice as Giecek did not have the money to maintain the building.|$|R
