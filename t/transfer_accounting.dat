40|$|The {{minimally}} invasive treatment called radio-frequency ablation (RFA) guided by imaging techniques, the doctor inserts a thin needle through the skin and into the tumor. High-frequency electrical energy delivered through this needle heats and destroys the tumor. The circuit is closed with a ground pad applied to the patient's skin. This work concerns the mathematical modeling and computer simula-tions of the heat transfer process. The core is solving the bio-heat time-dependent partial differential equation of parabolic type [1]. Both, a uni-form discretization of the considered time interval and an adaptive time-stepping procedure are applied. The last one is due to an effort to decrease the simulation time. Computer simulation on geometry obtained from a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the patient is performed.

The considered composite structures are assembled by M-Pore® cellular metals matrices and the phase change material: paraffin.

Advanced heat sink composite structures may be used for thermal energy storage as well as temperature stabilization of sensitive components. Finite element analysis on the effective thermal properties of the cellular metal is performed.

40|$|The {{potential}} of using ultrafiltration {{for separation of}} salt solutions has been explored. Solutions of phosphates were filtered through commercially available ZrO 2 ultrafiltration membranes, with a cut-off value of 15 kD. In the experiments, effects of cross flow, permeate flux, pH and ionic strength of the solution on rejection were the main items of interest. The process is modelled using the Maxwell-Stefan equations for mass <b>transfer,</b> <b>accounting</b> for the three different driving forces that govern the process (gradients in electrical potential, pressure and concentrations). The rejections observed for the phosphate ions were surprisingly high (up to 80 %) considering the cut-off Value of the membrane used. They were also strongly influenced by the ionic strength of the solution, indicating that electrical effects are important. The rejection curves are well described by the Maxwell-Stefan model, in which the charge of the membrane {{was assumed to be}} dependent upon solute concentration according to a Freundlich isotherm.

An inner pressure increase of ∼ 600  Pa gave only small changes in CMDP and DPOAE. Along with a decrease in f 1 amplitude, a small decrease in amplitude of the 2 f 1  − f 2 and a small increase in the f 2  − f 1 were measured in CM. This matches a shift from a symmetrical position of the operating point for hair cell transduction, leading {{to an increase in}} even-order distortion and a decrease in odd-order distortion. Similar, a decrease in 2 f 1  − f 2 DPOAE was expected.

40|$|In {{the present}} thesis {{the link between}} {{aerodynamics}} and heat transfer in high pressure turbines is investigated through steady numerical calculations. The investigations include the effect of wall temperature on the Heat Transfer coefficient (HTC), aiming to understand whether the conventional assumption of HTC being invariant with the thermal boundary condition does hold in a typical compressible flow, where the aerodynamic and thermal fields are strongly coupled. A novel non-linear three point method is proposed to scale wall heat <b>transfer</b> <b>accounting</b> for the dependence of HTC on wall temperature and local flow history. The effect of wall boundary condition on external aerodynamics and heat transfer calls for the need of Conjugate Heat Transfer (CHT) methods as design tools. For this reason CHT capabilities have been developed and integrated in Rolls-Royce Hydra CFD solver. The implemented CHT solver is fully-coupled, allowing for simultaneous solution of the solid and fluid domains. The implemented CHT coupling {{has been shown to}} be numerically stable with a good convergence rate for all cases tested. The implemented code has been successfully validated against both experimental, analytical and numerical data. Conjugate analysis of a double-wall trailing edge cooling design has been performed under matched external Biot conditions. Aim of the investigation has been to quantify the effect of CHT on the cooling discharge characteristics and external aerodynamics in a cooling configuration where coolant and external flow are separated by a lower thermal resistance than in a traditional internal cooling configuration. Detailed CHT results for this case are presented and discussed. </p...|$|E
40|$|MPISS is an {{automatic}} file transfer system that implements {{a combination of}} standard and mission-unique transfer protocols required by the Global Precipitation Measurement Mission (GPM) Precipitation Processing System (PPS) to control the flow of data between the MOC and the PPS. The primary features of MPISS are file transfers (both with and without PPS specific protocols), logging of file transfer and system events to local files and a standard messaging bus, short term storage of data files to facilitate retransmissions, and generation of file <b>transfer</b> <b>accounting</b> reports. The system includes a graphical user interface (GUI) to control the system, allow manual operations, and to display events in real time. The PPS specific protocols are an enhanced version of those that were developed for the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM). All file transfers between the MOC and the PPS use the SSH File Transfer Protocol (SFTP). For reports and data files generated within the MOC, no additional protocols are used when transferring files to the PPS. For observatory data files, an additional handshaking protocol of data notices and data receipts is used. MPISS generates and sends to the PPS data notices containing data start and stop times along with a checksum for the file for each observatory data file transmitted. MPISS retrieves the PPS generated data receipts that indicate {{the success or failure}} of the PPS to ingest the data file and/or notice. MPISS retransmits the appropriate files as indicated in the receipt when required. MPISS also automatically retrieves files from the PPS. The unique feature of this software is the use of both standard and PPS specific protocols in parallel. The advantage of this capability is that it supports users that require the PPS protocol as well as those that do not require it. The system is highly configurable to accommodate the needs of future users...|$|E

The tissues analyzed (blubber and melon) were from known individuals in a long-term (27 + y) study that stranded and were recovered for necropsy. Substantial demographic data were available on these individuals and utilized {{in the analysis of}} maternal transfer of organochlorines to young. The male dolphins in this study were shown to accumulate organochlorine contaminants with age. In female dolphins the organochlorine levels were found to decline with age. These results are in agreement with previous studies, with gestational and lactational <b>transfer</b> <b>accounting</b> for the decline seen in the females. A lengthening in interreproductive interval by increasing organochlorine levels after approximately age 30 y is noted in the females. For the first time, this study quantified the organochlorine levels of the first calf of a female, testing the hypothesis that the first-born of a female receives a substantially greater organochlorine load than subsequent calves. The first-born calf (age 5. 3 mo) had the highest blubber ΣPCB, total DDT, HCB, and total pesticide levels of all animals in this study. The organochlorine levels in this calf were 2 - 5 fold higher than in a similarly aged, fourth-born calf. All animals in this study had appreciable EPCBlevels (range 0. 07 - 26. 9 ug/g wet weight; 2. 6 - 203. 2 ug/g lipid weight), and EDDT (range 0. 06 - 10. 3 wet weight; 0. 9 - 88. 1 ug/g lipid weight).

40|$|First {{demonstrated}} {{on industrial}} scale in 1976, fluidized bed combustion (FBC) rapidly became an established technology for solid fuel combustion with a current installed capacity of about 30 GWe and power plants ranging from 10 to 460 MWe. The {{widespread use of}} the FBC technology both under so-called circulating and bubbling conditions (i. e. with and without external recirculation of solids) is {{generally considered to be}} due to two main advantages with respect to other competing combustion technologies: the high fuel flexibility and possibilities of cost efficient reduction of SOx and NOx emissions. Yet, the relative lack of knowledge within some of the phenomena governing the process represents a major obstacle for the further development of the FBC technology. Efficient scale-up and development of the FBC technology depends on the possibility to increase the knowledge on the main processes involved in FBC boilers. A combination of experimental work and formulation of mathematical models is important to increase the knowledge of the process. In this work, macroscopic submodels for key processes in FBC (fluid dynamics, combustion and heat transfer) are formulated based on experimental data. These submodels are then linked to form a comprehensive model for large-scale fluidized bed combustion which is compared to experimental data not used in the validation of the submodels. The submodels include treatment of important phenomena such as fluctuations in the gas phase, separate convective and radiative heat <b>transfer</b> <b>accounting</b> for absorption in the particle suspension, influence of the pressure drop across the gas distributor and corner effects in the solid phase. These phenomena were not included in previous comprehensive FBC models and are the focus of this thesis. The comparison between the model and experimental data from large-scale fluidized bed boilers have been carried out {{for a wide range of}} data categories covering the solid phases (inert bed material and fuel), the gas phase and the temperature field. The modeled data generally shows good agreement with experimental data. Although the model developed is primarily aimed at circulating fluidized bed boilers, its principles and formulation can also be applied to bubbling beds and gasifiers as well as new FBC technologies such as oxy-fuel or chemical looping combustion...|$|E
