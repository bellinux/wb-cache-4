5|$|Federal agents {{obtained}} a warrant {{to search the}} house of McVeigh's father, Bill, after which they broke down the door and wired the house and telephone with listening devices. FBI investigators used the resulting information gained, along with the fake address McVeigh had been using, to begin their search for the Nichols brothers, Terry and James. On April 21, 1995, <b>Terry</b> <b>Nichols</b> learned {{that he was being}} hunted, and turned himself in. Investigators discovered incriminating evidence at his home: ammonium nitrate and blasting caps, the electric drill used to drill out the locks at the quarry, books on bomb-making, a copy of Hunter (a 1989 novel by William Luther Pierce, the founder and chairman of the National Alliance, a white nationalist group) and a hand-drawn map of downtown Oklahoma City, on which the Murrah Building and the spot where McVeigh's getaway car was hidden were marked. After a nine-hour interrogation, <b>Terry</b> <b>Nichols</b> was formally held in federal custody until his trial. On April 25, 1995, James Nichols was also arrested, but he was released after 32days due to lack of evidence. McVeigh's sister Jennifer was accused of illegally mailing bullets to McVeigh, but she was granted immunity in exchange for testifying against him.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, Oklahoma City was {{the site}} {{of one of the most}} {{destructive}} acts of domestic terrorism in American history. The Oklahoma City bombing of April 19, 1995, in which Timothy McVeigh detonated a large, crude explosive device outside the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building, killed 168 people, including 19 children. For his crime, McVeigh was executed by the federal government on June 11, 2001. His accomplice, <b>Terry</b> <b>Nichols,</b> is serving life in prison without parole for helping plan the attack and prepare the explosive.|$|E
5|$|The chief conspirators, Timothy McVeigh and <b>Terry</b> <b>Nichols,</b> met in 1988 at Fort Benning during basic {{training}} for the U.S. Army. Michael Fortier, McVeigh's accomplice, was his Army roommate. The three shared interests in survivalism. They expressed anger at the federal government's handling of the 1992 Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) standoff with Randy Weaver at Ruby Ridge {{as well as the}} Waco siege—a 1993 51-day standoff between the FBI and Branch Davidian members which began with a botched ATF attempt to execute a search warrant leading to a fire fight (it is unknown whether ATF agents or Branch Davidians fired the first shot) and ended with the burning and shooting deaths of David Koresh and 75others. In March 1993, McVeigh visited the Waco site during the standoff, and then again after its conclusion. McVeigh later decided to bomb a federal building {{as a response to the}} raids.|$|E
50|$|<b>Terry</b> Lynn <b>Nichols</b> (born April 1, 1955) is an American who {{was convicted}} of being an {{accomplice}} in the Oklahoma City bombing. Prior to his incarceration, he held a variety of short-term jobs, working as a farmer, grain elevator manager, real estate salesman and ranch hand. He met his future conspirator, Timothy McVeigh, during a brief stint in the U.S. Army, which ended in 1989 when he requested a hardship discharge after less than one year of service. In 1994 and 1995, he conspired with McVeigh in the planning and preparation of the Oklahoma City bombing - the truck bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, on April 19, 1995. The bombing claimed the lives of 168 people.|$|R
40|$|In {{the digital}} age, when videos are {{streamed}} and books {{can be read}} electronically, {{it is hard to}} fathom the revolutionary impact that printed images had when they first appeared in Europe around 1400. Their introduction changed forever the traditional practice of manually crafting images one by one, creating a world in which pictures could be reproduced almost without limit on a new material called paper, expanding the possibilities and audiences for images and texts of all kinds. This publication, which brings to light little-seen masterpieces from the Sheldon Museum of Art’s collection, explores the three major print techniques of the early modern period: woodcut, engraving, and etching. Along the way, it suggests not only how the print revolution evolved as it spread across Europe and the British Isles, but also how it gave rise to images that are intimate and public, sacred and secular. These pictures, which transformed the everyday lives of their original users, remind us of the many ways in which print technology continues to shape our own.

5|$|The Oklahoma City {{bombing was}} a {{domestic}} terrorist truck bombing on the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in downtown Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, United States on April 19, 1995. Perpetrated by Timothy McVeigh and <b>Terry</b> <b>Nichols,</b> the bombing killed 168 people, injured more than 680 others, and destroyed {{one-third of the}} building. The blast destroyed or damaged 324 other buildings within a 16-block radius, shattered glass in 258 nearby buildings, and destroyed or burned 86 cars, causing an estimated $652million worth of damage. Extensive rescue efforts were undertaken by local, state, federal, and worldwide agencies {{in the wake of}} the bombing, and substantial donations were received from across the country. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) activated eleven of its Urban Search and Rescue Task Forces, consisting of 665 rescue workers who assisted in rescue and recovery operations. The Oklahoma City bombing was the deadliest terrorist attack on American soil until the September 11 attacks six years later, and it still remains the deadliest incident of domestic terrorism in United States history.|$|E
25|$|Capture and {{conviction}} of Timothy McVeigh and <b>Terry</b> <b>Nichols</b> for the Oklahoma City bombing.|$|E
25|$|McVeigh's accomplice, <b>Terry</b> <b>Nichols,</b> {{was convicted}} and sentenced in federal court {{to life in prison}} {{for his role in the}} crime. At Nichols' trial, {{evidence}} was presented indicating that others may have been involved. Several residents of central Kansas, including real estate agent Georgia Rucker and a retired Army NCO, testified at Terry Nichols' federal trial that they had seen two trucks at Geary Lake State Park, where prosecutors alleged the bomb was assembled. The retired NCO said he visited the lake on April 18, 1995, but left after a group of surly men looked at him aggressively. The operator of the Dreamland Motel testified that two Ryder trucks had been parked outside her Grandview Plaza motel where McVeigh stayed in Room 26 the weekend before the bombing. <b>Terry</b> <b>Nichols</b> is incarcerated at ADX Florence in Florence, Colorado.|$|E
25|$|Four {{years after}} his conviction, McVeigh was {{executed}} by lethal injection on June 11, 2001, at the Federal Correctional Complex in Terre Haute, Indiana. <b>Terry</b> <b>Nichols</b> and Michael Fortier were also convicted as conspirators in the plot. Nichols was sentenced to eight life terms {{for the deaths of}} eight federal agents, and to 161 life terms without parole by the state of Oklahoma for the deaths of the others (including one unborn baby). Fortier was sentenced to 12 years and has since been released.|$|E
25|$|In April 1993, McVeigh {{headed for}} a farm in Michigan where <b>Terry</b> <b>Nichols</b> lived. In between {{watching}} coverage of the Waco siege on TV, Nichols and his brother began teaching McVeigh how to make explosives out of readily available materials; specifically, they combined household chemicals in plastic jugs. The destruction of the Waco compound enraged McVeigh and convinced {{him that it was}} time to take action. The government's use of CS gas on women and children angered McVeigh; he had been exposed to the gas as part of his military training and was familiar with its effects. The disappearance of certain evidence, such as the bullet-riddled steel-reinforced front door to the complex, led him to suspect a cover-up.|$|E
25|$|Garland {{insisted on}} {{being sent to}} Oklahoma City in the {{aftermath}} of that attack to examine the crime scene and oversee the investigation in preparation for the prosecution. He represented the government at the preliminary hearings of the two main defendants, Timothy McVeigh and <b>Terry</b> <b>Nichols.</b> Garland offered to lead the trial team, but could not because he was needed at the Justice Department headquarters. Instead, he helped pick the team and supervised it from Washington, where he was involved in major decisions, including the choice to seek the death penalty for McVeigh and Nichols. Garland won praise for his work on the case from the Republican Governor of Oklahoma, Frank Keating.|$|E
25|$|The {{facility}} {{is best known}} for housing inmates who have been deemed too dangerous, too high-profile or too great a national security risk for even a maximum-security prison. These include the leaders of violent gangs who had continued to issue orders to their members from lower-security facilities: Larry Hoover of the Gangster Disciples, and Barry Mills and Tyler Bingham of the Aryan Brotherhood. ADX also houses foreign terrorists, including Zacarias Moussaoui, the only person convicted in civilian court of the September 11 attacks; Faisal Shahzad, the perpetrator of the 2010 Times Square car bombing attempt; and Ramzi Yousef, mastermind of the 1993 World Trade Center bombing; as well as domestic terrorists, such as Ted Kaczynski and Eric Rudolph. Timothy McVeigh, who carried out the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, was housed at ADX before he was sentenced to death in 1997 and transferred to the United States Penitentiary, Terre Haute, which houses most federal death row inmates and is where Federal death sentences are carried out. McVeigh's co-conspirator, <b>Terry</b> <b>Nichols,</b> is serving 161 life sentences at ADX. Robert Hanssen, the former FBI agent who betrayed several spies to the Soviet Union and Russia, is serving 15 life sentences at ADX for his crimes. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, the perpetrator of the Boston Marathon bombings, was transferred here from another prison in the Florence complex on July 17, 2015. The prison also houses inmates who are a high escape risk, including Richard McNair, who escaped from a county jail and two other prisons before being sent to ADX.|$|E
500|$|As {{the rescue}} effort wound down, the media {{interest}} {{shifted to the}} investigation, arrests, and trials of Timothy McVeigh and <b>Terry</b> <b>Nichols,</b> and on the search for an additional suspect named [...] "John Doe Number Two." [...] Several witnesses claimed to have seen a second suspect, who did not resemble Nichols, with McVeigh.|$|E
500|$|On April 14, 1995, McVeigh {{paid for}} a motel room at the Dreamland Motel in Junction City, Kansas. The {{following}} day he rented a 1993 Ford F-700 truck from Ryder under the name Robert D. Kling, an alias he adopted because he knew an Army soldier named Kling with whom he shared physical characteristics, and because {{it reminded him of}} the Klingon warriors of Star Trek. On April16, 1995, he drove to Oklahoma City with fellow conspirator <b>Terry</b> <b>Nichols</b> where he parked a getaway car several blocks away from the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building. The nearby Regency Towers Apartments' lobby security camera recorded images of Nichols' blue 1984 GMC pickup truck on April 16. After removing the license plate from the car, he left a note covering the Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) plate that read, [...] "Not abandoned. Please do not tow. Will move by April 23. (Needs battery & cable)." [...] Both men then returned to Kansas.|$|E
2500|$|Timothy McVeigh, a US Military man, {{was found}} guilty of the attack in a jury trial and sentenced to death. He was {{executed}} in 2001. A co-conspirator, <b>Terry</b> <b>Nichols,</b> is serving multiple life sentences in a federal prison. [...] Third and fourth subjects, Michael Fortier and his wife, Lori, assisted in the plot. They testified against both McVeigh and Nichols in exchange for a 12-year prison term for Michael and immunity for Lori. Michael was released into the witness protection program in January 2006.|$|E
2500|$|There is {{only one}} supermax prison in the United States federal system, ADX Florence in Florence, Colorado. [...] It houses several inmates who {{have a history of}} violent {{behavior}} in other prisons, with the goal of moving them from solitary confinement for 23 hours a day to a less restrictive prison within three years. [...] However, it is best known for housing several inmates who have been deemed either too dangerous, too high-profile or too great a national security risk for even a maximum-security prison. [...] Residents include Timothy McVeigh, perpetrator of the Oklahoma City Bombing who was executed by lethal injection at the Federal Correctional Complex, Terre Haute on June 11, 2001; Theodore Kaczynski, a domestic terrorist otherwise known as the Unabomber, who once attacked via mail bombs; Robert Hanssen, an American FBI agent turned Soviet spy; <b>Terry</b> <b>Nichols,</b> McVeigh's accomplice in the Oklahoma City Bombing; Richard Reid, known as the [...] "Shoe Bomber", who was jailed for life for attempting to detonate explosive materials in his shoes while on board an aircraft; Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, the underwear bomber; Richard Lee McNair, a persistent prison escapee; Charles Harrelson, a hitman who was convicted in 1979 of killing Federal Judge John H. Wood Jr.; and Vito Rizzuto, boss of the [...] "Sixth" [...] Mafia [...] "Family," [...] released on October 5, 2012. The maximum security facility in Colorado is the only federal Super Max in the United States. It is reserved for federal crimes. The Boston Marathon Bomber was housed there. Deprivation of social contact and the isolation of inmates has some unintended positive and negative effects. Inmates are safer being in isolation, and prisons create more jobs for their local communities. Super max prisons however are extremely expensive to run and can cost about three times the national average for a maximum security facility.|$|E
