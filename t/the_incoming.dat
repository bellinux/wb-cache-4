5|$|Before {{the season}} began, point guard Darius Morris, the Big Ten assists {{leader in the}} 2010–11 season, left the team after being drafted by the Los Angeles Lakers. <b>The</b> <b>incoming</b> class {{included}} Carlton Brundidge and 2011 Ohio Mr. Basketball point guard Trey Burke. Both Brundidge and Burke were among Scout.com's top 100 players of the 2011 class; Brundidge ranked 98th and Burke ranked 94th. Max Bielfeldt committed to Michigan in April despite his family's ties to the Illinois Fighting Illini. Illinois University's Bielfeldt Athletic Administration Building was endowed by his family. Sai Tummala, who along with Bielfeldt was recruited by Ivy League schools, rounded out <b>the</b> <b>incoming</b> class. Tummala earned an academic scholarship and was considered a walk-on candidate for the basketball team.|$|E

5|$|The Democrats recaptured the House {{after the}} 1882 elections, but <b>the</b> <b>incoming</b> {{majority}} in the 48th Congress was divided on tariffs, with Randall's protectionist faction in the minority. The new Democratic caucus was more Southern and Western than in previous Congresses, and contained many new members who were unfamiliar with Randall. This led many to propose selecting a Speaker {{more in line with}} their own views, rather than returning Randall to the office. Randall's attempt to canvass <b>the</b> <b>incoming</b> representatives was further hampered by an attack of the gout. In the end, John G. Carlisle of Kentucky, an advocate of tariff reform, bested Randall in a poll of the Democratic caucus by a vote of 104 to 53.|$|E

5|$|X-ray {{crystallography}} {{is a form}} of elastic scattering; {{the outgoing}} X-rays have the same energy, and thus same wavelength, as <b>the</b> <b>incoming</b> X-rays, only with altered direction. By contrast, inelastic scattering occurs when energy is transferred from <b>the</b> <b>incoming</b> X-ray to the crystal, e.g., by exciting an inner-shell electron to a higher energy level. Such inelastic scattering reduces the energy (or increases the wavelength) of the outgoing beam. Inelastic scattering is useful for probing such excitations of matter, but not in determining the distribution of scatterers within the matter, which is the goal of X-ray crystallography.|$|E

5|$|Because the cuticle layers are {{arranged}} in rows, with a cylindrical curve, {{the amount of the}} second type of reflection is dependent on the polarization of <b>the</b> <b>incoming</b> light.
