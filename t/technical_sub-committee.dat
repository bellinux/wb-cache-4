On 22 November 1914, Henderson was appointed General Officer Commanding the 1st Infantry Division and his Chief of Staff Frederick Sykes took up command in his stead.

At a meeting with Soviet {{counterparts}} in the Reich Chancellery, he famously got the Russian guards drunk on vodka, and in the resulting alcohol fuelled disorientation, was able to make off with the large swastika banner that had been the backdrop of many of Hitler's speeches. The banner now hangs in the Naval Academy museum. He attended the Potsdam Conference (17 July and 2 August 1945) and was assigned to the Tripartite Naval Commission on its foundation on August 15, 1945. TNC was responsible for the allocation of seized German ships to the commission's member nations USA, UK an USSR. Graubart was subsequently appointed to TNC's <b>Technical</b> <b>Sub-Committee</b> which had responsibility for preparing the allocation lists and was a member of several Inspection Parties (also called Tripartite Naval Boards) to undertake the detailed work in estimating the seaworthiness and value of ships and in deciding which ships and submarines would be allocated between the three Allies, and the disposal arrangements for the remainder. Graubart travelled extensively in Germany, Poland, the USSR and grew very suspicious of Soviet intentions. On several occasions, he argumented for not discharging German Navy units under U.S. and UK control, but to keep them in order to have more Naval capacity ready against possible Soviet actions. His views were very unpopular at a time, when Stalin and the Soviet Union were still seen as an unconditional friends of the U.S.A. His Soviet counterparts had no illusions concerning his sympathies and, on several occasions asked for his dismissal from the commission, but to no avail. Graubart was successful in securing some of the best remaining German ships for the USA, including the heavy cruiser Prinz Eugen and the barque USCGC Eagle, back then known as SSS Horst Wessel, and, with his CO's knowledge quietly kept as many ships seaworthy and manned as possible. Knowing, that TNC would come to an end in 1946, he actively lobbied for being appointed commander of Prinz Eugen and was confirmed in December 1945.|$|E
