Thus, the IP tunnel endpoints become native IP routers that establish a standard IP route between the source and destination networks. Packets traversing these end-points from the transit network are stripped from their <b>transit</b> <b>frame</b> format headers and trailers used in the tunnelling protocol and thus converted into native IP format and injected into the IP stack of the tunnel endpoints. In addition, any other protocol encapsulations used during transit, such as IPsec or Transport Layer Security, are removed.|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} {{data-driven}} approach that synthesizes tree animations from {{a set of}} pre-computed motion data. Our approach improves previous motion synthesis algorithms for character animation in several aspects. We first introduce a simple yet effective sampling scheme to generate a rich and reusable motion database for each tree model. We also propose a novel technique to generate a fine set of transitions that are uniformly distributed in the motion database. The transition lengths are adaptively determined according to the similarity of the <b>transiting</b> <b>frame</b> pairs. In the runtime, we employ a greedy searching algorithm to synthesize smooth tree animations under an adjustable wind condition. Experimental results show that our approach achieves comparable quality to physically based methods, while in orders of magnitude faster performance. Copyright...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an algorithm for robust time recognition of video clock. The existing OCR algorithms cannot recognize time properly due to digits of time are in very low resolution and blur. To confront {{the challenges of}} time recognition, our algorithm employs three techniques. The first one is a digit transition detection, which identifies SECOND <b>transit</b> <b>frames.</b> The second is a digit-sequence recognition, which uses the property that digits in clock appear in cycle of 0 to 9 to form digit sequence. The third is an on-the-fly template creation. Informally, the robustness of our algorithm benefits from the facts that both digit transition detection and digit-sequence recognition are more reliable than direct character recognition. Experimental results show that our algorithm can achieve a high accuracy in recognizing time. Digits of video clock are in very low resolution. The dimension of a digit region is {{in the range of}} 3 x 6 to 6 x 10 pixels in mpeg 1 video. Digits are blur and distorted due to various causes. 1...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: To {{design and}} develop a {{real-time}} electronic portal imaging device (EPID) -based delivery verification system for dynamic intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) which enables detection of gross treatment delivery errors before delivery of substantial radiation to the patient. Methods: The system utilizes a comprehensive physics-based model to generate a series of predicted <b>transit</b> EPID image <b>frames</b> as a reference dataset and compares these to measured EPID frames acquired during treatment. The two datasets are using MLC aperture comparison and cumulative signal checking techniques. The system operation in real-time was simulated offline using previously acquired images for 19 IMRT patient deliveries with both frame-by-frame comparison and cumulative frame comparison. Simulated error case studies were used to demonstrate the system sensitivity and performance. Results: The accuracy of the synchronization method was shown to agree within two control points which corresponds to approximately ~ 1 % of the total MU to be delivered for dynamic IMRT. The system achieved mean real-time gamma results for frame-by-frame analysis of 86. 6 % and 89. 0 % for 3 %, 3 mm and 4 %, 4 mm criteria, respectively, and 97. 9 % and 98. 6 % for cumulative gamma analysis. The system can detect a 10 % MU error using 3 %, 3 mm criteria within approximately 10 s. The EPID-based real-time delivery verification system successfully detected simulated gross errors introduced into patient plan deliveries in near real-time (within 0. 1 s). Conclusions: A real-time radiation delivery verification system for dynamic IMRT has been demonstrated {{that is designed to}} prevent major mistreatments in modern radiation therapy...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} the performance and limitations of a real-time transit electronic portal imaging device (EPID) dosimetry system for error detection during dynamic intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) treatment delivery. Sites studied are prostate, head and neck (HN), and rectal cancer treatments. Methods: The system compares measured cumulative <b>transit</b> EPID image <b>frames</b> with predicted cumulative image frames in real-time during treatment using a Ï‡ comparison with 4 %, 4 mm criteria. The treatment site-specific thresholds (prostate, HN and rectum IMRT) were determined using initial data collected from 137 patients (274 measured treatment fractions) and a statistical process control methodology. These thresholds were then applied to data from 15 selected patients including 5 prostate, 5 HN, and 5 rectum IMRT treatments for system evaluation and classification of error sources. Results: Clinical demonstration of real-time transit EPID dosimetry in IMRT was presented. For error simulation, the system could detect gross errors (i. e. wrong patient, wrong plan, wrong gantry angle) immediately after EPID stabilisation; 2 seconds after the start of treatment. The average rate of error detection was 7. 0 % (prostate[*]=[*] 5. 6 %, HN=[*] 8. 7 % and rectum[*]=[*] 6. 7 %). The detected errors were classified as either clinical in origin (e. g. patient anatomical changes), or non-clinical in origin (e. g. detection system errors). Classified errors were 3. 2 % clinical and 3. 9 % non-clinical. Conclusion: An EPID-based real-time error detection method for treatment verification during dynamic IMRT has been developed and tested for its performance and limitations. The system is able to detect gross errors in real-time, however improvement in system robustness is required to reduce the non-clinical sources of error detection...|$|R
40|$|Detonation waves {{run through}} {{explosive}} mixtures at several times {{the speed of}} sound and cause an immediate release of energy as well as a strong pressure jump. Subject of this work is the behavior of detonation waves in gaseous mixtures close to the limit of propagation, where the complex internal structure of the wave becomes important. The focus lies on the propagation in narrow gaps at elevated pressures and temperatures, which is of interest in the frame of engine knock, because surface damages found have been traced to detonative forms of combustion. In addition to that questions of plant safety are concerned. After description of the state of science and the measurement techniques developed first some results concerning border subjects are presented: detonation cell sizes of the fuels Iso-octane and n-heptane as well as wall boundary layer and heat fluxes behind waves. Then Fays stream tube model for detonation propagation under effect of wall friction is enhanced and finally the velocity deficit, the pressure profiles, the wave structures and the phenomena of de-coupling and re-formation are discussed. Detonation cells for Iso-octane- and n-heptane-air show to be twice to three times as large as for hydrogen-air and similarly irregular. Mixed with oxygen their size {{is similar to that of}} the shorter alcanes ethane, propane und butane. For n-heptane they are somewhat smaller than for Iso-octane. Following the stream tube model the deficit of the wave velocity in respect to the result of the loss-free Chapman-Jouguet theory is close to proportional to the boundary layer displacement thickness at the location of the sonic plane, where the flow in the wave-fixed <b>frame</b> <b>transits</b> from subsonic to supersonic and chemical equilibrium is reached. Friction and heat losses can affect the wave only within the subsonic region. The ratio between the location of the sonic plane (in respect to the front) and the cell width varies in the literature from 0. 3 to 9. Own observations now show that this ratio is close to one. The stream tube model is enhanced by the effects of incomplete energy conversion up to the sonic plane and a consistent pressure profile model. For a given displacement thickness both effect result in a remarkably higher deficit as all models known so far. In addition there is a strong influence of the kind of boundary layer. The high-speed wall heat flux measurements show in contrast to present assumptions that the wall boundary layer behind is essentially laminar up to far beyond the sonic plane. An empirical expression for the velocity deficit of detonation waves in narrow gaps was determined. Applied to the conditions of a numerical work dealing with extremely narrow gaps (500 ~kPa, 800 ~K, 0. 01 ~mm), which was to be evaluated, it predicts a fast decoupling and quenching of the wave...|$|R
40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) In modern {{radiotherapy}} treatments such as Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) and Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy (VMAT) {{are complex}} involving very sophisticated dynamic delivery techniques. Unfortunately with complex technology and techniques {{there is always}} some risk and errors can occur. The high dose gradients typically associated with these treatment techniques require rigorous verification of the radiation delivery, which is generally performed using pre-treatment verification. Therefore, a major gap in current radiation therapy safety for patient treatments is to absence of the actual treatment delivery verification to ensure that mistreatment do not occur. In this thesis, we have designed and developed a first real-time electronic portal imaging device (EPID) -based delivery verification system (Watchdog), which enables detection of gross treatment delivery errors before delivery of substantial radiation to the patient. This application addresses this important unmet need in radiation therapy safety. The system utilizes a comprehensive physics-based model to generate a series of predicted <b>transit</b> EPID image <b>frames</b> as a reference dataset and compares these to measured EPID frames acquired during treatment. The EPID image frames are acquired during treatment delivery at ~ 10 frames per second via a frame-grabber card and separate computer. When frames are received they are first synchronised to the predicted image data set. Currently for IMRT deliveries the multileaf collimator (MLC) aperture is segmented from the image and is compared to the MLC aperture in the predicted image set and the closest matching control point is found. For VMAT deliveries the gantry angle is used for synchronisation. The first 20 frames or ~ 2 s of delivery are ignored in the analysis as the beam dose-rate is rapidly increasing in this period making dosimetric assessment uncertain. The cumulative measured image (integrating all frames {{from the start of}} treatment) is then quantitatively compared to the predicted image (similarly integrated) in real-time using the chi comparison method with the criteria of 4 %, 4 mm. Comparisons are made in real-time with results reported at approximately 0. 5 s intervals. For a pilot study of the system deployment in clinic, approximately 200 patient image data was corrected. This allows us to determine the appropriate action levels (threshold) using statistical process control (SPC) technique. In our investigation of system performance, errors are flagged when the results fall below the defined action level for approximately 3 seconds duration. In addition, we have developed new tools to verify the position and trajectory of dynamic MLCs and jaws from a linac machine using EPID. These tools were used to assist the error classification for estimating the source of detected errors by the system. Finally, we proposes the method for evaluating treatment quality to assist in continuous quality improvement using in-vivo EPID based dosimetry. The SPC was applied and a moving range control chart is constructed to monitor the individual patient treatment verification results. A process capability index is used to evaluate the treatment quality for three classes; linac machine, treatment techniques, and body-sites. The outcomes of this research include 1) development a first real-time EPID-based patient treatment verification, 2) determination of action levels for real-time error detection, 3) development of new tools for real-time collimation position and trajectory verification using EPID, 4) evaluating the long-term treatment quality for continue quality improvement...|$|R
