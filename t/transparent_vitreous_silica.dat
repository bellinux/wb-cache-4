40|$|It is a {{challenge}} to calorimetrically determine the glass transition temperature (Tg) of <b>vitreous</b> <b>silica.</b> Here we demonstrate that this challenge mainly arises from the extreme sensitivity of the Tg to the hydroxyl content in <b>vitreous</b> <b>silica,</b> but also from the irreversibility of its glass transition when repeating the calorimetric scans. It is known that the liquid fragility (i. e., the speed of the viscous slow-down of a supercooled liquid at its Tg during cooling) has impact on enthalpy relaxation in glass. Here we find that <b>vitreous</b> <b>silica</b> (as a strong system) exhibits striking anomalies in both glass transition and enthalpy relaxation compared to fragile oxide systems. The anomalous enthalpy relaxation of <b>vitreous</b> <b>silica</b> is discovered by performing the hperquenching-annealing-calorimetry experiments.

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the density anomaly of <b>vitreous</b> <b>silica</b> in the medium- or long-range order, different models were made to study the atomic configuration revolution in thermal history by molecular dynamics. The void structures have been studied through analyzing the best model that is carefully selected. The principle of void size distribution revolution at elevated temperatures was used to explain the density anomaly of the <b>vitreous</b> <b>silica.</b> The simulation results showed that when the temperature is low, the void radius increases with the temperature rising. After 2000 K, large void structures are destroyed, filled, or separated into small radius voids. In the range from 2000 K to 2400 K, large void structures decrease faster exceeding the bond extension on thermal expansion contribution, this should be {{the root cause of}} negative thermal expansion behavior for <b>vitreous</b> <b>silica.</b> When the temperature is greater than 2400 K, with the temperature rising, the normal thermal expansion is recovered gradually because number of large voids has been reduced and their destroying cannot eliminate the contribution to expansion of bond extension. Therefore, the negative thermal expansion of <b>vitreous</b> <b>silica</b> could be described by the revolution of void structures in the medium- or long-range clearly, and is mainly influenced by the existence and change of larger voids...|$|R

For the used doses {{the range of}} density change of the investigated samples was 12 % (the maximum change during amorphization is 14 %) and the amorphous fraction varied from 35 % to 100 %. The same measurement was done in neutron-irradiated amorphous silica with a maximal dose 2 × 10 20 n/cm 2. In all cases we observed the boson peak in the Raman spectra. The position of the peak, at 67 ± 3 cm - 1, {{was found to be}} the same for all the investigated samples independent of the dose.

40|$|The {{transport}} in oxides is {{studied by}} the use of gas phase analysis (GPA). An experimental method to identify transported species of gases and their contribution to the overall transport of gases in oxides and an experimental method to evaluate the parameters diffusivity, concentration, permeability of gases in oxides and effective pore size in oxides are developed, respectively. Pt has two effects on the thermal oxidation of metals. One is to enhance the oxidation of metals which takes place at the oxide-metal interface by promoting a high concentration gradient of dissociated oxygen across the oxide layer. The other effect is to suppress the oxidation of metals by decreasing the contact area between metal and oxygen. The overall effect of Pt on the oxidation of metals depends on the mechanism of oxide growth in the absence of Pt. It is suggested that an appropriate amount of Pt coating induces a balanced oxide growth resulting from stoichimetrical inward oxygen flux to outward metal flux, which leads to a reduced oxidation rate. The diffusion of diatomic gases in oxides such as <b>vitreous</b> <b>silica</b> and yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) takes place in both molecular and dissociated (atomic or/and ionic) form. The fraction of transport of molecular species decreases with temperatures, and the fraction of transport of dissociated species increases with temperatures. Measured permeabilities of diatomic gases in <b>vitreous</b> <b>silica</b> are higher than the expected permeabilities of their molecules, which are explained by diffusion of molecules combined with a retardation of dissociated species in reversible traps. The diffusion of hydrogen in <b>vitreous</b> <b>silica</b> is concentration dependent and increases with local concentration.
