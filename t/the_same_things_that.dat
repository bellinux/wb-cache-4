25|$|In {{food and}} wine pairings, the {{diversity}} of Merlot can lend itself to {{a wide array of}} matching options. Cabernet-like Merlots pair well with many of <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> Cabernet Sauvignon would pair well with, such as grilled and charred meats. Softer, fruitier Merlots (particularly those with higher acidity from cooler climate regions like Washington State and Northeastern Italy) share many of the same food-pairing affinities with Pinot noir and go well with dishes like salmon, mushroom-based dishes and greens like chard and radicchio. Light-bodied Merlots can go well with shellfish like prawns or scallops, especially if wrapped in a protein-rich food such as bacon or prosciutto. Merlot tends not to go well with strong and blue-veined cheeses that can overwhelm the fruit flavors of the wine. The capsaicins of spicy foods can accentuate the perception of alcohol in Merlot and make it taste more tannic and bitter.|$|E
500|$|After {{its release}} and success, Frederator Studios then pitched an Adventure Time series to Nicktoons, but the network passed on it twice. The studio then {{approached}} Cartoon Network. The network {{said they would}} be willing to produce the series if Ward could prove that [...] "the seven-minute short made for Nick wasn’t a one-hit wonder". Ward quickly retooled the concept of the pilot; he wanted a potential series to be [...] "fully realized", rather than feature the [...] "pre-school vibe" [...] that he believed defined the original pilot. Initially, Ward submitted a rough storyboard that featured Finn and an [...] "oblivious" [...] Princess Bubblegum going on a spaghetti-supper date. However, the network was not happy with this story, and specifically asked for an episode that contained <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> had [...] "made the short so special, like the crazy opening dance, the 'Abe Lincoln moment,' funny catchwords, and the awkward princess/kiss moment at the end. Ward then created an early storyboard for the episode [...] "The Enchiridion!", which was his attempt to emulate the style of the original short. Eventually, Cartoon Network approved the first season in September 2008, and [...] "The Enchiridion!" [...] became the first episode to enter into production.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{introduced}} Criss as Blaine, a gay {{member of}} a rival glee club, the Dalton Academy Warblers. In September 2010, a casting call was released for an actor to portray a [...] "cute, charismatic, gay high school junior" [...] who would lead a competing glee club. Criss had auditioned for Glee several times before, once {{for the role of}} Finn Hudson. The character breakdown for Blaine was the first he believed he had a chance of securing, and indeed his audition was successful. Blaine was introduced primarily as a mentor to Kurt. Criss explained, [...] "At this point, Kurt's [...] has been such a sense of discord in his life. Blaine finds [...] empowering. He embraces who he is, and sees Kurt [...] <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> he had to deal with, and I think he wants to impart that knowledge." [...] Murphy described Blaine as a character with [...] "great self-loathing" [...] and regret for having run away from his own tormentors; he intended this to form part of his story arc for the season, as Blaine tries to set right some past mistakes. Neither he nor Criss knew whether Blaine would eventually become Kurt's boyfriend—a role originally intended for new club member Sam Evans (Chord Overstreet) until the producers decided to change Sam to heterosexual and paired him with Quinn—but based on the characters' chemistry and the [...] "immediate outcry" [...] from fans who wanted to see them as a couple, Murphy later decided to pair them romantically.|$|E
500|$|Take Off Your Pants and Jacket {{has been}} called a concept album chronicling {{adolescence}} and associated feelings. The band did not consider them explicitly teenage songs: [...] "The things that happen to you in high school are <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> happen your entire life," [...] said Hoppus. [...] "You can fall in love at sixty; you can get rejected at eighty." [...] The record begins with [...] "Anthem Part Two", which touches on disenchantment and blames adults for teenage problems. It serves as the opposite of the band's typical [...] "party" [...] image presented to the media, with heavily politically-charged lyrics. Joe Shooman called it a [...] "generational manifesto that exhorts kids to be wary of the system that surrounds them". [...] "Online Songs" [...] was written by Hoppus about [...] "the thoughts that drive you crazy" [...] {{in the aftermath of a}} breakup, and is essentially a follow-up to [...] "Josie". [...] "First Date" [...] was inspired by DeLonge and wife Jennifer Jenkins' first date at SeaWorld in San Diego. [...] "I was about 21 at the time and it was an excuse for me to take her somewhere because I wanted to hang out with her," [...] said DeLonge. The track was written as a summary of neurotic teen angst and awkwardness. [...] "Happy Holidays, You Bastard" [...] is a joke track intended to [...] "piss parents off." [...] The fifth track, [...] "Story of a Lonely Guy", concerns heartache and rejection prior to the high school prom. The song is downbeat and melancholy, filtered through [...] "tuneful guitar lines reminiscent of The Cure and hefty drum patterns".|$|E
500|$|The writers {{felt this}} {{approach}} was similar to how Stan Lee reinvented Captain America in the 1960s and 1970s, with [...] "the Captain dealing {{with all sorts of}} <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> the country [...] dealing with–Vietnam, Watergate and all that stuff–so he gets to have opinions on that", thus making the [...] "guy who is ostensibly from the more black and white 1940s react to this ultimately grey world that we live in." [...] Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige described the film as a political thriller, and as the duo struggled to figure out a third act, Feige suggested that S.H.I.E.L.D. be brought down and have Captain America fight the agency. The writers thought this was a great story point, for implementing [...] "the physical manifestation of Cap changing the world." [...] Markus even noted how the 1970s comics had similar conspiracies. The Hydra reveal made sure to include returning characters among the undercover villains, as well as references to the comics such as Arnim Zola being kept alive as a machine. Feige later elaborated on the political thriller nature of the film saying, In our attempt to make all of our films feel unique and feel different we found ourselves going back to things like [...] Also the other political thrillers of the '70s: The Parallax View, All the President's Men. This was a time that Cap existed in the comics. He found himself in the swinging '60s followed by the Watergate Era followed by the Reagan Era followed by where we are today. In the comics it {{was a hell of a}} journey for Steve. And we couldn't take him through those years because in our cinematic universe he was asleep. But we wanted to force him to confront that kind of moral conundrum, something with that '70s flavor. And in our film that takes the form of S.H.I.E.L.D.|$|E

2500|$|For a {{few years}} {{starting}} 1990, the World Bank anchored absolute poverty line as $1 per day. This was revised in 1993, and through 2005, absolute poverty was $1.08 a day for all countries on a purchasing power parity basis, after adjusting for inflation to the 1993 U.S. dollar. In 2005, after extensive studies of cost of living across the world, The World Bank raised the measure for global poverty line to reflect the observed higher cost of living. In 2015, the World Bank defines extreme poverty as living on less than US$1.90 (PPP) per day, and moderate poverty as less than $2 or $5 a day (but note that a person or family with access to subsistence resources, e.g., subsistence farmers, may have a low cash income without a correspondingly low standard of living – they are not living [...] "on" [...] their cash income but {{using it as a}} top up). It estimated that [...] "in 2001, 1.1 billion people had consumption levels below $1 a day and 2.7 billion lived on less than $2 a day." [...] A 'dollar a day', in nations that do not use the U.S. dollar as currency, does not translate to living a day on the equivalent amount of local currency as determined by the exchange rate. Rather, it is determined by the purchasing power parity rate, which would look at how much local currency is needed to buy <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> a dollar could buy in the United States. Usually, this would translate to less local currency than the exchange rate in poorer countries as the United States is a relatively more expensive country.|$|E

60|$|The sufferings and bereavements of {{war were}} not his only trials. Vauvenargues was beset {{throughout}} the whole of his short life with the sordid and humiliating embarrassments of narrow means. His letters to Saint-Vincens, the most intimate of his friends, disclose the straits {{to which he was}} driven. The nature of these straits is an old story all over the world, and Vauvenargues did <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> young men in want of money have generally done. It cannot be said, I fear, that he passed along those miry ways without some defilement. He bethinks him on one occasion that a rich neighbour has daughters. 'Why should I not undertake to marry one of them within two years, with a reasonable dowry, if he would lend me the money I want and provided I should not have repaid it by the time fixed?'[6] We must make allowance for the youth of the writer, and for a different view of marriage and its significance from our own. Even then there remains something to regret. Poverty, wrote Vauvenargues, in a maxim smacking unwontedly of commonplace, cannot debase strong souls, any more than riches can elevate low souls.[7] That depends. If poverty means pinching and fretting need of money, it may not debase the soul in any vital sense, but it is extremely likely to wear away a very priceless kind of delicacy in a man's estimate of human relations and their import.|$|E

With the strangers, more particularly if they do not buy their groceries 'in the street,' which means, and is, the town, the town has little to do; but it knows everything, and much more also, that goes on among them. Their dresses, their cattle, their views, the manners of their children, their manner towards their servants, and every other conceivable thing, is reported, digested, discussed, and rediscussed up and down Main Street. Now, the wisdom of Vermont, not being at all times equal to grasping all the problems of everybody else's life with delicacy, sometimes makes pathetic mistakes, and the town is set by the ears.
