5|$|A.J. Styles and Kurt Angle {{went on to}} {{face each}} other in a Last Man Standing match at Hard Justice. This bout was {{announced}} on the July31 episode of Impact!, when Styles challenged Angle to a match at Hard Justice to end their rivalry. This was due <b>to</b> <b>Angle</b> assaulting Styles from behind earlier in the episode. Styles defeated Angle at the event.|$|E
5|$|Heinrich Mallison in 2011 {{argued that}} Opisthocoelicaudia was able <b>to</b> <b>angle</b> the {{anterior}} {{part of the}} tail against the posterior part, producing a buckle in midsection. Thus, the anterior part {{would have been more}} straight during rearing than in other sauropods. In 2005, Wilson assumed that rearing was an innovation not only of Opisthocoelicaudia but also of related genera within the subfamily Saltasaurinae. Common features of these genera, such as the shortened tail, may have evolved as adaptations to rearing.|$|E
5|$|Following Turning Point, A.J. Styles {{tried to}} unite Christian's Coalition and The Angle Alliance. On the December 6, 2007 episode of Impact, Christian Cage became {{leader of a}} joint alliance, until Kurt Angle and Robert Roode {{attacked}} him {{at the end of}} the episode. This led <b>to</b> <b>Angle</b> defending the TNA World Heavyweight Championship against Cage at TNA's Final Resolution PPV event on January 6, 2008. There, Angle defeated Cage after Styles attacked Cage, effectively siding with The Angle Alliance. The two fought again for the title at TNA's Against All Odds PPV event on February 10, 2008, where Tomko cost Cage the title, siding with The Angle Alliance as well.|$|E

5|$|In {{the main}} event, John Cena faced Kurt Angle for the WWE Championship. The match began with Angle and Cena locking up, leading <b>to</b> <b>Angle</b> taking Cena {{down with a}} {{headlock}} takeover. Cena countered many attacks by Angle {{and was able to}} reverse the ankle lock. Cena attempted an FU but Angle delivered an Angle Slam. Eric Bischoff came down the ramp and cheered for Angle, who had the Ankle Lock applied on Cena. Cena rolled out of the move, grabbed the championship belt, which Bischoff had brought with him, and hit Angle with it. The referee saw this and called for the bell. As a result, Cena was disqualified for hitting Angle with the championship, ultimately resulting in him retaining his title. After the match, Angle attacked Cena until Cena delivered an FU through the Spanish announce table on Angle.|$|E
5|$|On the November 13 {{episode of}} Impact!, Cage {{was to be}} {{inducted}} into The Main Event Mafia (MEM), however, they instead turned on and assaulted him. This led to Cage's occasional tag team partner, Rhino, becoming involved in the overall storyline {{as the leader of}} the group The TNA Front Line after he was attacked by MEM on the November 20 episode of Impact!. During that same telecast, Angle versus Rhino was announced as TNA's Final Resolution event, with the added stipulations that if Angle won he would gain an opportunity to face Jeff Jarrett, while if Rhino won, then Angle was to be released from his TNA contract. Angle went on to defeat Rhino at the event, which led <b>to</b> <b>Angle</b> defeating Jarrett in a No Disqualification match at TNA's Genesis event in January 2009.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fourth}} match, John Cena defended the WWE Championship against Kurt Angle, with Daivari as the special guest referee. Early in the match, Angle {{was able to}} apply the Ankle lock on Cena. Cena reached the ropes but Daivari kicked his hand off. An angered Cena slapped Daivari, who tried to disqualify him as a result. Angle, however, stopped him, and both men were knocked {{out of the ring}} by Cena. As Daivari was knocked down outside, a Raw referee came out to officiate. After Cena gained the advantage, Angle knocked down the referee, and {{executed}} an illegal low blow. Angle called for another referee, but failed to get the win after executing an Angle Slam and a superplex. After Angle missed a moonsault, Cena went for an FU but Angle countered by holding onto the referee, which led <b>to</b> <b>Angle</b> knocking down the referee. As the other referee was knocked out, SmackDown referee Charles Robinson came out. Cena then delivered a DDT to Daivari and executed an FU on Angle, pinning him to retain the title.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the main}} matches on the undercard was a Fatal Four-Way Elimination match for the WWE United States Championship between the champion, John Cena, René Duprée, Booker T, and Rob Van Dam. At Judgment Day, Cena {{defeated}} Duprée to retain the United States Championship. Four days later, on SmackDown!, Cena faced Duprée in a rematch for the title. Duprée executed a low blow on Cena outside the ring, which caused Cena to be counted out. Duprée won the match, but not the title since a championship cannot be lost via countout or disqualification. The following week, Cena defeated Duprée in a Lumberjack match to retain the title. On the June 3 episode of SmackDown!, Cena confronted Booker about his interference in the Lumberjack match the week before. As General Manager Kurt Angle told Cena to leave the arena, Booker attacked Cena from behind and pushed him onto Angle. Angle claimed {{he was going to}} strip Cena of the United States Championship for what he did. The next week, on SmackDown!, Cena faced Booker, Van Dam, and Duprée, respectively, in one-on-one matches with a five-minute time limit. The man to defeat Cena would become the number-one contender to the United States Championship at The Great American Bash. Cena, however, won all three matches as no man was able to defeat him within the time limit. This led <b>to</b> <b>Angle</b> booking Cena in a Fatal Four-Way match for the title at The Great American Bash. On the June 17 episode of SmackDown!, Angle changed the match to an elimination match.|$|E
5|$|The Rock {{lost the}} WWF Championship <b>to</b> <b>Angle</b> at No Mercy in October. Around this time, The Rock feuded with Rikishi and {{defeated}} him at Survivor Series. The Rock wrestled a six-man Hell in a Cell {{match for the}} WWF Championship at Armageddon, which Kurt Angle won to retain the title. On December 18 on Raw, The Rock won the WWF Tag Team Championship with The Undertaker, defeating Edge and Christian, then losing it back to them the next night at a SmackDown! taping. In 2001, The Rock continued to feud with Angle over the WWF Championship, culminating at No Way Out in February, where he pinned Angle to win the WWF Championship for a sixth time. The Rock then feuded with the Royal Rumble winner, Stone Cold Steve Austin, whom he lost the title at WrestleMania X-Seven after Austin allied with Mr. McMahon, who interfered on his behalf. On the next night's Raw Is War, during a steel cage title rematch, Triple H came to the ring with a sledgehammer and it seemed he would help The Rock, because of the rivalry between Austin and Triple H (and an argument with McMahon earlier in the night), but he attacked him instead, allying with McMahon and Austin. Austin and Triple H formed a tag team called The Power Trip, while The Rock was indefinitely suspended. Johnson used this time off {{to act in the}} movie The Mummy Returns.|$|E
5|$|The predominate storyline {{heading into}} the event was the rivalry between A.J. Styles and Kurt Angle, both members of The Angle Alliance group. On the February14 episode of Impact!, TNA held the scripted wedding of Angle's real-life wife Karen Angle and Styles despite Angle and Karen still being married on-screen. Afterwards, Karen and Angle {{separated}} in the storyline on the March13 episode of Impact!. TNA continued to build the situation with Angle attempting to reconcile with Karen on the May15 episode of Impact!. Karen refused Angle's request on the May22 episode of Impact!, leading <b>to</b> <b>Angle</b> turning on and assaulting Styles later in the episode due to his jealousy of the affection Karen showed for Styles. On the May29 episode of Impact!, Cornette announced Angle versus Styles for the event. Angle sustained a severe neck injury in early May with several TNA officials believing Angle would not recover in time to perform at the show. Angle was still in pain a few days prior to Slammiversary but was expected to perform normally despite some officials feeling {{it was too soon}} to compete.|$|E

5|$|The {{rivalry between}} A.J. Styles and Kurt Angle {{continued}} after Hard Justice leading into No Surrender. On the August14 episode of Impact!, Styles fought Angle in an Olympic Wrestling match for Angle's 1996 Summer Olympics {{gold medal in}} freestyle wrestling. Styles defeated Angle to win the medal on the telecast. Styles and Angle fought a week later on the August 21 episode of Impact! in a ladder match for the medal, with Styles retaining the medal. Styles {{then went on to}} feud with Angle's on-screen bestfriend Frank Trigg, who attacked Styles with a kendo stick during Styles' Four Ways to Glory qualification match with Cage, costing Styles to bout in the process. This led to Styles challenging Trigg to a bout at No Surrender, which Trigg agreed to but only if it was contested under Mixed Martial Arts rules on the September11 episode of Impact!. Styles and Trigg fought to a no contest at No Surrender due to Styles accidentally hitting Trigg in the groin. Afterwards, Styles beat Trigg with a kendo stick to end their feud. On the September25 episode of Impact!, Styles was ordered to return Angle's gold medal by Jeff Jarrett, who had taken a role as a TNA management authority figure. The medal was returned <b>to</b> <b>Angle</b> on the October9 episode of Impact! by Jarrett.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. —Although a {{great deal}} of effort has been {{expended}} to try to understand the consequences of fishing-induced selection by commercial fisheries, relatively little effort has been put into trying to understand the selective effects of recreational angling. We conducted a long-term selection experiment to assess the heritability of vulnerability <b>to</b> <b>angling</b> in largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides. Three successive generations of artificially selected largemouth bass were produced from a single experimental study population. Within each generation, individual adult largemouth bass were identified as having either high or low vulnerability <b>to</b> <b>angling</b> through a series of controlled catch-and-release angling trials. Individuals of each vulnerability group (high and low) were then selected from that population for breeding to produce the next generation. The response to selection for vulnerability <b>to</b> <b>angling</b> increased with each generation; that is, the magnitude of the difference between the high- and low-vulnerability groups of fish increased with each successive generation. Realized heritability was calculated as 0. 146 (r 2 0. 995), indicating that th...|$|R

Monitoring the trajectories of these two distinct forms of bubbles, I found that the spherical bubbles had significantly lower terminal velocities. Also, I found that the spherical and ellipsoidal bubbles had distinct trajectory-state transitions.
