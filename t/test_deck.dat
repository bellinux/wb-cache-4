The tests {{included}} firing destroyer armament at the upper works at close range to test their effectiveness in a simulated night engagement, direct hits from 13.5-inch shells, bomb tests, and experiments with flash tightness in the magazines. The first two tests were conducted in July 1931, and were simulations of magazine explosions. The venting system worked as designed, and while the explosions caused serious internal damage, Marlborough was not destroyed, as the three battlecruisers had been at Jutland. In 1932, further tests were conducted with dummy [...] and [...] bombs to <b>test</b> <b>deck</b> strength; [...] armour-piercing (AP) bombs and [...] high explosive (HE) bombs were then detonated inside the ship to test their effectiveness. The Royal Navy determined that the HE bombs were useless, but that thick deck armour would be required to defeat AP bombs. This led to the decision to reinforce the deck armour of existing battleships throughout the 1930s.|$|E

40|$|One {{controversial}} area in {{the broad}} spectrum of accounting knowledge {{is the effect of}} electronic data processing upon its future. Just as automation has changed or eliminated many other career opportunities, so has it changed that of the public accountant. In an attempt to understand the development of this subject and its potential effect upon the accounting profession, a survey has been made of current literature pertinent to the subject. From a study of the writings, it has been perceived that certain ideas have achieved a consensus of thinking within the profession. This paper will develop important points about auditing an electronic data processing system. Following a brief history, the two current auditing methods will be examined. The use of the computer as an audit tool and the benefits derived therefrom will be discussed, followed by a summarization of the effect of EDP upon internal controls. New internal controls which are needed will also be surveyed. Behind the review of internal controls, naturally, comes the beginning of the audit itself. The <b>test</b> <b>deck</b> and the auditor's program will be compared and scrutinized. Supporting the program are several audit procedures, some of which are new and exciting in their potential ramifications. Many of the newer techniques require one to have a degree of special training. How can the experienced auditor attain this special knowledge? They are also causing other questions. Has auditing become obsolete? What is the auditors’ future? These and other questions will continue to cause much deep thought among accountants. For truly, electronic data processing is the auditor's challenge. Honors CollegeThesis (B. ?. ...|$|E

40|$|Pavement marking {{technology}} is a continually evolving subject. There are numerous types of materials used in the field today, including (but not limited to) paint, epoxy, tape, and thermoplastic. Each material has {{its own set of}} unique characteristics related to durability, retro reflectivity, installation cost, and life-cycle cost. The Iowa Highway Research Board was interested in investigating the possibility of developing an ongoing program to evaluate the various products used in pavement marking. This potential program would maintain a database of performance and cost information to assist state and local agencies in determining which materials and placement methods are most appropriate for their use. The Center for Transportation Research and Education at Iowa State University has completed Phase I of this research: to identify the current practice and experiences from around the United States to recommend a further course of action for the State of Iowa. There has been a significant amount of research completed in the last several years. Research from Michigan, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Ohio, and Alaska all had some common findings: white markings are more retro reflective than yellow markings; paint is by-and-large the least expensive material; paint tends to degrade faster than other materials; thermoplastic and tapes had higher retro reflective characteristics. Perhaps the most significant program going on in the area of pavement markings is the National Transportation Product Evaluation Program (NTPEP). This is an ongoing research program jointly conducted by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials and its member states. Field and lab tests on numerous types of pavement marking materials are being conducted at sites representing four climatological areas. These results are published periodically for use by any jurisdiction interested in pavement marking materials performance. At this time, it is recommended that the State of Iowa not embark on a <b>test</b> <b>deck</b> evaluation program. Instead, close attention should be paid to the ongoing evaluations of the NTPEP program. Materials that fare well on the NTPEP test de cks should be considered for further field studies in Iowa...|$|E
40|$|Pavement markings, {{as a form}} {{of traffic}} control devices, {{play a crucial role in}} safely guiding drivers. Restriping {{pavement}} markings is an important task in the maintenance of traffic control devices. Every year state agencies spend a lot of money in maintaining pavement markings as the retroreflectivity or durability values of the markings fall below a minimum level. Currently, the most widely adopted method used to determine the presence conditions of pavement markings is by expert observation, a subjective technique that may not provide consistent and convinced results for agencies. Hence, a fast and accurate way to determine the presence conditions of pavement markings can lead to significant cost savings while ensuring driving safety. In this study, a systematic approach that can automatically determine the presence conditions of pavement markings using digital image processing techniques is presented. These techniques are used to correct the geometric deformity, detect colors of pavement markings, segment images, enhance images, detect edge lines of ideal pavement markings, and recognize the features of pavement markings appearing in the photographs. To better implement the aforementioned techniques, a software package has been developed by Graphic User Interface (GUI) as a platform to simultaneously evaluate the presence conditions of single or multiple pavement markings. The developed software package is able to do operations such as open files, calibrate camera calibration, clip, rotation, histogram display, and detection of edge lines of ideal pavement markings. The above system was tested and evaluated with the photograph datasets provided by the NTPEP Mississippi <b>test</b> <b>deck.</b> The empirical results (when compared with the manual method and expert observation) show that the developed system in this study is accurate and reliable. Additionally, the interactivity of the developed software package is satisfactory due to the feedback from ten volunteers. It is also concluded that the developed system, as an important reference, potentially helps agencies make a better decision in the maintenance of pavement markings with more accurate and speedy evaluation of the presence conditions of pavement markings...|$|E

40|$|The {{susceptibility}} {{of modern}} bridges to vortex-shedding-induced vibration {{is a major}} concern for researchers and designers. The relevance of this phenomenon is associated with the onset of large-amplitude aeroelastic vibration at moderate wind-velocity regimes due to synchronization, that is, lock-in, of the vortex shedding frequencies with those corresponding to the natural modes of the structure. Recent observations, either recorded during the monitoring of full-scale bridges or during experimental <b>tests</b> of <b>deck</b> models in wind tunnels, confirm the importance of these aspects during the operational life of the structure. In this article, a computer model for the simulation of the aeroelastic loading associated with vortex shedding in lock-in regime is presented, for a direct application to dynamic analysis of long-span bridges. This approach is based on earlier work focused on the response of slender vertical cylindrical chimneys to vortex-shedding excitation, which is here extended to noncircular cross sections. The numerical model was employed in conjunction with a finite-element code for time-domain nonlinear simulation of the structural dynamic response.
