5|$|AD is also {{considered}} a tauopathy due to abnormal aggregation of the tau protein. Every neuron has a cytoskeleton, an internal support structure partly {{made up of}} structures called microtubules. These microtubules act like tracks, guiding nutrients and molecules {{from the body of}} the cell <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ends</b> of the axon and back. A protein called tau stabilises the microtubules when phosphorylated, and is therefore called a microtubule-associated protein. In AD, tau undergoes chemical changes, becoming hyperphosphorylated; it then begins to pair with other threads, creating neurofibrillary tangles and disintegrating the neuron's transport system.|$|E

5|$|In 1802, George hired Reverend Thomas Frognall Dibdin as an {{official}} librarian {{to look after the}} collection and the library contains his many catalogues entitled Aedes Althorpianæ, documenting the books of the library. The collection became so enormous that the massive library became inadequate to hold the contents, and books began being stored along the long picture gallery on the first floor above it. By the time of George John's death in 1834, he had amassed one of the largest private collections in Europe of some 110,000 volumes. Alcoves were added <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ends</b> of the library during the Holland restoration, creating extra room for the growing collection.|$|E
5|$|On December 14, 2014 Naasón Joaquín García, {{the fifth}} {{born of the}} Joaquin family, became the spiritual leader and {{international}} director of La Luz del Mundo church. Naasón was born on May 7, 1969 and previously served as pastor in Santa Ana, California. After almost three years of arduous work Naasón continues to lead the church, with ambition to fulfill a promise he received from God in a vision, that La Luz del Mundo Church will grow to a number that he could never imagine or perceive. He also urges the youth {{and members of the}} church to join him in spreading their doctrine <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ends</b> of the earth.|$|E
5|$|Synthetic gem-quality diamond {{crystals}} {{were first}} produced in 1970 by GE, then reported in 1971. The first successes used a pyrophyllite tube seeded {{at each end}} with thin pieces of diamond. The graphite feed material {{was placed in the}} center and the metal solvent (nickel) between the graphite and the seeds. The container was heated and the pressure was raised to about 5.5GPa. The crystals grow as they flow from the center <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ends</b> of the tube, and extending the length of the process produces larger crystals. Initially, a week-long growth process produced gem-quality stones of around 5mm (1 carat or 0.2 g), and the process conditions had to be as stable as possible. The graphite feed was soon replaced by diamond grit because that allowed much better control of the shape of the final crystal.|$|E

5|$|The {{species has}} also been {{identified}} in living sapwood, though it is latent at this time, and {{it is probable that}} it waits until the wood begins to die (when it is drier, but contains more oxygen) before the mycelia begin to grow. When the species was inoculated into living wood, it did grow, but only around the inoculation wound; the species did not spread as it would have done on dead wood. Another study found that the species actively colonised partially living branches, causing white rot. However, the species had little effect on the cambium, and was mostly limited <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ends</b> of branches.|$|E
5|$|In a {{biological}} symbiosis one organism typically shores up some weakness or deficiency of the other(s). As {{in such a}} symbiosis, Odin the father of all humans and gods, though in human form was imperfect by himself. As a separate entity he lacked depth perception (being one-eyed) and he was apparently also uninformed and forgetful. But his weaknesses were compensated by his ravens, Hugin (mind) and Munin (memory) {{who were part of}} him. They perched on his shoulders and reconnoitered <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ends</b> of the earth each day to return in the evening and tell him the news. He also had two wolves at his side, and the man/god-raven-wolf association was like one single organism in which the ravens were the eyes, mind, and memory, and the wolves the providers of meat and nourishment. As god, Odin was the ethereal part—he only drank wine and spoke only in poetry. I wondered if the Odin myth was a metaphor that playfully and poetically encapsulates ancient knowledge of our prehistoric past as hunters in association with two allies to produce a powerful hunting alliance. It would reflect a past that we have long forgotten and whose meaning has been obscured and badly frayed as we abandoned our hunting cultures to become herders and agriculturists, to whom ravens act as competitors.|$|E

25|$|Several {{traditional}} {{players have}} used hammers that differ substantially {{from those in}} common use today.

The Irish player John Rea (1915–1983) used hammers made of thick steel wire, wound with wool. He made these himself from old bicycle spokes.
