[...] The album title was changed at the last minute, first to a self-titled album and then to Vs., a nod to the general theme of conflict present in most of the songs on the album.

He became the most prevalent Simpsons character on memorabilia, such as T-shirts. In the early 1990s, millions of T-shirts featuring Bart were sold; as many as one million were sold on some days. Believing Bart to be a bad role model, several American public schools banned T-shirts featuring Bart next to captions such as [...] "I'm Bart Simpson. Who <b>the</b> <b>hell</b> <b>are</b> you?" [...] and [...] "Underachiever ('And proud of it, man!')". The Simpsons merchandise sold well and generated $2 billion in revenue during the first 14 months of sales.

Three days before the tour started, the band, returning from a five-day Swedish tour, were greeted at Heathrow Airport in heavy rain by thousands of screaming fans, 50 journalists and photographers, and a BBC TV camera crew. The wild scenes at the airport caused the British Prime Minister, being chauffeured in the vicinity, to be delayed, his car obstructed by the crowds. Meanwhile, the current Miss World, passing through the airport herself, was completely ignored by journalists and public alike, and when the American TV presenter Ed Sullivan, numbered among those held up at Heathrow, was told {{the reason for the}} delay, he asked, [...] "Who <b>the</b> <b>hell</b> <b>are</b> The Beatles?". Not long after, there would be similar scenes at an airport in Sullivan's own country, when the Beatles' arrived there for the first time, and he would himself introduce the band to the American nation on The Ed Sullivan Show, watched by 73million viewers.|$|E

2500|$|The Band {{gained a}} {{nickname}} while marching at the Richmond parade, honoring Field Marshal Ferdinand Foch of France in 1921. The drum major attempted a mace toss {{as he passed}} the reviewing stand. The wind blew the mace and it fell to ground, bouncing once. The drum major caught the mace off the bounce and still rendered a proper salute to the reviewing officer. Field Marshal Foch supposedly said 'hoity-toity' (show-off in French) {{in response to the}} drum major's display. For many years this was believed to be the origin of the band's name. However, history states that the name came from a cheer that was invented when the band was housed in Division E, the fifth stairwell of Lane Hall. While waiting for meals, each unit would give up a cheer. The bandsmen were tired of not having a name, and made up a cheer that went: [...] "Highty Tighty, Christ Almighty, who <b>the</b> <b>hell</b> <b>are</b> we? Riff ramm, goddamn, we're from Division E." [...] It has since evolved over the years.|$|E
