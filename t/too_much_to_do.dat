25|$|Revie gave Hughes the England {{captaincy}} {{back for}} a Home International match against Scotland when Keegan was unavailable, before selecting him for the squad which would tour South America in the summer. On return to England, Ron Greenwood took over as England manager, returning the captaincy to Hughes. England left <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> after the defeat by Italy {{to qualify for the}} World Cup, but Hughes nonetheless celebrated a 50th cap when England beat the Italians 2–0 in the final qualifier at Wembley at the end of 1977.|$|E
25|$|McIlroy's tough {{schedule}} eventually {{caught up}} with him as he missed the cut at his next two events. First at the BMW PGA Championship, he opened with an average one-under-par 71 but faded the next day to a 6-over 78. He claiming mental fatigue got the better of him and not its physical counterpart. The following week at the Irish Open, McIlroy shot a first round 80 to lie 9-over and in a tie for last place. The following day he managed a level-par 71 around Royal County Down which left him 4 shots off the halfway cut. McIlroy stated he had left himself <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> after a poor Thursday performance in front of his home Northern Irish fans and at the event he now hosts. He later said he was looking forward to a break after five tournaments in a row.|$|E

25|$|When Marge {{escapes from}} the {{courtroom}} {{and goes to the}} library to see who Becky really is, she realizes that she is insane and being unfair to Becky, after finding nothing bad about her and a newspaper tablet of how Marge ruined Becky's marriage. Finally, she returns home, only to find Homer tied up, Lisa's arms and legs stuck to the wall, Maggie stuck in a cage, and Becky holding a knife in her hands. When Becky is about to 'kill' Homer, Marge snatches the knife from her and attempts to strangle her. It turns out that Bart is filming a scene in his movie for the school (now a music video). Homer also reveals that while he was fixing Marge's car, he accidentally drained the brake fluid. Marge apologizes to Becky, but Becky admits she was going to kill Marge and steal her family, but decided not to after she couldn't get a shovel. Suddenly the mental hospital doctors show up and shoot three tranquilizer darts into Marge's neck, which don't take effect. Marge tells them that she has <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> to take a nap. She instructs Lisa to take Maggie out of the cage and tells Homer that she has some 'S for him' - scrubbing and mopping, since he is dressed for the job anyway. As Marge giggles, Homer fires a dart borrowed from the doctors into her, which sends her straight to sleep.|$|E
25|$|In {{the winter}} of 2015 Hampshire {{completed}} the signing of England seamer Reece Topley from Essex. The club also announced that Fidel Edwards had signed a new deal and South African all rounder Ryan McLaren had signed as an overseas player. On 14 January 2016, Hampshire Cricket was announced as one of six new teams in the inaugural Women's Cricket Super League. Hampshire, in partnership with Berkshire, Dorset, Isle of Wight, Oxfordshire, Sussex and Wiltshire cricket boards along with Southampton Solent University, will compete in a women's Twenty20 competition against the other team. On 28 January 2016 Hampshire appointed former Wiltshire coach Nick Denning as their inaugural coach for their Women's team. Following the appointment of Denning, Hampshire announced the naming of their Women's Cricket Super League team as the Southern Vipers. The Vipers then won the inaugural Kia Super League on 21 August, defeating Western Force in the final by 7 wickets. Overseas star Suzie Bates was named as player of the tournament. For the male team {{though it was a}} season of disappointment. A large number of injuries {{at the start of the}} season, including to fast bowlers Reece Topley, Fidel Edwards, Chris Wood and Ryan Stevenson, coupled with poor form and tough circumstances, after the death of trialist fast bowler Hamza Ali in a drowning accident, and long serving opening batsman Michael Carberry being diagnosed with a cancerous lung tumour, saw Hampshire suffer a poor season, being knocked out in the group stages of both the Natwest t20 Blast, where they missed out on Finals Day for the first time since 2009, and the Royal London One-Day Cup. Their championship season was much the same as in 2015, again making a slow start, but they gave themselves <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> and were relegated back to Division Two after defeat against Durham on 23 September 2016. However, on 3 October 2016 Hampshire were given a reprieve as Durham were relegated to Division Two after taking up a financial package from the ECB to help with their finances, with their relegation and a points deduction being the fine for taking this agreement. Coach Dale Benkenstein departed as coach for 'Personal Reasons' in mid-July and was replaced by Craig White originally in a caretaker role, before taking over as full-time first team coach in November. At the end of the season, long serving seamer James Tomlinson retired having been with Hampshire since 2002 and making over 150 appearances in all formats for Hampshire. The Winter of 2017 saw Hampshire draw criticism over the signings of Kyle Abbott and Rilee Rossouw on Kolpak deals, with these players giving up international cricket to represent Hampshire. On the field Hampshire again had a mixed season in first class cricket, avoiding relegation for the 3rd season in a row by drawing against already relegated Warwickshire meaning relegation for Middlesex, with Kolpak Abbott taking 60 wickets across the First-class season. In List A cricket Hampshire again missed out on the knockout stages. However Hampshire performed better in Twenty20 cricket, qualifying for their 7th Finals Day in 8 years, although they lost in the Semi-final to eventual winners Nottinghamshire. They also recorded their highest Twenty20 score in their Quarter final victory over Derbyshire scoring 249-8, with Pakistan overseas player Shahid Afridi scoring a century.|$|E

2500|$|A late 19th-century {{real estate}} magazine, believing Low to be {{patterned}} after a French church by [...] "the architect Rumpf", criticised the design, writing that [...] "there is scarcely any original designing {{done in this}} city, except {{the vagaries of the}} incompetent. The rest is mostly a copybook reproduction of classical and other detail.

2500|$|In {{addition}} to his other interests, Laird founded the Xeric Foundation, a nonprofit organization created after considerable thought, as [...] "an appropriate way to give back something extra to the comics world," [...] by providing grants for self-publishers. While Eastman founded Tundra Publishing to embody {{the ideals of the}} Creator's Bill of Rights from a publishers standpoint, Laird's vision involved funding rather than actively publishing individuals' work. His reasoning for this decision was in part simply due to him having [...] "far <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> as it is with Mirage." [...] He [...] "preferred to do something where {{it was more of a}} transfer of capital," [...] with [...] "all the worries... on other people's shoulders." [...] The foundation itself, he explains is: [...] "actually two foundations in one. One half of it is for charitable organizations, and the other half is for creators who want to self-publish their comics." [...] That later half is perhaps what the foundation is best known for, working much the same as any benevolent fund, involving an applicatory process detailing how much money is being applied for and why.|$|E
