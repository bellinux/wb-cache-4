5|$|The {{construction}} of large dams, {{especially in the}} mid and {{upper reaches of the}} system have significantly affected the ability of fish to migrate up and down the river, and into the Sea of Japan. There has also been {{a significant increase in the}} amount of fishing which takes place in the system which is associated with the introduction of invasive fish species and waterbirds into the system. The development of the river, and human settlement, has also resulted in the environmental degradation of key fish habitat. Changes in the system have affected its ability to support and maintain fish species which are endemic to the river. Some actions have been taken <b>to</b> <b>overcome</b> <b>these</b> <b>issues,</b> including prohibitions on fishing salmon during breeding and stocking certain areas for fishing, especially in areas where Tsukeba fish shacks (popup stores along the riverbank) are regularly set up.|$|E

500|$|Sustainability {{of such a}} tall {{building}} {{would include}} issues such as vertical transportation limitations, with elevators only {{being able to go}} so far, building sway, caused by wind, and supercolumn settling, which occurs because concrete tends to shrink as it hydrates and settles under load, whereas steel is dimensionally stable, thereby causing the floors to become unlevel. Additionally, a very large core size is required in very tall buildings to support the structure as well as to house the large number of elevators needed. The core size consumes a significant amount of the space on the lower and middle floors. One of the ways Jeddah Tower attempts <b>to</b> <b>overcome</b> <b>these</b> <b>issues</b> is with its smooth, sloped-exterior design, which, although more expensive to build, offers superior aerodynamic performance over [...] "stepped" [...] designs such as the Burj Khalifa, allowing it to have a more conservative core overall. This was determined by wind tunnel tests performed at Burj Khalifa. Jeddah Tower will also utilize copious stiffening materials to prevent the excessive sway that would otherwise make the occupants of upper floors nauseated on windy days, including very high strength concrete that will be up to several metres thick in certain parts of the core. This, along with the highly integrated steel frame and shear walls, is also intended to prevent catastrophic failure of the structure {{in the event of a}} terrorist attack. Traditionally, the space consumed by elevators was considered to make a building become increasingly less profitable past 80 floors or so. More recently, it has been the advent of truly mixed-use design such as Shanghai Tower and Burj Khalifa, as well as improved building technology, that have outdated this rule of thumb, which generally applied to single use buildings.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Recently {{there has}} been much {{research}} focus on the use of Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms for game agent control. However, although {{it has been shown that}} such agents are capable of learning in real time, the high dimensionality of agent sensor state spaces still prove to be a significant barrier to progress. This paper outlines an approach to dealing with this issue by using a modular RL architecture with a fine granularity of modules. The modular approach enables a reduction of the dimensionality in complex game-like environments by dividing the state space into smaller, more manageable sub tasks. While this approach is successful in reducing dimensionality, challenges with action selection, exploration and reward allocation arise.
