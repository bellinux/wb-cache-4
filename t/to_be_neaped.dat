40|$|Abstract. Climbing ripples {{characterize}} {{a variety}} of sedimentary depositional settings in which suspension sedimentation exceeds the rate of traction transport, but are poorly documented from tidal environments. Research within a modem macrotidal estuary (Bay of Mont-Saint-Michel, France) demonstrates that this form of stratification is very common and also closely associated with tidal dynamics along the fluvio-tidal transition zone of macrotidal estuaries. Flood- and ebb-dominated climbing ripple facies (CRF) have been distinguished. Successive climbing ripple units are up 10 cm in thickness. Flood dominated CRF are associated with tidal channel levees found in the inner/straight channel zone of the fluvio-estuarine transition. In thicker CRF units, sedimentary structures indicate very high suspended sediment loads and rapidly decelerating flow velocity. Ebb-dominated CRF are found in chute channels and chute bars associated with the meandering zone of the fluvial-estuarine transition. The role of tidal dynamics {{in the formation of}} these CRF, both flood- and ebb-dominated, is indicated by the vedical organization and thickness evolution of the successive climbing ripple units. They are frequently ananged in packages of strata which thicken and thin progressively. These packages are tidal rhy{hmites and correspond to the sedimentary record of the neap-spring-neap cycle. The increasing energy from <b>neap</b> <b>to</b> spring tides <b>is</b> indicated by an overall decreasing angle of climb in the generalized bedding sequence (progradation is dominant), whereas the decreasing energy from spring <b>to</b> <b>neap</b> <b>is</b> evidenced by an increase of this angle (vertical accretion is dominant).

40|$|This study investigates tidal {{propagation}} in Plymouth Sound and Tamar Estuary in South-West England. Due to {{the complex}} water level changes and tidal water motion in coastal and estuarine environments, {{it is essential for}} scientific, commercial and recreational purposes to have most detailed understanding of present tidal patterns. It <b>is</b> aimed <b>to</b> provide additional information about tidal propagation and the associated tidal patterns in the mesotidal/macrotidal Plymouth Sound and Tamar estuary (Dyer, 1998). Tidal water level changes were measured for 15 days (half a tidal cycle) at four locations along the estuary using pressure sensors. Data was analysed with focus on tidal asymmetry, tidal lag, tidal range damping and energy dissipation. Furthermore, recorded data <b>was</b> compared <b>to</b> UKHO predictions, with a focus on the above listed aspects. Findings of the work confirm expected increase in tidal asymmetry, tidal lag, range damping and energy dissipation with increasing distance to the mouth of the embayment. These processes <b>were</b> found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> weakened during <b>neap</b> tide conditions. From an energetic perspective, Plymouth Sound and the lower Tamar were identified as weakly dissipative, whereas the upper Tamar can be regarded as moderately to strongly dissipative, particularly during spring tides. Some aspects, such as classification by tidal range were identified less clear, due to the relatively short recoding period. Major cause of the above listed changes in the tide during propagation through the estuary was bed friction or shear stress, which increases with rising flow velocities and in shallower water during spring tides. Additionally, change in river discharge through precipitation <b>was</b> found <b>to</b> have a strong influence on the tide in the upper estuary, further increasing non-linear changes. Findings show that the lower Tamar and Plymouth Sound are strongly tide dominated, where river discharge is of little relevance.

40|$|Wind-driven (aeolian) sand {{transport}} {{from the}} beach is of prime importance to coastal dune formation and growth, as well as dune recovery after a severe storm. The amount of aeolian sand transport is not only determined by wind speed, but also by beach surface characteristics, predominantly moisture content. The surface moisture content is determined by processes in the atmosphere (evaporation and precipitation) and in the groundwater (via capillary transport). The groundwater level below the beach is governed mostly by the tide. However, the exact importance of the tide in determining surface moisture content is still unknown. Therefore, the present study aims to find this relation, {{in order to better}} understand and predict aeolian sediment transport patterns in the future. A six-week field campaign was performed at the Sand Motor in fall 2014. Sea surface elevation was measured with a pressure transducer below the low-water line, while 8 dipwells <b>were</b> deployed <b>to</b> measure groundwater levels in a 80 -m long cross-shore array. A Delta T Theta probe <b>was</b> used <b>to</b> measure surface moisture content along the same array. It was found that the tide and the bed profile control the spatial and temporal patterns in surface moisture content. The tidal oscillations in the sea surface propagate into the beach, which makes the water table below the beach oscillate with tidal frequency. The inland water table of the Sand Motor is located 1 m above NAP. The slope of the water table is relatively constant, and it is independent of the slope of the beach surface. Therefore, a low beach slope results in an intersection of the water table and the bed surface. This gives a high surface moisture content. The water table affects the surface moisture content at the Sand Motor when it is within 0. 3 m below the bed surface. In this case the potential for aeolian sand transport can be reduced. A spring-neap tidal cycle was found in the amount of time throughout the day that this influence <b>was</b> present.

Nutrient loading per area of estuary to the saline portion of the Hudson is probably the highest for any major estuary in North America. Approximately 58 % of the nitrogen and 81 % of the phosphorus comes from wastewater effluent and other urban discharges in the New York City metropolitan area. Some 42 % of the nitrogen and 19 % of the phosphorus comes from upriver tributary sources. For nitrogen, these tributary inputs are dominated by nonpoint sources, with atmospheric deposition from fossil fue...|$|R
40|$|The present work <b>was</b> {{carried out}} <b>to</b> verify the {{occurrence}} {{and distribution of}} Cymbasoma longispinosum Bourne, 1890 in a tropical Amazon estuary from North Brazil. Samplings were performed bimonthly from July/ 2003 to July/ 2004 at two different transects (Muriá and Curuçá rivers) situated along the Curuçá estuary (Pará, North Brazil). Samples <b>were</b> collected during <b>neap</b> tides via gentle (1 to 1. 5 knots) 200 &# 956;m-mesh net tows from a small boat. Additional subsurface water samples were collected for the determination of environmental parameters. Males and females of Cymbasoma longispinosum were only observed during September and November/ 2003. The highest number of organisms was found in September/ 2003 at the Muriá River transect. The presence of C. longispinosum in samples obtained during September and November/ 2003 could probably <b>be</b> related <b>to</b> the reproductive period of this species in the studied estuary, which <b>is</b> directly related <b>to</b> the dry period in the region. The highest salinity values and {{the highest number of}} individuals observed in September/ 2003 corroborate with the previous assumption, since no C. longispinosum was found during the months comprising the rainy period (January to June) ...|$|R
50|$|The {{owners of}} the mills rebuilt the structure, {{referred}} to as a lock, in 1573. In order to ensure that navigation would be maintained on the Lea, the City of London appointed a Dutch surveyor to inspect the plans, and a committee to oversee the work. A report by Lord Burghley in 1588 suggests that the gates opened automatically when the level in Bow Creek exceeded the level above the lock, and were shut once the tide started to fall. This arrangement caused complaints in 1581, when neap tides did not reach a level to cause the gates to open, and the lock keeper would not open them because the water was used by the mills. The use of flashboards was again recorded in the 1660s, but shortly after 1713, the cill of the structure was raised, and a pair of gates were installed. This improved water levels for the millers, but again caused problems for navigation, with bargees complaining that the gates could not <b>be</b> opened at <b>neap</b> tides. In 1721, the cill was lowered by the mill owners, following recommendations by George Succold, and the work was overseen by a surveyor appointed by the City of London.|$|R
40|$|Time {{series of}} {{salinity}} and suspended-solids concentration measured at four locations and vertical profiles of salinity and suspended-solids concentration measured during 48 waterquality cruises from January 1993 <b>to</b> September 1997 <b>are</b> analyzed <b>to</b> describe {{the influence of}} salinity, bottom topography, and tides on locations of estuarine turbidity maxima in northern San Francisco Bay, California. Estuarine turbidity maxima form when salinity is present {{but they are not}} associated with a singular salinity. Bottom topography enhances salinity stratification, gravitational circulation and estuarine turbidity maxima formation seaward of sills. The spring/neap tidal cycle affects locations of estuarine turbidity maxima. Salinity stratification in Carquinez Strait, which is seaward of a sill, <b>is</b> greatest during <b>neap</b> tides, which <b>is</b> the only time when tidally averaged suspended-solids concentration in Carquinez Strait was less than that observed landward at Mallard Island. Spring tides cause the greatest vertical mixing and suspended-solids concentration in Carquinez Strait. Therefore, surface estuarine turbidity maxima always were located in or near the Strait (seaward of Middle Ground) during spring tide cruises, regardless of salinity. During neap tides, surface estuarine turbidity maxima always were observed in the landward half of the study area (landward of Middle Ground) and between 0 – 2 practical salinity units. 1...|$|R
40|$|Estimates of {{vertical}} fluxes of nitrate (JN) into the subsurface chlorophyll maximum {{from the bottom}} mixed layer were made {{in a variety of}} hydrological regimes over the Celtic Sea in 2003 and 2005. Over a topographically flat shelf JN varied with the spring-neap tidal cycle (1. 1 (neap) – 2. 8 (spring) mmol m- 2 day- 1), driven by changes in barotropic shear generated vertical diffusivities (Kz) {{at the base of the}} thermocline. Further increases in nitrate fluxes were possible through small shear perturbations. JN is further enhanced over topographic features, such as banks on the shelf or the shelf break, by the generation and dissipation of lee waves. The strength of mixing driven by the lee waves also varies with the spring-neap cycle, with higher Kz at the base of the thermocline occurring around spring tide, compared to neap tide, associated with the greater occurrence of short period internal waves. Over banks vertical nitrate fluxes varied between 2. 9 (neap) – 15. 7 (spring) mmol N m- 2 day- 1 and over the shelf break estimated vertical nitrate fluxes <b>were</b> 4 (<b>neap)</b> – 15 (spring) mmol m- 2 day- 1. These fluxes are capable of supporting new production of 207 mg C m- 2 day- 1 over the Celtic Sea shelf, which over the summer stratified period is potentially greater than the new production taking place in the spring bloom. Enhanced production of 1200 mg C m- 2 day- 1 is supportable over regions of the shelf affected by the generation of lee waves over banks. This equated to a 4 % increase in new production within the SCM over the Celtic Sea shelf. 31 % of new production in the Celtic Sea was associated with the shelf break, where 660 mg C m- 2 day- 1 could be supported in the shelf break region.

40|$|Aim: The gold {{standard}} of measurement for net endogenous acid production (<b>NEAP)</b> <b>is</b> net acid excretion (NAE), {{a test that}} is not readily available, and consequently, estimative equations by Remer and Manz and Frassetto et al. are often used. These equations rely on nutrient databases and {{it is recommended that}} their validity be assessed using a country's database before their application in research in that country. We sought to delineate the accuracy and precision of these estimation equations using the Australian food database. Methods: In a double blind, randomised, cross-over fashion, healthy participants (n[*]=[*] 13) residing in regional Australia <b>were</b> exposed <b>to</b> varying net acid loads while they collected weighted food diaries and 24 -hour urine samples for measurement of NAE. Results: In comparison to the Frassetto et al. equations (equation one bias[*]=[*]− 57. 1 mEq/day, equation two bias[*]= − 32. 8 mEq/day), only the Remer and Manz equation was accurate (bias[*]=[*]− 5. 4 mEq/day); however, all equations were imprecise. Conclusions: Using the Australian database, the performance of these equations to predict NEAP appears equal to other databases; however, caveats apply in their application. For future research, the equation by Remer and Manz is preferential for group estimates. None of the equations are recommended for individual estimates...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{saltwater}} intrusion in the Yangtze River Estuary is very frequent and complicated {{with a great}} effect on freshwater supply in Shanghai and nearby cities. By using the hydrologic data observed in dry season, the temporal and spatial variation of the {{saltwater intrusion}} in the Yangtze River Estuary were analyzed. The {{results show that the}} saltwater intrusion of the south branch is mainly induced by the saltwater spilling over from the north branch, which causes the Chenhang reservoir being plagued by saltwater intrusion during dry season. As the saltwater group from the north branch moving downward along the south branch, the longitudinal salinity distribution present a high-low-high shape during spring tide cycle, low-high-low-high shape during medium tide cycle and low-high shape during neap tide cycle along the south branch-south channel-south passage. Moreover, the north branch is controlled by high saline water with the increase of the salinity in the upstream reach in medium and spring tides, but this phenomenon <b>is</b> vanished in <b>neap</b> tide. In addition, the vertical distribution of salinity is more homogeneous in shoals than that in deep channels, which is induced by mixing degree in water column.

40|$|Estuaries are {{extremely}} dynamic environments that <b>are</b> vulnerable <b>to</b> anthropogenic alterations. Thus, monitoring phytoplankton abundances and composition {{is an essential}} tool for the prediction of eutrophication {{and its effects on}} coastal ecosystems. Phytoplankton biomass, as chlorophyll-a, in the São Vicente estuary (Brazil) varies in response to tidal cycles and seasonal rainfall. Objectives. To present two datasets designed to assess the relationship between chlorophyll-a and changes in water turbidity driven by tide and rain. Methods. Weekly observations were made in the shallow embayment (February to September 2008; site 1) and observations recorded on alternate days (summer 2010, site 2). Results. At site 1, turbidity differed between high and low tides, but on most days was over 3000 RU, maintaining moderate chlorophyll-a levels (4 mg. m- 3) and only two blooms developed during low turbidity. Site 2 mean turbidity was 1500 RU, nutrient level <b>was</b> higher during <b>neap</b> tides and phytoplankton blooms were mainly observed at the end of neap tides at 15 -day intervals, dominated by chain-forming diatoms and occasionally flagellates and pennate diatoms. Conclusions. Taxonomic composition of the blooms was different and their frequency altered by events characterized by intense freshwater discharges from the Henry Borden Hydroelectric Dam (> 9 * 106. m³), inhibiting phytoplankton accumulation during neap tide periods...|$|R
