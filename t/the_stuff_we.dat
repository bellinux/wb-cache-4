500|$|Filming of {{the first}} {{exterior}} scene at Castle Black and the final scene with Jon Snow executing the traitors of the Night's Watch took place {{over the course of}} several months, with the execution scene being filmed first out of the two. As a result of a rock slide that occurred on the set of where Castle Black is staged at Magheramorne Quarry, scheduling for the filming of the scenes had to be re-worked by executive producer Bernie Caulfield and producer Chris Newman, with showrunner D.

500|$|Hetrick {{felt that}} the move away from TNG gave Vash more independence, and she enjoyed the new {{relationship}} between Vash and Quark, calling them [...] "kindred spirits".

Hetrick underwent ten hours of make-up for the sequence where Q shows Vash what could have happened if he did not save her life following an insect bite in the Gamma Quadrant.

It's how <b>the</b> <b>stuff</b> <b>we</b> like was recorded". Series writer Jay Lender said, [...] "The recording sessions were always fun ..." [...] For the first three seasons, Hillenburg and Drymon sat in on the record studio, and they directed the actors.

500|$|In 1994, Conran {{set up a}} bluescreen in {{his living}} room and began {{assembling}} the tools he would need to create his movie. He was not interested in working his way through the system and instead wanted to follow the route of independent filmmakers like Steven Soderbergh. Initially, Kerry and his brother had nothing more than [...] "just a vague idea of this guy who flew a plane. We would talk about all the obvious things like Indiana Jones and all <b>the</b> <b>stuff</b> <b>we</b> liked." [...] Conran spent four years making a black and white teaser trailer in the style of an old-fashioned movie serial on his Macintosh IIci personal computer. Once he was finished, Conran showed it to producer Marsha Oglesby, who was a friend of his brother's wife and she recommended that he let producer Jon Avnet see it. Conran met Avnet and showed him the trailer. Conran told him that he wanted to make it into a movie. They spent two or three days just talking about the tone of the movie.|$|E

It's an incredibly long process." [...] Regular Arcade Fire collaborators Owen Pallett and Colin Stetson provided instrumental parts, alongside English musician David Bowie who provided vocals for the song. Regarding Bowie's guest appearance on the track, multi-instrumentalist Richard Reed Parry noted, [...] "It was just after The Next Day had come out. He basically just came by the studio in New York while we were mixing, just to have a listen to <b>the</b> <b>stuff</b> <b>we</b> were doing. He offered to lend us his services because he really liked the song. In fact, he basically threatened us – he was like, 'If you don't hurry up and mix this song, I might just steal it from you!' So we thought, well why don't we go one better, why don't you sing on our version? Thankfully he obliged, and we were really happy about that." ...|$|E

By the next month she started posting a number of images on social media website Instagram, where she hinted at possible songwriters and collaborators with hashtag captions. Two months later, Madonna posted a selfie where she talked about working with American DJ Diplo. Madonna had invited him to her annual Oscar party, but he was unable to attend. They eventually started talking about music through texts and decided to collaborate on the album. In an interview with Idolator, Diplo explained that Madonna had asked him to provide his [...] "craziest record" [...] for the album. Together they wrote and recorded seven songs and Diplo added that [...] " [...] was up for anything.

500|$|While Ozzy Osbourne {{was working}} on new solo album {{material}} in 2006, Rhino Records released , a compilation of songs culled from the four Black Sabbath releases featuring Ronnie James Dio. For the release, Iommi, Butler, Dio and Appice reunited to write and record three new songs as Black Sabbath. The Dio Years was released on 3 April 2007, reaching number 54 on the Billboard 200, while the single [...] "The Devil Cried" [...] reached number 37 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. Pleased with the results, Iommi and Dio decided to reunite the Mob Rules era line-up for a world tour. While the line-up of Osbourne, Butler, Iommi and Ward were still officially called Black Sabbath, the new line-up opted to call themselves Heaven & Hell, after the album of the same name, to avoid confusion. When asked about {{the name of the}} group, Iommi stated [...] "it really is Black Sabbath, whatever we do... so everyone knows what they're getting [...] so people won't expect to hear 'Iron Man' and all those songs. We've done them for so many years, it's nice to do just all <b>the</b> <b>stuff</b> <b>we</b> did with Ronnie again." ...|$|E
500|$|Soviet Strike {{received}} criticism {{regarding the}} player's limited {{view of his}} surroundings and attacks from enemies out with it. To offset this potential problem, the developers added a radar to the HUD, which illustrated surrounding enemies to the player. Gamers also criticized the difficulty of Soviet Strike. A high difficulty level being traditional to the Strike series, the team {{did not wish to}} alienate long-term fans by making Nuclear Strike directly easier, but instead more accessible, using such devices as the new radar, a new compass indicating the direction of the next objective and [...] "a lot more visual and audible clues". Producer Kosaka explained: [...] "A lot of <b>the</b> <b>stuff</b> <b>we</b> couldn't fit in [...] is going in this one". The team added several new vehicles, as well as continuing the occasional real time strategy sections found in Soviet Strike. The jets proved problematic in early testing due to their speed, but appeared in the final game. Heat-seeking missiles were among other new additions, as was a proprietary technology termed the Interactive Music System. This generates more [...] "pulse pounding" [...] music depending on the level of action occurring in-game. Palomar Studios created the full motion video, for which some footage was shot in both Thailand and the Bronson Cave, used as the Batcave in the 1960s television incarnation of Batman.

500|$|Unlike the band's three {{previous}} albums, {{most of the}} songs on Spiritual Machines were written solely by Maida. “I think that because this record happened quickly, we just ended up using {{a lot more of}} my songs this time,” stated Maida. “Whatever happens, happens, and if there are good ideas lying around, we use them.” Also unlike on their previous albums, this one was recorded sporadically piece by piece with songs being added as others were discarded. Raine had made several vocal demos at his new home recording studio before the Spiritual Machines idea had come into play. Many of these demos were used for the final recordings and Raine was given production credits. “It was more a means to an end." [...] he explained, [...] "I would start off with a 4-track, then move to an 8-track, then go to digital.

500|$|... "Living for Love" [...] {{was written}} and {{produced}} by Madonna, Diplo and Ariel Rechtshaid, with additional writing from MoZella and Toby Gad. Madonna's collaboration with Diplo was revealed in May 2014 through an image on her Instagram showing her {{working on her}} laptop with him. She had invited him for her annual Oscar party, {{and he could not}} make it. So he began texting with her about music and sent some music. Madonna replied with a 20-page text containing her anecdotes on the music. Following this they started collaborating for the album. In an interview with Idolator, Diplo explained that Madonna had asked him to provide his [...] "craziest record" [...] for the album.

[...] According to Diplo, [...] "Living for Love" [...] had almost 20 versions ranging from a piano ballad to an EDM composition, ultimately Madonna and Diplo compromising on a middle level. Rechtshaid and British singer MNEK also joined for writing sessions with them, improving the verse of the song.

One song was composed using a hook Madonna had sung in the studio; Diplo described it as [...] "super weird". Another one, later confirmed as [...] "Living for Love", had nearly twenty versions recorded ranging from a piano ballad to an EDM version. Ultimately Madonna and Diplo compromised on version midway between the two styles. Rechtshaid and British singer MNEK also joined their writing sessions, improving the song's verses. Diplo also confirmed another track, known as [...] "Bitch I'm Madonna", which he believed would push the lyrical boundaries for a pop song. Both Alicia Keys and Ryan Tedder confirmed working on the album, saying that they had contributed to the songwriting with Keys playing piano on [...] "Living for Love". Two other songs, [...] "Messiah" [...] and [...] "Devil Pray", were confirmed by Madonna in different interviews.|$|E

2500|$|The {{title of}} the album is derived from a lyric from {{the bridge of the}} song [...] "Don't Stop". Taggart {{described}} the rationale behind choosing that title. [...] "'Don’t Stop' {{was one of the last}} songs we recorded, and that one kinda summed up all <b>the</b> <b>stuff</b> <b>we</b> had gone through. Raine had just gotten back from Sudan, he was trying to compress all the things he’d experienced.

But they have what we want emotionally, you know." ...|$|E
2500|$|Willem Dafoe as [...] "He": Dafoe, who had {{previously}} worked with Lars von Trier in Manderlay from 2005, was cast after contacting Trier and asking what {{he was working on}} at the moment. He received the script for Antichrist, although he was told that Trier's wife was skeptical about asking a renowned actor like Dafoe to do such an extreme role. Dafoe accepted the part, later explaining its appeal to him: [...] "I think the dark stuff, the unspoken stuff is more potent for an actor. It's <b>the</b> <b>stuff</b> <b>we</b> don't talk about, so if you have the opportunity to apply yourself to that stuff in a playful, creative way, yes I'm attracted to it."

5000|$|Some of {{the scenes}} for the visual were also filmed in private jets, helicopters, and using zip-line, however, they were not {{included}} in the final version. During an interview with Out magazine, Tourso spoke about his collaboration with Beyoncé, calling her [...] "open to mistakes" [...] and praising her work ethic. He recalled that when they were watching the footage that had been filmed for [...] "Heaven", [...] "it was actually all <b>the</b> real <b>stuff</b> <b>we</b> shot that felt powerful and <b>the</b> other <b>stuff</b> <b>we</b> shot that felt kind of corny". While discussing it with the singer, she agreed and the concept behind the clip slightly changed: [...] "It's the same concept the bucket list, but it's not quite as literal and defined. Instead, we had happy vignettes of these two girls throughout their life and it'll just end with her walking through a cemetery. Kind of abstract and less literal in the end. I think it made it much more powerful." ...|$|R

2500|$|In {{addition}} to Dickinson's return to writing, {{the album was}} also notable for its number of co-written pieces, in contrast to its predecessor, with five of the eight tracks being collaborative efforts. According to Harris, this was probably because they [...] "spent more time checking up on each other to see what everybody else was up to, {{just to make sure}} the story fitted properly and went somewhere." [...] To make sure each song fit with the record's concept, the band drew up a basic outline for the story, which Harris states [...] "didn't make the actual writing any easier ... I probably took longer over the writing I've done on this album than any I've done before. But <b>the</b> <b>stuff</b> <b>we</b> all started coming up with, once we'd agreed that we were definitely going for a fully fledged 'concept' album, really startled me. It was so much better than anything we'd done in ages..." ...|$|E

He also backed {{an amendment to the}} state constitution to define marriage as the union {{of a man and a}} woman while also providing by statute [...] "basic civil rights and appropriate benefits to same-sex couples and other nontraditional relationships." [...] Romney quickly joined legislators in attempting to satisfy the Goodridge decision by creating civil unions for same-sex couples. His views were recognized as an attempt to establish his record on a controversial issue while planning to run for the Republican nomination for president. Former Governor Weld took credit for laying the groundwork for the decision: [...] "A lot of <b>the</b> <b>stuff</b> <b>we</b> did foreshadowed the opinion."

In May 2010, Alejandro Arbona, who oversaw {{the creation of the}} comic, explained that the story of the tie-ins had to come [...] "organically from the stuff that happened in Iron Man —what would happen to a man who'd just revealed his super hero identity to the world?—and it had to move us toward <b>the</b> <b>stuff</b> <b>we</b> knew was going to be important in Iron Man 2". In September 2010, Casey noted that writing an MCU tie-in comic required working within the boundaries of the movie continuity and Marvel Studios' plan, as well as writing the characters as portrayed in the films (the [...] "movie version of Stark has a specific attitude" [...] that Casey tried to put in the comic, for example).|$|E

That was the inspiration behind the entire session—to emulate <b>the</b> <b>stuff</b> that <b>we</b> grew up on, and <b>the</b> <b>stuff</b> that Ryan grew up on."
