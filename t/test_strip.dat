25|$|Test strips: A {{consumable}} element containing {{chemicals that}} react with glucose in {{the drop of}} blood is used for each measurement. For some models this element is a plastic <b>test</b> <b>strip</b> with a small spot impregnated with glucose oxidase and other components. Each strip is used once and then discarded. Instead of strips, some models use discs, drums, or cartridges that contain the consumable material for multiple tests.|$|E

40|$|Blood glucose {{monitors}} measure {{blood glucose}} concentration using {{a drop of}} venous, arterial or mainly capillary blood from a finger puncture. Self-monitoring of blood glucose is recognized as one approach to improve glycemic control and reduce hypoglycemic events by alerting diabetic patients to modify their hypoglycemic drug dose, diet, and physical activities. 1 The total Canadian expenditure on blood glucose <b>test</b> <b>strips</b> in 2006 was an estimated $ 370 million. 2 Although these devices were introduced three decades ago, 3 the accuracy obtained from available blood glucose monitors and <b>test</b> <b>strips</b> remains uncertain. 4 This report will review the clinical and cost-effectiveness of alternative blood glucose monitors and <b>test</b> <b>strips</b> available in Canada. RESEARCH QUESTIONS: 1. What is the comparative clinical effectiveness of the available blood glucose monitors and <b>test</b> <b>strips</b> in Canada for patients with diabetes? 2. What factors in blood glucose monitors and <b>test</b> <b>strips</b> are related to better patient outcomes? 3.

30|$|The {{control line}} of <b>test</b> <b>strips</b> {{was used to}} {{determine}} the optimum amount of labeling. For the optimization of labeling amount of SPA, QDs and colloidal gold labeling different concentration of SPA were used. The colloidal gold <b>test</b> <b>strips</b> were inserted into 1.5 -mL test tubes containing 200 μL PBS and the coloring of control line was observed after 10 min. The QD-based <b>test</b> <b>strips</b> were inserted into 1.5 mL test tubes containing 200 μL of QD-labeled SPA solution and the coloring of control line was observed after 10 min. A slight difference was that the results of QDs-based <b>test</b> <b>strips</b> were observed under the portable ultraviolet lamp.|$|R
25|$|The first-generation devices {{relied on}} the same {{colorimetric}} reaction that is still used nowadays in glucose test strips for urine. Besides glucose oxidase, the test kit contains a benzidine derivative, which is oxidized to a blue polymer by the hydrogen peroxide formed in the oxidation reaction. The disadvantage of this method was that the <b>test</b> <b>strip</b> had to be developed after a precise interval (the blood had to be washed away), and the meter needed to be calibrated frequently.|$|E
25|$|In {{a typical}} NPT set up, a small {{table-top}} device is used. A drop of capillary blood is obtained with an automated finger-prick, {{which is almost}} painless. This drop is placed on a disposable <b>test</b> <b>strip</b> with which the machine has been prepared. The resulting INR comes up on the display a few seconds later. A similar form of testing is used by people with diabetes for monitoring blood sugar levels, which is easily taught and routinely practiced.|$|E
500|$|As {{detectable}} {{levels of}} myoglobinemia and myoglobinuria occur, blood tests and urine tests may show {{elevated levels of}} myoglobin. For example, a urine <b>test</b> <b>strip</b> may reveal a positive result for [...] "blood", even though no red blood cells can be identified on microscopy of the urine; this occurs because the reagent on the <b>test</b> <b>strip</b> reacts with myoglobin. The same phenomenon may happen in conditions that lead to hemolysis, the destruction of red blood cells; in hemolysis the blood serum is also visibly discolored, while in rhabdomyolysis it is normal. If kidney damage has occurred, microscopy of the urine also reveals urinary casts that appear pigmented and granular.|$|E
50|$|Ascorbic acid (vitamin C) {{is known}} to {{interfere}} with the oxidation reaction of the blood and glucose pad on common urine <b>test</b> <b>strips.</b> Some urine <b>test</b> <b>strips</b> are protected against the interference with iodate, which eliminates ascorbic acid by oxidation.|$|R
30|$|According to the {{coloring}} of colloidal gold–based <b>test</b> <b>strips,</b> {{the concentration}} of 50 μg/mL presented the strongest red control line. Under or above this concentration would decrease the coloring. Therefore, 50 μg/mL was the best concentration for labeling of colloidal gold. Similarly, QDs-capped SPA prepared with 0.2 mg/mL exhibited the strongest fluorescence intensity and thus this concentration was determined as best one for labeling of QDs. In this work, the naked-eye limit of detection of colloidal gold–based lateral flow <b>test</b> <b>strips</b> could only reach 20 ng/mL of anti-TP 47 polyclonal antibody solution, whereas that of QDs-based <b>test</b> <b>strips</b> could easily reach 2 ng/mL of anti-TP 47 polyclonal antibody solution, tenfold {{higher than that of}} colloidal gold <b>test</b> <b>strips.</b>|$|R

2500|$|Coding: Since {{test strips}} may vary from batch to batch, some models require {{the user to}} {{manually}} enter in a code found on the vial of test strips or on a chip {{that comes with the}} <b>test</b> <b>strip.</b> By entering the coding or chip into the glucose meter, the meter will be calibrated to that batch of test strips. However, if this process is carried out incorrectly, the meter reading can be up to 4 mmol/L (72 mg/dL) inaccurate. The implications of an incorrectly coded meter can be serious for patients actively managing their diabetes. This may place patients at increased risk of hypoglycemia. [...] Alternatively, some test strips contain the code information in the strip; others have a microchip in the vial of strips that can be inserted into the meter. [...] These last two methods reduce the possibility of user error. [...] One Touch has standardized their test strips around a single code number, so that, once set, {{there is no need to}} further change the code in their older meters, and in some of their newer meters, there is no way to change the code.|$|E
