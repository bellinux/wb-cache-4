500|$|Finally, on November 1, the Masked Avengers {{were able}} to talk to Palin. The call began with Trudel, who claimed to be an aide to Sarkozy named [...] "Frank l’ouvrier", talking to an {{assistant}} to Palin who identifies herself as [...] "Lexi". Lexi puts Palin on the line, who says [...] "hello" [...] only to realize that Trudel is still on the other line. Trudel tells Palin to hold on for a moment while he gives the phone to Sarkozy, who is really Audette. Palin can be heard <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>someone</b> in the room about when to hand Palin the phone. Audette then begins to speak and a somewhat extended conversation ensues.|$|E

At about 2:30pm he found Frank McLaury holding a horse and <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>someone</b> on Fourth Street near the corner of Fremont. When he saw Ike Clanton and Tom McLaury near C. S. Fly's photography studio, he walked there with Frank. He told the Cowboys that they must give up their arms. Ike Clanton said he was not armed, and Tom McLaury pulled his coat open to show he was not carrying a weapon.|$|E

500|$|Having {{received}} ITV's improved bid, Parry {{on the day}} of {{the vote}} phoned an anxious Chisholm. He urged him to bid higher and agreed to delay the voting procedure. Chisholm called an emergency meeting, where he was told by one company advisor not to match ITV's offer. Chisholm decided against and phoned Murdoch in New York in the early hours to seek permission to raise BSkyB's bid. Their new offer totalled £304 million; £35 million for 60 live games which rose to £40 million in the fifth year. Chisholm telephoned Parry and faxed him the details of BSkyB's bid. It was claimed that East saw Sugar on the morning of the vote <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>someone</b> about ITV's bid and telling them to [...] "blow them out of the water." [...] Sugar originally denied this, but in later years confessed it was in fact Chisholm.|$|E
500|$|Abraham {{created a}} light-control system {{in an attempt}} to keep the {{overhead}} from being unflattering. However, after unsuccessfully attempting to implement the necessary wiring to control each light, the production team established controlling rows of light. Pat O'Mara, the key grip during production, installed several 2x1 and 2x2 blackout panels and frames that were retrofitted with small albeit strong magnets. During a scene when and actor or actresses stood under a fluorescent light, a panel or a frame was placed over the fixture, subsequently diffusing light onto their faces. [...] "If somebody was walking through the office in a wide shot, I just turned the overhead lights on. But if Don was <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>someone</b> at his desk and the office was the backdrop, I turned all the lights on and then selectively removed some; then, I brought the key around with Kino Flo Image 80s through 4-by-8 frames of 250 or 216, or sourced my key with a larger Fresnel through the window." ...|$|E
500|$|Breeds {{received}} a Logie Award nomination for [...] "Most Popular New Female Talent" [...] at the 51st Logie Awards for her portrayal of Ruby. She was later {{nominated for the}} [...] "Most Popular Actress" [...] Logie in 2010, with Breeds stating: [...] "To know that people like Ruby makes me think I'm doing a good job." [...] At the 2012 Inside Soap Awards, Breeds was nominated for [...] "Best Daytime Star". Holy Soap recall Ruby's most memorable moment as being: [...] "Trying to cope with her Dad's illness, Ruby started <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>someone</b> on Skype, {{only to find out}} it was Matthew playing a trick. She got revenge by convincing him to go skinny-dipping and nicking his clothes." [...] Carolyn Stewart writing for TV Week felt it was unrealistic for Ruby and Nicole to be best friends after she has [...] "actively pursued two of Nicole's ex-boyfriends." [...] She criticised Bianca's role in Ruby and Liam's storyline, quipping [...] "Bianca-The-Butt-In-Ski" [...] offered [...] "her two cents worth" [...] – subsequently calling her efforts unhelpful to Ruby. She also discussed Ruby's sudden descent into drink and wearing make up; [...] "Obviously heavy make-up is a clue that a character is about to go off the rails… and, boy did she!" [...] She said the moral of the storyline was to never {{fall in love with a}} teacher and that the situation had resulted in her as the [...] "drowned-rat Ruby with eye-liner pouring down her face". Stewart later said [...] "The way Ruby stares at Liam... oh, I'm just so embarrassed for the poor little petal! Hilarious!" [...] She also criticised Nicole's bad advice. She later praised the storyline stating it was getting [...] "juicy". Catrin Griffiths writing for the Daily Express said the serial came back in style after its summer break in the UK, owing to storylines such as Ruby's binge drinking.|$|E

2500|$|The {{cast and}} crew {{included}} 700 extras {{who had to be}} trained to simulate blindness. Actor Christian Duurvoort from Meirelles' City of God led a series of workshops to coach the cast members. Duurvoort had researched the mannerisms of blind people to understand how they perceive the world and how they make their way through space. Duurvoort not only taught the extras mannerisms, but also to convey the emotional and psychological states of blind people. One technique was reacting to others as a blind person, whose reactions are usually different from those of a sighted person. Meirelles described, [...] "When you're <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>someone,</b> you see a reaction. When you're blind, the response is much flatter. What's the point ?" ...|$|E
2500|$|There are {{a number}} of myths about suicide. [...] It is not usually unpredictable; in 75-80% of cases, the suicidal person has given some sort of warning sign. [...] A key myth to dispel is that <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>someone</b> about suicide {{increases}} the risk of suicide. [...] This is simply not true. [...] If someone is expressing suicidal thoughts, he/she should be encouraged to seek mental health treatment. [...] Friends and family can provide supportive listening, empathy, and encouragement to develop a safety plan. [...] Serious warning signs of imminent suicidal risk include [...] the intent to commit suicide and a specific plan with access to lethal means. [...] If a person expresses these warning signs, emergency services should be contacted immediately.|$|E
2500|$|The Curse of Monkey Island is a point-and-click {{adventure}} game. The SCUMM {{engine was}} also used in this Monkey Island installment but it was upgraded to a [...] "verb coin" [...] (modelled after Full Throttle), an interface that consisted in a coin-shaped menu with three icons: a hand, a skull, and a parrot, basically representing actions related to hands, eyes and mouth, respectively. These icons implied the actions Guybrush would perform with an object. The hand icon would usually mean actions such as picking something up, operating a mechanism or hitting someone, the skull icon was most used for examining or looking at objects and the parrot icon was used to issue Guybrush commands such as <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>someone</b> or opening a bottle with his teeth. The inventory and actions were thus visible on click, {{rather than on the}} bottom of the screen as previous point-and-click games by Lucasarts.|$|E

2500|$|Hawking has {{estimated}} that he studied about a thousand hours during his three years at Oxford. These unimpressive study habits made sitting his finals a challenge, {{and he decided to}} answer only theoretical physics questions rather than those requiring factual knowledge. A first-class honours degree was a condition of acceptance for his planned graduate study in cosmology at the University of Cambridge. Anxious, he slept poorly the night before the examinations, and the final result was on the borderline between first- and second-class honours, making a viva (oral examination) necessary. Hawking was concerned that he was viewed as a lazy and difficult student. So, when asked at the oral to describe his future plans, he said, [...] "If you award me a First, I will go to Cambridge. If I receive a Second, I shall stay in Oxford, so I expect you will give me a First." [...] He was held in higher regard than he believed; as Berman commented, the examiners [...] "were intelligent enough to realise they were <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>someone</b> far cleverer than most of themselves". After receiving a first-class BA (Hons.) degree in natural science and completing a trip to Iran with a friend, he began his graduate work at Trinity Hall, Cambridge, in October 1962.|$|E

Only one dog remained alive; but there was a human being within it whom the sailors were persuading to enter the vessel. He was not, as the other traveller seemed to be, a savage inhabitant of some undiscovered island, but a European.
