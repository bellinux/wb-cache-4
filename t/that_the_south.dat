40|$|The {{authors have}} in this paper studied the {{differences}} of ocean circulations between <b>the</b> <b>South</b> Pacific Ocean and <b>the</b> <b>South</b> Atlantic Ocean. <b>The</b> Subtropical gyre in <b>the</b> <b>South</b> Pacific reaches to higher latitude than <b>that</b> in <b>the</b> <b>South</b> Atlantic because <b>the</b> maximum westerlies in <b>the</b> <b>South</b> Pacific are at higher latitude than those in <b>the</b> <b>South</b> Atlantic. <b>The</b> low latitude region of <b>the</b> <b>South</b> Pacific is considerably wider than <b>that</b> of <b>the</b> <b>South.</b> Atlantic. Under <b>the</b> assumption of same current velocity in both low latitude regions, {{the western part of}} the low latitude region of <b>the</b> <b>South</b> Pacific accepts more effective heat energy transferred from atmosphere to surface water than <b>that</b> of <b>the</b> <b>South</b> Atlantic. Hence, <b>the</b> temperature of the western part of <b>the</b> tropical <b>South</b> Pacific is higher than of the western part of <b>the</b> <b>South</b> Atlantic. From this analysis it is seen <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Subpolar gyre in <b>the</b> <b>South</b> Atlantic reaches further north than <b>that</b> in <b>the</b> <b>South</b> Pacific. <b>The</b> fact <b>that</b> water temperature of <b>the</b> <b>South</b> Atlantic is lower than <b>that</b> of <b>the</b> <b>South</b> Pacific may be explained by the differences of the ranges of Subtropical and Subpolar gyres in both oceans and effective heat energy transferred from atmosphere to surface water in both tropical regions...|$|R
25|$|The {{historian}} William H. Freehling noted <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>South's</b> {{argument for}} a state's right to secede {{was different from}} Thomas Jefferson's, in that Jefferson based such a right on the unalienable equal rights of man. <b>The</b> <b>South's</b> version of such a right was modified {{to be consistent with}} slavery, and with <b>the</b> <b>South's</b> blend of democracy and authoritarianism.|$|R

5|$|Although American {{officials}} {{at the highest levels}} of the intelligence community (e.g. CIA Director William Colby) were certain <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>South</b> Vietnamese government would collapse, everyone in the U.S. government underestimated the speed of the North Vietnamese advance during the 1975 Spring Offensive and how quickly South Vietnam's Army would collapse.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the closure}} of Dunston power station, along with the later {{closures}} of the power stations at Stella and Blyth, {{the northern part of}} North East England has become heavily dependent upon the National Grid for electrical supply. However, in the south of the region there are still two large power stations at Hartlepool and Teesside, meaning <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>south</b> of the region does not depend upon the National Grid for electrical supply as much as the north of the region.|$|E
5|$|However, {{a recent}} genetic studies {{carried out by}} HUGO (Human Genome Organization) {{involving}} almost 2000 people across Asia, points to another theory of Asian migration pattern.

5|$|As {{the coup}} collapsed, Kỳ and Đức {{appeared}} with other senior officers {{at a news}} conference where they proclaimed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>South</b> Vietnamese military was united. They announced a resolution by the armed forces, signed by them and seven others, claiming a united front against corruption. Apart from Kỳ and Đức, the other seven signatories were Thi, General Cao Văn Viên, an airborne brigade commander, the commander of I Corps General Tôn Thất Xứng, the commander of the Marine Brigade General Lê Nguyên Khang, General Nguyen Đức Thang of the General Staff, the commander of the Republic of Vietnam Navy Admiral Chung Tấn Cang, and the commander of the Rangers Colonel Pham Xuan Nhuan.|$|E
5|$|Between February 17 and February 19, 1975, North Vietnamese field {{commanders in}} the Central Highlands Front held a conference to plan for their {{upcoming}} offensive. In order to plan their combat strategy, North Vietnamese commanders assessed the potential obstacles faced by the Vietnam People’s Army {{and the strength of}} the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) in the Central Highlands. Following extensive discussions, North Vietnamese commanders concluded <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>South</b> Vietnamese army in the Central Highlands could mobilise about 5–7 regiment-sized units to counter the upcoming offensive. In the worst-case scenario, if South Vietnamese units were not tied up elsewhere, North Vietnamese commanders thought that South Vietnam could probably mobilise between nine and twelve regiments. North Vietnamese commanders believed South Vietnam could deploy about one or two armoured brigades, three to five battalions of artillery, and 80 aircraft per day to support the army. The North Vietnamese commanders within the Central Highlands Front discussed the possibility of the United States re-entering the conflict, which they believed would see the commitment of about 100 fighter-bombers from the United States Seventh Fleet.|$|E
5|$|By 25 September, {{the area}} {{occupied}} by the Lonsdale Force saw heavy fighting against self-propelled guns, flamethrower tanks, and infantry. There were no PIATs available to the force by now; instead Cain armed himself with a two-inch mortar. Mortars are muzzle-loading indirect fire weapons but Cain was forced to fire it on an almost horizontal plane due to the enemy's proximity. His citation states that his leadership ensured <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>South</b> Staffordshire gave no ground and drove the enemy off in complete disorder. By {{the end of the}} battle, Cain had been reportedly responsible for the destruction or disabling of six tanks, four of which were Tigers, {{as well as a number}} of self-propelled guns.|$|E

5|$|In early February Amundsen began organising the depot-laying {{journeys}} {{across the}} Barrier, {{in preparation for}} the following summer's assault on the pole. Supply depots laid in advance at regular intervals on the projected route would limit the amount of food and fuel <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>South</b> Pole party would have to carry. The depot journeys would be the first true tests of equipment, dogs and men. For the first journey, to begin on 10February, Amundsen chose Prestrud, Helmer Hanssen and Johansen to accompany him; 18dogs would pull three sledges. Before leaving, Amundsen left instructions with Nilsen regarding Fram. The ship was to sail to Buenos Aires for reprovisioning, before undertaking a programme of oceanographic work in the Southern Ocean and then returning to the Barrier as early as possible in 1912.|$|E
5|$|New Zealand, {{still part}} of the colony of New South Wales, became a {{separate}} Colony of New Zealand on 1 July 1841. The colony gained a representative government in 1852 and the first Parliament met in 1854. In 1856 the colony effectively became self-governing, gaining responsibility over all domestic matters other than native policy. (Control over native policy was granted in the mid-1860s.) Following concerns <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>South</b> Island might form a separate colony, premier Alfred Domett moved a resolution to transfer the capital from Auckland to a locality near the Cook Strait. Wellington was chosen for its central location, with Parliament officially sitting there {{for the first time}} in 1865. As immigrant numbers increased, conflicts over land led to the New Zealand Wars of the 1860s and 1870s, resulting in the loss and confiscation of much Māori land.|$|E
5|$|On March 11 Thieu {{convened a}} meeting with Prime Minister Trần Thiện Khiêm, Chief of the ARVN General Staff General Cao Văn Viên, and Lieutenant General Dang Van Quang to discuss the {{military}} situation in the northern provinces of South Vietnam. In this meeting, Thieu decided to withdraw {{what was left of}} his army from the northern provinces to defend the Mekong region, where most of the nation’s population and vital economic resources were located. Thieu justified his decision on the basis <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>South</b> Vietnamese military could not defend every inch of South Vietnam’s territory, so the military had to be ‘lightened at the top and heavy at the bottom’.|$|E

5|$|Primarily {{the brainchild}} of General Nguyen Chi Thanh, the {{upcoming}} offensive would be timed to provoke a popular general uprising among the South Vietnamese people against the government and its American supporters. Yet prudence required <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>South</b> Vietnamese maintain 50 per cent of their forces on standby, while American and allied forces under General William Westmoreland—the Free World Military Forces—remained on full alert. However, despite such measures the fighting at Khe Sanh had largely succeeded in diverting American resources and attention away from Saigon and towards the demilitarized zone, affording the communists the element of surprise.|$|E
5|$|The fight cost {{both sides}} dearly. The true extent of Viet Cong and North Vietnamese {{casualties}} is largely unknown, {{but due to}} their exposure to American firepower, the Communist forces undoubtedly suffered heavy losses. Nonetheless, the successful capture of Loc Ninh exceeded Communist expectations, as they had thought <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>South</b> Vietnamese would hold out longer. Lộc Ninh became {{the seat of the}} Provisional Revolutionary Government, the capital of Communist-occupied territories in South Vietnam. The South Vietnamese, in their efforts to hold the district, lost more than three thousand soldiers killed or captured; only about fifty soldiers actually reached An Lộc. The Viet Cong also captured all seven American advisers and an embedded French journalist, Yves-Michel Dumond, in Lộc Ninh; they were taken to a prison camp in Kratié Province, Cambodia. Dumond was released on 14 July 1972. On 12 February 1973, the Americans were released in accordance with the Paris Peace Accord.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea of a}} {{technology}} school in Georgia was introduced in 1865 during the Reconstruction period. Two former Confederate officers, Major John Fletcher Hanson (an industrialist) and Nathaniel Edwin Harris (a politician and eventually Governor of Georgia), who had become prominent citizens {{in the town of}} Macon, Georgia after the Civil War, strongly believed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>South</b> needed to improve its technology to compete with the industrial revolution that was occurring throughout the North. However, because the American South of that era was mainly populated by agricultural workers and few technical developments were occurring, {{a technology}} school was needed.|$|E
