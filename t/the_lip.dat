5|$|This {{species is}} {{characterized}} by its very small peridia (dimensions 1.5–3mm wide at the mouth x 2–4mm tall) with a color that may range from white to grey to pale buff, but never yellow – helping distinguish it from C. laeve. The peridia are , thin-walled (150–180µm at <b>the</b> <b>lip,</b> approximately 300µm thick {{at the edge of}} <b>the</b> <b>lip),</b> tomentose on the outer side and smooth on the inner side, and taper to a narrow base. The peridioles range in width between 0.5–1.25mm broad. Basidiospores have dimensions of 4–5 by 7–8µm.|$|E
5|$|Brachytherapy {{for skin}} cancer {{may result in}} a {{shedding}} of the outer layers of skin (desquamation) around the area of treatment in the weeks following therapy, which typically heals in 5–8 weeks. If the cancer is located on <b>the</b> <b>lip,</b> ulceration may occur as a result of brachytherapy, but usually resolves after 4–6 weeks.|$|E
5|$|Sebaceous glands {{are also}} found in hairless areas (glabrous skin) of the eyelids, nose, penis, labia minora, the inner mucosal {{membrane}} of the cheek, and nipples. Some sebaceous glands have unique names. Sebaceous glands on <b>the</b> <b>lip</b> and mucosa of the cheek, and on the genitalia, are known as Fordyce spots, and glands on the eyelids are known as meibomian glands. Sebaceous glands of the breast are also known as Montgomery's glands.|$|E

5|$|When an {{adequate}} band of attached tissue is absent, {{it can be}} recreated with a soft tissue graft. There are four methods {{that can be used}} to transplant soft tissue. A roll of tissue adjacent to an implant (referred to as a palatal roll) can be moved towards <b>the</b> <b>lip</b> (buccal), gingiva from the palate can be transplanted, deeper connective tissue from the palate can be transplanted or, when a larger piece of tissue is needed, a finger of tissue based on a blood vessel in the palate (called a vascularized interpositional periosteal-connective tissue (VIP-CT) flap) can be repositioned to the area.|$|E
5|$|CGI {{special effects}} {{for the series}} were {{provided}} by The Mill. The production team wanted a talking dragon, but {{they were worried about}} <b>the</b> <b>lip</b> sync and did not think it would be believable until they saw the first test. The Mill created a software that would read Hurt's facial muscles and incorporated it into the animation. Another concern was that the eyes would not convey the character, but this was corrected by the final version. Additional sound effects, such as the clanging chain, were added to give the creature weight. The knife Mary throws at Arthur was also completely CGI, though the shot of it hitting the chair was real.|$|E
5|$|The {{breeding}} season is from August to January, though dependent on local conditions. The nest site is {{usually in the}} drooping foliage of a tall shrub or low tree, such as Casuarina, Melaleuca, Acacia, and mallee eucalypts. The site is sometimes near to or overhanging water, and the nest is usually constructed {{at the end of}} a drooping branch, suspended from twigs or foliage. The striped honeyeater often nests in the vicinity of a nesting butcherbird. It builds a deep cup-shaped or bag-shaped nest, with thick walls and <b>the</b> <b>lip</b> of the opening turned slightly inwards. The nest is made from thin dry grass and coated with plant down, feathers or wool, the coating often completely obscuring the grass framework. It is lined with spider webs, hair, wool or rootlets, and on occasion flowers and tissue paper. The striped honeyeater will commonly re-use material from previous nests.|$|E
40|$|Excessively large lips {{represent}} an occasional but significant challenge in aesthetic surgery. Previously described techniques focus {{largely on the}} simple excision of a strip of tissue to reduce <b>the</b> <b>lips,</b> without specific attention to <b>the</b> resultant <b>lip</b> contour or to the volume relationship between <b>the</b> <b>lips.</b> <b>The</b> present paper describes a new technique for <b>lip</b> reduction, called <b>the</b> ‘bikini <b>lip</b> reduction’. This technique not only reduces the volume of <b>the</b> <b>lips,</b> but also restores an attractive labial contour, {{as well as an}} ideal volume relationship between the upper and lower lips. Because it is based on aesthetic analysis, this technique consistently yields both smaller and more aesthetically appealing <b>lips.</b> Simply stated, <b>the</b> bikini <b>lip</b> reduction consists of excision of a ‘bikini top’ (two cups and a middle strap) from <b>the</b> upper <b>lip</b> and a ‘bikini bottom’ (a triangle) from <b>the</b> lower <b>lip.</b> <b>The</b> aesthetic results and the patient satisfaction achieved through <b>the</b> bikini <b>lip</b> reduction technique have been very satisfactory...|$|R

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>lip</b> {{position}} and pressure, shaping of the vocal tract, choice of reed and mouthpiece, amount of air pressure created, and evenness of the airflow account {{for most of}} the clarinetist's ability to control the tone of a clarinet. A highly skilled clarinetist will provide the ideal lip and air pressure for each frequency (note) being produced. They will have an embouchure which places an even pressure across the reed by carefully controlling their lip muscles. The airflow will also be carefully controlled by using the strong stomach muscles (as opposed to the weaker and erratic chest muscles) and they will use the diaphragm to oppose the stomach muscles to achieve a tone softer than a forte rather than weakening the stomach muscle tension to lower air pressure. Their vocal tract will be shaped to resonate at frequencies associated with the tone being produced.|$|E
5|$|Ultimately, it was nature, not {{political}} maneuvering, {{that led to}} the filling of New Melones Lake. The winter and spring rainy season of 1982 was one of the wettest recorded in the 20th century. The Stanislaus River swelled to such high levels that it exceeded what could be safely released through the dam's outlets, and the reservoir rapidly surpassed the temporary limit. The winter of 1983 was even wetter and pushed water so high that it reached <b>the</b> <b>lip</b> of the emergency spillway (but did not flow over it), a level that has not been surpassed since. With the lake full, the state of California lifted the temporary limit in March, 1983. A deciding factor in the rescinding of the water-level limit was the prevention of $50 million in damages by New Melones Dam in 1982 and 1983, which demonstrated the dam's value for flood control.|$|E
25|$|A mild {{form of a}} {{cleft lip}} is a {{microform}} cleft. A microform cleft can appear {{as small as a}} little dent in the red part of <b>the</b> <b>lip</b> or look like a scar from <b>the</b> <b>lip</b> up to the nostril. In some cases muscle tissue in <b>the</b> <b>lip</b> underneath the scar is affected and might require reconstructive surgery. It is advised to have newborn infants with a microform cleft checked with a craniofacial team as soon as possible to determine the severity of the cleft.|$|E
2500|$|Cosmetic surgery {{providers}} often advise {{their patients}} that many options now exist {{for improving the}} appearance of <b>the</b> <b>lips.</b> [...] Most practitioners also admit that successful lip augmentation is highly dependent on the skill of the provider, with that skill stemming from many years of experience injecting <b>the</b> <b>lips</b> of many types of patients. Moreover, the surgeon must master the various injection techniques. With many injectables, the benefit to the patient is an immediate return to normal, usual activities. A few surgeons offer a procedure known as surgical flap augmentations in which small sections of skin near <b>the</b> <b>lips</b> or inside <b>the</b> mouth are excised and added to <b>the</b> <b>lips.</b> But <b>the</b> technique does not add volume and achieves only a slight outward protrusion of <b>the</b> <b>lips.</b>|$|R

50|$|Lip licking, biting, or rubbing {{habits are}} {{frequently}} involved. Paradoxically, constant licking of <b>the</b> <b>lips</b> causes drying and irritation, {{and eventually the}} mucosa splits or cracks. <b>The</b> <b>lips</b> have a greater tendency to dry out in cold, dry weather. Digestive enzymes present in saliva may also irritate <b>the</b> <b>lips,</b> and <b>the</b> evaporation {{of the water in}} saliva saps moisture from them.|$|R

50|$|The “gull-wing lift” is an {{effective}} surgical technique for increasing the prominence (display) of the vermilion coloring of <b>the</b> <b>lips,</b> by removing skin (and other tissues) as required, ether directly from or from above the white line of skin that borders onto, and sets off, the vermilion of <b>the</b> <b>lips</b> (<b>the</b> white roll). The incisions remove tissue and significantly alter the shape of <b>the</b> <b>lips</b> by moving up the vermilion from both peaks of the Cupid's bow outwards to the commissures, {{the corners of the}} mouth. Incisions are also made below <b>the</b> lower <b>lip</b> to increase <b>the</b> projection of the vermilion of <b>the</b> lower <b>lip.</b> This gull-wing lip lift usually requires an OR time of approximately 20 minutes; post-operatively, the swelling of <b>the</b> <b>lips</b> subsides at 1-2 weeks and the tightness subsides at 2-4 months. Asymmetry, under-correction, and hypertrophic scarring are possible complications.|$|R

25|$|Metals are {{typically}} isotropic, and an ordinary twist drill bit shears {{the edges of}} the hole cleanly. Wood drilled across the grain has long strands of wood fiber. These long strands tend {{to pull out of the}} wood hole, rather than being cleanly cut at the hole edge. <b>The</b> <b>lip</b> and spur drill bit has the outside corner of the cutting edges leading, so that it cuts the periphery of the hole before the inner parts of the cutting edges plane off the base of the hole. By cutting the periphery first, <b>the</b> <b>lip</b> maximizes the chance that the fibers can be cut cleanly, rather than having them pull messily out of the timber.|$|E

50|$|A lip lift is {{a plastic}} surgery {{procedure}} that modifies the cosmetic appearance of <b>the</b> <b>lips</b> by reshaping them {{to increase the}} prominence of the vermilion border; and to enhance the facial area above <b>the</b> <b>lips</b> into a more aesthetically pleasing shape.
