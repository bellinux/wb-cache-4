5|$|Burr {{was quickly}} called to Canada's Naval Services Headquarters <b>to</b> <b>discuss</b> <b>how</b> to apply {{diffused}} lighting camouflage. Simple {{tests in the}} laboratory served as proof of concept. In January 1941, sea trials began on the new corvette HMCS Cobalt. She was fitted with ordinary light projectors—neither designed for robustness, nor waterproofed—on temporary supports {{on one side of}} the hull; brightness was controlled manually. The trial was sufficiently promising for a better prototype to be developed.|$|E
5|$|Eliot invokes {{images of}} {{original}} sin and Adam's fall when talking about the past and points out that such events can be forgotten but can still affect mankind. Eliot brings {{in the image of}} Krishna <b>to</b> <b>discuss</b> <b>how</b> the past and future are related: Krishna, speaking to Arjuna, claims that death can come at any time and that men should always find the divine will instead of worrying about what their actions will bring. If an individual were to follow Krishna's words then {{they would be able to}} free their self from the limitations of time. Even if it cannot be fully attained, the effort in attempting it is still important. The way for mankind to understand the divine will is through prayer and through the power of the Holy Spirit.|$|E
5|$|Square {{released}} an enhanced port of Chrono Trigger developed by Tose in Japan for the Sony PlayStation in 1999. Square timed its release before that of Chrono Cross, the 1999 sequel to Chrono Trigger, to familiarize new players with story {{leading up to}} it. This version included anime cut scenes created by original character designer Akira Toriyama's Bird Studio and animated by Toei Animation, {{as well as several}} bonus features, accessible after achieving various endings in the game. Scenarist Masato Kato attended planning meetings at Bird Studio <b>to</b> <b>discuss</b> <b>how</b> the ending cut scenes would illustrate subtle ties to Chrono Cross. The port was later released in North America in 2001—along with a newly translated version of Final Fantasy IV—under the package title Final Fantasy Chronicles. Reviewers criticized Chronicles for its lengthy load times and an absence of new in-game features. This same iteration was also re-released as a downloadable game on the Playstation Network on October 4, 2011, for the PlayStation 3, PlayStation Vita, and PlayStation Portable.|$|E

5|$|The {{prospect}} of developing such large tourist accommodations has encountered concerns from both APSARA and the ICC, claiming that previous tourism {{developments in the}} area have neglected construction regulations and more of these projects {{have the potential to}} damage landscape features. Also, the large scale of these projects have begun to threaten the quality of the nearby town's water, sewage, and electricity systems. It has been noted that such high frequency of tourism and growing demand for quality accommodations in the area, such as the development of a large highway, has had a direct effect on the underground water table, subsequently straining the structural stability of the temples at Angkor Wat. Locals of Siem Reap have also voiced concern that the charm and atmosphere of their town have been compromised in order to entertain tourism. Since this local atmosphere is the key component to projects like Angkor Tourist City, the local officials continue <b>to</b> <b>discuss</b> <b>how</b> to successfully incorporate future tourism without sacrificing local values and culture.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, back at Parkside {{the other}} seven trains {{had come to a}} halt {{following}} the accident. The electrical telegraph had not yet been invented and no signalling system was in place advanced enough to communicate with Northumbrian, with Liverpool and Manchester, or with the party who had accompanied Huskisson to Eccles. The remaining passengers and railway staff congregated near the accident site <b>to</b> <b>discuss</b> <b>how</b> best to proceed. The L staff argued that since the railway was not at fault for the accident they should be allowed to continue to Manchester to prove the viability of the design. They also made the point that a large crowd would by now have gathered in Manchester, waiting to see the arrival of the trains and {{to get a glimpse of}} the Duke of Wellington. Joseph Sandars also suggested that, did the group not continue, the Manchester crowd would hear rumours of the accident and believe it to be more serious than it was. The Prime Minister and Sir Robert Peel, the Home Secretary, felt that it would be disrespectful to Huskisson to continue, and advocated that the group return to Liverpool to await news of Huskisson's condition.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{provides}} an overview of the current state-of-the-art on using constraints in knowledge discovery and data mining. The use of constraints in a data mining task requires specific definition and satisfaction tools during knowledge extraction. This survey proposes three groups of studies based on classification, clustering and pattern mining, whether the constraints are on the data, the models or the measures, respectively. We consider the distinctions between hard and soft constraint satisfaction, and between the knowledge extraction phases where constraints are considered. In addition <b>to</b> <b>discussing</b> <b>how</b> constraints can be used in data mining, we show how constraint-based languages can be used throughout the data mining process...|$|R
