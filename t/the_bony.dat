5|$|<b>The</b> <b>bony</b> {{labyrinth}} {{refers to}} <b>the</b> <b>bony</b> compartment which contains the membranous labyrinth, {{contained within the}} temporal bone. The inner ear structurally begins at the oval window, which receives vibrations from the incus of the middle ear. Vibrations are transmitted into the inner ear into a fluid called endolymph, which fills the membranous labyrinth. The endolymph is situated in two vestibules, the utricle and saccule, and eventually transmits to the cochlea, a spiral-shaped structure. The cochlea consists of three fluid-filled spaces: the vestibular duct, the cochlear duct, and the tympanic duct. Hair cells responsible for transduction—changing mechanical changes into electrical stimuli {{are present in the}} organ of Corti in the cochlea.|$|E

5|$|As {{with other}} toothed whales, {{the skull of}} the sperm whale is {{asymmetrical}} so as to aid echolocation. Sound waves that strike the whale from different directions will not be channeled in the same way. Within the basin of the cranium, the openings of <b>the</b> <b>bony</b> narial tubes (from which the nasal passages spring) are skewed towards {{the left side of}} the skull.|$|E
5|$|In the past, some palaeontologists, notably Robert Bakker, {{have speculated}} that the plates may have been mobile to some degree, {{although}} others disagree. Bakker suggested the plates were <b>the</b> <b>bony</b> cores of pointed horn-covered plates that a Stegosaurus could flip {{from one side to}} another to present a predator with an array of spikes and blades that would impede it from closing sufficiently to attack the Stegosaurus effectively. The plates would naturally sag to the sides of the Stegosaurus, the length of the plates reflecting the width of the animal at that point along its spine. His reasoning for these plates to be covered in horn is that the surface fossilized plates have a resemblance to <b>the</b> <b>bony</b> cores of horns in other animals known or thought to bear horns, and his reasoning for the plates to be defensive in nature is that the plates had insufficient width for them to stand erect easily in such a manner as to be useful in display without continuous muscular effort. S. stenops also had disk-shaped plates on its hips.|$|E
5|$|It is {{now clear}} that the common {{ancestor}} of <b>the</b> <b>bony</b> fishes (Osteichthyes) had a primitive air-breathing lung—later evolved into a swim bladder in most actinopterygians (ray-finned fishes). This suggests that crossopterygians evolved in warm shallow waters, using their simple lung when the oxygen level in the water became too low.|$|E

5|$|Pennatomys nivalis was a {{medium-sized}} species without many distinctive adaptations. The nasal bones were short and blunt-ended. The zygomatic plate, a bony plate {{at the side}} of the skull, was broad. <b>The</b> <b>bony</b> palate was long and flat. The root of the lower incisor was housed in a bony protuberance, the capsular process. The molars were low-crowned and possess accessory crests such as mesolophs. The upper molars all had three roots.|$|E
5|$|Slow lorises have {{relatively}} large maxillary canine teeth, their inner (mesial) maxillary incisors {{are larger than}} the outer (distal) maxillary incisors, {{and they have a}} diastema (gap) between the canine and the first premolar. The first mandibular premolar is elongated, and the last molar has three cusps on the crown, the shortest of which is near the back. <b>The</b> <b>bony</b> palate (roof of the mouth) only goes {{as far back as the}} second molar.|$|E
5|$|Some {{species of}} pterosaurs {{featured}} elaborate crests. The first and {{perhaps best known}} {{of these is the}} distinctive backward-pointing crest of some Pteranodon species, though a few pterosaurs, such as the tapejarids and Nyctosaurus, sported extremely large crests that often incorporated keratinous or other soft tissue extensions of <b>the</b> <b>bony</b> crest base.|$|E

5|$|The {{cause of}} IIH is not known. The Monro-Kellie rule {{states that the}} {{intracranial}} pressure {{is determined by the}} amount of brain tissue, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood inside <b>the</b> <b>bony</b> cranial vault. Three theories therefore exist as to why the pressure might be raised in IIH: an excess of CSF production, increased volume of blood or brain tissue, or obstruction of the veins that drain blood from the brain.|$|E
5|$|The incisive {{foramina}} (openings in {{the front}} part of the palate) are medium in length, and do not reach the first molars. Their back margin is angular, not rounded as in eastern voalavo. The diastema (the gap between the upper incisors and molars) is shorter than in eastern voalavo. <b>The</b> <b>bony</b> palate is broad and lacks notable ridges and other features, except {{for a pair of}} foramina (openings) near the place where the first and second molars (M1 and M2) meet. The back border of the palate is {{at the level of the}} middle of the third molars (M3). In <b>the</b> <b>bony</b> roof of the mesopterygoid fossa, the opening behind the palate, wide sphenopalatine vacuities (openings) are present. A thin alisphenoid strut (a piece of bone on the lower side of the skull separating two foramina) is present in specimens from Marojejy, but not in those from Anjanaharibe-Sud. The tegmen tympani, the roof of the tympanic cavity, is reduced.|$|E
5|$|After implantation, {{around the}} second to third week the {{developing}} embryo consists of three layers: endoderm, mesoderm and ectoderm. The {{first part of the}} ear to develop is the inner ear, which begins to form from the ectoderm around the 22nd day of the embryo’s development. Specifically, the inner ear derives from two thickenings called otic placodes {{on either side of the}} head. Each otic placode recedes below the ectoderm, forms an otic pit and then an otic vesicle. This entire mass will eventually become surrounded by mesenchyme to form <b>the</b> <b>bony</b> labyrinth.|$|E

5|$|As noted, {{there is}} bonebed {{evidence}} that this genus lived in groups during {{at least part of}} the year. Additionally, it had several potential methods for display in a social setting. <b>The</b> <b>bony</b> facial crest is an obvious candidate, and nasal diverticula may also have been present. These postulated diverticula would have taken the form of inflatable soft-tissue sacs housed in the deep excavations flanking the crest and elongate holes for the nostrils. Such sacs could be used for both visual and auditory signals.|$|E
5|$|C. longimanus feeds {{mainly on}} pelagic {{cephalopods}} and bony fish. However, its diet can {{be far more}} varied and less selectiveit is known to eat threadfins, stingrays, sea turtles, birds, gastropods, crustaceans, and mammalian carrion. <b>The</b> <b>bony</b> fish it feeds on include lancetfish, oarfish, barracuda, jacks, dolphinfish, marlin, tuna, and mackerel. Its feeding methods include biting into groups of fish and swimming through schools of tuna with an open mouth. When feeding with other species, it becomes aggressive. Peter Benchley, author of Jaws, observed this shark swimming among pilot whales and eating their faeces.|$|E
5|$|Cuvier's dwarf caiman is {{considered}} to be a keystone species whose presence in the ecosystem maintains a healthy balance of organisms. In its absence, fish, such as piranhas, might dominate the environment. The eggs and newly hatched young of Cuvier's dwarf caiman are most at risk and are preyed on by birds, snakes, rats, raccoons and other mammals. Adult caimans are protected by <b>the</b> <b>bony</b> osteoderms under the scales and their main predators are jaguars, green anacondas (Eunectes murinus) and large boa constrictors (Boa constrictor).|$|E

5|$|Species of Voalavo are small, gray, mouse-like rodents, {{among the}} {{smallest}} nesomyines. They lack the distinctive tuft of long {{hairs on the}} tail that is characteristic of Eliurus. The tail is long and females have six mammae. In Voalavo, there are two glands on the chest (absent in Eliurus) that produce a sweet-smelling musk in breeding males. In the skull, the facial skeleton is long and the braincase is smooth. The incisive foramina (openings in the front part of the palate) are long and <b>the</b> <b>bony</b> palate itself is smooth. The molars are somewhat hypsodont (high-crowned), though less so than in Eliurus, and the third molars are reduced in size and complexity.|$|E
5|$|The CSF {{occupies}} the subarachnoid space (between the arachnoid mater and the pia mater) and the ventricular system around {{and inside the}} brain and spinal cord.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>bony</b> fish lineage shows more derived {{anatomical}} traits, {{often with}} major evolutionary changes from {{the features of}} ancient fish. They have a bony skeleton, are generally laterally flattened, have five pairs of gills protected by an operculum, and a mouth {{at or near the}} tip of the snout. The dermis is covered with overlapping scales. Bony fish have a swim bladder which helps them maintain a constant depth in the water column, but not a cloaca. They mostly spawn a large number of small eggs with little yolk which they broadcast into the water column.|$|E

25|$|The Devonian Period {{is broken}} into the Early, Middle and Late Devonian.

Both <b>the</b> cartilaginous and <b>bony</b> fishes may have arisen from either the placoderms or the spiny sharks. A subclass of <b>bony</b> fishes, <b>the</b> ray-finned fishes (Actinopterygii), have become the dominant group in the post-Paleozoic and modern world, with some 30,000 living species.|$|R
40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the extent of}} posterosuperior bony overhang required to be removed for proper exposure of the incudo-stapedial complex during stapes surgery. Whether an assessment can be made out {{about the extent of}} <b>the</b> posterosuperior <b>bony</b> overhang clinically or not. A prospective study. One hundred patients of Stapedial Otosclerosis were included in this study. The direction of <b>the</b> posterosuperior <b>bony</b> canal wall i. e. straight or sloping type was recorded in every patient. All the patients underwent stapedotomy operation under local anaesthesia. The amount of overhang of <b>the</b> posterosuperior <b>bony</b> canal wall required to be removed for adequate exposure of the incudo-stapedial complex during stapes surgery was recorded by using measured right-angled picks of different sizes in mm. The aim {{of this study is to}} find out the extent of posterosuperior bony overhang and to know whether <b>the</b> posterosuperior <b>bony</b> overhang is more in straight or sloping bony canal wall. Fifty-seven percent of our patients had a medially sloping posterosuperior bony canal wall and 43 % had a straight canal wall, which was noted clinically before surgery. The extent of posterosuperior bony overhang was divided into 4 groups: Gr. A ≤ 2  mm, Gr. B 2 – 2. 5  mm, Gr. C 2. 5 – 3  mm, Gr. D ≥ 3  mm. There were 25 patients in Group A, 55 in Group B, 20 in Group C and none in Group D. So majority (i. e. 55 %) patients belonged to Group B i. e. 2 – 2. 5  mm. <b>The</b> posterosuperior <b>bony</b> overhang is more in those patients who had straight bony canal than those who had sloping bony canal.
