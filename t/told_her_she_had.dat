[...] She described the parallels between the lives of Jackson and her father Elvis, and said Jackson constantly asked her about the details of Elvis' death because he felt that he was [...] "going to end up the same way." [...] She had described such a conversation in a blog post the day after Jackson died, wherein she shared her feelings about his death. According to Presley, the last [...] "coherently good conversation" [...] she had with Jackson was in 2005. She said Jackson <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> been right about certain people around him, whom she called [...] "vampires."

She acknowledged his efforts in the relationship, saying, [...] "He honestly tried so hard and went through so much with me", but [...] "I didn’t appreciate it then and I wish I did."

2500|$|The {{problem of}} a weak case against Ethel Rosenberg was solved just 10 days {{before the start of}} the trial when David and Ruth Greenglass were reinterviewed. They were persuaded to change their {{original}} stories. David had said that he'd passed the atomic data he'd collected to Julius on a New York street corner. Now he stated that he'd given this information to Julius in the living room of the Rosenberg's New York apartment and that Ethel, at Julius's request, had taken his notes and [...] "typed them up." [...] In her re-interview Ruth expanded on her husband's version: [...] "Julius then took the info into the bathroom and read it and when he came out he called Ethel and <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> to type this info immediately... Ethel then sat down at the typewriter which she placed on a bridge table in the living room and proceeded to type the info which David had given to Julius." [...] As a result of this new testimony, all charges against Ruth were dropped.|$|E
2500|$|Madhubala's {{illness was}} known to Kishore, but like all the others, he did not realize its gravity; Ataullah Khan did not approve of his {{son-in-law}} at all, but he had lost the courage to disapprove. Ashok Kumar reminisced in a Filmfare interview: [...] "She suffered a lot and her illness made her very bad-tempered. She often fought with Kishore, and would take off to her father's house where she {{spent most of her}} time." [...] Madhubala's sister echoes this view albeit in a slightly different tone: [...] "After marriage they flew to London where the doctor <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> only two years to live. After that Kishore left her at our house saying: 'I can't look after her. I'm on outdoors often'. But she wanted to be with him. He’d visit her once in two months, though. Maybe he wanted to detach himself from her so that the final separation wouldn't hurt. But he never abused her as was reported. He bore her medical expenses. They remained married for nine years.|$|E
