5|$|<b>The</b> <b>lemon</b> drop {{was invented}} {{sometime}} in the 1970s by Norman Jay Hobday, the founder and proprietor of Henry Africa's, a fern bar in the Russian Hill neighborhood of San Francisco, California that opened in 1969. It was originally served in a cocktail glass. <b>The</b> <b>Lemon</b> Drop was most likely named after lemon drop candy. After its invention, the drink swiftly spread to many San Francisco saloons. In the early 1990s, it was often prepared as a shooter or served in a shot glass.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, {{preparation}} of <b>the</b> <b>lemon</b> drop was presented on The Oprah Winfrey Show, prepared by Oprah Winfrey and Rachael Ray. The drink's popularity increased during this time.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Lemon</b> {{test has}} been criticized by justices and legal scholars, but it remains the {{predominant}} {{means by which the}} Court enforces the Establishment Clause. In Agostini v. Felton (1997), the entanglement prong of <b>the</b> <b>Lemon</b> test was demoted to simply being a factor in determining the effect of the challenged statute or practice. In Zelman v. Simmons-Harris (2002), the opinion of the Court considered secular purpose and the absence of primary effect; a concurring opinion saw both cases as having treated entanglement as part of the primary purpose test. Further tests, such as the endorsement test and coercion test, have been developed to determine whether a government action violated the Establishment Clause.|$|E

40|$|It {{is shown}} that the {{presence}} of informed buyers is necessary but not always sufficient for producers to use prices as signals of product quality. A sufficiently high fraction of informed buyers eliminates <b>the</b> <b>lemons</b> problem. A small fraction of informed buyers mitigates <b>the</b> <b>lemons</b> problem, provided that buyers' prior belief of high quality is sufficiently pessimistic: price reveals high quality at a signaling cost which increases with market power. However, if buyers' prior belief of high quality is optimistic when the market is poorly informed, then <b>the</b> <b>lemons</b> problem is not overcome.

5|$|Based on {{similarities}} in morphology, tooth shape, and behavior, the closest {{relatives of the}} spinner shark were originally {{believed to be the}} blacktip shark and the graceful shark (C. amblyrhynchoides). However, this interpretation was not supported by Gavin Naylor's 1992 allozyme analysis, which suggested that these similarities are the product of convergent evolution and that the closest relative of the spinner shark is the copper shark (C. brachyurus). In a 2007 ribosomal DNA study, the spinner shark was found to be the most genetically divergent of all the requiem shark species examined save for the tiger shark (Galeocerdo cuvier), being less related to other Carcharhinus species than <b>the</b> <b>lemon</b> shark (Negaprion brevirostris).|$|E

5|$|Once {{placed in}} the family Triakidae, the whitetip reef shark is now {{recognized}} by most authors as belonging to the family Carcharhinidae {{on the basis of}} morphological characters, such as a full nictitating membrane, well-developed precaudal pit, strong lower caudal fin lobe, and scroll-like intestinal valves. Morphological and molecular phylogenetic analyses suggest the whitetip reef shark is grouped with <b>the</b> <b>lemon</b> sharks (Negaprion) and the sliteye shark (Loxodon) in occupying an intermediate position on the carcharhinid evolutionary tree, between most basal genera (Galeocerdo, Rhizoprionodon, and Scoliodon) and the most derived (Carcharhinus and Sphyrna).|$|E

5|$|Spotted eagle rays, {{in common}} with many other rays, often fall victim to sharks such as the tiger shark, <b>the</b> <b>lemon</b> shark, the bull shark, the silver tip shark, and the great hammerhead shark. A great hammerhead shark has been {{observed}} attacking a spotted eagle ray in open water by taking a large bite {{out of one of}} its pectoral fins, thus incapacitating the ray. The shark then used its head to pin the ray to the bottom and pivoted to take the ray in its jaws, head first. Sharks have also been observed to follow female rays during the birthing season, and feed on the newborn pups.|$|E
5|$|The Israeli Defense Minister Israel Navon (Doron Tavory) {{moves to}} {{a house on the}} border between Israel and the West Bank, with the {{building}} sitting on the Israeli side just next to the dividing line. The Israeli Secret Service views the neighboring lemon grove of Salma Zidane (Hiam Abbass), a Palestinian widow whose family has cared for the area for generations, {{as a threat to the}} minister and his wife. The security forces soon set up a guard post and a fence around the grove. They then obtain an order to uproot <b>the</b> <b>lemon</b> trees.|$|E
5|$|The plot of Lemon Tree {{was based}} on a real life incident. Israeli Defense Minister Shaul Mofaz moved to the border within Israel and the {{occupied}} territories and security forces began cutting down <b>the</b> <b>Lemon</b> trees beside his house, arguing that it could be used by terrorists as a hiding place. The Palestinian family who owned the trees sued the minister and took the case {{all the way to the}} Israeli Supreme Court. They lost, and their trees had to be cut down. Riklis watched a news blurb about the case online. He then developed the story further in a fictional setting. Riklis explicitly designed the protagonist's part for actress Hiam Abbass.|$|E

5|$|Two {{to three}} tablespoons of ReaLemon lemon juice has the {{equivalent}} of the juice from one average-sized lemon. Both ReaLemon and ReaLime are used as ingredients in various recipes, such as in baking, grilling, and as an ingredient in marinades and salad dressings. ReaLemon can be used as an ingredient in hot tea, lemonade and hot lemonade, and in various cooked dishes and baked goods such as pies. ReaLemon and other lemon juices can be used to prevent browning discoloration from occurring in peeled or sliced potatoes.

5|$|Salma feels {{isolated}} {{given that}} her son has moved to Washington, D.C. and her daughters are now married. The local village elder Abu Kamal (Makram Khoury) advises her to give in, but Salma decides {{to work with the}} young lawyer Ziad Daud (Ali Suliman). They take their case {{all the way to the}} Supreme Court. Mira Navon (Rona Lipaz-Michael), the minister's wife, sympathizes with Salma. The court case receives notable media attention, and Mira gives a news interview that her husband regrets. Mira believes that the Israeli military overreacted, and she also shares Salma's sense of personal loneliness. Although they never speak, a complex human bond develops between the two women. As the Palestinian cause is dismissed, Mira decides to leave her husband and a concrete wall is built between Salma's land and the Defense Minister's house. A final camera shot reveals <b>the</b> <b>lemon</b> trees have been pruned.|$|E

40|$|Three {{experiments}} {{examined the}} role of reputation for alleviating <b>the</b> <b>lemons</b> problem in an online market, and produced the following findings. First, information asymmetry drives the experimental market into a lemons market. Second, reputation about other traders moderately alleviates <b>the</b> <b>lemons</b> problem. Third, <b>the</b> power of reputation {{as a solution to}} <b>the</b> problem of <b>lemons</b> is substantially reduced when traders can freely change their identities and cancel their reputations. Fourth, the negative reputation system is particularly vulnerable to identity changes. It was argued that the lack of a closed market among online traders, which appears, at first grant, to be a formidable problem, can actually be a blessing. ...|$|R
5|$|The {{original}} {{notion of}} lemon juice being packaged inside lemon-shaped and coloured containers {{was the brainchild of}} Edward Hack in the 1950s. Bill Pugh, an English plastics designer, created a prototype based upon Hack's concept. The company Edward Hack, Ltd. then produced and marketed Hax brand lemon juice in the plastic containers, using juice from Sicily. Stanley Wagner of Coldcrops, Ltd. also independently designed a very similar package, which was used for Realemon brand lemon juice. Realemon was later renamed to ReaLem by Coldcrops. Hax lemon juice was the first to be packaged and marketed in said lemon-shaped container, with Coldcrops following shortly thereafter. A later agreement between Hax and Coldcrops led to Hax leaving <b>the</b> <b>lemon</b> juice business, whereby Coldcrops acquired the marketing rights for lemon juice in plastic lemon containers under the ReaLem brand. Coldcrops was acquired by Reckitt and Colman in 1956, which rebranded the product under the Jif brand name.|$|E

40|$|We study {{transactions}} in which sellers fear being underpaid because their outside option {{is better known}} to the buyer. We rationalize various observed contracts as solutions to such smart buyer problems. Key to these solutions is granting the seller upside participation. In contrast, <b>the</b> <b>lemons</b> problem calls for granting the buyer downside protection. But, in either case, the seller (buyer) receives a convex (concave) claim. Thus, contracts usually associated with <b>the</b> <b>lemons</b> problem, such as debt or cash-equity offers, can be equally well manifestations of the smart buyer problem, although the two information asymmetries have opposite cross-sectional implications...|$|R
