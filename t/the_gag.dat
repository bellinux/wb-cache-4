5|$|Raj appealed {{before the}} court against <b>the</b> <b>gag</b> order imposed on him, stating {{that he had to}} move around {{different}} places in Maharashtra for propounding the philosophy of his party and that such an order was an infringement of his 'fundamental rights'. On 22 February, the court dismissed his appeal to re-track the extension of <b>the</b> <b>gag</b> order passed against him, following which MNS started a signature campaign to get support against <b>the</b> <b>gag</b> order. According to MNS, Maharashtrian actors Nana Patekar and Shreyas Talpade had shown support in opposing <b>the</b> <b>gag</b> order, along with actors Salman Khan and Suneil Shetty. Salman Khan and Suneil Shetty, however, later denied the MNS's claim. This move by MNS prompted the police to serve a show cause notice to Raj, asking him why <b>the</b> <b>gag</b> order should not be extended.|$|E

5|$|Those {{with severe}} {{encephalopathy}} (stages 3 and 4) {{are at risk}} of obstructing their airway due to decreased protective reflexes such as <b>the</b> <b>gag</b> reflex. This can lead to respiratory arrest. Transferring the person to a higher level of nursing care, such as an intensive care unit, is required and intubation of the airway is often necessary to prevent life-threatening complications (e.g., aspiration or respiratory failure). Placement of a nasogastric tube permits the safe administration of nutrients and medication.|$|E
25|$|A knotted gag is a {{blend of}} the ball and cleave <b>gags.</b> <b>The</b> scarf either has a knot tied in the middle and placed in <b>the</b> <b>gagged</b> person's mouth or is an over-the-mouth gag (OTM) placed {{backward}} with the knot tied inside the person's mouth. <b>The</b> knotted <b>gag</b> is able to soak up the saliva that <b>the</b> ball <b>gag</b> does not and can be easily washed for reuse. Knots can be doubled or tripled to fit the size of <b>the</b> <b>gagged</b> person's mouth.|$|R

5|$|The entire Simpson {{family was}} {{designed}} {{so that they would}} be recognizable in silhouette. The family was crudely drawn, because Groening had submitted basic sketches to the animators, assuming they would clean them up; instead, they just traced over his drawings. To draw Marge, the animators generally start off with a sphere, similar to the way Lisa and Maggie are drawn. The eyes are then drawn, with one roughly {{in the middle of the}} sphere, and the other to the front side of the head. Then, the nose and lip are drawn. Her hair is then drawn on top as a long tube coming out of the sphere. An original idea the animators had for when Marge walked through doorways was that her hair would be forced down as she walked through, then once clear of the door, it would spring back and forth. This was never used. Groening's original plan for Marge's hair was that it would conceal large, Life in Hell-esque rabbit ears. <b>The</b> <b>gag</b> was intended to be revealed in the final episode of the series, but was scrapped early on due to inconsistencies, and also to the fact that rabbit ears would be too fictitious even for The Simpsons.|$|E
25|$|Despite not forcing {{anything}} {{into the}} mouth, mouth corsets are usually {{very effective in}} gagging the victim. This {{is due to the}} fact that the chin piece prevents the wearer from opening their mouth and dislodging <b>the</b> <b>gag,</b> and the lacing at the back of the corset holds <b>the</b> <b>gag</b> tightly against the mouth, making a very effective seal. In addition, it compresses the wearer's cheeks.|$|E

25|$|A forniphilic gag {{is a type}} of gag {{that has}} the primary purpose of {{objectifying}} and/or humiliating the wearer. The term forniphilic comes from the word forniphilia, which is the incorporation of a bound person into furniture or other objects. <b>The</b> <b>gag</b> becomes a mounting point for a tool or other device which allows a slave to perform a task or service for their master or mistress. When employing <b>the</b> <b>gag,</b> the slave's hands are usually bound behind them so they have no other option than to control the tool with <b>the</b> <b>gag.</b> In order to provide stability and to allow the slave to control the tool, a muzzle gag with a mouthpiece is commonly used as a base for attaching the tool.|$|E

25|$|The {{glossopharyngeal}} nerve (CN IX) sends fibers {{to the upper}} epiglottis {{that contribute to the}} afferent limb of <b>the</b> <b>gag</b> reflex. (<b>The</b> <b>gag</b> reflex is variable in people from a limited to a hypersensitive response.) The superior laryngeal branch of the vagus nerve (CN X) sends fibers to the lower epiglottis that contribute to the efferent limb of the cough reflex. This initiates an attempt to try to dislodge the food or liquid from the windpipe.|$|E

25|$|A {{butterfly}} gag is a wing-shaped gag that {{is usually}} inflatable {{by means of a}} rubber bulb. The central part fits behind the teeth to fill up the mouth, while the wings go between the teeth and the lips. <b>The</b> <b>gag</b> inflates {{in the shape of a}} butterfly. This kind of gag is very hard to keep in the wearer; the use of an O-ring in front of <b>the</b> <b>gag</b> strapped to the back of the head will hold the butterfly gag in place.|$|E
25|$|To keep <b>the</b> <b>gag</b> in the mouth, it {{is usually}} paired with a ring, muzzle or panel gag {{attached}} to a strap that buckles behind the head.|$|E
