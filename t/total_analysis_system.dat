After this first bio-MEMS study, subsequent development in the field was slow for around 20 years. In 1985, Unipath Inc. commercialized ClearBlue, a pregnancy test still used today that can be considered the first microfluidic device containing paper and the first microfluidic product to market. In 1990, Andreas Manz and H. Michael Widmer from Ciba-Geigy (now Novartis), Switzerland first coined the term micro <b>total</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>system</b> (μTAS) in their seminal paper proposing the use of miniaturized total chemical analysis systems for chemical sensing. There have been three major motivating factors behind the concept of μTAS. Firstly, drug discovery in the last decades {{leading up to the}} 1990s had been limited due to the time and cost of running many chromatographic analyses in parallel on macroscopic equipment. Secondly, the Human Genome Project (HGP), which started in October 1990, created demand for improvements in DNA sequencing capacity. Capillary electrophoresis thus became a focus for chemical and DNA separation. Thirdly, DARPA of the US Department of Defense supported a series of microfluidic research programs in the 1990s after realizing there was a need to develop field-deployable microsystems for the detection of chemical and biological agents that were potential military and terrorist threats. Researchers started to use photolithography equipment for microfabrication of microeletromechanical systems (MEMS) as inherited from the microelectronics industry. At the time, the application of MEMS to biology was limited because this technology was optimized for silicon or glass wafers and used solvent-based photoresists that were not compatible with biological material. In 1993, George M. Whitesides, a Harvard chemist, introduced inexpensive PDMS-based microfabrication and this revolutionized the bio-MEMS field. Since then, the field of bio-MEMS has exploded. Selected major technical achievements during bio-MEMS development of the 1990s include: ...|$|E

In the present study, a PDMS based micro <b>total</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>system</b> has been developed for rapid, multi-purpose, impedance based detection of biomolecules. The major components of the micro <b>total</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>system</b> include a micropump, micromixer, magnetic separator and interdigitated electrodes for impedance detection. Three designs of pneumatically actuated PDMS based micropumps were fabricated and tested. Based on the performance test results, one of the micropumps was selected for integration. The experimental results of the micropump performance were confirmed by a 2 D COMSOL simulation combined with an equivalent circuit analysis of the micropump. Three designs of pneumatically actuated PDMS based active micromixers were fabricated and tested. The micromixer testing involved determination of mixing efficiency based on the streptavidin-biotin conjugation reaction between biotin comjugated fluorescent microbeads and streptavidin conjugated paramagnetic microbeads, followed by fluorescence measurements. Based on the performance test results, one of the micromixers was selected for integration. The selected micropump and micromixer were integrated into a single microfluidic system. The testing of the magnetic separation scheme involved comparison of three permanent magnets and three electromagnets of different sizes and magnetic strengths, for capturing magnetic microbeads at various flow rates. Based on the test results, one of the permanent magnets was selected. The interdigitated electrodes were fabricated on a glass substrate with gold as the electrode material. The selected micropumps, micromixer and interdigitated electrodes were integrated to achieve a fully integrated microfluidic system. The fully integrated microfluidic system was first applied towards biotin conjugated fluorescent microbeads detection based on streptavidin-biotin conjugation reaction which is followed by impedance spectrum measurements. The lower detection limit for biotin conjugated fluorescent microbeads was experimentally determined to be 1. 9 x 106 microbeads. The fully integrated microfluidic system was then applied towards immuno microbead based insulin detection. The lower detection limit for insulin {{was determined to be}} 10 - 5 M.

50|$|Bio-MEMS is an {{abbreviation}} for biomedical (or biological) microelectromechanical systems. Bio-MEMS have considerable overlap, and is sometimes considered synonymous, with lab-on-a-chip (LOC) and micro <b>total</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>systems</b> (μTAS). Bio-MEMS is typically {{more focused on}} mechanical parts and microfabrication technologies made suitable for biological applications. On the other hand, lab-on-a-chip is concerned with miniaturization and integration of laboratory processes and experiments into single (often microfluidic) chips. In this definition, lab-on-a-chip devices do not strictly have biological applications, although most do or are amendable to be adapted for biological purposes. Similarly, micro <b>total</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>systems</b> may not have biological applications in mind, and are usually dedicated to chemical analysis. A broad definition for bio-MEMS {{can be used to}} refer to the science and technology of operating at the microscale for biological and biomedical applications, {{which may or may not}} include any electronic or mechanical functions. The interdisciplinary nature of bio-MEMS combines material sciences, clinical sciences, medicine, surgery, electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, optical engineering, chemical engineering, and biomedical engineering. Some of its major applications include genomics, proteomics, molecular diagnostics, point-of-care diagnostics, tissue engineering, single cell analysis and implantable microdevices.|$|R

Confocal studies of microfluidic devices that incorporate 3 D nanostructures formed using this approach show that they function as efficient passive mixing elements, particularly at low Reynolds numbers. This application and others such as separation and extraction in microfluidic <b>total</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>systems</b> or lab on a chip devices represent promising areas for 3 D nanostructures of this general type.

30|$|Microfluidics is {{the study}} of {{behavior}} manipulation and control of fluids confined to micrometer dimensions, typically 1 to 100  μm. Transport in the microchannels is the major phenomenon; it includes flow detections, liquid transport, control of molecular transport like DNA molecule conformation dynamics, measurement of bulk-level rheological properties, and separation techniques with biophysical and genomic applications because they generate defined fluid flows that manipulate large DNA molecules [3]. In addition, understanding the complex behavior of DNA molecules flowing in microchannels is essential to the realization of lap-on-a-chip (LOC) and micro <b>total</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>system</b> (μTAS) intended to systematically manipulate, process, and analyze these molecules.

Although several 3 D chaotic mixers have been designed, most of them offer a high mixing efficiency only in a very limited range of Reynolds numbers (Re).
