Possible TNT transformations include reduction of one, two, or three nitro-moieties to amines and coupling of amino transformation products to form dimers. Formation of the two monoamino transformation products, 2-ADNT and 4-ADNT are energetically favored, and therefore are observed in contaminated soils and ground water. The diamino products are energetically less favorable, and even less likely are the triamino products.|$|E

The process enables improved control of the combustion to minimise the formation of combustion related emissions such as oxides of nitrogen (NOx), Carbon Monoxide (CO) and <b>Total</b> <b>Organic</b> <b>Carbons</b> (TOC).

25|$|An {{integrated}} aquaculture system {{consists of}} a number of species at different trophic levels of the food chain. Thus waste generating (fed organisms) such as fish and shrimp are coupled with extractive organisms such as abalone, sponges or sea urchins, as a mechanism of removing excess nutrient matter from the water column. Sea sponges have a distinct advantage as an extractive organism in an integrated multi-trophic aquaculture system, as they have the potential of acting as a bioremediator to remove both pathogenic bacteria and organic matter. The sponge Hymeniacidon perlevis has exhibited an excellent ability to remove <b>total</b> <b>organic</b> <b>carbon</b> (TOC) from seawater under integrated aquaculture conditions, and could be a potentially useful bioremediation tool for aquaculture systems in regions where water pollution is high. Furthermore, the organic enrichment originating from fish farmed in the vicinity may stimulate sponge growth, resulting in more efficient sea sponge aquaculture.|$|E

The world class source rock contains high levels of <b>Total</b> <b>Organic</b> <b>Carbon,</b> comparable to the Kimmeridge Clay Formation of the basins of the North Sea. The ammonite-rich shales and biomicrites of La Luna were deposited during the global anoxic event of the Cenomanian-Turonian (around 90 Ma) characterised by a maximum flooding surface sequence. The highly organic formation is time-equivalent with the Querecual Formation of eastern Venezuela, the Chipaque and Gachetá Formations of the Colombian Eastern Ranges and Llanos Basin respectively and the Celendín Formation of northeastern Peru. The Late Cretaceous Molino Formation, laterally equivalent with the Colón and Mito Juan Formations of the Maracaibo and Catatumbo Basins, and the Umir Formation of the Middle Magdalena Valley, consists of calcareous shales intercalated by sandstones. The widespread correlation of this unit with the neighbouring formations indicates an open marine environment all across northwestern South America.|$|E

A 2015 study of foreshore sediments from the Thames estuary measured total mercury at 0.01 to 12.07mg/kg with mean of 2.10mg/kg and median of 0.85mg/kg (n=351). The highest mercury concentrations [...] were shown to occur {{in and around the}} city of London in association with fine grain muds and high <b>total</b> <b>organic</b> <b>carbon</b> content. The strong affinity of mercury for carbon rich sediments has also been observed in salt marsh sediments of the River Mersey mean of 2mg/kg up to 5mg/kg.

The method measures the rate of glucose consumption by Escherichia coli 926 (ATCC 8789) in M 9 medium.

2500|$|Concentrations of PAH in {{river and}} estuarine sediments vary {{according}} {{to a variety of}} factors including proximity to municipal and industrial discharge points, wind direction and distance from major urban roadways, as well as tidal regime which controls the diluting effect of generally cleaner marine sediments relative to freshwater discharge. Consequently, the concentrations of pollutants in estuaries tends to decrease at the river mouth. Understanding of sediment hosted PAH in estuaries is important for the protection of commercial fisheries (e.g. mussels) and general environmental habitat conservation because PAH can impact the health of suspension and sediment feeding organism. River-estuary surface sediments in the UK tend to have a lower PAH content than sediments buried 10 to 60cm from the surface reflecting lower present day industrial activity combined with improvement in environmental legislation of PAH. Typical PAH concentrations in UK estuaries range from about 19 to 16,163µg/kg (dry weight sediment) in the River Clyde and 626 to 3766µg/kg in the River Mersey. In general estuarine sediments with a higher natural <b>total</b> <b>organic</b> <b>carbon</b> content (TOC) tend to accumulate PAH due to high sorption capacity of organic matter.

The results obtained are as follows:― 1) Generally, the Omura Bay closed in land, abounds in sulfides, <b>total</b> nitrogens, <b>organic</b> <b>carbons</b> and reducing matters much more than the Sasebo Bay opened for the large seas. Under the pearl rafts, however, the quantities of these constituents have high values in both of the seas. 2) The values of ignition loss are higher in the Sasebo Bay than in the Omura Bay. Under the pearl rafts, however, these values are high, in both of the seas. 3) The ratios of <b>organic</b> <b>carbon</b> to <b>total</b> nitrogen are nearly ten, in the regions rich in organic matters, especially at the estuary of the Hiu, bottoms under the pearl rafts and the inlet of the strait. From the above results, we consider that these constituents are, mainly, derived from sewerages at the ordinary stations and from excretions of pearl oysters under the rafts. According to statistics, we recognize the following relations. 4) The sulfides have positive correlations with the <b>organic</b> <b>carbons</b> and the reducing matters but not with the ignition losses and the total nitrogens. 5) The ignition losses have positive correlations with the total nitrogens and the <b>organic</b> <b>carbons</b> but not with the reducing matters and ratios of <b>organic</b> <b>carbon</b> to <b>total</b> nitrogen. 6) The total nitrogens have positive correlation with the <b>organic</b> <b>carbons</b> and reducing matters...|$|R

40|$|Grazers {{can have}} a large impact on {{ecosystem}} processes and are known to change vegetation composition. However, knowledge of how the long-term presence of grazers affects soil carbon sequestration is limited. In this study, we estimated <b>total</b> accumulated <b>organic</b> <b>carbon</b> in soils of a back-barrier salt marsh and determined how this is affected by long-term grazing by both small and large grazers in relation to age of the ecosystem. In young marshes, where small grazers predominate, hare and geese have a limited effect on <b>total</b> accumulated <b>organic</b> <b>carbon.</b> In older, mature marshes, where large grazers predominate, cattle substantially enhanced carbon content in the marsh soil. We ascribe this to a shift in biomass distribution in the local vegetation towards the roots in combination with trampling effects on the soil chemistry. These large grazers thus act as ecosystem engineers: their known effect on soil compaction (based on a previous study) enhances anoxic conditions in the marsh soil, thereby reducing the oxygen available for <b>organic</b> <b>carbon</b> decomposition by the local microbial community. This study showed that the indirect effects of grazing can significantly enhance soil carbon storage through changing soil abiotic conditions. This process {{should be taken into}} account when estimating the role of ecosystems in reducing carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere. Ultimately, we propose a testable conceptual framework that includes 3 pathways by which grazers can alter carbon storage: (1) through above-ground biomass removal, (2) through alteration of biomass distribution towards the roots and/or (3) by changing soil abiotic conditions that affect decomposition...|$|R

Cores were obtained in June 2006, May 2007 and 2008, at 8 stations {{on the shelf}} break (120 to 180 m), and at 2 stations on the continental slope (520 m and 680 m). Sediment-water fluxes of dissolved oxygen (O 2), total alkalinity (TA), nitrate (NO 3 -), and dissolved silicate (DSi) were measured at a total of 20 stations. Sediment characteristics include: grain size, chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) and phaeopigment (Phaeo) content, particulate organic (POC) and inorganic (PIC) carbon content, and 234 Th and 210 Pb activities. Sediments were sandy (fine to coarse) with organic matter (OM) (1. 0 - 4. 0 %) and Chl-a (0. 01 - 0. 95 µg g- 1) contents comparable to previous publications in the same region, and a relatively high PIC fraction (0. 8 - 10. 2 %). Sediment-water O 2 fluxes (- 2. 4 to - 8. 4 mmol O 2 m- 2 d- 1) were low compared to other coastal environments and correlated well with OM and Chl-a content. 234 Th activity profiles indicated that Chl-a sediment content (apparently the main driver of <b>total</b> benthic <b>organic</b> <b>carbon</b> degradation) was mainly controlled by physical mixing processes related to local hydrodynamics. The correlation between sediment-water fluxes of O 2 and NO 3 - indicated a close coupling of nitrification/denitrification and <b>total</b> benthic <b>organic</b> <b>carbon</b> degradation. Dissolution of biogenic silica (0. 05 to 0. 95 mmol m- 2 d- 1) was uncoupled from <b>organic</b> <b>carbon</b> degradation, characterized by sediment-water O 2 fluxes.
