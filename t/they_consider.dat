5|$|Vaishnava {{followers}} including Dvaita scholars, such as Vijayendra Tirtha (1514–93) {{refute the}} portrayal of Narasimha as being destroyed by Sharabha as <b>they</b> <b>consider</b> the Shaivite Puranas as tamasic - and thus not authoritative - based on their reading of Sattvic Puranas and Shruti texts. The refutation of the Sharabha legend along with ten other Shaivite legends is discussed in a text by Vijayindra Tirtha called Shaivasarvasvakhandanam.|$|E

40|$|The author {{attempts}} to define professional library tasks by surveying small Bible college librarians {{to discover the}} tasks on which they spent the most time performing directly and which tasks <b>they</b> <b>considered</b> “professional. ” Respondents generally {{spent most of their}} time directly performing many tasks that <b>they</b> <b>considered</b> professional in nature. They apparently were unaware that they directly performed many tasks that <b>they</b> did not <b>consider</b> professional and did not directly perform many tasks that <b>they</b> <b>considered</b> professional. The author concludes that most professional tasks of small Bible college librarians tend to be indirect and long-range and that most of their time and energy should be spent on these tasks...|$|R

5|$|Birth control, {{also known}} as {{contraception}} and fertility control, is a method or device used to prevent pregnancy. Birth control has been used since ancient times, but effective and safe methods of birth control only became available in the 20th century. Planning, making available, and using birth control is called family planning. Some cultures limit or discourage access to birth control because <b>they</b> <b>consider</b> it to be morally, religiously, or politically undesirable.|$|E
5|$|By {{contrast}} Yoshiaki Itakura {{adopted an}} even stricter standard than Hata, advocating that only Chinese soldiers captured in uniform and then killed be included as massacre victims. He argued that Chinese {{soldiers who had}} thrown away their uniforms were legally executed because {{the laws of war}} at the time did not apply to them, though this line of reasoning is hotly disputed by other historians. Most Japanese ultranationalists who deny the Nanking Massacre admit that the Japanese Army killed a large number of Chinese POWs, though <b>they</b> <b>consider</b> these to be legal executions, an argument denounced by mainstream historians.|$|E

Meanwhile, Lincoln and Charlie become somewhat distrustful of Walternate after learning what he hid from them. <b>They</b> <b>consider</b> that Colonel Broyles (Lance Reddick) disappeared {{around the same time}} that Fauxlivia returned, and wonder what else Walternate is hiding from them.|$|E

As the series progresses, Lex's friendship with Clark crumbles until <b>they</b> <b>consider</b> themselves enemies. The role was difficult to cast; Michael Rosenbaum auditioned twice and, feeling {{that he did not}} take his first audition seriously enough, outlined a two-and-a-half-page scene indicating where to be funny, charismatic or menacing. His second audition went so well that he was hired. Rosenbaum left the show after seven seasons, reprising his role for the series finale.|$|E
5|$|Most Jews, {{religious}} and secular, consider {{the wall to}} be important to the Jewish people since it was originally built to hold the Second Temple. <b>They</b> <b>consider</b> the capture of the wall by Israel in 1967 as a historic event since it restored Jewish access to the site after a 19-year gap. There are, however, some haredi Jews who hold different views. Most notable are the adherents of the Satmar hasidic dynasty who retain the views espoused by their Grand Rabbi Joel Teitelbaum, who would not approach the Wall after the 1967 conquest because of his opposition to Zionism, although he did visit the site during his visits to the Holy Land in the 1920s.|$|E
5|$|The Swedish Academy {{chose the}} poet Sully Prudhomme {{for the first}} Nobel Prize in Literature. A group {{including}} 42 Swedish writers, artists, and literary critics protested against this decision, having expected Leo Tolstoy to be awarded. Some, including Burton Feldman, have criticised this prize because <b>they</b> <b>consider</b> Prudhomme a mediocre poet. Feldman's explanation {{is that most of}} the Academy members preferred Victorian literature and thus selected a Victorian poet. The first Physiology or Medicine Prize went to the German physiologist and microbiologist Emil von Behring. During the 1890s, von Behring developed an antitoxin to treat diphtheria, which until then was causing thousands of deaths each year.|$|E

Prior to 2010, aircraft engine manufacturers had not defined specific particle levels above which <b>they</b> <b>considered</b> engines at risk. Airspace regulators took the general approach that if ash concentration rose above zero, <b>they</b> <b>considered</b> airspace unsafe, and consequently closed it.|$|R
5|$|The birds aggressively {{defend their}} nests and {{surrounding}} areas against other birds and animals. When a predator is persistent, mockingbirds from neighboring territories may be summoned by distinct calls {{to join the}} defense. Other birds may gather to watch as the mockingbirds harass the intruder. In addition to harassing domestic cats and dogs that <b>they</b> <b>consider</b> a threat, mockingbirds will at times target humans. The birds are unafraid and will attack much larger birds, even hawks. One incident in Tulsa, Oklahoma involving a postal carrier resulted {{in the distribution of}} a warning letter to residents.|$|E
5|$|The {{denominations}} in the Latter Day Saint {{movement are}} sometimes collectively {{referred to as}} Mormonism.

They also appointed Đurišić as a Chetnik vojvoda. Some historians have challenged the authenticity of these instructions; they say the document was a forgery made by Đurišić after he failed to reach Mihailović. Other historians either do not mention any controversy about the provenance of the instructions, mention evidence supporting their authenticity, or explicitly state <b>they</b> <b>consider</b> them to be authentic.|$|E

In Western cultures the number 13 is often considered unlucky, hence the term triskaidekaphobia, {{fear of the}} number 13.|$|E
5|$|Vithoba's image {{replaces the}} {{traditional}} representation of Buddha, when depicted as the ninth avatar of Vishnu, in some temple sculptures and Hindu astrological almanacs in Maharashtra. In the 17th century, Maratha artists sculpted {{an image of}} Pandharpur's Vithoba in the Buddha's place on a panel showing Vishnu's avatars. This {{can be found in}} the Shivneri Caves. Stevenson goes so far as to call devotees of Vithoba (Vithal-bhaktas) Buddhist Vaishnavas (Bauddho-Vaishnavas), since <b>they</b> <b>consider</b> Vithoba to be the ninth—namely Buddha—avatar of Vishnu. Some of the poet-saints praised Vithoba as a form of Buddha. B. R. Ambedkar, an Indian political leader and Buddhist convert, suggested that the image of Vithoba at Pandharpur was in reality the image of the Buddha.|$|E
5|$|Anxiety {{disorders}} and depression {{are the most}} common mental health issues for women. Depression is reported among lesbians at a rate similar to heterosexual women, although generalized anxiety disorder is more likely to appear among lesbian and bisexual women than heterosexual women. Depression is a more significant problem among women who feel they must hide their sexual orientation from friends and family, or experience compounded ethnic or religious discrimination, or endure relationship difficulties with no support system. Men's shaping of women's sexuality has proven to have an effect on how lesbians see their own bodies. Studies have shown that heterosexual men and lesbians have different standards for what <b>they</b> <b>consider</b> attractive in women. Lesbians who view themselves with male standards of female beauty may experience lower self-esteem, eating disorders, and higher incidence of depression. More than half the respondents to a 1994 survey of health issues in lesbians reported they had suicidal thoughts, and 18% had attempted suicide.|$|E

5|$|In the lowcountry {{region of}} coastal Georgia and South Carolina, the Carolina Marsh Tacky {{was the most}} common horse for most of the breed's history. As the {{automobile}} became more common during the 20th century, breed numbers declined, and the Marsh Tacky was thought to have gone extinct during the 1980s and 1990s. Today there are 276 living animals recognized by the breed registry, including 153 mares and 123 stallions and geldings. The Equus Survival Trust considers the breed to be at critical/nearly extinct levels, meaning that there are fewer than 100 breeding mares in existence. The American Livestock Breeds Conservancy considers the Marsh Tacky (which <b>they</b> <b>consider</b> a strain of the Colonial Spanish horse) to be at critical levels, meaning that there are fewer than 200 annual registrations in the United States and an estimated global population of less than 2,000. Representatives of the ALBC state that the breed numbers will have to increase to an estimated 1,000 members to ensure permanent survival. On June 11, 2010, a bill was signed into law that made the Carolina Marsh Tacky the state heritage horse of South Carolina.|$|E
