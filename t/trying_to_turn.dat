5|$|The patent {{illustrates}} a non-powered flying machine—namely, the 1902 glider. The patent's importance {{lies in its}} claim {{of a new and}} useful method of controlling a flying machine, powered or not. The technique of wing-warping is described, but the patent explicitly states that other methods instead of wing-warping could be used for adjusting the outer portions of a machine's wings to different angles on the right and left sides to achieve lateral (roll) control. The concept of varying the angle presented to the air near the wingtips, by any suitable method, is central to the patent. The patent also describes the steerable rear vertical rudder and its innovative use in combination with wing-warping, enabling the airplane to make a coordinated turn, a technique that prevents hazardous adverse yaw, the problem Wilbur had when <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> the 1901 glider. Finally, the patent describes the forward elevator, used for ascending and descending.|$|E
5|$|Smash Williams, who {{injured his}} knee during the {{previous}} year's playoffs, rediscovers his love for the game. Billy, Tim, Herc, and Jason decide to flip Buddy Garrity's house for a profit. Matt and Julie reconcile and rekindle their romance. Smash gets a tryout with Texas A, and succeeds in winning a spot on their team. Lyla helps Tim pursue a college football scholarship.

Buddy loses money, which is Lyla's college fund, in a bad business deal and he retaliates by trashing the strip club, The Landing Strip. Lyla wants to attend Vanderbilt University and after Buddy loses the money, she considers going to San Antonio State University, the school that gives Tim a scholarship.

25|$|Captain General Ricardos and his Spanish army {{defeated}} the French in a skirmish at Céret on 20 April 1793. The Spanish beat Louis-Charles de Flers and the Army of the Eastern Pyrenees at the Battle of Mas Deu on 19 May. After this success, Ricardos {{turned back and}} invested the Fort de Bellegarde. The Siege of Bellegarde lasted from 23 May until 24 June when the French garrison's 1,450 survivors capitulated. During the siege, the Spanish army captured the Fort de Bains on 3 June and the Fort de la Garde on 5 June. These were outworks of Bellegarde. While the Spanish reduced Bellegarde, de Flers was busy <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> his raw recruits into soldiers. He was able to secure the services of trained coastal gunners to man his artillery. He {{had a number of}} field fortifications built to defend the area.|$|E
25|$|For {{much of the}} 20th century, {{the concept}} of popular medicine, or folk medicine, has been {{familiar}} to both doctors and anthropologists. Doctors, anthropologists and medical anthropologists used these terms to describe the resources, other than the help of health professionals, which European or Latin American peasants used to resolve any health problems. The term was also {{used to describe the}} health practices of aborigines {{in different parts of the}} world, with particular emphasis on their ethnobotanical knowledge. This knowledge is fundamental for isolating alkaloids and active pharmacological principles. Furthermore, studying the rituals surrounding popular therapies served to challenge Western psychopathological categories, as well as the relationship in the West between science and religion. Doctors were not <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> popular medicine into an anthropological concept, rather they wanted to construct a scientifically based medical concept which they could use to establish the cultural limits of biomedicine. Examples of this practice can be found in medical archives and oral history projects.|$|E
25|$|Another {{example is}} the high profile murders that shook Los Angeles in the late sixties. The murders were {{committed}} by members of Charles Manson's cult and {{came to be known}} as Helter Skelter. During the course of the investigation into the cult, SSU special agents were requested by Los Angeles Police to interview Bruce Davis, a Manson follower who had been convicted of the 1969 Gary Hinman murder in Los Angeles. Davis was Manson devotee whom police were <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> as an informant into many of the open murders linked to the Manson Family. On January 26, 2001, San Francisco resident Diane Whipple was attacked and killed by two large Presa Canario dogs in the hallway of her apartment building. The dogs, named Bane and Hera, were owned by Whipple's neighbors, Marjorie Knoller and Robert Noel. The dogs' actual owner, Paul Schneider, was a high-ranking member of the Aryan Brotherhood prison gang who was serving a life sentence in Pelican Bay State Prison. The Special Service Unit had been investigating the Aryan Brotherhood and its illegal dog breeding business for several months prior to the death of Whipple. SSU was able to assist local law enforcement during the investigation and prosecution of Knoller and Noel.|$|E

However, Lucy reveals to her father that they are squatting in one of his properties and he evicts them.|$|E
25|$|Maathai {{continued}} {{to teach at}} Nairobi, becoming a senior lecturer in anatomy in 1975, chair of the Department of Veterinary Anatomy in 1976 and associate professor in 1977. She {{was the first woman}} in Nairobi appointed to any of these positions. During this time, she campaigned for equal benefits for the women working {{on the staff of the}} university, going so far as <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> the academic staff association of the university into a union, in order to negotiate for benefits. The courts denied this bid, but many of her demands for equal benefits were later met. In addition to her work at the University of Nairobi, Maathai became involved in a number of civic organizations in the early 1970s. She was a member of the Nairobi branch of the Kenya Red Cross Society, becoming its director in 1973. She was a member of the Kenya Association of University Women. Following the establishment of the Environment Liaison Centre in 1974, Maathai was asked to be a member of the local board, eventually becoming board chair. The Environment Liaison Centre worked to promote the participation of non-governmental organizations in the work of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), whose headquarters was established in Nairobi following the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment held in Stockholm in 1972. Maathai also joined the National Council of Women of Kenya (NCWK). Through her work at these various volunteer associations, it became evident to Maathai that the root of most of Kenya's problems was environmental degradation.|$|E

500|$|Reaction to {{the near}} affair storyline from {{listeners}} was generally negative and Chris Hastings from The Daily Telegraph {{reported that the}} BBC had been inundated with complaints, saying the storyline was [...] "utterly ridiculous", while others questioned its plausibility. Listeners started an online protest against the storyline following Whitburn's appearance on Feedback. The show's presenter Roger Bolton commented on the backlash saying fans thought the plot was [...] "unbelievable and over-sensational."

Antara attempted to reinvent its image into that of an independent news agency amid the wave of political reforms, but there were allegations of continued bias toward the policies of Suharto's successor B.J. Habibie. President Abdurrahman Wahid later sacked the agency's managing director, Parni Hadi, and accused him of [...] "dominating the news agency and <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> Antara into his private company".

500|$|Early on September 16, Washington {{received}} reports, {{which proved}} to be unfounded, that the British were advancing.

[...] At daybreak, Knowlton's troops were spotted by the pickets of the British light infantry. The British sent two or three companies to attack the enemy to their front. For more than half an hour the skirmish continued, with fighting in the woods between two farms.

500|$|Because of the stabbings, Leeds United banned Galatasaray {{fans from}} {{attending}} the second leg at Elland Road, {{claiming that the}} safety of fans inside the stadium could not be guaranteed and asked for Galatasaray fans not to travel to England. Galatasaray in response asked for the match to be played at a neutral venue or for Leeds fans to be banned from the match as well. In the end, Galatasaray fans were banned from the match. UEFA supported the ban and only 80 tickets were issued to Galatasaray for officials {{and representatives of the}} Turkish government. This led to an angry reaction from Galatasaray's vice-president who called the decision [...] "Disgusting" [...] and by the Turkish State Minister who said that Leeds were <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> the murders into an advantage.

500|$|The game's {{aesthetics}} {{were generally}} well received. Bramwell called the graphics [...] "unchanged and increasingly antiquated" [...] and criticized {{the presence of}} [...] "sharp, angular character models, eerily unrealistic lighting and odd little moments when the player is <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> round and ends up banging into a curb". Knutson, meanwhile, was positive regarding the graphics, art, and animation: he called them [...] "nearly flawless" [...] and praised the realism they brought to the inherently fantastical skateboarding genre. Williams said that [...] "THUGs cityscapes are incredibly well designed" [...] and singled out the GameCube version of Underground as exceptionally well rendered. Rybicki called the levels [...] "big and beautiful". Knutson commended the soundtrack's large size and the sound effects' realism.
