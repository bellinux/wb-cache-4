So we can’t just let these VMEXITs events go as they might be dangerous operations. The only way to do this is by modifying Xen code and adding logs to functions which might cause VMEXITs so as to capture related information. Actually, this is exactly what Xentrace does. As it violates our design principle of no modification to hypervisors, we are not going to take this method.|$|E
40|$|For {{several years}} the U. S. economy is enjoying an {{unprecedented}} growth. Many {{believe that the}} current economic growth {{is partly due to}} the demand and growth of information technology. Small businesses, especially the IT based small businesses, one where {{the name of the game}} is continuous innovation, are heavily dependent on their high-tech work force. Although necessary for small business growth, this phenomenon is creating new environmental threats. Due to the increasing international orientation of the IT workforce, these businesses are having to deal more with international human resources issues than ever before.

40|$|Before we {{can talk}} about the {{features}} of the business cycle, we have to define what it is. The first <b>thing</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> do is to remove the trend. There are several distinct ways of doing that. The first is to take logs and look at differences, in other words to look at growth rates. This leads to very short cycles. Another is to take logs and remove a linear trend, in other words to look at percentage deviations from a geometric trend. This leads to very long cycles. A third, more flexible option is the Hodrick and Prescott (1980) filter. For simplicity, let’s stick with the percentage deviation from a geometric trend (or just the deviation of the log from a linear trend). Then the following facts stand out: 1. Consumption and investment and hours are positively correlated with output. 2. Consumption is less volatile than output 3. Investment is much more volatile than output 4. Hours worked are about as volatile as output 5. Output per hour worked is positively correlated with output itself. 6. Hours worked are uncorrelated with output per hour worked.

40|$|This {{is a set}} of notes, {{summarizing}} what {{we talked}} about in the 10 th recitation. They are not meant to be rigorous, and are written informally, following what was discussed in class. Structure Learning of Bayesian Networks Up until now we focused on learning how to estimate the conditional probabilities tables (CPTs) of Bayesian networks, given that the structure is fixed. Sometimes the structure can be created (especially for small number of variables) manually, by encoding some prior knowledge about the variables in the form of independence assumptions. However, in the general case, {{we would like to have}} a way to learn the structure as well, and not just the CPTs. This is especially important in very big graphical models, where it is very hard to do it manually. The first <b>thing</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> define is a criterion for how well a structure for a Bayesian network fits the data. A natural criterion is the log likelihood. So, let θ encode the CPTs for a given structure G, and let X 1 to Xn be the variables in the graphical model. D will be training instances of the form {(x 1,j, [...] ., xn,j) } for j between 1 to N.

As the first <b>thing</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> do is to introduce what the Birthday Paradox is and how its theoritical analysis works. Then we give the details of Shank’s Baby-Step Giant-Step (BSGS) method, since it is the most famous and basic DLP solving methods in the whole Cryptography. The Gaudry-Schost algorithm is developed from these methods. To introduce the 2 -Dimensional case of the Gaudry-Schost Algorithm on Equivalence Classes. We explain the linear case – which is the Gaudry-Schost algorithm for the short interval 0 ≤ n ≤ N pre-cisely in section 4. 1. 1. Hence, we apply the Gaudry-Schost Algo-rithm on two types of Equivalence Classes – (1) Rotation from 180 o and (2) GLV Method. From our rough calculation, the expected running time on rotation from 180 o is 1. 4503 N and the expected running time on GLV Method is 1. 0255 N. Eventually, we sum-mary the general optimal formula for the expectation of selection in 2 -Dimensional Gaudry-Schost Algorithm on the Equivalence Classes of rotations as our final conclusion...|$|E
40|$|Peats {{are formed}} by {{disintegration}} {{of plant and}} organic matters. In Malaysia, the area covered by peat deposit is about 3 million hectares or 8 % of the total area of Malaysia. Peat has high compressive deformation, very high void ratio and water content and has low shear strength. It {{is widely regarded as}} a problematic soil since it poses serious problems in construction due to its long-term consolidation settlements even when subjected to a moderate load. Construction over peat will be subjected to massive primary and long term secondary and even tertiary settlement. This study will be conducted {{to gain a better understanding}} about the long term consolidation on tropical peat soil of East Coast of Peninsula Malaysia. The study will focused on the analysis of consolidation behavior of peat soil based on the time-deformation curve obtained from Oedometer Test. Based on this test, we can determine the consolidation time so that we can predict how long the time taken by the soil to settle. In the determination of consolidation time, the first <b>thing</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> know is the consolidation coefficient value and this value may be obtained from Oedometer Test. It was expected that the value of settlement is high since peat is very soft and easily compressed.

Soil conditions are dry across the state. If they continue, it can be advantageous during harvest by reducing potential soil compaction. So, if the rationale for tillage is to reduce soil compaction, it is not valid. Therefore, pay attention to tillage intensity after harvest; tillage affects soil conditions and destroys soil structure, which can create significant problems. Tillage accelerates organic matter loss, which results in more problems of accelerating soil erosion and surface runoff. Those changes in soil condition with tillage during rain events after harvest can also reduce soil profile recharge due to increased surface run off...|$|R
