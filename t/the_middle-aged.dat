5|$|Cucumber {{focuses on}} the life of <b>the</b> <b>middle-aged</b> Henry Best (Vincent Franklin) and the fallout from a {{disastrous}} date with his boyfriend of nine years, and is accompanied with Banana, an E4 anthology series featuring younger characters across the LGBT spectrum {{on the periphery of the}} Cucumber narrative, and Tofu, an online documentary series available on 4oD discussing modern sex, sexuality and issues arisen during the show with the cast and public. The three names reference a urological scale categorising the male erection by hardness from tofu to cucumber, and are used to symbolise differences in sexual attitudes and behaviour between the two generations. Although Cucumber was designed as a self-contained serial focusing {{on the life of}} one man, Davies envisioned Banana as open-ended with the potential to continue after its sister series finished.|$|E
5|$|In many {{countries}} {{the rate of}} suicide is highest in <b>the</b> <b>middle-aged</b> or elderly. The absolute number of suicides however is greatest in those between 15 and 29 years old due {{to the number of}} people in this age group. In the United States it is greatest in Caucasian men older than 80 years, even though younger people more frequently attempt suicide. It is the second most common cause of death in adolescents and in young males is second only to accidental death. In young males in the developed world it is the cause of nearly 30% of mortality. In the developing world rates are similar, but it makes up a smaller proportion of overall deaths due to higher rates of death from other types of trauma. In South-East Asia in contrast to other areas of the world, deaths from suicide occur at a greater rate in young females than elderly females.|$|E
25|$|In <b>the</b> <b>middle-aged</b> woman, breast ptosis {{usually is}} caused by the {{postpartum}} hormonal changes to the maternal body, which depleted the quantity of adipose fat tissue and atrophied the milk glands, and because of the inelasticity of the skin envelope, which was overstretched by the engorgement of lactation.|$|E

Only recently has Anguissola been recognized as the painting's creator.|$|E
25|$|Around early 2011, Mbnomics {{gained a}} {{negative}} reputation due to tax reduction {{plans for the}} rich, the failure to privatize or merge national banks, and failure to provide affordable housing. <b>The</b> <b>middle-aged</b> and senior Korean population usually supported Lee Myung-bak. However, businesspeople in their 50s-60s in the construction and real estate sectors withdrew their support of Lee after the 2010 regional election and 2012 presidential election.|$|E

25|$|The {{mortality}} rate due to chronic ITP varies but {{tends to be}} higher relative {{to the general population}} for any age range. In a study conducted in Great Britain, it was noted that ITP causes an approximately 60 percent higher rate of mortality compared to gender- and age-matched subjects without ITP. This increased risk of death with ITP is largely concentrated in <b>the</b> <b>middle-aged</b> and elderly. Ninety-six percent of reported ITP-related deaths were individuals 45 years or older. No significant difference was noted in the rate of survival between males and females.|$|E
25|$|In April, Parker {{made his}} first mistake with Presley's career. He had booked him into a four-week Las Vegas engagement, misjudging the {{reaction}} of the slightly older, more reserved audiences that Las Vegas attracted. While Presley was a hit among the youth of America, <b>the</b> <b>middle-aged</b> audiences found him to be something of an oddity. Some viewed him as a clown-like figure, wiggling his hips for screams like a monkey for peanuts, while others found his manner of performance vulgar and more suitable for late-night gentleman's clubs. After a very cool reception during his first few shows, Parker cut Presley's appearance to two weeks. Presley would later remember the event as one of the worst moments of his career.|$|E

25|$|The villagers of Ploverleigh are {{preparing}} to celebrate the betrothal of Alexis Pointdextre, {{the son of the}} local baronet, and the blue-blooded Aline Sangazure ("Ring forth, ye bells"). Only a young village maiden named Constance Partlet seems unwilling to join in the happy mood, and we learn as she tells her mother that she is secretly in love with the local vicar, Dr Daly ("When he is here, I sigh with pleasure"); and the cleric himself promptly soliloquises that he has been unlucky in love ("The air is charged with amatory numbers"). However, despite Mrs. Partlet's best attempts at matchmaking, <b>the</b> <b>middle-aged</b> Dr Daly seems unable to conceive that a young girl like Constance would be interested in him.|$|E
25|$|Surviving letters {{indicate}} {{the marriage was}} stable {{and she had no}} intention of ever returning to the United States. <b>The</b> <b>middle-aged</b> couple discussed retiring in either South Africa or Australia. Meanwhile, they moved about constantly in the Bay of Bengal area in the Indian Ocean, staying in Ceylon, India, Burma, Straits Settlements, and Java. In 1940, at the age of 45, Gibson was stricken by a bladder infection, medical treatment for which was not available in the region. With Europe overwhelmed by war and passage to South Africa and Australia threatened by German naval operations, she reluctantly returned without her spouse to Los Angeles and underwent surgery twice at Hollywood Hospital. Her husband Elbert Lewis died when the Japanese bombed Socony-Vacuum's oil facility at Penang, Straits Settlements (now Malaysia) on March 15, 1942.|$|E

500|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, Lansbury {{declined}} several cinematic roles, including {{the lead in}} The Killing of Sister George {{and the role of}} Nurse Ratched in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. Instead, she accepted the role of the Countess von Ornstein, an aging German aristocrat who {{falls in love with a}} younger man, in Something for Everyone (1970), for which she filmed on location in Hohenschwangen, Bavaria. That same year she appeared as <b>the</b> <b>middle-aged</b> English witch Eglentine Price in the Disney film Bedknobs and Broomsticks; this was her first lead in a screen musical, and led to her publicising the film on television programmes like the David Frost Show. She later noted that as a big commercial hit, this film [...] "secured an enormous audience for me".|$|E

500|$|Baldwin III {{returned}} to Antioch in summer 1150. He wanted to persuade Constance to remarry, proposing three candidates (Yves, Count of Soissons, Walter of Saint Omer, and Ralph of Merle), but she declined. Urged by BaldwinIII, Constance went to Tripoli in early 1152 {{to meet him}} and her two aunts, Melisende and Hodierna. The two ladies tried to persuade Constance to choose among the three candidates, but she {{returned to}} Antioch without making a promise to remarry. According to William of Tyre, Patriarch Aimery convinced Constance to resist, {{because he wanted to}} control the government of the principality. The Byzantine Emperor ManuelI Komnenos sent his widowed brother-in-law, <b>the</b> <b>middle-aged</b> John Rogerios Dalassenos, to Antioch to marry Constance.

Tributes focused on his successes as a cricketer and appealing personality. Summing up Chapman's life, Gibson writes: [...] "But just as a good end can redeem a sad life, so a good life can redeem a sad end, and he had known his hours, his years of glory." [...] Swanton concluded his obituary of Chapman in 1961: [...] "The elderly and <b>the</b> <b>middle-aged</b> will recall him rather in his handsome sunlit youth, the epitome of all that was gay and fine in the game of cricket." ...|$|E
