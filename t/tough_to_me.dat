5000|$|Eckersley {{announced}} his retirement in December 1998. He commented on his career, saying, [...] "I had a good run. I had some magic that was {{with me for a}} long time, so I know that I was real lucky to not have my arm fall off for one thing, and to make it this long physically is <b>tough</b> enough. But <b>to</b> <b>me</b> it's like you're being rescued too when your career's over. It's like, 'Whew, the pressure's off." ...|$|R
5000|$|The Danish Chemist and Jorck Prize winner Kjeld Rasmussen {{described}} {{his view of}} Bak in his farewell remarks from the University of Copenhagen: [...] "My occupation with infrared spectroscopy lead to teaching Molecular Spectroscopy. It was done in collaboration with this subject's Nestor in Denmark, Børge Bak, who was professor at the University of Copenhagen and external lecturer at Polyteknisk Læreanstalt which is the old name of the Technical University. Børge Bak was stepping down, being ill, and I soon took over the teaching, in the beginning with Bak as censor. A <b>tough</b> one, both <b>to</b> <b>me</b> and <b>to</b> the students." ...|$|R
2500|$|Faldo's {{decision}} to only appoint one vice-captain, {{instead of the}} usual four or five, was also met with doubts about his ability {{to know what was going}} on in all the matches being played simultaneously. Faldo was accused by the media of being a [...] "loner" [...] and a [...] "control freak", thus also contributing to the team's failings. In an interview with the British Daily Mail newspaper in 2012, Faldo said of his Ryder Cup captaincy: [...] "The bottom line is that it was a tough experience and very <b>tough</b> for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> deal with afterwards." [...] The Daily Mail described Europe's 2008 Ryder Cup defeat as [...] "a calamitous loss".|$|R
5000|$|One of Sakurai's {{earliest}} {{experiences in}} the video game industry began when he worked for HAL Laboratory, where he created the character Kirby at age 19 and directed his first title, Kirby's Dream Land. Sakurai left HAL on August 5, 2003, after growing tired of the sequelization from HAL, ending {{his work on the}} Kirby series. [...] "It was <b>tough</b> for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> see that every time I made a new game, people automatically assumed that a sequel was coming," [...] said Sakurai, in an interview with Nintendo Dream, two weeks after he resigned from HAL. He explained that, [...] "even if it's a sequel, lots of people have to give their all to make a game, but some people think the sequel process happens naturally." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "It is <b>tough</b> <b>to</b> {{summarize}} {{a person}} like Alan Eagleson {{in just a few}} words. He appears <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> have been someone who, above all else, was driven by greed. That word greed always seems to come up in any conversation you have with people who knew the man. He always wanted more and it didn't seem to matter how he accumulated it, or at whose expense it came." ...|$|R
5000|$|I have a {{hard time}} talking about Norm. It's like he's too close <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> but I don't think he's changed over the years. They moved him from being an {{accountant}} to painter and decorator, but that was basically for some storylines. He's still the same Norm. I think he's the <b>toughest</b> <b>to</b> write for because he's not really anything. He's just funny. George Wendt ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps {{they intend}} <b>to</b> starve <b>me</b> into surrender," [...] he thought; [...] "but they won't succeed {{so long as}} my tablets hold out. And if, in time, they should starve me, I'll be too thin and <b>tough</b> <b>to</b> make good eating; so I'll {{get the best of}} them, anyhow." ...|$|R
500|$|... "Until It Beats No More" [...] is {{featured}} as background music in Lopez's commercial for the Fiat 500. The commercial, entitled [...] "My World", depicts Lopez leaving Manhattan and {{making her way}} to The Bronx, her hometown. Lopez is seen {{behind the steering wheel}} of the car, gazing out at the scenery of The Bronx passing by. A voice-over says the words: [...] "Here, this is my world. This place inspires <b>me</b> <b>to</b> be <b>tougher,</b> <b>to</b> stay sharper, to think faster. They may be just streets to you but <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> they're a playground." ...|$|R

2500|$|Henderson fought Fedor Emelianenko on July 30, 2011 at [...] Many had {{speculated that}} Henderson would meet Fedor at a catch weight, but Strikeforce later {{confirmed}} the fight as a heavyweight bout. Henderson said, [...] "Its <b>tough</b> for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> gain weight. [...] I did weightlifting {{and plenty of}} eating; I don’t know what else I’m supposed to do. [...] I’m not going to feel outmatched or small in there." [...] He had {{to step on the}} scales weighing at least 206 pounds in order to qualify for the heavyweight division, and weighed in at 207. Fedor weighed in a bit below his normal weight, with the scale reading 223 pounds. Henderson defeated Emelianenko via KO at 4:12 of the 1st round. This was the last fight on Henderson's Strikeforce contract. Henderson {{said he would like to}} re-sign to defend his Strikeforce Light Heavyweight Championship.|$|R
5000|$|In 2009, Jerry Cantrell invited Elton John to join Alice in Chains and {{pay tribute}} to Staley playing the piano in [...] "Black Gives Way To Blue", the title track and closing song in the band's first album in 14 years. The song was written by Cantrell, who {{described}} it as the band's goodbye to Staley: “That song really set it in stone, {{because we had to}} properly address Layne’s death and say goodbye to our friend. We had done it privately, but {{if we were going to}} do this, we had to do it publicly. It’s a beautiful song and it’s still really <b>tough</b> for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> listen to”, Cantrell told in 2016. The first concert that Staley attended was Elton John's, and his mother revealed that he was blown away by it. Staley's former bandmates also thanked him in the album's liner notes.|$|R
5000|$|Edwards {{said that}} he [...] "ran well, {{and that was really}} fun, we raced out front,” Edwards said. “It is really <b>tough</b> for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> finish second here. … We’ll just move forward. A day or two will pass, and maybe this thing will wear off, and I’ll be more excited about the points {{situation}} going into Talladega, because that’s the bright side.” He expanded on coming up short again at his self-described home track saying there are [...] "so many people that come to this racetrack that support me and have supported me. Not just when I’m racing here, but Capitol Speedway, Old Summit, Callaway Raceway, Godfrey, all these places I raced growing up. It’s a really special place for me. As much fun as I had racing up front, yeah, it stings. There are negative emotions tied to not winning here with that fast of a car. But that's the way it goes.” ...|$|R
5000|$|Severn {{failed to}} win in Olympic trials in 1984 and 1988, and was a finalist in the trials. During the 1984 Olympic trials, he lost the final {{qualifying}} match in controversial fashion to eventual gold medal winner Lou Banach, a match that Severn credits with launching his career. [...] "I would have retired in 1984 from competition had everything gone {{the way it should}} have gone...I should have been on the Olympic freestyle wrestling team and I should have won the gold medal. Instead, I went to Los Angeles as the alternate, and saw the guy I thought I beat win the gold medal. It was really <b>tough</b> for <b>me</b> <b>to</b> swallow that. That's what kept me going on." [...] In his long career, he has held many national and international titles. He was often introduced to the UFC Octagon as holding more than 100 in total. Severn also held the US national record for victories by pin from 1976 to 1992.|$|R

5000|$|Blake {{said that}} the role of a homewrecker was <b>tough</b> <b>to</b> play, and she was startled by the depth of public feeling towards her character. She {{admitted}} that she received hate mail and death threats from scorned female viewers who hated the role that she played. She commented, [...] "one woman wrote <b>to</b> <b>me</b> telling me that her marriage had almost been ruined when someone like Frankie went after her husband. It was a really vicious letter; she threatened <b>to</b> kill <b>me</b> and warned <b>me</b> <b>to</b> watch out. It was very frightening. She started the letter; `Dear Syan, stay away from Alan,' which worried me because she was obviously deluded and thought that I really am Frankie. Another woman stopped me in the street and told <b>me</b> she wanted <b>to</b> kick <b>me.</b> She was only joking - but I realised people really don't like Frankie. I suppose people hate her because she's such a threat, and she's so sexually confident." ...|$|R

2500|$|Wallace {{previously}} {{stated that}} filming the baby swap storylines [...] "did not stretch her acting abilities". She told Buzz: [...] "None of it's been really <b>tough</b> for <b>me,</b> <b>to</b> {{tell you the}} truth. I go in, do my scenes and then I go home. As an actress {{you want to get}} roles you can get your teeth into. I leave it at the gates when I leave work. Years ago, with the storyline when Kat told Zoe Slater she was her real mother, I found it tougher because I was new to the game. But I've been doing it a lot longer now, and can detach myself from it. You have to." [...] On a lighter note, Wallace added: [...] "There are two babies playing Tommy, called Ralph and Shane, and they're dressed in outfits like zebra-skin babygros and little denim jackets – that's the Alfie (Shane Richie) influence. They keep going for Kat's big earrings and they're always grabbing at the chicken fillets I have to wear." ...|$|R

[...] "I take responsibility for messing {{up at the end}} there. That's my fault. I cost the Dallas Cowboys a playoff win, and it's going <b>to</b> sit with <b>me</b> a long time.
