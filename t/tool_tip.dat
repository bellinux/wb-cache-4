40|$|Abstract. This paper {{suggests}} {{to enhance the}} concept of <b>tool</b> <b>tips</b> by presenting translucent preview bitmaps.

The second one is an application that provides previews of dialogs while browsing through the menu.

The improvement is achieved by calibrating the inertial measurement unit using advanced modeling of the nonlinear voltage output of a triple-axis low-g MEMS accelerometer. The nonlinear accelerometer’s model considers an interacting influence between the measuring axes of the arbitrarily oriented writing tool. With a combination of the attitude compensation and the zero-velocity compensation techniques the positional error of the <b>tool’s</b> <b>tip</b> on the paper is reduced...|$|R

50|$|Radial run-out is {{the result}} of a {{rotating}} component running off centre, such as a ball bearing with an offset centre. This means that the rotating tool or shaft, instead of being centrally aligned, will rotate about a secondary axis. In general, cutting tools are more tolerant of radial run-out since the edges are parallel to the line of cutting tending to keep the <b>tool</b> <b>tip</b> aligned. However, a rotating shaft may be less tolerant of radial run-out since the centre of gravity is displaced by the amount of run-out.|$|E
50|$|There are {{different}} types of form tools. Insert form tools {{are the most common}} for short- to medium-range jobs (50 to 20,000 pcs).

40|$|SummaryTool use, though rare, is taxonomically widespread, but {{morphological}} adaptations for tool use {{are virtually}} unknown [1]. We {{focus on the}} New Caledonian crow (NCC, Corvus moneduloides), which displays {{some of the most}} innovative tool-related behavior among nonhumans [2 – 6]. One of their major food sources is larvae extracted from burrows with sticks held diagonally [7] in the bill, oriented with individual, but not species-wide, laterality [8, 9]. Among possible behavioral [10] and anatomical adaptations for tool use [5, 11 – 15], NCCs possess unusually wide binocular visual fields (up to 60 °), suggesting that extreme binocular vision may facilitate tool use [5]. Here, we establish that during natural extractions, <b>tool</b> <b>tips</b> can only be viewed by the contralateral eye. Thus, maintaining binocular view of <b>tool</b> <b>tips</b> is unlikely to have selected for wide binocular fields; the selective factor is {{more likely to have been}} to allow each eye to see far enough across the midsagittal line to view the <b>tool’s</b> <b>tip</b> monocularly [5, 16]. Consequently, we tested the hypothesis that tool side preference follows eye preference and found that eye dominance does predict tool laterality across individuals. This contrasts with humans’ species-wide motor laterality and uncorrelated motor-visual laterality [17], possibly because bill-held tools are viewed monocularly and move in concert with eyes, whereas hand-held tools are visible to both eyes and allow independent combinations of eye preference and handedness. This difference may affect other models of coordination between vision and mechanical control, not necessarily involving tools...|$|R

The trepanation tool is generally equipped with a clutch which automatically disengages once it touches softer tissue, thus preventing tears in the dura.

Its working <b>tool</b> <b>tip</b> consists of a spiral blade that is framed by a guard device with an angled cranium guide that rests against the inner layer of the skull bone.

40|$|Increasing {{interest}} in commercializing functional nanostructured devices heightens {{the need for}} cost-effective manufacturing approaches for nanostructures. This paper presents an investigation of a scale-up manufacturing approach for nanostructures through diamond turning using a nanoscale multi-tip diamond <b>tool</b> (four <b>tip</b> <b>tool</b> with <b>tip</b> width of 150 nm) fabricated by focused ion beam (FIB). The manufacturing capacity of this new technique is evaluated {{through a series of}} cutting trials on copper substrates under different cutting conditions (depth of cut 100 – 500 nm, spindle speed 12 – 120 rpm). The machined surface roughness and nanostructure patterns are measured by using a white light interferometer and a scanning electron microscope, respectively. Results show that the form accuracy and integrity of the machined nanostructures were degraded with the increase of the depth of cut and the cutting speed. The burr and the structure damage are two major machining defects. High precision nano-grooves (form error of bottom width < 6. 7 %) was achieved when a small depth of cut of 100 nm was used (spindle speed[*]=[*] 12 rpm). Initial tool wear was found at both the clearance cutting edge and the side edges of <b>tool</b> <b>tips</b> after a cutting distance of 2. 5 km. Moreover, the nanometric cutting process was emulated by molecular dynamic (MD) simulations.

40|$|The {{elimination}} of all external incisions {{is an important}} step in reducing the invasiveness of surgical procedures. Natural Orifice Translumenal Endoscopic Surgery (NOTES) is an incision-less surgery and provides explicit benefits such as reducing patient trauma and shortening recovery time. However, technological difficulties impede the widespread utilization of the NOTES method. A novel robotic tool has been developed, which makes NOTES procedures feasible by using multiple interchangeable <b>tool</b> <b>tips.</b> The robotic <b>tool</b> has the capability of entering the body cavity through an orifice or a single incision using a flexible articulated positioning mechanism and once inserted is not constrained by incisions, allowing for visualization and manipulations throughout the cavity. Multiple interchangeable <b>tool</b> <b>tips</b> of the robotic device initially consist of three end effectors: a grasper, scissors, and an atraumatic Babcock clamp. The tool changer is capable of selecting and switching between the three tools depending on the surgical task using a miniature mechanism driven by micro-motors. The robotic tool is remotely controlled through a joystick and computer interface. In this thesis, the following aspects of this robotic tool will be detailed. The first-generation robot is designed as a conceptual model for implementing a novel mechanism of switching, advancing, and controlling the <b>tool</b> <b>tips</b> using two micro-motors. It is believed that this mechanism achieves a reduction in cumbersome instrument exchanges and can reduce overall procedure time and the risk of inadvertent tissue trauma during exchanges with a natural orifice approach. Also, placing actuators directly at the surgical site enables the robot to generate sufficient force to operate effectively. Mounting the multifunctional robot on the distal end of an articulating tube provides freedom from restriction on the robot kinematics and helps solve some of the difficulties otherwise faced during surgery using NOTES or related approaches. The second-generation multifunctional robot is then introduced in which the overall size is reduced and two arms provide 2 additional degrees of freedom, resulting in feasibility of insertion through the esophagus and increased dexterity. Improvements are necessary in future iterations of the multifunctional robot; however, the work presented is a proof of concept for NOTES robots capable of abdominal surgical interventions...|$|R
