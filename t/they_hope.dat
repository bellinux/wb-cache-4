5|$|I think everybody's enjoyed {{doing their}} own thing. Sharon and Caroline are young mothers, they have young children. Our {{mother and father}} were really were great parents and <b>they</b> <b>hope</b> to be as good a mother as mine, but Sharon's making her own record and will {{hopefully}} release it at some point. But we (the band) never finished, we'll keep it open.|$|E

5|$|Qatar Radio (QR) is {{currently}} an associate {{member of the}} European Broadcasting Union (EBU), while all competing countries of the Eurovision Song Contest must be active members of the Union. The broadcaster first revealed on 12 May 2009 that {{they were interested in}} becoming active members of the Union, which would allow the nation to compete in the Contest. Qatar Radio has stated that <b>they</b> <b>hope</b> to join Eurovision by 2011.|$|E
5|$|They {{decided to}} focus on a few aspects and assess the value of other features. This approach, <b>they</b> <b>hope,</b> helps to {{maintain}} the quality of their games. The company focused on the development of role-playing games, with the team working on established franchises with a fan base and introducing lesser-known franchises to a wide audience. When the team develops an open-world game, they prioritise quest design over the size of its world in the belief that having choices to make encourages players to immerse themselves in the game.|$|E
5|$|After {{having been}} {{unconscious}} {{for over a}} week, Makoto awakens in the hospital to find Yukari, who explains their similarity in having both lost parents during the accident in the past. The next day Ikutsuki, Akihiko and Mitsuru recruit Makoto to the Specialized Extracurricular Execution Squad—SEES to help them fight the Shadow creatures responsible for the Apathy Syndrome by preying on humans during the Dark Hour midnight phenomenon. Not long after as Junpei also joins SEES, Akihiko deduces that they have enough members to begin exploring their school's Dark Hour form, a Shadow-infested labyrinth called Tartarus, where <b>they</b> <b>hope</b> to unearth {{the mystery of the}} Dark Hour. Makoto also befriends Fuka Yamagishi (Mamiko Noto) and learns of her strained relationship with class bully, Natsuki Moriyama (Yuka Komatsu).|$|E

5|$|After the Spartans' first {{successful}} operation, John-117 is {{briefed on the}} threat posed by the Covenant, a theocratic alliance of alien races, and witnesses the utter devastation wrought by a single ship. In 2552, the Chief and Spartans return to Reach, where the UNSC High Command has developed a last-ditch plan to capture a Covenant High Prophet, who <b>they</b> <b>hope</b> could be used in order to barter a truce. The Master Chief's armor is upgraded, and he first encounters the artificial intelligence (AI) Cortana during a training mission. The Covenant arrive and invade, despite the best efforts of the Spartans and other UNSC forces. Aboard the spaceship Pillar of Autumn, Cortana plots a random course of escape. Seemingly the last Spartan alive, the Master Chief enters cryonic sleep along with the Pillar of Autumns crew.|$|E
5|$|Further {{examination}} of the blood of both Zero and the dead man reveal that their condition has been induced through gene therapy. Watts and Black theorize that the DOE is developing a biological weapon which would incite violence and rioting in a targeted population; they learn that the research is being conducted by scientists involved in the Human Genome Project. Later, the body of Knox is found at a nearby morgue. Later, Black and Watts, assisted by local police, raid an office building connected to the project, which they believe is using homeless shelters to test their pathogen. <b>They</b> <b>hope</b> to recover Zero in the raid, but find him cogent and working for the project—his real name is Dr. William Kramer, and he denies any knowledge of the incident. Black believes Kramer was accidentally infected during his work, and finds a photograph in the man's office, showing him in military uniform, {{taking part in the}} 1994 Rwandan Genocide.|$|E
5|$|Ron's (Nick Offerman) ex-wife Tammy (Megan Mullally) {{continues}} {{her efforts}} to sabotage his life, but the normally susceptible Ron easily resists her seductions because {{he is now in}} a solid relationship with Tom's (Aziz Ansari) ex-wife Wendy (Jama Williamson), much to Tom's jealousy. Later, however, Wendy and Ron break up after she announces she is moving back to Canada. Meanwhile, Leslie (Amy Poehler) and the parks department throw a party for the Pawnee police department, where <b>they</b> <b>hope</b> to ask them to provide security for the upcoming Harvest Festival. During the party, Ben (Adam Scott) awkwardly fails to get Chief Trumple's (Eric Pierpoint) favor. Tom, unaware of Ron and Wendy's breakup, arrives at the party with Tammy to make him jealous. After bickering loudly, Ron and Tammy both decide to leave the party together to talk and try to make amends. However, a night filled with drunken sex and mayhem ensues, ending with the two getting remarried and ending up in jail.|$|E

5|$|The Pandavas {{complete}} 12 {{years of}} forest {{life as a}} part of their 13-year exile stipulation of a rigged dice game they were defeated in by the Kauravas. As per the rule, in the 13th year, Pandavas and their wife Draupadi have to assume different identities and live incognito until the upcoming Vijayadashami. In case their real identity is unveiled, they have to repeat their 12-year exile again. That would give a chance to the Kauravas to prohibit Pandavas from attacking and gaining the reigns of the Kuru Kingdom for a longer period, and possibly forever. Pandavas choose the Matsya Kingdom ruled by Virata, a kind hearted but weak spirited king. <b>They</b> <b>hope</b> to find employment in the king's palace.|$|E
5|$|The {{station is}} one of the most {{recently}} built coal-fired power stations in the United Kingdom, but with a generating capacity of only 420megawatts (MW), is now one of the smallest operating. Two separate wind farm plans currently have permission to be built near the station, one for a 13 turbine wind farm near the smelter and another three turbine wind farm to the north of the station. In 2009, Alcan announced that <b>they</b> <b>hope</b> to fit the station with carbon capture and storage technology. In 2011, it was announced that the power station may be converted to burn biomass only, in a bid to avoid government legislation. In January 2016 the station was purchased by Energetický a průmyslový holding (EPH).|$|E
5|$|In the Second Phase, events play in vaguely {{the same}} fashion, {{but there are}} minor variations: Lorica forms an {{alliance}} with Milites rather than being conquered, and while Concordia offers an alliance, Imperial sympathizers within Concordia orchestrate the Queen's death and ally with Concordia. After overcoming Lorica and Concordia, the Rubrum forces storm the Militesi capital and Cid is killed. Before dying, he warns the Cadet and his comrades of the Crystals' role in Orience's cycle. When Tempus Finis arrives, Ace goes alone to find the one mentioned by Cid. He is himself marked as a l'Cie and transformed into Judge Ace. As with the previous cycle, he is defeated, but Tempus Finis arrives and the cycle continues. In a final side story episode, various additional stories revolving around the main cast are revealed. Among the events presented are a talk between Myuria and Arecia as to whether to continue the experiment, and then Lean and Tono are chosen by Arecia to exist outside the cycle and retain their memories. In this new form, the two agree to gather the memories of Orience's people {{and find a way}} of liberating the world from its cycle. The story ends with them wishing the Cadet well, saying that <b>they</b> <b>hope</b> to meet them again in a future cycle.|$|E

5|$|On the Palamecia, {{the other}} members of the party reunite with Vanille and Sazh before they confront Galenth Dysley, the Sanctum's Primarch, who is the Cocoon fal'Cie ruler Barthandelus in disguise. Barthandelus tells the party that their Focus is to {{transform}} into the beast Ragnarok and slay the sleeping fal'Cie Orphan, who keeps Cocoon afloat above Pulse. Slaying Orphan will result in the destruction of Cocoon. The party flees and learns from Cid that the fal'Cie believe that Cocoon's destruction will summon the Maker, the creator of the worlds. The fal'Cie cannot harm Orphan themselves. Vanille and Fang reveal to the party that they were involved in the War of Transgression centuries earlier, and that their Focus then had been the same: to transform into Ragnarok and attempt to destroy Orphan. The party flies away to Pulse and journeys to Oerba, Vanille and Fang's hometown, where <b>they</b> <b>hope</b> to learn how to remove their l'Cie marks. The town is deserted, and they find no living people on the surface. The party is unsuccessful in removing their marks, and Barthandelus confronts them again. The party learns that Barthandelus has made Cid the new Primarch to create chaos in Cocoon to force the Cavalry to attack Cid and Orphan in a coup d'état.|$|E
5|$|The group battles Fei-Wang who {{destroys the}} Syaoran clone when he betrays him. He then uses the immeasurably strong ability and {{strength}} of the two Sakuras to resurrect Yūko, accidentally frozen in time by Clow Reed himself to halt her death, therein proving himself Clow's superior. Yūko uses her life and Clow's magic as payment to make the clones reborn {{in the past to}} live together. As the two know all of the series' events would repeat, the clones seal themselves in Yūko's shop until the battle against him. The group manages to kill Fei-Wang, who traps Syaoran in a void between time and space, dragging both his clone and Watanuki along as a consequence of their connection. With their creator's death, both clones of Sakura and Syaoran fade away leaving behind two feathers. Syaoran and Watanuki escape from the void for a price: Syaoran must continue traveling through the dimensions forever, while Watanuki must stay in Yūko's shop. The group rests in the Kingdom of Clow where Fai, Kurogane, and Mokona decide to join Syaoran once again in hope of finding a way to bring back the clones who still exist as the two feathers. Before departing on their separate ways, Syaoran and Sakura confess their mutually strong, close and pure romantic love for each other as <b>they</b> <b>hope</b> to meet again.|$|E
5|$|The {{main source}} from which S.thiersii derives its carbon is the {{cellulose}} of the decomposing plant material found in its grassland habitat. The enzymes that degrade cellulose are homologous to the enzymes used by ectomycorrhizal fungi that have symbiotic associations with plant roots. In {{an attempt to}} identify the genes involved in these processes, researchers at the United States Department of Energy and University of Wisconsin are jointly working to sequence the S. thiersii genome and to compare it with that of Amanita bisporigera, a species which forms mycorrhizal relationships with tree and which has already been partly sequenced. <b>They</b> <b>hope</b> {{to better understand the}} genetic pathways involved in the evolution of ectomycorrhizal associations. Another research objective is to establish whether the enzymes used by S. thiersii to degrade cellulose can be cost-effectively used in the conversion of crop residues into biofuels. S.thiersii seems to be expanding its range northwards and its genome may provide clues as to how it is adapting to climate change and further information on mycorrhizal relationships.|$|E

5|$|There was a {{good deal}} of {{interest}} in the 2004 transit as scientists attempted to measure the pattern of light dimming as Venus blocked out some of the Sun's light, in order to refine techniques that <b>they</b> <b>hope</b> to use in searching for extrasolar planets. Current methods of looking for planets orbiting other stars only work for a few cases: planets that are very large (Jupiter-like, not Earth-like), whose gravity is strong enough to wobble the star sufficiently for us to detect changes in proper motion or Doppler shift changes in radial velocity; Jupiter or Neptune sized planets very close to their parent star whose transit causes changes in the luminosity of the star; or planets which pass in front of background stars with the planet-parent star separation comparable to the Einstein ring and cause gravitational microlensing. Measuring light intensity {{during the course of a}} transit, as the planet blocks out some of the light, is potentially much more sensitive, and might be used to find smaller planets. However, extremely precise measurement is needed: for example, the transit of Venus causes the amount of light received from the Sun to drop by a fraction of 0.001 (that is, to 99.9% of its nominal value), and the dimming produced by small extrasolar planets will be similarly tiny.|$|E
