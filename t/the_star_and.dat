5|$|Astronomers {{hoped to}} {{implement}} a survey called the N2K Consortium, a collaboration which uses Doppler spectroscopy to find radial velocity measurements of stars that hadn't been previously surveyed. The project searched particularly for gas giants with short orbits around metal-rich stars to find how the metallicity of <b>the</b> <b>star</b> <b>and</b> {{the mass of the}} planet are related.|$|E

G. T. Beauregard recommended that the Confederate flag be changed.|$|R

5|$|In the post-War years, translucent, molded plastic, electrified, lit-from-within tree toppers in {{the shape}} of angels and stars became popular. Although Santa Claus and other Christmas icons were {{introduced}} as electrified toppers, <b>the</b> <b>star</b> <b>and</b> the angel of the Victorian era remained the preferred motif. Glass spire ornaments were also popular as toppers.|$|E
5|$|A tidal {{disruption}} {{event of}} this sort is when a star interacts with a supermassive black hole shredding <b>the</b> <b>star,</b> <b>and</b> in some cases creating a relativistic jet which produces bright emission of gamma ray radiation. The event GRB 110328A (also denoted Swift J1644+57) was initially argued to be produced by the disruption of a main sequence star by a black hole of several million times {{the mass of the}} Sun, although it has subsequently been argued that the disruption of a white dwarf by a black hole of mass about 10 thousand times the Sun may be more likely.|$|E
5|$|At the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon, Gielgud {{did much}} to reclaim his {{position}} as a leading Shakespearean. His cold, unsympathetic Angelo in Peter Brook's production of Measure for Measure (1950) showed the public a new, naturalistic manner in his playing. He followed this with three other Shakespeare productions with Brook, which were well received. His own attempt at direction in Stratford, for Richardson's Macbeth in 1952, was much less successful, with poor notices for <b>the</b> <b>star</b> <b>and</b> worse ones for the director.|$|E

5|$|Florence Harding became deeply {{involved}} in her husband's career, both at <b>the</b> <b>Star</b> <b>and</b> once he entered politics. Exhibiting her father's determination and business sense, she helped turn the Star into a profitable enterprise through her tight management of the paper's circulation department. She has been credited with helping Harding achieve more than he might have alone; {{some have suggested that}} she pushed him {{all the way to the}} White House.|$|E
5|$|In 1868, Sirius {{became the}} first star to have its {{velocity}} measured, {{the beginning of the}} study of celestial radial velocities. Sir William Huggins examined the spectrum of <b>the</b> <b>star</b> <b>and</b> observed a red shift. He concluded that Sirius was receding from the Solar System at about 40km/s. Compared to the modern value of −5.5km/s, this was an overestimate and had the wrong sign; the minus means it is approaching the Sun.|$|E
5|$|In 1960 Newman {{devised a}} thriller series for ABC called Police Surgeon, {{starring}} Ian Hendry. Although Police Surgeon {{was not a}} success and was cancelled after only a short run, Newman took Hendry as <b>the</b> <b>star,</b> <b>and</b> some of the ethos of the programme, {{to create a new}} series (not a direct sequel as is sometimes claimed) called The Avengers. Debuting in January 1961, The Avengers became an international success, although in later years its premise differed somewhat from Newman's initial set-up, veering into more humorous territory rather than remaining a gritty thriller.|$|E

5|$|In 1987, {{when she}} was 17 years old, Zeta-Jones was picked as the second {{understudy}} to the lead actress in a West End production of 42nd Street. During one of the performances, both <b>the</b> <b>star</b> <b>and</b> the first understudy were unavailable, and Zeta-Jones was asked {{to play the role}} of Peggy Sawyera chorus girl who becomes a star. The producer was impressed by her acting ability and allowed her to play the role for the next two years. Her next stage appearance was with the English National Opera at the London Coliseum in 1989 where she played Mae Jones in Kurt Weill's Street Scene.|$|E
5|$|In Mesopotamian iconography, the {{crescent}} {{was the primary}} symbol of Nanna-Sîn. The Moon goddess Selene was represented as wearing a crescent on her headgear in an arrangement reminiscent of horns. <b>The</b> <b>star</b> <b>and</b> crescent arrangement also {{goes back to the}} Bronze Age, representing either the Sun and Moon, or the Moon and planet Venus, in combination. It came to represent the goddess Artemis or Hecate, and via the patronage of Hecate came {{to be used as a}} symbol of Byzantium.|$|E
5|$|In September 1883, Queen Victoria {{appointed}} {{him to her}} yacht, HMY Victoria and Albert. On 30 April 1884 at Darmstadt {{in the presence of}} the Queen, Prince Louis married her granddaughter, Princess Victoria of Hesse and by Rhine. His wife was the eldest daughter of Queen Victoria's second daughter Princess Alice by Louis IV, Grand Duke of Hesse. Through the Hesse family, Prince and Princess Louis of Battenberg were first cousins once removed. They had known each other since childhood, and invariably spoke English to each other. As wedding presents Louis received the British Order of the Bath and <b>the</b> <b>Star</b> <b>and</b> Chain of the Hessian Order of Louis.|$|E

5|$|It {{is thought}} {{that this type of}} {{atmosphere}} loss may be common to all planets orbiting Sun-like stars closer than around 0.1 AU. HD 209458 b will not evaporate entirely, although it may have lost up to about 7% of its mass over its estimated lifetime of 5 billion years. It may be possible that the planet's magnetic field may prevent this loss, because the exosphere would become ionized by <b>the</b> <b>star,</b> <b>and</b> the magnetic field would contain the ions from loss.|$|E
5|$|Kepler-4 {{is named}} for the Kepler spacecraft, a NASA {{telescope}} tasked with finding Earth-like planets that transit their stars as seen from Earth. As the previous three planets that Kepler confirmed had already been confirmed by other finds, Kepler-4 and its planet {{were the first to}} be discovered by the Kepler team. <b>The</b> <b>star</b> <b>and</b> its system were announced in Washington, D.C. at the 215th meeting of the American Astronomical Society on January 4, 2010, along with Kepler-5, Kepler-6, Kepler-7, and Kepler-8. Of the presented planets, Kepler-4b was the smallest, around the size of planet Neptune. The discovery of Kepler-4b and the other planets presented at the AAS meeting helped to confirm that the Kepler spacecraft was indeed functional.|$|E

Fourteen stars {{have been given to}} groups, such as music bands, comedy troupes, sports teams. In these cases, the group name is listed on <b>the</b> <b>star</b> <b>and</b> the names of individual members are omitted.|$|E

5|$|On July 2, 2009, July 3, 2009, and August 8, 2009, {{use of the}} NIFS {{integral}} field spectrograph with ALTAIR {{allowed the}} astronomers {{to collect data on}} the spectrum of the faint object and its star. Analysis of the spectra and the objects' astrometry (how <b>the</b> <b>star</b> <b>and</b> the faint object change position in the sky) led to the confirmation of the companion HIP 78530 b.|$|E
5|$|On March 22, 2005, NASA {{released}} {{news that}} infrared {{light from the}} planet had been measured by the Spitzer Space Telescope, the first ever direct detection of light from an extrasolar planet. This was done by subtracting the parent star's constant light and noting the difference as the planet transited in front of <b>the</b> <b>star</b> <b>and</b> was eclipsed behind it, providing {{a measure of the}} light from the planet itself. New measurements from this observation determined the planet's temperature as at least 750°C (1300°F). The circular orbit of HD 209458 b was also confirmed.|$|E
5|$|Since 2011, the Google Pakistan {{homepage}} has featured special doodles {{designed with}} Pakistani symbols to mark Pakistan's Independence Day.

Facebook allows its users in Pakistan to post an independence day status with a Pakistani flag icon on it; or greets {{users in the}} country with a special message on the home page.|$|E
