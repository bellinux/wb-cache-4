5|$|At the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos Laboratory, {{research}} into implosion had been proceeding under Seth Neddermeyer, but his division {{had worked with}} cylinders and small charges, and had only produced objects that looked like rocks.

30|$|The above {{data shows}} {{that the notion of}} Continuation, Decrement, and Close <b>to</b> <b>Expectation</b> are closely connected. It has been {{demonstrated}} earlier by data type 11, 13, 23, 24, 25, 27, 28, 30, 31, and 32 that Continuation and Decrement can be expressed by different repetitive grams. We can set this pair of correlation aside. As in our investigation, the function of Close <b>to</b> <b>Expectation</b> is always expressed by the same form that denotes Continuation, we believe this pattern demonstrates that the notion of Close <b>to</b> <b>Expectation</b> should be considered as an automatic extension of Continuation. This is the reason why in the conceptual space that we proposed in the previous section, there is no such conceptual node as Close <b>to</b> <b>Expectation.</b> Besides, this cross-linguistic observation also provides robust support for not separating the use of Close <b>to</b> <b>Expectation</b> from the use of Continuation for the characterization of hai.|$|R

The Social Democrats had become the most popular party in opinion polls and were considered the likely winners at the next general election in 2008; opinion polls indicated that Pahor would easily win the presidential election. However, after months of mixed signals, Pahor finally announced that he would instead concentrate on the general election and would not run for the mostly ceremonial office of the president.|$|E
5|$|In {{their first}} game of the season, the Hokies lived up <b>to</b> <b>expectations,</b> {{shutting}} out James Madison University, 470. The game was the first time Tech had shut out an opponent in a season opener since 1953. The game was marred, however, by a leg injury to Michael Vick that caused him to leave the game. The following week, against the University of Alabama Birmingham, Vick did not play. Despite his absence, the Hokies still managed a 3110 win. This was followed by a 3111 Thursday-night victory over Clemson in Virginia Tech's first game against a Division I-A opponent during the season.|$|E

It is also found that the heterogeneity of market participants with respect <b>to</b> <b>expectation</b> formation goes a long way towards explaining volatility. ...|$|R

TDR-1 aircraft equipped a single mixed squadron (Special Air Task Group 1) along with TBM Avenger control aircraft, and the first operational mission took place on September 27, conducting bombing operations against Japanese ships. Despite this success, the assault drone program had already been canceled after the production of 189 TDR-1 aircraft, due to a combination of continued technical problems, the aircraft failing to live up <b>to</b> <b>expectations,</b> and the fact that more conventional weaponry was proving adequate for the defeat of Japan.

5|$|In December1994, CSU {{predicted}} that only 12named storms would form and 8of those would become hurricanes; 3major hurricanes were projected. CSU noted an above average season due <b>to</b> <b>expectations</b> {{that the existing}} El Niño would dissipate, while a La Niña would develop {{by the summer of}} 1995. Additionally, the western areas of the Sahara Desert were predicted to have the fourth or fifth rainiest season since 1970. A year with heavier precipitation in this region usually correlates with an active Atlantic hurricane season. In April1995, CSU revised their forecast, decreasing the number of named storms to 10, hurricanes to 6, and major hurricanes to 2. However, in June, CSU reverted to their December forecast, which called for 12named storms, 8hurricanes, and 3major hurricanes. The forecast by the WRC in early 1995 was 10named storms and 6hurricanes, with no prediction on the number of major hurricanes.|$|E
5|$|Malmö FF's {{board of}} {{directors}} initiated {{the search for a}} new stadium in the mid-1990s. Malmö Stadion, where Malmö FF had played since its construction in 1958, was starting to deteriorate by this time, and was also too large for the club, which often struggled to fill it for Allsvenskan matches. In 1995, club chairman Bengt Madsen began {{to raise money for the}} renovation of Malmö IP, the club's former home between 1910 and 1957, into a modern football stadium. Malmö IP was practical and economical for the club as it was already an extant site, and was smaller than Malmö Stadion, which was expensive to maintain. The renovation of Malmö IP was finished in August 1999, and Malmö FF moved in soon after. However, the renovated ground failed to live up <b>to</b> <b>expectations,</b> proving to be very basic by modern standards; the paltry capacity of 7,600 was also deemed a security issue. The club therefore moved back to Malmö Stadion in 2001.|$|E

When he took up art as an adult, he began at an elementary level.

Van Gogh's work did not live up <b>to</b> <b>expectations.</b> Marinus offered a second commission, specifying the subject matter in detail, but was again disappointed with the result. Van Gogh persevered; he experimented with lighting in his studio using variable shutters, and with different drawing materials. For more than a year he worked on single figures– highly elaborate studies in black and white, which at the time gained him only criticism. Later, they were recognised as early masterpieces.|$|E

On January 19, 2000, Jordan returned to the NBA not as a player, but as part owner and President of Basketball Operations for the Washington Wizards. Jordan's responsibilities with the Wizards were comprehensive. He controlled all aspects of the Wizards' basketball operations, and had the final say in all personnel matters. Opinions of Jordan as a basketball executive were mixed. He managed to purge the team of several highly paid, unpopular players (such as forward Juwan Howard and point guard Rod Strickland), but used the first pick in the 2001 NBA draft to select high schooler Kwame Brown, who did not live up <b>to</b> <b>expectations</b> and was traded away after four seasons.|$|E

The Blue Jackets signed Mark Dekanich as the back-up who had only 50 minutes of NHL experience prior to the start of the season. Columbus did sign a veteran Curtis Sanford to be their third string goaltender and to start for their American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Springfield Falcons. Sanford had not played in the NHL since 2009. During training camp, Dekanich suffered a high ankle sprain that was expected to keep him out of the line-up for a month. Additionally, Sanford suffered a groin injury, leaving Allen York as the back-up. York had only played four professional games, all in the AHL, entering the season.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, {{the film}} sold the most tickets of any {{film in the}} {{franchise}} until 2009's Star Trek, and it remains the highest-grossing film of the franchise worldwide adjusted for inflation, but Paramount considered its gross disappointing compared <b>to</b> <b>expectations</b> and marketing. The Motion Pictures budget of $46million, including costs incurred during PhaseII production, was the largest for any film made within the United States up to that time. David Gerrold estimated before its release that the film would have to gross {{two to three times}} its budget to be profitable for Paramount. The studio faulted Roddenberry's script rewrites and creative direction for the plodding pace and disappointing gross. While the performance of The Motion Picture convinced the studio to back a (cheaper) sequel, Roddenberry was forced out of its creative control. Harve Bennett and Nicholas Meyer would produce and direct , which received better reviews (becoming a fan favorite) and continued the franchise. With the successful revival of the Star Trek brand on the big screen setting an example, Hollywood increasingly turned to 1960s television series for material.|$|E

5|$|Recombination allows alleles on {{the same}} strand of DNA to become separated. However, the rate of {{recombination}} is low (approximately two events per chromosome per generation). As a result, genes close together on a chromosome {{may not always be}} shuffled away from each other and genes that are close together tend to be inherited together, a phenomenon known as linkage. This tendency is measured by finding how often two alleles occur together on a single chromosome compared <b>to</b> <b>expectations,</b> which is called their linkage disequilibrium. A set of alleles that is usually inherited in a group is called a haplotype. This can be important when one allele in a particular haplotype is strongly beneficial: natural selection can drive a selective sweep that will also cause the other alleles in the haplotype to become more common in the population; this effect is called genetic hitchhiking or genetic draft. Genetic draft caused by the fact that some neutral genes are genetically linked to others that are under selection can be partially captured by an appropriate effective population size.|$|E
