5|$|A sequel, Fortune Winds: Ancient Trader, was {{developed}} by Swedish studio Legendo Entertainment and released in July 2012 for Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X. Fortune Winds includes improved AI, new player avatars and a save feature. GamesMaster was unimpressed with the sequel. The magazine awarded it 69 out of 100 and commented that it deviated <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>from</b> the original indie game.|$|E
5|$|During {{his time}} as {{archbishop}} there was a dispute with the monks of Christ Church Priory in Canterbury, who resented Baldwin's attempts to impose stricter control over them and disputed the legitimacy of Baldwin's election. For his part, Baldwin did not approve of the luxurious and pampered life the monks of Christ Church lived, and felt that they profited <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>from</b> the cult of Thomas Becket.|$|E

5|$|Romney took a {{hands-on}} {{role in the}} Belmont Stake's matters, helping in domestic maintenance efforts, visiting the sick, and counseling burdened church members. A number of local church members later credited him with turning their lives around or helping them through difficult times. Others, rankled by his leadership style, desired a more consensus-based approach. Romney tried to balance the conservative directives from church leadership in Utah with the desire of some Massachusetts members {{to have a more}} flexible application of religious doctrine. He agreed with some requests from a liberal women's group that published Exponent II calling for changes in the way the church dealt with women, but he clashed with women whom he felt were departing <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>from</b> doctrine. In particular, he counseled women not to have abortions except in the rare cases allowed by LDS doctrine and encouraged unmarried women facing unplanned pregnancies to give up their babies for adoption. Romney later said that the years spent as an LDS minister gave him direct exposure to people struggling financially and empathy for those with family problems.|$|E

25|$|Whereas {{the first}} Godfather game {{received}} a generally positive reception, The Godfather II received mixed to negative reviews across all platforms. Common criticisms included graphical glitches, technical bugs, poor AI, and an unimaginative open world design. Many critics also felt the game deviated <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>from</b> both the plot and {{tone of the}} film, {{and that it was}} too easy and too short. Whereas the first game sold well, the sequel was a commercial failure, selling less than 400,000 units worldwide across all platforms. Its poor critical and commercial performance led EA to scrap plans to adapt the third film.|$|E
5000|$|Despite {{having been}} dissolved, the Commission presided by Barthélémy Saint-Hilaire and named by Carnot {{submitted}} its draft and {{report to the}} Assembly on 10 April 1849. This work was ignored during further discussions. On 18 June 1849, Falloux submitted to the Assembly the draft bill elaborated by the ministerial commission which he had himself named. Falloux thus resumed his plans: [...] "Instruction has remained <b>too</b> <b>much</b> isolated <b>from</b> education; education has remained <b>too</b> <b>much</b> isolated <b>from</b> religion." ...|$|R

She produced a script they were happy with, but then handed it to Robert Redford, who began to tinker it to fit his persona. Eventually the producers took it away from Redford and offered it to Lumet, who had just seen a production of Mamet's, American Buffalo with Al Pacino, and preferred to use Mamet's original script. In the end the studio had paid both Allen and Redford and ended up with Mamet's original script anyway.|$|E
25|$|The {{design of}} the AGR was such that the final steam {{conditions}} at the boiler stop valve were identical to that of conventional coal-fired power stations, thus the same design of turbo-generator plant could be used. The mean temperature of the hot coolant leaving the reactor core {{was designed to be}} 648°C. In order to obtain these high temperatures, yet ensure useful graphite core life (graphite oxidises readily in CO2 at high temperature) a re-entrant flow of coolant at the lower boiler outlet temperature of 278°C is utilised to cool the graphite, ensuring that the graphite core temperatures do not vary <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>from</b> those seen in a Magnox station. The superheater outlet temperature and pressure were designed to be 2,485psi (170 bar) and 543°C.|$|E
25|$|She became {{extremely}} {{proficient in}} the use of pastels, eventually creating many of her most important works in this medium. Degas also introduced her to etching, of which he was a recognized master. The two worked side-by-side for a while, and her draftsmanship gained considerable strength under his tutelage. He depicted her in a series of etchings recording their trips to the Louvre. She treasured his friendship but learned not to expect <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>from</b> his fickle and temperamental nature after a project they were collaborating on at the time, a proposed journal devoted to prints, was abruptly dropped by him. The sophisticated and well-dressed Degas, then forty-five, was a welcome dinner guest at the Cassatt residence, and likewise they at his soirées.|$|E

25|$|Davitt was a {{brave and}} proud man; an ascetic who {{accepted}} no tribute for his work; on occasions impatient {{with those who}} disagreed with him; sometimes expecting <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>from</b> the farmers, as in 1885 when he described them responding in 'self-interest' rather than 'self-sacrifice’. He supported himself with writing and lectures and as a journalist defended the underprivileged, in 1903 publishing the book Within the pale: The True Story of Anti-Semitic Persecutions in Russia. This was based on reports made by him to an American newspaper in 1903 on anti-Semitic outrages in Russia and travel to Russia to investigate the incident. A pogrom was initiated {{in the town of}} Kishinev in the Russian province of Bessarabia, resulting in 51 people being killed and over 500 injured, see the Kishinev pogrom.|$|E

500|$|Korn {{was well}} {{received}} by music critics.

[...] The Calgary Herald gave the album a negative review, noting that Davis' vocals derivative of Pantera's Philip Anselmo and Pearl Jam's Eddie Vedder. Musically, the review concluded that the Korn borrowed <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>from</b> Sonic Youth and Soundgarden.|$|E

The song was written by Timbaland, Jerome [...] "J-Roc" [...] Harmon, Hilson and Timothy [...] "Attitude" [...] Clayton, and produced by Timbaland with assistance from Harmon.
