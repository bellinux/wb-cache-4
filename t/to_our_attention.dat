We feel assured that your lordship's approbation will prove a stimulus to our future exertions, and that next Christmas (with God's blessing) will find us much further advanced, not only in our secular studies, but in the great study you so strongly recommended <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>attention</b> on your late visit, namely - 'the study of God's laws {{and those of the}} Church.' We conclude, begging your lordship's apostolic benediction, and wishing you a merry Christmas and many happy New Years. Signed on behalf of the pupils of St Peter's School. Laurence Lorigan.|$|E

The Athenians made sure that a Spartan delegation was also on hand to hear the offer, and rejected it: The degree to which we are put in the shadow by the Medes' strength is hardly something you need to bring <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>attention.</b> We are already well aware of it. But even so, such is our love of liberty, that we will never surrender. Upon this refusal, the Persians marched south again. Athens was again evacuated and left to the enemy. Mardonius now repeated his offer of peace to the Athenian refugees on Salamis. Athens, along with Megara and Plataea, sent emissaries to Sparta demanding assistance and threatening to accept the Persian terms if it was not given. [...] According to Herodotus, the Spartans, who were at that time celebrating the festival of Hyacinthus, delayed making a decision until they were persuaded by a guest, Chileos of Tegea, who pointed out the danger to all of Greece if the Athenians surrendered.When the Athenian emissaries delivered an ultimatum to the Spartans the next day, they were amazed to hear that a task force was in fact already en route; the Spartan army was marching to meet the Persians.|$|E

2500|$|As {{a case in}} point, Hazlitt {{brings in}} Irving's own mentor, the Scottish theologian, scientist, philosopher, and {{minister}} Dr. Thomas Chalmers (1780–1847), whom Hazlitt had heard preach in Glasgow. Comparing the published writings of both men, Chalmers was, thought Hazlitt, much more interesting as a thinker. Although he ultimately dismisses Chalmers' arguments as [...] "sophistry", Hazlitt admires the elder clergyman's [...] "scope of intellect" [...] and [...] "intensity of purpose". His Astronomical Discourses were engaging enough that Hazlitt had eagerly read through the entire volume at a sitting. His claim <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>attention</b> must rest on his writings; his unprepossessing appearance and ungainly manner in themselves, maintains Hazlitt, drew no audience. Chalmers' follower Irving, on the other hand, gets by {{on the strength of}} his towering physique and the novelty of his performances; judging him as a writer (his For the Oracles of God, Four Orations had just gone into a third edition), [...] Hazlitt finds that [...] "the ground work of his compositions is trashy and hackneyed, though set off by extravagant metaphors and an affected phraseology ... without the turn of his head and wave of his hand, his periods have nothing in them ... he himself is the only idea with which he has yet enriched the public mind!" ...|$|E

60|$|The {{wonderful}} knowledge {{gleaned from}} Natty Dingle's store {{and from the}} borings in the swamp brought me into trouble and conflict a few weeks later. Not far from me lived a neighbor's boy, a budding naturalist, who had a big yellow cat named Blink at his house. A queer old cat was Blink, and the greatest hunter I ever saw. He knew, for instance, where a mole {{could be found in}} his long tunnel,--and that is something that still puzzles me,--and caught scores of them; but, like most cats, he could never be induced to taste one. When he caught a mole and was hungry, he would hide it and go off to catch a mouse or a bird; and these he would eat, leaving the mole to be brought home as game. He would hunt by himself for hours at a time, and come meowing home, bringing everything he caught,--rats, squirrels, rabbits, quail, grouse, and even grasshoppers when no bigger game was afoot. At a distance we would hear his call, a peculiar yeow-yow that he gave only when he had caught something, and the boy would run out to meet him and take his game, while Blink purred and rubbed against his legs to show his pride and satisfaction. When no one met him he would go meowing round the house once or twice and then put his game under the door-step, where our noses must speedily call it <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>attention,</b> for Blink would never touch it again.|$|E
6000|$|The morning {{song of the}} cock is a sound {{unique in}} nature, and of all natural sounds {{it is the most}} universal. [...] "All climates agree with brave Chanticleer. He is more {{indigenous}} even than the natives. His health is ever good; his lungs are sound; his spirits never flag." [...] He is a pet bird among tribes that have never seen the peacock, goose, and turkey. In tropical countries where the dog becomes dumb, or degenerates into a mere growler, his trumpet never rusts. It is true that he was cradled in the torrid zone, yet in all Western lands, where he [...] "shakes off the powdery snow," [...] with vigorous wings, his voice sounds as loud and inspiriting as in the hot jungle. Pale-faced Londoners, and blacks, and bronzed or painted barbarians, all men all the world over, wake at morn to the [...] "peaceful crowing of the cock," [...] just as the Athenians woke of old, and the nations older still. It is not, therefore, strange that this song has more associations for man than any other sound in nature. But, apart from any adventitious claims <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>attention,</b> the sound possesses intrinsic merits and pleases for its own sake. In our other domestic birds we have, with regard to this point, been unfortunate. We have the gobbling of turkeys, and the hoarse, monotonous come back of the guinea-fowl, screaming of peacocks and geese, and quacking, hissing, and rasping of mallard and mus-covy. Above all these sounds the ringing, lusty, triumphant call of Chanticleer, as the far-reaching toll of the bell-bird sounds above the screaming and chattering of parrots and toucans in the Brazilian forest. A fine sound, which in spite of many changes of climate and long centuries of domestication still preserves that forest-born character of wildness, which gives so great a charm to the language of many woodland gallinaceous birds. As we have seen, it is variable, and in some artificial varieties has been suffered to degenerate into sounds harsh and disagreeable; yet it is plain that an improved voice in a beautiful breed would double the bird's value from an aesthetic point of view. As things now are, the fine voices are in a very small minority. Some bad voices in artificial breeds, i.e., those which, like the Brahma and Cochin, diverge most widely from the original type--are perhaps incurable, like the carrion crow's voice; for that bird will probably always caw harshly in spite of the musical throat which anatomists find in it. We can only listen to our birds, and begin experimenting with those already possessed of shapely notes and voices of good quality.|$|E
6000|$|I recall our {{coming on}} such a figure {{at the foot of}} a {{staircase}} and his having been announced to us by our conductor or friend in charge as likely to be there; and what a charm I found in his cool loose uniform of shining white (as I was afterwards to figure it,) as well as in his generally refined and distinguished appearance and in the fact that he was engaged, while exposed <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>attention,</b> in the commendable act of paring his nails with a smart penknife and that he didn't allow us to interrupt him. One of my companions, I forget which, had advised me that in these contacts with illustrious misfortune I was to be careful not to stare; and present to me at this moment is the wonder of whether he would think it staring to note that he quite stared, and also that his hands were fine and fair and one of them adorned with a signet ring. I was to have later in life a glimpse of two or three dismal penitentiaries, places affecting me as sordid, as dark and dreadful; but if the revelation of Sing-Sing had involved the idea of a timely warning to the young mind my small sensibility at least was not reached by the lesson. I envied the bold-eyed celebrity in the array of a planter at his ease--we might have been his slaves--quite as much as I envied Gussy; in connection with which I may remark here that though in that early time I seem to have been constantly eager to exchange my lot for that of somebody else, on the assumed certainty of gaining by the bargain, I fail to remember feeling jealous of such happier persons--in the measure open to children of spirit. I had rather a positive lack of the passion, and thereby, I suppose, a lack of spirit; since if jealousy bears, as I think, on what one sees one's companions able to do--as against one's own falling short--envy, as I knew it at least, was simply of what they were, or in other words of a certain sort of richer consciousness supposed, doubtless often too freely supposed, in them. They were so other--that was what I felt; and to be other, other almost anyhow, seemed as good as the probable taste of the bright compound wistfully watched in the confectioner's window; unattainable, impossible, of course, but as to which just this impossibility and just that privation kept those active proceedings in which jealousy seeks relief quite out of the question. A platitude of acceptance of the poor actual, the absence of all vision of how in any degree to change it, combined with a complacency, an acuity of perception of alternatives, though a view of them as only through the confectioner's hard glass--that is what I recover as the nearest approach to an apology, in the soil of my nature, for the springing seed of emulation. I never dreamed of competing--a business having in it at the best, for my temper, if not for my total failure of temper, a displeasing ferocity. If competing was bad snatching was therefore still worse, and jealousy was a sort of spiritual snatching. With which, nevertheless, all the while, one might have been [...] "like" [...] So-and-So, who had such horizons. A helpless little love of horizons I certainly cherished, and could sometimes even care for my own. These always shrank, however, under almost any suggestion of a further range or finer shade in the purple rim offered to other eyes--and that is what I take for the restlessness of envy. It wasn't that I wished to change with everyone, with anyone at a venture, but that I saw [...] "gifts" [...] everywhere but as mine and that I scarce know whether to call the effect of this miserable or monstrous. It was the effect at least of self-abandonment--I mean to visions.|$|E

6000|$|Among these shorter things (it {{is better}} {{to speak of the}} whole collection, {{including}} the Snow Image, and the Mosses from an Old Manse at once) there are three sorts of tales, each one of which has an original stamp. There are, to begin with, the stories of fantasy and allegory--those among which the three I have just mentioned would be numbered, and which on the whole, are the most original. This is the group to which such little masterpieces as Malvin's Burial, Rappacini's Daughter, and Young Goodman Brown also belong--these two last perhaps representing the highest point that Hawthorne reached in this direction. Then there are the little tales of New England history, which are scarcely less admirable, and of which The Grey Champion, The Maypole of Merry Mount, and the four beautiful Legends of the Province House, as they are called, are the most successful specimens. Lastly come the slender sketches of actual scenes and of the objects and manners about him, by means of which, more particularly, he endeavoured [...] "to open an intercourse with the world," [...] and which, in spite of their slenderness, have an infinite grace and charm. Among these things A Rill from the Town Pump, The Village Uncle, The Toll-Gatherer's Day, the Chippings with a Chisel, may most naturally be mentioned. As we turn over these volumes we feel that the pieces that spring most directly from his fancy, constitute, as I have said (putting his four novels aside), his most substantial claim <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>attention.</b> It {{would be a mistake to}} insist too much upon them; Hawthorne was himself the first to recognise that. [...] "These fitful sketches," [...] he says in the preface to the Mosses from an Old Manse, [...] "with so little of external life about them, yet claiming no profundity of purpose--so reserved even while they sometimes seem so frank--often but half in earnest, and never, even when most so, expressing satisfactorily the thoughts which they profess to image--such trifles, I truly feel, afford no solid basis for a literary reputation." [...] This is very becomingly uttered; but it may be said, partly in answer to it, and partly in confirmation, that the valuable element in these things was not what Hawthorne put into them consciously, but what passed into them without his being able to measure it--the element of simple genius, the quality of imagination. This is the real charm of Hawthorne's writing--this purity and spontaneity and naturalness of fancy. For the rest, it is interesting to see how it borrowed a particular colour from the other faculties that lay near it--how the imagination, in this capital son of the old Puritans, reflected the hue of the more purely moral part, of the dusky, overshadowed conscience. The conscience, by no fault of its own, in every genuine offshoot of that sombre lineage, lay under the shadow of the sense of sin. This darkening cloud was no essential part of the nature of the individual; it stood fixed in the general moral heaven, under which he grew up and looked at life. It projected from above, from outside, a black patch over his spirit, and it was for him to do what he could with the black patch. There were all sorts of possible ways of dealing with it; they depended upon the personal temperament. Some natures would let it lie as it fell, and contrive to be tolerably comfortable beneath it. Others would groan and sweat and suffer; but the dusky blight would remain, and their lives would be lives of misery. Here and there an individual, irritated beyond endurance, would throw it off in anger, plunging probably into what would be deemed deeper abysses of depravity. Hawthorne's way was the best, for he contrived, by an exquisite process, best known to himself, to transmute this heavy moral burden into the very substance of the imagination, to make it evaporate in the light and charming fumes of artistic production. But Hawthorne, of course, was exceptionally fortunate; he had his genius to help him. Nothing is more curious and interesting than this almost exclusively imported character of the sense of sin in Hawthorne's mind; it seems to exist there merely for an artistic or literary purpose. He had ample cognizance of the Puritan conscience; it was his natural heritage; it was reproduced in him; looking into his soul, he found it there. But his relation to it was only, as one may say, intellectual; it was not moral and theological. He played with it and used it as a pigment; he treated it, as the metaphysicians say, objectively. He was not discomposed, disturbed, haunted by it, in the manner of its usual and regular victims, who had not the little postern door of fancy to slip through, to the other side of the wall. It was, indeed, to his imaginative vision, the great fact of man's nature; the light element that had been mingled with his own composition always clung to this rugged prominence of moral responsibility, like the mist that hovers about the mountain. It was a necessary condition for a man of Hawthorne's stock that if his imagination should take licence to amuse itself, it should at least select this grim precinct of the Puritan morality for its play-ground. He speaks of the dark disapproval with which his old ancestors, in the case of their coming to life, would see him trifling himself away as a story-teller. But how far more darkly would they have frowned could they have understood that he had converted the very principle of their own being into one of his toys! ...|$|E
6000|$|SCENE II.--A Room in SIR TUNBELLY CLUMSY'S House. Enter MISS HOYDEN, NURSE, and TOM FASHION. Fash. This quick {{despatch}} of the chaplain's I take so kindly {{it shall}} give him claim to my favour {{as long as}} I live, I assure you. Miss Hoyd. And to mine too, I promise you. Nurse. I most humbly thank your honours; and may your children swarm about you like bees about a honeycomb! Miss Hoyd. Ecod, with all my heart--the more the merrier, I say--ha, nurse? Enter LORY. Lory. One word with you, for Heaven's sake. [Taking TOM FASHION hastily aside.] Fash. What the devil's the matter? Lory. Sir, your fortune's ruined {{if you are not}} married. Yonder's your brother arrived, with two coaches and six horses, twenty footmen, and a coat worth fourscore pounds--so judge what will become of your lady's heart. Fash. Is he in the house yet? Lory. No, they are capitulating with him at the gate. Sir Tunbelly luckily takes him for an impostor; and I have told him that we have heard of this plot before. Fash. That's right.--[Turning to MISS HOYDEN.] My dear, here's a troublesome business my man tells me of, but don't be frightened; we shall be too hard for the rogue. Here's an impudent fellow at the gate (not knowing I was come hither incognito) has taken my name upon him, in hopes to run away with you. Miss Hoyd. Oh, the brazen-faced varlet! it's well we are married, or maybe we might never have been so. Fash. [Aside.] Egad, like enough.--[Aloud.] Pr'ythee, nurse, run to Sir Tunbelly, and stop him from going to the gate before I speak to him. Nurse. An't please your honour, my lady and I had better, lock ourselves up till the danger be over. Fash. Do so, if you please. Miss Hoyd. Not so fast; I won't be locked up any more, now I'm married. Fash. Yes, pray, my dear, do, till we have seized this rascal. Miss Hoyd. Nay, if you'll pray me, I'll do anything. [Exit with NURSE.] Fash. Hark you, sirrah, things are better than you imagine. The wedding's over. Lory. The devil it is, sir! [Capers about.] Fash. Not a word--all's safe--but Sir Tunbelly don't know it, nor must not yet. So I am resolved to brazen the brunt of the business out, and have the pleasure of turning the impostor upon his lordship, which I believe may easily be done. Enter SIR TUNBELLY CLUMSY. Did you ever hear, sir, of so impudent an undertaking? Sir Tun. Never, by the mass; but we'll tickle him, I'll warrant you. Fash. They tell me, sir, he has a great many people with him, disguised like servants. Sir Tun. Ay, ay, rogues enow, but we have mastered them. We only fired a few shot over their heads, and the regiment scoured in an instant.--Here, Tummus, bring in your prisoner. Fash. If you please, Sir Tunbelly, it will be best for me not to confront this fellow yet, till you have heard how far his impudence will carry him. Sir Tun. Egad, your lordship is an ingenious person. Your lordship, then, will please to step aside. Lory. [Aside.] 'Fore heavens, I applaud my master's modesty! [Exit with TOM FASHION.] Enter SERVANTS, with LORD FOPPINGTON disarmed. Sir Tun. Come, bring him along, bring him along. Lord Fop. What the plague do you mean, gentlemen? is it fair time, that you are all drunk before supper? Sir Tun. Drunk, sirrah! here's an impudent rogue for you now. Drunk or sober, bully, I'm a justice o' the peace, and {{know how to deal with}} strollers. Lord Fop. Strollers! Sir Tun. Ay, strollers. Come, give an account of yourself. What's your name? where do you live? do you pay scot and lot? Come, are you a freeholder or a copyholder? Lord Fop. And why dost thou ask me so many impertinent questions? Sir Tun. Because I'll make you answer 'em, before I have done with you, you rascal, you! Lord Fop. Before Gad, all the answer I can make to them is, that you are a very extraordinary old fellow, stap my vitals. Sir Tun. Nay, if thou art joking deputy-lieutenants, we know how to deal with you.--Here, draw a warrant for him immediately. Lord Fop. A warrant! What the devil is't thou wouldst be at, old gentleman? Sir Tun. I would be at you, sirrah, (if my hands were not tied as a magistrate,) and with these two double fists beat your teeth down your throat, you dog, you! [Driving him.] Lord Fop. And why wouldst thou spoil my face at that rate? Sir Tun. For your design to rob me of my daughter, villain. Lord Fop. Rob thee of thy daughter! Now do I begin to believe I am in bed and asleep, and that all this is but a dream. Pr'ythee, old father, wilt thou give me leave to ask thee one question? Sir Tun. I can't tell whether I will or not, till I know what it is. Lord Fop. Why, then, it is, whether thou didst not write to my Lord Foppington, to come down and marry thy daughter? Sir Tun. Yes, marry, did I, and my Lord Foppington is come down, and shall marry my daughter before she's a day older. Lord Fop. Now give me thy hand, old dad; I thought we should understand one another at last. Sir Tun. The fellow's mad!--Here, bind him hand and foot. [They bind him.] Lord Fop. Nay, pr'ythee, knight, leave fooling; thy jest begins to grow dull. Sir Tun. Bind him, I say--he's mad: bread and water, a dark room, and a whip, may bring him to his senses again. Lord Fop. Pr'ythee, Sir Tunbelly, why should you take such an aversion to the freedom of my address as to suffer the rascals thus to skewer down my arms like a rabbit?--[Aside.] Egad, if I don't awake, by all that I can see, this is like to prove one of the most impertinent dreams that ever I dreamt in my life. Re-enter MISS HOYDEN and NURSE. Miss Hoyd. [Going up to LORD FOPPINGTON.] Is this he that would have run--Fough, how he stinks of sweets!--Pray, father, let him be dragged through the horse-pond. Lord Fop. This must be my wife, by her natural inclination to her husband. [Aside.] Miss Hoyd. Pray, father, what do you intend to do with him--hang him? Sir Tun. That, at least, child. Nurse. Ay, and it's e'en too good for him too. Lord Fop. Madame la gouvernante, I presume: hitherto this appears to me to be one of the most extraordinary families that ever man of quality matched into. [Aside.] Sir Tun. What's become of my lord, daughter? Miss Hoyd. He's just coming, sir. Lord Fop. My lord! what does he mean by that, now? [Aside.] Re-enter TOM FASHION and LORY. Stap my vitals, Tam, now the dream's out! [Runs.] Fash. Is this the fellow, sir, that designed to trick me of your daughter? Sir Tun. This is he, my lord. How do you like him? Is not he a pretty fellow to get a fortune? Fash. I find by his dress he thought your daughter might be taken with a beau. Miss Hoyd. Oh, gemini! is this a beau? let me see him again. [Surveys him.] Ha! I find a beau is no such ugly thing, neither. Fash. [Aside.] Egad, she'll be in love with him presently --I'll e'en have him sent away to jail.--[To LORD FOPPINGTON.] Sir, though your undertaking shows you a person of no extraordinary modesty, I suppose you ha'n't confidence enough to expect much favour from me? Lord Fop. Strike me dumb, Tam, thou art a very impudent fellow. Nurse. Look, if the varlet has not the effrontery to call his lordship plain Thomas! Lord Fop. My Lord Foppington, shall I beg one word with your lordship? Nurse. Ho, ho! it's my lord with him now! See how afflictions will humble folks. Miss Hoyd. Pray, my lord--[To FASHION]--don't let him whisper too close, lest he bite your ear off. Lord Fop. I am not altogether so hungry as your ladyship is pleased to imagine.--[Aside to TOM FASHION.] Look you, Tam, I am sensible I have not been so kind to you as I ought, but I hope you'll forgive what's past, and accept of the five thousand pounds I offer--thou mayst live in extreme splendour with it, stap my vitals! Fash. It's a much easier matter to prevent a disease than to cure it. A quarter of that sum would have secured your mistress, twice as much cannot redeem her. [Aside to LORD FOPPINGTON.] Sir Tun. Well, what says he? Fash. Only the rascal offered me a bribe to let him go. Sir Tun. Ay, he shall go, with a plague to him!--lead on, constable. Enter SERVANT. Ser. Sir, here is Muster Loveless, and Muster Colonel Townly, and some ladies to wait on you. [To TOM FASHION.] Lory. [Aside to TOM FASHION.] So, sir, what will you do now? Fash. [Aside to LORY.] Be quiet; they are in the plot.--[Aloud.] Only a few friends, Sir Tunbelly, whom I wish to introduce to you. Lord Fop. Thou art the most impudent fellow, Tam, that ever nature yet brought into the world.--Sir Tunbelly, strike me speechless, but these are my friends and acquaintance, and my guests, and they will soon inform thee whether I am the true Lord Foppington or not. Enter LOVELESS, COLONEL TOWNLY, AMANDA, and BERINTHIA.--LORD FOPPINGTON accosts them as they pass, but none answer him. Fash. So, gentlemen, this is friendly; I rejoice to see you. Col. Town. My lord, we are fortunate to be the witnesses of your lordship's happiness. Love. But your lordship will do us the honour to introduce us to Sir Tunbelly Clumsy? Aman. And us to your lady. Lord Fop. Gad take me, but they are all in a story! [Aside.] Sir Tun. Gentlemen, you do me much honour; my Lord Foppington's friends will ever be welcome to me and mine. Fash. My love, let me introduce you to these ladies. Miss Hoyd. By goles, they look so fine and so stiff, I am almost ashamed to come nigh 'em. Aman. A most engaging lady indeed! Miss Hoyd. Thank ye, ma'am. Ber. And I doubt not will soon distinguish herself in the beau monde. Miss Hoyd. Where is that? Fash. You'll soon learn, my dear. Love. But Lord Foppington-- Lord Fop. Sir! Love. Sir! I was not addressing myself to you, sir!--Pray who is this gentleman? He seems rather in a singular predicament-- Col. Town. For so well-dressed a person, a little oddly circumstanced, indeed. Sir Tun. Ha! ha! ha!--So, these are your friends and your guests, ha, my adventurer? Lord Fop. I am struck dumb with their impudence, and cannot positively say whether I shall ever speak again or not. Sir Tun. Why, sir, this modest gentleman wanted to pass himself upon me as Lord Foppington, and carry off my daughter. Love. A likely plot to succeed, truly, ha! ha! Lord Fop. As Gad shall judge me, Loveless, I did not expect this from thee. Come, pr'ythee confess the joke; tell Sir Tunbelly that I am the real Lord Foppington, who yesterday made love to thy wife; was honoured by her with a slap on the face, and afterwards pinked through the body by thee. Sir Tun. A likely story, truly, that a peer would behave thus. Love. A pretty fellow, indeed, that would scandalize the character he wants to assume; but what will you do with him, Sir Tunbelly? Sir Tun. Commit him, certainly, unless the bride and bridegroom choose to pardon him. Lord Fop. Bride and bridegroom! For Gad's sake, Sir Tunbelly, 'tis tarture to me to hear you call 'em so. Miss Hoyd. Why, you ugly thing, what would you have him call us--dog and cat? Lord Fop. By no means, miss; for that sounds ten times more like man and wife than t'other. Sir Tun. A precious rogue this to come a-wooing! Re-enter SERVANT. Ser. There are some gentlefolks below to wait upon Lord Foppington. [Exit.] Col. Town. 'Sdeath, Tom, what will you do now? [Aside to TOM FASHION.] Lord Fop. Now, Sir Tunbelly, here are witnesses who I believe are not corrupted. Sir Tun. Peace, fellow!--Would your lordship choose to have your guests shown here, or shall they wait till we come to 'em? Fash. I believe, Sir Tunbelly, we had better not have these visitors here yet.--[Aside.] Egad, all must out. Love. Confess, confess; we'll stand by you. [Aside to TOM FASHION.] Lord Fop. Nay, Sir Tunbelly, I insist on your calling evidence on both sides--and if I do not prove that fellow an impostor-- Fash. Brother, I will save you the trouble, by now confessing that I am not what I have passed myself for.--Sir Tunbelly, I am a gentleman, and I flatter myself a man of character; but'tis with great pride I assure you I am not Lord Foppington. Sir Tun. Ouns!--what's this?--an impostor?--a cheat?--fire and faggots, sir, if you are not Lord Foppington, who the devil are you? Fash. Sir, the best of my condition is, I am your son-in-law; and the worst of it is, I am brother to that noble peer. Lord Fop. Impudent to the last, Gad dem me! Sir Tun. My son-in-law! not yet, I hope. Fash. Pardon me, sir; thanks to the goodness of your chaplain, and the kind offices of this gentlewoman. Lory. 'Tis true indeed, sir; I gave your daughter away, and Mrs. Nurse, here, was clerk. Sir Tun. Knock that rascal down!--But speak, Jezebel, how's this? Nurse. Alas! your honour, forgive me; I have been overreached in this business as well as you. Your worship knows, if the wedding-dinner had been ready, you would have given her away with your own hands. Sir Tun. But how durst you do this without acquainting me? Nurse. Alas! if your worship had seen how the poor thing begged and prayed, and clung and twined about me like ivy round an old wall, you would say, I who had nursed it, and reared it, must have had a heart like stone to refuse it. Sir Tun. Ouns! I shall go mad! Unloose my lord there, you scoundrels! Lord Fop. Why, when these gentlemen are at leisure, I should be glad to congratulate you on your son-in-law, with a little more freedom of address. Miss Hoyd. Egad, though, I don't see which is to be my husband after all. Love. Come, come, Sir Tunbelly, a man of your understanding must perceive that an affair of this kind is not to be mended by anger and reproaches. Col. Town. Take my word for it, Sir Tunbelly, you are only tricked into a son-in-law you may be proud of: my friend Tom Fashion is as honest a fellow as ever breathed. Love. That he is, depend on't; and will hunt or drink with you most affectionately: be generous, old boy, and forgive them-- Sir Tun. Never! the hussy!--when I had set my heart on getting her a title. Lord Fop. Now, Sir Tunbelly, that I am untrussed--give me leave to thank thee for the very extraordinary reception I have met with in thy damned, execrable mansion; and at the same time to assure you, that of all the bumpkins and blockheads I have had the misfortune to meek with, thou art the most obstinate and egregious, strike me ugly! Sir Tun. What's this! I believe you are both rogues alike. Lord Fop. No, Sir Tunbelly, thou wilt find to thy unspeakable mortification, that I am the real Lord Foppington, who was to have disgraced myself by an alliance with a clod; and that thou hast matched thy girl to a beggarly younger brother of mine, whose title deeds might be contained in thy tobacco-box. Sir Tun. Puppy! puppy!--I might prevent their being beggars, if I chose it; for I could give 'em as good a rent-roll as your lordship. Lord Fop. Ay, old fellow, but you will not do that--for that would be acting like a Christian, and thou art a barbarian, stap my vitals. Sir Tun. Udzookers! now six such words more, and I'll forgive them directly. Love. 'Slife, Sir Tunbelly, you should do it, and bless yourself--Ladies, what say you? Aman. Good Sir Tunbelly, you must consent. Ber. Come, you have been young yourself, Sir Tunbelly. Sir Tun. Well then, if I must, I must; but turn--turn that sneering lord out, however, and let me be revenged on somebody. But first look whether I am a barbarian or not; there, children, I join your hands; and when I'm in a better humour, I'll give you my blessing. Love. Nobly done, Sir Tunbelly! and we shall see you dance at a grandson's christening yet. Miss Hoyd. By goles, though, I don't understand this! What! an't I to be a lady after all? only plain Mrs.--What's my husband's name, nurse? Nurse. Squire Fashion. Miss Hoyd. Squire, is he?--Well, that's better than nothing. Lord Fop. [Aside.] Now I will put on a philosophic air, and show these people, that it is not possible to put a man of my quality out of countenance.--[Aloud.] Dear Tam, since things are fallen out, pr'ythee give me leave to wish thee joy; I do it de bon coeur, strike me dumb! You have married into a family of great politeness and uncommon elegance of manners, and your bride appears to be a lady beautiful in person, modest in her deportment, refined in her sentiments, and of nice morality, split my windpipe! Miss Hoyd. By goles, husband, break his bones if he calls me names! Fash. Your lordship may keep up your spirits with your grimace, if you please; I shall support mine, by Sir Tunbelly's favour, with this lady and three thousand pounds a year. Lord Fop. Well, adieu, Tam!--Ladies, I kiss your, hands!-- Sir Tunbelly, I shall now quit this thy den; but while I retain the use of my arms, I shall ever remember thou art a demned horrid savage; Ged demn me! [Exit.] Sir Tun. By the mass, 'tis well he's gone--for I should ha' been provoked, by-and-by, to ha' dun un a mischief. Well, if this is a lord, I think Hoyden has luck on her side, in troth. Col. Town. She has, indeed, Sir Tunbelly.--But I hear the fiddles; his lordship, I know, has provided 'em. Love. Oh, a dance and a bottle, Sir Tunbelly, by all means! Sir Tun. I had forgot the company below; well--what--we must be merry, then, ha? and dance and drink, ha? Well, 'fore George, you shan't say I do these things by halves. Son-in-law there looks like a hearty rogue, so we'll have a night on't: and which of these ladies will be the old man's partner, ha?--Ecod, I don't know how I came to be in so good a humour. Ber. Well, Sir Tunbelly, my friend and I both will endeavour to keep you so: you have done a generous action, and are entitled <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>attention.</b> If you should be at a loss to divert your new guests, we will assist you to relate to them the plot of your daughter's marriage, and his lordship's deserved mortification; a subject which perhaps may afford no bad evening's entertainment. Sir Tun. Ecod, with all my heart; though I am a main bungler at a long story. Ber. Never fear; we will assist you, if the tale is judged worth being repeated; but of this you may be assured, that while the intention is evidently to please, British auditors will ever be indulgent to the errors of the performance.
