5000|$|Hines {{was an avid}} improviser. He {{did a lot of}} {{improvisation}} of <b>tap</b> <b>steps,</b> <b>tap</b> sounds, and tap rhythms alike. His improvisation was like that of a drummer, doing a solo and coming up with all sorts of rhythms. He also improvised the phrasing of a number of <b>tap</b> <b>steps</b> that he would come up with, mainly based on sound produced. A laid back dancer, he usually wore nice pants and a loose-fitting shirt. Although he inherited the roots and tradition of the black rhythmic tap, he also influenced the new black rhythmic tap, as a proponent. [...] "'He purposely obliterated the tempos,' wrote tap historian Sally Sommer, 'throwing down a cascade of taps like pebbles tossed across the floor. In that moment, he aligned tap with the latest free-form experiments in jazz and new music and postmodern dance.'" ...|$|R

50|$|Buck dancing was the {{earliest}} {{combination of the}} basic shuffle and <b>tap</b> <b>steps</b> performed to syncopated rhythms in which accents are placed not on the straight beat, as with the jigs, clogs, and other dances of European origin, but on the downbeat or offbeat, a style derived primarily from the rhythms of African tribal music.|$|R

50|$|Chula in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, is danced as a {{challenge}} and is practiced only by men. A four-foot wooden stick called a spear {{is placed on the}} floor. At the sound of bagpipes, Gaucho dancers perform different <b>tapping</b> <b>steps</b> {{back and forth across the}} spear. After each sequence is performed, another dancer must repeat it and add complexity. The dancer who loses can not maintain the rhythm, touches the stick or can not perform the sequence of choreography danced by the dancer before. Today this dance is generally performed at cultural events such as festivals and rodeos.|$|R

50|$|Common <b>tap</b> <b>steps</b> {{include the}} shuffle, shuffle ball change, double shuffle, leap shuffle, hop shuffle, flap, flap ball change, running flaps, flap heel, cramproll, buffalo, Maxi Ford, Maxi Ford with a pullback, pullbacks, wings, Cincinnati, the shim sham shimmy (also called the Lindy), Irish, Waltz Clog, the paddle roll, the paradiddle, stomp, brushes, scuffs, spanks, riffs, and single and double toe punches, hot steps, heel clicks, time steps, over-the-tops, {{military}} time step, New Yorkers, Shiggy Bops, drawbacks, and chugs. In advanced <b>tap</b> dancing, basic <b>steps</b> are often combined {{together to create}} new steps. Many steps also have single, double, and triple versions, including pullbacks, timesteps, and drawbacks. In tap, various types of turns can be done, including step heel turns, Maxi Ford turns, cramproll turns, and drag turns. Timesteps are widely used in tap and can vary in different areas. These consist of a rhythm that is changed to make new timesteps by adding or removing steps.|$|R
5000|$|The {{authentic}} dance {{from the}} Dominican Republic in the Caribbean {{is a basic}} dance sequence in a full 8-count moving within a square. Dancers in the Western world much later made up a basic step going from side to side, and also copied dance elements from other couple dances of various origins, Latin and non Latin alike. The basic dance sequence consists of three steps and then a <b>tap</b> <b>step</b> or various forms of step syncopation (such as the [...] "double step"). Some dancers in the west accompany the tap with an exaggerated [...] "pop” of the hips. Bachata can be danced on the 1st beat of the musical phrase, with the tap on the 4th beat, but dancing on the 2nd, 3rd or 4th beat is also common. The tap is done on the opposite foot of the last step, while {{the next step is}} taken on the same foot as the tap. The dance direction changes after the <b>tap</b> or fourth <b>step.</b>|$|R

She also {{became friends with}} Baakari Wilder, who was attending school at New York University, too. During that time, Wilder was a principal dancer for Bring in 'da Noise, Bring in 'da Funk. Wilder taught Casel <b>tap</b> <b>steps</b> and she accompanied him to tap events at clubs in New York, where she would learn improvisation. She joined the New York Shakespeare Festival Institute of Tap. With the encouragement of Wilder, Casel started studying under Barbara Duffy. He also introduced her to Savion Glover, who would help Casel launch her career.|$|R

50|$|This {{medley of}} Irving Berlin numbers danced {{in tribute to}} Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers was devised for the brief tour Torvill and Dean did with the Ice Capades in 1987, but {{continued}} as the final number throughout their long Russian All Stars Tour into 1990. For costumes Chris wore full white tie, waistcoat, and tails, while Jayne wore a flowing near full-length blue dress complete with blue feather boa. Although neatly choreographed with spectacular music and lighting effects, it was arguably not as evocative of Fred and Ginger or as technically accomplished as the amazing “Putting on the Ritz” routines that they performed at the Skate Canada Amateur exhibition in 1982. One impressive component however was the incorporation of <b>tap</b> <b>steps</b> on ice {{during the middle of}} the routine. During the All Stars Tour (and possibly the Ice Capades as well) they kept to a similar theme for the final bow, skating on with the company to I Got Rhythm.|$|R
5000|$|The {{modern dance}} from New York was popularized in the 1980s by Eddie Torres, Angel Rodriguez of RazzM'Tazz Mambo Dance Company, and others, {{many of whom}} were 2nd {{generation}} New York Puerto Ricans. This style is sometimes danced to mambo music, but more often to salsa dura (old-school salsa). It is termed [...] "mambo on 2" [...] because the break, or direction change, in the basic step occurs on count 2. The Eddie Torres and Razz M'Tazz schools each have different basic steps, even though they share this same basic feature. Eddie Torres describes his version as a [...] "street" [...] style he developed out of what he saw on the Bronx streets. The RazzM'Tazz version is closer to the Palladium mambo (from the Palladium ballroom in the 1950s), whose basic step was in turn derived from Cuban son, with which it shares its timing (234 - 678, with pauses on 1 and 5) both styles derived from the American Mambo with the freestyle steps based on jazz and <b>tap</b> <b>steps.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Opposing dancers {{can also}} face {{off in a}} line {{formation}} called the [...] "Apache Line". In contrast to the circle formation in breakdancing, the Apache line allows multiple opposing dancers or crews to face each other and execute their burns. Back in the 1970s it was a fascinating display to watch. Each Uprocker must keep in his/her line formation while battling. One form of Apache line competition utilized rotation positioning. In other words, dancers would battle until either he is <b>tapped</b> to <b>step</b> out by another Rocker, or the opponent has been worn down.|$|R
