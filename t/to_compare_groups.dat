50|$|Permutational multivariate {{analysis}} of variance (PERMANOVA), is a non-parametric multivariate statistical test. PERMANOVA is used <b>to</b> <b>compare</b> <b>groups</b> of objects and test the null hypothesis that the centroids and dispersion of the groups as defined by measure space are equivalent for all groups. A rejection of the null hypothesis means that either the centroid and/or the spread of the objects is different between the groups. Hence the test is based on the prior calculation of the distance between any two objects included to the experiment.PERMANOVA shares some resemblance to ANOVA where they both measure the sum-of-squares within and between group and make use of F test to compare within-group to between-group variance. However, while ANOVA bases the significance of the result on assumption of normality, PERMANOVA draws tests for significance by comparing the actual F test result to that gained from random permutations of the objects between the groups. Moreover, whilst PERMANOVA tests for similarity based on a chosen distance measure, ANOVA tests for similarity of the group averages.|$|E
50|$|Clinical {{trials are}} known {{to be one of the}} most {{valuable}} sources of data in evidence-based medicine. For a pharmaceutical, device, or procedure to be approved for regular use in the U.S., it must be rigorously tested in clinical trials, and demonstrate sufficient efficacy. Unfortunately clinical trials are also extremely expensive and time consuming. End-points, such as morbidity and mortality, are used as measures <b>to</b> <b>compare</b> <b>groups</b> within a clinical trial. The most basic endpoint used in clinical trials, mortality, requires years and sometimes decades of follow-up to sufficiently assess. Morbidity, although potentially faster to measure than mortality, can also be a very difficult endpoint to measure clinically, as it is often very subjective. These are some of the reasons why biomarkers have been increasingly used in clinical trials to detect subtle changes in physiology and pathology before they can are detected clinically. The biomarkers act as surrogate endpoints. The use of surrogate endpoints has been shown to significantly decrease the time and resources used in clinical trials. Because surrogate end-points allow researchers to assess a marker rather than the patient, it allows participants to act as their own control, and in many cases allows for easier blinding.|$|E
