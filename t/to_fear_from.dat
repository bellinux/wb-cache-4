5|$|The {{ships which}} sail the {{southern}} sea {{and south of}} it are like houses. When their sails are spread they are like great clouds in the sky. Their rudders are several tens of feet long. A single ship carries several hundred men, and has in the stores a year's supply of grain. Pigs are fed and wine fermented on board. There is no account of dead or living, no {{going back to the}} mainland when once the people have set forth upon the caerulean sea. At daybreak, when the gong sounds aboard the ship, the animals can drink their fill, and crew and passengers alike forget all dangers. To those on board everything is hidden and lost in space, mountains, landmarks, and the countries of foreigners. The shipmaster may say 'To make such and such a country, with a favourable wind, in so many days, we should sight such and such a mountain, (then) the ship must steer in such and such a direction'. But suddenly the wind may fall, and may not be strong enough to allow of the sighting of the mountain on the given day; in such a case, bearings may have to be changed. And the ship (on the other hand) may be carried far beyond (the landmark) and may lose its bearings. A gale may spring up, the ship may be blown hither and thither, it may meet with shoals or be driven upon hidden rocks, then it may be broken to the very roofs (of its deckhouses). A great ship with heavy cargo has nothing <b>to</b> <b>fear</b> <b>from</b> the high seas, but rather in shallow water it will come to grief.|$|E
25|$|The Palmyrene {{rebellion}} in Egypt had probably reduced the grain supply to Rome, thus disaffecting {{the population to}} the emperor.

25|$|In non-Orthodox {{denominations}} of Judaism most rabbis {{hold that}} Jews have nothing <b>to</b> <b>fear</b> <b>from</b> engaging in theological dialogue, {{and may have}} much to gain. Some hold that in practice Soloveitchik's distinctions are not viable, for any group that has sustained discussion and participation on moral issues will implicitly involve theological discourse. Thus, since informal implicit theological dialogue will occur, one might as well admit it and publicly work on formal theological dialogue.|$|E

Several more republican initiatives emerged, including ProRepublica, the New Republican Fellowship, the Republican Socialists and the Republican Platform. It is unclear {{if these are}} still active. The Republican People's Party (1994–2003) partook in the 2002 general election, but failed to gain any seats.

25|$|While the Sandinistas {{encouraged}} grassroots pluralism, {{they were}} perhaps less enthusiastic about national elections. They argued that popular support was {{expressed in the}} insurrection and that further appeals to popular support {{would be a waste}} of scarce resources. International pressure and domestic opposition eventually pressed the government toward a national election. Tomás Borge warned that the elections were a concession, an act of generosity and of political necessity. On the other hand, the Sandinistas had little <b>to</b> <b>fear</b> <b>from</b> the election given the advantages of incumbency and the restrictions on the opposition, and they hoped to discredit the armed efforts to overthrow them.|$|E
25|$|As {{with all}} films {{in which his}} {{character}} made an appearance, Stalin took {{a keen interest in}} the work on The Fall of Berlin. The premier intervened in Pavlenko's writing, read the screenplay's manuscript and corrected several grammatical mistakes; he also deleted a short sequence during which a German civilian in Berlin exhorted his family to hasten and flee as the Red Army approaches. German historian Lars Karl believed this signaled his resolution to demonstrate that the civilian populace had nothing <b>to</b> <b>fear</b> <b>from</b> the Soviets. The picture was the first feature film about the Battle of Berlin and the events in Hitler's bunker, preceding Der letzte Akt by five years.|$|E

50|$|The cost {{of poultry}} farming has increased, while {{the cost to}} {{consumers}} has gone down due <b>to</b> <b>fears</b> <b>from</b> H5N1 driving demand below supply, resulting in devastating losses for many poultry farmers. Poor poultry farmers can't afford mandated measures keeping their bird livestock from contact with wild birds (and other measures) thus risking losing their livelihood altogether.

25|$|During the 17th century, {{adherents of}} Roman Catholicism tended to {{diminish}} since {{only a few}} could afford the penalties exacted by the government.

In the Civil War the recusants were firmly of Royalist sympathies since they had more <b>to</b> <b>fear</b> <b>from</b> a Parliament opposed to prelacy and popery.

Mary Margaret and David run up to Emma to hug her, while Henry runs to Regina and hugs both her and Emma. As Neal begins to wake up, David tells Mary Margaret to forget what happened under the curse, then the couple kiss. Finally, Gold checks on Belle as she is sleeping, when Hook arrived to the pawnshop and tells him Henry got away. Gold asks how he failed at kidnapping a child, only to have Hook respond to that answer by saying his heart wasn't in it. Since Gold knows that the Snow Queen’s plan failed, he tells Hook it’s his last day on earth. Hook makes a final request as a dying wish to leave Emma {{and the rest of}} Storybrooke intact. Gold says as long as Emma doesn't get in his way, she’ll survive. He says once he steps over the line with his magic, they have nothing <b>to</b> <b>fear</b> <b>from</b> him – but says he can’t make that promise {{for the rest of the}} world.

The aim of the current study was to investigate whether patients with amygdala lesions would also be impaired at detecting <b>fear</b> <b>from</b> briefly presented, backward-masked faces. We found that patients with either left or right temporal lobe excisions were impaired at rating fear intensity in faces, whereas fear detection difficulties were predominantly seen in those who had undergone a left temporal lobectomy. Intriguingly, patients with amygdala damage found it more difficult <b>to</b> recognize <b>fear</b> <b>from</b> faces shown for unlimited durations than <b>to</b> detect <b>fear</b> <b>from</b> briefly presented faces. Moreover, there was little overlap between impairments of fear detection and fear-rating, indicating that task demands are crucially important in determining fear-processing deficits. 9 page(s...|$|R

[...] He {{said that}} [...] "the gains to {{be derived from}} denying [...] {{immunity}} from suit for breach of that duty substantially exceed whatever loss might be thought likely to result from this", since a potential liability would lead to a [...] "sharpened awareness of the risks of pitching their initial views of the merits of their client’s case too high or too inflexibly lest these views come to expose and embarrass them at a later date."

Lord Collins, agreeing, noted that the result did not affect the position of the expert vis-a-vis the opposing litigant, where there were [...] "wider considerations of policy" [...] against allowing claims. He also remarked that the existing ability to prosecute expert witnesses for perjury or to take disciplinary proceedings against them for unprofessional conduct in preparing or presenting their evidence did not fit with the claim that a liability to their clients for breach of duty would have a chilling effect on experts' willingness to give evidence.
