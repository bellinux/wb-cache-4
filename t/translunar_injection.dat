50|$|Stafford was {{the lead}} {{member of the group}} which helped {{formulate}} the sequence of missions leading to the first lunar landing mission.

50|$|The Proton-K/D {{launcher}} put {{the spacecraft}} into Earth parking orbit followed by <b>translunar</b> <b>injection.</b> On January 12, 1973 Luna 21 was braked into a 90 by 100 km (56 by 62 mile) lunar orbit. On January 13 and 14, the perilune was lowered to 16 km altitude.|$|E
50|$|The N1/L3 {{launch vehicle}} had three stages to Earth orbit, a fourth stage for Earth departure, and a fifth stage for lunar landing assist.

5000|$|The S-IVB (sometimes S-4B, always {{pronounced}} [...] "ess four bee") {{was built}} by the Douglas Aircraft Company and served as the third stage on the Saturn V and second stage on the Saturn IB.

50|$|The early Surveyor {{missions}} {{were planned}} to launch with a direct-ascent trajectory to the Moon, rather than insertion from a parking orbit. <b>Translunar</b> <b>injection</b> {{would then be}} before spacecraft rise at DSS 51 or 61. To obtain the early trajectory data vital for mid-course corrections, a new station with a small and fast-moving antenna was built on Ascension Island and became DSS 72.

50|$|During Apollo 11, {{a typical}} lunar mission, {{the third stage}} burned for about 2.5 minutes until first cutoff at 11 minutes 40 seconds. At this point it was 1430 nmi km {{downrange}} and in a parking orbit {{at an altitude of}} 103.2 nmi km and velocity of 17,432 mph (7,793 m/s). The third stage remained attached to the spacecraft while it orbited the Earth one and a half times while astronauts and mission controllers prepared for <b>translunar</b> <b>injection</b> (TLI).|$|E
50|$|Unlike most liquid-fueled rocket {{engines in}} {{service at the}} time, the J-2 was {{designed}} to be restarted once after shutdown when flown on the Saturn V S-IVB third stage. The first burn, lasting about two minutes, placed the Apollo spacecraft into a low Earth parking orbit. After the crew verified that the spacecraft was operating nominally, the J-2 was re-ignited for <b>translunar</b> <b>injection,</b> a 6.5 minute burn which accelerated the vehicle to a course for the Moon.|$|E
50|$|Block 1, {{scheduled}} to fly Exploration Mission 1 (EM-1) in 2019, {{will use the}} Interim Cryogenic Propulsion Stage (ICPS). This stage will be a modified Delta IV 5-meter Delta Cryogenic Second Stage (DCSS), and will be powered by a single RL10B-2. Block 1 will be capable of lifting 70 t in this configuration, however the ICPS will be {{considered part of the}} payload and be placed into an initial 1,800 km by 93 km suborbital trajectory to ensure safe disposal of the core stage. ICPS will perform an orbital insertion burn at apogee, and then a <b>translunar</b> <b>injection</b> burn to send the uncrewed Orion on a circumlunar excursion.|$|E

5000|$|After liftoff, Chang'e 1 {{made three}} orbits around the Earth, a burn at perigee {{extending}} the orbit's apogee further each time, until a final <b>translunar</b> <b>injection</b> burn {{placed it on}} course for the Moon on October 31, 2007. Another burn placed it in a polar orbit around the Moon, with burns at the periselenium {{of the first three}} orbits decreasing the aposelenium until it entered a final circular orbit. Lunar orbit insertion was achieved on the November 5, 2007. To mark this occasion, the probe transmitted 30 classical Chinese songs and musical pieces, including [...] "My Motherland", [...] "The Song of the Yangtze River", and [...] "High Mountains and Flowing Water".|$|E
50|$|The Block I {{configuration}} of SLS {{will have the}} ability to insert 70 metric tons into low Earth orbit (LEO) using Shuttle-derived 5-segment Solid Rocket Boosters and a core stage powered by four RS-25 engines. Its second stage, the ICPS, will be considered part of the 70 t payload and on EM-1 it will be placed, along with the Orion crew capsule, on a 1,800 km by -93 km suborbital trajectory to ensure safe disposal of the core stage. At apogee, the ICPS will perform an insertion burn to raise the perigee and put itself and Orion into a stable orbit, and will later perform a <b>translunar</b> <b>injection</b> burn to send the uncrewed Orion capsule on a circumlunar excursion.|$|E
50|$|The N1 was a {{very large}} rocket, {{standing}} 105 m tall with its L3 payload. The N1-L3 consisted of five stages in total: the first three (N1) for insertion into a low Earth parking orbit, and another two (L3) for <b>translunar</b> <b>injection</b> and lunar orbit insertion. Fully loaded and fueled, the N1-L3 weighed 2750 t. The lower three stages were shaped to produce a single frustum 17 m wide at the base, while the L3 section was mostly cylindrical, carried inside a shroud 3.5 m (estimated) wide. The conical shaping of the lower stages {{was due to the}} arrangement of the tanks within, a smaller spherical kerosene tank on top of the larger liquid oxygen tank below.|$|E
5000|$|Saturn V launch {{vehicles}} and flights were designated with an AS-500 series number, [...] "AS" [...] indicating [...] "Apollo Saturn" [...] and the [...] "5" [...] indicating Saturn V. The three-stage Saturn V {{was designed to}} send a fully fueled CSM and LM to the Moon. It was 33 ft in diameter and stood 363 ft tall with its 96800 lb lunar payload. Its capability grew to 103600 lb for the later advanced lunar landings. The S-IC first stage burned RP-1/LOX for a rated thrust of 7500000 lbf kN, which was upgraded to 7610000 lbf kN. The second and third stages burned liquid hydrogen, and the third stage was {{a modified version of}} the S-IVB, with thrust increased to 230000 lbf kN and capability to restart the engine for <b>translunar</b> <b>injection</b> after reaching a parking orbit.|$|E
50|$|The first stage, Block A, was {{powered by}} 30 NK-15 engines {{arranged}} in two rings, the main ring of 24 at {{the outer edge}} of the booster and the core propulsion system consisting of the inner 6 engines at about half diameter. The engines were the first ever staged combustion cycle engines. The control system was primarily based on differential throttling of the engines of the outer ring for pitch and yaw. The core propulsion system was not used for control. The Block A also included four grid fins, which were later used on Soviet air-to-air missile designs. In total, the Block A produced 45400 kN of thrust. This exceeded the 33700 kN thrust of the Saturn V. The Saturn V used higher-specific impulse liquid hydrogen fuel in the second and third stages, which eliminated one of the stages needed to get to <b>translunar</b> <b>injection,</b> thus saving weight.|$|E

50|$|Luna 21 {{carried the}} second {{successful}} Soviet lunar rover, Lunokhod 2, and was launched {{less than a}} month after the last Apollo lunar landing. The Proton-K/D launcher put the spacecraft into Earth parking orbit followed by <b>translunar</b> <b>injection.</b> On 12 January 1973, Luna 21 was braked into a 90 × 100 km orbit about the Moon, at a 60° inclination. On 13 and 14 January, the perilune was lowered to 16 km altitude. On 15 January after 40 orbits, the braking rocket was fired at 16 km altitude, and the craft went into free fall. At an altitude of 750 meters the main thrusters began firing, slowing the fall until a height of 22 meters was reached. At this point the main thrusters shut down and the secondary thrusters ignited, slowing the fall until the lander was 1.5 meters above the surface, where the engine was cut off. Landing occurred at 23:35 UT in Le Monnier crater at 25.85° N, 30.45° E, between Mare Serenitatis ("Sea of Serenity") and the Taurus Mountains. The lander carried a bas relief of Vladimir Lenin and the Soviet coat-of-arms.|$|E

50|$|Shortly after Atlas BECO and staging, {{an ominous}} {{development}} occurred when telemetry {{indicated that the}} telemetry for the TV camera on Ranger 6 had turned itself on and then back off again 67 seconds later. Telemetry data showed everything else appear to function normally and tensions at JPL eased. The Agena placed the probe into parking orbit and then fired for <b>translunar</b> <b>injection</b> 25 minutes after launch. After separation of Ranger 6, the solar panels and high-gain antenna were extended and all appeared normal. The launch vehicle had placed the probe on an accurate enough flight path that only a short midcourse correction burn would be required. However, the activation of the TV camera telemetry during launch remained a cause for concern. JPL technicians wanted to turn the camera on to verify its operability, however they were running the risk {{of not being able}} to turn it off again if an electrical short had indeed occurred somewhere. Since the camera had its own batteries and did not use the probe's main power bus, they would be depleted before it could get to the Moon and eliminate any chance of returning pictures. They decided that it was not worth compromising the mission and the camera would not be touched until descent to the Moon began.|$|E
