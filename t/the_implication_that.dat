5|$|It {{has been}} {{highlighted}} that this elevation of principles of natural justice to constitutional status, with <b>the</b> <b>implication</b> <b>that</b> they may override local statutes {{due to the}} supremacy of the Constitution over them, creates some tension with Article 38 which vests the law-making power of Singapore in the legislature.|$|E
5|$|Developmental biology can {{identify}} homologous structures that {{arose from the}} same tissue in embryogenesis. For example, adult snakes have no legs, but their early embryos have limb-buds for hind legs, which are soon lost as the embryos develop. <b>The</b> <b>implication</b> <b>that</b> the ancestors of snakes had hind legs is confirmed by fossil evidence: the Cretaceous snake Pachyrhachis problematicus had hind legs complete with hip bones (ilium, pubis, ischium), thigh bone (femur), leg bones (tibia, fibula) and foot bones (calcaneum, astragalus) as in tetrapods with legs today.|$|E
5|$|For Lord Charlemont, Hogarth {{chose to}} paint the satirical Piquet, or Virtue in Danger (also known as The Lady's Last Stake, after a 1708 play by Colley Cibber), which, with echoes of Marriage à-la-Mode, shows an army officer {{offering}} an aristocratic lady a chance to recover the fortune she has just lost by gambling (with <b>the</b> <b>implication</b> <b>that</b> if she loses again, {{she will have to}} take him as her lover). After Grosvenor saw this painting in Hogarth's studio in 1758, he asked Hogarth to paint a picture for him as well, under the same terms.|$|E

5|$|In QFT, {{the demand}} for {{relativistic}} invariance enters, among other ways in that the S-matrix necessarily must be Poincaré invariant. This has <b>the</b> <b>implication</b> <b>that</b> there is one or more infinite-dimensional representation of the Lorentz group acting on Fock space. One way to guarantee {{the existence of such}} representations is the existence of a Lagrangian description (with modest requirements imposed, see the reference) of the system using the canonical formalism, from which a realization of the generators of the Lorentz group may be deduced.|$|E
5|$|After {{several years}} of {{comparatively}} weak government under the Articles of Confederation, a Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia proposed a new constitution on September 17, 1787, featuring a stronger chief executive and other changes. George Mason, a Constitutional Convention delegate and the drafter of Virginia's Declaration of Rights, proposed that {{a bill of rights}} listing and guaranteeing civil liberties be included. Other delegatesincluding future Bill of Rights drafter James Madisondisagreed, arguing that existing state guarantees of civil liberties were sufficient and that any attempt to enumerate individual rights risked <b>the</b> <b>implication</b> <b>that</b> other, unnamed rights were unprotected. After a brief debate, Mason's proposal was defeated by a unanimous vote of the state delegations.|$|E
5|$|Money is {{important}} throughout the film. Concerns about money dominate {{much of the}} film—for example, a large portion is devoted to Wei and her students' attempt to earn enough money for bus tickets—as well as motivating them. Most major characters, including Wei, demand payment for their actions, and it is left unclear whether Wei's search for Zhang Huike is motivated by altruism or {{by the promise of}} a 10-yuan bonus. Zhu Ying points out the prominence of money in the film creates a conflict between traditional Confucian values (such as <b>the</b> <b>implication</b> <b>that</b> the solutions to Wei's problems can be found through the help of authority figures) and modern, capitalist and individualistic society.|$|E
25|$|This East-West {{religious}} distinction, just as {{with the}} East-West culture distinction, and <b>the</b> <b>implications</b> <b>that</b> arise from it, are broad and not precise. Furthermore, the geographical distinction has less meaning in the current context of global transculturation.|$|R

5|$|In the 1998 storyline {{where he}} fakes dissociative {{identity}} disorder (split personalities) to avoid a prison sentence for hostage and threat charges, he is given four personalities that represent his core being: A childlike personality named Tom, Italian playboy Rod, parental figure Miss Perkins, and the abusive Pete (the personality responsible for his worst misdeeds). The revelation that he is faking the personalities devastates Viki, who had actually suffered from the disorder; it also brings out remorse in Todd, and causes him to reflect on his mistakes. The storyline ends with <b>the</b> <b>implication</b> <b>that</b> the personalities {{may not have been}} as fabricated as Todd believed them to be. The writers also made it so that his difficulties are manifested in his nightmares, which give him insomnia and are designed as a look into his psyche; at multiple points within the series, Téa attempts to help Todd by encouraging him to open up to her about them, which he eventually does. His opinions on his enemies are conveyed clearly; he remains one step ahead of them, and consistently out-smarts police, family, and others he targets, sometimes using weapons.|$|E
5|$|The name Masoandrotsiroa (Masoandro) {{was given}} {{to a series of}} {{buildings}} on the Rova grounds. The original Masoandro {{was one of the first}} three residences built by the Rova's founder, Andrianjaka, in the early 17th century, and over time it became the house reserved for occupation by a new sovereign immediately following coronation. This same Masoandro or a restored version of it was still standing on the Rova grounds and occupied by one of Andrianampoinimerina's wives two hundred years later. However, historic sources offer seemingly contradictory or incomplete accounts of the fate of this historic building. A Masoandro was said to have been relocated from the Rova to Ambohimanga by RanavalonaI. Another source states that Masoandro was demolished at the Rova by RanavalonaII and replaced by a house in brick, only to be demolished again by RanavalonaIII. This last sovereign of Madagascar sought to build a new brick palace, also called Masoandro, with four square corner towers and a higher central tower modelled on the French Residence of Antananarivo. Work began in 1893 but was interrupted by war with France in 1895. The brick foundations of this unfinished Masoandro are still visible today. Still another source states that Masoandro was one of three traditional wooden houses still standing at the Rova when Madagascar was colonised by the French, with <b>the</b> <b>implication</b> <b>that</b> the name was applied to distinct buildings at various times.|$|E
25|$|Chen's and the Democratic Progressive Party {{position}} on Taiwan's political status is that Taiwan is already an independent, sovereign nation named the Republic of China. This has <b>the</b> <b>implication</b> <b>that</b> {{a declaration of}} independence is unnecessary as Taiwan is already independent. This view point, however, is subject to change in each election campaign. At the same time, it also has <b>the</b> <b>implication</b> <b>that</b> the pledge by Chen to preserve the status quo or not change Taiwan's sovereign status would not preclude a declaration of independence but would preclude acceptance of the one China policy.|$|E
50|$|The ADA {{was granted}} leave by the High Court of Australia to {{intervene}} {{as a friend}} of the court. The ADA’s submissions outlined the importance of public interest considerations and <b>the</b> <b>implications</b> <b>that</b> this case could have on copyright users.|$|R

25|$|Another {{topic of}} debate is <b>the</b> <b>implication</b> <b>that</b> Determinism has on morality. Hard {{determinism}} (a belief in determinism, and not free will) is particularly criticized for seeming to make traditional moral judgments impossible. Some philosophers, however, find this an acceptable conclusion.|$|E
25|$|The {{narrative}} Remote Perfect {{is typically}} {{used for the}} action in novels and short stories and in narratives such as the 1998 Bible translation.

25|$|It was {{especially}} {{during this time}} that African Americans began forming their own churches, {{in part because of}} the unequal treatment they were facing in integrated churches in both the North and the South.

25|$|Another {{figure that}} was highly {{regarded}} {{during the period}} was Jean Price-Mars. He associated the reasons behind the Occupation to the division between the Haitian elite and the poorer people of the country. He noted that the groups were divided over the practice of Vodou, with <b>the</b> <b>implication</b> <b>that</b> the elites did not recognize Vodou because they connected it to an evil practice.|$|E
25|$|Pauline Christianity is a {{term used}} to refer to a branch of Early Christianity {{associated}} with the beliefs and doctrines espoused by Paul the Apostle through his writings. The term is generally considered a pejorative by some who believe it carries <b>the</b> <b>implication</b> <b>that</b> Christianity as it is known is a corruption of the original teachings of Jesus, as in the doctrine of the Great Apostasy.|$|E
25|$|An {{example of}} the process {{imagined}} by the writers is given when the character Nog, the first Ferengi to do so, attempts {{to apply to the}} Academy. He is told that since he is from a non-member world (Ferenginar), he requires a letter of recommendation from a command-level officer before his application can be considered, with <b>the</b> <b>implication</b> <b>that</b> this is the standard procedure for all non-Federation applicants to Starfleet.|$|E
50|$|Temptation is {{measured}} through indirect and implicit methods.

25|$|Darwin {{published}} {{his theory of}} evolution by natural selection in On the Origin of Species in 1859. His theory means that all life, including humanity, {{is a product of}} continuing natural processes. <b>The</b> <b>implication</b> <b>that</b> all life on Earth has a common ancestor has met with objections from some religious groups. Their objections are in contrast to the level of support for the theory by more than 99 percent of those within the scientific community today.|$|E
25|$|He {{took part}} in the famous 1860 debate {{concerning}} evolution {{at a meeting of the}} British Association on 30 June. Richard Owen and Thomas Henry Huxley had already clashed on man's position in nature two days previously; on the Saturday, at the Oxford University Museum of Natural History, Wilberforce got his chance to criticise Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species by means of Natural Selection, especially <b>the</b> <b>implication</b> <b>that</b> humans and various species of apes share common ancestors.|$|E
25|$|Much {{reference}} {{has been}} made in the literature (both lay and professional) of the structural kinship of synephrine with ephedrine, or with phenylephrine, often with <b>the</b> <b>implication</b> <b>that</b> the perceived similarities in structure should result in similarities in pharmacological properties. However, from a chemical perspective, synephrine is also related to {{a very large number of}} other drugs whose structures are based on the phenethylamine skeleton, and although some properties are common, others are not, making unqualified comparisons and generalizations inappropriate.|$|E
