500|$|Writer Holly Harold {{noted that}} the {{introduction}} of Green Arrow (Justin Hartley) allowed Clark to mature more in the sixth season. Clark {{was able to see}} how others achieved the same goals, but used alternative routes that perhaps crossed moral lines. This taught Clark <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> things from his opponents' perspectives. Ultimately, in season six Clark learned it would be his human side that allowed him to become the hero he needed to be, summed up by writer Turi Meyer as [...] "... soon-to-be Man of Steel". Each season, Clark gained insight into how not to misuse his abilities from the kryptonite-mutated villains that used them for crime. In later seasons, Clark saw how even those that used their abilities for good might still have questionable actions, specifically Arthur Curry (Alan Ritchson) and Andrea Rojas (Denise Quiñones), though Clark did help them take the high road. Those episodes reiterated the effect Clark's parents had on how he used his abilities. Clark also learned that he cannot do everything alone, even though he chose not to join Oliver's team of superheroes {{at the end of the}} episode [...] "Justice". For Meyer, season six showed that Clark was still struggling to accept his destiny, but did take steps toward the day that he would put on the cape and become Superman.|$|E

40|$|There {{is little}} doubt that the use of robots in {{introductory}} classes is an effective way to spark an initial interest in Computer Science and recruit students into our classes, and subsequently recruit some of them as Computer Science majors.

5000|$|Another {{interesting}} line {{of research}} looks at how people identify positively or negatively with certain issues. One relevant idea {{is the notion of}} [...] "consistency attitudes". Studies have shown that people tend to take a good association they have, and then use this to make positive or negative links with other, related things. For example, if someone thinks {{it is a good idea}} to protect old Pacific forests, this will positively form a link to also want to protect smaller forests and even grasslands. [...] This same line of thinking can cause someone who supports the protection of old Pacific forests <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>thinking</b> negatively <b>about</b> the creation of more logging roads. Other studies on consistency attitudes have shown that, with one particular issue, people like to align their preferences with each other. This has been shown repeatedly while looking at political ideologies and racial attitudes, and studies have shown that this can also include environmental issues. [...] Finally, other studies have shown that how people identify an ecosystem geographically can affect their concern for it. [...] For instance, when people think of saving the rainforests, they often think of this as a global problem and support it more readily. However, lesser known but still significant local ecosystems remain ignored and unprotected.|$|R
40|$|This article {{presents}} a critical reflection and a synthesis on {{the links between}} European policies aimed at promoting plurilinguism and the Intercomprehension approach, 25 years after its first appearance in the languages teaching environment. In particular, it focuses on Italy’s role in different Intercomprehension projects that have emerged and on how Italy promotes this new approach. The European Union set a target whereby all European citizens should speak two foreign languages in addition to mother tongues. This poses the challenge of which languages to choose both within European Institutions and within the educational systems. Moreover it leads to reconsider the place traditionally assigned to English. This European target remains far from being achieved, {{as demonstrated by the}} Eurobarometro polls. Against this background, the Intercomprehension solution still offers a credible option that could be extremely powerful if it were to be rigorously applied on a large scale, as we try to demonstrate. In fact, this approach respects the variety of languages and cultures by considering them within their linguistic families. It is a simple, time-effective and flexible approach for multiple audiences. An examination of the case of Italy allows one to observe how a new dynamic can emerge by participating in several European projects and how it is possible <b>to</b> slowly <b>start</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> a set of different actions that would help achieve the objective of European plurilinguism...|$|R
40|$|A {{need for}} {{systematic}} integration {{and support for}} sessional staff {{has been identified as}} an issue in Australian higher education. Current research highlights a need for significant change in the professional development of sessional staff but also the role of the subject/unit coordinator (called the coordinator) in leading this change. Whilst many institutions conduct valuable generic or discipline-specific induction, teaching expertise development may be best done in conjunction with development of a collegial network by co-ordinators at the subject level. This ALTC funded professional development initiative, Coordinators Leading Advancement of Sessional Staff (CLASS), was implemented in four Australian universities in 2010. A workshop program for subject coordinators that focused on their leadership roles prepared them to implement a subject-based action learning activity with their teaching teams. An academic developer supported the initiative and facilitated reflection {{and the development of a}} cross-disciplinary community of practice. This showcase provides examples from the Subject Coordinator led initiatives plus feedback from the national road show. Resources will also be made available for wider implementation. Significant organisational change happens over a longer period than the two years of the funded project.
