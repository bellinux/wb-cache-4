5|$|Concerns {{about the}} {{destruction}} of the Quino checkerspot butterfly were raised by the community group Preserve South Bay. That group sued the developer as well as Caltrans and SANDAG in August 1999, following the latter's approval for the project. Early the next year, an environmental impact report suggested that Bonita might face negative effects from the freeway, such as noise and having the roadway divide the community. The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) allowed the project that year, even though the Environmental Protection Agency objected <b>to</b> <b>it.</b> <b>A</b> contractor for the project was soon retained by California Transportation Ventures. Another group, Citizens for 125, obtained 7,000 signatures in support of the road.|$|E
5|$|Further {{methods of}} {{identification}} are chemical tests. With {{the application of}} FeSO4 to the cap cuticle (pileipellis), it will turn a dark grey, almost black color and with the application of potassium hydroxide or NH4OH it has a negative coloration. The context stains a bluish grey to an olive green when FeSO4 is applied <b>to</b> <b>it,</b> <b>a</b> pale orange to a pale yellow with the application of KOH, and negative with the application of NH4OH.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, a {{security}} system at a scrap metal yard, {{which had been}} repeatedly burglarized, went off. The yard's owner {{was at the time}} on a hunt close to the yard and drove directly <b>to</b> <b>it.</b> <b>A</b> group of burglars jumped into their car and attempted to drive away. The owner used his shotgun and attempted to shoot the car's tires, hitting and wounding two of its occupants. He was sentenced to 6 years imprisonment for intentional infliction of bodily harm, a sentence that was confirmed on appeal. The owner received full presidential pardon.|$|E

5|$|In {{the valley}} temple of Menkaure, Nyuserre {{extended}} the eastern annex, where he added {{two sets of}} alabaster columns, rebuilt the main entrance and refurbished the limestone causeway leading from the valley temple to the high temple. There, Mark Lehner suggested that Nyuserre expanded the inner part of the high temple, notably adding <b>to</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> square antechamber with a single central pillar.|$|E
5|$|We {{all have}} a Land of Beyond to seek in our life—what more can we ask?

Rooted deep in the nature of every one of us is the spirit of adventure, the call of the wild—vibrating under all our actions, making life deeper and higher and nobler.|$|E
5|$|At {{some point}} the Seljuks or their Arab allies lost al-Rahba, but in 1093 the Seljuk ruler of Damascus, Tutush {{captured}} it along with several other Upper Mesopotamian towns. Following his death, possession of al-Rahba reverted to the Uqaylids, but in 1096, Karbuqa of al-Hillah captured and looted the town. He held onto it until 1102 when Qaymaz, a former mamluk (slave soldier) of the Seljuk sultan Alp Arslan, took control of it. Tutush's son Duqaq and the latter's deputy Tughtakin besieged the town, but failed to capture it. Qaymaz died in December 1102 and al-Rahba passed {{to one of his}} Turkish mamluks named Hasan, who dismissed many of Qaymaz's officers and arrested several of al-Rahba's notables due to suspicions of a coup against him. Duqaq renewed the siege, but this time was welcomed in by al-Rahba's townspeople, forcing Hasan to retreat into the citadel. Hasan surrendered after receiving guarantees of safe passage from Duqaq as well as an iqta (fief) elsewhere in Syria. According to the 12th-century chronicler Ibn al-Athir, al-Rahba's inhabitants were treated well by Duqaq, who reorganized the administration of the town, established a garrison there, and assigned <b>to</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> governor from the Banu Shayban tribe, Muhammad ibn Sabbak.|$|E

5|$|On {{the right}} flank, {{north of the}} road, the North Koreans overran the {{battalion}} observation post and B Company's outpost line. This high ground changed hands three times during the day. While the infantry fight was in progress, and shortly after the first tank penetration, five more T-34s came around the road bend toward the US 71st Tank Battalion. Check had called for an air strike when the first tanks appeared. Three F-80 Shooting Stars arrived and immediately dived on the approaching group of tanks, destroying three of them with 5-inch rockets. Altogether, bazooka, artillery, and air strikes knocked out six North Korean tanks during the morning, either within or {{on the edge of}} the 1st Battalion position. In its first engagement with American troops, the NK 2nd Division lost all but two of the eight tanks that had been attached <b>to</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> few days earlier at Chongju.|$|E

50|$|Originally {{developed}} {{for use as}} a floor in anechoic chambers, this style of catwalk is popular in new and remodeled theatres due <b>to</b> the flexibility <b>it</b> provides.

50|$|Famprofazone (Gewodin, Gewolen) is a nonsteroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} agent (NSAID) of the pyrazolone series {{which is}} available over-the-counter in some countries such as Taiwan. It has analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antipyretic effects. Famprofazone {{has been known to}} produce methamphetamine as an active metabolite, with 15-20% of an oral dose being converted <b>to</b> <b>it.</b> <b>As</b> a result, famprofazone has occasionally been implicated in causing positives on drug tests for amphetamines.|$|R
