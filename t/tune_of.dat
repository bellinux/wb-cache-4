In the course of the game, Link learns three tunes to play on the harp. The <b>Tune</b> <b>of</b> Echoes activates Time Portals at fixed locations; the <b>Tune</b> <b>of</b> Currents enables Link to travel from the past to the present without a Time Portal; the <b>Tune</b> <b>of</b> Ages allows Link to switch between the two time periods at almost any location on the map.|$|E

5000|$|The German word Stimmung [...] {{has several}} meanings, {{including}} [...] "tuning" [...] and [...] "mood". The word is the noun formed from the verb stimmen, which means [...] "to harmonize, to be correct", {{and related to}} Stimme (voice). The primary sense of the title [...] "implies not only the outward <b>tuning</b> <b>of</b> voices or instruments, but also the inward <b>tuning</b> <b>of</b> one's soul" [...] According to the composer, the word [...] means [...] "tuning," [...] but it really should be translated with many other words because Stimmung incorporates the meanings <b>of</b> the <b>tuning</b> <b>of</b> a piano, the <b>tuning</b> <b>of</b> the voice, the <b>tuning</b> <b>of</b> a group <b>of</b> people, the <b>tuning</b> <b>of</b> the soul. This is all in the German word. Also, when you say: We're in a good Stimmung, you mean a good psychological tuning, being well tuned together.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—A novel {{approach}} to fuzzy modeling {{based on the}} <b>tuning</b> <b>of</b> parametric conjunction operations is proposed. First, some novel methods {{for the construction of}} parametric generalized conjunction operations simpler than the known parametric classes of conjunctions are considered and discussed. Second, several examples of function approximation by fuzzy models, based on the <b>tuning</b> <b>of</b> the parameters of the new conjunction operations, are given and their approximation performances are compared with the approaches based on a <b>tuning</b> <b>of</b> membership functions and other approaches proposed in the literature. It is seen that the <b>tuning</b> <b>of</b> the conjunction operations can be used for obtaining fuzzy models with a sufficiently good performance when the <b>tuning</b> <b>of</b> membership functions is not possible or not desirable.

5|$|Bach {{structured}} the cantata in six movements. The {{text and}} <b>tune</b> <b>of</b> the hymn {{are kept in}} the outer choral movements, a chorale fantasia and a four-part closing chorale, which frame a sequence of alternating recitatives and arias. Bach scored the work for three vocal soloists (soprano (S), tenor (T) and bass (B)), a four-part choir, and a Baroque instrumental ensemble of two horns (Co), two oboes da caccia (Oc), two violins (Vl), two obbligato violins (Vs), viola (Va) and basso continuo. A festive scoring like this, including brass, was usually performed on holidays. The duration of the cantata is given as 25 minutes.|$|E
5|$|Bach {{structured}} the cantata in six movements. The {{text and}} <b>tune</b> <b>of</b> the hymn are {{retained in the}} outer choral movements, a chorale fantasia and a four-part closing chorale, which frame two sets of recitative and aria. Bach scored the work for four vocal soloists (soprano, alto, tenor, bass), a four-part choir, and a Baroque instrumental ensemble of four trombones (Tb), two oboes (Ob), two violins (Vl), viola (Va) and basso continuo. This {{is one of three}} Bach cantatas to use four different trombone parts (soprano, alto, tenor, and bass), the others being Ach Gott, vom Himmel sieh darein, BWV 2 and Ich hatte viel Bekümmernis, BWV 21. The instruments play colla parte with the voices in the outer movements in the style of Bach's motets.|$|E
5|$|Ketèlbey's {{popularity}} {{began to}} wane during the Second World War and his originality also declined; {{many of his}} post-war works were re-workings of older pieces and he increasingly found his music ignored by the BBC. In 1949 {{he moved to the}} Isle of Wight, where he spent his retirement, and he died at home in obscurity. His work has been reappraised since his death; in a 2003 poll by the BBC radio programme Your Hundred Best Tunes, Bells Across the Meadows was voted the 36th most popular <b>tune</b> <b>of</b> all time and the last night of the 2009 Proms season marked the fiftieth anniversary of Ketèlbey's death—the first time his music had been included in the festival's finale.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the bailout}} support {{programme}} feature sufficient financial transfers until March 2016, Cyprus began slowly to regain its {{access to the}} private lending markets already in June 2014. At this point of time, the government sold €0.75bn of bonds with a five-year maturity, to the <b>tune</b> <b>of</b> a 4.85% yield. A continued selling of bonds with a ten-year maturity, which would equal a regain of complete access to the private lending market (and {{mark the end of}} the era with need for bailout support), is expected to happen sometime in 2015. The Cypriot minister of finance recently confirmed, that the government plan to issue two new European Medium Term Note (EMTN) bonds in 2015, likely shortly ahead of the expiry of another €1.1bn bond on 1 July and a second expiry of a €0.9bn bond on 1 November. As announced in advance, the Cypriot government issued €1bn of seven-year bonds with a 4.0% yield by the end of April 2015.|$|E
5|$|Billy Boys {{originated}} in the 1920s as the signature <b>tune</b> <b>of</b> the Brigton Boys, also called The Billy Boys of Brigton Cross, who were a Protestant street gang in the Bridgeton area of Glasgow, led by Billy Fullerton. The gang often clashed with Roman Catholic gangs such as the Norman Conks. Fullerton was {{a former member of}} the British Fascists who was awarded a medal for strike-breaking during the 1926 General Strike and formed a Glasgow branch of the British Union of Fascists with the onset of World War II. The song's geographic roots relate to Bridgeton Cross in Bridgeton, an area of Glasgow historically associated with the city's Protestant population, and with Scottish unionism. Brigton is the Scots form of Bridgeton. The Billy Boys song was often sung loudly when the gang performed it. They regularly sang it when they marched through primarily Catholic areas of Glasgow on Catholic holy days. This often led to the Brigton Boys being attacked by members of the Norman Conks as a result. Despite being primarily based in Glasgow, in the 1930s the Brigton Boys were invited to march in Belfast and sang Billy Boys while they were there as part of The Twelfth celebrations.|$|E
40|$|A key {{concept in}} the {{emerging}} field of spintronics is the gate voltage or electric field control of spin precession via the effective magnetic field generated by the Rashba spin orbit interaction. Here, we demonstrate the generation and <b>tuning</b> <b>of</b> electric field induced Rashba spin orbit interaction in InAs nanowires where a strong electric field is created either by a double gate or a solid electrolyte surrounding gate.
