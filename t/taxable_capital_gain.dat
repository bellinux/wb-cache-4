40|$|Investments with exit {{flexibility}} require {{decisions regarding}} both the investment and holding period. Because selling an investment {{often leads to}} <b>taxable</b> <b>capital</b> <b>gains,</b> which crucially depend on the duration of an investment, we investigate the impact of <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> taxation on exit timing under different tax systems. We observed that <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> taxation delays exit decisions but loses its decision relevance for very long holdings. Often the optimal exit time, which indicates the maximal present value of future cashflows, cannot be determined analytically. However, we identify the breakeven exit time that guarantees present values exceeding those of an immediate sale. While, after-taxes, an immediate sale is often optimal, long holding periods might also be attractive for investors depending {{on the degree of}} income and corporate tax integration. A classic corporate tax system often indicates holdings over more than 100 periods. By contrast, a shareholder relief system indicates the earliest breakeven exit time and thus the highest level of exit timing flexibility. Surprisingly, high retention rates are likely to accelerate sales under a classic corporate system. Additionally, the worst exit time, which should be avoided by investors, differs tremendously across tax systems. For an integrated tax system with full imputation, the worst time is reached earlier than under partial or non-integrated systems. These results could help to predict investors' behavior regarding changes in <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> taxation and thus are of interest for both investors and tax policymakers. Furthermore, the results emphasize the need to control for the underlying tax system in cross-country empirical studies.

40|$|LL. M. (Tax Law) <b>Capital</b> <b>Gains</b> Tax (“CGT”) was {{introduced}} {{with effect from}} 1 October 2001 by the insertion of section 26 A and an Eighth Schedule into the Income Tax Act 58 of 1962, by the Taxation Laws Amendment Act 5 of 2001. Paragraph 40 (1) of the Eight Schedule provides that a deceased person must, with certain exceptions, be treated as having disposed of his assets to his estate for proceeds equal to {{the market value of}} those assets as at the date of death. Paragraph 40 (1 A) of the Eight Schedule provides that if an asset of a deceased person is treated as having been disposed of under paragraph 40 (1) and is transferred directly to the estate of the deceased person, the estate must be treated as having acquired the asset at a cost equal to its market value as at the date of death for base-cost purposes, and if the asset is transferred directly to an heir or legatee, the heir or legatee must be treated as having acquired the asset at a cost equal to its market value as at the date of death for base-cost purposes. The <b>capital</b> <b>gain</b> will be the difference between the market value of a taxable asset of the deceased on the date of his death and its base cost to him, which is included in his final income tax assessment and which will have to be settled out of the estate‟s assets. There are many arguments in favour of the discontinuance of the levying of CGT at the death of a taxpayer in South Africa, which arguments become evident when comparing the South African CGT provisions regarding the levying of CGT at death with tax jurisdictions such as Australia, the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Botswana and Nigeria. Canada for example abolished their inheritance tax in 1972 which in that particular situation justifies the levying of CGT at death. If CGT will continue to be levied at the death of a taxpayer it is suggested that a carry-over approach in terms of which the heir inherits the asset at its acquisition cost and the CGT liability is deferred until the heir actually disposes of the asset should be followed. This approach is currently followed in Australia, Botswana and Nigeria. The holder of an inherited bare dominium will suffer {{at the hands of a}} CGT anomaly where the deceased created a limited interest, for example a usufruct over a fixed property bequeathed by him to the bare dominium holder. The anomaly that transpires is that the limited interest created by the deceased will result in an artificial drop in the base cost of the fixed property so bequeathed and there will be no adjustment to the base cost when the bare dominium holder succeeds to full ownership of the fixed property, for example when the usufructuary passes away, meaning that the same <b>capital</b> <b>gain</b> will be taxed twice. It is submitted that legislative amendments are required to provide for an increase in the base cost applicable to the bare dominium holder when the usufructuary eventually passes away. Alternatively the SARS‟s current practice in this respect should be altered to avoid the unbearable situation where a <b>capital</b> <b>gain</b> may be taxed at 2 separate instances. At least two anomalies exist when dealing with capital losses in the deceased‟s final period of assessment and in the winding up of the deceased‟s estate. Firstly a capital loss may not be carried forward from the deceased‟s final assessment to his deceased estate to be set off against <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> that may be realised in the winding up of the estate. Secondly a capital loss incurred on the sale of a capital asset during the winding up of a deceased estate cannot be carried over from the deceased estate to the heirs of the deceased and will thus remain unutilised. It is suggested that the method followed in Canada in respect of capital losses that occurred in the year of a taxpayer‟s death should be followed in South Africa, ie that such capital loss may be carried back three years in order to reduce any <b>taxable</b> <b>capital</b> <b>gains</b> that occurred in those years or that the capital losses may be utilised to reduce other income of the taxpayer in his final return. It is further suggested that this method should also be followed in respect of unutilised capital losses that occurred in the winding up of the estate, alternatively the capital losses so realised must be carried over to the heirs of the deceased...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: How do {{dividend}} taxes affect firm {{behavior and}} what are their distributional and efficiency effects? To answer these questions, the first problem is coming up with an explanation for why firms pay dividends, {{in spite of their}} tax penalty. This paper surveys three different models for why firms pay dividends, and then uses each model to examine the behavioral and efficiency effects of dividend taxes. The three models examined are: the “new view, ” an agency cost explanation, and a signaling model. While all three models forecast dividends, their forecasts regarding other firm behavior, and their forecasts for the efficiency and distributional effects of a dividend tax, often differ. Given the evidence to date, we find the agency model is the one most consistent with the data. Under this model, the efficiency effects of a dividend tax largely depend on the difference between the tax rates on dividends and <b>capital</b> <b>gains,</b> with the further complication that agency costs generate too much investment in the corporate sector. The objective {{of this paper is to}} provide an overview of the existing debate about the behavioral and efficiency effects of taxes on dividends. The tax treatment of dividends differs widely across countries and has changed dramatically since 2001 in the U. S. What difference does this make? In order to be in a position to assess how dividend taxes affect behavior and efficiency, we first need to provide an explanation for why firms pay dividends, in spite of their unfavorable tax treatment. Certainly firms need to provide a payoff to their equity holders. But providing this return through dividends has in the past subjected their shareholders to higher tax liabilities than they would face if the funds for example were used instead to repurchase shares in the firm, reinvested in productive assets, or used to acquire other firms, in each case generating income for shareholders that is <b>taxable</b> as <b>capital</b> <b>gains.</b> Section 1 briefly describes this longstanding dividend puzzle...|$|R
