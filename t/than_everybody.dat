25|$|Prevented {{from playing}} {{the first few}} games by injury and unable to contain his {{excessive}} drinking and increasing weight, Richardson declined still more sharply in 1899. Though after returning to the Surrey eleven he produced some impressive performances (notably against Kent at the Oval), Richardson failed to take 100 wickets for the season. As a result, {{he was out of}} the running for Test selection, and the benefit Surrey gave him for his service between 1893 and 1897 was much less lucrative <b>than</b> <b>everybody</b> had hoped despite Surrey winning the Championship.|$|E
500|$|The “biggest” of {{the four}} soldiers, Sam {{is known for his}} child-like personality. He befriends a young Italian boy, Angelo Torancelli, and becomes a father figure to the child. Sam is first to {{discover}} a finely carved statue head, the Head of the Primavera, which he believes to carry magical powers. Miller was a fan of McBride's novel prior to learning of the film adaptation by Lee. He fought hard to win the role of Sam, which resulted in him physically preparing for the part: “My physical prep was a little different <b>than</b> <b>everybody</b> else’s, because Spike wanted me for the movie, but he told me I had to lose weight to do it. I had nine weeks to lose 60 pounds. We got it done.” ...|$|E

500|$|Despite briefly {{considering}} [...] "Easy Target" [...] to {{be released}} as the album's third single, [...] "Down" [...] was released instead. The video for [...] "Down", which features real-life ex-gang members, made its television premiere in June 2004. The single was a mixed success, peaking at number 10 on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart {{during the week of}} July 31, 2004, but quickly falling off afterward. [...] "Always" [...] was announced as the fourth and final single from Blink-182 in August 2004. [...] "It's gonna change people's lives and might actually change the world forever", DeLonge jokingly predicted. After deciding on the video concept, the clip was recorded and released in November 2004 and continued success all the way into January 2005. A fifth single from the album ("All of This") was discussed; however, plans were dropped following the band's declaration of an 'indefinite hiatus' in February 2005. In response to the idea of [...] "All of This" [...] becoming a possible single, DeLonge joked [...] "We would love it because it's a bad-ass song, and The Cure's Robert Smith sings on it, and that makes us cooler <b>than</b> <b>everybody</b> else." ...|$|E
500|$|House {{is often}} filmed using the [...] "walk and talk" [...] filming technique, popularized on {{television}} by series such as St. Elsewhere, ER, Sports Night, and The West Wing. The technique {{involves the use}} of tracking shots, showing two or more characters walking between locations while talking. Executive producer Katie Jacobs said that the show frequently uses the technique because [...] "when you put a scene on the move, it's a... way of creating an urgency and an intensity". She noted the significance of [...] "the fact that Hugh Laurie spans 6'2" [...] and is taller <b>than</b> <b>everybody</b> else because it certainly makes those walk-and-talks pop". Nancy Franklin of The New Yorker described the show's [...] "cool, Fantastic Voyage–like special effects of patients' innards. I'll bet you didn't know that when your kidneys shut down they sound like bubble wrap popping." [...] "Cameras and special effects travel not only down the throat" [...] of one patient, another critic observed, [...] "but up her nose and inside her brain and leg". Instead of relying primarily on computer-generated imagery, the interior body shots tend to involve miniature effects and motion control photography. Many of the sets are dressed with a variety of unscripted props that allow Laurie to physically improvise, revealing aspects of his character and the story.|$|E
500|$|The song's bleak lyrics were {{explained}} by Marker as {{a mockery of}} the angsty [...] " [...] thing" [...] themes prevalent in mid-1990s alternative rock songs, as well as a self-deprecating reference to Garbage's own dark lyrics, with Manson explaining that the song was [...] "a dig at ourselves because we like records that don't make us feel very happy, and at this so-called 'alternative' scene of 'we're so weird and more wonderful <b>than</b> <b>everybody</b> else'". Vig added that [...] "'Only Happy When It Rains' was about what happened with grunge and the angst-filled thing which has dominated the American alternative rock scene. With us there's self-deprecation, we have to poke fun at ourselves because we're so incredibly obsessive about the songs and the lyrics, which makes us filled with self-loathing, hurhur." [...] Garbage said they referenced both the title of The Jesus and Mary Chain song [...] "Happy When It Rains" [...] (1987) and Manson's own Scottish psyche. Lyrically, Manson described [...] "Only Happy When It Rains" [...] as [...] "about wanting love but knowing life will always get in the way.... yet not being obliterated by that. It's a song for people that know {{what it is like to}} live on the dark side of life. It's about devotion but a different kind. A devotion to the truth and to freedom... and to hell with the consequences." ...|$|E

500|$|In June 2014, Christopher Lennertz, who {{composed}} {{the music for}} the Agent Carter One-Shot, talked about potentially working on the series, saying, D'Esposito [...] "told me last summer at Comic-Con {{that there was a}} possibility this was going to become a series. And he said that {{if he was going to}} be involved, he wanted me to be involved, too." [...] In September 2014, Lennertz officially signed on to compose for the series. Lennertz combined all the different style elements of the show in the music, such as mixing jazz and period elements, with orchestra and electronic elements. Lennertz said, the music is [...] "always done from a sense of being sort of in control and savvy and clever, rather than just being strong or just having a superpower or sort of being so much further along than anybody else physically. Part of it was just trying to make it that she's just smarter <b>than</b> <b>everybody</b> else. She's got such command over so many of these situations, and that was the most important thing was to give her that personality."

2500|$|The comedian {{has also}} {{expressed}} discomfort {{with the notion}} that success in standup comedy—or, indeed, in any aspect of the entertainment industry—should oblige him to serve as a role model. In this position, he finds himself directly at odds with one of his comic idols, Bill Cosby. Cosby has reprimanded Rock both explicitly—for his Niggas vs. Black People track—and implicitly, for heavy use of the word [...] "nigger." [...] Rock has not wavered from a position explored in his 1996 Roll With The New show, and reiterated in his 1997 memoir: [...] "Why does the public expect entertainers to behave better <b>than</b> <b>everybody</b> else? It's ridiculous...Of course, this is just for black entertainers. You don't see anyone telling Jerry Seinfeld he's a good role model. Because everyone expects whites to behave themselves...Nowadays, you've got to be an entertainer and a leader. It's too much." [...] Often the subject of tabloids, when asked about paparazzi and the other negative aspects of fame, Rock says he accepts the bad with the good: [...] "You can't be happy that fire cooks your food and be mad it burns your fingertips." ...|$|E
2500|$|From Peterhoff, Maria Pavlovna went to Grand Duchess Elisabeth’s rural estate, Ilinskoe, near Moscow, where Wilhelm {{joined them}} for a month before he left on a cruise to America.

Maria imagined herself in love: “It’s lovely to have somebody, even far away, who love you more than anything and whom you love more <b>than</b> <b>everybody</b> on earth“, she wrote to him. In October, Wilhelm returned to Russia joining Grand Duchess Maria and her brother Dimitri who introduced the Swedish prince to their father, Grand Duke Paul, who was permitted {{to come back to}} Russia for his daughter's wedding set to take place after she turned eighteen the next April. At Wilhelm's departure, Maria wrote to him: [...] " [...] I love you, so much with every day, every hour more and more. I wish it were April now, how lovely it would be". [...] In her book of memoirs, written more than 20 years later, the grand duchess made different claims: [...] " [...] I was using Wilhelm, in a sense, only to obtain my freedom". [...] As the wedding day approached, she began to have doubts and wished to break off the engagement, but Princess Irene of Hesse who was visiting her sister, Grand Duchess Elisabeth Feodorovna, persuaded her otherwise.
