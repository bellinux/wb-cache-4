5|$|Adalimumab {{is a drug}} {{targeting}} TNF alpha. Its name {{can be broken down}} into ada-lim-u-mab. <b>Therefore,</b> <b>the</b> drug is a human monoclonal antibody targeting the immune system. If adalimumab had been named after 2009, it would have been adalumab.|$|E
5|$|After all the {{remainders}} r0, r1, etc. {{have been}} substituted, the final equation expresses g as a linear sum of a and b: g = sa + tb. Bézout's identity, and <b>therefore</b> <b>the</b> previous algorithm, can both {{be generalized to}} the context of Euclidean domains.|$|E
5|$|Allingham overtook George Frederick Ives as {{the longest}} lived {{member of the}} British Armed Forces on 1 November 2007. He was <b>therefore</b> <b>the</b> longest lived British First World War veteran to date.|$|E
2500|$|Opiates {{modulate}} nociception in vertebrates. In vertebrates, morphine is an analgesic and <b>therefore</b> ameliorates <b>the</b> {{sensation of}} pain. [...] Naloxone is an opioid-receptor antagonist and <b>therefore</b> blocks <b>the</b> effects of morphine. [...] Opioid modulation of nociception {{has been demonstrated}} in several invertebrate species.|$|R
30|$|We <b>therefore</b> obtain <b>the</b> {{following}} results.|$|R
30|$|We <b>therefore</b> obtain <b>the</b> {{following}} useful corollary.|$|R
5|$|Among other things, {{the party}} {{supports}} {{the unification of}} South Tyrol (Italy) with Tyrol (Austria), and, <b>therefore,</b> <b>the</b> South Tyrolean secessionist movement, which notably includes its South Tyrolean sister party Die Freiheitlichen.|$|E
5|$|Andrew D. White, {{its first}} president, and Ezra Cornell, {{who gave it}} his name, {{turned out to be}} the {{developers}} of the first American university and <b>therefore</b> <b>the</b> agents of revolutionary curricular reform.|$|E
5|$|Broadcasters {{have had}} to bid {{for the rights to}} host the contest since 2004 to avoid such {{problems}} from happening again. Belgium was <b>therefore</b> <b>the</b> first country to successfully bid for the rights to host the contest in 2005.|$|E
30|$|<b>The</b> {{modulator}} <b>therefore</b> replicates <b>the</b> nonvacuum input model.|$|R
50|$|<b>Therefore</b> if <b>the</b> volume doubles, the {{pressure}} halves.|$|R
5000|$|The fixed-point {{combinator}} fix <b>therefore</b> satisfies <b>the</b> equation: ...|$|R
5|$|For 0<i<n, any mapping from S'i to S'n is {{homotopic}} (i.e., continuously deformable) to {{a constant}} mapping, i.e., a mapping that maps all of S'i {{to a single}} point of S'n. <b>Therefore</b> <b>the</b> homotopy group is the trivial group.|$|E
5|$|Gender {{is one of}} {{the main}} social {{determinants}} of health—which include social, economic, and political factors—that play a major role in the health outcomes of women in India. <b>Therefore,</b> <b>the</b> high level of gender inequality in India negatively impacts the health of women.|$|E
5|$|In 1957, Gold Gloves {{were given}} to the top fielders in Major League Baseball, instead of {{separate}} awards for the National and American Leagues; <b>therefore,</b> <b>the</b> winners are the same in each table.|$|E
50|$|In 2006, as is {{customary}} for {{newly appointed}} High Court Judges, Irwin {{was made a}} Knight Bachelor and <b>therefore</b> granted <b>the</b> title Sir. On 24 October 2016, he was appointed a Member of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom, and <b>therefore</b> granted <b>the</b> style of The Right Honourable.|$|R
30|$|<b>Therefore</b> all <b>the</b> {{conditions}} of Theorem  3.5 are satisfied.|$|R
50|$|One cannot remove consent, <b>therefore,</b> at <b>the</b> seizure stage.|$|R
5|$|Like other Hawaiian honeycreepers, the hookbill {{possessed a}} {{distinctive}} musty odor. The bird's only known vocalization was an inconspicuous chirp; however, all other Hawaiian honeycreepers are excellent vocalists that demonstrate {{an array of}} sounds, and <b>therefore</b> <b>the</b> hookbill likely had a broader, unrecorded repertoire.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{chemistry}} {{has been observed}} only {{for the first three}} members of the group 12. The chemistry of copernicium is not well established and <b>therefore</b> <b>the</b> rest of the section deals only with zinc, cadmium and mercury.|$|E
5|$|Mummification on the Canary Islands {{during the}} Guanche period {{remained}} confined to Tenerife, Gran Canaria, La Gomera, and El Hierro. The most well-preserved, and <b>therefore</b> <b>the</b> most thoroughly-studied, mummies {{were found on}} Tenerife.|$|E

5|$|Owing to its {{predictable}} {{organization and}} readily inducible LTP, the CA1 hippocampus {{has become the}} prototypical site of mammalian LTP study. In particular, NMDA receptor-dependent LTP in the adult CA1 hippocampus is the most widely studied type of LTP, and is <b>therefore</b> <b>the</b> focus of this article.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the first}} finds, many other Megalosaurus bones have been recovered; however, no {{complete}} skeleton {{has yet been}} found. <b>Therefore,</b> <b>the</b> details of its physical appearance cannot be certain. However, a full osteology of all known material was published in 2010 by Benson.|$|E
5|$|The {{hardness}} of {{diamond and}} its ability to cleave strongly depend on the crystal orientation. <b>Therefore,</b> <b>the</b> crystallographic structure of the diamond to be cut is analyzed using X-ray diffraction to choose the optimal cutting directions.|$|E
30|$|<b>Therefore,</b> by <b>the</b> same method, we {{obtain the}} {{following}} theorem.|$|R

30|$|Let us <b>therefore</b> give <b>the</b> last simple illustrative related example.|$|R
5|$|The name of {{the breast}} cancer {{medication}} trastuzumab can be analyzed as tras-tu-zu-mab. <b>Therefore,</b> <b>the</b> drug is a humanized monoclonal antibody used against a tumor.|$|E
5|$|The {{ostensible}} reason given {{was that}} Britain {{was required to}} safeguard Belgium's neutrality under the 1839 Treaty of London. The German invasion of Belgium was, <b>therefore,</b> <b>the</b> casus belli and, importantly, legitimized and galvanized popular support for the war.|$|E
5|$|The {{rules of}} the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature are that in general the first-published {{description}} has priority; <b>therefore,</b> <b>the</b> valid scientific name for the oceanic whitetip shark should be Carcharhinus maou. However, Lesson's name remained forgotten {{for so long that}} Carcharhinus longimanus remains widely accepted.|$|E
