5|$|After a 3–1 home defeat by Belgium in December 1979, Wark was not {{selected}} {{again for}} his country until February 1981 for the 1982 World Cup qualifying match away against Israel. Following a successful qualification campaign, Wark {{was included in the}} Scotland squad <b>that</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> World Cup in Spain under Stein's leadership. Wark played three games and scored two goals, both of which were Scotland's opening match against New Zealand, a game Scotland won 5–2. Scotland were knocked out in the group stage.|$|E
5|$|The highway heads onward {{through the}} town of Mendon, leaving the densely {{populated}} village and its lightly populated outskirts for the rolling, open areas that dominate much of southern Monroe County. Three miles (5km) {{to the north of}} Honeoye Falls, NY65 intersects NY251 by way of a roundabout northeast of the hamlet of Rochester Junction. The community, located on NY251, marks the point where the Lehigh Valley Railroad spur <b>that</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> railroad's station in downtown Rochester returned to the main line. The route continues onward, passing alongside the western edge of Mendon Ponds Park as it enters the town of Pittsford. At the northern edge of the park, NY65 curves to the northeast and passes over the New York State Thruway (Interstate90).|$|E
5|$|Two {{versions}} of the machine were produced. The first was the world's first transistorised computer, and became operational in November 1953. The second version was completed in April 1955. The 1955 version used 200 transistors, 1,300 solid-state diodes, and had a power consumption of 150 watts. The machine did however make use of valves to generate its 125kHz clock waveforms and in the circuitry {{to read and write}} on its magnetic drum memory, so it was not the first completely transistorised computer, a distinction <b>that</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Harwell CADET of 1955.|$|E

5|$|On {{arrival in}} Britain, Seymour was celebrated and {{rewarded with a}} baronetcy for his second victory in {{less than six months}} while all of his {{officers}} were promoted. Niémen was purchased into the Navy for the sum of £29,979-2-10d, which was split between the government, the crew {{and a number of other}} parties. The share <b>that</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> captors came under dispute: Mends had no intention of abiding by Seymour's agreement with Maitland and refused to allow Emerald to share in the prize money. Seymour and Maitland took Mends to court and the ensuing legal battle lasted years, Mends deliberately exaggerating his role in the capture of Niémen in public (although privately admitting that the victory was entirely Seymour's). Seymour and Mends became bitter enemies and their animosity continued throughout their lives, although both remained in the Navy and had successful careers. Forty years later, the battle was among the actions recognised by a clasp attached to the Naval General Service Medal, awarded upon application to all British participants still living in 1847.|$|E

25|$|The {{results of}} the {{election}} showed an even split between the Liberals and Conservatives. Each major candidate received approximately {{a quarter of the}} vote share. The party vote for both the Liberals and Conservatives split for each candidate in the slate. Overall the parties managed to gain in vote percentage <b>that</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Labor candidate in 1905. The Conservatives picked up one seat and the Liberal incumbent held his. The Socialist candidate was not much of a factor, but Howell kept the main parties from gaining a clear majority in the popular vote.|$|E

The subpoena was based on a complain by Republican activist Steve Lonegan, who filed 36 conflict of interest complaints against state legislators.

25|$|Following a rebel ambush {{against a}} {{military}} convoy near Hama, the military made a counter-attack {{that led to}} the Battle of Tremseh with the Free Syrian Army in Tremseh, leading to a reported death of dozens of rebels, and an unknown number of civilians. Two days later, the UN observer mission issued a statement, based on the investigation by its team <b>that</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> town, that the Syrian military mainly targeted the homes of rebels and activists, in what the BBC said was a contradiction of the initial opposition claims of a civilian massacre. They said that the number of casualties was unclear and added that they intend to return to the town to continue their investigation.|$|E

It was subsequently refurbished as a mental hospital, originally known as Florida State Hospital for the Insane, which opened in 1876. It gained notoriety {{over the course of}} its long history. It was sued in O'Connor v. Donaldson, a case <b>that</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> US Supreme Court, which ruled that the hospital had illegally confined one of its patients. The decision contributed to the deinstitutionalization movement, which resulted in changes to state laws and the closure of many public mental institutions in the country. The hospital today treats patients with severe mental disabilities who have been civilly or forensically committed to the institution.|$|E
25|$|As is {{sometimes}} common in scientific discoveries, simultaneous developments can occur, {{as evidenced by}} a number of inventors who were at work on the telephone. Over a period of 18 years, the Bell Telephone Company faced 587 court challenges to its patents, including five <b>that</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> U.S. Supreme Court, but none was successful in establishing priority over the original Bell patent and the Bell Telephone Company never lost a case that had proceeded to a final trial stage. Bell's laboratory notes and family letters were the key to establishing a long lineage to his experiments. The Bell company lawyers successfully fought off myriad lawsuits generated initially around the challenges by Elisha Gray and Amos Dolbear. In personal correspondence to Bell, both Gray and Dolbear had acknowledged his prior work, which considerably weakened their later claims.|$|E

25|$|Former Croatian {{president}} Stjepan Mesić revealed {{thousands of}} documents and audio tapes recorded by Franjo Tuđman about his plans during {{a case against}} Croat leaders from Bosnia and Herzegovina for war crimes committed against Bosniaks. During the trial against Tihomir Blaškić, who was the HVO commander for the Central Bosnian Operative Zone, for the crimes in Ahmići, the defence argued {{that there was a}} parallel line of command surpassing Blaškić <b>that</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> political leadership of Herzeg-Bosnia. There were reports in the media that Tuđman himself participated in the coverup. The appeals chamber of the ICTY ruled that Blaškić did not have command responsibility for the massacre and lowered the initial sentence (in 2000) of 45 years to nine years of imprisonment. He was released after serving 8 years and 4 months of his sentence.|$|E
25|$|Under rookie {{head coach}} Paul Westphal (a former Suns {{assistant}} and, as a player, {{member of the}} 1976 Suns squad <b>that</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> NBA Finals), the Suns squad won 62 games, setting a franchise record (since tied in 2004–05). In {{the first round of}} the playoffs, they defeated the eighth-seeded Lakers, coming back from an 0–2 deficit in the five-game series. The Suns went on to eliminate the Spurs and SuperSonics, advancing to the Finals for the second time in franchise history. They eventually lost to the Chicago Bulls, led by eventual Hall of Famers Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen. The series included a triple-overtime game (Game 3) that along with Game 5 of the 1976 series are the only triple-overtime games in the history of the NBA Finals. Approximately 300,000 fans braved the 105° heat to celebrate the memorable season in the streets of Phoenix.|$|E
25|$|In the 1950s, {{numerous}} {{school districts}} in Kent and Sussex Counties, including Ellendale, continued to fight against desegregation after the ruling of Brown v. Board of Education. The protests which begin at the Milford School District, eventually bringing about a lawsuit <b>that</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Delaware Supreme Court which ruled that while segregation was unconstitutional, it did not require immediate desegregation. This was further bolstered by the findings of Griffin v. County School Board of Prince Edward County. Bryant Bowles, President of the National Association for the Advancement of White People led several anti-desegregation rallies and boycotts in the area, including Ellendale, that resulted in decreased attendance at the schools. Ellendale School 125 and Ellendale Colored School 195C reached an agreement on consolidation, but attorney Louis L. Redding complained to the Department of Public Instruction that black teachers were being subjected to scrutiny that their white counterparts were not. After desegregation, all students were educated at Ellendale School 125.|$|E
