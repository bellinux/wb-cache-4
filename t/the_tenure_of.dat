5|$|Stanton {{refused to}} leave his office, and on February 24, 1868, the House impeached the President for {{intentionally}} violating <b>the</b> <b>Tenure</b> <b>of</b> Office Act, {{by a vote of}} 128 to 47. The House subsequently adopted eleven articles of impeachment, for the most part alleging that he had violated <b>the</b> <b>Tenure</b> <b>of</b> Office Act, and had questioned the legitimacy of Congress.|$|E

5|$|Stevens {{introduced}} a Tenure of Office Act, restricting Johnson from firing officials {{who had received}} Senate confirmation without getting that body's consent. <b>The</b> <b>Tenure</b> <b>of</b> Office Act was ambiguous, since it could be read to protect officeholders only during <b>the</b> <b>tenure</b> <b>of</b> the president who appointed them, {{and most of the}} officials the radicals sought to protect had been named by Lincoln. Chief among these was Secretary of War Edwin Stanton, a radical himself.|$|E
5|$|Cleveland was {{the first}} Democratic President subject to <b>the</b> <b>Tenure</b> <b>of</b> Office Act which {{originated}} in 1867; the act purported to require the Senate to approve the dismissal of any presidential appointee who was originally subject to its advice and consent. Cleveland objected to the act in principle and his steadfast refusal to abide by it prompted its fall into disfavor and led to its ultimate repeal in 1887.|$|E
5|$|However, <b>the</b> <b>tenure</b> <b>of</b> the Justice Party {{government}} of the Raja of Panagal is largely remembered for the introduction of caste-based reservations in 1921. In August 1921, the First communal Government Order (G.O. No.613) was passed.

40|$|This paper empirically {{evaluates the}} {{economic}} performance of U.

Methodologically, I apply a matching method to account for the endogeneity of political selection. I find that <b>the</b> <b>tenures</b> <b>of</b> CEO governors are associated with a 0. 6 percentage points higher annual income growth rate, a 0. 4 pp higher growth rate of the private capital stock, and a 0. 6 percentage points lower unemployment rate than are <b>the</b> <b>tenures</b> <b>of</b> non-CEO governors. Income inequality decreases when CEO governors hold office...|$|R
5|$|Johnson {{notified}} Congress of Stanton's {{suspension and}} Grant's interim appointment. In January 1868, the Senate disapproved of his action, and reinstated Stanton, contending the President had violated <b>the</b> <b>Tenure</b> <b>of</b> Office Act. Grant stepped aside over Johnson's objection, causing a complete break between them. Johnson then dismissed Stanton and appointed Lorenzo Thomas to replace him.|$|E
5|$|Johnson was {{initially}} deterred {{by a strong}} objection from Grant, but on August 5, the President demanded Stanton's resignation; the secretary refused to quit with Congress out of session. Johnson then suspended him pending the next meeting of Congress as permitted under <b>the</b> <b>Tenure</b> <b>of</b> Office Act; Grant agreed to serve as temporary replacement while continuing to lead the Army.|$|E
5|$|Re-elected in 1866, Hayes {{returned}} to the lame-duck session to vote for <b>the</b> <b>Tenure</b> <b>of</b> Office Act, which ensured that Johnson could not remove administration officials without the Senate's consent. He also unsuccessfully pressed for a civil service reform bill that attracted the votes of many reform-minded Republicans. Hayes continued to vote with {{the majority in the}} 40th Congress on the Reconstruction Acts, but resigned in July 1867 to campaign for governor of Ohio.|$|E

5|$|A {{promotion}} came in c. 46, when Alexander {{was appointed}} procurator of Judea by Claudius. The province {{had returned to}} direct Roman rule only {{after the death of}} Agrippa in 44, and <b>the</b> <b>tenure</b> <b>of</b> Alexander's predecessor Cuspius Fadus had been marked by unrest, so Alexander's Jewish background may have marked him as a more acceptable governor. Less trouble is attested during his office, although he did condemn James and Simon, sons of an earlier rebel named Judas of Galilee, to crucifixion. It was also at this time that Judea was afflicted by a severe famine. In 48 he was succeeded by Ventidius Cumanus.|$|E
5|$|Dannatt {{was raised}} from Knight Commander to Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath (GCB) in the 2008–2009 New Year Honours List. His tenure as CGS expired in August 2008 {{and he was}} succeeded {{for the last time}} by Sir David Richards. The {{government}} took the unusual decision to extend <b>the</b> <b>tenure</b> <b>of</b> Air Chief Marshal Sir Jock Stirrup as CDS, rather than promote one of the outgoing service chiefs. Thus all three, including Dannatt, retired, amid claims that Dannatt's potential promotion to CDS had been personally vetoed by Prime Minister Gordon Brown. His last act as CGS was to nominate Nick Houghton to become the next Vice-Chief of the Defence Staff.|$|E
5|$|During the 1996 elections, the BJP shifted its stance {{away from}} {{protectionism}} and towards globalisation; its election manifesto recommended increasing {{foreign investment in}} priority sectors, while restricting it in others. When the party was in power in 1998, it shifted its policy even further in favour of globalisation. <b>The</b> <b>tenure</b> <b>of</b> the NDA saw an unprecedented influx of foreign companies in India. This was criticised by the left parties and the BJP's affiliates (the RSS and the Swadeshi Jagran Manch). The communist parties said that the BJP was attempting to appease the World Bank and the United States government through its neoliberal policies. Similarly, the RSS stated that the BJP was not being true to its swadeshi ideology.|$|E

5|$|Founding {{publisher}} Alexander {{was born}} about 1830 {{and came to}} Oregon from Illinois as a pioneer in 1852. Alexander initially worked as a farmer, supplementing his income as a surveyor and local {{justice of the peace}} before learning the printing trade working for the town's earlier pro-Southern newspapers. Although his own venture as a publisher was short and unprofitable, Alexander unwittingly was the scion of a local newspaper dynasty in Oregon, with two of his sons later themselves publishing The Guard (following <b>the</b> <b>tenure</b> <b>of</b> several intermediate owners), while a grandson, George L. Alexander, would one day edit another Oregon paper, the Lebanon Express.|$|E
5|$|In January 1867, Congressman Stevens {{introduced}} legislation {{to dissolve the}} Southern state governments and reconstitute them into five military districts, under martial law. The states would begin again by holding constitutional conventions. African Americans could vote for or become delegates; former Confederates could not. In the legislative process, Congress added to the bill that restoration to the Union would follow the state's ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment, and completion {{of the process of}} adding it to the Constitution. Johnson and the Southerners attempted a compromise, whereby the South would agree to {{a modified version of the}} amendment without the disqualification of former Confederates, and for limited black suffrage. The Republicans insisted on the full language of the amendment, and the deal fell through. Although Johnson could have pocket vetoed the First Reconstruction Act as it was presented to him less than ten days before the end of the Thirty-Ninth Congress, he chose to veto it directly on March 2, 1867; Congress overruled him the same day. Also on March 2, Congress passed <b>the</b> <b>Tenure</b> <b>of</b> Office Act over the President's veto, in response to statements during the Swing Around the Circle that he planned to fire Cabinet secretaries who did not agree with him. This bill, requiring Senate approval for the firing of Cabinet members during <b>the</b> <b>tenure</b> <b>of</b> the president who appointed them and for one month afterwards, was immediately controversial, with some senators doubting that it was constitutional or that its terms applied to Johnson, whose key Cabinet officers were Lincoln holdovers.|$|E
