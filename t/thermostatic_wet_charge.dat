40|$|The <b>wetting</b> of a <b>charged</b> wedge-like wall by an {{electrolyte}} solution is investigated {{by means of}} classical density functional theory. As in other studies on wedge wetting, this geometry is considered as the most simple deviation from a planar substrate, and {{it serves as a}} first step towards more complex confinements of fluids. By focusing on fluids containing ions and surface charges, features of real systems are covered which are not accessible within the vast majority of previous theoretical studies concentrating on simple fluids in contact with uncharged wedges. In particular, the filling transition of charged wedges is necessarily of first order, because <b>wetting</b> transitions of <b>charged</b> substrates are of first order and the barrier in the effective interface potential persists below the wetting transition of a planar wall; hence, critical filling transitions are not expected to occur for ionic systems. The dependence of the critical opening angle on the surface charge, as well as the dependence of the filling height, of the wedge adsorption, and of the line tension on the opening angle and on the surface charge are analyzed in detail...|$|R

A number of details of various sorts, a hundred or more, had alighted from the train, twenty of them Post-office volunteers, some of the Pioneer Railway corps, a few Shropshires, and other waifs and strays. To them in the early morning came the gentleman with the tinted glasses, his hands still red with the blood of the Derbies. 'I have fourteen hundred men and four guns. Surrender!' said the messenger. But it is not in nature for a postman to give up his postbag without a struggle. 'Never!' cried the valiant postmen. But shell after shell battered the corrugated-iron buildings about their ears, and it was not possible for them to answer the guns which were smashing the life out of them. There was no help for it but to surrender. De Wet added samples of the British volunteer and of the British regular to his bag of militia. The station and train were burned down, the great-coats looted, the big shells exploded, and the mails burned. The latter was the one unsportsmanlike action which can up to that date be laid to De <b>Wet's</b> <b>charge.</b> Forty thousand men to the north of him could forego their coats and their food, but they yearned greatly for those home letters, charred fragments of which are still blowing about the veld.

40|$|The {{process of}} {{sintering}} {{is characterized by}} the circulation load - the return, which is both a production intensifier and a production fault. The return mode influences upon productivity of a sintering plant {{and the quality of the}} sinter. In production conditions the output of the return is self-balanced because of the product’s strength and the way of sinter cake processing. So it is required to try to reach balanced return in order to get objective results in laboratory conditions. Various factors of the sintering process productivity determined from <b>wet</b> <b>charge,</b> from charge with return, from finished sinter cake from standard stabilized sinter cake under closed cycle of return were analyzed in this article. In laboratory conditions a comparative evaluation of the sintering process productivity by raw charge and finished sinter cake output under a closed balanced cycle of return is most objective. Evaluation of productivity without any regard to the amount of the return in charge materials leads to biased results of investigations. A stabilized balance of return is supposed to take place under production conditions. The existing method of a sintering plant productivity evaluation is based on the shipped finished sinter cake output, without consideration for the quantity of the fine fraction, removed before charging into blast furnaces (secondary return), which is also added into sinter charge. Hence, a comparative evaluation of specific productivity of the sintering process must be made with due regard of the aggregate output of return or the strength of the sinter cake. Evaluation of specific productivity by stabilized sinter cake makes it possible to predict the output of finished sinter cake of high strength. An intensifying action upon the sintering process also depends upon the size of the return. In further investigations it is necessary to analyze the possibilities of controlling the return mode by means of preliminary granulation of its small fraction...|$|R
40|$|The drag {{of fluid}} flow at the solid–liquid {{interface}} in the micro/nanoscale {{is an important}} issue in micro/nanofluidic systems. Drag depends on the surface <b>wetting,</b> nanobubbles, surface <b>charge</b> and boundary slip. Some researchers have focused on the relationship between these interface properties. In this review, the influence of an applied voltage on the surface wettability, nanobubbles, surface charge density and slip length are discussed. The contact angle (CA) and contact angle hysteresis (CAH) of a droplet of deionized (DI) water on a hydrophobic polystyrene (PS) surface were measured with applied direct current (DC) and alternating current (AC) voltages. The nanobubbles in DI water and three kinds of saline solution on a PS surface were imaged when a voltage was applied. The influence of the surface charge density on the nanobubbles was analyzed. Then the slip length and the electrostatic force on the probe were measured on an octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS) surface with applied voltage. The influence of the surface charge on the boundary slip and drag of fluid flow has been discussed. Finally, the influence of the applied voltage on the surface <b>wetting,</b> nanobubbles, surface <b>charge,</b> boundary slip and the drag of liquid flow are summarized. With a smaller surface charge density which could be achieved by applying a voltage on the surface, larger and fewer nanobubbles, a larger slip length and a smaller drag of liquid flow could be found...|$|R
40|$|Surface wetting on {{polyelectrolyte}} multilayers (PEMs), {{prepared by}} alternating deposition of polydiallyldimethylammonium chloride (PDDA) and poly(styrene sulfonate) (PSS), was investigated mainly in water‐solid‐oil systems. The surface‐wetting behavior of as‐prepared PEMs was well correlated to the molecular {{structures of the}} uncompensated ionic groups on the PEMs as revealed by sum frequency generation vibrational and X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopies. The orientation change of the benzenesulfonate groups on the PSS‐capped surfaces causes poor water wetting in oil or air and negligible oil wetting in water, while the orientation change of the quaternized pyrrolidine rings on the PDDA‐capped surfaces hardly affects their wetting behavior. The underwater oil repellency of PSS‐capped PEMs was successfully harnessed to manufacture highly efficient filters for oil‐water separation at high flux. Wet surfaces: Liquid <b>wetting</b> on <b>charged</b> surfaces is well correlated with the molecular nature of surface ionic groups. The orientation change of surface ionic groups either hardly affects water wetting if their configuration is isotropic, or markedly transforms poor water wetting in oil to poor water de‐wetting in water if their configuration is anisotropic, thus leading to excellent underwater oil repellency...|$|R
40|$|The line {{tension of}} an {{electrolyte}} wetting a non-polar substrate is computed analytically and numerically. The results show that, {{depending on the}} value of the apparent contact angle, positive or negative line tension values may be obtained. Furthermore, a significant difference between Young's contact angle and the apparent contact angle measured several Debye lengths remote from the three-phase contact line occurs. When applying the results to water <b>wetting</b> highly <b>charged</b> surfaces, line tension values of the same order of magnitude as found in recent experiments can be achieved. Therefore, the theory presented may contribute to the understanding of line tension measurements and points to the importance of the electrostatic line tension. Being strongly dependent on the interfacial charge density, electrostatic line tension is found to be tunable via the pH value of the involved electrolyte. As a practical consequence, the stability of nanoparticles adsorbed at fluid-fluid interfaces is predicted to be dependent on the pH value. The theory is suited for future incorporation of effects due to surfactants where even larger line tension values can be expected. Comment: 8 pages, 3 figure...|$|R

The results showed that pretreated with endo-cellulase at the dosage of 0. 4 ECG/g before refining could increase the refining degree by 53. 09 %, and it would reduce refining energy consumption significantly. At this dosage, the tensile index of the paper sheet increased while the tear index of paper sheet decreased slightly. Additionally, enzymatic pretreatment could raise fiber surface wettability, lower the absolute value of Zeta potential and decrease the crystallinity of fiber, which was help to improve refining performance...|$|R

Our insole prototype relies on capacitive sensing and is able to sense plantar pressure distribution underneath the foot, plus a capacitive ground coupling effect. By using machine-learning algorithms, we evaluated the identification of 13 users, while walking, with a confidence of ~ 95 % after a recognition delay of ~ 1 s. Once the user's gait is known, again we can discover irregularities in gait plus a varying ground coupling.

40|$|<b>Wetting</b> of a <b>charged</b> {{substrate}} by an {{electrolyte solution}} is investigated {{by means of}} classical density functional theory applied to a lattice model. Within the present model the pure, i. e., salt-free solvent, for which all interactions are of the nearest-neighbor type only, exhibits a second-order wetting transition for all strengths of the substrate-particle and the particle-particle interactions for which the wetting transition temperature is nonzero. The influences of the substrate charge density and of the ionic strength on the wetting transition temperature and {{on the order of}} the wetting transition are studied. If the substrate is neutral, the addition of salt to the solvent changes neither the order nor the transition temperature of the wetting transition of the system. If the surface charge is nonzero, upon adding salt this continuous wetting transition changes to first-order within the wide range of substrate surface charge densities and ionic strengths studied here. As the substrate surface charge density is increased, at fixed ionic strength, the wetting transition temperature decreases and the prewetting line associated with the first-order wetting transition becomes longer. This decrease of the wetting transition temperature upon increasing the surface charge density becomes more pronounced by decreasing the ionic strength. Comment: submitte...|$|R
40|$|Hailstones in wet {{growth are}} {{commonly}} found in thunderclouds. While the ice-ice relative growth rate mechanism is generally accepted as the most likely cause of thunderstorm electrification, it is uncertain if this mechanism will operate under wet growth conditions because ice crystals {{are more likely to}} stick to the wet surface of a hailstone rather than bounce off it. Experiments were carried out in the laboratory to investigate if there was any charge separated when vapor-grown ice crystals bounced off a wet hailstone. A cloud of supercooled droplets, with and without ice crystals, was drawn past a simulated hailstone. In the dry growth regime, the hailstone charged strongly positive when droplets and crystals co-existed in the cloud. With only droplets in the cloud, there was no charging in the dry growth regime. However, as the hailstone attained <b>wet</b> growth, positive <b>charging</b> currents of about 0. 5 and 3. 5 pA were observed at 12 and 20 m s- 1, respectively. We hypothesize that this observed charging was due to the evaporation of melt water. This so called Dinger-Gunn Effect is due to the ejection of negatively charged minute droplets produced by air bubbles bursting at the surface of the melt water. However the <b>charge</b> separated in <b>wet</b> growth was an order of magnitude smaller than that in dry growth and, therefore, we conclude that it is unlikely {{to play an important role}} in the electrification of thunderstorms...|$|R
40|$|Electrochemical ultracapacitors (ECs) {{have been}} {{developed}} using graphitic nanostacks as the electrode material. The advantages of this technology will be the reduction of device size due to superior power densities and relative powers compared to traditional activated carbon electrodes. External testing showed that these materials display reduced discharge response times compared to state-of-the-art materials. Such applications are advantageous for pulsed power applications such as burst communications (satellites, cell phones), electromechanical actuators, and battery load leveling in electric vehicles. These carbon nanostructures are highly conductive and offer an ordered mesopore network. These attributes will provide more complete electrolyte wetting, and faster release of stored charge compared to activated carbon. Electrochemical capacitor (EC) electrode materials were developed using commercially available nanomaterials and modifying them to exploit their energy storage properties. These materials would be an improvement over current ECs that employ activated carbon as the electrode material. Commercially available graphite nanofibers (GNFs) are used as precursor materials for the synthesis of graphitic nanostacks (GNSs). These materials offer much greater surface area than graphite flakes. Additionally, these materials offer a superior electrical conductivity and a greater average pore size compared to activated carbon electrodes. The {{state of the art}} in EC development uses activated carbon (AC) as the electrode material. AC has a high surface area, but its small average pore size inhibits electrolyte ingress/egress. Additionally, AC has a higher resistivity, which generates parasitic heating in high-power applications. This work focuses on fabricating EC from carbon that has a very different structure by increasing the surface area of the GNF by intercalation or exfoliation of the graphitic basal planes. Additionally, various functionalities to the GNS surface will be added that can exhibit pseudocapacitance. This pseudocapacitance exhibits faradaic (charge transfer) properties that can further increase the overall relative and volumetric capacitance of the material. A process is also proposed to use GNF as a precursor material to fabricate GNS that will be used as EC electrodes. This results in much better electrical conductivity than activated carbon. This is advantageous for high-pulsed-power applications to reduce parasitic heating. Larger average pore size allows more complete electrolyte <b>wetting</b> (faster <b>charge</b> transfer kinetics). These properties contribute to a lowered equivalent series resistance (ESR), increased specific power, shorter charging times, and decreased parasitic heating. The high density of basal plane edges provides nucleation sites for activation (addition of hydrophilic functional groups) that facilitate electrolyte wetting, and will contribute to pseudocapacitance...|$|R
