500|$|Throughout {{his adult}} life, Britten had a {{particular}} rapport with children and enjoyed close friendships with several boys, particularly those in their early teens. The first such friendship was with Piers Dunkerley, 13 years old in 1934 when Britten was aged 20. Other boys Britten befriended were the young David Hemmings and Michael Crawford, both of whom sang treble roles in his works in the 1950s. Hemmings later said, [...] "In {{all of the time}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>spent</b> with him he never abused that trust", and Crawford wrote [...] "I cannot say enough about the kindness of that great man... he had a wonderful patience and affinity with young people. He loved music, and loved youngsters caring about music." ...|$|E
500|$|The duet of [...] "I Gotta Be Me" [...] by Finn and Mike was {{considered}} to be [...] "shockingly adorable" [...] by Berk, who gave it four stars out of five. Slezak was less impressed: [...] "The jazz band arrangement and the Mike-teaches-Finn-some-moves choreography was cute, I guess, but it's not a good sign <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>spent</b> half the number focusing on Mike's matching green t-shirt and shoe laces." [...] He went on to question the song's inclusion—"In an episode about confronting one's greatest teenage insecurities, I wonder if {{there might have been a}} better choice for a solo than the popular football player with the cheerleader girlfriend lamenting his inability to dance"—and ultimately gave the performance a [...] "B−". Futterman also commented on the song's selection, though from a slightly different angle: [...] "In theory it's charming—and there are definitely moments of the 'I can dance/You can't dance' exchange that were enjoyable—but we couldn't ever imagine this song as something Finn would have voluntarily picked." ...|$|E

500|$|In the {{following}} season, Hextall remained with Hershey, appearing in 53games during [...] the 1985–86 season. He recorded 30wins {{and the lowest}} GAA average of his career to that point, 3.41. The Bears finished the regular season as league leaders, and won the John D. Chick Trophy as the South Division Champions. Hextall lived up to his aggressive reputation in the Conference final, played against the St. Catharines Saints, fighting three different members of the opposition side during a single bench-clearing brawl. The Bears advanced to the Calder Cup final, having beaten the New Haven Nighthawks 4–1 and the St.Catharines Saints 4–3. In the final, they faced the Adirondack Red Wings, who won the championship by four games to two. Hextall played 13games in the playoffs, of which his team won five, and his GAA was3.23. He was named as the Dudley [...] "Red" [...] Garrett Memorial Award winner, as the AHL's outstanding rookie player. Looking back on {{his time in the}} AHL, Hextall reflected that despite his initial disappointment at not being selected to play for the Flyers straight away, [...] "the two years <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>spent</b> in the American League got me to the point where I was sure I could be a No.1 goaltender at the NHL level." ...|$|E

Watson was selling his prize {{to raise money}} to support scientific research. After auctions fees, Watson received $4.1m. Usmanov subsequently returned the medal to Watson, stating [...] "in my opinion, a situation in which an outstanding scientist sells a medal recognizing his achievements is unacceptable. Watson's work contributed to cancer research, the illness from which my father died.

2500|$|Before Peter was born, {{his mother}} Thelma went to Mexico City {{to have an}} abortion.

Peter visits Mickey, who initially rejects him. Mickey later accepts him as his son after beating him in the [...] "game of drink" [...] (the game of drink referring to matching shots until one passes out). Mickey {{is based on the}} friends of MacFarlane's father. MacFarlane said: [...] "When I was growing up, my father had lots of friends: big, vocal, opinionated New England, Irish Catholics.

(All Day I Dream About Spittin) project and a viral marketing campaign called [...] "Save The Ras Kass", which included a series of satirical web episodes {{about the plight of}} the endangered emcee. In an interview with MTV UK writer Han O'Connor he explained his decision to use Kickstarter, stating [...] "we started trying different angles at solving old problems. Kickstarter was the natural evolution of trying creative new business models. When we put out The Quarterly there were people that said, ‘well how come you didn’t create a CD for this?’ and I’m like ‘well if I have to spend that $5000 and you want one, I appreciate it but there’s the small problem <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>spent</b> $5000.’" [...] His webisodes document the downfall of an emcee, as he explained, [...] "You just see this downward spiral; it’s just that fall from grace and I’m kind of making fun of that and using me as the vehicle for it." [...] Finally, Ras Kass exceeded the $3,800 needed for the record in less than five days, with the project being released as a limited edition double CD and LP on July 20, 2011.|$|E
2500|$|André St-Pierre is the {{director}} of the episodes. He is best known as the co-director of the Télé-Québec show Les Francs-Tireurs and La Job was his first fiction. Script adaptation was given to Ian Lauzon and Jean-Philippe Granger was made screenwriter. Like the American Office, improv veterans were called to fill the shoes of some of the original actors. The role of the David Brent boss was entrusted to Antoine Vézina, a performer of the reputed Ligue nationale d'improvisation (LNI), a Quebec-born concept of improvisational theatre and international improv team competition (Quebec, France, Belgium, Switzerland and Italy). Sophie Cadieux, who holds the role corresponding to Dawn Tinsley, has also taken part in the LNI. Paul Ahmarani, playing La Jobs Gareth Keenan, is a great fan of the British series. About the black humor of the show, he comments: [...] "Personally, when I began watching that show, after five minutes, I knew that I had before my eyes something unique, that would literally shatter all that we had seen before". On his character, he sums up that [...] "I'm someone that is very much of a coward, so I like to take refuge in military fantasies of virility... I really like to say <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>spent</b> three years in the army... I'm a bit of a loser, very right-wing, very militarist".
