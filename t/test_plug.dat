Currently, the MCO design calls for use of silver or gold plated seals in these locations. The seal plating materials are deposited on Inconel 718 or X- 750 substrates.

The corrosion resistance of tin in the expected MCO environments is acceptable. The effect of radiation hardening will offset creep deformation results.

Spark plug production {{is a complex}} process {{and there are many}} opportunities for faults to be manifested.

50|$|Plugs {{and power}} cords have a rated voltage (V) and rated current (A) {{assigned}} {{to them by}} the manufacturer, and these values are required to be marked on the plug. For a plug, the values are normally those specified in the relevant standard sheet.

The NEMA 1-15 U.S. 2 pin (Type A) and NEMA 5-15 U.S. 3 pin (Type B) plugs are rated at 125 V. Similar plugs used in countries with higher mains voltages in the range 220-250 V are rated at 250 V.

40|$|Assessing the goodness-of-fit for {{intricate}} parametric spatial {{point processes}} {{is a necessary}} tool in many application fields. When {{the density of the}} hypothesized model is intractable, a commonly used test is the Monte Carlo goodness-of-fit test. Additionally, if data consists of a single dataset, a commonly used version of the <b>test</b> <b>plugs</b> in a parameter estimate to the hypothesized parametric model to generate data for the Monte Carlo goodness-of-fit test. In this case, the test is invalid because the resulting actual level does not meet the nominal level (Diggle, 2003, Sec. 6. 2).

We theoretically justify our testing procedure using Taylor expansion, and demonstrate its consistent performance through various simulation studies. Using our testing method, we discover that Phlebocarya filifolia plants near Pearth, Australia follow a homogeneous Poisson clustered process which provides insight into the propagation mechanism of these plants.

40|$|Background: Males usually produce mating plugs {{to reduce}} sperm competition. However, females can conceivably also produce mating plugs {{in order to}} prevent unwanted, {{superfluous}} and energetically costly matings. In spiders–appropriate models for <b>testing</b> <b>plugging</b> biology hypotheses–mating plugs may consist of male genital parts and/or of amorphous covers consisting of glandular or sperm secretions. In the giant wood spider Nephila pilipes, a highly sexually dimorphic and polygamous species, males are known to produce ineffective embolic plugs through genital damage, but nothing is known about the origin and function of additional conspicuous amorphous plugs (AP) covering female genitals. Methodology: We tested alternative hypotheses of the nature and function of AP in N. pilipes by staging mating trials with varying degrees of polyandry. No APs were ever formed during mating trials, which rules out the possibility of male AP formation. Instead, those females that oviposited produced the AP from a liquid secreted during egg sac formation. Polyandrous females were more likely to lay eggs and to produce the AP, as were those that mated longer and with more total insertions. Our further tests revealed that, in spite of being a side product of egg sac production, AP, when hardened, prevented any subsequent copulation. Conclusions: We conclude that in the giant wood spider (Nephila pilipes), the amorphous mating plugs are not produced by the males, that repeated copulations (most likely polyandrous) are necessary for egg fertilization and AP formation, and tha...|$|R

40|$|This project, {{which began}} in FY 97, {{involves}} both the flow loop research on plugging and unplugging of waste transfer pipelines, and the large-scale industrial equipment <b>test</b> of <b>plugging</b> locating and unplugging technologies. In FY 98, the related work was performed under the project name ''Mixing, Settling, and Pipe Unplugging of Waste Transfer Lines. '' The mixing, settling, and pipeline plugging and unplugging are critical to the design and maintenance of a waste transfer pipeline system, especially for the High-Level Waste (HLW) pipeline transfer. The major objective of this work is to recreate pipeline plugging conditions for equipment <b>testing</b> of <b>plug</b> locating and removal and to provide systematic operating data for modification of equipment design and enhancement of performance of waste transfer lines used at DOE sites. As the waste tank clean-out and decommissioning program becomes active at the DOE sites, there is an increasing potential that the waste slurry transfer lines will become plugged and unable to transport waste slurry from one tank to another or from the mixing tank to processing facilities. Transfer systems may potentially become plugged if the solids concentration of the material being transferred increases beyond the capability of the prime mover or if upstream mixing is inadequately performed. Plugging can occur due to the solids' settling in either the mixing tank, the pumping system, or the transfer lines. In order to enhance and optimize the slurry's removal and transfer, refined and reliable data on the mixing, sampling, and pipe unplugging systems must be obtained based on both laboratory-scale and simulated in-situ operating conditions...|$|R
