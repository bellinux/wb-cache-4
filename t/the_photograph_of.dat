5|$|Attribution {{is often}} {{difficult}} with Farsari's photographs because 19th-century photographers frequently acquired each others' images and sold them under their own names. This {{may be due to}} the commonplace exchange of stock and negatives between various commercial photographers, or due to the number of freelance amateurs who sold their work to more than one studio. Thus a photograph identified as by Farsari might actually be by Beato, Stillfried & Andersen or Kusakabe. A case in point is <b>the</b> <b>photograph</b> <b>of</b> an Officer's Daughter, variously attributed to Farsari, Stillfried, Kusakabe or even Suzuki Shin'ichi.|$|E
5|$|Following the letters, Jackson {{received}} a parcel containing {{a photograph of}} the fan, as well as a letter and a gun. Jackson was horrified; the letter asked that the pop singer kill himself on a certain day and at a specific time. The fan would do the same once she had killed their baby. She wrote that if they could not be together in this life, then they would be in the next. To his mother's dismay, Jackson had <b>the</b> <b>photograph</b> <b>of</b> the woman framed and hung above the dining room table of their family home. Afterwards, the Jacksons discovered that the fan had been sent to a psychiatric hospital.|$|E
5|$|As {{punishment}} for his escape, he {{is forced to}} repeatedly dig a grave-sized hole in the prison camp yard, fill it back in, and then be beaten. The prisoners observe his persecution, singing spirituals. Finally, as the other prisoners watch from {{the windows of the}} bunkhouse, an exhausted Luke collapses in the hole, begging God for mercy and pleads with the bosses not to hit him again. Believing Luke is finally broken, the Captain stops the punishment. Boss Paul warns Luke that he will be killed if ever he runs away again, which Luke promises in tears not to do. The prisoners begin to lose their idealized image of Luke, and one tears up <b>the</b> <b>photograph</b> <b>of</b> Luke with the women.|$|E

5|$|Demi Moore had {{appeared}} {{on the cover of}} Vanity Fair exactly one year earlier in the August 1991 edition in Leibovitz's photograph, More Demi Moore. As a groundbreaking work, <b>the</b> <b>photograph</b> <b>of</b> her pregnant pose was an iconic one for Moore, Leibovitz and women in general who now view public representation of pregnancy as socially acceptable. It had a cultural impact by causing numerous celebrities to pose for photographs in advanced pregnancy, which has made pregnancy photos fashionable and created a profitable business for photographers such as Jennifer Loomis. The American Society of Magazine Editors regards it {{as one of the best}} U.S. magazine covers ever, and it is one of Leibovitz' best-known works. Additionally, the photo served as a litmus test when Internet decency standards were first being legislated and adjudicated.|$|E

Only females feed on blood, taking a large meal to support production of several hundred eggs, followed by several more cycles of blood meal followed by egg laying.

25|$|Photographs of {{the dead}} or injured arouse {{controversy}} because more often than not, the name of person depicted in the photograph is not given in the caption. The family of the person is often not informed of the photograph until they see it published. <b>The</b> <b>photograph</b> <b>of</b> the street execution of a suspected Viet Cong soldier during the Vietnam War provoked {{a lot of interest}} because it captured the exact moment of death. The family of the victim was also not informed that the picture would run publicly.|$|E
25|$|Captain O'Connor only {{mentioned}} the two prints on the obverse {{side of the}} note and none on the reverse. Further, since {{both sides of the}} note are photographed immediately after fuming by the FBI a third print on the reverse side would have been obvious on the note itself and {{at the time of the}} development of <b>the</b> <b>photograph</b> <b>of</b> the note. Yet, despite the testing occurring in mid-January, this third print wasn't discovered until early July, six months later and approximately two weeks after Heirens was arrested, despite Laffey working on the Degnan case almost exclusively for six months.|$|E
25|$|As Christ is {{believed}} to be God, it is justified to hold in one's mind the image of God-incarnate. Likewise, when one venerates an icon, it is not the wood or paint that are venerated but rather the individual shown, just as it is not the paper one loves when one might kiss <b>the</b> <b>photograph</b> <b>of</b> a loved one. As Saint Basil famously proclaimed, honour or veneration of the icon always passes to its archetype. Following this reasoning, the veneration of the glorified human saint made in God's image, is always a veneration of the divine image, and hence God as foundational archetype.|$|E
