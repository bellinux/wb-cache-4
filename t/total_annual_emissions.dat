Although the diffusion at the air–water interface is the most studied pathway, its spatial and temporal variations are poorly documented. We measured temperature and O 2 and CH 4 concentrations every 2 weeks for 3. 5 years at nine stations in a subtropical monomictic reservoir which was flooded in 2008 (Nam Theun 2 Reservoir, Lao PDR). Based on these results, we quantified CH 4 storage in the water column and diffusive fluxes from June 2009 to December 2012. We compared diffusive emissions with ebullition from Deshmukh et al.  (2014) and aerobic methane oxidation and downstream emissions from Deshmukh et al.  (2016). In this monomictic reservoir, the seasonal variations of CH 4 concentration and storage were highly dependent on the thermal stratification. Hypolimnic CH 4 concentration and CH 4 storage reached their maximum in the warm dry season (WD) when the reservoir was stratified. Concentration and storage decreased during the warm wet (WW) season and reached its minimum after the reservoir overturned in the cool dry (CD) season. The sharp decreases in CH 4 storage were concomitant with extreme diffusive fluxes (up to 200  mmol m − 2  d − 1). These sporadic emissions occurred mostly in the inflow region in the WW season and during overturn in the CD season {{in the area of the}} reservoir that has the highest CH 4 storage. Although they corresponded to less than 10  % of the observations, these extreme CH 4 emissions (>  5  mmol m − 2  d − 1) contributed up to 50  % of <b>total</b> <b>annual</b> <b>emissions</b> by diffusion.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), Civil Engineering, Washington State UniversityCropping {{systems can}} be net sources or net sinks of {{greenhouse}} gases (GHGs) depending on climate and management. Agriculture can be a sink for carbon dioxide (CO 2) if climate and management conditions are conducive for the build-up of soil organic matter. At the same time, agricultural soils are the main anthropogenic source of nitrous oxide (N 2 O), which is both a GHG and an ozone depleting substance. The work presented in this dissertation investigates the dynamics of CO 2 and N 2 O fluxes over terrestrial systems in the Pacific Northwest (PNW) using measurements and modeling. The first study used the eddy covariance micrometeorological method to monitor fluxes of CO 2 for two years at two agricultural sites representing the low- and high-end of the regional precipitation gradient. Combining the measured net ecosystem exchange of CO 2 with information on carbon (C) export during harvest, we found that both sites were net carbon sinks. The high-rainfall site had a two-year C balance of 202 ± 60 g C m- 2, and the low-rainfall site had a C balance of 444 ± 34 g C m- 2. The second study used the flux gradient micrometeorological technique and automated static chambers to measure N 2 O emissions over one year at two agricultural sites, one under no-tillage management (CAF-NT) and one that had conventional tillage (CAF-CT). The chamber results indicated <b>total</b> <b>annual</b> <b>emissions</b> of 2. 7 ± 1. 6 kg N 2 O-N ha- 1 and 4. 4 ± 3. 2 kg N 2 O-N ha- 1 from CAF-NT and CAF-CT, respectively, while the flux gradient results indicated that CAF-NT and CAF-CT had <b>total</b> <b>annual</b> <b>emissions</b> of 2. 1 ± 0. 4 and 1. 7 ± 0. 3 kg N 2 O-N ha- 1, respectively.

40|$|One of {{the most}} common criticisms of {{pollution}} taxes is that they are often believed to be inequitable — i. e., low income households are thought to be disproportionately harmed. In this paper, we assess the distributional impacts of three taxes aimed at reducing emissions from motor vehicles: (i) a tax on <b>total</b> <b>annual</b> <b>emissions,</b> (ii) a tax on emissions rates (in grams per mile), and (iii) a tax on annual miles traveled. We use two alternative measures of economic well-being, annual household income and a constructed measure of lifetime income. We find that all three fees look regressive, both on the basis of annual and lifetime income — though much less so on a lifetime income basis. However, if one of these fees is used to substitute for existing vehicle registration fees, the differential impacts over existing fees are quite small: on a lifetime income basis, the mileage-based fee looks almost identical to the current system, while the total emissions fee is a little more regressive and the emissions rate-based fee slightly more regressive still than the current system. These results highlight the importance of tax shifting to help the environment. ...|$|E
