5|$|An {{earthquake}} at 8:32:17a.m. PDT (UTC−7) on Sunday, May 18, 1980, {{caused the}} entire weakened north face to slide away, creating the largest landslide ever recorded. This allowed the partly molten, high-pressure gas- and steam-rich {{rock in the}} volcano <b>to</b> <b>suddenly</b> explode northwards toward Spirit Lake in a hot mix of lava and pulverized older rock, overtaking the avalanching face.|$|E
5|$|Gambira {{first became}} {{well known in}} August 2007 during {{widespread}} protests against the State Peace and Development Council (SPDC), the military government which had ruled the country since suppressing the previous uprising in 1988. The protests were sparked when the SPDC cut fuel subsidies without warning, causing fuel and other commodity prices <b>to</b> <b>suddenly</b> rise.|$|E
5|$|Ayumi is Yuu's and Shunsuke's {{energetic}} {{younger sister}} {{in junior high}} school. She has an innocent personality and deeply cares for Yuu, providing moral support to him. Ayumi often cooks for Yuu and {{has a tendency to}} add pizza sauce to every food she makes, unaware that Yuu's modern tastes cannot handle the sweetness. She is a fan of the band How-Low-Hello and an avid admirer of Yusa. She eventually awakens an ability to cause anything around her <b>to</b> <b>suddenly</b> collapse, but this is stolen by Yuu to prevent her death.|$|E

5|$|Sawyer {{wakes up}} to find himself {{strapped}} to a table, where Ben, Tom (M. C. Gainey) and two other Others watch over him. Sawyer is gagged before inserting a large hypodermic needle into his chest. When Sawyer awakens, Ben enters, carrying a rabbit in a cage; he shakes the cage vigorously, causing the rabbit <b>to</b> <b>suddenly</b> collapse, presumably dead. Ben informs Sawyer that they fitted him, like the rabbit, with a modified pacemaker; should his heart rate reach 140, his heart would explode. Ben threatens to implant one in Kate if Sawyer should tell her of his ordeal.|$|E
5|$|The storm peaked {{early on}} July24 with winds of 160mph (260km/h) and a {{barometric}} pressure estimated at 920mbar (hPa; 27.17inHg). The following day, unknown factors caused the storm <b>to</b> <b>suddenly</b> weaken before increasing wind shear took over. The storm gradually weakened {{for the duration}} of its existence, turning slowly to the northwest. Late on July28, the storm brushed Johnston Atoll, bringing gusty winds and light rainfall to the region. Gilma persisted until July31 at which time it was downgraded to a tropical depression and dissipated over open waters.|$|E
5|$|A second {{scenario}} considers pressure increases during decompression {{that reduce}} bubble diameters. This can allow bubbles {{trapped in the}} lung during a normal decompression <b>to</b> <b>suddenly</b> pass through the capillaries and become responsible for Type II DCS symptoms. This could explain the difference in outcomes of in-water decompression versus surface decompression. Data collected in the North Sea have shown that if the overall incidence rate of the two diving methods is about the same, that surface decompression tends to produce ten times more type II DCS than in-water decompression. It is assumed that when the diver ascends to the surface, bubbles are produced that are trapped by the lung capillaries, and on recompression of the diver in the deck chamber, these bubbles are reduced in diameter and pass to the arterial side, later causing neurological symptoms. The same scenario was proposed for type II DCS recorded after sawtooth diving profiles or multiple repetitive dives.|$|E

5|$|Aoyama collapses {{from the}} drug. Asami injects {{him with a}} paralytic agent that leaves his nerves alert, and tortures him with needles. She tells him that just like {{everyone}} else in her life, he has failed to love only her. She cannot tolerate his feelings for anyone else, even his own son. She inserts needles into his eyes, giggling as she does so. She then cuts off his left foot with piano wire. Shigehiko returns home as Asami begins to cut off Aoyama's other foot, and she chases him upstairs. As she attacks the boy, Aoyama appears <b>to</b> <b>suddenly</b> wake up back in the hotel after he and Asami had sex, and his current ordeal seems to be only a nightmare; Aoyama proposes marriage and Asami accepts. As he falls back asleep in the hotel, he returns to find his son fighting back Asami, who is brandishing mace. Shigehiko kicks her downstairs, breaking her neck. Aoyama tells his son to call the police and stares at the dying Asami, who repeats what she said on one of their dates about her excitement on seeing him again.|$|E
5|$|The black currawong consumes {{the berries}} of the heath species Leptecophylla juniperina, and Astroloma humifusum, {{and the native}} sedge Gahnia grandis, as well as {{domestic}} pea, and apples. Invertebrates consumed include earthworms (Lumbricidae) and many types of insects, such as ants, moths, flies, crickets, grasshoppers and beetles like weevils, scarabs and leaf beetles. It is adaptable, and has learnt to eat the introduced European wasp (Vespula germanica). A bird that was being harassed by three scarlet robins (Petroica boodang) was seen <b>to</b> <b>suddenly</b> turn on them and catch and eat one. Other vertebrates recorded as prey include the house mouse (Mus musculus), small lizards, tadpoles, chickens, ducklings, the young of domestic turkey, Tasmanian nativehen (Gallinula mortierii), flame robin (Petroica phoenicea) and rabbit.|$|E
5|$|Yuu's {{younger sister}} Ayumi {{eventually}} awakens {{an ability to}} cause anything around her <b>to</b> <b>suddenly</b> collapse, which results in her death. Yuu falls into a deep depression as a result and isolates himself, but Nao successfully manages to pull {{him out of his}} depression and gets him to return to the student council. While attending a concert of the post-rock band Zhiend with Nao, Yuu recollects previously suppressed memories of his brother Shunsuke, who has the ability to time travel. Shunsuke had used this ability to establish Hoshinoumi Academy and an affiliated organization attempting to develop a vaccine to prevent children from developing abilities before they manifest, but repeated use leaves him blind. Yuu learns that the true nature of his ability enables him to steal someone's ability by possessing them. Yuu steals Shunsuke's ability to go back in time and ultimately prevent Ayumi's death by stealing her collapse ability before she can use it.|$|E

5|$|The pseudo-tracking shot {{in which}} the camera appears to {{approach}} the Man in the Moon was accomplished using an effect Méliès had invented the previous year for the film The Man with the Rubber Head. Rather than attempting to move his weighty camera toward an actor, he set a pulley-operated chair upon a rail-fitted ramp, placed the actor (covered up to the neck in black velvet) on the chair, and pulled him toward the camera. In addition to its technical practicality, this technique also allowed Méliès to control {{the placement of the}} face within the frame to a much greater degree of specificity than moving his camera allowed. A substitution splice allowed a model capsule <b>to</b> <b>suddenly</b> appear {{in the eye of the}} actor playing the Moon, completing the shot. Another notable sequence in the film, the plunge of the capsule into real ocean waves filmed on location, was created through multiple exposure, with a shot of the capsule falling in front of a black background superimposed upon the footage of the ocean. The shot is followed by an underwater glimpse of the capsule floating back to the surface, created by combining a moving cardboard cutout of the capsule with an aquarium containing tadpoles and air jets. The descent of the rocket from the Moon was covered in four shots, taking up about twenty seconds of film time.|$|E

25|$|The Chinese {{diaspora}} first reactivated its familial {{links in}} order to import low-priced goods such cups, forks, cellular phone, radio, television sets and umbrellas to Africa Indeed, African society has a screaming need for cheap goods in large quantities. China's manufacturing industry is truly complementary to African markets, often producing more cheaply than most African manufacturers can, and with better quality. Cheap Chinese clothes, and cheap Chinese cars at half the price of western ones allow African customers <b>to</b> <b>suddenly</b> raise up the purchasing power.|$|E
25|$|The Japanese heavy {{artillery}} in Mount Suribachi opened their reinforced steel doors to fire, and then closed them immediately to prevent counterfire from the Marines and naval gunners. This {{made it difficult}} for American units to destroy a Japanese artillery piece. To make matters worse for the Americans, the bunkers were connected to the elaborate tunnel system so that bunkers that were cleared with flamethrowers and grenades were reoccupied shortly afterwards by Japanese troops moving through the tunnels. This tactic caused many casualties among the Marines, as they walked past the reoccupied bunkers without expecting <b>to</b> <b>suddenly</b> take fresh fire from them.|$|E
25|$|The {{outbreak}} of the Greco-Italian War on 28 October 1940 forced Aspasia and Alexandra <b>to</b> <b>suddenly</b> leave the fascist Italy. They settled {{with the rest of}} the royal family in Athens. Eager to serve her country in this difficult moment, Aspasia engages in the Red Cross. However, after several months of victorious battles against the Italian forces, Greece was invaded by the army of the Nazi Germany and the majority of the members of the royal family leaves the country on 22 April 1941. After a brief stay in Crete, where they received a German bombing, Aspasia and her family depart for Egypt and South Africa.|$|E

25|$|Early designs {{including}} Siemens, Westinghouse, and Combustion Engineering had {{a mostly}} can-like shape built with reinforced concrete. As concrete {{has a very}} good compression strength compared to tensile, this is a logical design for the building materials since the extremely heavy top part of containment exerts a large downward force that prevents some tensile stress if containment pressure were <b>to</b> <b>suddenly</b> go up. As reactor designs have evolved, many nearly spherical containment designs for PWRs have also been constructed. Depending on the material used, this is the most apparently logical design because a sphere is the best structure for simply containing a large pressure. Most current PWR designs involve some combination of the two, with a cylindrical lower part and a half-spherical top.|$|E
25|$|The 2007 Burmese anti-government protests were {{a series}} of anti-government protests that started in Burma on 15 August 2007. The {{immediate}} cause of the protests was mainly the unannounced decision of the ruling junta, the State Peace and Development Council, to remove fuel subsidies, which caused the price of diesel and petrol <b>to</b> <b>suddenly</b> rise as much as 100%, {{and the price of}} compressed natural gas for buses to increase fivefold in less than a week. The protest demonstrations were at first dealt with quickly and harshly by the junta, with dozens of protesters arrested and detained. Starting 18 September, the protests had been led by thousands of Buddhist monks, and those protests had been allowed to proceed until a renewed government crackdown on 26 September.|$|E
25|$|After {{the perfect}} game, he seemed <b>to</b> <b>suddenly</b> lose effectiveness. It {{was the last}} shutout he would throw in his career. In 2000, he posted the worst record of his career, 4–14, while seeing his ERA balloon to 6.91, more than double his mark the {{previous}} year. In spite of his ineffectiveness, Cone was brought in during game four of the 2000 World Series to face the Mets' Mike Piazza, a controversial decision at the time— Denny Neagle had given up a home run to Piazza in his previous at-bat, but was pitching with a lead and only needed to retire Piazza to go the minimum five innings {{to be eligible for}} a win. Cone induced a pop-up to end the inning. It was the only batter he faced in the entire Series.|$|E
