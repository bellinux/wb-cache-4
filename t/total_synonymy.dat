40|$|This {{paper is}} devoted to the {{investigation}} of synonymy in Jordanian Arabic. It has been assumed that synonymy in Jordanian Arabic has partial rather than complete synonymy. This means that the abundance of Jordanian Arabic in synonyms can be attributed to a number of explanations, namely dialectical variations, the speaker’s attitude, and origin of words. The data for this study come from two main sources: written and spoken material. In accordance with the established literature on the semantics of synonymy, we have classified the corpus of the study {{on the basis of these}} parameters. The main findings reveal that <b>total</b> <b>synonymy</b> is hard to find in Jordanian Arabic, supporting the argument of many linguistic studies for the existence of partial rather than <b>total</b> <b>synonymy</b> in a language.   Keywords: dialectical variations, evaluative meaning, origin of words, semantics, synonym...|$|E
40|$|Synonymy" is {{a subject}} that has raised the {{interest}} of researchers and thinkers all along the history of linguistics. As {{a result of the}} various theoretical approaches, ever since Classical times, different criteria for the delimitation of synonyms have been applied. These criteria have originated a whole range of clearly faced positions, going from those which without doubt defend its existence to those which absolutely deny it. Among the reasons that cause such distinct positions, the similarity of meaning requisite can be specially emphasized. Proposed by several authors as a means for the establishment of synonyms, it has therefore led to a lax definition of synonymy as a similarity of meaning, also designated as parasynonymy, quasisynonymy or partial synonymy. Nevertheless, we believe that the characterization of synonyms from a lexical point of view as meanings that are semantically alike involves a confusion between them and other lexical units, such as parasynonyms or hyperonyms-hyponyms. As a central hypothesis, we maintain that parasynonymy is a lexical relationship between very close semantically meanings, which constitute a non-neutralizable equipollent opposition between its terms. Therefore, the most important aim of our doctoral thesis is to grant parasynonymy, independent of synonymy, an equal status of lexical relationship as the one found in hyperonymy-hyponymy and antonymy. That is why, with the purpose of rendering different approaches to the subject, we have started out from a historiographic revision of both <b>total</b> and partial <b>synonymy,</b> which, on the one hand, has led us to a conceptual and terminological delimitation of parasynonymy and, on the other hand, has allowed us to establish criteria for the definition of this relation. These criteria provide the basis for our own classification of parasynonymic meanings, {{as can be seen in}} its application to a representative sample of parasynonyms in the Spanish language. 535 p...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe current {{revision}} provisionally lists 77 valid earthworm taxa {{in seven}} families from Japan, with approximately 80 further names (ca. 50 % of the <b>total)</b> either in <b>synonymy</b> – including 40 new synonyms – or retained as species incertae sedis. Generic {{placement of the}} species yielded 17 new combinations. About 30 species are known introductions and another ten are possibly more widespread, thus the probable number of wholly endemic Japanese earthworms is around 40 species (ca. 50 % of the total valid species). However, a definitive work on the systematics of Japan's earthworms is pending, and the current revision aims only to provide a status quo and to track changes from the last comprehensive revision by Easton (1981) that listed 74 taxa. Subsequently, 60 or so new pheretimoid names were added by Ishizuka in 1999 – 2001, {{but only a few}} are considered valid taxa, the remainder being synonyms or species incertae sedis. The substitute name ‘Pheretima’ palarva, nom. nov., is provided for the junior homonym Pheretima parvula Ishizuka et al., 2000. While much of Easton's synopsis is supported, Pontodrilus is now placed in Megascolecidae sensu Blakemore (2000) rather than Acanthodrilidae sensu Gates (1959); Amynthas carnosus (Goto & Hatai, 1899) is removed from synonymy with Amynthas gracilis; and an informal Amynthas corticis species-complex is established to accommodate the various morphs of this widely distributed species group. Pheretima (Parapheretima) koellikeri Michaelsen, 1928 is considered synonymous with Metaphire vesiculata (Goto & Hatai, 1899), thereby removing the genus Pheretima sensu stricto from the Japanese list. Polypheretima is also removed from Japanese indigeny, as the original description of Polypheretima iizukai (Goto & Hatai, 1899) failed to report intestinal caeca, and inspection of fresh material allows its placement in synonymy with Amynthas fuscatus (Goto & Hatai, 1898). Easton (1981) had listed this taxon as Metaphire fuscata, but further demonstration of superficial male pores qualifies it for Amynthas. Conversely, the discovery of copulatory pouches results in transfer from Amynthas to Metaphire for M. hilgendorfi (Michaelsen, 1892), comb. nov., Metaphire communissima (Goto & Hatai, 1898), comb. nov., and Metaphire megascolidioides (Goto & Hatai, 1899), comb. nov. The Metaphire hilgendorfi/Amynthas tokioensis species-complex (Amynthas hilgendorfi species-complex sensu Easton 1981) {{remains one of the most}} intractable and pressing problems for comprehension of the Japanese fauna, as most of the component taxa, e. g. Metaphire agrestis (Goto & Hatai, 1899), are parthenogenetically degraded morphs as yet unaffiliated with their ancestral and biparental populations. Resolution may be sought employing combinations of morphological and molecular (RNA, DNA) techniques to determine specific affinities while also complying with requirements of the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN 1999) ...|$|R
