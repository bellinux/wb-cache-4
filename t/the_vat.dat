5|$|Only about 6% of {{the salt}} {{manufactured}} {{in the world is}} used in food. Of the remainder, 12% is used in water conditioning processes, 8% goes for de-icing highways and 6% is used in agriculture. The rest (68%) is used for manufacturing and other industrial processes, and sodium chloride {{is one of the largest}} inorganic raw materials used by volume. Its major chemical products are caustic soda and chlorine, which are separated by the electrolysis of a pure brine solution. These are used in the manufacture of PVC, plastics, paper pulp and many other inorganic and organic compounds. Salt is also used as a flux in the production of aluminium. For this purpose, a layer of melted salt floats on top of the molten metal and removes iron and other metal contaminants. It is also used in the manufacture of soaps and glycerine, where it is added to <b>the</b> <b>vat</b> to precipitate out the saponified products. As an emulsifier, salt is used in the manufacture of synthetic rubber, and another use is in the firing of pottery, when salt added to the furnace vaporises before condensing onto the surface of the ceramic material, forming a strong glaze.|$|E

5|$|Water clocks, or clepsydrae, were {{commonly}} used in Ancient Greece following their introduction by Plato, who also invented a water-based alarm clock. One account of Plato's alarm clock describes it as depending on the nightly overflow of a vessel containing lead balls, which floated in a columnar vat. <b>The</b> <b>vat</b> held a steadily increasing amount of water, supplied by a cistern. By morning, the vessel would have floated high enough to tip over, causing the lead balls to cascade onto a copper platter. The resultant clangor would then awaken Plato's students at the Academy. Another possibility is that it comprised two jars, connected by a siphon. Water emptied until it reached the siphon, which transported the water to the other jar. There, the rising water would force air through a whistle, sounding an alarm. The Greeks and Chaldeans regularly maintained timekeeping records as {{an essential part of}} their astronomical observations.|$|E

50|$|On {{the north}} side of Bar Head is Stage Island Pool, a fresh-water pond created on the vestiges of a 19th-century salt works. It is named after Stage Island, the esker that forms its {{northern}} border. <b>The</b> drying <b>vats</b> stood where <b>the</b> pool now stands; gravel was mined from the hill to place a circular protective access road around what is now the pool area. Within it was a canal and within that <b>the</b> <b>vats.</b> A dike was placed across the mouth of what was then Bar Island Creek (now non-existent) dividing it from Stage Island Creek and creating an impoundment in the canals, kept full by several pump-up windmills and a treadmill. Water was periodically channeled from the canal to <b>the</b> drying <b>vats.</b> <b>The</b> salt works was not profitable and did not last long. The dike was kept, behind which fresh-water runoff drowned <b>the</b> <b>vats</b> and <b>the</b> canal, creating a convenient refuge for birds.|$|R

25|$|The {{advantage}} of <b>the</b> <b>VAT</b> system over {{the sales tax}} system is that under sales tax, the seller has no incentive to disbelieve a purchaser who says {{it is not a}} final user. That is to say the payer of the tax has no incentive to collect the tax. Under VAT, all sellers collect tax and pay it to the government. A purchaser has an incentive to deduct input VAT, but must prove it has the right to do so, which is usually achieved by holding an invoice quoting <b>the</b> <b>VAT</b> paid on the purchase, and indicating <b>the</b> <b>VAT</b> registration number of the supplier.|$|E
25|$|In principle, all {{sales of}} goods and {{services}} are liable to VAT. However, some supplies are exempt (without a credit for input tax), which means that such supplies fall entirely outside the scope of <b>the</b> <b>VAT</b> Act.

40|$|Microsimulation {{models are}} apt to be the {{preferred}} instrument when applied, equality analyses of tax reforms in specific economies are undertaken. However, most of these models ignore general equilibrium effects, like changes in prices, and may therefore miss valuable information because of their partial nature. In this paper we combine a microsimulation model and a CGE model through feeding of CGE results on producer prices, pre-tax nominal incomes, wealth and transfers into the microsimulation model. The two main reforms studied are substitution of a uniform VAT rate on all goods and services (called <b>the</b> general <b>VAT</b> reform) and substitution of <b>the</b> non-uniform Norwegian <b>VAT</b> reform of 2001 (called <b>the</b> political <b>VAT</b> reform) for <b>the</b> previous, differentiated system. We find {{that the degree of}} equality is clearly increased with <b>the</b> political <b>VAT</b> reform and unchanged with <b>the</b> general <b>VAT</b> reform. Comparing these results with the case where CGE effects are not taken into account, i. e. a "traditional" microsimulation analysis, we find that equality is still increased with <b>the</b> political <b>VAT</b> reform while equality is now also increased with <b>the</b> general <b>VAT</b> reform instead of being unchangedmicro-macro links, indirect taxation, VAT reforms, Equality...|$|R
