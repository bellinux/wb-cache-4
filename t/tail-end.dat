5|$|After the Headingley Test, Loxton {{came in at}} 5/344 {{and made}} an attacking 51 as Australia batted first and made 456 against Derbyshire. He then took 1/27 from 17.4 overs in the first innings. Australia {{enforced}} the follow on and Loxton took the first wicket before returning to take two <b>tail-end</b> wickets and end with 3/16 from 13.4 overs as Australia won by an innings. Loxton was the most economical of the Australian wicket-takers. After six consecutive matches, Loxton was rested for the rain-affected draw against Glamorgan, which did not reach the second innings. The hosts were bowled out for 197 and Australia reached 3/215 when inclement weather ended the match.|$|E
5|$|Another {{interpretation}} is that megalodon bore a similarity to the whale shark (Rhincodon typus) or the basking shark (Cetorhinus maximus). The tail fin {{would have been}} crescent-shaped, the anal fin and second dorsal fin would have been small, and {{there would have been}} a caudal keel present on either side of the tail fin (on the caudal peduncle). This build is common in other large aquatic animals, such as whales, tuna, and other sharks, in order to reduce drag while swimming. The head shape, however, can vary between species as most of the drag-reducing adaptations are toward the <b>tail-end</b> of the animal.|$|E

40|$|This study {{presents}} {{a method to}} discover an outbreak of an infectious disease in a region for which data are missing, but which is at work as a disease spreader. Node discovery for the spread of an infectious disease is defined as discriminating between the nodes which are neighboring to a missing disease spreader node, and the rest, given a dataset {{on the number of}} cases. The spread is described by stochastic differential equations. A perturbation theory quantifies the impact of the missing spreader on the moments of the number of cases. Statistical discriminators examine the mid-body or <b>tail-ends</b> of the probability density function, and search for the disturbance from the missing spreader. They are tested with computationally synthesized datasets, and applied to the SARS outbreak and flu pandemic. Comment: in pres...|$|R
5|$|Starting the {{day after}} the First Test, the Northamptonshire match was {{interrupted}} by rain. Northamptonshire batted first and collapsed to 7/61 before some <b>tail-end</b> resistance took them to 119; Johnston and Johnson took three wickets each. The Australians passed the locals' score on the first afternoon, and their innings was built around Hassett's 127, which included 17 fours. Morris and McCool also made fifties. Northamptonshire made 169 runs in their second innings, Johnston and Ring taking four wickets each. In neither of the county innings did any player reach 50.|$|E
5|$|A broad area of low {{pressure}} formed at the <b>tail-end</b> of a stationary front, organizing into a tropical depression by 18:00UTC on October28 about 520mi (835km) south-southeast of Bermuda. Steered west-northwest and then sharply northeast ahead {{of an approaching}} cold front, the system intensified into Tropical Storm Shary six hours after formation. Within an environment of low wind shear, Shary strengthened into a hurricane and attained peak winds of 75mph (120km/h) by 00:00UTC on October30 as an eye became apparent on microwave imagery. The storm became increasingly asymmetric as it interacted with the front, and Shary transitioned into an extratropical cyclone by 18:00UTC that day. The extratropical system was completely absorbed by the front six hours later. Since Shary remained south and east of Bermuda, its effects were limited to 0.54in (13.7mm) of rainfall and a gust to 35mph (56km/h).|$|E
5|$|On September5, {{a frontal}} trough, the same {{responsible}} for the extratropical transition of Tropical Storm Lee, passed through the western Gulf of Mexico before stalling in the central Gulf of Mexico and Bay of Campeche. At the <b>tail-end</b> of the trough, increased shower and thunderstorm activity associated with a developing low-pressure area prompted the National Hurricane Center (NHC) to begin monitoring the disturbance for tropical cyclone formation the next day. The low separated from the front early on September7, but convection was too disorganized for classification at the time. By 1800UTC, however, a curved band developed in the western semicircle of the circulation. In accordance with satellite imagery, surface observations from land and oil rigs, and data from a reconnaissance aircraft, the disturbance was upgraded to Tropical Storm Nate, positioned roughly 160mi (260km) north of Villahermosa, Mexico.|$|E
40|$|Polymeric strip {{reinforced}} soil walls {{require a}} practical method {{to fix the}} reinforcement <b>tail-ends</b> in the soil backfill during construction to ensure adequate anchorage and to avoid any slack along the linear reinforcement elements. A number of different techniques are currently used depending on the reinforcement type, arrangement and the contractor. This paper reports {{the results of a}} series of numerical simulations that were carried out on an idealized 6 m-high wall with precast partial height facing panels. A different reinforcement pre-tension load was applied to the layers in each simulation case. The results of numerical simulations include the reinforcement axial load distribution, vertical facing load and end-of-construction facing alignment plotted {{as a function of the}} reinforcement layer depth location and applied pre-tension load. The results demonstrate that the magnitude of pre-tensioning has a significant effect on wall performance for walls subjected to operational (working stress) conditions at end of construction.

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we {{highlight}} some enumerative results concerning matroids of low rank and prove the <b>tail-ends</b> of various sequences involving {{the number of}} matroids on a finite set to be log-convex. We give a recursion for a new, slightly improved, lower bound {{on the number of}} rank-r matroids on n elements when n = 2 m − 1. We also prove an adjacent result showing the point-lines-planes conjecture to be true if and only if it is true for a special sub-collection of matroids. Two new tables are also presented, giving the number of paving matroids on at most eight elements. 1. Definitions Let Sn be a finite set of size n. A matroid M is a pair M(Sn, B) such that B is a non-empty collection of subsets of Sn satisfying the following basis-exchange property: ∀ X,Y ∈ B, ∀x ∈ X − Y, ∃y ∈ Y − X s. t X − {x} ∪ {y} ∈ B. Sn is called the ground set of the matroid and B the collection of bases. A consequence of this axiom is that all sets in B have the same cardinality, called the rank of the matroid. The collection of independent sets of M is I(M) = {I: I ⊆ B,B ∈ B(M) }. An element x ∈ Sn is called a loop if {x} ̸ ∈ I(M). If for every pair of distinct elements {x,y} ⊆ Sn there exists I ∈ I(M) s. t. I ⊇ {x,y}, then M is called a simple. Le...|$|R
40|$|Thoroughbred horses {{have been}} {{selected}} for exceptional racing performance resulting in system-wide structural and functional adaptations contributing to elite athletic phenotypes. Because selection has been recent and intense in a closed population that stems from {{a small number of}} founder animals Thoroughbreds represent a unique population within which to identify genomic contributions to exercise-related traits. Employing a population genetics-based hitchhiking mapping approach we performed a genome scan using 394 autosomal and X chromosome microsatellite loci and identified positively selected loci in the extreme <b>tail-ends</b> of the empirical distributions for (1) deviations from expected heterozygosity (Ewens-Watterson test) in Thoroughbred (n = 112) and (2) global differentiation among four geographically diverse horse populations (F(ST)). We found positively selected genomic regions in Thoroughbred enriched for phosphoinositide-mediated signalling (3. 2 -fold enrichment; P< 0. 01), insulin receptor signalling (5. 0 -fold enrichment; P< 0. 01) and lipid transport (2. 2 -fold enrichment; P< 0. 05) genes. We found a significant overrepresentation of sarcoglycan complex (11. 1 -fold enrichment; P< 0. 05) and focal adhesion pathway (1. 9 -fold enrichment; P< 0. 01) genes highlighting the role for muscle strength and integrity in the Thoroughbred athletic phenotype. We report for the first time candidate athletic-performance genes within regions targeted by selection in Thoroughbred horses that are principally responsible for fatty acid oxidation, increased insulin sensitivity and muscle strength: ACSS 1 (acyl-CoA synthetase short-chain family member 1), ACTA 1 (actin, alpha 1, skeletal muscle), ACTN 2 (actinin, alpha 2), ADHFE 1 (alcohol dehydrogenase, iron containing, 1), MTFR 1 (mitochondrial fission regulator 1), PDK 4 (pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, isozyme 4) and TNC (tenascin C). Understanding the genetic basis for exercise adaptation will be crucial for the identification of genes within the complex molecular networks underlying obesity and its consequential pathologies, such as type 2 diabetes. Therefore, we propose Thoroughbred as a novel in vivo large animal model for understanding molecular protection against metabolic disease...|$|R
5|$|Since winning {{back-to-back}} Shields in 2006 and 2007, {{the club}} failed {{to qualify for}} the MLS Cup Playoffs five years in a row. During this stretch, United's lone major title came in 2008, when they won the U.S. Open Cup. In league play during the 2008 and 2009 campaigns, United faltered at the <b>tail-end</b> of each season, ultimately causing them to miss out on the playoffs. They had a poor 2010 MLS season, winning only six matches, drawing four and losing 20. In 2011, United again failed {{to qualify for the}} playoffs in the second to last week of the campaign.

5|$|Miller {{declined}} the offer and stopped. The match resumed {{the next day}} and the West Indies were eventually bowled out 158 behind. Miller had been punished by the batsmen, taking 2/113 from 22overs. Miller scored 10 and took 1/66 in the second innings as the match ended in a high-scoring draw. Miller then took 6/107 in the first innings of the Fifth Test in Jamaica. He removed John Holt, Walcott and Smith, before taking three <b>tail-end</b> wickets as the home team were bowled out for 357. When Australia batted, Miller arrived at the crease to join Harvey with the score at 3/302. He added his third century of the series and ended with 109 as Australia reached 8/758. He took 2/58 in the second innings as Australia completed a 3–0 win. It was Miller's most statistically successful series, with 439runs at 73.17 and the 20wickets at 32.05 made him the equal leading wicket-taker along with Lindwall.|$|E
5|$|NY5 {{enters the}} city of Utica on a {{concurrency}} with NY12 heading in a northeast direction. It shortly picks up NY8, and all three cross the city together. NY5 also intersects with the terminus of NY840 at this point. Just south of the New York State Thruway, I-790 begins as a short expressway, also including NY5, NY8, and NY12. After crossing out of the city, they meet the Thruway, with NY8 and12 continuing northeast, while I-790 and NY5 turn to the east-south-east, picking up the <b>tail-end</b> of NY49. These three, still as an expressway, straddle {{each side of the}} Thruway for a short way, with I-790 technically ending at the ramps for I-90. NY5 continues {{to the end of the}} expressway, only a few hundred feet later, dropping to Leland Avenue. A few hundred feet to the north of the Thruway, NY5 turns eastward again to continue down Herkimer Road. It closely parallels the Thruway all the way to Herkimer, where NY5 moves slightly northward through the center of the village, becoming State Street, while I-90 crosses the Erie Canal and goes south for a short distance. There is a short concurrency with NY28 in the village.|$|E
5|$|Morris was {{out soon}} after for 105 runs with the score at 166/3, having struck 14 fours and one six. His innings, which was noted for powerful, well-placed cover drives, ended {{when he hit}} Coxon to Hutton in the gully. Miller came in and Bedser bowled three {{consecutive}} outswingers to him. A fourth ball swung the other way, and Miller did not offer a shot, expecting the ball to curve away and miss the stumps. Instead, he was hit {{in front of the}} wickets and given out lbw for four. O'Reilly said Miller's display was more akin to that of a <b>tail-end</b> batsman with minimal skill, and blamed his poor form with the bat on an excessive workload imposed on him by Bradman. With two quick wickets, England had put the match back in the balance. Batting out of position in the middle-order, Brown came in at 173/4 and helped Hassett to rebuild the innings. Both scored slowly, averaging more than three and a half minutes for each run. They realised Australia could not afford to lose any more wickets quickly and batted with extreme caution, reluctant even to attack long hops. Hassett was dropped three times before Yardley, who was bowling mainly in order to allow his frontline bowlers to recuperate, broke through his defences with a yorker. The English skipper trapped Brown lbw nine runs later to leave Australia at 225/6. Brown had hit two consecutive half-volleys off his pads through the leg side for four, and attempted a third boundary in a row to a similar delivery. However, this third delivery came off the pitch more quickly and beat Brown for pace.|$|E
5|$|On {{the first}} {{ball of the}} third morning, Miller hooked {{the ball into the}} crowd, landing {{just in front of the}} governor's VIP box to move to 39. He quickly {{accumulated}} another 61 runs in 71 minutes to reach his maiden Test century. Miller and Johnson added a further 79 runs in the morning, of which the latter contributed only 17 before being dismissed for 52, such was Miller's rate of scoring. Miller did not play more expansively after reaching triple figures, as three wickets fell at the other end for 24 runs and the Englishmen, particularly Yardley, utilised leg theory to stifle the scoring. As the English bowlers continued to regularly take <b>tail-end</b> wickets, Miller accelerated again, launching drives into the crowd as England stationed four men on the fence waiting in vain to catch one of his lofted strokes. Miller ended unbeaten on 141 from 198 balls as Australia took a first innings lead, but the match petered into a high-scoring draw. In the second innings, Miller and Lindwall unsuccessfully tried to attack Hutton and Washbrook with bouncers as the English openers registered a century partnership. Miller took Bedser's wicket to end with 1/34 from 11 overs as England reached 8/340 before declaring. Miller was not required to bat after Australia were set 314 runs to win in 195 minutes; they reached 1/215 when time ran out.|$|E
