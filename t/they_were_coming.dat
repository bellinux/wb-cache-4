Burbridge's front regiment easily pushed back Witcher's small regiment, who stopped {{just so they}} could fire a volley into the Union cavalry. They then continued to retreat toward Marion.

5|$|I {{remember}} {{when they came}} to record 'Spice Up Your Life'. It {{was in the middle of}} the chaos. It had been booked in, that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>coming</b> in to record their next single, and write it, with us. It was at Whitfield Street Studios and there was going to be an MTV crew there filming them as they did this, which there was. Well, how on earth can you possibly do this? You can't write and record a song in half-an-hour with a film crew watching.|$|E
5|$|Upon their arrival, {{many were}} in disbelief that the Rockets could thrive in Houston. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>coming</b> {{to a city}} {{that did not have}} a {{suitable}} arena, and had not shown much interest in professional basketball. Houston was previously home to the Houston Mavericks of the American Basketball Association for only two seasons between 1967 and 1969, where the average attendance was only 200. The city's largest indoor arena was 34-year-old Sam Houston Coliseum, but the Rockets quickly ruled out playing there even on a temporary basis. As the team owners planned out on building a proper arena, the Rockets were forced to play most of their games at the University of Houston's Hofheinz Pavilion, while playing occasional games at the Astrodome and San Antonio's HemisFair Arena.|$|E

5|$|If tanks or a {{large number}} of troops were seen passing, they would radio the LRDG {{headquarters}} at Siwa immediately so that by the time the enemy reached the front line, GHQ at Cairo would know <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>coming.</b> Once a patrol was relieved they would transmit details of all they had seen back to Siwa. The LRDG did not lose any men or vehicles when on the road watch, but they did have some close encounters. On 21 March 'R1' Patrol was surrounded by a convoy of 27 vehicles and about 200 men who stopped for the night between the watchers and their vehicles. While the road watch was ongoing, other patrols would be attacking targets along other stretches of the Tripoli to Benghazi road, by planting mines or attacking vehicles with machine gun fire. The road was kept under constant observation around the clock from 2 March to 21 July 1942.|$|E
25|$|Historian Nasser Hussain {{says that}} many Iranians fled their native {{country in the}} early 20th century due to a law king Reza Shah issued which banned women from wearing the hijab, or because they feared for their lives after {{fighting}} the English, or to find jobs. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>coming</b> to Bahrain from Bushehr and the Fars province between 1920 and 1940. In the 1920s, local Persian merchants were prominently involved in the consolidation of Bahrain's first powerful lobby with connections to the municipality in effort to contest the municipal legislation of British control.|$|E
25|$|Native {{legend of}} the Lil'wat {{subgroup}} of the St'at'imc tells of a girl named Chinook-Wind, who married Glacier, and moved to his country, {{which was in the}} area of today's Birkenhead River. She pined for her warm sea-home in the southwest, and sent a message to her people. They came to her in a vision in the form of snowflakes, and told her <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>coming</b> to get her. They came in great number and quarrelled with Glacier over her, but they overwhelmed him and she went home with them in the end.|$|E

25|$|By February 2007, {{the land}} swap {{agreement}} {{still had not}} been finalized. The zoning changes had not occurred, although city officials pledged <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>coming.</b> No agreement over parking garage management had been signed, either. The city declined {{to get involved in}} operation of the hotel, and advised Gould to negotiate with Marriott about parking garage management. The long negotiations triggered the late-fee clause that required the city to pay Gould $2.2 million. This, too, delayed the swap, since payment of fees greater than $1 million required city council approval. In September, Gould and the city public accused each other of stalling the deal.|$|E

You get the individual personalities of all five members, the infectious togetherness of the group at large, and most importantly, the sense that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>coming</b> to absolutely blast through American pop music and mess up everything we previously thought we knew." ...|$|E
500|$|Exterior {{shots of}} the town were filmed on {{location}} in Steveston, British Columbia—a location which had previously {{been used in the}} earlier first season episode [...] "Gender Bender". Scenes set in the home of Reverend Hartley were shot in a mansion in the Langley area, with the crew taking advantage of an old filled-in swimming pool in the building to set up the necessary equipment. All of the scenes set in the faith healer's tent were filmed in one day, and involved over three hundred extras. Producer R. W. Goodwin felt that the greatest difficulty in creating the episode was the challenge in finding enough actors in the Vancouver area who could portray a convincing Southern United States accent, leading to the hiring of a dialect coach to prevent the cast from sounding [...] "like <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>coming</b> from fifteen different parts of the South".|$|E

500|$|Given {{the legal}} system's {{affirmation}} of its position, the SP began to forcibly {{remove some of}} the settlers. Their agents would attempt to serve eviction notices, but often would not find anyone at home, as homeowners knew <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>coming.</b> In these cases, the agents then tried removing the furniture from the homes, but the Settler's League would just put the furniture back after the agents' departure. Finally, it escalated to {{the point at which the}} agents would then disassemble the houses, but again, volunteers would just put them back together. The settlers were not above their own brand of justice, either. People who had purchased land from those forced to sell would be harassed by locals, and in one case one farmer who had aligned with the SP had his house burned down. Those supporting the railroads tended to be wealthier than the others, deriding the Settler's League as [...] "a set of demagogues" [...] who were [...] "very anxious to get something for nothing." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Bye Bye Baby" [...] {{was written}} by Madonna, Shep Pettibone and Anthony Shimkin and was {{produced}} by Madonna and Pettibone. The song was recorded at Sound Works Studios in Astoria, New York, and samples a hook from LL Cool J's single, [...] "Jingling Baby" [...] (1990). Pettibone also did the sequencing, the keyboard arrangement and the programming for the track with Shimkin. Dennis Mitchell and Robin Hancock were the recording engineers for the track while George Karras was the mixing engineer. Ted Jensen did the mastering for the song with Mark Goodman as assistant engineer. Background vocals were provided by Niki Haris and Donna DeLory. For [...] "Bye Bye Baby", Madonna and Pettibone wanted a 1940s theme, which would make the vocals sound as if <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>coming</b> out of an antique radio. In order to achieve that, they used a Pultec HLF filter. Shimkin recalled that the vocals for [...] "Bye Bye Baby" [...] were from the first take. He added that the filtered vocal effect were applied during recording and played with while Madonna {{was in front of}} the microphone singing.|$|E
500|$|At around 02:00 on {{the morning}} of Monday, December 14, 1998, 140 KLA militants tried to {{illegally}} cross the Albanian–Yugoslav border between the outposts of Gorožup and Liken, about [...] west of Pristina. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>coming</b> from a base inside Albania, where they had been training. The subsequent ambush occurred near the village of Kušnin, just west of Prizren. The militants had been trying to illegally smuggle weapons, ammunition and supplies to be used by KLA fighters in Kosovo. A member of the KVM told reporters that the militants encountered a Yugoslav sentry post and were attacked by the guards. One of the militants was killed instantly, and the column started retreating back into Albania. As the militants turned back, they were ambushed and another 25 were killed. The bodies of five other militants were soon discovered not far from the site of the ambush, raising the KLA casualty figure to 31. Fighting between the militants and the border guards continued for about five hours. Gunfire and explosions could reportedly be heard in three nearby villages. By 07:00, a total of 36 militants had been killed, twelve were wounded and a further nine were captured. The militants who were not killed or captured either managed to flee back to Albania or went into hiding along the border, according to a KVM monitor. The Yugoslavs reported they had suffered no casualties, and stated that large quantities of [...] "modern weapons", ammunition and supplies had been seized.|$|E

2500|$|Within Israel, {{policies}} of its government {{are subjected to}} criticism by its press {{as well as a}} variety of political, human rights and watchdog groups, which include Association for Civil Rights in Israel (ACRI), B'Tselem, Machsom Watch, Women in Black and Women for Israel's Tomorrow. According to the press freedom organization Reporters Without Borders, [...] "The Israeli media were once again in 2005 the only ones in the region that had genuine freedom to speak out." [...] However, in 2010, human rights groups operating in Israel complained of a hostile environment in the country, and said <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>coming</b> under attack for criticising Israeli policies.

On 10 November 2014, a major faction of the Egyptian militant group Ansar Bait al-Maqdis also pledged its allegiance to ISIL. In mid-January 2015, a Yemeni official said that ISIL had [...] "dozens" [...] of members in Yemen, and that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>coming</b> into direct competition with al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula because of their recruitment drive. The same month, Afghan officials confirmed that ISIL had a military presence in Afghanistan. However, by February 2015, 65 of the militants were either captured or killed by the Taliban, and ISIL's top Afghan recruiter, Mullah Abdul Rauf, was killed in a US drone strike.|$|E
