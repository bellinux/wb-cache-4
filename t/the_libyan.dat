5|$|The {{pattern of}} the war {{delineated}} itself in 1978, with the Libyans providing armour, artillery and air support and their Chadian allies the infantry, which assumed {{the bulk of the}} scouting and fighting. This pattern was radically changed in 1986, {{towards the end of the}} war, when most Chadian forces united in opposing <b>the</b> <b>Libyan</b> occupation of northern Chad with a degree of unity that had never been seen before in Chad. This deprived <b>the</b> <b>Libyan</b> forces of their habitual infantry, exactly when they found themselves confronting a mobile army, well provided now with anti-tank and anti-air missiles, thus cancelling <b>the</b> <b>Libyan</b> superiority in firepower. What followed was the Toyota War, in which <b>the</b> <b>Libyan</b> forces were routed and expelled from Chad, putting an end to the conflict.|$|E
5|$|Habré started, on 2 January 1987, his reconquest of {{northern}} Chad with a successful {{attack on the}} well-defended Libyan communications base of Fada. Against <b>the</b> <b>Libyan</b> army the Chadian commander Hassan Djamous {{conducted a series of}} swift pincer movements, enveloping <b>the</b> <b>Libyan</b> positions and crushing them with sudden attacks from all sides. This strategy was repeated by Djamous in March in the battles of B'ir Kora and Ouadi Doum, inflicting crushing losses and forcing Gaddafi to evacuate northern Chad.|$|E

50|$|Herodotus {{also stated}} that Poseidon (an {{important}} Greek sea god) was adopted from <b>the</b> <b>Libyans</b> by <b>the</b> Greeks.

5|$|An attack {{started on}} 6 December, spearheaded by Soviet T-54 and T-55 tanks and {{reportedly}} coordinated by advisors from the Soviet Union and East Germany, brought {{the fall of}} the capital on 16 December. <b>The</b> <b>Libyan</b> force, numbering between 7,000 and 9,000 men of regular units and the paramilitary Pan-African Islamic Legion, 60 tanks, and other armored vehicles, had been ferried across 1,100 kilometers of desert from Libya's southern border, partly by airlift and tank transporters and partly under its own power. The border itself was 1,000 to 1,100 kilometers from Libya's main bases on the Mediterranean coast. Wright states that <b>the</b> <b>Libyan</b> intervention demonstrated an impressive logistical ability, and provided Gaddafi with his first military victory and a substantial political achievement.|$|E
5|$|Apparently formidable, <b>the</b> <b>Libyan</b> {{military}} disposition in Chad was {{marred by}} serious flaws. The Libyans were prepared for a war {{in which they would}} provide ground and air support to their Chadian allies, act as assault infantry, and provide reconnaissance. By 1987, however, Muammar Gaddafi had lost his allies, exposing Libya's inadequate knowledge of the area. Libyan garrisons came to resemble isolated and vulnerable islands in the Chadian Sahara. Also important was the low morale among the troops, who were fighting in a foreign country, and the structural disorganization of <b>the</b> <b>Libyan</b> army, which was in part induced by Gaddafi's fear of a military coup against him. This fear led him to avoid the professionalization of the armed forces.|$|E
25|$|The Italians did {{not provide}} <b>the</b> <b>Libyans</b> with {{adequate}} education or improved native administration, the Italian population (about 10% of the total population) had 81 elementary schools in 1939-1940, while <b>the</b> <b>Libyans</b> (more than 85% of total population) had 97.|$|R
50|$|The airline was {{implicated in}} a mooted deal with Libya, under which <b>the</b> <b>Libyans</b> would paint Boeing {{aircraft}} belonging to Libyan Arab Airlines in Air Rwanda livery. The {{purpose of the}} deal was to allow <b>the</b> <b>Libyans</b> to skirt an embargo and {{to gain access to}} spare parts for the aircraft. The possible deal came to light when the United States gained photos of some Libyan aircraft being repainted in Air Rwanda livery, after which the Rwandans cancelled talks with <b>the</b> <b>Libyans.</b>|$|R

50|$|Consequently, when, on October 22, French President François Mitterrand {{proposed}} {{to send an}} Organisation of African Unity peace contingent into Chad to replace <b>the</b> <b>Libyans,</b> Goukouni and <b>the</b> GUNT asked <b>the</b> <b>Libyans</b> to leave immediately Chad (not without debate: 4 ministers, among whom Acyl, voted against the decision). Gaddafi rapidly complied, and the OAU troops; but these proved ineffectual.|$|R
50|$|He {{first moved}} out of Burkina Faso in 2007 to North Africa and more {{accurately}} to Libya where he signed a three-year contract with Tripoli's Al-Ittihad Club.

Ribas-Dominicci and his weapons systems officer, Captain Paul F. Lorence, were the only U.S. casualties. Al-Qaddafi, who was also personally targeted, escaped harm, but his daughter was killed.|$|E
5|$|Al-Qassam {{studied at}} Al-Azhar University in Egypt and {{afterward}} became an Islamic revivalist preacher {{in his hometown}} of Jableh in Syria during the last years of Ottoman rule. Following his return, he became an active supporter of <b>the</b> <b>Libyan</b> resistance to Italian rule, raising funds and fighters to aid the Libyans and penning an anthem for them. He would later lead his own group of rebels in alliance with Ibrahim Hananu to fight against French Mandatory forces in northern Syria in 1919–20.|$|E
5|$|Alexander {{advanced}} on Egypt {{in later}} 332BC, {{where he was}} regarded as a liberator. He was pronounced son of the deity Amun at the Oracle of Siwa Oasis in <b>the</b> <b>Libyan</b> desert. Henceforth, Alexander often referred to Zeus-Ammon as his true father, and after his death, currency depicted him adorned with rams horn as a symbol of his divinity. During his stay in Egypt, he founded Alexandria-by-Egypt, which would become the prosperous capital of the Ptolemaic Kingdom after his death.|$|E
50|$|The new Greek {{immigrants}} {{may have}} founded Apollonia. The city became the region’s port city (modern Susah, Libya). Cyrenaica’s population began to increase {{and they began}} to encroach upon the territory of <b>the</b> <b>Libyans.</b> <b>The</b> <b>Libyans</b> and their King Adicran, had resented the Greek settlers because they took their land and they had enough of the domineering attitude of the Greeks.|$|R

5|$|All {{this changed}} with <b>the</b> <b>Libyan</b> coup d'état of 1 September 1969 that deposed Idris and brought Muammar Gaddafi to power. Gaddafi claimed the Aouzou Strip in {{northern}} Chad, referring to an unratified treaty signed in 1935 by Italy and France (then the colonial powers of Libya and Chad, respectively). Such claims {{had been previously}} made when in 1954 Idris had tried to occupy Aouzou, but his troops were repelled by the French Colonial Forces.|$|E
5|$|At {{the opening}} of 1987, {{the last year of}} the war, <b>the</b> <b>Libyan</b> expeditionary force was still impressive, {{comprising}} 8,000 soldiers, 300 tanks, many multiple rocket launchers (rocket artillery) and regular artillery pieces, Mi-24 helicopters and sixty combat aircraft. These forces did not have a unified command, but were divided into an Operational Group South, active in the Tibesti with 2,500 men, and an Operational Group East, centered in Faya-Largeau.|$|E
5|$|He {{returned}} to Egyptian television in 1998, hosting the current affairs and press review talk show Ra'is el-Tahrir ("Editor-in-Chief"). The program {{became one of}} the most popular and respected in Egypt. After apparent trouble with the state censors, Qandil moved the show to Dubai TV in 2004 under the name Qalam Rosas ("Pencil.") The new program was highly watched throughout the Arab world. He was forced to quit Dubai TV after criticizing Arab governments and subsequently hosted the show on <b>the</b> <b>Libyan</b> channel Al-Libia for two months before <b>the</b> <b>Libyan</b> government cancelled it. He {{returned to}} Egypt and wrote for the Al-Masry Al-Youm newspaper and then Al-Shorouk, but his association with the latter ended as a result of a libel suit brought on by then-Egyptian foreign minister Ahmed Aboul Gheit in response to a column critical of Egyptian foreign policy written by Qandil in May 2010. The case was later dropped following the 2011 Egyptian Revolution.|$|E
50|$|Their {{occupation}} of Ancient Libya is first attested in Egyptian language texts from the New Kingdom, {{especially from the}} Ramesside Period. The earliest occurrence is in a Ramesses II inscription. There were no vowels in the Egyptian script. The name Libu is written as LBW or RBW in Egyptian hieroglyphs. In the Great Karnak Inscription Merneptah describes how hostilities between Egypt and Libya broke out and how <b>the</b> <b>Libyans</b> were defeated. Ramesses III defeated <b>the</b> <b>Libyans</b> in <b>the</b> 5th year of his reign, but six years later <b>the</b> <b>Libyans</b> joined <b>the</b> Meshwesh and invaded the western Delta and were defeated again. Libu appears as an ethnic name on the Merneptah Stele, {{also known as the}} Israel Stele.|$|R

5|$|In 2014, the Somali Olympic Committee {{appointed}} {{a team of}} professionals to find talented Somali athletes for the upcoming Summer Olympics. Efforts were hampered by the ongoing Somali Civil War, both in access for the scouts and because athletes were fleeing the fighting. Samia Yusuf Omar, who represented the national at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China, drowned off <b>the</b> <b>Libyan</b> coast while attempting to reach Europe by boat in 2012.|$|E
5|$|Libya blocked access on January 24, 2010, {{because of}} videos that {{featured}} demonstrations {{in the city}} of Benghazi by families of detainees who were killed in Abu Salim prison in 1996, and videos of family members of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi at parties. The blocking was criticized by Human Rights Watch. In November 2011, after <b>the</b> <b>Libyan</b> Civil War, YouTube was once again allowed in Libya.|$|E
5|$|On April 14, 1986, in {{response}} to acts of terrorism sponsored by Libyan leader Muammar al-Gaddafi—in particular, the Berlin disco bombing of April 6—and {{against the backdrop of}} heightened tension and clashes between <b>the</b> <b>Libyan</b> and U.S. Navies over Libya's disputed territorial water claims in the Gulf of Sidra, the United States launched a surprise attack on key facilities in Tripoli and other parts of Libya.
