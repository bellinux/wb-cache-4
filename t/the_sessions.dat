5|$|In April, {{the band}} began demoing material, {{and said they}} were aiming to release a new album later in the year. In August, the band {{announced}} they would be recording in a few weeks' time, and were aiming for a spring 2011 release. After some shows in the summer, the band began recording in October. Eric Valentine produced <b>the</b> <b>sessions</b> at Barefoot Recording in Hollywood, California. Valentine also engineered <b>the</b> <b>sessions</b> with assistance from Cian Riordan. The band used Undertone Audio Consoles during recording. At the start of recording, the group had 18 songs. They whittled this number down little by little, and wrote additional songs at Robert Lang Studios in Seattle, Washington. The drums tracks were completed in early October.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the final}} mixes of 1984, titled Albert Bouchard's Imaginos, {{surfaced}} on the Internet in 2003 as a free download. The album contains music recorded during <b>the</b> <b>sessions</b> from 1982 to 1984 and permits a comparison of arrangements, vocals and sound with the version published in 1988.|$|E
5|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} over three months at Signature Sound in San Diego. During <b>the</b> <b>sessions,</b> MCA executives pressured the band {{to retain the}} sound that helped their previous album sell millions. As such, Take Off Your Pants and Jacket continues the pop punk sound that the group honed and made famous, albeit with a heavier tone inspired by groups such as Fugazi and Refused. Regarding lyrics, the album {{has been referred to}} as a concept album chronicling adolescence, with songs dedicated to first dates, fighting authority and teenage parties. Due to differing opinions on direction, the trio worked in opposition to one another for the first time, and <b>the</b> <b>sessions</b> sometimes became contentious.|$|E

30|$|Results: 47 {{sessions}} with RCMT were evaluated. 24 males and 23 females, age between 49 and 88  years, {{participated in the}} evaluation. The results showed a decrease in patient agitation level {{and an increase in}} patient consiousness. Patients´ with RASS[*]>[*] 0 decreased from 18 before <b>the</b> <b>session</b> to 6 after <b>the</b> <b>session.</b> Patients with RASS[*]≤[*]− 1 decreased from 5 before <b>the</b> <b>session</b> to 3 after <b>the</b> <b>session.</b> A decrease in delirium where 11 patients were assessed CAM-ICU positive before <b>the</b> <b>session</b> and 4 patients after <b>the</b> <b>session.</b> A decrease in pain where six patients scored NRS[*]>[*] 3 before <b>the</b> <b>session</b> compared to one patient after <b>the</b> <b>session</b> and 9 patients had CPOT scores[*]>[*] 2 before <b>the</b> <b>session</b> compared to 5 patients after <b>the</b> <b>session.</b> Assessment and evaluation of comfort by patients themselves and by the nurses, who cared for the particular patient, showed that RCMT was associated {{with a high degree of}} patient relaxation and comfort.|$|R
25|$|This field {{identifies}} {{the level of}} alert. If the level is fatal, the sender should close <b>the</b> <b>session</b> immediately. Otherwise, <b>the</b> recipient may decide to terminate <b>the</b> <b>session</b> itself, by sending its own fatal alert and closing <b>the</b> <b>session</b> itself immediately after sending it. The use of Alert records is optional, however if it is missing before <b>the</b> <b>session</b> closure, <b>the</b> <b>session</b> may be resumed automatically (with its handshakes).|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>sessions</b> {{continued}} {{until the end}} of November, when Hopkins left for Jamaica to work on the Rolling Stones' new album. During this period, Harrison co-produced a new live album for Shankar and Ali Akbar Khan for a January release on Apple Records, the highly regarded In Concert 1972.|$|E
5|$|While there, Lennon was {{inspired}} to embark on two recording projects: to make an album of the old rock 'n' roll songs that inspired {{him to become a}} musician, and to produce another artist. In December 1973, Lennon collaborated with Phil Spector to record the oldies album, Rock 'n' Roll. The alcohol-fueled recording sessions became legendary. Every musician in L.A. wanted to participate, but soon Lennon's drinking and Spector's erratic behavior (which included his firing a gun in the studio control room) caused <b>the</b> <b>sessions</b> to break down. Then Spector, who claimed to have been in a car accident, took <b>the</b> <b>sessions</b> tapes and was unreachable.|$|E
5|$|Although the duo {{felt that}} the presets and {{parameters}} of digital tools would inhibit creativity and innovation, they admitted that Random Access Memories {{could not have been}} made in the complete absence of computer technology. <b>The</b> <b>sessions</b> were recorded simultaneously onto Ampex reels and as Pro Tools tracks; Daft Punk and Guzauski would then listen to each recording in both analogue and digital iterations, deciding which of the two they preferred. Subsequently, the elements were edited by the duo with Pro Tools in a manner similar to how they would work with samples.|$|E
30|$|For {{comparison}} we {{have considered}} two cases. First, when a client makes a payment to access <b>the</b> whole <b>session.</b> Thus, <b>the</b> client makes <b>the</b> payment, <b>the</b> <b>session</b> is established, <b>the</b> service is provided {{and once the}} service is finished, <b>the</b> <b>session</b> ends. This case is named basic payment and appears in Table 2 as row A. Second, a client makes an initial payment for a part of <b>the</b> session; <b>the</b> <b>session</b> starts and after some time/amount of data an additional payment is requested to continue with <b>the</b> <b>session.</b> If <b>the</b> user decides to continue with <b>the</b> <b>session,</b> <b>the</b> client makes a new payment and <b>the</b> <b>session</b> continues for some additional time/amount of data. After this, a new payment could be requested or <b>the</b> <b>session</b> could finish. This case is named session with additional payments and appears in row B. For simplicity, in the comparison we suppose that only one additional payment is requested before finishing <b>the</b> <b>session.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>session</b> {{began on}} January 10, 1887, {{and ran for}} 60 days. During <b>the</b> <b>session</b> {{a number of the}} legislature's members {{contracted}} mumps and measles. Of the 102 bills passed by <b>the</b> <b>session,</b> two were vetoed.|$|R
30|$|Two {{additional}} {{functions to}} manage operator codes allow marking specific instants of <b>the</b> <b>session</b> or influencing <b>the</b> driver environment: insert_code records an operator code in <b>the</b> <b>session</b> files and get_code obtains the last operator code inserted in <b>the</b> <b>session.</b>|$|R
5|$|Are You Experienced and its {{preceding}} singles {{were recorded}} over a five-month period from late October 1966 through early April 1967. The album {{was completed in}} sixteen recording sessions at three London locations, including De Lane Lea Studios, CBS, and Olympic. Chandler booked many of <b>the</b> <b>sessions</b> at Olympic because the facility was acoustically superior and equipped {{with most of the}} latest technology, though it was still using four-track recorders, whereas American studios were using eight-track.|$|E
5|$|Before her death, Aaliyah {{had planned}} to embark on the largest concert tour of her career to support the album. Her {{recording}} sessions for Aaliyah produced many leftover tracks that were posthumously archived by Blackground and mostly left unreleased because of internal conflicts and legal complications between the label, Aaliyah's family, and the producers. The compilation album I Care 4 U was released in 2002 and featured six previously unreleased songs from <b>the</b> <b>sessions</b> for Aaliyah.|$|E
5|$|Def Jam {{rented out}} nearly every {{recording}} studio in Los Angeles {{in order to}} create as many songs as possible. Ray Daniels, the manager of musical duo Rock City (brothers Theron and Timothy Thomas), was present during <b>the</b> <b>sessions,</b> and stated that a writing camp typically involves the label hiring ten recording studios for two weeks at the cost of $25,000 per day. Daniels revealed that it is where songwriters have lyrics but no music, and where producers have music but no lyrics.|$|E

5|$|During <b>the</b> <b>sessions,</b> Grohl {{was invited}} by Tom Petty to perform with The Heartbreakers on Saturday Night Live one month later. The {{performance}} {{was followed by}} an invitation to be a full-time member of the Heartbreakers, but once Petty heard about the Foo Fighters, he instead encouraged Grohl {{to move on with}} this solo project. Grohl soon recruited a full band, which included bassist Nate Mendel and drummer William Goldsmith of the recently disbanded Sunny Day Real Estate, as well as Nirvana touring guitarist, and former Germs member, Pat Smear.|$|E
5|$|In August 1996, Radiohead toured as {{the opening}} act for Alanis Morissette. They resumed {{recording}} {{not at a}} studio but at St. Catherine's Court, a 15th-century mansion near Bath. <b>The</b> <b>sessions</b> were relaxed, with the band playing {{at all hours of}} the day, recording in different rooms, and listening to the Beatles, DJ Shadow, Ennio Morricone and Miles Davis for inspiration.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> second <b>session</b> was {{similarly}} rain-affected, with only limited running taking {{place before the}} rain returned; however, the gaps between drivers were not as extreme as those witnessed during <b>the</b> morning <b>session.</b> Mark Webber set the fastest time of <b>the</b> <b>session,</b> four seconds faster than Schumacher's time in <b>the</b> morning <b>session.</b> Fernando Alonso was second ahead of Button and Lewis Hamilton. <b>The</b> <b>session</b> was free of incidents, though Renault's Vitaly Petrov suffered a steering problem that saw him finish <b>the</b> 90-minute <b>session</b> in 24th and last place having done no dry running in <b>the</b> <b>session.</b>|$|R
5000|$|These {{groups of}} elders make {{decisions}} for the local parish through a ruling body called <b>the</b> Kirk <b>session</b> (Latin. sessio from sedere [...] "to sit"), sometimes <b>the</b> <b>Session,</b> church session, or (in Continental Reformed usage) consistory. The members of <b>the</b> <b>session</b> are <b>the</b> pastor (Teaching Elder) of that congregation, and the other ruling elders (sometimes called [...] "lay elders"). Elders are ordained for life, so if they are subsequently elected or appointed to Sessions at later points in their life, they are inducted, there being no second ordination. In most denominations, the pastor serves as Moderator of <b>the</b> <b>Session</b> and thus convenes or presides over <b>the</b> <b>session.</b> All elders have an equal vote in <b>the</b> <b>session.</b>|$|R

5|$|In September 1974, {{eight months}} after the release of Radio City, Chilton and Stephens {{returned}} to Ardent Studios to work on a third album. They were assisted by producer Jim Dickinson and an assortment of musicians including drummer Richard Rosebrough, and Lesa Aldridge, Chilton's girlfriend, who contributed on vocals. <b>The</b> <b>sessions</b> and mixing were completed in early 1975, and 250 copies of the album were pressed with plain labels for promotional use.|$|E
5|$|In early 1969, Quaife {{told the}} band he was leaving.

Ray Davies pleaded with him to return for <b>the</b> <b>sessions</b> for their upcoming album, but Quaife refused. Davies immediately called up John Dalton, who had filled in for Quaife in the past, as a replacement. Dalton remained with the group until 1977, when the album Sleepwalker was released.|$|E

5|$|One of the {{assistant}} engineers {{working on the}} album was a 19-year-old Alan Parsons.
