5|$|For {{the next}} 20 years, Berg {{had no real}} job, living off friends and {{relatives}} who put up with {{him because of his}} charisma. When they would ask what he did for a living, he would reply by putting his finger <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips,</b> giving them the impression that he was still a spy. A lifelong bachelor, he lived with his brother Samuel for 17 years. According to Samuel, he became moody and snappish after the war and did not seem to care for much in life besides his books. His brother finally grew fed up with the arrangement and asked Moe to leave and even had eviction papers drawn up. After being evicted from his brother's home, Berg moved in with his sister Ethel in Belleville, New Jersey, where he remained {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E
25|$|A figure {{holding a}} large horn <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips</b> and {{clasping}} a sword {{on his hip}} appears on a stone cross from the Isle of Man. Some scholars have theorized that this figure is a depiction of Heimdallr with Gjallarhorn.|$|E

25|$|In 1950, a {{semi-circular}} flat stone {{featuring a}} {{depiction of a}} mustachioed face was discovered on a beach near Snaptun, Denmark. Made of soapstone that originated in Norway or Sweden, the depiction was carved around the year 1000 CE and features a face with scarred lips. The figure is identified as Loki due <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips,</b> considered {{a reference to a}} tale recorded in Skáldskaparmál where sons of Ivaldi stitch up Loki's lips.|$|E
25|$|Tytla {{was one of}} {{the first}} animators {{assigned}} to Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. Fred Moore and Tytla were responsible for much of the design of the film and the definition of the personalities of the seven dwarfs. One of Tytla's famous scenes from the film (as described by John Canemaker) is where woman-hating Grumpy is kissed by Snow White. As he brusquely walks away, an internal warmth generated by the kiss gradually slows him, bringing a soft smile and sigh <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips,</b> revealing his true feelings of love. Grumpy's inner feelings are portrayed solely through pantomimein his telling facial expressions, his body language, and the timing of his reactions.|$|E
25|$|Owing to Siraj ud Dowla’s {{harshness}} of {{temper and}} indulgence, fear and terror had {{settled on the}} hearts of everyone {{to such an extent}} that no one among his generals of the army or the noblemen of the city was free from anxiety. Among his officers, whoever went to wait on Siraj ud Dowla despaired of life and honour, and whoever returned without being disgraced and ill-treated offered thanks to God. Siraj ud Dowla treated all the noblemen and capable generals of Alivardi Khan with ridicule and drollery, and bestowed on each some contemptuous nickname that ill-suited any of them. And whatever harsh expressions and abusive epithet came <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips,</b> Siraj ud Dowla uttered them unhesitatingly in the face of everyone, and no one had the boldness to breathe freely in his presence.|$|E

500|$|Early in the contest, congressional {{business}} restricted Barkley's {{campaign to}} weekends, so he enlisted allies like Fred Vinson {{to speak on}} his behalf. Chandler's political enemies such as former governor Ruby Laffoon, whom Chandler had crossed as lieutenant governor, and John Y. Brown, Sr., who felt that Chandler had broken a promise to support him for {{a seat in the}} Senate, also supported Barkley. Although labor leaders had backed Chandler's gubernatorial bid, they endorsed Barkley because of Roosevelt's support for labor unions. After the congressional session, Barkley resumed his [...] "Iron Man" [...] campaign style, making between 8 and 15 speeches each day and traveling, on average, [...] per week. This countered Chandler's implication that Barkley's age was a disadvantage, a charge that was further blunted when the younger Chandler fell ill in July, temporarily halting his campaigning. Chandler indirectly charged that a Barkley supporter had poisoned his ice water, causing the illness. Barkley ridiculed the suggestion, promising to appoint [...] "an ice water guard" [...] for his campaign. During speeches, he would lift a glass of water <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips,</b> then mockingly inspect it and refuse to drink it. Louisville police dismissed Chandler's claim as [...] "a political bedtime story".|$|E
500|$|During his journey, {{while waiting}} for a Mississippi steamboat, Uncle Tom first meets little Eva, who with her father is also taking the boat south. Tom is at once {{attracted}} to the beautiful little girl, and she in turn talks to the kindly old darkey. While looking at the boats, the little one accidentally falls into the swiftly flowing river and escapes drowning only through the bravery of Uncle Tom. He of all the crowd has the courage to jump in and rescue the little girl. Eva's father to reward Tom for his bravery, buys him from Legree, and once more Tom {{knows what it is}} to be treated kindly. He lives happily as little Eva's special bodyguard until the little one is seized with a sudden sickness and dies. She had become greatly attached to Uncle Tom, and the last act of her life was to present him with a little locket containing her picture. Once more Uncle Tom is sold and again falls into the hands of Simon Legree. He is taken to Legree's plantation in Mississippi, where he is overworked and ill-treated to the point of death. Just before he dies he presses <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips</b> the locket with the picture of his beloved little girl and in a vision sees her in the clouds holding out her arms to him that he, too, may enter with her the pearly gates, inside of which all souls are equal, and all free. The comedy of the story is furnished by little Eva's Aunt Ophelia, a queer old lawyer named Marx, and his stubborn donkey, to say nothing of Topsy, a wicked little colored girl, who Aunt Ophelia tries hard to convert." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{his early}} childhood, Fine's arm was accidentally burned with acid. [...] His father used the acid to test jewelry for its gold content. On one occasion, the young Fine mistook the acid for a {{beverage}} {{and raised the}} bottle <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips.</b> [...] Before he could drink any, his father knocked the bottle from Fine's hand, splashing Fine's forearm with acid and causing extensive damage to it.|$|E
50|$|On Monday April 18, Joe Russo was {{practicing}} {{on the track}} when he lost control {{at the north end}} and crashed into the retaining wall.

6000|$|... "Taisez-vous!"

2500|$|The {{officials}} {{were unable to}} use their whistles after the opening kick-off. As referee Norm Schachter blew his metal whistle to signal the start of play, it froze <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips.</b> As he attempted to free the whistle from his lips, the skin ripped off and his lips began to bleed. The conditions were so hostile that instead of forming a scab, the blood simply froze to his lip. For {{the rest of the}} game, the officials used voice commands and calls to end plays and officiate the game. At one point during the game, CBS announcer Frank Gifford said on air, [...] "I'm going to take a bite of my coffee." ...|$|E
2500|$|There were {{no signs}} of the {{garrison}} yielding. They treated Cromwell's summons lightly and miscalculated {{the power of his}} heavy guns. By the evening of 13 October two wide breaches had been effected, and {{at two in the morning}} it was resolved to storm the place at six, when the sky would be growing clear before the rising of the sun. The weary soldiers were directed to snatch a brief rest, but Cromwell spent part at least of the remainder of the night in meditation and prayer. He was verily persuaded that he was God's champion in the war against the strongholds of darkness, and as he figured to himself the idolaters and the idols behind the broken wall in front of him, the words, [...] "They that make them are like unto them, so is every one that trusteth in them", rose instinctively <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Mr. America's last WWE {{appearance}} {{was on the}} June 26 episode of SmackDown! when Big Show and The World's Greatest Tag Team (Charlie Haas and Shelton Benjamin) defeated Brock Lesnar, Kurt Angle, and Mr. America in a six-man tag team match. After the show went off the air, Mr. America unmasked to show the fans that he was indeed Hogan, putting his finger <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips</b> telling the fans to keep quiet about his secret. The next week, Hogan quit WWE due to frustration with the creative team. On the July 3 episode of SmackDown!, McMahon showed the footage of Mr. America unmasking as Hogan and [...] "fired" [...] him, although Hogan had already quit in real life. The Mr. America charactercame under fire briefly from Marvel Comics, who anointed it a rip-off of Captain America, citing costume similarity. It was later revealed that Hogan was unhappy with the payoffs for his matches after his comeback under the Mr. America gimmick. McMahon decided to terminate Hogan's contract and Hogan left WWE in 2003.|$|E
60|$|In the {{meanwhile}} the little group who had thought prudence {{the better part}} of valour had reached the door. The foremost man amongst them opened it and peered cautiously out into the darkness. He turned back to those behind him, put a finger <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>lip</b> and beckoned <b>to</b> them to follow him in silence.|$|R

60|$|Wulf drank off the {{contents}} of the goblet placed <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips,</b> and in a few minutes was fast asleep. When he woke it was broad daylight, and Beorn was sitting by his side. The latter put his finger <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips.</b>|$|E
