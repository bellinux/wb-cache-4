5|$|Some lead {{compounds}} are colorful {{and are used}} widely in paints, and lead paint is a major route of lead exposure in children. A study conducted in 1998–2000 found that 38 million housing units in the US had lead-based paint, down from a 1990 estimate of 64 million. Deteriorating lead paint can produce dangerous lead levels in household dust and soil. Deteriorating lead paint and lead-containing household dust are the main causes of chronic lead poisoning. The lead breaks down into the dust and since children {{are more prone to}} crawling on the floor, it is easily ingested. Many young children display pica, eating <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> food. Even a small amount of a lead-containing product such as a paint chip or a sip of glaze can contain tens or hundreds of milligrams of lead. Eating chips of lead paint presents a particular hazard to children, generally producing more severe poisoning than occurs from dust. Because removing lead paint from dwellings, e.g. by sanding or torching creates lead-containing dust and fumes, it is generally safer to seal the lead paint under new paint (excepting moveable windows and doors, which create paint dust when operated). Alternately, special precautions must be taken if the lead paint is to be removed. In oil painting it was once common for colours such as yellow or white to be made with lead carbonate. Lead white oil colour was the main white of oil painters until superseded by compounds containing zinc or titanium in the mid-20th century. It is speculated that the painter Caravaggio and possibly Francisco Goya and Vincent Van Gogh had lead poisoning due to overexposure or carelessness when handling this colour.|$|E
25|$|Deception is {{the act of}} {{propagating}} {{beliefs in}} <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> true, or not the whole truth (as in half-truths or lying by omission). Deception can involve dissimulation, propaganda, and sleight of hand, as well as distraction, camouflage, or concealment. There is also self-deception, as in bad faith.|$|E
25|$|Sleep {{paralysis}} is when, during awakening {{or falling}} asleep, one is aware {{but unable to}} move. During an episode, one may hear, feel, or see <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> there. It often results in fear. Episodes generally last less {{than a couple of}} minutes. It may occur as a single episode or be recurrent.|$|E

25|$|Numbers {{can count}} (3nbsp&apples), order (the 3rdnbsp&apple), or measure (3.5nbsp&feet high); as {{the history of}} {{mathematics}} has progressed from counting on our fingers to modelling quantum mechanics, multiplication has been generalized to more complicated and abstract types of numbers, and to <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> numbers (such as matrices) or do not look much like numbers (such as quaternions).|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} {{modality}} referred to when people speak of hallucinations include the phenomena of seeing <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> present or visual perception, {{which does not}} reconcile with the physical, consensus reality. There are many different causes that have been classed as psychophysiologic (a disturbance of brain structure), psychobiochemical (a disturbance of neurotransmitters), psychodynamic (an emergence of the unconscious into consciousness), and psychological (e.g., meaningful experiences consciousness); {{this is also the}} case in Alzheimer's disease. Numerous disorders can involve visual hallucinations, ranging from psychotic disorders to dementia to migraine, but experiencing visual hallucinations does not in itself mean that there is necessarily a disorder. Visual hallucinations are associated with organic disorders of the brain and with drug- and alcohol-related illness, and not typically considered the result of a psychiatric disorder.|$|E
25|$|The {{prairie dog}} is well adapted to predators. Using its dichromatic color vision, it can detect predators {{from a great}} distance; it then alerts other prairie dogs of the danger with a special, high-pitched call. Constantine Slobodchikoff and others assert that prairie dogs use a {{sophisticated}} system of vocal communication to describe specific predators. According to them, prairie dog calls contain specific information {{as to what the}} predator is, how big it is and how fast it is approaching. These have been described as a form of grammar. According to Slobodchikoff, these calls, with their individuality in response to a specific predator, imply that prairie dogs have highly developed cognitive abilities. He also writes that prairie dogs have calls for <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> predators to them. This is cited as evidence that the animals have a very descriptive language and have calls for any potential threat.|$|E

500|$|The {{production}} spent $4 {{million to}} restore Dealey Plaza to 1963 conditions. Stone utilized {{a variety of}} film stocks. Richardson said, [...] "It depends {{whether you want to}} shoot in 35 or 16 or Super 8. In many cases the lighting has to be different." [...] For certain shots in the film, Stone employed multiple camera crews shooting at once, using five cameras {{at the same time in}} different formats. Richardson said of Stone's style of direction, [...] "Oliver disdains convention, he tries to force you into <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> classic. There's this constant need to stretch." [...] This forced the cinematographer to use lighting in diverse positions and rely very little on classic lighting modes. The shoot lasted 79 days with filming finished five months before the release date.|$|E
500|$|Descartes' {{argument}} crucially {{depends on}} the premise that what Seth believes to be [...] "clear and distinct" [...] ideas in his mind are necessarily true. Many contemporary philosophers doubt this. For example, Joseph Agassi suggests that several scientific discoveries made since the early 20th century have undermined the idea of privileged access to one's own ideas. Freud claimed that a psychologically-trained observer can understand a person's unconscious motivations better than the person himself does. Duhem has shown that a philosopher of science can know a person's methods of discovery better than that person herself does, while Malinowski has shown that an anthropologist can know a person's customs and habits better than the person whose customs and habits they are. He also asserts that modern psychological experiments that cause people to see <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> there provide grounds for rejecting Descartes' argument, because scientists can describe a person's perceptions better than the person herself can.|$|E
500|$|Malicious rumours {{concerning}} Wenger's {{private life}} surfaced during November 1996, {{to the extent}} the City of London reported that his exit from Arsenal was imminent. Having returned {{from a trip to}} Strasbourg to visit his parents, Wenger attended a press meeting and strongly refuted the claims: [...] "If something comes out that is wrong, I will attack. It is a serious matter if you can just create <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> right." [...] Arsenal's press officer Clare Tomlinson, who was present at the news conference, recalled Wenger phoning the next day and demanding why he could not take action against the press for printing the story. The culprit responsible for spreading gossip in the City later apologised to Wenger. During this, Arsenal had led the Premier League, but poor form in February 1997 caused Wenger to rule out his team's chances of winning the title. They finished third in his first season, missing out on UEFA Champions League qualification to Newcastle United on goal difference – the tiebreaker used to determine the ranking between teams equal on points.|$|E

500|$|The major-label debut sold {{strongly}} {{and nearly}} {{four times as}} fast as Dude Ranch, and shipped gold to stores, unlike its predecessor, which took seven months to achieve that certification. Enema of the State went platinum in October 1999 and went triple platinum in January 2000; in February 2001, the album was certified five times platinum in the United States by the Recording Industry Association of America. The record performed well in international markets as well. Enema of the State went quadruple platinum in Canada and triple platinum in Australia. It peaked at number seven on the Canadian Albums Chart, but peaked the highest worldwide on the New Zealand Albums Chart (number two), where it was certified double platinum. It was also certified double platinum in Italy, platinum in the United Kingdom, and gold in six other territories (Austria, Germany, Indonesia, Mexico, the Philippines, and Switzerland). In Europe, the album sold over one million copies. To further promote Enema of the State, the trio made a cameo appearance in American Pie, a teen comedy released several weeks following the album release. Hoppus, DeLonge and Barker appear in a scene in which they are interrupted rehearsing to see a webcast on a computer. Music from Enema of the State was also used in the film and on its soundtrack. The cameo appearance was well-received, with New York Nitsuh Abebe commending the common sensibility and humor between the two: [...] "green grass, sun, swimming pools, teen boys obsessed with and mildly terrified by sex, jokes about having sex with <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> other humans, and a healthy side of toilet-oriented gags." ...|$|E

2500|$|In Mark Booth's 1983 book Camp {{he defines}} camp as [...] "to present oneself as being {{committed}} to the marginal with a commitment greater than the marginal merits."

In the article [...] "Veblen, Bourdieu, and Conspicuous Consumption" [...] (2001), A.
