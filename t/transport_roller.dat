DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The method for melt-free transformation of bundles from polycrystalline fibers into bundles of single crystalline fiber or of fibers with single crystalline area, comprises providing (1) bundles of fibers from polycrystalline material, laterally fanning out (3) the fiber bundles {{in such a way}} that the contacts of the fibers of the bundle are abated among each other, recrystallizing (4) the material contained in the fiber bundles in an oven zone at a temperature that lies below the melting temperature of the fiber material, cooling the fiber bundles, and rolling up (5) the fiber bundles on a cover or simultaneously cutting the fibers of bundles or all bundles vertically to fiber direction {{in such a way that}} short fibers are received. The fibers are transported over a transport line on which the fanning out takes place, where the fanning out takes place by electrostatic loading of the fibers by guiding the fiber bundles through column between two oppositively loaded electrodes, tightening and relaxing the fibers of the fiber bundles in oscillating manner, guiding the fibers through a compressed air pillow and recrystallizing the fibers in a hot gas stream. The process is continuously carried out and the fiber bundle tension is constantly held over the temperature line. The hot gas stream through which the fiber bundle is guided for recrystallization has a temperature of 0. 8 - 0. 85 T of melt related to the absolute melting temperature of the fiber. The hot gas stream is generated through the combustion of propane-oxygen-mixture containing inert gas such as nitrogen or argon. The transport speed of the fiber bundle is 150 - 300 mm/h and/or the fiber bundle tension is 0. 2 - 0. 1 N. The tightening and relaxing of the fiber is carried out by a spiked roller. The fiber bundle tension is adjusted by redirection rods, tensor roller, spring sheet metal and/or <b>transport</b> <b>roller</b> pair in a value of 0. 15 - 0. 18 N. An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is included for a fiber bundle. USE - Method for melt-free transformation of bundles of polycrystalline fibers into bundles of single crystalline fiber or fibers with single crystalline area, useful for the production of single crystalline sapphire fibers. ADVANTAGE - The method ensures simple and efficient melt-free transformation of bundles of polycrystalline fibers into bundles of single crystalline fiber or fibers with single crystalline area, with good flexibility...|$|E

30|$|Several factors {{shape the}} tension control design to be challenging, which include {{significant}} parameter variations and disturbances. Small {{variations in the}} change of velocity of the <b>transport</b> <b>rollers</b> can cause significant variations in tension. On the other hand, we used different shapes of mandrels for maintaining the line speed in acceleration or deceleration states. Because of the coupling between the tension and the line speed, {{it is difficult to}} maintain the tension at a desired value. Researchers have investigated considerably for acquiring better control result. Lee et al. [2] used a magneto rheological brake to provide back tension to prevent frequent part changes and fatal malfunction for a tension control system, and a PID controller was designed, and test results showed the feasibility with satisfying the time constant and the allowable error. Nishida et al. [3] divided the transport system into several subsystems and a self-tuning PI controller with an estimator based on a novel adaptive particle swarm optimization method was constructed to solve the strong coupling between the velocity and tension of the web. A self-tuning PID controller to control the tension for tape winding of composites was designed and the constant extension ratio is guaranteed. To reduce the time required for the stabilization of the tension, a faststabilization method [4] for web tension is proposed. The model of dancer system and stabilization of web tension in drying process are established, and the variation of tension is used as a reference value for the tension stabilization. The integration of load cells and active dancer system for printed electronics applications was used to improve the accuracy of web tension, and self-adapting neural network control was proposed to reduce tension spikes due to the change in roll diameter of winder and unwinder rolls. Wu et al. [5] developed a tension detection and control mechanism and analyzed the main causes of wire tension variation, and then a PI algorithm was proposed to reduce tension variation. An accurate dynamic model for the unwind roll by considering the time variation of the roll inertia and radius was developed, and a decentralized controller for computing the equilibrium inputs for each driven roller was proposed [6]. A sliding mode control with guaranteed cost technique [7] was applied for reducing the system uncertainties. The simulation results showed that the proposed method had good robustness and quick response time. Compensation method [8] by calculating the torque of a driven loop lifter was developed to control the tension and thickness of hot-rolled strip. For the control strategy, several control methods have been proposed including disturbance rejection control [9 – 12], neuro-fuzzy control [13 – 16], and H∞ control [17 – 19]. Choi et al. [20] conducted a survey on various types of control algorithms by investigating their strengths and weaknesses, and demonstrated some areas of potential future development.|$|R

40|$|International audienceFlexible {{materials}} such as textiles, papers, polymers, and metals are <b>transported</b> on <b>rollers</b> during their processing. Maintaining web tension in the entire processing line under changing web speed is {{a key factor in}} achieving good final product quality. Many industrial applications use dancer position feedback to indirectly regulate tension. Although widely used in the industry, pendulum dancers (rotational motion of the dancer roller) have received very little attention in the literature compared to linear ones (translational motion). The lack of clearly identified controllers synthesis methods can thus be noticed, as industry typically uses hand-tuned decentralized PI controllers. An improved alternative based on methods is proposed in this paper to provide a systematic framework. The focus in this study is the unwind section of a processing line that contains a pendulum dancer (PD). The nonlinear and linear phenomenological models of the unwind section containing the PD are discussed first. The position controller based on dancer position feedback is synthesized using the standard approach with mixed sensitivity. Because of the high order of the controllers synthesized with this approach, techniques to generate reduced-order controllers are used to calculate a fixed-order controller resembling standard industrial practice. The performance of the proposed controllers is demonstrated by carrying out experiments on a large experimental web handling platform containing four driven rollers, many idle rollers, and a PD in the unwind section. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first published results of successful application of an controller to a real plant containing a PD...|$|R

Traditional aqueous scouring is a method that emulsifies and removes contaminants (such as wool grease, suint, and dirt) from the fiber surface; however, it promotes wool felting and is energy and water intensive. This study has shown that modification of the traditional wool scouring line by introducing an ultrasonic device could be a viable alternative for the wool scouring industry. A standard six-bath wool scouring line was retrofitted with two ultrasonic panels working at 80 kHz in bath 2. Scouring was carried out in three modes: conventional mode without the transport rake, ultrasonic mode without the transport rake, and conventional mode with the transport rake.

Overall, the model predictions agree well with the available measurements in these tests, illustrating the robustness and efficiency of the present model for very different spatial scales and hydrodynamic conditions. Sensitivity tests indicate the importance of roller effects and wave energy dissipation on the mean flow (undertow) profile over the depth. These tests further suggest to adopt a spatially varying value for roller effects across the beach.

40|$|In {{roll-based}} printing systems, {{controlled release}} of liquid ink to the substrate surface is achieved through {{the transport of}} the liquid ink {{through a series of}} ink transfer rollers in the form of splitting liquid bridges. An in-depth understanding of the liquid transport process through the ink transfer rollers is essential for advancing the roll-based printing technology and achieving the highest quality printing. In this study, the phase-field method is investigated to characterize the liquid bridges in roll-based printing systems. Phase-field models of two-phase flow systems are being used increasingly often in a variety of applications ranging from microfluidics to turbulent flows. However, there are limited implementations of the phase-field method to simulate the liquid ink transport in roll-based printing systems. There are advantages of the phase-field method over other methods that are generally used for simulating the liquid transport in roll-based printing systems such as the volume of fluid method and the moving mesh methods. This study demonstrates that the phase-field method is an effective tool to simulate the liquid ink transport in roll-based printing systems that facilitates the treatment of certain characteristics of the ink flows such as moving and deforming interfaces, topology changes, and slipping contact lines. In the phase-field simulations described in this study, the liquid ink <b>transport</b> between the <b>rollers</b> is approximated as the stretching and splitting of liquid bridges with pinned or moving contact lines between vertically separating surfaces. The interface separating the liquid and the surrounding air is represented as a diffuse interface with finite thickness across which the two phases mix. First, the simulation conditions that yield accurate results are determined by examining the effect of the phase-field parameters and the mesh characteristics on the simulation results. The simulation results show that a sharp interface limit is approached when the capillary width is decreased keeping the mobility proportional to the capillary width squared. This limit best represents real interfaces having molecular thickness in the micron-scale flows investigated. Close to the sharp interface limit, the mobility changes over a specified range are observed to have no significant influence on the simulation results. The computational mesh is segmented into regions of varying mesh fineness or adaptive mesh refinement is implemented to reduce the computational cost of resolving thin interfaces in the simulations. The simulation results are validated against data reported in existing studies of liquid ink transport in roll-based printing systems for selected capillary width and mobility values. Next, the liquid ink transport from the axisymmetric cells on the surface an ink-metering roller to the surface of stamp features is simulated. The function of the cells on an ink-metering roller is to control the amount of liquid ink delivered to the stamp surface. The resolution of printing is limited by the width of the cell openings, since uniform inking of the stamp requires the width of the cell openings to be smaller than the size of the stamp features. The cell geometries explored in the simulations are selected to enable printing with higher resolution than the current industry standards. Increasing the resolution of printing would improve the performance of printed products and expand their range of functionality. The results of the simulations indicate that under negligible inertial effects {{and in the absence of}} gravity, the amount of liquid ink transferred from a cell with low surface wettability to a stamp with high surface wettability increases as the cell sidewall steepness and the cell surface wettability decrease, and the stamp surface wettability and the capillary number increase. The amount of liquid ink removed from the cell does not change significantly as the cell depth increases above a certain value. High-resolution printing strategies, which indicate how the printing parameters should be manipulated to more precisely control the printed layer thickness, to eliminate printing defects, and to minimize cell clogging, are derived by analyzing the simulation results. The cells with different sidewall inclination angles are used to represent the cells with irregular surface topography on novel materials and novel roller designs that could be used for stamp inking during high-resolution roll-based printing, such as the pores on porous materials and the cells fabricated with poor control over cell geometry due to manufacturing difficulties at small length scales. The variations in the printed layer thickness with the cell sidewall inclination angle is found to be significant (~ 10 - 100 nm for cells with 2 -[mu]m opening width) indicating that the variations in cell geometry should be minimized when designing advanced rollers for use in high-resolution roll-based printing. by Fahri Erinc Hizir.
