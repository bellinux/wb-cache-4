40|$|Mitral {{stenosis}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} often valvular disease in Division of Cardiology, M. Hoesin hospital, Palembang, and there was strong evidence of <b>thromboembolic</b> <b>phenomenon</b> in mitral stenosis (MS) patients. Many studies evaluated the spontaneous echo contrast (SEC) that was regarded as a precursor of thrombo embolic phenomenon. So far there were controversies regarding how to regress spontaneous echo contrast. A randomized double blind controlled study was done on 22 MS patients with positive SEC, receiving either aspirin 100 mg or acenocoumarol 1 mg and followed up after 4 weeks. There was 100 % regression of SEC in acenocoumarol group that consisted of 40 % regression from severe SEC to mild, and 60 % complete resolution. In aspirin group there was no resolution of SEC. In acenocoumarol group, 2 of 4 thrombus totally disappeared while the rest was reduced in size. On the other hand, in aspirin group, after 4 weeks, the patients with thrombus was increased from 3 to 4 patients. In conclusion, four week therapy with acenocoumarol 1 mg is effective and save in regressing spontaneous echo contrast and thrombus in mitral stenosis patients without any significant change in hemodynamics.

40|$|Pregnancy {{is poorly}} tolerated in {{patients}} with Eisenmenger syndrome (ES) with maternal mortality of 30 - 50 %. Physiological changes of pregnancy decreases systemic vascular resistance that further aggravates the bi-directional or right to left shunt associated with ES.

30|$|Other {{causes of}} {{deaths in the}} {{respiratory}} system are largely under the <b>thromboembolic</b> <b>phenomenon,</b> infections (which included miliary tuberculosis bronchopneumonia, lobar pneumonia) and respiratory failure. The high rate of death from pulmonary tuberculosis and pneumonia calls for better management of infectious conditions before they present as BID. Di Miao and Di Miao in their preview of cases of deceased who had natural deaths in USA; a developed country, showed that diseases of the central nervous and respiratory systems accounted for 8.7 and 8.6 %, respectively, of the natural deaths with seizure disorders and pneumonia were the {{main causes of death}} in these organ systems (Di Maio and Di Maio 1991). The high rate of infection and especially pulmonary tuberculosis brings to fore the urgent need for the government to intensify the prompt treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis among the infected. Moreover, medical management of chronic diseases must include early immobilisation of patients and the use of antithrombotic drugs to reduce the spate of deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary thromboembolism cannot be over emphasised.|$|E
40|$|Atrial {{fibrillation}} (AF) {{has been}} associated with lung diseases like pneumonia and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease but has only infrequently been associated with inhalational lung injury. We report two cases of resistant AF, which developed in young healthy manual laborers shortly after inhalational lung injury due to massive quantity of pesticides and anhydrous ammonia, respectively. They had no evidence of valvular or structural heart disease and did not have any previous medical problems. The AF was resistant to antiarrhythmic drugs and required pulmonary vein isolation in first patient and possibly the second patient who is currently being evaluated for this procedure. These arrhythmias may reflect direct myocardial injury during and after exposure. Alternatively, multiple mechanisms can cause atrial fibrillation in lung diseases, including hypoxemia, acidemia, inflammatory mediators, and structural changes in the atria and ventricle, and these could lead to AF in inhalational lung injury cases. AF needs to be excluded when patients present with palpitations after inhalational lung injury, especially since, if unrecognized, AF may lead to complications, like <b>thromboembolic</b> <b>phenomenon</b> and tachycardiomyopathy...|$|E
40|$|Bleeding is {{the major}} {{complication}} of anticoagulant therapy. The criteria to define the severity of bleeding varies considerably between studies, depending on the variation in rates of bleeding reported. They depend on the intensity of anticoagulant effect, patient characteristics and duration of treatment. ObjectiveThe aim of our study is to investigate the epidemiological, clinical and evolution of 80 cases of hemorrhagic stroke with variable severity collected at the cardiology department of the University Hospital Ibn Rushd of Casablanca. ResultsThe average age of our patients was 46. 17 years, with a 62 % female predominancy. The indications of anticoagulant therapy were: the atrial fibrillation in 60 % of cases, a mechanical prosthesis in 20 % of cases. Bleeding is manifested by gastrointestinal bleeding in 30 % of patients, rectal bleeding in 20 % of cases, gingival bleeding in 18 % of cases, haematuria in 15 % of cases, bruising of the soft tissues in 10 % of cases, and a hematoma of floor of mouth in 2 % of cases. Patients received transfusions of {{packed red blood cells}} and fresh frozen plasma with clinical and biological improvement.

40|$|A b s t r A c t Background: Acquired {{resistance}} to protein C in pregnancy {{has been established}} {{as one of the}} factors associated with <b>thromboembolic</b> <b>phenomenon,</b> an important cause of maternal mortality and morbidity. Objectives: To establish the mean levels of PCA ratio (measure of protein C resistance) of among our pregnant women since maternal mortality rate of the country is on the increase despite efforts to reduce this trend. Materials and Methods: A prospective study was carried out in a tertiary institution in Enugu State, Southeastern Nigeria over the 7 months period from May 2010 to November 2010. Two hundred pregnant women and 50 non pregnant female controls were recruited and PCA ratio, (coagulometric assay) were determined. Results: There was a non significant difference between the mean and standard deviation PCA ratio of the female non pregnant controls and pregnant women in 2 nd trimester 4. 32 ± 0. 4 and 4. 30 ± 0. 4 respectively. A significant difference was noted between the controls and pregnant women in 3 rd trimester 4. 32 ± 0. 4 and 3. 87 ± 0. 5 respectively also between the pregnant women in their 2 nd and 3 rd trimester 4. 30 ± 0. 4 and 3. 87 ± 0. 5 respectively.

40|$|Background: The {{process of}} audit standardizes {{protocols}} in departments and has long-term benefits. Maternal autopsies though routinely performed, deserve a special attention. Aims: This study {{was carried out}} to calculate the maternal mortality ratio (MMR) in a tertiary care hospital and to correlate final cause of death with the clinical diagnosis. An audit of maternal autopsies was carried out to evaluate current practices, identify fallacies and suggest corrective measures to rectify them. Materials and Methods: Eighty-nine autopsies of maternal deaths in the period 2003 to 2007 were studied in detail along with the clinical details. Results: There were 158 maternal deaths and 13940 live births in this five-year period. Maternal mortality rate {{was found to be}} very high (1133 / 100000 live births) in our institution with a high number of complicated referral cases (68 / 89 cases, 76 &#x 0025;). Of the 89 autopsies, acute fulminant viral hepatitis was the commonest cause of indirect maternal deaths (37 cases, 41. 5 &#x 0025;). This was followed by direct causes like pregnancy-induced hypertension (12 cases, 13. 4 &#x 0025;) and puerperal sepsis (10 cases, 11. 2 &#x 0025;). Certain fallacies were noted during the audit process. Conclusion: During the audit it was realized that in maternal mortality autopsies, special emphasis should be given to clinicopathologic correlation, microbiological studies, identification of <b>thromboembolic</b> <b>phenomenon</b> and adequate sectioning of relevant organs. We found difficulty in identification of placental bed in the uterus in postpartum autopsies.
