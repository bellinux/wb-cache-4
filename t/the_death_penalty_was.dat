5|$|Following the Rising of the Priests in 1775, {{three of}} the rebellion's leaders were {{executed}} without receiving fair trial. <b>The</b> <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> <b>was</b> signed by the Castellano under the orders of Grand Master Francisco Ximenes de Texada. Prior to judgement, some of the priests and clerics were locked up in the secretive prisons near the courtroom of the Castallania, some at the Castellania dungeons, and in other Valletta buildings. All those arrested were recorded on the Libro del Carcerati Della Magna Curia Castellania. Among them was Gaetano Mannarino, {{the leader of the}} rebellion. Some of them were condemned to death by strangulation in the dungeons of the Castellania. The whole process went against the conformity of the courts in Malta as the priests were not to be subjected to the Castellania but to the court of the Bishop. Ximenes died a natural death within weeks after the sentences, with some locals believing it was a divine providence for his merciless judgement against the clergy.|$|E
5|$|None of the Commission's {{recommendations}} {{ever made}} it into law under the Rump Parliament, though the Commission did produce 16 bills. Several were read in the House of Commons, and the remainder given to the Parliamentary Law Committee in July 1652 following the Committee's dissolution on 23 July. The Rump Parliament's successor, the Barebone's Parliament, brought two of the Commission's suggestions (to abolish fines for original writs and to develop procedures for civil marriages) into force through statutes. Most of the Commission's suggestions were, at some point, followed. In 1837 the use of <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> <b>was</b> curtailed, and it was finally abolished in 1969. From 1702 onwards, witnesses were allowed for the defence, and the Prisoners' Counsel Act 1836 allowed legal representation for the defendants. The use of peine forte et dure was abolished in 1741, and the benefit of clergy in 1827. A permanent Law Commission was finally established with the Law Commissions Act 1965. County Courts were finally established in 1846, and a Court of Criminal Appeal in 1907.|$|E
5|$|After {{a medical}} exam, Mulder {{finds out that}} Orison has three times the bloodflow {{capacity}} of the brain due to a hole in he has drilled into his own head, allowing him to perform mental tricks by hypnotizing people. Orison hypnotizes the security guard in his room and easily escapes. Meanwhile, at Orison's apartment, a prostitute escapes when Pfaster attacks her for wearing a wig. Orison then finds Pfaster and takes him at gunpoint. In the woods, Orison digs a grave for Pfaster, who morphs into a demonic beast and kills him, burying him in his own shallow grave. Pfaster then calls the police, telling them where Orison is buried, and goes to Scully's house. He attacks Scully, who tells him {{that the only reason}} he was not given <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> <b>was</b> because she asked the judge for life. He overpowers her and locks her in her own closet. Mulder thinks something may be wrong when he hears the same song on his radio and calls Scully. After receiving no answer, he goes over to her house and stumbles upon Pfaster, promptly arresting him. Meanwhile, Scully escapes from the closet and shoots Pfaster, despite him being unarmed, killing him. Scully later confides in Mulder, telling him she's scared because she's not sure who's in control of her, God or something else.|$|E

2500|$|Justice Antonin Scalia {{and other}} originalists often claim that <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> <b>is</b> not [...] "cruel and unusual {{punishment}}" [...] {{because at the}} time of the Eighth Amendment's passage, it was a punishment believed to be neither cruel nor unusual. Dworkin and the semantic-originalists assert, however, that if advances in moral philosophy (presuming that such advances are possible) reveal that <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> <b>is</b> in fact [...] "cruel and unusual", then the original meaning of the Eighth Amendment implies that <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> <b>is</b> unconstitutional.

5|$|Valckenier {{had asked}} to be {{replaced}} late in 1740, and in February 1741 had received a reply instructing him to appoint van Imhoff as his successor; an alternative account indicates that the Lords XVII informed {{him that he was}} to be replaced by van Imhoff as punishment for exporting too much sugar and too little coffee in 1739 and thus causing large financial losses. By the time Valckenier received the reply, van Imhoff was already {{on his way back to}} the Netherlands. Valckenier left the Indies on 6 November 1741, after appointing a temporary successor, Johannes Thedens. Taking command of a fleet, Valckenier headed for the Netherlands. On 25 January 1742 he arrived in Cape Town but was detained, and investigated by governor Hendrik Swellengrebel by order of the Lords XVII. In August 1742 Valckenier was sent back to Batavia, where he was imprisoned in Fort Batavia and, three months later, tried on several charges, including his involvement in the massacre. In March 1744 he was convicted and condemned to death, and all his belongings were confiscated. In December 1744 the trial was reopened when Valckenier gave a lengthy statement to defend himself. Valckenier asked for more evidence from the Netherlands, but died in his prison cell on 20 June 1751, before the investigation was completed. <b>The</b> <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> <b>was</b> rescinded posthumously in 1755. Vermeulen characterises the investigation as unfair and fuelled by popular outrage in the Netherlands, and arguably this was officially recognised because in 1760 Valckenier's son, Adriaan Isaäk Valckenier, received reparations totalling 725,000 gulden.|$|E
