Another case discussed by Heins is the 1980 Supreme Court decision in Fullilove v.

5|$|Apart from Rayalavari Karunakruthyamu, Krishnasastri's script {{also took}} {{inspiration}} from Devan Sharar's short story, The Emperor and the Slave Girl, {{which was published}} in the now defunct magazine, The Illustrated Weekly of India. It was Narasimha Reddy's practice to credit the authors of works from which he borrowed the basic premise for a film, but in this film, <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> case. Krishnasastry revealed the fact in an interview with Vijayachitra magazine after Narasimha Reddy's death in 1977. However, in the film's opening credits, Buchibabu was listed as the film's writer along with Krishnasastri. Adi M. Irani and B.N. Konda Reddy were the film's cinematographers; S. Rajeswara Rao and Addepalli Ramarao composed the film's music; H.R. Narayana and Vasu edited the film. A.K. Shekhar was the film's production designer and Thota Tharani father Thota Venkateswara Rao assisted him.|$|E

5|$|By May 29, {{four days}} before the opening of the convention, trainloads upon trainloads of delegates, lobbyists, reporters, and {{campaign}} followers had arrived at the Union and Dearborn railway stations in Chicago. Candidate supporters channeled through the Chicago streets with daily parades and rallies. Pre-convention possible outcomes of the voting were published by a number of sources. One, from the Albany Evening Journal, predicted Blaine with 277 votes, Grant with 317, Sherman with 106, and 49 for the other candidates. All of these predicted candidate vote totals were short of the 379 needed to win. Many in Chicago knew that a victor, most probably Grant, would only be determined if the unit rule, which postulated that all delegates from a particular state must vote for the candidate preferred by that state's delegation, was to be in effect. If <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> case, then a long deadlock would result until one side succumbed to the other.|$|E

25|$|In November, Parker and Snow persuaded RCA to buy Presley {{out from}} Sun for $40,000, and on November 21 Presley's {{contract}} was officially transferred from Sun Records to RCA Victor.

However, <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> case since Elvis was still under contract to Bob Neal. The only document that was signed on November 21 pertained to the record label transfer. In return for a larger financial part of the deal, Neal agreed not to renew his management contract with Presley after it expired in March 1956, allowing Parker the opportunity to claim the job for himself.|$|E
25|$|Snow’s {{work and}} {{findings}} {{were related to}} both anaesthesia {{and the practice of}} childbirth. His experience with obstetric patients was extensive and used different substances including ether, amylene and chloroform to treat his patients. However, chloroform was the easiest drug to administer. He treated 77 obstetric patients with chloroform. He would apply the chloroform at the second stage of labour and controlled the amount without completely putting the patients to sleep. Once the patient was delivering the baby they would only feel {{the first half of the}} contraction and be on the border of unconsciousness but not fully there. Regarding administration of the anaesthetic, Snow believed that it would be safer if another person <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> surgeon applied it.|$|E

25|$|Stead's {{teams are}} {{recorded}} in several significant matches from 1724 to 1730. His first known match was probably at Chingford in 1724 {{and it became}} the subject of a court case after the Chingford team refused to play to a finish when Kent had the advantage. The court, presided over by Lord Chief Justice Pratt, ruled that the match must be played out so that all wagers could be fulfilled. The match resumed and was completed at Dartford Brent on 5 September 1726, though it seems <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> original venue.

25|$|However, in English law, the {{decision}} in Anisminic Ltd. v.

Lord President of the Privy Council, ex parte Page (1992), it was held that since Parliament only confers power on a public authority {{on the basis that}} it is to be exercised on the correct legal basis, any misdirection in law will render {{the decision}} ultra vires.

25|$|Rather, Frankfurter said, the {{constitutional}} and the interpretative issues were ripe for review.
