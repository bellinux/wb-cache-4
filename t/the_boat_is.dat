5|$|One {{day when}} <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> <b>is</b> out, Sasha finds a {{bag with a}} very young cat inside it in the water. The captain takes him home and names him Patch. The spring thaw arrives, and the captain ties up the boat and prepares to go elsewhere. Sasha decides not {{to go with the}} captain and Patch because she now knows that she is going to have kits, and wants them born in the forest. Patch and the captain are sad, but they understand.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>boat</b> <b>was</b> {{built in}} 1920 in Kiel, Germany at the Friedrich Krupp Germaniawerft shipyard. <b>The</b> <b>boat</b> <b>was</b> once {{run as a}} two-master and was almost 30 meters long.

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>boats</b> <b>are</b> called shōrōbune (精霊船). <b>The</b> <b>boats</b> <b>are</b> said {{to carry}} {{the souls of the}} {{deceased}} on them. <b>The</b> <b>boats</b> <b>are</b> mainly built by people who have lost a family member in the last year, though they are also built by others.|$|R
50|$|On 29 April 1982 <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> <b>was</b> decommissioned. On 22 July 1985 <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> <b>was</b> sold to be {{scrapped}} at {{the yard}} of the Heuvelman in Puttershoek.|$|R
5|$|Later {{that year}} John Quiller Rowett, who had financed this last {{expedition}} {{and was a}} former schoolfriend of Shackleton’s from Dulwich College, South London, decided to present the James Caird to the college. It remained there until 1967, although its display building was severely damaged by bombs in 1944. In 1967, the boat {{was given to the}} care of the National Maritime Museum, and underwent restoration. It was then displayed by the museum until 1985, when it was returned to Dulwich College and placed in a new location in the North Cloister, on a bed of stones gathered from South Georgia and Aberystwyth. This site has become the James Cairds permanent home, although <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> <b>is</b> sometimes lent to major exhibitions and has taken part in the London Boat Show and in events at Greenwich, Portsmouth, and Falmouth. It has travelled overseas to be exhibited in Washington, D.C., New York, Sydney, Australia and Bonn, Germany.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{returning}} home, the {{two characters}} attempt to coordinate an escape with their fellow people. A girl {{appears in a}} boat she constructed from wood used in the sand castle {{from the beginning of}} the story; this causes the tribe to abandon their original plans and instead attempt to float up the river. After expanding the boat, the group loads onto it and sets sail. Soon they join the remaining members of their tribe, who had been in their own smaller boat. After a night of drifting, while the others are still asleep, the man and woman spot land. When they reach it, the story ends with the man and woman, last to depart, going into the new wilderness to explore it, with the boat seen bobbing in the water. The final five frames of the comic, in which <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> <b>is</b> bobbing on the water, are currently rotating in an undetermined pattern for the comic on the xkcd website.|$|E
5|$|Veronica {{learns that}} Wallace didn’t {{come back to}} Neptune to play basketball, as he {{originally}} said. Dick delivers the drugs, and Logan learns that Hector is now the prime suspect in Felix's death. Two FBI agents talk to Sheriff Lamb, intent on getting the baby back. Veronica shows some information about Duncan’s computer. Weevil talks to Hector, who denies the accusation. The FBI agents and Sheriff Lamb learn that Duncan stole a boat. However, when <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> <b>is</b> searched they do not find anyone—just evidence that people were there. Veronica thinks that Duncan has been picked up by someone. Veronica asks Vinnie Van Lowe to give a letter to Duncan. Weevil talks to Sean Friedrich (Kevin Sheridan), a drug dealer, but learns that he wasn’t working for the Fitzpatricks. Veronica talks to Wallace (Percy Daggs III), who says that a teammate crashed his car into a man and drove away {{while he was in}} it. He felt incredibly guilty and decided to come back.|$|E

5|$|Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) {{learns that}} his father took all the family money and fled to Argentina with his mistress. Left {{to pick up the}} pieces, Andy sells off family heirlooms, and is upset that he has to sell the family boat for lack of any other means for his mother to support herself. Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) convinces him that before he sells the boat, they should take it out for one last sunset cruise, and they drive to Stamford, Connecticut, where <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> <b>is</b> docked. Andy starts to hoist the main sail, but is stopped by a broker who is to sail it to the Caribbean for the buyer. With Erin's encouragement, Andy decides to take the boat to the Caribbean himself. He then finds his drunken brother Walter (Josh Groban) passed out in the liquor closet. Walter comes to and tells Andy he wanted to get the first relapse out of the way before {{checking}} into rehab. Andy invites him on the trip, saying they both need family time together and leaves, thanking Erin for her encouragement. Erin says to the camera that she would have loved to go with him if he asked. Back in the office that evening, Pete Miller (Jake Lacy) asks Erin to join him for drinks, and she accepts.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>boat</b> <b>was</b> {{built by}} CS Yachts in Canada who {{completed}} 400 examples between 1978 and 1987. <b>The</b> <b>boat</b> <b>was</b> a commercial success and 60 {{were sold in}} the first month it was produced.|$|R
500|$|According to Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships, 1906–1921, the {{specifications}} of the U-107 class are very unclear. The displacement for <b>the</b> <b>boats</b> <b>was</b> to be [...] surfaced and [...] submerged. <b>The</b> <b>boats</b> <b>were</b> to be [...] long with {{a beam of}} , but of unknown draft. For propulsion, the design featured two shafts, with twin diesel engines of [...] (total) for surface running, and twin electric motors of [...] (total) for submerged travel.

50|$|Carbon-14 dating of <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> <b>was</b> {{carried out}} in 1975 by the {{laboratory}} at the Swedish Museum of Natural History, which dated it to around 1200. This posed a problem since <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> would have <b>been</b> used by {{the inhabitants of the}} fortification, {{but the rest of the}} Bulverket was dated to the 1130s. It was later explained that the remnants of <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> <b>were</b> treated with linseed oil and alum in the 1930s, as part of the conservation process, and this may have distorted the results. Further examination of the wood showed that <b>the</b> <b>boats</b> <b>were</b> made of pine. The pieces of <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> <b>were</b> kept in <b>the</b> Swedish History Museum until 1975, when they were moved to the Maritime Museum for complete documentation.|$|R

25|$|In operation, a boat is navigated {{into the}} {{carrying}} frame, {{which has been}} lowered into the water. <b>The</b> <b>boat</b> <b>is</b> secured to the cradle, possibly by raising slings under the hull using hydraulics, and the cradle is hauled {{out of the water}} and up the hill with a cable. At the top of the slope, the cradle is lowered into the upper waterway, and the boat released. As <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> <b>is</b> not floating, Archimedes' principle does not apply, so the weight lifted or lowered by the device varies – making counterbalancing (by dead weights or a second boat carriage) more difficult.|$|E
25|$|Care {{is taken}} {{not to let}} the boat swing all the way over and capsize on the other side, {{frequently}} with the crew on the bottom. This is more likely if <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> <b>is</b> not pointed into the wind.|$|E

25|$|Halyards (sometimes haulyards), {{are used}} to raise sails and control luff tension. In large yachts the halyard returns to the deck but in small racing {{dinghies}} {{the head of the}} sail is attached by a short line {{to the head of the}} mast while <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> <b>is</b> lying on its gunwale.|$|E
25|$|In 2003, Gallagher {{sold the}} boat to new owners who pledged to {{continue}} with the restoration work. In 2006 the boat was moved to Hoboken, New Jersey while the local council carried out an upgrade to Pier 25. Although operational, <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> <b>is</b> apparently not used for actual voyages since it lacks a seaworthiness certificate.|$|E
50|$|Following the Italian {{armistice}} in September 1943, Nautilo was scuttled in the Venice harbour. <b>The</b> <b>boat</b> <b>was</b> then refloated by German {{forces and}} commissioned in the Kriegsmarine as UIT-19. <b>The</b> <b>boat</b> <b>was</b> once again sunk on 9 January 1944 in Pula, during an air raid {{carried out by}} the Royal Air Force. After the end of <b>the</b> war, <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> <b>was</b> raised by <b>the</b> Yugoslav Navy (Jugoslavenska ratna mornarica - JRM) and moved to the Uljanik Shipyard where it underwent repairs which lasted from 1947 to 1949. <b>The</b> <b>boat</b> <b>was</b> commissioned in 1949 as Sava (pennant number P-802), and with the Mališan (P-901) and Tara (P-801), formed the basis of the new Yugoslav submarine fleet.|$|R
50|$|Two other Englishmen {{were with}} Shelley on <b>the</b> <b>boat.</b> One <b>was</b> a retired naval officer, Edward Ellerker Williams; {{the other was}} a boatboy, Charles Vivien. <b>The</b> <b>boat</b> <b>was</b> found ten miles (16 km) offshore, and it was {{suggested}} that one side of <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> had <b>been</b> rammed and staved in by a much stronger vessel. However, the liferaft was unused and still attached to <b>the</b> <b>boat.</b> <b>The</b> bodies <b>were</b> found completely clothed, including boots.|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>boat</b> <b>was</b> soon alongside. <b>The</b> two drunken {{men were}} helped on board and, at once, went below to sleep {{themselves}} sober. Then <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> <b>was</b> hoisted on board and, the second hand taking the helm, the Kitty started fairly on her way.|$|R
25|$|The 470 (Four-Seventy) is a {{double-handed}} monohull planing dinghy with a centreboard, Bermuda rig, and centre sheeting. Equipped with a spinnaker, trapeze {{and a large}} sail-area-to-weight ratio, it {{is designed}} to plane easily, and good teamwork necessary to sail it well. The name comes from the overall length of the boat in centimetres (i.e., <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> <b>is</b> 4.70 metres long).|$|E
25|$|Intermediate sailors are {{encouraged}} to capsize their dinghies in a safe location with supervision at least once to become acquainted with their boat's floating properties and the capsize process. <b>The</b> <b>boat</b> <b>is</b> then righted, bailed out, and the sails reset, {{so that in the}} event of an uncontrolled capsize, the boat and its occupants are familiar with the procedure and may recover.|$|E
25|$|There {{are some}} rule {{differences}} for the B3 classification in competition that are sport specific. In adaptive rowing's Coxed Four boat, LTA4+, {{the maximum number}} of rowers from this class allowed in <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> <b>is</b> one. In athletics, T13 runners may get assistance at water stations in longer races. In blind cricket, no more than four players in this class are allowed out of the eleven total players.|$|E
50|$|The new {{lifeboat}} {{was built}} a local man known as ‘Old Newlyn’, who {{is thought to}} have been a member of <b>the</b> Lown <b>boat</b> building family. <b>The</b> <b>boat</b> <b>was</b> built in <b>the</b> style of the local herring fishing <b>boats.</b> <b>The</b> Augusta <b>was</b> 33 feet 6 inches long and 10 foot 3 inches wide. The power for <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> <b>was</b> provide by 16 oars. She was equipped with a dipping lug mainsail, mizzen sail and had fittings for a rudder at either end to avoid turning her in heavy seas. <b>The</b> <b>boat</b> <b>was</b> constructed within Sheringham Park using local timber.|$|R
50|$|Before leaving New York Harbor, <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> <b>was</b> used in Madonna's 'Papa Don't Preach' {{music video}} in 1986. While <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> <b>was</b> being worked on one day, a {{limousine}} {{pulled up to}} the dock and a representative for Madonna asked if they could use the ship in an upcoming music video.
