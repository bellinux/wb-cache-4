40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{and compares}} {{the use and}} function of the formulation [...] decision pair in three <b>types</b> <b>of</b> diagnostic <b>interviewing.</b> The investigatory <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>interviewing,</b> which typically occurs in the medical interview, {{is characterized by the}} absence of formulations. In the exploratory <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>interviewing,</b> which typically occurs in the psychiatric interview, the interviewer uses the formulation-decision pair for exploring the patient's experiences. He does not, however, formulate his professional assessment in the interview. In the collaborative type, which typically is found in psychotherapy, the formulation-decision pair is the main interactional device used by the interviewer for translating the patient's troubles into a professional problem definition. It is suggested that the patient's protoprofessionalization, which is typical for psychotherapy, already begins in the initial interview and that it is an effect of the interviewer's specific use of the formulation-decision device in the interview...|$|R

50|$|In general {{clinical}} practice with assessment of personality disorders, {{one form of}} interview is the most popular; an unstructured interview. The actual preferred method is a semi-structured interview but there is reluctance to use this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>interview</b> because they can seem impractical or superficial. The reason that a semi-structured interview is preferred over an unstructured interview is that semi-structured interviews {{tend to be more}} objective, systematic, replicable, and comprehensive.Unstructured interviews, despite their popularity, tend to have problems with unreliability and are susceptible to errors leading to false assumptions of the client.|$|E
50|$|Twitter {{can be used}} to host interviews, {{referred}} to as a Twitterview. It is a <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>interview</b> for which the medium restricts the interviewer and interviewee to short-form responses.

Unlike traditional interviews, a Twitterview allows the public to join in on the conversation and become participants themselves. It is typically conducted with a reliance on hashtags, marking the subject, so that online browsers may collectively search, view and track the ongoing dialogue.|$|E

40|$|Different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>interviews</b> serve {{different}} purposes; {{however, they}} all {{share a common}} goal of collecting data in different situations. The data may be factual in generating quantitative input for a research project, attitudinal in gauging public acceptance of a proposed educati. onal policy, or used in gaining {{a better understanding of}} a certain organizational feature of an educational institution. The normal progression in the interview process is from using open-ended questions as ice-breakers to establishing rapport with the interviewee, followed by negotiating the format, scope and range of the questions. Many researchers distinguish <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>interviews</b> by the amount of structure used in the process. Effective use <b>of</b> <b>interviewing</b> in qualitative research has also been discussed by researchers. <b>Types</b> <b>of</b> <b>interviews</b> applicable to educational research include: standardized survey interviews, in-depth interviews, intensive interviews, the long interview, the focused <b>interview,</b> and <b>interviews</b> <b>of</b> elites. Given the culturally divlrse and heterogeneous population, problems and biases are becoming more apparent. Variables in the interview process include: race, gender, age, educational level, and social status. Because of cultural and linguistic variables, different people attach different degrees of importance to the value, worth or intent of certain questions and answers.

50|$|In {{the group}} interview, {{multiple}} applicants are interviewed {{at one time}} {{by one or more}} interviewers. This <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>interview</b> can be used for selection, promotion, or assessment of team skills. Interviewers may also use a group interview to assess an applicant’s stress management skills or assertiveness because in such a group setting the applicant will be surrounded by other applicants who also want to get the job. Group interviews can be less costly than one-on-one or panel interviews, especially when many applicants need to be interviewed in a short amount of time. In addition, because fewer interviewers are needed, fewer interviewers need to be trained. These positive qualities of the group interview have made them more popular.|$|E
50|$|Telephone {{interviews}} {{are often}} conducted by employers {{in the initial}} interview round of the hiring process, this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>interview</b> allows an employer to screen candidates on the candidates experience, qualifications, and salary expectations pertaining to the position and the company. The telephone interview saves the employers' time and eliminates candidates that are unlikely to meet the company’s expectations. Employers tend to perform telephone interviews as a structured interview. The questions are custom tailored to meet the position in question. With the telephone interview {{there may not be}} direct contact between the employer and employee, however, the expectations are still there. Telephone interviews are scheduled and questions are generally prepared in advance, similar to the way other interviews are conducted. Another common reason a company looks to the telephone interview is that these interviews can be conducted on-the-fly. The interviewer does not have to assign company resources to the phone interview. It is a cost-effective method to short-list candidates for the position being interviewed for.|$|E
50|$|Research has {{investigated}} {{how to improve}} the accuracy of earwitness performance. One study investigated whether an interview called a Cognitive Interview would improve adult or child (11-13 years) voice recognition performance or speech content recall if it was administered immediately after the event. It was predicted that a cognitive interview would improve the likelihood of witnesses making a correct identification and improve recall of speech content, whether immediately after the event of after a time-delay and regardless of age. It was also predicted that adults would recall more content than children, because other {{studies have indicated that}} children provide less detail than adults during free recall. However, results revealed poor correct identification rates, regardless of the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>interview</b> earwitnesses had received (19.8%), as well as high false identification rates; 38.7% of participants incorrectly identified an innocent suspect. It did not seem to matter if an interview had been conducted shortly after the event or not. Moreover, there {{did not seem to be}} any difference between children and adults in terms of the number of suspects they correctly identified by their voice. Many researchers would suggest that this furthers the case for children (aged 11-13) to be thought of as equally capable of proving potentially helpful earwitness accounts within court settings.|$|E

5000|$|Evolutionary systems show {{a marked}} {{improvement}} in accuracy. In academic trials, research on a fairly-recent {{version of the}} EvoFIT system has shown correct naming levels of about 30% after a 2-day delay (see Frowd et al., 2010). Using more-recent construction techniques, the performance increased to 45% correct naming (Frowd et al., 2012). Using the very latest system, interview and enhancement techniques, naming of an EvoFIT composite is 74% correct (Frowd et al., 2013). Appropriately, the system does appear to behave more like a face recognition than a face recall system (Frowd et al., 2011) Accompanying the development of EvoFIT have been new approaches in the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>interview</b> administered to eyewitnesses prior to face construction (e.g. Frowd et al., 2012). Similarly in extensive field use EFIT-V has shown a 40% naming rate over an 18-month period with 1000 interviews. [...] The EvoFIT system has been similarly evaluated in formal police field-trials. [...] These evaluations have reported a much higher naming rate for EvoFIT composites but, using the latest interview techniques, a suspect arrest rate of 60%. This latest police field trial has also indicated that an EvoFIT directly leads {{to the arrest of}} a suspect and then a conviction in 29% of cases. There have been many notable successes - for example, in this investigation, EvoFIT has directly led to the arrest of a serial rapist.|$|E
40|$|This study {{examined}} candidate performance and reaction towards one-way video interviews, with comparison to phone interviews. The study also assessed {{the effects of}} big five personality and anxiety on performance. Previous research on this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>interview</b> only examined applicant reactions. No {{studies have examined the}} effect on applicant performance {{as a result of this}} new <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>interview.</b> The present results showed no differences between procedural fairness and overall favorability in the two interview modes. Interview performance in one-way video interviews was found to be slightly higher than performance in phone interviews. As predicted, extraversion was positively correlated and neuroticism negatively correlated with performance in both interviews, which supported findings in the literature. Organizations seeking to replace phone interviews with one-way video interviews should proceed with caution, as different settings and platform used may result in different outcomes.
