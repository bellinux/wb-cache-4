In early 1975, Kahin predicted of a Khmer Rouge victory: [...] "I know of no basis for assuming <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to be a major bloodbath." [...] He also spoke highly of the Khmer Rouge leadership, particularly Khieu Samphan, whom he called [...] "a very talented person." ...|$|E
500|$|Al-Tamimi, {{during his}} trial, {{repeatedly}} questioned {{the legitimacy of}} the Israeli military court trying him as well as Israeli regulations regarding public gatherings. The military judge ultimately found him guilty of sending stone-throwers and illegal protesting but cleared him of the two more serious charges. She stated that testimony from a 14-year-old witness had been inconsistent and therefore unusable and that she had found misrepresentations by interrogators about the content of the confession of another witness. Israeli activist Jonathan Pollak described al-Tamimi's partial exoneration as a [...] "miracle" [...] given the 99.74 percent conviction rate of the military court. Before his sentencing al-Tamimi stated that [...] "the laws come from an occupying regime whose legitimacy I do not recognise. I don't think even for a single minute <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to be justice done." [...] His lawyer denied al-Tamimi's involvement in stone throwing, stating that al-Tamimi believed in passive resistance.|$|E
2500|$|Tulane showed {{considerable}} optimism {{going into}} its road trip with Vanderbilt, Tennessee, and Auburn. [...] Ed Hebert of the Times-Picayune wrote of [...] underdog Tulane, [...] "Handicapped through {{the absence of}} their captain [...] "Little Eva" [...] Talbot, through an injury, the Greenbacks have become more determined to upset the dope kettle and completely bathe the Vandy eleven in a contest that points every way to {{a victory for the}} powerful crew that held the Michigan Wolverines to a 3-0 victory recently at Ann Arbor." [...] On having played similar foes in Texas, he went on, [...] "Thus if Vandy can be so outclassed by a club that Tulane has already fought every inch of the way it stands <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to be fur-flying in copious quantities when the Commodores and Greenbacks meet Saturday." [...] Tulane had a renowned backfield of Lester Lautenschlaeger, Brother Brown, Ellis Henican, and Peggy Flournoy. The [...] "Greenies" [...] were coached by Clark Shaughnessy.|$|E

60|$|The {{state of}} mind of the touring {{motorist}} entering a strange place at night is as peculiar and definite {{as that of a}} prospector. It is compounded of gratitude at having got safely in; of perception of a new town, yet with all eagerness about new things dulled by weariness; of hope <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to be a good hotel, but small expectation--and absolutely no probability--that there really will be one.|$|E
60|$|Thus {{the reply}} to this {{objection}} is, first, <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> on {{from both sides}} a narrowing of the chasm supposed to be impassable; and, secondly, that, even were the chasm not in course of being filled up, we should no more be justified in therefore assuming a supernatural commencement of life, than Kepler was justified in assuming that there were guiding-spirits to keep the planets in their orbits, {{because he could not}} see how else they were to be kept in their orbits.|$|E
6000|$|The old man {{shook his}} head. [...] "It was once, {{when we were}} children; now there's what we {{remember}} of it. We like to make believe about it,--that's natural; and it's natural we should make believe <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to be a spring for us somewhere else like what we see for the grass and bushes, here, every year; but I guess not. A tree puts out its leaves every spring; but by and by the tree dies, and then it doesn't put out its leaves any more." ...|$|E

There is a pale yellow light in the sky which I do not like, and, as far as one can see, the waves are crested with white foam. It is an ugly sea and an ugly sky. I wish that I were going with him, and that a storm might come and we might die together. I would not mind his holding me in his arms then. We would die like that, and death would be joy.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{want to take}} passage {{either to}} England or to France," [...] he said. [...] "I came out here {{but a few days}} ago, and I hear <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to be trouble between the two countries. It will {{therefore}} be of no use my going on to Amsterdam. I wish to get back again, for I am told that if I delay I may be too late. I cannot speak Dutch, and therefore cannot inquire if any boat will be sailing in the morning for England or Dunkirk. I have acquaintances in Dunkirk, and speak French, so it makes no difference to me whether I go there or to England." ...|$|E

"Indeed, save but {{for your}} teaching, {{it is high}} time that the Percys were back again; for there has already {{been a great deal of}} hot work, on the border, and report says that the Scots are {{mustering}} strongly, and <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to be a great raid into Cumberland; so you will be busy, and so shall I. The lay brothers have made but a poor hand of it, while I have been busy.

60|$|Last night, at a dinner-party where I was present, Mr. Peter Dunne Dooley {{handed to}} the host several dollars, in {{satisfaction}} of a lost bet. I seemed to see an opportunity to better my condition, and I invited Dooley, apparently disinterestedly, {{to come to my}} house Friday and play billiards. He accepted, and I judge <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to be a deficit in the Dooley treasury as a result. In great qualities of the heart and brain, Dooley is gifted beyond all propriety. He is brilliant; he is an expert with his pen, and he easily stands at the head of all the satirists of this generation--but he is going to walk in darkness Friday afternoon. It will be a fraternal kindness to teach him that with all his light and culture, he does not know all the valuable things; and it will also be a fraternal kindness to him to complete his education for him--and I shall do this on Friday, and send him home in that perfected condition.|$|E
60|$|After a few days, strange {{people begin}} to call at the house, and to make {{appointments}} {{with one another in}} the dining-room, as if they lived there. Especially, there is a gentleman, of a Mosaic Arabian cast of countenance, with a very massive watch-guard, who whistles in the drawing-room, and, while he is waiting for the other gentleman, who always has pen and ink in his pocket, asks Mr Towlinson (by the easy name of 'Old Cock,') if he happens to know what the figure of them crimson and gold hangings might have been, when new bought. The callers and appointments in the dining-room become more numerous every day, and every gentleman seems to have pen and ink in his pocket, and to have some occasion to use it. At last it is said <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to be a Sale; and then more people arrive, with pen and ink in their pockets, commanding a detachment of men with carpet caps, who immediately begin to pull up the carpets, and knock the furniture about, and to print off thousands of impressions of their shoes upon the hall and staircase.|$|E

60|$|The news <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to <b>be</b> {{a lively}} time drew {{a large crowd}} to the meeting in the gymnasium. This was called to order by the former manager of the eleven, and a call was issued for {{nominations}} for a new manager.|$|R
6000|$|But {{there is}} one feature in the past which {{more than all the}} rest defies and {{depresses}} the moderns and drives them towards this featureless future. I mean the presence in the past of huge ideals, unfulfilled and sometimes abandoned. The sight of these splendid failures is melancholy to a restless and rather morbid generation; and they maintain a strange silence about them--sometimes amounting to an unscrupulous silence. They keep them entirely out of their newspapers and almost entirely out of their history books. For example, they will often tell you (in their praises of the coming age) that we are moving on towards a United States of Europe. But they carefully omit to tell you that we are moving away from a United States of Europe, that such a thing existed literally in Roman and essentially in mediaeval times. They never admit that the international hatreds (which they call barbaric) are really very recent, the mere breakdown of the ideal of the Holy Roman Empire. Or again, they will tell you <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to be a social revolution, a great rising of the poor against the rich; but they never rub it in that France made that magnificent attempt, unaided, and that we and all the world allowed it to be trampled out and forgotten. I say decisively that nothing is so marked in modern writing as the prediction of such ideals in the future combined with the ignoring of them in the past. Anyone can test this for himself. Read any thirty or forty pages of pamphlets advocating peace in Europe and see how many of them praise the old Popes or Emperors for keeping the peace in Europe. Read any armful of essays and poems in praise of social democracy, and see how many of them praise the old Jacobins who created democracy and died for it. These colossal ruins are to the modern only enormous eyesores. He looks back along the valley of the past and sees a perspective of splendid but unfinished cities. They are unfinished, not always through enmity or accident, but often through fickleness, mental fatigue, and the lust for alien philosophies. We have not only left undone those things that we ought to have done, but we have even left undone those things that we wanted to do ...|$|E
