5|$|During the night, Warwick {{ordered his}} cannons to {{continually}} bombard the estimated {{position of the}} Yorkists' encampment. The Yorkists, however, had sneaked in close, and the Lancastrian artillery overshot their enemies. The Yorkist cannon, meanwhile, kept quiet to avoid betraying their location. As the armies settled down to rest, Montagu approached his brother and advised him of the troops' low morale. He suggested that, as the highest-ranking commanders, the brothers should fight on foot throughout the battle instead of riding on horse. The soldiers believed that mounted commanders tended to abandon them when the situation deteriorated. By staying on foot, the Nevilles would show that {{they were prepared to}} fight to the death with the men, inspiring the troops to stand and fight harder. Warwick agreed and the horses were <b>tethered</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rear, near Wrotham Wood.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, a 23-year-old {{woman in}} India, over eight months pregnant, hanged herself after contractions had begun.

The primary cause of the delivery was the otherwise normal contractions, which had begun prior to death, and was therefore not related to processes of decomposition. While this is not postmortem fetal extrusion, it may be referred to as a case of postmortem delivery, a term which is applied to a broad range of techniques and phenomena with a resultant delivery of a live infant.|$|E

5|$|To {{strengthen}} the defence further, by 1881, mines were {{laid in the}} waters between the two forts and the eastern entrance of the harbour. The mines were <b>tethered</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> seabed but floated dangerously {{under the surface of}} the water unseen to any enemy marine vessels. To enable safe passage of ships, a 'friendly safe channel' was created through the minefields. The work involved in the laying of minefields under the narrow channel (just 240 m apart) had actually led to rumours that tunnels running under the channels were constructed to link the two forts. There are, however, no archival records to prove that these tunnels were ever constructed.|$|E
5|$|The fate {{of these}} puffs—in particular, whether they remain {{restricted}} to isolated locales or integrated into Ca2+ waves for propagation throughout the cell—is determined {{in large part}} by MAM dynamics. Although reuptake of Ca2+ by the ER (concomitant with its release) modulates the intensity of the puffs, thus insulating mitochondria to a certain degree from high Ca2+ exposure, the MAM often serves as a firewall that essentially buffers Ca2+ puffs by acting as a sink into which free ions released into the cytosol can be funneled.

Normally, mild calcium influx from cytosol into the mitochondrial matrix causes transient depolarization that is corrected by pumping out protons.|$|E

40|$|The {{tethered}} satellite control mechanisms consist of four major subsystems. The reel drive mechanism stores the tether. It is motor driven {{and includes a}} level wind <b>to</b> uniformly feed <b>the</b> <b>tether</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> reel. The lower boom mechanism serves two primary functions: (1) it measures tether length and velocity as the tether runs through the mechanism, and (2) it reads the tether tension at the reel. It also provides change the direction for the <b>tether</b> from <b>the</b> reel <b>to</b> <b>the</b> upper boom mechanism. The deployment boom positions the upper boom mechanism with satellite out of the cargo bay. The deployment function places the 500 -kg satellite 20 m away from the Space Shuttle (producing a small natural gravity gradient force), impacts an initial velocity <b>to</b> <b>the</b> satellite for deployment, and allows for satellite docking {{at a safe distance}} from the body of the Space Shuttle. The upper boom mechanism (UBM) services three functions: (1) it provides <b>tether</b> control <b>to</b> <b>the</b> satellite as the satellite swings in and out of plane; (2) it reads tether tension in the low range during the early deployment and final retrieval parts of the mission; and (3) it produces additional tether tension at the reel when <b>tether</b> tension <b>to</b> <b>the</b> satellite is in the low range...|$|R

The CRABI 12 MO ATD with head, upper neck, and chest instrumentation was used in all tests. The tests were conducted using the ECE R 44. 02 test bench. Both frontal and rear impacts were performed and each condition was repeated for a total of 16 sled tests. Motions of the CRS and ATD were recorded using high-speed digital video (1000 fps). The highest ATD accelerations, forces, and moments were observed during the primary impact of a frontal test, rather than on rebound. The loads observed during rebound from frontal impact were similar in magnitude <b>to</b> <b>the</b> peak loads collected during rear impact. The four tethering geometries produced distinct loading patterns. The lowest HIC, neck forces, and chest accelerations in both impact directions were observed with the rearward tether. The upper neck moment data did not show a clear trend relative <b>to</b> <b>tethering</b> geometry. ATD and CRS motions were best controlled in frontal impact by the rearward tethering geometry while the motions in rear impact were best controlled by <b>tethering</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> floor.

GK:GKRP complexes are sequestered in the nucleus while glucose and fructose levels are low. Nuclear sequestration may serve to protect GK from degradation by cytoplasmic proteases. GK can be rapidly released from GKRP in response to rising levels of glucose. Unlike GK in beta cells, GK in hepatocytes is not associated with mitochondria.|$|E

25|$|The E2 protein {{serves as}} a master {{transcriptional}} regulator for viral promoters located primarily in the long control region. The protein has a transactivation domain linked by a relatively unstructured hinge region to a well-characterized DNA binding domain.

40|$|Abstract Present {{guidelines}} indicate <b>the</b> need <b>to</b> deorbit new satellites {{launched into}} low Earth orbit (LEO) within 25 years from their end of life. Our research {{task is to}} develop a new technology suitable to deorbit a satellite {{at the end of life}} with as small an impact as possible on the mass budget of the mission. An alternative <b>to</b> <b>the</b> traditional chemical rockets consists in using an electrodynamic tether that, through its interaction with the Earth ionosphere and magnetic field, can take advantage of Lorentz forces for deorbiting purposes. However, Lorentz forces produce a low and yet continuous injection of energy into the system that, in the long run, can bring <b>the</b> <b>tether</b> <b>to</b> instability. This paper addresses this issue through the analysis of the benefits provided by an elastic-viscous damping device installed at the attachment point of <b>the</b> <b>tether</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> spacecraft. The analysis carried out by means of linearization of dynamics equations and numerical simulations show that a well-tuned damper can efficiently absorb the kinetic energy from the tether thus providing system stability during deorbiting. @ CEAS 201...|$|R

40|$|Glucose {{transport}} in adipose {{cells is}} regulated {{by changing the}} distribution of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT 4) between the cell interior and the plasma membrane (PM). Insulin shifts this distribution by augmenting the rate of exocytosis of specialized GLUT 4 vesicles. We applied time-lapse total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy to dissect intermediates of this GLUT 4 translocation in rat adipose cells in primary culture. Without insulin, GLUT 4 vesicles rapidly moved along a microtubule network covering the entire PM, periodically stopping, most often just briefly, by loosely <b>tethering</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> PM. Insulin halted this traffic by tightly <b>tethering</b> vesicles <b>to</b> <b>the</b> PM where they formed clusters and slowly fused <b>to</b> <b>the</b> PM. This slow release of GLUT 4 determined the overall increase of the PM GLUT 4. Thus, insulin initially recruits GLUT 4 sequestered in mobile vesicles near the PM.
