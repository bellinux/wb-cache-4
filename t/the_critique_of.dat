5|$|Finally in 1859, Marx {{published}} A Contribution to <b>the</b> <b>Critique</b> <b>of</b> Political Economy, {{his first}} serious economic work. This work was intended {{merely as a}} preview of his three-volume Das Kapital (English title: Capital: Critique of Political Economy), which he intended to publish at a later date. In A Contribution to <b>the</b> <b>Critique</b> <b>of</b> Political Economy, Marx accepts the labour theory of value as advocated by David Ricardo, but whereas Ricardo drew a distinction between use value and value in commodities, Ricardo always {{had been unable to}} define the real relationship between use value and value. The reasoning Marx laid out in his book clearly delineated the true relationship between use value and value. He also produced a truly scientific theory of money and money circulation in the capitalist economy, thus A Contribution to <b>the</b> <b>Critique</b> <b>of</b> Political Economy created a storm of enthusiasm when it appeared in public and the entire edition of the book was sold out quickly.|$|E
5|$|As with {{cultural}} studies, media {{study is a}} distinct discipline that owes to the convergence of sociology and other social sciences and humanities, in particular, literary criticism and critical theory. Though the production process or <b>the</b> <b>critique</b> <b>of</b> aesthetic forms {{is not in the}} remit of sociologists, analyses of socializing factors, such as ideological effects and audience reception, stem from sociological theory and method. Thus the 'sociology of the media' is not a subdiscipline per se, but the media is a common and often-indispensable topic.|$|E
5|$|Given the {{repeated}} failures and frustrations of workers' revolutions and movements, Marx {{also sought to}} understand capitalism and {{spent a great deal}} of time in the reading room of the British Museum studying and reflecting on the works of political economists and on economic data. By 1857, Marx had accumulated over 800 pages of notes and short essays on capital, landed property, wage labour, the state and foreign trade and the world market, though this work did not appear in print until 1939 under the title Outlines of <b>the</b> <b>Critique</b> <b>of</b> Political Economy.|$|E

40|$|The scandal {{surrounding}} R. D. Laing’s work concerns {{both his}} life and his theories. Given that there is sufficient biographical material on Laing already in existence, this thesis focuses upon his theoretical contributions. No substantial review and <b>critique</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> criticism of Laing is currently in existence. The main objectives of this thesis are to evaluate <b>the</b> <b>critiques</b> <b>of</b> Laing, and to examine these in the light of his contributions to social theory. <b>The</b> <b>critiques</b> <b>of</b> Laing fall into three main categories: conservative critiques by psychiatrists, feminist critiques, and left-wing criticism. The methodological problems involved in <b>the</b> production <b>of</b> a <b>critique</b> are highlighted within each category of criticism. Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>critiques</b> <b>of</b> Laing constitute little other than criticism of the critic’s own misreading and misinterpretation of his work, which omit the lack of textual evidence to support the critic’s claims. The lines of development of key concepts within Laing’s work, and his intentions for his projects, may be ignored. Laing’s feminist critics view his work as prejudiced against women...|$|R

25|$|Kant {{argued that}} our {{experiences}} are structured by necessary features of our minds. In his view, the mind shapes and structures experience so that, on an abstract level, all human experience shares certain essential structural features. Among other things, Kant {{believed that the}} concepts {{of space and time}} are integral to all human experience, as are our concepts of cause and effect. One important consequence of this view is that our experience of things is always of the phenomenal world as conveyed by our senses: we do not have direct access to things in themselves, the so-called noumenal world. Kant published other important works on ethics, religion, law, aesthetics, astronomy, and history. These included <b>the</b> <b>Critique</b> <b>of</b> Practical Reason (Kritik der praktischen Vernunft, 1788), the Metaphysics of Morals (Die Metaphysik der Sitten, 1797), which dealt with ethics, and <b>the</b> <b>Critique</b> <b>of</b> Judgment (Kritik der Urteilskraft, 1790), which looks at aesthetics and teleology.|$|E
25|$|The Groundwork {{is broken}} into a preface, {{followed}} by three sections. Kant's argument works from common reason {{up to the}} supreme unconditional law, {{in order to identify}} its existence. He then works backwards from there to prove the relevance and weight of the moral law. The third and final section of the book is famously obscure, and it is partly because of this that Kant later, in 1788, decided to publish <b>the</b> <b>Critique</b> <b>of</b> Practical Reason.|$|E
25|$|Kant {{published}} a second edition of <b>the</b> <b>Critique</b> <b>of</b> Pure Reason (Kritik der reinen Vernunft) in 1787, heavily revising the first {{parts of the}} book. Most of his subsequent work focused on other areas of philosophy. He continued to develop his moral philosophy, notably in 1788's Critique of Practical Reason (known as the second Critique) and 1797's Metaphysics of Morals. The 1790 Critique of Judgment (the third Critique) applied the Kantian system to aesthetics and teleology.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> {{principal}} <b>critique</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> regional {{concept was}} that a region could {{be no more than}} the sum of its parts and therefore it could have no separate existence. The synergetics paradigm effectively eliminates the reductionism - holism debate. Were the region to be considered as a self-organizing complex system, <b>the</b> reductionist <b>critique</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> regional concept could be countered. Additionally, there are parallels between the application of the synergetics paradigm to geography and some developments in 'nonpositivist' geography. These developments could answer parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nonpositivist <b>critique</b> <b>of</b> 'positivist' geography and possibly bring the two schools of thought closer together. ...|$|R
