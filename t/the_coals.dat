5|$|There are argentiferous (i.e. silver-bearing) galena {{deposits}} on Flat Holm; {{the pits}} and mounds {{visible on the}} surface of the island are a result of trial borings. A dispute over lead mining rights in the 1780s ended with John Stuart, Lord Mount Stuart making an official complaint that the lighthouse keeper was using <b>the</b> <b>coals</b> intended for the lighthouse for processing lead. Mining for lead was not profitable, however, and the works were abandoned. Red marl from the Triassic Period fills joints in the Carboniferous Limestone showing evidence of karstic (cave forming) processes during this period. Caves on the western and north-eastern sides of the island were used during the years of smuggling.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{acoustic}} emission {{technique is}} used to research the deformation and the failure process, investigate the deformation and injury regularity, discuss the physical process of acoustic emission of <b>the</b> <b>coal</b> and gas outburst and reveal the evolution process and disaster mechanism of <b>the</b> <b>coal</b> rock dynamic disaster.

25|$|British usage, barbecuing {{refers to}} a fast cooking process done {{directly}} over high heat, while grilling refers to cooking under a source of direct, moderate-to-high heat—known in the United States as broiling. In American English usage, grilling {{refers to a}} fast process over high heat while barbecuing refers to a slow process using indirect heat or hot smoke, similar to some forms of roasting. In a typical U.S. home grill, food is cooked on a grate directly over hot charcoal, while in a U.S. barbecue <b>the</b> <b>coals</b> are dispersed to the sides or at a significant distance from the grate.

25|$|In the begin of {{the late}} Triassic, high volumes of sediments {{accumulate}} off of the shoreline of western Australia to the northern extend of the Exmouth Plateau by the Mungaroo Deltas. The Carnian (237-228 Ma) to Norian (228-209 Ma) aged fluviodeltaic sediments deposited were siliciclastic claystones and sandstones, and detritus which would late make up <b>the</b> <b>coals</b> found in Mungaroo Formation. As extensional rifting between Greater Indian and the Australian continued, magmatic intrusion along the westernmost section of the Exmouth Plateau caused further rifting to the outer margins. By {{the end of the}} Late Triassic (209-201 Ma) tectonic activity had relatively slowed down and less deltaic sediments were deposited compared to the Carnian and Norian. More marine sedimentary deposit such as carbonates are found during this time period.|$|E
30|$|In {{front of}} <b>the</b> <b>coal</b> wall at <b>the</b> working face, the {{movement}} of <b>the</b> top <b>coal</b> and roof mainly showed a horizontal deformation under the abutment pressure due to the vertical constraints of <b>the</b> top <b>coal</b> and roof. At the rear of <b>the</b> <b>coal</b> wall which was under the repeated loading and unloading actions, the vertical constraints on {{the lower part of}} <b>the</b> top <b>coal</b> exhibited subsidential weakening with <b>the</b> advance of <b>coal</b> cutting resulting in a large space. Therefore, {{the movement of}} roof appeared as fracture subsidence and the movement of <b>the</b> top <b>coal</b> appeared as vertical displacement caused by the roof fracture subsidence. There was a large difference in accumulated top coal and roof displacement in the front and in the rear of <b>the</b> <b>coal</b> wall. In addition, the difference of displacement per unit advance was relatively large. The displacement rate of <b>the</b> top <b>coal</b> in front of <b>the</b> <b>coal</b> wall was 2.63 and 42.29  mm/m at rear of <b>the</b> <b>coal</b> wall. <b>The</b> displacement rate of the roof in front of <b>the</b> <b>coal</b> wall was 5.4  mm/m, and 21.35  mm/m at rear of coal wall. It demonstrated that the horizontal deformation rate of <b>the</b> top <b>coal</b> and roof caused by abutment pressure in front of <b>the</b> <b>coal</b> wall was much less than the vertical subsidence rate of <b>the</b> top <b>coal</b> and roof at rear of coal wall.|$|R

25|$|In October 1911, Churchill was {{appointed}} First Lord of the Admiralty and {{continued in the}} post into the First World War. While serving in this position, he put strong emphasis on modernisation and was also in favour of using aeroplanes in combat. He undertook flying lessons himself. He launched a programme to replace coal power with oil power. When he assumed his position, oil was already being used on submarines and destroyers, but most ships were still coal-powered, though oil was sprayed on <b>the</b> <b>coals</b> to boost maximum speed. Churchill began this programme by ordering that the upcoming s were to be built with oil-fired engines. He established a Royal Commission chaired by Admiral Sir John Fisher, which confirmed the benefits of oil over coal in three classified reports, and judged that ample supplies of oil existed, but recommended that oil reserves be maintained {{in the event of}} war. The delegation then travelled to the Persian Gulf, and the government, largely through Churchill's advice, eventually invested in the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, bought most of its stock, and negotiated a secret contract for a 20-year supply.|$|E

Sviatoslav was tutored by a Varangian named Asmud. The tradition of employing Varangian tutors for the sons of ruling princes survived well into the 11th century. Sviatoslav appears to have had little patience for administration. His life was spent with his druzhina (roughly, [...] "company") in permanent warfare against neighboring states.
