5|$|Mosley {{was elected}} to his third term as {{president}} of the FIA in 2001. From 2000, Formula One saw the return of teams partly or wholly owned and operated by major motor manufacturers, who feared that under Ecclestone's management F1 coverage would go to pay television, reducing the value of their investment. In 2001, the Grand Prix Manufacturers Association (GPMA) announced an alternative world championship, the Grand Prix World Championship <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>by</b> 2008. The GPMA stipulated that the championship should not be regulated by the FIA, which Lovell believes was because the organisation believed Mosley was too close to Ecclestone. The proposed championship came to nothing and the GPMA later became the Formula One Teams Association (FOTA).|$|E
5|$|The Army of Rhin-et-Moselle led by Jean Victor Marie Moreau was {{deployed}} {{with its}} right flank at Huningue, its {{center on the}} Queich River and its left flank at Saarbrücken. The Army of Sambre-et-Meuse commanded by Jean-Baptiste Jourdan was responsible for a line running north from Sankt Wendel to Cologne, while the 22,000 men of its left wing under Jean-Baptiste Kléber held Düsseldorf. The French grand strategy designed by Minister of War Lazare Carnot was for each of their two armies to turn the Austrian flanks. The strategic plan called for Jourdan <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>by</b> advancing by his left wing and was designed to accomplish two goals. First, {{it was hoped that}} this would cause the Austrians to abandon {{the west bank of the}} Rhine. Second, the move would draw Austrian strength north and allow Moreau's army a better chance to cross the Rhine in the south.|$|E

25|$|The {{first phase}} of Line 4 will be between Alsos Veikou and Goudi stations, {{predicting}} fourteen (14) new stations and a length of 11.7km of new track.

The construction is expected <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>by</b> mid-2017 and the opening of the line by circa 2025.

Currently, the project of the first phase is considered to follow a PPP scheme which might be extended for constructing the whole new line. An alternative solution is a mixed funding between the EIB and the Greek State.

25|$|Holden {{announced}} on December 22, 2008 that its Elizabeth, South Australia production line would be split to commence local {{production of the}} Cruze sedan and the Australian-developed hatchback. Production was originally scheduled <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>by</b> September 2010. However, it was confirmed in January 2010 that production would in fact begin in March 2011. The announcement to assemble the car came {{as a response to}} the slowing sales of the larger, locally produced Holden Commodore range. The Australian Government committed 149million to the program from its $6.2billion Green Car Innovation Fund, with a further $30million given by the State Government of South Australia. GM Holden matched both amounts, but the then chairman and managing director Mark Reuss would not reveal Holden's total investment. Reuss announced his firm would be considering the utilization of liquid petroleum gas (LPG), compressed natural gas (CNG), ethanol (E85) flexible-fuel and petrol/electric hybrid start-stop system powertrain technologies. These technologies, if materialized, would supplement the four-cylinder petrol and diesel powertrain offerings already confirmed by Holden at the time of the announcement.|$|E

500|$|In 1949, Queens and Lower Manhattan {{residents}} {{complained that}} the Second Avenue Subway would not create better transit options for them. A year later, a revised plan was devised that involved connections from Queens. New York voters approved a bond measure for its construction in 1951, and the city was barely able to raise the requisite $559 million for the construction effort. However, {{the onset of the}} Korean War caused soaring prices for construction materials and saw the beginning of massive inflation. Money from the 1951 bond measure was diverted to buy new cars, lengthen platforms, and maintain other parts of the aging New York City Subway system. Out of a half-billion-dollar bond measure, only $112 million (...) , or 22% of the original amount, went toward the Second Avenue Subway. By then, construction was due <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>by</b> either 1952 or 1957, with estimated completion by 1958 at the earliest.|$|E
