40|$|The European Union has {{proposed}} that polychlorinated naphthalenes (PCNs) {{should be included}} in the annexes of the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants, signifying that there will be an increase in activities aimed at reducing PCN emissions. It has been speculated that the unintentional formation and emission of PCNs from industrial activities are the main current sources, because they have ceased to be manufactured as industrial chemicals in many countries. In this review, we provide a brief overview of recent progress in research into the unintentional formation and emission of PCNs from various industries that use <b>thermal</b> <b>processes.</b> The sampling and analysis of PCNs, and their formation mechanisms during <b>thermal</b> <b>processes,</b> are reviewed and discussed. The emission levels, emission profiles, and emission factors of PCNs from a number of industries that use <b>thermal</b> <b>processes</b> are summarized and compared, and this will provide helpful information for planning PCN source control measures and studying the source-receptor relationships of PCNs.

40|$|Abstract <b>Thermal</b> {{desalination}} <b>processes</b> {{account for}} about 50 % of the entire desalination market. The remaining market share {{is dominated by the}} reverse osmo-sis (RO) <b>process.</b> The main <b>thermal</b> desalination <b>processes</b> include multi-stage flash desalination (MSF), multiple-effect distillation (MED), and mechanical vapor com-pression (MVC). Other <b>thermal</b> desalination <b>processes,</b> e. g., solar stills, humidi-fication dehumidification, freezing, etc., are only found on a pilot or experimen-tal scale. <b>Thermal</b> desalination <b>processes</b> consume a larger amount of energy than RO; approximately the equivalent of 10 – 15 kWh/m 3 for <b>thermal</b> <b>processes</b> versus 5 kWh/m 3 for RO. Irrespective of this, the reliability and massive field experience in thermal desalination keeps its production cost competitive compared to the RO process. Also, the large scale production capacity for a single MSF unit, approxi-mately 75, 000 m 3 /day, is sufficient to provide potable water for 300, 000 inhabitants. An increase in production capacity for the MED system has been realised recently, with unit production capacities of up to 30, 000 m 3 /day.
