5|$|Nasser {{engaged in}} chain smoking. He {{maintained}} 18-hour workdays and rarely took <b>time</b> <b>off</b> <b>for</b> vacations.

He suffered two major heart attacks (in 1966 and 1969), and was on bed rest for six weeks after the second episode. State media reported that Nasser's absence from the public view at that time was a result of influenza.|$|E

Schmid's younger brother, Roland, lives in Sammamish, Washington, and having family in the area was one of the factors which persuaded Schmid to accept the job at Seattle. He also has a nephew and a niece named Graham and Mackenze.|$|E

The AC Sottevillais, founded in 1898, was run by a cycle-dealer, André Boucher, who had a shop in the Place du Trianon in Sotteville.

25|$|Garfield {{had been}} {{approached}} by Hollywood studios before—both Paramount and Warners offering screen tests—but talks had always stalled over a clause he wanted inserted in his contract, one {{that would allow him}} <b>time</b> <b>off</b> <b>for</b> stage work. Now Warner Bros. acceded to his demand, and Garfield signed a standard feature-player agreement—seven years with options—in Warner's New York office. Many in the Group were livid over what they considered his betrayal. Elia Kazan's reaction was different, suggesting that the Group did not so much fear that Garfield would fail, but that he would succeed. Jack Warner's first order of business was a change of name to John Garfield.|$|E
25|$|Booker was {{inducted}} into the WWE Hall of Fame by his brother, Stevie Ray, the night before WrestleMania 29. On the April 19 SmackDown, Booker became angry with Long for making matches without his consent. Big Show arrived and thanked Long for doing a better job than Booker, further infuriating him. On the April 22 Raw, upset with Long for making a World Heavyweight Championship match at Extreme Rules, made it a Triple Threat match. Booker took <b>time</b> <b>off</b> <b>for</b> a torn distal triceps, and had surgery for it on June 12.

25|$|After feuding {{intensely}} with André {{for more}} than a year, Bobby Heenan's Heenan Family challenged André and a partner of his choice to face King Kong Bundy and Big John Studd in a tag team match on April 26, 1986. When André did not show and was replaced by Ted Arcidi, Bobby Heenan launched a campaign to get him suspended from the WWF. After deliberating on the matter, WWF President Jack Tunney was forced to suspend him for missing the tag team match and subsequent matches against the Heenan Family. This was part of a wrestling storyline, to allow André <b>time</b> <b>off</b> <b>for</b> production of the film The Princess Bride which was being filmed in the UK and also to allow him to fulfill a contracted tour of Japan. He was also beginning to develop health problems from the gigantism that caused his size that led him to having major back surgery and limited his wrestling ability at that time.|$|E
25|$|Throughout the 1930s, the {{economic}} impact of the Great Depression resulted in a period of austerity for Australia's military. The scarcity of employment meant that there were only limited numbers of volunteers as men who had jobs could not afford to risk them by taking <b>time</b> <b>off</b> <b>for</b> military training. In addition, equipment was scarce or obsolete and there were only limited training opportunities available for those that could parade. The reduced manning resulted in several battalions being amalgamated or disbanded. Of the 14th Brigade's units, this affected the 3rd Battalion, which was initially amalgamated with the 4th Battalion in 1930 and then later the 53rd, although these were later delinked in the late 1930s as the military was expanded due to concerns about war in Europe; the 53rd and 55th Battalions were also linked for a period during the 1930s. From 1933, Colonel Arthur Allan commanded the brigade, remaining in command until after the outbreak of World War II.|$|E
25|$|At WrestleMania 21, Venis {{competed in}} a 30-man Interpromotional battle royal which was won by Booker T. In {{the summer of}} 2005 he formed another team, V-Squared, with Viscera. While wrestling on Heat, they {{squashed}} {{a number of other}} tag teams including the World Tag Team Champions Lance Cade and Trevor Murdoch in a non-title match. On the December 5 episode of Raw, V-Squared participated in a fatal four way match for the World Tag Team Championship, including the champions Big Show and Kane, The Heart Throbs, and Snitsky and Tyson Tomko but were defeated. Venis and Viscera continued to team in 2006, getting another shot at Big Show and Kane's titles, while occasionally having solo matches. In March 2006, Venis suffered a kayfabe injury {{at the hands of the}} Spirit Squad which allowed him to take <b>time</b> <b>off</b> <b>for</b> legitimate elbow surgery, during which about a dozen more bone spurs were removed, six others were shaved down, and a nerve was transplanted.|$|E

25|$|At the 2011 WWE Draft, Rodriguez and Del Rio were drafted to the Raw brand; the duo {{clashed with}} Big Show when Rodriguez ran over Big Show's leg by using Del Rio's car. On June 6, Rodriguez masqueraded as Big Show as Del Rio mocked Big Show. On {{his return to}} Raw on June 13, Big Show {{attacked}} Del Rio. Rodriguez came to his employee's aid and he was brutally attacked which caused him to take <b>time</b> <b>off</b> <b>for</b> an injury. Rodriguez returned on July 18, 2011 On August 30 episode of SmackDown, when John Cena called out Del Rio, Rodriguez walked out alone to reply to Cena. Rodriguez spoke {{in a mixture of}} English and Spanish, explaining that Del Rio was not present. Cena then asked Rodriguez to deliver a message to Del Rio, and then promptly punched Rodriguez in the face. On the September 12 episode of Raw, Rodriguez wrestled his first match for the brand, teaming with Del Rio to lose to John Cena and Bret Hart.|$|E
25|$|Among PEF's major {{political}} initiatives {{at this time}} were a cost-of-living increase for worker pensions. Benson also said he would seek improvements to job security; accrual (rather than use-or-lose) for overtime, sick leave, and vacation; eliminate tiers in the pension plan; seek an end to penalties for early retirement; new workplace safety protections; {{an increase in the}} size of the state workforce; and new restrictions on contracting out. The state replied that it would seek a four-year wage freeze. Angered by the state's response in a time of budget surpluses, Benson led PEF workers in an extensive lobbying effort. He also said PEF would seek a three-year rather than four-year contract, and 5 percent per year wage increases. Benson also replaced the union's top negotiator in order to adopt a more aggressive stand with the state. The state countered with a 3 percent per year salary increase over four years, coupled with new restrictions on <b>time</b> <b>off</b> <b>for</b> union business, higher health care costs, and new worktime reporting requirements (all of which PEF rejected). At a rally at the state capital on January 5, 2000, some 5,000 (state estimate) to 25,000 (PEF estimate) workers peacefully confronted 25 Albany police and 300 New York State troopers. PEF revised its wage offer to 12 percent over three years. Benson accused the state in March 2000 of dragging out the negotiations, and began a statewide radio advertising campaign against the governor. In April, PEF accepted a contract with the New York State Canal Corporation with a 3 percent per year salary hike. Days later, after another state union accepted a contract containing a 13.6 percent raise over four years, about 2,000 PEF members held a noisy rally outside the governor's offices demanding faster negotiations. Two weeks afterward, PEF agreed to end its advertising campaign and rallies as a spur to negotiations. A week later, Governor George Pataki agreed to wage and pension COLAs. A tentative agreement reached on June 10, 2000, incorporated a 13 percent wage hike over four years, rejected the new working time data collection methods, and imposed slight increases in member health care payments. Union members approved the contract by a vote of 33,899 to 2,876.|$|E
