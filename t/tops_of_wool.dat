50|$|Packaging <b>of</b> <b>wool</b> has {{not changed}} much for centuries except that the early wool packs were made from jute, prior {{to the use of}} {{synthetic}} fibres. Jute packs were relatively heavy, weighing several kilograms each. In the 1960s polypropylene and high-density polyethylene (HDPE) packs were manufactured and used to make wool bales. Loose fibres from these packs caused contamination <b>of</b> the <b>wool</b> in the bale and led to nylon becoming the regulation fabric used in Australia, In South Africa woven paper was tested but discontinued in 1973 due to poor wet strength and high cost. Regulation standard white nylon packs now have a 280 mm label sewn onto the <b>top</b> flap <b>of</b> the <b>wool</b> pack for inclusion of the farm brand, wool description, bale number, woolclasser stencil number and bin code. Each bale <b>of</b> <b>wool</b> packs contains 50 packs that measure 70 x 70 cm x 98 cm and have 46 cm flaps.|$|R

30|$|The {{following}} steps {{were performed to}} prepare the column. In this step, a clean column (1.5 × 50 cm) with a glass wool at the bottom was used. It is notable that the applied glass container and column have to be washed with soapy water, rinsed with distilled water and {{a small amount of}} acetone, and ultimately dried in an oven. A small amount (0.5 cm) of dry sand was added to the column on <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the glass <b>wool.</b> The column was filled with the stationary phase including different percentages of silica gel, AC, and celite. Hexan was added to the beaker containing stationary phase as a solvent. The contents of the beaker were stirred to remove air bubbles, and solid particles were allowed to get wet. A funnel was placed on <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the column, and the stationary phase was poured quickly into the column. If necessary, the columns' stopcock will be opened, and some of the hexane was drained away to the stationary phase. This process was repeated until most of the stationary phase transferred to the column. The column was then gently tapped in order to remove the bubbles and compress the stationary phase; 1 cm of sand was smoothly added to the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the stationary phase. The stopcock was opened, and the excess hexane was drained until its level reaches above the sand level.|$|R

60|$|It is observable, {{by a very}} {{critical}} account <b>of</b> the <b>wool</b> produced annually in Romney marsh, in the county of Kent, and published in the said Plan of the English Commerce, that the fleeces <b>of</b> <b>wool</b> <b>of</b> those large sheep, generally weigh above four pounds and a half each. It is computed thus; first he tells us that Romney marsh contains 47,110 acres of land, that they feed 141,330 sheep, whose wool being shorn, makes up 2,523 packs <b>of</b> <b>wool,</b> the sum <b>of</b> which is, that every acre feeds three sheep, every sheep yields one fleece, and 56 fleeces make one pack <b>of</b> <b>wool,</b> all which comes out to 2,523 packs <b>of</b> <b>wool,</b> twenty-three fleeces over, every pack weighing two hundred and forty pounds <b>of</b> <b>wool.</b> Vide Plan, &c. p. 259.|$|R

50|$|In {{addition}} to Cretan styles, Cycladic clothing was worn as pants across the continent. A triangular front released the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the thighs.

However, long clothing was worn for protection against bad weather and eventually a coat <b>of</b> <b>wool</b> was used by the Greeks.|$|R
50|$|Brisbane and its port thrived because <b>of</b> <b>wool</b> {{production}} and the processing <b>of</b> <b>wool</b> operated throughout Brisbane and its surrounds.

40|$|Abstract. With the {{increase}} in the environmental protection consciousness of people, attention has focused on plasma technology because of its efficiency and environmentally friendliness. In order to improve the dyeing behavior <b>of</b> <b>wool</b> fabrics, surface modification <b>of</b> <b>wool</b> fabrics was carried out using an atmospheric pressure (argon) low temperature plasma treatment (LTP). Morphology and chemical composition analyses <b>of</b> the treated <b>wool</b> fiber surface were carried out by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The effect on the surface properties <b>of</b> <b>wool</b> fabrics treated for different times was evaluated. The results showed that the coloration <b>of</b> <b>wool</b> fabric is improved with an argon atmospheric pressure low temperature plasma (LTP) treatment but the fabric has a lower color fastness to washing and rubbing. This results from the formation of sulfonic groups and {{the increase}} in nitrogen content attributed to more severe etching and oxidization on the surface <b>of</b> <b>wool</b> fibers...|$|R
50|$|A micron (micrometre) is the {{measurement}} {{used to express}} the diameter <b>of</b> <b>wool</b> fibre. Fine wool fibers have low micron value. Fibre diameter {{is the most important}} characteristic <b>of</b> <b>wool</b> in determining its greasy value.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{heat and}} flame {{resistance}} of the high performance fibers poly-p-phenylenediamine-terephthalamide (PPTA), co-poly (p-phenylene- 3, 4 -oxi-diphenylene-terephthalamide) (TECH) and Poly (p-phenylene- 2, 6 -benzobis-oxazole) (PBO) fibers is studied. It is shown that for an organic polymer PBO has exceptional heat and fire resistance. Blends <b>of</b> <b>wool</b> with high performance fibers is studied in order to investigate possible synergistic effect. Blends <b>of</b> <b>wool</b> with PBO do not enhance the FR performance <b>of</b> <b>wool.</b> Blends <b>of</b> <b>wool</b> with p-aramides (PPTA and TECH) improves the FR performance and the thermal stability of the whole textile. Synergistic effects are suggested in terms of Rate of Heat Release (RHR) peak. A mechanism of action explaining the enhanced performance is proposed...|$|R
