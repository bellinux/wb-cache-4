The roadway follows the terrain {{through a series of}} hairpin <b>turns</b> <b>as</b> it climbs in elevation. Once SR 89A reaches passes over the mountains, it begins its descent into the Verde Valley. During its descent, SR 89A enters the town of Jerome. In Jerome, the highway provides access to the nearby Jerome State Historic Park.|$|E

Grant has expanded his oeuvre with critically acclaimed <b>turns</b> <b>as</b> a cad in Bridget Jones's Diary (2001), About a Boy (2002), and American Dreamz (2006). Grant later played against type with multiple cameo roles in the epic sci-fi drama film, Cloud Atlas (2012). He is also known for appearing in period pieces such as The Remains of the Day (1993), Sense and Sensibility (1995) and Florence Foster Jenkins (2016).|$|E
5|$|From 1916 to 1934, Landgren and Janne Johansson took <b>turns</b> <b>as</b> {{chairman}} of the club. Landgren was first chairman between 1916 and 1918, then Johansson held the post from 1919 to 1921, when Landgren became chairman again. Johansson replaced him once more in 1927, but Landgren took over more permanently a year later. Landgren's last term as chairman lasted until 1934, when he was suspended {{along with the rest}} of the club's board of directors and several of its players, soon after the side was found to have breached the ban on professional players then active in Swedish football. The team was barred from playing for the rest of the season, and demoted a division.|$|E

5|$|Hadji Ali (c.1887–92– November5, 1937) was a {{vaudeville}} performance artist, {{thought to}} be of Egyptian descent, who was famous for acts of controlled regurgitation. His best-known feats included water spouting, smoke swallowing, and nut and handkerchief swallowing followed by disgorgement in an order chosen by the audience. Ali's most famous stunt, and the highlight of his act, was drinking copious amounts of water followed by kerosene, and then acting by <b>turns</b> <b>as</b> a human flamethrower and fire extinguisher as he expelled the two liquids onto a theatrical prop. While these stunts were performed, a panel of audience members was invited to watch the show up close to verify that no trickery was employed.|$|E
5|$|Continuing eastward, {{the drive}} descends down the {{mountain}} toward Copper Harbor. The roadway twists and <b>turns</b> <b>as</b> it alternately climbs and descends several smaller hills along the ridgeline. Along the drive, several viewpoints provide the opportunity to pull off and take in the surroundings. A few of them lie directly adjacent to {{the face of the}} bluff where the mountain quickly rises from the surrounding land. Near the eastern end, there are two sharp hairpin turns, the first of which has a scenic overlook and parking area. This spot overlooks Copper Harbor and the nearby Copper Country Trail National Scenic Byway portion of US Highway 41 (US41) just to the east. From here, the road makes its steep descent down from the ridge, through the second turn and ends at M-26 on the western edge of town.|$|E
5|$|Signage for SR 67 {{begins at}} Bright Angel Point along the North Rim of the Grand Canyon National Park. ADOT does not officially own {{this section of}} road, but it is signed as SR 67. The road heads north as the Kaibab Plateau North Rim Parkway through {{the small town of}} North Rim, {{surrounded}} by evergreen trees. The parkway enters a small clearing before meeting the park entrance, where ownership by ADOT begins. Heading into Kaibab National Forest on a northward path, the roadway is surrounded by a narrow meadow bordered by evergreen trees. As it passes the nearby Deer Lake, SR 67 meets an unpaved National Forest road. The landscape around the route is crisscrossed by these routes as SR 67 makes several turns, turning back toward the north. The highway, with the new name of Grand Canyon Highway in addition to its other designation, makes several <b>turns</b> <b>as</b> it heads north through the woods. It takes a more northwesterly path as it runs through Coconino County. Near its terminus, the road turns back northeast toward its terminus at US 89A in Jacob Lake.|$|E

5|$|They added American touches to the course. They {{used the}} names of American birds for patrol names; {{challenged}} patrols {{to make their own}} flags instead of using store-bought flags; introduced patrol totems and signatures; and added singing Back to Gilwell when each patrol's name was mentioned. Each member took <b>turns</b> <b>as</b> the patrol leader, and they met daily as the Patrol Leaders Council to conduct daily inspections. The staff taught course attendees basic Scout requirements and how to handle the U.S. flag. The patrols took an unsupervised patrol hike and overnight camp. Other American features included a program and a service patrol, a cracker barrel after each evening's event, a feast, and other ceremonies. The first course, begun on July 31, 1948, was attended by 29 men from 12 states. Although it rained on four of the nine days, the Scouters were excited by the experience and enthusiastic about sharing it with others.|$|E

The street Ffordd Pen Llech in Harlech, Wales has a reported slope of 36.6% (rounded to 40% on the warning sign). Vale Street in Bristol is often also reported as the steepest street in Britain (21.81°/40.02%) and hence may have a slope even steeper than 36.6%. However, these roads are mostly shorter roads than those listed above, with far more frequent <b>turns</b> <b>as</b> opposed to the straight path of Baldwin.|$|E

25|$|As the World Turns (often {{referred}} to as ATWT) is an American television soap opera that aired on CBS for 54 years from April 2, 1956, to September 17, 2010. Irna Phillips created As the World <b>Turns</b> <b>as</b> a sister show to her other soap opera Guiding Light. Running for 54 years, As the World Turns holds the second-longest continuous run of any daytime network soap opera on American television, surpassed only by Guiding Light. As the World Turns was produced for the first 43 years in Manhattan and in Brooklyn from 2000 until 2010.|$|E
25|$|The {{premise of}} many {{role-playing}} games tasks the player with saving the world, or whichever level of society is threatened. There are often twists and <b>turns</b> <b>as</b> the story progresses, {{such as the}} surprise appearance of estranged relatives, or enemies who become friends or vice versa. The game world tends to be set in a fantasy or science fiction universe, which allows players to do things they cannot do in real life and helps players suspend their disbelief about the rapid character growth. To a lesser extent, settings closer {{to the present day}} or near future are possible.|$|E

25|$|January 1, 2004: The {{pilot and}} {{passenger}} of a Bellanca 17-30A Super Viking, registration number N4104B, died when the aircraft struck {{houses in the}} Preston Hollow neighborhood of nearby Dallas, Texas after departing from Addison Airport bound for Amarillo, Texas. An intense post-crash fire destroyed two houses {{and the remains of}} the Bellanca, but an elderly resident of one house escaped injury after being dragged out of the burning structure by his caregiver, who was also unhurt. The crash was attributed to spatial disorientation in densely clouded IFR conditions; the pilot had reported a partial instrument panel failure, after which radar data indicated that he was making left turns instead of right <b>turns</b> <b>as</b> directed by air traffic controllers.|$|E
25|$|As {{that year}} began, Another World was {{expanded}} to 60 minutes, {{with their first}} hour-long episode airing on January 6, 1975. Although this did not directly affect As the World <b>Turns,</b> <b>as</b> the two shows were not in competition for {{anything other than the}} overall ratings win, CBS' afternoon lineup suffered some ratings damage as the popular soap put a dent in the ratings of both of CBS' popular afternoon game shows, The Price Is Right and Match Game. NBC, pleased by the success that the expansion of Another World had brought to the network, elected {{to do the same thing}} with Days of Our Lives beginning on April 21, 1975; this put Days of Our Lives and As the World Turns in direct competition for ratings. Incidentally, the expansions were occurring seven years after the last two 15-minute serials, Search for Tomorrow and The Guiding Light, expanded to 30 minutes.|$|E
25|$|After running closely behind {{teammate}} Rosberg {{and feeling}} the wind penetrating his visor, Hamilton got some dirt {{in his left}} eye on lap 66 and slowed down in the circuit's low-speed <b>turns</b> <b>as</b> a result, allowing Ricciardo to close up to Hamilton. Hülkenberg had heavily worn rear super soft tyres, and by the 69th lap, was caught by McLaren drivers Button and Magnussen. Bianchi {{was told that he}} needed a five-second advantage over Grosjean to negate the time penalty. Five laps later, Button overtook teammate Magnussen on the main straight for sixth, Räikkönen then attempted to do the same around the inside at the Loews hairpin on lap 74 but ran too deep, leaving both himself and Magnussen in the barrier. Both Räikkönen and Magnussen managed to reverse out of the barrier but lost a large amount of time, thus promoting Bianchi to eighth and Grosjean to ninth. Räikkönen had to make a third pit stop for a new front wing and had super soft tyres fitted.|$|E

25|$|Historically, {{the track}} gauge has had {{considerable}} variations, with narrow gauge common in many early systems. However, most light rail systems are now standard gauge. Older standard-gauge vehicles could not negotiate sharp <b>turns</b> <b>as</b> easily as narrow-gauge ones, but modern light rail systems achieve tighter turning radii by using articulated cars. An important advantage of standard gauge is that standard railway maintenance equipment {{can be used}} on it, rather than custom-built machinery. Using standard gauge also allows light rail vehicles to be moved around, conveniently using the same tracks as freight railways. Another factor favoring standard gauge is that accessibility laws are making low-floor trams mandatory, and there is generally insufficient space for wheelchairs to move between the wheels in a narrow-gauge layout. Furthermore, standard-gauge rolling stock can be switched between networks either temporarily or permanently and both newly built and used standard-gauge rolling stock tends to be cheaper to buy, as more companies offer such vehicles.|$|E
25|$|The four {{remaining}} British battlecruisers {{were still}} ahead of Evan-Thomas' 5th BS when first contact {{was made with}} the HSF. Beatty ordered a reversal of course, now attempting to lead the German fleet northwards towards the British Grand Fleet. At this point a second signalling error occurred with flag signals sent to the 5th BS ordering it also to turn about. A signal was raised by Lion and seen by Barham as it steamed past the now retreating Lion in the opposite direction. However, the signal was not lowered (which was {{the point at which}} {{it was supposed to be}} carried out) until the battleships were dangerously close to the German fleet and under heavy fire, and then the order was to 'turn in succession'. This means each ship <b>turns</b> <b>as</b> it reaches exactly the same spot in the ocean, and in this situation marked out a perfect target area upon which the German fleet could aim as each British ship passed through it in turn. The last ship, Malaya, seeing the firefight ahead turned early.|$|E
25|$|In {{the second}} {{qualifying}} session, the session was red-flagged shortly after it started: Chiyo crashed at San Francisco Bend but the stoppage was short-lived as course workers worked swiftly to get running back under way. Lynn bettered Rosenqvist's benchmark first qualifying lap and recorded the fastest time which was suppressed shortly after by Derani. A second stoppage occurred when Sun and Mason crashed at Moorish corner just as Blomqvist went quickest. No driver managed a timed lap as Giovinazzi {{went into the}} barrier at Paiol turn, causing the third (and final) red flag. When the session restarted, Rosenqvist took provisional pole before Marciello denied him the position {{with a time of}} two minutes and 11.555 seconds. Rosenqvist slipstreamed other cars but was cautious in the final two <b>turns</b> <b>as</b> he was confident of pole position. Lynn was one-tenth of a second adrift in third place. Auer moved up from his provisional grid slot to start fourth despite stalling in the pit lane.at the third restart. Félix da Costa's effort in second qualifying dropped him to fifth while Blomqvist improved to sixth. His teammate Derani took seventh. The top ten was completed by Carlin runners with Jaafar leading Tincknell and King. Behind them {{the rest of the field}} lined up as Sims, Buller, Korjus, Sainz, Ocon, Latifi, Coletti, Sekiguchi, Wolf, Giovinazzi, Nakayama, van de Laar, Byrant-Meisner, Gelael, Mason, Jones, Chiyo and Sun. Jaafar, Nakayama and Jones each received penalties after second qualifying; Nakayama and Jones were demoted to the back of the grid for changing their engines while Jaafar dropped five places for a yellow flag infringement.|$|E
