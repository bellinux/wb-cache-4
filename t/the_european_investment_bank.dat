In several respects, project finance in Australia has been working with similar constraints for many years particularly for the delivery of privately financed infrastructure projects and public private partnerships. Finance typically involves the issue of short-dated debt or bonds refinanced every six to seven years and for some projects, using revaluation and refinancing to lower average cost of capital and replace equity with debt without affecting debt service coverage and loan valuation ratios. This approach requires a stable interest rate environment and the probability that asset values will increase during {{the early stages of the}} project during which significant de-risking has taken place. The study uses a cross-sectional analysis of PPP financing in Australia with six case studies, the Eastlink Motorway and Southern Cross Railway Station projects in Melbourne, the Airport Link and Clem 7 toll roads in Brisbane, and the Desalination Plant in Eastern Victoria, and the Reliance Rail project in New South Wales. The Victorian projects were commissioned under the Partnerships Victoria PPP policy framework between 2004 and 2009, which includes the global financial crises (GFC) of 2007 - 08 and following years. The Reliance Rail project was commissioned under the New South Wales Privately Financed Projects policy, and the two Brisbane toll road projects were contracted under Queensland PPP policy in 2008 and 2006 respectively. The object of the analysis is to identify common characteristics in the way long-term PPP projects are financed in Australia, differences to practices in overseas markets, and lessons learnt that may inform future PPP policy and private finance...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper was}} {{prepared}} for <b>the</b> 2000 <b>European</b> <b>Investment</b> <b>Bank</b> Conference on Economics and Finance: Regional development policy and convergence in the EU. This paper surveys the recent literature on convergence across countries and regions. We discuss the main convergence and divergence mechanisms identified in the literature and develop a simple model that illustrates their implications for income dynamics. We then review the existing empirical evidence and discuss its theoretical implications. Early optimism concerning {{the ability of a}} human capital-augmented neoclassical model to explain productivity differences across economies has been questioned on the basis of more recent contributions that make use of panel data techniques and obtain theoretically implausible results. Some recent research in this area tries to reconcile these findings with sensible theoretical models by exploring the role of alternative convergence mechanisms and the possible shortcomings of panel data techniques for convergence analysis.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} {{the evolution of the}} post- 60 mortality curve in the UK {{and its impact on the}} pricing of the risk associated with mortality improvements over time: so-called longevity risk. We introduce a two-factor stochastic model for the development of this curve through time. The first factor affects mortality-rate dynamics at all ages in the same way, whereas the second factor affects mortality-rate dynamics at higher ages much more than at lower ages. The paper then examines the pricing of longevity bonds with different terms to maturity referenced to different cohorts. We find that longevity risk over relativelyshort time horizons is very low, but at horizons in excess of 10 years it begins to pick up very rapidly. We propose a method for risk-adjusting the market price of a longevity bond which includes an allowance for parameter risk in the stochastic mortality model. We utilise the pricing information contained in <b>the</b> November 2004 <b>European</b> <b>Investment</b> <b>Bank</b> longevity bond to make inferences about the likely market prices of the risks in the model. Based on these, we investigate how future issues might be priced to ensure an absence of arbitrage between bonds with different characteristics...|$|R
