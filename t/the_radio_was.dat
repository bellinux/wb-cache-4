5|$|Another seven internees were {{executed}} by the Japanese authorities. These internees had possessed a radio set which they used to pass messages {{in and out of}} camp. <b>The</b> <b>radio</b> <b>was</b> discovered by the Japanese and the internees were arrested. The other internees were forced to watch their public torture. Military trials were subsequently held and on 29 October 1943, some of the internees {{were executed}} by being shot and at least one, John Fraser, was beheaded. Aside from this, the Japanese authorities had executed by decapitation, three Chinese policemen for bringing cigarettes and tobacco to the camp's internees.|$|E
5|$|On 25 June 1916, Brussels left Hoek van Holland {{bound for}} Harwich. Lights were shown {{from the beach}} and a flare was fired. A {{passenger}} {{is reported to have}} remained on deck and signalled to shore. Five German destroyers surrounded Brussels. The passengers were told to prepare to take to the lifeboats and orders were given for official papers to be destroyed, which was done successfully. Brussels was taken by the Germans, and <b>the</b> <b>radio</b> <b>was</b> destroyed. She was escorted into Zeebrugge and then to Bruges.|$|E
5|$|After Gallagher's {{team had}} {{returned}} to the Special Forces Camp, Van Cleeff waited on the runway for two minutes to extract the survivors, but when nobody appeared he pulled the throttle and took off. As soon as Van Cleeff's aircraft was airborne, another C-130 pilot reported to General McLaughlin that the evacuation had been completed, and the facility could now be destroyed at will. Van Cleeff quickly notified all aircraft in the vicinity that he had just reinserted the CCT. Gallagher's team searched the Special Forces compound, the Americal Division battalion command post, and the artillery compound, but everybody either had been evacuated or was dead. Additionally, Khâm Đức was in North Vietnamese hands, so Gallagher and the other two men ran to the ditch beside the runway, where they tried to make contact with the aircraft overhead, but <b>the</b> <b>radio</b> <b>was</b> disabled along with all other equipment. While waiting for a miracle, members of the CCT clashed with North Vietnamese troops who had set up a machine gun position beneath the wing of Delmore's crashed C-130, and successfully disabled their opponent's weapon.|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} to the H-11 and H-16 the H-20, equipped with two Jumo 211F-2s, had more powerful armament and radio communications. The defensive armament consisted of one MG 131 in an A-Stand gun pod for the forward mounted machine gun position. One rotatable Drehlafette DL 131/1C (or E) gun mount in the B-stand was standard and later MG 131 machine guns were added. Navigational direction-finding gear was also installed. The Peil G6 was added to locate targets and the FuBI 2H blind landing equipment was built in to help with night operations. <b>The</b> <b>radio</b> <b>was</b> a standard FuG 10, TZG 10 and FuG 16Z for navigating to the target. The H-20 also was equipped with barrage balloon cable-cutters. The bomb load of the H-20 could be mounted on external ETC 1000 racks, or four ESAC 250 racks. The sub variant H-20/R4 could carry 20 50kg (110lb) bombs as external loads.|$|E
5|$|On 1 January 1927, new {{regulations}} came into effect {{which meant that}} aircraft carrying 10 or more passengers would have to carry a radio operator {{in addition to the}} pilot. In February it was reported that a Notice to Airmen had been issued stating that aircraft coming from the Continent in conditions of poor visibility in which <b>the</b> <b>radio</b> <b>was</b> not functioning correctly should land at Lympne, where repair facilities were available. In April it was reported that a new wireless station was being built at Lympne and in May it was notified that the night light was again in operation at Lympne. In July, a new system was introduced for civil aircraft flying in bad visibility between Lympne and Croydon. They were not to follow the normal Lympne–Edenbridge–Caterham–Croydon route, but instead follow one of three notified alternate routes. Aircraft were to be notified by radio whenever such conditions were declared to be put into effect, or whenever the weather had improved. This was aimed at preventing mid-air collisions between civil aircraft and those operated by the Royal Air Force. From 7 to 21 August, 600 (City of London) Squadron AuxAF and 601 (County of London) Squadron AuxAF were both at Lympne on their annual camp. The squadrons were flying Avro 504N and de Havilland DH.9A aircraft. In October, a Notice to Airmen announced that the ground signals at Lympne would be displayed in a different arrangement than previously, standardisation of ground signals worldwide required the change which came into effect on 1 October. In December, a Notice to Airmen informed that in foggy weather the position of Lympne would be indicated by flares fired from the ground, to be seen by aircraft flying in the vicinity. Colour was to be at the discretion of the Civil Air Traffic Officer. The Notice to Airmen was quickly amended to state that the firing of red flares would be reserved to indicate that an aircraft was being instructed not to land at the airfield in question. In 1927 a Fokker F.VII of SABENA flew newspapers to Lympne.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>radio</b> <b>was</b> {{built and}} {{operated}} in the British other ranks' compound. The maker of <b>the</b> <b>radio</b> <b>was</b> Warrant Officer Leonard A. T. Beckett, an experienced radio engineer, who was assisted in its construction, operation, and concealment by {{a core group}} of three other soldiers. Before Beckett could begin on the radio he first had to make some of the tools needed, such as a lathe and a soldering iron. In addition to the genuine radio parts provided by the Chinese family and a few parts brought along with the men from Tanjung Priok, <b>the</b> <b>radio</b> <b>was</b> constructed from items as diverse as a deaf aid, the steering damper of a Norton motorcycle, a bakelite shaving soap container, an army mess tin, the backing of an old map case, pieces of glass, wire, mica and barbed wire, and parts stolen from Japanese-owned motor cars and motorcycles. The receiver was completed within four weeks of starting.|$|E

25|$|Once it was raised, Coast Guard {{officials}} from the Marine Investigation Office boarded the ferry and examined the pilot house. One of the radar sets was off, another was on. <b>The</b> <b>radio</b> <b>was</b> turned on, and tuned to channel 13, the same channel used by the river pilot.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>radio</b> <b>was</b> {{concealed}} {{during its}} construction {{in a large}} stewing-pot; once completed its hiding place was in a biscuit tin buried under the bakehouse fire in the British other ranks' compound. It was operated in the stores where it had a temporary hiding place in a false-bottomed table. Elaborate security proceedings to protect the radio were put in place, including a network of look-outs.|$|E
25|$|The C.200 {{featured}} a typical armament {{of a pair}} of 12.7mm (.5in) Breda-SAFAT machine guns; while these were often considered to be insufficient, the Saetta was able to compete with contemporary Allied fighters. According to aviation author Gianni Cattaneo, perhaps the greatest weakness of the C.200 had been its light machine gun armament. Moreover, <b>the</b> <b>radio</b> <b>was</b> not fitted as standard, while its flight characteristics, even if better than the G.50, were not easily mastered by the average Italian pilot, even after new wings, which provided for improved flight characteristics, had been adopted.|$|E

25|$|Despite the {{economic}} calamity facing {{the nation and}} his dim hopes for re-election, Hoover faced little opposition for re-nomination at the 1932 Republican National Convention. Some Republicans talked of nominating Coolidge, former Vice President Charles Dawes, or Senator Hiram Johnson, but all passed on the opportunity to challenge Hoover. Curtis was re-nominated as Hoover's running mate. Franklin D. Roosevelt won the presidential nomination on the third ballot of the 1932 Democratic National Convention, defeating the 1928 Democratic nominee, Al Smith. Speaker of the House John Nance Garner was nominated as Roosevelt's running mate. By 1932, <b>the</b> <b>radio</b> <b>was</b> in 12 million homes, changing the nature of presidential campaigns. No longer could presidents change {{the content of their}} speeches for each audience; anyone with a radio could listen to every major speech.|$|E
25|$|Ten people {{survived the}} crash, with {{the captain and}} a {{passenger}} being killed. The latter died after the accident of heart problems {{directly related to the}} stress of the incident. The accident occurred in an isolated area, with bad weather and inaccessibility for search and rescue troops. The passengers stayed at the aircraft for a day, waiting to be rescued. Kirkvaag was aware of the dangers of the injured and frozen passengers if they should fall asleep. They introduced a roll-call every ten minutes and Kirkvaag improvised a radio program to keep up the spirits. The accident and rescue operations generated a large media interest and especially <b>the</b> <b>radio</b> <b>was</b> a popular media to follow the development of the situation. This was intensified with a celebrity being amongst the passengers.|$|E
25|$|The {{interior}} was also completely redesigned for 1992. The Taurus received a new dashboard that, like the previous generation, {{was designed to}} be user friendly. Like the previous generation, it had all of the vehicle's main controls located near {{the left side of the}} dash, to be within the easy reach of the driver. Also like the previous generation, all of the controls were designed to be recognizable by touch, and to be operated by the driver without taking their eyes off the road. The new dash also contained three buttons to the right of the gauge cluster that allowed the driver to operate the radio without taking their eyes off the road. <b>The</b> <b>radio</b> <b>was</b> also redesigned, while the rest of the lower dash was carried over from the previous generation, as was the steering wheel. The new dash was also designed to contain a passenger's side airbag, a first of its kind. It was optional in 1991 in 1992 models, and became standard in 1993, making the Taurus the first car of its kind to have dual front airbags.|$|E

25|$|A dog-fight between around 100 {{aircraft}} broke out; it {{was difficult}} for the RAF fighters to co-ordinate attacks, since <b>the</b> <b>radio</b> <b>was</b> full of chatter between pilots and the Bf109s frustrated British attacks on the bombers. No 111 Squadron made head-on attacks into the Do17s and a Hurricane collided with a bomber, the body of Pilot Officer Higgs later being washed ashore in the Netherlands. The Do 17, flown Staffelkapitän (Squadron Leader) Hauptmann Krieger, also crashed with the loss of two crew. (Higgs may have been hit by Walter Oesau of III./JG 51 and lost control before the collision.) The interception managed to disrupt the bombing and only a 700 GRT sloop was sunk by the 150 bombs dropped. Six 64 Squadron Spitfires arrived and harassed the Germans {{all the way back to}} the French coast. A Bf110 was shot down by 64 Squadron and another by 56 Squadron, a Do17 was shot down by 111 and 66 squadron aircraft and two more were shot down by 32 Squadron. A Bf109 of 2./JG 3 and one from II./JG 51 were shot down and two were damaged, one pilot being rescued by a He59 and a Hurricane from 111 Squadron was damaged.|$|E
