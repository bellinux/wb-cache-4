5|$|A {{shipyard}} {{was established}} in Faversham by James Pollock & Sons (Shipbuilders) in 1916 {{at the request of}} Lord Fisher, the First Lord of The Admiralty, for manufacturing barges for landing craft. Faversham already had a tradition of shipbuilding, and it soon became a major contributor <b>to</b> <b>markets</b> throughout the world, producing vessels such as the Molliette and the Violette, both constructed of concrete. Over 1200 ships were built and launched from Faversham between 1916 and 1969.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Teaneck {{returned}} {{to being a}} quiet farm community. Fruits and vegetables grown locally were taken by wagon <b>to</b> <b>markets</b> in nearby Paterson and New York City. New growth and development were spurred in the mid-19th century by the establishment of railroads throughout the area. Wealthy New Yorkers and others purchased large properties on which they built spacious mansions and manor houses. They traveled daily to work in New York City, thus becoming Teaneck's first suburban commuters.|$|E

5|$|Cassava {{chips are}} a common food in much of Africa, {{including}} the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ghana and Malawi. In Ghana, cassava chips are called konkonte. Dried cassava chips are also used to supplement the carbohydrate content of livestock feed in Ghana. In Malawi, cassava chips are prepared by soaking cassava, slicing it, and then letting it dry. This is the primary means by which cassava is transported <b>to</b> <b>markets</b> from production areas.|$|E
5|$|Violence and {{economic}} pressure {{were used by}} the regime to encourage Jews to voluntarily leave the country. Jewish businesses were denied access <b>to</b> <b>markets,</b> forbidden to advertise in newspapers and deprived of access to government contracts. Citizens were harassed and subjected to violent attacks. Many towns posted signs forbidding entry to Jews.|$|E
5|$|Discrimination against Jews, longstanding but extralegal {{throughout}} much of Europe at the time, was codified in Germany immediately after the Nazi seizure of power on 30 January 1933. The Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service, passed on 7 April of that year, excluded most Jews from the legal profession and the civil service. Similar legislation soon deprived Jewish members of other professions {{of the right to}} practise. Violence and economic pressure were used by the regime to force Jews to leave the country. Jewish businesses were denied access <b>to</b> <b>markets,</b> forbidden to advertise in newspapers, and deprived of access to government contracts. Citizens were harassed and subjected to violent attacks and boycotts of their businesses.|$|E

25|$|Farm <b>to</b> <b>market</b> roads {{generally}} {{exist in}} rural areas. After {{the city or}} county acquires right-of-way, TxDOT builds and maintains the road. A number of these roads, generally west of US 281, are designated ranch <b>to</b> <b>market</b> roads, and one—Ranch Road 1—is simply a ranch road, serving the LBJ Ranch. Farm <b>to</b> <b>market</b> roads were first designated in 1941 and ranch <b>to</b> <b>market</b> roads in 1942. A number of farm <b>to</b> <b>market</b> roads in urban areas were re-designated in 1995 as urban roads but, amid much controversy, the markers were not changed.|$|R

5|$|Holden's {{most popular}} car to date, the Commodore, was {{introduced}} in 1978 as the VB. The new family car was loosely based on the Opel Rekord E body shell, but with the front from the Opel Senator grafted to accommodate the larger Holden six-cylinder and V8 engines. Initially, the Commodore maintained Holden's sales leadership in Australia. However, some of the compromises resulting from {{the adoption of a}} design intended for another market hampered the car's acceptance. In particular, it was narrower than its predecessor and its Falcon rival, making it less comfortable for three rear-seat passengers. With the abandonment of left-hand drive markets, Holden exported almost 100,000 Commodores <b>to</b> <b>markets</b> such as New Zealand, Thailand, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Indonesia, Malta and Singapore.|$|E
5|$|Home to Aboriginal {{groups for}} over 40,000 years, the Riverina was {{originally}} settled by Europeans in {{the mid-19th century}} as a pastoral region providing beef and wool <b>to</b> <b>markets</b> in Australia and beyond. In the 20th century, the development of major irrigation areas in the Murray and Murrumbidgee valleys {{has led to the}} introduction of crops such as rice and wine grapes. The Riverina has strong cultural ties to Victoria, and the region was the source of much of the impetus behind the federation of Australian colonies.|$|E
5|$|MD36 {{passes through}} the Georges Creek Valley, which {{has a long history}} of coal mining. In {{recognition}} of this, the MDSHA has designated MD36 as part of the Coal Heritage Scenic Byway. Coal mining was a major industry in western Maryland in the 19th century, with railroads being the major route connecting the coal mines <b>to</b> <b>markets</b> outside the Georges Creek Valley. Deep mining, which was the primary mining method used in western Maryland, declined in use after World WarII, replaced primarily by surface mining. Although Maryland coal production is now only a small fraction of total U.S. coal production, coal from the Georges Creek Valley is used to power the AES Warrior Run power plant in Cumberland.|$|E

5|$|Many unique {{varieties}} of mango are {{native to the}} country, most having been developed {{during the second half}} of the 20th century. New and improved mango varieties are still introduced <b>to</b> <b>markets</b> every few years. Arguably the most popular variety is the Maya type, which is small to medium in size, fragrant, colourful (featuring 3-4 colours) and usually fiberless. The Israeli mango season begins in May, and the last of the fruit ripen as October draws near. Different varieties are present on markets at different months, with the Maya type seen between July and September. Mangos are frequently used in fusion dishes and for making Sorbet.|$|E
5|$|Mills and workers' {{settlements}} {{were established}} at Belper, Darley Abbey, and Milford by Arkwright's competitors. Arkwright-type mills were {{so successful that}} sometimes they were copied without paying royalties to Richard Arkwright. The cotton industry in the Derwent Valley went into decline {{in the first quarter}} of the 19th century as the market shifted towards Lancashire which was better position in relation <b>to</b> <b>markets</b> and raw materials. The mills and their associated buildings are well preserved and have been reused since the cotton industry declined. Many of the buildings within the World Heritage Site are also listed buildings and Scheduled Monuments. Some of the mills now contain museums and are open to the public.|$|E
5|$|The main {{harvesting}} {{season for}} coffee in Rwanda is during the major rainy season, running from March {{to the end}} of May. At harvest time, farmers spend most of the day picking cherries by hand. In the evening, they carry them in traditional baskets woven from banana leaves to the washing station, which may be several hours away. Technicians hand-sort the beans to pick out the best cherries, those with a deep red colour, and return the remainder to the grower to be sold on <b>to</b> <b>markets</b> outside the Maraba process at a lower price. The technicians pay the grower US$0.10 per kilogram. This money accumulates, and the association pays it each fortnight into farmers' bank accounts.|$|E

5|$|Wagga Wagga grew quickly, {{reaching}} {{a population of}} 627 in 1861 and during that decade a number of hotels and stores opened, as well as professional services {{in the form of}} banks, solicitors, doctors and dentists. The Wagga Wagga Advertiser is still published today as The Daily Advertiser and commenced in 1868. Until the 1860s most goods were transported <b>to</b> <b>markets</b> by bullock wagon. For a short time, the arrival of faster, cheaper and more reliable riverboats allowed goods to be transported more easily to export markets. The riverboat era ended when the New South Wales government extended the railway line to North Wagga Wagga in 1878 and across the river to Wagga Wagga itself in 1881.|$|E
5|$|On November 18, 2010, Dunderdale and Premier Williams {{were joined}} by Nova Scotia Premier Darrell Dexter in announcing a $6.2billion {{agreement}} to develop {{the first phase of}} the Lower Churchill Project. Nalcor Energy, a Newfoundland and Labrador Crown corporation, signed a partnership agreement with Emera Inc. of Nova Scotia to develop the 824megawatts Muskrat Falls. The hydro development would see power from the falls transferred from Labrador to the island of Newfoundland via an underwater transmission link through the Strait of Belle Isle. Another underwater transmission link across the Gulf of St. Lawrence would bring power to Nova Scotia. Newfoundland and Labrador will use 40 percent of the hydro power itself and will be able to shut down the oil-burning Holyrood Thermal Generating Station. Emera Inc. will get 20% of the power for $1.2billion to sell to customers in Nova Scotia. The remaining 40 percent will be sold by Nalcor Energy <b>to</b> <b>markets</b> in Atlantic Canada and the Northeastern United States.|$|E
5|$|Other {{new markets}} were to follow. In 1834 Tudor sent {{shipments}} of ice to Brazil along with chilled apples, beginning the ice trade with Rio de Janeiro. These ships typically returned to North America carrying cargos of sugar, fruit and, later, cotton. Ice from traders in New England reached Sydney, Australia, in 1839, initially selling at three pence (£0.70) per pound (0.5kg), later rising to six pence (£1.40). This trade was to prove less regular, {{and the next}} shipments arrived in the 1840s. The export of chilled vegetables, fish, butter and eggs to the Caribbean and <b>to</b> <b>markets</b> in the Pacific grew during the 1840s, {{with as many as}} 35 barrels being transported on a single ship, alongside a cargo of ice. Shipments of New England ice were sent as far as Hong Kong, South-East Asia, the Philippines, the Persian Gulf, New Zealand, Argentina and Peru.|$|E

5|$|The period {{also saw}} the {{development}} of charter fairs in England, which reached their heyday in the 13th century. From the 12th century onwards, many English towns acquired a charter from the Crown allowing them to hold an annual fair, usually serving a regional or local customer base and lasting {{for two or three}} days. The practice increased in the next century and over 2,200 charters were issued <b>to</b> <b>markets</b> and fairs by English kings between 1200 and 1270. Fairs grew in popularity as the international wool trade increased: the fairs allowed English wool producers and ports on the east coast to engage with visiting foreign merchants, circumnavigating those English merchants in London keen to make a profit as middlemen. At the same time, wealthy magnate consumers in England began to use the new fairs as a way to buy goods like spices, wax, preserved fish and foreign cloth in bulk from the international merchants at the fairs, again bypassing the usual London merchants.|$|E
