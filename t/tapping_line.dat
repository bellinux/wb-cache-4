40|$|The pipe of a flow {{transmitter}} (FT) <b>tapping</b> <b>line</b> has failed by sulfide stress cracking (SSC). Analysis revealed numerous cracks on the pipe. The cracks {{were found to}} have nucleated from several pits located on the outer surface of the pipe. The nature of cracking indicates that the pipe has failed under hoop stress. Chemical analysis revealed significant amount of sulphur in the crack propagation front. Though chemical composition of the pipe material conforms to the specification, the hardness was found to be considerably higher (~ 251 HV) against the specification (~ 124 HV). Such a high hardness would promote sulfide stress cracking of the pipe, if sulphur is present in the environment. It is therefore, recommended to identify the source of sulphur and incorporate corrective measures. It is also suggested to maintain the hardness of pipe material according to the specification...|$|E

The derivation is performed by successively multi-plying the matrices of all coupled stages. Simultaneous equations for determining linewidth and line spacing of the coupled stages are established by total () of the filter specification and comparing the IL function with the canonical form. The results are provided for filters of order 6. Two filters with fractional bandwidths = 30 % are synthesized and demonstrated by sim-ulation using a full-wave software package.

5000|$|Beerstone is a buildup {{that forms}} when oxalate, proteins, and calcium or {{magnesium}} salts from the grains {{and water in}} the beer brewing process precipitate and form scale on kegs, barrels and <b>tap</b> <b>lines.</b> The minerals adsorb {{to the surface of}} the container first, driven by charge attractions. Proteins are often coordinated to these minerals in the solution and can bind with them to the surface. In other cases proteins also adsorb to the minerals on the surface, making deposits difficult to remove, as well as providing a surface that can easily harbor microorganisms. If built-up beer stone inside <b>tap</b> <b>lines</b> flakes off, it can negatively affect the quality of the finished product by making beer hazy and contributing [...] "off" [...] flavors.

40|$|A code {{generating}} device using lxN asymmetric POF coupler {{has been}} designed and fabricated. This code generating device {{is part of a}} novel portable optical access-card system. In this project, 1 x 2 Y-branch, 1 x 2 and 1 x 4 asymmetric couplers were developed. The design of the 1 x 2 asymmetric POF coupler utilized a simple tap off ratio (TOFR) design technique to tap off optical power from the main bus line. This asymmetric design was achieved by varying the size of the <b>tap</b> <b>line</b> while the bus line was fixed at 1 mm size. The device modeling was done using non-sequential ray tracing utilizing a metal-based hollow waveguide structure. The 1 x 2 Y-branch coupler device model shows a simple 3 dB device characteristics. The designed TOFR for the 1 x 2 asymmetric coupler varies from 33 % to 50 % for <b>tap</b> <b>line</b> width of 500 |jm to 1000 pin. The simulated TOFR however varies from 18. 8 % to 50 % for the same <b>tap</b> <b>line</b> width ranges. These couplers were fabricated using hollow waveguide structure with metal and acrylic-based mold inserts where designs were engraved onto the mold inserts using CNC machine. After engraving, short POF fibers were inserted into the input and output ports of the engraved slots and a top block was then placed on top of the mold insert and secured. The fabricated metal-based 1 x 2 Y-branch showed a minimum excess loss of 3 dB. The fabricated metal and acrylic based 1 x 2 asymmetric couplers showed TOFR variation between 10. 7 % to 47. 7 % and 10. 3 %o to 50 %) respectively. The insertion loss for the metal-based 1 x 2 asymmetric coupler at the <b>tap</b> <b>line</b> varies from 12. 7 dB to 21. 2 dB whereas for the bus line, the insertion loss was about 12 dB. The insertion loss for the 1 x 4 asymmetric coupler at the output ports varied from 17. 3 dB to 27. 7 dB. The high insertion loss of the metal-based devices was due to air gaps between the top block and the bottom mold insert, because of the non-flatness of the metal surfaces and causes light rays to escape from the hollow region.

40|$|Matched filter {{processing}} for {{pulse compression}} of phase coded waveforms {{is a classic}} method for increasing radar range measurement resolution. A generic approach for simulating high resolution range extended radar scenes in a Hardware in the Loop (HWIL) test environment is to pass the phase coded radar transmit pulse through an RF <b>tapped</b> delay <b>line</b> comprised of individually amplitude- and phase-weighted output taps. In the generic approach, the taps are closely spaced relative to time intervals equivalent to the range resolution of the compressed radar pulse. For a range-extended high resolution clutter scene, the increased number of these taps can make an analog implementation of an RF tapped delay system impractical. Engineers at the U. S. Army Aviation and Missile Research, Development and Engineering Center (AMRDEC) have addressed this problem by transferring RF <b>tapped</b> delay <b>line</b> signal operations to the digital domain.

40|$|In this work, we {{investigate}} issues on receiver design in direct-sequence code-division multiple-access (DS-CDMA) systems with aperiodic random signature sequences. The main {{objective is to}} design receiving structures capable of rejecting multiple-access interference (MAI), which is the major channel imperfection in DS-CDMA systems. The use of aperiodic random sequences, albeit more practical, presents some difficulties over the periodic sequence assumption usually made {{in the design of}} MAI rejecting receivers. To circumvent these difficulties, we propose a decentralized linear coherent receiver, which consists of the conventional sequence-matched filter followed by a <b>tapped</b> delay <b>line,</b> to achieve the desired MAI rejection capability. The proposed receiver is capable of utilizing the diversities provided by oversampling, electronically steerable antenna arrays, or multicarrier modulation to achieve MAI rejection by suitably choosing the weights in the <b>tapped</b> delay <b>line.</b> In addition to MAI, the receiver can also combat imperfections caused by fading channel environments and narrowband interference.

We also investigate the problem of chip waveform selection, and evaluate the performance of the proposed receiver in cellular wireless environments, in which DS-CDMA systems are often employed. ...|$|R
