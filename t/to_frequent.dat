5|$|The {{hills of}} Darjeeling {{are part of}} the Lesser Himalaya. The soil is chiefly {{composed}} of sandstone and conglomerate formations, which are the solidified and upheaved detritus of the great range of Himalaya. However, the soil is often poorly consolidated (the permeable sediments of the region do not retain water between rains) and is not considered suitable for agriculture. The area has steep slopes and loose topsoil, leading <b>to</b> <b>frequent</b> landslides during the monsoons. According to the Bureau of Indian Standards, the town falls under seismic zone-IV, (on a scale of I to V, in order of increasing proneness to earthquakes) near the convergent boundary of the Indian and the Eurasian tectonic plates and is subject <b>to</b> <b>frequent</b> earthquakes.|$|E

5|$|Most of Sikkim, {{including}} Gangtok, is underlain by Precambrian rocks {{which contains}} foliated phyllites and schists; slopes are therefore prone <b>to</b> <b>frequent</b> landslides. Surface runoff of water by natural streams (jhora) and man-made drains {{has contributed to}} the risk of landslides. According to the Bureau of Indian Standards, the town falls under seismic zone-IV (on a scale of I to V, in order of increasing seismic activity), near the convergent boundary of the Indian and the Eurasian tectonic plates and is subject <b>to</b> <b>frequent</b> earthquakes. The hills are nestled within higher peaks and the snow-clad Himalayan ranges tower over the town from the distance. Mount Kanchenjunga (8,598m or 28,208ft)—the world's third-highest peak—is visible {{to the west of the}} city. The existence of steep slopes, vulnerability to landslides, large forest cover and inadequate access to most areas have been a major impediment to the natural and balanced growth of the city.|$|E

5|$|The Communist Party USA was {{routinely}} harassed and {{oppressed by}} government officials, leading {{it to be}} the primary client of the ACLU. The Communists were very aggressive in their tactics, often engaging in illegal or unethical conduct, and this led <b>to</b> <b>frequent</b> conflicts between the Communists and ACLU.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} some relevant {{results of}} a novel variant of the Backpropagation Algorithm to be applied during the Multilayer Perceptrons learning phase. The novelty consists in a weighting operation when the MLP learns the weights. The purpose is to modify the Mean Square Error objective giving more relevance <b>to</b> less <b>frequent</b> training patterns and resting relevance <b>to</b> the <b>frequent</b> ones. The inherent statistical distribution of training patterns is used <b>to</b> quantify how <b>frequent</b> a pattern is. The results, applied to a radar detector, show that Backpropagation with Weighting training requires much less training patterns maintaining the Artificial Neural Network performance...|$|R

5|$|The crucial factor which {{frustrated}} firefighting efforts was the narrowness of the streets.

During the fire, the passages were additionally blocked by refugees camping in them amongst their rescued belongings, or escaping outwards, away from the centre of destruction, as demolition teams and fire engine crews struggled in vain to move in towards it.|$|E
