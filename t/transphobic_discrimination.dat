40|$|This paper reports some {{thoughts}} about homophobic and transphobic practices in a Queer framework. Departing from a training experience carried out within the European project Hermes ??? Linking network to fight sexual and gender stigma and addressed to first responders {{who deal with}} gender violence and homophobic and <b>transphobic</b> <b>discriminations,</b> some considerations {{about the meaning of}} these practices are developed. Homophobia and transphobia, indeed, are discursive and political practices coming from powerful and pervasive heterosexist matrix. As power and social subjection device, these practices are particularly insidious and subtle, so that they slightly strike even those who try to prevent or oppose them. From Foucault to Butler, passing through works by De Lauretis, Sedgwick and Norton, the authors try to demonstrate that these practices are a very dangerous attempt to repress Queer expressions...|$|R

[...] It lists its primary aim as ensuring that all Scottish schools offer an education that is inclusive of LGBT topics, and have outlined various methods to achieve this in its campaign pledge.|$|R

5000|$|Further {{discrimination}} is faced by gender nonconforming individuals, whether transitioning or not, due to displacement from societally acceptable gender binaries and visible stigmatization. According to the NTDS, transgender gender nonconforming (TGNC) individuals face between 8% and 15% {{high rates of}} self and social discrimination and violence than binary transgender individuals. Lisa R. Miller and Eric Anthony Grollman found in their 2015 study that [...] "gender nonconformity may heighten trans people's exposure to discrimination and health-harming behaviors. Gender nonconforming trans adults reported more events of major and everyday <b>transphobic</b> <b>discrimination</b> than their gender conforming counterparts." ...|$|E

40|$|The {{conceptualization}} of gender variant populations within studies have consisted of imposed labels and {{a diversity of}} individual identities that preclude any attempt at examining the variations found among gender variant populations, {{while at the same}} time creating artificial distinctions between groups that may not actually exist. Data were collected from 90 transgender/transsexual people using confidential, self-administered questionnaires. Factors like age of transition, being out to others, and participant's race and class were associated with experiences of <b>transphobic</b> life events. <b>Discrimination</b> can have profound impact on transgender/transsexual people's lives, but different factors can influence one's experience of transphobia. Further studies are needed to examine how transphobia manifests, and how gender characteristics impact people's lives...|$|R
2500|$|Roz Ward, an {{academic}} at the university's Australian Research Centre in Sex, Health and Society (ARCSHS), co-founded a Safe Schools program for Victoria. The program aims to reduce homophobic and <b>transphobic</b> bullying and <b>discrimination</b> in schools. Research work undertaken by ARCSHS into same-sex attracted and gender diverse youth has helped underpin the program. This program has created controversy. At a national symposium, Ward said, [...] "When people do complain then school leadership can very calmly and graciously say, 'You know what? We’re doing it anyway, tough luck'! [...] [...] [...]'(It’s) not about celebrating diversity; not about stopping bullying, (It’s) about gender and sexual diversity". The Australian Christian Lobby (ACL) {{and others have}} criticised the program as [...] "radical sexual experimentation" [...] which [...] "exposed students to extreme material" [...] and asked for the withdrawal of $8 million allocated to the Australia-wide program. ACL says the program instructs students how to use facilities that match gender identities, how to have anal sex and how girls can bind their chests to change gender.|$|R
40|$|Gender {{non-conforming}} {{and sexual}} minority youth are overrepresented in the homeless youth population and are frequently discriminated against in shelters and youth serving organizations. This paper provides a contextual {{understanding of the}} ways that institutional and governmental policies and standards often perpetuate the social exclusion of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and 2 -Spirit (LGBTQ 2 S) youth, by further oppression and marginalization. Factors, including institutional erasure, homophobic and <b>transphobic</b> violence, and <b>discrimination</b> that is rarely dealt with, addressed, or even noticed by shelter workers, make it especially difficult for LGBTQ 2 S youth experiencing homelessness to access support services, resulting in a situation where they feel safer on the streets than in shelters and housing programs. This paper draws on data from a qualitative Critical Action Research study that investigated the experiences of a group of LGBTQ 2 S homeless youth and the perspectives of staff in shelters through one-on-one interviews in Toronto, Canada. One of the main recommendations of the study included the need for governmental policy to address LGBTQ 2 S youth homelessness. A case study is shared to illustrate how the Government of Alberta has put this recommendation into practice by prioritizing LGBTQ 2 S youth homelessness in their provincial plan to end youth homelessness. The case study draws on informal and formal data, including group activities, questions, and surveys that were collected during a symposium on LGBTQ 2 S youth homelessness. This paper provides an overview of a current political, social justice, and public health concern, and contributes knowledge to an under researched field of study by highlighting concrete ways to prevent, reduce, and end LGBTQ 2 S youth homelessness.

40|$|Despite {{the recent}} {{attention}} to the LGBT community {{in the mainstream media}} as well as psychological research, few resources have been channeled toward the “T” in this acronym. The trans community, and gender diversity in general, have been an afterthought in research claiming to study gender and sexuality. Research on sexual minorities has been assumed to capture the experiences of this population, despite its quite distinct needs and experiences, as well as alarmingly high rates of violence and suicide. This project is a qualitative analysis of the processes and strategies trans and gender non-conforming individuals use to communicate their identity to others, and how they address barriers they face in their everyday lives. Participation was open to all trans or gender non-conforming individuals. Five individuals who identified as trans or genderqueer volunteered to participate in individual semi-structured interviews about their experiences in communicating their gender identity to others. All participants were White university students at a local mid-sized university in a rural Midwestern setting. Interviews were analyzed using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA), using the process outlined by Smith and Osborn (2008). Six themes in total were pulled from the data: (1) Gender identity, (2) Barriers to communication, (3) Strategic responses, (4) Individual impacts, (5) Community politics, and (6) Coping. These results emphasized the complexity and irreducibility of trans individuals’ daily lives, demonstrating simultaneously the tremendous harm of <b>transphobic</b> <b>discrimination</b> and the strength and insight of these individuals into their own experiences. Findings supported the use of the Minority Stress Model (Meyer, 1995) in the trans population and further underscored the need for continued research on all trans individuals’ experiences, especially those who identify as non-binary, trans people of color, and trans women...|$|E
40|$|This thesis explores {{transsexual}} men’s and transsexual women’s {{experiences of}} UK workplaces. It investigates {{the mediation of}} visible/invisible gender-diversity/atypical gender-history, {{and the ways in}} which this influences trans-employees’ experiences of discrimination, protection, support, and inclusion/exclusion. Gender is discussed in terms of individual/interpersonal everyday experiences, and as macro societal institution/organizational regime dependent on the repetition of societally recognizable gendered signifiers and ‘expected’ practices. The study then goes on to examine business approaches to trans-employment equality, and responses to transfocussed/inclusive equality legislation. Poststructuralist and queer theory perspectives provided the theoretical framework for this research in order to interrogate and illuminate the research findings. The research focuses primarily on the self-reported experiences of individuals who identify as the sex-category opposite to the one ascribed at birth, regardless of their transition or employment status at the time of participation. This inclusion criteria was chosen because these individuals are the only gender-diverse sub-group to legally be afforded protection and potential gender-recognition. 106 trans-participants were recruited via a combination of snowball and convenience sampling to maximise the diversity of the sample. Quantitative and qualitative data was then collected via an anonymous asynchronous websurvey, which allowed participants to remain entirely anonymous, and participate at a time safe and convenient for them. Semi-structured interviews were also conducted with eight business representatives selected from lists of organizations reported to have a strong focus on equality and diversity. Businesses were contacted by email and telephone, and informants interviewed face-to-face or via telephone. All of the interviewees were de-identified from their responses to prevent legal and personal repercussions, and to avoid deterring participation. Notions of (in) visibility, visibility, and invisibility, are employed as conceptual tools through which to explore the extent to which one’s gender-diversity, including history, is visible or invisible to the present or absent onlooker (see also Rundall and Vecchietti 2010). (In) visible gender-diversity greatly impacts upon trans-employees’ workplace experiences, and the extent to which their ‘transness’ is perceived to be ‘palatable’ by cisgender onlookers, subsequently influencing the degree to which the trans-individual is othered. ‘Visibly’/‘knowably’ gender-diverse individuals face a significant threat of <b>transphobic</b> <b>discrimination</b> and ostracism, although some do successfully gain acceptance of their gender-identities, and receive support and inclusion. Significant variation was found between the experiences of trans men and trans women, and participants employed in different sectors. Legislation was shown to have impacted upon organizational approaches to trans-equality, particularly in relation to policy-provision. And yet, trans-equality continues to be viewed and constructed as subordinate to other more ‘dominant’/societally ‘valid’ equality-strands, and so is frequently denied investment. Thus, many businesses lack the knowledge and mechanisms needed to implement legislation and policies into day-to-day practices, which perpetuates trans as sous rature (under erasure). Through its focus, this thesis makes a contribution to both theoretical and practical knowledge surrounding: the doings/undoings of gender; identity constructions and related interpersonal and intertextual interactions; and the impact of medical, legal, and other dominant societal frameworks; in the UK employment sphere.
