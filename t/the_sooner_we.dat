Before his departure from Johannesburg, Biti said that he had already learned that he would be arrested, but maintained that his only crime was [...] "fighting for democracy". Furthermore, he said that it was necessary for him to return to participate in the MDC's struggle, despite describing it as [...] "a stupid decision" [...] for him to do so. Biti also said on this occasion that talks on a national unity government had collapsed because the MDC insisted on having Tsvangirai as President and excluding Mugabe from the arrangement, while ZANU-PF insisted on Mugabe remaining President. He also expressed disappointment with regional efforts to resolve the situation and doubted that the UN would be able to resolve it, saying that Zimbabweans were [...] "on their own – and <b>the</b> <b>sooner</b> <b>we</b> realise it, the better".|$|E
2500|$|The 1st Marine Division, {{then under}} the command of Major General James Mattis, was one of the two major U.S. land forces that participated in the 2003 {{invasion}} of Iraq as the land component of the 1st Marine Expeditionary Force. In December 2002, MajGen Mattis was quoted as saying, [...] "The President, the National Command Authority and the American people need speed. <b>The</b> <b>sooner</b> <b>we</b> get it over with the better. Our overriding principle will be speed, speed, speed." [...] Initially, the division fought through the Rumaila oil fields, feinted an attack towards Basrah then moved north on Iraq Highway 1 to An Nasariyah – a moderate-sized, Shi'ite dominated city with important strategic significance as a major road junction and proximity to nearby Talil Airfield. The division then fought its way to Baghdad and pushed further to secure Tikrit by forming Task Force Tripoli after the fall of Baghdad. The division covered 808 kilometers in 17 days of sustained combat, the deepest penetrating ground operation in Marine Corps history. After the invasion the division settled in to conduct security and stabilization operations in Baghdad, Tikrit, and then in south-central Iraq from May to October 2003. For actions during the war as part of I MEF the division was awarded its 9th Presidential Unit Citation.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{concentrates}} on monitoring projects through the PERT and MILESTONES. Complex, multilayered and distributed projects require {{a series of}} activities, some of which must be preferred sequentially and others parallely. This collection of series and parallel tasks can be modeled as a network. PERT is statistical technique applied to such a networks. In this paper we attempted to simulate the PERT networks and graphically represented the tasks along with their inter dependencies. Here project identifies the critical and non-critical tasks and evaluates the critical path to determine which tasks {{have an impact on}} the schedule.    Once a project has advanced to the phase of performance, the focus shifts from the discovery to tracking and reviewing it. MILESTONES are used to track the progress of the project at different stages and the PERT chart, on continual basis. This paper integrated both these techniques for an efficient and easier monitoring. In order to reap the results of <b>the</b> project <b>sooner,</b> <b>we</b> gave a provision to reduce the scheduled completion time with minimum cost burden. This can be achieved by assigning more labor and resources to the various activities.  </p...|$|R

40|$|Pop-up threats usually appear or {{disappear}} randomly in {{a battle}} field. If the next pop-up threat locations could be predicted it would assist a search or attack team, such as in a persistent area denial (PAD) mission, in getting a team of unmanned air vehicles (UAVs) to <b>the</b> threats <b>sooner.</b> <b>We</b> present a Markov model for predicting pop-up ground threats in military operations. We first introduce a general Markov chain of order n to capture the dependence of the appearance of pop-up threats at previous locations of the pop-up threats over time. We then present an adaptive approach to estimate the stationary transition probabilities of the nth order Markov models. To choose {{the order of the}} Markov chain model for a specific application, we suggest using hypothesis tests from statistical inference on historical data of pop-up threat locations. Anticipating intelligent responses from an adversary, which might change its pop-up threat deployment strategy upon observing UAV movements, we present adaptive Markov chain models using a moving horizon approach to estimate possibly abrupt changes in transition probabilities. We combine predicted and actual pop-up target locations to develop efficient cooperative strategies for networked UAVs. A theoretical analysis and simulation results are presented to evaluate the Markov model used for predicting pop-up threats. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of cooperative strategies using the combined information of threats and predicted threats in improving overall mission performance.

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{holographic}} thermalization {{in the framework}} of Einstein gravity coupled to Born-Infeld nonlinear electrodynamics is investigated. We use equal time two-point correlation functions and expectation values of Wilson loop operators in the boundary quantum field theory as probes of thermalization, which have dual gravity descriptions in terms of geodesic lengths and minimal area surfaces in the bulk spacetime. The full range of values of the chemical potential per temperature ratio on the boundary is explored. The numerical results show that the effect of the charge on the thermalization time is similar to the one obtained with Maxwell electrodynamics, namely the larger the charge the later thermalization occurs. The inverse Born-Infeld parameter, on the other hand, has the opposite effect: the more nonlinear the theory is, <b>the</b> <b>sooner</b> it thermalizes. <b>We</b> also study the thermalization velocity and how the parameters affect the phase transition point separating the thermalization process into an accelerating phase and a decelerating phase.
