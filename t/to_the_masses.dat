5|$|A {{unique and}} native form of poetic {{literature}} in Kannada called Vachanas developed during this time. They {{were written by}} mystics, who expressed their devotion to God in simple poems that could appeal <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>masses.</b> Basavanna, Akka Mahadevi, Allama Prabhu, Channabasavanna and Siddharama are the best known among them.|$|E
5|$|Catholic {{efforts to}} win the {{population}} countered the Protestant idea of a national church with Polonization, or nationalization of the Catholic Church in the Commonwealth, introducing a variety of native elements {{to make it more}} accessible and attractive <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>masses.</b> The Church hierarchy went along with the notion. The changes that took place during the 17th century defined the character of Polish Catholicism for centuries to come.|$|E
5|$|Godwin is {{generally}} regarded as {{the founder of the}} school of thought known as 'philosophical anarchism'. He argued in Political Justice (1793) that government has an inherently malevolent influence on society, and that it perpetuates dependency and ignorance. He thought that the spread of the use of reason <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>masses</b> would eventually cause government to wither away as an unnecessary force. Although he did not accord the state with moral legitimacy, he was against the use of revolutionary tactics for removing the government from power. Rather, he advocated for its replacement through a process of peaceful evolution.|$|E

5|$|Population {{declined}} {{in the first half}} of the 14th century, starting with the Great Famine in 1315, followed by the Black Death of 1348–50. Despite the decline, however, German artists, engineers, and scientists developed a wide array of techniques similar to those used by the Italian artists and designers of the time who flourished in such merchant city-states as Venice, Florence and Genoa. Artistic and cultural centres throughout the German states produced such artists as the Augsburg painters Hans Holbein and his son, and Albrecht Dürer. Johannes Gutenberg introduced moveable-type printing to Europe, a development that laid the basis for the spread of learning <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>masses.</b>|$|E

Furthermore, Nicholls noted that this book would come to fill a need for the students who would be taking the Institute of Certificated Grocer exams.|$|E
5|$|Beyonce has crafted her brand around {{embracing}} femininity {{and female}} sexuality. Although as Dr. Cheryl Thompson explains {{in her article}} “The sweet taste of lemonade: Beyonce serves up black feminist history most recent album,” Beyonce is only recently exploring the intersecting themes of feminism and black empowerment in her work. According to Thompson, Beyonce - like many other black female artists - has held back with her identity as a black woman {{for the sake of}} appealing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>masses.</b> Like the SNL skit that pokes fun at white Beyonce fans that listened to “Lemonade” and realized {{for the first time that}} Beyonce is indeed a black woman, it is only very recently that the artist has transformed her feminist image into something more specific to the issues black women face. As Thompson explains, all of Beyonce’s previous albums were about feminism. “Lemonade” is about black feminism. The importance of having artistry like “Lemonade” in the mainstream is critical to examining the lived experiences of black women, and the racial and gender-based oppression that intersect to create a unique set of obstacles.|$|E

The world's first restaurants sprang up and food like dumplings and noodles became available <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>masses</b> for a small price. Urban shopkeepers of the merchant middle class often had little time to eat at home, so they ventured out to eat {{at a variety of}} establishments such as temples, taverns, tea houses, food stalls, and restaurants which provided business for nearby brothels, singing-girl houses, and drama theaters; this along with traveling foreigners and Chinese who migrated to urban centers from regions with different cooking styles encouraged a demand for a variety of flavors served at urban restaurants, giving rise to the menu.|$|E
