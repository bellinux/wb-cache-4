25|$|The High Street is {{the main}} focus of {{activity}} at night having a high concentration of the town's bars, clubs and restaurants. The primary shopping area is the Harlequin Shopping Centre, a large purpose-built indoor mall with over 140 shops, restaurants and cafes built during the 1990s, opened officially in June 1992. The owners of the shopping centre, Capital Shopping Centres, rebranded all <b>their</b> <b>shopping</b> centres, resulting in The Harlequin changing name to intu Watford Shopping Centre from May 2013.|$|E

25|$|Port Alberni {{also serves}} as a hub for those {{travelling}} to the West Coast of Vancouver Island, including Ucluelet, Tofino and Pacific Rim National Park. As commodities tend to be much pricier in these remote areas, campers and travellers often do <b>their</b> <b>shopping</b> in Port Alberni before continuing their journey. This has resulted in development along the Johnston Road (Highway 4) corridor, including several big box retailers, grocery stores and strip mall developments. Previously, eco-tourism companies have set up shop in the Alberni Valley, taking advantage of the city's location on the fringe of wilderness yet proximate location to Vancouver and Victoria. For example, there's a kayaking, ATV touring, a windsurfing and a glider company.|$|E
25|$|In 2005, the {{business}} introduced a 'Mystery Shopper' programme to score its branches {{on the service}} they provide. The mystery shopper grades the branch on its presentation and on the service the branch provides at its service counters, checkouts, wine department and shop floor. In more recent times however, the unpopular mystery shopper programme is being phased out in favour of a customer feedback system called 'Measuring the Magic'. Customers are given a card which directs them to the Waitrose Experience website. In return for grading various areas of <b>their</b> <b>shopping</b> experience, customers are entered into a monthly £500 prize draw. The new system hopes to give feedback tailored to each instance of customer-partner contact, instead of being based on strict criteria.|$|E
25|$|Waitrose {{offers a}} {{self-service}} system known as 'Quick Check'. Customers must register {{as a member}} of myWaitrose, and then insert their myWaitrose card. They are then automatically issued with a hand-held PDA with built-in barcode scanner, allowing them to scan and pack items as they are taken from the shelf. Loose items from the fresh produce and bakery departments can be weighed at self-service scales, producing a barcode label which can then be scanned. The customer then pays for <b>their</b> <b>shopping</b> at a dedicated self-service checkout by scanning a terminating barcode and recalling the transaction by swiping their registered card. A Partner is summoned when necessary in order to authorise the customer's age for age-restricted items and to help scan any problematic items. The customer can then pay as they would normally.|$|E

25|$|Under Republican President Warren G. Harding, {{who called}} for normalcy {{and an end}} to high wartime taxes, Secretary of the Treasury Andrew Mellon raised the tariff, cut other taxes, and used the large surplus to reduce the federal debt by about a third from 1920 to 1930. Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover worked to {{introduce}} efficiency, by regulating business practices. This period of prosperity, along with the culture of the time, was known as the Roaring Twenties. The rapid growth of the automobile industry stimulated industries such as oil, glass, and road-building. Tourism soared and consumers with cars had a much wider radius for <b>their</b> <b>shopping.</b> Small cities prospered, and large cities had their best decade ever, with a boom in construction of offices, factories and homes. The new electric power industry transformed both business and everyday life. Telephones and electricity spread to the countryside, but farmers never recovered from the wartime bubble in land prices. Millions migrated to nearby cities. However, in October 1929, the Stock market crashed and banks began to fail in the Wall Street Crash of 1929.|$|E

In the episode, Phoebe (Lisa Kudrow) agrees to be the {{surrogate}} mother for her brother Frank Jr. (Giovanni Ribisi) and his older wife Alice Knight (Debra Jo Rupp). Meanwhile, a display by Chandler (Matthew Perry) and Joey (Matt LeBlanc) of how well they know Monica (Courteney Cox) and Rachel (Jennifer Aniston) by guessing the items in <b>their</b> <b>shopping</b> bag leads to a large-scale bet on a quiz, for which Ross (David Schwimmer) acts as the gamemaster.|$|E
500|$|In the 1920s, {{the spread}} of the {{automobile}} and the improvement of roads in the United States made it easier for rural residents to do <b>their</b> <b>shopping</b> in larger towns farther from their homes. [...] This gave merchants an incentive to advertise in newspapers that reached such residents. [...] However, delivering the papers in a timely fashion became a problem for the publishers. [...] The U.S. Mail was expensive, since postage rates for newspapers had been raised drastically by the War Revenue Act of 1917; it also took several days for the papers to reach some customers. [...] In more developed parts of the country, publishers delivered papers by truck to local carriers in outlying towns. [...] However, the improvement of roads in the McCook area was slower than in more densely populated areas. [...] By 1929, U.S. Highway 38 (now U.S. Highway 6) had not yet been fully gravelled in southwestern Nebraska, and most roads off the main highways were impassable in bad weather.|$|E

500|$|The New York Times {{reviewer}} Jeannette Catsoulis praised it {{for avoiding}} the dichotomy of [...] "corporate greed versus environmental well-being", adding {{that instead of}} being an exposé, [...] "Under the gentle, humane investigations of its director, what emerges most strongly is a portrait of exploitation that ought to make us more nauseated than elated over those $20 jeans". Tamsin Blanchard, for the Daily Telegraph, called it a work that will [...] "do for the fast fashion business what Food Inc did for fast food". The Hollywood Reporters Frank Scheck commended it for approaching an issue often [...] "untouched by major news organizations". He said the film was [...] "more despair-inducing than instructive", but was optimistic about its possible impact on the fashion culture, citing the effect that films such as Super Size Me and Fast Food Nation had on the fast food industry. Carson Quiros of Paste also compared it to the former film. David Noh of Film Journal International called it a [...] "vitally important documentary" [...] that contains scenes that [...] "are {{enough to make you}} never want to go shopping again". Gabrielle Wilson of MTV stated it is [...] "hard to swallow but never feels preach-y or like a barrage of depressive factoids" [...] and will empower viewers to change <b>their</b> <b>shopping</b> habits. Casey Jarman said she was disappointed by [...] "the only solution offered: eliminating global capitalism"; however, ultimately, she wrote for Willamette Week that it is a [...] "compelling film, which is, above all else, a badly needed conversation-starter".|$|E

In the 19th century, ladies shopping downtown returned home for lunch; having lunch at a downtown restaurant unescorted by a gentleman was not considered ladylike. But after a Marshall Field's clerk shared her lunch (a chicken pot pie) with a tired shopper, Field's hit on the idea of opening a department store tea room, so that women shoppers would not feel the need to make two trips to complete <b>their</b> <b>shopping.</b> To this day, the Walnut Room serves the traditional Mrs. Herring's chicken pot pie.|$|E
