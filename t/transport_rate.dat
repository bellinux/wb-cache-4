40|$|The main {{goals of}} this study are to obtain more insight and {{quantitative}} data of the selective transport process under sheet flow conditions. Experiments were carried out in the Large Oscillating Water Tunnel of WL DELFT HYDRAUUCS for five different hydraulic conditions. The sand that was used consisted of a mixture of 50 % fine (0. 13 mm) and 50 % coarse (0. 32 mm) sand. The total <b>transport</b> <b>rates</b> are calculated with a mass balance equation. The <b>transport</b> <b>rates</b> of each fraction are calculated with a mass balance equation for each fraction, with use of a layer model. Comparison between these data and data from former experiments shows that the fine fraction is hindered by the coarse fraction for larger velocities. In case of sinusoidal waves with a current the coarse fraction is more easily transported than in case of uniform sand. For second order Stokes waves, the coarse fraction is not influenced by the fine fraction. Verification of three existing sediment transport models (Bailard, 1981; Ribberink, 1994; Dibajnia & Watanabe, 1992) shows that the model of Bailard gives good result for coarse fractions, the total and fine fraction <b>transport</b> <b>rates</b> are overestimated with a factor 1. 5. However, the trend of the datapoints is rather well. The model of Ribberink is able to predict most <b>transport</b> <b>rates</b> well. For this sand mixture, correction factors can be applied. The correction factor of Day is the correction factor with the highest influence on the <b>transport</b> <b>rates.</b> For most conditions the <b>transport</b> <b>rates</b> are predicted in the best way with the correction factor of Day. The model of Dibajnia & Watanabe overpredicts most of the <b>transport</b> <b>rates,</b> however it is less than a factor 2.

In order to take gradation effects of sediment {{that was supposed to be}} uniform into account, the size fraction method is used for the three models. Each fraction is split up in 4 fractions.

40|$|Computing Symbolic Dynamics and Chaotic <b>Transport</b> <b>Rates</b> from Invariant ManifoldsbySulimon SattariDoctorate in PhysicsAjay Gopinathan, ChairUniversity of California, Merced 2017 AbstractThe escape rate of asteroids, {{chemical}} reaction rates, and fluid mixing rates are all examplesof chaotic <b>transport</b> <b>rates</b> in dynamical systems. A Monte Carlo simulation {{can be used}} to computesuch rates, for example using a model consisting of a system of ODEs or PDEs. The set oftrajectories in a chaotic system can be highly complex, and a Monte Carlo simulation often requiresivmillions or billions of trajectories to properly sample the state space and compute accurate transportrates. We study methods of computing <b>transport</b> <b>rates</b> using a smaller number trajectories bystudying the structure of the state space or phase space. One way to analyze chaotic phase spaces isto compute symbolic dynamics, which is the labeling of trajectories based on a partitioning of thespace. The symbolic dynamics of the system can be represented as a network consisting of a set ofpartition elements, the nodes, and the allowed transitions between them, the edges. In a Hamiltoniansystem, for example, a partition element represents a region of phase space, and edges connect pairsof nodes between which transport is allowed in time. A firm grasp of the symbolic dynamics resultsin the ability to compute important <b>transport</b> <b>rates,</b> including the topological entropy and the escaperate. One way to compute symbolic dynamics is using invariant manifolds which can divide thestate space into pieces. The collection of stable and unstable invariant manifolds is known as aheteroclinic tangle, and the topology of the intersections of stable and unstable manifolds in thetangle encodes information about restrictions on the dynamics. The question we address is How cansymbolic dynamics computed from invariant manifolds reduce the number of trajectories requiredto compute <b>transport</b> <b>rates?</b> In addition, we ask and try to address what useful information doesthe topology of invariant manifolds tell us about a system that is not apparent from direct or MonteCarlo computation of <b>transport</b> <b>rates?</b> An essential tool in computing the <b>transport</b> <b>rates</b> will be thecomputation of periodic orbits and using a function called the spectral determinant. We study several examples of understanding phase space and computing chaotic transport ratesusing a technique called Homotopic Lobe Dynamics (HLD), which is an automated technique tocompute accurate partitions and symbolic dynamics for maps by using the topological forcingby intersections of stable and unstable manifolds of a few anchor periodic orbits. We haveapplied the HLD technique to analyze and compute <b>transport</b> <b>rates</b> in three systems. In atwo-dimensional, double-gyre-like cavity flow that models a microfluidic mixer, we accuratelycompute the topological entropy over a range of parameter value. In the Hénon map, we use periodicorbits computed from HLD to compute multiexponential decay rates from different zones. In thehydrogen atom in parallel electric and magnetic fields, we use periodic orbits computed from HLDto compute the ionization rate over a range of electron energy where the system exhibits a ternaryhorseshoe. In each system, computations of <b>transport</b> <b>rates</b> over ranges of parameter value usingHLD provided considerable improvements upon previous attempts to compute the same rates...|$|R
