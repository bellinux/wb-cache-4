The Waffen-SS was thus successfully integrated into {{the myth of the}} clean Wehrmacht.|$|E
5|$|Sissoi Veliky {{remained}} in the Far East for another year; in December 1901 an accumulation of mechanical troubles <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> fixed in Far Eastern docks compelled the fleet commander to send {{her back to the}} Baltic. She returned to Libau via Nagasaki, Hong Kong and Suez in April 1902.|$|E
5|$|A {{large number}} of {{soldiers}} {{who died in the}} war were never found, and similarly bodies were recovered <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> identified; once again, this required new forms of memorial. The scale of the issue was once again huge: 73,000 Allied dead were never found at the Somme, for example, either because their bodies had been lost, destroyed or were unrecognisable, more than one in ten of the losses in the battle.|$|E

5|$|A {{memorial}} at St Magnus' Cathedral {{in nearby}} Kirkwall displays a plaque dedicated {{to those who}} lost their lives, beneath which a book of remembrance lists their names. This list of names was not released by the Government until 40 years after the sinking. Each week a page {{of the book is}} turned. The ship's bell was recovered in the 1970s and, after being restored, was added to the memorial in St Magnus'. A number of bodies, including some <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> identified, were interred at the naval cemetery in Lyness.|$|E
5|$|A print from Sheila's right {{ring finger}} {{was found on the}} right side of the butt, {{pointing}} downwards. A print from Bamber's right forefinger was on the rear end of the barrel, above the stock and pointing across the gun. He said he had used the gun to shoot rabbits. There were three other prints <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> identified.|$|E
5|$|Despite being a French-language publication, the gazette {{was seen}} as {{independent}} of France. Its production was tolerated and even encouraged by the authorities, who often used Gazette de Leyde and other similar publications for their own ends, when wishing to publicize information <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> released via the official channels. The paper also gave voice to institutions like the Parliament of France that were finding it difficult to publish in the official French newspaper, the Gazette de France.|$|E

In 2014, the osteoarchaeologist Dr Jo Appleby, of Leicester University's School of Archaeology and Ancient History, imaged {{the spinal}} column and reconstructed a model using 3D printing, {{and concluded that}} though the spinal scoliosis looked dramatic, it probably did not cause any major physical deformity <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> disguised by clothing.|$|E
5|$|In 1991, Lauda Air Flight 004, {{operated}} by a Boeing 767, crashed after the left engine thrust reverser deployed in-flight for reasons <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> determined. The crash of a TAM Airlines Fokker 100 in 1996 was attributed to the deployment of the thrust reverser on No. 2 engine. The aircraft rolled {{to the right and}} crashed in a populated area of São Paulo, Brazil.|$|E
5|$|In addition, if civil {{proceedings}} are taken against the Government, section 27 of the Government Proceedings Act bars the High Court from granting injunctions against it. In place of an injunction, the Court {{may make a}} declaration concerning the parties' rights. The Court also may not make an injunction against a government officer if the effect of doing so would be to provide relief <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> obtained against the Government directly. Section 2(2) of the Act {{makes it clear that}} the term {{civil proceedings}} includes proceedings for judicial review.|$|E

5|$|Losses for 12 July are {{difficult}} to establish for either combatant. Tank losses attributed to the German side vary, {{in part due to}} the Wehrmacht's methodology for counting and reporting equipment losses. Only equipment <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> repaired or that had to be abandoned were counted as losses, but damaged equipment that could be recovered and repaired were simply listed as such. Likewise, reliable figures for tank and personnel casualties for the Red Army in the Battle of Prokhorovka {{are difficult}} to establish.|$|E
5|$|Motohiro {{wanted to}} return to making anime after a long hiatus but he needed a charismatic script writer. Motohiro and his staff were {{surprised}} with Gen Urobuchi's contribution to the highly acclaimed anime series, Puella Magi Madoka Magica. Motohiro was fascinated by Madoka Magica; he read other works from Urobuchi, which persuaded him to talk to Urobuchi. In early 2011, Motohiro proposed to Urobuchi that the pair should work together. Early {{in the making of}} the series, Motohiro told Naoyoshi Shiotani not to make anything <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> adapted into a live-action film.|$|E
5|$|Other theses in the historiography {{stress the}} {{significance}} of the battle. As a result of the battle of Belasitsa, the Bulgarian army suffered heavy casualties <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> restored. The ability of the central government to control the peripheral and interior provinces of the Empire was reduced and the actions of the local and provincial governors became more decisive for the outcome of the war with Byzantium. Many of them voluntarily surrendered to Basil II.|$|E

5|$|The Victorian and Tasmanian subpopulations of the crossback stingaree differ {{markedly}} in habitat {{preferences and}} merit further taxonomic investigation, {{according to the}} International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). This ray {{is closely related to}} the yellowback stingaree (U.sufflavus). In addition to morphological similarities, the two may also hybridize (see below) and, in a 2007 study of 388 fishes by Robert Ward and Bronwyn Holmes, were the only species <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> distinguished {{on the basis of their}} cytochrome c gene sequences, attesting to a close evolutionary relationship.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of the germanium transistor in 1948 {{opened the door to}} countless applications of solid state electronics. From 1950 through the early 1970s, this area provided an increasing market for germanium, but then high-purity silicon began replacing germanium in transistors, diodes, and rectifiers. For example, the company that became Fairchild Semiconductor was founded in 1957 with the express purpose of producing silicon transistors. Silicon has superior electrical properties, but it requires much greater purity <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> commercially achieved {{in the early years of}} semiconductor electronics.|$|E

At about 2:15 AM a rescue team was sent to the spot and found the three missing firefighters unconscious and out of air in their SCBAs. The firefighters were brought to a medical triage set up on the 20th floor. There were attempts at resuscitation, but they were unsuccessful and the firefighters were pronounced dead.|$|E
5|$|A {{group of}} ZIPRA guerrillas, {{armed with a}} Strela-2 launcher, waited in the bush beneath Flight 825's flightpath, and fired on the Hunyani about five minutes after it took off, while the {{aircraft}} {{was still in the}} climb phase of its flight. The heat-seeking missile hit the plane's starboard wing and exploded, causing the inner engine to also explode. A fuel tank and hydraulic lines ruptured, creating a fire <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> put out. The second starboard engine failed almost immediately, leaving Hood with only his two port engines. Heaving wildly, the Hunyani began to descend rapidly.|$|E
