5|$|A wake low, or wake depression, is a {{mesoscale}} low-pressure {{area which}} trails the mesoscale high following a squall line. Due to the subsiding warm air {{associated with the}} systems formation, clearing skies are associated with <b>the</b> <b>wake</b> low. Once difficult to detect in surface weather observations due to their broad spacing, the formation of mesoscale weather station networks, or mesonets, has increased their detection. Severe weather, {{in the form of}} high winds, can be generated by <b>the</b> <b>wake</b> low when the pressure difference between the mesohigh preceding it and <b>the</b> <b>wake</b> low is intense enough. When the squall line {{is in the process of}} decay, heat bursts can be generated near <b>the</b> <b>wake</b> low. Once new thunderstorm activity along the squall line concludes, <b>the</b> <b>wake</b> low associated with it weakens in tandem.|$|E

5|$|Wake lows form due to {{adiabatic}} warming in <b>the</b> <b>wake</b> of mature squall {{lines at the}} back edge of their rain shields, where evaporative cooling is unable to offset warming due to atmospheric subsidence, or downward motion. They {{can be caused by}} gravity waves which duct through boundary layers which are deep and cold to the north of a weather front. As with mesoscale high-pressure areas behind a squall line, when new thunderstorm development stops along the squall line, <b>the</b> <b>wake</b> low will weaken as well. Clearing conditions will accompany <b>the</b> <b>wake</b> low, due to the descending warm air mass associated with the feature. Within the United States, these systems have been observed to form in the Mississippi river valley, Southeast, Florida, and Great Plains.|$|E

40|$|A vortex {{model of}} a {{helicopter}} rotor is presented. Each blade of the rotor has three degrees of freedom: flapping, lagging and feathering. The motions after each degree of freedom are also known for all blades. The blade is modelled as a thin vortex surface. <b>The</b> <b>wakes</b> are free fluid surfaces. A system of five equations are obtained: {{the first one is}} the integral equation of the lifting surface (rotor), the next three describe <b>the</b> <b>wakes</b> motion, and <b>the</b> last one relates the vortex strength on <b>the</b> <b>wakes</b> and <b>the</b> variation of vorticity on the rotor. A numerical solution of this system is presented. To avoid the singularities that can occur due to the complexity of vortex system, a desingularized model of the vortex core was adopted. A Mathcad worksheet containing the method has been written. The original contribution of the work. The calculation method of the motion of <b>the</b> <b>wakes</b> free vortex system, the development of the vortex cores in time and a new method to approximate the aerodynamic influence of remoted wake regions...|$|R
