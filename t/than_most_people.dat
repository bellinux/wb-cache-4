25|$|Despite Genie's {{increased}} willingness {{and ability}} to engage in conversation she continued to speak far less <b>than</b> <b>most</b> <b>people</b> in equivalent phases of language acquisition, and her conversational competence remained very low. In her dissertation, Curtiss wrote that in many aspects Genie's overall demeanor continued to bear a strong resemblance {{to that of a}} person who had not been socialized. The scientists found Genie's inability to master conversational skills was unsurprising and suggested that the ability to engage in conversation was a separate skill from simply knowing language, consistent with earlier observations of retarded and autistic children. They therefore attributed Genie's difficulty with conversation to her lack of socialization during childhood instead of her language constraints.|$|E
25|$|J.P. {{embraced the}} {{philosophy}} put forth in Jan Yoor’s book, “The Gypsies.” That philosophy of total freedom of actions, of non-ownership of possessions, defined {{his adult life}} and was far more revolutionary <b>than</b> <b>most</b> <b>people</b> could deal with. His incredible generosity (he would give the shirt off his back if he saw the need, and did so frequently), his deep love for his family and friends, the heart-felt music he composed and played as naturally as he breathed, all speak of a man committed to his desire to live life fully and without restraints. J.P. had a rascally sense of humor, though; another story he loved to tell was of the Romany Gypsy family that lived in the flat above the Pickens in San Francisco in early 1963. The father of the family would {{go out at night}} with a crowbar and smash fenders on cars parked along the street, then come along the next morning to offer to do the bodywork repairs. J.P. thought this was hilarious and told the story often with great relish.|$|E

[...] "Even though the financial crisis affected very few, the shock of tulipmania was considerable. A whole network of values was thrown into doubt." [...] In the 17th century, it was unimaginable to most people that something as common as a flower could be worth so much more money <b>than</b> <b>most</b> <b>people</b> earned in a year.

[...] She still retained admirers, though. Anita Perez Ferguson, president of the National Women's Political Caucus, noted that female New York political figures in the past had been reluctant to enter the state's notoriously fierce primary races, and said: [...] "This woman has probably been more of an opinion maker <b>than</b> <b>most</b> <b>people</b> sitting for six terms straight in the House of Representatives or Senate.

He also said he was angry at being unable to live at Ickworth, as the remaining lease had been sold to the National Trust. His half-sister Victoria shared similar sentiments, and stated that she has avoided drugs {{as a result of}} her relationship with John. The 7th Marquess' maternal half-brother, George Lambton, said he had no hard feelings about the disappearance of the money, and that the Marquess had [...] "packed more in his 44 years <b>than</b> <b>most</b> <b>people</b> do in their whole lives".|$|E

He returned from a hunting trip to Fairborn, Ohio, on October 14, 1963, when he found a message from NASA in Houston, Texas. He called them back, and discovered he had been chosen as an astronaut.

Of Ono, McCartney stated: [...] "I {{thought she was a}} cold woman. I think that's wrong..... she's just the opposite..... I think she's just more determined <b>than</b> <b>most</b> <b>people</b> to be herself." [...] Two years later, however, Ono publicly compared Lennon to Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, while McCartney, she said, more closely resembled his less-talented rival Antonio Salieri. This remark infuriated McCartney's wife Linda, who was dying from breast cancer at the time, and when Linda died less than a year later, McCartney did not invite Ono to his wife's memorial service in Manhattan.|$|E

After the season ended, Tipton was part of Lefty O'Doul's American baseball team that toured Japan. To start the 1952 season, Tipton was rumored to be the subject of a trade involving the Boston Red Sox and two of their players, but the deal never materialized. Tipton missed part of May with a kidney infection, and struggled upon returning, hitting [...]191 in 23 games. In late June, he was waived by the Athletics and picked up by the Indians.

500|$|The {{producers}} added Justin's sister Iris as {{a supporting}} {{character in the}} revised series, and established a sexual {{tension between the two}} characters early on. While reviewers were unsure what to make of it, Daniel Knauf advertised the relationship as [...] "just as warped and incestuous as ever" [...] in the new season. Clancy Brown (Brother Justin) and Amy Madigan (Iris) acknowledged the lust between their characters but assumed their relationship had not been consummated in the first season. They were not in favor of their characters getting together like HBO had wanted, as [...] "that's really not what they're about." [...] Per Brown, the sibling relationship informs Brother Justin's and Iris's character and motives, and continued tension frightens the audience more if it is never resolved. Although Brown and Madigan wanted to leave the status of their characters' relationship as lovers open, they deliberately played their kisses more intimate and familiar <b>than</b> <b>most</b> <b>people</b> would consider comfortable. Several characters intervene the siblings' relationship during the show's run. The writers had planned a sexual innuendo between Iris and Tommy Dolan, a news reporter who investigates in the arson case, but Robert Knepper (Dolan) later felt his character might just have been a pawn between Brother Justin and Iris as siblings, making Brother Justin jealous. The Crowes also regularly hire new maids, which Knauf explained as Iris lining up surrogate women to relieve Brother Justin's sexual pressure.|$|E
