40|$|In this paper, a {{multiple}} cameras visual servoing system {{is presented to}} correct the pose of robot end-effector in large scale 3 D positioning in robot manufacturing system. A 3 D CAD laser projector is used to provide four <b>target</b> <b>points</b> on the projection screens for four cameras respectively. Eye-in-hand architecture is used to perform visual servoing and the image based visual servoing (IBVS) is adapted as the control strategy. This paper is focused on detecting the four <b>target</b> <b>points</b> by four cameras respectively. Theoretically, the image Jacobian matrix doesn't hold in this configuration because the <b>target</b> <b>points</b> are floating in base frame along the laser beam during the visual servoing process. But in a step of iteration, the <b>target</b> <b>points</b> on the projection screens can be referred as fixed points which are also called local desired <b>target</b> <b>points.</b> The image features of local desired <b>target</b> <b>points</b> in image planes of cameras are the desired features in this iteration. By observing the four <b>target</b> <b>points</b> on projection screens, the IBVS controller can drive the end-effector of robot to its local desired position in each step of iteration and ultimately to its calibration position. In this configuration, the simple constant depths are adopted for obtaining the image Jacobian matrix during visual servoing.

40|$|In {{dynamical}} {{systems with}} distinct time scales the time evolution in phase space {{may be influenced}} strongly by slow manifolds. Orbits then typically follow the slow manifold, which hence act as a transient attractor, performing in addition rapid transitions between distinct branches of the slow manifold on the time scales of the fast variables. These intermittent transitions correspond to state switching within transient state dynamics. A full characterization of slow manifolds is often difficult, e. g. in neural networks {{with a large number}} of dynamical variables, due to the generically complex shape. We therefore introduce here the concept of locally attracting <b>points,</b> the <b>target</b> <b>points.</b> The set of <b>target</b> <b>points</b> is, by definition, the subsets of the slow manifold guiding the time evolution of a given trajectory. The motion of the <b>target</b> <b>points,</b> also called attractor metadynamics, by definition takes place on the slow manifold guiding the time evolution of a given trajectory. We consider here systems, in which the overall dynamics settles in the limit of long times either in a limit cycle, or in a chaotic attractor. The set of <b>target</b> <b>points</b> then decomposes into one-dimensional (or fractal) branches, which can be analyzed directly. Here we examine the role of <b>target</b> <b>points</b> as transiently stable attractors in an autonomously active recurrent neural network. We quantify their influence on the transient states by measuring the effective distance between trajectories and the corresponding <b>target</b> <b>points</b> in phase space. We also present an example of chaotic dynamics, discussing how the chaotic motion is related to the set of transient attractors. The network considered contains, for certain parameters settings, symmetry protected solutions in the form of travelling waves. Comment: 11 pages, 10 figure...|$|R
40|$|Visual {{fixation}} {{is employed}} by humans and some animals {{to keep a}} specific 3 D location {{at the center of}} the visual gaze. Inspired by this phenomenon in nature, this paper explores the idea to transfer this mechanism to the context of video stabilization for a hand-held video camera. A novel approach is presented that stabilizes a video by fixating on automatically extracted 3 D <b>target</b> <b>points.</b> This approach is different from existing automatic solutions that stabilize the video by smoothing. To determine the 3 D <b>target</b> <b>points,</b> the recorded scene is analyzed with a state-of-the-art structure-from-motion algorithm, which estimates camera motion and reconstructs a 3 D point cloud of the static scene objects. Special algorithms are presented that search either virtual or real 3 D <b>target</b> <b>points,</b> which back-project close to the center of the image for as long a period of time as possible. The stabilization algorithm then transforms the original images of the sequence so that these 3 D <b>target</b> <b>points</b> are kept exactly in the center of the image, which, in case of real 3 D <b>target</b> <b>points,</b> produces a perfectly stable result at the image center. Furthermore, different methods of additional user interaction are investigated. It is shown that the stabilization process can easily be controlled and that it can be combined with state-of-the-art tracking techniques in order to obtain a powerful image stabilization tool. The approach is evaluated on a variety of videos taken with a hand-held camera in natural scenes...|$|R
