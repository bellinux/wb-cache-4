25|$|This {{exercise}} is {{a modified version}} of the Stand for Exam.

25|$|The {{discrete}} Fréchet distance, {{also called}} the coupling distance, is an approximation of the Fréchet metric for polygonal curves, defined by Eiter and Mannila. The discrete Fréchet distance considers only positions of <b>the</b> <b>leash</b> where its endpoints are located at vertices of the two polygonal curves and never {{in the interior of}} an edge. This special structure allows the discrete Fréchet distance to be computed in polynomial time by an easy dynamic programming algorithm.|$|E

25|$|When the two curves are {{embedded}} in a metric space other than Euclidean space, such as a polyhedral terrain or some Euclidean space with obstacles, the distance between two points on the curves is most naturally defined as {{the length of the}} shortest path between them. <b>The</b> <b>leash</b> is required to be a geodesic joining its endpoints. The resulting metric between curves is called the geodesic Fréchet distance. Cook and Wenk describe a polynomial-time algorithm to compute the geodesic Fréchet distance between two polygonal curves in a simple polygon.|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, the Bloodhound bay {{is among}} the most {{impressive}} of hound voices. When hunting in a pack they are expected to be in full cry. They are more likely to 'give tongue,' 'throw their tongue,' or 'speak' when hunting in a pack than when hunting singly, and more when hunting free than when on <b>the</b> <b>leash.</b> The quality of 'speaking to the line', that is giving tongue when on the correct scent while remaining silent when off it, is valued in British Bloodhound circles, on aesthetic grounds and because it makes it very easy to 'read' the hound's tracking behaviour. As a result, special trophies for speaking to the correct line are on offer at British working trials (where hounds hunt singly), although rarely awarded.|$|E
500|$|Based on Jack Warner's 2003 debut novel Shikar, Maneater {{was filmed}} in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. [...] The film uses no CGI special effects at all, with the [...] "killer tiger" [...] portrayed by actual trained tigers. In scenes where the tiger is chasing various characters, the tiger is {{actually}} {{on a leash}} with his trainer behind him. <b>The</b> <b>leash</b> and trainer were edited out of the scenes during post-production.

"Bedtime Story" [...] has {{frequently}} {{been cited as}} one of the songs with the most unfulfilled potential in Madonna's career, nonetheless, the song did enjoy some success, being a club [...] "favorite" [...] in the mid-1990s. It has been described as the record that foreshadowed Madonna's usage of electronic music in her later work, especially Ray of Light (1998), which according to Vicente, owes [...] "its contemplative and electronic techno rave character to 'Bedtime Story'". O'Brien wrote in Madonna: Like an Icon, that the song [...] "foreshadowed [...] move towards electronica" [...] and labelled it an [...] "embryonic moment that went a lot further on the next few albums". De Vries recalled that tackling the song [...] "seemed to set something free in Madonna. She was straining at <b>the</b> <b>leash</b> a little bit, to find some other languages to speak, and 'Bedtime Story' was an embryonic moment that went a lot further on to the next few albums." [...] In a review for the Bedtime Stories album on a whole, Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine wrote that the song was [...] "the germ that would later inspire Madonna to seek out and conquer electronica with the likes of William Orbit and Mirwais".|$|E
500|$|Louisa Mellor of Den of Geek {{believed}} the episode was [...] "well-schooled" [...] in the horror genre, [...] "with plenty of freaking out and jumping at shadows.

[...] Mellor was also appreciative of McGuigan's [...] "stylish hand" [...] as director, particularly highlighting the [...] "mind palace" [...] sequence, as well as Tovey's performance as Henry Knight and for [...] "once again" [...] seeing Watson's role for being [...] "more than just sigh exasperatedly at his flatmate and apologise to others on Sherlock's behalf." [...] In summary, the reviewer stated [...] "I can only echo Sherlock's own closing words to Henry: [...] "This case, thank you, it's been brilliant"." [...] Chris Tilly of IGN rated the episode a [...] "good" [...] 7 out of 10, but stated that although the it was [...] "full of mystery and intrigue," [...] the central story [...] "wasn't strong enough to fill the 90-minute run-time, running out of steam at the mid-way point and padded out with irrelevant and at times exasperating efforts to throw the audience off the scent." [...] Tilly praised Cumberbatch's performance as a mentally broke down Holmes, and Freeman for being [...] "let off <b>the</b> <b>leash</b> this week, with Watson investigating solo on a couple of occasions," [...] and also thought Tovey was a [...] "fine addition to the ensemble." ...|$|E
500|$|Lutyens' [...] {{memorial}} in Ayscoughfee Hall gardens was constructed by Hodson Limited of Nottingham, {{at the south}} end of the formal gardens, replacing an earlier castellated tower—a 19th-century folly known as the [...] "Owl Tower". The unveiling took place at a ceremony on 9 June 1922, presided over by General Sir Ian Hamilton and dedicated by Reverend Alfred Jarvis, Assistant Chaplain-General to Northern Command. Barbara McLaren attended the ceremony along with several other members of the Jekyll and McLaren families. Several dignitaries gave speeches at the ceremony, including Jarvis, who spoke of the dead among the poppies on the Western Front, a [...] "symbol of oblivion". Hamilton spoke of the results of the carnage of the war; referring to the idea that the First World War was the war to end war, he told the assembled: [...] "The result has been so different. Europe is a seething cauldron of racial hatred; Ireland [...] is linked in our minds with the idea of murder; Mesopotamia , India, and Egypt are straining at <b>the</b> <b>leash</b> of civilisation." [...] The general concluded: [...] "If you want to end war, you must end hatred" [...] and that [...] "In that way, I believe we shall be working towards peace, and in that way we will be doing in our own small way our best each of us—and Spalding minds united are a great force—and in that way we shall perpetuate the memories of those whose untimely deaths we have come here to commemorate". At the conclusion of the speeches a lone bugler played the [...] "Last Post" [...] and the crowd sang the national anthem, after which the dignitaries—including McLaren and her sons—laid floral tributes around the Stone of Remembrance.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} <b>the</b> Radio <b>Leashing</b> Problem {{and presents}} a control system {{to solve the}} problem for a single unmanned aircraft. <b>The</b> <b>leashing</b> problem as presented in this paper is to electronically tether an unmanned vehicle to one ore more radio nodes so that it may act as a communication repeater between them in a multi-hop network. The method proposed in this paper solves <b>the</b> <b>leashing</b> problem using only local measurements of network performance and assumes no knowledge of the node locations or on the RF propagation environment. This paper addresses two specific concepts that are not seen in literature: (i) the formulation of a control strategy based only upon received radio statistics, and (ii) utilizing the motion of a single aircraft to gain further information about the local RF environment. In this work, the signal-to-noise ratio for each individual link is the only input into a high-level control system. Due to the orbital motion of the aircraft, a gradient of the signal-to-noise field can be measured, and is used to control the motion of an orbit center point as well as provide a directional estimate of the transmitting node’s location from the aircraft.

50|$|One popular, {{informal}} way {{to summarize}} {{this argument is}} as follows: If, say, Gérard de Nerval were to walk his lobster on a leash around and around a tree, such that <b>the</b> <b>leash's</b> length was always less than Nerval's distance to the tree, then the lobster would wind around the tree exactly {{as many times as}} Nerval.|$|R
2500|$|If we further {{require that}} <b>the</b> <b>leash</b> must move {{continuously}} in the ambient metric space, then we obtain {{the notion of}} the homotopic Fréchet distance between two curves. <b>The</b> <b>leash</b> cannot switch discontinuously from one position to another [...] in particular, <b>the</b> <b>leash</b> cannot jump over obstacles, and can sweep over a mountain on a terrain only if it is long enough. The motion of <b>the</b> <b>leash</b> describes a homotopy between the two curves. Chambers et al. describe a polynomial-time algorithm to compute the homotopic Fréchet distance between polygonal curves in the Euclidean plane with obstacles.|$|E
2500|$|The weak Fréchet {{distance}} is {{a variant of}} the classical Fréchet distance without the requirement that the endpoints move monotonically along their respective curves [...] the dog and its owner are allowed to backtrack to keep <b>the</b> <b>leash</b> between them short. Alt and Godau describe a simpler algorithm to compute the weak Fréchet distance between polygonal curves, based on computing minimax paths in an associated grid graph.|$|E
2500|$|Informally, we {{can think}} of the {{parameter}} [...] as [...] "time". Then, [...] is the position of the dog and [...] is the position of the dog's owner at time [...] (or vice versa). The length of <b>the</b> <b>leash</b> between them at time [...] is the distance between [...] and [...] Taking the infimum over all possible reparametrizations of [...] corresponds to choosing the walk along the given paths where the maximum leash length is minimized. The restriction that [...] and [...] be non-decreasing means that neither the dog nor its owner can backtrack.|$|E

2500|$|There {{are many}} {{accounts}} of bloodhounds successfully following trails many hours, and even several days old, [...] the record being {{of a family}} found dead in Oregon, in 1954, over 330 hours after they had gone missing. The bloodhound is generally used to follow the individual scent of a fugitive or lost person, taking the scent from a ‘scent article’ – something the quarry {{is known to have}} touched, which could be an item of clothing, a car seat, an identified footprint etc. Many bloodhounds will follow the drift of scent a good distance away from the actual footsteps of the quarry, which can enable them to cut corners and reach the end of the trail more quickly. In America, sticking close to the footsteps is called ‘tracking’, while the freer method is known as ‘trailing’ (in the UK, ‘hunting’), and is held to reflect the bloodhound’s concentration on the individual human scent, rather than that of, say, vegetation crushed by the feet of the quarry. Having lost a scent, a good bloodhound will stubbornly cast about for long periods, if necessary, in order to recover it. The bloodhound is handled on a tracking harness, which has a metal ring above the shoulders, to which a leash is attached, so that the hound’s neck is not jerked up when <b>the</b> <b>leash</b> becomes taut, as it would with a collar. <b>The</b> <b>leash</b> is at least long enough to allow the hound to cross freely in front of the handler, some handlers preferring quite a short leash, giving better communication with the hound, others liking something longer, maybe twenty or thirty feet.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are also}} a variety of trails near the lake for hiking and horseback riding. [...] Because Todd Lake is located just outside the Three Sisters Wilderness, {{it is a major}} access point for hikers and campers heading into the wilderness. [...] The trailhead for Todd Trail #34 is located {{at the south end of}} the lake. [...] Todd Trail connects to Soda Creek Trail #11 from Sparks Lake. [...] It then joins Broken Top Trail #10 running along the south side of Broken Top to Green Lakes Trail #17, which leads north to the Green Lakes at the base of the South Sister. [...] During the summer, dogs must be kept on a leash when hiking on trails in the Three Sisters Wilderness, {{including}} all the trails mentioned above. [...] <b>The</b> <b>leash</b> rules also apply to the Todd Lake day-use area, campground, and the trail that follows the shore around the lake.|$|E
