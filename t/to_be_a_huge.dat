5|$|Uematsu joined Square in 1985, and {{composed}} the soundtrack to Cruise Chaser Blassty in 1986, his first. While working at Square, he met Hironobu Sakaguchi, who {{asked him if}} he wanted to create music for some of his games, which Uematsu agreed to. For the next year, he created music for a number of games which did not achieve widespread success, including titles like Genesis and Alpha. In 1987, Uematsu and Sakaguchi collaborated on what was originally to be Sakaguchi's last contribution for Square, Final Fantasy, a game that turned out <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> success.|$|E
5|$|Ashley Michelle Tisdale (born July 2, 1985) is an American actress, singer, and producer. During her childhood, Tisdale was {{featured}} in over one hundred advertisements and had minor roles in television and theatre. She achieved mainstream success as Maddie Fitzpatrick in the Disney Channel series The Suite Life of Zack & Cody. This success was heightened when she starred as Sharpay Evans in the High School Musical franchise. The film series proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> success for Disney and earned a large following. The success of the films led to Tisdale signing with Warner Bros. Records, releasing her debut album, Headstrong (2007), through the label. The album was a commercial success, earning a gold certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). She starred as Candace Flynn in the animated series Phineas & Ferb from 2007 to 2015.|$|E

5|$|In June2013, Iwata {{took the}} {{additional}} role of Nintendo of America's CEO. As {{one of his}} first changes as CEO, Iwata decided that they would not hold large press conferences at E3, and instead have several smaller events, each aimed at a certain demographic. While traveling to Tokyo in late 2013, Iwata sketched an idea for a series of physical toys that could connect with Nintendo's games. This concept soon developed into the Amiibo line of figures which launched less than a year later. Amiibo proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> success, with more than 6million figurine sold by the end of 2014, roughly a month after launch. By March2016, combined sales of figures and cards—a product released in 2015—exceeded 64million units, proving financially beneficial across all Nintendo platforms.|$|E
5|$|The band {{continued}} to release commercially successful albums, including Some Girls (1978) and Tattoo You (1981), which were their most popular albums worldwide. From 1983 to 1987, tensions between Jagger and Richards almost caused the band to split. However, {{they managed to}} patch up their friendship after they separated temporarily to work on solo projects, and experienced a comeback with Steel Wheels (1989), which {{was followed by a}} large stadium and arena tour. Since the 1990s, new recorded material from the group has been less well-received and less frequent. Despite this, the Rolling Stones have continued <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> attraction on the live circuit, with stadium tours in the 1990s and 2000s. By 2007, the band had four of the top five highest-grossing concert tours of all time: Voodoo Lounge Tour (1994–1995), Bridges to Babylon Tour (1997–1998), Licks Tour (2002–2003) and A Bigger Bang Tour (2005–2007).|$|E
5|$|The festival {{turned out}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> success, both {{critically}} and financially. The show {{attracted the attention}} of entertainment executives, including Columbia Pictures, which met with Laliberté and Gauthier under the pretense of wanting to make a movie about Cirque du Soleil. Laliberté was unhappy with the deal, claiming that it gave too many rights to Columbia, which was attempting to secure all rights to the production. Laliberté pulled out of the deal before it could be concluded, and that experience stands out as a key reason why Cirque du Soleil remained independent and privately owned for 28 years, until Guy Laliberte announced in April 2015 that he was selling his majority stake to a group headed by a U.S. private equity firm, and its Chinese partners.|$|E

5|$|To ease her heartbreak and the {{rejection}} from her family, Silk turns to alcohol and chain smoking. She gains weight, {{causing her to}} lose her status as a sex symbol. Silk approaches Silva Ganesh with an offer to produce a film together. Ultimately, the audience and industry has lost interest in her, and the film fails. On the other hand, Abraham directs a film which turns out <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> hit, and he feels that he has finally proven to Silk (and himself) that his films do not need any sexualisation to be successful. Having lost her fame and fortune, Silk has accumulated so much debt that she approaches a small-time filmmaker, willing to take on any role. She is shocked to find that he wants her to do a pornographic film, and she refuses. He intoxicates her with alcohol and starts filming, without her permission. The place is raided by the police but Silk manages to escape.|$|E

In Glasgow, while searching the local {{hospital}} for survivors, Sinclair and her team are ambushed {{by a group of}} marauders. Sgt. Norton and Dr. Stirling manage to escape, while the team suffers heavy casualties. Sinclair and Dr. Talbot are captured by what turns out <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> gang of brutal cannibals. Sinclair is interrogated by the gang's leader, Sol, who plans to use her as leverage to cross the wall, allowing his army to start their invasion on England; it's the only way to change the UK back to its former glory. He then leaves for the sacrificial ceremony to join the rest of the gang, who grill Dr. Talbot and eat him alive. With the help of Cally, another prisoner, Sinclair escapes and kills Viper, Sol's dedicated partner. After meeting with Norton and Stirling, they escape on a train. Cally reveals that she and Sol are Kane's children. Unsatisfied with Kane's rule, Sol left to create his own army.|$|E

40|$|Introduction The genome of <b>a</b> {{species can}} <b>be</b> {{thought of as}} a set of ordered {{sequences}} of genes the ordering devices being the chromosomes, each gene having an orientation given by its location on the DNA double strand. Comparing two sets of similar genes appearing along a chromosome in two species yields two (signed) permutations. It is widely accepted that the reversal distance between these two permutations, de ned as the minimal number of reversals that transform one permutation into the other, provides a good estimate of the evolutionary distance between the two species. Computing the reversal distance <b>is</b> now <b>a</b> well understood computational problem that has linear complexity [1]. However, reconstructing sequences of reversals that realize this distance raises some interesting issues. In recent months, the assessment of the diculty of the problem shifted from <b>an</b> optimal sequence <b>is</b> non trivial.

50|$|Furs <b>were</b> also traded <b>to</b> China and Persia. In exchange, Siberian fur traders {{obtained}} silks {{and other}} luxury goods from those places.

Ling Tong then fought recklessly {{in the battle against}} the bandits after exclaiming that only through death could he cleanse his deep guilt. Thus, his attack turned out <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> success, yet he bound himself and surrendered to the discipline officer after the victorious battle to await his punishment.

In 1935, Howard Anthony purchased the then-bankrupt Heath Company, and focused on selling accessories for small aircraft. After World War II, Anthony decided that entering the electronics industry was a good idea, and bought a large stock of surplus wartime electronic parts {{with the intention of}} building kits with them.
