500|$|In {{his review}} for Salon magazine, Andrew O'Hehir wrote, [...] "What Soderbergh {{has sought to}} capture here is a grand process of birth and extinguishment, one that {{produced}} a complicated legacy in which John McCain, Barack Obama, and Raúl Castro are still enmeshed. There {{will be plenty of}} time to argue about the film's (or films') political relevance or lack thereof, to call Soderbergh names for this or that historical omission, for this or that ideological error. He's made something that people will be eager to see and eager <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>all</b> over the world, something that feels strangely urgent, something messy and unfinished and amazing".|$|E
500|$|Peter Bradshaw, in {{his review}} for The Guardian, wrote, [...] "Perhaps it will even come {{to be seen as}} this director's flawed masterpiece: enthralling but {{structurally}} fractured—the second half is much clearer and more sure-footed than the first—and at times frustratingly reticent, unwilling to attempt any insight into Che's interior world". In his less favorable review for Esquire, Stephen Garrett criticized the film for failing to show Guevara's negative aspects, [...] "the absence of darker, more contradictory revelations of his nature leaves Che bereft of complexity. All that remains is a South American superman: uncomplex, pure of heart, defiantly pious and boring". Richard Corliss had problems with Del Toro's portrayal of Guevara: [...] "Del Toro—whose acting style often starts over the top and soars from there, like a hang-glider leaping from a skyscraper roof—is muted, yielding few emotional revelations, seemingly sedated here ... Che is defined less by his rigorous fighting skills and seductive intellect than by his asthma". In his review for Salon.com, Andrew O'Hehir praised Soderbergh for making [...] "something that people will be eager to see and eager <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>all</b> over the world, something that feels strangely urgent, something messy and unfinished and amazing. I'd be surprised if Che doesn't win the Palme d'Or ... but be that as it may, nobody who saw it here will ever forget it".|$|E
2500|$|As of the Rogers-produced Hockey Night, Coach's Corner was noticeably shortened, from {{as long as}} 10 {{minutes to}} as short as 5—a change that was lampshaded by both Cherry and MacLean during their first segment of the new season. The {{following}} Monday, Scott Moore had a short discussion with Cherry regarding the matter, laughing it off and explaining that [...] "if you have more <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about,</b> <b>all</b> {{you need to do}} is make sure you tell the executive producer what you want to talk about and we'll make sure you have lots of time." ...|$|E

40|$|It is fashionable {{these days}} <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> "productivity", <b>all</b> {{the more so}} since the word {{may be used in}} several meanings. Only some of them are {{accepted}} by economists.

6000|$|Now, {{everybody}} began <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>all</b> {{sorts of}} things, {{so as to}} seem as if they hadn't noticed this little rumpus, and we agreed that we must all {{see each other again}} the next day. Father said he should remain in the city for a few days, now that we were all here, and Uncle Chipperton did not intend to go to his country-place until the weather was warmer.

6000|$|Along in {{the first}} months I knocked around about the Kingdom, making friends {{and looking at the}} country, and finally settled down in a pretty likely region, to have a rest before taking another start. I went on making acquaintances and {{gathering}} up information. I had a good deal of talk with an old bald-headed angel by the name of Sandy McWilliams. He was from somewhere in New Jersey. I went about with him, considerable. We used to lay around, warm afternoons, {{in the shade of a}} rock, on some meadow- ground that was pretty high and out of the marshy slush of his cranberry-farm, and there we used <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>all</b> kinds of things, and smoke pipes. One day, says I-- ...|$|E
60|$|In {{his turn}} old Jolyon {{looked back at}} his son. He {{wanted to talk about}} many things that he had been unable <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>all</b> these years. It had been {{impossible}} to seriously confide in June his conviction that property in the Soho quarter would go up in value; his uneasiness about that tremendous silence of Pippin, the superintendent of the New Colliery Company, of which he had so long been chairman; his disgust at the steady fall in American Golgothas, or even to discuss how, by some sort of settlement, he could best avoid the payment of those death duties which would follow his decease. Under the influence, however, of a cup of tea, which he seemed to stir indefinitely, he began to speak at last. A new vista of life was thus opened up, a promised land of talk, where he could find a harbour against the waves of anticipation and regret; where he could soothe his soul with the opium of devising how to round off his property and make eternal the only part of him that was to remain alive.|$|E
60|$|There, we are {{rumbling}} away home at last, {{over the}} dear old heather-moors. How {{far we have}} travelled--in our fancy at least--since we began <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>all</b> these things, upon the foggy November day, and first saw Madam How digging at the sand-banks with her water-spade. How many countries we have talked of; and what wonderful questions we have got answered, which all {{grew out of the}} first question, How were the heather-moors made? And yet we have not talked about a hundredth part of the things about which these very heather-moors ought to set us thinking. But so it is, child. Those who wish honestly to learn the laws of Madam How, which we call Nature, by looking honestly at what she does, which we call Fact, have only to begin by looking at the very smallest thing, pin's head or pebble, at their feet, and it may lead them--whither, they cannot tell. To answer any one question, you find you must answer another; and to answer that you must answer a third, and then a fourth; and so on for ever and ever.|$|E
6000|$|And he {{answered}} them and said, 'I will <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you <b>about</b> <b>all</b> {{other things that}} are in heaven and on earth, but about God I will not <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you. Neither now, nor at any time, will I <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> you <b>about</b> God.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{can offer}} but little, in these retired mountains, to {{interest}} a traveller {{and a man}} of the world, Captain Ducie," [...] said Mr. Effingham, when he went to pay his compliments more particularly, after the whole party was in the house; [...] "but there is a common interest in our past adventures <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about,</b> after <b>all</b> other topics fail. When, we met on the ocean, and you deprived us so unexpectedly of our friend Powis, we did not know that you had the better claim of affinity to his company." ...|$|R
6000|$|Boyne's {{face had}} {{mirrored}} the indignation in his sister's, {{but at this}} unprecedented burst of conventionality he forgot their momentary alliance. [...] "Well, you're a pretty one <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> chaperons! Walking <b>all</b> over Tuskingum with fellows at night, and going buggy-riding with everybody, and out rowing, and here fairly begging Jim Plumpton {{to come down to}} the steamer and see you off again!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I suppose I {{ought to}} feel very miserable," [...] {{he said to}} himself. [...] "I can't make out why I don't. Here am I shut up with about a hundred as villainous-looking fellows as one could want to see--something like half of them murderers, all desperate criminals. I ought to be down in the dumps. It seems unnatural that I shouldn't be. I suppose I {{have a sort of}} Mark Tapley disposition, and get jolly under difficulties. Of course I should feel it more if I hadn't made up my mind to escape somehow. The colonel seems a good sort of fellow, and even the prisoners speak well of him. Then it is a comfort to hear that all that talk about the {{quicksilver}} mines was a lie, and the work is going to be no worse than a gold-digger would have in California or a navvy at home. There is no great hardship about that, at any rate for a time. If it was not for the thought of how horribly anxious they must be at home about me, I should not mind. It will be something <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>all</b> one's life. The first thing for me to do is to learn from the others as much as possible about the country. I have learned a lot about the geography of Siberia from Alexis, and have got a good idea about all the rivers. I dare say I shall learn a good deal more from some of these men. Another thing is to pick up as much of their language as I can from these Tartar fellows. They seem to be scattered pretty well all over the country. At least I have seen some of them all the way I have gone. I know there are other tribes. Those fishing chaps they call Ostjaks are the ones I should have most to do with. I expect one could get on with them if one happened to get them in the right vein. I suppose they speak some sort of dialect like that of these Tartars. At any rate I should think it would be sure to be near enough for the natives to understand each other. I believe Russian helps with all these languages, for the Russians are themselves only civilized Tartars. At any rate {{one of the first things}} to be done is to learn to speak the language, and I should be able to learn a lot about the country from them too. I have got eight or nine months before one can think of making a start, for of course it must be done in the spring. It is the end of September now, though I have lost all account of the days of the month." ...|$|E
