5|$|A cold front's {{location}} is at <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> {{edge of the}} temperature drop-off, which in an isotherm analysis shows up as <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> edge of the isotherm gradient, and it normally lies within a sharp surface trough. Cold fronts can move up to {{twice as fast as}} warm fronts and produce sharper changes in weather, since cold air is denser than warm air and rapidly lifts the warm air as the cold air moves in. Cold fronts are typically accompanied by a narrow band of showers and thunderstorms. On a weather map, the surface position of the cold front is marked with the symbol of a blue line of triangles/spikes (pips) pointing in the direction of travel, at <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> edge of the cooler air mass.|$|E
