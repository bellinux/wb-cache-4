5|$|In 1977, the Department of National Heritage {{bought the}} castle from its owners. The {{government}} agency English Heritage {{took control of}} the castle in 1984 and a scheme to reopen the property <b>to</b> <b>visitors</b> was put forward in 1993. This included a final assessment of the archaeological work of the previous decades, and the castle finally opened to the public again in 1994. As of 2015, the castle is open <b>to</b> <b>visitors</b> through guided tours organised by the Rye Harbour Nature Reserve. The site is protected under UK law as a Grade I listed building.|$|E

50|$|Having {{traced the}} cases <b>to</b> <b>visitor</b> stays {{earlier in the}} summer in what were called Signature Tent Cabins, erected to replace {{structures}} lost to the rockfall, the National Park Service closed all 91 new cabins. These are double-walled, with insulation between the walls. The park continued <b>to</b> allow <b>visitors</b> at its 300 single-wall tent cabins. The outbreak was thought due <b>to</b> <b>visitor</b> inhalation of aerolized droppings of deer mice, which nested in the tent insulation between the walls.|$|R

5|$|By 1909, {{the bulk}} of the castle was {{considered}} obsolete and the War Office transferred it to the Office of Works, who carried out restoration work and opened it <b>to</b> <b>visitors.</b> It reentered service during the First World War, equipped with two quick-firing guns to protect the harbour, but they did not see service during the conflict. After the war, the castle was restored and leased to the town, who again opened it <b>to</b> <b>visitors.</b> Between 1940 and 1943, during the Second World War, it was rearmed with two 4.7-inch (11.9 cm) quick-firing guns, dating from the First World War and housed in concrete gun houses, to protect merchant convoys and the Philips' shipyard. The castle was manned by members of the British Army; officers lived in a nearby cottage, non-commissioned officers in the castle itself, and other ranks in the 19th century fortifications, and later in temporary Nissen huts.|$|E

40|$|Testing for {{the random}} walk hypothesis, which asserts that a series is a non-stationary process or a unit root process, {{in the case}} of visitor arrivals has {{important}} implications for policy. If, for instance, visitor arrivals are characterized by a unit root, then it implies that shocks <b>to</b> <b>visitor</b> arrivals are permanent. However, if visitor arrivals are without a unit root, this implies that shocks <b>to</b> <b>visitor</b> arrivals are temporary. This study provides evidence on the random walk hypothesis for <b>visitor</b> arrivals <b>to</b> India using the recently developed Im et al. (2003) and Maddala and Wu (1999) panel unit root tests. Both tests allow one to reject the random walk hypothesis, implying that shocks <b>to</b> <b>visitor</b> arrivals <b>to</b> India from the 10 major source markets have a temporary effect on visitor arrivals. ...|$|R
