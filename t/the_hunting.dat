5|$|For others, {{although}} <b>the</b> <b>hunting</b> {{of animal}} with hounds was made illegal by <b>the</b> <b>Hunting</b> Act 2004, the Exmoor hunts still meet in full regalia {{and there is}} a campaign to resurrect this rural sport. Nine hunts cover the area– the Devon and Somerset Staghounds and the Quantock Staghounds, the Exmoor, Dulverton West, Dulverton Farmers and West Somerset Foxhounds, the Minehead Harriers, the West Somerset Beagles and the North Devon Beagles. During the spring, amateur steeplechase meetings (point-to-points) are run by hunts at temporary courses such as Bratton Down and Holnicote. These, along with thoroughbred racing and pony racing, are an opportunity for farmers, hunt staff and the public to witness a day of traditional country entertainment.|$|E

5|$|John Jackson, Patrick Martin and Harriet Hughes, {{all members}} of the Countryside Alliance, sought {{judicial}} review of the use of the Parliament Acts to pass <b>the</b> <b>Hunting</b> Act. They claimed that the 1949 Act had not been lawfully passed either because the 1911 Act could not be used to amend itself or because it provided a method of making delegated or subordinate legislation which could not alter the process of legislating. Consequently, they claimed, the 1949 Act had not reduced the delay specified in the 1911 Act and <b>the</b> <b>Hunting</b> Act, which was passed only in accordance with the requirements as amended by the 1949 Act, was invalid.|$|E

5000|$|<b>The</b> Royal Calpe <b>Hunt</b> of <b>the</b> British Crown Colony of Gibraltar {{originated}} in 1812 as <b>the</b> Civil <b>Hunt.</b> <b>The</b> fox <b>hunt</b> was initially a civilian endeavour that began when {{a pair of}} English foxhounds were imported to Gibraltar. <b>The</b> <b>hunts</b> took place across the border, in the Campo de Gibraltar area of Spain. However, in 1814, the membership of <b>the</b> <b>Hunt</b> underwent a substantial change. Many officers of the Gibraltar garrison joined <b>the</b> <b>Hunt,</b> which shifted from a civilian to a military enterprise. That year, the name was changed to <b>the</b> Civil Calpe <b>Hunt.</b> It retained that title until 1817, after which it was known as <b>the</b> Calpe <b>Hunt.</b> <b>The</b> first Master of <b>the</b> <b>Hunt</b> was Charles Elphinstone Fleeming. However, the Master most associated with <b>the</b> <b>Hunt</b> was Pablo Larios, Marquis of Marzales, who held that title for forty-five years. His election to that position in 1891 was not only historic, but strategic. His appointment represented {{only the second time}} that the position had not been filled {{by a member of the}} military. In addition, his Spanish heritage and influence in the Campo de Gibraltar, where he owned extensive estates, garnered him the loyalty of the local Spanish farmers, and therefore eased the ever-present tensions between the military and the farmers over the crop damage that was inherent to <b>the</b> <b>Hunt.</b> In 1906, King Edward VII of the United Kingdom and King Alfonso XIII of Spain became joint Patrons of <b>the</b> <b>Hunt,</b> after which it was known as <b>the</b> Royal Calpe <b>Hunt.</b> <b>The</b> tradition of <b>the</b> <b>Hunt</b> continued for more than a century, until 1939, and the onset of the Second World War ...|$|R

50|$|The {{competition}} {{is divided into}} two-day cycles, each day featuring one four-hour <b>hunt.</b> At <b>the</b> start of each cycle, one team is randomly selected as <b>the</b> <b>Hunt</b> team, and <b>the</b> remaining teams are Prey. Over the course of these two days, <b>the</b> <b>Hunt</b> team stays at the Lodge, a special part of the camp with better shelter and improved provisions. They are also allowed to invite one other team to join them for <b>the</b> night between <b>hunts.</b> <b>The</b> <b>Hunt</b> team is challenged to capture two teams during <b>the</b> two <b>hunts.</b> They are {{given the opportunity to}} capture one team during <b>the</b> first <b>hunt,</b> and if they fail to do so, they can attempt to make two captures during <b>the</b> second <b>hunt.</b> <b>The</b> Prey teams are given a few minutes head start {{at the beginning of each}} <b>hunt</b> before <b>the</b> <b>Hunt</b> team follows them. A team is captured by <b>the</b> <b>Hunt</b> team by attaching their activated Talons (small metal, magnetic disks) onto the vest of either member of a Prey team. The Talon is only active for a few minutes after which <b>the</b> <b>Hunt</b> team must wait for some time before they can attempt capture again. <b>The</b> <b>Hunt</b> team is given no special information about the locations of the other teams, however if a Prey team remains still for more than three minutes, <b>the</b> <b>Hunt</b> team is shown the location of this team on their armband display. <b>The</b> <b>hunt</b> is concluded once a team is captured or time runs out.

5|$|During the 20th century, {{sea otter}} numbers rebounded in {{about two-thirds of}} their {{historic}} range, a recovery {{considered one of the}} greatest successes in marine conservation. However, the IUCN still lists the sea otter as an endangered species, and describes the significant threats to sea otters as oil pollution, predation by orcas, poaching, and conflicts with fisheries– sea otters can drown if entangled in fishing gear. <b>The</b> <b>hunting</b> of sea otters is no longer legal except for limited harvests by indigenous peoples in the United States. Poaching was a serious concern in the Russian Far East immediately {{after the collapse of the}} Soviet Union in 1991; however, it has declined significantly with stricter law enforcement and better economic conditions.|$|E
