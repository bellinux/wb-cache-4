25|$|The {{secret of}} the apostolic zeal of a disciple of Christ is rooted in his love for the Master. This is what moves him to give his life for the others, to spend it in helping them know the divine Word and to live {{according}} to <b>the</b> <b>imperatives</b> <b>of</b> the Love of God. His zeal for souls is born from a love for Christ, which like all true love, implies identification with the person loved.|$|E
25|$|A {{historian}} by training, {{he wrote}} A Just Measure of Pain, {{a history of}} prisons during the Industrial Revolution. His biography of Isaiah Berlin reveals the strong impression the celebrated philosopher made on Ignatieff. Philosophical writings by Ignatieff include The Needs of Strangers and The Rights Revolution. The latter work explores social welfare and community, and shows Berlin's influence on Ignatieff. These tie closely to Ignatieff's political writings on national self-determination and <b>the</b> <b>imperatives</b> <b>of</b> democratic self-government. Ignatieff has also written extensively on international affairs. His historical memoir, The Russian Album, traces his family's life in Russia and their troubles and subsequent emigration {{as a result of}} the Bolshevik Revolution.|$|E
25|$|In 1969, Dominic Behan {{wrote an}} episode of the UK {{television}} series Play for today entitled 'Michael Collins'. The play dealt with Collins' attempt to take the gun out of Irish politics and took {{the perspective of the}} Republican argument. At the time of writing the script, the troubles had just begun in Northern Ireland and the BBC were reluctant to broadcast the production. An appeal by the author to David Attenborough (Director of Programming for the BBC at that time) resulted in the play eventually being broadcast; Attenborough took the view that <b>the</b> <b>imperatives</b> <b>of</b> free speech could not be compromised in the cause of political expediency.|$|E

25|$|By {{locating}} {{the conditions of}} rationality in the social structure of language use, Habermas moves the locus of rationality from the autonomous subject to subjects in interaction. Rationality is a property not of individuals per se, but rather of structures of undistorted communication. In this notion Habermas has overcome the ambiguous plight of the subject in critical theory. If capitalistic technological society weakens the autonomy and rationality of the subject, it is not through the domination of the individual by the apparatus but through technological rationality supplanting a describable rationality of communication. And, in his sketch of communicative ethics as the highest stage in the internal logic {{of the evolution of}} ethical systems, Habermas hints at the source of a new political practice that incorporates <b>the</b> <b>imperatives</b> <b>of</b> evolutionary rationality.|$|E

At the same time, he attempted to reconcile <b>the</b> <b>imperatives</b> <b>of</b> democracy with the necessity for a strong and coherent government. In practice, however, M'ba showed a weakness in attaining his goal—by {{this time he was}} known as [...] "the old man", or [...] "the boss"—to have a high degree of authority. On 21 February 1961, a new constitution was unanimously adopted, providing for a [...] "hyperpresidential" [...] regime. M'ba now had full executive powers: he could appoint ministers whose functions and responsibilities were decided by him; he could dissolve the National Assembly by choice or prolong its term beyond the normal five years; he could declare a state of emergency when he believed the need arose, though for this amendment he would have to consult the people via a referendum. This was, in fact, very similar to the constitution adopted in favor of Fulbert Youlou at roughly the same time. A report from the French secret service summarized the situation: ...|$|E

A cult of personality developed steadily around M'ba; songs were sung in his praise and stamps and loincloths were printed with his effigy.

2500|$|Istoria R.P.R. earned {{its author}} the Romanian State Prize for 1949, while Agitprop {{presented}} it {{as a huge}} success. Its claims (instantly sold-out editions, millions of copies in circulation) were in fact irrelevant, as there was no actual competition in the field. The only history textbook allowed in schools, it {{has been described by}} Șerban Papacostea as [...] "the vastest work of political mystification of Romania's past", making Roller [...] "a symbol of the effort to adapt the Romanian past to <b>the</b> <b>imperatives</b> <b>of</b> the Soviet occupation and the 'internationalist' regime" [...] imposed on the country. Boia also notes that, especially after adopting an acronym in its title, Istoria... overturned the logic of previous historiographic discourse, from the [...] "national idea" [...] to [...] "the internationalist spirit". Stoian additionally suggests that Istoria... is a failure from a literary point of view. It is written in [...] "wooden tongue" [...] and its phrases have [...] "the taste of sud".|$|E
2500|$|Nor was {{the brotherhood}} among Zetes limited to mere words; the moving tale of Brother Henry Schwerin (Θ '63) {{illustrates}} {{the embodiment of}} love {{even in the most}} trying of circumstance. Schwerin lay gravely wounded after the bloody Battle of Chattanooga; pinned on the breast of his Union uniform was the badge of Zeta Psi. A passing Confederate soldier, also a Zete, spied the badge and carried the invalid to medical care and safety, ignoring even <b>the</b> <b>imperatives</b> <b>of</b> war {{for the sake of his}} brother. The worthy badge later passed into the hands of his brother, Max Schwerin (Θ '70), who would one day serve as international president. After his death, it was donated by his sister to the Fraternity's archives and remains among its treasures. Brother John Day Smith (Ε '72) witnessed the incident on the Chattanooga field, and later related it to Brother Francis Lawton (Ε '69), who would author the poem [...] "The Badge of Zeta Psi," [...] later set to original music and preserved to this day. The reference to [...] "Chattanooga's bloody field" [...] is not idle hyperbole, but the recollection of a rare triumph among such sorrows.|$|E
2500|$|Authorities within state-endorsed {{religions}} were {{suspicious of}} pietist doctrine which they {{often viewed as}} a social danger, as it [...] "seemed either to generate an excess of evangelical fervor and so disturb the public tranquility or to promote a mysticism so nebulous as to obscure <b>the</b> <b>imperatives</b> <b>of</b> morality. A movement which cultivated religious feeling almost as an end itself". While some pietists (such as Pastor Francis Magny) held that [...] "mysticism and the moral law went together", for others (like his pupil Françoise-Louise de la Tour) [...] "pietist mysticism did less to reinforce the moral law than to take its place...the principle of 'guidance by inner light' was often a signal to follow the most intense of her inner sentiments...the supremacy of feeling over reason". Religious authorities could bring pressure on pietists, such as when they brought some of Magny's followers before the local consistory {{to answer questions about}} their unorthodox views or when they banished Pastor Magny from Vevey for heterodoxy in 1713. Likewise, pietism challenged the orthodoxy via new media and formats: Periodical journals gained importance versus the former pasquills and single thesis, traditional disputation was replaced by competitive debating, which tried to gain new knowledge instead of defending orthodox scholarship.|$|E

6000|$|... "His 'Notes on Novelists.' It's one {{sustained}} {{demand for}} the picture effect. Which is the denial of the sweet complexity of life, of the pointing this way and that, of the spider on the throne. Philosophy aims at a unity and never gets there.... That true unity which we all suspect, and which no one attains, {{if it is to}} be got at all it is to be got by penetrating, penetrating down and through. The picture, on the other hand, is forced to a unity because it can see only one aspect at a time. I am doubtful even about that. Think of Hogarth or Carpaccio. But if the novel is to follow life it must be various and discursive. Life is diversity and entertainment, not completeness and satisfaction. All actions are half-hearted, shot delightfully with wandering thoughts--about something else. All true stories are a felt of irrelevances. But James sets out to make his novels with the presupposition that they can be made continuously relevant. And perceiving the discordant things, he tries to get rid of them. He sets himself to pick the straws out of the hair of Life before he paints her. But without the straws she is no longer the mad woman we love. He talks of 'selection,' and of making all of a novel definitely about a theme. He objects to a 'saturation' that isn't oriented. And he objects, if you go into it, for no clear reason at all. Following up his conception of selection, see what in his own practice he omits. In practice James's selection becomes just omission and nothing more. He omits everything that demands digressive treatment or collateral statement. For example, he omits opinions. In all his novels you will find no people with defined political opinions, no people with religious opinions, none with clear partisanships or with lusts or whims, none definitely up to any specific impersonal thing. There are no poor people dominated by <b>the</b> <b>imperatives</b> <b>of</b> Saturday night and Monday morning, no dreaming types--and don't we all more or less live dreaming? And none are ever decently forgetful. All that much of humanity he clears out before he begins his story. It's like cleaning rabbits for the table.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} Mande {{data that}} suggest a grammaticalization path leading from <b>the</b> <b>imperative</b> <b>of</b> ‘see/look’ verbs to ostensive predicators (i. e. words functionally similar to French voici, Italian ecco, or Russian vot), and further to copulas.

Comparison of the Mande data with the Arabic data provided by Taine-Cheikh (2013) shows however {{that this is not the}} only possibility for <b>imperatives</b> <b>of</b> ‘see/look’ verbs to grammaticalize into copulas, since in the Arabic varieties in which <b>the</b> <b>imperative</b> form <b>of</b> ‘see’ has become a plain copula, the most plausible explanation is that a modal/discursive particle resulting from <b>the</b> grammaticalization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>imperative</b> <b>of</b> ‘see’ has undergone a process of semantic bleaching in the context of an equative or locational predicative construction that initially included no overt predicator...|$|R
