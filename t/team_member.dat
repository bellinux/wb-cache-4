Matthews scored his 18th and final goal for Blackpool in a 4–1 league victory over Tottenham Hotspur at Bloomfield Road on 3 September 1956. Blackpool finished seventh in 1957–58, after which Joe Smith left the club.|$|E

40|$|We argue that, when status {{differences}} between lower- and higher-status <b>team</b> <b>members</b> are well established, intergroup relations {{are driven by}} status competition among higher-status <b>team</b> <b>members</b> and collaboration among lower-status <b>team</b> <b>members.</b> Supporting these arguments, we found that higher-status <b>team</b> <b>members</b> facing higher levels of professional dissimilarity (i. e., working with higher proportions of lower-status <b>team</b> <b>members)</b> reported fewer instances in which colleagues accused them of incompetence or breached norms of professional conduct; the latter resulted in lower levels of negative emotions and negative behaviors. Lower-status <b>team</b> <b>members</b> {{reported higher levels of}} these outcomes when working with higher proportions of higher-status <b>team</b> <b>members...</b>|$|R
30|$|Density of the {{sub-group}} network measures {{how long}} <b>team</b> <b>members</b> were on average in sub-groups. As the sub-group network captures the {{spatial distribution of}} <b>team</b> <b>members,</b> a high density indicates that many <b>team</b> <b>members</b> were together for a long time, whereas a low density indicates that <b>team</b> <b>members</b> were mostly on their own.|$|R
5|$|The Aristotle project, a multi-year {{initiative}} by Google Inc. {{aimed at}} defining {{the characteristics of}} an ideal team in the workplace, has found somewhat similar conditions for group effectiveness. They found that by far, most important factor is psychological safety. The other key factors in productivity are dependability, structure and clarity, personal meaning, and each <b>team</b> <b>member</b> feeling like they have an impact.|$|E
5|$|Another <b>team</b> <b>member</b> was Ed McCully, a man Jim Elliot had met and befriended {{while both}} {{attended}} Wheaton College. Following graduation, he married Marilou Hobolth and {{enrolled in a}} one-year basic medical treatment program at the School of Missionary Medicine in Los Angeles. On December 10, 1952, McCully moved to Quito with his family as a Plymouth Brethren missionary, planning to soon join Elliot and Fleming in Shandia. In 1953, however, the station in Shandia was wiped out by a flood, delaying their move until September of that year.|$|E

40|$|This {{longitudinal}} study aimed to explain performance differences of knowledge intensive project teams. Team level data gathered at three measurement moments were used. Antecedents of performance studied were: trust in <b>team</b> <b>members,</b> trust in supervisors, monitoring by <b>team</b> <b>members</b> and monitoring by supervisors. Heedful interrelating, a concept developed by Weick and Roberts (1993) {{was expected to}} mediate between trust in <b>team</b> <b>members,</b> monitoring by <b>team</b> <b>members</b> and <b>team</b> performance. Correlation analysis and structural equation modelling were employed to analyse the data. The results show that heedful interrelating of <b>team</b> <b>members,</b> built {{on a combination of}} trust and monitoring by <b>team</b> <b>members</b> and trust in supervisors {{is an important factor in}} promoting team performance...|$|R

5|$|For {{the next}} Bungie title, 1993's Pathways Into Darkness, Seropian hired a third <b>team</b> <b>member</b> for {{graphics}} work.

By 1994 Bungie had grown to a staff of six and had moved into a rundown Chicago office—a converted former religious school located {{in front of a}} crack house. Their next title, Marathon, began development as a sequel to Pathways but grew larger. On release it won several awards and established Bungie as the top Mac game developer.|$|E
5|$|In 1975, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation {{returned}} {{all eight}} broadcast prints of Galaxy 4 and The Underwater Menace to the BBC to be disposed of.

5|$|In this bonus round, {{each member}} of the winning team plays the same {{question}} individually. While the first contestant is asked the question, the second is isolated offstage so that they cannot see or hear the question. The two teammates have a total of 40 seconds to answer (in seasons 1 and 2, the time limit was 30 seconds); the clock stops when the first contestant submits an answer, and resumes when the second contestant first sees the question. If one <b>team</b> <b>member</b> answers the question correctly, they receive an additional $1,000; if both answer correctly, their winnings are augmented to $10,000.|$|E

5|$|The course {{consisted}} of eight obstacles {{which had to}} be completed within 60 seconds. Each obstacle had an orange flag either at its end or hidden within it.

5|$|Through the Etherians, Voyager learns of {{an energy}} field being {{projected}} by a gigantic space station, the Forge, which is draining power and preventing repairs from being completed. To counteract {{the effects of}} the field, chief engineer B'Elanna Torres suggests the use of a rare substance called Isodesium, and the Hazard Team is sent on a stealth mission to the scavenger base to steal their supplies of Isodesium. However, the mission is a disaster: despite acquiring the Isodesium, one crewman is briefly captured and another <b>team</b> <b>member</b> is critically injured. As the team attempts to extract, Borg drones transport into the extraction point, killing another <b>team</b> <b>member,</b> capturing Lieutenant Foster and taking the Isodesium. In Foster's absence, Munro is made the team leader. Along with Seven of Nine, the team transports to the Borg cube to retrieve the Isodesium. While on the cube, Munro is given the chance to rescue Foster from assimilation by the Borg. Matters are complicated when the Borg corner the team, leveraging their freedom and the Isodesium for assistance against a number of Species 8472 on board, a race highly resistant to the Borg. Although successful, the Borg attempt to assimilate the team; anticipating a double cross, however, Munro has Chang detonate an explosive in a sensitive part of the cube and the team escapes with the Isodesium in the chaos.|$|E
