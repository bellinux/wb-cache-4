5|$|In 2014, O'Donnell and Timken began {{talks with}} the Coast Guard Museum Association about selling <b>the</b> <b>station</b> <b>to</b> a {{third-party}} investor associated with the Association. The sale was originally to be effective {{at the end of}} 2014, but was delayed because the Redevelopment Agency never issued a formal certificate of completion for the 1975 sale and renovations. Since the Agency was dissolved in 2008, the City Council issued the certificate in early January 2015, allowing the sale the proceed. On January 12, the Council released the station from the 1960s urban renewal plan as part of an agreement with O'Donnell and Timken to ease the sale process. The new agreement also included stipulations for historic preservation of the building, and allowed – but not required – its continued use as a train station. On January 29, 2015, Union Station Development sold <b>the</b> <b>station</b> <b>to</b> the New London RR Company – a holding company owned by James Coleman Jr., chairman of the Association – for $3 million.
