They can also use the penalty to kick for territory or tap the ball and continue running it. Three points are awarded if a team member drop kicks a goal during general play.|$|E
25|$|The {{best thing}} {{was simply the}} {{privilege}} {{and the challenge of}} being able to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> <b>at</b> the first female captain, transcending stereotypes that I was very familiar with. I was able to do that in front of millions of viewers. That was a remarkable experience—and it continues to resonate. The downside of that is also that it continues to resonate, and threatens to eclipse all else in one's long career if one does not up the ante and stay at it, in a way that may not ordinarily be necessary. I have to work at changing and constantly reinventing myself in a way that probably would not have happened had Star Trek not come along. I knew that going in, and I think that all of the perks attached to this journey have been really inexpressively great. So the negatives are small.|$|E
25|$|At the 2002 Winter Olympics, {{having been}} {{selected}} by Gretzky to captain the roster, Lemieux led the Canadian men's team into Salt Lake City, United States. The team {{had failed to}} win a {{gold medal at the}} Olympics in fifty years but were still considered favourites to win. Lemieux was second to Joe Sakic in team scoring with six points in five games, and led the team to gold by defeating the United States 5-2 in the final game. Lemieux showcased his amazing hockey intelligence during the gold medal game against the United States. With Team Canada trailing 1-0 in the first period, Lemieux made {{one of the most famous}} and savvy plays in Olympic hockey history. After a cross-ice pass from Lemieux in the neutral zone, Canadian defenceman Chris Pronger carried the puck across the blue line into the American zone, and fired a pass across the zone. Lemieux then faked like he was receiving the pass and proceeded to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> <b>at</b> the net, all while letting the puck slide through his legs, knowing he had forward Paul Kariya streaking behind him. Lemieux's fake caused American goalie Mike Richter to lunge in Lemieux's direction, and thus created a wide open net for Kariya to fire the puck in, as he received the pass from Pronger after Lemieux let it go to Kariya. During the tournament, his hip injury required several painkilling injections to keep him on the ice, and he only played one more NHL game after the Olympics before being lost for the season.|$|E

However, mere hours later Andy feels that he is only sticking with his Dundler-Mifflin job because it is safe and that he has to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> <b>at</b> achieving fame. Fearing his conviction will falter a second time, he decides he cannot simply quit, but get fired. This proves difficult as he is unable to make himself go through with any offense more serious than defecating on David's car. Andy bids farewell to his coworkers with an unexpectedly moving rendition of [...] "I Will Remember You", prompting them to comment to the documentary crew that he may have star potential after all.|$|E
500|$|In 2009, Johnson began {{indicating}} {{interest in}} {{running for president}} in the 2012 election. In the April 20, 2009 edition of The American Conservative magazine, Bill Kauffman told readers to [...] "keep an eye out" [...] for a Johnson presidential campaign in 2012, reporting that Johnson {{had told him that}} [...] "he was keeping his options open for 2012" [...] and that [...] "he may <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> <b>at</b> the Republican presidential nomination in 2012 as an antiwar, anti-Fed, pro-personal liberties, slash-government-spending candidate—in other words, a Ron Paul libertarian". [...] During a June 24, 2009 appearance on Fox News's Freedom Watch, host Judge Andrew Napolitano asked Johnson if he would run for president in 2012, to which Johnson responded that {{he thought it would be}} inappropriate to openly express his desires before President Obama is given the opportunity to prove himself, but he followed up that statement by saying [...] "it appears personal freedoms are being shoveled out the window more and more." ...|$|E
500|$|Hot Fuzz {{received}} critical acclaim. The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes {{reported a}} 91% approval rating {{with an average}} rating of 7.7/10 based on 199 reviews. The website's consensus reads, [...] "The brilliant minds behind Shaun of the Dead successfully <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> <b>at</b> the buddy cop genre with Hot Fuzz. The result is a bitingly satiric and hugely entertaining parody." [...] It also has a Metacritic score of 81/100. Olly Richards of Empire praised the chemistry between Pegg and Frost, saying: [...] "After almost a decade together, they're clearly so comfortable in each other's presence that they feel no need {{to fight for the}} punchline, making them terrific company for two hours". Johnny Vaughan of The Sun already called it the [...] "most arresting Brit-com of 2007". Phillip French of The Observer, who did not care for Shaun of the Dead, warmed to the comedy team in this film. The film also received positive reviews in the United States. Derek Elley of Variety praised Broadbent and Dalton as [...] "especially good as Angel's hail-fellow-well-met superior and oily No. 1 suspect". As an homage to the genre, the film was well received by screenwriter Shane Black. On Spill.com, it got their 2nd-highest rating of 'Full Price!!'.|$|E

Nothingface drummer Tommy Sickles originally helmed the drum kit for the band's demo, however, things did not work out {{and the search for}} a new drummer began. The band knew former Pantera and Damageplan drummer Vinnie Paul, and tried to persuade him to join the band as their drummer. Originally, Paul was not sure if he would return to music {{after the death of his}} brother, Dimebag Darrell and an 18-month hiatus: [...] "It was one of those things that I didn't think I'd be apart of this ever again without him, and after about a year and a half had gone by, these guys called me up, Chad [...] and Tom , they were like, 'We're thinking about putting this band together, would you be into it?'

500|$|... "Life's a Glitch, Then You Die" [...] {{was written}} and {{conceived}} by Hauge. In DVD commentary for the episode, Hauge stated that, when writing the segment, {{he knew it}} would not age well. [...] "I was aware of it at the time, that it wouldn't last forever" [...] he said, [...] "But I wanted to capture that moment." [...] According to director Michels, the rocket which transported the [...] "best and brightest" [...] of the population was drawn to resemble a popsicle. The Simpsons staff had a lot of trouble finding a guest star for the second rocket, and the only person who agreed to participate was American actor Tom Arnold. In the episode, Arnold is depicted as an annoying, [...] "not-so-great" [...] celebrity. Although he was mostly in on the joke, Arnold did [...] "bust [...] chops" [...] a little bit when recording his lines. [...] "He would say a line and then they'd yell cut and he'd look over at me and <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> <b>at</b> me" [...] Hauge said. Still, Hauge found Arnold's performance [...] "fantastic" [...] and Scully said that he was a [...] "good sport". The segment also features television personality Dick Clark as himself. A few months after the episode aired, Hauge discussed the segment with Clark in a Fox studio. According to Hauge, Clark said that the episode gave the [...] "biggest response" [...] he had ever gotten from anything he had ever done. [...] "After the career that he had in television for so long, just to give him a highlight was a highlight for me" [...] Hauge said in the episode's DVD commentary.|$|E

Of course, <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> <b>at</b> rewriting the lyric, but whatever you do, don't lose the hitness of it. If the rewrite doesn't work, {{we can use the}} song on a future Whitney project, maybe her greatest hits album." [...] Rich and Friedman ultimately rewrote the entire lyric except for the title. They then redemoed the song and sent the new version to Davis. Davis, Jackson and everyone involved loved the new version of [...] "Run to You", so the song was finally set for the movie.|$|E
2500|$|If a team {{is awarded}} a penalty {{they can choose}} to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> <b>at</b> goal, kick the ball or tap the ball with their foot and run it. A {{successful}} shot at goal scores three points. The opposing team must stand still with their hands beside their sides until after the ball has been kicked at the goal. If the ball is kicked into touch the team that kicked it gets the throw in at the resulting line-out and it is always taken where the ball crosses the line. Free kicks are similar, except a shot at goal {{can not be taken}} and if the ball is kicked into touch the kicking team does not receive the throw at the ensuing line-out. There is also no gain in ground from the free kick if kicked directly into touch, unless it was taken from behind the kicking team's 22-metre line. Opposition players can also try and charge down free kicks as soon as the kicker makes a move to kick. The captain can always choose to take a scrum from a penalty or free kick. A player can claim a mark by catching the ball directly from a kick (except a kick-off) inside their own 22 and shouting [...] "mark" [...] at the same time. The player that claimed the mark cannot be tackled and is awarded a free kick.|$|E
2500|$|The Colts {{would begin}} 2015-16 with mixed expectations. Mackenzie Blackwood was {{expected}} to once again be a huge presence in goal. On defense, offensively talented Rasmus Andersson, and overage captain Michael Webster returned and {{would be expected to}} log the majority of the minutes. They were joined by rookies Matt Brassard, Justin Murray, and Rocky Kaura as well as returning Brandon Prophet and Josh Carrick. On forward, 100-point scorer Joseph Blandisi left for the New Jersey Devils farm system, but fellow century scorers from the previous year, Kevin Labanc and Andrew Mangiapane would return. [...] Along with overager Justin Scott, explosive Brendan Lemieux, and import Julius Nattinen they would share the majority of the ice time on offense. The Colts first few games were a roller coaster ride. While their defense was surprisingly sound, their offense was sporadic. The start of the season was also marred by suspensions to Andrew Mangiapane, Mackenzie Blackwood; which would delay his World Junior start, and several to Brendan Lemieux which would lead to his off-loading to the Windsor Spitfires. Ironically, after the Lemieux trade, the Colts offense picked up and late in the season the division leading Colts decided to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> <b>at</b> making the finals by trading Rocky Kaura, Brandon Prophet and a bunch of draft picks in several deals for goalie David Ovjannikov, forwards Keigan Goetz and Dylan Sadowy as well as Cameron Lizotte, and Greg DiTomasso on defense. The Colts would again win the division in record-breaking fashion where once again Andrew Mangiapane and Kevin Labanc would score over 100 points, the latter breaking many franchise records in the process. In the playoffs the Mississauga Steelheads would take the Colts the distance before the Colts came out on top. The Colts would get their revenge in the next round, beating the North Bay Battalion in four straight, only to find themselves {{on the wrong side of}} a sweep in the conference finals by a surprise Niagara IceDogs team.|$|E
