5|$|Despite the passed balls, Wilhelm won the American League ERA {{title with}} a 2.19 ERA. During the 1960 season, Orioles manager Paul Richards devised a larger mitt so his {{catchers}} {{could handle the}} knuckleball. Richards was well equipped with starting pitchers during that year. By {{the middle of the}} season, he said <b>that</b> <b>eight</b> of his pitchers could serve as starters. Wilhelm started 11 of the 41 games in which he appeared. He earned an 11–8 record, a 3.31 ERA and seven saves. He only started one game the following year, but he was an All-Star, registered 18 saves and had a 2.30 ERA.|$|E
5|$|Forecasts of {{hurricane}} activity are issued before each hurricane season by hurricane expert Dr. William M. Gray {{and his associates}} at Colorado State University.

The June 2, 1987, report suggested <b>that</b> <b>eight</b> tropical storms would form during the 1987 season, five of them becoming hurricanes.|$|E

5|$|The first {{roadshow}} {{opened at}} the Broadway Theatre in New York City on November 13, 1940. The Disneys had secured a year's lease with the venue that was fully equipped with Fantasound, which took personnel a week {{working around the clock}} to install. Proceeds made on the night went to the British War Relief Society for the efforts in the Battle of Britain. Ticket demand was so great <b>that</b> <b>eight</b> telephone operators were employed to handle the extra calls while the adjoining store was rented out to cater the box office bookings. Fantasia ran at the Broadway for forty-nine consecutive weeks, the longest run achieved by a film at the time. Its run continued for a total of fifty-seven weeks until February 28, 1942.|$|E
5|$|From stanzas 22 to 24, {{more details}} are given by Odin about Valhalla: the holy {{doors of the}} ancient gate Valgrind stand before Valhalla, Valhalla has five hundred and forty doors <b>that</b> <b>eight</b> hundred men can exit from at once (from which the einherjar will flow forth to engage the wolf Fenrir at Ragnarök). Within Valhalla exists Thor's hall Bilskirnir, and within it exist five hundred and forty rooms, {{and of all the}} halls within Valhalla, Odin states that he thinks his son's may be greatest. In stanzas 25 through 26, Odin states that the goat Heiðrún and the hart Eikþyrnir stand on top of Valhalla and graze on the {{branches}} of the tree Læraðr. Heiðrún produces vats of mead that liquor cannot be compared to, and from Eikþyrnir's antlers drip liquid into the spring Hvergelmir from which flows forth all waters.|$|E

5|$|On August7, five Hurricane Hunter {{planes were}} {{dispatched}} to Hickam Air Force Base to fly missions into the storm. Later that day, the Central Pacific Hurricane Center issued tropical storm watches {{for the island}} of Hawaii, Maui, Kahoolawe, Lanai, and Molokai. On August9, the watch was expanded to include Oahu. The watches for the Big Island were later cancelled as the forecast track appeared to drift further north toward Maui County and Oahu. The Red Cross opened shelters throughout the islands on August10. Twelve were on the Big Island, seven were on Maui, two on Molokai and one on Lanai. The Honolulu International Airport ensured <b>that</b> <b>eight</b> generators were ready for use in case Felicia caused a power outage at the airport. All tropical storm watches were cancelled at 11 a.m. August 11 as Felicia dissipated to a remnant low.|$|E
5|$|On the Rauma Line, {{the units}} {{are used as}} feeders between the Oslo–Trondheim express trains on the Dovre Line, {{connecting}} Dombås to Åndalsnes. On the Røros Line, the trains are used both on the Hamar–Røros and the Røros–Trondheim section. On the Nordland Line, the Class 93 serves both the Ole Tobias service between Trondheim and Mo i Rana. The unit was considered for use on the Meråker Line as well, but this has continued to be operated by Class 92 units. The initial plan was <b>that</b> <b>eight</b> of the eleven units were needed for daily operations. Four on the Røros Line, two on the Nordland Line and two on the Rauma Line. The additional four units were needed for operating the Trondheim–Bodø trains on the Nordland Line, of which three would be used at any one time. Double units (four cars) are sometimes operated on the Trondheim – Mo i Rana train, as are the Friday and Sunday afternoon trains on the Rauma Line, for exchange of equipment, and to handle the increased traffic on these days. In addition, NSB uses the trains on the commuter services Bodø–Fauske–Rognan and Mo i Rana–Mosjøen.|$|E
5|$|Run privately for profit, as {{were all}} English prisons until the 19th century, the Marshalsea {{looked like an}} Oxbridge college and functioned as an {{extortion}} racket. Debtors in the 18th century who could afford the prison fees had access to a bar, shop and restaurant, and retained the crucial privilege of being allowed out during the day, which gave {{them a chance to}} earn money for their creditors. Everyone else was crammed into one of nine small rooms with dozens of others, possibly for years for the most modest of debts, which increased as unpaid prison fees accumulated. The poorest faced starvation and, if they crossed the jailers, torture with skullcaps and thumbscrews. A parliamentary committee reported in 1729 that 300inmates had starved to death within a three-month period, and <b>that</b> <b>eight</b> to ten were dying every 24hours in the warmer weather.|$|E
