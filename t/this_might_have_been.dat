This was attributed to a history of rapid evolution of an autapomorphic phenotype of Antilope. <b>This</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> aided by a particularly strong selection of a few dominant males due to its lekking behaviour.|$|E
5|$|Adams' 1996 sequel, Tales from Watership Down {{includes}} stories {{where the}} female rabbits {{play a more}} prominent role in the Watership Down warren.

5|$|An {{examination}} of the blood stains found inside 46Lower Belgrave Street demonstrated that Rivett had been attacked in the basement kitchen, while Lady Lucan had been attacked {{at the top of}} the basement stairs. The blood stains found inside the Ford Corsair were of the AB blood group; the report concluded that <b>this</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> a mixture of blood from both women. Hair similar to Lady Lucan's was also found inside the car.|$|E

Little also {{suggests that}} it is likely that Rogers gained his maritime experience with Yeamans' ship on the Newfoundland fleet. Rogers completed his apprenticeship in November 1704.|$|E
5|$|In October 2002, {{four months}} after Thrud issue 1 was published, Critchlow {{returned}} to 2000AD using his new computer-drawn style. His first story was the Judge Dredd, Out of the Undercity story written by John Wagner. The new style was initially well received by 2000AD Review and seen as a marked improvement over his previous fully painted style with clearer figures and atmospheric colouring. As the Undercity story developed, however, Critchlow was criticised for using too narrow a palette, with too many greys and blues, although <b>this</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{as a result of}} the story being set underground.|$|E
5|$|Work on {{the pyramid}} and {{mortuary}} temple of Nyuserre's mother, Khentkaus II, had begun during her husband's rule but was {{stopped in the}} tenth year of his reign, at which point only the pyramid core was still uncased. After a delay of 12 years, Nyuserre Ini restarted the building work, and expended much effort in completing {{the majority of the}} construction. The motivation for <b>this</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> to legitimise his rule following the premature death of Neferefre and the possible challenge by Shepseskare.|$|E

5|$|Another {{unidentified}} parrot specimen, {{this one}} brown and housed in Cabinet du Roi, {{was described by}} the French naturalist Comte de Buffon in 1779 under his entry for the Mascarene parrot, in which he pointed out {{similarities and differences between}} the two. The English palaeontologist Julian Hume has suggested the possibility that <b>this</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> a lesser vasa parrot, if not a discoloured old Mascarene grey parakeet (Psittacula bensoni). The specimen is now lost. English zoologist and author George Robert Gray assigned some eclectus parrot (Eclectus roratus) subspecies from the Moluccas to Mascarinus in his book A List of the Genera of Birds from the 1840s, but this idea was soon dismissed by other writers.|$|E
5|$|Stansfield {{had long}} felt {{uncomfortable with the}} idea of medical {{officers}} marrying. Louise Hind, in Gender and Class in English Asylums, 1890–1914, hints that <b>this</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> the result of misogynist tendencies, although Hubert Bond, his obituary-writer and former colleague, preemptively defended him against these claims. Stansfield nevertheless married twice; firstly, in 1908 to Mary Caroline (died 1926), a daughter of the Hon. James Dever, a Canadian senator from St John's, Newfoundland. After her death, he married (in 1929) Marie, second daughter of Alexander Effremoff, of Moscow; he had met her in Paris, where she had been living in exile after the Russian Revolution. There were no children from either marriage, but he worked with the scouting movement, and served as President of the North Central Kent Boys' Scouts Association. He was a fond rose-grower and it was the gardens at Southmead in Wimbledon which attracted him and his first wife to the house; they lived there for many years. He retired to Castello Devachan in Sanremo, Italy, with his second wife, before going to Paris to seek treatment for an illness; he died there on 19 February 1939. His widow remained at the Castello in Sanremo until her death in 1973, spending her last 21 years as starosta of the Russian Orthodox parish community there.|$|E

25|$|De la Gardie was {{the most}} renowned and {{influential}} among the regency members, although he was often challenged. <b>This</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{due to the fact}} that he was, reportedly, unable to work enough and that he often left the centre of power to spend significant time on his different estates, a disadvantage for both the government and De la Gardie's own position of power.|$|E
25|$|Under these circumstances, some Georgians doubted {{whether the}} {{uprising}} could be successful. The captured rebel leader, Jugheli, urged Cheka officials {{to allow him}} to inform his comrades that their plans had been discovered and advise them to abandon their proposed revolt, but the Cheka refused. Jugheli's message still reached the rebels, but the conspirators decided that <b>this</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> a Cheka provocation and went ahead with plans for the uprising.|$|E

25|$|A {{carpenter}} {{had visited}} the site on Sunday to collect some tools, but after 20 minutes attempting to contact a security guard to let him in, had climbed the fence, collected his tools and climbed out again. The carpenter {{reported that he had}} heard machinery operating towards the stern of the ship, but it was not clear whether <b>this</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> the site diesel generator which ran at all times.|$|E
25|$|The flight engineer's and {{the first}} officer's {{apparent}} hesitation to challenge Veldhuyzen van Zanten further. The official investigation suggested that <b>this</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> because the captain was not only senior in rank, but {{also one of the}} most respected pilots working for the airline. This view is questioned by Jan Bartelski, a former KLM captain and the president of the International Federation of Air Line Pilots' Associations (IFALPA), who knew both men and believes that this explanation is inconsistent with his experience of their personalities.|$|E
25|$|However, {{his works}} were criticized for lacking {{characteristics}} of true polyphonism, {{as pointed out}} by Eugène Ysaÿe. Yehudi Menuhin, on the other hand, suggested that <b>this</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{the result of his}} reliance on the guitar (in lieu of the piano) as an aid in composition. The orchestral parts for his concertos were often polite, unadventurous, and clearly supportive of the soloist. In this, his style is consistent with that of other Italian composers such as Paisiello, Rossini and Donizetti, who were influenced by the guitar-song milieu of Naples during this period.|$|E

25|$|Finkel's opponents {{argued that}} the pure focus on the Talmud would {{automatically}} create greatness in both scholarship and ethics. But Finkel believed that, while <b>this</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> true in previous generations, the modern age was different. In his view, too many new enticing secular ideologies, such as Socialism and Zionism and the very real lure of atheism in universities, were becoming a replacement for traditional Judaism for many young Jews. He was determined to prove that {{what he had to}} offer was more appealing than anything the outside world could offer.|$|E
25|$|In 1534, at {{the time}} of the arrival of the first columns of Spanish conquistadores, the {{population}} of the present day territories of Ecuador is believed to border the figure of one million inhabitants. <b>This</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> a result of epidemics of smallpox and diphtheria that spread in the Andes after the first contacts with Spanish explorers and their livestock. According to early Spanish chronicles the Inca Huayna Capac died of smallpox and then the territories of Collasuyo and central Peru so a period of civil war for the control of the royal household between two brothers each an heir to the dominions of their respective maternal feudal lands.|$|E
25|$|In any case, Hildegard and Jutta were {{enclosed}} {{together at}} the Disibodenberg, and formed {{the core of a}} growing community of women attached to the male monastery. Jutta was also a visionary and thus attracted many followers who came to visit her at the cloister. Hildegard tells us that Jutta taught her to read and write, but that she was unlearned and therefore incapable of teaching Hildegard sound biblical interpretation. The written record of the Life of Jutta indicates that Hildegard probably assisted her in reciting the psalms, working in the garden and other handiwork, and tending to the sick. <b>This</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> a time when Hildegard learned how to play the ten-stringed psaltery. Volmar, a frequent visitor, may have taught Hildegard simple psalm notation. The time she studied music could have been the beginning of the compositions she would later create.|$|E
