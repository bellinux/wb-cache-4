5|$|Since {{then the}} role that {{telecommunications}} has played in social relations has become increasingly important. In recent years, the popularity of social networking sites has increased dramatically. These sites allow users <b>to</b> <b>communicate</b> <b>with</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> as well as post photographs, events and profiles for others to see. The profiles can list a person's age, interests, sexual preference and relationship status. In this way, these sites can play important role in everything from organising social engagements to courtship.|$|E

INTRODUCTION Bluetooth-technology [12] enables objects <b>to</b> <b>communicate</b> <b>with</b> <b>each</b> others, humans <b>communicate</b> <b>with</b> <b>each</b> others and objects <b>communicate</b> <b>with</b> humans. Context awareness is crucial to users when interpreting the visibilty of objects, services and other users.

5|$|People {{identifying}} with Asperger syndrome may refer to themselves in casual conversation as aspies (a term first used in print by Liane Holliday Willey in 1999). The word neurotypical (abbreviated NT) describes a person whose neurological development and state are typical, {{and is often}} used to refer to non-autistic people. The Internet has allowed individuals with AS <b>to</b> <b>communicate</b> <b>with</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> {{in a way that was}} not previously possible because of their rarity and geographic dispersal, forming a subculture composed of people with Asperger's. Internet sites like Wrong Planet have made it easier for individuals to connect.|$|E
5|$|Foraging {{behaviour}} {{depends on}} the type of termite. For example, certain species feed on the wood structures they inhabit, and others harvest food that is near the nest. Most workers are rarely found out in the open, and do not forage unprotected; they rely on sheeting and runways to protect them from predators. Subterranean termites construct tunnels and galleries to look for food, and workers who manage to find food sources recruit additional nestmates by depositing a phagostimulant pheromone that attracts workers. Foraging workers use semiochemicals <b>to</b> <b>communicate</b> <b>with</b> <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> and workers who begin to forage outside of their nest release trail pheromones from their sternal glands. In one species, Nasutitermes costalis, there are three phases in a foraging expedition: first, soldiers scout an area. When they find a food source, they communicate to other soldiers and a small force of workers starts to emerge. In the second phase, workers appear in large numbers at the site. The third phase is marked by a {{decrease in the number of}} soldiers present and an increase in the number of workers. Isolated termite workers may engage in Lévy flight behaviour as an optimised strategy for finding their nestmates or foraging for food.|$|E
