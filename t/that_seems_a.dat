2500|$|The {{vigorous}} theophany {{that the}} first part describes is in the following verses: [...] "Chill the flesh and the hairs/ to me and all [...] only by listening and seeing him" [...] ("Arrepiam-se as carnes e os cabelos / a mi e a todos só de ouvi-lo e vê-lo"). This is intended to convey pure fear, the imminent threat of annihilation. The evil demigod is preceded by a black cloud, which appears above {{the heads of the}} sailors. Expressing the surprise he experiences, Gama quotes himself: [...] "Oh divine power – [...] said – sublimated, / what divine threat or what secret / this clime and this sea presents to us / <b>that</b> <b>seems</b> <b>a</b> bigger thing than a storm?" [...] ("Ó potestade – disse – sublimada, / que ameaço divino ou que segredo / este clima e este mar nos apresenta, / que mor cousa parece que tormenta?") The [...] "strange Colossus" [...] ("estranhíssimo Colosso"): [...] "Rude son of the Earth" [...] ("Filho aspérrimo da Terra") is described as having: [...] "huge stature", [...] "squalid beard", [...] "earthy colour", [...] "full of earth and crinkly of hairs / blacken the mouth, yellow the teeth"("disforme estatura", [...] "barba esquálida", [...] "cor terrena", [...] "cheios de terra e crespos os cabelos / a boca negra, os dentes, amarelos").|$|E
2500|$|Before the {{broadcast}} of the first episode, David Brown from Radio Times said, [...] "Atmospheric, intriguing and with a primetime sheen <b>that</b> <b>seems</b> <b>a</b> world away from soapland, it'll have you hooked from episode one." [...] A writer for What's on TV said, [...] "It’s gripping and surprising, has a thoroughbred cast of Irish actors and is more filmic than soap. Worth delving into even if you’ve never heard of Kat and Alfie." [...] Tom Eames from Digital Spy called the series a [...] "bold move from the BBC" [...] that [...] "looks like a show that is a must-watch whether you're an EastEnders fan or not." [...] Steven Murphy, editor for Inside Soap, urged the magazine's readers to watch Redwater, despite previous soap spin-offs, such as Ricky & Bianca or Coronation Street: Open All Hours, being unmemorable, because [...] "It's mysterious, moody and dramatic—and looks stunning by making the best of its gorgeous Irish location." [...] Fiona Sturges from The Guardian said, [...] "There is—improbable as it sounds—a degree of suspense here, not to say proper acting. The problem is that whenever Kat and Alfie appear—he the well-meaning idiot, she the wounded fishwife—the spell is broken. The BBC is trying to sell this as Broadchurch meets The Wicker Man, {{but the reality is}} more NCSI: Ballykissangel. I love Kat and Alfie, but the quicker they get back to Albert Square, the better." [...] Sean O'Grady from The Independent said, [...] "it's an un-soapy, unclaustrophobic sort of production, and a storyline about a long-lost son adds the necessary emotional stress." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Advertise. I'll {{think about}} it,' said Manston, {{lingering}} {{on the word}} as he pronounced it. 'Yes, <b>that</b> <b>seems</b> <b>a</b> right thing--quite a right thing.' ...|$|E
60|$|They waited <b>a</b> time <b>that</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>an</b> age, {{and then}} the same muffled boom troubled the solemn hush.|$|R
6000|$|... “You {{asked us}} to lunch,” they exclaimed hurriedly. <b>That</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>a</b> more {{immediately}} important point to clear up than the question of identity.|$|R
60|$|For I am {{weary of}} the sport, <b>That</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>a</b> while agone so sweet, Of Elzevirs an inch too short, And First Editions--incomplete.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Come, Byles, <b>that</b> <b>seems</b> <b>a</b> {{deal more}} likely,' said Mr. Tomlinson, in a conciliatory tone, {{apparently}} of opinion that history was {{a process of}} ingenious guessing.|$|E
6000|$|No more, with forest-fingers {{crawling}} free [...] O'er dark flint wall <b>that</b> <b>seems</b> <b>a</b> wall of eyes, [...] Shall evil {{break my}} soul with mysteries Of some world-poison maddening bush and tree.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why then," [...] said I, [...] "the {{only hope}} lies in {{abstracting}} that letter {{in such a}} manner that he shall not suspect the loss; and <b>that</b> <b>seems</b> <b>a</b> very desperate hope." ...|$|E
60|$|A wild thought {{crossed his}} fancy <b>that</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>an</b> inspiration. They would share the risks alike. He leaned towards her: their lips met {{in their first}} kiss.|$|R
60|$|<b>That</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>a</b> hopeless task to them, but {{realizing that}} Ozma was {{determined}} not to fight, they tried to think of some means that might promise escape.|$|R
60|$|<b>That</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>a</b> {{signal for}} him to come to life. I guessed he had not much fancied the wide and {{somewhat}} variable sweep of that cocked gun.|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps," [...] {{answered}} Marcus with a yawn; [...] "but, friend Nehushta, I {{have been}} associating with a Christian and have caught something of her doctrines. <b>That</b> <b>seems</b> <b>a</b> fine sword. You had better keep it. Good-night." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{know very}} well, uncle," [...] she said, [...] "that I am not clever, and that I {{understand}} nothing whatever about business, or {{anything to do}} with it, but I can at least promise that I will be faithful. <b>That</b> <b>seems</b> <b>a</b> very poor reward for all that you have done for me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How is it you're {{so afraid}} of the thunder, then, my Piero?" [...] said Nello, {{determined}} to chase down the accuser. [...] "You {{ought to be able}} to understand why one man is shaken by a thing <b>that</b> <b>seems</b> <b>a</b> trifle to others--you who hide yourself with the rats as soon as a storm comes on." ...|$|E
60|$|The fan stopped. There was <b>a</b> silence <b>that</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>an</b> eternity as {{the palm}} leaf trembled in her hand, {{there was an}} answer that strove tenderly to command.|$|R
60|$|Indeed, {{the small}} waif {{by the fire}} was {{emitting}} a series of noises <b>that</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>a</b> queer mixture of low growls and whines--evidence unimpeachable {{that he had been}} correctly named.|$|R
60|$|He {{was still}} rather silent and reserved; but <b>that</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>a</b> {{part of his}} nature, {{inherited}} doubtless from his father, and when he chose to talk his conversation was interesting and agreeable.|$|R
6000|$|He {{will have}} told you doubtless more of my news than I could tell you myself; he has your European perspective, a thing long lost to me. I heard {{with a great deal}} of {{interest}} the news of Box Hill. [...] And so I understand it is to be enclosed! Allow me to remark, <b>that</b> <b>seems</b> <b>a</b> far more barbaric trait of manners than the most barbarous of ours. We content ourselves with cutting off an occasional head.|$|E
60|$|What to do {{with her}} I do not know. A League, after all, seems ineffectual; she would break up any League. I have thought of giving her in charge for assault, but I shrink from the invidious {{publicity}} of that. Still, I am in grim earnest to do something. I think at times that the compulsory adoption of a narrow doorway for churches and places of public entertainment might be some protection for quiet, inoffensive people. How she would rage outside to be sure! Yet <b>that</b> <b>seems</b> <b>a</b> great undertaking.|$|E
6000|$|... "I WON'T cry. It's silly--and weak--there's {{the third}} tear {{splashing}} down by my nose. There are more coming! I must {{think of something}} funny to stop them. But there's nothing funny except what is connected with Avonlea, and that only makes things worse--four--five--I'm going home next Friday, but <b>that</b> <b>seems</b> <b>a</b> hundred years away. Oh, Matthew is nearly home by now--and Marilla is at the gate, looking down the lane for him--six--seven--eight--oh, there's no use in counting them! They're coming in a flood presently. I can't cheer up--I don't WANT to cheer up. It's nicer to be miserable!" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>That</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>a</b> wise {{thing to}} do, so they all sat {{down upon the}} grass, {{including}} Gloria, and the grasshopper perched upon Trot's shoulder and allowed her to stroke him gently with her hand.|$|R
60|$|At last, {{rounding}} <b>an</b> antlered headland, <b>that</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>a</b> moose at bay--ere long, {{we launched}} upon blue lake-like waters, serene as Windermere, or Horicon. Thus, from the boisterous storms of youth, we glide upon senility.|$|R
6000|$|<b>That</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>a</b> good idea, so they {{halted the}} procession, and the Bear King held the little Pink Bear {{on his lap}} and turned the crank in its side and asked, [...] "Where is Ozma of Oz?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You make it my {{privilege}} {{to keep you}} from doing wrong for the right's sake. I'm sorry, with all my heart and soul, for this error; but I can't blame myself, and I won't deny myself the happiness I haven't done anything to forfeit. I will never give you up. I will wait as long as you please for the time when you shall feel free from this mistake; but you shall be mine at last. Remember that. I might go away for months--a year, even; but <b>that</b> <b>seems</b> <b>a</b> cowardly and guilty thing, and I'm not afraid, and I'm not guilty, and I'm going to stay here and try to see you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "As we do here. It's in {{your blood}} and our blood. It's the {{instinct}} of the English and the Irish anyhow to suspect government and take the risks of the chancy way.... And manifestly the Russians, if you read their novelists, have the same twist in them.... When we get this young Prussian here, he's a marvel to us. He really believes in Law. He likes to obey. <b>That</b> <b>seems</b> <b>a</b> sort of joke to us. It's curious how foreign these Germans are--to {{all the rest of}} the world. Because of their docility. Scratch the Russian and you get the Tartar. Educate the Russian or the American or the Englishman or the Irishman or Frenchman or any real northern European except the German, and you get the Anarchist, that is to say the man who dreams of order without organisation--of something beyond organisation....|$|E
60|$|The canoe was {{shooting}} onward through dim shadow very fast but more steadily, and raising my {{eyes from the}} dull green water before us--these craft are always paddled with one's face toward the bow--I looked about me hopelessly. In these days of easy travel there are doubtless many who have from a securely railed-off platform gazed down into the black depths of a Pacific Slope cañon upon a river <b>that</b> <b>seems</b> <b>a</b> narrow thread in the great gulf below. These will have {{some idea of what}} I saw, but they may take the word of one who knows, which is easier than making the experiment, that such places look very much worse from the bottom. Those who have not may try to picture tremendous--and the word is used with its amplest significance--walls of slightly overhanging rock, through which aided by grinding boulders and scoring shingle, the river has widened as well as deepened its channel a little every century, while between the white welter at their feet lies a breadth of troubled green where the stream flows heaped up, as it were, in the center.|$|E
6000|$|... “Hopkins always {{complained that}} Dane Cop {{was not worth}} the rent, but it will bring you in a good revenue now,” said the girl. “Still, doesn’t <b>that</b> <b>seem</b> <b>a</b> little hard upon {{the man who has}} lost it?” ...|$|R
5000|$|The Washington Post {{wrote in}} a 1973 article that [...] "many people credit or blame him with almost singlehandedly {{defeating}} a home rule measure <b>that</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>a</b> sure thing, with President Johnson's backing, to pass the House in 1965." ...|$|R
60|$|Virginia {{raised her}} eyes to the {{painting}} on the wall over the marble mantel. The face under the heavy coils of brown hair was sweet and gentle, delicately feminine. It had an expression of sorrow <b>that</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>a</b> prophecy.|$|R
6000|$|... "On {{the first}} point, my dear Mowbray," [...] said Lord Etherington, [...] "I am free to own to you, that, without meaning your sister the least affront, I {{would have got}} rid of this clause if I could; for every man would fain choose a wife for himself, and I feel no hurry to marry at all. But the rogue-lawyers, after taking fees, and keeping me in hand for years, have at length roundly told me the clause must be {{complied}} with, or Nettlewood must have another master. So I thought it best {{to come down here}} in person, in order to address the fair lady; but as accident has hitherto prevented my seeing her, and as I found in her brother a man who understands the world, I hope you will not think the worse of me, that I have endeavoured in the outset to make you my friend. Truth is, I shall be twenty-five {{in the course of a}} month; and without your favour, and the opportunities which only you can afford me, <b>that</b> <b>seems</b> <b>a</b> short time to woo and win a lady of Miss Mowbray's merit." ...|$|E
60|$|Mary Warren now {{hastened to}} seek her father, while I {{was left to}} take care of the horse. This I did by {{fastening}} him to the rails of a fence, that was lined for a long distance by horses and wagons drawn up by the way-side. Surprisingly few persons in the country, at this day, are seen on horseback. Notwithstanding the vast difference in the amount of the population, ten horsemen were to be met with forty years ago, by all accounts, on the highways of the State, for one to-day. The well-known vehicle, called a dearborn, with its four light wheels and mere shell of a box, is in such general use as to have superseded almost every other species of conveyance. Coaches and chariots are no longer met with, except in the towns; and even the coachee, the English sociable, which was once so common, has very generally given way to a sort of carriage-wagon, <b>that</b> <b>seems</b> <b>a</b> very general favourite. My grandmother, who did use the stately-looking and elegant chariot in town, had nothing but this carriage-wagon in the country; and I question if one-half of the population of the State would know what to call the former vehicle, if they should see it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course," [...] said Matt, [...] "I'm ridiculous, I know that. I haven't got {{anything}} to found my hopes on {{but the fact}} that there's nothing in my way to the one insuperable obstacle: to the fact that she doesn't and can't really care a straw for me. But just now <b>that</b> <b>seems</b> <b>a</b> mere bagatelle." [...] He laughed with a nervous joy, and he kept talking, as he walked up and down Wade's study. [...] "I don't know that I have the hope of anything; and I don't see how I'm to find out whether I have or not, for the present. You know, Wade," [...] he went on, with a simple-hearted sweetness, which Wade found touching, [...] "I'm twenty-eight years old, and I don't believe I've ever been in love before. Little fancies, of course; summer flirtations; every one has them; but never anything serious, anything like this. And I could see, at home, that they would be glad to have had me married. I rather think my father believes that a good sensible wife would bring me back to faith in commercial civilization." [...] He laughed out his relish of the notion, but went on, gravely: [...] "Poor father! This whole business has been a terrible trial to him." ...|$|E
6000|$|The girl {{gripped her}} arm cruelly. [...] "One must choose sometimes, and I am my husband's flesh and blood. Once <b>that</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>a</b> curious fancy, repugnant too, {{but it is}} real now--one of the great real things to Charley and me." ...|$|R
6000|$|There was no hurry. I {{had passed}} for master, and I {{had all the}} rest of my life before me to make the best of it. <b>That</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>a</b> long time. I went leisurely through a small mental calculation, and said: ...|$|R
6000|$|The lineaments, a {{heart that}} {{laughter}} has made sweet, [...] These, these remain, but I record what's gone. A crowd [...] Will gather, {{and not know}} it walks the very street [...] Whereon a thing once walked <b>that</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>a</b> burning cloud.|$|R
