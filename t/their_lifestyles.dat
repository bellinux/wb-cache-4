25|$|The feather mites, Astigmata, {{are found}} on almost all species of birds, except for penguins, and are highly {{specialized}} {{for life on}} their host.

25|$|Ibn Khaldun {{argues that}} each dynasty has within itself {{the seeds of}} its own downfall. He {{explains}} that ruling houses tend to emerge on the peripheries of great empires and use the unity presented by those areas to their advantage {{in order to bring}} about a change in leadership. As the new rulers establish themselves at the center of their empire, they become increasingly lax and more concerned with maintaining <b>their</b> <b>lifestyles.</b> Thus, a new dynasty can emerge at the periphery of their control and effect a change in leadership, beginning the cycle anew.|$|E
25|$|The {{stories of}} the two were only loosely {{connected}} until the 1960s, when Leiber organized them chronologically and added additional material in preparation for paperback publication. Starting as young men, the two separately meet their female lovers, meet each other, and lose both their lovers in the same night, which explains both their friendship and the arrested adolescence of <b>their</b> <b>lifestyles.</b> However, in later stories, the two mature, learn leadership, and eventually settle down with new female partners on the Iceland-like Rime Isle. Leiber contemplated continuing the series beyond this point, but died prior to doing so.|$|E

25|$|At {{the end of}} the {{frontier}} wars, the Qing army had started to weaken significantly.

This was the main reason for the Qing military's failure to suppress the White Lotus Rebellion, which started towards the end of the Qianlong Emperor's reign and extended into the reign of the Jiaqing Emperor.|$|E
25|$|Homo sapiens {{settled in}} Brittany around 35,000 years ago. They {{replaced}} or absorbed the Neanderthals and developed local industries, {{similar to the}} Châtelperronian or to the Magdalenian. After the last glacial period, the warmer climate allowed the area to become heavily wooded. At that time, Brittany was populated by relatively large communities who started to change <b>their</b> <b>lifestyles</b> from a life of hunting and gathering, to become settled farmers. Agriculture was introduced during the 5th millennium BC by migrants {{from the south and}} east. However, the Neolithic Revolution in Brittany did not happen due to a radical change of population, but by slow immigration and exchange of skills.|$|E
25|$|As Great Britain became heavily wooded, {{movement}} {{between different}} areas was restricted, and travel between {{what was to}} become known as Wales and continental Europe became easier by sea, rather than by land. People came to Wales by boat from the Iberian Peninsula. These Neolithic colonists integrated with the indigenous people, gradually changing <b>their</b> <b>lifestyles</b> from a nomadic life of hunting and gathering, to become farmers, some of whom settled in the area that would become Glamorgan. They cleared the forests to establish pasture and to cultivate the land, developed new technologies such as ceramics and textile production, and they brought a tradition of long barrow construction that began in continental Europe during the 7thmillenniumBC.|$|E

25|$|Groups and {{individuals}} have been assaulted, repressed, harassed and disrupted {{because of their}} political views, social beliefs and <b>their</b> <b>lifestyles.</b> Investigations have been based upon vague standards whose breadth made excessive collection inevitable. Unsavory, harmful and vicious tactics have been employed—including anonymous attempts to break up marriages, disrupt meetings, ostracize persons from their professions, and provoke target groups into rivalries that might result in deaths. Intelligence agencies have served the political and personal objectives of presidents and other high officials. While the agencies often committed excesses in response to pressure from high officials in the Executive branch and Congress, they also occasionally initiated improper activities and then concealed them from officials whom they had a duty to inform.|$|E
25|$|Although Gwbert and Ferwig {{are only}} one mile apart (and share a common Community Council) their {{demographics}} and environments are very different. Ferwig is a long-established agricultural area, characterised by little change to the indigenous population, or to <b>their</b> <b>lifestyles.</b> Gwbert has only existed for little more than 120 years, and is considerably more diverse. Since inception it has been predominantly a community of well-funded incomers from many areas of Wales and beyond, permanent and temporary. The vibrant tourist and sporting facilities encourage out-of-town visitors; {{the residents of the}} caravan park and hotels more than double the population for much of the year, and additional diversity is created by international staff within the hospitality sector.

The group intended to use to the studio only to polish their previous sessions' output, but ended up writing and recording what became most of the album for two months.
