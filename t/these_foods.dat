5|$|Fruit and vegetables, {{particularly}} leafy vegetables, {{have been}} implicated in nearly half the gastrointestinal infections caused by norovirus in the United States. <b>These</b> <b>foods</b> are commonly eaten raw and may become contaminated during their preparation by an infected food handler. Hygiene is important when handling foods to be eaten raw, and such products need to be properly cleaned, handled, and stored to limit contamination.|$|E
5|$|Sucrose {{is found}} in the stems of {{sugarcane}} and roots of sugar beet. It also occurs naturally alongside fructose and glucose in other plants, in particular fruits and some roots such as carrots. The different proportions of sugars found in <b>these</b> <b>foods</b> determines the range of sweetness experienced when eating them. A molecule of sucrose is formed by the combination of a molecule of glucose with a molecule of fructose. After being eaten, sucrose is split into its constituent parts during digestion by a number of enzymes known as sucrases.|$|E

5|$|The {{most common}} {{molecules}} attacked by oxidation are unsaturated fats; oxidation {{causes them to}} turn rancid. Since oxidized lipids are often discolored and usually have unpleasant tastes such as metallic or sulfurous flavors, {{it is important to}} avoid oxidation in fat-rich foods. Thus, <b>these</b> <b>foods</b> are rarely preserved by drying; instead, they are preserved by smoking, salting or fermenting. Even less fatty foods such as fruits are sprayed with sulfurous antioxidants prior to air drying. Oxidation is often catalyzed by metals, which is why fats such as butter should never be wrapped in aluminium foil or kept in metal containers. Some fatty foods such as olive oil are partially protected from oxidation by their natural content of antioxidants, but remain sensitive to photooxidation. Antioxidant preservatives are also added to fat based cosmetics such as lipstick and moisturizers to prevent rancidity.|$|E
25|$|While the {{avoidance}} of nuts and seeds has historically been recommended, no association between eating <b>these</b> <b>foods</b> and diverticulitis has been found, and therefore, avoiding <b>these</b> <b>foods</b> is no longer recommended. Mesalazine and rifaximin appear useful for preventing attacks in those with diverticulosis. For mild diverticulitis, antibiotics by mouth and a liquid diet is recommended. For severe cases, intravenous antibiotics, hospital admission, and complete bowel rest may be recommended. Probiotics are of unclear use. Complications such as abscess formation, fistula formation, and perforation of the colon may require surgery.|$|E

40|$|With growing {{consumers}} {{concern on}} well-being there is vast {{public interest in}} health. This interest has created market demand on foods for specified health use; nutraceuticals and botanical supplements. The increase sales trend of <b>these</b> <b>food</b> categories reflects growing levels of health consciousness throughout communities. Regulatory organisations are considering ways to show scientific basis to support and validate claims for functional ingredients or foods containing them. Fortunately, credible scientific research suggests there are many clinically demonstrated and potential health benefits from <b>these</b> <b>food</b> ingredients. As such foods proliferate {{there is a need}} to collect comprehensive data and make this database systematically available to doctors, herbalists, nutritionists and health professionals...|$|R
25|$|Vitamins and {{minerals}} which are typically derived from plant sources are nonetheless present in most Inuit diets. Vitamins A and D {{are present in}} the oils and livers of cold-water fishes and mammals. Vitamin C is obtained through sources such as caribou liver, kelp, whale skin, and seal brain; because <b>these</b> <b>foods</b> are typically eaten raw or frozen, the vitamin C they contain, which would be destroyed by cooking, is instead preserved.|$|E
25|$|When {{symptoms}} are present, topical anesthetics {{can be used}} to provide temporary relief. Other medications that have been used to manage the symptoms include antihistamines, corticosteroids or anxiolytics, but these drugs have not been formally assessed for efficacy in geographic tongue. If some foods exacerbate or trigger the symptoms, then cutting <b>these</b> <b>foods</b> out of the diet may benefit. One uncontrolled trial has shown some benefit in controlling the symptoms of geographic tongue.|$|E
25|$|The {{conclusion}} {{that can be}} drawn from the newer research is that fruits and vegetables are not as useful for obtaining vitamin A as was thought; in other words, the IUs that <b>these</b> <b>foods</b> were reported to contain were worth much less than the same number of IUs of fat-dissolved oils and (to some extent) supplements. This is important for vegetarians, as night blindness is prevalent in countries where little meat or vitamin A-fortified foods are available.|$|E

25|$|After {{reports of}} {{research}} finding that dietary oats can help lower cholesterol, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a final rule that allows food companies to make health claims on food labels of foods that contain soluble fiber from whole oats (oat bran, oat flour and rolled oats), noting that 3.0grams of soluble fiber daily from <b>these</b> <b>foods</b> {{may reduce the}} risk of heart disease. To qualify for the health claim, the food that contains the oats must provide at least 0.75grams of soluble fiber per serving.|$|E

25|$|A diet low in B12, whether {{voluntary}} or not, {{can also}} cause symptoms of hypocobalaminemia. Many rich sources of B12 come from animal meats and by-productsPopulations in developing countries may {{not have access to}} <b>these</b> <b>foods</b> on a consistent basis, and as a result may become deficient in B12. In addition, vegans, {{and to a lesser extent}} vegetarians, are at risk for consuming a diet low in cobalamin as they voluntarily abstain from animal sources of B12. A combination of these two scenarios may increase prevalence of cobalamin deficit. For instance, B12 deficiency is problematic in India, where the majority of the population is vegetarian and the scarcity of meat consumption is common for omnivores as well.|$|E
25|$|Vietnamese people {{celebrate}} the Lunar New Year annually, {{which is based}} on a lunisolar calendar (calculating both the earth's movement around the sun and the moon around the earth). Tết is generally celebrated on the same day as Chinese New Year, except when the one-hour time difference between Vietnam and China results in new moon occurring on different days. It takes place from {{the first day of the}} first month of the Vietnamese calendar (around late January or early February) until at least the third day. Many Vietnamese prepare for Tết by cooking special holiday food and cleaning the house. <b>These</b> <b>foods</b> include bánh chưng, bánh dày, dried young bamboo soup (canh măng), giò, and sticky rice. Many customs are practices during Tết, such as visiting a person's house on the first day of the new year (xông nhà), ancestor worship, wishing New Year's greetings, giving lucky money to children and elderly people, and opening a shop.|$|E
500|$|Offerings of rice, sake, {{and other}} food are {{given at the}} shrine to appease and please these kitsune messengers, who are then {{expected}} to plead with Inari on the worshipper's behalf. [...] Inari-zushi, a Japanese sushi roll of packaged fried tofu, is another popular offering. [...] Fried tofu {{is believed to be}} a favorite food of Japanese foxes, and an Inari-zushi roll has pointed corners that resemble fox ears, thus reinforcing the association. [...] Priests do not normally offer <b>these</b> <b>foods</b> to the deity, but it is common for shops that line the approach to an Inari shrine to sell fried tofu for devotees to offer. [...] Fox statues are often offered to Inari shrines by worshippers, and on occasion a stuffed and mounted fox is presented to a temple.

40|$|Variation in {{offspring}} {{size and}} number {{has been described}} {{for a wide range}} of organisms. In this study I investigated the relationship between resource level of the mother and size of her offspring in the cladoceran Daphnia magna, in order to assess whether offspring produced at different food levels are optimal in size for <b>these</b> <b>food</b> levels. Optimal offspring size was defined as the size of offspring that yields the highest parental fitness (i. e. offspring of optimal size have the highest juvenile fitness per unit maternal effort invested in them). I observed that especially at the higher food levels, daphnids produced offspring that are larger than the computed optimal offspring size at <b>these</b> <b>food</b> levels. I interpret this as a mechanism to avoid starvation of neonates in the case of suddenly deteriorating food conditions...|$|R
