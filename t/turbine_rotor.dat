25|$|Since the PW1500G mount generates less {{strain on}} the <b>turbine</b> <b>rotor</b> {{assembly}} than the A320neo's PW1100G, it doesn't suffer from start-up and bearing problems but still from premature combustor degradation. After 28,000 engine hours in 14 in-service aircraft with a powerplant dispatch reliability of 99.9%, Swiss replaced an engine pair in May 2017 after 2,400 hr while AirBaltic replaced another one in June. An updated combustor liner with a 6,000-8,000 hr limit has been developed and a third generation for 2018 will raise it to 20,000 hr in benign environments.|$|E
25|$|The Olympus 593 was a 2-shaft {{turbojet}} with reheat. The LP and HP compressors {{both had}} 7 stages and were each {{driven by a}} single-stage turbine. Due to the high inlet air temperatures at Mach 2 cruise - in excess of 120 degrees C - the compressor drums and blades were made from titanium except for the last 4 HP stages which were Nimonic 90 nickel alloy. Nickel alloys were normally only required in the hotter turbine areas but the high temperatures {{that occur in the}} last stages of the compressor at supersonic flight speeds dictated its use in the compressor also. Both the HP and LP <b>turbine</b> <b>rotor</b> blades were cooled.|$|E
25|$|Not {{long after}} the -6 entered service, an {{increase}} in thrust and therefore core power was required. Unable to increase (HP) <b>turbine</b> <b>rotor</b> inlet temperature, General Electric chose the expensive path of reconfiguring the CF6 core to increase its basic size. They removed two stages {{from the rear of}} the HP compressor, leaving an empty air passage where the blades and vanes had once been. Two booster stages were added to the LP (low pressure) compressor, which increased the overall pressure ratio to 29.3. Although the 86.4 in (2.19 m) diameter fan was retained, the airflow was raised to 1,450lb/s (660kg/s), yielding a static thrust of 51,000lbf (227kN). The increase in core size and overall pressure ratio raised the core flow, decreasing the bypass ratio to 4.26.|$|E

40|$|Aerodynamic {{noise from}} wind <b>turbine</b> <b>rotors</b> leads to {{constraints}} in both <b>rotor</b> design and <b>turbine</b> siting. The {{primary source of}} aerodynamic noise on wind <b>turbine</b> <b>rotors</b> is the interaction of turbulent boundary layers on the blades with the blade trailing edges. This report surveys concepts that have been proposed for trailing edge noise reduction, with emphasis on concepts that have been tested at either sub-scale or full-scale. These concepts include trailing edge serrations, low-noise airfoil designs, trailing edge brushes, and porous trailing edges. The demonstrated noise reductions of these concepts are cited, along with their impacts on aerodynamic performance. An assessment is made of future research opportunities in trailing edge noise reduction for wind <b>turbine</b> <b>rotors...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{performance}} of two mixed flow turbocharger <b>turbine</b> <b>rotors</b> is numerically investigated. Significantly, the two rotors differ mainly in their inlet angle geometry, {{one has a}} constant blade angle (rotor A) and the other has a nominal constant incidence angle (rotor B). Since experimental data alone are not sufficient for understanding the detailed flow field within the turbocharger turbine stage, a complete 3 -D Computational Fluid Dynamics model is developed using commercial software Ansys CFX. The model is validated against experimental data for all steady conditions. This study presents a numerical performance prediction of two mixed flow <b>turbine</b> <b>rotors</b> {{for a wide range}} of rotational speeds and pressure ratios.

40|$|LecturePg. 19 - 34 In {{the past}} 10 years, {{there have been}} {{significant}} gains made in the repair of steam <b>turbine</b> <b>rotors</b> {{by the use of}} welding. This has been the result of improvements in several areas dealing with materials, engineering analysis, nondestructive testing, and specialized welding techniques. Several papers have been written on the repair of LP rotors for central generating stations. A few have recently been written on repairs to HP rotors. There has been little written on the welded repair of mechanical drive steam <b>turbine</b> <b>rotors.</b> The specialized welding techniques needed to perform submerged arc welding restoration of mechanical drive steam <b>turbine</b> <b>rotors</b> are highlighted. The advantages of welded repair and the engineering analysis necessary to make a reliable repair to a rotor are also addressed. Basically, two categories of welded repair are studied. One is the welded journal repair. The other is the complete replacement of a stage disc on a monoblock rotor forging by the use of welding. Mock up test assemblies are used, along with sample weld test assemblies, {{in order to try to}} duplicate the actual welding situation as much as possible. Both destructive and nondestructive testing is performed on these test assemblies to determine occurrence of any flaws, mechanical and electrical runout, chemical composition variations, hardness distributions, tensile and yield strength in different directions at room and elevated temperatures, fracture toughness, fracture appearance transition temperatures, stress rupture strength, and fatigue endurance limits. The results from these tests are discussed along with the pertinent engineering requirements that pertain in order to give the limits of welded repair. Plans for further testing are outlined, along with the conclusion that supports continued acceptance of submerged arc weld restoration of steam <b>turbine</b> <b>rotors</b> ensuring reliability of the weld metal and the heat affected zone of the turbine base material...|$|R
