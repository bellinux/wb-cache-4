40|$|In {{this work}} we have studied transgranular {{cleavage}} and the fracture toughness of <b>titanium</b> <b>hydrides</b> {{by means of}} quantum mechanical calculations based on density functional theory. The calculations show that the surface energy decreases and the unstable stacking fault energy increases with increasing hydrogen content. This is consistent with experimental findings of brittle behaviour of <b>titanium</b> <b>hydrides</b> at low temperatures. Based on Griffith-Irwin theory we estimate the fracture toughness of the hydrides {{to be of the}} order of 1 MPa⋅m 1 / 2, which concurs well with experimental data. To investigate the cleavage energetics, we analyse the decohesion at various crystallographic planes and determine the traction-separation laws based on the Rose's extended universal binding energy relation.

The enthalpy, entropy and heat capacity are computed over a wide range of temperature (0 ≲T⩽ 1000 K) and found to concur well with available experimental data. The simulations show that the Debye temperature varies significantly with temperature below about 50 K demonstrating that the Debye model is too simplistic for thermodynamic modelling throughout the entire temperature spectrum. Comparing the Debye temperature from QHA with that calculated from low temperature elastic constants reveals limited agreement, which suggests that the actual frequency distribution characteristics do not comply with that of the Debye model.

50|$|The {{evolution}} of the dihydride from titanium metal and hydrogen has been examined in some detail. α-Titanium has an hexagonal close packed (hcp) structure at room temperature. Hydrogen initially occupies tetrahedral interstitial sites in the titanium. As the H/Ti ratio approaches 2, the material adopts the β-form to a face centred cubic (fcc), δ- form, the H atoms eventually filling all the tetrahedral sites to give the limiting stoichiometry of TiH2.

40|$|The slow-strain-rate (SSR) test {{technique}} {{was used to}} evaluate the susceptibility of Titanium (Ti) Gr- 7 (UNS R 52400) and Ti Gr- 12 (UNS R 53400) to stress corrosion cracking (SCC). Ti Gr- 7 and Ti Gr- 12 are two candidate container materials for the multi-barrier package for nuclear waste. The tests were done in a deaerated 90 C acidic brine (pH {approx} 2. 7) containing 5 weight percent (wt%) sodium chloride (NaCl) using a strain rate of 3. 3 x 10 {sup - 6 } sec{sup - 1 }. Before being tested in the acidic brine, specimens of each alloy were pulled inside the test chamber in the dry condition at ambient temperature. Then while in the test solution, specimens were strained under different cathodic (negative) controlled electrochemical potentials. These controlled potentials were selected based on the corrosion potential measured in the test solution before the specimens were strained. Results indicate that the times to failure (TTF) for Ti Gr- 12 were much shorter than those for Ti Gr- 7. Furthermore, as the applied potential became more cathodic, Ti Gr- 12 showed reduced ductility in terms of percent reduction in area (%RA) and true fracture stress ({sigma}{sub f}). In addition, TTF and percent elongation (%El) reached the minimum values when Ti Gr- 12 was tested under an impressed potential of - 1162 mV. However, for Ti Gr- 7, all these ductility parameters were not significantly influenced by the changes in applied potential. In general, the results of hydrogen analysis by secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) showed increased hydrogen concentration at more cathodic controlled potentials. Optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were used to evaluate the morphology of cracking both at the primary fracture face and the secondary cracks along the gage section of the broken tensile specimen. Transgranular secondary cracks were observed in both alloys possibly resulting from the formation of brittle <b>titanium</b> <b>hydrides</b> due to cathodic charging.

Analysis of the micrographs of the original surface of <b>titanium</b> <b>hydride</b> bead showed that the microstructure of the surface is flat, smooth, in addition the analysis of the microstructure of material surface showed the presence of small porosity, roughness, mainly cavities, as well as shallow longitudinal cracks.

40|$|Mechanical {{alloying}} {{of mixed}} powders {{is of great}} importance for preparing oxide dispersion strengthened ferritic steels. In this study, the microstructual evolution of ferritic steel powder mixed with TiHx, YH 2 and Fe 2 O 3 {{in the process of}} mechanical alloying is systematically investigated by using X-ray diffraction analysis, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and microhardness tests. It is found that <b>titanium,</b> yttrium <b>hydrides</b> and iron oxide are completely dissolved during milling, and homogeneous element distribution can be achieved after milling for 12 h. The disintegration of the composite powder particles occurs at 24 h and reaches the balance of welding and fracturing after 36 h. The oxygen content increases sharply with the disintegration of powder particles due to the absorption of oxygen at the solid/gas interface from the milling atmosphere, which is the main source of extra oxygen in the milled powder. Grain refinement down to nanometer level occurs due to the severe plastic deformation of particles; however, the grain size does not change much with further disintegration of particles. The hardness increases with milling time and then becomes stable during further milling. The study indicates that the addition of iron oxide and hydrides may be more beneficial for the dispersion and homogenization of chemical compositions in the powder mixture, thus shortening the mechanical alloying process.

One acceptance criteria for hydride bed waste disposal is that the material inside the bed not be pyrophoric. To determine the pyrophoric nature of spent metal hydride beds, controlled air ingress tests were performed.

The TiF 3 -catalyzed MgH 2 powder demonstrated excellent hydrogen storage kinetics at various temperatures, whereas the uncatalyzed MgH 2 showed significant degradation in both kinetics and capacity. TEM analysis on the partially hydrogen absorbed and partially desorbed pure Mg(MgH 2) revealed a large fraction of particles that were either not transformed at all or were completely transformed. On the other hand, in the MgH 2 +TiF 3 system it was much easier to identify regions with both the hydride and the metal phase coexisting in the same particle.
