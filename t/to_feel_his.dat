5|$|Flashbacks {{throughout}} the episode show the attempts {{of a teenage}} Dexter (Devon Graye) <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>his</b> heart pound. At {{the end of the}} episode, Debra turns on the television in Dexter's apartment and shows him the news: a team of scuba divers in Biscayne Bay has uncovered over 30 garbage bags, each containing parts of Dexter's mutilated victims. As he watches, his heart races.|$|E
5|$|Tauranac, an {{engineer}} at heart, started <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>his</b> Formula One budget of around £100,000 was a gamble {{he could not}} afford to take on his own and began to look around for an experienced business partner. He sold the company for £100,000 at the end of 1971 to British businessman Bernie Ecclestone, Rindt's former manager and erstwhile owner of the Connaught team. Tauranac stayed on to design the cars and run the factory.|$|E
5|$|Kikuta {{was born}} in Aichi Prefecture, Japan. He first became {{interested}} in music {{at the age of}} ten after hearing songs by Emerson, Lake & Palmer. He began writing his own songs two years later, after listening to country blues music; it inspired him to study acoustic guitar and write his own songs in hope of one day becoming a singer/songwriter. He was also inspired as a child by music from movies. It was not until he got a synthesizer, however, that he began <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>his</b> potential as a composer. Kikuta went on to earn an interdisciplinary degree in Religious Studies, Philosophy, and Cultural Anthropology from Kansai University, which he attended from 1981 to 1984. He never received any form of formal musical training, and instead taught himself by reading music theory books and listening {{to a wide variety of}} musical genres.|$|E

5|$|Most men {{typically}} just {{wear the}} towel provided. According to bathhouse etiquette, {{it is perfectly}} acceptable, even friendly, to put one's hand under someone else's towel <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>his</b> penis, which, if well received, {{is the first step}} in sexual intimacy. Some bathhouses permit and others not only permit but encourage total nudity. In some bathhouses nudity is forbidden in the common areas of the establishments. Some men may wear underwear or fetish-wear, but it is unusual for customers to remain fully or even partially dressed in street clothes. Bare feet are customary, though some men prefer to wear flip flops or sandals, sometimes provided by the establishment, for foot protection. The room or locker key is usually suspended from an elastic band which can be worn around the wrist or ankle.|$|E
25|$|In fall 2003, Nadeau began {{discussions with}} MB2 Motorsports boss Jay Frye about a {{long-term}} comeback. Frye gave Nadeau a test at Concord Speedway, {{where he was}} unable <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>his</b> car's brake pedal. He also suffered a loss of stamina during this test. Because {{of the effects of}} his accident, Nadeau had to learn to walk. He also experienced slurred speech. He undertook physical therapy five times during the week. This was later reduced to three when his condition improved. While Nadeau received a small financial settlement from NASCAR, it was not enough to pay for all of his rehabilitation, so he sold his large house near Lake Norman and moved to Davidson, North Carolina. He also suffered from depression caused by the loss of his racing career.|$|E
2500|$|Parker {{delivered}} one especially popular sermon twenty-five {{times between}} 1838 and 1841. In it, he argued against the popular notion that religion {{could be reduced}} to morality. “The principle of morality is obedience to the Law of con,” he wrote, while religion required more: that we “feel naturally, allegiance to a superior Being: dependence on him & accountability to him.” (The theme of dependence echoes Schleiermacher, {{an indication of the}} German influence on his theology.) Morality involves right acting, while religion requires love of God and regular prayer, which Parker considered essential to human life. “No feeling is more deeply planted in human nature than the tendency to adore a superior being,” he preached, “to reverence him, to bow before him, <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>his</b> presence, to pray to him for aid in times of need” and “to bless him when the heart is full of joy.” ...|$|E

2500|$|Gibb {{said he had}} [...] "battled the booze" [...] {{since the}} 1970s. John Lennon {{introduced}} him to his favourite drink, scotch and coke: [...] "If he had given me cyanide, I would have drunk the cyanide, I was so {{in awe of the}} man." [...] With his neighbour Ringo Starr he would go out drinking. [...] It {{got to the point where}} he became unreliable and prior to going onstage would have <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>his</b> way along the wall to get there, according to Barry. One factor in Maurice's recovery was the active intervention of his brothers, who had recently lost their youngest brother Andy. In an interview, Maurice acknowledged that his final years of alcohol abuse had been driven by his failure to reach Andy before his death, and his subsequent guilt. After rehab Maurice started to rediscover his family again, spending quality time with them. To celebrate this, he and Yvonne renewed their wedding vows in 1992. [...] The ceremony was attended not only by many members of their families but many of the friends Gibb made while at the rehabilitation center. Maurice would remain sober until his death.|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{his success}} at {{changing}} the failing studio around, rumors began to circulate in early 1937 that Rogers might be replaced at Universal. In May 1937 Universal's chairman, J. Cheever Cowdin, denied any such move was being contemplated, and praised Rogers {{for the way}} he had reorganized the film company. In September the Universal Board of Directors issued a resolution in support of the studio's management, including Rogers. November 1937 brought the revelation that Rogers had been attempting to secure additional financing for the studio. This was accomplished by replacing studio president Cochrane with Nate J. Blumberg, who had been vice-president in charge of RKO theater operations. As part of the management shake-up, Rogers remained in charge of production. With Blumberg's arrival in January 1938, things began to change at the studio. [...] During the course of meetings during the spring, Rogers began <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>his</b> control over the production end of the studio was being undermined. In May, he requested a special meeting of the Board of Directors to discuss his authority over the production process. As a result of that meeting, Rogers was relieved of his duties as a Universal executive, approximately two years after assuming the position.|$|E
2500|$|Before {{starting}} {{on the trip}} to England in 1887, several of the Indians expressed grave fears that the great waters soon overtake them a bring a horrible death. [...] Red Shirt explained that these fears were caused by a belief prevalent among many tribes of Natives, that if a red man attempted to cross the ocean, soon after beginning his journey he would be seized of a malady that would first prostrate the victim, and then slowly consume his flesh day after day, until at length the very skin itself would drop from his bones, leaving nothing but the skeleton and this even could never find burial. [...] On the day following the departure from New York, the Indians began to grow weary and their stomachs became both treacherous and rebellious. Their fears were now so greatly intensified that even Red Shirt, the bravest of his people, began <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>his</b> flesh {{to see if it}} were really diminishing. [...] Buffalo Bill, [...] "used his utmost endeavors to cheer them up and relieve their forebodings. But for two days nearly the whole company was too sick for any other active service than feeding the fishes, in which I am not proud to say that I performed more than an ordinary share. On the third day, however, we all began to mend so far that I called the Natives together in the main saloon and gave them a Sunday address, as did also Red Shirt, who was now recovered from his anxiety about the future.|$|E

2500|$|Following an April 2008 set visit, Meyer {{opined that}} Pattinson and Stewart had {{developed}} chemistry so good it [...] "may cause hyperventilation". Pattinson revealed that Meyer {{had given him}} an early copy of Midnight Sun—a re-telling {{of the events of}} Twilight, narrated from Edward's point of view. He explained that: [...] "That is what I liked about [...] the job, because the guy doesn’t really exist that much, so you can just create whatever you want. Then, when I found out there was another book from Edward’s perspective, [...] we had the same perspective!" [...] In preparation for the role, Pattinson wrote journal entries as Edward and distanced from his friends and family, explaining that he [...] "wanted <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>his</b> isolation". Physically, he revealed that; [...] "I was supposed to get a six-pack. But it didn't really work out." [...] One scene in the story sees Edward, a gifted pianist, compose a lullaby for Bella. Pattinson was given the opportunity to submit a composition for consideration for this scene, with Hardwicke stating; [...] "I told him he should write one, and let’s see if we can make it work, because that would be really cool if it was Rob’s song. He’s a beautiful musician, a very creative soul, very similar to Edward. He just totally reads the most interesting stuff, and sees the most interesting movies, and is very introspective and diving into his existential self." [...] Meyer approved; [...] "If Robert could write a lullaby, that would definitely add to some of the mystique of the movie, wouldn’t it?" [...] While two of Pattinson's compositions do feature in the final film, the lullaby piece finally selected was composed by Carter Burwell.|$|E
2500|$|In {{lieu of a}} 2009 series, Tennant {{appears as}} the Tenth Doctor, without a regular companion, in several special episodes {{over the course of}} 2008 and 2009, the last of which aired on New Year's Day, 2010. [...] In the Christmas special [...] "The Next Doctor", the Doctor mistakenly {{believes}} he has met a later incarnation of himself in an amnesiac Londoner (David Morrissey), with whom he saves Victorian-era London. [...] "Planet of the Dead" [...] (Easter 2009) features jewel thief Lady Christina de Souza (Michelle Ryan) as the Doctor's one-off companion, and the Doctor is presented with a prophecy of his imminent death. Tennant makes a crossover appearance in a The Sarah Jane Adventures two-parter, The Wedding of Sarah Jane Smith, in which a powerful being known as the Trickster (Paul Marc Davis) also alludes to the Tenth Doctor's impending demise. In [...] "The Waters of Mars", the Doctor tries to alter history and avert the death of one-off companion Adelaide Brooke (Lindsay Duncan); when she commits suicide, he begins <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> <b>his</b> mortality weigh down upon him. In the animated serial Dreamland, the Doctor is joined by two one-off companions in 1950s Roswell, New Mexico. In the two-part send-off The End of Time, the Doctor confronts the Ood about their original prophecy and is led to contemporary Earth where, in the second part, the again-resurrected Master (Simm) restores Gallifrey and the Time Lords to existence, although he redeems himself by assisting the Doctor to defeat Time Lord President Rassilon (Timothy Dalton) before disappearing alongside the other Time Lords. The Doctor sacrifices his life to save Mott, exposing himself to 500,000 rads of deadly radiation and triggering his regeneration. He holds it back and is shown visiting several companions. He gives Donna a winning lottery ticket on her wedding day, buying it with money he borrowed from her late father in the past, saves Martha and Mickey from a Sontaran sniper, saves Sarah Jane's son Luke (Tommy Knight) from a car, introduces Jack to a romantic interest (Russell Tovey), and finally, just before regenerating into the Eleventh Doctor (Matt Smith), he informs Rose in 2005 that she is about to have a [...] "great year". As he begins regenerating once in the TARDIS, his last words are [...] "I don't want to go".|$|E
