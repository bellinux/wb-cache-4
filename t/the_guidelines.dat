40|$|In January 2014 <b>the</b> <b>{{guideline}}</b> ‘Antimicrobials used in dry cow therapy’ (shortened as: guideline dry cow therapy) {{was introduced}} {{with the aim}} of giving tools for implementation of the Dutch legislation on banning prophylactic use of antimicrobials (in dry cow treatment) in daily practice. Because a thorough review of <b>the</b> <b>guideline</b> is important, <b>the</b> aim of this evaluation was to quantify the opinion of veterinarians on <b>the</b> <b>guideline,</b> to identify perceived bottlenecks and to propose possible improvements. To execute the study an online survey was chosen enabling all qualified bovine practitioners (in Dutch: geborgde rundveedierenartsen) to give their opinion on <b>the</b> <b>guideline</b> dry cow therapy. Therefore, the public list of qualified bovine practitioners was used as recipient list. In general, the opinions of bovine practitioners on <b>the</b> <b>guideline</b> dry cow therapy seem to be positive. Veterinarians responded positively to questions on clarity and communication of <b>the</b> <b>guideline</b> and most of them have been informed about <b>the</b> <b>guideline</b> by <b>the</b> communication paths from the KNMvD, which indicates these paths being effective. Besides this, the implementation rates of <b>the</b> <b>guideline</b> in veterinary practices (78 %) and at clients of the veterinarians (76 % implemented <b>the</b> <b>guideline</b> written in <b>the</b> herd treatment plan of 90 - 100 % of their clients) were high. Finally, 65 % of the interviewed practitioners agreed on the fact the cell count cut-off values stated in <b>the</b> <b>guideline</b> are manageable and practicable. Nevertheless, the survey showed there is still some lack of clarity on the exact aim and way of using <b>the</b> <b>guideline,</b> as well as the frequency of evaluating the drying-off strategy. A large majority (84 %) of the respondents has a need for more selection criteria to be included in <b>the</b> <b>guideline</b> dry cow therapy. However, the selection criteria mentioned for integration in <b>the</b> <b>guideline</b> are mainly indicative of prophylactic use of antimicrobials, which makes it is not acceptable to use these in decision making on dry cow therapy. Thereby, veterinarians indicated they evaluated the drying-off procedures with their farmers with very different frequencies (46 % schedules evaluation once per year; 20 % once every six months and 18 % once per quarter). Hence, it is recommended to communicate to the bovine practitioners in the Netherlands what the aim of <b>the</b> <b>guideline</b> is exactly and how <b>the</b> <b>guideline</b> should be interpreted and used to reach that aim. At the same time, there should be communicated <b>the</b> <b>guideline</b> is not designed to be seen as legislation. Taking all results of the survey into consideration, bovine practitioners in the Netherlands are generally pleased with <b>the</b> <b>guideline</b> 'Antimicrobial use in dry cow therapy'.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: An {{evidence-based}} {{clinical practice}} guideline for laryngeal carcinomas {{was introduced in}} the Netherlands late 1999. The objective of this guideline was to ensure uniformity in the diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up. We retrospectively evaluated whether clinical practice changed according to the recommendations of this guideline and whether it succeeded in its aim. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In five out of eight Dutch university hospitals, chart data of 459 patients treated before <b>the</b> <b>guideline</b> introduction were compared to data of 363 patients treated after <b>the</b> <b>guideline</b> introduction. RESULTS: Patient and tumour characteristics were comparable among both groups. In general, <b>the</b> <b>guideline</b> recommendations were properly complied with. The patients treated before <b>the</b> <b>guideline</b> introduction were actually also for a large part already treated according to <b>the</b> <b>guideline's</b> recommendations. After its introduction, several changes according to <b>the</b> <b>guideline</b> were observed: increased rates of reassessment of biopsy samples taken in local hospitals, psychological screening (although still only performed in 10. 5 % of patients), application of accelerated radiotherapy schedules, clinical trial treatments, function-preserving treatments, and decreased rates of total laryngectomy, and annual chest X-rays during follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Although a causal relationship cannot be established in this kind of observational studies, several positive changes were observed after the introduction of <b>the</b> <b>guideline,</b> and therefore <b>the</b> <b>guideline</b> seems to have contributed to more uniformity. The largest changes were seen for <b>the</b> <b>guideline</b> recommendations based on the highest levels of evidence...|$|R

SUMMARY ANSWER: <b>The</b> <b>guideline</b> development group (GDG) formulated 99 recommendations answering 31 key questions on the {{diagnosis and treatment of}} women with POI. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: NA. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: This guideline was produced by a multidisciplinary group of experts in the field using the methodology of the Manual for ESHRE Guideline Development, including a thorough systematic search of the literature, quality assessment of the included papers up to September 2014 and consensus within <b>the</b> <b>guideline</b> group on all recommendations. The GDG included a patient representative to ensure input from women with POI. After finalization of the draft, the European Society for Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE) members and professional organizations were asked to review <b>the</b> <b>guideline.</b> PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: NA. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: <b>The</b> <b>guideline</b> provides 17 recommendations on diagnosis and assessment of POI and 46 recommendations on the different sequelae of POI and their consequences for monitoring and treatment. Furthermore, 24 recommendations were formulated on hormone replacement therapy in women with POI, and two on alternative and complementary treatment. A chapter on puberty induction resulted in five recommendations. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: The main limitation of <b>the</b> <b>guideline</b> is that, {{due to the lack of}} data, many of the recommendations are based on expert opinion or indirect evidence from studies on post-menopausal women or women with Turner Syndrome. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Despite <b>the</b> limitations, <b>the</b> <b>guideline</b> group is confident that this document will be able to guide health care professionals in providing the best practice for managing women with POI given current evidence. Furthermore, <b>the</b> <b>guideline</b> group has formulated research recommendations on the gaps in knowledge identified in the literature searches, in an attempt to stimulate research on the key issues in POI.

40|$|Abstract Background Most {{guidelines}} {{concentrate on}} investigations, treatment, and monitoring instead of patient history and clinical examination. We developed a guideline {{that dealt with}} the different aetiologies of chest pain by emphasizing the patient's history and physical signs. The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate <b>the</b> <b>guideline's</b> acceptance and feasibility in the context of a practice test. Methods The evaluation study was nested in a diagnostic cross-sectional study with 56 General Practitioners (GPs) and 862 consecutively recruited patients with chest pain. The evaluation of <b>the</b> <b>guideline</b> was conducted in a mixed method design on a sub-sample of 17 GPs and 282 patients. Physicians' evaluation of <b>the</b> <b>guideline</b> was assessed via standardized questionnaires and case record forms. Additionally, practice nursing staff and selected patients were asked for their evaluation of specific guideline modules. Quantitative data was analyzed descriptively for frequencies, means, and standard deviations. In addition, two focus groups with a total of 10 GPs were held to gain further insights in <b>the</b> <b>guideline</b> implementation process. <b>The</b> data analysis and interpretation followed the standards of the qualitative content analysis. Results The overall evaluation of the GPs participating in the evaluation study regarding the recommendations made in <b>the</b> chest pain <b>guideline</b> was positive. A total of 14 GPs were convinced that there was a need for this kind of <b>guideline</b> and perceived <b>the</b> <b>guideline</b> recommendations as useful. While the long version was partially criticized for a perceived lack of clarity, the short version of <b>the</b> chest pain <b>guideline</b> and <b>the</b> heart score were especially appreciated by the GPs. However, change of clinical behaviour as consequence of <b>the</b> <b>guideline</b> was inconsistent. While on a concrete patient related level, GPs indicated to have behaved as <b>the</b> <b>guideline</b> recommended, <b>the</b> feedback on a more general level was heterogeneous. Several suggestions to improve guideline implementation were made by participating physicians. Due to the small number of practice nursing staff evaluating the flowchart and patients remembering the patient leaflet, no valid results regarding the flowchart and patient leaflet modules could be reported. Conclusions Overall, the participating GPs perceived <b>the</b> <b>guideline</b> recommendations as useful to increase awareness and to reflect on diagnostic issues. Although behaviour change in consequence of <b>the</b> <b>guideline</b> was not reported on a general level, guidelines on history taking and the clinical examination may serve an important conservative and practical function in a technology driven environment.
