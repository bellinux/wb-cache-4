40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of non-linear finite element analyses on two types of improved steel moment-resisting connections, either reinforced with cover plates or weakened with RBS detail: the aim is to protect the potentially vulnerable beam-to-column groove welded joint by relocating the plastic hinge away {{from the face of the}} column. The investigation is based on results from experimental tests carried out on a two-storey steel frame tested at Ispra and involves the modeling of the 3 -way beam-to-column joints. Numerical analyses on reinforced joints show that fracture indices decrease in the weld region and near the weld access hole respect to the unreinforced connection, but high values of the Triaxiality Index are registered in the weld at the column interface. In order to eliminate the high shear stress in <b>the</b> <b>beam</b> <b>flange</b> and to reduce the high triaxial stress condition at the beam flange-column flange interface, <b>the</b> <b>beam</b> <b>flange</b> was disconnected from the column flange.

40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of using reduced flange plates (RFPs) or rib plates for seismic response of steel moment connections was investigated through cyclic testing of six full-scale specimens. The first scheme utilized RFPs {{to connect the}} beam flanges to the column, without any direct connection of <b>the</b> <b>beam</b> <b>flange</b> to the column. Plastic hinges were forced to form in the RFPs instead of the steel beam due to strong beam-weak RFPs, so the weakened moment connection eliminated buckling of the beam and reduced cost of repairing after earthquakes. The second scheme was to strengthen a connection, which was removed from an existing 33 -story steel building, by welding rib plates between the column face and inner side of the beam flanges. Test results of the weakened connections showed that (1) the connections developed beam plastic moment and reach more than an interstory drift of 4 % without strength degradation, (2) the RFP was effective in dissipating energy before buckling, and (3) no buckling of the beam was observed. Test results of the strengthened connection showed that the rib plates significantly reduced <b>the</b> <b>beam</b> <b>flange</b> strain by 75 % compared to a non-retrofitted steel moment connection.

40|$|Beams having high {{flexural}} stiffnesses can {{be utilized}} {{to reduce the}} building drifts to conform within the code requirements. However the large flexural capacities of the beam will increase strength demand of the connection. To avoid the plastic hinges at the connections, the beam-column connections should be designed based on the maximum possible beam flexural strength which is about (1. 1 - 1. 2) RyMp. If {{the top and bottom}} flanges of the beam are welded directly to the column flange using complete penetration groove welds which have the weld tensile capacity of 0. 9 FyA, the tensile force in <b>the</b> <b>beam</b> <b>flange</b> is potentially greater than the weld tensile capacity so that some reinforcements, such as cover plates or side plates, are required. When RBS connection is chosen, the flange cut near the ends of the beam will reduce Mp and the tensile force in <b>the</b> <b>beam</b> <b>flange</b> will be reduced as well so that the need for coverplates can be eliminated. The span to depth ratio of a deep beam in steel moment resisting frame generally is not large, the interaction between shear and bending moment should be checked {{in the design of the}} beam and the connection. In this paper the design of RBS connection for deep beam to deep column special steel moment resisting frames is doneusing a different approach than the one in the AISC 341 - 05. Experimental and analytical studies have shown that Euler-Bernoulli hypothesis can not be applied at the connection region. Therefore the truss-analogy model will be used to express the flow of the forces at the connection, starting from the face of the column to the centroid of the plastic hinge. Truss-analogy model developed by Arlekar and Murty will be used to design the beam-column connection, coverplate in this model will be eliminated but the vertical rib is kept.
