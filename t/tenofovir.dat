5|$|Antiretroviral {{treatment}} {{among people}} with HIV whose CD4 count ≤ 550 cells/µL is a very effective way to prevent HIV infection of their partner (a strategy known as treatment as prevention, or TASP). TASP {{is associated with a}} 10 to 20 fold reduction in transmission risk. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with a daily dose of the medications <b>tenofovir,</b> with or without emtricitabine, is effective in a number of groups including {{men who have sex with}} men, couples where one is HIV positive, and young heterosexuals in Africa. It may also be effective in intravenous drug users with a study finding a decrease in risk of 0.7 to 0.4 per 100personyears.|$|E
5|$|Consistent {{condom use}} {{reduces the risk}} of HIV {{transmission}} by approximately 80% over the long term. When condoms are used consistently by a couple in which one person is infected, the rate of HIV infection is less than 1% per year. There is some evidence to suggest that female condoms may provide an equivalent level of protection. Application of a vaginal gel containing <b>tenofovir</b> (a reverse transcriptase inhibitor) immediately before sex seems to reduce infection rates by approximately 40% among African women. By contrast, use of the spermicide nonoxynol-9 may increase the risk of transmission due to its tendency to cause vaginal and rectal irritation.|$|E
5|$|The {{infection}} {{has been}} preventable by vaccination since 1982. Vaccination is {{recommended by the}} World Health Organization in {{the first day of}} life if possible. Two or three more doses are required at a later time for full effect. This vaccine works about 95% of the time. About 180 countries gave the vaccine as part of national programs as of 2006. It is also recommended that all blood be tested for hepatitis B before transfusion and condoms be used to prevent infection. During an initial infection, care is based on the symptoms that a person has. In those who develop chronic disease, antiviral medication such as <b>tenofovir</b> or interferon may be useful; however, these drugs are expensive. Liver transplantation is sometimes used for cirrhosis.|$|E
25|$|Taking the AIDS drug <b>tenofovir</b> greatly {{reduces the}} risk of HIV {{infection}} among intravenous drug users, according to a new study.|$|E
25|$|<b>Tenofovir</b> is a {{nucleotide}} analogue and an antiretroviral {{drug that}} {{is also used to}} treat HIV infection. It is preferred to adefovir both in lamivudine-resistant patients and as initial treatment since it is both more potent and less likely to develop resistance.|$|E
25|$|AZT {{has been}} used for {{post-exposure}} prophylaxis (PEP) in combination with another antiretroviral drug called lamivudine. Together they work to substantially reduce the risk of HIV infection following the first single exposure to the virus. More recently, AZT has been replaced by other antiretrovirals such as <b>tenofovir</b> to provide PEP.|$|E
25|$|First-line {{treatments}} {{currently used}} include PEG IFN, entecavir, and <b>tenofovir,</b> subject to patient and physician preference. Treatment initiation {{is guided by}} recommendations issued by The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) {{and is based on}} detectable viral levels, HBeAg positive or negative status, ALT levels, and in certain cases, family history of HCC and liver biopsy. In patients with compensated cirrhosis, treatment is recommended regardless of HBeAg status or ALT level, but recommendations differ regarding HBV DNA levels; AASLD recommends treating at DNA levels detectable above 2x103 IU/mL; EASL and WHO recommend treating when HBV DNA levels are detectable at any level. In patients with decompensated cirrhosis, treatment and evaluation for liver transplantation are recommended in all cases if HBV DNA is detectable. Currently, multidrug treatment is not recommended in treatment of chronic HBV as it is no more effective in the long term than individual treatment with entecavir or <b>tenofovir.</b>|$|E
25|$|In these rare, {{more severe}} acute cases, {{patients}} {{have been successfully}} treated with antiviral therapy {{similar to that used}} in cases of chronic hepatitis B, with nucleoside analogues such as entecavir or <b>tenofovir.</b> As there is a dearth of clinical trial data and the drugs used to treat are prone to developing resistance, experts recommend reserving treatment for severe acute cases, not mild to moderate.|$|E
25|$|As HIV uses reverse {{transcriptase}} to copy its genetic material and generate new viruses (part of a retrovirus proliferation circle), specific drugs {{have been designed}} to disrupt the process and thereby suppress its growth. Collectively, these drugs are known as reverse-transcriptase inhibitors and include the nucleoside and nucleotide analogues zidovudine (trade name Retrovir), lamivudine (Epivir) and <b>tenofovir</b> (Viread), as well as non-nucleoside inhibitors, such as nevirapine (Viramune).|$|E
500|$|In October 2011, [...] the anti-HIV drug <b>tenofovir,</b> {{when used}} topically in a microbicidal vaginal gel, was {{reported}} to reduce herpes virus sexual transmission by 51%.|$|E
500|$|Although {{none of the}} {{available}} drugs can clear the infection, they can stop the virus from replicating, thus minimizing liver damage. As of 2008, there are seven medications licensed {{for the treatment of}} [...] infection in the United States. These include antiviral drugs lamivudine (Epivir), adefovir (Hepsera), <b>tenofovir</b> (Viread), telbivudine (Tyzeka) and entecavir (Baraclude), and the two immune system modulators interferon alpha-2a and PEGylated interferon alpha-2a (Pegasys). In 2015 the World Health Organization recommended <b>tenofovir</b> or entecavir as first-line agents. Those with current cirrhosis are in most need of treatment.|$|E
500|$|Current HAART {{options are}} {{combinations}} (or [...] "cocktails") consisting {{of at least}} three medications belonging to at least two types, or [...] "classes," [...] of antiretroviral agents. Initially treatment is typically a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) plus two nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). Typical NRTIs include: zidovudine (AZT) or <b>tenofovir</b> (TDF) and lamivudine (3TC) or emtricitabine (FTC). Combinations of agents which include protease inhibitors (PI) are used if the above regimen loses effectiveness.|$|E
500|$|Most {{vaccines}} {{are given}} in three doses over a course of months. A protective response to the vaccine is defined as an anti-HBs antibody concentration of [...] at least 10mIU/ml in the recipient's serum. The vaccine is more effective in children and 95 percent of those vaccinated have protective levels of antibody. This drops to around 90% at 40years of age [...] and to around 75 percent in those over 60years. The protection afforded by vaccination is long lasting even after antibody levels fall below 10mIU/ml. Vaccination at birth is recommended for all infants of HBV infected mothers. A combination of hepatitis B immune globulin and an accelerated course of HBV vaccine prevents HBV transmission {{around the time of}} birth in 86% to 99% of cases. <b>Tenofovir</b> given in the second or third trimester can reduce the risk of mother to child transmission by 77% when combined with hepatitis B immunoglobulin and the hepatitis B vaccine, especially for pregnant women with high hepatitis B virus DNA levels.|$|E
2500|$|Rilpivirine is a DAPY {{compound}} like etravirine and {{was discovered}} when further optimization within this family of NNRTIs was conducted. The resistance profile and the genetic {{barrier to the}} development of resistance is comparable to etravirine in vitro. The advantage of rilpivirine over etravirine is a better bioavailability and it is easier to formulate than etravirine. Etravirine has required extensive chemical formulation work due to poor solubility and bioavailability. Rilpivirine was undergoing phase III clinical trials in the end of 2009. Rilpivirine was approved by the FDA for HIV therapy in May 2011 under the brand name Edurant. Edurant is approved for treatment-naive patients with a viral load of 100,000 copies/mL or less at therapy initiation. Its recommended dosage is 25 mg orally once daily with a meal, in combination with other antiretrovirals. [...] It is contraindicated for use with proton pump inhibitors due to the increased gastric pH causing decreased rilpivirine plasma concentrations, potentially resulting in loss of virologic response and possible resistance. A fixed-dose drug combining rilpivirine with emtricitabine and <b>tenofovir</b> disoproxil (TDF), was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in August 2011 under the brand name Complera. A newer fixed-dose drug also combining rilpivirine with emtricitabine and <b>tenofovir</b> alafenamide (TAF) was approved in March 2016 under the brand name Odefsey.|$|E
2500|$|The {{non-human}} primate models of AIDS, using HIV-2, SHIV, and SIV in macaques, {{have been used}} as a complement to ongoing research efforts against the virus. The drug <b>tenofovir</b> has had its efficacy and toxicology evaluated in macaques, and found longterm-highdose treatments had adverse effects not found using short term-high dose treatment followed by long term-low dose treatment. This finding in macaques was translated into human dosing regimens. Prophylactic treatment with anti-virals has been evaluated in macaques, because introduction of the virus can only be controlled in an animal model. The finding that prophylaxis can be effective at blocking infection has altered the treatment for occupational exposures, such as needle exposures. Such exposures are now followed rapidly with anti-HIV drugs, and this practice has resulted in measurable transient virus infection similar to the NHP model. Similarly, the mother-to-fetus transmission, and its fetal prophylaxis with antivirals such as <b>tenofovir</b> and AZT, has been evaluated in controlled testing in macaques not possible in humans, and this knowledge has guided antiviral treatment in pregnant mothers with HIV. [...] "The comparison and correlation of results obtained in monkey and human studies is leading to a growing validation and recognition of the relevance of the animal model. Although each animal model has its limitations, carefully designed drug studies in nonhuman primates can continue to advance our scientific knowledge and guide future clinical trials." ...|$|E
2500|$|Iran has low {{endemicity}} for Hepatitis B {{virus and}} Hepatitis C virus infections {{and there is}} a unique experience of control of these infections that can be presented to people in Middle East countries. The pharmaceutical companies in Iran produces the drugs needed for control of HCV and HBV infection such as <b>Tenofovir</b> disoproxil, Peg Interferon, Sofosbuvir/daclatasvir and Ledipasvir [...] with very low prices and high efficacy.

2500|$|Nucleoside reverse {{transcriptase}} inhibitors (NRTI) and nucleotide {{reverse transcriptase}} inhibitors (NtRTI) are nucleoside and nucleotide analogues which inhibit reverse transcription. [...] HIV is an RNA virus and hence unable to become {{integrated into the}} DNA in {{the nucleus of the}} human cell; it must be [...] "reverse" [...] transcribed into DNA. Since the conversion of RNA to DNA is not done in the mammalian cell it is performed by a viral protein which makes it a selective target for inhibition. NRTIs are chain terminators such that once incorporated, work by preventing other nucleosides from also being incorporated into the DNA chain because of the absence of a 3' OH group. Both act as competitive substrate inhibitors. [...] Examples of currently used NRTIs include zidovudine, abacavir, lamivudine, emtricitabine, and <b>tenofovir.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Tenofovir</b> disoproxil is {{available}} in many fixed-dose combinations with other anti-viral drugs. Well known combinations include Atripla (<b>tenofovir</b> disoproxil/emtricitabine/efavirenz), Complera (<b>tenofovir</b> disoproxil/emtricitabine/rilpivirine), Stribild (<b>tenofovir</b> disoproxil, emtricitabine/elviegravir/cobicistat), and Truvada (<b>tenofovir</b> disoproxil/emtricitabine).|$|E
50|$|<b>Tenofovir</b> disoproxil is a prodrug that {{is quickly}} absorbed from the gut and cleaved to release <b>tenofovir.</b> Inside cells, <b>tenofovir</b> is {{phosphorylated}} to <b>tenofovir</b> diphosphate (which {{is actually a}} triphosphate, as <b>tenofovir</b> itself already has one phosphate residue), the active compound that inhibits reverse transcriptase via chain termination.|$|E
50|$|The coadministration of <b>tenofovir</b> and lopinavir/ritonavir {{increases}} {{the concentration of}} <b>tenofovir</b> and must be monitored for <b>tenofovir</b> toxicity.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tenofovir</b> {{interacts with}} {{didanosine}} and HIV-1 protease inhibitors. <b>Tenofovir</b> increases didanosine concentrations and {{can result in}} adverse effects such as pancreatitis and neuropathy. <b>Tenofovir</b> also interacts with HIV-1 protease inhibitors such as atazanavir, by decreasing atazanavir concentrations while increasing <b>tenofovir</b> concentrations. In addition, since <b>tenofovir</b> is excreted by the kidney, medications that impair renal function can also cause problems.|$|E
50|$|Nucleotide analogues {{require only}} two {{phosphorylation}} steps whereas nucleoside analogues require three steps. Reduction in the phosphorylation requirement may allow more rapid and complete conversion of drugs to their active metabolites. Such considerations {{have led to}} the development of phosphonate nucleotide analogues such as <b>tenofovir.</b> <b>Tenofovir</b> disoproxil fumarate (<b>Tenofovir</b> DF) is the prodrug of <b>tenofovir.</b> <b>Tenofovir</b> is an acyclic adenosine derivative. The acyclic nature of the compound and its phosphonate moiety are unique structural features among the approved NRTIs. <b>Tenofovir</b> DF is hydrolyzed enzymatically to <b>tenofovir</b> which exhibits anti-HIV activity. It was developed by the synthesis and broad spectrum antiviral activity of 2,3-dihydroxypropyladenine. <b>Tenofovir</b> DF was the first nucleotide reverse-transcriptase inhibitor approved by the FDA for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in October 2001.|$|E
5000|$|The initial form of <b>tenofovir</b> used {{in these}} studies had limited {{potential}} for widespread use {{because it was not}} absorbed when administered orally. A medicinal chemistry team at Gilead developed a modified version of <b>tenofovir,</b> <b>tenofovir</b> disoproxil. This version of <b>tenofovir</b> is often referred to simply as [...] "tenofovir". In this version of the drug, the two negative charges of the <b>tenofovir</b> phosphonic acid group are masked, thus enhancing oral absorption.|$|E
50|$|Gilead {{has created}} a second pro-drug form of the active drug <b>tenofovir</b> {{diphosphate}} called <b>Tenofovir</b> Alafenamide. <b>Tenofovir</b> Alafenamide differs from <b>tenofovir</b> disoproxil due to its activation in the lymphoid cells. This allows the active metabolites to accumulate in the lymphoid cells leading to lower systemic exposure and its potential toxicities.|$|E
50|$|The coadministration of <b>tenofovir</b> and atazanavir {{results in}} {{decreased}} concentrations of atazanavir and increased concentrations of <b>tenofovir.</b> Atazanavir {{may be taken}} with Truvada only with ritonavir and must be monitored for <b>tenofovir</b> toxicity.|$|E

50|$|<b>Tenofovir</b> disoproxil is {{available}} by mouth and is sold under {{the brand name}} Viread among others. <b>Tenofovir</b> disoproxil is a pro-drug form of <b>tenofovir</b> disphophate. It is marketed by Gilead Sciences (as the fumarate, abbreviated TDF).|$|E
5000|$|<b>Tenofovir</b> disoproxil fumarate is an anti-HIV drug (NtRTI class) that is bioactivated to <b>tenofovir</b> (PMPA).|$|E
50|$|<b>Tenofovir</b> {{has been}} studied as a topical antiretroviral. One example of a <b>tenofovir</b> study is CAPRISA 004.|$|E
50|$|In {{combination}} studies {{there were}} synergistic antiviral effects observed between emtricitabine and efavirenz, efavirenz and <b>tenofovir,</b> and emtricitabine and <b>tenofovir.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Tenofovir</b> disoproxil is {{used for}} HIV-1 {{infection}} and chronic hepatitis B treatment. For HIV-1 infection, <b>tenofovir</b> is indicated {{in combination with other}} antiretroviral agents for people 2 years of age and older. For chronic hepatitis B patients, <b>tenofovir</b> is indicated for patients 12 years of age and older.|$|E
50|$|RMP-02/MTN-006 Tested {{the same}} vaginal {{formulation}} of <b>tenofovir</b> gel that reduced HIV acquisition by an estimated 39 percent {{overall in the}} CAPRISA (Centre for the AIDS Programme of Research) 004 trial that was conducted in South Africa. In September 2009, 18 men and women began enrolling in the trial, which {{was sponsored by the}} Microbicide Trials Network (MTN) and UCLA’s Microbicide Development Program. The study tested the safety and acceptability of single- and multiple-day rectal applications of <b>tenofovir,</b> a single oral dose of <b>tenofovir,</b> and a placebo. Laboratory tests showed that HIV was significantly inhibited in rectal tissue samples from participants who applied <b>tenofovir</b> gel to their rectums daily for one week compared to tissue from those who used a placebo gel. Although a slight anti-HIV effect was noted in tissue from participants who applied a single dose of <b>tenofovir</b> gel, the finding was not statistically significant. The single dose of oral <b>tenofovir</b> did not provide any protection against HIV in rectal tissue samples. The study also discovered that only 25 percent of the participants liked <b>tenofovir</b> gel, compared to 50 percent who had used the placebo gel. Some individuals who used <b>tenofovir</b> gel experienced gastrointestinal distress, cramps, and diarrhea. Results were presented at the 18th Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections, or CROI.|$|E
50|$|Long term use of <b>tenofovir</b> disoproxil is {{associated}} with nephrotoxicity and bone loss. Presentation of nephrotoxicity can appear as Fanconi syndrome, acute kidney injury, or decline of glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Discontinuation of <b>tenofovir</b> disoproxil can potentially lead to reversal of renal impairment. Nephrotoxicity {{may be due to}} proximal tubules accumulation of <b>Tenofovir</b> disoproxil leading to elevated serum concentrations.|$|E
50|$|Martin {{focuses on}} the {{development}} of antiviral therapeutics. He has helped to develop drugs including ganciclovir, cidofovir, oseltamivir, adefovir, <b>tenofovir,</b> didanosine, stavudine, <b>tenofovir,</b> emtricitabine, Truvada, Atripla, Complera, Stribild and Sofosbuvir.|$|E
