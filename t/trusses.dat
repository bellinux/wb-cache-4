5|$|The bridge's {{fourteen}} spans extended 1,907feet (580m) long. The {{three main}} spans were of deck truss construction while {{all but two}} of the eleven approach spans were steel multi-girder construction, the two exceptions being concrete slab construction. The piers were not built in the navigation channel; instead, the center span of the bridge consisted of a single 458-foot (140m) steel arched truss over the 390-foot (119m) channel. The two support piers for the main <b>trusses,</b> each with two load-bearing concrete pylons at either side of the center main span, were located on opposite banks of the river. The center span was connected to the north and south approaches by shorter spans formed by the same main <b>trusses.</b> Each was 266feet (81m) in length, and was connected to the approach spans by a 38foot (11.6m) cantilever. The two main <b>trusses,</b> one on either side, ranged in depth from 60feet (18.3m) above their pier and concrete pylon supports, to 36feet (11m) at midspan on the central span and 30feet (9m) deep at the outer ends of the adjoining spans. At the top of the main <b>trusses</b> were the deck <b>trusses,</b> 12feet (3.6m) in depth and integral with the main <b>trusses.</b> The transverse deck beams, part of the deck truss, rested on top of the main <b>trusses.</b> These deck beams supported longitudinal deck stringers 27inches (69cm) in depth, and reinforced-concrete pavement. The deck was 113ft 4in (34.5m) in breadth and was split longitudinally. It had transverse expansion joints at the centers and ends of each of the three main spans. The roadway deck was approximately 115feet (35m) above the water level.|$|E
5|$|The rig {{consisted}} of a Front of House truss, two three-quarter angled <b>trusses,</b> and two straight mid-stage <b>trusses.</b> These were all located up-stage, and had two sub-hung <b>trusses</b> directly below them. There were two Lycian Starklite medium-throw truss spots, and an accumulation of specialty lights. The specialty lights included 54 two-light Molefays, six PAR 36 rotating beacons, 24 Martin Atomic 300 Strobes, 2 six-light Molefays, and 10 four-light Molefays. The rig also had LED units, which can be very bright, and which shone into the audience. Throughout the tour, 65 Philips Color Kinetics ColorBlast 12s, seven Color Blaze 48s, and twelve CK ColorBlaze 72s were used to light up {{the wall behind the}} band.|$|E
5|$|The two-tier {{steel frame}} and wooden floor Bullens Road Stand, {{designed}} by Archibald Leitch, {{was completed in}} 1926. The upper tier was seated, with terracing below, {{a part of the}} ground called The Paddock. Few changes were made until 1963 when the rear of the Paddock was seated and an overhanging roof was added. The stand is known for Archibald Leitch's highly distinctive balcony <b>trusses</b> which also act as handrails for the front row of seats in the Upper Bullens stand. Goodison Park is the only stadium with two complete <b>trusses</b> designed by Leitch. Of the 17 created, only Goodison Park, Ibrox and Fratton Park retain these <b>trusses.</b>|$|E

5|$|The bridge's Whipple <b>truss</b> {{technology}} {{was developed by}} civil engineer Squire Whipple in 1847. J. W. Murphy further modified Whipple's <b>truss</b> design in 1859 by designing the first <b>truss</b> bridge with pinned eyebar connections. The design of the Capon Lake Whipple <b>Truss</b> Bridge incorporates Murphy's later modifications with double-intersections and horizontal chords, and is therefore considered a Whipple–Murphy <b>truss</b> bridge. The Capon Lake Whipple <b>Truss</b> Bridge is West Virginia's oldest remaining example of a Whipple <b>truss</b> bridge and its oldest extant metal <b>truss</b> bridge.|$|R

5|$|Inside Cloud Gates {{polished}} exterior shell {{are several}} steel structures {{that keep the}} sculpture standing. The first structural pieces, two type 304 stainless steel rings, were put into place in February 2004. As construction continued, crisscrossing pipe <b>trusses</b> were assembled between the two rings. The <b>trusses</b> and supporting structures were only present for the construction phases. The finished sculpture has no inner bracing. The supporting structural components were designed and constructed {{to ensure that no}} specific point was overloaded, and to avoid producing unwanted indentations on the exterior shell. The frame was also designed to expand and contract with the sculpture as temperatures fluctuate. As a result, the two large rings supporting the sculpture move independently of each other, allowing the shell to move independently of the rings.|$|E
5|$|Maxwell {{helped develop}} the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution, a {{statistical}} means of describing aspects of the kinetic theory of gases. He is also known for presenting the first durable colour photograph in 1861 and for his foundational work on analysing the rigidity of rod-and-joint frameworks (<b>trusses)</b> like those in many bridges.|$|E
5|$|The bridge {{consists}} of two spans, 64.1 feet and 81.10 feet, with a 3.2 feet gap between them. The combined trussed portions of the bridge are 149.1 feet long. The bridge's Town lattice is an unusual design choice, but the later addition of the queen <b>trusses</b> are also unusual, resulting in a unique visual appearance by the bridge's unequal spans. This gives the appearance of kingposts within the queenposts. Since {{the addition of the}} steel I-beam flooring in 1973, the <b>trusses</b> have supported nothing but themselves. The State of Connecticut's lists the bridge as CT 1338 and the May 2012 inspection of the bridge found the deck and superstructure conditions to be satisfactory and condition of the substructure to be fair. The West Cornwall Covered bridge has been appraised as functionally obsolete.|$|E
50|$|The <b>truss</b> {{may carry}} its roadbed on top, in the middle, {{or at the}} bottom of the <b>truss.</b> Bridges with the roadbed at the top or the bottom are the most common as this allows both the top and bottom to be stiffened, forming a box <b>truss.</b> When the roadbed is atop the <b>truss</b> it is called a deck <b>truss</b> (an example of this was the I-35W Mississippi River bridge). When the <b>truss</b> members are both above and below the roadbed it is called a through <b>truss</b> (an example of this {{application}} is the Pulaski Skyway), and where the sides extend above the roadbed but are not connected, a pony <b>truss</b> or half-through <b>truss.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Pratt <b>truss</b> {{bridge was}} invented in 1844 by Thomas and Caleb Pratt. A Pratt <b>truss</b> has {{vertical}} members and diagonals that slope down towards the center. The interior diagonals are under tension, and the vertical elements are under compression. Pratt <b>truss</b> bridges were the preferred design for medium-span vehicular bridges during {{the late nineteenth and}} early twentieth centuries. A <b>truss</b> bridge can carry the roadbed on top, in the middle, or underneath the <b>truss.</b> Bridges with the roadbed at the top or the bottom are the most common as this allows both the top and bottom to be stiffened, forming a box <b>truss.</b> When the roadbed is atop the <b>truss</b> it is called a deck <b>truss.</b> The AJX Bridge is a deck <b>truss</b> bridge, since the roadway is on top of the <b>truss.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{geometry}} investigated most intensively was {{the triangular}} tetrahedral <b>truss.</b> A square type <b>truss</b> {{having the same}} topology was also investigated. The tetrahedral <b>truss</b> is composed of surface struts and core members. In the deployable form, the entire <b>truss</b> is viewed as being {{made up of a}} number of parallel <b>truss</b> ribs connected to each other by interrib struts and members. The packaging efficiency of the <b>truss</b> was evaluated...|$|R
5|$|The two Amtrak tracks {{share an}} island platform; the RTA tracks {{do not have}} any platforms. The {{structure}} has a porte-cochère, which protects passengers from inclement weather. The interior was built with a similar design to that of the exterior, and features a central skylight. Shadows from its exposed <b>trusses</b> create different patterns on the brown brick floor, built in a basket-weaved pattern. Exposed ductwork is visible throughout the <b>trusses,</b> as are the light fixtures. All of the ceiling elements are painted white, which tend to recede and produce a sense of airiness which is further enhanced by the floor-to-ceiling windows. Banks of seats are located close to public telephones and a vending area.|$|E
5|$|A {{shipping}} and receiving ramp, which served the entire World Trade Center complex, occupied the eastern {{quarter of the}} 7World Trade Center footprint. The building was open below the 3rd floor, providing space for truck clearance on the shipping ramp. The spray-on fireproofing for structural steel elements was gypsum-based Monokote, which had a two-hour fire rating for steel beams, girders and <b>trusses,</b> and a three-hour rating for columns.|$|E
5|$|AMiBA was {{initially}} configured as a 7-element interferometer, using 0.576m Cassegrain dishes {{mounted on a}} 6m carbon fibre hexapod mount. It is located on Mauna Loa, Hawaii, and observes at 3mm (86–102GHz) to minimize foreground emission from other, non-thermal sources. The telescope has a retractable shelter, made from seven steel <b>trusses</b> and PVC fabric.|$|E
50|$|The terms closed <b>truss</b> {{and open}} <b>truss</b> {{are used in}} two ways to {{describe}} characteristics of <b>truss</b> roofs. Closed truss: 1) A <b>truss</b> with a tie beam; 2) a roof system with a ceiling so the framing is not visible. Open truss: 1) A <b>truss</b> with an interrupted tie beam or scissor <b>truss</b> which allow a vaulted ceiling area; 2) Roof framing open to view, not hidden by a ceiling.|$|R
5000|$|A Post <b>truss</b> is {{a hybrid}} between a Warren <b>truss</b> and a double-intersection Pratt <b>truss.</b> Invented in 1863 by Simeon S. Post, it is {{occasionally}} {{referred to as}} a Post patent <b>truss</b> although he never received a patent for it. [...] The Ponakin Bridge and the Bell Ford Bridge are two examples of this <b>truss.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The bowstring arch through <b>truss</b> {{bridge was}} {{patented}} in 1841 by Squire Whipple. [...] While similar in appearance to a tied-arch bridge, a bowstring <b>truss</b> is a <b>truss</b> and thus has diagonal load-bearing members. These diagonals {{result in a}} structure that more closely matches a Parker <b>truss</b> or Pratt <b>truss</b> than a true arch.|$|R
5|$|More than 930,000policyholders in South Florida lost {{coverage}} after 11insurance companies went bankrupt, {{caused by}} more than 600,000insurance claims filed. This led the Florida Legislature to create new entities, such as the Joint Underwriting Association, the Florida Windstorm Underwriting Association, and the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund, {{in an effort to}} restore adequate insurance capacity. Stricter building codes were created in Florida in the aftermath of Hurricane Andrew. A survey by Tim Marshall and Richard Herzog of the Haag Engineer Company in Carrollton, Texas, highlighted several construction issues. On the roof of some homes, the concrete tiles were glued to felt paper, which could easily be ripped by straight line winds. At houses with shingled roofs, it was found that some of the shingles were stapled perpendicular to the long axis, also allowing them to be torn away. After the tiles or shingles were peeled off, the plywood and prefabricated <b>trusses</b> were exposed to the weather. Eventually, the plywood and the <b>trusses</b> suffered structural failure, leading to roof collapses.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} is formed by a composite steel and concrete frame, with various setbacks in its profile, meaning {{the upper floors}} are much smaller in area than lower levels. Outrigger <b>trusses</b> {{at the top of}} the building and at the various setbacks help to stiffen the building's reinforced concrete core against the strong winds prevalent in the area. The base of the building features a small park, for which the tower is named.|$|E
5|$|The {{roof was}} {{originally}} thatched {{but now is}} tiled, and is supported by cruck bracing to the timber frame of six principal <b>trusses.</b> The design of the roof {{is similar to that}} in the other tithe barns of Glastonbury Abbey at Pilton, Manor Farm, Doulting and Glastonbury itself, which is now part of the Somerset Rural Life Museum. The carriage porch where wagons would have been unloaded is covered by the sloping roof.|$|E

5|$|A {{survey in}} 1932 {{found that the}} roof was cracked and it {{eventually}} collapsed in 1935. In 1936 the roof structure was straightened, preserving the medieval <b>trusses</b> where possible, and covered with clay tiles. The restoration was undertaken by the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings, with the work being funded by Roger Clark of the local shoemakers C. & J. Clark who bought the derelict barn for £5. It has been owned by the National Trust since 1938. Designation as a Grade I listed building first took place in 1961. A survey in 2002 found minor repairs were needed to the doors and wall plate.|$|E
5|$|The present bridge {{dates from}} 1842. The bridge was {{constructed}} with a Town lattice, patented by Ithiel Town who {{is said to}} have supervised the construction of the bridge. If accurate, Town would have supervised the construction of the current bridge in the years preceding his death. The bridge has vertical planking and the seams are covered by battens and the roof of the structure has wood shingles. A lot of the joinery has been preserved, though the queen-post <b>trusses</b> around the Town lattices are not original.|$|E
40|$|Future {{space science}} {{missions}} {{are likely to}} require near-optical quality reflectors which are supported by a stiff <b>truss</b> structure. This support <b>truss</b> should conform closely with its intended shape to minimize its contribution to the overall surface error of the reflector. The current investigation was conducted to evaluate the planar surface accuracy of a regular tetrahedral <b>truss</b> structure {{by comparing the results}} of predicted and measured node locations. The <b>truss</b> is a 2 -ring hexagonal structure composed of 102 equal-length <b>truss</b> members. Each <b>truss</b> member is nominally 2 meters in length between node centers and is comprised of a graphite/epoxy tube with aluminum nodes and joints. The axial stiffness and the length variation of the <b>truss</b> components were determined experimentally and incorporated into a static finite element analysis of the <b>truss.</b> From this analysis, the root mean square (RMS) surface error of the <b>truss</b> was predicted to be 0. 11 mm (0004 in). Photogrammetry tests were performed on the assembled <b>truss</b> to measure the normal displacements of the upper surface nodes and to determine if the <b>truss</b> would maintain its intended shape when subjected to repeated assembly. Considering the variation in the <b>truss</b> component lengths, the measures rms error of 0. 14 mm (0. 006 in) in the assembled <b>truss</b> is relatively small. The test results also indicate that a repeatable <b>truss</b> surface is achievable. Several potential sources of error were identified and discussed...|$|R
40|$|A three-bay, space, {{cantilever}} <b>truss</b> is probabilistically evaluated {{to describe}} progressive buckling and <b>truss</b> collapse {{in view of}} the numerous uncertainties associated with the structural, material, and load variables (primitive variables) that describe the <b>truss.</b> Initially, the <b>truss</b> is deterministically analyzed for member forces, and member(s) in which the axial force exceeds the Euler buckling load are identified. These member(s) are then discretized with several intermediate nodes and a probabilistic buckling analysis is performed on the <b>truss</b> to obtain its probabilistic buckling loads and respective mode shapes. Furthermore, sensitivities associated with the uncertainties in the primitive variables are investigated, margin of safety values for the <b>truss</b> are determined, and <b>truss</b> end node displacements are noted. These steps are repeated by sequentially removing the buckled member(s) until onset of <b>truss</b> collapse is reached. Results show that this procedure yields an optimum <b>truss</b> configuration for a given loading and for a specified reliability...|$|R

5|$|The spans were {{assembled}} on site. Staging {{was laid}} and rails {{put in place}} to carry a travelling crane. The long beams were hoisted in place first, followed by the vertical bracings, and then the outer and inner plates of the top chordal <b>trusses</b> and the diagonals. The whole structure was bolted together at first, and later riveted by blacksmiths using hand-operated forges. Some individual spans were completed within a week, with contractors being complimented on the efficiency of their work.|$|E
5|$|The {{structural}} {{framework of}} the building utilises a simple system of reinforced concrete beams and slabs, and was originally clad in square mosaic and rectangular ceramic tiles on its walls and columns. The building's foundation comprises large diameter bored piles installed in decomposed sandstone. Beams span an average 7.6 metres except at the main entrance where post-tensioned concrete beams span 15 metres. The auditorium is roofed over by 24-metre long steel <b>trusses</b> with a composite reinforced concrete covering.|$|E
