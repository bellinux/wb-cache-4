25|$|Powell was {{mentioned}} as a potential candidate in the 2000 U.S. presidential election, but decided against running.

Bush eventually won, and Powell was appointed Secretary of State.|$|E
25|$|Overall, {{the city}} {{is a blend of}} {{downtown}} liberalism and suburban conservatism but leans to the political left as a whole. The city last went to a Republican candidate in 2000 when former <b>Texas</b> <b>Governor</b> <b>George</b> <b>W.</b> <b>Bush</b> successfully ran for President. In 2004, the Democrats rebounded strongly as John Kerry enjoyed a 14.0% margin over Bush, who once again won Texas.|$|E

[...] Perry appointed Oakley for the 79th legislative session to the rock crushers and quarries advisory committee and then in 2009 to the Texas Commission on Law Enforcement (TCOLE) for an eight-year term. [...] TCOLE's mission is [...] "ensuring a Texas where people are served by highly trained and ethical law enforcement and corrections personnel through screening, developing, monitoring resources, and setting standards." ...|$|R

50|$|The 1998 Texas gubernatorial {{election}} {{was held on}} November 3, 1998 to elect the <b>Governor</b> of <b>Texas.</b> Incumbent Republican <b>Governor</b> <b>George</b> <b>W.</b> Bush was re-elected in a landslide over 4-term Democrat Texas Land Commissioner Garry Mauro, winning 68% of the vote to Mauro's 31%. Bush's 37% margin of victory was the largest won by any candidate since 1966 and is, to date, the largest ever won by a Republican candidate.|$|R
25|$|After several recounts were {{inconclusive}} and {{the laws}} governing recounts were unclear, Harris halted the recounting process. She certified that the Republican candidate, <b>Texas</b> <b>Governor</b> <b>George</b> <b>W.</b> <b>Bush,</b> had defeated the Democratic candidate, Vice President Al Gore, in the popular vote of Florida and thus certified the Republican slate of electors. This victory in Florida allowed Bush to win the election. Her ruling was upheld in the state circuit court, but was subsequently overturned on appeal by the Florida Supreme Court.|$|E
500|$|McCain {{announced}} his candidacy for president on September 27, 1999, in Nashua, New Hampshire, {{saying he was}} staging [...] "a fight to take our government back from the power brokers and special interests, {{and return it to}} the people and the noble cause of freedom it was created to serve". The frontrunner for the Republican nomination was <b>Texas</b> <b>Governor</b> <b>George</b> <b>W.</b> <b>Bush,</b> who had the political and financial support of most of the party establishment.|$|E
500|$|On April 12, 1995, {{two weeks}} after Selena's death, <b>Texas</b> <b>governor</b> <b>George</b> <b>W.</b> <b>Bush</b> {{declared}} her birthday Selena Day in Texas. Bush said Selena represented [...] "the essence of south Texas culture".

On the same day, a crowd of three thousand attended an organized mass of the resurrection for Selena at Johnnyland Concert Park.|$|E
50|$|Though Republicans won a {{relatively}} modest midterm victory, the election {{set the stage}} for the Reagan Revolution. Many of the newly elected members of Congress were more conservative than their predecessors, and most supported tax cuts that would eventually be implemented in the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981. The election also ended the possibility of a ratification of the SALT II treaty with the Soviet Union. Carter's move to the center after this election encouraged a 1980 Democratic primary challenge by Massachusetts Senator Ted Kennedy. Future <b>Texas</b> <b>governor</b> and president <b>George</b> <b>W.</b> Bush ran for a House seat as the Republican nominee in his state's 19th congressional district, but lost.|$|R

500|$|McCain was {{the main}} {{challenger}} to <b>Texas</b> <b>Governor</b> <b>George</b> <b>W.</b> <b>Bush,</b> who had the political and financial support {{of most of the}} party establishment. [...] McCain staged an upset win in the February 2000 New Hampshire primary, capitalizing on a message of political reform and [...] "straight talk" [...] that appealed to moderate Republican and independent voters and to the press. [...] McCain's momentum was halted when Bush won the South Carolina primary later that month, in a contest that became famous for its bitter nature and an underground smear campaign run against McCain.|$|E
500|$|Rove, {{while an}} advisor to <b>Texas</b> <b>Governor</b> <b>George</b> <b>W.</b> <b>Bush</b> during the 2000 {{election}} campaign, often {{spoke of the}} parallels he saw between McKinley and his 1896 campaign, and the 2000 election, {{going so far as}} to fax copies of books on McKinley. The media took the parallels further than Rove intended, making comparisons between him and Hanna, hinting that Rove controlled Bush like it was said Hanna controlled McKinley. Williams also saw the lasting effect of McKinley's 1896 campaign, [...] "a new approach to campaigning, the educational or merchandising style, continues to mold campaigns today, as does McKinley's focus on message, Hanna's use of money, and Dawes's reliance on efficiency and education... more than a century later, Americans and their political leaders can still learn from the events of the 1890s, whose lessons echo down the years today." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2000, <b>Texas</b> <b>Governor</b> <b>George</b> <b>W.</b> <b>Bush</b> {{successfully}} {{ran for the}} presidency. [...] As {{the campaign}} progressed, the media compared Hanna and Bush adviser Karl Rove, who was believed by some to hold a Svengali-like influence over the Texas governor. [...] During the campaign, and until his departure from the White House in 2007, media members often suggested that Rove was able to manipulate Bush, and that Rove exerted considerable control over the government. [...] Bush's advisor was deemed a present-day incarnation of Hanna, who was almost invariably presented negatively and at variance with historical fact. [...] For example, writer Jack Kelly in a 2000 column incorrectly stated that McKinley's front porch campaign was {{at the direction of}} Hanna to ensure the candidate did not vary from campaign themes, rather than McKinley deciding that it was his best response to Bryan's national tour. [...] These comparisons were fuelled by Rove's interest in, and from some reports, liking for Hanna. Rove studied the McKinley administration at the University of Texas under McKinley biographer Lewis L. Gould, and believes that Hanna's influence has been overstated.|$|E
