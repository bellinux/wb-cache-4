However, it lost the certificate on October 2012, having shown a constant decline in protection and repair scores. In June 2013, MSE achieved the lowest possible protection score, zero.

He starts to head back towards town, but his progress is hampered by shadowy figures <b>that</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> kill him. He observes a strange figure in a diving suit who reminds him of his earlier dream and how to fight the shadows with light. Alan fights through the shadows while finding pages of a manuscript titled Departure with {{his name on the}} by-line, a work he had not written. Eventually making it to town, Alan tries to alert Sheriff Sarah Breaker of his wife's disappearance, but Sarah states that there has been no island or cabin in Cauldron lake for years after it sunk following a volcanic eruption years prior. Sarah contacts the FBI to investigate Alice's disappearance, while Alan arranges for Barry to come and help.|$|E

25|$|The mistaken {{identity}} hypothesis suggests that sexual cannibalism occurs when females fail to identify males <b>that</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> court. This hypothesis {{suggests that a}} cannibalistic female attacks and consumes the male without the knowledge of mate quality. In pre-copulatory sexual cannibalism, {{mistaken identity}} can be seen when a female does not allow the male to perform the courtship dance and engages in attack. There is no conclusive evidence for this hypothesis because scientists struggle to distinguish between mistaken identity and the other hypotheses (aggressive spillover, adaptive foraging, and mate choice).|$|E

25|$|Magnetic Mirror One {{example of}} {{magnetic}} confinement {{is with the}} magnetic mirror effect. If a particle follows the field line and enters a region of higher field strength, the particles can be reflected. There are several devices <b>that</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> use this effect. The most famous was the magnetic mirror machines, which {{was a series of}} large, expensive devices built at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory from the 1960s to mid 1980s. Some other examples include the magnetic bottles and Biconic cusp. Because the mirror machines were straight, they had some advantages over a ring shape. First, mirrors were easier to construct and maintain and second direct conversion energy capture, was easier to implement. As the confinement achieved in experiments was poor, this approach was abandoned.|$|E

25|$|The Inuit {{languages}} are a fairly closely linked set of languages {{which can be}} broken up using a number of different criteria. Traditionally, Inuit describe dialect differences by means of place names to describe local idiosyncrasies in language: The dialect of Igloolik versus the dialect of Iqaluit, for example. However, political and sociological divisions are increasingly the principal criteria for describing different variants of the Inuit languages because of their links to different writing systems, literary traditions, schools, media sources and borrowed vocabulary. This makes any partition of the Inuit language somewhat problematic. This article will use labels <b>that</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> synthesise linguistic, sociolinguistic and political considerations in splitting up the Inuit dialect spectrum. This scheme {{is not the only one}} used or necessarily one used by Inuit themselves, but its labels do try to reflect the usages most seen in popular and technical literature.|$|E

Its tongue bears a conspicuous pink extension that resembles a worm and can be wriggled around; fish <b>that</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> eat the [...] "worm" [...] are themselves eaten by the turtle. Similarly, some snakes employ caudal luring (using the tail) or lingual luring (using the tongue) to entice small vertebrates into striking range.|$|E

500|$|The {{translator}} Ross Smith {{comments that}} while Tolkien was cautious about publishing his translations of Beowulf, [...] "he was {{quite willing to}} explain the approach that in his opinion should be taken towards such a monolithic task." [...] Smith points out that, unlike publishing a prose or verse translation, explaining his translation criteria did not expose Tolkien to aesthetic criticism. Smith remarks that Tolkien is [...] "somewhat disdainful" [...] of Clark Hall's version, such things being useful as study-guides and little else; putting Old English poetry into modern English prose inevitably creates something [...] "dull and flat", so Tolkien much prefers versions <b>that</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> preserve the original's rhyme and metre. Smith notes that the same opinion {{can be found in}} Tolkien's essay [...] "Sir Gawain and the Green Knight".|$|E
500|$|In addition, McKenna {{reasons that}} [...] "all things" [...] is heavily {{influenced}} by feminist philosophy and epistemology, schools of thought <b>that</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> criticize or re-evaluate the ideas of traditional philosophy and epistemology from within a feminist framework. According to McKenna, feminism rejects dualistic ways of thinking, especially [...] "typical male/female dualism". Feminist philosophy, instead, calls for a pluralistic way of thinking, noting {{that there are many}} consistent sets of truths about the world. In the episode, Scully starts out [...] "sure of her more rational scientific view and approach". As the episode progresses, however, she decides to branch out. Eventually, she brings in a spirit healer to [...] "corroborate or nullify the new beliefs she is encountering". Despite dabbling in mysticism, a field generally stereotyped as feminine by the patriarchy, Scully engages in [...] "protracted inquiry", examining all sides of the issue, in order to return Waterston to health.|$|E

"Get Back (ASAP)" [...] {{is a song}} {{recorded}} by Romanian singer Alexandra Stan, released on 28 March 2011 by Play On / Jeff Records as the third single from her debut studio album, Saxobeats (2011). The track was written and produced by Marcel Prodan and Andrei Nemirschi, and was recorded at their Maan Studio in Constanța. Musically, [...] "Get Back (ASAP)" [...] is a dance song with jazz accents, containing a saxophone in its instrumentation. Music critics were positive towards the recording, praising its catchiness, while also comparing it to its predecessor, [...] "Mr. Saxobeat" [...] (2011). Commercially, it was a modest commercial success, reaching the top 20 of the charts in multiple countries. For promotion, an accompanying music video was shot by Iulian Moga in Bucharest, Romania, serving as a continuation for the visual of [...] "Mr. Saxobeat".
