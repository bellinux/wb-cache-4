25|$|Stallard had {{the most}} {{abrasive}} nature <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> met. He could never believe {{that he could have}} a bad idea or make a bad decision. And sometimes he'd go berserk with those who disagreed with him. He didn't have, let us say, the delicacies of negotiation.|$|E
25|$|At Brisbane, on a wicket {{that was}} the worst <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> seen, the Yorkshireman was superb. The head-high bouncer was safely ignored. The chest-high {{deliveries}} of both the pace men and the spinners were played safely to the ground, {{out of the way of}} the many grasping hands in the leg-trap, and Hutton's display was a perfect lesson in the art of batsmanship...that will long remain in my memory, being by far the best innings I have ever seen played.|$|E
25|$|Its {{purpose is}} to plant the seeds of devilment and trouble-breeding {{in the days to}} come in the mind and heart of every American Negro.... It is the dirtiest, filthiest, lousiest, most obscene piece of writing <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> seen in print. I would hate to have a son or {{daughter}} of mine permitted to read it; it is so filthy and so dirty. But it comes from a Negro, and you cannot expect any better from a person of his type.|$|E
60|$|But neither father nor {{mother could}} {{remember}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> seen a magic lantern.|$|R
60|$|Something in his {{distinguished}} manner {{caused me}} to reflect upon every peccadillo <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> committed, setting it in its very worst light.|$|R
60|$|Which, {{knowing what}} Wressley of the Foreign Office was once, {{struck me as}} about the bitterest thing <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> heard a man say of his own work.|$|R
25|$|Bing Crosby {{served as}} an honorary {{director}} of the festival from 1949 to 1951. Charles Laughton visited in 1961, saying “I have just seen the four best productions of Shakespeare <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> seen in my life.” Laughton begged to play King Lear, but died in 1962 before he could fulfill the dream. Hollywood gossip columnist Hedda Hopper visited in 1962, attending two plays. Stacy Keach was a cast member in 1962 and 1963. Duke Ellington and his orchestra presented a benefit concert in 1966 that brought many luminaries to Ashland.|$|E
25|$|On 14 June 2013, the American University of Beirut awarded Faten Hamama with {{an honorary}} doctorate. The University President Peter Dorman {{introduced}} the Egyptian actress as an “icon, legend, and luminary.” However, “I feel a great happiness, today, {{greater than any}} gift <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> received. Currently, there is a massive attack on art, culture and anything related to literature. So this honorary doctorate will not only make me happy, but will bring happiness to all the artists and cultured people in Egypt and the Arab world.” said Hamama, after receiving her doctorate from Beirut, Lebanon.|$|E
25|$|He was a {{tall and}} bulky person with a {{prominent}} stomach and invariably played with a clean shaven head without any hat or cap {{or any kind of}} head gear. He always wore very loose pants and after batting for a while or keeping wicket for sometime his shirt will be hanging out of the trousers and somebody must tuck it in, now and then. He had a rather ugly and uncouth stance at the wicket as he held his bat very low and bent his body forward so much that his head was practically in line with the top of the wickets. Those who watched him from the on side could only see his prominent hind portion of the body sticking up while the head, bat and the rest of Dilawar Hussain were hardly visible. However, he had a very sound defense and so {{it was very difficult to}} get him out. He was the most selfish batsman <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> seen.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> {{wondered}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> disliked him. The {{three of}} them in the daylight seemed commonplace old folk enough. The man with the green shade had his head bent as one who sleeps.|$|R
6000|$|... "That is as {{it should}} be, sir," [...] <b>I</b> replied, forgetting <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> been weak-kneed or lukewarm in the cause. [...] "For mother's sake you {{should be the one}} to go home, if both cannot." ...|$|R
5000|$|... gave us {{the most}} graceful dancing <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> seen. He was dressed in white pantaloons, neatly made, a short jacket of dark silk gaily figured, white {{stockings}} and thin Morocco slippers upon his very small feet.|$|R
25|$|It will {{be borne}} {{in mind that}} the Liberal doctrines of that time, with their violent anti-socialist spirit and their strong insistence on the gospel of thrift, self-help, {{settlement}} of wages by the higgling of the market, and non-interference by the State.... I think that Mr. Gladstone was the strongest anti-socialist <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> known among persons who gave any serious thought to social and political questions. It is quite true, as has been often said, that “we are all socialists up to a certain point”; but Mr. Gladstone fixed that point lower, and was more vehement against those who went above it, than any other politician or official of my acquaintance. I remember his speaking indignantly to me of the budget of 1874 as “That socialistic budget of Northcote's,” merely because of the special relief which it gave to the poorer class of income-tax payers. His strong belief in Free Trade was only one of the results of his deep-rooted conviction that the Government's interference with the free action of the individual, whether by taxation or otherwise, should be kept at an irreducible minimum. It is, indeed, not too much to say that his conception of Liberalism was the negation of Socialism.|$|E
500|$|... "No country <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> {{heard of}} bears any {{resemblance}} to it; {{it seems like}} a vast sea filled with grass and green trees, and expressly intended as a retreat for the rascally Indian, from which the white man would never seek to drive them".|$|E
500|$|In an April 2007 {{blog post}} for TV Guide, actress Kate Flannery, who plays Meredith Palmer, called Jim's {{impression}} of Dwight [...] "one {{of the funniest}} scenes <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> witnessed." [...] She recalled that Krasinski and Wilson enjoyed filming the scene, and that the whole cast was laughing during it, necessitating many takes. The scene was first intended for the season's twenty-second episode, [...] "Women's Appreciation", before it was moved to [...] "Product Recall" [...] due to time constraints.|$|E
60|$|I did {{not dare}} {{to tell him what}} I thought of it. To me it was the most barefaced, shameless piece of imposture <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> witnessed. The {{collusion}} and the signal had really been too obvious.|$|R
6000|$|... "Can't understand," [...] he said, [...] "what she's doing {{crossing}} over here alone. I saw {{her the first}} day out. She came and asked me, in fact, to forget <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> seen her before. Queer thing, very!" ...|$|R
60|$|Understanding that it {{was quite}} useless to pursue this subject farther at the moment, I turned to another, {{remarking}} that the hailstorm which had smitten the country of the Black Kendah was the worst <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> experienced.|$|R
500|$|The {{day after}} the initial reports, NBA {{commissioner}} David Stern said that [...] "no amount of effort, time or personnel is being spared to assist in this investigation, {{to bring to justice}} an individual who has betrayed the most sacred trust in professional sports, and to take the necessary steps to protect against this ever happening again." [...] He then held a press conference on July 24 to address questions about the investigation. Although he called the Donaghy matter [...] "an isolated case", he also said it was [...] "the most serious situation and worst situation <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> experienced".|$|E
500|$|The {{results of}} the {{election}} surprised the civil service {{as much as it}} did the rest of the public. Civil servant and future Liberal minister Mitchell Sharp asked C.D. Howe's replacement as Minister of Trade and Commerce, Gordon Churchill, not to come to the Ministry's offices for several days as they were redecorating. Churchill later learned that the staff were moving files out. When Churchill finally came to the Ministry's offices, he was met with what he termed [...] "the coldest reception <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> received in my life". The new Minister of Labour, Michael Starr, was ticketed three days in a row for parking in the minister's spot.|$|E
500|$|The {{trial began}} before Mr Justice McCardie on 4 March 1930, with Hastings for the company, and Stuart Bevan and Norman Birkett for the syndicate. The first witness called was Coen himself, who Hastings later {{described}} as [...] "the best witness without exception <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> {{seen in the}} witness-box". He was interviewed over seven days by Hastings, then Bevan and then Birkett. Eight days into the trial {{the matter of the}} certificate came up, and Oppenheimer was unable to provide an explanation. As a result, the jury found against the syndicate - they were ordered to pay back all of the company's costs, and all of its losses.|$|E
6000|$|... "I did not ask. To {{tell the}} truth, I was not interested. The idea of Mr. Maddison being {{connected}} {{with such a}} crime is simply ridiculous. I was heartily sorry <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> taken any steps at all." ...|$|R
60|$|What {{he told me}} {{amazed me}} beyond {{anything}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> heard, even from himself, and {{what he told me}} he illustrated, flinging himself into the poises taught by Marozzo <b>that</b> <b>I</b> might appreciate the marvellous science of the thing.|$|R
5000|$|... "How are you {{supposed}} to like somebody when theyre sitting in the stands and youre on the field and theyre chucking oranges at you," [...] remarked Miami player Don Bailey. [...] "The crowd was beyond anything <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> seen.|$|R
500|$|In her {{introduction}} to the diary's first American edition, Eleanor Roosevelt described it as [...] "one of the wisest and most moving commentaries on war {{and its impact on}} human beings <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> read." [...] John F. Kennedy discussed Anne Frank in a 1961 speech, and said, [...] "Of all the multitudes who throughout history have spoken for human dignity in times of great suffering and loss, no voice is more compelling than that of Anne Frank." [...] In the same year, the Soviet writer Ilya Ehrenburg wrote of her: [...] "one voice speaks for six million—the voice not of a sage or a poet but of an ordinary little girl." ...|$|E
500|$|Obama is a Protestant Christian whose {{religious}} views developed in his adult life. He wrote in The Audacity of Hope that he [...] "was not {{raised in a}} religious household". He described his mother, raised by non-religious parents, as being detached from religion, yet [...] "in many ways the most spiritually awakened person <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> known." [...] He described his father as a [...] "confirmed atheist" [...] {{by the time his}} parents met, and his stepfather as [...] "a man who saw religion as not particularly useful." [...] Obama explained how, through working with black churches as a community organizer while in his twenties, he came to understand [...] "the power of the African-American religious tradition to spur social change." ...|$|E
500|$|... "When I {{presented}} my {{results at}} a meeting of the American Physical Society in 1923," [...] Compton later recalled, [...] "it initiated the most hotly contested scientific controversy <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> known." [...] The wave nature of light had been well demonstrated, and the idea that it could have a dual nature was not easily accepted. It was particularly telling that diffraction in a crystal lattice could only be explained with reference to its wave nature. It earned Compton the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1927. Compton and Alfred W. Simon developed the method for observing at the same instant individual scattered X-ray photons and the recoil electrons. In Germany, Walther Bothe and Hans Geiger independently developed a similar method.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, to {{tell the}} truth, I saw then the first signs <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> seen <b>that</b> her temper {{was just a little}} sharp. The {{incident}} however, was too trivial to relate and can have no possible bearing upon the case." ...|$|R
60|$|A {{lamp and}} matches {{stood in the}} hall, and {{lighting}} the lamp, I whisked up stairs with suspicious rapidity, locked my door and retired to bed, firmly refusing to own even to myself <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> heard the name of Bezee Tucker.|$|R
60|$|I {{think they}} all knew and dreaded what was coming. I looked round at their strange faces. When I saw their wincing attitudes and the furtive dread in their bright eyes, <b>I</b> {{wondered}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> believed them to be men.|$|R
500|$|By {{the middle}} of June, Pekka had {{recorded}} vocals for five tracks, which Antti described as [...] "very raw ... {{the way we want}} them to be". Pekka's vocals would continue to be recorded in August, and he completed them on August 20. Antti had also completed his guitar solos by June and was pleased with the results. [...] "For me, the solos are [...] best <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> managed to create, and I'm very satisfied." [...] After a summer break, the band returned to record Sneck's keyboards, which took place over three days, August 17–19. Sneck worked with software effects for the first time, along with sound modules. He introduced synthesized horns to the band's instrumentation, but an actual trumpet was used for the intro to [...] "Rust Never Sleeps".|$|E
500|$|Over the years, Lavelli {{developed}} a reputation for making big plays when they counted most, {{as he had done}} with his touchdown reception in the Browns' first championship game in 1946. He was nicknamed [...] "Mr. Clutch" [...] in a Pittsburgh Steelers scouting report, although [...] "Gluefingers" [...] – a name bestowed upon him by Browns announcer Bob Neal – was more widely used. He practiced with Graham tirelessly to refine routes and was not afraid to run over the middle, where he risked a pounding from defenders when the ball came his way. [...] "Dante was the greatest guy at catching a ball in a crowd <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> seen," [...] Brown once said. Among other innovations, he and Graham also mastered sideline patterns at a time when few teams used them.|$|E
500|$|Its {{inaccessible}} {{habitat and}} sparse distribution means that {{little is known}} about this species. A few birds were shot by Platen and another expedition led by Paul Sarasin and his second cousin, Fritz, between 1893 and 1898, but the rail was then not seen for more than thirty years until Heinrich found it almost {{at the end of a}} two-year survey of Sulawesi, then known as Celebes. He described it as [...] "the most priceless catch <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> hunted or will hunt". More than a decade later, Dutch ornithologist Louis Coomans de Ruiter also took a year to find the rail, despite concentrating on known suitable habitat. There were then no documented sightings until birds were observed in 1983 and 1989. Sight records remain infrequent, and only about ten specimen corpses have been studied.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hendrika," [...] said a {{voice in}} English, the sweetest voice <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> heard; somehow it {{reminded}} me of wind whispering in the trees at night. [...] "Hendrika, I fear he dies; there is a flask of brandy in my saddle-bag; get it." ...|$|R
60|$|As I spoke a {{particularly}} large ball of flame fell from above. It resembled a shooting star or a meteor {{more than anything}} else <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> seen, and made me wonder whether we were not perhaps standing beneath some inky, unseen sky.|$|R
6000|$|This {{reflection}} {{reminded me}} that she had promised us a further exhibition of those powers and within an hour or two. Remembering this I began to regret <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> asked for any such manifestations, for who knew what these might or might not involve? ...|$|R
