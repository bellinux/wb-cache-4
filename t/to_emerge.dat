40|$|How did the {{deregulation}} of U. S. bank activities affect {{the patterns of}} cross-border lending <b>to</b> <b>emerging</b> economies? Unlike bank lending from Europe or Japan, U. S. bank lending <b>to</b> <b>emerging</b> economies exhibited increasing volatility over time. Using U. S. cross-border bank exposure data, this study identifies a temporal association between important deregulation initiatives and the volatility of U. S. bank emerging market lending. This association is explained by the linkages between an important outcome of bank deregulation－earnings volatility from diversified bank activities－and the rising volatility. Together, it argues that U. S. banking deregulation had unanticipated effects of exacerbating the volatility of bank lending <b>to</b> <b>emerging</b> economies...|$|R

This would be the case if (i) the new regulatory capital requirement remains below the economic capital and (ii) banks' economic capital <b>to</b> <b>emerging</b> markets already adequately reflects risk. On both accounts the evidence indicates that the new Basel Accord should have a limited effect on lending <b>to</b> <b>emerging</b> markets.
