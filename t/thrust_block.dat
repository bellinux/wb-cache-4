50|$|On a {{power-driven}} ship, {{the drive}} shaft, or propeller shaft, usually connects the transmission inside the vessel {{directly to the}} propeller, passing through a stuffing box or other seal at the point it exits the hull. There is also a <b>thrust</b> <b>block,</b> a bearing to resist the axial force of the propeller. As the rotating propeller pushes the vessel forward, any length of drive shaft between propeller and <b>thrust</b> <b>block</b> is subject to compression, and when going astern to tension. Except for the very smallest of boats, this force isn't taken on the gearbox or engine directly.|$|E

50|$|A <b>thrust</b> <b>block,</b> {{also known}} as a thrust box, is a {{specialised}} form of thrust bearing used in ships, to resist the thrust of the propeller shaft and transmit it to the hull.|$|E

40|$|Bell-and-spigot gasket-joint {{thermoplastic}} pipes such as Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC) {{are widely}} used in pressure applications for potable water distribution and transmission, and sewer force mains. The thrust forces which result at joints due {{to changes in the}} direction of flow or changes in the diameter size of a pipeline must be counterbalanced to prevent joint separation. This is accomplished using either concrete <b>thrust</b> <b>blocks</b> or joint restraint devices, or a combination of the two. In the past fifteen years, use of joint restraints in PVC pipes has increased significantly while the use of concrete <b>thrust</b> <b>blocks</b> has lowered. In many parts of the US, both are used in tandem. Traditional joint restraints, “lug-type restraints, ” are external to a piping system and must be fitted {{on the outside of the}} joint, exposing the device to in-situ soils, which makes it susceptible to corrosion. Assembly is also time consuming and prone to human error. When using joint restraints only, without <b>thrust</b> <b>blocks,</b> it is usually necessary to also restrain one or more pipe-to-pipe joints on either side of the fitting. The number of pipe joints or the length of pipe to be restrained on either side of the appurtenance can be calculated based on several parameters. The next generation of joint restraints for PVC pipe-to pipe and ductile iron fitting-to- PVC pipe connections are internal to the system. The BullDog ™ joint is integral to a PVC pipe bell and is intended for pipe-to-pipe joints, while the fitting-to-pipe restraint is a self-restraining gasket, called the MJ Filed Lok®. These devices are easier to assemble than traditional alternatives and much less susceptible to corrosion. Basic design of joint restraints, outlined in the American Water Works Association (AWWA) Manual M 23, PVC Pipe- Design and Installation are discussed and the importance of ASTM F 1674, Standard Test Method for Joint Restraint Products for Use with PVC Pipe, in the selection of joint restraint products, is explained. Finally, a case history of a recent installation of the BullDog ™ and the MJ Field Lok-PV ® at the City of Richardson, Texas is presented...|$|R

50|$|One {{advantage}} is that the bearing surface area can be larger than for a crankshaft.

50|$|Charged in a {{military}} court, {{the captain of the}} Rainbow Warrior, Jonathan Castle, refused to pay the $142,000 fine (1,200,000 pesetas) and the ship was held in the military harbor O Ferrol. Spanish authorities disabled the activist vessel by removing the <b>thrust</b> <b>block</b> from its engine. However, for five months Greenpeace members kept the ship otherwise seaworthy while a secret effort was made to find a new <b>thrust</b> <b>block.</b> A replacement part was found, smuggled into Spain, and walked past the Spanish guards by Greenpeace members laughing and acting as if returning from a bout of drinking. Finally, on November 8 the Rainbow Warrior escaped under cover of darkness during a changing of the guard. The Spanish Navy was unable (or unwilling) to find and recapture the activists who were given a heroes' welcome in Jersey on November 11 by cheering crowds. Later, on November 15, the ship finally arrived to Amsterdam, her base.|$|E
50|$|The {{need for}} an {{efficient}} <b>thrust</b> <b>block</b> became even more important {{with the advent of}} steam turbines, with their higher propeller speeds. Despite this, there was some reluctance to adopt them in their homeland, until the discovery that World War I U-boats were using them. After this they were soon adopted widely. The large single pad illustrated is a model of one used in the battlecruiser , once the pride of the Royal Navy.|$|E
50|$|In recent years, it was {{discovered}} that Bluestone Dam would be unable to pass the Probable Maximum Flood possible at the site, which could cause failure of the dam. To remedy the problem, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has undertaken a Dam Safety Assurance program for Bluestone. The DSA project includes raising the dam by 8 ft, installing anchors and <b>thrust</b> <b>blocks</b> to tie the dam into bedrock, spillway improvements and other work. The first phase of the project was completed in October 2004. The second phase, installing bedrock anchors, is underway as of March 2010 and expected to be finished in 2011. Three additional phases remain to be constructed.|$|R
50|$|Spigot and sockets {{involve a}} normal pipe end, the spigot, being {{inserted}} into the socket or bell of another pipe or fitting with a seal being made between the two within the socket. Normal spigot and socket joints do not allow direct metal to metal contact with all forces being transmitted through the elastomeric seal. They can consequently flex and allow some degree of rotation, allowing pipes to shift and relieve stresses imposed by soil movement. The corollary is that unrestrained spigot and socket joints transmit essentially no compression or tension along the axis of the pipe and little shear. Any bends, tees or valves therefore require either a restrained joint or, more commonly, <b>thrust</b> <b>blocks,</b> which transmit the forces as compression into the surrounding soil.|$|R
50|$|Steens Mountain is {{the largest}} fault-block {{mountain}} in North America. Pressure under the Earth's surface <b>thrust</b> the <b>block</b> upward approximately 20 million years ago, resulting in a steep eastern face with a more gentle slope {{on the western side}} of the mountain. During the Ice Age, glaciers carved several deep gorges into the peak and created depressions where Lily, Fish, and Wildhorse lakes now stand.|$|R

The joint-use outlet to the aqueduct system contains two gated intakes at elevations 1382.0 and 1401.0 to permit selection {{of the level of}} the reservoir from which water is to be withdrawn; water from both levels may be mixed. This outlet also is provided with fish screens.|$|E
50|$|The Split-Karlovac Fault is a mayor {{fault line}} in Croatia. It extends from Split {{in the south}} to Karlovac in the north.

50|$|As a {{practical}} weapon, the scythe-part of the IR-kusarigama {{is used to}} strike, slash or thrust at various parts of an opponent's body, including neck, hands, wrists and solar plexus. The scythe {{is also used to}} catch an opponent's sword between the blade and the handguard. A strength of the IR-kusarigama is that it can be wielded in the normal manner, with the scythe up, or it can be used upside down. The handle itself, being made of hardwood, is used to strike, <b>thrust,</b> <b>block</b> and parry. The chain can be swung as a flail and used to ensnare the opponent's sword, limbs or even the body itself making it difficult for the swordsman to maneuver or using his weapon effectively.

50|$|The Sarah Long was {{repaired}} and re-opened to vehicle {{traffic on}} May 13, 2013.

On August 22, officials managed to partially raise the main span to allow shipping to pass under, which is given priority by federal law over road traffic. It was deemed unsafe to resume regular lifting, and with NHDOT and MDOT officials determining repairs would cost $1 million and take at least six weeks (and permanent closure just four weeks after the earliest possible re-opening), a decision was made to leave the span partially open until demolition. The premature closure of the bridge was announced on August 24, 2016.|$|E
50|$|Built {{with the}} {{steerage}} trade in mind, Homeric {{had a huge}} portion of her accommodations devoted to immigrants, and when the United States curtailed the flow of foreign settlers in the mid-1920s the Homeric was particularly hard hit. Her transatlantic crossings began to lose money as early as 1926, and the ship was sent on cruises around the Mediterranean and Caribbean. Even though the liner had only been in service since 1922, by 1927 she was seriously showing her age. Launched in 1913, her hull and inner workings were nearing twenty years old. Cracks had been discovered in her hull and superstructure, {{as well as the}} <b>thrust</b> <b>blocks</b> in the engine rooms, but like her fleet-mates, the Homeric plied on, sailing at reduced speed to extend the ship's lifetime and avoiding the worst of the North Atlantic’s squalls. In 1928, White Star formally announced the thousand-foot-long Oceanic, meant to replace the aging Olympic and Homeric. However, the new Oceanic was never to be, as White Star was unable to secure the financing for such a ship, and instead built two smaller motorliners, Britannic and Georgic. Once the Georgic entered service, Homeric became surplus on the Atlantic and she was sent cruising full-time. On 1 June 1932, she departed New York on her final transatlantic crossing. Her career on the Atlantic was indeed short-lived, as she only provided transatlantic service for ten years.|$|R
40|$|Contemporary {{understanding}} of the behaviour of surging glaciers and ice streams is hampered {{by the lack of}} data on landsystem evolution and sedimentary environments. This study concerns the ice-marginal environment of the surge-type Brúarjökull in Iceland. The sediment distribution in the glacier forefield as well as the morphology, sedimentology and tectonic architecture of the 1890 end moraine is investigated for highlighting the interaction between very dynamic ice and sediment/landform associations. As a result of substrate/bedrock decoupling during the 1890 surge, subglacial sediment was dislocated across the bedrock surface and deformed compressively, leading to gradual substrate thickening and the formation of a sediment wedge in the marginal zone. A drop in subglacial porewater pressure {{at the very end of}} the surge led to substrate/bedrock coupling and a stress transfer up into the sediment sequence causing brittle deformation of the substrate. Simultaneously, the glacier toe ploughed into the topmost part of the marginal sediment wedge initiating the moraine-ridge construction. Fine-grained and incompetent sediment deformed in ductile manner, resulting in a narrow moraine dominated by rooted folds, while coarse-grained and competent sediment deformed in brittle fashion, resulting in a wider moraine dominated by <b>thrust</b> <b>blocks.</b> A new sequential model of subglacial and ice-marginal processes operating during a glacier surge is proposed, illustrating the stepwise formation of a marginal sediment wedge and an end moraine—a twofold, inseparable marginal end-product that formed during the last days of the 1890 surge...|$|R
40|$|Duplexes are {{a common}} feature in thrust belts at many scales. Their {{geometries}} vary significantly from antiformal stacks with significant forethrusting in the cover (e. g. southern Pyrennes, Spain) to triangle zones (e. g. foreland Canadian Rockies) to low-displacement individually spaced ramp-anticlines (e. g. Sub-Andean thrust belt, Bolivia). We present a series of physical experiments demonstrating that {{the strength of the}} décollements relative to that of the intervening and overlying rock layers plays a significant role in controlling the duplex style. The models comprise brittle layers made of dry quartz sand and décollements made of two types of viscous silicone polymers. The strength of the décollements in the models {{is a function of the}} shortening rate applied to the model. The relative strength of the décollements and surrounding rocks affects the development of active- or passive-roof duplexes (triangle zones). It also affects the amount of translation of individual <b>thrust</b> <b>blocks</b> and the spacing of thrust ramps, which in turn determine if a duplex evolves into an antiformal stack or into individually spaced ramp-anticlines. Model results indicate that specific associations of structural features form systematically under similar rheological and boundary conditions. The presence of relatively strong décollements promotes local underthrusting of the cover, individual ramp-anticlines, internal deformation of thrust sheets, low early layer-parallel shortening, and sequential towards-the-foreland propagation of structures. Weak décollements promote forethrusting of the cover, antiformal stacks, coeval growth of structures, and low internal strain...|$|R
50|$|The first {{tilting pad}} bearing in service was {{probably}} built under A.G.M. Michell's guidance by George Weymoth (Pty) Ltd, for a centrifugal pump at Cohuna on the Murray River, Victoria, Australia, in 1907, just two years after Michell had published and patented his three-dimensional solution to Reynold's equation. By 1913, the great merits of the tilting-pad bearing had been recognised for marine applications. The first British ship to be fitted out with the bearing was the cross-channel steamboat the Paris, but many naval vessels were similarly equipped during the First World War. The practical results were spectacular - the troublesome <b>thrust</b> <b>block</b> became dramatically smaller and lighter, significantly more efficient, and remarkably free from maintenance troubles. It was estimated that the Royal Navy saved coal to a value of £500,000 in 1918 alone {{as a result of}} fitting Michell's tilting-pad bearings.|$|E
50|$|Early screw-propelled steamships used a <b>thrust</b> <b>block</b> or thrust box {{composed}} of perhaps a dozen lower-rated plain thrust journal bearings stacked {{on the same}} shaft. These were problematic in service: they were bulky, difficult to dismantle, wasted power through friction {{and they had a}} tendency to overheat. The thrust box was built of a box-like cast iron housing with a radial bearing at each end and a number of collars formed on the shaft between them. This shaft was often a short section of removable shaft called the thrust shaft, linking the engine ahead to the propeller shaft astern. A series of iron horseshoe-shaped collars fitted over the small diameter of the shaft and bore against the forward face of the shaft's collars. Each horseshoe was faced with a low-friction pad of babbitt metal. Lubrication was by an oil bath in the box and a plentiful volume was important for cooling purposes too.|$|E

40|$|Using high?resolution seismic {{profiles}} {{and other}} geophysical data, collected during R/V Meteor Cruise M 74 / 2, we investigate the distribution patterns of shallow sediments, their structure and deformation processes, {{and their role}} in the migration, accumulation and seepage of hydrocarbon?rich fluids. Here, we show that rapid syn?kinematic sedimentation at the frontal Makran accretionary prism provides a mechanism by which emerging imbricated thrust packets override the footwall at the seafloor without significant mass?wasting and destruction of fault?related anticline in the hanging wall. These anticlines may rise high above the seafloor to form plate?boundary?parallel ridges, and distinguish from simple <b>thrust</b> <b>blocks</b> seen at convergent margins elsewhere. With the fast burial of many thrust faults by the syn?kinematic sediments, anticlinal growth structures form in these syn?kinematic sediments by continuous thrust activity. The anticlinal structures preserved within the cores of the ridges or formed from these syn?kinematic sediments act as structural traps for migrating hydrocarbon?rich fluids, above which fluid escape structures are generated leading to seafloor seeps. Most of the discovered hydrocarbon seeps around Sixth Ridge are sourced from these traps. Despite the compressional environment and the rapid syn?kinematic sedimentation rates, shallow subsurface of the frontal Makran is a normally pressured regime, in which the buoyancy of hydrocarbons may account for the fluid migration. In this important respect, the Makran accretionary prism differs from many other convergent margins and accretionary prisms, where fluid flow is largely driven by tectonically induced overpressure...|$|R

40|$|The {{internal}} {{sectors of}} the Orobic Alps (Northern Italy) are characterised by Alpine age regional shortening showing a transition, through time, from plastic to brittle deformation. Thrust faults cut Alpine ductile folds and are marked by cataclasites and, locally, by pseudotachylytes, suggesting that motion was accommodated by seismic frictional slip. In the Eastern Orobic Alps the thrusting initiated at depths deeper than 10 km (the emplacement depth of the Adamello pluton) and possibly continued at shallower depths. This demonstrates that thrust motion occurred between 10 km depth and the brittle-ductile transition, i. e., at mid-crustal depths. The Orobic Alps exhumed paleoseismic zone shows different geometries along strike. In the central {{sectors of the}} Orobic Alps, thrust faults, associated with pseudotachylytes, have average dips around 40 degrees and show no pervasive veining. Much steeper thrusts (dips up to about 85 degrees) occur in the eastern Orobic Alps. In this area, faults are not associated with pervasive veining, i. e., fluid circulation was relatively scarce. This suggests that faulting did not occur with supralithostatic fluid pressure conditions. These reverse faults are severely misoriented (far too steep) for fault reactivation in a sublithostatic fluid pressure regime, We suggest that thrust motion likely started when the fault, were less steep and that the faults were progressively rotated {{up to the present}} day dips. Domino tilting is probably responsible for this subsequent fault steepening, as suggested by a decrease of the steepness of thrust faults from north to south and by systematic rotations of previous structures consistently with tilting of <b>thrust</b> <b>blocks.</b> When the faults became inclined beyond the fault lock-up angle, no further thrusting was accommodated along them. At later stages regional shortening was accommodated by newly formed lower angle shear planes (dipping around 30 - 40 degrees), consistently with predictions from fault mechanics.
