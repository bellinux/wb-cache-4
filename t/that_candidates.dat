5|$|The {{law school}} of Beirut {{supplied}} the Roman Empire, especially its eastern provinces, with lawyers and magistrates for three centuries until the school's destruction. The influx of students was abundant and persistent {{because of the}} affluence, honor and secured employment offered by the profession. A degree in law became highly sought following an edict issued in 460 by Emperor Leo I. The edict ordered <b>that</b> <b>candidates</b> for the bar of the Eastern praetorian prefecture had to produce certificates of proficiency from the law teachers who instructed them {{at one of the}} recognized law schools of the Empire.|$|E
5|$|The Presidential Council for Minority Rights (PCMR) is a non-elected {{government}} body in Singapore established in 1970, the main function {{of which is}} to scrutinize most of the bills passed by Parliament to ensure that they do not discriminate against any racial or religious community. If the Council feels that any provision in a bill amounts to a differentiating measure, it will report its findings to Parliament and refer the bill back to Parliament for reconsideration. The Council also examines subsidiary legislation and statutes in force on 9 January 1970. One member of the PCMR is nominated by the Chairman to the Presidential Elections Committee, which is empowered to ensure <b>that</b> <b>candidates</b> for the office of President have the qualifications required by the Constitution. The President also appoints and dismisses the chairman and members of the Presidential Council for Religious Harmony ("PCRH"), established by the , on the advice of the PCMR, and the PCMR is responsible for determining whether PCRH members who are not representatives of major religions in Singapore have distinguished themselves in public service or community relations in Singapore.|$|E

5000|$|For each {{successful}} <b>candidate</b> <b>that</b> {{exceeds the}} quota threshold, calculate {{the ratio of}} <b>that</b> <b>candidate's</b> surplus votes (i.e., the excess over the quota) divided {{by the total number}} of votes for <b>that</b> <b>candidate,</b> including the value of previous transfers. Transfer <b>that</b> <b>candidate's</b> votes to each voter's next preferred hopeful.

50|$|To {{be placed}} on the ballot, {{candidates}} for leader had to obtain the nominations of 35 MPs.

5|$|The {{issue was}} one of the last major issues to be resolved, and was done so in the electoral college. At the time, before the {{formation}} of modern political parties, there was widespread concern <b>that</b> <b>candidates</b> would routinely fail to secure a majority of electors in the electoral college. The method of resolving this problem therefore was a contested issue. Most thought that the house should then choose the president, since it most closely reflected the will of the people. This caused dissension among delegates from smaller states, who realized that this would put their states at a disadvantage. To resolve this dispute, the Convention agreed that the house would elect the president if no candidate had an electoral college majority, but that each state delegation would vote as a bloc, rather than individually.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} two no-show paradoxes, {{in which}} a voter obtains a preferable outcome by abstaining from a vote. One arises when the casting of a ballot <b>that</b> ranks a <b>candidate</b> in first causes <b>that</b> <b>candidate</b> to lose the election. The other arises when a ballot <b>that</b> ranks a <b>candidate</b> in last causes <b>that</b> <b>candidate</b> to win. We show that when {{there are at least}} four candidates and when voters may express indifference, every voting rule satisfying Condorcet's principle must generate both of these paradoxes. ...|$|R

5000|$|Chief Justice John Roberts concurred in the 2008 decision, [...] "If {{the ballot}} is {{designed}} {{in such a}} manner that no reasonable voter would believe <b>that</b> the <b>candidates</b> listed there are nominees or members of, or otherwise associated with, the parties the candidates claimed to “prefer,” the I-872 primary system would likely pass constitutional muster." [...] Each candidate for partisan office can state a political party that he or she prefers. Ballots also must feature a disclaimer to voters <b>that</b> <b>candidate's</b> preference does not imply <b>that</b> the <b>candidate</b> is nominated or endorsed by the party or that the party approves of or associates with <b>that</b> <b>candidate.</b>|$|R

50|$|If {{votes are}} {{transferred}} because a candidate has exceeded the quota required to win, all of <b>that</b> <b>candidate's</b> ballots are examined for transfer votes (Senatorial rules), unlike {{the method used}} for the Irish Dáil in which, after a candidate has reached the quota, only the last parcel of votes transferred to <b>that</b> <b>candidate</b> are examined for further preferences (the Hare method).|$|R

25|$|The {{controversy}} {{followed the}} HKEAA's announcement in 2007 {{that if a}} candidate exceeded the word limit (500 words) in a task in Section E (Practical skills for work and study), anything written beyond the limit would not be marked. However, according to the marking guidelines issued the previous year, students who did so should be deducted only two marks from the style mark for doing so. That resulted in criticism by many students, who claimed that although the word limit instruction was stated in the paper, they were not clearly informed of the marking criteria and that the marking scheme the HKEAA adopted {{in the previous year}} gave them a misleading impression. The authority later stated <b>that</b> <b>candidates</b> should have read all instructions before attempting the questions. It also stated <b>that</b> <b>candidates</b> who followed the instructions strictly should be treated fairly.|$|E

50|$|In the ThreeBallot Voting System {{voters are}} given three blank ballots, {{identical}} {{except for a}} unique identifier that is distinct for each ballot.

50|$|Voting {{strategy}} under {{approval is}} guided by two competing features of approval voting. On the one hand, approval voting fails the later-no-harm criterion, so voting for a <b>candidate</b> can cause <b>that</b> <b>candidate</b> to win instead of a more preferred candidate. On the other hand, approval voting satisfies the monotonicity criterion, so not voting for a candidate can never help <b>that</b> <b>candidate</b> win, but can cause <b>that</b> <b>candidate</b> to lose to a less preferred candidate. Either way, the voter can risk getting a less preferred election winner. A voter can balance the risk-benefit trade-offs by considering the voter's cardinal utilities, particularly via the von Neumann-Morgenstern utility theorem, and the probabilities of how others vote.|$|R
