5|$|As he {{indicated}} in the title, Kepler thought he had revealed God's geometrical plan for the universe. Much of Kepler's enthusiasm for the Copernican system stemmed from his theological convictions about {{the connection between the}} physical and the spiritual; the universe itself was an image of God, with the Sun corresponding <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Father,</b> the stellar sphere to the Son, and the intervening space between to the Holy Spirit. His first manuscript of Mysterium contained an extensive chapter reconciling heliocentrism with biblical passages that seemed to support geocentrism.|$|E
5|$|Three major {{theological}} controversies {{occurred during}} Manuel's reign. In 1156–1157 {{the question was}} raised whether Christ had offered himself as a sacrifice {{for the sins of}} the world <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Father</b> and to the Holy Spirit only, or also to the Logos (i.e., to himself). In the end a synod held at Constantinople in 1157 adopted a compromise formula, that the Word made flesh offered a double sacrifice to the Holy Trinity, despite the dissidence of Patriarch of Antioch-elect Soterichus Panteugenus.|$|E
50|$|In ancient China, first cousins {{with the}} same {{surnames}} (i.e., those born <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>father's</b> brothers) were not permitted to marry, while those with different surnames (i.e., maternal cousins and paternal cousins born <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>father's</b> sisters) were.|$|R
25|$|The Mishnah {{taught that}} if one stole from one's father and, when charged by <b>the</b> <b>father,</b> denied it on oath, and <b>the</b> <b>father</b> then died before <b>the</b> child confessed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>father's</b> heirs, then <b>the</b> child would have <b>to</b> repay <b>the</b> {{principal}} and a fifth <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>father's</b> other children or <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>father's</b> brothers (<b>the</b> child's uncles) if the child had no siblings. But if the child was unwilling <b>to</b> forfeit <b>the</b> child's share in the payment that child had to make, or if the child had no resources, then <b>the</b> child was <b>to</b> borrow <b>the</b> amount from others and perform the duty of restoration <b>to</b> <b>the</b> heirs, and the creditors could subsequently come and demand <b>to</b> be paid <b>the</b> portion that would by law have belonged <b>to</b> <b>the</b> child as heir..|$|R

5|$|Harry and Debbie punish Annie by not {{allowing}} {{her to go to}} Naomi's party. When they reconsider and decide to let her go, they discover that she has already left. Harry goes to the party to find Annie, but is instead told by Tracy that they have a son together, whom she gave up for adoption over twenty years ago. Adrianna, who had previously stolen money from Naomi's purse, claims to have found it and gives it back. Naomi checks her phone messages and learns that Ethan is cheating on her. Naomi asks Ethan if he is really cheating on her, and leaves the party after he fails to answer. Annie leaves with Silver for another party on the beach, where she apologizes to Ethan for revealing that he was cheating on Naomi. When she asks why he told the truth about Dixon not starting the fight, he replies that he is trying to be the good guy he used to be. Annie, Silver, Dixon and Navid {{spend the rest of the}} night swimming at the beach. In the closing scenes, Kelly talks <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>father</b> of her four-year-old son, Adrianna pays her drug dealer with money she stole from Naomi, and Ethan visits Naomi's house.|$|E
5|$|Most Christians {{believe that}} Jesus was {{both human and}} the Son of God. While there has been {{theological}} debate over his nature, Some early Christians viewed Jesus as subordinate <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Father,</b> and others considered him {{an aspect of the}} Father rather than a separate person. The Church resolved the issues in ancient councils, which established the Holy Trinity, with Jesus both fully human and fully God. Trinitarian Christians generally believe that Jesus is the Logos, God's incarnation and God the Son, both fully divine and fully human. However, the doctrine of the Trinity is not universally accepted among Christians. With the Protestant Reformation, Christians such as Michael Servetus and the Socinians started questioning the ancient creeds that had established Jesus' two natures. Nontrinitarian Christian groups include The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Unitarians and Jehovah's Witnesses.|$|E
5|$|The {{second book}} {{includes}} several essays on original sin {{and the fall}} of man, which directly refer to Augustine, who developed these doctrines. He often cited the Church Fathers in order to defend the reformed cause against the charge that the reformers were creating new theology. In Calvin's view, sin began {{with the fall of}} Adam and propagated to all of humanity. The domination of sin is complete to the point that people are driven to evil. Thus fallen humanity is in need of the redemption that can be found in Christ. But before Calvin expounded on this doctrine, he described the special situation of the Jews who lived {{during the time of the}} Old Testament. God made a covenant with Abraham, promising the coming of Christ. Hence, the Old Covenant was not in opposition to Christ, but was rather a continuation of God's promise. Calvin then describes the New Covenant using the passage from the Apostles' Creed that describes Christ's suffering under Pontius Pilate and his return to judge the living and the dead. For Calvin, the whole course of Christ's obedience <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Father</b> removed the discord between humanity and God.|$|E

5|$|Mariano Moreno {{had several}} {{contacts}} with groups seeking {{the removal of}} Cisneros, but was not strongly involved with the May Revolution, which considered {{the fall of the}} Junta of Seville a reason to depose the viceroy and create a local junta. At the time, Moreno was still loyal to Álzaga. He attended the May 22 open Cabildo, but according <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>father</b> of Vicente Fidel López and the father-in-law of Bartolomé Mitre (both direct witness) he stayed silent at one side and did not join the debate. He voted for Saavedra's proposal: to remove viceroy Cisneros and replace him with a Junta. Manuel Hermenegildo Aguirre, captain of hussars, proposed that the Cabildo take the reins of government, with five men appointed as counselors, Moreno among them. However, nobody else voted for that proposal, and it {{was the only one that}} included him. Moreno felt betrayed when the Cabildo twisted the results of the open Cabildo and created a Junta that would be headed by Cisneros. He refused any further contacts with the revolutionaries and stayed home during the remaining events. The definitive members of the Junta came from a popular petition signed on May 25, which was given to the Cabildo. The reasons of Moreno's inclusion in the list are unclear, as with all other members of the Junta. A commonly accepted theory considers it to be a balance between Carlotists and Alzaguists.|$|E

25|$|They {{perceive}} the West as teaching {{through more than}} one type of theological Filioque a different origin and cause of the Holy Spirit; that through the dogmatic Roman Catholic Filioque the Holy Spirit is subordinate <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Father</b> and the Son and not a free, independent and equal <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Father</b> hypostasis that receives his uncreatedness from the origin of all things, the Father hypostasis.
