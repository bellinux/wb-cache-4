On June 18, 2010, with the opening of the entire The Wizarding World of Harry Potter section, the ride officially became Dragon Challenge.|$|E
5|$|The {{mission was}} part of an effort by MirCorp <b>to</b> <b>refurbish</b> and privatize the aging Mir space station, which was nearing the end of its {{operational}} life. Further commercially funded missions beyond Soyuz TM-30 were originally planned to continue the restoration efforts of the then 14-year-old space station, but insufficient funding and investment ultimately led to the de-orbit of the station in early 2001.|$|E

5|$|After Zappas's death, and wholly {{due to the}} Greek {{government}} ignoring Zappas's instructions <b>to</b> <b>refurbish</b> {{the stadium}} in marble, it was necessary <b>to</b> <b>refurbish</b> the Panathenian stadium a second time, replacing wood for marble, in readiness for the Athens 1896 Olympic Games. After a period of litigation over Zappas's bequests, his cousin Konstantinos Zappas continued and expanded his endowment of the Games and maintained efforts for {{the continuation of the}} Olympic concept. In 1870, the new stadium, with a spectator capacity of 30,000, was ready to host the second Olympiad. The Olympic Games of 1870, apart from being the first modern international Olympic Games to be hosted in a stadium, were better attended and hosted more events and athletes, and were much better organized in general. Additionally, the first modern Olympic building was built to support the contests (and hosted the fencing events of 1896), as well as an industrial exhibition that anti-athletic members of the Greek government had forced upon the concept of the Games. This building, located near the city's National Garden, was entirely funded by Zappas's legacy and was named Zappeion after him. The Zappeion officially opened on 20 October 1888.|$|E
5|$|An {{extensive}} {{maintenance program}} intended {{to extend the}} service lives of M249s {{has been carried out}} <b>to</b> <b>refurbish</b> rifles, especially units that suffered from wear due to heavy use. In particular the warping of the receiver rails on the early-models was a defect that occurred in heavily used first-generation M249s. This defect however has been completely eliminated on later models and is no longer present on the current-issue M249, which has reinforced rails and full-length welding rather than spot welding. Also being worked on is replacement of the M249's buttstock with a redesigned adjustable stock.|$|E
5|$|Another old {{structure}} {{removed from}} Europe was proposed for Wyntoon: the great tithe barn of Bradenstoke Priory in England. Most of the priory {{had been used}} by Hearst <b>to</b> <b>refurbish</b> St Donat's Castle in Wales in the late 1920s, but the tithe barn had been crated and shipped to San Simeon for possible use there. Hearst proposed that the unused Bradenstoke barn be incorporated into his great castle, and had Morgan study the possibilities.|$|E

5|$|Built to {{a height}} of 100 metres (328ft), the PUB Building was {{completed}} in 1977; construction cost S$32 million. It was renamed as the Singapore Power Building, after PUB's electricity and gas operations were corporatised to Singapore Power on 1 October 1995. The Singapore Power Building was renovated in 2006, when Singapore Power chose not to redevelop its corporate headquarters. Instead, it opted <b>to</b> <b>refurbish</b> and reclad the building in silvery metal.|$|E

A further £20million is earmarked for a refurbishment of the nearby Altrincham Interchange. A 2010 survey found that despite being in one of the country's most affluent areas, {{nearly a third of the}} shops in Altrincham were vacant; Trafford council attributed the high number (78) to the effects of the recession and plans <b>to</b> <b>refurbish</b> Stamford House, which left most of its shops unused.|$|E

5|$|In 2005, Toronto City Council again {{proposed}} {{to extend the}} line northeastward {{as a replacement for}} the aging Scarborough RT.

Using heavy-rail rapid transit {{like the rest of the}} Toronto subway in Scarborough was not yet examined. In 2007, mayor David Miller included the refurbishment of the Scarborough RT using modern light rail transit as part of his Transit City plan.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the revenue}} of Dwarka is derived from tourism, due to it being a site for pilgrims. It is a {{producer}} of agricultural produce such as millets, ghee (clarified butter), oilseeds, and salt, which are transported from its port.

5|$|The Smithsonian {{recognized}} the locomotive's age in 1931, but, since the museum didn't have the funds <b>to</b> <b>refurbish</b> the locomotive for full operation again, {{it was decided}} to run the locomotive in place (with the driving wheels lifted off the rails using jacks) with compressed air. The museum borrowed an 1836 coach from the Pennsylvania Railroad to display on the track behind the newly rebuilt tender, and the locomotive's 100th birthday was officially celebrated on November 12, 1931. The locomotive's semi-operation was broadcast over the CBS radio network with Stanley Bell narrating the ceremonies for the radio audience.|$|E

5|$|Two decades later, Phoenix was {{the subject}} of discussions about the city budget. In the late 1970s, the fireboat's annual {{operating}} expenses were about $1.2million. Mayor George Moscone met with the San Francisco Port Commission in 1977 to determine whether Phoenix would be refurbished, replaced, or scrapped with no replacement. An improvement bond was passed in November 1977 to build a new fireboat. Local naval architects Morris Guralnick Associates submitted a design in 1980 to replace Phoenix, but the estimated construction costs far exceeded the bond. Instead, Mayor Dianne Feinstein redirected the funds <b>to</b> <b>refurbish</b> Phoenix in 1981–1982.|$|E
5|$|Based on the study, Governor William O'Neill ordered ConnDOT in October 1986 to {{initiate}} rail {{service on the}} corridor. It was established as a temporary service to newly reopened local stations between Union Station in New Haven and Old Saybrook, to alleviate traffic congestion that arose from scheduled construction work on I-95. O'Neill introduced a $50 million transportation program that included $900,000 (later reduced to $500,000) for basic stations and $4 million <b>to</b> <b>refurbish</b> 12 Budd Rail Diesel Cars for rolling stock. The RDCs {{were found to be}} insufficient and two diesel trainsets were purchased from the defunct PATrain service in 1989 instead. Testing of the equipment on the Northeast Corridor began on December 2, 1989.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 1970s, the school's population, {{academic}} program, and building {{were all in}} decline, in part reflecting the economic problems {{of the city as}} a whole. In 1977, the city school system allocated money <b>to</b> <b>refurbish</b> the school and bolster the college preparatory program. That same year the school system announced its intent to make City College coeducational; however, the all-male tradition did not end easily. Alumni argued for the uniqueness of a single-sex education system, and a task force studying the issue voted 11–6 in favor of keeping the all-male tradition. In a stunning reversal, the board of school commissioners voted to admit women citing constitutional concerns over equal rights. The following year City College enrolled women for the first time.|$|E

5|$|Johnson had {{purchased}} the car from a junkyard in 1956. Johnson and his son, Craig, would restore {{the car as}} a father-son project while Craig attended the Georgia Military Academy. The two spent two years and over $1,800 restoring the vehicle. Johnson utilized spare parts from many different sources <b>to</b> <b>refurbish</b> the rusty hulk. He bought the mahogany dash from a parts dealer in Caracas, Venezuela and used Convair 440 aluminum sheets to replace the flooring. After Craig graduated from high school, he attended Florida State on a track scholarship. In 1960, Craig's track team would be in Atlanta competing against Tech. Johnson, wanting to see his son compete, took the Model A to Tech campus, parked it near Towers dormitory, and went to watch Craig compete.|$|E
5|$|Manager Malcolm McLaren asked {{architect}} Ben Kelly <b>to</b> <b>refurbish</b> {{a basement}} rehearsal room {{he had bought}} from Badfinger. The Sex Pistols rehearsed in this room, lived above No. 6, and recorded their first demos there. Johnny Rotten drew cartoons of the members as graffiti which was later revealed in an archaeological survey of the site. Scott Gorham bought his first guitar with Thin Lizzy on Denmark Street. He had turned up at the audition with a Japanese Les Paul Copy—when he got the job, Phil Lynott took him shopping on Denmark Street. After being told several guitars were too expensive, he settled on a Sunburst Gibson Les Paul Deluxe. Andy's Guitars was established in 1978 at No. 27 and survived for many years before closing in 2007 because of increased shop rates.|$|E
