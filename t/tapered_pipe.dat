40|$|Knowledge of how {{air flows}} through the nasal {{passages}} relies heavily on model studies, as the complexity and relative inaccessibility of the anatomy prevents detailed in vivo measurement. Almost all models to date fail to incorporate the geometry of the external nose, instead employing a truncated inflow. Typically, flow is specified to enter the model domain either directly at the nares (nostrils), or via an artificial pipe inflow tract attached to the nares. This study investigates {{the effect of the}} inflow geometry on flow predictions during steady nasal inspiration. Models that fully replicate the internal and external nasal airways of two anatomically distinct subjects are used as a reference to compare the effects of common inflow treatments on physiologically relevant quantities including regional wall shear stress and particle residence time distributions. Inflow geometry truncation is found to affect flow predictions significantly, though slightly less so for the subject displaying more pronounced passage area contraction up to the internal nasal valve. For both subject geometries, a <b>tapered</b> <b>pipe</b> inflow provides a better approximation to the natural inflow than a blunt velocity profile applied to the nares.

In a sense, INVELOX is a wind injection system, much like a fuel injection system for cars. It works by accelerating the wind. A large intake captures wind, funnels it down using <b>tapered</b> <b>pipes</b> leading to a concentrator that ends in a Venturi section and finally wind exits from a diffuser. Turbine(s) are placed inside the Venturi section of the INVELOX. Inside the Venturi the dynamic pressure is very high while the static pressure is low. The Turbine converts dynamic pressure or kinetic energy to mechanical rotation and thereby to electrical power using a generator. The device has been constructed and tested, but also criticized for lack of efficiency. , prototypes are being installed, while another is inoperable.|$|R
50|$|An {{oil water}} {{separation}} hydrocyclone is a device designed to separate oil from water {{by the use}} of a strong vortex. These separators are passive (no moving parts) and resemble long <b>tapered</b> <b>pipes.</b> They typically contain an inlet section, long tapered section and a long outlet section. In operation the strong vortex is created when the oily water is injected tangentially into the inlet end of the separator. This creates a centrifugal force, that accelerates as it moves down the tapered cone. The centripetal and centrifugal forces separate the heavier water component to the outside of the vortex while the lighter oil droplets are forced to the centre. The separated oils are removed through an orifice at the inlet end of the cone and treated water is discharged through the opposite end. The centrifugal forces generated inside the vortex of the better de-oiling hydrocyclone separators are of the order of 1,000 times the force of gravity. This is why smaller emulsified oil droplets as low as 15 microns can be removed.|$|R

50|$|The <b>tapered</b> quarter-wave <b>pipe</b> (TQWP) is {{an example}} of a {{combination}} of transmission line and horn effects. It is highly regarded by some speaker designers. The concept is that the sound emitted from the rear of the loudspeaker driver is progressively reflected and absorbed along the length of the tapering tube, almost completely preventing internally reflected sound being retransmitted through the cone of the loudspeaker. The lower part of the pipe acts as a horn while the top can be visualised as an extended compression chamber. The entire pipe can also be seen as a tapered transmission line in inverted form. (A traditional tapered transmission line, confusingly also sometimes referred to as a TQWP, has a smaller mouth area than throat area.) Its relatively low adoption in commercial speakers can mostly be attributed to the large resulting dimensions of the speaker produced and the expense of manufacturing a rigid tapering tube. The TQWP is also known as a Voigt pipe and was introduced in 1934 by Paul G. A. H. Voigt, Lowther's original driver designer.|$|R
40|$|Light pipes are key optical {{components}} used in projection {{systems to}} transport and homogenize {{light from the}} source towards the light valve. They can provide a uniform light distribution at their output {{as a result of}} multiple internal reflections. In laser projection systems, such light pipes are useful in combination with a laser-light module consisting of one or more single-mode lasers and a rotating diffuser. The partially coherent light emanating from the rotating diffuser is transported and homogenized {{towards the end of the}} light pipe. Consequently, propagation through the light pipe will also modify the coherence properties of the laser light. In this paper, a computationally efficient simulation model is presented to propagate partially coherent light through a homogenizing rectangular light pipe. The resulting coherence function clearly differs from that of free-space propagation over the same optical path length. The implications of these results on, for example, the appearance of speckle are discussed in further detail. The simulation results are experimentally verified using a reversing wavefront Michelson interferometer.

50|$|The Voigt pipe {{is a type}} of {{loudspeaker}} enclosure that embodies a combination of transmission line, ported enclosure and horn characteristics. It is highly regarded by some speaker designers, as evidenced by established manufacturers such as Castle.

The concept is that the sound emitted {{from the rear of the}} loudspeaker driver is progressively reflected and absorbed along the length of the tapering tube, almost completely preventing internally reflected sound being retransmitted through the cone of the loudspeaker. The lower part of the pipe acts as a horn while the top can be visualized as an extended compression chamber. The entire pipe can also be seen as a tapered transmission line in inverted form, that is, widening rather than narrowing from top to bottom. The driver is usually positioned close to the middle of the baffle or slightly lower. Its relatively low adoption in commercial speakers can mostly be attributed to the large resulting dimensions of the speaker produced and the expense of manufacturing a rigid tapering tube.

40|$|Five {{significant}} problems hinder advances in {{understanding of the}} volcanology of kimberlites: (1) kimberlite geology is very model driven; (2) a highly genetic terminology drives deposit or facies interpretation; (3) the effects of alteration on preserved depositional textures have been grossly underestimated; (4) the level {{of understanding of the}} physical process significance of preserved textures is limited; and, (5) some inferred processes and deposits are not based on actual, modern volcanological processes. These issues need to be addressed in order to advance understanding of kimberlite volcanological pipe forming processes and deposits. The traditional, steep-sided southern African pipe model (Class I) consists of a steep <b>tapering</b> <b>pipe</b> with a deep root zone, a middle diatreme zone and an upper crater zone (if preserved). Each zone is thought to be dominated by distinctive facies, respectively: hypabyssal kimberlite (HK, descriptively called here massive coherent porphyritic kimberlite), tuffisitic kimberlite breccia (TKB, descriptively here called massive, poorly sorted lapilli tuff) and crater zone facies, which include variably bedded pyroclastic kimberlite and resedimented and reworked volcaniclastic kimberlite (RVK). Porphyritic coherent kimberlite may, however, also be emplaced at different levels in the pipe, as later stage intrusions, as well as dykes in the surrounding country rock. The relationship between HK and TKB is not always clear. Sub-terranean fluidisation as an emplacement process is a largely unsubstantiated hypothesis; modern in-vent volcanological processes should initially be considered to explain observed deposits. Crater zone volcaniclastic deposits can occur within the diatreme zone of some pipes, indicating that the pipe was largely empty {{at the end of the}} eruption, and subsequently began to fill-in largely through resedimentation and sourcing of pyroclastic deposits from nearby vents. Classes II and III Canadian kimberlite models have a more factual, descriptive basis, but are still inadequately documented given the recency of their discovery. The diversity amongst kimberlite bodies suggests that a three-model classification is an over-simplification. Every kimberlite is altered to varying degrees, which is an intrinsic consequence of the ultrabasic composition of kimberlite and the in-vent context; few preserve original textures. The effects of syn- to post-emplacement alteration on original textures have not been adequately considered to date, and should be back-stripped to identify original textural elements and configurations. Applying sedimentological textural configurations as a guide to emplacement processes would be useful. The traditional terminology has many connotations about spatial position in pipe and of process. Perhaps the traditional terminology can be retained in the industrial situation as a general lithofacies-mining terminological scheme because it is so entrenched. However, for research purposes a more descriptive lithofacies terminology should be adopted to facilitate detailed understanding of deposit characteristics, important variations in these, and the process origins. For example every deposit of TKB is different in componentry, texture, or depositional structure. However, because so many deposits in many different pipes are called TKB, there is an implication that they are all similar and that similar processes were involved, which is far from clear...|$|R
