60|$|It was ideal {{weather for}} skating and sleighing, {{but none of}} <b>the</b> young <b>folks</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Wadsworth mansion felt like going out for fun. All could see that <b>the</b> older <b>folks</b> were much worried, and consequently, they were worried, too.|$|R
6000|$|... 'If I hae time?' said Dandie, with {{an accent}} {{on the word}} {{that sounded like a}} howl of derision. 'Ou, what the deevil am I come here for, man, but just ance errand to see about it? But ye'll no be the waur o' {{something}} to eat, I trow; it's getting late <b>at</b> e'en.

6000|$|Gallwey nodded. [...] "The same thing," [...] he said, [...] "has {{occurred}} to me all along. His attitude is comprehensible, and I have a certain sympathy with <b>the</b> <b>folks</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> head of the police. To attend to everything, they would want a brigade." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Wright has jest telegraphed that he's {{on his way}} to New York, so we may not see him for two {{or three}} days.

"Indeed," [...] said Elspeth, {{trying to}} catch and chime in {{with the ideas of}} the Sub-Prior, [...] "I have often thought <b>the</b> miller's <b>folk</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Monastery-mill were far over {{careless}} in sifting our melder, and in bolting it too--some folk say they will not stick at whiles to put in a handful of ashes amongst Christian folk's corn-meal." ...|$|R
60|$|Very circumspect {{and very}} alert, he moved {{here and there}} about the open space, peering through the vistas among the trees and trying {{to catch a glimpse}} of the hunting animal that all {{suspected}} had pursued me. And while he did this, taking no notice of me, <b>the</b> <b>Folk</b> crowded <b>at</b> <b>the</b> cave-mouths and watched.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{said the}} shoeman. [...] "I don't know what you're after, exactly, {{but if you}} think I'm so shot on for {{subjects}} that I've got to tell <b>the</b> <b>folks</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> next stop that I sold a fellar a pair of slippas for his gul--Go 'long!"

6000|$|... "Never had any. She was a queer old woman, {{and lived}} {{alone in a}} little tumble-down house with {{nineteen}} cats. Folks called her a witch, but she wasn't, though she looked like an old rag-bag. She was real kind to me when I lived in that place, and used to let me get warm at her fire when <b>the</b> <b>folks</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> poorhouse were hard on me." ...|$|E

I figured I'd look in to tell you it will be two or three days yet before you get the flour <b>the</b> <b>folks</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{settlements}} are sending up," [...] he said. [...] "A trooper has just come in with the mail, and he left the freighter and his beasts held up by the snow." ...|$|E
5000|$|King {{was one of}} the {{earliest}} recorded Kings of the Claddagh. The Galway Vindicator of 12 May 1887 stated that [...] "This custom of appointing their own ruler prevails among <b>the</b> Claddagh <b>folk</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> present day, with the difference that, in place of an annual election, the distinction seems to have become vested in one family, whose name, curiously enough, is King." ...|$|R

60|$|While Mr. Appleby was {{negotiating}} with Mrs. Wadsworth and Mrs. Basswood for the loan of several pieces of rustic furniture which the bungalows contained, Della Ford and her aunt visited with the boys. The young actress {{wanted to know}} all about what <b>the</b> young <b>folks</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> bungalows had been doing, and expressed her delight <b>at</b> <b>the</b> cosiness of the place, and its beautiful surroundings.|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{have been}} hired {{to play on the}} grounds to-day, Teddy, and left home half an hour earlier than the {{specified}} time {{for the sole purpose of}} giving you a serenade to show that, whatever your uncle may say, <b>the</b> <b>folks</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Run are positive there isn't a shadow of truth in his ridiculous story. We know what you are working for, and intend to help you along as much as possible." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Just so," [...] said Featherstone dryly. [...] "For all that, I think I'll start east, {{and then}} get on to a west-bound train at a station down the line. <b>The</b> <b>folks</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Crossing know I'm going home, and I don't want to put Daly on my track." [...] He smoked {{in silence for a}} few moments, and then added: [...] "I wonder whether Austin helped the fellow to get after me?" ...|$|E
60|$|She {{received}} us in {{the main}} room of the house, a kind of parlour and hall, with great brown beams of timber across it, which Mr. Tibbets is apt to point out with some exultation, observing, that they don't put such timber in houses now-a-days. The furniture was old-fashioned, strong, and highly polished; the walls were hung with coloured prints {{of the story of}} the Prodigal Son, who was represented in a red coat and leather breeches. Over the fire-place was a blunderbuss, and a hard-favoured likeness of Ready-Money Jack, taken {{when he was a young}} man, by the same artist that painted the tavern sign; his mother having taken a notion that the Tibbets had as much right to have a gallery of family portraits as <b>the</b> <b>folks</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Hall.|$|E

6000|$|There {{was silence}} for several minutes, for the {{struggle}} in Adam's mind was not easily decided. Facile natures, whose emotions have little permanence, can hardly understand how much inward resistance he overcame before {{he rose from}} his seat and turned towards Arthur. Arthur heard the movement, and turning round, met the sad but softened look with which Adam said, [...] "It's true what you say, sir. I'm hard--it's in my nature. I was too hard with my father, for doing wrong. I've been a bit hard t' everybody but her. I felt as if nobody pitied her enough--her suffering cut into me so; and when I thought <b>the</b> <b>folks</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> farm were too hard with her, I said I'd never be hard to anybody myself again. But feeling overmuch about her has perhaps made me unfair to you. I've known what it is {{in my life to}} repent and feel it's too late. I felt I'd been too harsh to my father when he was gone from me--I feel it now, when I think of him. I've no right to be hard towards them as have done wrong and repent." ...|$|E
60|$|Smirke had one confidante for his passion--that most injudicious woman, Madame Fribsby. How {{she became}} Madame Fribsby, nobody knows: {{she had left}} Clavering {{to go to a}} milliner's in London as Miss Fribsby--she pretended that she had got the rank in Paris during her {{residence}} in that city. But how could the French king, were he ever so much disposed, give her any such title? We shall not inquire into this mystery, however. Suffice to say, she went away from home a bouncing young lass; she returned a rather elderly character, with a Madonna front and a melancholy countenance--bought the late Mrs. Harbottle's business for a song--took her elderly mother to live with her; was very good to the poor, was constant at church, and had the best of characters. But {{there was no one in}} all Clavering, not Mrs. Portman herself, who read so many novels as Madame Fribsby. She had plenty of time for this amusement, for, in truth, very few people besides <b>the</b> <b>folks</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Rectory and Fairoaks employed her; and by a perpetual perusal of such works (which were by no means so moral or edifying in the days of which we write, as they are at present) she had got to be so absurdly sentimental, that in her eyes life was nothing but an immense love-match; and she never could see two people together, but she fancied they were dying for one another.|$|E
60|$|Thus it was {{not only}} Mr. Pestler, the medical man, but Mr. Linton the young assistant, who doctored the servant maids and small tradesmen, and might be seen any day reading the Times in the surgery, who openly {{declared}} himself the slave of Mrs. Osborne. He was a personable young gentleman, more welcome at Mrs. Sedley's lodgings than his principal; and if anything went wrong with Georgy, he would drop in twice or thrice in the day to see the little chap, and without so much as the thought of a fee. He would abstract lozenges, tamarinds, and other produce from the surgery-drawers for little Georgy's benefit, and compounded draughts and mixtures for him of miraculous sweetness, so that it was quite a pleasure to the child to be ailing. He and Pestler, his chief, sat up two whole nights by the boy in that momentous and awful week when Georgy had the measles; and when you would have thought, from the mother's terror, that there had never been measles in the world before. Would they have done as much for other people? Did they sit up for <b>the</b> <b>folks</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Pineries, when Ralph Plantagenet, and Gwendoline, and Guinever Mango had the same juvenile complaint? Did they sit up for little Mary Clapp, the landlord's daughter, who actually caught the disease of little Georgy? Truth compels one to say, no. They slept quite undisturbed, {{at least as far as}} she was concerned--pronounced hers to be a slight case, which would almost cure itself, sent her in a draught or two, and threw in bark when the child rallied, with perfect indifference, and just for form's sake.|$|E
5000|$|... 2010 VerLin {{along with}} music partner Billy Brandt won <b>the</b> <b>Folk</b> Artist/Act award <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Detroit Music Awards with 4 {{nominations}} in different categories. Her song [...] "Gravity Down" [...] won the Black Crystal Songwriting Challenge.|$|R
5000|$|Closely {{involved}} with <b>the</b> <b>folk</b> scene <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time, she met Paul Simon who {{invited her to}} New York where she contributed to the track [...] "Fakin' It" [...] on the Simon & Garfunkel album Bookends on which she says {{in the middle of}} the song, [...] "Good morning, Mr Leitch, have you had a busy day?"

60|$|But {{in spite}} of organ and window, in {{consequence}} of the latter very likely, which {{had come out of}} a Papistical place of worship and was blazoned all over with idolatry, Clavering New Church prospered scandalously in the teeth of Orthodoxy; and many of the Doctor's congregation deserted to Mr. Simcoe and the honourable woman his wife. Their efforts had thinned the very Ebenezer hard by them, which building before Simcoe's advent used to be so full, that you could see the backs of the congregation squeezing out of the arched windows thereof. Mr. Simcoe's tracts fluttered into the doors of all the Doctor's cottages, and were taken as greedily as honest Mrs. Portman's soup, with the quality of which the graceless people found fault. With <b>the</b> <b>folks</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Ribbon Factory situated by the weir on the Brawl side, and round which the Low Town had grown, Orthodoxy could make no way at all. Quiet Miss Myra was put out of court by impetuous Mrs. Simcoe and her female aides-de-camp. Ah, it was a hard burthen for the Doctor's lady to bear, to behold her husband's congregation dwindling away; to give the precedence on the few occasions when they met to a notorious low-churchman's wife who was the daughter of an Irish Peer; to know that there was a party in Clavering, their own town of Clavering, on which her Doctor spent a great deal more than his professional income, who held him up to odium because he played a rubber at whist; and pronounced him to be a Heathen because he went to the play. In her grief she besought him to give up the play and the rubber,--indeed they could scarcely get a table now, so dreadful was the outcry against the sport,--but the Doctor declared that he would do what he thought right, and what the great and good George the Third did (whose Chaplain he had been): and as for giving up whist because those silly folks cried out against it, he would play dummy {{to the end of his}} days with his wife and Myra, rather than yield to their despicable persecutions.|$|E
60|$|Having {{repaired}} {{one day to}} his accustomed {{dinner at}} the White Horse ordinary, Mr. Warrington {{was pleased to see}} amongst the faces round the table the jolly, good-looking countenance of Parson Sampson, who was regaling the company when Harry entered, with stories and bons-mots, which kept them in roars of laughter. Though he had not been in London for some months, the parson had the latest London news, or what passed for such with <b>the</b> <b>folks</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> ordinary: what was doing in the King's house at Kensington; and what in the Duke's in Pall Mall: how Mr. Byng was behaving in prison, and who came to him: what were the odds at Newmarket, and who was the last reigning toast in Covent Garden;--the jolly chaplain could give the company news upon all these points,--news that might not be very accurate indeed, but was as good as if it were for the country gentlemen who heard it. For suppose that my Lord Viscount Squanderfield was ruining himself for Mrs. Polly, and Sampson called her Mrs. Lucy? that it was Lady Jane who was in love with the actor, and not Lady Mary? that it was Harry Hilton, of the Horse Grenadiers, who had the quarrel with Chevalier Solingen, at Marybone Garden, and not Tommy Ruffler, of the Foot Guards? The names and dates did not matter much. Provided the stories were lively and wicked, their correctness was of no great importance; and Mr. Sampson laughed and chattered away amongst his country gentlemen, charmed them with his spirits and talk, and drank his share of one bottle after another, for which his delighted auditory persisted in calling. A hundred years ago, the Abbe Parson, the clergyman who frequented the theatre, the tavern, the racecourse, the world of fashion, was no uncommon character in English society: his voice might be heard the loudest in the hunting-field; he could sing the jolliest song at the Rose or the Bedford Head, after the play was over at Covent Garden, and could call a main as well as any at the gaming-table.|$|E
5000|$|Despite these problems, {{the singer}} and his co-worker {{get the car}} in proper working condition. The singer's wife is {{surprised}} at the outcome, but wants a ride in it anyway.

However, <b>the</b> <b>folks</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> courthouse were not as pleased — it took the [...] "whole staff" [...] to type up the vehicle title, which ended up weighing 60 pounds (27 kg).|$|E
60|$|The {{loss of the}} miniatures {{had taken}} {{a good deal of}} the fun out of Ben, and when <b>the</b> young <b>folks</b> {{stopping}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Wadsworth mansion went out sleighing again, and for some fun skating, he begged to be excused.|$|R
6000|$|Clementina laughed. [...] "No; but I expect you'll think it's {{almost as}} crazy. You {{know how much}} I like dancing? Well, I think I could give dancing lessons <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Middlemount.
