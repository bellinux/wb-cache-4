40|$|Pep <b>M</b> 5, <b>the</b> pepsin-derived N-terminal half of {{the group}} A streptococcal type 5 M protein {{exhibits}} immunologic crossreaction with type 6 M protein, localizing some of <b>the</b> <b>M</b> 6 -crossreactive epitope(s) within this segment of <b>the</b> <b>M</b> 5 protein. Based on the amino acid sequence of <b>the</b> Pep <b>M</b> 5 protein, two structurally distinct domains have been recognized within its coiled-coil structure. We have now found that peptides derived from both the structurally distinct domains of <b>the</b> Pep <b>M</b> 5 protein contain antigenic epitopes. Furthermore, only the peptides from the C-terminal domain of <b>the</b> Pep <b>M</b> 5 protein crossreacted with rabbit anti-M 6 sera, whereas those from the N-terminal domain did not. Consistent with this, sequence analyses of the arginyl peptides of <b>the</b> Pep <b>M</b> 6 protein, <b>the</b> pepsin-derived N-terminal half of <b>the</b> <b>M</b> 6 protein, revealed extensive homology {{of some of these}} peptides with regions within the C-terminal domain of <b>the</b> Pep <b>M</b> 5 molecule. While an arginyl peptide of <b>the</b> Pep <b>M</b> 6 protein exhibits 84 % homology with region 150 - 186 of <b>the</b> Pep <b>M</b> 5 protein, <b>the</b> C-terminal hexadecapeptide of <b>the</b> Pep <b>M</b> 6 protein is virtually identical with the corresponding region of <b>the</b> Pep <b>M</b> 5 protein. These results are suggestive of conformational similarities in the region around the pepsin-susceptible site within <b>the</b> <b>M</b> 5 and M 6 proteins. In addition, one or more epitopes of <b>the</b> <b>M</b> 5 protein that are crossreactive with <b>the</b> <b>M</b> 6 protein may be placed close to the pepsin- susceptible site of <b>the</b> <b>M</b> 5 protein. Previous studies have suggested the N-terminal half of <b>the</b> <b>M</b> proteins to be the variable part of the molecule among <b>the</b> different <b>M</b> protein serotypes. <b>The</b> present results suggest that the N-terminal quarter of <b>the</b> <b>M</b> protein may represent the hypervariable domain of <b>the</b> <b>M</b> molecule...|$|R

In these cases, <b>the</b> <b>M</b> 1 eyespot was almost an exact circle.

On the other hand, 11 individuals showed a distortion of <b>the</b> <b>M</b> 1 eyespot; in these cases, <b>the</b> <b>M</b> 2 white spot was located completely inside the eyespot (Fig.  2 b–d).
