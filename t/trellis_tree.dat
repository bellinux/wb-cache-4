The approach relies on beat and rhythm information extracted from the raw data after lowpass filtering. The beat and rhythm information is analyzed with binary tree or <b>trellis</b> <b>tree</b> parsing depending {{on the length of}} the pauses in the underlying signal. This analysis yields accurate periodicity patterns at macro and micro scales. We illustrate the effectiveness of our approach using music segments from various cultures and explain its use in music classification and content-based retrieval...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{includes}} two parts. The first part is about Turbo code - SOVA system. SOVA {{is based on}} the ML Viterbi algorithm and MAP algorithm. It takes the metric difference between two branches at each node in <b>trellis</b> <b>tree</b> to be the soft decision of the bit. The structure of Turbo code encoder and decoder are described. The soft value is updated in the Turbo code - SOVA system at each iterative decoding. The simulations show this system can realize iterative Turbo decoding and provide low BER in low signal-tonoise ratios for different data rates. The complexity of Turbo code - SOVA decoding system is simpler than that of the Turbo code - MAP decoding system. The second part is about a new phase synchronization method. The method is based on an adaptive signal subspace tracking algorithm and provides very good performance in low signal-to-noise ratio environment. This phase synchronization algorithms is applied to uncoded BPSK, systems with error control coding, Turbo codes, and spread [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Trellis-coded Modulation (TCM) {{is used in}} bandlimited {{communication}} systems. TCM efficiency improves {{coding gain}} by combining modulation and forward error correction coding in one process. In TCM, the bandwidth expansion is not required because it uses the same symbol rate and power spectrum; the differences are {{the introduction of a}} redundancy bit and the use of a constellation with double points. In this thesis, a novel TCM encoder/decoder ASIC chip implementation is presented. This ASIC codec not only increases decoding speed but also reduces hardware complexity. The algorithm and technique are presented for a 16 -state convolutional code which is used in standard 256 -QAM wireless systems. In the decoder, a Hamming distance is used as a cost function to determine output in the maximum likelihood Viterbi decoder. Using the relationship between the delay states and the path state in the <b>Trellis</b> <b>tree</b> of the code, a pre-calculated Hamming distances are stored in a look-up table. In addition, an output look-up-table is generated to determine the decoder output. This table is established by the two relative delay states in the code. The thesis provides details of the algorithm and the structure of TCM codec chip. Besides using parallel processing, the ASIC implementation also uses pipelining to further increase decoding speed. The codec was implemented in ASIC using standard 0. 18 ƒÝm CMOS technology; the ASIC core occupied a silicon area of 1. 1 mm 2. All register transfer level code of the codec was simulated and synthesized. The chip layout was generated and the final chip was fabricated by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company through the Canadian Microelectronics Corporation. The functional testing of the fabricated codec was performed partially successful; the timing testing has not been fully accomplished because the chip was not always stable...|$|E

40|$|Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is a {{wireless}} technology used to automatically identify objects attached to its tags. Its applications span {{in different areas}} such as inventory control, logistics, security and item tracking. Vast majority of commercially available RFID tags use Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) to encode and transmit data. This micro-chip in the RFID tag makes the tag manufacturing process complicated and expensive compared to optical barcode printing. Researchers have brought the idea of removing the micro-chip and using chipless techniques to encode data into tags, allowing them to be passive, printable and low cost. However, chipless RFID technologies have still {{not been able to}} replace relatively expensive chipped RFID tags mainly due to less tag bit capacity. Over the last decade, researchers have mainly focused on improving the chipless RFID tag design and the RFID reader architecture. However, they were mostly using primitive signal processing techniques such as moving average or threshold based detection. The few advanced signal processing techniques reported so far have high computation complexity, hence not feasible for commercial implementation. This thesis presents smart tag detection techniques that are computationally feasible and allowing high tag data encoding capacity. Firstly, four different maximum likelihood (ML) based tag detection techniques have been developed based on the reader architecture and channel knowledge. In addition, all of them are able to operate based on both the time and frequency domain data samples of any frequency domain tag. One of the detection techniques jointly detects the channel as well as the tag type without having any prior channel knowledge or a calibration tag. A fifth tag detection technique was developed for an existing frequency domain tag reader using the magnitude of the tag response. However, these single input single output (SISO) based tag detection techniques suffer from high computation complexity. Two new detection methods have been developed using the likelihood expressions derived in above techniques to reduce the computation complexity from exponential to linear order. The first method was a suboptimal bit by bit detection technique (serial reading) and the second method is a fully optimal <b>Trellis</b> <b>tree</b> based Viterbi decoding technique. Then a novel, multiple input multiple output (MIMO) based chipless RFID system was introduced and a tag detection technique for the proposed system was developed. Finally a MIMO chipless tag was designed which includes a broadband equal power divider, monopole antennas and spiral resonators. It was found that, the proposed tag detection techniques for SISO systems provides significantly higher tag reading accuracy over the existing threshold based detector. In addition, they are capable of operating without a guard-band which makes the tag data bit capacity to be doubled without compromising the reading accuracy. Moreover, the effective SNR gain provided by the proposed techniques can be represented as increasing the tag reading range. All these benefits were achieved without compromising the low computation complexity. The MIMO tag with 2 branches is capable of encoding up to 4 times the total bits stored in existing SISO tags. These smart tag detection techniques are expected to increase the data bit capacity in chipless RFID tags hence produce commercialized chipless RFID systems in future...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Efficient {{implementations}} of the {{sum-product algorithm}} (SPA) for decoding low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes using log-likelihood ratios (LLR) as messages between symbol and parity-check nodes are presented. Various reduced-complexity derivatives of the LLR-SPA are proposed. Both serial and parallel implementations are investi-gated, leading to <b>trellis</b> and <b>tree</b> topologies, respectively. Furthermore, by exploiting the inherent robustness of LLRs, it is shown, via simulations, that coarse quantization tables are sufficient to implement complex core operations with negligible or no loss in performance. The unified treat-ment of decoding techniques for LDPC codes presented here provides flex-ibility in selecting the appropriate design point in high-speed applications from a performance, latency, and computational complexity perspective.

40|$|The varietal {{character}} of wine deriving from non-aromatic grapes originate {{mainly from the}} transformation of odourless precursors, such as glycosidically bound volatile compounds, into odour-active compounds during winemaking. The use of several training systems involves changes in different conditions including exposure to light, intervine distance and vine density. All these factors affect the content of vine metabolites, including the ones that constitute the volatile profile of grape. The objective of this work was to evaluate the influence of different training systems such as little <b>tree,</b> <b>trellis,</b> and four rays training, on the volatile composition of Primitivo grape and the corresponding wine in Apulia region.

40|$|Abstract—Typically, a video {{rate control}} {{algorithm}} minimizes the average distortion (denoted as MINAVE) {{at the cost}} of large temporal quality variation, especially for videos with high motion and frequent scene changes. To alleviate the negative effect on subjective video quality, another criterion that restricts a small amount of quality variation among adjacent frames is preferred for practical applications. As pointed out by [20], although some existing proposals can produce consistent quality videos, they often fail to fully utilize the available bits to minimize the global total distortion. In this paper, we would like to achieve the triple goal of consistent quality video, minimizing the total distortion, and meeting the bit budget strictly {{all at the same time}} on the interframe dependent coding structure. Two approaches are taken to accomplish this goal. In the first algorithm, a trellis-based framework is proposed. One of our contributions is to derive an equivalent condition between the distortion minimization problem and the budget minimization problem. Second, our <b>trellis</b> state (<b>tree</b> node) is defined in terms of distortion, which facilitates the consistent quality control. Third, by adjusting one key parameter in our algorithm, a solution in between the MINAVE and the constant quality criteria can be obtained. The second approach is to combine the Lagrange multipliers method together with the consistent quality control. The PSNR performance is degraded slightly but the computational complexity is significantly reduced. Simulation results show that both our approaches produce a much smaller PSNR variation at a slight average PSNR loss as compared to the MPEG JM rate control. When they are compared to the other consistent quality proposals, only the proposed algorithms can strictly meet the target bit budget requirement (no more, no less) and produce the largest average PSNR at a small PSNR variation.

50|$|For {{their war}} memorial, the Chinchilla {{residents}} chose {{a monument to}} be supplied by the leading monumental masonry firm of AL Petrie of Toowong, Brisbane. The firm was responsible for many of Queensland's war memorials, distributing them via the railways and a network of country agents. Petrie's offered a range of memorial types, but the most common being a digger (soldier) statue standing on a sandstone pedestal which bore a series of marble plates with leaded inscriptions and names; this in turn resting on a granite base. This common type was commissioned for Chinchilla. The cost of such a memorial averaged about £300.Originally the Chinchilla War Memorial occupied a prominent position in the townscape, in a small memorial park in Chinchilla Street, near the footbridge over the railway line. In the early 1920s the Chinchilla branch of the Queensland Country Women's Association (established 1922), {{became involved in the}} landscaping of the park. A 1935 photograph shows a garden with four paths bordered by low bushes, leading to the war memorial, which provided the central focus to the park. Palm <b>trees,</b> <b>trellises</b> and a white picket fence and gate contributed to the park aesthetics. In 1952 nearly half of the memorial park was resumed for road purposes.By the 1970s the town centre had shifted from Chinchilla Street to Heeney Street, south of the railway line; hence in 1977 the war memorial was also relocated. The pedestal, refurbished by the Toowoomba firm of Zeigler's and incorporating the original marble plates but not its four urns, was erected at Fuller Place in Heeney Street, in front of the Chinchilla Civic Centre where it was re-dedicated on 17 March 1979. The new structure was crowned by an aluminium obelisk while the soldier statue, which had been vandalised, was stored at the local museum. In 1992 the Women's Auxiliary of the Chinchilla Sub-Branch of the Returned Services League of Australia raised funds for the restoration of the statue and its relocation to the front grounds of the RSL Sub Branch Hall in Heeney Street, {{on the opposite side of}} the road and about a block south from Fuller Place and the official Chinchilla War Memorial.|$|R
