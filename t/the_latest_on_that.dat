40|$|The article {{analyses}} {{the recent}} German historiography {{on the problem}} of the Liberation Wars (1806 - 1815). The author points out the fact that since the early 1970 s the German scholars tend to revise the conventional conception of the Liberation Wars which was created by the Prussian School of History {{in the second half of}} the 19 th century. First of all, certain doubts have been expressed about the existence of a centralized popular Anti-Napoleonic movement in the German lands. <b>The</b> <b>latest</b> studies <b>on</b> <b>that</b> subject have proved that the struggle against Napoleon and the French occupation was the work of the elites not of average people. In the second place, the thesis of the “historical mission of Prussia” has been completely rejected by the German historians. The closer look at the Prussian sources has revealed that in the years of the French domination the Prussian political elites were elaborating on the concept of the Prussian nation which in some ways competed with the German national idea. Moreover, the Prussian government had no intention to unite the whole Germany under the Prussian rule. Consequently the Wars of Liberation cannot be viewed as a uniform German phenomenon, let alone as a key event of the German national history. The diverse experience of separate German states (Bavaria, Baden, Württemberg, Saxony, and Westphalia) doesn’t allow us to define the Liberation Wars as a necessary condition for building of the German nation. For the reasons given above the modern German historians claim that the period of 1806 - 1815 requires certain revising and reconsideration...|$|R
30|$|Increasing {{evidence}} suggests that cancer stem cells (CSCs) are a key occurrence {{in the process of}} many human cancers. Lung cancer is the most common aggressive malignancy and cause of cancer death worldwide. The research on lung cancer stem cells has been highlighted for many years. Lung CSCs seem {{to play a major role}} in lung cancer metastasis, drug resistance and tumour-self-renewal. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), a class of newly emerging small noncoding RNAs that act as post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression, have been demonstrated to serve as a vital player in fine-tuning a number of biological activities ranging from embryogenesis to programmed cell death as well as tumourigenesis. In recent years, several miRNAs have been highlighted to be specifically expressed in CSCs. The miRNA profile of CSCs is remarkably different from non-stem cancer cells. As such, many miRNAs have been shown to regulate self-renewal and differentiation properties of CSCs. In this review, we present <b>the</b> <b>latest</b> findings <b>on</b> miRNAs <b>that</b> regulate the tumour microenvironment of lung CSCs with the goal to prompt the development of novel therapeutic strategies for patients with lung cancer.|$|R

60|$|As Belton drove himself {{home from}} <b>the</b> railway station <b>late</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> August night, {{he made up}} his mind that he would tell his sister all his story about Clara Amedroz. She had ever wished that he should marry, and now he had made his attempt.

And she would be tender with him, giving him comfort even if she could not give him hope. Moreover Mary might be trusted with his secret; for Belton felt, as men always do feel, a great repugnance to have it supposed that his suit to a woman had been rejected. Women, when they have loved in vain, often almost wish that their misfortune should be known. They love to talk about their wounds mystically,--telling their own tales under feigned names, and extracting something of a bitter sweetness out of the sadness of their own romance. But a man, when he has been rejected,--rejected with a finality that is acknowledged by himself,--is unwilling to speak or hear a word upon the subject, and would willingly wash the episode out from his heart if it were possible.|$|R

40|$|On a {{stifling}} Saturday in Texas in June 1937 a twenty-six {{year old}} African-American musician, Robert Johnson, {{stepped to the}} microphone in a makeshift recording studio in a disused warehouse atop a Buick showroom. Johnson had grabbed a ride west from his native Mississippi {{to make it to}} the recording session in Dallas, one more journey in a life that had been spent by and large on the road.

That he recorded at all came down largely to luck; luck, and the exigencies of the Great Depression, which cut deeply into record company profits and forced the so-called ‘race record’ companies, which sold to an almost entirely black market, to look for cheap talent, Southern performers with local reputations who might appeal to regional markets. Johnson was one of many who caught a talent scout’s ear in the Mississippi Delta in <b>the</b> <b>late</b> 1930 s. <b>On</b> <b>that</b> Saturday in Dallas he recorded fifteen songs, among them a haunted blues called ‘Hellhound on my Trail’...|$|R
40|$|Polarimetric weather radars, {{which are}} now {{becoming}} operational, are using a very limited method to retrieve the polarimetric products, called the STAR mode. It uses robust and low cost hardware but cannot measure the full scattering matrix. The Germany Aerospace Center (DLR) in Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany operates a research weather radar for 25 years now with can receive and transmit arbitrary polarizations for each radar pulse to gather the full scattering matrix. <b>The</b> <b>latest</b> development <b>on</b> <b>that</b> radar {{makes it possible to}} perform multi polarization measurements. This also enables the radar to estimate weather targets properties using different polarimetric measurement schemes simultaneously within one scan and without any time lag. By this, a direct comparison of different measurement schemes become possible and a characterization of systematic estimation offsets can be performed. Furthermore system effects which influence the polarization, like additional phase shifts on transmit in the STAR mode, can be introduced and studied. The full power of the system can be used by scanning with several polarizations like horizontal/vertical, left/right hand circular and 45 / 135 degree linear polarization to estimate precipitation parameters. Besides using the optimal combination to polarization pairs for the retrieval of precipitation properties, faster and better scans become possible by using the polarimetric decorrelation to get more independent samples from the target. All these measurements have to be combined with new calibration efforts on the radar to make meaningful measurements. An end to end calibration of weather radar is always very challenging. As the used radar is not reciprocal and different polarizations are to be calibrated, a completely new calibration system, called polarimetric active radar calibrator (PARC), was designed and build. It is made to measure the polarization purity at least down to - 35 dB. It can handle the non reciprocal behavior of the radar and is fast enough to measure every single radar pulse transmitted. The measurements are performed in the far field of the radar antenna. Therefore the PARC system can be remotely controlled by the radar. This makes a self calibration of the radar feasible. Due to its modular concept the PARC can be easily adapted to other radars as well...|$|R

Among these I saw some letters of the general to the ministry, speaking highly of the great service I had rendered the army, and recommending me to their notice. David Hume, who was some years after secretary to Lord Hertford when minister in France, and afterward to General Conway when secretary of state, told me he had seen among the papers in that office letters from Braddock highly recommending me.

40|$|Obesity poses {{a danger}} to {{childhood}} health and can {{continue to have a}} negative impact on health into adulthood. Currently, about 15 % of children and adolescents in Germany are overweight or obese. Moreover, significant data on the multifactorial causes of childhood obesity that is systematically recorded, regularly updated and obtainable at the nationwide level are not yet available in Germany. As such, the Robert Koch Institute is establishing a population-wide system to monitor the factors that are relevant to childhood obesity (AdiMon). AdiMon will be available by the end of 2017. This paper outlines the methodological approach that is being used to establish AdiMon and describes the current results of the project (the development of an initial set of core indicators). The project began by undertaking a systematic literature review aimed at piecing together <b>the</b> <b>latest</b> knowledge <b>on</b> factors <b>that</b> influence childhood obesity. The factors that were identified were then sorted according to relevance, and appropriate indicators were selected. This was followed up by research into data sources that – as far as possible – provide significant data that are regularly collected but that also provide for regional differentiation. Work is currently underway to analyse these indicators and data sources. Once this work has been completed, the indicator set will be finalised and the results published on the internet. Population-wide monitoring of factors relevant to childhood obesity takes the following types of indicators into account: behavioural factors (such as physical activity), biological factors (such as genetic predisposition), prenatal and early-childhood factors (such as breastfeeding), psychosocial factors (such as parents’ health consciousness), environmental factors (such as playgrounds in the local area), contextual factors (such as a migrant background) and prevention measures as well as measures to promote health (such as expenditure by statutory health insurers). The population-wide monitoring uses the following data sources: epidemiological studies, social sciences surveys, official statistics and geo-information systems, as well as routine, economic and media data. This paper demonstrates that population-wide monitoring can provide significant information about the distribution and causes of obesity in childhood, and thus enable the need for action to be recognised at an early stage, initial approaches for preventive measures to be identified and developments to be tracked over time...|$|R
