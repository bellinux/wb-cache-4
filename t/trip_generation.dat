40|$|Abstract: Considering the {{importance}} of spatial issues in transport planning, the main objective {{of this study was}} to analyze the results obtained from different approaches of spatial regression models. In the case of spatial autocorrelation, spatial dependence patterns should be incorporated in the models, since that dependence may affect the predictive power of these models. The results obtained with the spatial regression models were also compared with the results of a multiple linear regression model that is typically used in <b>trips</b> <b>generation</b> estimations. The findings support the hypothesis that the inclusion of spatial effects in regression models is important, since the best results were obtained with alternative models (spatial regression models or the ones with spatial variables included). This was observed in a case study carried out in the city of Porto Alegre, in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, in the stages of specification and calibration of the models, with two distinct datasets...|$|R

Another significant part for the study is the consideration of different land uses to assess the correlation. This study uses a multivariable regression analysis (MRA) model to analyse the household collected data in order to correlate generated trips to the demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of households. The study results revealed the most significant socioeconomic and demographic characteristics that are associated with quantifying the overall household’s travel behaviours in the City of Jericho. The importance of this paper is derived from being the first comprehensive large-scale travel behaviour study that was conducted for an entire city in Palestine.

40|$|In most {{transport}} planning studies one of {{the first}} steps is the definition of a zoning scheme with which the study area is divided and the corresponding space is disaggregated. There are no clear rules on how to carry out this operation in an optimal way, and the dominating practice is to do it based on experience, trying to mix a certain degree of within-zone homogeneity and the convenience of using administrative borders as zone limits. Firstly, this paper starts by presenting a set of quality criteria for a general zoning scheme and an algorithm that constructs an initial zoning based on a sample of geo-referenced trip extreme points and improves it in successive steps according to those criteria. This kind of zoning fits perfectly well to traffic assignment purposes. But this paper will investigate an improvement of this approach in order to give {{a better understanding of the}} mobility determinants and its externalities on the environment. In doing so, the new zone is determined not only by the <b>trips</b> <b>generation</b> and distribution but also constrained by other indicators.

40|$|Due to {{the fact}} that traffic is {{constantly}} growing bigger, the question of choosing our means of transportation is the biggest factor during traffic planning and transport politics. The purpose of this thesis is to show the difference between sequential and simultaneous models that we use in traffic planning for our calculations of trip distribution and mode choice. The calculation of the logit model consists of three steps. First, we calculate the <b>trip</b> <b>generations,</b> then the <b>trip</b> distribution and last the mode choice. But in the simultaneous model there is a matter of simultaneous calculation of the phases of distribution and mode choice. A specific case of a simultaneous model is the EVA-model by which the calculation of the first three phases runs simultaneously.

30|$|The {{first step}} is to {{quantify}} the demand for parking at these facilities. An important branch of the literature on parking demand modelling focuses on Freight Generation (FG) and Freight <b>Trips</b> <b>Generation</b> (FTG). These works are in search for efficient models that can estimate the number of freight vehicle trips attracted and produced by urban establishments. The mathematical framework used are often econometrics models which takes as inputs covariates such as industry category, establishment area and employment and outputs estimates for the number of freight vehicles arriving to an establishments, usually with a time scale of a single day to a week [14 – 16]. FTG methods provide useful insights on the magnitude of the freight parking problem of an urban area. Some studies went further in using FTG methods to assess urban logistics initiatives. For instance, Jaller. et al. (2013) and Zou et al. (2016) [17, 18] used FTG estimates together with average values of arrival rates and parking durations to assess the needed parking supply to satisfy demand and to evaluate urban logistics scenarios {{such as the use of}} smaller vehicles and the reduction of parking durations. However, to assess the impact of policies at the level of a single establishment, one should also consider the difference in vehicle arrival rates over time and vehicle drivers’ parking behaviour (e.g. willingness to queue or to park illegally).|$|R

50|$|The actual {{analysis}} tool {{used in the}} US {{is called}} the Urban Transportation Modeling System (UTMS), though it {{is often referred to}} as the four-step process. As its nickname suggestions, UTMS has four steps: <b>trip</b> <b>generation,</b> trip distribution, mode choice and trip/route assignment. In <b>trip</b> <b>generation,</b> the region is subdivided into a large number of smaller units of analysis called traffic analysis zones (TAZs). Based on the number and characteristics of the households in each zone, a certain number of trips is generated. In the second step, trip distribution, trips are separated out into categories based on their origin and purpose: generally, these categories are home-based work, home-based other and non-home based. In each of three categories, trips are matched to origin and destination zones using the data that has been collected.|$|E
40|$|The {{rail freight}} carload service segment enables the {{distribution}} of freight volumes down to the unit of single rail cars, and stand as an important alternative to road transportation. However, this service segment {{is often associated with}} significant uncertainties and variations in daily freight volumes. Such uncertainties are challenging to manage since operating plans generally are established long in advance of operations. Flexibility can instead be found in the way trip plans are generated. Previous research has shown that a commonly used <b>trip</b> plan <b>generation</b> policy does not exploit the available flexibility to the full extent. In this paper, we therefore suggest an optimization-based freight routing and scheduling (OFRS) policy to address the rail freight <b>trip</b> plan <b>generation</b> problem. This OFRS-policy generates trip plans for rail cars while still restricted by the customer commitments. The policy involves a MIP formulation with a continuous time representation and is solved by commercial software. We apply the OFRS-policy on a case built on real data provided by the Swedish rail freight operator, Green Cargo, and assess the performance of the policy comparing the current industry practice. The results show that by using the OFRS policy, we can achieve a reduction in the total transportation times, number of shunting activities and potentially also a reduction in the service frequency given the considered transport demand.

40|$|Abstract [...] Remedial action schemes are {{designed}} to avoid wide spread outages after a severe contingency. In practice, these schemes are primarily static. That is, the action is pre-determined for a particular situation based on extensive off-line studies. This paper presents a method for an adaptive scheme based on transient energy analysis suitable for on-line calculations. The approach assumes the system separates into two groups in the first swing after a severe contingency along a key path and that <b>generation</b> <b>tripping</b> and/or load shedding is needed to survive the swing. Based on off-line studies and simple on-line calculations of {{the ability of the}} system to absorb the excess kinetic energy, the amount and location of the <b>generation</b> <b>tripping</b> is determined. This method provides a way to implement an adaptive RAS for different faults and operating points in real-time operation. The IEEE 39 -bus system is used to illustrate the proposed method...|$|R
40|$|The {{theory of}} induced travel demand asserts that {{increases}} in highway capacity will induce additional growth in traffic. This can occur {{through a variety}} of behavioral mechanisms including mode shifts, route shifts, redistribution of <b>trips,</b> <b>generation</b> of new <b>trips,</b> and long run land use changes that create new trips and longer trips. The objective {{of this paper is to}} statistically test whether this effect exists and to empirically derive elasticity relationships between lane miles of road capacity and vehicle miles of travel (VMT). An analysis of US data on lane mileage and VMT by state is conducted. The data are disaggregated by road type (interstates, arterials, and collectors) as well as by urban and rural classifications. Various econometric specifications are tested using a fixed effect cross-sectional time series model and a set of equations by road type (using Zellner's seemingly unrelated regression). Lane miles are found to generally have a statistically significant relationship with VMT of about 0. 3 - 0. 6 in the short run and between 0. 7 and 1. 0 in the long run. Elasticities are larger for models with more specific road types. A distributed lag model suggests a reasonable long-term lag structure. About 25 % of VMT growth is estimated to be due to lane mile additions assuming historical rates of growth in road capacity. The results strongly support the hypothesis that added lane mileage can induce significant additional travel. ...|$|R

40|$|Urban freight {{transportation}} plays {{a critical role}} in ensuring the competitiveness and development of urban economies. Even if congestion levels rise, recent trends in transportation service requirements, such as just-in-time systems, contribute to an increasing proportion of commercial Vehicle Kilometers Travelled (VKT) in urban areas. The necessary high frequency of replenishment operations, along with the reluctance of end-users (retailers, private customers, etc.) to receive shipments outside given time-windows, make the distribution operations less efficient. Starting from the definition of recurring tours types in urban operations, the paper focuses on their application on a real case: Parma, Italy, and the mutual interrelation among typical features: the urban environment, end-users typical behaviours, operational issues, and road traffic congestion. As binding constraints, such as tour length and favourite time slots for deliveries, affect tours design and management, the paper aims at assessing the impact of such constraints and possible consequences on the distribution process efficiency. The paper outlines relevant implications for data collection efforts: no realistic statements about the properties of urban freight tours in relation to their efficiency and contribution to VKT can be made unless there is disaggregated information on tour routing constraints and their temporal dimension, which suggests a revision of usual methods for truck <b>trips</b> <b>generation</b> based on commodity flows. Moreover, the application of the modeling approach to a city with a premium built environment such as that of Parma, can be considered as a step forward compared to those examples applied to less complex urban patterns...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In this paper, {{we propose}} a novel method for tuning {{the amount of}} <b>generation</b> <b>tripping</b> {{that would be used}} in {{conjunction}} with remedial action schemes (RAS) or special protection schemes. The method is motivated by the concept of unstable limit cycles and it utilizes fast eigenvalue computations. Unstable limit cycles {{play a crucial role in}} determining the transient stability margins of the power systems with weak interarea oscillatory modes. The western American power system WECC is an example where the transient stability is closely related to the existence of unstable limit cycles under certain operating conditions. For these systems, fast computational procedures based on estimation of the damping of the interarea modes, can be used for assessing the RAS <b>generation</b> <b>tripping</b> amounts. Eigenvalue based rules are presented in the paper and the results are illustrated on simulations of the phenomena in the standard Kundur two area test system which exhibits an interarea oscillatory mode. Key words: Remedial action schemes, power system stability, dynamic security assessment, unstable limit cycles, eigenvalues, power system dynamics. I...|$|R

40|$|Trip {{distribution}} {{is the second}} important stage in the 4 -step travel demand forecasting. The purpose of the trip distribution forecasting is to estimates the trip linkages or interactions between traffic zones for trip makers. The problem of trip {{distribution is}} of non-linear nature and Neural Networks (NN) are well suited for addressing the non-linear problems. This fact supports the use of artificial neural networks for trip distribution problem. In this study a new approach based on the Generalised Regression Neural Network (GRNN) has been researched to estimate {{the distribution of the}} journey to work trips. The advantage of GRNN models among other feedforward or feedback neural network techniques is the simplicity and practicality of these models. As a case study the model was applied to the journey to work trips in City of Mandurah in WA. Keeping in view the gravity model, the GRNN model structure has been developed. The inputs for the GRNN model are kept same as that of the gravity model. Accordingly the inputs to the GRNN model {{is in the form of}} a vector consist of land use data for the origin and destination zones and the corresponding distance between the zones. The previous studies generally used <b>trip</b> <b>generations</b> and attractions as the inputs to the NN model while this study tried to estimate the trip distribution based on the land uses. For the purpose of comparison, gravity model was used as the traditional method of trip distribution. The modelling analysis indicated that the GRNN modelling could provide slightly better results than the Gravity model with higher correlation coefficient and less root mean square error and could be improved if the size of the training data set is increased...|$|R

Our analysis also shows that the MCA method which is more robust {{to the structure of}} the underlying model, is the simple calculation of trip rates as averages for each category.
