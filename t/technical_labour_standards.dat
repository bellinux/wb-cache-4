40|$|This thesis {{answers the}} {{question}} of whether the European Union (EU) Member States have changed their behaviour in order to coordinate EU common representation in the International Labour Organisation (ILO). The study begins in 1973, when European Political Cooperation (EPC) was expanded to include EU Member States coordination in the United Nations, and ends in 2005. The thesis uses archive records and interviews to measure the level of EU representation (issuing common statements) and voting cohesion. The analysis of EU Member States' coordination is divided into <b>technical</b> issues (ILO <b>labour</b> <b>standards)</b> coordinated through the European Community, and political issues coordinated through EPC/CFSP mechanisms. The hypotheses tested are that technical coordination is easier to achieve than political coordination, and over time the Community driven technical coordination will develop more than EPC/CFSP driven political coordination. The core findings are that technical coordination has developed unevenly across particular issue areas and through time, while in political coordination there is evidence of a strong commitment by the EU Member States to maintaining common foreign policy positions. Liberal intergovernmental theory is shown to be the most useful for explaining EU Member State technical coordination. Key evidence includes an examination of the impact of treaties on common representation and voting cohesion, the continued importance of national interests and the European Court of Justice Opinion confirming the primacy of Member States in the ILO. Institutional theory was shown to be the most useful for understanding EU Member State political coordination. Three cases studies were used: the Arab-Israel dispute, apartheid in South Africa promoting core <b>labour</b> <b>standards.</b> Empirical research highlights the social norms and rules of the Geneva diplomats working on EU coordination. The overall conclusion is that the EU Member States remain first and foremost members of the ILO, and speaking for Europe is a secondary concern...|$|R

40|$|M. Comm. The {{purpose of}} this study is to compare and contrast, through a {{literature}} review, the compliance of the Republic of Korea (ROK) and the Republic of South Africa to the minimum <b>labour</b> <b>standards</b> of the International <b>Labour</b> <b>Standards</b> (ILO). The minimum standards are established as the core <b>labour</b> <b>standards,</b> embodied in the eight fundamental conventions. The ROK and South Africa’s labour laws and labour practices are benchmarked against the ILO’s International <b>Labour</b> <b>Standards</b> (ILS) in order to compare these practices and to establish if these <b>labour</b> <b>standards</b> comply with the minimum standards set by the ILO. The propositions stated are: that the ROK and South African <b>labour</b> <b>standards</b> differ, that South African <b>labour</b> <b>standards</b> comply with the minimum <b>labour</b> <b>standards</b> of the ILO; and that ROK <b>labour</b> <b>standards</b> do not comply with the minimum standards of the ILO. The propositions were verified. The ILO standards are described in order to identify the minimum rules set by the core <b>labour</b> <b>standards</b> as embodied in the eight fundamental conventions. The two countries’ labour relations histories, labour laws, labour relations institutions and rule making strategies are described as part of the labour practices in these countries. The labour practices in each country are analysed and benchmarked against the ILO ILS in order to identify an inconsistency between law and practice. In South Africa, the Constitution includes all international laws when interpreting South African law. The only exceptions are when the Constitution or when an act of Parliament specifically excludes the contents of such a law. The conclusion is that South Africa complies with ILO ILS.

50|$|Supporters of {{international}} <b>labour</b> <b>standards</b> often respond {{by arguing that}} this critique only attacks a particular aspect of enforcement rather than the standards themselves.

The paper {{focuses on the}} four core <b>labour</b> <b>standards</b> recognized in the 1998 ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. Our two models (modelling of the steady-state-per capita income and modelling of the transition of per-capita income to its steady state value) are estimated for a large panel of countries (108) and, then, only for developing countries, for the period 1960 - 1996. We use the Two Stage Least Square Method, to correct for potential problems of endogeneity. For the first model, we find that countries with higher <b>labour</b> <b>standards</b> have a higher steady-state level, all things being equal. <b>Labour</b> <b>standards</b> have positive and robust effects on per-capita income both for the world and developing countries. In the second model, the effects are non-linear.

The {{aim of this}} report is to survey in wich international fora the need of international <b>labour</b> <b>standards</b> has been discussed and wich results the debate has yielded {{in the form of}} proposed or adopted conventions and other legal acts. First of all we find international <b>labour</b> <b>standards</b> in from of conventions and recommendations from the ILO. The ILO has been quite successful in working out internationally accepted <b>labour</b> <b>standards,</b> but there are no effective sanctions connected to the standards. This {{is one of the reasons}} that the possibility of including social clauses in trade agreements are discussed.

On the other hand we find social clauses in NAFTA and in different bilateral trade agreements and unilateral trade agreements. A different approach to promote <b>labour</b> <b>standards</b> is through consumer or trade union boycotts, voluntary codes of conducts or through systems of labelling. In the review of proposed or adopted legal acts we mainly raise questions on how the international <b>labour</b> <b>standards</b> are adopted (for instance uni-, bi- or multilateral), on wich <b>labour</b> <b>standards</b> do the legal acts cover, how is the observance of the acts organized (review, supervision etc.) and wich santions do the acts provide...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the last}} two decades governments have {{increasingly}} contracted-out the provision of public and human services to outside organisations. These contracts were not designed to regulate the wages and other working conditions of the workers employed by the external organisation. There is increasing evidence that contracts for services are being used as a tool to regulate <b>labour</b> <b>standards</b> for workers, usurping the labour law provisions covering these workers’ <b>labour</b> <b>standards.</b> The central objective of this thesis is to analyse how <b>labour</b> <b>standards</b> are regulated through the combination of labour law and contracts for services when services are contracted-out. This is achieved with a case study of NSW government school cleaning contracts. These are amongst the largest contracts for services in the world, with more than 6, 000 employees providing cleaning services. The case study reveals that government contracts for services have taken a predominant role in how <b>labour</b> <b>standards</b> are negotiated, defined, monitored and enforced, while the employment contract underpinning labour law takes a secondary regulatory role. In practice, the cleaners’ <b>labour</b> <b>standards</b> are poorly monitored and rarely enforced with minimal compliance with <b>standards</b> prescribed by <b>labour</b> law or by the contracts for services. The findings of the analysis are significant for three reasons. First, there is a dearth of research to date that considers how labour is regulated through the combination of labour law and procurement contracts. This is particularly important given the prevalence of procurement in the public services arena. Second, the thesis expands understandings of how <b>labour</b> <b>standards</b> for cleaners, as a subset of vulnerable workers, are regulated. This is significant if contracting-out is used as a strategy to undermine <b>labour</b> <b>standards</b> for the most vulnerable workers.

5000|$|The {{traditional}} {{model of}} <b>labour</b> <b>standards</b> regulation has been, {{for most of}} history, within-country or within-jurisdiction legislation and enforcement. However, this model may not be appropriate when competitors in a product market are located in different countries or jurisdictions with dissimilar <b>labour</b> <b>standards.</b> This concern opens up the discussion {{for the establishment of}} international <b>labour</b> <b>standards,</b> which, in turn, require international regulation, particularly in the context of global trade.

50|$|Another {{prominent}} {{argument against}} international <b>labour</b> <b>standards</b> {{is the notion}} that any attempt to harmonise set benchmarks for acceptable working conditions disregards, to some extent, the current state of an individual country’s unique economic and social climates. It is suggested that rather than adopting an internationally agreed upon group of <b>labour</b> <b>standards,</b> sovereign states are better off leaving labour market regulation to domestic policy. In this way, it is argued, a country can tailor a standard such as a minimum wage to the specific situation in that area of the world rather than trying to implement an ill-fitting uniform wage. In a 1996 study, Drusilla Brown, Alan Deardorff and Robert Stern use a variety of theoretical labour models to test the effectiveness of the harmonisation of international <b>labour</b> <b>standards.</b> The study concludes that in theoretical cases, market failures that allow a breakdown in working environment conditions are most adequately remedied by <b>labour</b> <b>standards.</b> However, market failures are not uniform across countries and so {{it stands to reason that}} <b>labour</b> <b>standards</b> should not be constructed in an international way.|$|R
