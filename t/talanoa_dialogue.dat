5000|$|On 16 August, Prime Minister Qarase rebuffed {{an offer}} to {{negotiate}} the legislation, provided that it was withdrawn pending the reaching of a consensus and that it be referred to the Tanaloa talks, a University of Hawaii-mediated forum for government-opposition negotiations that took place during 2004. The Tanaloa talks had been a failure, Qarase said, and it was unacceptable for the opposition to set preconditions for negotiations. [...] "I welcome his willingness to discuss the Reconciliation and Unity Bill with the Government but he has put forward two ... quite impossible pre-conditions. One of those conditions is that the Reconciliation Bill must be referred to the <b>Talanoa</b> <b>Dialogue</b> and secondly we must withdraw the bill even before we discuss it. He wants to start afresh. Now {{this is not a}} trade union. We are running a government, and if he wants to come in engage the Government in discussion on this very important issue, he must come in without any pre-conditions", the Prime Minister declared.|$|E
40|$|In New Zealand policy discussions {{considerable}} {{emphasis is}} placed in achieving ‘quality’ in early childhood services. The use of this concept creates {{a significant amount of}} tension in Tongan early childhood centres, because there is disagreement as to what ‘quality’ actually means. This research study aimed at reclaiming an understanding of ‘quality’ from Tongan perspectives. In order to establish just what ‘quality’ might mean from a Tongan perspectives, I conducted sessions of <b>talanoa</b> (<b>dialogue</b> and discussions) over a period of four weeks. The participants were Tongan early childhood teachers and Tongan parents who are highly involved in various Tongan Language Nests in South Auckland. This thesis captures the perspectives and understandings of Tongan early childhood teachers and Tongan parents about the notion of ‘quality’ in Tongan Language Nests. No one term in the Tongan language translates ‘quality’ but there are several important Tongan concepts which make up a comparable conceptual framework. The research concludes with discussions on defining and measuring ‘quality’ in Tongan Language Nests. In this discussion I advocate the idea that defining and measuring ‘quality’ in this context requires depth of understanding and connectedness to Tongan culture, language, and epistemology...|$|E
40|$|The key {{focus of}} this {{research}} is to understand whether or not higher education in New Zealand is a meaningful form of fakalakalaka for educated Tongan women. This research firstly considers the analytic frames of educated Tongan women derived from theories in literature about Pasifika education, holistic dimensions, fakalakalaka, Tongan culture and identity. Secondly, this research considers these ‘everyday’ frames of thought alongside the images built up from the data gathered from <b>talanoa</b> (<b>dialogue)</b> with educated Tongan women in New Zealand. It is in the comparison of these two aspects of information that we can ‘challenge’ theories in literature, as well as ponder the range of ‘perspectives’ presented in talanoa of educated Tongan women (Ragin, 2011). This consideration of the perspectives of educated Tongan women seeks to inform university educators and New Zealand tertiary sector policy-writers of the significance of supporting the holistic dimensions of learners, particularly Pasifika, in their higher education. The talanoa of the educated Tongan women have been captured and re-told in this study with the hope that it will better pave the pathway of further fakalakalaka for the next generation seeking higher education in New Zealand...|$|E
40|$|This {{doctoral}} research {{explores the}} role of bula vakavanua (traditional Fijian way of life) in implementing community-based marine conservation (CBMC) in Fiji, {{with a focus on}} indigenous Fijian social capital and traditional ecological knowledge (TEK). A combination of western and indigenous methodologies was utilised with a particular focus on CBMC experiences at three case study sites, namely Navakavu (Rewa); Kubulau (Bua) and Verata (Tailevu). The Vanua Research Framework (VRF) developed by Nabobo-Baba (2007) was adapted to elicit stories from these communities based on indigenous practices of talanoa, which literally means „to tell a story‟. I am an indigenous Fijian female researcher, and consequently needed to respect and follow traditional protocols pertinent to females and indigenous Fijians with regards to gender issues and tribal and kinship links. The three key findings of my research are: the interconnectedness of all things in the bula vakavanua; <b>talanoa</b> as <b>dialogue</b> and negotiation to facilitate adaptation of the bula vakavanua to external factors; and kinship (veiwekani) as the hub through which TEK and social capital actions and behaviour are lived out. First, to indigenous Fijians, all creation is interconnected. The common Fiji mud crab 1 (qari) is used as a metaphor to illustrate interconnection between all aspects of the bula vakavanua in an indigenous Fijian world. There is a „crab‟ saying in Fijian society that is translated “I‟ll walk how you walked, mother”. In CBMC initiatives, bula vakavanua (the crab) lives in an environment influenced by other factors, including political, social and economic factors. These factors have to be continually and appropriately integrated into the bula vakavanua so that the crab adapts and flourishes. Second, this integration can be facilitated by <b>talanoa</b> as <b>dialogue</b> and negotiation so that community members and CBMC partners can share, reflect upon and reframe their worldviews, perceptions and ultimately practices. Talanoa is facilitated by developing listening and communication skills that enable participants to clarify, critique and re- 1 Brachyura species. ii align their perceptions. This re-alignment may require the change in norms, behaviour and practices in prevailing Fijian culture in order to adapt to the changing environment. I use examples from my case studies to show where <b>talanoa</b> as <b>dialogue</b> and negotiations have worked and, where talanoa is still ongoing to develop shared understanding and resolve conflicts. Third, kinship (veiwekani) is the basis upon which most aspects of the bula vakavanua are lived out. Kinship may be based on blood links, Vanua links or through marriage. In Fiji both TEK and social capital are embedded within the kinship system of the bula vakavanua. For instance in TEK, skills and knowledge are inherited through birth and reinforced by oral transmission and training throughout the generations, emphasising the embeddedness of TEK in families and kinship systems. The impacts of this research are centred round the three key findings. Indigenous Fijians must appreciate that, just like the metaphorical crab, the bula vakavanua has to continually adapt to a changing environment through talanoa, or it will not survive. These adaptations will require different degrees of change in cultural behaviour and norms {{in order to make it}} suitable and relevant for the current times. The bula vakavanua (or other indigenous way of life) must be appreciated and how it plays out in the CBMC work must be understood, and appropriately facilitated, to help ensure the sustainability and success of the work. NGOs can play a more prominent role in facilitating talanoa sessions for unresolved issues in CBMC work, while indigenous Fijian individuals in the partner organisations can provide a crucial a link between the organisation and the community. The government also needs to exercise the political will to resolve some issues such as legal recognition of community-appointed qoliqoli wardens, MPAs and the issue of qoliqoli ownership by the Vanua. This research is not only relevant to Fiji, but to other Pacific Island sites, or any CBMC sites where indigenous knowledge and way of life exist...|$|R
40|$|Tongan {{migrants}} {{migrated to}} New Zealand with specific purposes in mind. One purpose is for Tongan children {{to gain the}} benefits of good education that New Zealand has to offer. However, {{there is a growing}} concern for Tongan parents and New Zealand teachers and schools about the quality and impact of education Tongan children receive. The study is titled, “Talanoa: A contribution to the teaching and learning of Tongan Primary School children in New Zealand” centres on Tongan parents who are recent migrants from Tonga and have primary school children. The research focuses on alternative approach in teaching and learning pedagogies of Tongan children in New Zealand. The research approach is drawn from Tongan language and cultural practices called talanoa, a communal act of social, political and critical dialogue for a purpose. The methodology is qualitative in design, drawing extensively from Tongan language and culture to research the koloa (values) of talanoa that Tongan parents practise at home. The method of data collection employed is <b>talanoa</b> (critical <b>dialogue)</b> conducted in groups with Tongan parents to capture their perceptions, views and experiences of talanoa in their various homes. In examining this unique context, data is analysed using the Tongan concept koloa. The values of talanoa when explored from the participant’s perspective are more clearly understood. The findings of the study indicate that Tongan migrants’ home practice of talanoa offers a teaching and learning pedagogy which is valued as a best approach in teaching their children. The findings further indicate that talanoa can be extended beyond the homes and into many classroom environments...|$|R
