50|$|The CPU {{operated}} on 36-bit words, and addresses were 18 bits. The Accumulator Register (AQ) was 72 bits, {{or could be}} accessed separately as two 36-bit reqisters (A and Q) or four 18-bit registers (AU,AL,QU,QL). An eight-bit Exponent Register contained the exponent for floating point operations (the mantissa was in AQ). There were eight eighteen-bit index registers X0 through X7. The 18-bit Base Address Register (BAR) contained the base address and number of 1024-word blocks assigned to the program (the 6180 used segmentation rather than the BAR). The system also included several special-purpose registers: an 18-bit Instruction Counter (IC) and a 27-bit <b>Timer</b> <b>Register</b> (TR) with a resolution of 2 μs. Sets of special registers were used for fault detection and debugging.|$|E
30|$|Timer Detection: It detects all <b>registered</b> <b>timers</b> by {{overwriting}} the setTimeout/setInterval functions. The SR-Browser then executes {{these functions}} {{to let the}} SR-Proxy know about the signature of the timer.|$|R
50|$|A {{minimum power}} factor of 120 kgr·ft/s (2.4 Ns) was {{previously}} required to activate the stop plate which stops the competitors time, but since around 2011 the stop plates are no longer connected to timers. Instead regular shot <b>timers</b> that <b>register</b> the last shot fired are used. Therefore, the {{minimum power factor}} rule no longer applies, and competitors are encouraged to use low power factor ammo {{in order to preserve}} the steel targets.|$|R
50|$|Commodore {{embedded}} reduced (just 4 registers) CIA-like logic for {{the cost}} reduced Commodore 1571 inside the C128DCR (See Commodore 128) in a gate array called 5710 which also contains other functions.The 5710 CIA has the serial clock for the fast serial interface hardwired to a CIA6526 equivalent Timer A value of 5, leading to a per-bit time of 5µs on transmission. This is different from {{what used to be}} a Timer A value of 6 in the 6526 CIA in the original Commodore 1571. The 5710 CIA does not contain timer or <b>timer</b> control <b>registers.</b> It only contains two port registers and the register to control the serial shifter and its event.|$|R

The corrections {{are indicated}} in {{red in the}} list below. •Pages 18 of 516, description “Output of the clock with the same frequency as fC, f 8, or f 32 ” for Clock output in Table 1. 13 is corrected as follows: “Output of the clock with the same frequency as low speed clocks, f 8, or f 32 ” •Page 33 of 516, description of register name “Group 1 <b>Timer</b> Measurement Prescaler <b>Register</b> 6 / 7 ” in Table 4. 6 is corrected as follows...|$|R
40|$|The Capstone Senior Project {{consists}} of designing {{some of the}} internal hardware components of a microcontroller in VLSI, using the software package L-EDIT. These components work together to create delays {{that can be used}} to run real time devices and trigger interrupts. The design is controlled by a 16 -bit timer. The user can enter an 8 -bit value into the accumulator and through the register controller, store the value in the specified register. The value in each of the four registers is compared to the lower 8 -bits of the timer value in the comparator subsystem. The four comparators then output a single bit that is dependent upon whether or not the values are equal. Description: The design uses a top-down approach. Figure 1 shows the complete system level block diagram. The system has four main subsystems that need to be designed: the <b>timer,</b> the <b>register</b> controller, the register, and the comparator. The user inputs are the 8 -bit value into the accumulator, the 2 -bit register controller value, the reset to the 16 -bit timer, and the clock. The user outputs are the 1 -bit value from each of the four comparators, and the 1 -bit overflow from the timer. Figure 1 : System Block Diagram 316 -bit timer subsystem: The timer is the main element of the project. As can be seen in Figure 2, the inputs to the system are clock and reset. The outputs are the lower 8 bits of the timer value, which input to the comparator subsystem, and the overflow bit, which is an external output. The timer operates as a 16 -bit counter. After FFFFh has been reached, it sets the overflow bit high for one clock pulse and will restart at 0000 h...|$|R
