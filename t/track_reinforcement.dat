40|$|Railroad ballast, {{owing to}} its {{unbounded}} granular nature, spreads laterally when subjected to large vertical axle loads, which influences the track stability. In this view, large-scale cyclic tests {{have been conducted}} on ballast to explore the role of geogrid in controlling the lateral deformation of ballast and hence improving the track performance. Fresh latite ballast having a mean particle size of 35 mm and geogrids with different aperture sizes {{was used for the}} investigations. Tests were conducted using a modified process simulation test (MPST) apparatus at a loading frequency of 20 Hz, with geogrid placed at the subballast-ballast interface and within the ballast. The laboratory experimental results indicate that the geogrid arrests the lateral spreading of ballast, reduces the extent of permanent vertical settlement and minimises the particle breakage under high-frequency cyclic loading. However, the improvement in track performance is directly influenced by the effectiveness of the ballast-geogrid interface. It is shown that the higher the shear strength at the ballast-geogrid interface, the lower is the deformation and degradation of ballast. In addition, the geogrid also reduces the extent of vertical stress in the subgrade soil. These test results highlight the role of geogrid in stabilising the ballast thus encouraging its use as <b>track</b> <b>reinforcement</b> in railway applications...|$|E
40|$|To reduce {{railway track}} {{maintenance}} costs {{and meet the}} growing demand for rail travel the railway industry needs to significantly increase the performance of old existing tracks and design any new tracks accordingly. In this thesis, a new full-scale laboratory Geopavement & Railway Accelerated Fatigue Testing (GRAFT) facility at Heriot-Watt University is developed to study the performance of both unreinforced and reinforced railway track substructure systems. The new GRAFT facility enables accelerated testing of full-scale railway tracks and innovative railway products under realistic railway loading conditions. The unreinforced track systems represent typical railway tracks in the UK while the reinforced track systems represent sections of track implemented with various geosynthetic products. GRAFT consists of a track constructed within a steel tank. The track comprises a 750 mm clay subgrade layer overlain by a clay formation layer overlain by a 300 mm ballast layer. The track includes three hardwood sleeper sections overlain by an I-section steel beam which has similar stiffness properties to a BS 113 A rail section. Cyclic loading {{is applied to the}} track from a hydraulic testing machine with the centre sleeper directly under the loading actuator. The loading mechanism replicates a repeated quasi static single wheel load on the central sleeper of one half of a 3 m long section of railway track. Based on the results found from the testing programme in GRAFT empirical relationships are developed between the unreinforced track performance in terms of track settlement and stiffness and the subgrade modulus, applied load and number of applied cycles. These relationships fit the GRAFT data presented in this thesis well and it is thought that they could be used (tentatively) to estimate track settlement on track after tamping/ballast renewal/new track. These relationships are shown to be consistent with other well known track settlement models and they indicate that subgrade stiffness and applied vertical load are two of the most significant parameters that influence track substructure deterioration. The results found from the reinforced track tests quantify the improvement in track performance available with each product under various track conditions. Two ballast ii reinforcement products have been tested; XiTRACK reinforcement and geocell reinforcement, along with a reinforced geocomposite used primarily for separation at the ballast/subgrade interface. In addition, a geocomposite product designed to replace a traditional sand blanket, used on the tracks where severe subgrade erosion conditions prevail, has been tested in GRAFT under flooding conditions. The most significant results show that XiTRACK reinforcement can considerably improve the performance of railway tracks while the performance of the track implemented with the sand blanket replacement product indicates that currently a traditional sand blanket with a geotextile separator is the recommended option for tracks with subgrade wet spots. From all the data recorded empirical settlement models are proposed for each of the geosynthetics compared for reinforcement purposes. These models form the basis for reinforced track design graphs that could potentially be used to form part of an initial cost-benefit analysis of different <b>track</b> <b>reinforcement</b> techniques considered for improving track performance and reducing maintenance. In order to use the track settlement design graphs developed within this thesis (in the field) a reliable measure of subgrade stiffness needs to be made on track. A reliable insitu measuring device could enhance railway site investigations. Several in-situ measuring devices that could potentially be used to measures subgrade stiffness and strength in the field have been tested within GRAFT. The devices studied include the Dynamic Cone Penetrometer (DCP), Light Falling Weight Deflectometer (LFWD), Pocket Penetrometer and Proving Ring Penetrometer. The accuracy of these devices is compared to Plate Load Tests (PLT) and unconfined compression strength tests and suggestions towards the use of such devices on track made. The results indicate that the DCP {{has the potential to be}} a quick and accurate in-situ measuring device for railway track site investigations. The GRAFT facility and the results found in GRAFT have been validated using a basic static 3 D FE computer model termed SART 3 D (Static Analysis of Railway Track 3 D). The program has been calibrated to GRAFT by modifying the FE mesh for the dimensions of GRAFT and inputting the GRAFT track properties. The validated results from this thesis have direct practical implications to the railway industry in terms of iii design recommendations on how best to investigate and improve key geotechnical parameters that influence railway track performance and hence reduce maintenance costs and extend asset life. A review of current design procedures used in the railway industry is given and a new design procedure is suggested to reduce track maintenance and offer an optimised design and maintenance strategy...|$|E

40|$|Geogrids {{are widely}} used in {{ballasted}} rail <b>tracks</b> for <b>reinforcement</b> and stabilisation. During train operation, ballast becomes contaminated or fouled due to infiltration of fines from the surface, mud pumping from the subgrade, and degradation, which decreases {{the performance of the}} geogrids. This paper presents the results of a laboratory and numerical simulation to study the effect that coal fines have on the interface between ballast and geogrid. The stress-strain behaviour of fresh and fouled ballast reinforced by geogrid was investigated via a series of large scale direct shear tests in the laboratory and numerical simulations using the Discrete Element Method (DEM). The geogrid was modelled by bonding a large number of small spheres together to form the desired geometry and apertures. Irregular particle shapes were simulated in DEM by connecting many spheres together in appropriate sizes and positions. Fouled ballast was modelled by adding a predetermined amount of miniature spheres into the voids of the fresh ballast. The DEM results were then compared qualitatively with the laboratory data, and the effects of fines on the resulting shear stress-strain of ballast and the contact forces developed in the geogrids are discussed...|$|R

40|$|LKAB {{intends to}} {{increase}} the production of iron ore in the upcoming years. To prevent problems with the capacity along Malmbanan (The Iron Ore Line) {{an increase in the}} maximum permissible axle load is required. The first step is an increase from 30 ton to 32. 5 ton. The vision is {{to increase the}} axle load in 4 steps of 32. 5 - 35 - 37. 5 – 40 ton, where an axle load of 40 ton is the final goal. The report deals with the influence of an increased axle load for each track component. This is in order to present the deterioration of the track quality when the axle load is increased. Different methods of <b>track</b> maintenance and <b>reinforcements</b> will also be discussed. The work is focused on the southern circuit of Malmbanan. Track conditions on individual track sections will not be considered. The work only includes the track structure i. e. signaling systems and power supply systems will not be considered. Economical calculations of reinforcement and maintenance activities is left for future investigations. The working process has included a literature study, field study, computational study and an interview study. This has led to an assessment of to what extent each track component is affected by an increase in maximum permissible axle load. The rail will be exposed to a higher amount of wear, an increased risk for rail defects and plastic deformation of the rail head. Rail damage is most easily prevented by rail grinding and rail lubrication in sharp curves. More extensive measures are to replace the rail with a stronger rail steel or replace with a larger rail profile. The rail fastenings will be affected by higher track forces and are particularly exposed in sharp curves. The rail fastening systems has to be replaced gradually when increasing the permissible axle load. The only fastening device, in use today, that will be approved for 40 ton axle load is the Fastclip and the strongest e-clips with plastic rail pads. The lifetime of the sleepers will be shortened with an increased axle load. A critical factor is the bending moment at the position of the rail {{and in the middle of}} the sleeper. According to the performed calculations all sleeper models eventually have to be replaced, except sleeper model A 22. However, there is a lack of knowledge about the sleeper strength for some models. Strength tests for each specific sleeper model should therefore be carried out. It is recommended that a research study is performed to gain knowledge about the track position and model for all the fastening systems and sleepers along the track. This in order to ease future track upgrades. A higher axle load leads to an accelerated deterioration of the ballast. Ballast cleaning is recommended in the near future to reduce the rate of ballast contamination. The ballast thickness should not be less than 50 cm, according to performed calculations. An increased axle load will cause an increased need for maintenance of the <b>track</b> substructure. <b>Reinforcements</b> have to be carried out on several bridges and culverts. This also applies to the geotechnics, which is mainly reinforced by pressure banks at track sections with poor subgrade. A complete investigation of the bearing capacity of the track subgrade should be performed. This in order to find track sections with insufficient bearing capacity. An investigation of the load carrying capacity for all bridges along the southern circuit of Malmbanan should also be performed...|$|R

40|$|In {{recent times}} the {{increase}} in axle loads and train speeds have posed serious geotechnical issues with ballasted railway tracks, both in Australia and the world. The large deformations and degradation of ballast under cyclic and impact loads, and the low bearing capacity of compacted ballast and impaired drainage often exacerbate track maintenance. In recent times in Australia, geosynthetics have been trialed in ballasted tracks constructed on soft and saturated formations to help improve stability and longevity. Comprehensive field studies on instrumented tracks at Bulli (near Wollongong) and Singleton (near Newcastle) supported by RailCorp and ARTC, were carried out to measure the in-situ stresses and deformation of ballast embankments. The findings of the Bulli Study indicated that recycled ballast could be effectively reused in track construction if it was re-graded and reinforced with geocomposites. The results of the Singleton Study showed that geogrids with an optimum aperture size can significantly reduce deformations of ballast layer by proving improved interlock with the particles.

The degree of sinkage and soil compaction was measured at two soil moisture contents: moist (W = 80 %) and wet (W = 93 %) after each pass. A John Deere 1410 forwarder loaded with 16 m 3 of timber, and fitted and unfitted with bogie tracks, was driven on forest soil covering a 15 kg/m 2 slash layer for 1 – 10 passes. The degree of soil compaction was measured at moist soil (moisture content W = 88 %). The results indicated that on forest silt loam soil the bogie track decreases sinkage in comparison with a conventional wheel with a tire: the maximum rut depths reached were 0. 48 m vs. 0. 71 m (– 0. 23 m) on wet and 0. 22 m vs. 0. 40 m (– 0. 18 m) on moist soils by the 10 th pass (160 m 3 of extracted timber), respectively.

The slash reinforcement constrained rut-forming and soil compaction after all forwarder passes. Cubic regressions between average rut depth and bulk density and cumulative volume of extracted timber were derived for forest silt loam soil with different moisture contents.

Further improvements in the tribological and mechanical properties of NiTi could bring benefit in improving biocompatibility and durability of these devices. Various surface modification techniques such as PVD, CVD, plasma spraying, etc., have been developed and applied on NiTi over years but all of these techniques have different limitations such as poor interfacial bonding at the surface and long production time. This project investigates the feasibility of applying laser gas nitriding technique to improve the tensile stiffness, wear resistance and corrosion resistance of nickel titanium (NiTi). In the present work, a continuous wave fibre laser was applied to perform laser gas nitriding process under a pure nitrogen environment on the substrate of commercial NiTi plates. A Taguchi analysis was implemented in this project to optimize the process parameters for laser gas nitriding. Optimum parameters for nitriding in terms of output power, scanning speed, beam diameter and nitrogen flow rate were obtained. The optimum set of process parameter for laser gas nitriding was subsequently applied to fabricate titanium nitride (TiN) tracks on surface of NiTi with hardness more than 700 HV. With the optimized parameters, different thickness of TiN single track could be produced at {{the surface of the}} NiTi alloy using laser gas nitriding. Two schemes of combining single TiN tracks were investigated: a) parallel longitudinal tracks for studying the effect of laser gas nitriding on the tensile stiffness of NiTi; b) network grid for studying the effect of laser gas nitriding on wear and corrosion resistance of NiTi. The results from scheme (a) indicate that the amount of TiN surface coverage may not be a linear relationship with the increase of the tensile stiffness of the NiTi. Sample with 40 % TiN surface coverage has the highest tensile stiffness. Using scheme (b), with a 47 % and 76 % grid surface coverage, the average wearing volume are 0. 00495 μm² and 0. 00859 μm² respectively less than that of the untreated NiTi. The corrosion resistance of the NiTi is enhanced as well. The icorr for untreated, 47 % and 76 % grid surface coverage was 0. 5 μA/cm² and 0. 34 μA/cm² respectively. It could be concluded that <b>reinforcement</b> <b>tracks</b> or grid of TiN by laser gas nitriding could be effective in improving the tensile stiffness, wear and corrosion properties of NiTi.
