Roy Ascott sees the <b>telematic</b> art form as {{the transformation of the}} viewer into an active participator of creating the artwork which remains in process throughout its duration. Ascott has {{been at the forefront of}} the theory and practice of <b>telematic</b> art since 1978 when he went online for the first time, organizing different collaborative online projects.|$|E

25|$|ISO/IEC 6937:2001, Information {{technology}} — Coded {{graphic character}} set for text communication — Latin alphabet, is a multibyte extension of ASCII, or rather of ISO/IEC 646-IRV. It {{was developed in}} common with ITU-T (then CCITT) for <b>telematic</b> services {{under the name of}} T.51, and first became an ISO standard in 1983. Certain byte codes are used as lead bytes for letters with diacritics (accents). The value of the lead byte often indicates which diacritic that the letter has, and the follow byte then has the ASCII-value for the letter that the diacritic is on. Only certain combinations of lead byte and follow byte are allowed, and there are some exceptions to the lead byte interpretation for some follow bytes. However, that no combining characters at all are encoded in ISO/IEC 6937. But one can represent some free-standing diacritics, often by letting the follow byte have the code for ASCII space.|$|E
