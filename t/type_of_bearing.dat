500|$|PWM drives are {{inherently}} associated with high-frequency common-mode voltages and currents which may cause trouble with motor bearings. When these high-frequency voltages find {{a path to}} earth through a bearing, transfer of metal or electrical discharge machining (EDM) sparking occurs between the bearing's ball and the bearing's race. Over time, EDM-based sparking causes erosion in the bearing race {{that can be seen}} as a fluting pattern. In large motors, the stray capacitance of the windings provides paths for high-frequency currents that pass through the motor shaft ends, leading to a circulating <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>bearing</b> current. [...] Poor grounding of motor stators can lead to shaft-to-ground bearing currents. Small motors with poorly grounded driven equipment are susceptible to high-frequency bearing currents.|$|E

50|$|Electrodynamic {{bearings}} (EDB) are a novel <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>bearing</b> that is {{a passive}} magnetic technology. EDBs do not require any control electronics to operate. They work by the electrical currents generated by motion causing a restoring force.|$|E
50|$|Most {{bearings}} {{are meant}} for supporting loads perpendicular to axle ("radial loads"). Whether {{they can also}} bear axial loads, and if so, how much, depends on the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>bearing.</b> Thrust bearings (commonly found on lazy susans) are specifically designed for axial loads.|$|E
50|$|A {{magnetic}} bearing is a <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>bearing</b> that supports a load using magnetic levitation. Magnetic bearings support moving parts without physical contact. For instance, {{they are able}} to levitate a rotating shaft and permit relative motion with very low friction and no mechanical wear. Magnetic bearings support the highest speeds of all kinds of bearing and have no maximum relative speed.|$|E

50|$|A {{bridge bearing}} is a {{component}} of a bridge which typically provides a resting surface between bridge piers and the bridge deck. The purpose <b>of</b> a <b>bearing</b> is to allow controlled movement and thereby reduce the stresses involved. Movement could be thermal expansion or contraction, or movement from other sources such as seismic activity. There are several different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> bridge <b>bearings</b> which are used depending {{on a number of}} different factors including the bridge span. The oldest form <b>of</b> bridge <b>bearing</b> is simply two plates resting on top of each other. A common form <b>of</b> modern bridge <b>bearing</b> is the elastomeric bridge <b>bearing.</b> Another <b>type</b> <b>of</b> bridge <b>bearing</b> is the mechanical bridge bearing. There are several <b>types</b> <b>of</b> mechanical bridge <b>bearing,</b> such as the pinned bearing, which in turn includes specific types such as the rocker bearing, and the roller <b>bearing.</b> Another <b>type</b> <b>of</b> mechanical <b>bearing</b> is the fixed bearing, which allows rotation, but not other forms of movement.|$|R
50|$|A {{plain bearing}} is simply two {{surfaces}} sliding against each other. Typically, a circular {{step on the}} platform mates snugly with a circular depression in the base allowing free rotation while minimizing side to side motion. A rotary stage built with this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>bearing</b> is usually only used for coarse positioning and is adjusted manually simply by turning the platform. Index marks on either the base or the platform are often provided, allowing for somewhat repeatable positioning of the platform relative to the base.|$|E
50|$|If a shaft is {{supported}} by two bearings, and the center-lines of rotation of these bearings are not the same, then large forces are exerted on the bearing that may destroy it. Some very small amount of misalignment is acceptable, and how much depends on <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>bearing.</b> For bearings that are specifically made to be 'self-aligning', acceptable misalignment is between 1.5 and 3 degrees of arc. Bearings that are not designed to be self-aligning can accept misalignment of only 2-10 minutes of arc.|$|E
5000|$|A {{plain bearing}} (in railroading {{sometimes}} called a solid bearing) is the simplest <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>bearing,</b> comprising just {{a bearing surface}} and no rolling elements. Therefore, the [...] (i.e., {{the part of the}} shaft in contact with the bearing) slides over the bearing surface. The simplest example of a plain bearing is a shaft rotating in a hole. A simple linear bearing can be a pair of flat surfaces designed to allow motion; e.g., a drawer and the slides it rests on or the ways on the bed of a lathe.|$|E

5000|$|Fluid {{bearings}} are bearings {{in which}} the load {{is supported by a}} thin layer of rapidly moving pressurized liquid or gas between the bearing surfaces. [...] Since there is no contact between the moving parts, there is no sliding friction, allowing fluid bearings to have lower friction, wear and vibration than many other <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>bearings.</b>|$|R

Although this review cannot be collectively exhaustive, it may be considered as a valuable guide for researchers who are interested in the domain of AI and wish to explore the opportunities offered by fuzzy logic, artificial neural networks and genetic algorithms for further improvement of conditioning monitoring for different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>bearing</b> under different operating conditioning. Recent trends in research on conditioning monitoring using AI for different bearing have also been included...|$|R
50|$|The {{person charged}} with {{drumming}} up new business during the Depression {{was a research}} engineer named Edmund K. Brown. He developed a new <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>bearing</b> for the company—a needle bearing—that eventually predicated the bulk of Torrington's business. On the heels of Brown's discovery came an important acquisition in 1935, when Torrington acquired the Bantam Ball Bearing Company. Brown's needle bearing {{and the addition of}} Bantam Ball Bearing signalled {{the beginning of a new}} era for Torrington, a future in which the production of bearings would fuel the company's growth and lift Torrington into the upper echelon of U.S. manufacturers.|$|E
50|$|There {{are many}} {{new types of}} ball {{bearings}} in the market which deviate from the original design and/or material of the standard stainless steel ball bearing. For example, a certain <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>bearing</b> has an inward facing curved surface, to prevent the string from rubbing {{on the sides of}} the yo-yo, which would cause unwanted friction when performing intricate string tricks. Other manufacturers replicate this with a similar inwardly curved surface, but use minor modifications. Some high-end bearings use ceramic composites in the balls of the bearing, to reduce internal friction, again making for a smoother spinning yo-yo.|$|E
50|$|Since the 1920s, the ever-growing {{dissemination}} of sealed bearings throughout the manufacturing industries {{has made the}} use of grease fittings less common. Sealed bearings are lubricated for life at the factory, and are sealed such that the lubricant is not lost or dirtied. Grease fittings are far from obsolete, however, and much new machinery is built with them every year (e.g., tractors, lawnmowers, industrial plant equipment, and still a few car and truck parts). As long as maintenance is even minimally attended to (via occasional lube jobs where new grease is pumped into the bearing), this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>bearing</b> and lubrication setup is cost-effective, simple, and long-lasting.|$|E

50|$|In typical {{mechanical}} systems, some <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>bearing</b> and/or lubricant {{must be used}} {{to reduce}} friction at the interface between two components. Reducing friction is vital for minimizing wear on components and preventing overheating. As the relative speed of the components rises, and as the contact force between them increases, the importance of friction mitigation increases. In biological joints such as the human knee, friction is reduced by means of cartilage with a very low friction coefficient, as well as lubricating synovial fluid, which has very low viscosity. Gerhard Scholtz of Humboldt University of Berlin asserts that a similar secreted lubricant or dead cellular material could allow a biological wheel to rotate freely.|$|E

5000|$|... 1899: Employed as {{operating}} {{engineer at}} Gamlestadens Textile Industry in Göteborg {{where he worked}} many years {{to find a solution}} to the problems with frequent break downs in the ball bearings for the main drive shafts. This was caused by the ground conditions with lots of clay that the factory was built on and the shaft bearing supports moved some fractions of millimeters from time to time, hardly measurable, inducing enormous extra forces in the [...] "stiff" [...] bearings that was available at that time. Wingqvist spent more and more time on the development of bearings in general, collecting all sorts of technical achievements and new ideas that was presented continuously on the ball bearing concepts around Europe. In particular he carefully studied the report presented in 1902 by professor Richard Stribeck working at the Institute of Technology in Dresden, Germany, where he had compared ball bearings versus plain bearings from a scientific point of view. Wingqvist soon realized that the ball bearing techniques had a future and that there was room for innovations. On his initiative a small workshop was set up within the premises of Gamlestadens factory where they could carry out tests with different designs and steel materials. In 1906 he was granted a patent for a Single-row self-aligning ball bearing (Swedish patent reg. No. 24160) but this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>bearing</b> had the disadvantage that it could not stand very much axial loads. His work continued in order to find the solution for a self-aligning bearing that also could carry some axial loads.|$|E
