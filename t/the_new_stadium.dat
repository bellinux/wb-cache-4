The club's managing director Keith Edelman confirmed {{in a statement that}} the investment would be used directly to fund for <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>stadium.</b> The collapse of ITV Digital (part-owned by Granada) in April 2002 coincided with news that the company was tied in to pay £30million once arrangements for <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>stadium</b> were finalised.|$|E

5|$|Before the 2007 Major League Soccer season, {{construction}} was completed {{on a new}} stadium at Exhibition Place in Toronto {{at a cost of}} $62.5million. On September 20, 2006, MLS's official website announced that BMO Financial Group had purchased the naming rights for <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>stadium.</b> It is the largest soccer-specific stadium in Canada. It is owned by the City of Toronto, while MLSE, the team's owner, operates it.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, the New Meadowlands Stadium opened, {{replacing}} Giants Stadium. <b>The</b> <b>new</b> <b>stadium</b> is a 50/50 {{partnership between}} the Giants and Jets, and while the stadium {{is owned by the}} New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority on paper, the two teams jointly built the stadium using private funds, and administer it jointly through New Meadowlands Stadium Corporation. The Giants had previously planned a $300-million renovation to the Meadowlands, before deciding in favor of <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>stadium</b> which was originally estimated to cost approximately $600 million, before rising to an estimated cost of $1.2 billion. One advantage gained by owning the stadium is that the teams saved considerable money in tax payments, leasing the land from the state at a cost of $6.3 million per year. The state paid for all utilities, including the $30 million needed to install them. Both teams received $150 million loans from the NFL to pay for construction of the stadium. Representatives from the league's teams voted 30–2 in favor of the loan.|$|E

5000|$|All the {{concrete}} {{from the old}} Stadio delle Alpi demolition have been separated and reused for <b>the</b> <b>new</b> building; other materials left have been divided into types, to be recycled, resold or reused throughout <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>stadium's</b> construction. <b>The</b> reinforced concrete used for the steps has been crushed down and reused as a supporting layer of the soil, with almost [...] of concrete put towards the construction of <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>stadium's</b> foundations. Around 6,000 tons of steel, aluminium and copper were recovered, the re-use of which provided savings {{of more than one}} million euros. The implementation of this sustainable construction policy has ensured a global savings of approximately €2.3 million.|$|R
5|$|In November 1999, Arsenal {{decided to}} leave Highbury and {{construct}} a new 60,000-seat stadium in nearby Ashburton Grove. It was confirmed in October 2004 that <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>stadium</b> would be called the Emirates Stadium {{as part of a}} sponsorship deal with Emirates Airlines. The stadium opened in July 2006; Arsenal's offices were moved to a new building, Highbury House, which was named in commemoration of the former stadium.|$|E
5|$|Levallois Sporting Club, {{the amateur}} club where Drogba began his career, used their {{percentage}} of his transfer fees including £600,000 {{out of the}} £24million paid when he joined Chelsea– first to ensure the club's survival, and then to improve their stadium to incorporate modern sports facilities {{for the benefit of}} the local community. They renamed <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>stadium</b> Stade Didier Drogba in his honour.|$|E
5|$|Local soccer {{fans were}} {{concerned}} {{that the lack of}} a natural grass field would hinder Seattle's chances of receiving an MLS expansion franchise.

As a result of Australia's failed bid for the 2022 World Cup, $250 million in potential Federal Government funding for a <b>new</b> <b>stadium</b> was also withdrawn in December 2010.|$|R
5|$|On April 13, 2008, {{rumors of}} a {{construction}} worker burying a Red Sox jersey in the concrete of the new Yankee Stadium were verified after anonymous tips led {{to the location of}} the jersey. The worker, identified as Gino Castignoli, had buried a David Ortiz jersey in what would become a service corridor in the hopes of cursing <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>stadium.</b> After extracting the jersey from underneath two feet of concrete, Yankees' President Randy Levine indicated that the shirt would be donated to the Jimmy Fund to be auctioned for the charity long associated with the Red Sox. Whatever curse was intended failed to bear fruit with the Yankees winning the World Series in their first year at <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>stadium.</b>|$|E
5|$|Plans {{to develop}} a new stadium and {{training}} facilities near Westhill, close to the newly developed Aberdeen Western Peripheral Route, were announced in May 2016. The site's training facilities are scheduled to be operational by 2018, while the stadium could be ready ahead of the 2019–20 season. <b>The</b> <b>new</b> <b>stadium</b> is expected to have a similar capacity to Pittodrie Stadium.|$|E
5|$|The {{options for}} <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>stadium</b> {{included}} adding a third tier {{to the existing}} National Stadium, or moving to a new site. This last option was discounted {{because it would have}} required a vast car parking facility, and that would have put severe short-term pressures on the local transport infrastructure, creating traffic jams and pollution. The committee eventually chose a new stadium on the same site but with considerable increase in its capacity. It would also involve moving the alignment of the stadium from west-east to north-south. This was the option supported by the Millennium Commission. It would become the fourth redevelopment of the Cardiff Arms Park site. It was also decided that <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>stadium</b> should have a sliding roof to accommodate a multi-use venue, with a grass pitch for rugby and football. The only other sliding roofs in Europe at the time were at two Dutch stadia – the Amsterdam Arena, completed in 1996 with a capacity of 50,000; and Gelredome in Arnhem, a 30,000-capacity ground built from 1996 to 1998.|$|E

5|$|As {{early as}} 1999, the St. Louis Cardinals began {{pushing for the}} {{construction}} of a new Busch Stadium as part of a broader trend in Major League Baseball toward stadium building. In early 2002, plans for a new park were settled among state and local leaders and Cardinals owners. According to an agreement in which the state and city would issue bonds for construction, the Cardinals agreed to build a multipurpose development known as St. Louis Ballpark Village on part of the site of Busch Memorial Stadium. <b>The</b> <b>new</b> <b>stadium</b> opened in 2006, and groundbreaking for Ballpark Village took place in February 2013.|$|E
5|$|Carisbrook, the city's former main rugby union venue and {{a former}} Test cricket ground, is at {{the eastern end of}} the suburb between The Glen and the Hillside Railway Workshops. It was the home of Otago Rugby Union until a new stadium opened in North Dunedin (the Forsyth Barr Stadium at University Plaza) in 2011. <b>The</b> <b>new</b> <b>stadium</b> is the new home of the Otago Rugby Union and Highlanders Super Rugby franchise, and met with some {{opposition}} within Dunedin, with objections focusing largely on the cost.

5|$|During the Second World War, Anlaby Road {{was damaged}} by enemy bombing, the repair cost {{of which was}} in the region of £1,000. The Cricket Club served notice to quit at the same time, and so in 1943 the tenancy was officially ended. Hull were forced to return to the Boulevard Ground from 1944 until 1945 because of the poor {{condition}} of the planned stadium at Boothferry Road. <b>The</b> <b>new</b> <b>stadium</b> was finally opened under the revised name of Boothferry Park on 31 August 1946.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{takeover}} of Liverpool F.C. on 6 February 2007 by George Gillett and Tom Hicks, the proposed stadium was redesigned. In November 2007 the redesigned layout {{was approved by the}} council, and construction was due to start in early 2008. <b>The</b> <b>new</b> <b>stadium,</b> provisionally called Stanley Park Stadium, was to be built by HKS, Inc.. It was scheduled to open in August 2011 with a capacity of 60,000. If <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>stadium</b> is built, Anfield would be demolished. The land would become home to the centrepiece for the Anfield Plaza development, which would include a hotel, restaurants, and offices. However, the construction of Stanley Park was delayed following the economic crisis of 2008 and the subsequent recession, which directly affected the then American owners. The situation was worsened because the club was bought with borrowed money, not the owners' capital, and interest rates were higher than expected. Hicks and Gillett promised to begin work on the stadium within 60days of acquisition of the club, but had trouble financing the estimated £500million needed for the Stanley Park development. The deadline passed and the plan was eventually cancelled by the Fenway Sports Group, as their preference was to re-develop Anfield.|$|E
5|$|Gamla Ullevi was {{demolished}} on 9 January 2007 to make {{place for}} a new stadium with the same name, Gamla Ullevi, with a capacity of 18,800. <b>The</b> <b>new</b> <b>stadium</b> was completed in late 2008, but not opened until {{the start of the}} 2009 season. During construction, IFK Göteborg played the 2007 and 2008 seasons at Nya Ullevi.
