5|$|Once a turn is established, {{the torque}} {{that must be}} applied to the {{steering}} mechanism in order to maintain a constant radius at a constant forward speed depends on the forward speed and the geometry and mass distribution of the bike. At speeds below the capsize speed, described below in the section on Eigenvalues and also called the inversion speed, the self-stability of the bike will cause it <b>to</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> steer into the turn, righting itself and exiting the turn, unless a torque is applied in the opposite direction of the turn. At speeds above the capsize speed, the capsize instability will cause it <b>to</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> steer out of the turn, increasing the lean, unless a torque is applied {{in the direction of the}} turn. At the capsize speed no input steering torque is necessary to maintain the steady-state turn.|$|E
5|$|Sources {{differ on}} why the order was issued, speculating that the company wanted the land for a dump site, no longer wanted <b>to</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> the town's maintenance, or decided it was not {{economical}} to own houses anymore.

5|$|During the battle, Keenor {{was badly}} wounded when {{a piece of}} {{artillery}} shrapnel struck his left leg above the knee on 28 July, leaving him unable to walk. An unknown soldier saw Keenor attempting to crawl away from the incoming fire and managed to assist {{him back to the}} nearby medical facilities where doctors were able <b>to</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> his injury. The wound was so severe that army doctors debated the idea of amputating the leg but decided against the idea. He was removed from the Western Front, being transported to an army hospital in Dublin where he spent six months undergoing rehabilitation on his injured leg. Following his return to service, Keenor was stationed in Chatham, Kent as a fitness instructor for the 5th Reserve Brigade. He was later promoted to the rank of sergeant and was awarded the Victory Medal, the 1914–15 Star and the British War Medal for his service during the war. Between 1915 and 1919, Keenor appeared as a guest for Brentford in the London Combination.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth Pearl Corkhill, MM (11 March 1887 – 4 December 1985) was an Australian {{military}} nurse of the First World War. Trained as a {{nurse in}} Sydney, Corkhill enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force on 4 June 1915. After serving in France at the 1st and 3rd Australian General Hospitals, Corkhill {{was assigned to the}} 38th British Casualty Clearing Station near Abbeville on 21 August 1918. On 23 August, while the camp was being heavily bombed by enemy aircraft, Corkhill remained calm and continued <b>to</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> her patients, despite the danger. For her bravery, she was awarded the Military Medal, one of only seven Australian nurses to be so decorated in the First World War. Following the Armistice, she went on to work {{as a nurse}} at various public hospitals, and donated a large collection of her father's photographs to the National Library of Australia.|$|E

Sri tells him that she will ask her sister and has Mahmud hide in a wardrobe. After she leaves the room, Supono and Aminah enter from other doors. Supono, unknown to him, is in a similar situation to Mahmud, and Aminah convinces him to hide beneath a table as she asks Sri.|$|E
5|$|Such proclamations were {{repeated}} across southern Vietnam and in Cambodia, and notices were posted in Saigon, Phnom Penh, the road between the cities, {{and in many}} community venues in rural communities. Long's supporters presented them {{in the form of}} a royal edict on wooden blocks, declaring their intention to attack French military installations. They called on the people to rise up and topple French rule and said that supernatural forces would aid the independence fighters, saying that an unnamed monk would arrive from the mountains to lead them. At the time, southern Vietnam was beset by heavy corvée labour demands, especially with large-scale roadworks in progress. This meant that the peasants had less time <b>to</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> their farmland, and revolts and strikes had been common. The simmering discontent is seen as a reason for Long's ability to gather such levels of support in a short time. Long's supporters called on merchants to flee and convert their colonial bank notes into solid copper cash. Word of the planned revolt spread quickly, leading to a substantial depreciation in the currency.|$|E
5|$|That evening, {{his wounds}} became infected; he {{suffered}} a strong fever and septicemia set in. His doctors considered amputating his leg, but none wished {{to take responsibility for}} so drastic an act. On 19 October, he became delirious and called out for his mother, but the Greek government refused to allow her to re-enter the country from exile in Switzerland, despite her own protestations. Finally, the queen dowager, Olga, George I's widow and Alexander's grandmother, was allowed to return alone to Athens <b>to</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> the king. She was delayed by rough waters, however, and by the time she arrived, Alexander had already died of sepsis twelve hours previously at a little after 4 p.m. on 25 October 1920.

5|$|Eberhardt {{was well}} educated; {{along with the}} other {{children}} in the family, she was home-schooled by Trophimowsky. She was fluent in French, spoke Russian, German and Italian, and was taught Latin, Greek, and classical Arabic. She studied philosophy, metaphysics, chemistry, history, and geography, though she was most passionate about literature, reading the works of authors including Pierre Loti, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Leo Tolstoy, Voltaire and Émile Zola while she was a teenager, and was also an admirer of the poets Semyon Nadson and Charles Baudelaire. At an early age she began wearing male clothing, enjoying its freedom, and her nonconformist father did not discourage her. The children of deMoerder resented their stepfather, who forbade them from obtaining professions or leaving the home, and effectively used them as slaves <b>to</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> his extensive gardens. Eberhardt's sister Nathalie married against Trophimowsky's wishes in 1888, and was subsequently cut {{off from the rest of}} the household. Nathalie's departure had a profound effect on Eberhart's childhood, as she had been responsible for most of the home duties; the household subsequently suffered from a lack of hygiene and regular meals.|$|E
5|$|On September 22, 2004, Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) awakens disoriented in {{the jungle}} and notices a yellow Labrador {{retriever}} (Madison) darting through the bamboo forest. Following the path it came from, Jack runs haphazardly through the jungle to a beach, where he is confronted by the carnage of the airplane crash of Oceanic Flight 815. Jack, a surgeon, administers medical aid to the survivors, assisting the pregnant Claire Littleton (Emilie de Ravin), enlisting Hurley (Jorge Garcia) to watch her, and administering CPR to Rose Henderson (L. Scott Caldwell), saving her life. After the initial shock passes, Jack retreats to a quiet area beyond the beach <b>to</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> his own injuries, when he notices Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly) passing through the jungle. He asks her for assistance, which she gives by helping suture a wound on his back. Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews) organizes a clean-up crew, while Hurley salvages meals from the plane's galley and distributes them to the survivors. Shannon Rutherford (Maggie Grace) refuses chocolate offered by her brother Boone Carlyle (Ian Somerhalder), believing that rescue is imminent.
