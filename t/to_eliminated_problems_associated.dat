40|$|It {{remains a}} {{challenge}} to obtain high-efficiency coupling of far-infrared through millimeter radiation to large-format detector arrays. The conventional approach of increasing detector coupling is to use reflective backshorts. However, this approach often results in excessive systematic errors resulting from reflections off the backshort edge. An alternate approach to both increasing quantum efficiency and reducing systematics associated with stray light is to place an antireflective coating near the front surface of the array. When incorporated with a resistive layer and placed behind the detector focal plane, the AR coating can serve to prevent optical ghosting by capturing radiation transmitted through the detector. By etching a hexagonal pattern in silicon, in which the sizes of the hexes are smaller than the wavelength of incident radiation, {{it is possible to}} fabricate a material that has a controllable dielectric constant, thereby allowing for simple tunable optical device fabrication.

Bearing in mind that HIV has a very high propensity to mutate measuring RT activity to determine the level of retroviral replication has the capacity <b>to</b> <b>eliminate</b> <b>problems</b> <b>associated</b> with divergence, as the virus at all costs must retain an active RT enzyme. We show that two p 24 antigen assays utilizing different p 24 capture antibodies quantify HIV- 1 replication inadequately. We also documented the development (version 1 and 2) and use of a RT assay for the quantification of viral load in HIV infected individuals and SIV/SHIV infected macaques. Finally, we defined RT-fitness as the ratio of HIV- 1 RT activity/RNA (fg RT/ 1000 RNA copies) {{in an attempt to}} determine if mutations associated with ARV therapy alter the fitness of the RT enzyme. Our results showed that the RT assay strongly correlated with conventional methods for viral load determination of both HIV in humans and SIV/SHIV in macaques. Trends in RT-load and RNA-load mirrored each other even under ARV therapy, indicating that both assays quantified the same fundamental process of viral replication, even though they measured two different replication markers. Regarding RT-fitness, the NRTI resistance mutation T 215 Y was associated with reduced RT-fitness, while acquisition of L 74 V in viruses already containing T 215 Y increased the RT-fitness. To conclude, the RT assay documented in this thesis should be considered as a viable alternative for viral load monitoring, particularly in regions where expensive and complex gene-based technologies are not a viable option. Furthermore, RT-load may have the potential to add a further virological fitness dimension to viral load measurement and should be further investigated...|$|R

The nature and level of contamination by RDX and TNT in various soils were determined in an interlaboratory study involving both organizations using EPA Method # 8330. Microorganisms were isolated from the native soils and found {{to be capable of}} mineralizing (92 ̆ 074 CO 2 ̆ 082 liberation) RDX under aerobic conditions when the latter was used as sole nitrogen source. RDX disappearance was accompanied by the elimination of toxicity associated with RDX, as determined by the Microtox test. Studies are underway to use the isolated indigenous strain as a bioaugmentation agent for future site application. Thus far TNT showed more toxic effects than RDX and metabolic analysis showed that TNT was biotransformed into the more toxic amine metabolites. In soil these amine metabolites react with humic acids to give recalcitrant and intractable products. <b>To</b> <b>eliminate</b> <b>problems</b> <b>associated</b> with TNT mineralization in soil we thus undertook a study to first wash TNT out of the soil using several water additives and then treat the TNT washings. Preliminary data showed that mineralization of TNT using sewage sludge under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions was enhanced in the presence of cyclodextrins. Further enhancement in the mineralization rate of TNT was obtained after subjecting the soil extract to photolysis. In an integral study, soil heavily contaminated with RDX (2000 ppm) and TNT (1000 ppm) was treated in bioslurry reactors supplemented with sewage sludge under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions.

One of the most pressing problems in con-current programming has been synchronizing accesses to shared data among multiple concurrent threads. Traditionally, accesses to shared memory have been synchro-nized using lock-based techniques resulting in scalability, compos-ability and safety problems. Recently, transactional memory has been shown <b>to</b> <b>eliminate</b> many <b>problems</b> <b>associated</b> with lock-based synchronization, and transactional constructs have been added to languages to facilitate programming with transactions.

The absence of affordable sensors that provide continuous transpiration measurements motivates the use of estimators. In the case of tomato crops, the availability of estimators allows the design of automatic fertirrigation (irrigation + fertilization) schemes in greenhouses, minimizing the dispensed water while fulfilling crop needs. This paper shows how system identification techniques {{can be applied to}} obtain nonlinear virtual sensors for estimating transpiration. The greenhouse used for this study is equipped with a microlysimeter, which allows one to continuously sample the transpiration values. While the microlysimeter is an advantageous piece of equipment for research, it is also expensive and requires maintenance. This paper presents the design and development of a virtual sensor to model the crop transpiration, hence avoiding the use of this kind of expensive sensor.

The sensing device was constructed by an internal reflection element (IRE) coated with a hydrophobic film to attract and concentrate chlorinated compounds evaporated to the headspace. Factors that influence the analytical signals were studied such as the moisture content, volatilities of analytes, and effect of heating temperature.

Results in analyses of compounds with different volatilities indicated that even with vapor pressure lower than 0. 017 Torrs, quality IR spectra could still be obtained.

Elastic Round Robin (ERR), a recently proposed scheduling discipline, is very efficient with an O(1) work complexity. In addition, it has superior fairness and delay characteristics in comparison to other algorithms of equivalent efficiency. However, since ERR is inherently a round robin scheduling algorithm, it suffers from the limitations of all round robin schedulers such as (i) bursty transmission and (ii) the inability of the flows lagging in service to receive precedence over the flows that have received excess service.

However, the one micron wavelength produced by the neodymium glass that powers OMEGA and other lasers used for fusion research does not efficiently compress the fuel pellet. This happens because the infrared light is not well absorbed by the target, {{and because of the}} creation of suprathermal electrons. These suprathermal electrons preheat the fuel, adding extra resistance <b>to</b> compression. <b>To</b> <b>eliminate</b> these <b>problems</b> <b>associated</b> with longer wavelengths of light, the process of frequency converting the laser beam was invented. This process efficiently converts the initial beam to a beam which has three times the frequency and one third the wavelength. The third-harmonic beam, in the UV range, has a better absorption rate. The PV-WAVE computer program that the author has written has shown that increasing the frequency of SSD (Smoothing by Spectral Dispersion) on OMEGA to approximately 10 GHz as planned will not hurt the third harmonic generation conversion efficiency significantly. The increased bandwidth and increased frequency of SSD will make the laser beams that strike the target on OMEGA much smoother and more uniform than ever before. Therefore it is both safe and advisable to add a second tripler crystal to the OMEGA system and decrease the SSD time cycle to around 100 picoseconds. Since the conversion efficiency remains high up to approximately 30 GHz, more experiments on OMEGA may be carried out with even higher modulation frequencies. These modifications to the existing OMEGA laser should make target irradiation more uniform, leading to more uniform compression and hopefully, a higher energy yield...|$|R

In this manner, the performance of the sampling at the headspace was improved while the problems caused by the presence of water were eliminated. Meanwhile, using a purging channel allowed the sensing element to be regenerated rapidly and enabled automation of the detection process. The parameters that influenced the analytical signals were studied, such as the sampling flow rate, the pH and ionic strength of the sample solutions, the effect of the volatilities of the VOCs, and the regeneration efficiency of the sensing element. The results indicated that the analytical signals were insensitive to the sampling flow rate and to the pH and ionic strength of the sample solutions. The results obtained from the detection of seven different volatile compounds indicated that this method is highly suitable for the detection of organic compounds that have vapor pressures > 1 Torr and that it is potentially usable for organic compounds that have vapor pressures between 20 mTorr and 1 Torr. The regression analysis of the standard curves indicated that a regression coefficient (R- 2) > 0. 99 was obtainable in the concentration range from 1 to 100 mug mL(- 1). The detection limits for the tested compounds were around a few hundred ng mL(- 1) ...|$|R
40|$|Lipocalin 12 (Lcn 12) is a {{recently}} identified epididymis-specific protein that might {{play a significant}} physiological role in male reproduction. However, the detailed structure and function of Lcn 12 remain to be determined. In the present work, we cloned, expressed, and purified the rat Lcn 12 (rLcn 12) protein in Escherichia coil, introduced the Cys 176 Ala substitution <b>to</b> <b>eliminate</b> the aggregation <b>problem</b> <b>associated</b> with the wild-type protein. Homology modeling results demonstrated that rLcn 12 adopted an eight-stranded, antiparallel beta-barrel conformation containing a conserved disulfide bond between Cys 98 and Cys 203, which was {{in accordance with the}} physicochemical properties elucidated by a combination of mass, circular dichroism, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry. The purified rLcn 12 protein exhibited a high binding affinity for all-trans retinoic acid in fluorescence titration experiments, implying that rLcn 12 could be involved in retinoic acid transport in the epididymis.

40|$|The {{ability to}} monitor the cure {{kinetics}} at the fibre-matrix interface and the effects induced {{by the presence of}} silane coupling agents was the main focus of this study. E-glass reinforcing fibres were used as chemical sensors <b>to</b> <b>eliminate</b> the potential <b>problems</b> <b>associated</b> with implanting a foreign body into a composite structure {{in the form of an}} optical fibre. This study demonstrated conclusively that E-glass reinforcing fibres can be used {{to monitor the}} cure of an epoxy/amine resin system in-situ; the data generated via evanescent wave spectroscopy (EWS) using the reinforcing E-glass fibres showed excellent correlation with conventional transmission Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy over a range of temperatures. EWS via E-glass fibres was used to study the effects of the following coupling agents on the cure behaviour: (i) 3 -glycidyloxypropyltrimethoxysilane (GPS); and (ii) 3 -aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APS). The epoxy and amine functional groups in the resin system were affected by the presence of the silane coupling agents during cure. Increased GPS concentration induced faster rates of epoxy conversion, but reduced the final degree of epoxy conversion. The amine functional groups of the curing resin were converted at faster rates with APS treatment, but the final degree of amine conversion was reduced...|$|R
40|$|Formed {{through the}} centuries, {{cultural}} {{landscape of the}} region includes not only the material realm {{in the form of}} numerous historical buildings, monuments and other evidences of local society’s development, but also significant immaterial realm, which manifests itself in the form of spiritual heritage, faith, tradition, customs and language. Interesting, often unique in terms of religious and historical point of view, religious buildings, as well as traditional pilgrimage routes and local shrines are now undeniable qualities, shaping the touristic space of the region. The study of the tourism movement and a detailed valuation analysis of sacred objects showed that the wide ranging cultural tourism (with the significant participation of religious tourism) is a great alternative to still popular, although in many places it is already too saturated, leisure tourism. The historical values and a multitude of interesting, often unique objects with proper promotional activity may contribute to the tourist interest of places that often have been overlooked. The main aim {{of this article is to}} show the spatial diversity of the phenomenon of religious tourism and valuation of the landscape in terms of its usefulness as an area of cultural tourism in the region, so far perceived through the prism of seaside leisure tourism. Valuation of facilities and pilgrim routes by way of grading point while enhancing statistical information on tourism, led to create an image (a map) of the spatial diversity of the religious tourism phenomenon and its juxtaposition with other forms of tourism in the region. Thanks to this type of observations, in the future it will be possible to create a model showing the possibilities of alternative forms of tourism (including religious and cultural tourism) to formulate the touristic space. This, for example, will allow <b>to</b> <b>eliminate</b> the <b>problems</b> <b>associated</b> with the seasonality of coastal and leisure tourism, offering a new, often overlooked spaces of interest in the region...|$|R
40|$|Virtual {{teams have}} become more commonplace in the {{corporate}} landscape of the twenty-first century. These non-traditional teams are typically involved in complex and dynamic projects. They are comprised of members who are located {{in more than one}} geographic location and who rely on computer-mediated communication to accomplish their goals. The primary {{purpose of this study was}} to examine the relationships between various dimensions of virtual teams and team effectiveness. Variables of interest included trust, shared understanding, internal collaboration, external communication, functional diversity, team leadership, and amount of face-to-face communication. Thirty-three virtual teams from high-technology firms participated in the study. Since this study incorporated both individual team member data and project team data into the majority of analyses, Hierarchical Linear Modeling was used <b>to</b> <b>eliminate</b> the <b>problems</b> <b>associated</b> with using regression for cross-level data sets. Three models were developed based on the results of the analyses reflecting the significant relationships between various predictors and the outcomes of overall performance, innovativeness and member satisfaction. The findings indicated that trust, shared understanding, and internal collaboration abilities among the team members had strong positive relationships with effective outcomes of virtual teams. In some cases, the extent to which the team members were geographically dispersed negatively interacted with the predictor variables and lessened their impact on the outcome variables. In addition, teams that were self-managed had higher performance, were more innovative and had more satisfied team members than those led externally. Further, the results indicated that the effect of face-to-face communication varied with the desired outcome. Specifically, teams that brought members together in person tended to have higher innovativeness ratings and increased levels of member satisfaction. Face-to-face communication also positively interacted with internal collaboration, increasing the joint effect of these variables on member satisfaction. The extent that team members communicated with individuals outside the team was also shown to have a direct effect on innovativeness. Finally, functional diversity interacted with trust, which served to increase the joint effect on a team 2 ̆ 7 s innovativeness. These models now serve as a foundation for future research on virtual teams. The implications, limitations, and future research directions are discussed. ...|$|R
40|$|Healthy skin {{is a sign}} of {{positive}} self-worth, attractiveness and vitality. Compromises to this are frequently caused by extended periods of recreation in the sun and in turn exposure to the harmful effects of UV radiation. To maintain strength and integrity, protection of the skin is paramount. This can be achieved by implementing skin-care products which contain sunscreen active ingredients that provide UV protection. Unfortunately, photo-degradation, toxicity, and photo-allergies limit the effectiveness of present day sunscreen ingredients. Currently, this is moderated by physically embedding within inert silica particles, but leaching of the active ingredient can occur, thereby negating protective efforts. Alternatively, this research details the preparation and investigation of bridged silsesquioxane analogues of commercial ingredients which can be chemically grafted to the silica matrix. Studies with bridged salicylate particles detail facile preparation, minimized leaching, and enhanced UV stability over physically encapsulated and pendant salicylate counterparts. In terms of UVB protective ability, the highest maintenance of sun protection factor (SPF) after extended UV exposure was achieved with bridged incorporation, and has been attributed to corollary UV stability. Additionally, bridged salicylate particles can be classified as broad-spectrum, and rate from moderate to good in terms of UVA protective ability. Particles incorporated with a bridged curcuminoid silsesquioxane were also prepared and displayed comparable results. As such, an attractive method for sunscreen isolation and stabilization has been developed <b>to</b> <b>eliminate</b> the <b>problems</b> <b>associated</b> with current sunscreens, all while maintaining the established UV absorbance profiles of the parent compound. To appreciate the technology utilized in this research, a thorough understanding of sol-gel science as it pertains to hybrid organic/silica particles, including methods of organic fragment incorporation and insight on the effect of incorporation method on ingredient leaching and UV stability, is vital. This was afforded by analysis of hybrid fluorescent dansyl particles, prepared by both O/W microemulsion polymerization and a modified Stöber process, which detailed that covalent entrapment of bridged dansyl silsesquioxane is the incorporation method of choice to ensure minimized leaching and enhanced UV stability. As such, use of this method can provide exciting applications in fields where stability and retainment of the embedded ingredient is paramount for efficacy...|$|R
