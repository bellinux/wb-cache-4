5|$|The {{battle was}} still not lost for the Israelis {{although}} the wake was coming, and Laskov considered that his men could not hold {{in front of a}} Legion's counter-attack and he preferred to order the retreat. It was also time for <b>the</b> <b>Jordanians</b> to regroup, their 4th Regiment was completely out of ammunition. 73rd Battalion suffered 50% losses and the whole of the engaged forces had counted 44 deaths and twice that number injured. According to the sources, the Legion suffered between 12 and 20 deaths, including the lieutenant commanding the fort. In contrast, <b>the</b> <b>Jordanians</b> reported 2 just deaths on their side, and 161 of the Israelis.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} was deliberately mined after the Arabs had captured the area. Together with that major synagogue, another 57 Jewish sanctuaries were purposely and systematically destroyed by <b>the</b> <b>Jordanians</b> soon after their {{occupation of the}} Old City in 1948.|$|E
5|$|This time, {{the general}} staff decided on an attack {{concentrated}} on {{the centre of the}} Legion disposal, with several diversion attacks to the north to disrupt <b>the</b> <b>Jordanians.</b> While a battalion from the Yiftach Brigade was performed some diversions attacks on Salbit, Imwas and Bayt Nuba, a battalion from the Harel brigade was to take Hill 346, between the fourth and second Legion regiments and a battalion from the Yiftach Brigade was then to pass through it, take Hill 315 and Latrun village and the police fort by the East. The Israeli operation started with an artillery barrage on the fort, the village of Latrun and the positions around. Hills 315 and 346 occupied with a company from the Legion, were not targeted not to alert <b>the</b> <b>Jordanians.</b>|$|E

5|$|Arab historians {{argue that}} Israel {{had entered the}} Battle of Karameh with too much confidence, since it took place just after Israel had {{defeated}} the Arabs in the 1967 Six-Day War. The size of the Israeli forces entering Karameh made <b>the</b> <b>Jordanians</b> assume that Israel was also planning to occupy the eastern bank of the Jordan River, including the Balqa Governorate, {{in order to create}} a Golan Heights similar situation so as to be used a bargaining chip. Jordanians claim that Moshe Dayan invited Israeli journalists on the previous day for lunch in western Jordan after occupying it.|$|E
5|$|Both sides {{declared}} victory. On {{a tactical}} level, the battle went in Israel's favor, and {{the aim of}} destroying the Karameh camp was achieved. On the other hand, the relatively high casualties sustained came as a considerable surprise for the Israelis. Israel failed to retrieve three dead soldiers, who were left behind in Karameh along with several damaged Israeli vehicles and tanks—later paraded in Amman by <b>the</b> <b>Jordanians.</b> The engagement marked the first known deployment of suicide bombers by Palestinian fighters. Although the Palestinians had limited success in inflicting Israeli casualties, King Hussein allowed them to take credit.|$|E
5|$|A large {{force of}} Israeli {{infantry}} and armor went east {{to block the}} road from Salt to the Allenby bridge, and they encountered the Jordanian 60th Armored Brigade trying to join the defense of Karameh. In the resulting battle, <b>the</b> <b>Jordanians</b> lost eight Patton tanks without destroying any Israeli tanks, then withdrew to the hills to dig in and continue firing down on the Israelis. The Israeli Air Force launched airstrikes against Jordanian armor and artillery positions, {{but was unable to}} stop the firing. Within the next two hours, Israeli artillery fire and airstrikes were launched against Jordanian defenses on the Musri-Karameh road, the Salt road, and east of Abdullah Bridge. The Israelis also consolidated their hold on Karameh with airstrikes and artillery, and began demolishing the camp. A total of 175 houses were blown up.|$|E

5|$|At 6:30AM, Israeli {{helicopters}} started landing {{the bulk}} of the paratrooper battalion north of Karameh. An Israeli aircraft was supposed to drop leaflets addressed to Fatah, after the paratroopers had surrounded the town; however, due to difficult weather conditions, the helicopters flying the paratroopers arrived twenty minutes too late. Met with resistance by Fatah commandos and Jordanian regulars supported by Jordanian artillery, the paratroopers suffered heavy losses. When the southern task force began their drive north towards Karameh, they encountered a Jordanian infantry brigade supported by armor, artillery and antitank weapons. The Israeli Air Force launched airstrikes, but was only able to inflict minor damage on the dug-in Jordanians. Fighting from their entrenched positions, <b>the</b> <b>Jordanians</b> repelled several Israeli assaults.|$|E
5|$|By 20 March, Jordan had {{identified}} {{parts of the}} Israeli 7th Armored Brigade, 60th Armored Brigade, 35th Paratroop Brigade, 80th Infantry Brigade, a combat engineer battalion and five artillery battalions between Allenby and Damia bridges. <b>The</b> <b>Jordanians</b> assumed the Israelis were planning an attack with a drive on Amman, and the army took up positions near the bridges, with the 60th Armored Brigade joining the 1st Infantry Division. Jordan also added most of its armored car, antitank and artillery units to the 1st Infantry Division. The total firepower was 105 Patton tanks and 88 artillery pieces. The infantry divisions were deployed near the bridges, each with a tank company. The artillery was mostly deployed on the higher Jordan Valley ridges overlooking Karameh for topological advantage.|$|E

The operation was successful and all the British captives were extracted, along with their SLA liaison and 22 Sierra Leonean civilians, while the WSB were defeated as a military force. A British soldier and at least 25 West Side Boys were killed in the operation. Many other West Side Boys fled and later surrendered to Jordanian peacekeepers. <b>The</b> <b>Jordanians</b> had received 30 by the end of the day, and 371—including 57 children—had surrendered within a fortnight.
