5|$|The Arabs now {{launched}} repeated {{attacks on}} <b>the</b> <b>breach,</b> but the defenders held firm. At first, according to al-Tabari, catapults manned by four men each {{were placed on}} wheeled platforms, and mobile towers with ten men each were constructed and advanced {{to the edge of}} the moat, which they began to fill with sheep skins (from the animals they had brought along as food) filled with earth. However, the work was uneven due to the soldiers' fear of the Byzantine catapults, and Mu'tasim had to order earth to be thrown over the skins to pave the surface up to the wall itself. A tower was pushed over the filled moat, but became stuck midway and it and the other siege engines had to be abandoned and burned. Another attack on the next day, led by Ashinas, failed due to the narrowness of <b>the</b> <b>breach,</b> and Mu'tasim eventually ordered more catapults brought forward to widen it. The next day Afshin with his troops attacked <b>the</b> <b>breach,</b> and Itakh on the day after. The Byzantine defenders were gradually worn down by the constant assaults, and after about two weeks of siege (the date is variously interpreted as 12, 13 or 15 August by modern writers) Aetios sent an embassy under the city's bishop, offering to surrender Amorium in exchange for safe passage of the inhabitants and garrison, but Mu'tasim refused. The Byzantine commander Boiditzes, however, who was in charge of <b>the</b> <b>breach</b> section, decided to conduct direct negotiations with the caliph on his own, probably intending to betray his own post. He went to the Abbasid camp, leaving orders for his men in <b>the</b> <b>breach</b> to stand down until his return. While Boiditzes parleyed with the caliph, the Arabs came closer to <b>the</b> <b>breach,</b> and at a signal charged and broke into the city. Taken by surprise, the Byzantines' resistance was sporadic: some soldiers barricaded themselves in a monastery and were burned to death, while Aetios with his officers sought refuge in a tower before being forced to surrender.|$|E

40|$|An {{important}} aspect of <b>the</b> study of <b>breach</b> of contract {{is that of the}} need for termination of <b>the</b> <b>breached</b> contract for <b>the</b> recovery of damages. It is suggested that the classification of damages, by describing them, variously, as being ‘expectation’, or ‘loss of bargain’, damages, or for anticipatory breach, gives limited guidance as to whether termination of <b>the</b> <b>breached</b> contract is a prerequisite for their recovery. This short article advances the discrete argument that in order to determine if termination of <b>the</b> <b>breached</b> contract is necessary for the recovery of damages, a practitioner’s enquiries could be more usefully focussed upon ascertaining whether the damages sought to be recovered are in respect of the consequences of the loss arising from <b>the</b> <b>breaching</b> party’s unperformed obligations, rather than adopting the criteria of ‘expectation’, or ‘loss of bargain’, losses, or for anticipatory <b>breach,</b> as <b>the</b> case may be...|$|R
5|$|The Doctor {{explains}} that crossing the Void causes a traveller to become saturated in Void material. If he opens <b>the</b> <b>breach</b> and reverses it, anything saturated in Void material will be pulled in. Everyone except Jackie has crossed <b>the</b> <b>breach</b> {{and is thus}} vulnerable to being trapped in the Void, so the Doctor sends them all to the parallel universe. Rose decides she would rather be with the Doctor than her family and jumps back to help him. The Cybermen attempt to stop the Doctor but are repelled by a converted Ms. Hartman, who has resisted the effects of her conversion and at least partially retains her sense of self. The Doctor and Rose open <b>the</b> <b>breach</b> and hang on to magnetic clamps as the Cybermen and Daleks are pulled in. The Cult of Skaro use an emergency temporal shift to escape. Rose's lever slips, and in resetting it she loses her grip and plunges toward the Void. At the last second, Pete reappears and grabs her, and together they transport back to the parallel universe. <b>The</b> <b>breach</b> closes, leaving a devastated Rose trapped in the parallel universe. The devices used to travel between the two worlds have also stopped working. The Doctor presses his ear against the wall, as a tearful Rose does {{the same in the}} other universe, as if trying to listen for each other.|$|E

500|$|The overall {{gameplay}} received praise. Gaston {{described the}} shooting as [...] "clever" [...] and said <b>the</b> DART-6 <b>breaching</b> abilities have encouraged players to experiment. He said {{the combination of}} <b>the</b> <b>breaching</b> system and gunfights made Syndicate better than some other contemporaneous first-person shooters. GameTrailers' reviewer said the DART-6 system provides players with choice and the recharge time of <b>the</b> <b>breaching</b> abilities tasks players with managing a [...] "micro-economy" [...] that encourages and rewards skills. Both Gaston and GameTrailers said the game missed out opportunities for limiting the use of some of Kilo's powers, which are only shown in cutscenes. Gerstmann liked the game's gameplay and said the control was fun, and that he appreciated the ability to shoot while running. He also admired <b>the</b> <b>breaching</b> abilities and found them satisfying to use. Whitehead shared similar thoughts, saying <b>the</b> <b>breaching</b> abilities tasks players with deploying strategy and make the game deeper than typical run-and-gun video games.|$|R

5|$|The city finally fell on {{the morning}} of 21 May 878, after nine months of siege. The {{defenders}} had withdrawn to the walls to rest and breakfast, leaving a small guard to hold <b>the</b> <b>breach</b> under a certain John Patrianos, when the Arabs launched a sudden attack, firing all their siege engines at once and charging <b>the</b> <b>breach.</b> By the time the patrikios came forth to rally the defence, the Arabs had killed the defenders of <b>the</b> <b>breach</b> and broken through into the city. A detachment that tried to blockade the way near the Church of the Saviour was likewise annihilated; Theodosios writes that the Arabs entered the church, where much of the populace had sought refuge, and massacred them all. The patrikios was left with some 70 men to hold an isolated tower, until he was forced to surrender the next day. Theodosios himself was assisting the liturgy in the cathedral when news of the city's fall came, and was taken prisoner along with the archbishop. Unlike the Church of the Saviour, the Arab soldiers did not mistreat them, but forced the archbishop to reveal the location of the sacristy where the precious liturgical objects where held.|$|E

Ms. Hartman is converted, but Jackie escapes into a stairwell. Jake uses a device around his neck to take the Doctor to the parallel universe and their version of Torchwood.

In the meantime, the Cybermen vanished and <b>the</b> <b>breach</b> began causing unprecedented global warming on the parallel Earth, which the Doctor theorises is the start of the process that will lead to both planets falling into the Void.

5|$|Not having {{expected}} such {{a determined}} {{resistance from the}} Nepalese, Colonel Sebright Mawbey, who was next {{in command of the}} British troops at Nalapani, retired to Dehra until 24 November so that heavy guns could arrive from Delhi. After the reinforcements had arrived, the fighting resumed on 25 November and for three days the fort was bombarded until, at noon on 27 November, a large section of northern wall finally gave away. The British forces, seeing their opportunity, twice tried to charge into <b>the</b> <b>breach</b> that day, but were repelled and pinned to an exposed position just outside the wall. An attempt was then made to fire one of the light guns into <b>the</b> <b>breach</b> to provide obscuration with gun smoke to cover a further attack, but that too proved unsuccessful. The day ended with the British assault force withdrawing after spending two hours pinned outside the wall, exposed to heavy fire from the garrison, and having suffered significant losses.

5|$|Pentecost consults Kaiju experts Newton Geiszler and Herman Gottlieb.

With Pentecost's permission, Newton searches for black market dealer Hannibal Chau who sells body parts of dead Kaiju to obtain a fresh Kaiju brain to drift with.
