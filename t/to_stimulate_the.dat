5|$|The {{location}} of the G-spot is typically reported as being about 50 to 80mm (2 to 3in) inside the vagina, on the front wall. For some women, stimulating this area creates a more intense orgasm than clitoral stimulation. The G-spot area {{has been described as}} needing direct stimulation, such as two fingers pressed deeply into it. Attempting <b>to</b> <b>stimulate</b> <b>the</b> area through sexual penetration, especially in the missionary position, is difficult because of the particular angle of penetration required.|$|E
5|$|Fighting beetles {{are used}} for {{entertainment}} and gambling. This sport exploits the territorial behavior and mating competition of certain species of large beetles. In the Chiang Mai district of northern Thailand, male Xylotrupes rhinoceros beetles {{are caught in the}} wild and trained for fighting. Females are held inside a log <b>to</b> <b>stimulate</b> <b>the</b> fighting males with their pheromones. These fights may be competitive and involve gambling both money and property. In South Korea the Dytiscidae species Cybister tripunctatus is used in a roulette-like game.|$|E
5|$|Long-term active {{memory is}} {{acquired}} following infection by activation of B and T cells. Active immunity {{can also be}} generated artificially, through vaccination. The principle behind vaccination (also called immunization) is to introduce an antigen from a pathogen in order <b>to</b> <b>stimulate</b> <b>the</b> immune system and develop specific immunity against that particular pathogen without causing disease associated with that organism. This deliberate induction of an immune response is successful because it exploits the natural specificity of the immune system, {{as well as its}} inducibility. With infectious disease remaining one of the leading causes of death in the human population, vaccination represents the most effective manipulation of the immune system mankind has developed.|$|E

He found that he could induce different types of responses when <b>stimulating</b> <b>the</b> anterior (lateral) hypothalamus compared <b>to</b> <b>stimulating</b> <b>the</b> posterior ventromedial hypothalamus. When <b>stimulating</b> <b>the</b> anterior part, he could induce fall of blood pressure, slowing of respiration and responses such as hunger, thirst, micturition (urination) and defecation. On the other hand, stimulation of the posterior part led to extreme excitement and defense-like behavior.|$|R

On the condition that the wife would leave the workforce, a loan of up to 1,000 Reichsmarks could be accessed by young couples of Aryan descent who intended to marry and the amount that had to be repaid was reduced by 25 percent for each child born. The caveat that the woman had to remain unemployed was dropped by 1937 due to a shortage of skilled labourers.|$|E
5|$|Native North Americans {{were among}} the first to {{influence}} fire regimes by controlling their spread near their homes or by lighting fires <b>to</b> <b>stimulate</b> <b>the</b> production of herbaceous foods and basketry materials. Fire creates a heterogeneous ecosystem age and canopy structure, and the altered soil nutrient supply and cleared canopy structure opens new ecological niches for seedling establishment. Most ecosystems are adapted to natural fire cycles. Plants, for example, are equipped with a variety of adaptations to deal with forest fires. Some species (e.g., Pinus halepensis) cannot germinate until after their seeds have lived through a fire or been exposed to certain compounds from smoke. Environmentally triggered germination of seeds is called serotiny. Fire plays a major role in the persistence and resilience of ecosystems.|$|E
5|$|Outside {{the lecture}} room before the {{students}} arrived, according to testimony Starling and others gave in court, Starling cut the dog open again {{to inspect the}} results of the previous surgery, which took about 45 minutes, after which he clamped the wound with forceps and handed the dog over to Bayliss. Bayliss cut a new opening in the dog's neck to expose the lingual nerves of the salivary glands, to which he attached electrodes. The aim was <b>to</b> <b>stimulate</b> <b>the</b> nerves with electricity to demonstrate that salivary pressure was independent of blood pressure. The dog was then carried to the lecture theatre, stretched on his back on an operating board, with his legs tied to the board, his head clamped and his mouth muzzled.|$|E

5|$|The Great Depression, {{although}} negative to {{the local}} economy, also benefited the San Diego State Teachers College, {{as the federal government}} made money available for construction projects in an attempt <b>to</b> <b>stimulate</b> <b>the</b> economy. For the campus, some of these construction projects included new buildings (such as a $500,000 stadium completed in 1936 and a $200,000 open air theater completed in 1941), facilities, and art works. Several federal programs were also created to give jobs to students and to increase financial aid.|$|E
5|$|The {{opening of}} {{extensions}} of the Piccadilly line to Uxbridge, Hounslow and Cockfosters followed in 1933. On the Metropolitan Railway, Ashfield and Pick instigated a rationalisation of services. The barely used and loss-making Brill and Verney Junction branches beyond Aylesbury were closed in 1935 and 1936. Freight services were reduced and electrification of the remaining steam operated sections of the line was planned. In 1935, the availability of government-backed loans <b>to</b> <b>stimulate</b> <b>the</b> flagging economy allowed Ashfield and Pick to promote system-wide improvements under the New Works Programme for 1935–1940, including {{the transfer of the}} Metropolitan line's Stanmore services to the Bakerloo line in 1939, the Northern line's Northern Heights project and extension of the Central line to Ongar and Denham.|$|E

5|$|Titanium is {{non-toxic}} even {{in large}} doses {{and does not}} play any natural role inside the human body. An estimated quantity of 0.8 milligrams of titanium is ingested by humans each day, but most passes through without being absorbed in the tissues. It does, however, sometimes bio-accumulate in tissues that contain silica. One study indicates a possible connection between titanium and yellow nail syndrome. An unknown mechanism in plants may use titanium <b>to</b> <b>stimulate</b> <b>the</b> production of carbohydrates and encourage growth. This may explain why most plants contain about 1 part per million (ppm) of titanium, food plants have about 2 ppm, and horsetail and nettle contain up to 80 ppm.|$|E

5|$|About {{three-quarters of}} dietary calcium is from dairy {{products}} and grains, the rest being {{accounted for by}} vegetables, protein-rich foods, fruits, sugar, fats, and oil. Calcium supplementation is controversial, as the bioavailability of calcium {{is strongly dependent on}} the solubility of the salt involved: calcium citrate, malate, and lactate are highly bioavailable while the oxalate is much less so. The intestine absorbs about one-third of calcium eaten as the free ion, and plasma calcium level is then regulated by the kidneys. Parathyroid hormone and vitamin D promote the formation of bone by allowing and enhancing the deposition of calcium ions there, allowing rapid bone turnover without affecting bone mass or mineral content. When plasma calcium levels fall, cell surface receptors are activated and the secretion of parathyroid hormone occurs; it then proceeds <b>to</b> <b>stimulate</b> <b>the</b> entry of calcium into the plasma pool by taking it from targeted kidney, gut, and bone cells, with the bone-forming action of parathyroid hormone being antagonised by calcitonin, whose secretion increases with increasing plasma calcium levels.|$|E
5|$|Ely Rabin and Andrew M. Gordon {{reported}} in 2004 in the Journal of Applied Physiology on {{their use of}} the Magic Wand to create vibrations in the left biceps brachia to study proprioception signals in humans related to fingertip contact on surfaces. Rabin and Gordon followed up their research in 2006 with a subsequent paper published in the journal Experimental Brain Research. They wrote that extension of muscles and sensory clues worked together to provide regional perception of the patient's upper extremity in a localized area. Rabin and Gordon later co-wrote a 2010 paper with additional authors in Neuroscience Letters and expanded on research incorporating use of the Magic Wand <b>to</b> <b>stimulate</b> <b>the</b> biceps brachia. They measured people suffering Parkinson's disease (PD) for proprioceptive ability while their subjects' biceps muscles were stimulated with the vibrator. In 2007, researchers published a paper in the journal Gait & Posture about use of the Magic Wand to help measure balance and postural sway. While testing their subjects' balance while having to deal with simultaneous vibration, the researchers attached one Magic Wand to each leg.|$|E
