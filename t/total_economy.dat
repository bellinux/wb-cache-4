The standard measure of the <b>total</b> <b>economy’s</b> labour input is to aggregate the number of people employed.

Both of these labour measures assume that all workers in the economy are equally productive. This paper is concerned with achieving a more accurate measure of the total labour input in the economy by adjusting standard labour indicators for labour quality. ...|$|R
500|$|With [...] {{of coastal}} belt, 400,000 {{hectares}} of inland water resources and approximately 220,000 active fishermen, Kerala {{is one of}} the leading producers of fish in India. According to 2003–04 reports, about 1.1million people earn their livelihood from fishing and allied activities such as drying, processing, packaging, exporting and transporting fisheries. The annual yield of the sector was estimated as 608,000 tons in 2003–04. This contributes to about 3% of the <b>total</b> <b>economy</b> of the state. In 2006, around 22% of the total Indian marine fishery yield was from Kerala. During the southwest monsoon, a suspended mud bank develops along the shore, which in turn leads to calm ocean water, peaking the output of the fishing industry. This phenomenon is locally called chakara. The waters provide a large variety of fish: pelagic species; 59%, demersal species; 23%, crustaceans, molluscs and others for 18%. Around 1.050million fishermen haul an annual catch of 668,000 tonnes as of a 1999–2000 estimate; 222 fishing villages are strung along the [...] coast. Another 113 fishing villages dot the hinterland. Kerala's coastal belt of Karunagappally is known for high background radiation from thorium-containing monazite sand. In some coastal panchayats, median outdoor radiation levels are more than 4 mGy/yr and, in certain locations on the coast, it is as high as 70mGy/yr.|$|E
2500|$|Rural–urban {{migration}} {{is one of}} the causes attributed to the formation and expansion of slums. [...] Since 1950, world population has increased at a far greater rate than the total amount of arable land, even as agriculture contributes a much smaller percentage of the <b>total</b> <b>economy.</b> For example, in India, agriculture accounted for 52% of its GDP in 1954 and only 19% in 2004; in Brazil, the 2005 GDP contribution of agriculture is one-fifth of its contribution in 1951. Agriculture, meanwhile, has also become higher yielding, less disease prone, less physically harsh and more efficient with tractors and other equipment. The proportion of people working in agriculture has declined by 30% over the last 50 years, while global population has increased by 250%.|$|E
2500|$|In November 2010, a study {{conducted}} by the University of Montana Bureau of Business and Economic Research found that health care was now the largest sector of the Cascade County economy. [...] Although the military (represented primarily by Malmstrom Air Force Base) had long been assumed to be the city's economic driver, health care now accounted for 16 percent of the county's non-agricultural earnings, compared to 14 percent for military activities. Benefis, the researchers found, not only employed 10 percent of the county's entire workforce, but also accounted for 10 percent of its earnings. [...] Health care represented more of Cascade County's <b>total</b> <b>economy</b> (14 percent) than in other large Montana cities such as Billings (12 percent) or Missoula (12 percent), or in Montana as a whole (9 percent). Health care also appeared to be the primary driver of economic growth and employment in the county, with health care employment rising 4.2 percent from 2008 to 2009 (while construction, finance, and transportation saw major drops).|$|E
