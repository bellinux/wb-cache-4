There are some times when confrontation is called for.

The conspiracy theory that she was murdered by intelligence agents working for the Manhattan Project was bolstered by the 1975 Church Committee, which revealed details of assassinations carried out by American intelligence agencies, and was depicted in the fictional TV series Manhattan.

He advised his followers to be holy, unselfish and to have shraddhā (faith). Vivekananda supported brahmacharya (celibacy), believing it {{the source of his}} physical and mental stamina and eloquence. He emphasised that success was an outcome of focused thought and action; in his lectures on Raja Yoga he said, [...] "Take up one idea. Make that one idea your life– think of it, dream of it, live on that idea. Let the brain, muscles, nerves, every part of your body, be full of that idea, and just leave every other idea alone. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> success, that is the way great spiritual giants are produced".|$|E

When they persecuted the Lord himself, they said to him, [...] "For a good work we stone thee not" [...] (John 10:33). Religion that is pure is a hot thing, and it usually burns the fingers of those that fight against it; wherefore it is not common for men to oppose religion under its own naked complexion: wherefore the Jews sought to fasten other matters upon Christ to kill him for them; though the great spite they had against him was for his doctrine and miracles. It was for envy to that that they set themselves against him, and that made them invent to charge him with rebellion and treason (Matt 27:18; Luke 23:2).|$|E
