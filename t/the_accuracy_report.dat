50|$|These {{findings}} were surprisingly disruptive {{to the field}} of natural language processing. <b>The</b> <b>accuracy</b> <b>reported</b> was higher than <b>the</b> typical <b>accuracy</b> of very sophisticated algorithms that integrated part of speech choice with many higher levels of linguistic analysis: syntax, morphology, semantics, and so on. CLAWS, DeRose's and Church's methods did fail for some of the known cases where semantics is required, but those proved negligibly rare. This convinced many in the field that part-of-speech tagging could usefully be separated out from the other levels of processing; this in turn simplified the theory and practice of computerized language analysis, and encouraged researchers to find ways to separate out other pieces as well. Markov Models are now the standard method for part-of-speech assignment.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a dynamic approach to document page segmentation based on inter-component relationships and their local features. State-of-the art page segmentation algorithms segment zones {{based on the}} separation properties of connected components such as distance and orientation, and do not typically consider properties other than size. Our approach uses a combination of component separation and local features. The page is first over-segmented using fuzzy-Voronoi++, a dynamically adaptive scheme of sep-aration features based on [2]. The separation features and zone’s content are then fed to a semi-supervised clustering algorithm to fuse the components based on their location and local features.

40|$|The {{answer as}} to how visual {{attributes}} processed in different brain loci at different speeds are bound together to give us our unitary experience of the visual world remains unknown. In this study we investigated whether bound representations arise, as commonly assumed, through physiological interactions between cells in the visual areas. In a focal attentional task in which correct responses from either bound or unbound representations were possible, participants discriminated the color or orientation of briefly presented single bars. On the assumption that representations of the two attributes are bound, <b>the</b> <b>accuracy</b> of <b>reporting</b> <b>the</b> color and orientation should co-vary. By contrast, if the attributes are not mandatorily bound, <b>the</b> <b>accuracy</b> of <b>reporting</b> <b>the</b> two attributes should be independent. The results of our psychophysical studies reported here supported the latter, non-binding, relationship between visual features, suggesting that binding does not necessarily occur even under focal attention. We propose a task-contingent binding mechanism, postulating that binding occurs at late, post-perceptual (PP), stages through the intervention of memory...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Spatial {{resolution}} {{is the most}} important feature of satellite images which affects <b>the</b> <b>accuracy</b> of image classification. To investigate this issue, three different kinds of satellite images were selected and classified. The MODIS, LANDSAT 4 / 5 TM, and IKONOS- 2 images used in this study were of the commercial and industrial center of Turkey, Istanbul. Before the classification stage, pre-processing methods were applied, such as subset images; re-project images, and atmospheric corrections. An unsupervised classification technique is used for classification of MODIS and LANDSAT 4 / 5 TM images and both unsupervised and supervised classification methods are used for classification of IKONOS- 2 images. As expected, classification results were different, as <b>the</b> <b>accuracy</b> <b>reports</b> revealed. Classification of IKONOS- 2 images presented <b>the</b> highest <b>accuracy</b> with more than 96 %. MODIS image classification presented <b>the</b> lowest <b>accuracy</b> with 88. 5 %.

40|$|The thesis {{focuses on}} {{transferring}} FrameNet annotation from English to Czech and {{the possibilities of}} using the resulting data for automatic frame prediction in Czech. The first part, annotation transfer, has been performed in two ways. First, a parallel corpus of English sentences and their human created Czech translations (PCEDT) was used. Second, a much larger parallel corpus was created using ma- chine translation of FrameNet example sentences. This corpus was then used to transfer the annotation as well. The resulting data were partially evaluated {{and some of the}} automatically detectable errors were filtered out. Subsequently, the data were used as an input for two machine learning methods, decision trees and support vector machines. Since neither of the machine learning experiments brought impressive results, further manual correction of the data annotation was performed, which helped increase <b>the</b> <b>accuracy</b> of <b>the</b> prediction. However, as <b>the</b> <b>accuracy</b> <b>reported</b> in related papers is notably higher, the thesis also discusses dif- ferent approaches to feature selection and the possibility of further improvement of the prediction results using these methods. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Recently, we {{proposed}} a wireless ambulatory gait analysis system that provides a high ranging accuracy using ultra-wideband (UWB) transceivers. In this paper, we further investigate the performance of our proposed system including ranging using suboptimal templates, power consumption, and sensor-fusion. We show that the proposed system is capable of providing a 1. 1 mm ranging accuracy (11. 7 mm for current systems) at a signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) of 20 dB using suboptimal-based receivers in industry accepted body-area-network UWB channels. For the angular-displacement, our system provides an accuracy that is less than 1 ◦ for the knee-flexion angle. This accuracy is superior to <b>the</b> <b>accuracy</b> <b>reported</b> in <b>the</b> literature for current technologies (less than 4 ◦). Finally, we propose the integration of UWB sensors with force sensors. The system performance and design parameters are investigated using simulations and actual measurements.

40|$|Abstract Recently a {{non-invasive}} acoustical {{method has}} been developed to detect respiratory phases without airflow measurement, in which the average power of tracheal breath sounds is used to detect the onset of breaths [1]. We improved <b>the</b> <b>accuracy</b> of <b>the</b> breath onsets detection by applying variance fractal dimension Ds. For {{the sake of a}} comparison, the same set of data as in [1] was used. Data included tracheal breath sound recorded simultaneously with airflow from nine healthy subjects. Variance fractal dimension was used to detect the onset of breaths directly from the time domain tracheal sound signals. Result shows that onsets can be detected by the peaks of the variance fractal dimension, with an accuracy of 40 ± 9 ms. Comparing to <b>the</b> <b>accuracy</b> <b>reported</b> in <b>the</b> previous method (41. 5 ± 34. 7 ms), this study slightly improves the average error but also is more robust in term of standard deviation. It also provides an alternative approach to analyze breath sound signals in time domain.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a new approach}} to Particle Swarm Optimization, called Michigan Approach PSO (MPSO), and its applica- tion to continuous classi cation problems as a Nearest Prototype (NP) classi er. In Nearest Prototype classi ers, a collection of prototypes has to be found that accurately represents the input patterns. The classi er then assigns classes based on the nearest prototype in this collection. The MPSO algorithm is used to process training data to nd those prototypes. In the MPSO algorithm each particle in a swarm re{{presents a}} single pro- totype in the solution and it uses modi ed movement rules with particle competition and cooperation that ensure particle diversity. The proposed method is tested both with arti cial problems and with real benchmark problems and compared with several algorithms of the same family.
