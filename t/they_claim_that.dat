5|$|On 26 December 2002, Brigitte Boisselier, a Raëlian Bishop and CEO of a {{biotechnology}} {{company called}} Clonaid, announced {{the birth of}} baby Eve, supposedly the first-ever human clone. The announcement ignited much media attention, ethical debate, doubt, criticism, and claims of a hoax. Spokespeople for the movement, including Claude Vorilhon, have suggested {{that this is one}} of the first steps in achieving a more important agenda. <b>They</b> <b>claim</b> <b>that</b> through cloning they can combine an accelerated growth process with some form of mind transfer, and in such, may achieve eternal life. Raelians constitute the world's largest UFO religion.|$|E
5|$|Pierce goes to Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), {{showing them}} a TV {{interview}} of the project's leader, Daniel Trepkos (Bradley Whitford); Pierce {{was with the}} project until he and Trepkos had a falling-out. Mulder is reluctant to let Scully come along because of her recent abduction; Scully, however, insists that she is ready. Upon arriving at Mount Avalon, Pierce goes {{out in the woods}} to inspect the project's equipment while the agents search the laboratory. They discover the seemingly traumatized team: robotics engineer Jason Ludwig (Leland Orser), systems analyst Peter Tanaka (Hiro Kanagawa), and graduate student Jessie O'Neil (Shawnee Smith). <b>They</b> <b>claim</b> <b>that</b> Trepkos destroyed their lab and disappeared after Firewalker's first descent. Meanwhile, outside, Trepkos strangles Pierce.|$|E
5|$|Scully is {{eventually}} {{captured by the}} townspeople and the worm is inserted into her body. Eventually, Doggett finds Scully, cuts the worm out of her, and shoots the creature dead. Later, Scully is packing her things in the hospital when Doggett comes in to inform her about {{the trial of the}} cult members; they are offering little defense except that <b>they</b> <b>claim</b> <b>that</b> they are being persecuted for their religious beliefs. Scully muses that they thought the worm was the Second Coming of Jesus Christ. She apologizes to Doggett for going out on the mission alone and promises to never do it again.|$|E
50|$|When it {{came time}} for RJP to take possession, <b>they</b> refused, <b>claiming</b> <b>that</b> the floors were a few inches too short, and <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>claimed</b> <b>that</b> the contact called for real rentals, without incentives.|$|R
25|$|The EU {{airlines}} {{went to the}} European Courts, as <b>they</b> <b>claimed</b> <b>that</b> {{the development}} of Milan Malpensa and the closure of Milan Linate would provide an anti-competitive situation in favour of Alitalia. <b>They</b> <b>claimed</b> <b>that</b> Alitalia could go on feeding its Fiumicino hub from Linate but they could not. Furthermore, <b>they</b> <b>claimed</b> <b>that</b> Malpensa was too far (40km) and lacked the infrastructure to/from the city (the rail link would open {{a year after the}} opening of the hub). After many court disputes the EU decided to leave 33% of the flights at Linate until the rail link opened.|$|R

5|$|The {{argument}} from morality {{is an argument}} {{for the existence of}} God. Arguments from morality tend to be based on moral normativity or moral order. Arguments from moral normativity observe some aspect of morality and argue that God is the best or only explanation for this, concluding that God must exist. Arguments from moral order are based on the asserted need for moral order to exist in the universe. <b>They</b> <b>claim</b> <b>that,</b> for this moral order to exist, God must exist to support it. The {{argument from}} morality is noteworthy in that one cannot evaluate the soundness of the argument without attending to almost every important philosophical issue in meta-ethics.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Ajay Singh Rathod (R. Madhavan), {{a flight}} {{lieutenant}} in the Indian Air Force who is Sonia's fiancé, is killed when his jet, a MiG-21, crashes. The government proclaims that the crash was caused by pilot error and closes the investigation. Knowing that Rathod was an ace pilot, Sonia and her friends do not accept the official explanation. Instead, <b>they</b> <b>claim</b> <b>that</b> he sacrificed his life to save hundreds of other lives {{that would have been}} lost had he ejected from the aircraft and left it to crash into a populous city. They investigate and learn that the crash was due to a corrupt defence minister Shastri (Mohan Agashe), who had signed a contract exchanging cheap and illegal MiG-21 aircraft spare parts for a personal favour. To their surprise, they learn that the key person who was responsible for organizing the deal was Karan's father, Rajnath Singhania (Anupam Kher).|$|E
5|$|Sirrus and Achenar beg the Stranger not {{to touch}} the green book that is stored in the same {{location}} as their final pages. <b>They</b> <b>claim</b> <b>that</b> it is a book like their own that will trap the Stranger. In truth, it leads to D'ni, where Atrus is imprisoned. When the book is opened, Atrus asks the Stranger to bring him a final page that is hidden on Myst Island; without it, he cannot bring his sons to justice. The game has several endings, depending on the player's actions. Giving either Sirrus or Achenar the final page of their book causes the Stranger to switch places with the son, leaving the player trapped inside the Prison book. Linking to D'ni without the page Atrus asks for leaves the Stranger and Atrus trapped on D'ni. Linking to D'ni with the page allows Atrus to complete his Myst book {{and return to the}} island. Upon returning to the library, the player finds the red and blue books gone, and burn marks on the shelves where they used to be.|$|E
50|$|Former {{members of}} the Royal Automobile Club (RAC) sued the {{directors}} for failing to disclose that they had plans to demutualise. <b>They</b> <b>claimed</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> could have received £35,000 had they stayed in the club, but had given up their membership. <b>They</b> <b>claimed</b> <b>that</b> the directors had breached a duty owed to them as shareholders to inform them of the upcoming demutualisation plan.|$|R
50|$|The {{decision}} to award this licence was widely disputed and Phoenix Gas, the incumbent in Belfast {{and the surrounding}} area, launched a judicial review of the {{decision to}} award it to BGE, <b>they</b> <b>claimed</b> <b>that</b> {{it was more of a}} political decision and <b>they</b> <b>claimed</b> <b>that</b> Bord Gáis will lose a significant amount of money and that the business will be loss making.|$|R

5|$|That night Quatermass {{travels with}} {{journalist}} Hugh Conrad to the prefab town where they meet with construction workers {{who say that}} work has been suspended for all except the 'zombies' ('marked' people). <b>They</b> <b>claim</b> <b>that</b> the meteorites are only over-shots from the plant after one of them lands in a pub. These recent meteorites are falling in hundreds and being collected by special guard teams {{then returned to the}} plant. Quatermass steals a guard's uniform from a lorry to gain entry to the plant. As he does this Conrad returns to the pub to telephone his newspaper and reveal everything about the secret alien invasion, but he becomes 'marked' before he can finish. The construction workers, however, hear what he says and decide to take action. Meanwhile, Quatermass is inside a pressure dome, where he sees guards putting meteorites into the tanks of poisonous slime that killed Ward, where together, in the recreated atmosphere of a moon of Saturn, they combine and grow into the first of the enormous ammonid alien creatures.|$|E
5|$|Monroe {{finishes}} {{viewing the}} footage, and expresses his disgust {{to the station}} executives regarding their decision to air the documentary. To convince them otherwise, he shows them the remaining, unedited footage, which only he has seen. The final two reels begin with the team locating a Ya̧nomamö girl, whom the men film and gang-rape. Faye only tries to intervene when Alan participates. Afterwards, they encounter the same girl impaled on a wooden pole by a riverbank, where <b>they</b> <b>claim</b> <b>that</b> the natives killed her for loss of virginity. Shortly afterwards, they are attacked by the Ya̧nomamö in revenge for the girl's rape and death. Jack is hit by a spear, and Alan shoots him so the team can film how the natives mutilate his corpse. As the three surviving team members try to escape, Faye is captured. Alan initially insists that they try to rescue her, but ultimately decides not to. Mark continues to film as she is raped, beaten to death, and beheaded. The Ya̧nomamö then pursues and kills the last two team members as the camera drops {{to the floor and}} ends showing Alan's bloody face. Disturbed by what they have seen, the executives order the footage to be destroyed.|$|E

50|$|In the appeal, CA {{disputed the}} {{district}} court's {{finding that the}} OSCAR 3.5 did not have substantial similarity to CA's ADAPTER. <b>They</b> <b>claimed</b> <b>that</b> the district court did not apply a proper test that took into consideration the copying of non-literal elements of computer software. <b>They</b> <b>claimed</b> <b>that</b> despite the clean room rewrite, there was substantial similarity in the structures of ADAPTER including flow charts, inter-modular relationships, parameter lists, macros, and services obtained from the operating system.|$|R

5000|$|The film {{landed in}} a {{controversy}} prior to its release in January 2016, after groups such as Rashtriya Basavadal and Basava Peetha staged demonstrations in Dharwad calling for its ban. They alleged that the film wrongly depicts the ritual of wearing miniaturized iconographic form of the deity Shiva, the Jyotirlinga. <b>They</b> <b>claimed</b> <b>that,</b> instead, Ishtalinga should have been depicted. The film shows the worship of Lingam performed placing it on the devotee's right hand, when <b>they</b> <b>claimed</b> <b>that</b> history states that it was done by keeping it in the left hand. The protesters also said that Allama Prabhu and Akka Mahadevi are depicted in the film without wearing the lingam. <b>They</b> <b>claimed</b> <b>that</b> [...] "all these scenes prove {{that it is a}} systematic approach to fabricate vachana sahitya", in a memorandum submitted to the Chief Minister of Karnataka calling for the film's ban.|$|R

25|$|Critics {{point out}} that the {{presence}} of chiasmus in Strang's writing {{as well as in the}} literature of other cultures implies that the source could be non-Hebrew.
