5|$|The {{account of}} Edwin's {{conversion}} offered by Bede turns on two events. The first, during Edwin's exile, tells how Edwin's life was saved by Paulinus of York. The second, following {{his marriage to}} Æthelburg, was the attempted assassination at York, at Easter 626, by an agent of Cwichelm of Wessex. Edwin's decision to allow the baptism of his daughter Eanfled and his subsequent promise to adopt Christianity if his campaign against Cwichelm proved successful. Apart from these events, the general character of Bede's account is one of an indecisive king, unwilling to <b>take</b> <b>risks,</b> unable {{to decide whether to}} convert or not.|$|E

5|$|Bedser was {{relieved}} after 70 minutes of bowling. The leg spin of Wright was introduced and Australia cut loose. Wright bowled a no ball that Morris dispatched into the leg side crowd for six, before hitting another ball for four. Bradman and Morris settled down as Coxon and Wright operated. The Australian captain drove the debutant Coxon through the covers for two fours, and Yardley made frequent rotations of his bowlers. Coxon continued to significantly rough up the pitch outside the right-handed batsman's leg stump, {{and from the}} other, Wright was able to extract substantial spin on the first morning of the match, hitting Morris in the stomach with a ball that turned in sharply from outside off stump. At lunch, Australia were 82/1 with Morris on 45 and Bradman 35. The tourists had largely been content to wait for loose deliveries, rather than <b>take</b> <b>risks,</b> and as the Englishmen bowled accurately, the Australians did not score quickly.|$|E
5|$|Experimental {{blending}} of Western and Malagasy musical elements was occurring simultaneously {{among a number}} of northwestern bands and musicians of Jaojoby's generation. Although no single individual can be credited with creating the modern salegy genre, Jaojoby ranks among the earliest originators of the nascent musical style. A desire for greater freedom to write songs and further develop the syncretic modern salegy style led Jaojoby to leave Los Matadores in 1975 for The Players, another regional band that was less well-established but more willing to <b>take</b> <b>risks.</b> The band was managed by a Chinese shopkeeper who provided them with a sound system and generator. The band toured northwestern Madagascar {{for the next four years}} with increasing success, recording two 45rpm singles and performing in Mahajanga, Diego-Suarez, and other towns and villages throughout the region before disbanding in 1979.|$|E

40|$|A {{principle}} U. S. {{fisheries management}} concern is ensuring compliance with Endangered Species Act requirements to limit incidental takes of listed species to levels {{which do not}} result in potential jeopardy to existing population stocks. Part of the risk assessment process involves an analysis of historic takes (bycatch) of ESA-listed species relative to fishing effort. Sample bycatch per unit of effort (BPUE) ratios are used to gauge the <b>take</b> <b>risk</b> to ESA-listed species posed by future fishing effort. The rare-event nature of protected species takes complicates the interpretation of sample BPUE ratios. For illustration, a total of 23 leatherback turtles were incidentally taken by fishermen in the California-Oregon drift gillnet fishery from the 1990 through 2006 fishing seasons in 7733 sets of fishing effort, with from 0 to 5 leatherback takes per season over the entire period. Should one conclude the incidental <b>take</b> <b>risk</b> was significantly higher during the season with 5 leatherback turtle takes than in seasons with 0 takes? To address this and related inference problems, we specify a state space model which describes the pattern of observed takes as a Poisson process conditional {{on the level of}} fishing effort. A time-varying Poisson rate parameter, expressed as BPUE, measures the time-varying level of <b>take</b> <b>risk.</b> A Kalman filter for Poisson processes is used to estimate the intertemporal variation in <b>take</b> <b>risk</b> from California-Oregon drift gillnet fishery observer data. A key question regards attributing the observed pattern of takes to randomness which drives fluctuations in observed takes versus intertemporal variation in the level of <b>take</b> <b>risk...</b>|$|R
5|$|After the break, Hassett {{reached his}} century after 305 minutes of batting, his first in Tests in England. He then accelerated, adding a further 37 runs in 49 minutes before being bowled by Bedser, having struck 20 fours and a six. The {{dismissal}} ended an eighth-wicket partnership of 107 with Lindwall, who {{was caught by}} Evans down the leg side four runs later, having scored 42 with seven fours. Australia's last-wicket pair of Johnston and Toshack wagged a further 33 runs in only 18 minutes, batting in a carefree and freewheeling manner, before Bedser trapped Toshack to end the innings at 509, leaving the tourists with a 344-run lead. Australia had batted for 216.2 overs, the longest innings in terms of overs and the highest total in the series. Yardley placed {{the majority of the}} bowling load on his spinners; Young (1/79) and Laker (4/138) delivered 60 and 55 overs respectively. Bedser bowled 44.2 overs, taking 3/113. The part-time seam bowlers, Edrich, Barnett and Yardley, bowled 18, 17 and 17 overs respectively. Australia had scored slowly but they had no need to <b>take</b> <b>risks</b> when there was so much time remaining. Yardley's leg theory tactics failed to coax them into losing their patience.|$|E
5|$|England {{lost their}} leg spinner Doug Wright before the match to lumbago, so the off spin of Jim Laker {{was brought in}} at late notice. Laker had {{struggled}} when he had played for Surrey and the MCC against Australia in the lead-up matches, taking 1/137 and 3/127 respectively. In the MCC match, the Australians had attacked him, taking nine sixes from his bowling in one 82-minute passage of play. Of the team that took to {{the field for the}} MCC, Len Hutton, Bill Edrich, Denis Compton, captain Norman Yardley, Laker and Jack Young were also selected for the First Test. Hutton scored 52 and 64 in the MCC match but nobody else managed to pass 26 in either innings. Young had bowled 55.2 overs in Australia's only innings, taking 4/155. Opener Jack Robertson was left out after scoring six and a duck, and Cyril Washbrook, who had played against Australia in the 1946–47 series, partnered Hutton. Joe Hardstaff junior had scored 107 for Nottinghamshire, the only century made against Australia in the lead-up matches, earning himself Test selection. Paceman Alec Bedser did not play in the MCC match, but had been a regular during England's last series against Australia in 1946–47, and had taken 4/104 for Surrey in their match against the tourists. Godfrey Evans, who kept wickets in the previous Ashes series, also gained Test selection. According to former England bowler Bill Bowes, England went into the match with the intention of securing a draw through the selection of defensive bowlers. The home team's bowlers would tie down the Australians, forcing the batsmen to <b>take</b> <b>risks</b> to score runs and thereby increasing the chances of dismissal; however, if rain produced a sticky wicket, the England attack might be able to dismiss Australia relatively easily. As such, England filled their team with batsmen and only played three frontline bowlers, Laker, Bedser and Young, and relied on Yardley, Edrich and Charlie Barnett to support them with their occasion seam bowling. It was speculated that England would use only two specialist bowlers; the all-rounder George Pope was in the squad and it was thought he would be used in place of one of the bowlers, but in the end, he was omitted, as was Reg Simpson. The latter had made 74 and 70 for Nottinghamshire against Australia and had impressed observers with his display, and was made twelfth man.|$|E
5|$|England {{maintained}} their newly confident approach, being on top {{for most of}} the fourth Test. Yardley's men scored 496 and achieved a first innings lead of 38, Yardley contributing two wickets. England increased their lead by 365 before Yardley declared. He kept the team batting for five minutes on the last day, allowing him to use the heavy roller to quicken the break-up of the pitch. Australia had to score 404 in 345 minutes, a target considered unlikely as such a large total had never been made to win a Test match. In addition, the pitch was difficult to bat on by now and the spinners could turn the ball sharply. However, England made several errors: Godfrey Evans, the England wicket-keeper had a bad day and missed some stumping chances; three catches were dropped by fielders, and England's only specialist spinner, Jim Laker, bowled poorly. Consequently, Yardley was forced to use Denis Compton's bowling. Compton was not a specialist bowler and although he caused problems for the batsmen, Bill Bowes believed the selectors were mistaken in expecting him to be as effective as a front line spinner. Yardley seemed unsure of the best course of action as Bradman and Arthur Morris added 301 runs for the second wicket; he resorted to using the very occasional leg spin of Hutton, who was hit for 30 runs in four overs, although Yardley himself dropped a catch from Hutton's bowling. The pitch conditions were unfavourable for the faster bowlers, but the ineffectiveness of the spinners forced Yardley to take the new ball. Australia won by seven wickets; the spectators were unhappy with the inadequate English bowling and the absence of a suitable bowler to exploit the pitch on the last day. Bowes later criticised Yardley for allowing Australia to score quickly enough to win; he believed that Yardley used Hutton's bowling to encourage the tourists to <b>take</b> <b>risks</b> against lesser bowling to keep up with required rate of scoring, but he miscalculated in using such bowling for too long. Wisden also stated that England should have won the match.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} addressed {{differences between}} drivers putting driver attitudes and behaviour at {{the centre of}} the research, with an overarching aim to critically examine the role of individual differences, in terms of background characteristics and perceptions, on engineering speed management strategies (specifically addressing speed humps, Intelligent Speed Adaptation (ISA), Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) and Black Box Technology) and their subsequent effect on driving behaviour. To address this aim a two-part methodology was adopted. First, a total of 57 in-depth interviews were carried out using a semi-structured emergent design and then from the results of the interviews, questionnaires were developed. A total of 1557 individuals completed the questionnaires and their background characteristics showed that generalisations to the UK driving population could take place. Furthermore, a degree of validity and reliability was also found. It was found that although most drivers <b>took</b> <b>risks,</b> through speeding and other risky driving behaviours, there were different motivations for this. Four groups were identified based on these motivations; those that <b>took</b> <b>risk</b> unintentionally formed the largest group. Three smaller groups were also found, a reactive risk taking group who <b>took</b> <b>risks</b> when reacting to stress or being in a hurry, a calculated risk taking group who <b>took</b> <b>risks</b> when they felt it was safe to do so, such as late at night or on well-known roads, and a continuous risk taking group who often <b>took</b> <b>risks</b> for their own sake. Each of these groups would approach engineering speed management strategies differently. Speed humps and perceived use of ISA decreased overall safety of drivers in all groups except those in the unintentional risk taking group. Perceived use of ACC increased overall safety for all drivers except continuous risk takers. Perceived use of Black Box Technology increased overall safety for all drivers except reactive risk takers...|$|R
