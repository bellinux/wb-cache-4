Methods: A earch of databa e wa conducted to identify tudie publi hed between 1980 and 2008. Results: 52 tudie were identified. The majority were eros-sectional (92 %) and published after 1999 (77 %). The evidence {{for the effects of}} trail on physical a tiv ity was mixed among 3 intervention and 5 correlational studie.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} {{analysis}} was to evaluate the micronutrient content of plant foods produced by organic and onventional agricultural methods. Studies were identified from a search of electronic databases (1980 - 2007, inclusive) as ell as manual searches. A total of 66 studies (describing 1440 micronutrient comparisons) were identified. Thirty-three <b>tudies</b> (908 comparisons) satisfied the screening criteria which considered cultivar, harvesting, and soil conditions. In <b>tudies</b> that satisfied the screening criteria, the absolute levels of micronutrients were higher in organic foods more often han in conventional foods (462 vs 364 comparisons, P = 0. 002), and the total micronutrient content, expressed as a percent ifference, was higher in organic (+ 5. 7 %, P < 0. 001) as compared to conventionally grown produce. The micron utrient ontent of food groups was more frequently reported to be higher for organic vegetables and legumes compared to their onventional counterparts (vegetables, 267 vs 197, P < 0. 001; legumes, 79 vs 46, P = 0. 004). This trend was supported y a mean percent difference in micronutrient content favoring organic vegetables (+ 5. 9 %, P < 0. 001) and legumes (+ 5. 7 %, P < 0. 001). Further research is required {{to determine the effect}} of organic agricultural methods on a broader range f nutrients and their potential impact on health. 12 page(s...|$|E
