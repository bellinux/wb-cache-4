5|$|In 1816 in France, a physician, J. P. A. Pasquier, {{described}} {{an outbreak of}} typhoid linked to the consumption of raw oysters. The first report of this kind in the United States was in Connecticut in 1894. As sewage treatment programmes became more prevalent in the late 19th century, more outbreaks took place. This may have been because sewage was released through outlets into the sea providing more food for bivalves in estuaries and coastal habitats. A causal link between the bivalves and the illness {{was not easy to}} demonstrate because the illness might come on days or even weeks after the ingestion of the contaminated shellfish. One viral pathogen is the Norwalk virus. This is resistant to treatment with chlorine-containing chemicals and may be present in the marine environment even when coliform bacteria have been killed by the <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> <b>sewage.</b>|$|E

25|$|During sewage treatment, 5β-coprostanol may be {{converted}} to 5β-cholestan-3α-ol form, epi-coprostanol.

A cross-plot of the 5β-coprostanol / cholesterol ratio with the epi-coprostanol / 5β-coprostanol can indicate both faecal contamination and treatment.|$|E
40|$|The <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> urban <b>sewage</b> sludge is <b>of</b> vital {{importance}} for mitigating {{the risks of}} environmental contaminations, and the negative effects on human health. However, there are usually various different technologies for the <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> urban <b>sewage</b> sludge; thus, {{it is difficult for}} decision-makers/stakeholders to select the most sustainable technology among multiple alternatives. This study aims at developing a generic multi-criteria decision support framework for sustainability assessment of the technologies for the <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> urban <b>sewage</b> sludge. A generic criteria system including both hard and soft criteria in economic, environmental, social and technological aspects was developed for sustainability assessment. The improved analytic hierarchy process method, namely Best-Worst method, was employed to determine the weights of the criteria and the relative priorities of the technologies with respect to the soft criteria. Three MCDM methods including the sum weighted method, digraph model, and TOPSIS were used to determine sustainability sequence of the alternative technologies for the <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> urban <b>sewage</b> sludge. Three technologies including landfilling, composting, and drying incineration have been studied using the proposed framework. The sustainability sequence of these three technologies determined by these three methods was obtained, and finally the priority sequence was determined as landing filling, drying incineration and composting in the descending order.

40|$|The {{results of}} {{research}} concerning the feasibility <b>of</b> anaerobic <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> domestic <b>sewage</b> at low temperature {{are summarized in}} this article. The batch tests demonstrated a high biodegradability <b>of</b> domestic <b>sewage</b> at 20 °C (74 Ž Both batch and continuous experiments for the <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> domestic <b>sewage</b> showed that the removal of SS prior to anaerobic <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> domestic <b>sewage</b> not only provides a stable reactor performance but also improves the removal of both colloidal (CODcol) and dissolved COD (CODdis). The results of the pre-treatment <b>of</b> domestic <b>sewage</b> in an anaerobic filter (AF) and an anaerobic hybrid (AH) reactor showed that the AF reactor is an efficient process {{for the removal of}} suspended COD (CODss), viz. 82 °at an HRT of 4 h and 13 °C. The novel AF reactor consists of vertical sheets of reticulated polyurethane foam with knobs, where the biomass was only in attached form. For the <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> pre-settled <b>sewage</b> at 13 °C, the AH reactor, with granular sludge, showed a higher total COD (CODt) removal than the UASB reactor as a result of higher CODcol removal. Therefore, the performance of a two-step system, AF AH (with granular sludge) reactor, was investigated with different HRTs at 13 °C. For optimization of CODss and CODdis an HRT of 4 4 h is needed, while for optimization of CODcol removal an HRT of 4 8 h is required.

25|$|Primary <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> <b>sewage</b> by {{quiescent}} settling allows {{separation of}} floating material and heavy solids from liquid waste. The remaining liquid usually contains {{less than half}} of the original solids content and approximately two-thirds of the BOD in the form of colloids and dissolved organic compounds. Where nearby water bodies can rapidly dilute this liquid waste, primary treated sewage may be discharged so natural biological decomposition oxidizes remaining waste.|$|E
25|$|Laws {{regulating}} the discharge and <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> <b>sewage</b> {{have led to}} dramatic nutrient reductions to surrounding ecosystems, but it is generally agreed that a policy regulating agricultural use of fertilizer and animal waste must be imposed.

25|$|Sewage {{treatment}} {{may also be}} referred to as wastewater treatment, although the latter is a broader term which can also be applied to purely industrial wastewater. For most cities, the sewer system will also carry a proportion of industrial effluent to the sewage treatment plant which has usually received pretreatment at the factories themselves to reduce the pollutant load. If the sewer system is a combined sewer then it will also carry urban runoff (stormwater) to the sewage treatment plant. Sewage water can travel towards treatment plants via piping and in a flow aided by gravity and pumps. The first part of filtration of sewage typically includes a bar screen to filter solids and large objects which are then collected in dumpsters and disposed of in landfills. Fat and grease is also removed before the primary <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> <b>sewage.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{impacts of}} human habitation, {{particularly}} the inadequate <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> <b>sewage</b> effluent, {{and the growth}} of mining in the upper reaches and the processing of metals in the Sheffield area have resulted in serious pollution of the river, and the depletion of fish stocks, to the extent that large parts of the Don contained no fish until the mid-1980s. Concerted efforts have been made to improve the water quality, by reducing the concentration of metals, the ammonia content, and the biological oxygen demand (BOD), which {{is a measure of the}} amount of oxygen that is needed by organisms to break down organic matter in the water. Sewage treatment works on the Don, notably those at Cheesebottom, on the west bank of the river at Thurgoland and Blackburn Meadows at Tinsley, have been upgraded, as has that at Darton on the River Dearne. This has led to a great improvement in ammonia levels and BOD, further aided by the construction of biological treatment facilities for the processing of industrial effluent in the Doncaster area, while the decline in the steel industry in Sheffield has reduced the discharge of metals into the river.|$|E
