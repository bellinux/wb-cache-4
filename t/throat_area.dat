Each egg has a large yolk sac and the larva feeds on this while it develops inside the egg, emerging fully formed as a juvenile salamander. The female salamander often broods the eggs. In the genus Ensatinas, the female has been observed to coil around them and press her <b>throat</b> <b>area</b> against them, effectively massaging them with a mucous secretion.|$|E

2500|$|Valve/port {{coefficient}} is non dimensional and {{is derived}} by multiplying a characteristic physical {{area of the}} port and by the bulk flow figures and comparing the result to an ideal orifice of the same area. It is here that air flow bench norms differ from fluid dynamics or aerodynamics at large. The coefficient may {{be based on the}} inner valve seat diameter, the outer valve head diameter, the port <b>throat</b> <b>area</b> or the valve open curtain area. Each of these methods are valid for some purpose but none of them represents the true minimum area for the valve/port in question and each results in a different flow coefficient. The great difficulty of measuring the actual minimum area at all the various valve lifts precludes using this as a characteristic measurement. This is due to the minimum area changing shape and location throughout the lift cycle. Because of this non standardization, port flow coefficients are not [...] "true" [...] flow coefficients, which would be based on the actual minimum area in the flow path. Which method to choose depends on what use is intended for the data. Engine simulation applications each require their own specification. If the result is to be compared to the work of others then the same method would have to be selected.|$|E

R. The results are compared with those obtained for the J 71 Type IIF turbine, which was previously investigated, the two turbines being designed for the same engine application. Geometrically the two turbines were much alike, having the same variation of annular flow area and {{the same number of}} blades for corresponding stator and rotor rows. However, the blade <b>throat</b> <b>areas</b> downstream of the first stator of the IIA turbine were smaller than those of the IIF; and the IIA blade profiles were curve-backed, whereas those of the IIF were straight-backed. The IIA turbine passed the equivalent design weight flow and had a brake internal efficiency of 0. 880 at design equivalent speed and work output. A maximum efficiency of 0. 896 occurred at 130 percent of design equivalent speed and a pressure ratio of 4. 0. The turbine had a wide range of efficient operation. The IIA turbine had slightly higher efficiencies than the IIF turbine at comparable operating conditions. The fact that the IIA turbine obtained the design equivalent weight flow at the design equivalent operating point was probably a result of the decrease in the blading <b>throat</b> <b>areas</b> downstream of the first stator from those of the IIF turbine, which passed 105 percent of design weight flow at the corresponding operating point.

Low-speed wind-tunnel tests were performed to evaluate the aeroacoustic performance of two takeoff geometries (cylindrical centerbody and bulb-shaped centerbody) and four approach geometries (bulb-shaped centerbody, annular ring, radial vanes, and step diffuser). The effects of inlet internal lip shape and diffuser length on sonic inlet performance were also investigated. It was found that the single-passage geometries, in particular a cylindrical centerbody takeoff geometry and a bulb-shaped centerbody approach geometry, provide the highest level of aeroacoustic performance.
