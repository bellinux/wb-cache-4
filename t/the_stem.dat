5|$|On {{flowering}} plants, {{the leaves}} are alternately arranged up <b>the</b> <b>stem.</b> They are thick and decurrent, with much variation in leaf shape between {{the upper and lower}} leaves on <b>the</b> <b>stem,</b> ranging from oblong to oblanceolate, and reaching sizes up to 50cm long and 14cm across (19inches long and 5inches wide). They become smaller higher up <b>the</b> <b>stem,</b> and less strongly decurrent down <b>the</b> <b>stem.</b> The flowering stem is solid and 2‚Äì2.5cm (nearly an inch) across, and occasionally branched just below the inflorescence, usually following damage. After flowering and seed release, <b>the</b> <b>stem</b> and fruits usually persist in winter, drying into dark brown, stiff structures of densely packed, ovoid-shaped, and dry seed capsules. The dried stems may persist into the following spring or even the next summer. The plant produces a shallow taproot.|$|E
5|$|Another area of {{research}} {{is the ability of}} starfish to regenerate lost body parts. <b>The</b> <b>stem</b> cells of adult humans are incapable of much differentiation and understanding the regrowth, repair and cloning processes in starfish may have implications for human medicine.|$|E
5|$|Areoles are {{structures}} {{unique to}} cacti. Although variable, they typically appear as woolly or hairy {{areas on the}} stems from which spines emerge. Flowers are also produced from areoles. In the genus Pereskia, believed similar to the ancestor of all cacti, the areoles occur in the axils of leaves (i.e. in the angle between the leaf stalk and <b>the</b> <b>stem).</b> In leafless cacti, areoles are often borne on raised areas on <b>the</b> <b>stem</b> where leaf bases would have been.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>stems</b> are four-angled in cross-section, {{often with}} lines of teeth along the angles. In some species, <b>the</b> <b>stems</b> are {{prostrate}} or even push underground as rhizomes; in others <b>the</b> <b>stems</b> are more erect.|$|R
50|$|In the past, {{the ending}} -ami {{has been most}} widely applied to <b>the</b> <b>stems</b> of {{feminine}} nouns. Since the 15th century {{it came to be}} applied to <b>the</b> <b>stems</b> of neuter nouns and in the 16th - 17th century, despite the resistance of grammarians, to <b>the</b> <b>stems</b> of masculine nouns.|$|R

5|$|Armillaria species form fleshy, white-spored {{mushrooms}} with a cottony or membranous veil {{that typically}} forms a distinct annulus on <b>the</b> <b>stem.</b> The fruit bodies usually occur in autumn in large clusters {{at the base}} of <b>the</b> <b>stem</b> or roots. Armillaria species can produce rhizomorphs‚Äîrootlike aggregations of hyphae‚Äîthat can form massive, long-lasting underground networks. The growth of the rhizomorph networks allows for tree-to-tree spread of the fungus even when direct contact between diseased and healthy plants is not possible.|$|E
5|$|Bioluminescent {{tissue in}} the mature fruit body is {{restricted}} {{to the edge of}} the gills (as well as the cross-veins that connect them), the junction of the gills with <b>the</b> <b>stem,</b> and the inrolled cap edge. Distribution of bioluminescence along the gill edge corresponds to the position of the cheilocystidia. Less than 10% of the light emitted from both the young and mature fruit bodies is from other tissues, including the fertile hymenial area and <b>the</b> <b>stem.</b> Fruit body luminescence is highly variable between fruit bodies found on different logs in different environments.|$|E
5|$|Boletus auripes {{somewhat}} resembles B.aurantiosplendens, but {{the latter}} species {{has a more}} variably colored cap that can be orange, brownish orange, or yellowish, and variable degrees of stem reticulation. B.hortonii has a similar color scheme but lacks reticulation on <b>the</b> <b>stem.</b> B.auripes bears a superficial resemblance in coloration to the Costa Rican species B.lychnipes, known only from a limited area in the northern Cordillera de Talamanca. The latter species may be distinguished {{by the lack of}} reticulations on the upper half of <b>the</b> <b>stem,</b> a brown or salmon-pink staining reaction on <b>the</b> <b>stem</b> in response to handling, and microscopically by a conspicuously sterile margin and prominent pseudocystidia. Retiboletus retipes is set apart from B.auripes by a darker cap, tubes that lack an olive tinge, and a stem that has more prominent reticulation extending down to the base. In contrast to B.auripes, B.impolitus has a floccose (wooly) or tomentose cap surface, and lacks an olive tinge on the tubes.|$|E
50|$|The ending -mi {{was applied}} in Old Polish to <b>the</b> <b>stems</b> of {{masculine}} and neuter nouns, especially to soft-stem ones, {{and also to}} <b>the</b> <b>stems</b> of some feminine nouns in the nominative ending with -0. In principle, today it is only applied to <b>the</b> <b>stems</b> of masculine and feminine nouns in the nominative ending with -0 and having a phonetically soft-stem.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> fertile <b>stems</b> are {{shorter than}} the others; on these develop the cones that bear the spore casings. The leaves develop on <b>the</b> fertile <b>stems</b> and <b>the</b> <b>stems</b> lengthen; then <b>the</b> cones open to release their spores. The cones then drop off. This process takes a few weeks. All <b>the</b> <b>stems</b> may {{continue}} to grow until fall and generally die back over winter.|$|R
50|$|Equisetum hyemale has {{vertical}} jointed reed-like {{stalks of}} medium to dark green. <b>The</b> hollow <b>stems</b> {{are up to}} 3 ft in height. <b>The</b> <b>stems</b> are not branched. <b>The</b> <b>stems</b> themselves have conspicuous ridges, which are impregnated with silica. This makes the ridges feel rough and harsh.|$|R
5|$|Collybia cookei is {{most likely}} to be {{confused}} with the two other members of Collybia, both of which are outwardly similar in appearance; distinguishing between the three typically requires excavating <b>the</b> <b>stem</b> base away from the moss or debris in which <b>the</b> <b>stem</b> is embedded. In the field, C.tuberosa may be distinguished from C.cookei by its dark brown sclerotia that somewhat resembles an appleseed. Using a microscope provides a more definitive way of distinguishing the two: the hyphae in the sclerotia of C.cookei are rounded, while those of C.tuberosa are elongated; this diagnostic character is apparent with both fresh and dried material of the two species. C.cirrhata does not produce sclerotia.|$|E

5|$|Fruit body {{primordia}} first appear {{between the}} scales of the cones, and require 9 to 35 days to reach their final height. They consist of an inner core of thin-walled generative hyphae enclosed by an outer coat of skeletal hyphae. Immature fruit bodies are white and delicate, but gradually become brown as they mature. Because the cap is grown from <b>the</b> <b>stem</b> tip after it bends, cap development interrupts stem growth, and this shift to centrifugal growth (that is, growth outward from <b>the</b> <b>stem)</b> results in the typical kidney-shaped or semicircular cap. Although the fruit body takes at least 9 days to mature, spores production begins within 48‚Äì72 hours of the start of cap growth. Spines start out as minute protuberances {{on the part of}} <b>the</b> <b>stem</b> adjoining the undersurface of the cap. As the cap enlarges, these spines are spread horizontally, and more protuberances are formed, which elongate vertically downwards.|$|E

50|$|In Old Polish -am prevailed as {{the ending}} applied to <b>the</b> <b>stems</b> of {{feminine}} nouns. In the 15th - 17th century it was applied also to <b>the</b> <b>stems</b> of masculine and neuter nouns.|$|R
50|$|The ending -em {{until the}} 17th century was {{sometimes}} applied instead of -om to <b>the</b> <b>stems</b> of masculine nouns. There are no traces of this ending being applied to <b>the</b> <b>stems</b> of neuter nouns.|$|R

5|$|Nepenthes rajah, like {{virtually}} all {{species in the}} genus, is a scrambling vine. <b>The</b> <b>stem</b> usually grows along the ground, but will attempt to climb whenever it comes into contact with an object that can support it. <b>The</b> <b>stem</b> is relatively thick (‚â§30mm) and may reach up to 6 m in length, although it rarely exceeds 3 m. N. rajah does not produce runners as some other species in the genus, but older plants are known to form basal offshoots. This is especially common in plants from tissue culture, where numerous offshoots may form at a young age.|$|E

5|$|The Liliaceae are characterised as monocotyledonous, perennial, herbaceous, bulbous (or rhizomatous in {{the case}} of Medeoleae) {{flowering}} plants with simple trichomes (root hairs) and contractile roots. The flowers may be arranged (inflorescence) along <b>the</b> <b>stem,</b> developing from the base, or as a single flower at the tip of <b>the</b> <b>stem,</b> or as a cluster of flowers. They contain both male (androecium) and female (gynoecium) characteristics and are symmetric radially, but sometimes as a mirror image. Most flowers are large and colourful, except for Medeoleae. Both the petals and sepals are usually similar and appear as two concentric groups (whorls) of 'petals', that are often striped or multi-coloured, and produce nectar at their bases. The stamens are usually in two groups of three (trimerous) and the pollen has a single groove (monosulcate). The ovary is placed above the attachment of the other parts (superior). There are three fused carpels (syncarpus) with one to three chambers (locules), a single style and a three-lobed stigma. The embryo sac is of the Fritillaria type. The fruit is generally a wind dispersed capsule, but occasionally a berry (Medeoleae) which is dispersed by animals. The leaves are generally simple and elongated with veins parallel to the edges, arranged singly and alternating on <b>the</b> <b>stem,</b> but may form a rosette at the base of <b>the</b> <b>stem.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{fruit body}} {{formation}} of L.torminosus is pileostipitocarpic. In {{this type of}} development, the hymenium forms early {{on the underside of}} the cap and upper stem of the mushroom primordium. As the cap enlarges, the margin, made of flaring filamentous hyphae that grow outward and downward, tends to curve inward, eventually forming a flap of tissue roughly parallel to <b>the</b> <b>stem</b> surface. As further development takes place, these hyphae make contact with and adhere to the hymenial surface of <b>the</b> <b>stem,</b> covering basidia and macrocystidia (very long cystidia) already present. The junction between the two tissues produces a cavity that provides some temporary protection to the basidia, although they are already fertile when the cap margin starts to grow.|$|E
