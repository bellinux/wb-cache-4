This announcement came on the day after Belfast in Northern Ireland held the first of the new UK civil partnership registration ceremonies. The Government said that it would legislate following the report, but Taoiseach Bertie Ahern also said <b>there</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> be time to do so before the then upcoming election.|$|E
5|$|If {{this were}} not enough, {{there was a}} growing {{awareness}} that simple radar reflectors could be launched along with the warhead that would be indistinguishable to Zeus' radars. This problem was first alluded to in 1958 in public talks that mentioned Zeus' inability to discriminate targets. If the decoys spread apart further than the lethal radius of the Zeus' warhead, several interceptors {{will be required to}} guarantee that the warhead hiding among the decoys will be destroyed. Decoys are lightweight, and would slow down when they began to reenter the upper atmosphere, allowing them to be picked out, or decluttered. But by that time it would be so close to the Zeus base that <b>there</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> be time for the Zeus to climb to altitude.|$|E

Tancred and Fakredeen did not speak, but exchanged glances which expressed their secret thoughts.

25|$|Any {{candidate}} {{theory of}} quantum gravity {{must be able}} to reproduce Einstein's theory of general relativity as a classical limit of a quantum theory. This is not guaranteed because of a feature of quantum field theories which is that they have different sectors, these are analogous to the different phases that come about in the thermodynamical limit of statistical systems. Just as different phases are physically different, so are different sectors of a quantum field theory. It may turn out that LQG belongs to an unphysical sector â€“ one in which one does not recover general relativity in the semiclassical limit (in fact <b>there</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> be any physical sector at all).|$|E
500|$|The New York Times {{analyzed}} the film within {{a discussion of}} the genre of blaxploitation: [...] "As the audience for blaxploitation dwindled, it seemed as if Car Wash and The Wiz might be the last gasp of what had been a steadily expanding black presence in mainstream filmmaking." [...] The St. Petersburg Times noted, [...] "Of course, it only took one flop like The Wiz (1978) to give Hollywood an excuse to retreat to safer (i.e., whiter) creative ground until John Singleton and Spike Lee came along. Yet, without blaxploitation <b>there</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> have been another generation of black filmmakers, no Denzel Washington or Angela Bassett, or they might have taken longer to emerge." [...] The Boston Globe commented, [...] "the term 'black film' should be struck from the critical vocabulary. To appreciate just how outmoded, deceptive and limiting it is, consider the following, all of which have been described as black films, [...] [...] [...]" [...] and characterized The Wiz in a list which also featured 1970s films Shaft, Blacula, and Super Fly.|$|E

The feeling of shame at {{what might be called}} 'running after him' was smothered by the dread that he <b>might</b> <b>not</b> be <b>there,</b> that she <b>might</b> <b>not</b> see him after all, and by that dogged resolve--somehow, she did not know how--to win him back.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{a model in}} which competing governments offer financial incentives to individual firms to induce the firms to locate within their jurisdictions. Equilibrium is described under three specifications of the supplementary taxes. There is no misallocation of capital under two of these specifications, and <b>there</b> <b>might</b> or <b>might</b> <b>not</b> be capital misallocation under the third. This result contrasts strongly {{with that of the}} standard tax competition model, which does not allow governments to treat firms individually. That model almost always finds that competition among governments leads to the misallocation of capital. ...|$|R

If emulations run much faster than humans, <b>there</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> be enough time for human leaders to make wise decisions or negotiate. It's possible that humans would react violently against growing power of emulations, especially if they depress human wages. Or maybe emulations wouldn't trust each other, and even well intentioned defensive measures might be interpreted as offense.|$|E
2500|$|The {{alveolar}} bone surrounding one tooth will naturally surround an adjacent tooth, and removing bone for a crown lengthening procedure will effectively damage [...] the bony support of adjacent teeth to some inevitable extent, {{as well as}} unfavorably increase the crown-to-root ratio. [...] Additionally, once bone is removed, {{it is almost impossible}} to regain it to previous levels, and in case a patient would like to have an implant placed in the future, <b>there</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> be enough bone in the region once a crown lengthening procedure has been completed. [...] Thus, it would be prudent for patients to thoroughly discuss all of their treatment planning options with their dentist before undergoing an irreversible procedure such as crown lengthening.|$|E

McFarlane stated it showed the band was [...] "irrevocably and unashamedly changing for the better, being more aggressive than anything they had ever recorded". Sound Stage Direct described it as [...] "a creepy carnival of tribal rhythms, wonky discordance and garbled surrealism".

This done, he waited the visit from his pupil, which would probably follow the delivery of the note, in no very tranquil frame of mind. <b>There</b> <b>might</b> or <b>might</b> <b>not</b> be some deep motive at the bottom of Midwinter's conduct; but thus far it was impossible to deny that he had behaved in such a manner as to rebuke the rector's distrust, and to justify Allan's good opinion of him.|$|R
2500|$|In September 2016, {{during the}} first presidential debate, Trump said he doubted whether anyone knew who hacked the DNC, and disputed Russian interference. During the second debate, Trump said <b>there</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> have been hacking at all, and {{questioned}} why accountability was placed on Russia. During the third debate, Trump rejected Clinton's claim that Putin favored Trump. After the election, Trump rejected the CIA analysis and asserted that the reports were politically motivated to deflect from the Democrats' electoral defeat. Trump's transition team said in a brief statement: [...] "These {{are the same people}} that said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction." [...] However, the intelligence analysts involved in monitoring Russian activities are different from those who assessed that Iraq had stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction, while postâ€“Iraq War reforms have made it less likely for similar errors to reach {{the highest levels of the}} U.S. intelligence community. Trump dismissed reports of Russia's interference, calling them [...] "ridiculous"; he placed blame on Democrats upset over election results for publicizing these reports, and cited Julian Assange's statement that [...] "a 14-year-old kid could have hacked Podesta." [...] After Obama expelled 35 Russian diplomats and announced further sanctions on Russia, Trump commended Putin for refraining from retaliatory measures against the United States until the Trump administration would lay out its policy towards Russia.|$|E
