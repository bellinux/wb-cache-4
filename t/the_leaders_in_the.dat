5|$|In the 1990s, Bowling {{was one of}} <b>the</b> <b>leaders</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> horse genome project.

5|$|By {{this time}} the Barnard Fellowship had expired, and Rabi and Helen were living off a $182 per month stipend from the Rockefeller Foundation. They left Hamburg for Leipzig, where he hoped to work with Heisenberg. In Leipzig, he found Robert Oppenheimer, a fellow New Yorker. It would {{be the start of}} a long friendship. Heisenberg {{departed}} for a tour of the United States in March 1929, so Rabi and Oppenheimer decided to go to the ETH Zurich, where Pauli was now the professor of physics. Rabi's education in physics was enriched by <b>the</b> <b>leaders</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> field he met there, which included Paul Dirac, Walter Heitler, Fritz London, Francis Wheeler Loomis, John von Neumann, John Slater, Leó Szilárd and Eugene Wigner.|$|E
5|$|CCC Camp S-95, {{which opened}} on May 29, 1933 {{on the site}} of an old lumber camp, was able to {{distinguish}} itself over the years it operated in Sullivan County. Two floods swept through the area in 1933 and 1936. The August flood of 1933 caused extensive damage and largely destroyed the newly built camp. During the course of the flooding two young men from Camp S-95 saved the lives of two drowning children at Worlds End State Park. The flood of 1936 covered a large area within the West Branch Susquehanna River Valley. The young men of the CCC camp were among <b>the</b> <b>leaders</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cleaning up after the flood and rebuilding many destroyed bridges and roads. In 1936 the park was officially expanded beyond the original small picnic area. Camp S-95 closed in 1941.|$|E
50|$|There {{were four}} {{official}} classifications <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 2017 Vuelta a San Juan, with four corresponding <b>leader's</b> jerseys. <b>The</b> blue jersey was for <b>the</b> <b>leader</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> general classification, the yellow jersey for <b>the</b> <b>leader</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sprint classification, the red jersey for <b>the</b> <b>leader</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mountain classification, {{and the green}} jersey for <b>the</b> <b>leader</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> under 23 classification.|$|R
50|$|The race {{included}} four principal classifications, <b>the</b> <b>leaders</b> {{of which}} wore jerseys. <b>The</b> <b>leader</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> general classification wore a blue jersey; <b>the</b> <b>leader</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> points classification wore a blue jersey; <b>the</b> <b>leader</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mountains classification wore a green jersey; <b>the</b> <b>leader</b> of <b>the</b> intermediate sprints classification {{wore a black}} and white jersey.|$|R
50|$|When no overall {{party leader}} {{was a member}} of a House and a new <b>leader</b> was {{required}} <b>in</b> opposition, a <b>leader</b> emerged and was approved by party members in that House. From 1919 the Chairman of the Liberal Parliamentary Party, elected by MPs, functioned as <b>the</b> <b>leader</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> House of Commons. This required all <b>the</b> <b>leaders</b> after Asquith to retain their seat, to continue as <b>leader.</b> After 1926 <b>the</b> <b>leader</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> House of Commons was clearly pre-eminent over <b>the</b> <b>leader</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> House of Lords.|$|R
5|$|Duke of Marmalade {{was then}} moved {{directly}} into Group Two class; {{he was sent}} to England for the Vintage Stakes at Goodwood in July, where his opponents included the July Stakes winner Strategic Prince. Ridden by Michael Kinane he raced just behind the leaders before being moved forward to challenge <b>the</b> <b>leaders</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> straight. He made ground steadily, but was unable to reach the front and finished second, beaten by a neck by Strategic Prince. Before his run at Goodwood, Duke of Marmalade had been supported in the betting for the following year's 2000 Guineas, but shortly after the race he suffered a pastern injury which required surgery; as a result, he did not race again in 2006.|$|E
5|$|Although the 1940 Olympic Games {{could not}} be held due to war, Brundage sought to {{organize}} Western Hemisphere games that {{might be able to}} proceed despite the troubled international climate. Brundage was one of <b>the</b> <b>leaders</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> founding of the Pan-American Games, participating in the initial discussions in August 1940 in Buenos Aires. On his return, he arranged for the American Olympic Association to be renamed the United States of America Sports Federation (USASF), which would organize the United States Olympic Committee (as the AOC would now be called) and another committee to see to American participation in the Pan-American Games. Brundage became an early member of the international Pan-American Games Commission, although the inaugural event in Buenos Aires was postponed because of the war and was eventually held in 1951, with Brundage present. Despite his role in founding them, Brundage viewed the Pan-American Games as imitative, with no true link with antiquity.|$|E
5|$|The Gorkha {{aristocracy}} had led Nepal into disaster on {{the international}} front but preserved the political unity of the country, which {{at the end of}} the Anglo-Nepalese War in 1816 still was only about twenty-five years old as a unified nation. The success of the central government rested in part on its ability to appoint and control regional administrators, who also were high officers in the army. In theory these officials had great local powers; in practice they spent little energy on the daily affairs of their subjects, interfering only when communities could not cope with problems or conflicts. Another reason for Gorkha success in uniting the country was the willingness to placate local leaders by preserving areas where former kings and communal assemblies continued to rule under the loose supervision of Kathmandu, leaving substantial parts of the country out of the control of regional administrators. Even within the areas directly administered by the central government, agricultural lands were given away as jagir to the armed services and as birta to court favorites and retired servicemen. The holder of such grants in effect became the lord of the peasants working there, with little if any state interference. From the standpoint of the average cultivator, the government remained a distant force, and the main authority figure was the landlord, who took part of the harvest, or (especially in the Tarai) the tax collector, who was often a private individual contracted to extort money or crops in return for a share. For <b>the</b> <b>leaders</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> administration and the army, as military options became limited and alternative sources of employment grew very slowly, career advancement depended less on attention to local conditions than on loyalty to factions fighting at court.|$|E

25|$|The Liberal Democrats are {{a federal}} {{party of the}} parties of England, Scotland and Wales. The English and Scottish parties are further split into regions.

He then traveled to Australia to stand as a stallion for Coolmore (which Michael Tabor is involved with) during the 1997 Southern Hemisphere breeding season.|$|E
25|$|An {{example of}} soft {{conversion}} {{was within the}} construction products industry (metricated 1969 and 1972) where certain products continue to be produced to with reference to Imperial trade names but made using metric dimensions in the factory; for example, a 13mm thick plasterboard is still often called 'half-inch', even though the measurement is rounded to a convenient metric size and so is now only approximately half an inch thick. The construction industry itself (which included civil engineering projects) was one of <b>the</b> <b>leaders</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> metrication programme, having drawn up a detailed plan in 1967 and completing the phase-over by the end 1972.|$|E

25|$|Upstate New York {{was among}} <b>the</b> <b>leaders</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{revolutions}} in transportation, agriculture, and industry. Turnpikes, canals (notably the Erie Canal), and railroads connected eastern cities with western markets. New York's farmland was {{some of the}} most productive in the nation. The Genesee country became known as the breadbasket of the nation for its extraordinary grain production. Rapid-flowing rivers offered power for major industrial sites. Following these expanding economic opportunities, people (including African Americans as well as European Americans of many different backgrounds) poured into upstate New York. They came from several different cultures—New England Yankees, Dutch and Yorkers from eastern New York, Germans and Scots Irish from Pennsylvania, and immigrants from England and Ireland.|$|E

25|$|Madison {{inherited}} his plantation Montpelier in Virginia {{and owned}} hundreds of slaves during his lifetime.
