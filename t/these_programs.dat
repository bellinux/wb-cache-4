5|$|Teenagers {{have been}} {{participating}} in tough love behavior modification programs since the 1960s. Many of <b>these</b> <b>programs</b> {{take place in}} the wilderness in the style of military recruit training (also known as boot camps) and the teenagers are subjected to rigid discipline, including mandatory marches, physical abuse, solitary confinement, and deprivation of food and sleep. <b>These</b> <b>programs</b> have little to no oversight from the United States federal or state governments. Teenagers' claims of abuse at these facilities have not been investigated because the programs are not regulated.|$|E
5|$|Among Madgwick's priorities, in {{addition}} to the mandated extension program, was the expansion of the university's curriculum while orienting it to meet the needs and culture of the New England community. As the first Australian university located in a rural area, Madgwick focused the university's development in the areas of adult education, agriculture, and ranching. <b>These</b> <b>programs</b> would help define the new university.|$|E

5|$|At Illinois, Corbally {{replaced}} David D. Henry, who stated he was {{stepping down}} {{in favor of}} a younger president with fresh ideas. Almost immediately, Corbally sought to raise capital to fund construction and programs at what was then the ninth-largest university system in the country, especially focusing on the Chicago campus and the school's veterinary medicine and agriculture programs. Corbally enlisted the help of alumni from <b>these</b> <b>programs</b> to raise money for two new buildings on the Urbana-Champaign campus.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the fact}} that the native {{language}} of {{a significant part of the}} country's population is Russian, the language occupies a modest role in Israel's education system. Hebrew University started teaching Russian in 1962. In public schools, the first Russian-language classes were opened in the 1970s in large cities. The number of students enrolled in <b>these</b> <b>programs</b> dropped in the 1980s as immigration from the Soviet Union slowed down. In the 1990s, a Russian-language program carried out by local governments called Na'leh 16 included some 1,500 students. In 1997, about 120 schools in Israel taught Russian in one way or another.|$|E
5|$|FreeBSD has a {{software}} repository of over 26,000 applications that are developed by third parties. Examples include: windowing systems, web browsers, email clients, office suites and so forth. In general, the project {{itself does not}} develop this software, only the framework to allow <b>these</b> <b>programs</b> to be installed, which {{is known as the}} Ports collection. Applications may either be compiled from source ("ports"), provided their licensing terms allow this, or downloaded as pre-compiled binaries ("packages"). The Ports collection supports the current and stable branches of FreeBSD. Older releases are not supported and may or may not work correctly with an up-to-date Ports collection.|$|E

5|$|In 1947, President Truman issued Executive Order 9835, {{which created}} the Federal Loyalty Program.

Any association with <b>these</b> <b>programs</b> was ground for barring the person from employment. Listed organizations were not notified {{that they were being}} considered for the list, nor did they have an opportunity to present counterarguments; nor did the government divulge any factual basis for inclusion in the list. Although ACLU leadership was divided on whether to challenge the Federal Loyalty Program, some challenges were successfully made.|$|E
5|$|Macdonald wrote Nova Scotia's {{submission}} {{and presented}} it himself when the Commission held hearings in Halifax in February 1938. He {{called on the}} federal government to take full responsibility for social programs such as unemployment insurance, old-age pensions and mothers' allowances. Macdonald recommended that the federal government be given exclusive jurisdiction over income taxes and succession duties to pay for <b>these</b> <b>programs.</b> He argued however, that to maintain their independence, the provinces needed to collect indirect sources of revenue such as sales taxes. He also called for exclusive provincial control over such minor tax fields as gasoline and electricity taxes.|$|E
5|$|Machinery {{problems}} {{were likely to}} delay the ships well past their intended delivery dates of 1943–44. The Kharkhovskii Turbogenerator Works never completed a single turbine before the German invasion in June 1941. Another problem were the 305mm guns and turrets as the armament factories were focused on the higher-priority guns for the Sovetsky Soyuz-class battleships. Prototypes of neither had been completed {{by the time the}} Germans invaded. The situation was not much better for the smaller guns as mountings for both the 152mm and 100mm guns were still incomplete on 22 June 1941 and all of <b>these</b> <b>programs</b> were terminated quickly afterwards.|$|E

5|$|Near {{the end of}} the 20th century, {{the year}} 2000 problem (Y2K) was the focus of {{significant}} COBOL programming effort, sometimes by the same programmers who had designed the systems decades before. The particular level of effort required to correct COBOL code has been attributed to the large amount of business-oriented COBOL, as business applications use dates heavily, and to fixed-length data fields. After the clean-up effort put into <b>these</b> <b>programs</b> for Y2K, a 2003 survey found that many remained in use.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Existing {{cognitive}} agent programming languages {{that are}} based on the BDI model employ logical representation and reasoning for implementing the beliefs of agents. In <b>these</b> <b>programming</b> languages, the beliefs are assumed to be certain, i. e. an implemented agent can believe a proposition or not. <b>These</b> <b>programming</b> languages fail to capture the underlying uncertainty of the agent’s beliefs which is essential for many real world agent applications. We introduce Dempster-Shafer theory as a convenient method to model uncertainty in agent’s beliefs. We show that the computational complexity of Dempster’s Rule of Combination can be controlled. In particular, the certainty value of a proposition can be deduced in linear time from the beliefs of agents, without having to calculate the combination of Dempster-Shafer mass functions. ...|$|R
