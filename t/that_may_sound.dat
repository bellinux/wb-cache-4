It was like, 'Just let me at it and roll those cameras'. I {{remember}} being in makeup for 20 minutes, which normally took two hours. They put some kind of gel in my hair and some very light makeup and I loved it. I said, [...] "Just let me go, please don't edit me, just let me go.'" [...] She added, [...] "It {{was just one of}} those charming, charming, charming times where I just got to blow it out. I just wanted Sue Ellen to be raw unlike any other time in her life, where she was the victim and she was this and she was that; J.R. Ewing would do something and she would react, he would do something and she would have an affair or drink or whatever. This was just like, 'Let me go. Let Sue Ellen out of that box' ...|$|E
2500|$|IMF {{managing}} director Christine Lagarde wrote in August 2011: [...] "For the advanced economies, {{there is an}} unmistakable need to restore fiscal sustainability through credible consolidation [...] plans. At {{the same time we}} know that slamming on the brakes too quickly will hurt the recovery and worsen job prospects. So fiscal adjustment must resolve the conundrum of being neither too fast nor too slow. Shaping a Goldilocks fiscal consolidation is all about timing. What is needed is a dual focus on medium-term consolidation and short-term support for growth and jobs. <b>That</b> <b>may</b> <b>sound</b> contradictory, but the two are mutually reinforcing. Decisions on future consolidation, tackling the issues that will bring sustained fiscal improvement, create space in the near term for policies that support growth and jobs." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{failure of}} Gran Casino sidelined Buñuel, {{and it was}} over two years before he {{had the chance to}} direct another picture. [...] According to Buñuel, he spent this time [...] "scratching my nose, {{watching}} flies and living off my mother's money", but he was actually somewhat more industrious than <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>sound.</b> [...] With the husband/wife team of Janet and Luis Alcoriza, he wrote the scenario for Si usted no puede, yo sí, which was filmed in 1950 by Julián Soler. He also continued developing the idea for a surrealistic film called Ilegible, hijo de flauta, with the poet Juan Larrea. Dancigers pointed out to him that there was currently a vogue for films about street urchins, so Buñuel scoured the back streets and slums of Mexico City in search of material, interviewing social workers about street gang warfare and murdered children.|$|E

2500|$|The {{attack was}} a {{surprise}} to the IRA's East Tyrone Brigade as it was different from previous loyalist attacks. Thomas Mitchell suggested that it was the [...] "most effective attack ever mounted by the loyalists against a republican target". Wright considered Cappagh to have been a successful UVF operation and took personal credit for [...] "wiping them out". He discussed this in the Guardian newspaper:"I genuinely believe that we were very successful, and <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>sound</b> morbid but they know that we hammered them into the ground and we didn't lose one volunteer. Indeed, members of the security forces had said that we done what they couldn't do, we put the East Tyrone brigade of the IRA on the run. It was the East Tyrone brigade which was carrying on the war in the North, including in Belfast. East Tyrone were decimated, the UVF wiped them out and that's not an idle boast". When asked about the military importance of specific UVF operations, Wright replied, [...] "I would look back and say that Cappagh was probably our best".|$|E
2500|$|In early 1996, Quo Vadis {{headed back}} into the studio and {{recorded}} their debut album with Pierre Rémillard, who had previously worked with Cryptopsy, as producer. On April 10, 1996, Forever... was released and was received favorably by both fans and critics, leading Earth AD Records in Germany and Immortal Records in Poland to sign licensing deals with Quo Vadis. Bart said of the album, [...] "We recorded a demo which was released as an EP on cassette last year. The reaction was very positive. We were still searching for direction at that time, experimenting with keyboards and femme vox. The music is much more focused now as we have found our sound. Forever... is much more aggressive then the EP was, it's much more melodic and intricate. <b>That</b> <b>may</b> <b>sound</b> like a contradiction {{but that is the}} case. I think we had more to say as musicians this time in the studio as well. Our objective was to keep the aggression and not to loose our edge. I think we captured that quite well, at the same time setting free our artistic side. It's pretty weird. You have to listen to both to really understand." ...|$|E

60|$|One other point, before I conclude, {{about this}} matter. These reefs, {{as you have}} just perceived, are in a most {{singular}} and unexpected manner indications of physical changes of elevations and depressions going on upon {{the surface of the}} globe. I dare say it may have surprised you to hear me talk in this familiar sort of way of land going up and down; but {{it is one of the}} universal lessons of geology that the land is going down and going up, and has been going up and down, in all sorts of places and to all sorts of distances, through all recorded time. Geologists would be quite right in maintaining the seeming paradox that the stable thing in the world is the fluid sea and the shifting thing is the solid land. <b>That</b> <b>may</b> <b>sound</b> a very hard saying at first, but the more you look into geology, the more you will see ground for believing that it is not a mere paradox.|$|E
