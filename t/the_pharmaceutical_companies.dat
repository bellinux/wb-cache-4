25|$|The {{utility of}} broadly {{grouping}} the antipsychotics into first generation and atypical categories has been challenged. It {{has been argued}} that a more nuanced view, matching the properties of individual drugs to the needs of specific patients is preferable. While the atypical (second-generation) antipsychotics were marketed as offering greater efficacy in reducing psychotic symptoms while reducing side effects (and extrapyramidal symptoms in particular) than typical medications, the results showing these effects often lacked robustness, and the assumption was increasingly challenged even as atypical prescriptions were soaring. In 2005 the US government body NIMH published the results of a major independent (not funded by <b>the</b> <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>companies)</b> multi-site, double-blind study (the CATIE project). This study compared several atypical antipsychotics to an older typical antipsychotic, perphenazine, among 1,493 persons with schizophrenia. The study found that only olanzapine outperformed perphenazine in discontinuation rate (the rate at which people stopped taking it due to its effects). The authors noted an apparent superior efficacy of olanzapine to the other drugs in terms of reduction in psychopathology and rate of hospitalizations, but olanzapine was associated with relatively severe metabolic effects such as a major weight gain problem (averaging 9.4lbs over 18 months) and increases in glucose, cholesterol, and triglycerides. No other atypical studied (risperidone, quetiapine, and ziprasidone) did better than the typical perphenazine on the measures used, nor did they produce fewer adverse effects than the typical antipsychotic perphenazine (a result supported by a meta-analysis by Leucht et al. published in The Lancet), although more patients discontinued perphenazine owing to extrapyramidal effects compared to the atypical agents (8% vs. 2% to 4%, P=0.002). A phase 2 part of this CATIE study roughly replicated these findings. Compliance has not been shown to be different between the two types. Overall evaluations of the CATIE and other studies have led many researchers to question the first-line prescribing of atypicals over typicals, or even to question the distinction between the two classes.|$|E

2500|$|Haseltine and his {{laboratory}} quickly showed that damage {{to any of}} the viral genes that specify the virus capsid, polymerase, protease, ribonuclease, integrase and envelope genes killed the virus and therefore that proteins specified by each gene were good targets for anti-viral drugs. [...] Over the next several years {{his laboratory}} isolated each of the genes and their proteins in pure form and developed methods that were used by <b>the</b> <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>companies</b> to discover new anti viral drugs. The first HIV specific protease inhibitor Nelfinavir, was developed {{as a part of a}} three way collaboration between the Haseltine laboratory, Cambridge BioSciences, a company Haseltine and his colleagues created, and Agouron Pharmaceuticals. The combination of an HIV polymerase inhibitor such as AZT and an anti protease drug lead to the first long term survival of those infected with HIV. Haseltine proposed the use of combination chemotherapy, the use of multiple drugs targeted against different viral proteins would be the basis for effective therapy. Today those ideas have proven out; The pharmaceutical industry has developed more than forty drugs that inhibit the HIV polymerase, protease, integrase, and envelope proteins. Combinations of these drugs have transformed HIV infection from a near universally fatal disease to one that with proper management can usually be successfully treated for decades.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. Com. (Industrial Psychology)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2004. In {{order to}} develop a {{relationship}} with customers, a company must satisfy customers' needs. This study aimed to determine whether <b>the</b> <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>company's</b> employees' are actually satisfying their customers' needs, and {{to determine how the}} relationship can be improved. The main objectives of the study were to determine how relationship management (RM) can aid the relationship between selected customers and <b>the</b> <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>company,</b> determine how customer relationship management in <b>the</b> <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>company</b> can satisfy customer needs, and conduct an empirical investigation on the usage of customer relationship management (CRM) in <b>the</b> <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>company.</b> Relationship management is a tool that most companies can use to enhance their relationships with stakeholders. Relationship management enables companies to create value for customers, increase profits and return on equity. Customer relationship management concentrates on building relationships with the company's most important stakeholder - the customer. The study explains the reasons why companies should concentrate on customer relationship management rather than just relationship management. Customer relationship management has to be an integrated company effort and be implemented throughout the entire company in order to be successful. Customer relationship management enables companies to develop long-term relationships with customers that will lead to increased profits and business performance. Each employee in the company must be aware of the need and importance of CRM. When implementing CRM, all parties need to be involved to ensure acceptance of the CRM programme. The empirical investigation of the study concentrated on the customer relationship efforts of a <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>company</b> based in Gauteng. Two sets of questionnaires were handed out to achieve this objective. One set was handed out to the customers (private, state and academic laboratories in the Gauteng province), while the other set was handed out to the employees of <b>the</b> <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>company</b> that deal directly with the chosen customer group. The two sets of questionnaires were compared to determine the different views of the employees and customers of <b>the</b> <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>company</b> and to determine which aspects <b>the</b> <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>company</b> needs to be improved upon to enhance the relationship with customers. Once an analysis of the questionnaires was performed, the following summary of important conclusions and recommendations could be made: The customers of <b>the</b> <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>company</b> are satisfied with the CRM efforts, but even a small percentage of customers that are dissatisfied can lead to <b>the</b> <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>company</b> losing customers and decreasing its profitability. The relationship with customers can be improved by: - Improving the service efficiency provided to customers by improving the contact between customers and sales consultants, after-sales service, and delivery of products. This can all be achieved by improving internal, as well as external communication. - Twenty six point three percent (26. 3 %) of customer respondents indicated that <b>the</b> <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>company</b> does not handle queries quickly. The Internet and company website could be used to increase problem solutions. - The availability of sales consultants was identified as a problem area. Fifleen point four percent (15. 4 %) of customer respondents indicated that the availability of sales consultants and frequency of contact was "poor". It was recommended that sales consultants visit customers more frequently. The recommendations will enable <b>the</b> <b>pharmaceutical</b> <b>company</b> to enhance and manage its relationships with its customers. Master...|$|R
