5|$|After {{finishing}} {{writing the}} dialogue, Takumi was called into another meeting with Inaba, {{and was told}} to add a new gameplay mechanic to the investigations. Takumi {{wanted to keep the}} gameplay simple enough for his mother {{to be able to play}} it, and keep it focused on the core concept of finding lies; according to him, he immediately had a vision of <b>the</b> <b>psyche</b> lock system during the meeting with Inaba, but still asked for three days to come up with an idea. He found it easy to formulate the idea, but it took over a month to create the system; the biggest problem was how to visually represent <b>the</b> <b>psyche</b> locks. Takumi also drew storyboards for the episodes' openings, which consisted of series of detailed drawings that show what is happening. He also drew rough sketches of cut-in illustrations; it was only decided after all the text had been written what scenes would have illustrations made for them. While the game's opening features the judge, it was originally supposed to have featured a demon instead; this was because Takumi was playing Devil May Cry at the time, and had liked its opening. As Takumi wanted the first three Ace Attorney games to be part of one larger work, he did not want the first game to look outdated in comparison to later ones, so it was decided to keep the same graphics for main characters such as Phoenix, Maya and Edgeworth throughout all their appearances, and not make updates to them. The game's music was composed by Naoto Tanaka under the pseudonym Akemi Kimura.|$|E
5|$|Stratton {{articulated}} his {{own beliefs}} about religion as well. He did not {{subscribe to the}} view religious feeling was primarily a social need, believing {{it to be a}} need for seeing a cause and logic to the world along with a harmony to things. A believer in dualism, he held the theory of a separate biological psyche and something beyond it. To him the most important aspects of <b>the</b> <b>psyche</b> lay beyond objective science, at least in his time. He sought to explore those boundaries where the methods of science had to stop and declare what was beyond as unknown, limited by the tools of the times. In The Psychology of the Religious Life he laid out his definition of religion as an appreciative feeling toward an unseen entity marked the best or the greatest.|$|E
5|$|The Boat Captain– A humorous addition, the Boat Captain {{encountered}} Kratos {{on several}} occasions, although these were always to the Boat Captain's detriment. In God of War, Kratos ignored him {{when in the}} belly of the Hydra and brushed him aside in the Underworld. In God of War II, the Boat Captain fled from Kratos as a spirit even though summoned to fight him, and in God of War III, he left a note of hatred towards Kratos in the Underworld and his voice was heard in Kratos' psyche. The character was voiced by Keith Ferguson in God of War and God of War II, and Josh Keaton in God of War III during <b>the</b> <b>psyche</b> sequence.|$|E

5|$|Barbarian King Alrik– The former {{ruler of}} {{a horde of}} barbarians. As the {{champion}} of Hades, he sought the Ambrosia to save his ailing father. Alrik was ultimately unsuccessful and was killed by Kratos. Resurrected by Hades, Prince Alrik learned that he had become King {{after the death of}} his father. Alrik sought vengeance against Kratos, and his barbarian horde threatened to overwhelm Kratos' opposing Spartan army. Alrik almost killed Kratos in combat, but this was undone at the critical moment when Kratos offered up his life to Ares and was returned to battle equipped with the Blades of Chaos, which Kratos used to decapitate Alrik. Alrik eventually fought his way out of the Underworld, and intent on revenge, found and confronted Kratos on the Island of Creation. Kratos killed the Barbarian King once again, and took his hammer. The character was voiced by Bob Joles in God of War II, and Fred Tatasciore in God of War III during <b>the</b> <b>psyche</b> sequence.|$|E
5|$|Ares– The former God of War {{and main}} {{antagonist}} of God of War. Ares captured Kratos' brother Deimos {{and had him}} imprisoned and tortured due to a misinterpreted prophecy, and later chose Kratos as his champion during a successful wager with other Olympian Gods in the God of War comic series. Early on, Ares wanted to overthrow Zeus and entered into an alliance with the Furies to help him do so. Years later, as he deemed his own son Orkos unworthy, Ares saw an opportunity to create a warrior to help him. During a battle, Kratos called on the God of War, and pledged his life in servitude if Ares spared him from his foes and provided the power to destroy them. Ares granted Kratos' wish and empowered his new servant with the Blades of Chaos. A victorious Kratos eventually renounced his servitude to Ares when the god tricked Kratos into accidentally killing his own wife and child. In God of War, while Ares waged war on the city of Athens, Kratos was tasked by Athena to find Pandora's Box, an artifact capable of destroying Ares. Ultimately successful, Kratos ascended to Mount Olympus and replaced Ares as the new God of War. In Ascensions multiplayer mode, Ares {{is one of the}} four gods that players can pledge their allegiance to. The character was voiced by Steven Blum in God of War, Ghost of Sparta, and Ascension. Fred Tatasciore provided Ares' voice in God of War III during <b>the</b> <b>psyche</b> sequence.|$|E
25|$|Jung {{established}} {{a school of}} psychology which emphasizes the human quest for wholeness (which he defined as the integration of conscious and unconscious components of <b>the</b> <b>psyche)</b> through a process called individuation. Through studying folklore, world mythologies, and the dreams of his patients, Jung identified these components of <b>the</b> <b>psyche</b> as expressions of instinctual patterns (or archetypes). The role of the psychoanalyst in the Jungian approach is to assist the analysand from being overwhelmed by unconscious material or being {{cut off from the}} meaning offered by these suprapersonal forces. Jungian analysts typically believe that <b>the</b> <b>psyche</b> is the source of healing and the drive toward individuation.|$|E
