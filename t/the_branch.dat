5|$|In March 1908, the {{off-peak}} {{shuttle service}} {{began to use}} the western tunnel on <b>the</b> <b>branch,</b> crossing between the two branch tunnels south of Holborn. Low usage led to {{the withdrawal of the}} second peak-hour shuttle and the eastern tunnel was taken out of use in 1914. Sunday services ended in April 1917 and, in August of the same year, the eastern tunnel and the bay platform at Holborn were formally closed. Passenger numbers on <b>the</b> <b>branch</b> remained low: when <b>the</b> <b>branch</b> was considered for closure in 1929, its annual usage was 1,069,650 and takings were £4,500. <b>The</b> <b>branch</b> was again considered for closure in 1933, but remained open.|$|E
5|$|In the 1920s, a non-electrified branch {{along the}} West Shore of Staten Island {{was built to}} haul {{materials}} to construct the Outerbridge Crossing, branching off of the main line south of Richmond Valley. <b>The</b> <b>branch</b> was cut back to a point south of the bridge after the bridge was built. Afterwards, <b>the</b> <b>branch</b> served a scrapyard owned by the Roselli brothers. <b>The</b> <b>branch</b> still exists to Page Avenue, and the switch is kept working.|$|E
5|$|Although the LNC {{proposed}} {{to convert the}} cemetery branch line into a grand avenue running from Brookwood station through the cemetery, this never took place. The rails and sleepers of <b>the</b> <b>branch</b> were removed in around 1947, and the trackbed became a dirt road and footpath. The run-around loop and stub of <b>the</b> <b>branch</b> line west of Brookwood station remained operational as sidings, before being dismantled on 30 November 1964. After the closure of <b>the</b> <b>branch</b> line the buildings of the two cemetery stations remained open as refreshment kiosks, and were renamed North Bar and South Bar.|$|E

On the retirement in 1956 of a Mr and Mrs Dendy, who operated North Bar from 1948 to 1956 and lived in the station apartment, North station was abandoned, and demolished in the 1960s owing to dry rot. South Bar continued to operate as a refreshment kiosk.|$|E
5|$|Because {{it was a}} {{self-contained}} section of the London Underground that was closed outside weekday peak hours, Aldwych station and <b>the</b> <b>branch</b> line from Holborn were popular locations for filming scenes set on the Tube even before their closure. Since the branch's closure in 1994, its use in film productions has continued, with the station appearing as itself and, with appropriate signage, as other stations on the network. The track and infrastructure are maintained in operational condition, and a train of ex-Northern line 1972 tube stock is permanently stabled on <b>the</b> <b>branch.</b> This train can be driven up and down <b>the</b> <b>branch</b> for filming. The physical connection with the Piccadilly line northbound tracks remains, but requires manual operation.|$|E

5|$|By the mid-1950s, British Railways {{had begun}} to operate in {{regional}} units, and responsibility for services on the former Great Central routes in the Chilterns {{was transferred to the}} London Midland Region. Services on <b>the</b> <b>branch</b> were generally hauled by LMS Ivatt Class locomotives, although passenger trains continued to use the 1898 Ashbury cars. British Railways continued to operate goods services on <b>the</b> <b>branch,</b> although these declined steadily owing to competition from road haulage to the point at which coal deliveries were the only significant business.|$|E
5|$|Following the Second World War, service levels dropped {{dramatically}} along the Portishead branch. When the railways were nationalised in 1948, services at Parson Street {{came under the}} auspices of the Western Region of British Railways, and by the time <b>the</b> <b>branch</b> was closed to passengers in 1964, there were only six trains each weekday, and none on Sundays. With the closure of <b>the</b> <b>branch,</b> Parson Street lost its interchange status, and in January 1971 the station buildings were demolished. Some special services did continue along <b>the</b> <b>branch</b> to , carrying fans to Bristol City FC games at the nearby Ashton Gate Stadium. These ceased in 1977, and Parson Street became the arrival and departure point for these trains.|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} decade after {{nationalisation}} services to Chesham continued much as before, although the unification of the mainline companies meant {{a wider variety of}} locomotives operating services on <b>the</b> <b>branch.</b> For two weeks from 13 October 1952 LT experimented with a three-car lightweight diesel train on the route, but the train used had difficulty negotiating the line's sharp bends and <b>the</b> <b>branch</b> reverted to steam operations.|$|E
50|$|The SSP aims at irrigating culturable {{command area}} (CCA) of 16,770 km2 with 70 per cent {{irrigation}} intensity.

5|$|In 1963, the Washington State Legislature {{commissioned}} {{a new state}} highway numbering system to ease confusion over similarly-numbered routes.

5|$|In September 1945, {{following}} {{the end of}} hostilities, the directors of the LNC met to consider whether to rebuild the terminus and reopen the London Necropolis Railway. Although the main line from Waterloo to Brookwood had remained in use throughout the war and was in good condition, <b>the</b> <b>branch</b> line from Brookwood into the cemetery had been almost unused since the destruction of the London terminus. With the soil of the cemetery causing <b>the</b> <b>branch</b> to deteriorate even when it had been in use and regularly maintained, <b>the</b> <b>branch</b> line was in extremely poor condition.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} years of the cemetery's operation, the {{locomotives}} hauling the funeral trains from Waterloo would not travel down <b>the</b> <b>branch</b> into the cemetery, as it would leave the engine at the wrong end of the train for the return journey. Instead, the train would stop immediately after passing Necropolis Junction, and the carriages would be uncoupled from the engine. A team of black horses would then haul the carriages down the sloping branch line to the two cemetery stations. While the train was on <b>the</b> <b>branch</b> line the engine would be repositioned so as to be at the front of the train once the horses drew it back out of <b>the</b> <b>branch</b> and onto the main line.|$|E

5|$|The first {{dealt with}} the Strand branch: it {{confirmed}} {{the layout of the}} junction between <b>the</b> <b>branch</b> and the main route at Holborn, and sought powers to extend <b>the</b> <b>branch</b> south under the River Thames to the London and South Western Railway's (L's) terminus at Waterloo station. The extension included moving Strand station to the corner of Surrey Street, and constructing a single tunnel from there to the BS's Waterloo station which would be provided with additional lifts to serve the GNP's platforms. <b>The</b> <b>branch</b> was to be operated as a shuttle with trains passing at Strand station. The junction layout and short extension to re-site Strand station were permitted, but not the extension to Waterloo.
