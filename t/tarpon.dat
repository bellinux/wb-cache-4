5|$|The Tampa Bay {{hurricane}} of 1921 (also {{known as}} the 1921 <b>Tarpon</b> Springs hurricane) was a major hurricane that struck the Tampa Bay Area. The eleventh tropical cyclone, sixth tropical storm, and fifth hurricane of the season, the storm developed from a trough in the southwestern Caribbean Sea on October20. Initially a tropical storm, the system moved northwestward and intensified into a hurricane on October22 and a major hurricane by October23. Later that day, the cyclone peaked as a Category4 on the modern day Saffir–Simpson scale with maximum sustained winds of 140mph (220km/h). After entering the Gulf of Mexico, the hurricane gradually curved northeastward and weakened to a Category3 before making landfall near <b>Tarpon</b> Springs, Florida, late on October25, becoming the first major hurricane to hit the area since a hurricane in 1848. The storm quickly weakened to a Category1 hurricane while crossing Central Florida, before reaching the Atlantic Ocean early on the following day. Thereafter, system moved east-southeastward and remained fairly steady in intensity before weakening to a tropical storm late on October29. The storm was then absorbed by a larger extratropical cyclone early the next day, with {{the remnants of the}} hurricane soon becoming indistinguishable.|$|E
5|$|At 2100UTC on August24, a {{tropical}} storm watch was issued for all of Florida south of the Jupiter Inlet {{on the east coast}} and south of Bonita Springs on the west coast; it also included Lake Okeechobee and the Florida Keys. Early on the next day, the tropical storm watch was upgraded to a warning, while the Florida Keys and the mainland from Ocean Reef to Bonita Springs were placed under a hurricane watch. Further north, {{a tropical}} storm watch was issued from the Jupiter Inlet to the Sebastian Inlet. Later on August25, the hurricane watch was switched to a warning, while a separate hurricane watch was issued from Golden Beach southward. At 1500UTC on August25, the tropical storm warning was extended northward to Sebastian Inlet. In addition, {{a tropical storm}} watch was issued further north from Sebastian Inlet to Flagler Beach on the east coast and Bonita Springs to <b>Tarpon</b> Springs on the west coast.

5|$|Although {{the storm}} {{affected}} several Caribbean islands, the Turks and Caicos, and the Bahamas, preparations there, if any, were unclear. Residents across Puerto Rico boarded up windows and secured roofs {{in anticipation of}} damaging winds. Governor Robert Hayes Gore placed the Hurricane Relief Organization and Red Cross on standby. As the storm neared Florida, the United States Weather Bureau—later the National Weather Service—posted storm warnings between Miami and Titusville. These were later extended to include {{the west coast of}} the state from Punta Rassa to <b>Tarpon</b> Springs. At the time, forecasters were unaware that the storm was of hurricane status; this unawareness extended to the storm's passage over the Gulf of Mexico. Forecasters only issued storm warnings for part of the Texas coast, including the cities of Brownsville and Freeport.|$|E
5|$|Some {{residents}} on Dauphin Island voluntarily evacuated, {{spurred by}} memories of 1979's Hurricane Frederic and Jeanne's northward motion. 3,000 workers evacuated their oil rigs because of Jeanne's high waves. The National Hurricane Center advised small watercraft {{to remain in}} ports from Brownsville to <b>Tarpon</b> Springs. Forecasters expected tides of 2feet above normal in Louisiana, which increased to 4feet above normal along coastal Texas. In Terrebonne and Lafourche parishes, schools were closed because of uncertainties regarding Jeanne's path. The hurricane center also expected Jeanne to make landfall in southwestern Louisiana, although the hurricane eventually stayed offshore; thousands of residents moved inland, while Civil Defense officials remained alert. Forecasters expected locally heavy rainfall, although they suggested it would remain below 8inches (203mm).|$|E
5|$|The {{large area}} of {{convection}} associated with Alberto dropped rainfall across Florida for several days. The statewide precipitation maximum reached 7.08inches (180mm) at a station 5miles (8km) east of <b>Tarpon</b> Springs. The highest sustained winds {{from the storm}} were officially clocked at 40mph (65km/h) in St. Petersburg, which also saw reports of wind gusts of up to 56mph (90km/h). Upon making landfall on the Florida Panhandle, the storm produced a storm tide which unofficially peaked at 7.3feet (2.2m) at Crystal River Power Plant. The combination of high surf and the storm tide caused surge flooding along the Florida Panhandle. Six tornadoes were spawned in the state from the outer rainbands of Alberto, none of which caused serious damage.|$|E
