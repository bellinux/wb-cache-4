5|$|United States v. Kagama, 118 U.S. 375 (1886), was a United States Supreme Court {{case that}} upheld <b>the</b> <b>constitutionality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Major Crimes Act of 1885. This Congressional act gave {{the federal courts}} {{jurisdiction}} in certain cases of Indian-on-Indian crimes, even if the crimes were committed on an Indian reservation. Kagama, a Yurok Native American (Indian) accused of murder, was selected as a test case by the Department of Justice to test <b>the</b> <b>constitutionality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Act.|$|E
5|$|When {{the matter}} was decided by the Illinois Supreme Court, they agreed with the Seventh Circuit and {{declared}} the AUUF law unconstitutional, but upheld <b>the</b> <b>constitutionality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> UPF law.|$|E
5|$|Since {{this case}} {{challenged}} {{the authority of}} the federal courts to try Indian-on-Indian crime, this case was heard as an interlocutory appeal, meaning that the Supreme Court would have to decide <b>the</b> <b>constitutionality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> claimed jurisdiction before Kagama could be tried for the killing of Iyouse in federal court.|$|E

5|$|The ACLU was at {{the center}} of several legal aspects of the Vietnam war: {{defending}} draft resisters, challenging <b>the</b> <b>constitutionality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> war, the potential impeachment of Richard Nixon, and the use of national security concerns to preemptively censor newspapers.|$|E
5|$|A {{person is}} disqualified from voting in certain circumstances, which include {{engaging}} in acts incompatible {{with being a}} Singapore citizen, being of unsound mind, or being in prison for committing a criminal offence. <b>The</b> <b>constitutionality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> statutory provisions denying prisoners {{the right to vote}} has not yet become an issue in Singapore, though it has been controversial in some foreign jurisdictions.|$|E
5|$|The Hobbs Act, the Travel Act, and the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) {{have been}} upheld under the Commerce Clause. The mail fraud statute has been {{justified}} under the Postal Clause. In Sabri v. United States (2004), the Supreme Court upheld <b>the</b> <b>constitutionality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> program bribery statute, 18 U.S.C. § 666, under the Spending Clause (with Justice Clarence Thomas citing the Commerce Clause in concurrence). Prior to Sabri, several circuit courts had already so held.|$|E

2500|$|On July 8, 2009, Massachusetts Attorney General Martha Coakley filed a suit, Massachusetts v. United States Department of Health and Human Services, {{challenging}} <b>the</b> <b>constitutionality</b> <b>of</b> DOMA. <b>The</b> suit {{claims that}} Congress [...] "overstepped its authority, undermined states' efforts to recognize marriages between same-sex couples, and codified an animus towards {{gay and lesbian}} people."

5|$|The Supreme Court's {{decision}} did {{not specifically}} address <b>the</b> <b>constitutionality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> older {{portion of the}} statute which prohibits the unauthorized wearing, manufacturing, or sale of military medals or decorations.

5|$|The {{crux of the}} High Court's holding {{rested on}} stage 3(b), as {{illustrated}} in the table below. In analysing <b>the</b> <b>constitutionality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> provision with regards to {{this portion of the}} reasonable classification test, the Court first ascertained the object of section 37(1) of the PCA. It subsequently considered if differentiation on the basis of citizenship was a reasonable means of attaining the objective.|$|E
5|$|Given Armstrong's concerns, the {{administration}} employed general counsel J.

While the suit was pending, the Lexington Herald-Leader reported that {{the administration}} had failed to include the interest on the bonds used to finance the expenditures in its estimation of the cost; this, plus the cost overruns reported by the Herald-Leader, had already pushed {{the total cost of}} the package to about $354million by late September 1986. In October, Toyota agreed to cover the cost overruns associated with preparing the site for construction.|$|E

40|$|When <b>the</b> concept <b>of</b> “supremacy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Constitution” appeared, it {{also brought}} into {{discussion}} its protection. Thus, slowly but surely, different means <b>of</b> protecting <b>the</b> Constitution and its supremacy took shape, including <b>the</b> control <b>of</b> <b>constitutionality.</b> <b>The</b> purpose <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>constitutionality</b> control – <b>the</b> protection <b>of</b> <b>the</b> constitution – is fully achieved {{only when the}} cases <b>the</b> restriction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fundamental law circumscribe to the control. The modern Romanian constitutional system established also <b>the</b> control <b>of</b> <b>constitutionality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> initiatives for revision <b>of</b> <b>the</b> constitution forwarded to the Constitution’s “guardian” – <b>the</b> Constitutional Court <b>of</b> Romania. This paper features a review of key aspects regarding <b>the</b> exercise <b>of</b> constitutional control initiatives to revise the Constitution such as: the competent authority and <b>the</b> foundation <b>of</b> that power, <b>the</b> notification procedure, <b>the</b> procedure <b>of</b> exercising <b>the</b> control for that mater, <b>the</b> solutions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Constitutional Court and a summary <b>of</b> <b>the</b> practice <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Constitutional Court <b>of</b> Romania in this field.

5|$|In 2003, she was {{the leader}} of the {{initiative}} to challenge <b>the</b> <b>constitutionality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Children's Internet Protection Act. Her efforts led to a partial victory for anti-censorship campaigners; the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that the law was constitutional, but that filtering software on computers in public libraries could be turned off if so requested by an adult guardian. Krug warned that the filters used to censor Internet pornography from children were not perfect and risked blocking educational information about social matters, sexuality, and healthcare.|$|E
5|$|In July 2004, Hamdan {{was charged}} with {{conspiracy}} to commit terrorism, and the Bush administration made arrangements to try him before a military commission, established by the Department of Defense under Military Commission Order No. 1 of March 21, 2002. He was assigned a defense counsel, LCDR Charles D. Swift from the Navy JAG, who with a legal team filed a petition for Hamdan in US District Court for a writ of habeas corpus, challenging <b>the</b> <b>constitutionality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> military commission, and saying that it lacked the protections required under the Geneva Conventions and United States Uniform Code of Military Justice.|$|E
5|$|On 20 January 1999, Jeyaretnam {{wrote to}} President Ong Teng Cheong {{requesting}} the reference of another constitutional {{question to the}} Tribunal. This was made {{on behalf of his}} client, opposition politician Chee Soon Juan, who had been charged for giving a public talk on 20 December 1999 without a licence under the Public Entertainments Act. The question involved <b>the</b> <b>constitutionality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Act. Jeyaretnam argued that the Act violated Articles 14(1)(a) and (b) of the Constitution, which enshrines freedom of speech and assembly.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> Constitutional Court <b>of</b> Hungary is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{highest level}} actors {{independent}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{politics in the}} country. The Constitutional Court serves as the main body for <b>the</b> protection <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Constitution, its tasks being <b>the</b> review <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>constitutionality</b> <b>of</b> statutes. <b>The</b> Constitutional Court performs its tasks independently. With its own budget and its judges being elected by Parliament it does not constitute a part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ordinary judicial system. The constitutional court passes on <b>the</b> <b>constitutionality</b> <b>of</b> laws, {{and there is no}} right of appeal on these decisions.|$|R
500|$|Rowan was {{appointed}} {{as a judge}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Kentucky Court <b>of</b> Appeals in 1819. During his time as a justice, he delivered a notable opinion opposing <b>the</b> <b>constitutionality</b> <b>of</b> chartering <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Second Bank <b>of</b> <b>the</b> United States. He also opined that the General Assembly was within its rightful powers to enact a tax on the Bank. In <b>the</b> case <b>of</b> McCulloch v. Maryland, the U.S. Supreme Court delivered a contradictory opinion. Dissatisfied with <b>the</b> confinement <b>of</b> service on <b>the</b> bench, Rowan resigned from the court in 1821. Though his service was brief, he {{was referred to as}} [...] "Judge Rowan" [...] for <b>the</b> rest <b>of</b> his life.|$|R
50|$|ARET functioned {{primarily}} as a cooperative legal service. Each member paid annual dues of $15 to fund lawsuits challenging <b>the</b> <b>constitutionality</b> <b>of</b> real-estate assessments. <b>The</b> suits, when finally filed, took <b>the</b> form <b>of</b> a 7,000-page, two-foot-thick book listing the names and tax data for all 26,000 co-litigants.|$|R
5|$|The Citizenship Clause {{overruled}} the Supreme Court's Dred Scott {{decision that}} black people were not citizens and could not become citizens, nor enjoy the benefits of citizenship. Some members of Congress voted for the Fourteenth Amendment in order to eliminate doubts about <b>the</b> <b>constitutionality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Civil Rights Act of 1866, or {{to ensure that no}} subsequent Congress could later repeal or alter the main provisions of that Act. The Civil Rights Act of 1866 had granted citizenship to all persons born in the United States if they were not subject to a foreign power, and this clause of the Fourteenth Amendment constitutionalized this rule.|$|E
5|$|The {{importance}} of the ruling {{in this case was}} that it tested <b>the</b> <b>constitutionality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Act and confirmed Congress' authority over Indian affairs. Plenary power over Indian tribes, supposedly granted to the U.S. Congress by the Commerce Clause of the Constitution, was not deemed necessary to support the Supreme Court in this decision; instead, the Court found the power in the tribes' status as dependent domestic nations. This allowed Congress to pass the Dawes Act the following year. The case has been criticized by legal scholars as drawing on powers that are not granted to Congress by the Constitution. It remains , despite that criticism.|$|E
5|$|Although Roosevelt, {{most of his}} aides, Johnson, and the NRA staff {{felt the}} Act would survive a court test, the U.S. Department of Justice had on March 25, 1935, {{declined}} to appeal an appellate court ruling overturning the lumber industry code {{on the grounds that}} the case was not a good test of the NIRA's constitutionality. The Justice Department's action worried many in the administration. But on April 1, 1935 the Second Circuit Court of Appeals upheld <b>the</b> <b>constitutionality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> NIRA in the Schechter case. Although Donald Richberg and others felt the government's case in Schechter was not a strong one, the Schechters were determined to appeal their conviction. So the government appealed first, and the Supreme Court heard oral argument on May 2 and 3.|$|E
50|$|A {{referendum}} on <b>the</b> direct election <b>of</b> <b>the</b> President {{was held in}} France on 28 October 1962. The question was whether to have <b>the</b> president <b>of</b> <b>the</b> French Republic elected by direct popular vote, rather than by an electoral college. It was approved by 62.3% of voters with a 77.0% turnout. However, the reform was controversial because it strengthened the executive at <b>the</b> expense <b>of</b> Parliament, and because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> disputed <b>constitutionality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> procedure used.|$|R

50|$|After <b>the</b> Constitutional Amendment <b>of</b> 2001 <b>the</b> Plenary Session (and not the Chambers) is {{the only}} {{competent}} to judge <b>the</b> <b>constitutionality</b> <b>of</b> laws. <b>The</b> Plenary Session is, also, competent: a) for cases of general interest that the President introduces directly into it, b) for cases that one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Chambers submits to it. These cases are submitted by the Chambers to the Plenary Session for two reasons: either because they are cases of general interest or because the applicable legislative provision is judged unconstitutional.|$|R
5|$|Immediately {{after his}} inauguration, Jefferson {{instructed}} his Secretary of State, James Madison, to stop delivery on all outstanding commissions. Further, {{an act of}} March 8, 1802 the abolished the circuit court judgeships created by the Midnight Judges Act (15 of which had already been filled), restoring the system created under the 1789 and 1793 acts. Federalists viewed this as unconstitutional and looked to the then-pending case of Marbury v. Madisonconcerning a confirmed D.C. {{justice of the peace}} who had not received his commissionas a test case for <b>the</b> <b>constitutionality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> repeal. The next session of the Supreme Court was in June, one month before the repeal would take effect. But, the Judiciary Act of 1802 delayed the Court's next session until February 1803, and made other changes to the structure of the judicial system.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, Krug led the {{challenge}} to <b>the</b> <b>constitutionality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Children's Internet Protection Act. Her efforts led to a partial victory for the Act's opponents; the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that the law was constitutional, but that internet filtering software on computers in public libraries could be turned off if so requested by an adult guardian. She said that filters used to censor Internet pornography from children were not perfect and risked blocking educational information about social matters, sexuality, and healthcare.

5|$|In Chan Hiang Leng Colin v. Public Prosecutor (1994), the Minister of Home Affairs had deregistered the Jehovah's Witnesses by Order No. 179/1972 made {{pursuant}} to section 24(1)(a) of the Societies Act. This provision {{allows for the}} dissolution of registered organizations considered to be threats to public peace, welfare or good order. The Minister had also made Order No. 123/1972 and Order No. 405/1994 {{pursuant to}} section 3(1) of the Undesirable Publications Act, prohibiting publications by the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society relating to the Jehovah's Witnesses. The appellants were convicted in a district court for possession of prohibited publications. They appealed and sought to challenge <b>the</b> <b>constitutionality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Minister's prohibition order and the deregistration of the Jehovah's Witnesses, arguing that their right to freedom of religion guaranteed by Article 15(1) of the Constitution had been infringed.|$|E
50|$|However, <b>the</b> ground <b>of</b> which <b>the</b> {{court found}} in favour <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Federation <b>of</b> Pakistan called into {{question}} <b>the</b> validity <b>of</b> all legislation passed by the Assembly, not to mention <b>the</b> unconstitutionality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Assembly itself since 1950. To solve this problem, the Governor-General invoked Emergency Powers to retrospectively validate <b>the</b> Acts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Constituent Assembly. An appeal was filed against the Governor-General for invoking emergency powers and the Chief Justice had to determine <b>the</b> <b>constitutionality</b> <b>of</b> invoking <b>the</b> Emergency Powers and whether the Governor-General could give his assent to legislation retroactively.|$|R
