5|$|An annual battle reenactment {{takes place}} on 15 July. In 2010 a pageant reenacting the event and commemorating the battle's 600th anniversary was held. It {{attracted}} 200,000 spectators who watched 2,200 participants {{playing the role of}} knights in a reenactment of the battle. An additional 3,800 participants played peasants and camp followers. The pageant's organizers believe <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>event</b> has become the largest reenactment of medieval combat in Europe.|$|E

Tickets sales for the event went on sale on July 22, 2011.|$|E
5|$|Severe {{flooding}} in Calgary {{two weeks before}} the July 5 opening of the 2013 Stampede caused significant damage to the grounds.

Some of the main events, and all concerts, scheduled for the Saddledome were cancelled due to flood damage to the facility, while other events were relocated to other locations.|$|E

5|$|The Monk {{wrote of}} the event in the Histoire de Charles VI (History of Charles VI), {{covering}} about 25 years of the King's reign. He seemed to disapprove on the grounds <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>event</b> broke social mores and the King's conduct was unbecoming, whereas Froissart {{described it as a}} celebratory event.|$|E
5|$|Victor Meldrew {{had become}} such a {{cultural}} icon that many fans left messages and flowers {{at the location of}} his death.

5|$|Following the {{assassination}} of former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, Dodd released a statement while campaigning that elaborated on his experiences with the slain leader. He commented <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>event</b> was an important time in both Pakistan and the United States that will impact the future of both nation's security. He described the significance of America's responsibility to keep democracy {{in the nation and}} the region as a whole. Following the statement Dodd completed the year's campaigning by attending New Year's Eve parties in cities in the first caucus state of Iowa.|$|E

5|$|He {{was tried}} before Curiohaus war crimes court in Rotherbaum, in Court Number 5 on Monday, 11 October 1948. Knöchlein's defence hinged on {{the claim that}} he was not present at the massacre, {{although}} his lawyers did not deny <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>event</b> took place. They also claimed that the British had used dumdum bullets during the battle and misused a flag of truce; all of which were vigorously denied by the prosecution. Evidence was given by Pooley, O'Callaghan, Madame Duquenne-Creton, and a French civilian who testified to recognising Knöchlein.|$|E
5|$|In a {{television}} report taped and broadcast {{shortly after the}} bombing, Tuđman said that the attack {{appears to have been}} meant to destroy the Banski dvori as the seat of the statehood of Croatia, and as a decapitation strike. He concluded with statements of resolve to end foreign occupation and rebuild the nation. Marković telephoned his office in Belgrade blaming Yugoslav Defence Secretary General Veljko Kadijević for the attack. He demanded his resignation, threatening not to return to Belgrade until Kadijević was out of office. The Yugoslav Defence Ministry brushed away the accusation, claiming that the attack was not authorized by the central command and suggesting <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>event</b> might have been stage-managed by the Croatian authorities. The Yugoslav military later suggested that Croatian leadership planted plastic explosives in the Banski dvori.|$|E
5|$|Stela 8 is a well-preserved {{monument}} on {{the south}} side of Structure A-3. Here king Wat'ul Chatel wears jaguar claws on his hands and feet, together with other attributes of the Bearded Jaguar God. In one hand the king holds the head of the god K'awiil. The text describes a visitor named Hakawitzil, an early form of Jacawitz, the name of one of the patron gods of the Postclassic K'iche' Kingdom of Q'umarkaj in the Guatemalan Highlands. Schele and Mathews propose <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>event</b> depicted on this stela gave rise to the foundation legends of the K'iche' people.|$|E

5|$|Ten French {{manufacturers}} entered {{cars in the}} Grand Prix: Clément-Bayard, Hotchkiss, Gobron-Brillié, Darracq, Vulpes, Brasier (the {{successor to}} Richard-Brasier), Panhard, Grégoire, Lorraine-Dietrich and Renault. Two teams came from Italy (FIAT and Itala) and one (Mercedes) from Germany. With the exceptions of Gobron-Brillié and Vulpes, which each entered one car, and Grégoire, which entered two cars, each team entered three cars, to make a total field of thirty-four entries. No British or American manufacturers entered the Grand Prix. The British were suspicious <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>event</b> was designed as propaganda for the French automobile industry; British magazine The Motor quoted French daily newspaper Le Petit Parisien as evidence of this supposed lack of sportsmanship.|$|E
5|$|That fall, the fourteen-year-old Tatiana {{experienced}} {{her first}} brush with violence when she witnessed {{the assassination of}} the government minister Pyotr Stolypin during a performance at the Kiev Opera House. Tatiana and her older sister Olga had followed their father back to his opera box and witnessed the shooting. Her father later wrote to his mother, Dowager Empress Maria, on 10 September 1911, <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>event</b> had upset both girls. Tatiana sobbed and both of them had trouble sleeping that night.|$|E
5|$|The 2015 United States Grand Prix (formally {{known as}} the 2015 Formula 1 United States Grand Prix) was a Formula One motor race that took place on 25 October 2015. The race was contested over fifty-six laps and held at the Circuit of the Americas. It was the sixteenth round of the 2015 season and marked the thirty-seventh time that the United States Grand Prix was run as a round of the World Championship since its {{inception}} in , and the fourth time <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>event</b> was hosted at this circuit.|$|E

5|$|The Flames were {{inundated}} with complaints from season ticket holders upset by their seat assignments {{and the cost}} of tickets. King responded to the concerns by noting that the league had purchased the game from the Flames, and the team was given a limited allotment of seats for its ticket holders. He also noted that it was possible <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>event</b> would lose money, even at ticket prices ranging between $49 and $249, but that the team brought the Heritage Classic to Calgary because the fans wanted the game to return to Canada. The Pittsburgh Penguins and Buffalo Sabres encountered similar issues allocating tickets for the Winter Classic.|$|E
5|$|The Pichilemu {{earthquake}} {{was caused}} by the change in regional stress from the 27February earthquake. Preliminary analyses by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) of the 11March earthquake locations and seismic-wave radiation patterns suggested <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>event</b> resulted from normal faulting within the subducting Nazca plate or the overriding South America plate, unlike the 27 February earthquake, which occurred as thrust faulting on the interface between the two plates. Later in 2010, University of Chile Seismologist Sergio Barrientos stated that the earthquake was produced inside the South American plate. While news media reported the earthquake as an aftershock of the February earthquake in Chile, a preliminary geological summary issued by the USGS considered it to be an independent earthquake, a conclusion which seismologist Jaime Campos of the University of Chile also reached.|$|E
5|$|The Referendum Party {{decided not}} to contest any of the by-elections {{that took place in}} 1996 and 1997. For the 1997 general election, it hurried its {{selection}} of candidates, who had only one interview—and no background checks or screening—before acceptance. The funding for each candidate's official campaign was supplied entirely by the party centre. Candidates were brought to a training day at a Manchester hotel in February 1997, where they were presented with several hours of speeches and given a handbook. Many felt <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>event</b> had been a public relations exercise rather than a concerted effort to train candidates.|$|E

40|$|This {{investigation}} {{sought to}} explore the relationship of Julian Rotter's concept of internal versus external control (I-E) to stages of moral judgment. The I-E dimension {{is defined as the}} attribution by the individual of responsibility for behavioral outcomes to either oneself or to outside entities. The internal oriented person believes <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>events</b> in which he is involved lie within his control. Conversely, the external oriented person believes <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>events</b> <b>that</b> happen to him are controlled by other factors...|$|R

5|$|Though {{the game}} {{involved}} two Canadian teams, the NHL hoped <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>event</b> would prove a successful {{draw in the}} U.S. To that end, the league scheduled the Heritage Classic as {{the only game in}} prime time, while NBC debuted its Hockey Day in America with a pair of regional doubleheaders that led into the telecast; throughout NBC's telecast, commercials advised viewers to change to Versus for the Heritage Classic once the American games finished. University of Alberta sports economist Brad Humphreys questioned the league's ambitions, arguing that a game without an American team would not appeal. He stated that the game was being held to placate the Canadian audience, but noted that it was important for the NHL to keep the league's Canadian audience happy.|$|E
5|$|Tickets for {{the event}} {{commenced}} sale to the public on November 3, 2007. WWE and the City of Orlando hosted festivities that spanned a five-day period within the central Florida region. For the second consecutive year, WrestleMania broke {{the record for the}} highest-grossing pay-per-view in WWE history. It also set a gate record for the Citrus Bowl, grossing US$5.85million in ticket sales. According to a study by Enigma Research Corporation of Toronto, the Citrus Bowl's record-breaking attendance brought an estimated $51.5million – surpassing the projected $25million – into the local economy and generated $1.8million in local tax revenue. The Central Florida Sports Commission reported <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>event</b> created jobs and brought approximately 60,000 visitors to the city. Over one million people ordered the event on pay-per-view, grossing $23.8 million in revenue.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{approaches}} {{have been used}} to estimate the year of the crucifixion of Jesus. Most scholars agree that he died in 30 or 33 AD. The gospels state <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>event</b> occurred during the prefecture of Pilate, the Roman governor of Judea from 26 to 36 AD. The date for the conversion of Paul (estimated to be 33–36 AD) acts as an upper bound for the date of Crucifixion. The dates for Paul's conversion and ministry can be determined by analyzing the Pauline epistles and the Acts of the Apostles. Astronomers have tried to estimate the precise date of the Crucifixion by analyzing lunar motion and calculating historic dates of Passover, a festival based on the lunisolar Hebrew calendar. The most widely accepted dates derived from this method are April 7, 30 AD, and April 3, 33 AD (both Julian).|$|E
