5000|$|Jean Piaget {{stressed}} the importance of play in children, especially play that involves role taking. [...] He believed that role taking play in children promotes a more mature social understanding by teaching children to take on the roles of others, allowing them to understand that different people can have differing perspectives. [...] In addition, Piaget argued that good solutions to interpersonal conflicts involve compromise which arises out of our ability to consider the points of view of others.Two of Piaget’s fundamental concepts have primarily influenced role <b>taking</b> <b>theory.</b> The first is egocentrism, the mode of thinking that characterizes preoperational thinking, which is the child’s failure to consider the world from other points of view. [...] The second is decentration, the mode of thinking that characterizes operational thinking, which is the child’s growing ability to perceive the world with more than one perspective in mind. [...] In Piagetian theory, these concepts were used to describe solely cognitive development, but they have been applied in role <b>taking</b> <b>theory</b> to the social domain.|$|E

The Court has relied on Armstrong to show {{the purpose of the}} Takings Clause in many takings decisions. However, can Armstrong serve a greater purpose? In Dolan v.

50|$|Selman {{published}} The Growth of Interpersonal Understanding: Developmental and Clinical Analyses in 1980. This text introduced Selman’s {{general framework}} and empirical background for theories for his social perspective <b>taking</b> <b>theory,</b> {{and served as}} the precursor for his future works. In 1997, Selman co-edited Fostering Friendship: Pair Therapy for Treatment and Prevention with Lynn Hickey Shultz {{a professor of psychology}} at Harvard University and Caroline Watts a lecturer and researcher at Harvard University. Fostering Friendship introduces “pair-therapy” as a therapeutic intervention method designed to help children develop healthy interpersonal relationships. The method is suggested by physicians for clinical settings. This approach, which involves developing a nurturing relationship between an adult and two children, is also used outside of clinical settings as a prevention method used by counselors and teachers in public schools, daycare centers, and other youth development settings.|$|E
5000|$|Evidence that Piaget’s {{cognitive}} theories can {{be applied}} to the interpersonal aspects of role <b>taking</b> <b>theory</b> comes from two sources. The first is empirical evidence that children’s ability to role take is correlated to their IQ and performance on Piagetian tests. [...] Secondly, the two theories have been conceptually linked in that Selman’s role taking stages correspond to Piaget’s cognitive development stages, where preoperational children are at level 1 or 2, concrete operators are at level 3 or 4, and formal operators are at level 4 or 5 of Selman’s stages. [...] Given this relation, Feffer [...] and Feffer and Gourevitch [...] have argued that social role taking is an extension of decentering in the social sphere. Selman has argued this same point, also noting that the growth of role taking ability is brought on by the child’s decreased egocentrism as he/she ages.|$|E

5000|$|Evidence {{in support}} of this view comes first from three reviews which showed {{moderate}} correlations between Selman’s role <b>taking</b> <b>theory,</b> Piaget’s cognitive developmental stages, and Kohlberg’s moral developmental stages. More evidence comes from Walker and Richards’s finding that moral development to Kohlberg’s stage 4 occurred only for those who already had early basic formal operations according to Piaget’s developmental theory, and not for those in an earlier stage. [...] Similarly, Paolitto’s attempts to stimulate moral development worked only for subjects who already attained the corresponding role taking stage. Previous research has also shown that short role taking treatments, such as exposing subjects to the role taking reasoning of subjects in one stage higher, can lead to moral development. [...] In more general demonstrations of this argument, Faust and Arbuthnot and other researchers have shown that moral development is most probable for subjects with higher cognitive development.|$|E
40|$|A {{number of}} social {{cognition}} studies posit that humans spontaneously compute the viewpoint of other individuals. This is based on experiments showing that responses are shorter when a human agent, located in a visual display, can see the stimuli relevant to the observer’s task. Similarly, responses are slower when the agent cannot see the task-relevant stimuli. We tested the spontaneous perspective <b>taking</b> <b>theory</b> by incorporating it within two classic visual cognition paradigms (i. e., the flanker effect and the Simon effect), as well as reassessing {{its role in the}} gaze cueing effect. Results showed that these phenomena (e. g., the Simon effect) are not modulated according to whether a gazing agent can see the critical stimuli or not. We also examined the claim that previous results attributed to spontaneous perspective taking are due to the gazing agent’s ability to shift attention laterally. Results found no evidence of this. Overall, these data challenge both the spontaneous perspective <b>taking</b> <b>theory,</b> as well as the attentional shift hypothesis...|$|E

Here, we report the first study to trace the development of hindsight bias across the life span. One hundred ninety-four participants aged 3 to 95 years completed 3 tasks designed to measure visual and verbal hindsight bias. All age groups demonstrated hindsight bias on all 3 tasks; however, preschoolers and older adults exhibited more bias than older children and younger adults. Multinomial processing tree analyses of these data revealed that preschoolers ’ enhanced hindsight bias resulted from them substituting the correct answer for their original answer in their recall (a qualitative error). Conversely, older adults’ enhanced hindsight bias resulted from them forgetting their original answer and recalling an answer closer to, but not equal to, the correct answer (a quantitative error).

40|$|Autism {{spectrum}} {{disorder is}} characterized by interpersonal deficits and {{has been associated with}} limited cognitive empathy, which includes perspective <b>taking,</b> <b>theory</b> of mind, and empathic accuracy (EA). The capacity for affective empathy may also be impaired. In the present study we aimed to determine if EA in normally developing individuals with varying levels of autism spectrum traits is moderated by trait affective empathy. Fifty male and fifty female participants (‘perceivers’) completed the Autism-Spectrum Quotient and the Balanced Emotional Empathy Scale to assess autism spectrum traits and trait affective empathy, respectively. EA was assessed using a Dutch-language version of a previously developed task and involved rating the feelings of others (‘targets’) verbally recounting autobiographical emotional events. Targets varied in trait emotional expressivity, assessed using the Berkeley Expressivity Questionnaire. Perceivers with more autism spectrum traits performed worse on the EA task, particularly when their trait affective empathy was relatively low. Interpersonal deficits in autism spectrum disorder may be partially explained by low cognitive empathy. Further, they might be aggravated by a limited capacity for affective empathy...|$|E

Correlations between the components showed {{a positive relationship between}} worry/concern and probability of injury, and negative relationships between worry/concern and confidence in avoiding injury as well as probability of injury and confidence in avoiding injury. Results also indicated that those athletes who had been previously injured perceived the highest probability of re-injury, demonstrated the greatest worry/concern of re-injury, and had the least amount of {{confidence in their ability to}} avoid re-injury.
