5|$|Currently, {{the most}} {{significant}} and long-term <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Thai population could be the annual burning of forest areas, which is most prevalent during the bat's breeding season.

5|$|Hedgehogs are not {{native to}} the Outer Hebrides—they were {{introduced}} in the 1970s to reduce garden pests—and their spread poses a <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> eggs of ground nesting wading birds. In 2003, Scottish Natural Heritage undertook culls of hedgehogs in the area although these were halted in 2007 due to protests; trapped animals were instead relocated to the mainland.|$|E

5|$|In the Balkan frontier, the Treaty of Devol {{marked the}} end of the Norman <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{southern}} Adriatic littoral during Alexios' reign and later; the efficacy of the frontier defenses deterred any further invasions through Dyrrachium for most of the 12th century.|$|E

The goals of this project are <b>to</b> assess <b>the</b> competitive position of NADEP North Island, <b>to</b> identify <b>threats</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> organization, and then to offer recommendations for external organizational marketing that will reduce or mitigate these <b>threats</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> organization. The organizational marketing campaign should serve to strengthen external stakeholder interest in NADEP North Island, thereby reducing <b>threats</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> organization and increasing its competitive position in today's unique defense environment.

5|$|This high {{concentration}} and oppressive {{treatment of the}} slave population led to rebellions. In 135 BC and 104 BC, the First and Second Servile Wars, respectively, erupted in Sicily, where small bands of rebels found {{tens of thousands of}} willing followers wishing to escape the oppressive life of a Roman slave. While these were considered serious civil disturbances by the Roman Senate, taking years and direct military intervention to quell, they were never considered a serious <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Republic. The Roman heartland had never seen a slave uprising, nor had slaves ever been seen as a potential <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> city of Rome. This would all change with the Third Servile War.|$|E

5|$|About a {{thousand}} pilot whales are killed this way {{each year on}} the Faroe Islands together with usually a few dozen up to a few hundred animals belonging to other small cetaceans species, but numbers vary greatly per year.

5|$|Adults {{and their}} young may be preyed upon by {{mammalian}} predators, {{such as the}} red fox (Vulpes vulpes) or the feral cat (Felis catus), and native predatory birds, such as the Australian magpie (Gymnorhina tibicen), butcherbird species (Cracticus spp.), laughing kookaburra (Dacelo novaeguineae), currawongs (Strepera spp.), crows and ravens (Corvus spp.), shrike-thrushes (Colluricincla spp.) and reptiles such as goannas. Another <b>threat</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> birds is from humans; many nests are trampled on (even by the occasional bird watcher) during breeding season because the nests are hidden {{close to the ground}} and therefore difficult for passers-by to spot.|$|E
