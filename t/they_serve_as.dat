5|$|In Mark, {{the disciples}} play hardly any role {{other than a}} {{negative}} one. While others sometimes respond to Jesus with complete faith, his disciples are puzzled and doubtful. <b>They</b> <b>serve</b> <b>as</b> a foil to Jesus and to other characters. The failings of the disciples are probably exaggerated in Mark, and the disciples make a better showing in Matthew and Luke.|$|E

5|$|Many {{proteins}} {{are composed}} of several protein domains, i.e. segments of a protein that fold into distinct structural units. Domains usually also have specific functions, such as enzymatic activities (e.g. kinase) or <b>they</b> <b>serve</b> <b>as</b> binding modules (e.g. the SH3 domain binds to proline-rich sequences in other proteins).|$|E
5|$|Some viruses {{can cause}} lifelong or chronic infections where the viruses {{continue}} to reproduce {{in the body}} despite the host's defence mechanisms. This is common in hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus infections. People chronically infected with a virus are known as carriers. <b>They</b> <b>serve</b> <b>as</b> important reservoirs of the virus.

5|$|A promotional live-action tie-in web series/miniseries titled Bright Falls {{was made}} {{available}} {{a few weeks}} before the game's release on the web and the Xbox Live service. The six episodes of Bright Falls were co-written and directed by Phillip Van, and <b>they</b> <b>serve</b> <b>as</b> a prequel to the game, set in the eponymous town before Alan Wake arrives there. The main character in the series is Jake Fischer (played by Christopher Forsyth), a newspaper reporter who visits the town on business.|$|E
5|$|Healthy {{adults do}} not have many predators, but human {{activities}} pose many threats. Collisions with power lines, hunting, intentional poisoning, lead accumulation from ingesting gunshot in carcasses, and pesticide accumulation take a toll on populations. Young birds at the nest are sometimes taken by golden eagles, eagle owls, and red foxes. Only rarely do adult birds attempt to drive away predators. Young birds that fall off of cliff ledges may be preyed on by mammalian predators such as jackals, foxes and wolves. Like all birds <b>they</b> <b>serve</b> <b>as</b> hosts for ectoparasitic birdlice including Aegypoecus perspicuus as well as organisms that live within them such as mycoplasmas.|$|E

An active environmentalist, Scott has also joined with WWF-Canada to speak out in favour of efforts to maintain British Columbia's natural wilderness.|$|E
5|$|The {{holes in}} the cuticle which allow for this {{digestive}} mechanism pose a challenge for the plant, since <b>they</b> <b>serve</b> <b>as</b> breaks in the cuticle (waxy layer) that protects the plant from desiccation. As a result, P. moranensis is usually found in relatively humid environments. The production of the stalked capture glands and sessile digestive glands is also costly. A {{recent study found that}} the density of these respective glands can be correlated to environmental gradients. For example, capture gland density was found to be highest where prey availability was low, whereas digestive glands density showed direct correlation to prey availability. These results suggest that the amount of investment in carnivorous features is an adaptation to the environmental gradients.|$|E

5|$|There {{are three}} {{business}} routes of US Highway 10 {{in the state}} of Michigan. <b>They</b> <b>serve</b> <b>as</b> connections from the main highway into Reed City, Clare and Midland. Additionally, there were another two business routes that connected US Highway 10 (US10) to the downtowns of Flint and Pontiac. All of these business routes are, or were, former sections of US10 that were marked Business US Highway10 (Bus. US10) after the main highway was realigned to bypass the downtowns of the cities.|$|E
5|$|For {{almost all}} of their history, Serjeants at Law and King's Serjeants were the only advocates given rights of {{audience}} in the Court of Common Pleas. Until the 17th century they were also first {{in the order of}} precedence in the Court of King's Bench and Court of Chancery, which gave them priority in motions before the court. Serjeants also had the privilege of being immune from most normal forms of lawsuit – they could only be sued by a writ from the Court of Chancery. It was held as an extension of this that servants of Serjeants could only be sued in the Common Pleas. As part of the Court of Common Pleas the Serjeants also performed some judicial duties, such as levying fines. In exchange for these privileges, Serjeants were expected to fulfil certain duties; firstly, that they represent anybody who asked regardless of their ability to pay, and secondly that, due to the small number of judges, <b>they</b> <b>serve</b> <b>as</b> deputy judges to hear cases when there was no judge available.|$|E
5|$|Most proteins, ribosomal subunits, {{and some}} DNAs are transported through the pore {{complexes}} {{in a process}} mediated by a family of transport factors known as karyopherins. Those karyopherins that mediate movement into the nucleus are also called importins, whereas those that mediate movement out of the nucleus are called exportins. Most karyopherins interact directly with their cargo, although some use adaptor proteins. Steroid hormones such as cortisol and aldosterone, {{as well as other}} small lipid-soluble molecules involved in intercellular signaling, can diffuse through the cell membrane and into the cytoplasm, where they bind nuclear receptor proteins that are trafficked into the nucleus. There <b>they</b> <b>serve</b> <b>as</b> transcription factors when bound to their ligand; {{in the absence of a}} ligand, many such receptors function as histone deacetylases that repress gene expression.|$|E

The Executive Director serves ex officio without a vote, while the three officers and the previous year's president serve as voting members of the body. The remaining seven positions are specifically elected and held {{by members of the}} LSA. One is a student member, elected to a two-year term, while the remaining six are full members elected to three year terms. The elections for the three-year terms are staggered, with two members elected each year.

5|$|The Linguistic Society of America (LSA) {{is governed}} by three {{officers}} and an executive committee. The three officers—president, vice-president, and secretary-treasurer—are elected {{by the members of}} the LSA. The President, elected to a one-year term, serves as the chair of the executive committee, as well as presiding over {{the annual meeting of the}} Society. The president is first elected to the vice-presidency for a one year-term, which also carries the title of president-elect, and then assumes the presidency at the conclusion of the annual meeting. The Secretary-Treasurer is nominated by the Executive Committee and elected by the membership to a five-year term. <b>They</b> <b>serve</b> <b>as</b> the Chief Financial Officer of the LSA. Larry Hyman currently serves as President for 2017, with Penny Eckert as Vice-President.

5|$|The highway {{begins as}} two one-way streets, Goodell Street (traveling west) and East Tupper Street (traveling east).

It initially travels through dense urban areas {{by way of a}} cut, in which both roadways are separated only by a Jersey barrier. The expressway runs past the Buffalo Museum of Science, located at Martin Luther King, Jr. Park, and through the middle of Humboldt Parkway in Buffalo, where the Scajaquada Expressway (NY198) leaves at the former exit for Main Street. The section of the expressway between the Scajaquada and Harlem Road (NY240) just outside the city limit is the busiest on all of NY33, handling in excess of 100,000 vehicles per day in areas.|$|E
