Part of the {{proceeds}} from the game are sent to a charity – initially iFred, but this was later changed to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline after the game was released on Steam.|$|E
5|$|A Project Leader {{is elected}} once per {{year by the}} developers. The leader has special powers, {{but they are not}} absolute, and {{appoints}} delegates to perform specialized tasks. Delegates make decisions as they <b>think</b> <b>is</b> best, taking into account technical criteria and consensus. By way of a General Resolution, the developers may recall the leader, reverse a decision made by the leader or a delegate, amend foundational documents and make other binding decisions. The voting method is based on the Schulze method (Cloneproof Schwartz Sequential Dropping).|$|E

5|$|Youth {{spend too}} much time {{learning}} what their teachers <b>think</b> <b>is</b> important, irrelevant from what the youth may already know. The manager of learning value allows the youth to learn and practice his skills in situations simulating real life. The Manager of Learning methodology first exposes the learner to a situation to help both the learner and the leader assess his current state of knowledge. This causes the learner to internalize a need to improve his knowledge or skills. This is followed by a period of teaching or exposure during which the participant improves from their base-line knowledge. The participant then gets a chance to apply what he has learned, and lastly, evaluates his performance improvement.|$|E

25|$|A third {{interpretation}} {{relies on}} the theory that an individual form is capable of having properties of its own. According to this interpretation, the soul is a property of the body, but the ability to <b>think</b> <b>is</b> a property of the soul itself, not of the body. If that is the case, then the soul is the body's form and yet thinking need not involve any bodily organ.|$|E

This is similar to Art Language, in that PC is trying to connect with artsy people like Mac.|$|R
25|$|Beginning in November 2014, Maltin {{has hosted}} the podcast Maltin on Movies on Paul Scheer's Wolfpop network; with comedian and actor Baron Vaughn.

This, I <b>think,</b> <b>is</b> an error.|$|E

The participants have to comment on and point out on a small camera what they <b>think</b> <b>is</b> best about their partner's body and figure and are prompted to confront their insecurities. Confronting issues and using Woodall and Constantine as confidantes, is aimed to help the couple release insecurities and burdens, and ultimately become more at ease with each other.|$|E

Some <b>think</b> <b>is</b> a state building inspector who fell to his death in the building before it was completed. Now a popular coffee spot, the Roundhouse was controversial when {{it was built in}} 1969. Its design put off many people, and President Robert Johns apparently arranged for its construction without the approval of the CSU Board of Trustees. Sequoia Hall was originally constructed to have an attractive white cement finish, but the funding ran short. Today the building stands with plain concrete.|$|E
25|$|One {{year after}} being dragged to Purgatory, Dean returns to Earth without Castiel, {{carrying}} inside his body {{the soul of}} a vampire named Benny. The two brothers begin a fight against Crowley to find the Demon Tablet and lock the Gates of Hell, thereby trapping all demons in Hell. All the while fighting Metatron, the scribe of God, who they <b>think</b> <b>is</b> on their side but is really trying to become the new God himself. The brothers use Kevin Tran to help them read the tablet and accomplish their goal. Castiel is brought back by an angel named Naomi and takes possession of the Angel Tablet. After realizing that to lock the Gates of Hell Sam must die, Dean ends the trials. Castiel, however, is stripped of his grace by an angel named Metatron who proceeds to have millions of angels locked out of Heaven. The season ends with millions of angels falling from the sky.|$|E
25|$|The game then cuts to {{a cluster}} of villages near Forest Heart. As with the first game, {{the story is told}} through the journal entries of a soldier in The Legion, which is now led by Crüniac, who the {{soldiers}} <b>think</b> <b>is</b> more interested in politics than military matters, and spends its time on what the men perceive as trivial errands. Their latest assignment has them investigate reports of grave robbing, however, they are shocked to find the village of Willow Creek besieged by undead Ghasts. They clear the village, and learn the grave robbing leads to the keep of Baron Kildaer. They head to the keep and see hundreds of Thrall moving towards Tallow. Crüniac sends a runner to warn the villagers, while The Legion attack the keep. Crüniac proves a more skilled military tactician than his men believed, masterminding an attack which results in Kildaer's death. Soon thereafter, the runner returns with news that every village in the vicinity has been destroyed, and an undead army is amassing nearby. Crüniac sets fire to the Keep, and The Legion flee into the Clouspine Mountains.|$|E
