40|$|SummaryObjectiveIn {{patients}} with trapeziometacarpal arthrosis, {{we tested the}} hypothesis {{that there is no}} difference in arm-specific disability 5 – 15 weeks after prescription of a pre-fabricated neoprene or a custom-made <b>thermoplast</b> hand-based thumb spica splint with the metacarpophalangeal joint included and the first interphalangeal joint free. MethodOne hundred nineteen {{patients with}} a diagnosis of trapeziometacarpal arthrosis were prospectively randomized to wear either a neoprene or a <b>thermoplast</b> hand-based thumb spica splint. At enrollment, patients completed a set of validated questionnaires. An average of 9 weeks later, patients returned for a second visit. Bivariable analyses assessed factors associated with disability, pain and satisfaction. Analysis was by intention-to-treat. ResultsSixty-two patients (32 with a neoprene and 30 with a <b>thermoplast</b> splint) completed the study, 51 patients (43 %) did not return for the second visit, and six did not complete the protocol for other reasons.

This paper presents {{the findings of a}} cooperate project with an adhesive manufacturer and an electronics company on the synthesis and application of electrically conductive adhesives. The adhesives comprised a polymer filled with approx. 80 wt. % metal flakes. The polymers were epoxies, silicones, <b>thermoplasts</b> or blends. As for the flakes Ag, Cu, Pd were utilized. Epoxies, possibly blended with <b>thermoplasts,</b> in conjunction with Ag-flakes {{turned out to be a}} good compromise between technical performance and economics.

The morphology of the flakes was investiga ted, a mixture of pellets and spheres yielded a low enough viscosity and a good conductivity. Cu-Flakes were covered with oxide. A lasting removal of the oxide could not be achieved which resulted in a poor conductivity. Electronic components were adhesively joined to boards. Soft solder (SnPb) coatings did not cause problems.

40|$|A joint {{research}} project was directed towards {{the investigation into}} the feasibility of substituting currently used thermosetting resins for the encapsulation of electronic components by mouldable thermoplasts. Materials based on liquid crystalline polymers (LCP) appeared to be favourable in view of their excellent flow characteristics, inherent inflammability and mouldability. Initially tested materials derived from BASF developmental LCP exhibited sufficient thermal conductivity and low ion content levels. The additional requirements of stability towards hydrolysis and soldering as well as good welding line strength, however, were met only by blends of LCP with poly(aryletherketone) s (PAEK). Adherence of these materials to lead frame metal surfaces was investigated by a team of the Fraunhofer Institute of Applied Materials Research (FhG-IFAM). A minimised temperature difference between <b>thermoplast</b> melt and mould was recognised to be decisive for good adherence. The structural stability was significantly enhanced by introducing a polyimide layer between <b>thermoplast</b> and lead frame. The developmental materials were evaluated by SIEMENS for direct and indirect (premoulded packaging) sheathing. With direct sheathing using the LCP/PAEK blends ''wire sweeps'' were unavoidable.

40|$|The {{reported}} {{project was}} aimed at thermoplastically processible polymers containing inorganic fibre structures of few nanometers size as reinforcing elements to be generated by chemical reaction. Analogously produced ferroelectric inorganic structures in nanometer size were to lead to materials with high dielectric values or broad band absorption of electromagnetic radiation. The materials were to combine thermoplastic processibility with the properties of functional ceramics. From barium hydroxide and tetraalkyl orthotitanate derived barium titanate (5 to 50 nm) as nonagglomerated dispersion was mixed with <b>thermoplast</b> melts without re-agglomeration. Depending on the temperature, a hyperproportional increase of the dielectric number occurred in polar polymers. Thermal decomposition of iron pentacarbonyl in polymer solution followed by solvent removal resulted in <b>thermoplast</b> containing iron particles (5 - 60 nm). Both mixtures are thermoplastically processible. Thermoplasts with increased tenacity and toughness at high modulus were obtained via separate controlled preparation of the reinforcement phases, subsequent dispersion and mixing with the <b>thermoplast</b> melt. From aluminium alkoxides very fine Boehmit (AlOOH) platelets of 10 - 100 nm length were produced and as equally unagglomerated material introduced into thermoplasts. Needle-shaped iron oxides result in composites of higher stiffness, based on volume, than glass fibres. Tenacity and toughness rise, too. Submicrometer-sized Boehmit leads to clearly higher stiffness increase than expected according to Halpin-Tsai, but {{at the expense of}} decreasing toughness. (orig.) Ziel des dokumentierten Projekts waren thermoplastisch verarbeitbare Polymere, die durch chemische Umsetzungen erzeugte anorganische Faserstrukturen mit Durchmessern von wenigen Nanometern als Verstaerkungselemente enthalten. Analog erzeugte ferroelektrische anorganische Strukturen in Nanometergroesse sollten zu Materialien mit hoher Dielektrizitaetszahl oder breitbandiger Absorption elektromagnetischer Strahlung fuehren. Weiteres Ziel war die Kombination thermoplastischer Verarbeitbarkeit mit den Eigenschaften funktionskeramischer Materialien. Aus Bariumhydroxid und Tetraalkylorthotitanat hergestelltes Bariumtitanat (5 bis 50 nm) wurde als nichtagglomerierte Dispersion mit Thermoplastschmelzen ohne Reagglomeration gemischt. In Abhaengigkeit von der Temperatur ergab sich in polaren Polymeren ein ueberproportionaler Anstieg der Dielektrizitaetszahl. Thermische Zersetzung von Eisenpentacarbonyl in Polymerloesungen und anschliessende Loesungsmittelentfernung lieferte Thermoplaste mit Eisenteilchen (5 bis 60 nm).

40|$|In this contribution, the {{suitability}} of laser welding of plastics for different wavelengths is investigated {{by means of a}} thermographic method. The thermographic method is based on time resolved and space resolved measurement of the thermal radiation which is emitted from the upward-face and downward-face of a plastic material after irradiation with a short laser pulse of a suitable wavelength. Unmodified and modified plastic materials (PA 6, PMMA, ABS, PBT) are selected with respect to the thermographic method as a function of specimen thickness, glass fibre-reinforcement, pigmentation and content of soot. Material-related differences between optical and thermophysical data in dependence of the wavelength can be detected. Investigations of practical welding are performed at thermographically investigated samples. The attainable welding quality is correlated with the thermographic measure. The supply of the data according to the {{suitability of}} laser welding requires a model-like description of the thermal input into the plastics. In order to determine phenomenologically a relation between specimen thicknesses and extrudate swell, the jet diameter is investigated in scattering experiments at samples with different thicknesses. Semi-crystalline <b>thermoplasts</b> lead to a strong information of the laser beam which influences the welding process considerably. Only PMMA and PBT show traceable results. By means of the thermographic measuring method, plastics processors may be able to select suitable types of plastics processors and/or pigments. The selection of a suitable laser system can be facilitated. It is an investigation method with which the general suitability of laser welding can be determined.

Moreover, the technology is an inexpensive alternative to the deposition of interference coatings to increase the light transmission of polymeric optical elements. The principle of antireflective subwavelength structures is also known from the "moth's eye". This work {{is driven by the}} need to fabricate such broadband antireflective morphologies on arbitrary shaped surfaces of different kinds of polymers. Beside PMMA, three transparent <b>thermoplasts</b> were chosen to analyze the physical processes {{in order to understand the}} structure formation. The plasma-polymer interaction was supported by Monte Carlo method to investigate the energy transfer of the ions on the substrate. The optical effect of the structured surfaces has been optimized by the use of spectrophotometry. The structure formation has been analyzed by AFM and SEM. The revealed effective pin shape was correlated with the results from spectral reverse engineering. The structure formation has been established on the surface of the polymers and shows a self-organized nature, since the topography was not prescribed from outside before or during the process. The differences in size, shape, and antireflective effect are specific for the particular polymer. The structure formation results from a combination of physical sputter-erosion and chemical etching. Aspect ratios of the pin structure above 1 can only be explained by anisotropic etching due to impact of high energetic plasma-ions. The structure has been modeled as effective medium, which allows for the subsequent description by means of graded-index layers.

The thermoplastic phase constrains disbonds by posing a physical barrier through a discrete change of materials. Thus, a significant increase against crack propagation is observed for DCB tests.

40|$|The present thesis {{deals with}} the {{preparation}} of well-defined polymer structures based on styrene by means of atom transfer radical polymerisation (ATRP). The focus {{is placed on the}} synthesis of novel block copolymers, synthesis and coupling of telechelic polymers {{as well as on the}} preparation of soluble styrene copolymers that can be cross-linked thermally and photochemically. Two new classes of block copolymers containing polystyrene segments were developed: block copolymers with polystyrene and polycarbonate segments (PS/PC) and block copolymers with PS and poly(phenylene oxide) segments (PS/PPO). For this purpose, hydroxy telechelic PC or PPO were converted into ATRP macroinitiators. These macroinitiators were used for the ATRP of styrene. Atom transfer radical coupling (ATRC) was investigated as a coupling method. ATRC was not only used for chain extension of PS, but was employed for the first time to the coupling of diblock and triblock copolymers to form multiblock copolymers. Whereas chain degradation of block copolymers containing PC segments was observed, PPO/PS block copolymers were converted successfully into multiblock copolymers under ATRC conditions. Two concepts were used for the synthesis of mono- and bifunctional telechelic PSs with unsaturated end groups: the combination of ATRP with an addition-fragmentation-chain-transfer reagent (AFCT) and the chain analogous reaction of PS prepared by ATRP with methacrylic acid. In general, the main disadvantage of the reaction of telechelic polymers is the low concentration of end groups in the reaction mixture. To improve the suitability for cross-linking, polymers carrying reactive double bonds in their side groups as cross-linkable materials should therefore be an alternative. It was shown that AMA can be homopolymerised to soluble polymers via ATRP under suitable conditions. Copolymerisation of AMA and styrene yields soluble copolymers which were cross-linked both thermally and photochemically and therefore offer a potential for applications such as coating and lithography. Thin films of these copolymers on silicon and titanium/nickel alloy surfaces were microstructured by application of photolithography. Using ATRP of AMA and the aforementioned bifunctional macroinitiators based on PC and PPO, these high performance <b>thermoplasts</b> were analogously transformed into cross-linkable triblock copolymers...|$|R

It was shown that genetically modified E. coli cells can synthesise p-aminophenylalanine from endogenously available chorismate by using 4 -amino- 4 -deoxychorismate synthase from Corynebacterium glutamicum and Streptomyces venezuelae 4 -amino- 4 -deoxychorismate mutase and 4 -amino- 4 -deoxyprephenate dehydrogenase. The uncommon, non-proteinogenic amino acid can undergo reactions of phenylpropanoid and lignin biosynthesis alike the natural substrate tyrosine. The deamination by Rhodobacter sphaeroides tyrosine ammonia-lyase or Zea mays phenylalanine ammonia-lyase to p-aminocinnamic acid is followed by the coenzyme A mediated activation by 4 -coumarate:CoA ligase (Petroselinum crispum). p-Aminocinnamyl-CoA is a substrate for Zea mays cinnamyl-CoA reductase and the resulting aldehyde is converted by Zea mays cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase to the target product. Subsequently it is exported into the culture medium. Additionally, a short cut was identified that – simply by the activity of CoA ligase and reductase – efficiently converts the acid into the alcohol. All seven transgenes were functionally expressed in E. coli. It is the simultaneous abundance of all proteins that allows for the biosynthesis of p-aminocinnamyl alcohol without feeding any direct precursors. This demonstrates that complex artificial syntheses can be established by the way of biotechnological methods.

40|$|International audienceThe {{presented}} work {{focuses on}} a methodology to characterise strain rate dependent strength and elastic properties of textile reinforced composites in laminate through-thickness direction. Here, for the characterisation L-shaped beam specimens are used. The investigated composite is a fabric reinforced <b>thermoplast</b> made of hybrid E-glass/polypropylene yarns. The analytical solution for {{the determination of the}} through-thickness tensile strength as proposed by and is verified by means of an optical deformation analysis and is extended for thew determination of the through-thickness elastic modulus. Finally, the possibility of the strain rate dependent characterisation is investigated and a based modelling approach is used to represent the apparent strain rate dependency of the through-thickness failure onset. The methodology is successfully used to capture the material strain rate effects with the according strength values and model parameters over a strain rate range of 10 s to 10 s as well as the elastic modulus...|$|E
40|$|Researchers have {{successfully}} developed the DYNAMIC system that comprises of a sensor, {{a software program}} with algorithms, which interpret the sensors, and a process control hardware/interface for improving composite processing. Any thermoset or reactive <b>thermoplast</b> processing that involves mold filing, polymerization, and crystallization steps can use DYNAMIC sensors. The DYNAMIC sensor {{is the latest in}} capacitive inter digital sensors developed as part of UK government and European funded projects. The project has advanced INASCO's process monitoring system which carefully selects robust industrial hardware modules for monitoring the electrical properties during the process. The DYNAMIC sensor can detect melting of oligomers, and the arrival of liquid pre-polymer flow fronts. The developed system is capable of examining up to four dielectric sensors and fourteen thermocouples. This system can be used for quality control as it generates alarm signal to process supervisors when processes material fall outside the desired properties...|$|E
40|$|Abstract-The {{influence}} of secondary interactions {{on the development}} of interfacial structure in composi tes of wood and amorphous <b>thermoplast</b> ic polymers is not well understood. This s tudy used inverse gas chromatography to investigate the effect of different polymers on the surfirce energy of partially or fully coated white pine wood meal. In this way, the development of the interphase was monitored as a function of polymer depth on the wood surface. The polymers were selected to provide a range of functional groups and included polystyrene, poly(methyl methacrylate), poly(vinyl chloride), polymethacrylic acid, and polymethacrylonitrile. The overall variation of the dispersive component of the surface energy and the ratio of acceptor to donor coefficients appeared to group themselves into two categories based upon the polarity of the polymer’s functional groups. In addition, the high loadings required for stabilization of the less polar polymers suggested that a relatively large volume of the matrix phase is affected by the wood filler...|$|E
40|$|Fe/SiO 2 powder {{composite}} materials based on irregularly and/or spherically shaped iron powder particles with an addition of SiO 2 nanopowder were prepared in two ways, (i) by mixing the Fe/SiO 2 powder with 1. 0 wt. % of Shellac dissolved in ethanol and (ii) by vacuum/pressure impregnation of low-temperature sintered Fe/SiO 2 components with shellac dissolved in ethanol and with <b>thermoplast</b> SL 450. SiO 2 was implemented either as nanopowder or by sol-gel coating. Vacuum/pressure impregnation (VPI) of pre-sintered samples {{was performed in}} a steel container. The influence of iron particle shape and processing conditions on the electro-insulating layer was microscopically evaluated and correlated with {{the values of the}} electrical resistivity and coercivity. It has been found that the continuity, distribution and thickness of insulating phase is strongly controlled by the shape of iron particles. Using the VPI procedure, the irregular surface of iron particles may cause discontinuities of insulating layer, while the spherical iron particles are well covered with continuous evenly distributed insulating layer...|$|E
30|$|Corrosion {{control of}} metals is an {{important}} activity of technical, economical, environmental, and aesthetical importance. The use of inhibitors {{is one of the}} best options of protecting metals and alloys against corrosion. The toxicity of organic and inorganic corrosion inhibitors to the environment has prompted the search for safer corrosion inhibitors such as green corrosion inhibitors as other more environmental friendly corrosion inhibitors, most of which are biodegradable and do not contain heavy metals or other toxic compounds. Investigations of corrosion-inhibiting abilities of polymeric substances, e.g., plant gums, in addition to being environmentally friendly and ecologically acceptable, have shown that plant products are inexpensive, readily available, and renewable sources of materials. Need for more effective inhibitors has propelled companies such as the Montazhkhimzashchita Trust to develop a pool method of welding sheet vinyl, a method widely employed in gluing on roller sticky bands from <b>thermoplast</b> on a pipe. The article enumerates several kinds of polymeric materials which are suitable for use in combating corrosion, and several which have suitable strength characteristics as to serve in place of scarce expensive metals and alloys.|$|E
40|$|A thermal heat switch {{has been}} {{developed}} intended for cryogenic space applications operating around 100 K. The switch was designed to separate two pulse tube cold heads that cool a common focal plane array. Two cold heads are used for redundancy reasons, while the switch is used to reduce the thermal heat loss of the stand-by cold head, thus limiting the required input power, weight and dimensions of the cooler assembly. After initial evaluation of possible switching technologies, a construction based on the thermal expansion coefficient (CTE) of different materials was chosen. A simple design is proposed based on thermoplasts which {{have one of the}} highest CTE known permitting a relative large gap width in the open state. Furthermore, the switch requires no power neither during normal operation nor for switching. This enhances reliability and allows for a simple mechanical design. After a single switch was successfully built, a second doubleswitch configuration was designed and tested. The long term performance of the chosen <b>thermoplast</b> (ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene) under cryogenic load is also analysed...|$|E
