5|$|On November 30, Louisiana Tech {{was invited}} {{to play in the}} Independence Bowl but asked for more time as they were in {{negotiations}} with <b>the</b> <b>Liberty</b> Bowl and Heart of Dallas Bowl. Louisiana Tech athletic director Bruce Van De Velde and WAC commissioner Jeff Hurd both claimed that on December 1, <b>the</b> <b>Liberty</b> Bowl executive director Steve Ehrhart guaranteed the Bulldogs a bowl invite. After the Independence Bowl's deadline for Louisiana Tech to accept their invitation passed, the Independence Bowl selected the MAC's Ohio (8–4) instead. On December 2, <b>the</b> <b>Liberty</b> Bowl extended their remaining bid to Iowa State (6–6) instead of Louisiana Tech (9–3). <b>The</b> <b>Liberty</b> Bowl did not respond to The Times' request for comment on the situation. Louisiana Tech did not end up playing in any bowl game despite boasting the nation's top scoring offense.|$|E
5|$|On the 150th {{anniversary of}} the Declaration of Independence in 1926 the U.S. Post Office issued a {{commemorative}} stamp depicting <b>the</b> <b>Liberty</b> Bell for the Sesquicentennial Exposition in Philadelphia in 1926, though this stamp actually depicts the replica bell erected {{at the entrance to}} the exposition grounds. <b>The</b> <b>Liberty</b> Bell was chosen for the stamp design theme because the symbol was most representative of the nation's independence. Since then <b>the</b> <b>Liberty</b> Bell has also appeared on several other U.S. postage stamps, including the first forever stamp, issued since 2007.|$|E
5|$|One month later, {{while the}} British warship HMS Romney was in port, {{one of the}} tidesmen changed his story: he now claimed {{that he had been}} {{forcibly}} held on <b>the</b> <b>Liberty</b> while it had been illegally unloaded. On June 10, customs officials seized <b>the</b> <b>Liberty.</b> Bostonians were already angry because the captain of the Romney had been impressing colonists, and not just deserters from the Royal Navy, an arguably illegal activity. A riot broke out when officials began to tow <b>the</b> <b>Liberty</b> out to the Romney, which was also arguably illegal. The confrontation escalated when sailors and marines coming ashore to seize <b>the</b> <b>Liberty</b> were mistaken for a press gang. After the riot, customs officials relocated to the Romney, and then to Castle William (an island fort in the harbor), claiming that they were unsafe in town. Whigs insisted that the customs officials were exaggerating the danger so that London would send troops to Boston.|$|E

5|$|As part of <b>the</b> <b>Liberty</b> Bell Savings Bonds {{drive in}} 1950, 55replicas of <b>the</b> <b>Liberty</b> Bell (one each for the 48states, the District of Columbia, and the territories) were {{ordered by the}} United States Department of the Treasury and were cast in France by the Fonderie Paccard.

Although Wisconsin's bell is now at its state capitol, initially it was sited {{on the grounds of}} the state's Girls Detention Center. Texas' bell is located inside the Academic Building on the campus of Texas A University in College Station. The Texas bell was presented to the university in appreciation of the service of the school's graduates.

5|$|British {{officials}} filed two lawsuits {{stemming from}} <b>the</b> <b>Liberty</b> incident: an in rem {{suit against the}} ship, and an in personam suit against Hancock. Royal officials, as well as Hancock's accuser, stood to gain financially, since, as was the custom, any penalties assessed by the court would be awarded to the governor, the informer, and the Crown, each getting a third. The first suit, filed on June 22, 1768, resulted in the confiscation of <b>the</b> <b>Liberty</b> in August. Customs officials then used the ship to enforce trade regulations until it was burned by angry colonists in Rhode Island the following year.|$|E
