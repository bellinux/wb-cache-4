5|$|Some {{residents}} of Glenwood Springs have argued instead that CDOT should instead build a bypass that avoids downtown completely, {{as it did}} in Basalt. <b>They</b> <b>contend</b> <b>that</b> a replacement bridge would add even more traffic to Grand and make downtown less attractive to those who would like to shop there rather than just pass through on the way to destinations up the valley. The bypass, they claim, is more in keeping with the wishes of residents and would cost less. They have lobbied Glenwood Springs' city council to be more active in pressuring CDOT to reconsider the bypass.|$|E
25|$|Critics of {{behavioral}} economics typically stress the rationality of economic agents. <b>They</b> <b>contend</b> <b>that</b> experimentally observed behavior has limited application to market situations, as learning opportunities and competition ensure {{at least a}} close approximation of rational behavior.|$|E
25|$|Most historians {{question}} whether the 13th-century ancestor, referred to in various places as a 'Moor' and Berber, was black African. In any event, <b>they</b> <b>contend</b> <b>that</b> the connection, nine and 15 generations removed, was too distant to consider Charlotte 'black' in any cultural way, as her other ancestors were all European.|$|E

25|$|Zhao, Cheng, and Xu {{described}} the new {{genus and species}} Chaoyangsaurus youngi. <b>They</b> <b>contended</b> <b>that</b> the presence of such an early, primitive ceratopsian in Asia suggested that this continent was where the ceratopsians first originated.|$|R
25|$|The {{physiological}} {{school of}} thought contends {{that in the case}} of inguinal hernia, the above-mentioned are only an anatomical symptom of the underlying physiological cause. <b>They</b> <b>contend</b> <b>that</b> the risk of hernia is due to a physiological difference between patients who suffer hernia and those who do not, namely the presence of aponeurotic extensions from the transversus abdominis aponeurotic arch.|$|E
25|$|A {{minority}} of historians dispute that {{substantial numbers of}} mixed-blood Aboriginal children were forcibly taken from their families. <b>They</b> <b>contend</b> <b>that</b> some children were removed mainly {{to protect them from}} neglect and abuse. Official government estimates are that between one in ten and one in three indigenous Australian children were forcibly taken from their families and communities between 1910 and 1970, affecting all regions of the country.|$|E
25|$|The CNE {{law passed}} quietly in August 2005, with less {{opposition}} than that {{sparked by the}} CPE since it applies to non-unionized businesses. However, its repeal was a primary goal of demonstrations held on October 4, 2005. After the April 2006 cancellation of the First Employment Contract, unions have increased pressure to cancel this contract; <b>they</b> <b>contend</b> <b>that</b> it creates precarious work for employees, endangering job security.|$|E
50|$|The {{defendants}} {{responded by}} entering a special {{appearance in the}} Delaware court {{for the purpose of}} moving to quash service of process and to vacate the sequestration order, thus contesting Delaware's exercise of jurisdiction over them. <b>They</b> <b>contended</b> <b>that</b> none of them had ever set foot in Delaware or conducted any activities in <b>that</b> state. <b>They</b> <b>contended</b> <b>that</b> the ex parte sequestration procedure did not accord them due process of law as required by the Fourteenth Amendment, as construed by Supreme Court cases defining the requirements of personal jurisdiction, and that exercising quasi in rem jurisdiction over property in the forum state that was unrelated to the subject-matter of the litigation was constitutionally impermissible.|$|R

25|$|In the 19th century, {{the tribe}} {{resisted}} repeated state efforts {{to declare that}} it was no longer an Indian tribe because its members were multiracial in ancestry. <b>They</b> <b>contended</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> absorbed other ethnicities into their tribe and continued to identify culturally as Narragansetts.|$|R
25|$|Daron Acemoğlu and James A. Robinson {{similarly}} criticized Diamond's work {{in their}} book Why Nations Fail. <b>They</b> <b>contend</b> <b>that</b> the theory is outdated and can not effectively explain differences in economic growth after 1500 or the reasons why states that are geographically close can exhibit vast differences in wealth. They instead favored an institutional approach in which a societies success or failure {{is based on the}} underlying strength of its institutions.|$|E
25|$|In 2002 Adam LeBor and Louis Sell {{would write}} that Pavlović was really {{dismissed}} because he opposed Milošević's policies towards Kosovo-Serbs. <b>They</b> <b>contend</b> <b>that,</b> contrary to advice from Stambolić, Milošević had denounced Pavlović as being soft on Albanian radicals. LeBor and Sell assert that Milošević prepared {{the ground for}} his ascent to power by quietly replacing Stambolić's supporters with his own people, thereby forcing Pavlović and Stambolić from power.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, anti-globalization proponents {{argue that}} those in the West who defend sweatshops show double {{standards}} by complaining about sweatshop labor conditions in countries considered enemies or hostile by Western governments, while still gladly consuming their exports but complaining about the quality. <b>They</b> <b>contend</b> <b>that</b> multinational jobs {{should be expected to}} operate according to international labor and environmental laws and minimum wage standards like businesses in the West do.|$|E
50|$|During {{the course}} of the {{investigation}} into the ship’s sinking, representatives of MTL theorized that the ship ran aground during her maneuvering to help the Theodora, fatally damaging the hull. <b>They</b> <b>contended</b> <b>that</b> it was this grounding that caused the Marine Electric to sink five hours later.|$|R
5000|$|Allmusic gave a {{positive}} retrospective {{review of the}} album. <b>They</b> <b>contended</b> <b>that</b> Beans and Fatback lacks the deep emotional resonance of Link Wray, but [...] "goes a lot father toward fusing the rowdy howl of Wray's early instrumental hits with the back-to-the-land flavor of his more personal 1971 set." ...|$|R

25|$|Several {{scholars}} {{argue that}} Thomas is dependent on Syriac writings, including unique versions of the canonical gospels. <b>They</b> <b>contend</b> <b>that</b> many sayings of the Gospel of Thomas are more similar to Syriac translations of the canonical gospels than their record in the original Greek. Craig A. Evans states that saying 54 in Thomas, which speaks {{of the poor and}} the kingdom of heaven, is more similar to the Syriac version of Matthew 5:3 than the Greek version of that passage or the parallel in Luke 6:20.|$|E
25|$|Similarly, {{psychiatrist}} David Spiegel {{said that}} the inclusion of Landis' 1956 study was unjustified. He argued that, while weighting larger studies more than smaller makes sense, combining {{the results of a}} large study examining very mild trauma (such as fending off an attacker) with studies of long-term physical and sexual abuse was inappropriate and led to erroneous conclusions. Rind et al. replied that Spiegel misrepresented their analysis, since they did not use Landis' study in the meta-analysis of childhood sexual abuse – symptom correlations, but only for examining the self-reported effects of CSA. <b>They</b> <b>contend</b> <b>that</b> the way they handled Landis' data maximized negative reports and minimized the possible deflating effect of Landis' data on the overall effect sizes.|$|E
25|$|David R. Hekman {{and colleagues}} {{found that men}} receive {{significantly}} higher customer satisfaction scores than equally well-performing women. Customers who viewed videos featuring a female and a male actor {{playing the role of}} an employee helping a customer were 19% more satisfied with the male employee's performance and also were more satisfied with the store's cleanliness and appearance although the actors performed identically, read the same script, and were in exactly the same location with identical camera angles and lighting. In a second study, they found that male doctors were rated as more approachable and competent than equally well performing female doctors. They interpret their findings to suggest that customer ratings tend to be inconsistent with objective indicators of performance and should not be uncritically used to determine pay and promotion opportunities. <b>They</b> <b>contend</b> <b>that</b> customer biases have potential adverse effects on female employees' careers.|$|E
50|$|Justice Brennan dissented, {{joined by}} Justice Marshall, <b>contending</b> <b>that</b> the Fourth Amendment was indeed {{intended}} by the framers {{to apply to}} any action undertaken by the federal government. <b>They</b> <b>contended</b> <b>that</b> the Constitution grants the government limited powers, {{and the application of}} rights is one such limitation. Therefore, no agent of the federal government could ever conduct a search that was not governed by the Fourth Amendment.|$|R
25|$|These events {{paved the}} way for the Adventists who formed the Seventh-Day Adventist Church. <b>They</b> <b>contended</b> <b>that</b> what had {{happened}} on October 22 was not Jesus' return, as Miller had thought, but the start of Jesus' final work of atonement, the cleansing in the heavenly sanctuary, leading up to the Second Coming.|$|R
50|$|An Associated Press article {{reported}} that three waiters — Gorge Ellis, Henry Mallick (1909-2003), and Mario Bastiani (né Salvadore Mario Bastiani; 1917-1988) — triggered the proceedings by petitioning the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Illinois {{to declare the}} club bankrupt. <b>They</b> <b>contended</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were owed wages of $1,847.|$|R
25|$|Some people reject all {{claims that}} Cornwall is, or ought to be, {{distinct}} from England. While recognising {{that there are}} local peculiarisms, {{they point out that}} Yorkshire, Kent, and Cheshire (for example) also have local customs and identities that do not seem to undermine their essential Englishness. The legal claims concerning the Duchy, they argue, are without merit except as relics of mediaeval feudalism, and <b>they</b> <b>contend</b> <b>that</b> Stannary law applied not to Cornwall as a 'nation', but merely to the guild of tin miners. Rather, they argue that Cornwall has been not only in English possession, but part of England itself, either since Athelstan conquered it in 936, since the administrative centralisation of the Tudor dynasty, or since the creation of Cornwall County Council in 1888. Finally, they agree with representatives of the Duchy itself that the Duchy is, in essence, a real estate company that serves to raise income for the Prince of Wales. They compare the situation of the Duchy of Cornwall with that of the Duchy of Lancaster, which has similar rights in Lancashire, which is indisputably part of England. The proponents of such perspectives include not only Unionists, but most branches and agencies of government.|$|E
500|$|Smelser and Davies {{argue that}} the revisionist-inspired {{messages}} and visuals {{found their way into}} wargames, Internet chatrooms and forums and the popular culture of Waffen-SS [...] "romancers", that is those who romanticise the German war effort. <b>They</b> <b>contend</b> <b>that</b> the Achtung Panzer and Feldgrau websites are especially attractive to this group.|$|E
500|$|According to {{historian}} Ayesha Jalal, {{while there}} is a tendency towards hagiography in the Pakistani view of Jinnah, in India he is viewed negatively. [...] Ahmed deems Jinnah [...] "the most maligned person in recent Indian history... In India, many see him as the demon who divided the land." [...] Even many Indian Muslims see Jinnah negatively, blaming him for their woes as a minority in that state. Some historians such as Jalal and H. M. Seervai assert that Jinnah never wanted the partition of India—it was the outcome of the Congress leaders being unwilling to share power with the Muslim League. <b>They</b> <b>contend</b> <b>that</b> Jinnah only used the Pakistan demand in an attempt to mobilise support to obtain significant political rights for Muslims.|$|E

25|$|In August 2005, O'Neal {{signed a}} 5-year-extension with the Heat for $100million. Supporters applauded O'Neal's {{willingness}} to take {{what amounted to a}} pay cut and the Heat's decision to secure O'Neal's services for the long term. <b>They</b> <b>contended</b> <b>that</b> O'Neal was worth more than $20million per year, particularly given that lesser players earned almost the same amount.|$|R
30|$|Regarding {{tension between}} the two religions, the {{respondents}} argued that there was tension before 1975, particularly in 1963.43 After 1975, <b>they</b> <b>contended</b> <b>that</b> there was sometimes tension. They agreed that the causes of tension included conversion, politics and the difference of point of views. They expressed their worries about conversion because it impacted the Buddhist community.|$|R
500|$|Along with {{choosing}} {{members for}} the National Assembly, Belarusian voters {{were presented with}} a referendum regarding presidential term limits. Before the vote, President Alexander Lukashenko was only allowed to serve two terms before the Constitution required him to step down. The voter turnout for the referendum was nearly 90%, with 77.3% of the voters agreeing to eliminating term limits. The changes were implemented on October 17, 2004. Like the 1996 referendum, {{the validity of the}} vote was brought into question. According to the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), many polling places went without independent observers. The OSCE believed that the standards of the vote did not meet OSCE requirements for [...] "free and fair elections". Data from other non-governmental organizations (NGO) point out that 50% of voters did not participate in the referendum, so <b>they</b> <b>contend</b> <b>that</b> the results reported by the government are flawed. Two years later, Lukashenko ran in the 2006 election and won 83% of the vote during the first ballot. With no term limits, Lukashenko states that, depending on his health, he will not retire from politics and might run for re-election in 2011.|$|E
500|$|The presumed {{soft tissue}} was called into {{question}} by Thomas Kaye of the University of Washington and his co-authors in 2008. <b>They</b> <b>contend</b> <b>that</b> what was really inside the tyrannosaur bone was slimy biofilm created by bacteria that coated the voids once occupied by blood vessels and cells. The researchers found that what previously had been identified as remnants of blood cells, {{because of the presence}} of iron, were actually framboids, microscopic mineral spheres bearing iron. They found similar spheres in a variety of other fossils from various periods, including an ammonite. In the ammonite they found the spheres in a place where the iron they contain could not have had any relationship to the presence of blood. Schweitzer has strongly criticized Kaye's claims and argues that there is no reported evidence that biofilms can produce branching, hollow tubes like those noted in her study. San Antonio, Schweitzer and colleagues published an analysis in 2011 of what parts of the collagen had been recovered, finding that it was the inner parts of the collagen coil that had been preserved, as would have been expected from a long period of protein degradation. Other research challenges the identification of soft tissue as biofilm and confirms finding [...] "branching, vessel-like structures" [...] from within fossilized bone.|$|E
2500|$|Abiogenic {{hypotheses}} generally {{reject the}} supposition that certain molecules found within petroleum, known as biomarkers, {{are indicative of}} the biological origin of petroleum. [...] <b>They</b> <b>contend</b> <b>that</b> these molecules mostly come from microbes feeding on petroleum in its upward migration through the crust, {{that some of them}} are found in meteorites, which have presumably never contacted living material, and that some can be generated abiogenically by plausible reactions in petroleum.|$|E
50|$|On February 20, 2013, Way of Life Broadcasting has {{requested}} the revocation of its broadcasting licence for CJIV-FM, as of September 1, 2013, as <b>they</b> <b>contended</b> <b>that</b> {{it does not}} have the listenership to justify operating the station. Consequently, it will cease broadcasting by no later than August 31, 2013, the expiry date for the licence.|$|R
25|$|Notre Dame {{supporters}} {{argued that}} the post-season AP poll was final {{and should not be}} revisited. <b>They</b> <b>contended</b> <b>that</b> Michigan had run up the score on USC, noted that Notre Dame had not had an opportunity to play in a bowl game, and asserted that Michigan and other Big Nine schools were unwilling to schedule Notre Dame in the regular season.|$|R
50|$|The Borden camp, on {{the other}} hand, charged that the Liberals were insufficiently loyal to the empire. <b>They</b> <b>contended</b> <b>that</b> the {{proposal}} {{was not enough to}} secure Canada's coasts or help Britain in its current arms race crisis against Germany, and that the only viable option was to vote money for the construction of battleships to expand the navy in Britain.|$|R
