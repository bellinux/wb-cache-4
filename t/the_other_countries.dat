5|$|A Lebanese {{passport}} does not, in itself, entitle {{the holder}} to enter another country. To enter another country, the traveler {{must comply with}} the visa and entry requirements of <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>countries</b> to be visited, which vary {{from country to country}} and may apply specifically to a particular passport type, the traveller's nationality, criminal history, health issues, evidence of sufficient funds, evidence of ticket for exit or many other factors.|$|E
5|$|One {{point of}} {{criticism}} {{is that the}} film gives a misleading impression of the whereabouts and magnitude of Kony's remaining LRA forces. As of early 2012, Kony's followers were thought to number only in the hundreds, and Kony himself {{was believed to be}} in the Central African Republic rather than Uganda—a fact that receives only a passing mention in the video. This problem raised questions about the plausibility of Ugandan army intervention, which the video advocates. Since Kony and most of the LRA forces are currently not in Uganda, the Ugandan army would need to coordinate with the governments and militaries of <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>countries</b> where the LRA is active.|$|E

5|$|Among {{the social}} {{programs}} involved during the event were {{the opening ceremonies}} at the Tipsport arena. Included were musical performances from the English rock band Deep Purple, who performed at the opening ceremony 18 February, and the Slovak band Elán, who performed on 20 February. Concerts {{took place on the}} Liberec main square where medal award ceremonies occurred. In addition, there were special themed days, including Italian Day, Czech Day, Norwegian Day and Slovak Day. One recurring theme of this was free beer for people from these countries in some pubs at happy hour. The most famous fans at the championships were the Norwegians, who were very numerous compared with <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>countries.</b>|$|E
5|$|Cross-lingual {{studies were}} {{performed}} at 13 European universities, using 12 different languages, viz. Dutch, English, Finnish, French, German, Greek (the {{only one with}} a non-Roman alphabet), Hungarian, Italian, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, and Spanish. Because the original yoked design did not lend itself well to long-distance research and standardization, it {{was replaced by a}} simpler, easier to replicate experimental design. Subjects were asked to mark the six capital letters they liked most in a randomized list containing all letters of the local alphabet, again without giving it much thought. They had to mark their first preference with 1, their second with 2, etc. The new method was first applied in Belgium. When results showed the name-letter effect at work again, it was copied in <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>countries.</b> A total of 2,047 subjects participated, all students.|$|E
5|$|The German government, for {{political}} reasons, preferred the An-70-based solution. During a separate German Ministry of Defence {{evaluation of the}} An-7X, the aircraft was apparently considered to be superior to the A400M designed by the military branch of Airbus. According to AirTruck, the Defence Ministry estimated the An-7X to be 30 percent cheaper than its rival, would provide industrial benefits as Germany would receive substantial workshare, and was deemed to be technically superior, due mainly to its new propfan technology; however, a Defence Ministry spokesperson denied that a conclusion had been reached. On the other hand, DASA preferred the A400M, and refused to be the prime contractor for the An-70 if {{it was to be}} chosen. In the meantime, Belgium, France, Italy, Portugal, Spain, Turkey and the UK, were tentative members of the FLA programme and were estimated to have a requirement for up to 288 aircraft; Russia and Ukraine themselves were looking to acquire 210 An-70s. Other contenders for the FLA were the C-17 and C-130J. In April 2000, the German government, the strongest supporter of the An-70, stated that it was committed to buying the same aircraft as <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>countries.</b> In the end, the A400M was chosen for the FLA project; had the An-70 been chosen, fifty percent of the aircraft would have been manufactured by Airbus.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} study government’s {{regulation}} of fisheries (or other natural resources) {{in the presence}} of the following two characteristics: 1) The fishery is shared between different countries, so there is at least one <b>other</b> <b>country</b> also regulating <b>the</b> fishery. 2) There is some level of political risk regarding future decisions in both/all countries, which is recognized both by fishermen and governments. The main question we study is how this political risk should affect the government’s policy. We focus on two aspects of government policy; enforcement levels and political uncertainty in own country. Our main result is that uncertainty about enforcement levels in <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>country</b> affects <b>the</b> optimal behaviour for the government in our country. If the optimal enforcement level in our country is a concave function of the enforcement level in <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>country,</b> uncertainty about <b>the</b> policy in <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>country</b> should reduce <b>the</b> optimal enforcement level in our country, which also implies that it is optimal for our country to remove more uncertainty about our policy than it would otherwise be. Conversely, if the optimal enforcement level in our country is a convex function of the enforcement level in <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>country,</b> uncertainty about enforcement in <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>country</b> should increase <b>the</b> enforcement level in our country, and it would be optimal to maintain a higher level of uncertainty about our own policy than otherwise...|$|R

5000|$|According to the Brazilian constitution, in principle, Brazilian {{citizens}} who voluntarily acquire another nationality by naturalization lose Brazilian nationality. However, since 1994 {{a constitutional amendment}} allows two exceptions where Brazilians may maintain Brazilian nationality while acquiring another one. The first exception is {{in the case of}} recognition of [...] "originary nationality" [...] by foreign law. Contrary to a popular misconception, this term does not refer to recognition of original Brazilian nationality by <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>country,</b> but to cases where the acquisition of <b>the</b> <b>other</b> nationality is done by jus sanguinis (by descent or family origin). Whether <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>country</b> recognizes dual nationality is irrelevant. The second exception is in case <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>country</b> requires naturalization for the person to remain residing or to exercise civil rights there.|$|R

However, Section 1 further authorizes each of the countries to restrict such rights and privileges to the same extent that <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>country</b> restricts such rights and privileges with regards to mining on public lands. Section 2 provides that nationals and corporations and associations {{of one of the}} countries within the territories of <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>country</b> are to be permitted to organize and participate in corporations and associations of the host country for a broad set of enumerated activities as permitted by applicable laws and regulations of the host country, but there is no requirement that the terms be as favorable as those granted to nationals and corporations and associations of the host country.
