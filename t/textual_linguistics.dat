30|$|Adalı et al. [2] {{correlate}} <b>textual</b> features (<b>linguistics,</b> processes, {{and psychological}} processes) with social and behavioral features (reciprocity, assortativity, attention, and latency). Textual features are derived {{based on the}} content of messages exchanged between users whereas social and behavioral features are computed based on user’s social network (nodes, edges). Both the textual and behavioral features are indicator of trust behavior between users. However, such measures are considered based on their frequency of occurrence and they do not not capture the vulnerability of a truster toward a trustee. For example, textual features indicate number of verbs, pronouns, affective processes (emotions), cognitive processes (causation, certainty), perceptual processes (see, hear, feel), and so on whereas behavioral features indicate number of number of friends, followers, messages sent, degree similarity between users, reciprocity of conversation and propagation messages, in-degree, out-degree and so on. Thus, we emphasize capturing semantic meanings of messages in terms of commitments (i.e., how they are created, satisfied, and violated) from the text content exchanged between users.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{introduce}} a new framework and methodology to analyze science classroom discourse {{and apply it to}} a university physics education course. Two fields of inquiry were adapted to develop the framework: activity theory and linguistics. From activity theory we applied levels of analysis (activity, actions, and operations) to organize and structure the discourse analysis. From the field of linguistics we used resources from sociolinguistics and <b>textual</b> <b>linguistics</b> to perform analysis at the action and operation levels. Sociolinguistics gave us criteria to introduce contextualization cues into analysis in order to consider ways that participants segmented their classroom conversations. <b>Textual</b> <b>linguistics</b> provided a basis for categories of language organization (e. g, argumentation, explanation, narration, description, injunction, and dialogue). From this analysis, we propose an examination of a teacher's discourse moves, which we labeled Discursive Didactic Procedures (DDPs). Thus, the framework provides a means to situate these DDPs in different types of language organization, examine the roles such DDPs play in events, and consider the relevant didactic goals accomplished. We applied this framework to analyze the emergence and development of an argumentative situation and investigate its specific DDPs and their roles. Finally, we explore possible contributions of the framework to science education research and consider some of its limitations...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Today, Linguistic {{researches}} on literature play {{an important}} role in studying each language. Linguistic analysis of literature has interested critics to give a better knowledge of literary texts and their stylistic features via different linguistic approaches. This paper aims at investigating textual cohesion in “Munajat Namih ” by Khajih Abd-Ollah Ansari, the poet and mystic in ninth and tenth century, based on Halliday and Hasan (1985, 1976). Having selected 30 cases of Munajats 1 from Munajat Namih to discover cohesive devices, we have calculated the frequency of their functions and concluded that the most basic cohesive devices in it are personal pronouns. Repetition of the same word is ranked in the second place, and additives are ranked in a third place. Furthermore, collocation and verbal ellipsis are from among important cohesive devices in Munajat Namih. In fact, because of its being a poetic and mystic prose, the cohesive devices had been used in the form mentioned.

40|$|Abstract: Corpus-based {{terminology}} {{is currently}} gaining {{ground on the}} international front. It is therefore important that terminologists working on the South African Bantu languages not only take note of this development, but that they should also follow this trend, {{even if they do}} not have the same measure of access to highly sophisticated software. The aim of this article is therefore to establish whether it is possible to retrieve definitional information on key concepts from untagged, running text by making use of affordable and easily accessible software such as WordSmith Tools. In order to answer this question, a case study is done in Northern Sotho, using <b>textual</b> material on <b>linguistics</b> as basis for a special field corpus. Syntactic and lexical patterns serving as textual mark-ers of definitional information are identified and the success rate of the computational retrieval of definitional information is analysed and evaluated. Attention is also paid to the retrieval of specifi-cally conceptual information, which turned out to be a fortunate by-product of semi-automatic retrieval of definitional information. Finally, it is illustrated how definitional information retrieved can be utilised in the writing of a formal terminological definition...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} domains of sublanguage, machine {{translation}} and textual analysis. Chapter 1 discusses the definitions and characteristics of sublanguage put forward by researchers to date, {{as well as the}} background of <b>textual</b> analysis in <b>linguistics.</b> This discussion reveals that, although there is much to be gained from textual analysis, little consideration has been given to the notion of "text" in the sublanguage approach to machine translation (MT). Before any sublanguage analysis can proceed, compilation of a corpus is necessary. To date, attention has been focussed on the criteria for compiling general language corpora. Chapter 2 addresses the problems of compiling corpora for sublanguage research and offers guidelines for this purpose. An exploration of the advantages of considering text type and communicative function in the sublanguage approach to MT is the focus of Chapter 3. Three text types with a similar communicative function from the same highly restricted sublanguage domain are compared for linguistic features which cause semantic, syntactic and lexical ambiguities. Finally, Chapter 4 summarises and evaluates the results obtained in Chapter 3. Conclusions are drawn about "text type" and communicative function and about the advantages of considering "text" for MT...|$|R
40|$|The {{following}} research paper presents a detailed {{overview of the}} evolution of text linguistics from its birth (circa 1960) to the present day, which will prove that its appearance [...] -along with pragmatics, sociolinguistics and psycholinguistics [...] -fosters a redirection of the linguistic object of study that goes beyond immanent perspectives towards language in use, and that text linguistics is an interdisuplinury approach to the study of language. In {{the first part of this}} paper, "Anteccedentes de la linguistica del texto", we have analyzed the influence of classical rhetoric and poetics, grammatical tradition and stylistics, as well as diverse linguists and schools, such as B. Malinowski, J. R. Firth, the Prague School, L. Hjelmslev, American structural linguistics, tagmemics, E. Coseriu, and Generative Grammar. In the second part, "El desarrollo de la linguistica del texto", we have defined the limits of text linguistics by means of a terminological revision of the terms texto and discurso. Following that, our line of research has focused on the initial nucleus of the discipline, that is, the European Textlinguistik. We believe that there is a transition from existent sentence-based grammars (i. e. TeSWeST, Functional Sentence Perspective and T. A. van Dijk's theory) towards a concept of "text" as the minimal unit of sense in which either social (as in the systemic-functional grammar and additions to T. A. van Dijk's theory) or pragmatic aspects (i. e. S. J. Schmidt's textual theory and the operational model of R. A. de Beaugrande and W. U. Dressler) predominate. Finally, the third part of this dissertation, "Nuevas direcciones y perspectivas en la linguistica del texto", presents theoretical models which try to explain textual phenomena based on current theories, such as the theory of chaos, receptor pragmatics and relevance theory. This is followed by an interdisciplinary approach to linguistic research, in which we analyse the relations between <b>textual</b> discoursive <b>linguistics</b> and language teacher training, documentation and genetics as a means of information transmission. 441 p...|$|R
40|$|Importance marking in lectures {{by native}} and {{non-native}} speakers Importance marking organises lecture discourse by signalling key points (e. g. the point is; remember; that is important). Comparing {{how this is}} achieved by native and non-native speakers of English sheds light on the generalisability of genre findings across users of the same language and can inform lecturer training and lecture comprehension courses. The markers were extracted from the British Academic Spoken English corpus and the Corpus of English as a Lingua Franca in Academic Settings combining corpus-based and corpus-driven methods. They were quantified and classified for their ‘interactive orientation’ to the listeners (e. g. note), speaker (e. g. I want to emphasize) or content (e. g. the important point is) (Deroey, 2013). Identifying important points is arguably a key aspect of effective lecture delivery and comprehension and interactivity is also widely advocated. However, non-native speaker lecturers are reportedly less interactive and structure their discourse less explicitly and effectively. Comparing the interactive orientation, explicitness and frequency of importance marking in these corpora enhances {{our understanding of the}} lecture genre, its generic variation and the factors that may affect lecturing efficacy.

5000|$|Historically, the yat {{reflexes}} {{had been}} inscribed in Church Slavic texts before the significant development of Shtokavian dialect, reflecting {{the beginnings of}} the formative period of the vernacular. In early documents it is predominantly Church Slavic of the Serbian or Croatian recension (variant). The first undoubted Ekavian reflex ( [...] it was) is found in a document from Serbia dated 1289; the first Ikavian reflex ( [...] witnesses) in Bosnia in 1331; and first (I)jekavian reflex ( [...] we wish, a [...] "hyper-Ijekavism") in Croatia in 1399. Partial attestation can be found in earlier texts (for instance, Ikavian pronunciation is found in a few Bosnian documents from {{the latter half of the}} 13th century), but philologists generally accept the aforementioned dates. In the second half of the 20th century, many vernaculars with unsubstituted yat are found. The intrusion of the vernacular into Church Slavic grew in time, to be finally replaced by the vernacular idiom. This process took place for Croats, Serbs and Bosniaks independently and without mutual interference until the mid-19th century. Historical <b>linguistics,</b> <b>textual</b> analysis and dialectology have dispelled myths about allegedly [...] "unspoilt" [...] vernacular speech of rural areas: for instance, it is established that Bosniaks have retained phoneme [...] "h" [...] in numerous words (unlike Serbs and Croats), due to elementary religious education based on the Quran, where this phoneme is the carrier of specific semantic value.|$|R
40|$|To {{assess how}} {{representative}} discourse organisational cues in EAP listening books are, I compared importance marking cues with those I retrieved from the BASE lectures using corpus-based and corpus-driven methods. The corpus investigation revealed a large variety of importance markers, {{the most common}} of which (e. g. the point is; remember; anyway; not talk about) differ from those which usually appear in EAP materials. More specifically, the predominant markers in the corpus were multifunctional and less explicit than their far less frequently used prototypical counterparts (e. g. the important point is; you should note; that’s an aside; that’s irrelevant) (cf. Deroey 2013; Deroey & Taverniers 2012 a; Deroey & Taverniers 2012 b). However, the EAP books I examined vary widely in their inclusion of importance markers and mostly provide fairly prototypical, explicit examples. Most are also not (obviously) based on corpus research. In short, much remains to be done to ensure that corpus evidence informs lecture listening materials so that students are better prepared for the demands of their course lectures. Deroey, K. L. B.

The needs analysis, which was performed by the University Language Centre, encompassed a university-wide online questionnaire (N= 400) and semi-structured interviews with academic course directors (N= 25). Results revealed that most EMI lecturers felt their English is at CEF level C 2 and hence they were not usually looking to improve their English. Nevertheless, quite a few wanted to improve their pronunciation and grammar and were interested in training to help them teach in a language that is not their mother tongue. Similarly, the course directors were more concerned with lecturers improving their English for research writing rather than for lecturing. Finally, I will provide examples of how European universities have tried to support their staff in teaching through the medium of English. With this talk I hope to paint an informative picture of the needs EMI lecturers may have and open up a discussion about issues surrounding the provision of adequate and appropriate support.
