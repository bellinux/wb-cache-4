5|$|When the Bridgwater and Taunton Canal {{was opened}} in 1827, it joined the Parrett by a lock at Huntworth, where a basin was constructed, but in 1841 the canal was {{extended}} to the new floating harbour in Bridgwater, and the Huntworth link was filled in. The canal and river were not re-connected at this point when the canal was restored, because the tidal Parrett, at Huntworth, is a salt water river laden with silt whereas the canal contains fresh water. Not only is there a risk of silt entering the canal, but the salt water cannot be allowed <b>to</b> <b>contaminate</b> the fresh, as the canal is still used for the transport of drinking water for Bridgwater's population.|$|E
5|$|Boating on {{the canal}} is encouraged, {{although}} {{the lack of}} a link to the River Parrett at Bridgwater is restrictive. At this point, the Parrett is a salt water river, and is laden with silt, whereas the canal contains fresh water. Not only is there a risk of silt entering the canal, but the salt water cannot be allowed <b>to</b> <b>contaminate</b> the fresh, as the canal is still used for the transport of drinking water for the population of Bridgwater. The canal forms part of the local flood relief system, in winter taking water from the River Tone at Taunton and discharging it into the Parrett at a sluice in the western fringe of Bridgwater, near the Bridgwater Canalside Centre.|$|E

40|$|Pathological {{abnormalities}} {{and mixed}} function oxygenase (MFO) enzyme changes are frequently used {{as indicators of}} anthropogenic contaminant exposure and effect. However, there is a paucity of research investigating the effects of contaminated sediment on native Australian benthic teleosts. As part of an ecotoxicological assessment of contaminated marine sediments in northern Tasmania, CYP 1 A induction, histological and growth response of the greenback flounder, Rhombosolea tapirina, exposed <b>to</b> <b>contaminated</b> marine sediments were examined. Hatchery reared flounder were exposed <b>to</b> reference sediment, <b>contaminated</b> sediment or contaminated sediment and diet for 6 weeks. CYP 1 A induction, using the ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) assay, and the histological and growth response in the flounder were examined on cessation of the exposure trial. Significant {{differences were found between}} treatments in histological, growth and EROD response. Exposure <b>to</b> <b>contaminated</b> sediment and diet elicited a multi-organ histological response: principally partial and total epidermal erosion and multifocal necrosis of the liver. The prevalence of total epidermal erosion was greatest with exposure <b>to</b> disturbed <b>contaminated</b> sediment (66. 65 ± 16. 65 %). The prevalence of multifocal necrosis of the liver was greatest with exposure to contaminanted sediment and diet (66. 65 ± 16. 65 %). Growth reduction, measured as percentage growth inhibition, was evident in flounder exposed <b>to</b> <b>contaminated</b> sediment and diet (18. 2 ± 11. 99 %). Additionally, exposure <b>to</b> <b>contaminated</b> sediment and diet elicited elevated induction of the EROD liver detoxification enzyme (139. 65 ± 24. 22 pmol/min/mg protein) compared <b>to</b> exposure <b>to</b> <b>contaminated</b> sediment and non-contaminated diet (6. 25 ± 0. 81 pmol/min/mg) indicating the presence and potential bioavailability of xenobiotics via food. Further, more inhibited growth and histological alteration associated with exposure <b>to</b> <b>contaminated</b> sediment and diet suggest contaminants in Deceitful Cove sediment are cytotoxic...|$|R

5|$|Emus {{were used}} {{as a source of}} food by {{indigenous}} Australians and early European settlers. Emus are inquisitive birds and have been known to approach humans if they see unexpected movement of a limb or piece of clothing. In the wild, they may follow and observe people. Aboriginal Australians used a variety of techniques to catch the birds, including spearing them while they drank at waterholes, catching them in nets, and attracting them by imitating their calls or by arousing their curiosity with a ball of feathers and rags dangled from a tree. The pitchuri thornapple (Duboisia hopwoodii), or some similar poisonous plant, could be used <b>to</b> <b>contaminate</b> a waterhole, after which the disoriented emus were easy to catch. Another stratagem was for the hunter to use a skin as a disguise, and the birds could be lured into a camouflaged pit trap using rags or imitation calls. Aboriginal Australians only killed emus out of necessity, and frowned on anyone who hunted them for any other reason. Every part of the carcass had some use; the fat was harvested for its valuable, multiple-use oil, the bones were shaped into knives and tools, the feathers were used for body adornment and the tendons substituted for string.|$|E

Doggett is then suspended by Kersh and Follmer. Reyes tries {{to find out more about}} McMahon's history and learns that she is a Department of Justice employee and had been contacted by Wormus and McFarland in their attempts to expose the plans <b>to</b> <b>contaminate</b> the water supply. The Lone Gunmen intercept a call from the captain to Wormus, who tells him to contact the FBI, Knowle Rohrer is nearby eavesdropping. The captain then pulls a gun on the Navy Seal guarding the entrance to the lab, demanding that Nordlinger surrender the project's data. He does not notice Rohrer creeping up behind him. After hearing Reyes' findings, Scully, Reyes and Doggett go to the ship. They expect to meet the captain, but instead find Rohrer. Just as Rohrer is about to crush Doggett's skull, he is decapitated by McMahon. Rohrer is presumed dead, but soon awakens and stabs McMahon. Both bodies tumble into the water. The three agents board the ship, which is abandoned, and find the captain's decapitated body. Scully gains access to the now empty lab and finds evidence of manipulation of ova. However, she is forced to leave when Doggett finds a time bomb on the bridge. The agents narrowly escape the explosion.|$|E

40|$|Non-specific immune {{response}} of greenback flounder, Rhombosolea tapirina, exposed <b>to</b> <b>contaminated</b> marine sediments was examined.
