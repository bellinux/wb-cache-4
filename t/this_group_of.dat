5|$|A 2008 paper saw {{a return}} to white-eye {{taxonomy}} with the formal description of the Togian white-eye Zosterops somadikartai, an endemic species of the Togian Islands of Indonesia, which, unlike most of its relatives, lacks the white ring around the eye which give <b>this</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> birds its name. Rasmussen noted that the Togian white-eye is distinctive not only in its appearance, but also in its lilting song, which sounds higher pitched and is less varied in frequency than the songs of its close relatives.|$|E
5|$|After a brief stay {{among the}} Mormon {{community}} of southern Utah, Harrison {{enlisted in the}} Canadian Army Medical Corps in 1917 and was stationed at a French hospital, where he tended {{to the needs of}} the Chinese Labour Corps. Quickly learning the language and customs of <b>this</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> some 200,000 men, Harrison successfully treated many bilharzia, catarrh and tuberculosis cases, significantly reducing the number of sick members of the Corps during the winter of 1917–18.|$|E

Though Laidlaw & Solem (1961) provided no more additional details on the anatomy of Amphidromus, subsequent studies by distinct authors, e.g., Bishop (1977) and Solem (1983), have demonstrated that the reproductive system can provide valuable data for species recognition.|$|E
5|$|In 1939, with Babcock's support, Stebbins {{was made}} a full {{professor}} in the Department of Genetics at UC Berkeley, after the Department of Botany failed to promote him. Stebbins was required to teach a course on evolution, and during his preparation he became excited by contemporary research combining genetics and evolution. He became associated with a group known as the Bay Area Biosystematists, which included botanist Jens Clausen, taxonomist David D. Keck, physiologist William Hiesey and the evolutionary geneticist Theodosius Dobzhansky. During this time he also became friends with the botanist Herbert Baker. With the encouragement of <b>this</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> scientists, Stebbins directed his research towards evolution. He became involved with the Society for the Study of Evolution in 1946, {{and was one of}} the few botanists involved with the new organization.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, Prosaurolophus was {{studied with}} other hadrosaurids by Wagner. The genus, along with Corythosaurus and Maiasaura, were {{considered}} by Wagner to be synonymous with Saurolophus, Hypacrosaurus and Brachylophosaurus respectively. Prosaurolophus maximus was reassigned to Saurolophus as S. maximus. The same year however, Prosaurolophus {{was found to}} be distinct from Saurolophus, in an analysis of Hu et al.. Their analysis was unique from any of the time, and they recovered Prosaurolophus in Saurolophinae, with Saurolophus, Lophorhothon, Tsintaosaurus, Jaxartosaurus, and Kritosaurus.

What is to be prevented is the seizure of these heights for the purpose of establishing batteries to destroy the navy-yard and arsenal. For this purpose the works should be self-sustaining, or relying only upon such aid as a small movable body of troops can furnish, and upon succor, which may be thrown over the Branch after an attack is developed.|$|E
5|$|Lilioid monocots (lilioids, liliid monocots, petaloid monocots, petaloid lilioid monocots) is an {{informal}} name {{used for a}} grade (grouping of taxa with common characteristics) of five monocot orders (Petrosaviales, Dioscoreales, Pandanales, Liliales and Asparagales) in which the majority of species have flowers with relatively large, coloured tepals. This characteristic {{is similar to that}} found in lilies ("lily-like"). Petaloid monocots refers to the flowers having tepals which all resemble petals (petaloid). The taxonomic terms Lilianae or Liliiflorae have also been applied to this assemblage at various times. From the early nineteenth century many of the species in <b>this</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> plants were put into a very broadly defined family, Liliaceae sensu lato or s.l. (lily family). These classification systems are still found in many books and other sources. Within the monocots the Liliaceae s.l. were distinguished from the Glumaceae.|$|E

5|$|No {{consensus}} existed {{regarding the}} taxonomy of Psittaciformes until recently. The {{placement of the}} Strigopoidea species has been variable in the past.

5|$|Poliomyelitis {{is caused}} by {{infection}} {{with a member of}} the genus Enterovirus known as poliovirus (PV). <b>This</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> RNA viruses colonize the gastrointestinal tract — specifically the oropharynx and the intestine. The incubation time (to the first signs and symptoms) ranges from three to 35 days, with a more common span of six to 20 days. PV infects and causes disease in humans alone. Its structure is very simple, composed of a single (+) sense RNA genome enclosed in a protein shell called a capsid. In addition to protecting the virus’s genetic material, the capsid proteins enable poliovirus to infect certain types of cells. Three serotypes of poliovirus have been identified—poliovirus type 1 (PV1), type 2 (PV2), and type 3 (PV3)—each with a slightly different capsid protein. All three are extremely virulent and produce the same disease symptoms. PV1 is the most commonly encountered form, and the one most closely associated with paralysis.|$|E
5|$|The black-throated gray warbler {{was first}} {{described}} by John Kirk Townsend from a specimen collected near today's Portland, Oregon.

Townsend described the species as Sylvia nigrescens, placing it with the other New World warblers and the unrelated Old World warblers in the genus Sylvia. It is now placed in the genus Setophaga along with about thirty other species, after having been classified in Dendroica for some time. Within its genus, {{it is part of}} a group with black throats and yellow face markings that includes the hermit warbler and Townsend's warbler. It is usually considered an early offshoot among <b>this</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> species, but genetic studies suggest a close relation to Grace's warbler.|$|E
