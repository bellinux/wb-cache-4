This study therefore undertakes {{a survey of the}} place and role of <b>tour</b> <b>operators</b> in the tourism industry, before investigating the different distribution channels available to <b>tour</b> <b>operators</b> as well as the factors that influence a <b>tour</b> <b>operator’s</b> choice of distribution channels. This is done by means of a literature study and a brief investigative questionnaire submitted to a number of small <b>tour</b> <b>operators.</b> The study concludes that the different situations pertaining to different small <b>tour</b> <b>operators</b> make it impossible to determine a set of distribution channels applicable to every <b>tour</b> <b>operator.</b> However, it identifies a number of considerations that individual <b>tour</b> <b>operators</b> can take into account to support their choice of distribution channels, taking cognisance of their unique situations. These include factors like the target market selected, positioning and the establishment of a trade mark, quality of service, specialisation, the nature of the destination and the background of the tourists, control over the marketing process, {{information and communication}}, cost-efficiency, and pragmatic considerations.

40|$|Purpose: To {{examine how}} a <b>tour</b> <b>operator</b> works to {{implement}} sustainability {{in the development}} of the business, as well as what significance it has to consumers in selecting a <b>tour</b> <b>operator.</b> Furthermore, the purpose is to provide recommendations on how <b>tour</b> <b>operators</b> should work to communicate their commitments. Methodology: The research strategy applied is a case study which follows an abductive approach. Qualitative and quantitative methods were applied to complement each other. A semi-structured interview with a <b>tour</b> <b>operator</b> and a consumer survey constitute the empirical foundation. Conclusion: The conclusion of the study is that consumers show a positive attitude towards CSR, but do not see it as a determinant when choosing a <b>tour</b> <b>operator.</b> Thus, CSR does not constitute a competitive advantage against competitors. However, that is not to say a <b>tour</b> <b>operator</b> can choose not to part take in acts for sustainability since the risk of negative publicity would increase remarkably, as well as loss of legitimacy.

40|$|The Hong Kong tourism {{industry}} has enjoyed {{rapid growth in}} recent years and is becoming one of the pillars in its economy. This paper will consider a Hong Kong tourism supply chain that provides package holidays. <b>Tour</b> <b>Operators</b> are responsible for configuring and pricing their package holiday products. A common and key activity of all these tourist products is a visit to a theme park destination. This tourism supply chain includes three sectors. Theme park and hotel and accommodation providers respectively coordinate with <b>tour</b> <b>operators</b> where a horizontal competition exists to optimize their own objectives. We are interested in investigating into (1) what optimal equilibrium states <b>tour</b> <b>operators</b> could achieve through competing with each other; (2) the coordinated relationships between <b>tour</b> <b>operators</b> and theme park or hotel and accommodation providers; and (3) the differentiations between the effect of quantity competition and the effect of price competition on the three sectors (e. g. <b>tour</b> <b>operators,</b> hotel and accommodation providers, and theme park). These three questions are studied through a tourism supply chain oligopoly game framework: (a) under Cournot model of a coordinated sequential game where <b>tour</b> <b>operators</b> achieve a Nash equilibrium through quantity competition; (b) under Bertrand model of a coordinated sequential game where <b>tour</b> <b>operators</b> achieve a Nash equilibrium through price competition; and (c) comparing the tourist quantity and the profits of the three sectors between quantity competition and price competition. The most important finding is that <b>tour</b> <b>operators</b> are more interested in quantity competition, while the theme park prefers price competition among <b>tour</b> <b>operators.</b> link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

In-depth interviews and a quantitative analysis of the actions taken by 126 outbound <b>tour</b> <b>operators</b> revealed that the introduction of the PMZ was extensively negotiated. The results show the various stages of implementation and three types of tour operators: `unconvinced minor participants¿, `open-minded yet sceptical participants¿, and `loyal actors¿. The analysis also demonstrates that on average, <b>tour</b> <b>operators</b> made 13. 6 actions, which is almost three times the minimum requirement (five) set by the VRO. Between them, the 126 <b>tour</b> <b>operators</b> have undertaken a total of 1710 actions, of which over 87 % concern the environmental dimension of sustainability. Unquestionably, the introduction of PMZ helped <b>tour</b> <b>operators</b> to identify some of the environmental consequences of their operations, and to single out and implement environmental friendly initiatives. However, the rather general criteria and lax entry requirements at this stage led to an abundance of proposed actions by <b>tour</b> <b>operators</b> that were often `soft¿ and indeterminate.
