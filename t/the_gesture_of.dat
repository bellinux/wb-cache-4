5|$|Adding to {{the inner}} {{complexities}} of the picture and creating further visual interactions is the male dwarf in the foreground, whose raised hand echoes <b>the</b> <b>gesture</b> <b>of</b> {{the figure in the}} background, while his playful demeanour, and distraction from the central action, are in complete contrast with it. The informality of his pose, his shadowed profile, and his dark hair all serve to make him a mirror image to the kneeling attendant of the Infanta. However, the painter has set him forward of the light streaming through the window, and so minimised the contrast of tone on this foreground figure.|$|E
5|$|The open {{right hand}} of the monk is {{interpreted}} as an oath-making gesture, or a blessing gesture in Christian tradition. The red book in the left hand refers to the oath book of the city (in accordance with <b>the</b> <b>gesture</b> <b>of</b> the right hand), or the municipal law book which is bounded in red and has been handed down since 1365. Another interpretation {{is that it is}} a gospel book.|$|E

Mavrogenes replicated <b>the</b> <b>gesture</b> <b>of</b> the Grand Vizier, and arrested Ivan Ivanovich Severin, Russia's consul in Wallachia. Severin was soon freed, after the intervention of Georg Ignaz, Freiherr von Metzburg, the Habsburg consul, who described Mavrogenes as acting maniacally and being terrified {{by the prospect of}} being at war.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in the 11th century, Paris {{had been}} {{governed by a}} Royal Provost, {{appointed}} by the king, {{who lived in the}} fortress of Grand Châtelet. Saint Louis created a new position, the Provost of the Merchants (prévôt des marchands), to share authority with the Royal Provost and recognize the growing power and wealth of the merchants of Paris. The importance of guilds of craftsmen was reflected in <b>the</b> <b>gesture</b> <b>of</b> the city government to adapt its coat of arms, featuring a ship, from the symbol of the guild of the boatmen. Saint Louis created the first municipal council of Paris, with twenty-four members.|$|E
25|$|The picture's {{theatrical}} design {{places the}} most prominent figures in a shallow foreground stage. Immediately behind them are a diverting company of pages, halberdiers, dwarfs, dogs and monkeys, and in the further distance looms an architectural screen, an arched promenade parallel to the picture plane and supporting more spectators. These are pictorial preferences typical of Veronese, with the placement of figures and edifices reinforcing a processional character. The curves of the distant arches echo {{the movement of the}} supplicated foreground figures, while <b>the</b> <b>gesture</b> <b>of</b> Sisygambis corresponds to and is reinforced by the verticals of the central fountain; the architectural geometry organizes the movement of the figures.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>gesture</b> <b>of</b> {{doubling}} – as {{an aesthetic}} and conceptual strategy – {{has been a}} recurrent motif for Horn since 1980, a tool that invites careful scrutiny from the viewer. In 2008, Bird (1998–2007), the artist’s long-running photographic series of taxidermied Icelandic wildfowl were shown for the first time. Photographed at close range against white backgrounds (as though obeying the conventional format of studio portraiture) the birds are viewed from behind, their unique physiognomies and markings resulting in inscrutable shapes and patterns on the photographs’ surfaces. Despite the singular form of the title the birds in this series are all presented in pairs, images that are hung side by side one another highlighting the differences and similarities between the two.|$|E
25|$|The {{composition}} of the Madonna of the Yarnwinder shows the Christ child twisting his body away from his mother’s embrace, his eye caught by her yarnwinder whose spokes give it {{the shape of a}} cross; he precociously recognises it as a symbol of his destiny. The Virgin’s reaction is ambiguous, a mixture of alarm at the harm her son will come to and resigned acceptance of it. <b>The</b> <b>gesture</b> <b>of</b> suspense made with her right hand is repeated from Leonardo’s Milanese altarpiece The Virgin of the Rocks. The use of a symbol of the Passion as an object of childish play recurs throughout Leonardo’s painted oeuvre, appearing for instance in the Benois Madonna and the Virgin and Child with St Anne. As with later works by Leonardo, the figures appear in a vast unpopulated landscape. The rocky outcrop in the foreground of the Buccleuch Madonna is painted with a minute attention to geological detail.|$|E
25|$|Unlike some of Pisanello's other {{portrait}} medals, such {{as those}} of Leonello d'Este, the reverse of the medal of John presents no iconographic or allegorical mysteries. It shows the emperor on horseback, in profile to the right. Behind him, mounted on another horse, is a page or squire viewed from the rear and foreshortened. The emperor wears his distinctive hat and carries a bow on his left side and a quiver of arrows above his right leg. The double reigns of the emperor’s horse are visible and both horses possess elaborate straps over their hindquarters. The illustration conveys the arrest of a hunting expedition occasioned by John’s encounter with a pedestalled wayside cross. <b>The</b> <b>gesture</b> <b>of</b> the emperor’s raised right hand indicates his acknowledgement, in an act of piety, of the cross before him. The event takes place in a rocky landscape and is framed in the bottom portion by a Greek inscription: Ἕργον του Πισἀνου Ζωγρἀφου (‘The work of Pisano the painter’). This inscription is repeated in Latin within the top of the scene: OPVS • PISANI • PICTORIS.|$|E

6000|$|Perhaps {{the nearest}} verbal {{analysis}} of the instinct {{may be found in}} <b>the</b> <b>gestures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> orator addressing a crowd. For the true orator must always be a demagogue: even if the mob be a small mob, like the French committee or the English House of Lords. And [...] "demagogue," [...] in the good Greek meaning, does not mean one who pleases the populace, but one who leads it: and if you will notice, you will see that all <b>the</b> instinctive <b>gestures</b> <b>of</b> oratory are <b>gestures</b> <b>of</b> military leadership; pointing the people to a path or waving them on to an advance. Notice that long sweep of the arm across the body and outward, which great orators use naturally and cheap orators artificially. It is almost <b>the</b> exact <b>gesture</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> drawing of a sword.|$|R
25|$|Redmond {{requested}} the War Office {{to allow the}} formation of a separate 'Irish Brigade' as had been done for the Ulster Volunteers, but Britain was suspicious of Redmond. His plan was that post-war the 'Irish Brigade' and National Volunteers would provide the basis for an Irish Army, capable of enforcing Home Rule on reluctant Ulster Unionists. Eventually he was granted <b>the</b> <b>gesture</b> <b>of</b> the 16th (Irish) Division which, with the exception of its Irish General Bernhard Hickie at first had mostly English officers, unlike the Ulster Division which had its own reserve militia officers, since most of the experienced officers in Ireland had already been posted to the 10th (Irish) Division and most Irish recruits enlisting in the new army lacked the military training to act as officers. Redmond's own son, William Redmond, enlisted, as did his own brother Major Willie Redmond MP, despite being aged over 50 years. They belonged to a group of five Irish MPs who enlisted, the others J. L. Esmonde, Stephen Gwynn, and D. D. Sheehan as well as former MP Tom Kettle.|$|E
25|$|There {{are four}} large icons between the doors. These were {{probably}} painted by Mátyás Hittner, since their style slightly {{differs from the}} icons above. The paintings of the Sovereign follow the traditional placement. On the northern side of the iconostasis is the icon of Saint Nicholas. In Hajdúdorog he is depicted in an episcopal vestment. He makes <b>the</b> <b>gesture</b> <b>of</b> teaching or blessing with his right hand, and he holds a crosier and a white handkerchief in his left. The icon of the Theotokos {{is on the left}} of the Royal Door. It is a traditional depiction of mother Mary holding her child in her arms. The child Jesus holds a blue orb in his left representing his rule above both our world and the others. His right hand makes the same gesture as Saint Nicholas. The icon {{on the other side of}} the Royal Door is that of the Pantocrator, which is a specific depiction of Christ. The Pantocrator, like the Theotokos icon, holds an orb in his left and makes the teaching gesture with his right. An open book lies before him, probably the New Testament based on the traditional depiction.|$|E
25|$|Sītāsvayaṃvaram (Sanskrit: सीतास्वयंवरम्). Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa get up {{next morning}} and bow to Viśvāmitra. The three come {{together}} to the Svayaṃvara of Sītā. The children, youth and elderly, and the maidens of Mithilā are enraptured {{by the sight of}} Rāma. Janaka sees Rāma and prays in his mind that Rāma breaks the bow of Śiva. The twelve different groups of people in the assembly at Sītā's Svayaṃvara view Rāma with twelve different emotions (Rasas). The bards of Mithilā announce the vow of Janaka – the prince who is able to string the Pināka, the bow of Śiva, will have the right to marry Sītā. Many kings in the assembly, including Bāṇāsura and Rāvaṇa try to lift the bow but are unsuccessful. Ten thousand kings endeavour to lift the bow together but are not able to. Janaka is disappointed and asks all kings to go home, saying that he would rather Sītā remain a spinster if the earth has become devoid of the brave. On hearing Janaka's words, Lakṣmaṇa expresses his anger in the assembly but Rāma calms him down with <b>the</b> <b>gesture</b> <b>of</b> his eyes. Viśvāmitra orders Rāma to break the bow. Rāma lifts the bow {{as if it were a}} straw and breaks it into two instantly. Amidst the chanting of Vedic Mantras by Viśvāmitra, Sītā garlands Rāma. Janaka acclaims Rāma by bowing to him.|$|E

25|$|The king, Shalmaneser III, {{stands before}} four divine emblems: (1) the winged disk, {{the symbol of}} the god Ashur, or, as some hold, of Shamash; (2) the six-pointed star of Ishtar, goddess of the morning and evening star; (3) the crown of the sky-god Anu, in this {{instance}} with three horns, in profile; (4) the disk and crescent of the god Sin as the new and the full moon. On his collar the king wears as amulets (1) the fork, {{the symbol of the}} weather-god, Adad; (2) a segment of a circle, of uncertain meaning; (3) an eight-pointed star in a disk, here probably the symbol of Shamash, the sun-god; (4) a winged disk, again of the god Ashur. <b>The</b> <b>gesture</b> <b>of</b> the right hand has been much discussed and variously interpreted, either {{as the end of the}} action of throwing a kiss as an act of worship, or as resulting from cracking the fingers with the thumb, as a ritual act which is attributed to the Assyrians by later Greek writers, or as being simply a gesture of authority suitable to the king, with no reference to a particular religious significance. It seems fairly clear that the gesture is described in the phrase 'uban damiqti taraṣu', 'to stretch out a favourable finger', a blessing which corresponds to the reverse action, in which the index finger is not stretched out. There is a cuneiform inscription written across the face and base and around the sides of the stela.|$|E

His campaign used a non-confrontational approach, in stark contrast with the Peronist candidate for the governorship of the Buenos Aires province, Herminio Iglesias.

Both Iglesias and Ítalo Luder, the Peronist candidate to the presidency, saw a decrease in their public image as a result.|$|E

500|$|By then {{a teacher}} at the 1st School for Boys, on Română Street, Creangă was ordered out of his secular {{assignment}} in July 1872, when news of his status and attitude reached Education Minister Christian Tell. Upset by the circumstances, and objecting in writing on grounds that it did not refer to his teaching abilities, he fell back on income produced by a tobacconist's shop he had established shortly before being dismissed. This stage marked a final development in Creangă's conflict with the church hierarchy. Summoned to explain why he was living the life of a shopkeeper, he responded in writing by showing his unwillingness to apologize, and indicated that he would only agree to face secular courts. The virulent text notably accused the church officials of being his enemies on account of his [...] "independence, sincerity, honesty" [...] in supporting the cause of [...] "human dignity".
