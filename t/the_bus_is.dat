5|$|September 30, 2002: Arturo Martinez Tapia {{assaulted}} a Greyhound driver near Fresno, California, {{resulting in}} two passenger deaths after the bus then rolled off an embankment and crashed. Following this attack, an aisle gate and driver's shield were installed on most Greyhound buses which prevent passengers from having {{direct contact with}} the driver when <b>the</b> <b>bus</b> <b>is</b> in motion, even if the aisle gate is forced open.|$|E
5|$|In December 2009, it was {{announced}} that following the success of Bustracker, an application had been developed for the iPhone that is similar to the way Bustracker works. It allows people to download an application to their iPhone that enables them to see where their nearest bus stop is and when <b>the</b> <b>bus</b> <b>is</b> due. Although not developed by Lothian Buses or The City of Edinburgh Council, the application has now won the backing of both companies. My Bus Edinburgh is an application developed for the Android platform which is similar in functionality to the iPhone application. Like the iPhone application, this application is developed by an independent developer, backed by Lothian Buses and The City of Edinburgh Council, and is available free of charge.|$|E
5|$|The {{station is}} {{equipped}} with a shed, but no other amenities, and also lacks a ticket machine. The platform (but not necessarily the train) is wheelchair accessible. There are about ten parking spaces at the station. A shuttle bus corresponds to all trains during the opening hours of the airport, and a bus trip takes four minutes to the airport terminal. The shuttle bus leaves the airport ten minutes before each train's scheduled departure. <b>The</b> <b>bus</b> <b>is</b> operated by NSB, and is included in the price of the train ticket. There are 42 bus departures each day. The train supplements a coach service, Torp Expressen operated by UniBuss, to Oslo, and a local bus service to Sandefjord, operated by Vestviken Kollektivtrafikk.|$|E
50|$|The {{construction}} of <b>the</b> NDO <b>bus</b> <b>was</b> based on <b>the</b> Praga ND truck, with the forward-located engine and its cowling unchanged. <b>The</b> <b>bus</b> body <b>was</b> mostly made of metal, only {{the roof was}} made of wood and canvas. <b>The</b> <b>bus</b> maximal speed <b>was</b> 55 km/h. The maximal loaded weight of <b>the</b> <b>bus</b> <b>was</b> 13600 kg.|$|R
50|$|Temsa, a Turkish <b>bus</b> manufacturer, made <b>the</b> world's first {{armoured}} passenger <b>bus.</b> <b>The</b> <b>bus</b> <b>was</b> {{displayed at}} <b>the</b> 9th International Defence Industry Fair (IDEF'09). <b>The</b> <b>bus</b> <b>was</b> tested in Germany with bombs and multiple calibres of ammunition.|$|R
50|$|Following the accident, {{the coach}} was {{retained}} at the RTC Tompkins yard, {{covered by a}} giant tarp to preserve it for inspection during the ongoing investigation and litigation. Upon closure of the RTC Tompkins facility, <b>the</b> <b>bus</b> <b>was</b> taken from <b>the</b> facility and moved to an off-site storage location. In 2011, with the investigation over, <b>the</b> <b>bus</b> <b>was</b> moved to <b>the</b> RTC Simmons facility where <b>the</b> <b>bus</b> <b>was</b> finally dismantled for any usable parts & eventually scrapped.|$|R
25|$|Letter prefixes are {{prepended}} {{to the bus}} {{numbers on}} all conventional Coast Mountain buses, except trolleys. Generally, the prefixes are used to identify which garage <b>the</b> <b>bus</b> <b>is</b> operating from.|$|E
25|$|Starting April 21, 2016, TransJakarta {{launched}} {{several new}} female-only buses for Corridor 1. <b>The</b> <b>bus</b> <b>is</b> crewed by female driver and female onboard officers, and is painted pink to {{distinguish it from}} regular buses.|$|E
25|$|Though {{public transit}} {{accidents}} attract far more publicity than car wrecks, public transport has much lower accident rates. Annually, public transit prevents 200,000 deaths, injuries, and accidents had equivalent trips {{been made by}} car. The National Safety Council estimates that riding <b>the</b> <b>bus</b> <b>is</b> over 170 times safer than private car.|$|E
50|$|At around 16:30 on 7 February 2012, a Marchwood Motorways Mercedes-Benz Citaro {{caught fire}} on Calmore Roundabout, Totton. <b>The</b> <b>bus</b> <b>was</b> being driven Not In Service by a {{mechanic}} {{at the time}} - there were no injuries but <b>the</b> <b>bus</b> <b>was</b> destroyed.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>bus</b> <b>was</b> {{carrying}} around 50 passengers, mostly Iranian expatriates who were post-graduate {{students at the}} University of the Visayas and Cebu Doctors' University. <b>The</b> <b>bus</b> had <b>been</b> travelling from Cebu City to Balamban. At around 10:30 am, local time, while <b>the</b> <b>bus</b> <b>was</b> traversing <b>the</b> Trans Central Highway in Balamban, Cebu, the brakes apparently failed and <b>the</b> <b>bus</b> fell some 30 meters into a ravine. At least 21 of the passengers were killed, while around 30 were injured.|$|R
50|$|Electric motor {{is located}} in the rear of <b>the</b> <b>bus.</b> Inside <b>are</b> used {{leatherette}} or plastic Vogelsitze seats. Only rear axle is propulsed. On the right side of <b>the</b> <b>bus</b> <b>are</b> three doors.|$|R
25|$|The bus has the 1-2-2-2 door configuration. The {{end of the}} bus {{has been}} {{designed}} to the style of the tram Tramino. <b>The</b> <b>bus</b> <b>is</b> 18 metres long. The front of the bus, including the roof has a more elegant and bow style making the bus look more streamline. There are covers over the wheels. The bus was fitted with Hübner lighting system which can be turned on at night to give orange lights under the bus.|$|E
25|$|The framed tent (1965–1967). This is {{the largest}} and most {{colorful}} of the Westfalia side tents. It's different from the earlier small and large awning-based tents in two important ways: the addition of large, screened windows on the side curtains, and a free-standing frame that allows the tent to be left at the campsite while <b>the</b> <b>bus</b> <b>is</b> driven away for groceries or side trips. The tent also has a rear door that can be zipped closed at such times. Both front and rear flaps can be rolled up and held open by cloth ties or (on later models) straps with lift-the-dot fasteners.|$|E
25|$|In early 2005 Shanghai {{tested a}} new form of {{electric}} bus called capabus that runs without powerlines (catenary free operation) using large onboard supercapacitors that partially recharge whenever <b>the</b> <b>bus</b> <b>is</b> at a stop (under so-called electric umbrellas), and fully charge in the terminus. In 2006, two commercial bus routes began to use the capabuses; one of them is route 11 in Shanghai. It was estimated that the supercapacitor bus was cheaper than a lithium-ion battery bus, and one of its buses had one-tenth the energy cost of a diesel bus with lifetime fuel savings of $200,000.|$|E

25|$|Dubmill is {{situated}} on the B5300 coast road, and is served by a bus which, as of mid-2015, runs between Silloth-on-Solway {{in the north and}} Workington in the south. <b>The</b> <b>bus</b> <b>is</b> run by local company Reay's, and calls once every two hours in either direction during the day. However, Dubmill today is a very small settlement, consisting of a single farm, and thus has no amenities or facilities of its own. In nearby Allonby, there is a convenience store, leisure centre, post office, fish-and-chip shop, and even an antiques shop, as well as several pubs and restaurants. There is also a pub in Mawbray, called The Lowther.|$|E
500|$|Another One Rides <b>the</b> <b>Bus</b> <b>is</b> {{the debut}} {{extended}} play (EP) by American parodist [...] "Weird Al" [...] Yankovic. It {{was released in}} 1981 by Placebo Records. The title song is a parody of English rock band Queen's 1980 single [...] "Another One Bites the Dust". The EP also features three other songs, {{all of which are}} original recordings. All four songs on Another One Rides the Bus later appeared on Yankovic's eponymous debut studio album; the three original songs were re-recorded for the album, while the title song is the same version that appears on the EP.|$|E
500|$|In August 2010, {{the company}} {{introduced}} an early running alarm system for drivers, which is linked into the automatic vehicle tracking system, and sounds an alarm and displays warning messages if <b>the</b> <b>bus</b> <b>is</b> running early. This {{was as a}} result of the company being fined £10,500 by the Traffic Commissioner for Scotland, having been found to be running buses early. After a customer complaint, Vehicle and Operator Services Agency monitored services 4, 16, 27 and 45 in February 2010, and found that of 303 instances, 44 buses were running early, despite starting the route on time, while 20 were running late. The company's defence was that they had built in some running time to cope with the delays due to tram works, but in some places, these works had ended early. The Commissioner accepted this defence, and chose not to take action against the company's operating licence (which authorises a maximum of 700 vehicles). Instead the Commissioner imposed a fine set much lower than the legal maximum (calculated as £550 * 700 vehicles = £385,000) ...|$|E

2500|$|The arbiter {{may also}} provide GNT# {{at any time}}, {{including}} during another master's transaction. During a transaction, either FRAME# or IRDY# or both are asserted; when both are deasserted, <b>the</b> <b>bus</b> <b>is</b> idle.

2500|$|A PCI bus {{transaction}} {{begins with}} an address phase. [...] The initiator, seeing that it has GNT# and <b>the</b> <b>bus</b> <b>is</b> idle, drives the target address onto the AD lines, the associated command (e.g. memory read, or I/O write) on the C/BE# lines, and pulls FRAME# low.|$|E
2500|$|A target {{abandons}} {{a delayed}} transaction when a retry succeeds in delivering the buffered result, <b>the</b> <b>bus</b> <b>is</b> reset, or when 215=32768 clock cycles (approximately 1ms) elapse without seeing a retry. [...] The latter should never happen in normal operation, but it prevents a deadlock {{of the whole}} bus if one initiator is reset or malfunctions.|$|E
