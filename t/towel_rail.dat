5000|$|A towel dryer or {{a heated}} <b>towel</b> <b>rail</b> is a feature {{designed}} to heat towels before using them. For many years European hotels {{have been using}} them as combined towel- dryers/racks.|$|E
50|$|Another meaning attested is a washstand, a {{piece of}} {{furniture}} equipped with basin, jug, and <b>towel</b> <b>rail,</b> and often with space to store the chamber pot behind closed doors. A washstand in the bedroom pre-dates indoor bathrooms and running water.|$|E
5000|$|... "A Paisley shawl is {{hung on a}} <b>towel</b> <b>rail</b> {{in front}} of the bath. These shawls were highly fashionable for women's daywear until around 1870. By 1905 a {{beautiful}} Paisley shawl might still have been used to visit a chilly country house bathroom.|$|E
50|$|Pennsylvania Court (Penny C) was {{finished}} in 2004. In {{contrast to the}} traditional appearance {{of the rest of}} Exeter Halls, Pennsylvania Court is more modern, in both its appearance and facilities. It contains 4-star en-suite accommodation including balconies, heated <b>towel</b> <b>rails</b> and double beds. Housing around 180 students, Pennsylvania Court is generally the most oversubscribed hall on campus.|$|R
50|$|The {{bathroom}} retains many original finishes including: green faux- marble panelling to {{the walls}} with black faux-marble jointing and skirting strips, and rubber tile flooring. Above the height of 2.4 metres painted timber boards line the walls and ceiling. The bathtub and washbasin are early fixtures, as are the <b>towel</b> <b>rails.</b> There {{appears to be a}} hidden cupboard between the bathroom and hallway.|$|R
50|$|The toilets in {{the east}} wing are largely in {{original}} condition. Floors are glass mosaic with ceramic tile skirtings. Cubicle panels are terrazzo. Splash-backs to the hand basins and to the urinal are ceramic tiled. Walls are painted. Cubicle doors are painted timber with an unusual scalloped top and bottom. <b>Towel</b> <b>rails</b> and toilet roll holders appear to be original and match the door furniture. A number of the sanitary fittings appear to be original.|$|R
5000|$|The {{exhibition}} displayed {{examples of}} the best gas fittings {{of the day in}} mock rooms representing a large and a small town house, [...] "unusually" [...] mixing manufacturers' products in the spaces rather than having individual trade stands for competing companies. The exhibition catalogue guides the visitor around the seven halls detailing all of the gas powered objects on show. These included ovens, cookers, toasters, tea boilers, irons, fires, radiators, <b>towel</b> <b>rails,</b> cigar lighters, and a wide variety of lights including lamps, table lamps, pendents.|$|R
50|$|There is {{evidence}} in the two small rooms on the eastern wall of plumbing fixtures. The concrete floor in these spaces slopes toward an outside corner. There are sections of an early <b>towel</b> peg <b>rail</b> and early timber bench seating around the external walls in both halves of the building. Evidence in the concrete floor indicates the position of previous fittings.|$|R
50|$|Internal spaces {{have been}} altered with the {{addition}} of concrete block walls in many places both in the kiosk and in the change rooms. Timber roof trusses and the underside of the roof sheeting are exposed in most rooms. Sections of timber bench seating and <b>towel</b> peg <b>rails</b> from the 1930s remain in the change rooms. The entrance foyer on the western side of the pavilion has early turnstiles.|$|R
50|$|Electrical appliances, such as lights, heaters, {{and heated}} <b>towel</b> <b>rails,</b> {{generally}} {{need to be}} installed as fixtures, with permanent connections rather than plugs and sockets. This minimizes the risk of electric shock. Ground-fault circuit interrupter electrical sockets can {{reduce the risk of}} electric shock, and are required for bathroom socket installation by electrical and building codes in the United States and Canada. In some countries, such as the United Kingdom, only special sockets suitable for electric shavers and electric toothbrushes are permitted in bathrooms, and are labelled as such. UK building regulations also define what type of electrical fixtures, such as light fittings (i.e. how water-/splash-proof) may be installed in the areas (zones) around and above baths, and showers. Contrary to some information provided with bathroom light fittings, sinks and basins do not affect bathroom zones, as a bathroom is solely defined as a room containing a bath or shower, by wiring regulations. It is nevertheless good practice to avoid installing unsuitable fixtures close to sinks, as damage from water splashes may occur.|$|R
40|$|This report {{offers an}} {{overview}} of the bathroom furnishings and wellness sector in China, providing data on production and consumption, international trade, supply structure, distribution and prices. The field of study includes the following products: bathroom furniture, bathroom accessories (<b>towel</b> <b>rails,</b> soap dishes, lavatory brushes, etc), shower enclosures (one, two, three-sided or complete cabins), multifunctional shower boxes and whirlpools.

40|$|Producing {{domestic}} {{hot water}} (DHW) with a {{ground source heat pump}} (GSHP) is challenging due to the high temperature (HT) of DHW. There are many studies proving the better performance of cascade heat pumps compared to single-stage heat pumps when the difference between the condensing and the evaporation temperature is large. In this system approach study, different GSHP arrangements are described and computationally compared. A two-stage heat pump arrangement is introduced in which water tanks of the heating system are utilized for warming up the DHW in two stages. It is shown that the electricity consumption with this two-stage system is approximately 31 % less than with the single-stage heat pump and 12 % less than with the cascade system. Further, both low temperature (LT) and HT heat pumps can run alone, which is not common in cascade or other two-stage heat pumps. This is advantageous because the high loads of the space heating and DHW production are not simultaneous. Proper insulation of the DHW and recirculation pipe network is essential, and drying <b>towel</b> <b>rails</b> or other heating coils should be avoided when aiming for a high efficiency. The refrigerants in the calculations are R 407 C for the LT heat pump and R 134 a for the HT heat pump. Investment costs are excluded from calculations...|$|R
5000|$|The rear {{suspension}} was significantly revised including a widened track, softer torsion bars {{and the addition}} of a unique Z-configuration equalizing torsion spring. On US, UK and Ireland models, the generator output was increased from 180 to 360 watts, and the entire electrical system was upgraded from 6 volts to 12 volts. The clutch disc also increased in size and changes were made to the flywheel. New equipment included a driver's armrest on the door and locking buttons on both doors. Safety improvements included two-speed windscreen wipers, reversing lights (in some markets), and a driver's side mirror. In accord with the newly enacted US Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 108, North American models received a dual-circuit brake system, the clear glass headlamp covers were deleted; the headlamps were brought forward to {{the leading edge of the}} front fenders, and the sealed-beam units were exposed and surrounded by chrome bezels. (Throughout the rest of the world markets the 1967 model sold in Europe et.al. still retained the older headlights (including its counterparts in Latin America - especially the Brasilian market model retaining the pre-1965 bodystyle). Another oddity of the 1967 North American market Beetle is the rear bumper overriders (<b>towel</b> <b>rails)</b> - the overriders have a different shape unlike the older models besides the one-year only engine decklid.|$|R
60|$|A little later, {{when his}} steps took him, {{naturally}} enough, past {{the entrance to}} Mercy Farm, he {{was passed by the}} negro, moving quickly under the trees wherever there was shadow. Laid across one extended arm, looking like dirty <b>towels</b> across a <b>rail,</b> he had the horrid-looking snakes. He did not seem to see Adam. No one was to be seen at Mercy except a few workmen in the farmyard, so, after waiting on the chance of seeing Mimi, Adam began to go slowly home.|$|R
6000|$|Night. A lady's bedchamber in Bulgaria, {{in a small}} [...] {{town near}} the Dragoman Pass. It is late in [...] November in the year 1885, and through an open [...] window with a little balcony on the left can be [...] seen a peak of the Balkans, wonderfully white and [...] {{beautiful}} in the starlit snow. The interior of the [...] room is not like anything {{to be seen in}} the east [...] of Europe. It is half rich Bulgarian, half cheap [...] Viennese. The counterpane and hangings of the bed, [...] the window curtains, the little carpet, and all [...] the ornamental textile fabrics in the room are [...] oriental and gorgeous: the paper on the walls is [...] occidental and paltry.

On the left, further forward, is an [...] ottoman. The washstand, against the wall on the [...] left, consists of an enamelled iron basin with a [...] pail beneath it in a painted metal frame, and a [...] single <b>towel</b> on the <b>rail</b> at the side. A chair near [...] it is Austrian bent wood, with cane seat. The [...] dressing table, between the bed and the window, is [...] an ordinary pine table, covered with a cloth of [...] many colors, but with an expensive toilet mirror [...] on it. The door is on the right; and there is a [...] chest of drawers between the door and the bed. [...] This chest of drawers is also covered by a [...] variegated native cloth, and on it there is a pile [...] of paper backed novels, a box of chocolate creams, [...] and a miniature easel, on which is a large [...] photograph of an extremely handsome officer, whose [...] lofty bearing and magnetic glance can be felt even [...] from the portrait. The room is lighted by a candle [...] on the chest of drawers, and another on the [...] dressing table, with a box of matches beside it.|$|R
