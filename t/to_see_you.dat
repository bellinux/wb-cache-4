One Japanese superstition says that if {{a butterfly}} enters your guest room and perches behind the bamboo screen, the person whom you most love is coming <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you.</b> Large numbers of butterflies are viewed as bad omens. When Taira no Masakado was secretly preparing for his famous revolt, there appeared in Kyoto so vast a swarm of butterflies that the people were frightened— thinking the apparition to be a portent of coming evil.|$|E

Another release, I Only Want <b>to</b> <b>See</b> <b>You</b> There (1983) contained mostly previously released material.

25|$|In March 2011, Oz sent imprisoned former Tanzim leader Marwan Barghouti {{a copy of}} {{his book}} A Tale of Love and Darkness in Arabic {{translation}} with his personal dedication in Hebrew: “This story is our story, I hope you read it and understand us as we understand you, hoping <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you</b> outside and in peace, yours, Amos Oz”. The gesture was criticized by members of rightist political parties, among them Likud MK Tzipi Hotovely. Assaf Harofeh Hospital canceled Oz's invitation to give the keynote speech at an awards ceremony for outstanding physicians in the wake of this incident.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the usage}} of 'not' in {{splitting}} infinitives {{is an issue that}} has not attracted much attention from the English users, contemporary English grammar puts the phrase into the same category as above. This appears to be because the traditional idiom, placing the negation before the marker (I soon learned not to provoke her) or with verbs of desire, negating the finite verb (I don't want <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you</b> anymore) remains easy and natural, and is still overwhelmingly the more common construction in British English. On the other hand, in the case of American English, a search on the corpus of contemporary American English displays a different aspect. Its usage is more commonly found in the American context, where we can find at least 2,200 cases of {{the usage of}} 'not' in splitting infinitives.|$|E

500|$|The {{absence of}} Adams from home was hard on Abigail, who {{was left alone}} {{to care for the}} family.

500|$|Leave Home has various lyrical themes {{throughout}} its track list. The opening song, [...] "Glad <b>to</b> <b>See</b> <b>You</b> Go", is rather uptempo and frenetic. The track was about Dee Dee's then-girlfriend Connie, who {{was well known}} in the punk rock scene as having once dated New York Dolls bassist Arthur Kane and attempting to cut his finger off with a knife. Connie also harmed Dee Dee in several ways, such as slicing his buttocks with a beer bottle. At the time, every other member of the band despised Dee Dee's girlfriend and he eventually broke up with her. Joey recalls: [...] "Dee [...] and I came up with the song 'Glad <b>to</b> <b>See</b> <b>You</b> Go,' about Connie's leaving." [...] In the mid-1980s, Connie died from a drug overdose. [...] "Gimme Gimme Shock Treatment" [...] utilizes Joey's singing abilities with its vocal-demanding melody. Author Scott Schinder called the song a [...] "sing-along mental-illness ode." [...] The next song, [...] "I Remember You" [...] was said by author Greil Marcus to be all about the moment where [...] "Joey's voice turns the single word [...] "you" [...] into pure poetry." [...] "Oh, Oh, I Love Her So" [...] pays homage to the 1950s doo-wop genre, and consists of a three-chord barrage. The song was written solely by Joey, where in the song he humorously tells of how he met a girl at Burger King and they fell in love by a soda machine.|$|E

500|$|However, rumors persisted and it {{was later}} whispered in society that Rasputin had seduced not only the Tsarina but also the four grand duchesses. The gossip was fueled by ardent, yet by all {{accounts}} innocent, letters written to Rasputin by the Tsarina and the four grand duchesses which were released by Rasputin and which circulated throughout society. [...] "My dear, precious, only friend," [...] wrote Anastasia. [...] "How much I should like <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>you</b> again. You appeared to me today in a dream.
