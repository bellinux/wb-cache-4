40|$|Biotas {{that evolved}} in {{isolation}} from mammalian predators are susceptible to degradation due to recent human-mediated introductions of mammals. However, behavioural, morphological and life historical adaptations of prey to novel mammalian predators can allow prey to persist in mammal-invaded areas. Lizards in New Zealand are an ideal group for exploring the effects of invasive mammals on vertebrate prey because: (1) the ca. 80 endemic species evolved without mammals as a major influence for 80 my, (2) mammalian introductions during the past 2000 y have differentially affected lizard species, and (3) some species coexist with mammals on the mainland as well as occurring on mammal-free offshore islands. I tested three hypotheses: (1) lizard populations that have persisted on New Zealand’s mainland are no longer declining {{in the presence of}} introduced mammalian predators, (2) introduced mammals induce behavioural shifts in native lizards, and (3) lizard behavioural patterns and chemosensory predator detection abilities vary according to exposure to introduced mammals. Trends in capture rates of five sympatric native lizard populations over a 23 year (1984 - 2006) period demonstrate that not all lizard populations that have persisted thus far on New Zealand’s mainland have stabilised in numbers. Large, nocturnal and terrestrial species remain highly vulnerable at mainland sites. Introduced kiore, Rattus exulans, induce behavioural changes in Duvaucel’s geckos, Hoplodactylus duvaucelii. A radio telemetric study demonstrated that geckos start reverting to natural use of habitats within six months of kiore eradication. Activity patterns of common geckos, H. maculatus, and common skinks, Oligosoma nigriplantare polychroma, in laboratory trials are also correlated with their exposure to mammalian predators. Lizard activity (time spent moving) increases relative to freeze behaviour with greater exposure to mammals. However, specific antipredator behaviours are not elicited by chemical cues of either native (<b>tuatara,</b> <b>Sphenodon</b> <b>spp)</b> or introduced (ship rat, R. rattus) predators. Lizard populations may persist by changing their behaviours in the presence of invasive mammals. However, the continued declines of particularly vulnerable mainland lizard taxa suggest that mammal-induced behavioural shifts may only slow population declines rather than enabling long-term survival. Eradicating pest mammals from offshore islands has proven effective at restoring both populations and behaviours of native lizards, but lizard populations on the mainland also deserve conservation priority. Research directed at understanding the synergistic effects of invasive species that are causing continued lizard population declines and mammal-proof fencing to protect the most vulnerable mainland populations from extinction are both urgently required...|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY: Food {{habits of}} the <b>tuatara</b> (<b>Sphenodon</b> punctatus) on Stephens Island, in {{north-western}} Cook Strait, were studied by field observations and faecal analysis. The tuatara is a selective predator, feeding {{on a wide range}} of small animals, mainly large insects. Its diet shows seasonal changes and habitat differences, related to local conditions: the coastal broadleaf forest habitat, which predominated in pre-European times but is now only represented by remnants, seems to be most favourable. The tuatara population, although large, seems to be no threat to the survival of any of its prey species. FIGURE 1. Map of Stephens Island, showing main habitat types...|$|R
40|$|Sexual dimorphisms in {{body size}} and head size are common among lizards {{and are often}} related to sexual {{selection}} on male fighting capacity (organismal performance) and territory defence. However, whether this is generally true or restricted to lizards remains untested. Here we provide data on body and head size, bite performance and indicators of mating success in the <b>tuatara</b> (<b>Sphenodon</b> punctatus), the closest living relative to squamates, to explore the generality of these patterns. First, we test whether male and female tuatara are dimorphic in head dimensions and bite force, independent of body size. Next, we explore which traits best predict bite force capacity in males and females. Finally, we test whether male bite force is correlated with male mating success in a free-ranging population of <b>tuatara</b> (<b>Sphenodon</b> punctatus). Our data confirm that tuatara are indeed dimorphic in head shape, with males having bigger heads and higher bite forces than females. Across all individuals, head length and the jaw closing in-lever are the best predictors of bite force. In addition, our data show that males that are mated have higher absolute but not relative bite forces. Bite force was also significantly correlated to condition in males but not females. Whereas {{these data suggest that}} bite force may be under sexual selection in tuatara, they also indicate that body size may be the key trait under selection in contrast to what is observed in squamates that defend territories or resources by biting. © 2010 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnea...|$|R

No significant association was found between male mating success, number of MHC sequences, microsatellite heterozygosity or MHC lineage. The major determinant of mating success in tuatara was male body size, which was not related to MHC lineage or microsatellite heterozygosity.

However, if New Zealand was completely submerged near the Oligo-Miocene boundary (25 – 22  Mya), as recently suggested, an ancestral sphenodontine would need to have colonized the re-emergent landmass via ocean rafting from a currently unrecorded and now extinct Miocene population. Although an Early Miocene record does not preclude that possibility, it substantially reduces the temporal window of opportunity.

40|$|Abstract Background The sex of many {{reptiles}} {{is determined}} by the temperature an embryo experiences during its development. Three patterns of temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD) have been defined, but one pattern where only males are produced above an upper temperature threshold (Type IB) is controversial. Here we report new data on the relationship between constant temperature incubation and sexual phenotype in two species of <b>tuatara</b> (<b>Sphenodon),</b> archaic reptiles of enormous zoological significance as the sole representatives of a once widespread reptilian order. Results In both species, the pattern observed with constant incubation temperatures from 18 to 23 °C (or 24 °C) supported a female→male (FM or Type IB) pattern of TSD: in Sphenodon guntheri males were produced above a pivotal temperature of 21. 6 °C, and in S. punctatus (unnamed subspecies on Stephens Island, Cook Strait), males were produced above a pivotal temperature of 22. 0 °C. The pivotal temperatures and scaling parameters differed between species (p S. punctatus, the warmest natural nests during the TSP produce predominantly males. Conclusion An FM pattern of TSD could be currently adaptive in promoting sexual size dimorphism in tuatara. However, an FM pattern has particularly serious consequences for S. guntheri because current patterns of global warming could exacerbate the male bias already present in the relic population. </p...|$|R
40|$|Population genetic models {{predict that}} populations that are {{geographically}} {{close to each}} other are expected to be genetically more similar to each other compared to those that are widely separate. However the patterns of relationships between geographic distance and molecular divergences at neutral and constrained regions of the genome are unclear. We attempted to clarify this relationship by sequencing complete mitochondrial genomes of the relic species <b>Tuatara</b> (<b>Sphenodon</b> punctatus) from ten offshore islands of New Zealand. We observed a positive relationship that showed a proportional increase in the neutral diversity at synonymous sites (dS), with increasing geographical distance. In contrast we showed that diversity at evolutionarily constrained sites (dC) was elevated in the case of comparisons involving closely located populations. Conversely diversity was reduced in the case of comparisons between distantly located populations. These patterns were confirmed by a significant negative relationship between the ratio of dC/dS and geographic distance. The observed high dC/dS could be explained by the abundance of deleterious mutations in comparisons involving closely located populations, due to the recent population divergence times. Since distantly related populations were separated over long periods of time, deleterious mutations might have been removed by purifying selection.

However, where manipulative experiments are unethical, causality cannot be inferred from observational correlative studies. Instead, we used an experimental structure to explore temporal associations between body condition of a protected reptile, the <b>tuatara</b> (<b>Sphenodon</b> punctatus) and infestation with ectoparasites (ticks and mites). We surveyed tuatara in a mark-recapture study on Stephens Island (NewZealand), which encompassed the pre-peak, peak and post-peak infestation periods for each ectoparasite. Tick loads during the peak infestation period were negatively related to body condition of tuatara. Body condition before the peak was not related to subsequent infestation rates; however, tick loads in the peak were negatively related to subsequent changes in body condition. Mite loads during the peak infestation period were not correlated with body condition of tuatara. Body condition before the peak had no effect on subsequent mite infestation rates, but mite loads of small males during the peak were negatively related to subsequent changes in body condition. Our results suggest that both ectoparasites reduce the body condition of tuatara, which has implications for the long-term conservation management of this host and its parasites.

Amblyomma sphenodonti and its host, the <b>tuatara</b> (<b>Sphenodon),</b> are found only on small offshore islands around New Zealand. Our results show that Amblyomma sphenodonti has a more severely restricted geographic distribution than its host, as it was found on only eight of 28 islands (four out of 12 island groups) where tuatara still live. The prevalence of A. sphenodonti {{is likely to have}} been affected by low host density and fluctuations in host population size as tuatara populations became isolated on offshore islands.

A similar phylogenetic pattern to that observed in tuatara mtDNA was observed, indicating co-evolution of two species, at least since the Pleistocene. Phylogenetic analysis using 18 S rRNA sequences suggest that A. sphenodonti is not closely related to other Amblyomma species, and that a separate genus for this species may be warranted.

40|$|The {{genes of}} the major {{histocompatibility}} complex (MHC) are a central component {{of the immune system}} in vertebrates and have become important markers of functional, fitness-related genetic variation. We have investigated the evolutionary processes that generate diversity at MHC class I genes in a large population of an archaic reptile species, the <b>tuatara</b> (<b>Sphenodon</b> punctatus), found on Stephens Island, Cook Strait, New Zealand. We identified at least 2 highly polymorphic (UA type) loci and one locus (UZ) exhibiting low polymorphism. The UZ locus is characterized by low nucleotide diversity and weak balancing selection and may be either a nonclassical class I gene or a pseudogene. In contrast, the UA-type alleles have high nucleotide diversity and show evidence of balancing selection at putative peptide-binding sites. Twenty-one different UA-type genotypes were identified among 26 individuals, suggesting that the Stephens Island population has high levels of MHC class I variation. UA-type allelic diversity is generated by a mixture of point mutation and gene conversion. As has been found in birds and fish, gene conversion obscures the genealogical relationships among alleles and prevents the assignment of alleles to loci. Our results suggest that the molecular mechanisms that underpin MHC evolution in nonmammals make locus-specific amplification impossible in some species.

From 2011 onwards, cases of suspected fungal dermatitis underwent extensive diagnostic investigations. CLINCAL FINDINGS: Six cases of dermatomycosis were attributed to Paranannizziopsis australasiensis, five in tuatara and one in a coastal bearded dragon (Pogona barbata). Cases presented typically as raised, yellow to brown encrustations on the skin. Severe cases progressed to necrotising ulcerative dermatitis, and in the bearded dragon to fatal systemic mycosis. Following topical and systemic treatments, lesions resolved in all five tuatara. LABORATORY FINDINGS: Histopathological examination of skin biopsy samples revealed dermatitis with intralesional septate branching hyphae. Fungal culture yielded isolates morphologically resembling Chrysosporium species, and isolates were submitted for molecular confirmation and sequencing of DNA. DIAGNOSIS: All six cases were confirmed as dermatitis due to infection with P. australasiensis, {{on the basis of}} fungal culture and DNA sequencing of isolates. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: These are the first reported cases of dermatomycosis associated with P. australasiensis infection in tuatara, and the first cases in which systemic therapeutic agents have been used in the treatment of such disease.

Epidermis and molts from adult individuals {{of an ancient}} reptilian species, the <b>tuatara</b> (<b>Sphenodon</b> punctatus), were analysed by immunocytochemistry, mono- and bi-dimensional electrophoresis, and western blotting for alpha- and beta-keratins. The epidermis of this reptilian species with primitive anatomical traits should represent one of the more ancient amniotic epidermises available. Soft keratins (AE 1 - and AE 3 -positive) of 40 - 63 kDa and with isoelectric points (pl) at 4. 0 - 6. 8 were found in molts. The AE 3 antibody was diffusely localised over the tonofilaments of keratinocytes. The lack of basic cytolkeratins may be due to keratin alteration in molts, following corneification or enzymatic degradation of keratins. Hard (beta-) keratins of 16 - 18 kDa and pi at 6. 8, 8. 0, and 9. 2 were identified using a beta- 1 antibody produced against chick scale beta-keratin. The antibody also labeled filaments of beta-cells and of the mature, compact beta-layer. We have shown that beta-keratins in the tuatara resemble those of lizards and snakes, and that they are mainly basic proteins. These proteins replace cytolkeratins in the pre-corneoum beta-layers, from which a hard, mechanically resistant corneoum layer is formed over scales. Beta-keratins may have both a fibrous and a matrix role in forming the hard texture of corneoum scales in this ancient species, as well as in more recently evolved reptiles...|$|R
