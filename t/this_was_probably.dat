5|$|By {{the end of}} the 13th century a large prison {{had been}} built in the castle; <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> {{constructed}} in the north-west corner of the Lower Court, overlooked by the Prison Tower. The prisoners kept there in the medieval period included local poachers and, in the 15th century, religious dissidents, including Lollard supporters.|$|E
5|$|Hualālai last {{erupted in}} 1801. A severe {{earthquake}} swarm shook the volcano in 1929, lasting about a month. This caused $100,000 worth {{of damage to}} the Kona district ($1.2 million as of 2010), and two earthquakes with magnitudes of 5.5 and 6.5 were felt {{as far away as}} Honolulu. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> caused by magma movement near the surface, but there was no surface activity or eruption.|$|E
5|$|In both East and West, the scholae, the emperors' {{personal}} cavalry escort, lay {{outside the}} normal military chain of command. According to the Notitia, the tribuni (commanders) of the scholae {{reported to the}} magister officiorum, a senior civilian official. However, <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> for administrative purposes only. On campaign, a tribunus scholae probably reported direct to the emperor himself.|$|E

5|$|Sanmee {{and colleagues}} {{mention that the}} eastern North American species A.frostiana resembles A.rubrovoltata {{slightly}}, but the former has short grooves {{at the edge of}} a yellowish-orange cap, slightly larger spores, a yellow volva, and clamps at the basidial bases. Roger Heim reported A.frostiana as occurring in Thailand, but <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> a misidentification of A.rubrovolvata.|$|E
5|$|The Notitia lists a {{large number}} of units with barbarian names. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> the result of the {{transformation}} of irregular allied units serving under their own native officers (known as socii, or foederati) into regular formations. During the Principate, regular units with barbarian names are not attested until the 3rd century and even then rarely e.g. the ala I Sarmatarum attested in 3rd-century Britain, doubtless an offshoot of the Sarmatian horsemen posted there in 175.|$|E
5|$|Vahan was {{instructed}} by Heraclius {{not to engage}} in battle until all avenues of diplomacy had been explored. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> because Yazdegerd III's forces were not yet ready for the offensive in Iraq. Accordingly, Vahan sent Gregory and then Jabalah to negotiate, though their efforts proved futile. Before the battle, on Vahan's invitation, Khalid came to negotiate peace, to a similar end. These negotiations delayed the battles for a month.|$|E

5|$|Epaminondas evidently began {{serving as}} a soldier after adolescence; Plutarch refers to an {{incident}} involving Epaminondas that occurred during a battle at Mantinea. Though not explicitly stated, <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> the Spartan attack on Mantinea in 385 BC, as described by Xenophon; Plutarch tells us that Epaminondas was there {{as part of a}} Theban force aiding the Spartans, so this battle fits the description.* Hanson, Hoplites, 146; Stylianoy, Diodorus Siculus, 172. However, Buck (Boiotia, 63) questions the existence of a SpartanTheban alliance in 385 BC. Epaminondas was certainly not old enough to have served at the First Battle of Mantinea which was in 418 BC.|$|E
5|$|From 872 to 877 {{there was}} {{apparently}} {{a period of}} calm, since the sources are silent on any military operations in Sicily. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> chiefly due to internal turmoil in Muslim Sicily, with six governors reported as having taken office during this period, {{as well as the}} weakness of the Aghlabid government on the Ifriqiyan metropolis. In Italy, Muslim raids continued, but the Byzantines had a major success in 875 or 876, after the death of Louis II, when they took possession of Bari.|$|E
5|$|In 1655 the Massachusetts {{assembly}} {{passed a}} law requiring its governor to live closer to Boston; <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> done in response to Endecott's sixth consecutive election as governor. Endecott was consequently obliged to acquire a residence in Boston; although he returned to Salem frequently, Boston became his home {{for the rest of}} his life. Endecott died in Boston on 15 March 1664/5. Although early accounts claim he was buried at Boston's King's Chapel, later evidence has identified his burial site as tomb 189 in the Granary Burying Ground.|$|E

5|$|Invertebrate predators include crabs, starfish and octopuses. Crabs {{crack the}} shells with their pincers and starfish use their water {{vascular}} system {{to force the}} valves apart and then insert part of their stomach between the valves to digest the bivalve's body. It has been found experimentally that both crabs and starfish preferred molluscs that are attached by byssus threads to ones that are cemented to the substrate. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> because they could manipulate the shells and open them more easily when they could tackle them from different angles. Octopuses either pull bivalves apart by force, or they bore a hole into the shell and insert a digestive fluid before sucking out the liquified contents.|$|E
5|$|Lundy {{was granted}} to the Knights Templar by Henry II in 1160. The Templars were a major {{international}} maritime force at this time, with interests in North Devon, and almost certainly an important port at Bideford or on the River Taw in Barnstaple. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> because of the increasing threat posed by the Norse sea raiders; however, {{it is unclear whether}} they ever took possession of the island. Ownership was disputed by the Marisco family who may have already been on the island during King Stephen's reign. The Mariscos were fined, and the island was cut off from necessary supplies. Evidence of the Templars' weak hold on the island came when King John, on his accession in 1199, confirmed the earlier grant.|$|E
5|$|Moreover, {{working under}} {{commission}} from the Farnese family, Titian {{would not have}} sought to portray the sitters in an obviously unsympathetic manner. While Paul is shown as old and frail, he is given a broad chest and cunning eyes that indicate his intelligence and guile. Ottavio is presented as cold and impervious, but <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> a device to show his strength of character and conviction. Alessandro is favoured by his positioning closest to the Pope, yet x-ray analysis reveals he had originally stood {{to the left of}} the pope and was moved, probably on request by Alessandro himself, to a position where his hand was resting on the papal throne, indicating his claim on the papacy.|$|E

5|$|Takalik Abaj was reoccupied at the {{beginning}} of the Middle Preclassic. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> by Mixe–Zoquean inhabitants, as evidenced by the plentiful Olmec-style sculpture at the site dating to this period. The construction of public architecture had probably begun by the Middle Preclassic; the earliest structures were made of clay, which was sometimes partially burned in order to harden it. Ceramics from this period belonged to the local Ocosito tradition. This ceramic tradition, although it was local, showed strong affinities with the ceramics of the coastal plain and foothills of the Escuintla region.|$|E
5|$|The Chronicles {{version of}} events makes it appear that Baldred was driven out shortly after the battle, but <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> not the case. A {{document}} from Kent survives which gives the date, March 826, as being {{in the third year}} of the reign of Beornwulf. This makes it likely that Beornwulf still had authority in Kent at this date, as Baldred's overlord; hence Baldred was apparently still in power. In Essex, Ecgberht expelled King Sigered, though the date is unknown. It may have been delayed until 829, since a later chronicler associates the expulsion with a campaign of Ecgberht's in that year against the Mercians.|$|E
5|$|The Eretrian {{strategy}} was to defend their walls, and undergo a siege. Possibly {{this was the only}} plan that could be agreed on, or became the default option when no plan was agreed. At any rate, since the Persian army had only suffered two defeats in the last century, and since a Greek army had never successfully fought the Persians, <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> a sensible strategy. Since the Persians arrived by ship, it is probable they had little siege equipment, and indeed, they had already been foiled in the siege of Lindos earlier in the expedition.|$|E

5|$|The Munich {{coat of arms}} is verifiable from {{seals in}} 1239 and 1268. These seals show a monk in a gate, above which is in eagle, {{referring}} to the Bishop of Freising. The city belonged to him and <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> derived from his coat of arms. From 1313, the city was in possession of the Wittelsbach Dukes and the eagle was replaced with a lion, {{a symbol of the}} old Bavarian and Palatine Wittelsbachs since the Fiefdom of Duke Ludwig in 1214.|$|E
5|$|The {{primary unit}} of social {{organisation}} in Germanic and Celtic Europe {{of the early}} Middle Ages was the kin group and <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> the case in early Medieval Scotland. The mention of descent through the female line in the ruling families of the Picts in later sources and the recurrence of leaders clearly from outside of Pictish society, {{has led to the}} conclusion that their system of descent was matrilineal. However, this has been challenged by a number of historians who argue that the clear evidence of awareness of descent through the male line suggests that this more likely to indicate an agnatic system of descent, typical of Celtic societies and common throughout North Britain.|$|E
5|$|The {{standard}} {{complement of}} a trireme was 200 men, including 14 marines. In the second Persian invasion of Greece, each Persian ship had carried thirty extra marines, and <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> also true {{in the first}} invasion when the whole invasion force was apparently carried in triremes. Furthermore, the Chian ships at the Battle of Lade also carried 40 marines each. This suggests that a trireme could probably carry a maximum of 4045 soldierstriremes {{seem to have been}} easily destabilised by extra weight. There were therefore probably around 5,000 hoplite marines with the League fleet.|$|E
