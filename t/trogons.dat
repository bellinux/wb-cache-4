5|$|The family Trogonidae {{includes}} the <b>trogons</b> and quetzals. Found in tropical woodlands worldwide, they feed on insects and fruit, and their broad bills and weak legs reflect their diet and arboreal habits. Although their flight is fast, they {{are reluctant to}} fly any distance. <b>Trogons</b> have soft, often colourful, feathers with distinctive male and female plumage.|$|E
5|$|<b>Trogons</b> are {{residents}} of tropical forests worldwide and have soft, often colorful, feathers with distinctive {{male and female}} plumage. They have compact bodies with long tails and short necks.|$|E
5|$|Certain {{bird species}} {{associate}} with the Central American squirrel monkey. The birds follow the monkeys {{in an attempt to}} prey on insects and small vertebrates that the monkeys flush out. At Corcovado National Park, bird species known to regularly follow squirrel monkeys include the double-toothed kite, the grey-headed tanager and the tawny-winged woodcreeper, but other woodcreepers and such species as motmots and <b>trogons</b> do so as well. This activity increases during the wet season, when arthropods are harder to find.|$|E
50|$|The Chocó <b>trogon</b> (<b>Trogon</b> comptus), {{also known}} as the white-eyed <b>trogon</b> or blue-tailed <b>trogon,</b> is a species of bird in the family Trogonidae.It is found in humid lowland forest in western Colombia and {{north-western}} Ecuador.|$|R
5000|$|The black-throated <b>trogon,</b> {{also known}} as [...] yellow-bellied <b>trogon,</b> (<b>Trogon</b> rufus) is a near {{passerine}} bird in the <b>trogon</b> family, Trogonidae. Although it is also called [...] "yellow-bellied trogon" [...] {{it is not the}} only <b>trogon</b> with a yellow belly. It breeds in lowlands from Honduras south to western Ecuador and northern Argentina.|$|R
50|$|The gartered <b>trogon</b> (<b>Trogon</b> caligatus), {{also known}} as the {{northern}} violaceous <b>trogon,</b> is a near passerine bird in the <b>trogon</b> family, Trogonidae. It is found in forests in east-central Mexico, south through Central America, to north-western South America (west or north of the Andes in Colombia, Ecuador and Venezuela). It was formerly treated as a subspecies of the violaceous <b>trogon.</b>|$|R
25|$|<b>Trogons</b> feed principally on insects, other arthropods, and fruit; to {{a lesser}} extent some small {{vertebrates}} such as lizards are taken. Among the insect prey taken one of the more important types are caterpillars; along with cuckoos, <b>trogons</b> {{are one of the few}} birds groups to regularly prey upon them. Some caterpillars are known to be poisonous to <b>trogons</b> though, like Arsenura armida. The extent to which each food type is taken varies depending on geography and species. The three African <b>trogons</b> are exclusively insectivorous, whereas the Asian and American genera consume varying amounts of fruit. Diet is somewhat correlated with size, with larger species feeding more on fruit and smaller species focusing on insects.|$|E
25|$|They feed on {{insects and}} fruit, and their broad bills and weak legs reflect their diet and {{arboreal}} habits. Although their flight is fast, they {{are reluctant to}} fly any distance. <b>Trogons</b> are generally not migratory, although some species undertake partial local movements. <b>Trogons</b> have soft, often colourful, feathers with distinctive male and female plumage. They are the only type of animal with a heterodactyl toe arrangement. They nest in holes dug into trees or termite nests, laying 2–4 white or pastel-coloured eggs.|$|E
25|$|The {{position}} of the <b>trogons</b> within the class Aves has been a long-standing mystery. A variety of relations have been suggested, including the parrots, cuckoos, toucans, jacamars and puffbirds, rollers, owls and nightjars. More recent morphological and molecular evidence has suggested {{a relationship with the}} Coliiformes. The unique arrangement of the toes on the foot (see morphology and flight) has led many to consider the <b>trogons</b> to have no close relatives, and to place them in their own order, possibly with the similarly atypical mousebirds as their closest relatives.|$|E
5000|$|DNA {{studies have}} shown that the {{mountain}} <b>trogon</b> is part of the [...] "Elegant" [...] sub-clade of the genus Trogon—along with the elegant <b>trogon,</b> the collared <b>trogon,</b> the black-throated <b>trogon</b> and the masked trogon—but have not revealed which species are its closest relatives.|$|R
50|$|The {{northern}} Surucua <b>trogon</b> (<b>Trogon</b> aurantius) is {{a species}} of bird in the family Trogonidae formerly considered conspecific with the southern Surucua <b>trogon</b> (<b>Trogon</b> surrucura). It is endemic to eastern Brazil where it found between Salvador in the north, and Sao Paulo in the south.|$|R
50|$|The Surucua <b>trogon</b> (<b>Trogon</b> surrucura) is {{a species}} of bird in the family Trogonidae. It is found in humid forest and nearby {{habitats}} in south-eastern Brazil, eastern Paraguay and far north-eastern Argentina. It includes two subspecies; the southern nominate subspecies with a red belly and the northern aurantius with an orange-yellow belly. The latter has sometimes been considered a separate species, the Brazilian <b>trogon</b> (<b>Trogon</b> aurantius). The name orange-bellied <b>trogon</b> has also been suggested, but this leads to confusion with the Central American <b>Trogon</b> aurantiiventris.|$|R
25|$|Prey {{is almost}} always {{obtained}} on the wing. The most commonly employed foraging technique is a sally-glean flight, where a trogon flies from an observation perch to a target on another branch or in foliage. Once there the birds hovers or stalls and snatches the item before returning to its perch to consume the item. This type of foraging is commonly used by some types of bird to obtain insect prey; in <b>trogons</b> and quetzals it {{is also used to}} pluck fruit from trees. Insect prey may also be taken on the wing, with the trogon pursuing flying insects in a similar manner to drongos and Old World flycatchers. Frogs, lizards and large insects on the ground may also be pounced on from the air. More rarely some <b>trogons</b> may shuffle along a branch to obtain insects, insect eggs and very occasionally nestling birds. Violaceous <b>trogons</b> will consume wasps and wasp larvae encountered while digging nests.|$|E
25|$|Red-headed <b>trogons</b> {{are most}} {{active in the}} early hours of the morning and at night, when they fly on the edges of forest clearings in pursuit of flying moths.|$|E
25|$|The {{family had}} been thought to have an Old World origin {{notwithstanding}} the current richness of the family, which is more diverse in the Neotropical New World. DNA evidence seemed to support an African origin for the <b>trogons,</b> with the African genus Apaloderma seemingly basal in the family, {{and the other two}} lineages, the Asian and American, breaking off between 20–36 million years ago. More recent studies show that the DNA evidence gives contradictory results concerning the basal phylogenetic relationships; so it is currently unknown if all extant <b>trogons</b> are descended from an African or an American ancestor or neither.|$|E
50|$|The Sumatran <b>trogon</b> (Apalharpactes mackloti) is {{a species}} of bird in the family Trogonidae. It was {{formerly}} considered conspecific with the Javan <b>trogon</b> under the common name blue-tailed <b>trogon.</b>|$|R
50|$|The green-backed <b>trogon</b> (<b>Trogon</b> viridis), {{also known}} as the Amazonian white-tailed <b>trogon,</b> is a near {{passerine}} bird in the <b>trogon</b> family. It is found in tropical humid forests in South America, where its range includes the Amazon, the Guiana Shield, Trinidad, and the Atlantic Forest in eastern Brazil. It formerly included T. chionurus of the Chocó region as a subspecies, but under the common name white-tailed <b>trogon</b> (a name now reserved for T. chionurus).|$|R
50|$|The white-tailed <b>trogon</b> (<b>Trogon</b> chionurus) is a near {{passerine}} {{bird in the}} <b>trogon</b> family. It {{is found}} in tropical humid forests of the Chocó, ranging from Panama, through western Colombia, to western Ecuador. It was formerly considered a subspecies of T. viridis, which is widespread in South America east of the Andes, but under the English name white-tailed <b>trogon</b> (a name now reserved for T. chionurus, leaving T. viridis as the green-backed <b>trogon).</b>|$|R
25|$|Red-headed <b>trogons</b> can {{most often}} be found {{perched on a}} shaded branch waiting for prey, alone or in pairs. Flight between trees is often {{sluggish}} and very low, only a few meters above the ground.|$|E
25|$|The {{calls of}} <b>trogons</b> are {{generally}} loud and uncomplex, consisting of monosyllabic hoots and whistles delivered in varying patterns and sequences. The calls of the quetzals {{and the two}} Caribbean genera are the most complex. Among the Asian genera the Sumatran trogon (Apalharpactes) has the most atypical call of any trogon, research has not yet established whether the closely related Javan trogon has a similar call. The calls of the other Asian genus, Harpactes, are remarkably uniform. In addition to the territorial and breeding calls given by males and females during the breeding seasons, <b>trogons</b> have been recorded as having aggression calls given by competing males and alarm calls.|$|E
25|$|<b>Trogons</b> are cavity nesters. Nests are {{dug into}} rotting wood or termite nests, with one species, the violaceous trogon, nesting in wasp nests. Nest {{cavities}} {{can either be}} deep upward slanting tubes that lead to fully enclosed chambers, or much shallower open niches (from which the bird is visible). Nests are dug with the beak, incidentally giving the family its name. Nest digging may be undertaken by the male alone or by both sexes. In the case of nests dug into tree trunks, the wood must be strong enough not to collapse but soft enough to dig out. <b>Trogons</b> have been observed landing on dead tree trunks and slapping the wood with their tails, presumably to test the firmness.|$|E
5000|$|The elegant <b>trogon</b> (<b>Trogon</b> elegans) (formerly the [...] "coppery-tailed" [...] <b>trogon),</b> is a near {{passerine}} {{bird in the}} <b>trogon</b> family. Along {{with the}} eared quetzal, {{it is the most}} poleward-occurring species of <b>trogon</b> in the world, ranging from Guatemala in the south as far north as the upper Gila River in Arizona and New Mexico. The most northerly populations of subspecies ambiguus are partially migratory, and the species is occasionally found as a vagrant in southeasternmost and western Texas.|$|R
2500|$|The {{red-headed}} <b>trogon</b> is {{on average}} [...] in length. The male has a red head and breast, a unique {{feature in the}} <b>Trogon</b> group. The female resembles the Diard’s <b>trogon</b> without a speckled undertail.|$|R
50|$|The black-tailed <b>trogon</b> (<b>Trogon</b> melanurus) is {{a species}} of bird in the family Trogonidae. It is found in humid forest in the Amazon basin, {{north-western}} South America and adjacent Panama. The taxon mesurus from western Ecuador and far north-western Peru was formerly considered a subspecies of the black-tailed <b>trogon,</b> but is now considered a separate species, the Ecuadorian <b>trogon.</b>|$|R
25|$|<b>Trogons</b> are {{generally}} sedentary, with no species known to undertake long migrations. A {{small number of}} species are known to make smaller migratory movements, particularly montane species which move to lower altitudes during different seasons. This has been demonstrated using radio tracking in the resplendent quetzal in Costa Rica and evidence has been accumulated {{for a number of}} other species. The Narina trogon of Africa is thought to undertake some localised short distance migrations over parts of its range, for example birds of Zimbabwe's plateau savannah depart after the breeding season. A complete picture of these movements is however lacking. <b>Trogons</b> are difficult to study as their thick tarsi (feet bones) make ringing studies difficult.|$|E
25|$|Red-headed <b>trogons</b> feed {{primarily}} on insects and their larvae {{found in the}} foliage, on tree branches or in mid air. They also eat leaves and fruits. Some food items include green orthopterans, stick-insects, cicadas, millipedes, flies, beetles, centipedes, woodlice and moths.|$|E
25|$|<b>Trogons</b> are {{residents}} of tropical forests worldwide. The greatest diversity {{is in the}} Neotropics, where four genera, containing 24 species occur. The genus Apaloderma contains the three African species. The genera Harpactes and Apalharpactes, containing twelve species, are found in southeast Asia.|$|E
50|$|The {{collared}} <b>trogon</b> (<b>Trogon</b> collaris) is a near passerine {{bird in the}} <b>trogon</b> family, Trogonidae. It {{is found}} in the warmer parts of the Neotropics and includes numerous subspecies, including T. c. exoptatus from northern Colombia, northern Venezuela and Trinidad and Tobago. The subspecies T. c. aurantiiventris is recognized by many authorities as a separate species: the orange-bellied <b>trogon.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{red-headed}} <b>trogon</b> is {{on average}} 34 cm in length. The male has a red head and breast, a unique {{feature in the}} <b>Trogon</b> group. The female resembles the Diard’s <b>trogon</b> without a speckled undertail.|$|R
50|$|The slaty-tailed <b>trogon</b> (<b>Trogon</b> massena) is a near {{passerine}} {{bird in the}} <b>trogon</b> family, Trogonidae. It breeds in lowlands from southeastern Mexico south through Central America, to Colombia, and a small {{region of}} northwestern Ecuador.|$|R
25|$|The {{earliest}} Paleogene fauna of any diversity, over 30 species, {{including some}} near complete, some preserved in 3-D, and some excellent bird-fossils (even with feathers and chromatine). Most are earliest known representatives of their ‘orders’ (e.g. <b>Trogons,</b> Swifts, Ibises) {{and all are}} terrestrial birds.|$|E
25|$|Geographical {{strengths}} include North America, especially Florida, and the Neotropics, {{with smaller}} but notable numbers of recordings from Africa, Australia, and Southeast Asia. Some taxonomic groups especially well represented are tinamous, <b>trogons,</b> woodpeckers, antbirds, New World flycatchers, wrens, New World wood warblers, and corvids.|$|E
25|$|Several {{bird species}} {{including}} <b>trogons,</b> puffbirds and parakeets also form nests in termite nests. These {{can be distinguished}} from those made by bats as they have a horizontal entrance whereas those made by bats have a vertical entrance {{at the base of}} the nest.|$|E
50|$|The {{song of the}} green-backed <b>trogon</b> {{consists}} of about 20 cow notes that start slow, but accelerate towards the end. The song is slower than the white-tailed <b>trogon,</b> and higher pitched than the black-tailed <b>trogon.</b>|$|R
50|$|The orange-bellied <b>trogon</b> (<b>Trogon</b> aurantiiventris) is {{a species}} of bird in the family Trogonidae. It has been {{considered}} a morph of the collared <b>trogon,</b> but most maintain {{its status as a}} separate species. It is found in Costa Rica and Panama.|$|R
50|$|The lattice-tailed <b>trogon</b> (<b>Trogon</b> clathratus) is {{a species}} of bird in the family Trogonidae.It is found in Costa Rica and Panama.|$|R
