For example, at an exhibition held in Omaha, Nebraska, on November 20, 1889, Adams played against twenty of <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>players</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> city.

5|$|The Golden Gophers {{have had}} many {{successful}} players {{come through the}} program throughout its history. In {{the early years of}} basketball, when the Gophers had success, they recruited some of <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>players</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> country. George Tuck was a dominant center, and the first All-America for the Gophers in 1905. Frank Lawler was another early star: he led the Big Ten in scoring in 1911 and was also named to the All-America team, and helped the Gophers to a contested conference title.|$|E

5|$|By 1946, Van Buren was {{considered}} one of <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>players</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> league. Before the season, he signed a three-year contract to remain with the Eagles, dispelling rumors that he planned to join the rival All-America Football Conference. He returned just five punts in the 1946 season, but ran one of them back fifty yards for a touchdown against the Boston Yanks in the final game of the year. It was the last punt Van Buren returned in his career. He finished the season with 529 rushing yards, third-most behind leader Bill Dudley of the Pittsburgh Steelers and rookie Pat Harder of the Chicago Cardinals. He was named a first-team All-Pro by the New York Daily News and a second-team All-Pro by the United Press.|$|E
5|$|Regarded {{as one of}} <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>players</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{world in}} his {{position}} during his prime, Evra is a fast, energetic and athletic left back, who, despite his size, is physically strong, and good in the air, which also allows him to be deployed as a centre-back on occasion; {{in addition to his}} physical attributes, he is also comfortable on the ball and adept at getting into attacking positions as a wing-back, where he can deliver crosses to teammates, having functioned as a winger earlier on in his career. An aggressive, tactically intelligent, versatile and hard-working player, he is also renowned for his leadership and tenacity on the pitch. These attributes make him effective both offensively and defensively.|$|E
5|$|Since 1889, Wisden has {{published}} a list of Cricketers of the Year, typically selecting five cricketers that had the greatest impact during the previous English cricket season. However, in the 2000 edition, the editor Matthew Engel recognised that <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>players</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world were typically no longer playing English domestic cricket, and opted to select the Cricketers of the Year based on their performances anywhere in the world. This criterion was applied for the following three years, but in 2004 it reverted to being based on the English season, and a Leading Cricketer in the World was also selected. The recipient of the award is selected by the editor of Wisden, with advice from cricket experts. An Australian, Ricky Ponting {{was chosen as the}} first winner of the award, for scoring 1,503 runs in international cricket, including eleven centuries during 2003.|$|E

5|$|After {{joining the}} Canadian club, Giovinco soon {{established}} himself as one of <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>players</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> MLS. During his first year with the club, he broke several league records, including the record for most combined goals and assists in a single season, also helping Toronto {{to qualify for the}} MLS Cup Playoffs {{for the first time in}} the club's history, and winning himself the MLS Golden Boot, the MLS Newcomer of the Year Award, and the MLS MVP Award. In 2016, he won his first title with Toronto, the 2016 Canadian Championship, and became the club's all-time top goalscorer, helping the club to qualify for the Playoffs once again, reaching the MLS Cup Final. In 2017, he won his second Canadian Championship, winning the George Gross Memorial Trophy for the best player of the competition, and also captured the Supporters' Shield with Toronto.|$|E
5|$|England had Stanley Matthews available, who {{was widely}} {{considered}} one of <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>players</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world at the time, {{but he had not}} played with the English team in the three international matches before the World Cup (in fact, he had joined the team late, having been touring Canada as part of another group of English internationals). As such, the selection committee (consisting entirely of Arthur Drewry, then president of The Football League in England and later the president of FIFA) opted to stay with the team that had just defeated Chile. Matthews would be saved for later, supposedly more difficult, opponents. As there were no substitutes allowed in those days, Matthews watched the game with the other reserves. Incidentally, the England team which toured Canada beat the United States team preparing for the World Cup 1–0 at the Triborough Stadium in New York City on June 19, 10 days before the World Cup match, courtesy of a Johnny Hancocks goal.|$|E
5|$|In November 1949, {{following}} the death of Jimmy Dunne, Paddy Coad reluctantly accepted the position of player-manager having played with the club for almost eight years, in which time he had established himself as one of <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>players</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> League of Ireland. Coad opted for a radical youth policy and {{over the course of his}} first three years in charge, signed virtually the entire schoolboy international side to Rovers. He employed revolutionary training methods with extra emphasis on technical skill and possession which resulted in a fast, passing style of football that contributed significantly to the development of the game in Ireland. In 1954, the club won the League of Ireland for the first time in fifteen years, while Paddy Ambrose finished the season as the team's leading scorer. Led by players like Liam Tuohy and Coad himself, the team known as Coad's Colts proceeded to win two more League titles and two FAI Cups, concluding the golden era of Irish football as one of its most successful teams.|$|E

5|$|As Messi {{evolved into}} one of <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>players</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world, he secured a place in Alfio Basile's {{starting}} line-up, {{as part of a}} team considered favourites to win the 2007 Copa América, held in Venezuela. He set up the game-winning goal of their 4–1 victory over the United States in the opening match, before winning a penalty that led to the game-tying first strike of their 4–2 win in the next match against Colombia. As they had secured their place in the knockout phase, Messi started the next game on the bench, coming on in the last 25 minutes with the score at 0–0 to help his team defeat Paraguay by assisting their only goal. At the quarter-final stage, where the group winners faced Peru, he scored the second goal of a 4–0 victory that saw them through to the semi-final, during which he chipped the ball over Mexico's goalkeeper to ensure another 3–0 win. In a surprise defeat, Argentina lost the final 3–0 to a Brazil squad which lacked several of the nation's best players. Their unexpected loss was followed by much criticism in Argentina, though Messi was mostly exempt due to his young age and secondary status to star player Juan Román Riquelme. He was named the best young player of the tournament by CONMEBOL.|$|E
5|$|At club level, Buffon's {{professional}} career began with Parma in 1995, {{where he made}} his Serie A debut, and was soon promoted {{to the role of}} starting goalkeeper, earning {{a reputation as one of}} the most promising young goalkeepers in Italy; during his time with the club, he won the Coppa Italia, the UEFA Cup and the Supercoppa Italiana, all in 1999. After joining Juventus in 2001, Buffon immediately won Serie A titles in both of his first two seasons at the club, and established himself as one of <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>players</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world in his position. After winning two more consecutive league titles in 2005 and 2006, the club were later stripped of these titles and relegated due to their involvement in the 2006 Italian football scandal. Despite rumours of his departure, Buffon remained with Juventus, contributing to the club's Serie B title and promotion back to Serie A in 2007. Following several trophyless seasons, Buffon later played a key role in Juventus' resurgence, which saw the club win an Italian record of six consecutive league titles between 2011 and 2017; he also inherited the captain's armband following the departure of Alessandro Del Piero in 2012. In total, he has won a record eight Serie A titles, as well as three Coppa Italia titles, and five Supercoppa Italiana titles with Juventus.|$|E
