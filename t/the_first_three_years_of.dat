5|$|Designed in {{the early}} 1930s, {{it was one of}} the three main Luftwaffe bomber types used in <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>three</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> the war. The Do 17 made its combat debut in 1937 during the Spanish Civil War, {{operating}} in the Condor Legion in various roles. Along with the Heinkel He 111 it was the main bomber type of the German air arm in 1939–1940. The Dornier was used throughout the early war, and saw action in significant numbers in every major campaign theatre as a front line aircraft until the end of 1941, when its effectiveness and usage was curtailed as its bomb load and range were limited.|$|E
5|$|Fort Runyon {{was named}} for Brig. Gen. Theodore Runyon, a native of New Jersey who {{commanded}} {{one of the first}} brigades of volunteers from that state.

5|$|In taking office, Morales {{emphasized}} nationalism, anti-imperialism, and anti-neoliberalism, although did {{not initially}} refer to his administration as socialist. In what was widely termed a populist act, he immediately reduced both his own presidential wage {{and that of}} his ministers by 57% to $1,875 a month, also urging members of Congress to do the same. Morales gathered together a largely inexperienced cabinet made up of indigenous activists and leftist intellectuals, although over <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>three</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> government there was a rapid turnover in the cabinet as Morales replaced many of the indigenous members with trained middle-class leftist politicians. By 2012 only 3 of the 20 cabinet members identified as indigenous.|$|E

However, during the 3rd ceremony held in 1930, only one of those films was cited in each winner's final award, even though each of the acting winners had two films following their names on the ballots.|$|E
5|$|Lübeck {{served with}} the High Seas Fleet for {{the first decade of}} her career, and after the {{outbreak}} of World War I in August 1914, she was transferred to the Baltic Sea to defend Germany's coast from potential Russian attacks. She saw extensive service in <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>three</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> the war, during which time she participated in the seizure of Libau and was attacked by Allied submarines on two occasions. She struck a mine in 1916 but was repaired; in 1917, she was withdrawn for secondary duties. She survived the war, and was ceded to the British as a war prize in 1920, and subsequently broken up for scrap.|$|E

5|$|M-204 runs {{across the}} Leelanau Peninsula between Leland and Suttons Bay {{in the northwestern}} Lower Peninsula of the US state of Michigan. The {{trunkline}} runs through a rural section of Leelanau County, connecting two villages with the county seat. Originally a gravel road in 1933, it was later paved within <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>three</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> existence. Segments were realigned to straighten curves in the late 1930s and early 1970s near the villages of Lake Leelanau and Suttons Bay.|$|E
5|$|During <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>three</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> the Second World War, Coastal Command and the Admiralty {{fought a}} battle with the RAF and Air Ministry over the primacy of trade defence, in {{relation}} to the bomber effort against mainland Germany, a strategic tussle which conceivably could have cost the Western Alliance the Battle of the Atlantic. The Air Staff and Bomber Command enjoyed the backing of Churchill and the maritime air effort struggled to receive the recognition it needed. On the outbreak of war, the order of battle listed just 298 aircraft, of which only 171 were operational. On 15 February 1941, Coastal Command was placed under the operational control of the Admiralty. Instrumental in improving the strike rate against submarines was scientific advisor and assistant director of research E. J. Williams, who applied scientific analysis to the logistical problems to great effect. Williams was present at some meetings of the Cabinet Anti-U-boat Committee at 10 Downing Street, under the chairmanship of the Prime Minister.|$|E
5|$|Greek naval {{plans were}} {{interrupted}} by the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, however. Work halted on Vasilefs Konstantinos in August and on Salamis in December 1914. As a result, Kilkis and Lemnos were the only battleships delivered to Greece. Greece remained neutral for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>three</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> World War I, though in October 1916, France seized the Greek Navy and disarmed both of the battleships. They remained inactive {{for the rest of}} the war. Both ships saw service in 19191922 during the GrecoTurkish War. They continued to serve with the fleet until the early 1930s, when they were reduced to secondary roles. Lemnos became a barracks ship while Kilkis became a training ship. During the German invasion of Greece in April 1941, both ships were attacked and sunk in Salamis by Ju 87 Stuka dive-bombers. The two old battleships were scrapped after the end of the war.|$|E

5|$|In July 1914, World War I {{broke out}} in Europe; the United States {{remained}} neutral for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>three</b> <b>years</b> <b>of</b> the war. Tensions with Germany {{came to a head}} in early 1917 following the German unrestricted submarine warfare campaign, which sank several American merchant ships in European waters. On 6 April 1917, the United States declared war on Germany. The Connecticut-class ships initially were used for training gunners and engine room personnel that would be necessary for the rapidly expanding wartime fleet. In June 1918, New Hampshire and Louisiana were involved in a serious gunnery accident, where gunners aboard the former accidentally hit the latter, killing one and injuring several other men. The following month, Louisiana was used to test Arthur Pollen's Argo Clock, the first fire control system to use an analog computer to calculate firing solutions.|$|E

The Virginia-class ships initially were used for training gunners and engine room personnel that would be necessary for the rapidly expanding wartime fleet. Starting in September 1918, the ships began to be used as escorts for convoys bringing soldiers to France, though this duty was cut short by the Armistice with Germany signed in November. With the war over, the Virginias were used to ferry American soldiers back from France through mid-1919.|$|E
5|$|In October 1914, the Imperial Service Cavalry Brigade {{was moved}} by sea to Egypt {{to become part of}} the Force in Egypt {{defending}} the Suez Canal.

It was not until November 1917 as part of the Egyptian Expeditionary Force that the Imperial Service Cavalry Brigade was involved in the Third Battle of Gaza. The following year the brigade joined the 5th Cavalry Division when it became the 15th (Imperial Service) Cavalry Brigade and played an active role in the British victory over Turkish forces in Palestine.|$|E
