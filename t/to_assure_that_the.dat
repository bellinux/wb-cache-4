5|$|As an American, and {{therefore}} a citizen of a neutral country, Heineman used his contacts abroad to find overseas sources of food which might be shipped to Belgium to resupply the populace. Food from abroad being the only viable immediate solution to Belgium's food shortage, the Committee's chief initial difficulty was obtaining {{the permission of the}} British and German governments to import food and in providing guarantees {{that it would not be}} used for military purposes. The CNSA was also supported in its early activities by Charles de Broqueville's Belgian government in exile. The logistical problems involved in coordinating the huge shipments of food to Belgium meant that the CNSA began to look for foreign assistance in procuring and transporting material to Belgium. Francqui used his personal acquaintance with Herbert Hoover, future President of the United States, to create an external body to assist the management of the CNSA. Hoover became the director of the Commission for Relief in Belgium (CRB), and led successful attempts to raise money abroad in order to improve the humanitarian situation in Belgium. Because the CRB was officially an American organization, the CRB was also necessary <b>to</b> <b>assure</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> food, once delivered to the CNSA, was not immediately seized by the Germans. The CRB also provided the international support necessary to convince the British government to permit the shipments. Once received, the food and material from the CRB was distributed through the CNSA's network of 125,000 agents across the country.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} envisioned {{to improve the}} core {{mechanics}} of Red Dead Revolver (2004), to which Redemption is a spiritual successor, by scaling {{it up to the}} standard of other Rockstar games. The fundamental goal for the game was to maintain the shooting mechanic and expand on other game features; like Revolver, the game's weapons were inspired by real weaponry. Carson explained that the team attempted to achieve realism with every feature of the game, including the horses, lassos, animal ecosystem, and the open world. <b>To</b> <b>assure</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> horse movements were as realistic as possible, the team motion captured a stunt horse, recording all movement. This created various problems; a gesture used by the stunt rider to communicate with the production team while on the horse was also the same command that made the horse rear. Furthermore, creating the horse's skeletal and muscular systems also presented a problem, and took several years to overcome. In the early stages of development, Rockstar decided which elements from Red Dead Revolver could be carried over; beyond the Dead Eye feature and the Western setting, very few other features remained. While Revolver represented many myths and iconic images of the American frontier, in Redemption the team tried to represent the reality of the time period. The tone of Redemption was aimed to be a combination of the primitive Wild West and early 20th century America; with the latter, America was developing into a modern and contemporary society, which the team tried to portray. In addition, while they felt that Revolver was constrained by its level-based structure, the team saw potential in creating a game similar to that of Rockstar's Grand Theft Auto series, in terms of quality, scope and detail.|$|E

Under this condition, the hybrid needed to be 74 percent closer than the conventional car before the subjects could hear from which direction the cars approached. Subjects could correctly judge the approach of the combustion car when it was about [...] feet away.

2500|$|Standard {{excision}} {{is still}} being done by most surgeons. Unfortunately, the recurrence rate is exceedingly high (up to 50%).
