5|$|The {{asteroid}} belt occupies the orbit between Mars and Jupiter, between 2.3 and 3.3AU from the Sun. It {{is thought to}} be remnants from the Solar System's formation that failed to coalesce because of the gravitational interference of Jupiter. The {{asteroid belt}} contains tens of thousands, possibly millions, of objects over one kilometre in diameter. Despite this, the total mass of the asteroid belt is unlikely {{to be more than a}} thousandth of that of Earth. The asteroid belt is very sparsely populated; spacecraft routinely pass <b>through</b> <b>without</b> incident.|$|E
5|$|In Time Trials, {{the player}} can freely race {{on a course}} to perform the best times, which are {{recorded}} in the game's data. In the Stunt Mode, the player must earn points by executing stunts and passing through rings. The points depend upon how many rings the player passes <b>through</b> <b>without</b> missing, {{as well as the}} class of stunt that has been performed. The multiplayer mode uses a horizontal split-screen and allows two players to compete against each other on a chosen course. Only the courses that have been unlocked in the Championship mode can be played in the Time Trials, Stunt, and multiplayer modes. The game offers four personalized racers for players to select from, each having their own strengths and weaknesses. A Nintendo 64 Controller Pak can be used to transfer saved data from one game cartridge to another.|$|E
5|$|The {{official}} synopsis {{for both}} films {{was published in}} The Moving Picture World on January 14, 1911. The first film, Everybody Saves Father is focused on Jennie Gear, a young woman whose affections are sought by many men. Jennie's father thinks his daughter is {{too young to be}} married and drives off four of her suitors. One of the men, John, concocts a plan to save his life to win the man's approval. The plan is heard by another suitor, George, who decides to hire a rowboat to save the old man himself. This is over heard by George who concocts his own rescue to foil George. The plans go <b>through</b> <b>without</b> failure as each successive suitor's plan works to the actions of the other, and Henry wins the approval of Jennie's father. However, Jennie had already married Bill in the mean time.|$|E

5|$|Titanium is {{non-toxic}} even {{in large}} doses {{and does not}} play any natural role inside the human body. An estimated quantity of 0.8 milligrams of titanium is ingested by humans each day, but most passes <b>through</b> <b>without</b> being absorbed in the tissues. It does, however, sometimes bio-accumulate in tissues that contain silica. One study indicates a possible connection between titanium and yellow nail syndrome. An unknown mechanism in plants may use titanium to stimulate the production of carbohydrates and encourage growth. This may explain why most plants contain about 1 part per million (ppm) of titanium, food plants have about 2 ppm, and horsetail and nettle contain up to 80 ppm.|$|E
5|$|With Weir (Torri Higginson) incapacitated, Sheppard (Joe Flanigan) {{is forced}} to take command of Atlantis. McKay (David Hewlett) determines that the power {{conduits}} are damaged, preventing Atlantis from completing its jump to the planet M12-578. While teams are sent to patch them up, the shield starts to collapse, resulting {{in the deaths of}} one team. McKay later decides to collapse the shield to cover the central tower in order to conserve power, and give Zelenka (David Nykl) time to patch up the conduits. However, the city approaches an asteroid belt, {{and the only way to}} go <b>through</b> <b>without</b> using up the power is for Sheppard to lead a fleet of Puddle Jumpers and clear a path. Although inexperienced, the pilots succeed, but impacts from the stragglers damage the stardrive control crystals, and they have to fix it before jumping again.|$|E
5|$|The {{relief efforts}} were {{hindered}} by {{the composition of}} the mud, which made it nearly impossible to move <b>through</b> <b>without</b> becoming stuck. By the time relief workers reached Armero twelve hours after the eruption, many of the victims with serious injuries were dead. The relief workers were horrified by the landscape of fallen trees, disfigured human bodies, and piles of debris from entire houses. This was the second-deadliest volcanic disaster of the 20th century, surpassed only by the 1902 eruption of Mount Pelée, and is the fourth-deadliest volcanic event recorded since 1500 AD. The event was a foreseeable catastrophe exacerbated by the populace's unawareness of the volcano's destructive history; geologists and other experts had warned authorities and media outlets about the danger over the weeks and {{days leading up to the}} eruption. Hazard maps for the vicinity were prepared, but poorly distributed. On the day of the eruption, several evacuation attempts were made, but a severe storm restricted communications. Many victims stayed in their houses as they had been instructed, believing that the eruption had ended. The noise from the storm may have prevented many from hearing the sounds from Ruiz until it was too late.|$|E

25|$|The size of interdental brushes is {{standardized}} in ISO 16409. The brush size, {{which is}} a number between 0 (small space between teeth) and 8 (large space), indicates the passage hole diameter. This corresponds to the space between two teeth that is just sufficient for the brush to go <b>through</b> <b>without</b> bending the wire. The color of the brushes differs between producers. The same {{is the case with}} respect to the wire diameter.|$|E
25|$|Legislation is scrutinised by select {{committees}}.

The strengthening of the committee system was in response to concerns that legislation was being forced <b>through,</b> <b>without</b> receiving due examination and revision. Each select committee has a chairperson and a deputy chairperson. MPs may be members of more than one select committee.|$|E

25|$|This {{relationship}} {{means that}} certain key features {{can be observed}} in both drum membrane modes and atomic orbitals. For example, in all of the modes analogous to sorbitals (the top row in the animated illustration below), {{it can be seen that}} the very center of the drum membrane vibrates most strongly, corresponding to the antinode in all sorbitals in an atom. This antinode means the electron is most likely to be at the physical position of the nucleus (which it passes straight <b>through</b> <b>without</b> scattering or striking it), since it is moving (on average) most rapidly at that point, giving it maximal momentum.|$|E
25|$|On April 5, the IV Corps of Brig. Gen. Erasmus D. Keyes made {{initial contact}} with Confederate {{defensive}} works at Lee's Mill, an area McClellan expected to move <b>through</b> <b>without</b> resistance. Magruder's ostentatious movement of troops {{back and forth}} convinced the Union that his works were strongly held. As the two armies fought an artillery duel, reconnaissance indicated to Keyes the strength and breadth of the Confederate fortifications, and he advised McClellan against assaulting them. McClellan ordered the construction of siege fortifications and brought his heavy siege guns to the front. In the meantime, Gen. Joseph E. Johnston brought reinforcements for Magruder.|$|E
25|$|UV {{disinfection}} is {{most effective}} for treating high-clarity, purified reverse osmosis distilled water. Suspended particles are a problem because microorganisms buried within particles are shielded from the UV light and pass through the unit unaffected. However, UV systems can be coupled with a pre-filter to remove those larger organisms that would otherwise pass through the UV system unaffected. The pre-filter also clarifies the water to improve light transmittance and therefore UV dose throughout the entire water column. Another key factor of UV water treatment is the flow rate—if the flow is too high, water will pass <b>through</b> <b>without</b> sufficient UV exposure. If the flow is too low, heat may build up and damage the UV lamp.|$|E

25|$|The Port of New York Authority {{opposed the}} plan, preferring a more forward-looking {{comprehensive}} freight distribution plan. They attacked Miller {{as trying to}} push the plan <b>through</b> <b>without</b> input from the Port Authority. The Port Authority wanted a system of inland terminals and belt-line railroads. According to Port Authority Chairman Julian Gregory, it was almost certain that NYCRR would not {{go along with the}} Port Authority plan. It was also believed that giving NYCRR elevated tracks on the west side would allow the railroad to monopolize freight and raise prices. The Port Authority believed it was primarily a freight problem, but NYCRR and New York City considered it to be a grade-crossing elimination project.|$|E
25|$|Some {{criticisms of}} the {{amendment}} related merely to {{the manner in which}} it was proposed. Some argued that the amendment had been rushed <b>through</b> <b>without</b> proper debate and consultation. Because the constitutional right to citizenship had been introduced as part of the Good Friday Agreement it was argued that there should have been consultation with Northern Ireland political parties. In the lead-up to the referendum the Irish and British governments issued a joint statement saying that they did not regard the proposed constitutional change as affecting the British-Irish Agreement (this being the inter-governmental component of the Good Friday Agreement). The Democratic Unionist Party cited the amendment as evidence that the Agreement could be changed.|$|E
25|$|Elsewhere in Europe, {{the success}} of {{high-speed}} services has been {{due in part to}} interoperability with existing normal rail lines. Interoperability between the new AVE lines and the older Iberian gauge network presents additional challenges. Both Talgo and CAF supply trains with variable gauge wheels operated by automatic gauge-changer equipment which the trains pass <b>through</b> <b>without</b> stopping (Alvias). Some lines are being constructed as dual gauge to allow trains with Iberian and UIC gauge to run on the same tracks. Other lines have been re-equipped with sleepers for both Iberian and UIC gauge, such that the track can be converted from Iberian to UIC gauge at a later time without changing the sleepers.|$|E
