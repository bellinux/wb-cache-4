The descriptions would sometimes be accompanied by unusual behavior such as specific fears, and the children might have a birthmark the same shape as wounds on the body of the deceased person whose life was purportedly being recalled. The children claiming to have lived before might exhibit special skills, such as playing an instrument or speaking a language they appeared not to have learned.|$|E
500|$|... "The Silence" [...] {{is a song}} by British singer Alexandra Burke {{from her}} debut studio album Overcome (2009). The song was written by Bilal Hajji and Savan Kotecha, along with the song's {{producer}} Nadir [...] "RedOne" [...] Khayat. The song was released as a promotional single {{in anticipation of the}} re-release of Overcome (2010). Burke stated that the song was written when her aunt told the singer about how she and her partner were experiencing troubles in their relationship, and that they were not telling each other how they felt. In response, Burke asked her aunt why he was letting the silence in their relationship do the talking instead of them discussing it. [...] "The Silence" [...] is an R and pop-influenced power ballad and instrumentation consists of a piano, a guitar and drums. The lyrics of the song feature the protagonist asking why the other person in the relationship remains silent about their difficulties instead of <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E

2500|$|In 1874, {{people in}} New York, Pennsylvania, and {{elsewhere}} in the United States would start a conversation with [...] "Have you seen Tom Collins?" [...] After the listener predictably reacts by explaining {{that they did not know}} a Tom Collins, the speaker would assert that Tom Collins was talking about the listener to others and that Tom Collins was [...] "just around the corner", [...] "in a [...] bar," [...] or somewhere else near. The conversation about the nonexistent Tom Collins was a proven hoax of exposure. In The Great Tom Collins hoax of 1874, as it became known, the speaker would encourage the listener to act foolishly by reacting to patent nonsense that the hoaxer deliberately presents as reality. In particular, the speaker desired the listener to become [...] at the idea of someone <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>them</b> to others such that the listener would rush off to find the purportedly nearby Tom Collins. Similar to the New York Zoo hoax of 1874, several newspapers propagated the very successful practical joke by printing stories containing false sightings of Tom Collins. The 1874 hoax quickly gained such notoriety that several 1874 music hall songs memorialized the event (copies of which now are in the U.S. Library of Congress).|$|E
2500|$|Subsequent to the interinclusion of the 10 sefirot {{within each}} other, in Lurianic Kabbalah they then develop into [...] "partzufim" [...] ("personas"). Wide {{discussion}} of the partzufim {{is found in the}} Medieval Kabbalah of the Zohar, before Isaac Luria. In the Zohar, Shimon bar Yochai expounds upon the spiritual roles of the partzufim, by <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>them</b> as independent spiritual manifestations. [...] "The Holy Ancient of Days", or [...] "The Long Visage", two of the different Parsufim, are not just alternative adjectives for God, but are particular spiritual manifestations, levels and natures. Lurianic Kabbalah focused {{on the role of the}} Parsufim as the fully evolved stage of the primordial evolution of the sefirot, in the beginning of Creation. Instead of each of the 10 sefirot merely including a full subset of 10 sefirot as latent potential forces, the first stage of their evolution, in the Parsufim the sefirot become fully autonomous and interrelated. The name of each partzuf denotes that the sefirah from which it derived, has now become an independent scheme of 10 fully functioning sefirot in the [...] "Upright" [...] (Yosher) form of [...] "Man". This reconfiguration is essential in Lurianic Kabbalah to enable the opposing spiritual forces of the sefirot to work together in harmony. Each Parsuf now operates independently, and unites with the other Parsufim. So, for example, [...] "The Long Visage" [...] is said to descend, and become enclothed within the lower Parsufim. The sefirot now harmonise, to enable the Lurianic scheme of Tikkun (Rectification) to begin. The names of the fundamental partzufim and their English translations: ...|$|E

2500|$|Many critics {{considered}} the song a [...] "diss" [...] towards Lil' Kim, [...] {{who has been}} in disputes with Minaj since the beginning of her career.

Minaj also subliminally took jabs at rapper Keys with [...] "I see them dusty ass Filas, Levi's/ Raggedy Ann's/ Holes in your knee highs".
