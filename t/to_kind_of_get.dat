2500|$|Regarding the album's title, Welch told MTV News, [...] "It {{was an art}} {{installation}} done in the '70s, {{this video}} piece all done on Super 8, this big procession of kind of coquette-style hippies and all these different colored robes and masks, {{and it was all}} to do with color, really saturated, brightly colored pastas and balloons. I saw it a couple years ago, and it was called 'Ceremonials' and then, like, Roman numerals after it. And the word sort of stuck with me, and I think the whole idea of performance, and kind of putting on this outfit and going out almost to find some sort of exorcism or absolution, <b>to</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>get</b> outside yourself, there's a sense of ceremony to it." [...] Welch also revealed that she wanted to call the album Violence, stating, [...] "I wanted to make an album that sounded like the soundtrack to Baz Luhrmann's Romeo + Juliet, the violence mixed with the classical Shakespearean drama mixed with the pop and the pulp, extreme neon stuff." [...] In an interview with The Guardian, she described the album as [...] "much bigger" [...] and categorised its genre as [...] "chamber soul", a mixture of chamber pop and soul.

I was not giving advice to the whole world and nor was I counseling anybody to be unscriptural and leave their spouse. ... Please know that I believe the Bible. Please know that I never would tell anybody to leave their sick spouse. I never never would say such a thing because I need my spouse when I get sick and she needs me when she gets sick. In sickness and in health, I believe it!" ...|$|E

Speaking with Mark Kennedy of the Ottawa Citizen, Brosseau spoke about the difficulties she faced during her first years as an MP, but noted, [...] "It took a while <b>to</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>get</b> my feet planted, set up an office, learn what the job was. The negativity only encouraged me to work harder." [...] While the NDP's Quebec caucus was reduced to 16 seats during the election, Brosseau {{was one of the few}} NDP MPs elected in 2011 who not only kept their seats, but also increased their vote share, winning re-election with 42% of the vote (almost 3% more than her first election) and almost 10,000 votes over her nearest opponent.|$|E
2500|$|Christie {{questioned}} {{the policy of}} allowing three dedicated lanes, saying [...] "I didn't know Fort Lee got three dedicated lanes until all this stuff happened, and I think we should review that entire policy.

That <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>gets</b> me sauced [...]" [...] However, members of the New Jersey Assembly Transportation Committee said at a November 25, 2013, hearing that the Fort Lee entrance has been used by an even greater number of commuters from the surrounding Bergen County towns. PA officials, including Patrick Foye, confirmed that assessment in their sworn testimony at the committee hearing on December 9, 2013.|$|R
5000|$|With {{the song}} 'Shake It Off,' I really wanted <b>to</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> {{take back the}} narrative, and {{have more of a}} sense of humor about people who <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>get</b> under my skin — and not let them get under my skin. There's a song that I wrote a couple years ago called [...] "Mean," [...] where I {{addressed}} the same issue but I addressed it very differently. I said, [...] "Why you gotta be so mean?," [...] from <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> a victimized perspective, which is how we all approach bullying or gossip when it happens to us for the first time. But {{in the last few years}} I've gotten better at just <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> laughing off things that absolutely have no bearing on my real life. I think it's important to be self-aware about what people are saying about you, but even more so, be very aware of who you actually are, and to have that be the main priority.|$|R

There are some choices that the writers have made that show the family in a different light, and the way Spencer handles being with women now — because before it was mainly just Ashley. But now she's a gay woman and she's experiencing other women, so you <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> see that part of her. Gabrielle Christian ...|$|R
5000|$|Speaking of her titular title track, Tiffany {{expressed}} [...] "Most girls my age, {{when they}} are stressed or want <b>to</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>get</b> away, they dance the night away. I {{think it should be}} everybody's theme song." [...] Since 2014, Tiffany started writing music, calling it [...] "nerve-wrecking to put out music she’s written on her own." [...] One of her songs, [...] "What Do I Do", made it to the final track list. Although Tiffany participated in both music writing and English lyrics for the track, Girls' Generation member Sooyoung helped write the Korean lyrics. Tiffany also named [...] "Talk" [...] as her favorite track of the album, recalling she was having a [...] "fan girl moment" [...] after finding out its music was written by Girls Aloud's Nicola Roberts.|$|E
5000|$|Crafted {{around a}} track that {{producer}} Chucky Thompson sent Evans {{two years before}} she picked it out, [...] "Mesmerized" [...] was inspired by veteran soul musicians which came to prominence in the 1960s. Speaking on its creation, the singer stated: [...] "I was just going through CDs, and I was like 'How could I have overlooked that?"' I totally wanted to approach it as if Aretha Franklin was singing a James Brown record, so what I did was think, 'I'm like the female James Brown.' Evan's vocal performance was also influenced by Brown's sidekick Lyn Collins. [...] "I put in her CD, just listened to three songs probably. I just wanted <b>to</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>get</b> that attitude without totally redoing a Lyn Collins song or without totally taking her approach to it or her ad-libs. I kept it more on an Aretha vibe with the ad-libs, and the whole attitude, just real gutsy and raw, was inspired by Lyn Collins." ...|$|E
5000|$|In an interview, former Yellowcard lead guitarist Ben Harper {{said that}} [...] "Way Away" [...] is [...] "about our band and facing {{the people who}} didn't believe in what we were doing. That's kind of like an ode to disbelievers." [...] In another interview, vocalist Ryan Key, in {{discussion}} of the song, said: [...] "It's the story we have sort of been through as a band {{in the last couple}} of years, moving from our hometown in Jacksonville, Florida, out to Southern California and starting to tour really hard and just sort of following our dreams. Hopefully other people will take that song and apply it to their own lives and be able <b>to</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>get</b> out of whatever they are stuck in and don't want to be in." [...] Key also revealed that the song was [...] "harder than some of our other songs, whereas 'Ocean Avenue' is kind of in the middle of the spectrum of where the record goes." ...|$|E

Rounding the turn, Logano was racing Ryan Newman to his outside and Denny Hamlin to his inside when Chase Elliott got to his inside, got loose, got into Logano and sent both of them into the wall. Elliott continued spinning down the track into the inside wall. Elliott said he [...] "came off (Turn 1) and those guys were three-wide, I thought Denny had the best run so I elected to push him and I {{thought that would be}} a good move <b>to</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>get</b> him past them and hopefully he would drag me by. I just got next to (Logano) and got in there. I thought I slowed down enough to not get loose, but I got loose and collected him. I apologize to the No. 22 guys - it was completely my fault. I apologized to my guys as well. They gave me a really good car today.” ...|$|E

On 15 December, whilst being interviewed on the RTÉ chat show The Saturday Night Show, she revealed that she had signed a record deal with Sony Music. On 22 January 2013, Henderson confirmed she had signed to Simon Cowell's record label Syco Music. Regarding her decision to sign with Syco, Henderson said, [...] "The most important thing I was looking for was to be involved creatively, and which label presents me with the best team to bring {{the best out of}} me. The fact that Cowell is letting me be involved creatively is overwhelming." [...] In an interview with Digital Spy, Henderson said that, [...] "I wanted each song to explain a situation, and then for the next song <b>to</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>get</b> you through that. I write very openly and lyrically, so it's very much like an open diary. I had to make sure it runs like that.

5000|$|In a 2013 {{interview}} with Rickly, he elaborated on the revolving line-up of United Nations, stating: [...] "The reason that we've been able <b>to</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>get</b> away with playing {{when we want}} to is because we change members and because we've never copyrighted any of the songs to any member. So, it's really hard to say who made what and who was just playing United Nations for a little while. That's something that has protected us — the anonymity of the band, {{the changing nature of}} the band — it's like, 'Well i was only in it for a little while, and then it was these guys, and then it was these guys, and then it was these guys...'" [...] In the same interview, managing editor of Alternative Press Scott Heisel asked Rickly if, because he is the only well-known member of United Nations, he was afraid of taking the full blame for any of the band's controversial or potentially illegal activity. He responded: [...] "I don't feel like many bands take chances anymore. There's {{a lot of talk about}} being punk and revolutionary and this and that, but it's also awfully safe — punk seems awfully safe to me now, so I like the idea of doing something that's actually dangerous." ...|$|E

Generally speaking, a reproducible state of the substrate surface may be obtained using as-received panels which had been stored in air for several weeks before being cleaned or panel surfaces obtained after grinding and exposure in air.

He compares environmental disasters in Montana’s past with catastrophes elsewhere and pens “crackling good yarns” about his findings.
