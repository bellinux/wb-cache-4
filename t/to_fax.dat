A surprise attack by the Delta Force team however, prompts Rachel <b>to</b> <b>fax</b> {{the result of the}} analysis to her father, asking for help. In the ensuing skirmish, all Delta Force soldiers are killed, their helicopter is sunk and Pickering is revealed to be their commander. He tells Rachel about her father's true motivations for becoming President, and that Pickering masterminded the fake meteorite to hurt Senator Sexton's campaign. The ship and Pickering are sucked in by a vortex, while a Coast Guard Osprey picks up Rachel, Tolland and Marlinson.|$|E

When he finally finishes what he believes is a rundown, Charles does not look at it and simply asks Jim <b>to</b> <b>fax</b> it to everyone on the distribution list. Jim {{does not know what}} the distribution list is either, but rather than asking Charles, he simply faxes the rundown to his father.|$|E

500|$|Rove, {{while an}} advisor to Texas Governor George W.

The media took the parallels further than Rove intended, making comparisons between him and Hanna, hinting that Rove controlled Bush like it was said Hanna controlled McKinley. Williams also saw the lasting effect of McKinley's 1896 campaign, [...] "a new approach to campaigning, the educational or merchandising style, continues to mold campaigns today, as does McKinley's focus on message, Hanna's use of money, and Dawes's reliance on efficiency and education... more than a century later, Americans and their political leaders can still learn from the events of the 1890s, whose lessons echo down the years today." ...|$|E
500|$|Initially police {{believed}} that the murder was a drive-by shooting, but investigators discovered a tennis shoe print near the outdoor air conditioning unit, and a yellow business card next to Fischer's body. Though the business card was stained by blood from Corinne's hands after she {{tried to stop the}} bleeding, investigators were able to decipher the wording on the card. It was from the Collin County bail office in McKinney, Texas. A [...] phone number was printed on the card and it had a handwritten area code, 214, from the Dallas area. Alex Perez, the former sheriff of Cameron County, who was appointed to lead the investigation, called the bail office and asked them <b>to</b> <b>fax</b> copies of bond applications made by Rio Grande Valley residents. The police theorized that the assailant had dropped the card after Fischer tried to defend himself. The bail office faxed the police several applications, and included one from Rudy Cuellar, a Dallas resident who often visited Mexico.|$|E
500|$|Steve McFadden and Ross Kemp had {{attempted}} to persuade EastEnders writer Tony Jordan to develop a spin-off for their characters, which would star Windsor as Peggy. The idea never advanced beyond informal discussions, but when the producers decided to reintroduce Peggy, McFadden and Kemp suggested Windsor play her. Windsor had previously {{expressed a desire to}} join the cast of EastEnders. Chat show host Chris Evans of Channel 4's The Big Breakfast made a public broadcast instructing viewers <b>to</b> <b>fax</b> or phone the BBC with pleas for Windsor's instatement. However, Windsor was already in negotiations with the BBC about appearing in the serial. June Deitch, the EastEnders casting director, had met with Windsor to discuss the matter, and was convinced when Windsor declared that she would [...] "like to play my own age for a change". At the time, the producers had already thought about reintroducing Peggy, and Windsor was cast despite originally being considered too [...] "well-known". Windsor has spoken of her [...] "terrified" [...] reaction to being asked to audition, commenting: [...] "I had the weekend to prepare and I cried all the time. I didn't know how to do soap acting. I was so used to using my hands, my eyes." [...] She auditioned with two scenes, one emotion, one [...] "jolly" [...] which Windsor has described as [...] "agony", explaining: [...] "I was afraid of playing Barbara Windsor, so when I had to laugh I went 'huh, huh'. Anything rather than 'tee, hee, hee'." [...] In an interview with the Walford Gazette, a US-based newspaper dedicated to EastEnders, Windsor commented on her casting: [...] "I was thrilled, I could rest my tired bones working on a marvelous television show that I deeply respected. I was very excited about the possibility [...] playing this feisty lady who would come in and shake up her two boys' lives." ...|$|E

2500|$|Originally, H. R. Giger was {{approached}} on July 28, 1990, by David Fincher and Tim Zinnemann, and {{was asked to}} redesign his own creations for Alien 3. Giger's new designs included an aquatic face-hugger and a four-legged version of the adult Alien. Giger {{said in an interview}} [...] "I had special ideas to make it more interesting. I designed a new creature, which was much more elegant and beastly, compared to my original. It was a four-legged Alien, more like a lethal feline – a panther or something. It had a kind of skin that was built up from other creatures – much like a symbiosis." [...] However, when Tom Woodruff and Alec Gillis of Amalgamated Dynamics told Giger that they had their own design, Giger expressed himself as [...] "very upset" [...] and that the creature he had especially designed was his [...] "baby". Even after the production severed contact, Giger continued <b>to</b> <b>fax</b> suggestions to Fincher, and made full-scale drawings and a sculpt of the Alien, all of which were rejected.|$|E

2500|$|The lake also {{supports}} a strong sport fishery. While commercial fishing declined, sport fishing has remained. The deep cool waters that spawn the best fishing {{is in the}} Canadian side of the lake. As a result, a fishing boat that crosses the international border triggers the security concerns of border crossings and fishermen are advised to have their passport. If their boat crosses the invisible border line in the lake, upon returning to the American shore, passengers will have to [...] "drive to a local government reporting station and pose for pictures" [...] to Customs officers by videophone. There are cumbersome rules for fishing boat operators as well, who will have <b>to</b> <b>fax</b> passenger personal information to a government agency an hour before leaving; officers will be watching and doing spot checks from patrol boats and government aircraft". Authorities in 2008 from the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission have tried stocking the lake with brown trout {{in an effort to}} build what's called a put-grow-and-take fishery. There was a report that charter boat fishing increased substantially on the American side, from 46 to 638 charter boats in operation in Ohio alone, during a period from 1975 to 1985 as pollution levels declined, and after populations of walleye increased substantially in the lake. In 1984, Ohio sold 27,000 nonresident fishing permits, and sport fishing was described as big business. In 1992, there were accounts of fishermen catching 8, 10, and 12 pound walleyes, and that the [...] "runt of a five-man daily limit of 25 walleye might be a nuisance of 5 pounds." [...] It is possible to fish off piers in winter for a fish called the burbot, also known by pseudonyms such as eelpout, mudblow, lawyer fish, cusk, or freshwater cod which looks [...] "ugly" [...] but tastes great; the burbot make a midwinter spawning run and is reportedly one of [...] "Erie's glacial relics." ...|$|E
