5|$|At {{first the}} Whitewater River and local washes were {{considered}} {{the primary source}} of these sands, which would have been <b>transported</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Algodones area by longshore drift. This would imply a minimum age of 160,000 years. Later the Colorado River was identified as the main source of these sediments, potentially with some contribution from local drainages. At prevailing winds, most of the sediments from the Colorado would have been <b>transported</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Cerro Prieto area and possibly carried by wind to the Gran Desierto de Altar.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The small GTPase ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF) is {{absolutely}} required for coatomer vesicle formation on Golgi membranes {{but not for}} anterograde <b>transport</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> medial-Golgi in a mammalian in vitro transport system. This might indicate that the in vivo mechanism of intra-Golgi transport is not faithfully reproduced in vitro, or that intra-Golgi transport occurs by a nonvesicular mechanism. As one approach to distinguishing between these possibilities, we have characterized two additional cell-free systems that reconstitute <b>transport</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> trans-Golgi (trans assay) and trans-Golgi network (TGN assay). Like in vitro <b>transport</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> medial-Golgi (medial assay), <b>transport</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> trans-Golgi and TGN requires cytosol, ATP, and N-ethylmaleimide–sensitive fusion protein (NSF) ...|$|R

5|$|In {{the final}} days of the battle, the {{evacuation}} of the Vukovar hospital was negotiated between Croatian authorities, the JNA and the European Community Monitor Mission in cooperation with the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). The JNA subsequently refused the ICRC access to the hospital despite the agreement and removed approximately 300 people from its premises. The group, largely consisting of Croats but also including Serbs, Hungarians, Muslims and two foreign nationals who fought on the side of the Croatian National Guard, was initially <b>transported</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> JNA barracks in Vukovar. Several prisoners were identified as hospital staff and removed from the group to be returned to the hospital while the rest of them were <b>transported</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Ovčara farm south of Vukovar. Once at the farm, the prisoners were beaten for several hours before the JNA pulled its troops from the site, leaving the prisoners in the custody of the Croatian Serb TO and Serbian paramilitaries. The prisoners were then taken to a prepared site, shot in groups of ten to twenty and buried in a mass grave.|$|E
5|$|Mass escapes were rare. One of the {{few that}} succeeded took place on 2October 1961, when 53people from the border village of Böseckendorf– {{a quarter of the}} village's population– escaped en masse, {{followed}} by another 13inhabitants in February 1963. An unusual mass escape occurred in September 1964 when 14East Germans, including 11 children, were smuggled across the border in a refrigerated truck. They were able to escape detection by being concealed under the carcasses of slaughtered pigs being <b>transported</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> West.|$|E
5|$|On 4 February, the CryoSat-2 {{spacecraft}} was fuelled for launch.

Rollout occurred on 15 February, and the next day the satellite was activated in order to test its systems following integration onto the rocket.|$|E

5|$|Regardless of {{the outcome}} of the {{continental}} migration, the continued subduction process causes water to be <b>transported</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> mantle. After a billion years from the present, a geophysical model gives an estimate that 27% of the current ocean mass will have been subducted. If this process were to continue unmodified into the future, the subduction and release would reach an equilibrium after 65% of the current ocean mass has been subducted.|$|E
