40|$|<b>The</b> <b>time</b> <b>courses</b> <b>of</b> isometrically {{recorded}} photomechanical {{responses of}} isolated sphincter pupillae of Rana pipiens can be accurately predicted {{by a set}} of differential equations derived from phosphorylation theory of smooth muscle contraction. We compared actual light-stimulated contractions with calculated ones over a wide range of stimulus intensities (56 -fold) and durations (0. 4 - 4. 0 s). The hypothetical Ca++-calmodulin-myosin light chain kinase cascade acts as a "valve" to control the flow of ATP through a phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycle. When the rate of flow of ATP through the phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycle is increased, the percentage of phosphorylated myosin increases. <b>The</b> <b>time</b> <b>courses</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> concentrations of phosphorylated myosin during different responses are seen to be functions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>courses</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> opening and closing of the coupling cascade "valve.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{mechanisms}} of apparent streaming potentials elicited across Necturus gallbladder epithelium by addition or removal of sucrose from the apical bathing solution were studied by assessing <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>courses</b> of: (a) <b>the</b> change in transepithelial voltage (Vm,), (b) {{the change in}} osmolality at the cell surface (estimated with a tetrabutylammonium [TBA+]-selective microelectrode, using TBA + as a tracer for sucrose), and (c) the change in cell impermeant solute concentration ([TMA+], measured with an intracellular double-barrel TMA+-selective microelectrode after loading the cells with TMA ÷ by transient permeabilization with nystatin). For both sucrose addition and removal, <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>courses</b> <b>of</b> V=, were <b>the</b> same as <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>courses</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> voltage signals produced by [TMA÷]~, while <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>courses</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> voltage signals produced by [TBA*]o were much faster.
