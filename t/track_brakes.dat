5|$|From 21 November 1944, {{when the}} Flåm Line {{received}} electric traction, Class 64 trains {{were also used}} there. The Flåm Line is even steeper and more curved than the Hardanger Line, so the trains received <b>track</b> <b>brakes.</b> In 1947, El 9 locomotives were delivered for the Flåm Line. Class 64 trains continued to be used periodically on the Flåm Line when there was insufficient availability of El 9s, {{as well as in}} periods with very little or very much traffic.|$|E
25|$|The {{acceleration}} {{distance of a}} trainset with 14 cars to 100km/h − starting at standstill, on level terrain − is given as 900m (66 seconds), to 200km/h on 6,850m (200s) and to 250km/h on 18,350m (380s). Braking distance of a service stop under LZB control (0,5m/s²) from 250km/h is given as 4820m that of a fast braking (1,05m/s²) at 2300m. For braking all cars have disc brakes. Additionally, the power heads use regenerative brakes, the intermediate cars have electromagnetic <b>track</b> <b>brakes.</b> The power cars have spring-loaded parking brakes; intermediate cars use screw brakes for the same purpose. The bogies facilitate replacing the <b>track</b> <b>brakes</b> with eddy current brakes.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Magnetic <b>track</b> <b>brake</b> is a {{new kind}} of rail transit vehicle braking mode, this paper {{introduces}} its composition, structure, working principle and braking control methods, and analyzes its application. 1 Concept and classification of magnetic <b>track</b> <b>brake</b> The force which slowing down or stopping the train, keeping the train speed stability when downhill driving, making the train stopped in place even on the slopes is known as brake. The way using electromagnetic effect for braking, is known as the electromagnetic brake. According to the application of electromagnetic brake implementation on rail transit vehicle, there are two main types: electromagnetic rail brake and electromagnetic eddy current brake. Electromagnetic rail brake (also called magnetic <b>track</b> <b>brake)</b> is a kind of contact friction braking, basing on the wheel/rail adhesion. The electromagnetic force sucks the magnetic <b>track</b> <b>brake</b> which mounted on bogie and rail. Through the device {{at the bottom of the}} magnetic rail wear, the sliding friction between the plate and rails, train the kinetic energy into heat energy and make it escape into the atmosphere, so as to realize the train slowing down or stop. We divided magnetic <b>track</b> <b>brake</b> into electromagnetic <b>track</b> <b>brake</b> and magnetic <b>track</b> <b>brake</b> wit...|$|R

25|$|Neutral Bay wharf – Neutral Bay Junction: {{closed in}} May 1956. As {{mentioned}} above, this line had {{a combination of}} long, steep grades and windy track, and only trams fitted with <b>track</b> <b>brakes</b> (which were not otherwise used on the Sydney tramways) or dynamic (rheostatic) brakes were permitted. The single track down Hayes Street was the steepest unassisted in Sydney.|$|E
25|$|The line is signalled with {{advisory}} wayside signals, {{except on}} surface portions in street medians or in-street running. Wayside signal territory stretches from Lechmere {{to the surface}} portals at Kenmore, and along {{the entire length of}} the D–Riverside branch. There are no automatic protection devices, but the cars have <b>track</b> <b>brakes,</b> giving the ability to stop quickly under control of the operator. Interlockings are controlled through a wayside Automatic Vehicle Identification (AVI) system that relies on the operator properly entering the destination manually on a roto-wheel in the train cab at the beginning of a run.|$|E
25|$|The {{trailers}} {{also received}} a renovation from 1921 to 1925, although the body and interior remained intact. The main upgrades included new connectors {{to allow them to}} run in multiple with newer trams and <b>track</b> <b>brakes.</b> With these upgrades the trailers normally ran with SS trams. One trailer was requisitioned by the German occupation forces and moved to the Stettin Tramway. It was numbered 519 and remained in service until 1945. One trailer collided on 16 May 1944 and was subsequently retired. The remaining nineteen units remained in service until May 1966 and October 1967, respectively. Many of the older undercarriages were rebuilt to maintenance of way material. This included five ballast cars, six flatcars and various other specialized vehicles. As of 1996 many were still in use.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to {{investigate}} the potential of Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS) for identification of visually unrecognizable <b>braking</b> <b>tracks.</b> Identification of these tracks is based on different chemical composition of tire tread in comparison to road surface. The investigation was divided in several sequential steps – selection of suitable chemical element and its spectral line for break tracks identification; determination {{of the limits of}} detection and threshold intensity respectively for the selected chemical element; verification of LIBS ability to detect <b>braking</b> <b>tracks</b> on a real <b>braking</b> <b>track.</b> This testing <b>braking</b> <b>track</b> was prepared by exactly defined and described conditions. The detection was performed in two ways – laboratory analysis of tire treads particles collected via adhesive tape and in situ analysis via mobile apparatus.

500|$|The Glenelg tram, {{part of the}} {{integrated}} Adelaide Metro public transport network, is a [...] route from the centre of Adelaide to the beachside suburb of Glenelg. Recently extended at its northern end, it is currently Adelaide's only remaining tramway. Trams run at approximately twenty-minute intervals at off-peak times, and as often as every 6 minutes during peak hour periods. Until January 2006, TypeH cars provided all services on the route. In 2005, the entire route was upgraded with new track and improved tram stops, then in 2006, eleven, thirtymetre long articulated low-floor Flexity Classic Light Rail vehicles, built by Bombardier in Germany, have since replaced the Type H trams in regular day-to-day service, although five refurbished Type H trams have been retained and operate a restricted 'heritage service' timetable on Saturdays, Sundays and Public Holidays.

Following the accident, The Guardian reported that on 31 October there had been passenger allegations made on Facebook of a tram travelling round the curve at excessive speed. The Evening Standard reports an earlier passenger complaint describing the tram as [...] "tipping" [...] on the curve. The driver of the tram involved in the incident of 31 October was not the one involved in the accident on 9 November.|$|E

50|$|The main {{advantage}} of half-tracks over wheeled vehicles {{is that the}} tracks reduced the pressure on any given area of the ground by spreading the vehicle's weight over a larger area, which gives it greater mobility over soft terrain like mud and snow, while they do not require the complex steering mechanisms of fully tracked vehicles, relying instead on their front wheels to direct the vehicle, augmented in some cases by <b>track</b> <b>braking</b> controlled by the steering wheel.|$|R

50|$|The {{cable cars}} of San Francisco are fitted with {{mechanical}} <b>track</b> <b>brakes,</b> {{controlled by a}} large braking lever next to the grip lever.

50|$|<b>Track</b> <b>brakes</b> are {{a form of}} brakes {{unique to}} railborne vehicles. The braking force derives from the {{friction}} resulting from the application of wood or metal braking shoes directly to the tracks (as the name suggests). Early examples of <b>track</b> <b>brakes</b> used on the horse hauled mineral tramways that preceded the steam locomotive were described as sledge brakes, and are usually associated with lines that used gravity propulsion.|$|E

5000|$|The NTSB {{also noted}} {{a problem with}} the basic design: [...] "The car body and the wheel-axle {{assembly}} are not articulated." [...] The passing section of the track involves a short turning section which allows the cars to pass each other.

This problem, combined with safety system problems which caused unwanted <b>track</b> <b>brake</b> deployment, resulted in a derailment.
