5|$|At {{the urging}} of friends in the anti-slavery movement, Coffin moved to Cincinnati, Ohio, in 1847 to operate a {{warehouse}} that sold only free-labor goods. Despite making considerable progress with the business, the free-labor venture proved unprofitable and he abandoned the enterprise in 1857. From 1847 through 1857, Coffin continued to assist hundreds of runaway slaves by lodging them in his Ohio home. When slavery was abolished after the American Civil War, Coffin <b>traveled</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> Midwest and overseas to France and Great Britain, where he was instrumental in forming aid societies that provided food, clothing, funds, and education to former slaves. Coffin retired from public life in the 1870s and wrote an autobiography, Reminiscences of Levi Coffin, published in 1876, a year before his death.|$|E
5|$|During 2004, Romney spent {{considerable}} effort {{trying to}} bolster the state Republican Party, but it failed to gain any seats in the state legislative elections that year. Given a prime-time appearance at the 2004 Republican National Convention, political figures began discussing him as a potential 2008 presidential candidate. Midway through his term, Romney decided {{that he wanted to}} stage a full-time run for president, and on December 14, 2005, announced that he would not seek re-election for a second term. As chair of the Republican Governors Association, Romney <b>traveled</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> country, meeting prominent Republicans and building a national political network; he spent all, or parts of, more than 200days out of state during 2006, preparing for his run.|$|E

5|$|Other black {{newspapers}} {{also carried}} significant {{coverage of the}} lynching, as did liberal papers such as The New Republic and The Nation. Freeman <b>traveled</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> U.S. to speak to audiences about her investigation, maintaining that a shift in public opinion could accomplish more than legislative actions. Although there were other lynchings as brutal as Washington's, the availability of images and the setting of his death made it a cause célèbre. Leaders of the NAACP hoped to launch a legal battle against those responsible for Washington's death, but abandoned the plan owing to the projected cost.|$|E

The conference was {{the culmination of}} 40 years of Du Bois's dreams– a meeting of 29 nations from Africa and Asia, many recently independent, representing most of the world's colored peoples. The conference celebrated their independence, as the nations began to assert their power as non-aligned nations during the Cold War. In 1958, Du Bois regained his passport, and with his second wife, Shirley Graham Du Bois, he <b>traveled</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> world, visiting Russia and China.

5|$|By June 15, 1942 the {{highways}} in the Grand Rapids area were reconfigured. A Bypass US16 (BYP US16) designation {{was assigned to}} the portion of M-114 that <b>traveled</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> southwest side of Grand Rapids (now M-11), leaving just the east and unfinished north segments left. The section along {{the east side of the}} city was completed as M-114. A northern leg was added along 3 Mile Road at the same time. By 1945, the northern leg of M-114 was turned back to local control and removed from the highway system. The eastern leg was assigned a BYP US131 designation, thereby eliminating the last remaining portion of M-114. A BYP M-21 designation was also used along part of the southern and eastern legs. East Beltline now carries M-37 and M-44.|$|E
5|$|C-SPAN {{offers a}} number of public {{services}} related to the network's public affairs programming.

5|$|In 1913, {{the state}} highway system was {{adjusted}} again, and several new roads {{were added to}} the system, including parts of what would become US410. The Olympic Highway <b>traveled</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> Olympic Peninsula and a section from Aberdeen to Olympia was later used as part of US410. The Pacific Highway would later have a brief concurrency with US410 from Olympia to Tacoma, and US410 would later connect to the National Park Highway in Tacoma and follow it to Buckley, where State Road5, now a secondary highway maintained by the counties, began. From the end of State Road5 in Naches, the Inland Empire Highway is concurrent with the future US410 to Dayton, where a branch of the highway travels to Clarkston. State Road5 became the McClellan Pass Highway in 1919 and was aligned further south to Chinook Pass. The McClellan Pass Highway was renamed the Naches Pass Highway in 1921 to reflect the realignment in 1919. Despite the name, the road did not cross Naches Pass, as no highway ever has.|$|E
