5|$|The area's {{population}} has declined {{from a peak}} of around 2700 in 1926 to its current level of around 1200. <b>This</b> <b>decline</b> has halted in recent decades, with 2008 figures being very similar to those of 1986.|$|E
5|$|Critics {{acknowledge}} Super Mario 64 {{as a key}} {{contributor to}} the anticipation, and initial success, of the Nintendo 64 console. Though the system was initially very successful, it eventually {{lost much of its}} market share to Sony's PlayStation. 1UP.com attributed <b>this</b> <b>decline</b> to Nintendo's use of cartridges and the design of the Nintendo 64 controller, which were reportedly implemented by Miyamoto for Super Mario 64.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the recent}} years, the house sparrow {{population}} {{has been on the}} decline in many Asian countries, and <b>this</b> <b>decline</b> is quite evident in India. To promote the conservation of these birds, in 2012, the house sparrow was declared as the state bird of Delhi.|$|E

5|$|The southeastern U.S. {{subspecies}} (Falco sparverius paulus) {{has declined}} 82% since 1940 {{due to a}} decrease in nest site availability. <b>This</b> <b>decline</b> {{is a result of}} longleaf pines being cleared from agricultural fields. Despite this, the American kestrel is classed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} studies have {{reported}} an age-related decline in dopamine synthesis and dopamine receptor density (i.e., the number of receptors) in the brain. <b>This</b> <b>decline</b> has been shown to occur in the striatum and extrastriatal regions.C]DOPA |journal=Life Sciences |volume=79 |issue=8 |pages=730–736 |doi=10.1016/j.lfs.2006.02.017 |pmid=16580023 }} Decreases in the D1, D2, and D3 receptors are well documented. The reduction of dopamine with aging is thought to be responsible for many neurological symptoms that increase in frequency with age, such as decreased arm swing and increased rigidity. Changes in dopamine levels may also cause age-related changes in cognitive flexibility.|$|E
5|$|Alaska is {{the heartland}} of the sea otter's range. In 1973, the {{population}} in Alaska was estimated at between 100,000 and 125,000 animals. By 2006, though, the Alaska population had fallen to an estimated 73,000 animals. A massive decline in sea otter populations in the Aleutian Islands accounts {{for most of the}} change; the cause of <b>this</b> <b>decline</b> is not known, although orca predation is suspected. The sea otter population in Prince William Sound was also hit hard by the Exxon Valdez oil spill, which killed thousands of sea otters in 1989.|$|E
50|$|In October 2006, 339 public {{entities}} were violating the guidelines concerning amakudari, a figure 38 {{times higher than}} the number for the previous year. <b>This</b> <b>declined</b> to 166 by July 2007.|$|R
50|$|The {{family were}} {{entrepreneurs}} in Bandon {{in the eighteenth}} and nineteenth centuries.Initially they ran a cotton mill at Overton, near Bandon, but when <b>this</b> <b>declined</b> they established Bandon Distillery in 1826.|$|R
5000|$|The neighborhood's {{population}} {{has changed over}} time. A 1974 report stated that the neighborhood held 8,000 people around 1970. <b>This</b> <b>declined</b> to 4,900 in 1974 [...] and then to 2,900 in 2010.|$|R
5|$|American crows succumb {{easily to}} West Nile virus infection. This was {{originally}} a mosquito-borne African virus causing encephalitis in humans and livestock since about 1000 AD, and was accidentally introduced to North America in 1999, apparently by an infected air traveller who got {{bitten by a}} mosquito after arrival. It is estimated that the American crow population has dropped by up to 45% since 1999. Despite <b>this</b> <b>decline,</b> the crow is considered a species of least concern.|$|E
5|$|At {{the very}} end of the Preclassic Period, around 100–300 AD, cities in the {{highlands}} and along the Pacific Coast ceased to raise sculpted stelae bearing hieroglyphic texts. This cessation in the production of stelae was the most dramatic symptom of a general decline in the region at this time. <b>This</b> <b>decline</b> has been linked to the intrusion of peoples from the western highlands combined with the disastrous eruption of the Ilopango Volcano that severely affected the entire region.|$|E
5|$|Following the First World War, it surged in {{popularity}} and {{was associated with}} Hollywood stars {{and members of the}} British Royal Family. Its numbers have dropped significantly since then, with the breed listed as a Vulnerable Native Breed by the Kennel Club; an all-time low was recorded in 2008 when only 43 puppies were registered in the United Kingdom. <b>This</b> <b>decline</b> has been blamed on an influx of foreign and designer breeds, and the Sealyham's reduced usefulness as a working dog.|$|E
50|$|Ibiza was {{a popular}} {{destinations}} for hippies in the 60's. In that time, it became the scene of sporadic full moon-parties. <b>This</b> <b>declined</b> in the 1980s, but became popular again in the 1990s.|$|R
50|$|All major {{metropolitan}} regions have newspapers, {{with some of}} them having multiple papers, though <b>this</b> has <b>declined</b> in modern times. Many smaller cities have had local newspapers, again, <b>this</b> having <b>declined</b> over time.|$|R
50|$|At {{the western}} tip, a 3.75 km2 coconut {{plantation}} {{was established in}} 1907-1918, but <b>this</b> <b>declined</b> since World War II and all maintenance ceased after 1990. Secondary forest is now reclaiming this area.|$|R
5|$|From 1972 to 2006, {{dramatic}} reductions {{continued in}} the number of feral honey bees in the U.S. and a significant though somewhat gradual decline {{in the number of}} colonies maintained by beekeepers. <b>This</b> <b>decline</b> includes the cumulative losses from all factors, such as urbanization, pesticide use, tracheal and Varroa mites, and commercial beekeepers' retiring and going out of business. However, in late 2006 and early 2007, the rate of attrition was alleged to have reached new proportions, and people began to use the term colony collapse disorder to describe this sudden rash of disappearances (or sometimes spontaneous hive collapse or the Mary Celeste syndrome in the United Kingdom).|$|E
5|$|In the US, {{the case}} {{fatality}} rate {{is estimated to}} be 21% by 30days after TBI. A study on Iraq War soldiers found that severe TBI carries a mortality of 30–50%. Deaths have declined due to improved treatments and systems for managing trauma in societies wealthy enough to provide modern emergency and neurosurgical services. The fraction of those who die after being hospitalized with TBI fell from almost half in the 1970s to about a quarter {{at the beginning of the}} 21stcentury. <b>This</b> <b>decline</b> in mortality has led to a concomitant increase in the number of people living with disabilities that result from TBI.|$|E
5|$|Kumbakonam {{continued}} to grow even after India's independence though it fell behind {{the nearby town of}} Thanjavur in terms of population and administrative importance. The population growth rate began to fall sharply after 1981. <b>This</b> <b>decline</b> has been attributed to limited land area and lack of industrial potential. During the Mahamaham festival of 1992, there was a major stampede in which 48 people were killed and 74 were injured. On July 16, 2004, a devastating fire accident in the Sri Krishna school killed 94 children.|$|E
50|$|While {{railways}} had {{an inherent}} advantage in transporting heavy minerals, the line's viability {{was dependent on}} the commercial success of local quarries, and when <b>this</b> <b>declined</b> the finances of the line became irretrievable.|$|R
50|$|The {{civil parish}} has {{an area of}} 1258 acres. From a {{population}} of 201 in the year 1801, <b>this</b> <b>declined</b> to 138 in 1901, to 120 in 1931 and is now under 30 (in 2011).|$|R

5|$|The Italian {{artist and}} critic Giorgio Vasari (1511–1574) first {{used the term}} rinascita {{retrospectively}} in his book The Lives of the Artists (published 1550). In the book Vasari attempted to define {{what he described as}} a break with the barbarities of gothic art: the arts (he held) had fallen into decay {{with the collapse of the}} Roman Empire and only the Tuscan artists, beginning with Cimabue (1240–1301) and Giotto (1267–1337) began to reverse <b>this</b> <b>decline</b> in the arts. Vasari saw antique art as central to the rebirth of Italian art.|$|E
5|$|The {{changes in}} {{demographic}} structure {{have created a}} number of social issues, particularly a potential decline in workforce population and increase {{in the cost of}} social security benefits like the public pension plan. A growing number of younger Japanese are not marrying or remain childless. In 2011, Japan's population dropped for a fifth year, falling by 204,000 people to 126.24 million people. This was the greatest decline since at least 1947, when comparable figures were first compiled. <b>This</b> <b>decline</b> was made worse by the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami, which killed nearly 16,000 people.|$|E
5|$|The {{last great}} {{ruler of the}} Middle Kingdom, Amenemhat III, allowed Semitic-speaking Canaanite {{settlers}} from the Near East into the delta region to provide a sufficient labour force for his especially active mining and building campaigns. These ambitious building and mining activities, however, combined with severe Nile floods later in his reign, strained the economy and precipitated the slow decline into the Second Intermediate Period during the later Thirteenth and Fourteenth dynasties. During <b>this</b> <b>decline,</b> the Canaanite settlers began to seize control of the delta region, eventually coming to power in Egypt as the Hyksos.|$|E
50|$|In {{the late}} 1960s the CFU had 110,000 members. <b>This</b> <b>declined</b> to 100,000 members in 1979. That year the CFU had 1,000 lodges in twenty six states and several Canadian provinces. The CFU had 90,000 members in 1988.|$|R
50|$|When {{the site}} was {{recorded}} as an SSSI it supported a strong breeding population of the marsh fritillary (Eurodryas aurinia), however <b>this</b> <b>declined</b> in the late 20th century, and this species is no longer found at the site.|$|R
50|$|The {{population}} of Alyth had been 3,422 in 1861 but <b>this</b> <b>declined</b> to 2,837 by 1921 {{and did not}} recover. Use of the line declined accordingly, and it closed to passengers on 2 July 1951. Complete closure followed in January 1965.|$|R
5|$|Various causes {{contributed to}} <b>this</b> <b>decline.</b> The {{abolition}} of the Corn Laws in 1846 allowed the free importation of grain into these islands. Unable to compete with foreigners, the Irish farmer turned his land to pasture and grew only sufficient grain for his own use. The Banagher corn trade rapidly declined, and would have completely vanished were it not that barley growing was kept alive by Waller's malthouse. The clearances in East Galway {{in the years immediately}} succeeding the Great Irish Famine adversely affected the trade of the town while the smaller industries were unable to compete against the highly organised industries of Britain.|$|E
5|$|With {{the exodus}} of several {{manufacturing}} companies, the area's industrial economy began to decline during the early 20th century. By the 1920s, competition from the South and Midwest, followed by the Great Depression, led {{to the collapse of}} the three main industries in Massachusetts: textiles, shoemaking, and precision mechanics. <b>This</b> <b>decline</b> would continue into the later half of the century; between 1950 and 1979, the number of Massachusetts residents involved in textile manufacturing declined from 264,000 to 63,000. The 1969 closure of the Springfield Armory, in particular, spurred an exodus of high-paying jobs from Western Massachusetts, which suffered greatly as it de-industrialized during the last 40 years of the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{population}} of macaroni penguins is estimated at around 18 million mature individuals, a substantial decline has been recorded in several locations. This includes a 50% reduction in the South Georgia population between the mid-1970s to mid-1990s, and {{the disappearance of the}} species from Isla Recalada in Southern Chile. <b>This</b> <b>decline</b> of the overall population in the last 30 years has resulted in the classification of the species as globally Vulnerable by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Long-term monitoring programs are underway at a number of breeding colonies, and many of the islands that support breeding populations of this penguin are protected reserves. The Heard Islands and McDonald Islands are World Heritage Sites for the macaroni penguin. The macaroni penguin may be being impacted by commercial fishing and marine pollution. A 2008 study suggests the abilities of female penguins to reproduce may be negatively affected by climate- and fishing-induced reductions in krill density.|$|E
50|$|Output {{of china}} clay in Cornwall {{increased}} rapidly at this time, from 12,790 tons in 1826 to 20,784 tons in 1838. The Pentewan Railway handled {{about a third}} of the traffic at first, but <b>this</b> <b>declined</b> to about a tenth in 1838.|$|R
5000|$|Although {{there was}} heavy traffic in {{fish in the}} early years, <b>this</b> <b>declined</b> {{during the first half}} of the twentieth century.
