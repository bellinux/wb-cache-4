25|$|The {{molecular}} {{mechanism of}} ATP (Adenosine triphosphate) generation in chloroplasts {{is similar to}} that in mitochondria and takes the required energy from the proton motive force (PMF). However, chloroplasts rely more on the chemical potential of the PMF to generate the potential energy required for ATP synthesis. The PMF is the sum of a proton chemical potential (given by the proton concentration gradient) and a <b>transmembrane</b> <b>electrical</b> <b>potential</b> (given by charge separation across the membrane). Compared to the inner membranes of mitochondria, which have a significantly higher membrane potential due to charge separation, thylakoid membranes lack a charge gradient. To compensate for this, the 10,000 fold proton concentration gradient across the thylakoid membrane is much higher compared to a 10 fold gradient across the inner membrane of mitochondria. The resulting chemiosmotic potential between the lumen and stroma is high enough to drive ATP synthesis using the ATP synthase. As the protons travel back down the gradient through channels in ATP synthase, ADP + Pi are combined into ATP. In this manner, the light-dependent reactions are coupled to the synthesis of ATP via the proton gradient.|$|E

50|$|In {{addition}} to the method of proton extrusion discussed above, {{it is believed that}} the general method of cellular respiration is different in obligate alkaliphiles as compared to neutrophiles. Generally, ATP production operates by establishing a proton gradient (greater H+ concentration outside the membrane) and a <b>transmembrane</b> <b>electrical</b> <b>potential</b> (with a positive charge outside the membrane). However, since alkaliphiles have a reversed pH gradient, it would seem that ATP production—which is based on a strong proton motive force—would be severely reduced. However, the opposite is true. It has been proposed that while the pH gradient has been reversed, the <b>transmembrane</b> <b>electrical</b> <b>potential</b> is greatly increased. This increase in charge causes the production of greater amounts of ATP by each translocated proton when driven through an ATPase. Research in this area is ongoing.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Large supraphysiologic <b>transmembrane</b> <b>electrical</b> <b>potentials</b> {{are known}} to alter the {{molecular}} organization of the bilayer lipid component of cell membranes, leading to ionic permeabilization or “electroporation”. Typically, membrane electroporation is followed by several orders of magnitude increases in electrical conductance and diffusive permeability to low-molecular-weight solutes. Electroporation may be transient or stable {{depending on whether the}} membrane eventually seals or remains permeabilized. Factors that control seal-ing have not been well characterized. This paper describes the kinetics of mem-brane sealing following electroporation by pulses over a range of supraphysio-logic potentials. The increase in membrane conductance is highly nonlinear during a – 440 -mV, 4 -ms pulse and reaches two orders of magnitude greater than baseline. Electroporation and relaxation sealing kinetics are quite differ-ent, reflecting a significant hysteresis effect. Thus, it appears that the magnitude and duration of the field pulse are important factors in sealing...|$|R
40|$|The {{relationship}} between Al-induced depolarization of root-cell <b>transmembrane</b> <b>electrical</b> <b>potentials</b> (Em) and Al tolerance in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) was investigated. Al exposure induced depolarizations of Em in the Al-tolerant wheat cultivars Atlas and ET 3, {{but not in}} the Al-sensitive wheat cultivars Scout and ES 3. The depolarizations of Em occured in root cap cells and as far back as 10 mm from the root tip. The depolarization was specific to Al 3 +; no depolarization was observed when roots were exposed to the rhizotoxic trivalent cation La 3 +. The Al-induced depolarization occurred in the presence of anion-channel antagonists that blocked the release of malate, indicating that the depolarization is not due to the electrogenic efflux of malate 2 -. K+-induced depolarizations in the root cap were of the same magnitude as Al-induced depolarizations, but did not trigger malate release, indicating that Al-induced depolarization of root cap cell membrane potentials is probably linked to, but is not sufficient to trigger, malate release...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{position}} {{and extent of}} movement of a charged peptide within a membrane bilayer provides much controversy. In our study, we have examined {{the nature of the}} highly charged helix-turn-helix motif (S 3 b and S 4) to address how a highly charged peptide is stabilized within a bilayer in the presence of various <b>transmembrane</b> <b>electrical</b> <b>potentials.</b> Our double-bilayer simulation results show how the variation of the salt concentrations between the inner and outer bath establishes a transmembrane potential. Our results also show that important features of the peptide affected by changes in <b>electrical</b> <b>potential</b> are the center of mass depth, the swivel/kink degrees of conformation, and the hydrogen-bonding patterns. As the voltage gradient across the bilayer increased, the center of mass of the peptide shifted in a direction toward the outer bath. The peptide also has a higher percent helical content and the swivel/kink conformation is more rigid for nonpolarized systems where no voltage drop occurred between salt baths. Our results also provide some suggestions for how this domain may be affected by environmental changes as part of the voltage sensor in a K-channel...|$|R

40|$|The penumbral {{concept is}} defined as {{different}} areas within the ischemic region evolve into irre-versible brain injury over time and that this evolution is most critically linked to {{the severity of the}} decline in cerebral blood flow (CBF). The ischemic penumbra was initially defined as a region of reduced CBF with absent spontaneous or induced <b>electrical</b> <b>potentials</b> that still maintained ionic homeostasis and <b>transmembrane</b> <b>electrical</b> <b>potentials.</b> The reduction of CBF levels to between 10 and 15 mL/ 100 g/min and approximately 25 mL/ 100 g/min are likely to identify penumbral tissue, and the ischemic core of irreversible ischemic tissue has a CBF value below the lower threshold. The role of identifying this critically deprived brain tissue from CBF in triaging patients for endovascular ischemic therapy is evolving. In this review we focus on the basic science of the penumbral concept and identification using various imaging modalities (PET, MRI, and CT) in animal models and human studies.

40|$|We {{report on}} the {{identification}} of a voltage-dependent Ca 2 + transport system that mediates Ca 2 + influx across the plasma membrane (PM) of wheat (Triticum aestivum) root cells. The experimental approach involved the imposition of <b>transmembrane</b> <b>electrical</b> <b>potentials</b> (via K+ diffusion potentials) in populations of purified, right-side-out PM vesicles isolated from wheat roots. Using 45 Ca 2 + to quantify Ca 2 + influx into the PM vesicles, the voltage-dependent characteristics of Ca 2 + transport {{were found to be}} similar to those exhibited by L-type voltage-gated Ca 2 + channels in animal cells. The putative PM Ca 2 + channel opened upon depolarization of the membrane potential, and Ca 2 + flux increased to a maximum upon further depolarization and then decreased back to zero upon further successive depolarizations. This channel was found to be selective for Ca 2 + over Mg 2 +, Sr 2 +, K+, and Na+; was blocked by very low concentrations of La 3 +; was unaffected by high concentrations of the K+ channel blocker tetraethylammonium; and exhibited Michaelis-Menten-type transport kinetics. Based on these transport properties, we argue that this transport system is a PM Ca 2 + channel. We suggest that the use of radiotracer flux analysis of voltage-clamped PM vesicles derived from plant roots is a straightforward approach for the characterization of certain voltage-gated ion channels functioning in cellular membranes of higher plant cells...|$|R

Four isolates, OF 1, OF 3, OF 4, and OF 6, were obligately aerobic, spore-forming, gram-positive, motile rods {{which were}} capable of growth at both pH 7. 5 and pH 10. 5. Strains OF 1 and OF 6 grew best at the lower pH value; and whereas growth of these strains at pH 10. 5 was completely dependent on added Na+, growth at pH 7. 5 was only partially dependent on added Na+. Strains OF 3 and OF 4 grew better at pH 10. 5 than at pH 7. 5, with strain OF 3 growing modestly over its entire pH range, while OF 4 grew well. Growth of OF 3 and OF 4 was completely dependent on added Na+ at both pH 7. 5 and pH 10. 5. DNA-DNA hybridization studies indicated that OF 1 and OF 6 are closely related strains but {{are not related to}} the other isolates, Bacillus subtilis, or two previously studied obligately alkalophilic bacilli. OF 3 was unrelated to any of the other organisms examined in the study, whereas OF 4 showed complete homology with obligately alkalophilic Bacillus firmus RAB. All four isolates maintained a cytoplasmic pH that was considerably lower than the external pH when the latter was 10. 5. Although substantial <b>transmembrane</b> <b>electrical</b> <b>potentials</b> were observed, the total electrochemical proton gradient (delta mu H+) was low at pH 10. 5 in all the strains.
