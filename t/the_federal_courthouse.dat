5|$|On June 12, 1942, Judge James Alger Fee of the United States District Court for the District of Oregon began {{presiding}} over the non-jury trial of Yasui, the first case challenging the curfew {{to make it to}} court. The trial was held at <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Courthouse</b> in Portland. Fee determined in his ruling issued on November 16, 1942, that the curfew could only apply to aliens, as martial law had not been imposed by the government. However, he also ruled that because Yasui had worked for the Japanese government he had forfeited his citizenship, so that the curfew did apply to him. Fee sentenced Yasui to one year in jail, which was served at the Multnomah County Jail, and $5,000 fine. This federal court decision with constitutional and war power issues made news around the country.|$|E

25|$|The Alaska State Capitol in {{downtown}} Juneau was originally built as the Federal and Territorial Building in 1931. Prior to statehood, it housed federal government offices, <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>courthouse</b> and a post office. It also housed the territorial legislature {{and many other}} territorial offices, including that of the governor. Today, Juneau remains {{the home of the}} state legislature and the offices of the governor and lieutenant governor. Some other executive branch offices have moved elsewhere in the state. Recent discussion has been focused between relocating the seat of state government outside of Juneau and building a new capitol building in Juneau; neither position has led efforts to keep the capital in Juneau.|$|E
25|$|In 1911, the United States Congress {{authorized}} {{funds for}} construction of a capitol building for the Alaska Territory. Because of World War I, construction was delayed, and there were difficulties purchasing the necessary land. Local citizens of Juneau donated some of the required funds, and construction began on September 8, 1929. Construction of the capitol took less than two years, and the building was dedicated as the Federal and Territorial Building on February 14, 1931. It was designed by Treasury Department architects in the Art Deco architectural style. The building was originally used {{by the federal government}} to house <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>courthouse</b> and post office for the territory. Since Alaska gained statehood in 1959, the building has been used by the state government.|$|E

25|$|On May 11, 1982 Howard Putnam left a {{courtroom}} at <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Courthouse</b> in Brooklyn, New York City {{after failing to}} gain a court injunction to stop a threatened pilot strike. However, Putnam was successful in obtaining an extension of time from Braniff's principal creditors until October 1982. The next day, on May 12, Braniff Airways ceased all operations, ending 54 years of service. Braniff flights at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport that morning were suddenly grounded, and passengers were forced to disembark, being told that Braniff no longer existed. A thunderstorm provided an excuse to cancel many afternoon flights that day, although Braniff's legendary Boeing 747 Flight 501 to Honolulu departed as scheduled, with the crew later refusing to divert the flight to Los Angeles International Airport. The flight returned to DFW the following morning, the last scheduled Braniff flight.|$|E
25|$|Yasui was an {{attorney}} who was a U.S. Army reservist and, until {{the start of the}} war, worked for the Japanese consulate in Chicago, Illinois. The trial was held at <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Courthouse</b> in downtown Portland where Yasui had broken the curfew. Fee determined in his ruling for the case that the curfew could only apply to aliens, as martial law had not been declared. However, he also ruled that because Yasui had worked for the Japanese government that he had forfeited his citizenship so that the curfew did apply to him. Fee sentenced Yasui to 1 year in jail, served at the Multnomah County Jail. Meanwhile, his case went on appeal until reaching the Supreme Court of the United States as Yasui v. United States, (320 U.S. 115) with that court determining the opposite of Fee, that Yasui was a citizen, but the curfew did apply to citizens. After the Supreme Court returned the case to Fee for re-evaluation, he affirmed the conviction on the grounds the Supreme Court had determined.|$|E
