40|$|An Innovative {{company can}} apply new {{thinking}} faster than its competitors or surprise its customers by offering products {{that makes the}} customers first realize its need and then consume it. There are substantial evidence stating the positive impact of innovation in the automotive industry; however, corresponding research is lacking on the <b>two-wheeler</b> <b>industry</b> which is growing at a healthy pace. The main purpose of this thesis is to explore the role of innovation in a two-wheeler company and to analyse its influence {{in the growth of}} such companies.   Two research questions are addressed: What role does innovation play in the firms' product portfolio management? Does innovation lead to increased sales and market share for a company? The thesis is based on a case study of Bajaj Auto Ltd (BAL). Starting with a focus on the theme and motives involved in marketing of its products, the study revolves around the trends of innovation in the core business and its contribution to BAL’s success. Central to this report is the innovative ways employed by BAL to maintain a balanced portfolio followed by the comparison of the BAL’s sales growth with the Indian <b>two-wheeler</b> <b>industry</b> over the years and also the increase in market share of BAL in the same period. The descriptive part of “Bajaj Auto Ltd” is based on interviews via e-mail with management staffs and employees plus revenue data of the company. In addition the analysis builds upon secondary data from various sources of references like, journals, news paper reports, internet and articles. The results from the case company have been used together with a theoretical framework to explain the empirical patterns. From just taking a cue from the market trend to fine tuning a product’s operational efficiency, Bajaj Auto was not only able to sustain in the market but is able to compete with the leader in the two-wheeler segment in India. The world had a lot of offer and Bajaj gladly grabbed the opportunity by precisely managing innovation in all its business activities. Being intuitive and proactive in understanding the changing needs of the market has made this possible for BAL. Conclusively, the findings suggest that Innovation is proving to be a critical entity in a business firm and managing it effectively certainly favours the company in leaping ahead in times of competition. ...|$|E

The main focus of my dissertation will be the Indian automobile industry due to its rich diversity and ever-changing patterns. The Research Question which I would follow would be the growing competitiveness of the Indian Automobile Industry. The competition levels in the Indian automobile Industry have been growing and every manufacturer has been coming out new products in a quick span of time.

The Major players in the automobile industry have been focusing a lot in the R&D department in the process of coming out with new products meeting the consumers preferences. This study analyses the determinants of competitiveness in the Indian auto industry. It is based on a Porter five force model and a qualitative analysis of data. A complete industry analysis will be done in the dissertation of the Indian automobile industry using the five force model.
