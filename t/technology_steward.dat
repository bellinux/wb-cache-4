40|$|The book {{starts with}} an {{explanation}} of the reason why the terms found in the book are sometimes used in place of each other. The editors stated that when technological tools are used to establish an effective and productive study process in education, the concept of learning technology is used instead of educational technology. The editors of the book considers the field as complex and vague in terms {{of the fact that the}} meanings of the concepts are close to each other in the field of educational technology and that the field provides an opportunity for inter-disciplinary studies. However, according to the editors, this vagueness and complexity shows the superiority of the field. This superiority is explained with the fact that the field of educational technology requires upper-level skills of problem solving and critical thinking and that it presents a multi-dimensional and inter-disciplinary study field. The book was edited by Wanjira Kinuthia and Steward Marshall. Wanjira Kinuthia, an assistant professor at Georgia State University, works in the Department of Middle-Secondary Education and Instructional <b>Technology.</b> <b>Steward</b> Marshall, a professor at the University of the West Indies, is the director of the Distance Education Centre. The book includes five sections and 21 chapters. These sections are “Materials, Methods, and Modalities”, “Technology Implementation and Integration Issues”, “Student Engagement and Learning”, “Building Capacity”, “Using Technology for Performance Improvement and Productivity Enhancement”...|$|E
40|$|Today, {{less than}} a billion people have access to computers, whereas around four billion people have access to mobile phones. At the same time, {{the nature of the}} Internet has been {{undergoing}} a revolution labelled ‘web 2. 0 ’. Most web 2. 0 tools are also designed to be mobile friendly, allowing reading and updating of web 2. 0 content from mobile phones, and also featuring enhanced mobile affordances such as photo and video blogging (from cameraphones), and geotagging (from GPS equipped smartphones). Hence mobile web 2. 0 provides a platform for wider access than traditional computing that is context independent, facilitating ‘authentic’ learning environments (A. Herrington & Herrington, 2007, 2006; Jan Herrington, Herrington, Mantei, Olney, & Ferry, 2009) beyond the boundaries of the traditional tertiary classroom. Thus mobile learning (mlearning) presents vast potential for appropriation within tertiary education. This paper presents an academics journey into the use and appropriation of mlearning within their teaching practice. This journey is based upon a four year research project into the potential of mobile web 2. 0 (Cochrane, Flitta, & Bateman, 2009). Critical incidents along this journey are identified and examples given of how mobile web 2. 0 has been integrated into the academics lifestyles and pedagogical toolkits. The paper outlines the significant events in the pedagogical development of two academics over this period of four years. Critical Incident Analysis is used to identify significant ‘eureka’ moments for the participants in their mlearning (mobile learning) journeys. Several ‘lenses’ are used to bring into focus themes that emerge upon reflection over this period, including: Communities Of Practice, the Social Construction of Technology, Actor Network Theory, Activity Theory, and Social Constructivism. The symbiotic relationship developed between the academic advisor (<b>technology</b> <b>steward)</b> and the academic teaching staff has proven a rich environment for harnessing educational technology to design social constructivist learning environments for different groups of tertiary students. It is hoped the insights gained will be useful for other academic staff wanting to implement pedagogical innovation, and for professional development staff seeking insights for facilitating academics to integrate educational technology into their pedagogies...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we discuss the impact of {{redesigning}} a lecturer professional development course {{with the aim of}} embedding a community of practice (COP) model supported by the use of mobile web 2. 0 technologies. This approach was based upon a model developed to support 30 mlearning projects between 2006 and 2010, which also informed the institutions&#x 0027; new elearning strategy developed in 2009. Participating lecturers were brought into the course as participants in an intentional COP investigating the pedagogical application of social learning theories and frameworks, facilitated by the course lecturers who took on the role of <b>technology</b> <b>stewards</b> guiding the COP in the appropriation of mobile web 2. 0. Three examples of participants&#x 0027; journeys of discovery throughout the course are highlighted to illustrate the impact of this approach to professional development. Reflections on the first 2010 iteration of the course are then used to inform the following iterations in 2011...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{development}} of a 2011 international collaborative mlearning project that builds upon the success of the implementation of over 30 mlearning projects by the researcher between 2006 and 2011. In particular the project builds upon a 2010 Architecture mlearning project (Cochrane & Rhodes, 2011). The 2011 project aims to produce a significant core group of mlearning evangelists from the participating lecturers and students who will become <b>technology</b> <b>stewards</b> within each of their respective institutions, and facilitating the establishment of further international co-creative mlearning projects in 2012. The 2011 project incorporates international collaboration between Architecture elective course students (Unitec) and public relations students (AUT University) in New Zealand, and groups of students in the UK (Sheffield University and Salford University), Spain (Universitat Rovira i Virgili), and Germany (Beuth University of Applied Sciences Berlin), where the researcher has established partnerships with lecturers keen to explore the potential of mlearning integration. The learning contexts include: Third year elective Architecture students (Unitec), third year Public Relations students (AUT), second year BA(Hons) Design students (Sheffield), Sociology of Technology elective students (Beuth), MSc Audio Production students (Salford), and second year Educational Technology students (Tarragona). The paper reflects upon the establishment of the international collaboration project and the impact of the use of mobile web 2. 0 tools as a foundation for the participant collaborations...|$|R
40|$|In this {{presentation}} we {{will report}} and discuss experiences {{from the process}} of designing a sustainable organisation for a digital learning environment for Malmo University as a whole. With pedagogy {{as a starting point}} the aim has been to create an intentional community of practice with a focus on learning and digital media. Malmö University aims to be at the pedagogical forefront by using information technology and the possibilities afforded by new media, {{in order to create a}} more efficient learning process and a mutual exchange of knowledge. But how can this strategy be realized? New forms of teaching and learning in higher education require new spaces for teaching and learning. We also know that teachers in higher education need support, training, learning resources and infrastructure in order to create those new learning spaces and to develop their scholarship of teaching and learning with a focus on digital media (cf Allen et. al 2012 a,b; Bebell & O ́Dwyer, 2010; Holcomb, 2009). Our solution to this challenge is to create a multi- institutional research based hub for learning with digital media. The idea stems from the Lave & Wenger (1991; Wenger, 1998) concept “community of practice” with the addition of <b>technology</b> <b>stewarding</b> as a way to cultivate digital learning processes. At Malmo University this hub goes under the working title “the media workshop” and has both a physical and a virtual form...|$|R
40|$|Healthcare is an {{information}} business with expanding {{use of information}} and communication technologies (ICTs). Current ICT tools are immature, but a brighter future looms. We examine 7 areas of ICT in healthcare: electronic health records (EHRs), health information exchange (HIE), patient portals, telemedicine, social media, mobile devices and wearable sensors and monitors, and privacy and security. In each of these areas, we examine the current status and future promise, highlighting how each might reach its promise. Steps to better EHRs include a universal programming interface, universal patient identifiers, improved documentation and improved data analysis. HIEs require federal subsidies for sustainability and support from EHR vendors, targeting seamless sharing of EHR data. Patient portals must bring patients into the EHR with better design and training, greater provider engagement and leveraging HIEs. Telemedicine needs sustainable payment models, clear rules of engagement, quality measures and monitoring. Social media needs consensus on rules of engagement for providers, better data mining tools and approaches to counter disinformation. Mobile and wearable devices benefit from a universal programming interface, improved infrastructure, more rigorous research and integration with EHRs and HIEs. Laws for privacy and security need updating to match current <b>technologies,</b> and data <b>stewards</b> should share information on breaches and standardize best practices. ICT tools are evolving quickly in healthcare and require a rational and well-funded national agenda for development, use and assessment...|$|R
40|$|Operated by the Multiple Mirror Telescope Observatory (MMTO), the Multiple Mirror Telescope (MMT) {{is funded}} {{jointly by the}} Smithsonian Institution (SAO) and the University of Arizona (UA). The two {{organizations}} equally share observing time on the telescope. The MMT was dedicated in May 1979, and {{is located on the}} summit of Mt. Hopkins (at an altitude of 2. 6 -km), 64 -km south of Tucson, Arizona, at the Smithsonian Institution’s Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory (FLWO). As a result of advances in the <b>technology</b> at the <b>Steward</b> Observatory Mirror Laboratory for the casting of large and fast borosilicate honeycomb astronomical primary mirrors, in 1987 it was decided to convert the MMT from its six 1. 8 -m mirror array (effective aperture of 4. 5 -m) to a single 6. 5 -m diameter primary mirror telescope. This conversion will more than double the light gathering capacity, and will by design, increase the angular field of view by a factor of 15. Figure 1 depicts the conversion process. Because the site is already developed and the existing building and mount will be used with some modification, the conversion will be accomplished for only about $ 20 M. During 1995, several major technical milestones were reached: 1) the existing building was modified, 2) the major steel telescope structures were fabricated, and 3) the mirror blank was diamond wheel ground (generated). All major mechanical hardware required to affect the conversion is now nearly in hand. Once the primary mirror is polished and lab-tested on its support system, the six-mirror MMT will be taken out of service and the conversion process begun. W...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAs {{economic}} constraints leave fewer {{resources available}} for professional development, researchers and practitioners {{have become increasingly}} interested in the interplay between learning, community and technology. They are examining the potential of online communities of practice (CoP) to enhance and extend traditional professional development opportunities (Booth and Kellogg, 2014). They {{support the idea that}} participation in a learning community leads to change practice behaviours (Vescio, Roos & Adams, 2008). According to Booth and Kellogg (2014), in online CoP, practitioners “co construct new forms of meaning and understanding in ways that are individually and collectively valuable, and apply that knowledge in their professional practice” (p. 1). In addition, for supporting professional development opportunities and continuing education, e learning technology revolutionise learning and life-long learning for example, in supporting resources and guidelines for participation that are appealing and valuable for busy practitioners (Booth and Kellogg, 2014). The potential of e-learning technology is to extend professional development opportunities in terms of information and community resources available with the benefits of connectivity, flexibility and interactivity (Knight, 2004). E-learning technology should be seen as an interactive tool to support the active involvement of the learner with peers in sharing and creating new knowledge (Kurtz, 2014). Our project is to combine learning, community and e-learning technology in the health sector. This project is part of an European FP 7 training network, iCARE (improving Children’s Auditory Rehabilitation), which aims at training a community of people with different approaches and expertise in different fields and specializations. This community of people includes researchers, audiologists, educators, teachers, speech therapists, caregivers, parents and deaf children who are part of the same professional network. For the inclusion of children with hearing impairment in the oral society, they pursue – with different levels of expertise and experience – a common goal: the development of communication and social skills in these children. In that context, we aim to develop an online professional learning community (PLC) which will permit all members of that community – individually and collectively – to extend their professional and personal development opportunities through different types of e-learning activities, tools and interactions. This PLC, as a CoP will be characterized by the creation and sharing of user-generated materials, improving the auditory rehabilitation of children with hearing impairment. This PLC involving parents and other caregivers into the children’s learning experience will enable sustained mutual engagement of all professionals, allowing them to explore good practice, articulate perspectives, accumulate knowledge and create a shared context for ongoing exchanges (Vescio, Ross & Adams, 2005; Wenger, White and Smith, 2009).
