5|$|As {{soon as the}} Persian {{survivors}} had put to sea, the Athenians marched {{as quickly}} as possible <b>to</b> <b>Athens.</b> They arrived in time to prevent Artaphernes from securing a landing in Athens. Seeing his opportunity lost, Artaphernes ended the year's campaign and returned to Asia.|$|E
5|$|Having {{defeated}} the last immediate threat to Macedon, Philip returned to diplomacy. He released the Athenian prisoners immediately, and sent ambassadors <b>to</b> <b>Athens.</b> He {{was prepared to}} abandon all claim to Amphipolis, and this, coupled with his treatment of the Athenian prisoners, persuaded the Athenians {{to make peace with}} him.|$|E
5|$|In Megara, Neaira {{continued}} {{to work as a}} hetaera, and in 371 met Stephanus. Stephanus offered to act as her patron if she returned with him <b>to</b> <b>Athens.</b> Apollodorus claims that with her she brought two sons and a daughter <b>to</b> <b>Athens,</b> but modern commentators have largely concluded that the sons in question were in fact those of Stephanus, by an Athenian woman. Indeed, Christopher Carey points out that one of the sons, at least, was probably a legitimate son of Stephanus, being named after his father, and John Buckler notes that Apollodorus contradicts himself on whether Neaira's alleged sons were hers by another man, or hers by Stephanus.|$|E
5|$|Philip began besieging Amphipolis in 357 BC; the Amphipolitans, abandoning their anti-Athenian policy, {{promptly}} appealed <b>to</b> <b>Athens,</b> {{offering to}} return to its control. However, during the siege, Philip sent a letter <b>to</b> <b>Athens</b> saying that he would hand over the city once he captured it (thus appearing to follow the same policy as he had in 359 BC). The Athenians, thus lulled, waited to see whether he would. The Athenians {{may also have been}} unable to send help to Amphipolis. During the summer months, strong northerly winds blew into the Aegean Sea, making it difficult for the Athenians to send ships north. Philip was to make repeated use of the Etesian winds, campaigning during those months (or in winter), when the Athenian navy would be unable to send assistance to his enemies.|$|E
5|$|The {{action is}} {{preceded by a}} brief prologue, {{delivered}} by Apollo. Venus and Cupid are then discovered, in conversation, on a desolate seashore. Venus informs Cupid that Duke Theseus of Athens, together with Ariadne, will soon be arriving {{on the island of}} Naxos on their way <b>to</b> <b>Athens.</b> They are fleeing from Crete, where the pair have been complicit in the slaying of Ariadne's monster half-brother, the Minotaur, in the labyrinth below the palace of her father, King Minos. Venus is aware that Theseus intends to abandon Ariadne on Naxos, and to proceed <b>to</b> <b>Athens</b> alone. Cupid offers to rekindle Theseus's passion for Ariadne, but Venus has decided to unite her with the god Bacchus, and asks Cupid to arrange this.|$|E

The destroyer was broken up at Rosyth in April 1958.|$|E
5|$|Aristagoras {{had brought}} all of Hellenic Asia Minor into revolt, but evidently {{realised}} that the Greeks would need other allies {{in order to}} successfully fight the Persians. In the winter of 499 BC, he first sailed to Sparta, the pre-eminent Greek state in matters of war. However, despite Aristagoras's entreaties, the Spartan king Cleomenes I turned down the offer to lead the Greeks against the Persians. Aristagoras therefore turned instead <b>to</b> <b>Athens.</b>|$|E
5|$|Attalus was at {{that time}} {{corresponding}} with Demosthenes, regarding the possibility of defecting <b>to</b> <b>Athens.</b> Attalus also had severely insulted Alexander, and following Cleopatra's murder, Alexander may have considered him too dangerous to leave alive. Alexander spared Arrhidaeus, who was by all accounts mentally disabled, possibly as a result of poisoning by Olympias.|$|E
5|$|Chrysippus, {{the son of}} Apollonius of Tarsus, {{was born}} at Soli, Cilicia. He was slight in stature, and is reputed to have trained as a long-distance runner. While still young, he lost his {{substantial}} inherited property when it was confiscated to the king's treasury. Chrysippus moved <b>to</b> <b>Athens,</b> where he became the disciple of Cleanthes, {{who was then the}} head (scholarch) of the Stoic school. He is believed to have attended the courses of Arcesilaus and his successor Lacydes, in the Platonic Academy.|$|E
5|$|Cleomenes was {{not pleased}} with events, and marched on Athens with the Spartan army. Cleomenes's {{attempts}} to restore Isagoras <b>to</b> <b>Athens</b> ended in a debacle, but fearing the worst, the Athenians had by this point already sent an embassy to Artaphernes in Sardis, to request aid from the Persian empire. Artaphernes requested that the Athenians give him an 'earth and water', a traditional token of submission, to which the Athenian ambassadors acquiesced. They were, however, severely censured for this when they returned <b>to</b> <b>Athens.</b> At some later point Cleomenes instigated a plot to restore Hippias {{to the rule of}} Athens. This failed and Hippias again fled to Sardis and tried to persuade the Persians to subjugate Athens. The Athenians dispatched ambassadors to Artaphernes to dissuade him from taking action, but Artaphernes merely instructed the Athenians to take Hippias back as tyrant. The Athenians indignantly declined, and instead resolved to open war with Persia. Having thus become the enemy of Persia, Athens was already in a position to support the Ionian cities when they began their revolt. The fact that the Ionian democracies were inspired by the example the Athenians had set no doubt further persuaded the Athenians to support the Ionian Revolt, especially since the cities of Ionia were originally Athenian colonies.|$|E
5|$|En route <b>to</b> <b>Athens,</b> Revithi {{encountered}} a male runner along the road. He gave her money and advised her {{to run the}} marathon to become famous, and, consequently, earn money or more easily find a job. After this discussion Revithi decided to run the race: she had enjoyed long-distance running as a child, and believed she could beat the male competitors.|$|E
5|$|Historically, the Great Warrior Path of the Native Americans crossed Harveys Creek {{near its}} mouth. The path ran from Sunbury <b>to</b> <b>Athens.</b> In December 1775, a battle known as Plunkett's Battle was fought along the Susquehanna River {{very close to}} the creek. This battle was one of the major battles in the Yankee-Pennamite Wars.|$|E
5|$|In 1976, Tech {{students}} took the Wreck <b>to</b> <b>Athens</b> {{for the annual}} football game with UGA. After the game, the Wreck's police escort abandoned the car.

The Tech students responsible for the car's safekeeping frightened the encroaching Bulldog fans away by producing a concealed 9 mm pistol.|$|E
5|$|In 420 BC, {{he welcomed}} {{and set up}} an altar for the image of Asclepius at his house, when the deity was {{introduced}} <b>to</b> <b>Athens.</b> For this, {{he was given the}} posthumous epithet Dexion (receiver) by the Athenians. He was also elected, in 413 BC, one of the commissioners (probouloi) who responded to the catastrophic destruction of the Athenian expeditionary force in Sicily during the Peloponnesian War.|$|E

5|$|In a naval {{battle the}} Athenians led by Pericles and nine other generals {{defeated}} {{the forces of}} Samos and imposed on the island an Athenian administration. When the Samians revolted against Athenian rule, Pericles compelled the rebels to capitulate after a tough siege of eight months, which resulted in substantial discontent among the Athenian sailors. Pericles then quelled a revolt in Byzantium and, when he returned <b>to</b> <b>Athens,</b> gave a funeral oration to honor the soldiers {{who died in the}} expedition.|$|E
5|$|In the {{immediate}} aftermath of the battle, Herodotus says that the Persian fleet sailed around Cape Sounion to attack Athens directly. As has been discussed above, some modern historians place this attempt just before the battle. Either way, the Athenians evidently realised that their city was still under threat, and marched as quickly as possible back <b>to</b> <b>Athens.</b>|$|E
5|$|It {{was in the}} {{aftermath}} of these successes that Alcibiades resolved to finally return <b>to</b> <b>Athens</b> in the spring of 407 BC. Even {{in the wake of his}} recent victories, Alcibiades was exceedingly careful in his return, mindful of the changes in government, the charges still technically hanging over him, and the great injury he had done <b>to</b> <b>Athens.</b> Thus Alcibiades, instead of going straight home, first went to Samos to pick up 20 ships and proceeded with them to the Ceramic Gulf where he collected 100 talents. He finally sailed to Gytheion to make inquiries, partly about the reported preparations of the Spartans there, and partly about the feelings in Athens about his return. His inquiries assured him that the city was kindly disposed towards him and that his closest friends urged him to return.|$|E
5|$|Otto's early reign {{was also}} notable for his moving {{the capital of}} Greece from Nafplion <b>to</b> <b>Athens.</b> His first task as king {{was to make a}} {{detailed}} archaeological and topographic survey of Athens. He assigned Gustav Eduard Schaubert and Stamatios Kleanthis to complete this task. At that time, Athens had a population of roughly 4,000–5,000 people, located mainly in what today covers the district of Plaka in Athens.|$|E
5|$|Pericles {{wanted to}} {{stabilize}} Athens' dominance over its alliance and {{to enforce its}} pre-eminence in Greece. The {{process by which the}} Delian League transformed into an Athenian empire is generally considered to have begun well before Pericles' time, as various allies in the league chose to pay tribute <b>to</b> <b>Athens</b> instead of manning ships for the league's fleet, but the transformation was speeded and brought to its conclusion by Pericles.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after the}} news of this public tragedy reached Athens, a massive {{controversy}} erupted over the apportionment of blame for the botched rescue. The public was furious {{over the loss of}} so many sailors, and over the failure to recover the bodies of the dead for burial, and the generals suspected that Thrasybulus and Theramenes, who had already returned <b>to</b> <b>Athens,</b> might have been responsible for stirring up the assembly against them, and wrote letters to the people denouncing the two trierarchs as responsible for the failed rescue. Thrasybulus and Theramenes were called before the assembly to defend their behavior; in their defense, Theramenes produced a letter from the generals in which they blamed only the storm for the mishap; the trierarchs were exonerated, and public anger now turned against the generals. All eight were deposed from office, and summoned back <b>to</b> <b>Athens</b> to stand trial. Two fled, but six returned as commanded to face the charges against them.|$|E
5|$|The King's {{body was}} taken <b>to</b> <b>Athens</b> on the Amphitrite, escorted by a {{flotilla}} of naval vessels. For three days the coffin of the King, draped in the Danish and Greek flags, {{lay in the}} Metropolitan Cathedral in Athens before his body was committed to a tomb at his palace in Tatoi. Unlike his father, the new king, Constantine, was to prove less {{willing to accept the}} advice of ministers, or that of the three protecting powers (Britain, France and Russia).|$|E
5|$|The Oracle of Athens– An oracle {{that lived}} in Athens. Shocked at Athena's {{decision}} for choosing Kratos, the Oracle directed him to find Pandora's Box. Kratos later returned <b>to</b> <b>Athens</b> and found her mortally wounded due to Ares' war on the city. The character was voiced by Susan Blakeslee in God of War.|$|E
5|$|The {{course of}} events {{paved the way for}} Venizelos to return <b>to</b> <b>Athens</b> on 29 May 1917. Greece, now unified, officially joined the war {{on the side of the}} Allies. The entire Greek army was mobilized (though {{tensions}} remained inside the army between supporters of the Constantine and supporters of Venizelos) and began to participate in military operations against the Central Powers on the Macedonian front.|$|E
5|$|The final {{steps in}} the shift to empire may have been {{triggered}} by Athens' defeat in Egypt, which challenged the city's dominance in the Aegean {{and led to the}} revolt of several allies, such as Miletus and Erythrae. Either because of a genuine fear for its safety after the defeat in Egypt and the revolts of the allies, or as a pretext to gain control of the League's finances, Athens transferred the treasury of the alliance from Delos <b>to</b> <b>Athens</b> in 454–453BC.|$|E
5|$|Theramenes' first {{appearance}} in the historical record comes with {{his involvement in the}} oligarchic coup of 411 BC. In the wake of the Athenian defeat in Sicily, revolts began to break out among Athens' subject states in the Aegean Sea and the Peace of Nicias fell apart; the Peloponnesian War resumed in full by 412 BC. In this context, a number of Athenian aristocrats, led by Peisander and with Theramenes prominent among their ranks, began to conspire to overthrow the city's democratic government. This intrigue was initiated by the exiled nobleman Alcibiades, who was at that time acting as an assistant to the Persian satrap Tissaphernes. Claiming that he had great influence with Tissaphernes, Alcibiades promised to return <b>to</b> <b>Athens,</b> bringing Persian support with him, if the democracy that had exiled him were replaced with an oligarchy. Accordingly, a number of trierarchs and other leaders of the Athenian army at Samos began planning the overthrow of the democracy. They eventually dispatched Peisander <b>to</b> <b>Athens,</b> where, by promising that the return of Alcibiades and an alliance with Persia would follow if the Athenians would replace their democracy with an oligarchy, he persuaded the Athenian ecclesia to send him as an emissary to Alcibiades, authorized to make whatever arrangements were necessary.|$|E
5|$|When the Athenians {{received}} this news, they rapidly changed policy. If Thermopylae {{could no longer}} be defended, then Athenian security {{could no longer be}} guaranteed. By the end of February, the Athenians had dispatched an embassy, including Philocrates, Demosthenes and Aeschines, to Philip to discuss peace between Athens and Macedon. The embassy had two audiences with Philip, in which each side presented their proposals for the terms of the peace settlement. The embassy then returned <b>to</b> <b>Athens</b> to present the proposed terms to the Athenian Assembly, along with a Macedonian embassy <b>to</b> <b>Athens,</b> empowered by Philip to finalize an agreement. The Athenians debated the peace treaty in April and tried to propose a common peace in which all Greek states could partake (including Phocis). However, Demosthenes (at this point a strong proponent of peace) persuaded the Assembly that Philip would never agree to such a peace, and that Athens's vulnerable position meant that they {{had little choice but to}} accept Philip's terms. On 23 April, the Athenians made swore to the terms of the treaty which is now known as the Peace of Philocrates in the presence of the Macedonian ambassadors. Amongst the principal terms were that Athens become Philip's ally, and that they forever renounce their claim to Amphipolis.|$|E
5|$|According to Herodotus, an Athenian runner named Pheidippides {{was sent}} to run from Athens to Sparta to ask for {{assistance}} before the battle. He ran a distance of over 225 kilometers (140 miles), arriving in Sparta {{the day after he}} left. Then, following the battle, the Athenian army marched the 40 kilometers (25 miles) or so back <b>to</b> <b>Athens</b> at a very high pace (considering the quantity of armour, and the fatigue after the battle), in order to head off the Persian force sailing around Cape Sounion. They arrived back in the late afternoon, {{in time to see the}} Persian ships turn away from Athens, thus completing the Athenian victory.|$|E
5|$|As Alcibiades had suspected, {{his absence}} emboldened his enemies, {{and they began}} to accuse him of other sacrilegious actions and {{comments}} and even alleged that these actions were connected with a plot against the democracy. According to Thucydides, the Athenians were always in fear and took everything suspiciously. When the fleet arrived in Catana, it found the state trireme Salaminia waiting to bring Alcibiades and the others indicted for mutilating the hermai or profaning the Eleusinian Mysteries back <b>to</b> <b>Athens</b> to stand trial. Alcibiades told the heralds that he would follow them back <b>to</b> <b>Athens</b> in his ship, but in Thurii he escaped with his crew; in Athens he was convicted in absentia and condemned to death. His property was confiscated and a reward of one talent was promised to whoever succeeded in killing any who had fled. Meanwhile, the Athenian force in Sicily, after a few early victories, moved against Messina, where the Generals expected their secret allies within the city to betray it to them. Alcibiades, however, foreseeing that he would be outlawed, gave information to the friends of the Syracusans in Messina, who succeeded in preventing the admission of the Athenians. With the death of Lamachus in battle some time later, command of the Sicilian Expedition fell into the hands of Nicias, whom modern scholars have judged to be an inadequate military leader.|$|E
5|$|Cleomenes, unsurprisingly, was {{not pleased}} with events, and marched on Athens with the Spartan army. Cleomenes's {{attempts}} to restore Isagoras <b>to</b> <b>Athens</b> ended in a debacle, but fearing the worst, the Athenians had by this point already sent an embassy to Artaphernes in Sardis, to request aid from the Persian Empire. Artaphernes requested that the Athenians give him a 'earth and water', a traditional token of submission, which the Athenian ambassadors acquiesced to. However, they were severely censured for this when they returned <b>to</b> <b>Athens.</b> At some point later Cleomenes instigated a plot to restore Hippias {{to the rule of}} Athens. This failed and Hippias again fled to Sardis and tried to persuade the Persians to subjugate Athens. The Athenians dispatched ambassadors to Artaphernes to dissuade him from taking action, but Artaphernes merely instructed the Athenians to take Hippias back as tyrant. Needless to say, the Athenians balked at this, and resolved instead to be openly at war with Persia. Having thus become the enemy of Persia, Athens was already in a position to support the Ionian cities when they began their revolt. The fact that the Ionian democracies were inspired by the example of Athens no doubt further persuaded the Athenians to support the Ionian Revolt; especially since the cities of Ionia were (supposedly) originally Athenian colonies.|$|E
5|$|Historical sources {{confirm that}} the Macedonian kings before Philip II at least upheld the {{privileges}} and responsibilities of hosting foreign diplomats, initiating the kingdom's foreign policies, and negotiating deals such as alliances with foreign powers. After the Greek victory at Salamis in 480 BC, the Persian commander Mardonius had Alexander I of Macedon sent <b>to</b> <b>Athens</b> as a chief envoy to orchestrate an alliance between the Achaemenid Empire and Athens. The decision to send Alexander was based on his marriage alliance with a noble Persian house and his previous formal relationship with the city-state of Athens. With their ownership of natural resources including gold, silver, timber, and royal land, the early Macedonian kings were also capable of bribing foreign and domestic parties with impressive gifts.|$|E
5|$|Holloman {{was born}} in Thomaston, Georgia, and moved <b>to</b> <b>Athens,</b> Georgia with his family when he was 17. In Athens, he met Nan Stevens, the two were married on January 24, 1942, and they later had one son. He served as a Seabee for the United States Navy during World War II. After {{returning}} from the war, Holloman became an apprentice in a machine shop for the Georgia Railroad in Macon, Georgia. While working there, he played amateur baseball, and did well enough for his colleagues to convince him {{to try out for}} the Macon Peaches, the local baseball team. He did so, and he was assigned to the Class D Moultrie Packers, where he began his professional career.|$|E
5|$|In 1946, Hensley {{married for}} the third time, but his wife, Inez Hutcheson, left him after {{less than a year}} of marriage. After their separation, Hensley began to preach in Chattanooga. During services, he began asserting that he had been {{miraculously}} healed after being paralyzed for a year following a coal-mining accident. Kimbrough disputes his claim, noting that there is no one-year gap in the records of Hensley moving or actively ministering. Hensley continued to live in Chattanooga until the early 1950s; he moved <b>to</b> <b>Athens,</b> Georgia, in the early to mid-1950s.|$|E
5|$|In 344BC Demosthenes {{travelled}} to the Peloponnese, {{in order}} to detach as many cities as possible from Macedon's influence, but his efforts were generally unsuccessful. Most of the Peloponnesians saw Philip as the guarantor of their freedom and sent a joint embassy <b>to</b> <b>Athens</b> to express their grievances against Demosthenes' activities. In response, Demosthenes delivered the Second Philippic, a vehement attack against Philip. In 343BC Demosthenes delivered On the False Embassy against Aeschines, who was facing a charge of high treason. Nonetheless, Aeschines was acquitted by the narrow margin of thirty votes by a jury which may have numbered as many as 1,501.* D. M. MacDowell, Demosthenes the Orator, ch. 12 (in fine).|$|E
