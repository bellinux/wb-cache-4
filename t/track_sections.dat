5|$|Although a {{crossing}} loop {{was installed}} at Caringbah Station and Gymea Station when {{the line was}} opened, the single track line prevented the expansion of services to the Cronulla peninsula, and so in the 1980s {{it was decided to}} duplicate a 3.5 kilometre section of the line between Gymea and Caringbah, with Gymea. Miranda and Caringbah all receiving island platforms. The new section was opened on 15 July 1985. In the 2000s, the remaining single <b>track</b> <b>sections</b> were duplicated. These opened on 19 April 2010.|$|E
5|$|Each of Hollywood Dream's 5 trains carry 36 {{riders in}} nine coaches, each having {{a row of}} four seats. All trains have an {{on-board}} audio and lighting system, with each seat having a headrest stereo sound system capable of playing one of five songs selected by the rider with a control panel inserted into the seat's restraining lap bar. The on-board audio and lighting system animates LED lights that are built into the trains' sides and front riderless pilot coach. The lighting program varies as the train moves, with different animations for different <b>track</b> <b>sections</b> and the station. The lighting pattern used for the park entrance track section gives {{the effect of a}} Comet with a sparkling head and glittering trail of light.|$|E

5|$|In 2009 the Welsh Assembly Government asked Network Rail {{to conduct}} {{feasibility}} studies on two former track stretches in Wales, {{one of those}} being the line from Bangor to Llangefni. Councillor Clive McGregor was optimistic this could provide an economic stimulus for Anglesey, along with further proposals to extend passenger traffic between Llangefni and Amlwch. In 2011 Network Rail began work on gathering evidence for its study, beginning with cutting away vegetation on <b>track</b> <b>sections</b> to examine the condition of rails and track bedding.

25|$|Railway {{operations}} are vulnerable during high winds {{and there have}} been several de-wirements over the years due to the unusually wide spacing (up to 75 m) between the supporting masts of the overhead lines. The other cost-reduction measure was the use of headspan catenary support systems over the quadruple <b>track</b> <b>sections</b> – as employed in the Weaver Junction to Glasgow Electrification on the WCML during the 1970s. Headspans do not have mechanically independent registration (MIR) of each electrified road and thus are more complex to set up, compared to TTC (two-track cantilever) and portal style support structures, during installation. In the event of a de-wirement of a given road, headspans result in the need to correctly set up the OLE of adjacent roads before the line can reopen to electric traction. This was a result of extreme pressure from the Department for Transport to reduce avoidable costs when the line was originally electrified between 1985 and 1990.|$|E
25|$|The Spirit of Progress {{ushered in}} a {{standard}} of passenger train speed and comfort not previously seen in Australia. Its introduction in November 1937 marked the culmination of many years of preparatory work by the Victorian Railways, from the laying of heavier rail on the North East line, introduction of Automatic Staff Exchange apparatus to allow continuous high speed running between <b>track</b> <b>sections,</b> introduction of high-powered three-cylinder Pacific locomotives, and the testing of air conditioning equipment on passenger rolling stock. Such was the commitment of VR Chief Commissioner Harold Clapp to introducing a world-class train service to Victorian Railways, virtually no detail was overlooked. VR engineers famously road-tested the new train's smoothness on curves by studying a full bowl of soup in the dining car as the train took curves at full speed; if the soup splashed {{over the side of}} the bowl a decision would be taken whether to modify the curve for higher speeds or reduce the speed limit for the curve. Harold Clapp could not, however, take credit for the name for the service; when discussing with his wife his proposed Royal Victorian name (inspired by the LMS Royal Scot), Mrs Clapp suggested, on the spur of the moment, Spirit of Progress.|$|E

500|$|On May 8, 2007, {{four days}} before Maverick was {{scheduled}} to debut, park general manager John Hildebrant announced that the ride would be delayed until early June because three [...] <b>track</b> <b>sections</b> after the second launch needed to be replaced. [...] These sections made up the heartline roll element and put excessive stress on the trains, which also might have caused discomfort to passengers due to high g-forces. On May 17, 2007, the heartline roll was removed and was replaced with an s-curve. The s-curve transitions the existing track from a banked right curve to a banked left curve. Installation of the s-curve was completed on May 24 and final testing and licensing of the attraction resumed. [...] On the same day, Cedar Point officials also announced that Maverick would debut on May 26.|$|E

500|$|The SP {{was formed}} {{jointly by the}} Northern Pacific Railway (NP) and Great Northern Railway in 1905, {{originally}} as the Portland & Seattle Railway, to build and ultimately operate new railroad lines connecting Portland with Seattle and with Spokane, but was renamed Spokane, Portland & Seattle Railway in early 1908, before opening any <b>track</b> <b>sections.</b> The planned new railroad was {{commonly referred to as}} the [...] "North Bank road" [...] (road being short for railroad or railroad line), or North Bank line, because the Seattle line would follow the Columbia River's north bank as far as Kelso and the Spokane line would also follow the north bank, running east from Vancouver. East from Portland, the south bank of the Columbia already had a rail line, owned by the Oregon Railroad and Navigation Company (later absorbed by Union Pacific Railroad).|$|E

There are two running lines, roughly oriented east-west, but curving towards the north at both ends. There are two -long platforms to the north and south of the running lines, connected by a footbridge at the east end. The southern platform, Platform 1, serves trains towards , the northern platform, Platform 2, serves trains towards Temple Meads. The station is in an enclosed cutting, and runs under the road to the east. To the west is the Clifton Down Tunnel under Clifton Down, from which the station takes its name. The station {{is one of the few}} double <b>track</b> <b>sections</b> of the Severn Beach Line, and so is often used as a passing place.|$|E
500|$|On the moors, when dried turves {{were ready}} to be collected, {{temporary}} <b>track</b> <b>sections</b> were laid {{at right angles to}} the main line, and a portable turntable was installed. A rake of twelve wagons could then be moved onto the temporary track, one at a time, to be filled by a 'filling gang'. Each wagon held about a ton, and once all twelve had been manoeuvred over the turntable back onto the main line, they would be pulled to the works by horses. With the advent of the small Lister engines, a new system was used, where three curved sections of track were used, the end one being clipped onto the top of the main line track. The engines could then push a line of forty or fifty wagons onto the temporary track. Cutting of the peat was mechanised from 1963, with the introduction of German peat-cutting machines, and by 1970, all hand cutting had ceased. Loading of the turves into wagons was also initially by hand, but gradually 'sod collectors' were introduced, which at Swinefleet had a [...] conveyor and at Hatfield a [...] one. These enabled a single side track to serve a much wider section of moor, without having to move the track. Loading turves onto the start of the conveyor was still done manually, but it became difficult to find people who wanted to do the work, and so Hymac loaders were used to load peat directly into the wagons. The success of this process at Hatfield in 1981 lead to it being used at Swinefleet as well.|$|E
