Engelbart saw the future in collaborative, networked, <b>timeshare</b> (client-server) computers, which younger programmers rejected in favor of the personal computer. The conflict was both technical and ideological: the younger programmers came from an era where centralized power was highly suspect, and personal computing was just barely on the horizon.|$|E

50|$|The {{profitable}} <b>timesharing</b> business {{started to}} deteriorate in mid-1982, as some key <b>timesharing</b> clients moved their operations from <b>timesharing</b> to in-house Sharp APL. Around that time, IBM started offering smaller mainframe computers, {{such as the}} IBM 4300 series, which could be leased {{for less than the}} cost of using external services. Clients who did not depend on the network were the first to migrate to small mainframes. Initially, the presence of the IBM PC posed little threat to the <b>timesharing</b> industry as the computing horsepower and storage capacity offered by these small machines was insufficient. As a major slice of Sharp's business was buttressed by database business, this had the beneficial effect of delaying the eventual downslide. STSC started to feel the effects of the deteriorating <b>timesharing</b> market one or two years earlier.|$|R
40|$|This {{experiment}} {{identifies the}} contribution of <b>timesharing</b> skills to performance on two qualita-tively different task combinations. To examine this contribution, a measurement technique was de-veloped which partitioned improvement in multiple-task performance into a comoonent due to improved single-task skills and a component due to improved <b>timesharing</b> skills. Transfer of <b>timesharing</b> skills between the task combinations also was examined. The results indicated that identifiable <b>timesharing</b> skills developed with practice and contributed significantly to performance on both task combinations. Evidence of transfer of <b>timesharing</b> skills also was found. The implications of the results for training are discussed. BACKGROUND Because of recent increases in aircraft operating costs, training in simulators inceas-ingly is being substituted for training in the aircraft. However, many modern simulators {{have been designed to}} reflect the complexity of mod-ern flight missions and airborne systems and, as such, ore costly devices to own and operate. Therefore, it is of some interest to minimize the traini. ng time spent on these devices. One way of minimizing the cost of such training is to use the simulator only for training skills which cannot be learned effectively on less expensive devices, such as part-task trainers or mock-ups. Adams (1961) has suggested that whole-task training often is necessary to allow the trainee to develop skills in <b>timesharing</b> the component tasks. If distinct <b>timesharing</b> skills are learned during whole-task training, then simulator training should be structured to per-mit the most rapid development possible of these skills. Other skills which do not require whole-task training should be taught on less expensive devices. However, if <b>timesharing</b> skills are general skills, the amount of simulator training needed to reach some performance criterion could be reduced further by developing relatively in-expensive training devices for <b>timesharing</b> skills. Training on these devices could be sub-stituted for training on the more expensive simulators. To date, {{there is little evidence that}} iden-tifiable <b>timesharing</b> skills are learned or that such skills are generalizable. Bahrick an...|$|R

25|$|Today, {{tourism is}} {{estimated}} to account for 85% of the islands' income. The islands {{have been successful in}} attracting this investment due to their special environment, favourable summer climate, relaxed culture, efficient co-ordination of tourism providers and good transport links by sea and air to the mainland, uncommon in scale to similar-sized island communities. The majority of visitors stay on St Mary's, which has a concentration of holiday accommodation and other amenities. Of the other inhabited islands, Tresco is run as a <b>timeshare</b> resort, and is consequently the most obviously tourist-oriented.

25|$|The {{victory was}} {{important}} {{for the preservation of}} the French Quarter, but it was hardly the only challenge. Throughout the 1960s, new hotels opened regularly, often replacing large sections of the French Quarter. The VCC approved these structures as long as their designers adhered to prevailing exterior styles. Detractors, fearing that the Vieux Carré's charm might be compromised by the introduction of too many new inns, lobbied successfully for passage in 1969 of a municipal ordinance that forbade new hotels within the district's boundaries. However, the ordinance failed to stop the proliferation of <b>timeshare</b> condominiums and clandestine bed and breakfast inns throughout the French Quarter or high-rise hotels just outside its boundaries. In the 1980s, many long-term residents were driven away by rising rents, as property values rose dramatically with expectations of windfalls from the planned 1984 World's Fair.|$|E
