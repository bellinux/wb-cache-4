25|$|In 1976, Morinobu Endo of CNRS {{observed}} hollow {{tubes of}} rolled up graphite sheets synthesised by a chemical vapour-growth technique. The first specimens observed would later {{come to be}} known as single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs). Endo, in his early review of vapor-phase-grown carbon fibers (VPCF), also reminded us that he had observed a hollow tube, linearly extended with parallel carbon layer faces near the fiber core. This appears to be the observation of multi-walled carbon nanotubes at the center of the fiber. The mass-produced MWCNTs today are strongly related to the VPGCF developed by Endo. In fact, <b>they</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> <b>the</b> “Endo-process”, out of respect for his early work and patents.|$|E
25|$|Settled {{mostly by}} American {{migrants}} from New York and New England, Monroe later became associated with {{events in the}} West in the later 19th century, particularly the Indian Wars. It {{is known as the}} childhood home of Major General George Armstrong Custer (1839–1876). His family moved here when he was young, and he lived in Monroe for much of his childhood. Here he later met and in 1864 married Elizabeth Bacon (1842–1933), during the Civil War. He led troops in the Indian Wars and died at the Battle of the Little Bighorn, in which his forces were killed by the Lakota. <b>They</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> <b>the</b> Battle of the Greasy Grass.|$|E

2500|$|The Latinised {{faction of}} the St. Thomas Christians have {{accepted}} the Persian cross as their symbol. [...] <b>They</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> <b>the</b> Nasrani Menorah [...] or Mar Thoma Sliba. There are several interpretations for the Latinised St. Thomas Christian Symbol. The interpretation based on Christian Jewish tradition assumes that its design was based on Jewish menorah, an ancient symbol of the Hebrews, which consists of seven branched lamp stand (candelabra).|$|E
2500|$|At a Miracle Club {{meeting on}} 7 September 1875, Blavatsky, Olcott, and Judge agreed to {{establish}} an esoteric organisation, with Charles Sotheran suggesting that <b>they</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> <b>the</b> Theosophical Society. The term theosophy came from the Greek theos ("god(s)") and sophia ("wisdom"), thus meaning [...] "god-wisdom" [...] or [...] "divine wisdom". The term was not new, but had been previously used in various contexts by the Philaletheians and the Christian mystic Jakob Böhme. Theosophists would often argue over how to define Theosophy, with Judge expressing {{the view that the}} task was impossible. Blavatsky however insisted that Theosophy was not a religion in itself. Lachman has described the movement as [...] "a very wide umbrella, under which quite a few things could find a place".|$|E

The CIO is in the saddle and the Democrat donkey, under whip and spur, is meekly taking the road to communism and atheism. ... Everybody knows that Roosevelt is the Communist candidate, but even the Communists cannot be sure where their place will be [...] if he wins. His purpose is to overthrow the Republic for his own selfish ambitions [...] it is the duty of every American to oppose The Great Deceiver [...]|$|E
2500|$|Instead of Cambridge, Byron {{originally}} {{wanted to}} go to Christ Church, Oxford but there were no vacancies. Instead, he chose Cambridge at Drury's recommendation. The choice did not matter, since college life in general did not suit his personality. He wrote in his diary, [...] "I was so completely alone in this new world that it half broke my spirits... It was one of the deadliest and heaviest feelings of my life that I was no longer a boy". However, this did not mitigate his contempt towards the other students, and he quickly grew dissatisfied with the society surrounding Cambridge: [...] "It is the Devil or at least his principal residence. <b>They</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> <b>the</b> University, but any other appellation would have suited it better, for Study is the last pursuit of the Society".|$|E

Meanwhile rightwing Judeophobes often talk of a leftist Jewish conspiracy to promote equality and human rights through a new internationalism embodied in the UN in order to control governments and suppress national sovereignty. <b>They</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> <b>the</b> ‘New World Order’ or the ‘Jew World Order’.

[...] The video was released on May 11, 2010, on Drake's blog and on MTV. In an interview with MTV News the video's director, Anthony Mandler said, [...] "Part of the objective of making this video was to do that same twist again, to give you something unexpected, not only tonality with the song but with the video thematically. It's kind of like the anti-love love story. It's really about crossing lines, what was said in the first scene. It's about really understanding what's right and what's wrong and it's really easy to lose that when you're the center of attention. He did it fearlessly, he did it without any sign of hesitation. He wanted to do something that went further with the song, that took the essence of the song but communicated it with imagery that made people think, rather than go up the middle and make an obvious R video." ...|$|E
