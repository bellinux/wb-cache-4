5|$|Prior to opening, {{the flower}} buds are enveloped and {{protected}} {{in a thin}} dry papery or membranous (scarious) spathe.

Bracteoles are small or absent.|$|E
5|$|Tooth {{development}} is commonly divided {{into the following}} stages: <b>the</b> <b>bud</b> stage, the cap, the bell, and finally maturation. The staging of tooth {{development is}} an attempt to categorize changes that take place along a continuum; frequently it is difficult to decide what stage should be assigned to a particular developing tooth. This determination is further complicated by the varying appearance of different histologic sections of the same developing tooth, which can appear to be different stages.|$|E

40|$|Proteasome inhibitors reduce <b>the</b> <b>budding</b> {{of human}} {{immunodeficiency}} virus types 1 (HIV- 1) and 2, simian immunodeficiency virus, and Rous sarcoma virus.

We found that proteasome inhibition decreased <b>the</b> <b>budding</b> of murine leukemia virus (plasma membrane assembly, PPPY L domain) and Mason-Pfizer monkey virus (cytoplasmic assembly, PPPY L domain), similar to the reduction observed for HIV- 1. Thus, proteasome inhibitors can affect <b>the</b> <b>budding</b> of a virus that assembles within the cytoplasm.

25|$|Along {{with the}} {{formation}} of the dental lamina, 10 round epithelial structures, each referred to as a bud, develop at the distal aspect of the dental lamina of each arch. These correspond to the 10 primary teeth of each dental arch, and they signify <b>the</b> <b>bud</b> stage of tooth development. Each bud is separated from the ectomesenchyme by a basement membrane. Ectomesenchymal cells congregate deep to <b>the</b> <b>bud,</b> forming a cluster of cells, which is the initiation of the condensation of the ectomesenchyme. The remaining ectomesenchymal cells are arranged in a more or less haphazardly uniform fashion.|$|E

40|$|The {{immunological}} relatedness of {{the structural}} proteins of <b>the</b> <b>budded</b> and occluded phenotypes of Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus was examined by reciprocal immunoblotting and by in situ peroxidase-antiperoxidase staining of virus-induced cell surface and intracellular antigens with antisera to both phenotypes. The molecular weights (MWs) of major structural proteins of both phenotypes that reciprocally cross-reacted were 92, 500, 78, 000, 62, 500, 54, 000, and 42, 000. A highly immunogenic, major structural protein of the occluded phenotype of 46, 000 MW was not recognized by antiserum to <b>the</b> <b>budded</b> phenotype, and a major structural protein of <b>the</b> <b>budded</b> phenotype, 48, 000 MW, was not recognized by antiserum to the occluded phenotype. Both <b>the</b> <b>budded</b> and occluded phenotypes contained a protein of 33, 500 MW that comigrated with polyhedrin (the matrix protein) and reacted with antiserum and monoclonal antibody to polyhedrin. Evidence was obtained for the apparent antigenic relatedness of proteins of different MWs from <b>the</b> <b>budded</b> and occluded phenotypes, possibly indicative of different processing of some proteins for the two phenotypes. Antiserum to the occluded phenotype recognized virus-induced cell surface antigens, indicating antigenic similarities between the occluded phenotype and envelope proteins of <b>the</b> <b>budded</b> phenotype.

25|$|These are basal, {{emerging}} from the bulb initially enclosed in a tubular membranous sheath of cataphylls. These are generally two (sometimes three) and linear, strap-shaped or oblanceolate. Vernation, {{the arrangement of the}} emerging leaves relative to each other, varies between species. These may be applanate (flat), supervolute (conduplicate) or explicative (pleated). In applanate vernation the two leaf blades are pressed flat to each other within <b>the</b> <b>bud</b> and as they emerge; explicative leaves are also pressed flat against each other, but the edges of the leaves are folded back (externally recurved) or sometimes rolled; in supervolute plants one leaf is tightly clasped around the other within <b>the</b> <b>bud</b> and generally remains {{at the point where the}} leaves emerge from the soil (for illustration, see Stearn and Davis). In the past, this feature has been used to distinguish between species and to determine the parentage of hybrids but has been shown to be homoplasious, and not useful in this regard.|$|E

In yeast cultures growing more slowly, cells lacking buds can be seen, and bud formation only occupies a part of the cell cycle.|$|E
