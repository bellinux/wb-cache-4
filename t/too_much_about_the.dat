25|$|On April 17 in Mexico City, {{the police}} raided one of Constanzo's {{properties}} in Atizapán. They discovered piles of homosexual pornography and a hidden ritual chamber with an altar. This prompted {{the police to}} question people in Mexico City's homosexual community {{to see if they}} had any leads on Constanzo's whereabouts. The Mexican police stated that no evidence was found at the scene to link Constanzo or his men to any murders committed there. They said they saw altars and other ritualistic belongings, but did not find any traces of blood. No men were arrested at the scene, but the police managed to arrest a lady called María Teresa Quintana Rodríguez, sister of one of Constanzo's lovers and henchmen. The police also discovered that Aldrete's purse and other belongings were left behind, which prompted them to conclude that Constanzo probably murdered her because she knew <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> inner workings of his cult group. The police stated that they did not see Aldrete with the group when they arrived in Mexico City. They thought that Constanzo might have buried her somewhere in the city. U.S. authorities, however, believed that Aldrete purposely left her belongings behind to confuse investigators and make it appear that she was dead. On April 24, the police arrested Víctor Manuel Antúnez Flores and Salvador Antonio Villaluz, who were hiding in one of Constanzo's properties in Juárez neighborhood.|$|E

500|$|The Chicago Tribunes Sid Smith {{found the}} film to be [...] "pretty lousy, despite a wealth of {{impressive}} special effects that end with {{an image of a}} completely demolished Chicago skyline." [...] He found the plot to be overly melodramatic and [...] "hokey" [...] with an excessive amount of coincidences and ill-fortunes thrown at the characters, despite the performances of the star-studded cast. Australia's The Age gave the film a slightly more favorable review, praising the stunts and special effects, though it noted the effects suffer from poor computer editing and referred to the film as [...] "a little entertaining supertrash" [...] that does require one to not think <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> science to enjoy.|$|E

[...] In 2006, he reaffirmed his previous statements and further opined, [...] "When I was growing up, if I liked , I listened to it — and I went to the shows. If I didn't, I didn't.

According to Ohba, after {{the disappearance of}} Sidoh, the writer [...] "struggled" [...] with Mello's role.

As a result, Ohba did not give Mello a [...] "large role" [...] at the conclusion of Death Note and instead had Mello negatively affect Light [...] "indirectly". Ohba gave Mello a [...] "very plain" [...] death, depicted in only one panel; he felt that if Mello had perished [...] "dramatically" [...] it would reveal the truth behind his death.|$|E

500|$|Critics {{generally}} responded {{positively to}} [...] "A Quiet Night In". David Chater, writing for The Times, gave a highly laudatory review, saying the episode was [...] "the funniest, cleverest, most imaginative and original television I have seen {{for as long}} as I can remember– one of those fabulous programmes where time stands still and the world around you disappears". He chose not to reveal <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> plot for fear of [...] "spoiling the fun". Chater later described the episode as [...] "mindboggling in its originality", and [...] "one of the funniest, most imaginative programmes shown on television in the past 15 years". Jane Simon, writing for the Daily Mirror, called the episode a [...] "triumph", while writers for Metro described the episode as [...] "quality comedy", and journalists writing for The Sunday Times characterised it as a [...] "brilliantly conceived and choreographed mime". Jack Seale, writing for the Radio Times, also stressed how the episode was [...] "beautifully choreographed", praising Pemberton and Shearsmith's [...] "willingness to attempt difficult concepts".|$|E
500|$|The Genesis planet {{became a}} doomed {{experiment}} partly for dramatic reasons; having {{a time limit}} for the characters to save Spock added tension. Nimoy was also interested in scientific ethics—how quickly can science move {{and what are the}} dangers of that movement. University of Houston professor Dr. John Hansen notes that while Spock's sacrifice in The Wrath of Khan is the [...] "archetype of reason and rationality manifesting the archetype of human virtue," [...] a selfless and freely-made choice, the death of Valkris (who has learned <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Genesis Device) in The Search for Spock is far different: the Klingon willingly accepts her death for the [...] "common good" [...] as determined by the state, relinquishing her liberty and life. Hansen contends that the issues of personal liberty and the exploitation of technology, in this case Genesis, are [...] "intertwined". The Genesis Device was intended as a liberating technology, creating life from lifelessness, but in the Klingon view it is a tool for dominion (contrasting the contemporary views of how technology can promote or constrain liberty).|$|E

Instead of 8...b6 a more adventurous black player could choose 8...Qe7 9.Bd3 f5!? as indicated by Borik, Tseitlin and Lalic, but in his more recent book Moskalenko thinks [...] "this move complicates the game too much".

500|$|The win marked Liverpool's third {{consecutive}} victory against Manchester United, but despite this, manager Houllier refused to get carried away: [...] "At the moment I am worried because the team which {{has won the}} Charity Shield {{in recent years has}} not won the title, I don't think you can draw conclusions from this match." [...] Man of the match Sander Westerveld echoed similar sentiments: [...] "It doesn't say <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> season. Last year Chelsea beat them 2-0 and had high expectations. We played well and it's a good result but it doesn't say anything about the Championship." [...] Questions were asked about the exclusion of striker Robbie Fowler from the match-day squad, with Houllier confirming the striker had been left out after a training ground bust-up with assistant manager Phil Thompson: [...] "It is a regrettable moment for the team and the club but I'm sure at some stage common sense will prevail. I am leaving it to him. I brokered a get-together between Phil and Robbie, which I attended at the beginning. Then I left the two Scousers together. But so far it has been unsuccessful." [...] Houllier added that he had tried to resolve the issue {{before the start of the}} match: [...] "I waited until the Sunday lunchtime before the Charity Shield game. I again insisted yesterday. I took them together again. I think at some stage it will be solved. I am a patient man." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1993, {{at the age}} of 12, Gosling {{attended}} an open audition in Montreal for a revival of Disney Channel's The Mickey Mouse Club. He was given a two-year contract as a mouseketeer and moved to Orlando, Florida. He appeared on-screen infrequently because other children were considered more talented. Nonetheless, he has described the job as the greatest two years of his life. Fellow cast members included Justin Timberlake, Britney Spears, and Christina Aguilera. Gosling has credited the experience with instilling in them [...] "this great sense of focus." [...] He became particularly close friends with Timberlake and they lived together for six months during the second year of the show. Timberlake's mother became Gosling's legal guardian after his mother returned to Canada for work reasons. Gosling has said that, even though he and Timberlake are no longer in touch, they are still supportive of each other. Following the show's cancellation in 1995, Gosling returned to Canada and continued to appear in family entertainment television series including Are You Afraid of the Dark? (1995), Goosebumps (1996) and starred in Breaker High (1997–98) as Sean Hanlon. At the age of 18, he moved to New Zealand to film the Fox Kids adventure series Young Hercules (1998–1999) as the title character. In 2002, he told the Vancouver Sun that he initially enjoyed working on the show, but began to care <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> series, so it was no longer fun for him. He wanted to spend more time sitting with and devising a character as well as play a variety of roles, so he chose to enter film and not accept any more television work.|$|E
500|$|Manchester City's {{downward}} trajectory {{toward the}} Second Division {{continued in the}} 1997–98 season, and on 17 February 1998, manager Frank Clark was sacked. His replacement, Joe Royle, was appointed City manager on 18 February 1998. He {{had a reputation for}} playing defensive midfielders, which led to his Everton team being nicknamed the [...] "Dogs of War". Royle viewed Kinkladze as an unaffordable luxury in a relegation battle, and in his first board meeting as Manchester City manager, he opened proceedings with the words [...] "We have to sell Kinkladze". After playing the first two games under Royle, a 1–2 loss on 18 February against Ipswich Town, and a 3–1 win against Swindon Town on 23 February, [...] Kinkladze sustained an ankle injury, which sidelined him for a month. He made his return at Port Vale on 14 March, despite having taken little part in training in the preceding week. Port Vale were a team with a physically robust approach, and used the muddy conditions to their advantage. Kinkladze was played out of position on the right wing, much to his displeasure, and gave a performance that the Manchester Evening News summarised as [...] "barely noticeable". Vale defeated City 2–1, and Royle severely criticised Kinkladze for a lack of effort, dropping him for the next six games. In 2005, Royle explained his view of Kinkladze in his autobiography: [...] "To the supporters he was the only positive in all that time. To me, he was a big negative. I am not saying that City's ills were all down to Kinkladze, but there was <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> whole Kinkladze cult phenomenon that wasn't right ...too often since his arrival, the team had under-performed. I couldn't help deducing that contrary to popular opinion, he would be my weak link not my strong one." [...] With two games remaining, Manchester City were in the relegation places, and Kinkladze was restored to the starting lineup for the home match against Queens Park Rangers (QPR). The QPR team contained Vinnie Jones, who had a violent reputation and played using the axiom [...] "if their top geezer gets sorted out early doors, you win". Jones tried to apply his philosophy to Kinkladze, even targeting him in the tunnel {{before the start of the}} match. Kinkladze opened the scoring with a free kick, but City could not maintain their lead. Defending described by The Observers reporter as a [...] "calamity" [...] culminated in an unusual own goal from Jamie Pollock, and meant the match ended in a 2–2 draw. City were relegated for the second time in three seasons despite a final day 5–2 win against Stoke City. In total, Kinkladze made 119 appearances for Manchester City, scoring 22 goals. He played regular international football during this period of his career, including in a 0–0 draw with three-time World Cup winners Italy.|$|E
