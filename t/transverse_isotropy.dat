40|$|Localization of {{deformation}} is {{analyzed in}} elastic–plastic solids endowed with elastic anisotropy and non-associative flow rules. A {{particular form of}} elastic anisotropy is considered, for which the localization analysis can be performed with reference to an elastic–plastic solid endowed with isotropic elasticity but whose normals to the yield function and plastic potential are not coaxial. On the other hand, so far, available analytical solutions for the onset of strain localization in elastic–plastic solids assume isotropic elasticity and coaxial plastic properties. Here, a new analytical solution is presented when the plastic normals are not coaxial but the analysis is restricted to plane strain and plane stress loadings. As an illustration, for a material with <b>transverse</b> elastic <b>isotropy</b> and with pressure-dependent yield surface and plastic potential, this solution provides explicit expressions {{at the onset of}} strain localization for the plastic modulus, for the orientation of the shear-band and for the slip mode.

There are two main types of anisotropy, both of them are called <b>transverse</b> <b>isotropy</b> (it is called <b>transverse</b> <b>isotropy</b> because there is isotropy in the horizontal or vertical plane) or polar anisotropy. The difference between them is in their axis of symmetry, which is an axis of rotational invariance such that if we rotate the formation about the axis, the material is still indistinguishable from what it was before. The symmetry axis is usually associated with regional stress or gravity.|$|E
40|$|Observed galaxy {{clustering}} exhibits local <b>transverse</b> statistical <b>isotropy</b> {{around the}} line-of-sight (LOS). The {{variation of the}} LOS across a galaxy survey complicates the measurement of the observed clustering {{as a function of}} the angle to the LOS, as fast Fourier transforms (FFTs) based on Cartesian grids, cannot individually allow for this. Recent advances in methodology for calculating LOS-dependent clustering in Fourier space include the realization that power spectrum LOS-dependent moments can be constructed from sums over galaxies, based on approximating the LOS to each pair of galaxies by the LOS to one of them. We show that we can implement this method using multiple FFTs, each measuring the LOS-weighted clustering along different axes. The N log(N) nature of FFTs means that the computational speed-up is a factor of > 1000 compared with summing over galaxies. This development should be beneficial for future projects such as DESI and Euclid which will provide an order of magnitude more galaxies than current surveys.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{acoustic}} waves of (0001) wurtzite MgO-ZnO and III-N superlattices. We obtain the dispersion curves {{as a function}} of the wavevector parallel to the interfaces. We consider different ranges of the thicknesses of the constituent materials forming the superlattices. Due to the <b>transverse</b> elastic <b>isotropy</b> of the basal plane of the wurtzite structure there is a decoupling of the transverse waves propagating in this plane from the coupled displacements of the sagittal waves. The dispersion curves show a qualitative picture similar in all the superlattices considered here for each of the thickness ranges studied. The sagittal waves show important differences in the dispersion curves when compared with the transverse waves. They show gaps of irregular shape not present in the transverse wave dispersion curves.

40|$|ABSTRACT: An {{experimental}} {{analysis was}} undertaken {{to establish the}} failure strengths in tension and compression along the strong direction (machine direction) and the weak <b>transverse</b> plane of <b>isotropy</b> (cross direction) for a typical paperboard. The principal strengths of the material along the strong machine direction and on the transverse plane which may be assumed to be approximately isotropic allowed the possibility of forming the elliptic paraboloid failure locus corresponding {{to this type of}} material. It was shown that papers in general are tension strong materials having the infinite part of their parabo-loid failure surface turned toward the tension-tension-tension octant in the principal stress space. Finally, attempts to use different strengths along the isotropic plane in order to represent the material as fully orthotropic indicated that there are only small changes in the failure locus due to the changes of the intermediate failure strengths. This implies that the simplified assumption that papers sheets may be considered as transversely isotropic materials is a satisfactory approximation...|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{anisotropic}} heterogeneous geotechnical {{fields are}} characterized using random field theory, in which five basic patterns of material anisotropy are simulated including <b>isotropy,</b> <b>transverse</b> anisotropy, rotated anisotropy, general anisotropy, and general rotated anisotropy. Theoretical formulations of scale of fluctuation {{as a function}} of directional angle are developed for the five basic patterns of anisotropy through modifications of the coordinate system. These formulations of scale of fluctuation are identical for different correlation structures. Correlation functions for the exponential and Gaussian correlation structures are also derived. The matrix decomposition method is then applied to generate anisotropic random fields. The generated random field correlated data are verified with two realizations of transverse anisotropy and general rotated anisotropy random fields. Test values of the sample mean, sample deviation, and scales of fluctuation in six directions match well with the prescribed values. This study provides a technique to characterize inherent geotechnical variability and anisotropy, which is required to realistically simulate complex geological properties in engineering reliability analysis and design...|$|R
