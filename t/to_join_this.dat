Many congregations refused <b>to</b> <b>join</b> <b>this</b> body, however, and others that initially joined it subsequently left.

25|$|In late January 1992, {{the network}} rolled out {{plans to launch}} a similar family-friendly comedy block for Saturday, also helmed by TGIF creator Jim Janicek. It was {{announced}} that Perfect Strangers would move from TGIF <b>to</b> <b>join</b> <b>this</b> new lineup to help it take off. On February 1, 1992, Perfect Strangers began airing in the 9 p.m. slot of I Love Saturday Night, the new TGIF sister lineup (which included Growing Pains, Who's the Boss?, and Capitol Critters). The series experienced a drastic decline in ratings. It dropped to #65 {{for the remainder of}} the season. In July 1992, ABC moved Perfect Strangers back to Fridays at 9:30p.m. ET to fill the timeslot with reruns until the new TGIF season began.

25|$|In late 1994, most of {{the militia}} factions (Hezb-i Islami, Junbish-i Milli and Hezb-i Wahdat) which had been {{fighting}} {{in the battle for}} control of Kabul were defeated militarily by forces of the Islamic State's Secretary of Defense Ahmad Shah Massoud. Bombardment of the capital came to a halt. Massoud tried to initiate a nationwide political process with the goal of national consolidation and democratic elections, also inviting the Taliban to join the process. Massoud had united political and cultural personalities, governors, commanders, clergymen and representatives to reach a lasting agreement. Massoud, like most people in Afghanistan, saw this conference as a small hope for democracy and for free elections. His favourite for candidacy to the presidency was Dr. Mohammad Yusuf, the first democratic prime minister under Zahir Shah, the former king. In the first meeting representatives from 15 different Afghan provinces met, in the second meeting there were already 25 provinces participating. Massoud went unarmed to talk to several Taliban leaders in Maidan Shar, but the Taliban declined <b>to</b> <b>join</b> <b>this</b> political process. When Massoud returned safely, the Taliban leader who had received him as his guest paid with his life: he was killed by other senior Taliban for failing to execute Massoud while the possibility was there.|$|E

500|$|Before Charles could regroup, orders {{arrived from}} the Aulic Council, the {{imperial}} body in Vienna charged with conduct of war, to overset his plan; Charles' troops were to leave Zurich in the supposedly capable hands of Korsokov, re-cross the Rhine and march north to Mainz. Charles stalled this operation {{as long as he}} could, but eventually he had to concede to Vienna's orders. Consequently, the Russian troops under a novice general replaced the Austrian troops and their seasoned commander in the strategically important city. Charles withdrew his force {{to the north of the}} Rhine and marched slowly toward Mainz. In Italy, the Russian generalissimo, Alexander Suvorov, was horrified when he heard this: [...] he depended upon a stable Austro-Russian presence in Switzerland to protect his flank and he expected <b>to</b> <b>join</b> <b>this</b> army by September or October at the latest. Although the order to Charles to recross the Rhine and march north was eventually countermanded, by the time such instructions reached him, he had gone too far to return to Zurich in time.|$|E
500|$|Many of {{the friends}} that Priestley made in Birmingham {{were members of the}} Lunar Society, a group of manufacturers, inventors, and natural {{philosophers}} who assembled monthly to discuss their work. The core of the group included men such as the manufacturer Matthew Boulton, the chemist and geologist James Keir, the inventor and engineer James Watt, and the botanist, chemist, and geologist William Withering. Priestley was asked <b>to</b> <b>join</b> <b>this</b> unique society and contributed much to the work of its members. As a result of this stimulating intellectual environment, he published several important scientific papers, including [...] "Experiments relating to Phlogiston, and the seeming Conversion of Water into Air" [...] (1783). The first part attempts to refute Lavoisier's challenges to his work on oxygen; the second part describes how steam is [...] "converted" [...] into air. After several variations of the experiment, with different substances as fuel and several different collecting apparatuses (which produced different results), he concluded that air could travel through more substances than previously surmised, a conclusion [...] "contrary to all the known principles of hydrostatics". This discovery, along with his earlier work on what would later be recognised as gaseous diffusion, would eventually lead John Dalton and Thomas Graham to formulate the kinetic theory of gases.|$|E

500|$|Hironobu Sakaguchi had {{intended}} to make a role-playing game (RPG) for a long time, but his employer Square refused to give him permission as it expected low sales of such a product. However, when the RPG Dragon Quest was released and {{proved to be a}} hit in Japan, the company reconsidered its stance on the genre and approved Sakaguchi's vision of an RPG inspired by [...] and [...] Only three of his colleagues volunteered <b>to</b> <b>join</b> <b>this</b> project headed by him because he was thought of as a [...] "rough boss" [...] in spite of his unsuccessful creations. Eventually, Final Fantasy was developed by a team of seven core staff members within Square referred to as the [...] "A-Team". Sakaguchi convinced fellow game designers Koichi Ishii and Akitoshi Kawazu to join the project. Kawazu was mainly responsible for the battle system and sequences, which he based heavily on the tabletop game Dungeons & Dragons and the RPG Wizardry. For example, enemies' weaknesses to elements such as fire and ice had not been included in Japanese RPGs up until that point. Kawazu had grown fond of such aspects of Western RPGs and decided to incorporate them into Final Fantasy. He also advocated the player's option to freely choose their own party member classes {{at the beginning of the}} game as he feels [...] "the fun in an RPG begins when you create a character".|$|E
500|$|Although Congregation did not chart, it {{received}} highly positive reviews from critics. Michael Azerrad called it [...] "superb" [...] in Rolling Stone, while Daniel Fidler from Spin viewed the record as [...] "a clean move toward musical excellence", showing the Afghan Whigs [...] "bursting its Sub Pop chains with catchy, heavy guitar riffs, downright lovable song arrangements, melodies that jerk your emotions back and forth, and yes, endearing, raspy vocals that wail, moan, scream, and shout". Brad Webber of the Chicago Tribune found the album {{more accessible to}} listeners than contemporary Seattle or Minneapolis-based, guitar-oriented grunge bands, writing that the Afghan Whigs were [...] "on rock's cutting edge" [...] while stirring [...] "a torrent of emotions on neatly paced songs". In Musician magazine, J. D. Considine said the band was [...] "clever enough to find hooks {{in the sort of}} gnarled riffs and guitar noise Fugazi plays for atmosphere", as well as [...] "canny enough to avoid most of the mannerisms that make much Amerindie rock seem so cliched." [...] Considine concluded in his review, [...] "The best reason <b>to</b> <b>join</b> <b>this</b> Congregation is that the songs are catchy enough to hold their own against the best work of bands like Dinosaur Jr. or the Replacements." [...] Option was less impressed, appreciating the record's [...] "sheer listenability", [...] "clear recording and dynamic performances", but criticizing Dulli's lyrics and the band's cover of [...] "The Temple". Melody Maker ranked Congregation at number 25 on its year-end best albums for 1992.|$|E
500|$|Uematsu {{composed}} with a piano, and used two contrasting methods: [...] "I create music that fits {{the events in}} the game, but sometimes, the event designer will adjust a game event to fit the music I've already written." [...] Uematsu felt previous games Final Fantasy VII and Final Fantasy VIII had a mood of realism, but that Final Fantasy IX was more of a fantasy, so [...] "a serious piece as well as silly, fun pieces could fit in." [...] He felt the theme was medieval music, and was given a two-week break to travel in Europe for inspiration - [...] "looking at old castles in Germany and so on." [...] However, the music was not entirely composed in the medieval mode, as Uematsu claims that [...] "it would be unbalanced" [...] and [...] "a little boring". He aimed for a [...] "simple, warm" [...] style and included uncommon instruments such as a kazoo and dulcimer. Uematsu also included motifs from older Final Fantasy games [...] "because Final Fantasy IX was returning to the roots, so to speak" [...] and incorporated ideas such as [...] "the old intro for battle music" [...] and arranged the Volcano theme from Final Fantasy and the Pandemonium theme from Final Fantasy II, as well as others from the series. Uematsu has claimed several times that Final Fantasy IX is his favorite work, as well as the one he is most proud of. He also stated in the liner notes for the Final Fantasy IX: Original Soundtrack album that he was [...] "glad that [...] was able <b>to</b> <b>join</b> <b>this</b> project." ...|$|E
