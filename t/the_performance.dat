5|$|The play first premiered at The Chestnut Street Theatre in Philadelphia on April 6, 1808. In Barker's {{letter to}} Dunlop, he writes <b>the</b> <b>performance</b> was {{done as a}} benefit for Mr. Bray (who also {{played the role of}} Walter). However, other sources suggest it was a benefit for a Mrs. Woodham. In any case, it is clear that <b>the</b> <b>performance</b> was {{interrupted}} by an offstage commotion which may have cut <b>the</b> <b>performance</b> short. Mr. Webster, a tenor who played the role of Larry, was an object of public scorn at the time because of his effeminate manner and dress, and audience members rioted in outrage at his participation, causing Barker himself to order the curtain to be dropped. The play was subsequently performed again in Philadelphia on February 1, 1809, although it was advertised for January 25.|$|E
5|$|The song {{appears in}} The Acoustic Album (2006). It was {{performed}} in 2006 by the New England octogenarian chorus group Young@Heart.

An expanded version of the film, titled Young@Heart, debuted at the 2007 Los Angeles Film Festival and was released in US theatres in 2008.|$|E
5|$|The two-octave {{diatonic}} accordion (gorodo), popular across Madagascar, {{is believed}} to have been imported by French colonists after 1896. In the 20th century, the instrument was commonly performed during tromba spirit possession ceremonies in a style called renitra. In the 1970s, the renitra was incorporated for <b>the</b> <b>performance</b> of electrified salegy music. This accordion style was also integrated into <b>the</b> <b>performance</b> of tsapika, while also inspiring the style used by the guitarists in these bands. Although today the sound of the accordion is most often replicated by a synthesizer in salegy or tsapika bands due to the expense and rarity of the instrument, accordions continue to hold a privileged place in <b>the</b> <b>performance</b> of tromba ceremonial music. Artists like half-brothers Lego and Rossy have gained success as accordion players. Régis Gizavo brought the contemporary style of renitra to the world music scene, winning several international awards for his accordion performance.|$|E

30|$|In this article, relay {{selection}} for cooperative networks is investigated. Assuming two users scenario, and N relays are available, BEP and outage probability are computed {{for the case}} of sharing the two ordered best relays for AF and DF relaying schemes. Analytical expressions for the BEP and the outage probability are derived for the different scenarios. Simulation results validate the analytical expressions of <b>the</b> BEP <b>performance.</b> <b>The</b> BEP <b>performance</b> of <b>the</b> proposed schemes were also compared with <b>the</b> BEP <b>performances</b> of <b>the</b> best and next-best relays. In DF scheme, <b>the</b> BEP <b>performance</b> of <b>the</b> best relay outperforms <b>the</b> BEP <b>performance</b> of <b>the</b> sharing scenario. But, <b>the</b> BEP <b>performance</b> of BF-DF scenario outperforms <b>the</b> BEP <b>performance</b> of <b>the</b> ordered best relay. Furthermore, <b>the</b> BEP <b>performance</b> of equally sharing the two best ordered relays for AF outperforms <b>the</b> BEP <b>performance</b> of <b>the</b> ordered best relay.
