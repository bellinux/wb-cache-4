5|$|Although Theodore {{appears to}} have assumed, and was {{addressed}} by, the imperial title almost immediately after the capture of Thessalonica, <b>the</b> <b>date</b> of his actual coronation is unknown. The French scholar Lucien Stiernon places it in the period between June 1227 and April 1228, but the Greek Apostolos D. Karpozilos rejects this, reasoning that Theodore had no obvious reason to delay his coronation for so long, and suggested that he was crowned in 1225, immediately after the council of Arta. Eleni Bees-Seferli on the other hand, based on the letters of Apokaukos, suggests a date between 3 April and August 1227, while Alkmini Stavridou-Zafraka has narrowed <b>the</b> <b>date</b> down to 29 May 1227.|$|E
5|$|Although the Georgian Chronicles {{maintain}} that David died in 1001, several Armenian and Muslim accounts suggest {{he may have}} died in 1000.
