Several agents pursued him, {{as he ran}} directly towards the North Portico doors, which were unlocked. President Barack Obama and his daughters had just left the White House and were heading to Camp David {{at the time of}} the incident. Michelle Obama was also not home, having travelled to the retreat earlier. Agents stated they chose not to shoot at Gonzalez as he did not have a weapon in his hands, and was not wearing clothing that could conceal a significant amount of explosives; the possibility of accidentally hitting civilians beyond the fence was also cited. A senior official stated: [...] "A lot of people want to judge the Secret Service for not shooting, but [...] number of <b>things</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> considered in this situation, including whether or not the principal is in the residence" [...] adding, [...] "given what's emerged about [...] since the arrest, maybe we'll look back and say the Secret Service played a role in saving his life." ...|$|E
2500|$|Paragraph 20:Of these duties, the {{following}} bind the proletarian and the worker: fully and faithfully {{to perform the}} work which has been freely and equitably agreed upon; never to injure the property, nor to outrage the person, of an employer; never to resort to violence in defending their own cause, nor to engage in riot or disorder; and to {{have nothing to do}} with men of evil principles, who work upon the people with artful promises of great results, and excite foolish hopes which usually end in useless regrets and grievous loss. The following duties bind the wealthy owner and the employer: not to look upon their work-people as their bondsmen, but to respect in every man his dignity as a person ennobled by Christian character. They are reminded that, according to natural reason and Christian philosophy, working for gain is creditable, not shameful, to a man, since it enables him to earn an honorable livelihood; but to misuse men as though they were things in the pursuit of gain, or to value them solely for their physical powers—that is truly shameful and inhuman. Again justice demands that, in dealing with the working man, religion and the good of his soul must be kept in mind. Hence, the employer is bound to see that the worker has time for his religious duties; that he be not exposed to corrupting influences and dangerous occasions; and that he be not led away to neglect his home and family, or to squander his earnings. Furthermore, the employer must never tax his work people beyond their strength, or employ them in work unsuited to their sex and age. His great and principal duty is to give every one what is just. Doubtless, before deciding whether wages are fair, many <b>things</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> considered; but wealthy owners and all masters of labor should be mindful of this—that to exercise pressure upon the indigent and the destitute for the sake of gain, and to gather one’s profit out of the need of another, is condemned by all laws, human and divine. To defraud any one of wages that are his due is a great crime which cries to the avenging anger of Heaven. [...] "Behold, the hire of the laborers … which by fraud has been kept back by you, crieth; and the cry of them hath entered into the ears of the Lord of Sabaoth." [...] Lastly, the rich must religiously refrain from cutting down the workmen’s earnings, whether by force, by fraud, or by usurious dealing; and with all the greater reason because the laboring man is, as a rule, weak and unprotected, and because his slender means should in proportion to their scantiness be accounted sacred. Were these precepts carefully obeyed and followed out, would they not be sufficient of themselves to keep under all strife and all its causes? ...|$|E

500|$|Inspiration for {{the film}} came from penny arcades, where Bakshi would often spend his time playing pinball, {{sometimes}} bringing his 12-year-old son Mark. Bakshi wanted to use pinball as a metaphor to examine {{the ways of the}} world. Heavy Traffic began a tradition in which Bakshi would write poems before beginning production on each of his films, starting with Street Arabs.

2500|$|Gabriel {{was written}} in the style of action and science fiction movies from the 1980s and early 90s. This was partly because Shane Abbess was {{influenced}} by that era of cinema during his youth and partly because the minuscule budget demanded that the film couldn’t be laden with special effects. Abbess cites the films Alien, Predator and Die Hard as influences. He describes cinema of that era as, [...] "because CG effects weren't huge yet, the whole <b>thing</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> about characters; <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>things</b> you could believe in." [...] Abbess also stated that he [...] "did kinda of want to make one giant cliché."

50|$|The film {{depicts the}} social and gender {{relations}} and attitudes of its time. It notes {{that most of the}} women had never been in industry before, and were unfamiliar with the terminology and mores common to the plant. Each <b>thing</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> broken down and explained in detail. The film also reminds men that women of the day have been at work in things like knitting and sewing, and that these skills could be appropriated for war work. In a short vignette the foreman returns home to his wife, complaining about all the women asking for time off. His wife then tells him she <b>had</b> <b>to</b> cook, clean, {{and take care of the}} children all day, at which point the foreman realizes that women really work two jobs, one in the factory and the other at home.|$|R
40|$|Velocity of {{a moving}} {{body is a}} {{paradigmatic}} case of vector. In this paper {{it is argued that}} this conception of velocity was originally introduced by Leibniz in the context of his critique of Cartesian principles of motion. In Cartesian metaphysics velocity of a moving body is a strictly positive scalar, independent from its direction. As a result of an impact, a body can change its direction and preserve its velocity; such a change would immediately falsify the principle of continuity. In order to save the principle of continuity, Leibniz revised the notion of velocity and reduced the direction of movement to a class of newly conceived directed velocity. It is further shown that negative properties are not allowed in Leibnizian metaphysics. To reconcile the principle of continuity with apparent leaps, Leibniz <b>was</b> forced <b>to</b> deny the existence of atoms: he claimed that the monads, or the true elements of <b>things,</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> indestructible and immaterial...|$|R

Mrs. Saunders drowned the kittens, but the disgrace remained.|$|E

30|$|On {{the level}} of effectiveness, smart city, {{at least in some}} {{variants}} of its ideological use, may be seen as the regression to a naïve techno-positivism, and a distraction from thinking. Adam Greenfield’s critique could be enough, but one <b>thing</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> added more in general. It is telling that smart city, even as an academic endeavour, is often framed as providing “solutions” (often for optimisation and efficiency). This focus on “solutions” sounds much in the spirit of what we, at least in Europe, are being told academia should more and more become about, within the vast reforms of the university on the continental scale: instead of critical thinking—instead of an effort to provide not only answers, but also the right questions—we <b>are</b> progressively asked <b>to</b> <b>be</b> “useful” and <b>to</b> provide technical “solutions” to the messes of our neoliberal present and of our political and social predicament. So, for example, if there are violent unrests in the banlieues, we <b>are</b> called <b>to</b> train psychologists and sociologists to devise tools to calm people down, and urbanists to design neighbourhoods that would dissuade and impede outbursts of rebellion. Examples like this abound.|$|R
