5|$|During <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>decades</b> of the 20th century, the Australian Government {{established}} {{the armed services}} as separate organisations. Each service had an independent chain of command. In 1976, the government made a strategic change and {{established the}} ADF to place the services under a single headquarters. Over time, the degree of integration has increased and tri-service headquarters, logistics and training institutions have supplanted many single-service establishments.|$|E

5|$|During <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>decades</b> of the ACLU, Baldwin {{continued}} as its leader. His charisma and energy attracted many supporters to the ACLU board and leadership ranks. Baldwin was ascetic, wearing hand-me-down clothes, pinching pennies, and {{living on a}} very small salary. The ACLU was directed by an executive committee, {{but it was not}} particularly democratic or egalitarian. The ACLU's base in New York resulted in its being dominated by people from the city and state. Most ACLU funding came from philanthropies, such as the Garland Fund.|$|E
5|$|Important {{theoretical}} work on {{the physical}} structure of stars occurred during <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>decades</b> of the twentieth century. In 1913, the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram was developed, propelling the astrophysical study of stars. Successful models were developed to explain the interiors of stars and stellar evolution. Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin first proposed that stars were made primarily of hydrogen and helium in her 1925 PhD thesis. The spectra of stars were further understood through advances in quantum physics. This allowed the chemical composition of the stellar atmosphere to be determined.|$|E

5|$|Thorium was {{discovered}} in 1829 by the Norwegian amateur mineralogist Morten Thrane Esmark and identified by the Swedish chemist Jöns Jacob Berzelius, who named it after Thor, the Norse god of thunder. Its first applications were developed in the late 19th century. Thorium's radioactivity was widely acknowledged during <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>decades</b> of the 20th century. In {{the second half of}} the century, thorium was replaced in many uses due to concerns over its radioactivity.|$|E
5|$|After {{his death}} from cancer in 1941 his manuscripts were curated by his {{linguist}} friends who also worked {{to spread the}} influence of Whorf's ideas on the relation between language, culture and cognition. Many of his works were published posthumously in <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>decades</b> after his death. In the 1960s Whorf's views fell out of favor and he {{became the subject of}} harsh criticisms by scholars who considered language structure to primarily reflect cognitive universals rather than cultural differences. Critics argued that Whorf's ideas were untestable and poorly formulated and that they were based on badly analyzed or misunderstood data.|$|E

In <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>decades</b> after the discovery of the new lands, the Spanish colonised the Caribbean and established a centre of operations on the island of Cuba. By August 1521 the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan had fallen to the Spanish. Within three years of the fall of Tenochtitlan the Spanish had conquered a large part of Mexico, extending as far south as the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. The newly conquered territory became New Spain, headed by a viceroy who answered to the king of Spain via the Council of the Indies.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the fact}} that the period of the wars of {{independence}} itself was marked by a rapid expansion of representative government, for several of the new nations the nineteenth century was marked by militarism {{because of the lack of}} well-defined political and national institutions. The armies and officers that came into existence during the process of independence wanted to ensure that they got their rewards once the struggle was over. Many of these armies did not fully disband once the wars were over and they proved to be one of the stabler institutions in <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>decades</b> of national existence. These armies and their leaders effectively influenced the course of political development. Out of this new tradition came the caudillos, strongmen who amassed formal and informal economic, military and political power in themselves.|$|E
5|$|From the 1860s, Flemish {{literature}} {{began to}} reflect the Realist style already popular in France, under writers such as Anton Bergmann and Virginie Loveling. The works feature detailed depictions of ordinary aspects of daily life and often have a pessimistic tone. Heavily influenced by Belgian dialects such as West Flemish, the poet and priest Guido Gezelle produced lyric poems in Dutch from the 1850s {{until his death in}} 1899. In 1893, the cultural magazine Van Nu en Straks ("Of Today and Tomorrow") was launched to bring Flemish literature to an audience outside Belgium. Flemish literature continued to flourish in <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>decades</b> of the 20th century under writers such as Stijn Streuvels.|$|E

5|$|John, {{the fourth}} Marquess, {{acquired}} the castle in 1900 {{on the death}} of his father, and the family estates and investments around the castle began to rapidly reduce in size. Cardiff had grown hugely in the previous century, its population increasing from 1,870 in 1800 to around 250,000 in 1900, but the coal trade began to diminish after 1918 and industry suffered during the depression of the 1920s. John only inherited a part of the Butes' Glamorgan estates, and in <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>decades</b> of the 20th century he sold off much of the remaining assets around Cardiff, including the coal mines, docks and railway companies, with the bulk of the land interests being finally sold off or nationalised in 1938.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the first}} studies of {{condensed}} states of matter was by English chemist Humphry Davy, in <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>decades</b> of the nineteenth century. Davy observed that of the forty chemical elements known at the time, twenty-six had metallic properties such as lustre, ductility and high electrical and thermal conductivity. This indicated that the atoms in John Dalton's atomic theory were not indivisible as Dalton claimed, but had inner structure. Davy further claimed that elements that were then believed to be gases, such as nitrogen and hydrogen could be liquefied under the right conditions and would then behave as metals.|$|E
5|$|Queen Maud Land was {{the first}} part of Antarctica to be sighted, on 27 January 1820 by Fabian von Bellingshausen. It was however among the last to be explored, as it {{required}} aircraft in combination with ships to undertake systematic exploration. Early Norwegian research activities in Antarctica rested entirely on whaling and sealing expeditions funded by ship owners, particularly by Christen Christensen and his son Lars. The first two Norwegian expeditions were carried out by sealing ships in 1892–93 and 1893–94. While they were primarily sent for exploring, sealing, and whaling possibilities, they also performed scientific research. Further Norwegian expeditions were mounted into <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>decades</b> of the 20th century.|$|E

5|$|The Football Association bought Aker's {{share of}} the stadium during the 1930s, and in 1945 also part of Lyn's share. From 1948, the Cup Final was held at Ullevaal, and has been held there since. Other {{activities}} held during <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>decades</b> included boxing, and a revival meeting hosted by Billy Graham in front of 40,000 people in 1955. In 1960, NFF bought more shares from Lyn and became the majority shareholder with 50.7%, while Lyn retained 44.2%. The reason was the planned expansion could not receive public grants with such a strong tie to a single club, but the state {{was willing to give}} grants to the stadium if it was controlled by the federation. In 1967, a new South Stand was opened, and the following year NFF moved into offices at the stadium.|$|E
5|$|The Transylvanian peasants {{had already}} been outraged because of the {{increase}} of existing seigneurial duties and taxes {{and the introduction of}} new taxes during <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>decades</b> of the century. The bishop also tried to collect the tithe from the petty noblemen and from Orthodox Vlachs who had settled in parcels abandoned by Catholic peasants. In the spring of 1437, Hungarian and Vlach commoners, poor townspeople from Kolozsvár (now Cluj-Napoca in Romania) and petty noblemen started to assemble on the flat summit of Mount Bábolna near Alparét (Bobâlna) where they set up a fortified camp. The bishop and his brother, Roland Lépes, the deputy of the voivode (or royal governor) of Transylvania, gathered their troops to fight against the rebels. The voivode, the two counts of the Székelys and many Transylvanian noblemen also hurried to the mountain to assist them against the rebels.|$|E
5|$|The {{animals were}} kept in pens on Sullivan Hill, {{situated}} across the East Drive from the zoo's present location, near the sheep paddock and northeast of the Dairy Farmhouse. Of the original zoological facilities in the park, the Deer Paddock, located near the present Carousel, was converted into a meadow and the deer were moved to the new Menagerie, The Wild Fowl Pond remained, located {{on the east side}} of the park in a low area now forming the northern part of the zoo. The Menagerie continued to accrue animals in <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>decades</b> of the 20th century. These were generally donated by prominent individuals and institutions and formed a varied collection of specimens both native to North America and other regions of the world.|$|E
