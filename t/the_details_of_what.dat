In this episode, Veronica resolves the mystery of her sexual assault a year earlier by talking to previous acquaintances and learning about <b>the</b> <b>details</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> happened at Shelly Pomroy's party a year earlier while she was under the influence of GHB. Meanwhile, Duncan (Teddy Dunn) returns from running away earlier, and Veronica and Logan's relationship matures as she reacts to the news that he had roofies the night of the party.|$|E

Gravano attempted to lie low {{for nearly three}} weeks afterwards, during which time he called his crew together and {{made the decision to}} kill Castellano if necessary. Gravano and Milito were then summoned to a meeting with Castellano at a Manhattan restaurant. Castellano had been given <b>the</b> <b>details</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> Fiala had done, but he was still livid that Gravano had not come to him for permission to kill Fiala first. Gravano, however, was spared execution when he convinced Castellano that the reason he had kept him in the dark was to protect the boss in case something went wrong with the hit.|$|E

25|$|Weinberg {{remained}} in the orchard until daybreak, and was found by a watchman at 5:30 AM. He reported the kidnapping to the British Army. Shortly afterwards he was interviewed by the Palestine Police Force, and gave them <b>the</b> <b>details</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> had happened. Reports of the kidnapping also reached the Haganah in Netanya. Oved Ben-Ami, head of the Netanya council, called an emergency council meeting. He did not invite the Revisionist party members, who were identified with Irgun. The decision was made {{in accordance with the}} Yishuv's position, which was published the next day, calling the kidnapping a provocation that might jeopardize what hope was left for clemency for those condemned to death. It pleaded for every decent civilian to assist in the search for the hostages.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>details</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> {{followed}} {{during the}} students' {{clash with the}} police vary. According to police reports, the police chased the students because they had hijacked three buses and attempted to drive them off {{to carry out the}} protests and then return to their college. Members of the student union, however, stated that they had been protesting and were hitchhiking when they clashed with the police. As the buses sped away and the chase ensued, the police opened fire on the vehicles. Two students were killed in one of the buses, while some fled into the surrounding hills. Roughly three hours later, escaped students returned to the scene to speak with reporters. In a related incident, unidentified gunmen fired at a bus carrying players from a local soccer team, which they had presumably mistaken for one of the buses that picked up the student protestors. Bullets struck the bus and hit two taxis. The bus driver, a football player, and a woman inside one of the taxis were killed. The next morning, the authorities discovered the corpse of a student, Julio César Mondragón, who had attempted to run away during the gunfire. His eyes had been gouged out and the skin of his face flayed to a bare skull. In total, 6 people were killed and 25 wounded.|$|E

[...] The 5-part article was titled [...] "Finland Strategy: Thailand's Revolution Plan?" [...] was written by Pramote Nakhonthap and appeared on 17, 19, 22, 23 and 24 May 2006. Thaksin's alleged co-conspirators apparently included Thai Rak Thai party members Prommin Lertsuridej (Secretary-General to the Premier), Chaturon Chaisaeng (Deputy Prime Minister), Surapong Suebwonglee (Minister of Information and Communications Technology), Adisorn Piangket (Former Deputy Science Minister), Sutham Saengprathum (Deputy Interior Minister), and Phumtham Wechayachai (Deputy Transport Minister), all of whom had been affiliated with the Communist Party of Thailand following the massacre of 6 October 1976.|$|E

500|$|While still {{performing}} as the vocalist of Icelandic alternative rock group the Sugarcubes, Björk approached both Ásmundur Jónsson of Bad Taste and producer Derek Birkett of One Little Indian Records with a demo cassette {{of her own}} songs on which she had been working. These demos included versions of songs that would appear on Debut, including [...] "The Anchor Song" [...] and [...] "Aeroplane". After the Sugarcubes went on hiatus, she moved to London, England, where she and Birkett worked on <b>the</b> <b>details</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> would become Debut. Björk has admitted that The Sugarcube's music was not her taste, and that her contact with London's underground club culture of the late 1980s/early 1990s helped her find her own musical identity. She said: [...] "...as a music nerd, I just had to follow my heart, and my heart was those beats that were happening in England. And maybe what I'm understanding {{more and more as}} I get older, is that music like Kate Bush has really influenced me. Brian Eno. Acid. Electronic beats. Labels like Warp." ...|$|E
500|$|Greco-Roman mysteries were, in {{the words}} of the classicist Walter Burkert, [...] "initiation rituals of a voluntary, personal, and secret {{character}} that aimed at a change of mind through experience of the sacred." [...] These rituals were dedicated to a particular deity or group of deities, and they used a variety of intense experiences, such as nocturnal darkness interrupted by bright light and loud music and noise, that induced a state of disorientation and an intense religious experience. Some of them involved cryptic symbolism. Initiates were not supposed to discuss some of <b>the</b> <b>details</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> they experienced in the mysteries, and modern understanding of these rites is limited by this secrecy. The most prestigious mysteries in the Greek world were the Eleusinian mysteries dedicated to the goddess Demeter, which were performed at Eleusis, near Athens, from at least the sixth century BCE to the end of the fourth century CE. They centered on Demeter's search for her daughter Persephone in Greek mythology. Eleusinian initiates passed into a dark hall, the Telesterion, and were subjected to terrifying sights, followed by a fiery light and a shout from the hierophant who presided over the ceremony. By this light the initiates saw objects that represented Demeter's power over fertility, such as a sheaf of wheat, and perhaps other images that referred to the myth of Persephone. In the mysteries of the god Dionysus, which were performed in many places across the Greek world, participants celebrated in a frenzy at night, in the open air. Dionysian celebrations were connected in some way with Orphism, a group of mystical beliefs about the nature of the afterlife.|$|E

2500|$|The Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) is an {{extension}} to the Standard Model that realizes supersymmetry.

[...] If the superparticles are found, it may be analogous to discovering dark matter [...] and depending on <b>the</b> <b>details</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> might be found, it could provide evidence for grand unification and might even, in principle, provide hints as to whether string theory describes nature.

30|$|This article {{set out to}} {{contribute}} to thinking {{about the role of}} the facilitator of discussion of video, in particular, how discussion can be kept focused on <b>the</b> <b>detail</b> <b>of</b> events and <b>what</b> a focus on detail might occasion. Through an analysis of the results of an ESRC funded project in the UK, to establish video clubs for teachers of mathematics, some facilitator moves were uncovered that are not within the van Es et al. (2014) framework and yet which seem to be effective in terms of shifting discussion away from evaluation. These moves are related to the van Es et al. category of ‘maintaining a focus on the video and the mathematics’. The moves are in response to a participating teacher straying from a discussion norm, in this case, the explicit invitation to reconstruct what took place (i.e. <b>the</b> <b>detail</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> was said, when it was said and who said it). One facilitator move is to actually interrupt a teacher’s contribution to cut short an evaluation or judgement. There may be cultural sensitivities around interrupting that make this move more or less acceptable. However, it does not appear to be the interruption itself that is significant, but what happens next. The second, linked move, is to highlight to the group (but not, in the sense of van Es and colleagues, something important on the video) what it was about the contribution which meant it was not within the parameter of allowable talk at this time in the discussion. Such a move is a meta-comment, in that it is a comment about what a teacher has said, for example ‘that’s an interpretation’. Following the highlighting of the breach of the discussion norm, there is then a re-directing back to the task (e.g. ‘let’s stay with <b>the</b> <b>detail</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> took place’). <b>The</b> sequence of moves is therefore: (interrupt), highlight/meta-comment on a breach of the discussion norm, re-direct.|$|R

2500|$|As {{noted by}} critic Susan Young, John Crowley's award-winning 1989 novella [...] "Great Work of Time" [...] {{has the same}} basic outline as [...] "The End of Eternity" [...] - i.e. a secret society of well-meaning time {{travelers}} bent on remodeling history, and a young man recruited into the society {{in order to make}} a specific change that would bring this society itself into being. <b>The</b> <b>details</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> the time travelers do and where in time they operate are much different from those in Asimov's book. However, in both books, the society's operations come to a halt through the influence of people from the future, because the society's actions endanger the existence of that future. Young also notes a similarity with Poul Anderson's [...] "The Corridors of Time" [...] which also depicts a complex society of time travelers, who find sections of the future inaccessible - and also in Anderson's book, the intervention of the people of that further future plays a pivotal and cataclysmic role in the plot.|$|E

30|$|This {{article is}} focused {{on the role of the}} {{facilitator}} in the professional development of mathematics teachers. It is a feature of several frameworks for using video that teachers are invited to comment on <b>the</b> <b>detail</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> they saw and heard, and base comments on evidence from the video. It is also a common finding that it is hard to establish ‘speaking evidentially’ as a way of working and at the same time, such an expectation is seen to be critical to making discussion productive. This article draws on a paradigmatic case of one video club, during which seven teachers met over a 3 -month period, and shared video recordings of their own classrooms. The group of teachers learn how to focus on <b>the</b> <b>detail</b> <b>of</b> video, avoiding judgement, from the first session. The way this is achieved and what it occasions is analysed, within an enactivist methodology.|$|R
