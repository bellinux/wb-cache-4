Often, administration of an intra-oral local anesthetic such as lidocaine and epinephrine is indicated in order to carry out pain-free <b>treatment.</b> <b>Treatment</b> may range from simple advice, removal of dental decay with a dental drill and subsequent placement of a filling, to root canal <b>treatment,</b> tooth extraction, or debridement.|$|E

40|$|We {{examined}} {{the effect of}} disturbances of varying intensity on the dominant modes of regeneration among woody plants in tropical dry forest in lowland Bolivia. Seed survival and density, mortality, height, crown area, and basal diameters of seedlings and sprouts were compared among four <b>treatments</b> of varying disturbance intensity (high-intensity burn, low-intensity burn, plant removal, and harvesting gap) {{over a period of}} 18 months following <b>treatments.</b> High- and low-intensity burns reduced densities of viable seed by an average of 94 and 50 %, respectively. Tree seedlings were more abundant than tree sprouts in all <b>treatments.</b> There were few differences in seedling density among <b>treatments.</b> Sprouts were most common in the plant removal and low-intensity burn <b>treatments</b> than in harvesting gap and high-intensity burn <b>treatments.</b> Seedling mortality was higher than sprout mortality during the first year following <b>treatments.</b> Sprouts were taller, had more stems per individual, larger crown areas, and larger basal diameters than seedlings. Origin of sprout differed among <b>treatments.</b> Eighteen months following <b>treatments,</b> 85 % of individuals> 2. 5 m tall were sprouts. Most seedlings> 2. 5 m tall after 18 months had established in high-intensity burn <b>treatments.</b> Sprouting individuals dominated regeneration after all <b>treatments,</b> however, in high-intensity burn <b>treatments,</b> sprouts were relatively less dominant due to smaller sprouts and larger seedlings after high-intensity burns...|$|R
