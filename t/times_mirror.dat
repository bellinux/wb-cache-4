25|$|On October 1, 2007, Belo {{announced}} plans to split off its broadcasting and newspaper interests into two independent companies. WFAA would remain with the broadcasting entity, which retained the Belo Corporation name and was structured as the legal successor to the previous company, while the newspaper division (which in addition to The Dallas Morning News, included among other publications Al Día, Neighborsgo and Quick) was spun off into the similarly named, shareholder-held entity A. H. Belo Corporation (the name used by the original company from 1865 to 2001). The split – which was completed on February 8, 2008 – ended the joint ownership of WFAA television and The News after 59 years, becoming {{the last of the}} three newspaper/television broadcasting combinations in the Dallas–Fort Worth market to be separated into different companies (KXAS-TV was co-owned with the Star-Telegram from September 1948 until Carter Publications sold the former two properties and radio stations WBAP (820 AM) and KSCS (96.3 FM) to separate companies in 1974, while KDFW was co-owned with the Dallas Times-Herald—which ended publication after Belo acquired the newspaper in December 1991—from December 1949 until the <b>Times</b> <b>Mirror</b> Company sold the latter to the MediaNews Group in 1986).

40|$|<b>Time</b> {{reversal}} <b>mirrors</b> {{can be used}} to backpropagate and refocus incident wavefields {{to their}} actual source location, with the subsequent benefits of imaging with high-resolution and super-stacking properties. These benefits of <b>time</b> reversal <b>mirrors</b> have been previously verified with computer simulations and laboratory experiments but not with exploration-scale seismic data. We now demonstrate the high-resolution and the super-stacking properties in locating seismic sources with field seismic data that include multiple scattering. Tests on both synthetic data and field data show that a <b>time</b> reversal <b>mirror</b> has the potential to exceed the Rayleigh resolution limit by factors of 4 or more. Results also show that a <b>time</b> reversal <b>mirror</b> has a significant resilience to strong Gaussian noise and that accurate imaging of source locations from passive seismic data can be accomplished with traces having signal-to-noise ratios as low as 0. 001. Synthetic tests also demonstrate that <b>time</b> reversal <b>mirrors</b> can sometimes enhance the signal by a factor proportional to the square root of the product of the number of traces, denoted as N and the number of events in the traces. This enhancement property is denoted as super-stacking and greatly exceeds the classical signal-to-noise enhancement factor of.

The sale to Times-Mirror was finalized on July 2, 1970, at which point—due to FCC rules that prohibited separately owned broadcast properties based in the same market from using the same callsign—the station changed its call letters to KDFW-TV, in reference to its service area of Dallas and Fort Worth (the [...] "-TV" [...] suffix was dropped from the callsign in July 1998; the KRLD-TV calls were later used from 1984 to 1986 by channel 33, now KDAF).
