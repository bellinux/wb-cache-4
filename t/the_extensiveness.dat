[...] Unlike the Torah, in which, for example, laws of the Sabbath are scattered throughout the books of Exodus, Leviticus, and Numbers, all the Mishnaic laws of the Sabbath are located in a single tractate called Shabbat (Hebrew for [...] "Sabbath"). Moreover, the laws contained in the twenty-four chapters that make up that tractate are far more extensive than those contained in the Torah, reflecting <b>the</b> <b>extensiveness</b> of the Oral Law. Some authority suggests HaNasi made use {{of as many as}} 13 separate collections of Halakhot from different schools and time periods, and reassembled that material into a coherent whole, arranged it systematically, summarized discussions, and in some cases rendered his own rulings where alternative traditions existed.|$|E

2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>extensiveness</b> of {{regolith}} on Gaspra and {{its presence}} overall {{is a matter}} of debate, and not fully understood. Visually, the somewhat subdued and mantled appearance suggests a substantial regolith. Also, correlations are seen between the subtle color variations and local topography, and {{it has been suggested that}} this is caused by the slow migration of regolith to lower areas. It is, however, difficult to explain the origin of a putative regolith. Firstly, Gaspra's escape velocity is very small, so small that it is difficult to understand how it could keep a significant portion of fragments ejected by impacts from escaping. This may be alleviated if Gaspra is a porous body or started with a large regolith, but one has to explain how the original regolith appeared. A possible resolution of the issue may be that Gaspra obtained a regolith during the Flora-family forming impact that also created Gaspra itself. [...] Secondly, it has been estimated that the matter ejected by all the craters would be only enough to cover Gaspra with 10 m of regolith. However, some craters are much deeper than this without showing any structural difference on their walls.|$|E

Secondly, it relates interactive and procedural strategising {{to the importance of}} the system - procedural strategising is more likely to occur if the system is strategically important.

40|$|Purpose – The paper aims to gain {{an insight}} into the risk {{management}} tools practised in Islamic and commercial banks in Malaysia, and selected Islamic banks outside Malaysia.

40|$|Please note: This {{article is}} in Greek. Changes of consonants and vowels can be {{observed}} {{not only in the}} idiom of Kouvouklia and other Greek idioms and dialects, but in other languages as well. According to G. Hatzidakis changes in some cases of the article (o,η) and of the third person of the personal pronoun (αυτός), are attributed to the contraction of the unaccented vowels, after which they become ts. After the final phthong -s, the sound of a weak phthong i is heard and they become tsi. In Turkish an i is developed before consonantal complexes, of which the first component is s or z, the same is noticed in other languages as well. The vocalization of some consonants is very noticeable in the English phthongs l, r, w and j. These consonants have some vocalic qualitites, because of which they are called semiconsonants and semivowels. The American linguist Kenneth Pike proposed the terms vocoid (φωνηεντοειδή) and contoid (συμφωνοειδή). In Antiquity the consonant s, and the semivowels j and F in Greek at the beggining of the word turned into a guttural consonant, while in between vowels they disappear. In the Latin the phthong s turned into r, and the semivowel F became v. The voiceless phthong s when is next to liquid and voiced phthongs l and r becomes voiced and it is pronounced as z. In the Indoeuropean languages, frequently, a vowel is developed next to a liquid consonant, turning it into a syllable, e. g. the consonants l and r become la and ra or al and ar. This phenomenon is due to a certain degree of vocalisation existing in the consonants l and r. The nasals (μ,ν), too, are vocalised: τέμν-ω-έ-ταμ-ον, the *μ-χρι -μέχρι elsewhere became ά-χρι, στμ-φυλή, σταφυλή (πβ. στέμ-φυλον). Also in the idiom of Kouvouklia the nasal n becomes palatal like the l, due to its vicinity with the i. Other changes of vowels are <b>the</b> ektenia (<b>extensiveness),</b> <b>the</b> heteriosis (alteration) and the systole (contraction) ...|$|R
