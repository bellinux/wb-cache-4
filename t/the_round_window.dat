5|$|<b>The</b> <b>round</b> <b>window</b> {{allows for}} the fluid within the inner ear to move. As the stapes pushes the {{secondary}} tympanic membrane, fluid in the inner ear moves and pushes the membrane of <b>the</b> <b>round</b> <b>window</b> out by a corresponding amount into the middle ear. The ossicles help amplify sound waves by nearly 15–20 times.|$|E
25|$|The fort's first Catholic {{church was}} built in 1871 and was later {{replaced}} by St. Ignatius Chapel in 1889. St. Ignatius Chapel was destroyed by fire in December 2001. The first Protestant chapel, Memorial Chapel, was built by prison labor in 1878 of stone quarried on post. <b>The</b> <b>round</b> <b>window</b> behind the chapel's front altar was intentionally installed slightly askew by an inmate who was angry at his work boss. This chapel has brass cannon embedded in the walls {{at the sides of}} the church, and photos of many of the officers involved in the early history of the fort, including some of the Custer family.|$|E
25|$|In reptiles, {{sound is}} {{transmitted}} to the inner ear by the stapes (stirrup) bone of the middle ear. This is pressed against the oval window, a membrane-covered opening {{on the surface of}} the vestibule. From here, sound waves are conducted through a short perilymphatic duct to a second opening, <b>the</b> <b>round</b> <b>window,</b> which equalizes pressure, allowing the incompressible fluid to move freely. Running parallel with the perilymphatic duct is a separate blind-ending duct, the lagena, filled with endolymph. The lagena is separated from the perilymphatic duct by a basilar membrane, and contains the sensory hair cells that finally translate the vibrations in the fluid into nerve signals. It is attached at one end to the saccule.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> stained-glass <b>round</b> <b>window</b> in <b>the</b> choir {{was made}} in 1288 to the designs of Duccio. It {{is one of the}} {{earliest}} remaining examples of Italian stained glass. <b>The</b> <b>round</b> stained-glass <b>window</b> in <b>the</b> façade dates from 1549 and represents the Last Supper. It is the work of Pastorino de' Pastorini.|$|R
2500|$|A {{renovation}} {{project in}} the 1960s removed many of the exterior decorative features, including tops of the side pilasters, trim on <b>the</b> <b>rounded</b> <b>windows</b> and tower, and border around the upper exterior nave. [...] The church interior has not been renovated as extensively.|$|R
25|$|An {{inner ear}} {{decompression}} model by Doolette and Mitchell {{suggests that a}} transient increase in gas tension after a switch from helium to nitrogen in breathing gas may result from the difference in gas transfer between compartments. If the transport of nitrogen into the vascular compartment by perfusion exceeds removal of helium by perfusion, while transfer of helium into the vascular compartment by diffusion from the perilymph and endolymph exceeds the counterdiffusion of nitrogen, this {{may result in a}} temporary increase in total gas tension, as the input of nitrogen exceeds the removal of helium, which can result in bubble formation and growth. This model suggests that diffusion of gases from the middle ear across <b>the</b> <b>round</b> <b>window</b> is negligible. The model is not necessarily applicable to all tissue types.|$|E
25|$|The {{lower section}} of the {{building}} had Gothic niches and typical polychrome marble decoration. There was a large ocular window {{in the end of}} the nave which had to be taken into account. Alberti simply respected what was already in place, and the Florentine tradition for polychrome that was well established at the Baptistery of San Giovanni, the most revered building in the city. The decoration, being mainly polychrome marble, is mostly very flat in nature, but a sort of order is established by the regular compartments and the circular motifs which repeat the shape of <b>the</b> <b>round</b> <b>window.</b> For the first time, Alberti linked the lower roofs of the aisles to nave using two large scrolls. These were to become a standard Renaissance device for solving the problem of different roof heights and bridge the space between horizontal and vertical surfaces.|$|E
500|$|The {{symbol of}} the slave ship is furthered by {{specific}} set designs, including <b>the</b> <b>round</b> <b>window</b> in Ben Geisler's office which resembles a porthole, {{as well as the}} walkway leading to Mayhew's bungalow, which resembles the boarding ramp of a watercraft. Several lines of dialogue make clear by the film's end that Barton has become a slave to the studio: [...] "he contents of your head", Lipnick's assistant tells him, [...] "are the property of Capitol Pictures". After Barton turns in his script, Lipnick delivers an even more brutal punishment: [...] "Anything you write will be the property of Capitol Pictures. And Capitol Pictures will not produce anything you write". This contempt and control is representative of the opinions expressed by many writers in Hollywood at the time. As Arthur Miller said in his review of Barton Fink: [...] "The only thing about Hollywood that I am sure of is that its mastication of writers can never be too wildly exaggerated".|$|E
50|$|At {{the fourth}} story <b>the</b> <b>rounded</b> <b>windows</b> are topped with banded {{segmental}} arches. A parapet with two tiers of recessed panels {{is at the}} roofline. At either end are small pyramidal towers with crocket finials. The interior has been extensively renovated but some original wainscoting and window trim is left on the third floor.|$|R

2500|$|At {{the base}} of the cochlea, each duct ends in a {{membranous}} portal that faces the middle ear cavity: The vestibular duct ends at the oval window, where the footplate of the stapes sits. The footplate vibrates when the pressure is transmitted via the ossicular chain. [...] The wave in the perilymph moves away from the footplate and towards the helicotrema. Since those fluid waves move the cochlear partition that separates the ducts up and down, the waves have a corresponding symmetric part in perilymph of the tympanic duct, which ends at <b>the</b> <b>round</b> <b>window,</b> bulging out when the oval window bulges in.|$|E
2500|$|The city in Dark City is {{described}} by Higley as a [...] "murky, nightmarish German expressionist film noir depiction of urban repression and mechanism". The city has a World War II dreariness reminiscent of Edward Hopper's works and has details from different eras and architectures that are changed by the Strangers; [...] "buildings collapse as others emerge and battle with one another at the end". <b>The</b> <b>round</b> <b>window</b> in Dark City is concave like a fishbowl and is a frequently seen element throughout the city. The inhabitants do not live {{at the top of}} the city; the main characters' homes are dwarfed by the bricolage of buildings.|$|E
50|$|The First National Bank was {{incorporated}} in 1875 following rapid post-Civil War {{growth of the}} village of Brewster and its neighboring areas. It grew successful enough that by 1886 it could afford the current building, whose Queen Anne stylings also incorporate <b>the</b> <b>rounded</b> <b>windows</b> of <b>the</b> also-popular Richardsonian Romanesque style. The bank was purposely located next to the rail depot, the source {{of much of the}} prosperity it had helped to finance.|$|R
5000|$|Defining {{features}} of houses {{from this period}} are curved corner windows, including Venetian blinds, some rare examples of which are curved. With a slightly steeper pitched roof than the Early Modern Style, this style was generally of brick veneer cream brick but also could have dark brown glazed feature brickwork incorporated into the external walls, and under windowsills. Chimneys were either stepped or plain, and together with <b>the</b> <b>round</b> <b>windows</b> perhaps gave meaning to the [...] "Waterfall" [...] name.|$|R
25|$|The {{exterior}} {{decoration of}} Makaravank’s main temple {{is the more}} expressive. Over the central window of the southern façade there is a sun dial and below it, on the cantilever column, a representation of a dove; <b>the</b> <b>round</b> <b>windows</b> vary in their shapes and ornamentation. The entrance portals are rectangular, with a semi-circular inner niche. The tympanum and the spandrel are composed of stones of various shapes and colors. The dome drum is skirted by a graceful twenty-arch arcature on twin half-columns.|$|R
6000|$|But {{the silence}} was only broken by the {{cheeping}} of sparrows outside <b>the</b> <b>round</b> <b>window,</b> {{and the sound of}} the horse, Hal, munching the last morsel of his carrot. Harbinger was aware in his every nerve of the sweetish, slightly acrid, husky odour of the loosebox, mingling with the scent of Barbara's hair and clothes. And rather miserably, he said for the third time: ...|$|E

The testing rule I gave for good {{color in the}} [...] "Elements of Drawing," [...] is that you make the white {{precious}} and the black conspicuous. Now you will see in these studies that the moment the white is inclosed properly, and harmonized with the other hues, it becomes somehow more precious and pearly than the white paper; and that I am not afraid to leave a whole field of untreated white paper all round it, being sure that even the little diamonds in <b>the</b> <b>round</b> <b>window</b> will tell as jewels, if they are gradated justly.|$|E
60|$|So Rollo {{went into}} his state room, and Jane sat down upon the couch in hers, {{by the side of}} Maria, looking very much pleased. She opened the door of the cage, and let the kitten out. The kitten walked all about the room, {{examining}} every thing with great attention. She jumped up upon the marble washstand, and from that she contrived to get into <b>the</b> <b>round</b> <b>window,</b> where she stood for a few minutes looking out very attentively over the wide sea. Not knowing, however, what to make of so extraordinary a prospect, she presently jumped down again, and, selecting a smooth place {{at the foot of the}} couch, she curled herself up into a ring upon the soft covering of it, and went to sleep.|$|E

50|$|The church {{congregation}} {{was organized}} in 1819 as the Second Baptist Church in Nobleboro. When Damariscotta was set off from Nobleboro in 1848, its name was formally changed to Damariscotta Baptist Church, and the town's first organizational meeting {{was held in}} this building. It was constructed between 1843 and 1847, with stylistic evidence suggesting it was designed by Brunswick architect Samuel Melcher. Originally fitted with lancet-arched windows in the Gothic style, alterations in 1891 included the conversion of these <b>windows</b> to <b>the</b> <b>rounded</b> <b>windows</b> now found on the building.|$|R

50|$|Several {{alterations}} {{have altered}} the original appearance of the exterior. Some of the changes include the removal of a wrought iron fence crowning the entire roof and the small roof of the cupola. A small balustrade that was once located above the east porch between the two bay windows of the second floor was removed, as well. Several onion shaped ornaments no longer cap the dormer on the third story and <b>the</b> <b>round</b> <b>windows</b> in <b>the</b> roof of the cupola. Also, a small unornamented service porch {{on the south side}} of the southwest corner, has been removed, although the door still remains.|$|R
