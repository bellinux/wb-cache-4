5|$|AMPK {{probably}} {{also plays a}} role in increased peripheral insulin sensitivity, as metformin administration increases AMPK activity in skeletal muscle. AMPK is known to cause GLUT4 deployment to the plasma membrane, resulting in insulin-independent glucose uptake. Some metabolic actions of metformin do appear to occur by AMPK-independent mechanisms; <b>the</b> <b>metabolic</b> actions of metformin in the heart muscle can occur independent of changes in AMPK activity and may be mediated by p38 MAPK- and PKC-dependent mechanisms.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} pathophysiological {{mechanism of}} leukemogenesis in AML is the epigenetic induction of dedifferentiation by genetic mutations that alter {{the function of}} epigenetic enzymes, such as the DNA demethylase TET2 and <b>the</b> <b>metabolic</b> enzymes IDH1 and IDH2, which lead to the generation of a novel oncometabolite, D-2-hydroxyglutarate, which inhibits the activity of epigenetic enzymes such as TET2. The hypothesis is that such epigenetic mutations lead to the silencing of tumor suppressor genes and/or the activation of proto-oncogenes.|$|E
5|$|Aristotle's {{account of}} {{metabolism}} sought {{to explain how}} food was processed by the body to provide both heat and the materials for the body's construction and maintenance. <b>The</b> <b>metabolic</b> system for live-bearing tetrapods described in the Parts of Animals can be modelled as an open system, a branching tree of flows of material through the body.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWith <b>the</b> {{increasing}} <b>metabolic</b> throughput, <b>the</b> {{city as a}} giant organism causes resource {{consumption and}} environmental pollution, which become a bottleneck for urban ecological systems to develop healthily. Using Beijing as an example, we adopt the material flow method to account for resource consumption and waste emissions during <b>the</b> urban <b>metabolic</b> process. Combined with a monetary input-output table (MIOT) for Beijing in 2002, we compile a physical input-output table (PIOT) and build an ecological network model of <b>the</b> urban <b>metabolic</b> system including 45 nodes and 1761 network paths. Using flow analysis and utility analysis methods of ecological network, we can study the complex relationships and hierarchical structure to reveal the crux that results in the disorder of <b>the</b> urban <b>metabolic</b> process; thus, it can provide a scientific basis for healthy development of urban ecological systems...|$|R
5|$|As {{with other}} ratites, emus have a {{relatively}} low basal metabolic rate compared to other types of birds.

5|$|Because of the {{differences}} in <b>the</b> <b>metabolic</b> pathways of NAD biosynthesis between organisms, such as between bacteria and humans, this area of metabolism is a promising area for the development of new antibiotics. For example, the enzyme nicotinamidase, which converts nicotinamide to nicotinic acid, is a target for drug design, as this enzyme is absent in humans but present in yeast and bacteria.|$|E

5|$|One set of {{characteristics}} relate to body size and temperature. <b>The</b> <b>metabolic</b> theory of ecology provides a predictive qualitative set {{of relationships between}} an organism’s body size and temperature and metabolic processes. In general, smaller, warmer organisms have higher metabolic rates and {{this results in a}} variety of predictions regarding individual somatic growth rates, reproduction and population growth rates, population size, and resource uptake rates.|$|E
5|$|Oxidative {{phosphorylation}} (or OXPHOS in short) is <b>the</b> <b>metabolic</b> pathway {{in which}} cells use enzymes to oxidize nutrients, thereby releasing energy {{which is used}} to produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP). In most eukaryotes, this takes place inside mitochondria. Almost all aerobic organisms carry out oxidative phosphorylation. This pathway is probably so pervasive because it is a highly efficient way of releasing energy, compared to alternative fermentation processes such as anaerobic glycolysis.|$|E

5|$|Several hormone {{deficiencies}} {{associated with}} hypopituitarism {{may lead to}} secondary diseases.

5|$|An {{idea of the}} {{complexity}} of <b>the</b> <b>metabolic</b> networks in cells that contain thousands of different enzymes is given by the figure showing the interactions between just 43 proteins and 40 metabolites to the right: the sequences of genomes provide lists containing anything up to 45,000 genes. However, it is now possible to use this genomic data to reconstruct complete networks of biochemical reactions and produce more holistic mathematical models that may explain and predict their behavior. These models are especially powerful when used to integrate the pathway and metabolite data obtained through classical methods with data on gene expression from proteomic and DNA microarray studies. Using these techniques, a model of human metabolism has now been produced, which will guide future drug discovery and biochemical research. These models are now used in network analysis, to classify human diseases into groups that share common proteins or metabolites.|$|E
5|$|Animals {{and plants}} {{have evolved to}} {{synthesise}} {{a vast array of}} poisonous products including secondary metabolites, peptides and proteins that can act as inhibitors. Natural toxins are usually small organic molecules and are so diverse that there are probably natural inhibitors for most metabolic processes. <b>The</b> <b>metabolic</b> processes targeted by natural poisons encompass more than enzymes in metabolic pathways and can also include the inhibition of receptor, channel and structural protein functions in a cell. For example, paclitaxel (taxol), an organic molecule found in the Pacific yew tree, binds tightly to tubulin dimers and inhibits their assembly into microtubules in the cytoskeleton.|$|E

5|$|Environmental {{sociology}} is {{the study}} of human interactions with the natural environment, typically emphasizing human dimensions of environmental problems, social impacts of those problems, and efforts to resolve them. As with other sub-fields of sociology, scholarship in environmental sociology may be at one or multiple levels of analysis, from global (e.g. world-systems) to local, societal to individual. Attention is paid also to the processes by which environmental problems become defined and known to humans. As argued by notable environmental sociologist John Bellamy Foster, the predecessor to modern environmental sociology is Marx's analysis of <b>the</b> <b>metabolic</b> rift, which influenced contemporary thought on sustainability. Environmental sociology is often interdisciplinary and overlaps with the sociology of risk, rural sociology and the sociology of disaster.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} {{conserve}} {{energy and water}} in their highly seasonal environment, mouse lemurs and dwarf lemurs exhibit seasonal behavioral cycles of dormancy where <b>the</b> <b>metabolic</b> rate and body temperature are lowered. They are the only primates known to do so. They accumulate fat reserves in their hind legs and the base of their tail before the dry winter season, when food and water are scarce, and can exhibit daily and prolonged torpor during the dry season. Daily torpor constitutes less than 24 hours of dormancy, whereas prolonged torpor averages two weeks in duration and signals hibernation. Mouse lemurs have been observed experiencing torpor that lasts for several consecutive days, but dwarf lemurs are known to hibernate for six to eight months every year, particularly {{on the west coast}} of Madagascar.|$|E
5|$|In {{the ninth}} century, Hrabanus Maurus and Ratramnus also defended Augustine's view of nonmetabolic real presence.

The doctrine of transubstantiation was developed in the high Middle Ages to explain the change of the elements into Christ's body and blood. Transubstantiation is the belief that the Eucharistic elements are transformed into Christ's body and blood in a way only perceivable by the intellect, not by the senses.|$|E

40|$|The present thesis {{consists}} of four studies with the main objective to examine the significance of <b>the</b> skeletal muscular <b>metabolic</b> capacity during whole body exercise. Exercise capacity was studied in chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD) patients and a control group in study I, and in endurance‐trained subjects and normal physical active subjects in study II. In both studies, muscular metabolic capacity was quantified during exercise with a small muscle mass (1. 7 ‐ 2. 8 kg) to avoid the issue of muscular oxygen uptake being limited by oxygen supply. Thereafter, we tested how much <b>the</b> muscular <b>metabolic</b> capacity could be exploited during whole body exercise (bicycling). Exploitation less than 100 % indicated a muscular metabolic reserve probably due to oxygen supply limitations. <b>The</b> muscular <b>metabolic</b> capacity ranged from 264 to 570 ml. kg‐ 1. min‐ 1 for the four groups. However, there was less variation in the relative exploitation of <b>the</b> muscular <b>metabolic</b> capacity during whole body exercise for the healthy groups (31 %‐ 37 %), while this percentage was smaller (17 %) for the COPD patients. Based on these results, we concluded that the exploitation of <b>the</b> muscular <b>metabolic</b> capacity was relatively equal for the healthy groups despite large differences in age and maximal oxygen uptake (VO 2 max). The COPD patients were least capable of exploiting <b>the</b> muscular <b>metabolic</b> capacity during bicycling and consequently, they had a relatively higher muscular metabolic reserve during whole body exercise compared with healthy subjects...|$|R
