5|$|Harris {{contacts}} Flynn, {{telling him}} that anti-venom {{will be ready for}} the passengers when they land. However, Flynn discovers that the cockpit is filled with snakes and Rick is dead. After a brief discussion, Troy, Three Gs' bodyguard, agrees to land the plane based on prior flight experience. After everyone gets prepared, Flynn shoots out two windows with his pistol, causing the plane <b>to</b> <b>depressurize.</b> The snakes are blown out of the cockpit and the lower floor of the plane. Flynn and Troy take the controls of the plane and Troy reveals that his flight experience was from a video game flight simulator. Despite his lack of real-world experience, after Troy makes an emergency landing, the plane makes it to the terminal. The passengers leave the plane and anti-venom is given to those who need it. Just as Flynn and Sean are about to disembark the plane, a final snake jumps out and bites Sean in the chest. Flynn draws his gun and shoots the snake, and paramedics rush to Sean, who is unharmed due to his wearing a ballistic vest. As a token of gratitude, Sean later takes Flynn to Bali and teaches him how to surf.|$|E
50|$|When Aenea and Endymion arrive inParvati space, de Soya {{is waiting}} to stop them. Aenea threatens <b>to</b> <b>depressurize</b> the old Consul's ship and die, and since de Soya's orders are to catch her alive, he has to let her go.|$|E
50|$|On August 27, 2016, Southwest Airlines flight 3472, a Boeing 737-700 {{flying from}} New Orleans to Orlando with 104 persons on board, {{suffered}} an uncontained engine failure while climbing to cruise altitude over the Gulf of Mexico. The debris punctured the fuselage, which caused the cabin <b>to</b> <b>depressurize.</b> The captain diverted {{the flight to}} Pensacola, where it landed safely and uneventfully 10 minutes later. There were no fatalities or injuries.|$|E
50|$|Steam pulsing: air {{dilution}} {{by using}} a series of steam pulses, in which the chamber is alternately pressurized and then <b>depressurized</b> <b>to</b> near atmospheric pressure.|$|R
40|$|A piston and {{cylinder}} assembly is disclosed which is constructed {{of polyvinyl chloride}} that uses local water pressure to perform small lifting tasks. The chamber is either pressurized to extend the piston or <b>depressurized</b> <b>to</b> retract the piston. The present invention is best utilized for raising and lowering toilet seats...|$|R
50|$|In 2011, Martha {{is charged}} with a mission to stop a white {{supremacist}} terrorist group from destroying the White House with a huge orbiting laser cannon. Martha kills the terrorists in the space station's control room, but not before the leader is able to voice the command to fire the pre-targeted cannon. Several terrorists fire at Martha with machine guns, ripping a large hole in the outer hull, causing the station <b>to</b> violently <b>depressurize.</b> While struggling <b>to</b> reach the station's computer room, Martha discovers a child test subject she encountered at the psychiatric hospital. Martha convinces her to stop the firing sequence.|$|R
50|$|Originally {{planned for}} the second revolution, the astronauts {{postponed}} the EVA until the third after McDivitt decided that White, following {{the stress of the}} launch and the failed rendezvous, looked tired and hot. After a rest, the pair finished performing the checklist for the EVA. Flying over Carnarvon, Australia, they began <b>to</b> <b>depressurize</b> the cabin. Over Hawaii, White pulled the handle to open his hatch, but the latches failed to move.|$|E
50|$|The galley, toilet, sleep locations, storage lockers, and {{the side}} hatch for {{entering}} and exiting the orbiter were also located on the mid-deck, {{as well as the}} airlock. The airlock had an additional hatch into the payload bay. This airlock allowed two or three astronauts, wearing their Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU) space suits, <b>to</b> <b>depressurize</b> before a walk in space (EVA), and also to repressurize and re-enter the orbiter {{at the conclusion of the}} EVA.|$|E
5000|$|... 14:00 - {{the outside}} {{panel of the}} pilot's L-4 window shattered. The heat in the cockpit was {{unbearable}} at this time and had cracked the glass case for the ball on both pilot's and co-pilot's turn and slip indicators. It is estimated that the upper compartment heat level ranged from 125-160 degrees F or higher during this period. A decision was made <b>to</b> <b>depressurize</b> the aircraft and attempt to continue the mission. Altitude was 33,500 feet.|$|E
30|$|Ash {{is removed}} {{at the end}} of the retort with an {{integrated}} water-cooled auger system. The ash is <b>depressurized</b> <b>to</b> ambient conditions through a valve-lock/hopper system. The solid particles are composed primarily of unconverted carbon, silica, metal oxides, and trace minerals. The ash has commercial applications including as a soil enhancer and in ceramics manufacturing.|$|R
40|$|The Prebreathe Reduction Program (PRP) used {{exercise}} during oxygen prebreathe {{to reduce}} necessary prebreathe time prior <b>to</b> <b>depressurizing</b> <b>to</b> {{work in a}} 4. 3 psi suit during extravehicular activity (EVA). Initial testing produced a two-hour protocol incorporating ergometry exercise and a 30 min cycle of depress/repress to 10. 2 psi where subjects breathed 26. 5 % oxygen/balance nitrogen (Phase II - 10 min at 75 % peak oxygen consumption [VO 2 peak] followed by 40 min intermittent light exercise [ILE] [approx. 5. 8 mL-per kilogram- per minute], then 50 min of rest). The Phase II protocol (0 / 45 DCS) was approved for operations and has been used on 40 EVAs, providing significant time savings compared to the standard 4 h resting oxygen prebreathe. The Phase V effort focused on performing all light in-suit exercise. Two oxygen prebreathe protocols were tested sequentially: V- 4) 160 min prebreathe with 150 min of continuous ILE. The entire protocol was completed at 14. 7 psi. All exercise involved upper body effort. Exercise continued until decompression. V- 5) 160 min prebreathe with 140 min of ILE - first 40 min at 14. 7 psi, then 30 min at 10. 2 psi (breathing 26. 5 % oxygen) after a 20 min depress, simulating a suit donning period. Subjects were then repressed to 14. 7 psi and performed another 50 min of lower body ILE, followed by 50 min rest before decompression. The V- 4 protocol was rejected with 3 DCS/ 6 person-exposures. Initial V- 5 testing has produced 0 DCS/ 11 person-exposures (ongoing trials). The difference in DCS rate was significant (Fisher Exact p= 0. 029). The observations of DCS were significantly lower in early V- 5 trials than in V- 4 trials. Additional studies are required to evaluate the relative contribution of the variables in exercise distribution, the 10. 2 psi depress/repress component, pre-decompression rest, or possible variation in total oxygen consumption...|$|R
50|$|Absorption {{heat pumps}} are {{a kind of}} air-source heat pump, but they do not depend on {{electricity}} to power them. Instead, gas, solar power, or heated water is used as a main power source. An absorption pump dissolves ammonia gas in water, which gives off heat. Next, the water and ammonia mixture is <b>depressurized</b> <b>to</b> induce boiling, and the ammonia is boiled off, which absorbs heat from the outdoor air.|$|R
50|$|Once {{they were}} awake, {{it was decided}} to start their {{preparations}} for the first lunar EVA of their mission. As with everything in Apollo, it was an involved procedure. Not only did they have to prepare Falcon, but had to don their space suits. Apollo 15 was the first crew that got to sleep in long johns rather than having to stay in their space suits. It would not be until four hours after waking up that Mission Control gave the Go <b>to</b> <b>depressurize</b> the LM.|$|E
50|$|The next {{destination}} is Renaissance Vector. De Soya's team, after dying and resurrecting again, {{is ready to}} stop her this time even if she tries <b>to</b> <b>depressurize</b> the ship. Aenea convinces him to allow her ship to land, but instead she flies the ship along the old River Tethys {{through one of the}} farcaster portals, all of which have been inactive since the Fall of Hyperion. De Soya guesses her plan at the last moment and attempts to disable Aenea's ship, but too late to prevent it from farcasting.|$|E
50|$|The {{fourth day}} saw the fourth planned midcourse correction, {{although}} {{it was only the}} second actually performed on the mission. The burn lasted 0.91 seconds, adding 5.4 ft/s (1.65 m/s) to their speed. The crew then put on their A7L space suits for the jettisoning of the SIM bay door. This door was jettisoned using explosive cord and there was a small risk that it could cause the spacecraft <b>to</b> <b>depressurize.</b> It was possible, in an emergency for the crew to spend the cruise back to Earth in their pressurized space suits.|$|E
25|$|In a {{conventional}} design with a pressurized core, refuelling the system requires the core {{to shut down}} and the pressure vessel to be opened. Due to the arrangement used in CANDU, only the single tube being refuelled needs <b>to</b> be <b>depressurized.</b> This allows the CANDU system to be continually refuelled without shutting down, another major design goal. In modern systems, two robotic machines hook up to the reactor faces and open the end caps of a pressure tube. One machine pushes in the new fuel, whereby the depleted fuel is pushed out and collected at the other end. A significant operational advantage of online refuelling is that a failed or leaking fuel bundle can {{be removed from the}} core once it has been located, thus reducing the radiation levels in the primary cooling loop.|$|R
5000|$|During the Apollo missions, {{the astronauts}} donned their space suits inside the Apollo Lunar Module cabin, {{which was then}} <b>depressurized</b> <b>to</b> allow them to exit the vehicle. Upon the end of EVA, the astronauts would {{re-enter}} the cabin in their suits, bringing with them {{a great deal of}} dust which had adhered to the suits. Several astronauts reported a [...] "gunpowder" [...] smell and respiratory and/or eye irritation upon opening their helmets and being exposed to the dust.|$|R
50|$|There {{are three}} primary {{components}} to a blower door: (1) a calibrated, variable-speed fan, capable of inducing {{a range of}} airflows sufficient <b>to</b> pressurize and <b>depressurize</b> a variety of building sizes, (2) a pressure measurement instrument, called a manometer, to simultaneously measure the pressure differential induced {{across the face of}} the fan and across the building envelope, as a result of fan airflow, and (3) a mounting system, used to mount the fan in a building opening, such as a door or a window.|$|R
50|$|The {{unmanned}} spacecraft was destroyed on its third orbit around Earth. Two ground control stations, one in Klyuchi {{and the other}} in Yelisovo, sent simultaneous commands instructing the craft <b>to</b> <b>depressurize</b> its airlock. The craft interpreted this as an order to begin descent and a propulsion error put the craft into a tumble. Approximately twenty-nine minutes later the craft's automatic self-destruct function activated. The craft was completely destroyed to prevent sensitive information from literally falling into enemy hands. Over 100 pieces of the spacecraft were tracked, falling into the ocean between 31 March and 6 April 1965.|$|E
50|$|The SEV is {{the size}} of a small pickup truck, it has 12 wheels, and can house two astronauts for up to two weeks. The SEV {{consists}} of a chassis and cabin module. The SEV will allow the attachment of tools such as cranes, cable reels, backhoes and winches. Designed for 2, this vehicle is capable of supporting 4 in an emergency. With wheels that can pivot 360 degrees, the SEV is able to drive in any direction. Astronauts can enter and exit without space suits directly from an airlock docking hatch, or through a suitport without the need <b>to</b> <b>depressurize</b> the habitat module.|$|E
5000|$|Doctor Crusher and Lieutenant Commander La Forge {{are in a}} {{cargo bay}} {{examining}} a recent supply of thruster fuel. When the disaster strikes, they are trapped in the bay, and find that a plasma fire has erupted in a nearby panel; {{it is not only}} letting off potentially lethal radiation affecting them, but also destabilizing the fuel, risking an explosion. They {{come up with a plan}} <b>to</b> <b>depressurize</b> the bay, not only dousing the fire due to lack of oxygen, but also removing the fuel during the explosive depressurization. They safely hold on during this process and eventually reseal the bay with fresh air.|$|E
2500|$|The fuel is {{uranium dioxide}} pellets, enriched to 2.5-3.5%, in {{stainless}} steel tubes. The original design {{concept of the}} AGR was to use a beryllium based cladding. When this proved unsuitable due to brittle fracture, the enrichment level of the fuel was raised {{to allow for the}} higher neutron capture losses of stainless steel cladding. This significantly increased the cost of the power produced by an AGR. [...] The carbon dioxide coolant circulates through the core, reaching [...] and a pressure of around 40 bar (580 psi), and then passes through boiler (steam generator) assemblies outside the core but still within the steel-lined, reinforced concrete pressure vessel. Control rods penetrate the graphite moderator and a secondary system involves injecting nitrogen into the coolant to hold the reactor temperature down. A tertiary shutdown system which operates by injecting boron balls into the reactor is included in case the reactor has <b>to</b> be <b>depressurized</b> with insufficient control rods lowered. This would mean that nitrogen pressure can not be maintained.|$|R
5000|$|The Gemini capsule was an {{enlarged}} {{version of the}} Mercury, with a 7.5 ft-diameter heat shield. Propulsion, electrical power, attitude control and retrorockets were placed in an external equipment module (unknowingly, similar to the Vostok design) which adapted the capsule to the 10 ft-diameter Gemini-Titan launch vehicle. Thrusters were added for translation control as well as attitude control, and the forward thrusters allowed the spacecraft to change its orbital inclination and altitude. Batteries were replaced with hydrogen-oxygen fuel cells for long-duration power generation. The spacecraft could stay in orbit {{for up to two}} weeks. The capsule had two hatch doors that could be opened and closed in flight, allowing extra-vehicular activity (EVA, known as [...] "space-walking"). The avionics equipment inside the capsule did not require ambient air cooling, allowing the cabin <b>to</b> be <b>depressurized</b> during EVA. The launch escape system used astronaut ejection seats instead of an external escape rocket tower. The complete spacecraft weighed 7100 to 8350 lb.|$|R
5000|$|Menzies and Meek could {{immediately}} {{be removed}} from the Sea Link and were transferred to the decompression chamber aboard the Tringa. However, with the divers compartment still pressurized, any attempt to remove Link and Stover would have been fatal to them, assuming they were still alive. The Sea Link was transferred aboard the Sea Diver. Link and Stover were visible through the diving compartments view ports but showed no evident vital signs. The compartment was force ventilated with a helium-oxygen mixture while remaining pressurized, and hot water was sprayed over it in an attempt to raise its internal temperature. On the morning of June 19, medical doctors concluded that Link and Stover were dead, and the compartment began <b>to</b> be <b>depressurized.</b> Link and Stover were brought to the Florida Keys Memorial Hospital on Key West, where their autopsies were performed. Both mens cause of death was listed as [...] "Respiratory Acidosis due to Carbon Dioxide Poisoning".|$|R
50|$|On August 15, {{the next}} Juno II was flown, {{carrying}} the Beacon satellite. While first stage performance was nominal, the upper stages malfunctioned. One intended experiment on this mission was the ejection of four flares stowed in the interstage section {{which would be}} tracked and photographed during the launch. However, things went awry when the flare ejection failed to take place on schedule. The control system also malfunctioned and drove the upper stages into the Atlantic Ocean instead of orbit. It was concluded {{that one of the}} flares deployed inside the interstage section instead of outside like it was intended to, causing the guidance compartment <b>to</b> <b>depressurize</b> and cause loss of vehicle control.|$|E
50|$|It took 23 {{minutes from}} the engine {{shutdown}} until the fuselage was accessed. Saudi reports stated that the crew could not get the plug-type doors to open in time. It is assumed that most passengers and flight attendants were incapacitated during the landing roll, or {{they would not have}} attempted to open a door on a moving aircraft. It is known that the aircraft remained pressurized during the landing roll as the cabin pressurization system was on standby, and the aircraft was found with both pressurization hatches almost completely closed. The pressurization hatches should have opened completely on touchdown <b>to</b> <b>depressurize</b> the aircraft. The crew were found still in their flight-station seats.|$|E
50|$|Anderson {{speculates that}} the true {{intention}} of the ICBM warning devices is to monitor the aliens, and that the devices {{are the source of}} the interference, only to discover something has destroyed them when they attempt to switch them off. Walker shows signs of a developing infection and he becomes increasingly paranoid. The mission cameras capture the rock samples moving around in the interior of Liberty, revealing that the aliens are camouflaged as moon rocks. Increasingly delusional, Walker attempts to destroy the cameras within Liberty, but he accidentally damages the system controls, causing Liberty <b>to</b> <b>depressurize.</b> Realizing the Soviet LK is their only source of oxygen, the pair travel towards the LK lander in their lunar rover. Walker causes the vehicle to crash as he runs away, believing he should not leave the moon because of the risk of spreading the infection to Earth.|$|E
50|$|The {{supercritical}} solvent {{is passed}} into a vessel at lower pressure than the extraction vessel. The density, and hence dissolving power, of supercritical fluids varies sharply with pressure, {{and hence the}} solubility in the lower density CO2 is much lower, and the material precipitates for collection. It is possible to fractionate the dissolved material using a series of vessels at reducing pressure. The CO2 can be recycled or <b>depressurized</b> <b>to</b> atmospheric pressure and vented. For analytical SFE, the pressure is usually dropped to atmospheric, and the now gaseous carbon dioxide bubbled through a solvent to trap the precipitated components.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: 2 ̆ 2 This work {{presents}} {{a model to}} determine the annualized cost optimal design of a pressure swing adsorption (PSA) separation system. Design decisions include the number of beds, the operations to use, the scheduling of those operations, and the operating conditions. Operations include adsorption, pressure equalization, blowdown, desorption, and feed repressurization. Operations can be interconnected such as pressurizing one bed by connecting it to another which is <b>to</b> be <b>depressurized.</b> The capital and operating costs and adsorption behavior of each operation in the operating sequence is approximated {{by a set of}} algebraic equations, which, due to the level of error in determining the physical properties, {{has been found to be}} sufficiently accurate to characterizethe system. The paper presents each of these operation models and the assumptions behind them. The structure of the model is a mixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP), the solution of which determines the optimal operating configuration, size, and operating conditions.

50|$|Following the {{completion}} of the transfer, the crew resealed the hatches between the crafts and prepared to jettison the LM. This was different from the undocking that took place before landing. In this case it would be an explosive jettison as much of the docking probe structure was now unneeded and will stay in the LM. There was some difficulty in getting the tunnel between the crafts <b>to</b> <b>depressurize.</b> This suggested that there was an improperly sealed hatch, delaying the separation by one orbit. After checking the hatches the crew could not find a cause for the improper seal, but the tunnel now vented successfully. In his 2001 memoir, Flight Director Christopher Kraft wrote that some of these difficulties may have been the result of crew fatigue. Because of the longer lunar stay time, by this point Scott and Irwin had gone an arduous 22 hours without sleep, and both men had experienced some heart irregularities on the lunar surface after their EVAs. Kraft wrote that coordination between ground controllers and the crew broke down several times {{at this point in the}} mission, and he recalled this as one of the most stressful experiences during his career in mission control.|$|E
50|$|Shortly {{after takeoff}} from Cold Bay Airport on the Alaska Peninsula {{for a flight}} across the {{northern}} Pacific Ocean to Seattle, Washington with ten passengers, {{the crew of the}} Electra noted an unusual vibration in the aircraft, but were unable to isolate the source. As the aircraft climbed from FL190 (approximately 19,000 ft) to FL250 (approximately 25,000 ft), the flight engineer left the cockpit to visually check the engines from the passenger cabin, but saw nothing amiss. The flight attendant went into the cockpit to discuss the vibration, which suddenly increased in intensity as she went back into the cabin. She looked out a window {{just in time to see}} the propeller of No. 4 engine (the outboard engine on the right wing) detach itself and fly spinning under the fuselage. The propeller tore a gash 8 ft long in the aircraft's belly, causing the cabin <b>to</b> <b>depressurize</b> and jamming the flight controls and engine throttle controls. The pilots managed to gain some control of the aircraft by using the autopilot and diverted the aircraft to Anchorage. With the engine throttle controls jammed at cruise power, on approach to land the crew were able to make the aircraft descend and climb after shutting down No. 2 (the left inboard) engine in combination with lowering and raising the landing gear.|$|E

500|$|Prior to the 2016 {{model year}} the Volt {{required}} premium gasoline of (R+M)/2 octane rating of 91 or higher because the higher octane permitted the 10.5:1 compression ratio engine to utilize more ignition timing advance {{in order to}} maximize its fuel efficiency by 5 to 10% as compared to regular gasoline. For users who drive mostly in electric mode and to avoid maintenance problems caused by storing the same gasoline in the tank for months, the 2011 Volt has a sealed and pressurized fuel tank to avoid evaporation, and as a result, the fuel filler has <b>to</b> be <b>depressurized</b> before opening the tank. Also the engine management system monitors the time between engine running and it is programmed to prompt the driver to run past the [...] all-electric range before recharging in order to consume some gasoline. If the driver does not run on gasoline, the system will automatically run the maintenance mode which starts the engine to consume some of the aging fuel and circulate the fluids within the engine.
