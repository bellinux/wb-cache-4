5|$|After {{seeing the}} success of Pee-wee's Big Adventure, the CBS network {{approached}} Reubens with an ill-received cartoon series proposal. In 1986, CBS agreed to sign Reubens to act, produce, and direct his live-action children's program, Pee-wee's Playhouse, with a budget of $325,000 per episode, <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>price</b> as a prime-time sitcom, and no creative interference from CBS; although CBS did request a few minor changes throughout the years.

5|$|The Philadelphia Mint struck 20,000 gold {{dollars in}} August and October 1916, plus 26 extra {{reserved}} for {{inspection and testing}} at the 1917 meeting of the United States Assay Commission.

The Association sold these {{to the public at}} $3 each, <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>price</b> at which the Louisiana Purchase pieces, which sold poorly, had been vended. The McKinley Memorial pieces were ill-publicized, and few were sold at full price. Texas coin dealer B.

However at Plymouth he failed to find success, and was instead transferred to Burnley for £200,000 after just twelve months.

5|$|PlayStation 4 Slim (officially marketed {{simply as}} PlayStation 4 or PS4) was {{unveiled}} on September 7, 2016. It is {{a revision of}} the original PS4 hardware with a streamlined form factor. The new casing is 40% smaller, and carries a rounded body with a matte finish {{on the top of}} the console rather than a two-tone finish. The two USB ports on the front have a larger gap between them, and the optical audio port was also removed. It ships with a minor update to the DualShock 4 controller, with the light bar visible through the top of the touchpad and dark matte grey coloured exterior instead of a partially shiny black.

5|$|In July 2007, Sony {{announced}} {{a drop in}} the price of the console by $100. This measure only applied to the 60 GB models and was exclusive to the United States and Canada, where those models are no longer in production.

25|$|Larger chains {{have felt}} the impact of {{discount}} retailers, with some customers switching from larger supermarket retailers for everyday necessities. To entice customers into their stores from larger supermarket chains, Poundland advertise familiar brands at competitive prices, with the hope customers may then be inclined to impulse buy other products such as own-brand that they otherwise wouldn't have purchased. Asda reduced some branded product prices such as Colgate toothpaste to £1 in January 2009, in competition with Poundland who offered the same products at the £1 price; in response, Poundland introduced multi-buy offers to provide a larger quantity of the products for <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>price.</b> However, research conducted by The Grocer magazine in August 2009 found that of the 1300-odd supposedly discounted ASDA products, a third were <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>price</b> as in March 2008 and 173 products had been selling for less than £1 during Spring 2009.|$|E
25|$|Under {{the price}} {{priority}} rule, a selling (buying) order {{with the lowest}} (highest) price takes precedence. Under the time priority rule, an earlier order takes precedence over others at <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>price.</b> Thus, when the lowest sell and the highest buy orders match in price, the transaction is executed at the price. In short, the TSE market is a pure order-driven Market.|$|E
