25|$|Humbert and Dolores begin {{traveling}} {{across the}} country, driving {{all day and}} staying in motels. To keep Dolores from going to the police or running away, Humbert points out she would likely wind up in a state-run orphanage if she leaves him, a prospect she's terrified of. He manipulates her with gifts of money and clothing in return for sexual favors. Paranoid and jealous, Humbert controls Dolores's movements carefully and forbids her from associating with other teenagers. After a year of touring the United States, Humbert takes Dolores to settle in the fictional New England town of Beardsley, and enrolls her in a girls' school {{at the start of}} the school year where Humbert reluctantly grants Dolores permission to join the school play which, unbeknownst to Humbert, was written by Quilty.

25|$|Fincher {{intended}} to make The Game before Seven, but when Brad Pitt became available for Seven, that project took priority. The success of Seven helped the producers of The Game get the larger budget that they wanted. Then, they approached Michael Douglas to star in the film. He was hesitant at first because of concerns that PolyGram was not a big enough company to distribute the film. However, once on board, Douglas' presence helped get the film into production. At the 1996 Cannes Film Festival, PolyGram announced that Jodie Foster would be starring in the film with Douglas. However, Fincher was uncomfortable with putting a movie star of her stature in a supporting part. After <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> he considered rewriting the character of Conrad as Nicholas' daughter so that Foster could play that role. However, the actress had a scheduling conflict with the Robert Zemeckis film Contact and could not appear in The Game. Once she left, the role of Conrad was offered to Jeff Bridges but he declined and Sean Penn was cast instead. Deborah Kara Unger's audition {{for the role of}} Christine was a test reel consisting of a two-minute sex scene from David Cronenberg's Crash. Douglas thought it was a joke but when he and Fincher met her in person, they were impressed by her acting.|$|E
