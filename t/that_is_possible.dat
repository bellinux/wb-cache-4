5|$|The maximum hair length <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> {{to reach}} is about 15cm (6in) for infants (below {{the age of}} 1), about 60cm (24in) for children, and {{generally}} 100cm (40in) for adults. Documentation for decrease of the maximum length with age cannot {{be found in the}} literature. Some individuals can reach excessive lengths. Lengths greater than 150cm (59in) are frequently observed in long hair contests. Xie Qiuping had the longest documented hair in the world, measuring 5.627 m (18ft 5.54 in) in May 2004.|$|E
5|$|Toxic {{peptides}} from Amanita {{species have}} been widely used in biological research as chemical agents to inhibit RNA polymerase II, an enzyme essential for protein synthesis. However, these toxic peptides can only be obtained from fruit bodies collected from natural habitats, and are consequently expensive. Some success has been reported in extracting peptide toxins directly from the mycelia of Amanita exitialis grown in liquid culture. Although the toxin concentration in the mycelium is only about 10% of that in fruiting bodies, the authors suggest <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> to increase the amatoxin production by optimizing the growth conditions.|$|E
5|$|The {{pattern of}} 105.5, 8, 121.5 and 8 years {{is not the}} only pattern <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> within the 243-year cycle, because of the slight {{mismatch}} between the times when the Earth and Venus arrive at the point of conjunction. Prior to 1518, the pattern of transits was 8, 113.5 and 121.5 years, and the eight inter-transit gaps before the AD 546 transit were 121.5 years apart. The current pattern will continue until 2846, when it will be replaced by a pattern of 105.5, 129.5 and 8 years. Thus, the 243-year cycle is relatively stable, but the number of transits and their timing within the cycle will vary over time. Since the 243:395 Earth:Venus commensurability is only approximate, there are different sequences of transits occurring 243 years apart, each extending for several thousand years, which are eventually replaced by other sequences. For instance, there is a series which ended in 541 BC, and the series which includes 2117 only started in AD 1631.|$|E

Length-tension refers to the max tension that can be created over the muscle fiber strain range and force-velocity refers to the power <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> of the fiber compared to the shortening velocity.

25|$|The {{pressure}} {{changes during}} ascent and descent may affect gas {{spaces in the}} diver and diving equipment. A change in pressure will cause a pressure difference between the gas space and environment which will cause the gas to expand or compress if <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>possible,</b> and constraining the gas from expanding or compressing to balance the pressure may cause damage to the surrounding material or tissues by over-expansion or crushing. Some gas spaces, such as the mask, will automatically release excess gas as it expands during ascent, but have to be equalized during compression of descent.|$|E

25|$|The {{programs}} used in computational chemistry {{are based}} on many different quantum-chemical methods that solve the molecular Schrödinger equation associated with the molecular Hamiltonian. Methods that do not include any empirical or semi-empirical parameters in their equations– being derived directly from theoretical principles, with no inclusion of experimental data– are called ab initio methods. This {{does not imply that}} the solution is an exact one; they are all approximate quantum mechanical calculations. It means that a particular approximation is rigorously defined on first principles (quantum theory) and then solved within an error margin that is qualitatively known beforehand. If numerical iterative methods must be used, the aim is to iterate until full machine accuracy is obtained (the best <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> with a finite word length on the computer, and within the mathematical and/or physical approximations made).|$|E
25|$|The {{pressure}} {{changes during}} ascent and descent may affect gas {{spaces in the}} diver and diving equipment. A change in pressure will cause a pressure difference between the gas space and environment which will cause the gas to expand or compress if <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>possible,</b> and constraining the gas from expanding or compressing to balance the pressure may cause damage to the surrounding material or tissues by over-expansion or crushing. Some gas spaces, such as the mask, will automatically release excess gas as it expands, but have to be equalized during compression, others, such as the buoyancy compensator bladder, will expand until the over-pressure valve opens. The ears are a special case, as they will usually vent naturally through the Eustachian tubes, but these may be blocked. During descent they do not usually equalize automatically, and must be intentionally equalized by the diver, using one of several possible methods. Most of the physiological airway automatically equalizes {{as long as the}} diver is breathing normally, but holding the breath can prevent equalization of the lower airways and lungs, which can lead to barotrauma.|$|E

500|$|Lukather's {{approach}} to engineering his {{sound in the}} studio is usually simple. He is not known for doing {{a large number of}} takes or for incorporating much overdubbing—rather, he has a reputation for doing only single takes for many parts. He has said about this approach: [...] "If a solo didn't work—either because I didn't have the right sound, or because I wasn't inspired at that moment—I'd just move on. A part either works or it doesn't. You can't batter it into submission, or force inspiration to save you. It's always better to just surrender, and then come back later to give it a go with fresh ears." [...] Although he enjoys the technical mastery <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> in the studio, Lukather prefers the dynamic of performing live on stage. He has stated that dynamics are the most important element of producing a recording with good sound quality.|$|E
