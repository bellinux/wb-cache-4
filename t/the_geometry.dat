5|$|Bike {{maneuverability}} {{and handling}} {{is difficult to}} quantify for several reasons. <b>The</b> <b>geometry</b> of a bike, especially the steering axis angle makes kinematic analysis complicated. Under many conditions, bikes are inherently unstable and must always be under rider control. Finally, the rider's skill has a large influence on the bike's performance in any maneuver. Bike designs tend to consist of a trade-off between maneuverability and stability.|$|E

5|$|About an {{hour after}} {{fragment}} K entered Jupiter, observers recorded auroral emission near the impact region, {{as well as at}} the antipode of the impact site with respect to Jupiter's strong magnetic field. The cause of these emissions was difficult to establish due to a lack of knowledge of Jupiter's internal magnetic field and of <b>the</b> <b>geometry</b> of the impact sites. One possible explanation was that upwardly accelerating shock waves from the impact accelerated charged particles enough to cause auroral emission, a phenomenon more typically associated with fast-moving solar wind particles striking a planetary atmosphere near a magnetic pole.|$|E
5|$|Broaching was {{originally}} developed for machining internal keyways. However, {{it was soon}} discovered that broaching is very useful for machining other surfaces and shapes for high volume workpieces. Because each broach is specialized to cut just one shape, either the broach must be specially designed for <b>the</b> <b>geometry</b> of the workpiece or the workpiece must be designed around a standard broach geometry. A customized broach is usually only viable with high volume workpieces, because the broach can cost US$15,000 to US$30,000 to produce.|$|E
5|$|Closely {{related to}} light {{deflection}} is the gravitational time delay (or Shapiro delay), the phenomenon that light signals {{take longer to}} move through a gravitational field than they would {{in the absence of}} that field. There have been numerous successful tests of this prediction. In the parameterized post-Newtonian formalism (PPN), measurements of both the deflection of light and the gravitational time delay determine a parameter called γ, which encodes the influence of gravity on <b>the</b> <b>geometry</b> of space.|$|E

5|$|Current {{understanding}} of gravity {{is based on}} Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity. Formulated in 1915, general relativity explains gravity in terms of <b>the</b> <b>geometry</b> of space and time, or spacetime. It is formulated {{in the language of}} classical physics developed by physicists such as Isaac Newton and James Clerk Maxwell. The other nongravitational forces are explained in the framework of quantum mechanics. Developed {{in the first half of}} the twentieth century by a number of different physicists, quantum mechanics provides a radically different way of describing physical phenomena based on probability.|$|E
5|$|For surfaces, the {{generalization}} from <b>the</b> <b>geometry</b> {{of a plane}} –a flat surface– {{to that of a}} general curved surface had been described in the early 19th century by Carl Friedrich Gauss. This description had in turn been generalized to higher-dimensional spaces in a mathematical formalism introduced by Bernhard Riemann in the 1850s. With the help of Riemannian geometry, Einstein formulated a geometric description of gravity in which Minkowski's spacetime is replaced by distorted, curved spacetime, just as curved surfaces are a generalization of ordinary plane surfaces. Embedding Diagrams are used to illustrate curved spacetime in educational contexts.|$|E
5|$|Given the {{difficulty}} of finding exact solutions, Einstein's field equations are also solved frequently by numerical integration on a computer, or by considering small perturbations of exact solutions. In the field of numerical relativity, powerful computers are employed to simulate <b>the</b> <b>geometry</b> of spacetime and to solve Einstein's equations for interesting situations such as two colliding black holes. In principle, such methods may be applied to any system, given sufficient computer resources, and may address fundamental questions such as naked singularities. Approximate solutions may also be found by perturbation theories such as linearized gravity and its generalization, the post-Newtonian expansion, {{both of which were}} developed by Einstein. The latter provides a systematic approach to solving for <b>the</b> <b>geometry</b> of a spacetime that contains a distribution of matter that moves slowly compared with the speed of light. The expansion involves a series of terms; the first terms represent Newtonian gravity, whereas the later terms represent ever smaller corrections to Newton's theory due to general relativity. An extension of this expansion is the parametrized post-Newtonian (PPN) formalism, which allows quantitative comparisons between the predictions of general relativity and alternative theories.|$|E

5|$|In {{everyday}} life, {{there are}} three familiar dimensions of space: height, width and depth. Einstein's {{general theory of relativity}} treats time as a dimension on par with the three spatial dimensions; in general relativity, space and time are not modeled as separate entities but are instead unified to a four-dimensional spacetime, three spatial dimensions and one time dimension. In this framework, the phenomenon of gravity is viewed as a consequence of <b>the</b> <b>geometry</b> of spacetime.|$|E
