5|$|According {{to three}} 13th-century authors (Matthew Paris, Salimbene di Adam and Bernard of Besse), John became a Franciscan friar before his death. They agree that John's declining health {{contributed to his}} conversion, but Bernard also {{described}} a recurring vision {{of an old man}} urging the emperor to join the Franciscans. Most 13th-century sources suggest that John died between 19 and 23 March 1237, the only Latin emperor <b>to</b> <b>die</b> <b>in</b> Constantinople.|$|E
5|$|As {{soldiers}} {{approached the}} sacristy, {{one of the}} young sons of defender Anthony Wolf stood to pull a blanket over his shoulders. In the dark, Mexican soldiers mistook him for an adult and killed him. Possibly the last Texian <b>to</b> <b>die</b> <b>in</b> battle was Jacob Walker, who attempted to hide behind Susannah Dickinson and was bayoneted in front of the women. Another Texian, Brigido Guerrero, also sought refuge in the sacristy. Guerrero, who had deserted from the Mexican Army in December 1835, was spared after convincing the soldiers he was a Texian prisoner.|$|E
5|$|Betances' {{last days}} were chaotic, {{not only because}} of the events in the Caribbean, but also because of what {{happening}} in his own household. Jiménez' mental state is reported as dubious by then. Some even suggest that she had become an alcoholic (probably) or even a morphine addict (unlikely) by then, and she even wished for her husband <b>to</b> <b>die</b> <b>in</b> tantrums reported by his doctors. Political foes attempted to gain possession of Betances' intelligence dossiers, as did Spanish intelligence agents in Paris. Betances asked personal friends to keep personal guard of him, which they did until he died.|$|E

5|$|Madison {{traveled}} to Blue Lick Springs for his health {{soon after the}} election, but {{was too weak to}} return to Frankfort for the inauguration.

5|$|Madison's {{political}} experience before becoming governor {{consisted of a}} twenty-year tenure as state auditor. Although his military service made him extremely popular in Kentucky, he sought no higher office until the citizens insisted he run for governor in 1816. James Johnson, his only challenger in the race, dropped out early due to Madison's overwhelming popularity, and Madison was elected without opposition. A few weeks later, {{he became the first}} Kentucky governor <b>to</b> <b>die</b> <b>in</b> office. Opponents of his lieutenant governor, Gabriel Slaughter, mounted a popular but unsuccessful challenge to Slaughter's succeeding Madison in office.|$|E
