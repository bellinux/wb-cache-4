5|$|Madsen's {{idea was}} to bring {{attention}} {{to the story of}} Flammen and Citron as he felt it had been neglected or misrepresented. The most expensive Danish film produced to that date, it was co-produced by German companies because initially there was no interest in producing the film in Denmark. Portraying the protagonists as morally ambiguous characters, the director tried to depict war as a complicated experience <b>that</b> <b>goes</b> <b>beyond</b> a good versus evil dichotomy. With visual and narrative references borrowed from film noir and the French film Army of Shadows, Flame & Citron also explores themes of love, betrayal, and the emotional aspects of relationships.|$|E

5|$|Mallanarya of Gubbi, a poet bilingual in Kannada and Sanskrit, {{enjoyed the}} {{patronage}} of King Krishnadeva Raya. His important writings in Kannada in the shatpadi metre are the Bhava Chintaratna (also called Satyendra Chole Kathe, 1513) and the Virasaivamrita Purana (1530). The former {{was based on}} a 7th-century Tamil work and about a Chola King {{in the context of the}} Shaiva faith; the latter is a writing of encyclopedic proportions <b>that</b> <b>goes</b> <b>beyond</b> philosophical content, describing the various forms (or sports, called lila) of god Shiva and the lives of famous Shaiva saints.|$|E
5|$|Women's music (or womyn's {{music or}} wimmin's music) {{is the music}} by women, for women, and about women. The genre emerged as a musical {{expression}} of the second-wave feminist movement {{as well as the}} labour, civil rights, and peace movements. The movement was started by lesbians such as Cris Williamson, Meg Christian, and Margie Adam, African-American women activists such as Bernice Johnson Reagon and her group Sweet Honey in the Rock, and peace activist Holly Near. Women's music also refers to the wider industry of women's music <b>that</b> <b>goes</b> <b>beyond</b> the performing artists to include studio musicians, producers, sound engineers, technicians, cover artists, distributors, promoters, and festival organizers who are also women.|$|E
5|$|In many {{bacterial}} communities, {{natural or}} engineered (such as bioreactors), {{there is significant}} division of labor in metabolism (Syntrophy), during which the waste products of some organisms are metabolites for others. In one such system, the methanogenic bioreactor, functional stability requires the presence of several syntrophic species (Syntrophobacterales and Synergistia) working together in order to turn raw resources into fully metabolized waste (methane). Using comparative gene studies and expression experiments with microarrays or proteomics researchers can piece together a metabolic network <b>that</b> <b>goes</b> <b>beyond</b> species boundaries. Such studies require detailed knowledge about which versions of which proteins are coded by which species and even by which strains of which species. Therefore, community genomic information is another fundamental tool (with metabolomics and proteomics) in the quest to determine how metabolites are transferred and transformed by a community.|$|E

25|$|Otonashi {{is asked}} to join the SSS by its founder and leader Yuri Nakamura. The SSS fight against Kanade Tachibana, also {{referred}} to as Angel, the student council president of the afterlife school whose responsibilities require her to suppress the team's disruptive activities. Although the SSS initially views Kanade as their enemy, Otonashi eventually befriends her and she joins the SSS. Following this, Otonashi begins helping the other SSS members overcome any regrets they had in life so they can move on. In the process, Otonashi grows closer to the other characters as he learns more about them. Although the story contains romantic plot lines between Otonashi and each of the heroines, the pasts and conflicts of the characters are not meant to simply enliven the romantic elements, but also provide a significance <b>that</b> <b>goes</b> <b>beyond</b> romance.|$|E
25|$|The MBA {{dissertation}} (or thesis in some universities) will, in general, {{comprise the}} following in some combination: {{a discussion of}} the literature, providing a critical review and structuring of what is known on a given topic, with a view to addressing a specific problem; a case study <b>that</b> <b>goes</b> <b>beyond</b> simple description, containing the analysis of hitherto unpublished material; a test of the application or limitations of some known principle or technique in a particular situation, and / or suggested modifications. As an alternative to the dissertation, some programs instead allow for a major project. Here (part-time) students will address a problem current in their organization; particularly in programs with an action learning orientation, these may be practically oriented. Most MBA programs require additional course work in research methodology, preceding the dissertation or project. Some programs allow that the research component as a whole may be substituted with additional elective coursework.|$|E

500|$|The use of {{recurring}} characters lends Balzac's work a {{cohesion and}} atmosphere {{unlike any other}} series of novels.

[...] "When the characters reappear", notes the critic Samuel Rogers, [...] "they do not step out of nowhere; they emerge from {{the privacy of their}} own lives which, for an interval, we have not been allowed to see." [...] Although the complexity of these characters' lives inevitably led Balzac to make errors of chronology and consistency, the mistakes are considered minor in the overall scope of the project. Readers are more often troubled by the sheer number of people in Balzac's world, and feel deprived of important context for the characters. Detective novelist Arthur Conan Doyle said that he never tried to read Balzac, because he [...] "did not know where to begin".|$|E
500|$|Balzac's use of {{recurring}} characters {{has been}} identified as a unique component of his fiction. It enables a depth of characterization <b>that</b> <b>goes</b> <b>beyond</b> simple narration or dialogue. [...] "When the characters reappear", notes the critic Samuel Rogers, [...] "they do not step out of nowhere; they emerge from the privacy of their own lives which, for an interval, we have not been allowed to see." [...] Some readers, however, are intimidated by the depth created by these interdependent stories, and feel deprived of important context for the characters. Detective novelist Arthur Conan Doyle said that he never tried to read Balzac, because he [...] "did not know where to begin". The characterization in La Cousine Bette is considered especially skillful. Anthony Pugh, in his book Balzac's Recurring Characters, says that the technique is employed [...] "for the most part without that feeling of self-indulgence that mars some of Balzac's later work. Almost every example arises quite naturally out of the situation." [...] Biographer Noel Gerson calls the characters in La Cousine Bette [...] "among the most memorable Balzac ever sketched".|$|E
