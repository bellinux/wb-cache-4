The plot focuses on the cast overcoming the manipulation they face at an international level and occasionally attempting to reconcile their differences to fight an evil greater than either side ever acknowledged, making way for scenarios in which their allegiances are stressed and put to the test.|$|E

5|$|Libyan {{involvement}} with Chad {{can be said}} to have started in 1968, during the Chadian Civil War, when the insurgent Muslim National Liberation Front of Chad (FROLINAT) extended its guerrilla war against the Christian President François Tombalbaye to the northerly Borkou-Ennedi-Tibesti Prefecture (BET). Libya's king Idris I felt compelled to support the FROLINAT because of long-standing strong links between the <b>two</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> the Chadian-Libyan border. To preserve relations with Chad's former colonial master and current protector, France, Idris limited himself to granting the rebels sanctuary in Libyan territory and to providing only non-lethal supplies.|$|E
5|$|Old Court {{chief justice}} John Boyle {{resigned}} {{to accept a}} federal judgeship.

Old Court justices Mills and Owsley resigned, hoping to clarify the situation further. They were immediately reappointed, but the Senate refused to confirm their appointments. The governor appointed George Robertson and Joseph R. Underwood, who were both confirmed by the Senate.|$|E
5|$|String {{and wind}} {{instruments}} {{play an important}} role in Barbadian folk culture, especially the bow-fiddle, banjo and acoustic guitar; more modern groups also use an electric and bass guitar. The shukster is a distinctive instrument, made by stretching a guitar string between <b>two</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> a house. Traditional Barbadian wind instruments are largely metal, but in their folk origins, were made out of locally found materials. Barbadian villagers burned fingerholes, for example, on bamboo tubes, made trumpets out of conch shells and pipes from pumpkin vines. Many modern groups use harmonica, accordion, alto and tenor saxophone, trumpet and trombone.|$|E

5|$|The flame tree {{does not}} rely on fire but shoots its seeds through the air when the <b>two</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> its long pods crack apart explosively on drying. The {{miniature}} cone-like catkins of alder trees produce seeds that contain small droplets of oil that help disperse the seeds {{on the surface of}} water. Mangroves often grow in water and some species have propagules, which are buoyant fruits with seeds that start germinating before becoming detached from the parent tree. These float on the water and may become lodged on emerging mudbanks and successfully take root.|$|E

5|$|Thick as a Brick is {{the fifth}} studio album by the British rock band Jethro Tull, {{released}} in March 1972. The album contains a continuous piece of music, split over <b>two</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> an LP record, and was deliberately designed to parody the concept album genre. The original packaging, designed like a newspaper, claims the album to be a musical adaptation of an epic poem by the fictional 8-year-old genius Gerald Bostock, though the lyrics were actually written by the band's frontman, Ian Anderson.|$|E
5|$|As {{with many}} Korean rural folk traditions, {{the sport is}} {{regarded}} as a predictor of future events, specifically harvests. The outcome of a ritualised contest between the <b>two</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> a village (East and West) was seen as an indicator of the abundance (or otherwise) of that year's rice crop, which would be harvested in the autumn; as a result, juldarigi and similar folk sports are predominant in the rice-growing areas of the South. This is due to the common association in Southeast Asia between dragons (which the ropes of the juldarigi are thought to resemble) and rain; as a result juldarigi or similar tug-of-war ceremonies have also historically been staged during periods of drought. The connection of the two ropes used (with one rope's smaller loop being placed through the other's larger loop) is reminiscent of sexual intercourse, which also gives rise to the sport's association with fecundity.|$|E
5|$|Cave 2 {{is above}} {{and to the}} east of Cave1 and faces north. It was created in late 6th or early 7th century. It is smaller than Cave 1, {{somewhat}} similar in terms of its floor plan, but it is dedicated primarily to Vishnu. Cave2 is reached by climbing 64 steps from the first cave. The cave entrance is a verandah divided by four square pillars with ends as half pillars, all carved out of the monolithic stone face. The pillars have decorative carvings with frieze of ganas (mythical dwarfs) with various facial expressions. On the <b>two</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> the entrance are standing dvarapalas (guardians) holding flowers, not weapons. Like Cave1, Cave 2 art reflects Hindu theology and arts.|$|E

50|$|A crossed (self-intersecting) {{quadrilateral}} consists <b>of</b> <b>two</b> opposite <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> a non-self-intersecting quadrilateral {{along with}} the two diagonals.

5|$|Nesomys narindaensis {{is known}} from a damaged skull, missing {{part of the}} back, a {{mandible}} (lower jaw) with the first two molars (m1 and m2), and four isolated molars (one first upper molar, M1, one third upper molar, M3, and two m2). It is larger than {{each of the three}} living species, and the known material additionally differs from those in a few details that may not hold in larger samples. Total skull length is 61.3mm, longer than in the largest living species, N.lambertoni (50.3–53.8mm). The width of the palate between the M1 is 8.7mm (7.2–7.9mm in N.lambertoni) and the length of the upper toothrow is 9.04 and 9.16mm on the <b>two</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> the skull (7.2–7.9mm in N.lambertoni).|$|E
5|$|Once US12 intersects {{the eastern}} end of its {{business}} loop, it returns to Michigan Avenue for the remainder of its routing in the state. The roadway is a boulevard in this area, a street divided by a central median. It runs through Canton Township and parallel to the Lower River Rouge. US12 intersects I-275 on {{the eastern side of the}} township before crossing into Wayne. The highway is bounded by a mix of industrial and commercial properties in suburban Metro Detroit. In downtown Wayne, the <b>two</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> Michigan Avenue split apart, surrounding the central business district of the city and separated by two to three city blocks. East of this split, Michigan Avenue crosses a section of Westland before entering Inkster.|$|E
5|$|Small Heath Alliance Football Club, {{founded in}} 1875, played their first home games on waste ground off Arthur Street, in the Bordesley Green {{district}} of Birmingham, {{very near the}} site where the club's St Andrew's stadium would be built some thirty years later. In 1876, they made a temporary move to a fenced-off field in Ladypool Road, Sparkbrook, with a capacity estimated at 3,000; because the field was enclosed, admission could be charged. A year later they moved again, to a field in Small Heath, rented for an initial £5 a year from the family of Sam Gessey, a Small Heath player. The field had a capacity of 10,000 spectators, and was situated on the eastern edge of Birmingham's built-up area, just north of the main road to Coventry. It was bordered on two sides by developed streets, Muntz Street on the western side, Wright Street to the south; the other <b>two</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> the enclosure adjoined farmland.|$|E
