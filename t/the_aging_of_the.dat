5|$|Meyer added {{elements}} to reinforce <b>the</b> <b>aging</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> characters. Kirk's unhappiness about his birthday {{is compounded by}} McCoy's gift of reading glasses. The script stated that Kirk was 49, but Shatner was unsure about being specific about Kirk's age. Bennett remembers that Shatner was hesitant about portraying a middle-aged version of himself, and believed that with proper makeup he could continue playing a younger Kirk. Bennett convinced Shatner that he could age gracefully like Spencer Tracy; the producer {{did not know that}} Shatner had worked with Tracy on Judgment at Nuremberg (1961), and was fond of the actor. Meyer made sure to emphasize Kirk's parallel to Sherlock Holmes in that both characters waste away in the absence of their stimuli; new cases, in Holmes' case, and starship adventures in Kirk's.|$|E
5|$|Since then, {{the hospice}} {{industry}} has rapidly expanded. This growth has accompanied the AIDS epidemic and <b>the</b> <b>aging</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> population, with related illnesses. By 1995, hospices were a $2.8 billion industry, with $1.9 billion from Medicare alone funding patients in 1,857 hospice programs with Medicare certification. In that year, 72% of hospice providers were non-profit. By 1998, there were 3,200 hospices either in operation or under development throughout the United States and Puerto Rico, {{according to the}} National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization (NHPCO). According to 2007's Last Rights: Rescuing the End of Life from the Medical System, hospice sites are expanding at a national rate of about 3.5% per year. In 2007, 1.4 {{million people in the}} United States used hospice, with more than one-third of dying Americans using the service, approximately 39%. In 2008, Medicare alone, which pays for 80% of hospice treatment, paid $10 billion to the 4,000 Medicare-certified providers in the United States.|$|E

2500|$|A {{comparative}} biology {{study of}} mammalian telomeres indicated that telomere length of some mammalian species correlates inversely, rather than directly, with lifespan, {{and concluded that}} the contribution of telomere length to lifespan is unresolved. [...] Telomere shortening does not occur with age in some postmitotic tissues, such as in the rat brain. In humans, skeletal muscle telomere lengths remain stable from ages 23 –74. In baboon skeletal muscle, which consists of fully differentiated post-mitotic cells, less than 3% of myonuclei contain damaged telomeres and this percentage does not increase with age. Thus, telomere shortening {{does not appear to be}} a major factor in <b>the</b> <b>aging</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> differentiated cells of brain or skeletal muscle.

A similar guarnello was painted by Sandro Botticelli in his Portrait of Smeralda Brandini (c.1470/1475), depicting a pregnant woman on display in the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. Furthermore, this reflectography revealed that Mona Lisas hair is not loosely hanging down, but seems attached {{at the back of the}} head to a bonnet or pinned back into a chignon and covered with a veil, bordered with a sombre rolled hem.

2500|$|In his Problem of the Missale Speciale, Stevenson {{analyzed}} the four then known {{copies of the}} missal, along with a fifth shorter version.

Stevenson identified several states of these watermarks in the book, reflecting <b>the</b> <b>aging</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> watermark as stress was repeatedly applied to the screen in making the paper. He identified the same watermarks in other books which included their dates of printing or were otherwise firmly datable.
