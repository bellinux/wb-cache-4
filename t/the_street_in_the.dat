5|$|When mysterious shadow monsters begin {{attacking the}} SSS, Takamatsu gets devoured by one, only to {{reappear}} as an NPC. Otonashi reasons {{with the other}} SSS members {{and many of them}} agree to pass on in lieu of becoming an NPC, including the rest of Girls Dead Monster, Chaa of the Guild, and several unnamed members. Yuri destroys the computers responsible for the shadow program, which was programmed to activate when love was detected in the world, to prevent it from becoming a true paradise and maintain its limbo state. Those who are left—Otonashi, Yuri, Kanade, Hinata and Naoi—hold a graduation ceremony where they thank each other for their support. After Naoi, Yuri and Hinata pass on, Otonashi learns that Kanade's regret was not being able to thank him for the heart she received from Otonashi after his death. Otonashi is heartbroken after she thanks him and passes on, as he has fallen in love with her. In the epilogue, two people resembling Otonashi and Kanade meet each other on <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> real world. In an alternative epilogue, Otonashi is shown to have stayed behind in the afterlife to help people pass on.|$|E

Jalil, her father, is a wealthy businessman who owns a cinema and lives in the town with three wives and nine children. Mariam is his illegitimate daughter, and she is prohibited to live with them, but Jalil visits her every Thursday. On her fifteenth birthday, Mariam wants her father to take her to see Pinocchio at his movie theater, against the pleas of her mother. When he does not show up, she hikes into town and goes to his house. He refuses to see her, and she ends up sleeping on <b>the</b> <b>street.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> morning, Mariam returns home to find that her mother has committed suicide out of fear that her daughter had deserted her. Mariam is then taken to live in her father's house. Jalil arranges for her to be married to Rasheed, a shoemaker from Kabul who is thirty-years her senior. In Kabul, Mariam becomes pregnant seven successive times, but is never able to carry a child to term. This is a sad, disquieting reality for both Rasheed and Mariam. Ultimately Rasheed grows more and more despondent over his wife's inability to have a child and particularly a son. As their marriage wears on Rasheed gradually becomes more and more abusive.|$|E

500|$|The {{street was}} {{originally}} residential, but became used {{for commercial purposes}} in the 19th century. At first, metalwork was a popular trade but it became most famous as Britain's [...] "Tin Pan Alley" [...] housing numerous music publishers' offices. This market declined in the 1960s {{to be replaced by}} music shops and independent recording studios. The Rolling Stones recorded at Regent Sound Studio at No. 4 and popular musicians, including David Bowie and the Small Faces, often socialised in the Gioconda café at No. 9. Elton John and Bernie Taupin wrote songs at offices on <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1960s, while the Sex Pistols lived above No. 6, and recorded their first demos there. The comic book store Forbidden Planet and the Helter Skelter music bookshop have also been based on <b>the</b> <b>street.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> 2010s, the surrounding area was redeveloped.
