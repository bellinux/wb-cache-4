5|$|The Modern Benoni {{is one of}} Black's sharpest {{and most}} active defences against 1.d4. The {{exchange}} of White's c-pawn for Black's e-pawn leaves White with a pawn majority in the centre and Black with one on the queenside. This asymmetry suggests that White will <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> on the kingside and in the centre, while Black will seek counterplay on the queenside. However, this simplistic generalization does not hold in many cases—depending on how the pieces are arranged, either side {{may be able to}} fight back on the flank where they are theoretically weaker.|$|E

Until his death in 1918, Hambitzer remained Gershwin's musical mentor and taught him conventional piano technique, introduced him to music of the European classical tradition, and encouraged him to attend orchestral concerts. Following such concerts, young Gershwin would essentially <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>play,</b> on the piano at home, the music he had heard from recall, and without sheet music.|$|E

25|$|The game {{is usually}} self-refereed, {{relying on the}} players to call their own infractions and to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> within {{the rules of the}} game. It is assumed that players will not {{intentionally}} violate the rules and will be honest when discussing foul calls with opponents. This is called Spirit of the Game. After a call is made, the players should decide on an outcome, based on what they think happened and how the rules apply to that situation. If a player has been fouled on a catch, they will often gain possession of the disc. If the players cannot agree on a catching foul, the disc can be given back to the thrower, with play restarting as if before the disputed throw.|$|E

He added, [...] "But she doesn't always play a baritone sax because the animators don't know what it looks like, so it changes shape and color from show to show." [...] One of the hallmarks of the show's opening sequence is a brief solo Lisa plays on her saxophone after being thrown out of music class.

[...] Tristano criticized the free jazz {{that began in the}} 1960s for its lack of musical logic as well as its expression of negative emotions. [...] "If you feel angry with somebody you hit him on the nose – not <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> angry music", he commented; [...] "Express all that is positive. Beauty is a positive thing."

While the symptoms eventually did subside somewhat, the same doctors advised Kariya that it was too risky to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> again, and Kariya officially announced his retirement from hockey on June 29, 2011, through the NHLPA.

On the second day, while practicing a march, two flag twirlers are killed when they spin the flags too fast (because Squidward scolded them to spin the flags faster), causing them to fly {{into the air and}} crash into a blimp. On day three, Plankton plays his harmonica, but becomes exhausted and collapses from running back and forth, since the harmonica is bigger than he is. On the last day of practice, Squidward says if everyone plays loud, they will be good. However, they play poorly, and Squidward changes the plan of playing loud to quiet.

[...] The full-album idea took fruition with the late September-early October set of five shows at Giants Stadium, which would be the final concerts ever in that venue in Springsteen's home state. [...] Born to Run was played at two shows, Darkness on the Edge of Town at one show, and Born in the U.S.A. at two shows.

There were some people who were starting to do it, it sounded like a good idea, and my audience fundamentally experienced all my music in album form. People took Born to Run home and played it start to finish 100 times; they didn't slip on a cut in the middle. And we made albums – we took a long time, and we built them to last. ... Those records are packed with songs that have lasted 30–35 years. It simply was a way to revitalize the show and do something appealing and fun for the fans, but it ended up being a much bigger emotional experience than I thought it would be." ...|$|E
500|$|Crisis Core has {{received}} generally positive reviews. At Metacritic {{the score is}} that of 83 out of 100.

GameSpot awarded it an [...] "Editor's Choice" [...] label, praising its storyline, the combat system and its presentation, and also stating that [...] "Crisis Core is an exciting and poignant journey that every fan of role-playing games should take."

[...] VideoGamer.com gave an overall score of 9, finding its fighting system [...] "addictive", and arguing that its CGI scenes had a similar quality to the ones from Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children. Similarly, GamePro gave it a positive review, calling it the [...] "best looking PSP title," [...] and praising how it incorporated elements from the Compilation, {{and at the same time}} created new aspects.

2500|$|ZombiU was {{designed}} as a realistic zombie game. Fear was the game's core emotion and it should be played slowly, similar to some classic horror games. According to game director Jean-Phillipe Caro, players will do badly if they <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> it as a fast-paced action shooter like Call of Duty and ignore the GamePad. A prominent game mechanic is the permadeath system, intended to increase its tension. With the system, the game featured several survivors instead of a hero character. Its narrative {{was designed}} to rely on environmental storytelling rather than cutscenes, and players would understand the story through the game experience. The team introduced a persistent level design, in which when players continue playing after their initial survivor is killed. Action by the previous survivor will still affect the game's world; previously-killed zombies will not re-spawn. The permadeath system was debated, with concerns about loading times and backtracking. To ensure that the game's narrative would continue after a player-controlled character died, the survivors were not voiced to avoid narrative dissonance; this made the player, not the survivors, the protagonist. Although Shrager was relieved when the central character was dropped, writing the game was the [...] "toughest challenge" [...] she had ever faced in games. Since survivors can die anywhere in the game, linking the story became difficult. The team introduced the Prepper, an important character who communicates with the survivors by radio to link them and advance the narrative. During development, the permadeath concept was nearly removed.|$|E
2500|$|With Chappell again available, Hughes {{returned}} to the vice-captaincy for the 1981–82 Tests. Australia played Pakistan first in an ill-tempered three Test series; won by the Australians two Tests to one. Hughes started the series with a century (106) in the first Test in Perth and finished the series having scored 193 runs overall. The other touring side that summer were the West Indies, widely considered {{the best team in}} the world at that time and supported by a potent fast bowling attack. The first Test in the series was played at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. Both teams were critical of the pitch prepared at the MCG for the Test. [...] Australia were quickly reduced to 26/4 before Hughes started his effort to recover the Australian innings. Hughes decided to attack the West Indian bowling. In an interview later he said [...] "that to hang around and defend was going to be a waste of time...So I thought what I could do was <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> as many shots as possible." [...] When the ninth wicket fell, Hughes had made 71 and it appeared a century was out of reach. Hughes' remaining batting partner, Alderman, was a poor batsman; it had taken him nine matches to make his first first-class run. Alderman, despite telling Hughes that he didn't give himself much chance, managed to stay with Hughes long enough for Hughes to reach 100 runs. Hughes' innings was widely praised. West Indian Andy Roberts said [...] "He took up the challenge and it paid off for him. It was a great innings. You don't find one batsman playing that sort of innings on more than one occasion. That was just his day." [...] The Wisden 100, a ranking of the Top 100 Test Innings of all time, ranked that innings as number nine.|$|E
