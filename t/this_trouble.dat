25|$|The Fender Jazz bass guitar {{started out}} {{life as a}} {{standard}} 4-string bass, but in 1976, after being inspired by Jaco Pastorius' fretless playing, he commissioned a symphony bass repairman {{by the name of}} Neville Whitehead to replace the standard neck with a fretless version. The replacement neck was a planed-down real ebony neck removed from a 100-year-old upright bass. For six months Foster struggled with the pure black neck as there were no indicators for finger positioning. Eventually giving up the fight, he employed luthier Dick Knight to mark fretlines on the neck. After going to <b>this</b> <b>trouble</b> he was surprised to learn that Pastorius achieved the same thing by merely pulling off the frets and filling the resulting holes with epoxy resin. Since the early 80s the bass guitar has undergone several component replacements including the bridge and the pick-ups.|$|E
25|$|Next to the Indians, the Arkansans {{were most}} fearful of their Mexican neighbors in Texas. Much of <b>this</b> <b>trouble</b> {{was caused by}} an {{ill-defined}} boundary between Arkansas and Texas. The International Boundary between the Arkansas Territory of the United States and the Mexican state of Coahuila and Texas had been defined in the treaty of 1819 between the United States and Spain, but remained unsurveyed in 1827. Because {{the location of the}} border was uncertain, the ownership of a considerable area southwest of Red River was in question. Arkansas Territory had, since 1820, exercised jurisdiction over the settlements immediately south of the river, holding them {{to be a part of}} Miller County. In 1827 the easternmost portion of the disputed area, approximating the present corner of Arkansas southwest of the river, was assigned by the territorial legislature to the new county of Lafayette. In 1828 Miller County north of the river was abolished and a new Miller County constituted south of the river in what is now northeastern Texas. Miller County, as defined by the Arkansas territorial legislature in 1831, comprised all the present northeastern Texas counties of Bowie, Red River, Lamar, Fannin, and Delta plus parts of eight counties south and west of these.|$|E

500|$|An {{agreement}} {{signed by}} Disney and Stokowski on December 16, 1937, allowed the conductor to [...] "select and employ a complete symphony orchestra" [...] for the recording. Disney hired a {{stage at the}} Culver Studios in California for the session. It began at midnight on January 9, 1938, and lasted for three hours using eighty-five Hollywood musicians. As production costs of The Sorcerer's Apprentice climbed to $125,000, it became clearer to Disney and his brother Roy, who managed the studio's finances, that the short could never earn such a sum back on its own. Roy wanted his brother to keep any additional costs on the film to a minimum. He said, [...] "because of its very experimental and unprecedented nature... {{we have no idea}} what can be expected from such a production." [...] Ben Sharpsteen, a production supervisor on Fantasia, noted that its budget was three to four times greater than the usual Silly Symphony, but Disney [...] "saw <b>this</b> <b>trouble</b> in the form of an opportunity.

2500|$|One of the Rangers' highest-profile {{interventions}} {{during this}} period was taming Texas's oil boomtowns (beginning with Spindletop's discovery in 1901), which had developed into lawless territories. During the 1920s, martial law was decreed on several of these towns, such as Mexia and Borger; at others, like Desdemona, Wink, Ranger, Kilgore and Burkburnett, the situation was also very serious, and the Rangers were called in to quell agitated locals and terminate all illegal activities. <b>This</b> <b>trouble</b> continued until well in the 1950s, but the Rangers prevented it from growing into an even more dramatic problem.

2500|$|Religion is a {{fundamental}} fact of life to Henry, who is presented as truly pious. Shakespeare may have taken this aspect of Henry's character from Edward Hall's description of him: [...] "He did abhor of his own nature, all the vices, as well of the body as of the soul; and from his very infancy he was of honest conversation and pure integrity; no knower of evil, and a keeper of all goodness; a despiser of all things which were wont to cause the minds of mortal men to slide or appair. Besides this, patience was so radicate in his heart {{that of all the}} injuries to him committed (which were no small number) he never asked vengeance nor punishment, but for that rendered to Almighty God, his Creator, hearty thanks, thinking that by <b>this</b> <b>trouble</b> and adversity his sins were to him forgotten and forgiven." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{accompanying}} plot shows {{these two}} solutions as surfaces {{in a space}} with horizontal axes of (sample excess kurtosis) and (sample squared skewness) and the shape parameters as the vertical axis. The surfaces are constrained by the condition that the sample excess kurtosis must be bounded by the sample squared skewness as stipulated in the above equation. [...] The two surfaces meet at the right edge defined by zero skewness. Along this right edge, both parameters are equal and the distribution is symmetric U-shaped for α = β < 1, uniform for α = β = 1, upside-down-U-shaped for 1 < α = β < 2 and bell-shaped for α = β > 2. [...] The surfaces also meet at the front (lower) edge defined by [...] "the impossible boundary" [...] line (excess kurtosis + 2 - skewness2 = 0). Along this front (lower) boundary both shape parameters approach zero, and the probability density is concentrated more at one end than the other end (with practically nothing in between), with probabilities [...] at the left end x = 0 and [...] at the right end x = 1. [...] The two surfaces become further apart towards the rear edge. [...] At this rear edge the surface parameters are quite different from each other. [...] As remarked, for example, by Bowman and Shenton, sampling {{in the neighborhood of}} the line (sample excess kurtosis - (3/2)(sample skewness)2 = 0) (the just-J-shaped portion of the rear edge where blue meets beige), [...] "is dangerously near to chaos", because at that line the denominator of the expression above for the estimate ν = α + β becomes zero and hence ν approaches infinity as that line is approached. [...] Bowman and Shenton [...] write that [...] "the higher moment parameters (kurtosis and skewness) are extremely fragile (near that line). However the mean and standard deviation are fairly reliable." [...] Therefore, the problem is for the case of four parameter estimation for very skewed distributions such that the excess kurtosis approaches (3/2) times the square of the skewness. [...] This boundary line is produced by extremely skewed distributions with very large values of one of the parameters and very small values of the other parameter. [...] See section titled [...] "Kurtosis bounded by the square of the skewness" [...] for a numerical example and further comments about this rear edge boundary line (sample excess kurtosis - (3/2)(sample skewness)2 = 0). [...] As remarked by Karl Pearson himself [...] this issue may not be of much practical importance as <b>this</b> <b>trouble</b> arises only for very skewed J-shaped (or mirror-image J-shaped) distributions with very different values of shape parameters that are unlikely to occur much in practice). [...] The usual skewed skewed-bell-shape distributions that occur in practice do not have this parameter estimation problem.|$|E
