Materials and Methods: Sixty American Society of Anesthesiologist Physical Status Classification I-II patients scheduled for total abdominal hysterectomy were enrolled to this double-blinded, randomized, placebo controlled, and prospective study. Patients were divided into three groups as paracetamol, dexketoprofen <b>trometamol,</b> and placebo (0. 9 % NaCl) due to their post-operative analgesic usage. Intravenous patient controlled analgesia morphine {{was used as a}} rescue analgesic in all groups. Pain scores, hemodynamic parameters, morphine consumption, patient satisfaction, and side-effects were evaluated. Results: Visual Analog Scale (VAS) scores were not statistically significantly different among the groups in all evaluation times, but decrease in VAS scores was statistically significant after the evaluation at 12 th h in all groups. Total morphine consumption (morphine concentration = 0. 2 mg/ml) in group paracetamol (72. 3 ± 38. 0 ml) and dexketoprofen <b>trometamol</b> (69. 3 ± 24. 1 ml) was significantly lower than group placebo (129. 3 ± 22. 6 ml) (P < 0. 001).

Today, the product most commonly applied for topical anesthesia in Germany is EMLA® (lidocaine/prilocaine). However, since prilocaine is a methemoglobin-inducing agent, there are limitations to its use, especially in neonates and infants. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the effect of prilocaine and lidocaine as well as propylene glycol, a penetration enhancer, and <b>trometamol,</b> a buffer substance, in anesthetic creams. Patients and methods: Twenty-nine healthy adults participated in this study. Standardized creams with eight different compositions were applied and left for 20, 40 or 60  min. After exposure to standardized painful stimuli (blunt/sharp with pressures of 0. 2, 0. 4 or 0. 8  N), subjects rated the experimental pain using a visual analog scale. Results: Significant results were only found with an exposure time of 60  min and a stamp pressure of 0. 8  N. At a concentration of 20 %, lidocaine was more effective compared to placebo and equally effective compared to lidocaine/prilocaine in controlling pain. The analgesic effect of the cream containing lidocaine 10 % and additional <b>trometamol</b> was significantly superior to that of placebo and non-inferior to that of lidocaine/prilocaine. In this study, the penetration enhancer propylene glycol did not accelerate the onset of the analgesic effect. In contrast, the addition of <b>trometamol</b> (Tris/THAM) accelerated the onset of the effect compared to the native formulation (at 0. 4 and 0. 8  N). In all of the adult subjects of this study, the minimum exposure time was 60  min for any of the tested topical anesthetic creams.

MethodsWe conducted this randomized controlled clinical study on 61 patients. The study was conducted in the operation room, post-anesthesia care unit, and inpatient clinic. We randomly grouped the 61 patients into control group (group C), block group (group B) and dexketoprofen-block group (group DB). Before the skin incision performed after anesthesia induction, we performed ilioinguinal iliohypogastric block (group C given saline and group P and DB given levobupivacaine). In contrast to group C and B, group DB was given dexketoprofen. We administered morphine analgesia to all patients by patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) during the postoperative 24 hours. We recorded Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), satisfaction scores, morphine consumption and side effects during postoperative 24 hours. ResultsWe found the DB group's VAS scores to be lower than the control group and block group's (p < 0. 05) values at postoperative 1 st, 2 nd, 6 th and 12 th hours. VAS scores of group C were higher than of group B at postoperative ﬁrst 2 hours.

When alkali is removed from the milk there is a decrease in the weight of an infant and the stools contain excessive numbers of E. coli bacteria...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To compare {{fosfomycin}} <b>trometamol</b> (FT) and ciprofloxacin (CIP) for {{antibiotic prophylaxis}} in transrectal prostate biopsy (TR-PB). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data for 1109 patients (mean age 66. 7 ± 8. 45) who underwent TR-PB between March to September 2015 in seven Italian urological institutions were retrospectively reviewed, of which 632 received FT (Group 1) and 477 received CIP (Group 2) for prophylaxis. We reviewed all urine culture results obtained after the procedure, all adverse drug reactions (ADRs) {{related to the}} drug and all febrile and/or symptomatic urinary tract infections (UTIs) occurring within 1 month after TR-PB. The rate of symptomatic UTIs {{and the rate of}} ADRs were considered the main outcome measures. RESULTS: In the total study population, 72 / 1109 (6. 5...|$|E
30|$|Considering {{the serious}} {{complications}} caused by headaches postoperatively, {{it is important}} to select an effective analgesic to alleviate postoperative pain. No ideal analgesic has been described for use in patients undergoing craniotomy. Despite the lack of clinical evidence related to craniotomy, nonopioid analgesics such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and opioids are widely used to relieve postoperative pain (Gottschalk and Yaster 2009; Molnar et al. 2014). Opioid analgesics are the main intervention for pain control in patients. Moore et al. (2015) reported that dexketoprofen <b>trometamol</b> 25  mg combined with tramadol hydrochloride 75  mg had favorable analgesic effect on moderate to severe pain. Morphine {{has been found to be}} the most effective analgesic among these agents, it is the gold standard of moderate and severe pain management (Gottschalk and Yaster 2009).|$|E
30|$|Postoperative {{pain was}} {{assessed}} using the visual analogue pain scale (VAS) (scoring from 0 [*]=[*]no pain, to 10 [*]=[*]worst imaginable pain). The VAS score was evaluated immediately after surgery in the recovery and at 6, 24, and 48  h postoperatively. All patients received the same intraoperative analgesia: intravenous paracetamol (1000  mg) and ketorolac <b>trometamol</b> (20  mg). Postoperative pain was managed by tramadol hydrochloride 300  mg and alizapride hydrochloride 100  mg, administered intravenously over the first 24  h, together with intramuscular diclofenac 2 [*]×[*] 75  mg the first day. Over the next 24  h, intravenous tramadol 200  mg and alizapride hydrochloride 100  mg was infused. As long as there was no oral diet intake, intravenous paracetamol 4 [*]×[*] 1000  mg was associated. When the patient started diet intake, oral analgesics (paracetamol 1000  mg) were administered on patient’s demand.|$|E
40|$|Objectives: Acute {{urinary tract}} {{infection}} (UTI) {{is one of the}} most common infections requiring empirical antibiotic therapy. Selection of efficient and safe antimicrobial agent is important in the emergency department (ED). The aim of this study is to compare the microbiological and clinical efficiency of single-dose fosfomycin <b>trometamol</b> (FT) therapy with a 3 -day course of ciprofloxacin (CP) for the treatment of uncomplicated UTI. Methods: This randomized, prospective, single-blind study evaluated women aged between 18 and 65 years and complaining of dysuria, frequency and urgency in the ED. The onset of symptoms were less than 72 hours before admission to the ED. Patients received either a single-dose FT or 3 -day course of CP. Those with positive cultures of mid-stream urine samples constituted study patients. Microbiological and clinical cure were assessed at the test-of-cure visit (7 - 10 days after completion of therapy). Chi-square tests were used to compare efficiencies of regimens. Results: Mean age of 81 women included the study was 30 ± 12. There were 40 patients in the FT group and 41 patients in the CP group. The most common uropathogen isolated was E. Coli in 50 subjects (61. 3 %). Clinical cure was demonstrated in 38 patients (96 %) in the FT group and 38 patients (93 %) in the CP group (χ²: 0, 347, df: 1, p= 0. 275). Bacteriologic eradication was achieved in 30 patients (80 %) in the FT treated group and 27 patients (65. 8 %) in the CP treated group (χ²: 0, 1591, df: 1, p= 0. 207). 3 patients (7. 5 %) in the FT and 4 patients (10 %) in the CP group experienced pyrosis, while nausea was seen in 5 patients (12 %) in the CP group as adverse events. Conclusions: Fosfomycin <b>trometamol</b> therapy was found to be as safe and effective as ciprofloxacin as a first line treatment of acute uncomplicated UTI...|$|E
40|$|Fosfomycin {{is an old}} {{antibiotic}} with {{a unique}} chemical structure and with broadspectrum activity against numerous bacterial pathogens, both Gram-positive and Gramnegative, including resistant and multi-resistant strains. This antibiotic was accepted into clinical practice in the early 1970 s. Its use, however, has been limited for several years for treating mainly lower uncomplicated urinary tract infections (in the form of fosfomycin <b>trometamol</b> taken orally). Nowadays, many clinicians and scientists are looking at this antibacterial drug for its employment {{in the treatment of}} severe infections caused by multi-resistant bacteria. Fosfomycin as an intravenous formulation (fosfomycin disodium) achieves clinically relevant concentrations in the serum and the cerebrospinal fluid, in kidney, bladder wall, prostate, lungs, bone and heart valves tissues, as well as in inflamed tissues and abscess fluid. The available clinical studies confirmed the efficacy of intravenous fosfomycin for the management of severe infections caused by multiresistant pathogens...|$|E
30|$|Antibiotics are {{frequently}} prescribed {{for the treatment}} of UTIs in pregnant women. Because of altered drug pharmacokinetics during pregnancy and the possibility of drug transfer across the placental barrier, the use of antibiotics during pregnancy should be approached with caution [7, 8]. Due to their potential teratogenic effects, certain antibiotics are unsuitable for use in pregnant women [9]. Antimicrobial agents considered safe in pregnancy are of the β lactam class including the penicillins, cephalosporins and fosfomycin <b>trometamol</b> [6, 10]. Nevertheless, the use of antibiotics in general is associated with adverse events, including allergic reactions, gastrointestinal side-effects, and cardiac arrhythmia [11, 12], and these should be administered with utmost caution during pregnancy. In addition, the number of antimicrobial agents safe for use during pregnancy is further limited by the emergence of drug resistance amongst various bacterial species [6, 13]. Thus, {{there is a need for}} alternative treatment modalities for addressing UTIs that occur during pregnancy.|$|E
