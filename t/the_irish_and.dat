5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Irish</b> <b>and</b> British {{authorities}} co-operated in the chartering of ships. They made combined {{purchases of}} wheat, maize, sugar, animal feeds and petrol.

So they chose to sail alone.|$|E
5|$|The Second Boer War catalysed {{a renewed}} {{interest}} in establishing a unit composed of Scottish Liverpudlians. On 30 April 1900, the 8th (Scottish) Volunteer Battalion was formed within the King's (Liverpool Regiment), with headquarters later being located at 22 Highgate Street, Edge Hill. The Liverpool Scottish became one of four battalions in English infantry regiments to explicitly associate with <b>the</b> <b>Irish</b> <b>and</b> Scottish communities - the other battalions were the London Scottish, Liverpool Irish and London Irish Rifles.|$|E

5|$|Henry {{took this}} {{opportunity}} to intervene personally in Ireland. He took a large army into south Wales, forcing the rebels who had held the area since 1165 into submission prior to sailing from Pembroke and landing in Ireland in October 1171. Some of the Irish lords appealed to Henry {{to protect them from}} the Anglo-Norman invaders, while de Clare offered to submit to Henry if he was allowed to retain his new possessions. Henry's timing was influenced by several factors, including encouragement from Pope Alexander, who saw the opportunity to establish papal authority over the Irish church. The critical factor though appears to have been Henry's concern that his nobles in the Welsh Marches would acquire independent territories of their own in Ireland, beyond the reach of his authority. Henry's intervention was successful, and both <b>the</b> <b>Irish</b> <b>and</b> Anglo-Normans in the south and east of Ireland accepted his rule.|$|E
5|$|Henry {{undertook}} {{a wave of}} castle-building during his visit in 1171 to protect his new territories—the Anglo-Normans had superior military technologies to <b>the</b> <b>Irish,</b> <b>and</b> castles gave them a significant advantage. Henry hoped for a longer term political solution, however, similar to his approach in Wales and Scotland, and in 1175 he agreed to the Treaty of Windsor, under which Rory O'Connor would be recognised as the high king of Ireland, giving homage to Henry and maintaining stability on the ground on his behalf. This policy proved unsuccessful, as O'Connor was unable to exert sufficient influence and force {{in areas such as}} Munster: Henry instead intervened more directly, establishing a system of local fiefs of his own through a conference held in Oxford in 1177.|$|E

5|$|In 1185 John {{made his}} first visit to Ireland, {{accompanied}} by 300 knights and a team of administrators. Henry had tried to have John officially proclaimed King of Ireland, but Pope Lucius III would not agree. John's first period of rule in Ireland was not a success. Ireland had only recently been conquered by Anglo-Norman forces, and tensions were still rife between Henry II, the new settlers and the existing inhabitants. John infamously offended the local Irish rulers by making fun of their unfashionable long beards, failed to make allies amongst the Anglo-Norman settlers, began to lose ground militarily against <b>the</b> <b>Irish</b> <b>and</b> finally returned to England later in the year, blaming the viceroy, Hugh de Lacy, for the fiasco.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, John {{undertook}} {{an expedition}} to Ireland in 1185, which was not a success.

In 1186 Henry was about to return John to Ireland once again, when news came that Geoffrey {{had died in a}} tournament at Paris, leaving two young children; this event once again changed the balance of power between Henry and his remaining sons.|$|E
5|$|The American Water Spaniel, (often {{abbreviated}} to AWS), is a breed of spaniel which {{originated in the}} United States.

With the organisation under intense pressure, which included McKevitt and Sands-McKevitt being forced from their home after the media named McKevitt in connection with the bombing, the RIRA called a ceasefire on 8 September.|$|E

5|$|As late as 1795, the {{population}} of Massachusetts was nearly 95% of English ancestry. During the early and mid 19th century, immigrant groups began arriving in Massachusetts in large numbers; first from Ireland in the 1840s; today <b>the</b> <b>Irish</b> <b>and</b> part-Irish are the largest ancestry group in the state at nearly 25% of the total population. Others arrived later from Quebec as well as places in Europe such as Italy, Portugal, and Poland. In the early 20th century, a number of African Americans migrated to Massachusetts, although in somewhat fewer numbers than many other Northern states. Later in the 20th century, immigration from Latin America increased considerably. Over 156,000 Chinese Americans made their home in Massachusetts in 2014, and Boston hosts a growing Chinatown accommodating heavily traveled Chinese-owned bus lines to and from Chinatown, Manhattan in New York City. Massachusetts also has large Puerto Rican, Dominican, Haitian, Cape Verdean and Brazilian populations. Boston's South End and Jamaica Plain are both gay villages, as is nearby Provincetown, Massachusetts on Cape Cod.|$|E

5|$|Wales {{has three}} {{national}} parks: Snowdonia, Brecon Beacons and Pembrokeshire Coast. It has five Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty; Anglesey, the Clwydian Range and Dee Valley, the Gower Peninsula, the Llŷn Peninsula, and the Wye Valley. The Gower Peninsula {{was the first}} area in the United Kingdom to be designated as an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, in 1956. Forty {{two percent of the}} coastline of south and west Wales is designated as Heritage Coast, with 13 specific designated strips of coastline maintained by Natural Resources Wales (successor body to the Countryside Council for Wales). As from 2012 the coastline of Wales has 43 Blue Flag beaches and five Blue Flag marinas. Despite its heritage and award winning beaches; the south and west coasts of Wales, along with <b>the</b> <b>Irish</b> <b>and</b> Cornish coasts, are frequently blasted by Atlantic westerlies/south westerlies that, over the years, have sunk and wrecked many vessels. On the night of 25 October 1859, over 110 ships were destroyed off the coast of Wales when a hurricane blew in from the Atlantic. More than 800 lives were lost across Britain because of the storm, but the greatest tragedy was the sinking of the Royal Charter off the coast of Anglesey in which 459 people died. The number of shipwrecks around the coast of Wales reached a peak in the 19th century with over 100 vessels lost and an average loss of life of about 78 sailors per year. Wartime action caused losses near Holyhead, Milford Haven and Swansea. Because of offshore rocks and unlit islands, Anglesey and Pembrokeshire are still notorious for shipwrecks, most notably the Sea Empress oil spill in 1996.|$|E
5|$|With {{their victory}} over Georgia in the SEC Championship Game, Alabama {{qualified}} for the 2013 BCS National Championship Game, and against Notre Dame the Crimson Tide captured their third BCS Championship in four years with a 42–14 victory over the Fighting Irish. After Notre Dame won the coin toss and elected to defer until the second half, Alabama took their opening possession 82 yards in five plays and Eddie Lacy gave the Crimson Tide an early 7–0 lead with his 20-yard touchdown run. On the first Irish possession that followed, the Crimson Tide held them to a three-and-out and forced a punt. The kick was subsequently fumbled by Christion Jones and recovered by Notre Dame; however, a kick catching interference penalty was called against <b>the</b> <b>Irish</b> <b>and</b> gave back possession to Alabama. On the drive that ensued, the Crimson Tide took a 14–0 lead when AJ McCarron threw a three-yard touchdown pass to Michael Williams that capped a 10-play, 61-yard drive. After the Alabama defense forced their second punt of the game, the Crimson Tide responded with their third touchdown of the game.|$|E
