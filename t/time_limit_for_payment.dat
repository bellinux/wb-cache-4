5000|$|The <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> <b>for</b> the <b>payment</b> {{of the tax}} {{according}} to Lorentz's calculations was November 23; so on the 24th the latter called the council together again and had an itemized bill prepared for 20,000 rdl. 46½ styvers. This bill together with a letter {{was taken by the}} two professedly loyal councilors to Laporte on November 25. Two days later the director-general came before the council to read his reply in which he stated his reasons <b>for</b> refusing <b>payment.</b> The main argument advanced was that he had no orders from his chiefs to make any such payment. After Laporte's departure the council decided, in view of the expected arrival on any day of three Brandenburg ships, to institute judicial condemnatory proceedings after three days' elapse. Finally, on December 2 (O.S.), 1690, came the day of reckoning, when the vice-governor and his council marched over to the Brandenburg warehouse, with the Company's smith to break the lock, and a committee of inhabitants, mainly planters, to appraise the condemned goods. On Laporte's refusal to accede to the council's formal demand to open the magazine and after vigorous protests and appeals by the Brandenburgers the doors were forcibly opened and the appraisal begun. Lorentz carefully notes in his journal Laporte's remark to Delicaet and Berentsen that [...] "if they (the Brandenburgers) were as strong in the land as we (the Danes) we should not have done what we did." [...] He quotes this as an evidence of their [...] "good(!) intentions" [...] and of [...] "what they had up their sleeves." [...] By Christmas Eve, two of the Brandenburg warehouses had practically been empties of all their sugar and cotton. The value was estimated by the director-general at 24,652 pieces-of-eight, remarkable precision, considering that he had refused to send a representative to participate in the weighing.|$|R
40|$|This paper uses an {{historical}} perspective {{to examine the}} labor market prospects and the macroeconomic setting facing mothers with dependent children who were (or would have been) enrolled in the old AFDC program, now that their welfare status will be handled by the new state programs {{in the wake of}} the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act, passed by Congress in 1996. The new law mandates the end to entitlements to cash <b>payments</b> <b>for</b> these women and their families and requires that they become self-supporting after the <b>time</b> <b>limits</b> <b>for</b> the cash <b>payments</b> are reached—a maximum of five years. Effectively, job holding is to replace welfare assistance as the main means of self-support. This paper documents the historical record of three trends that, given the new welfare laws, will largely determine the future poverty status of the affected women: wage growth, women’s labor force participation, and single-parent families (which reflect trends in marital breakups and in out-of-wedlock births). Since 1959, the first year for the modern series of poverty statistics, both women’s labor force participation and female headship of families have increased, the latter increasing poverty rates and the former, by itself, reducing poverty rates. The paper argues that wage growth is central to reducing poverty, especially now that government income support programs have been drastically reduced. The favorable economic record in the United States from 1959 to 1973, when wages and family incomes grew, is contrasted with the period from 1973 to 1997, when wages stopped growing and the growth in family incomes was slow. Given the difficulty in reversing demographic trends, macroeconomic economic growth appears necessary and effective to reduce poverty. ...|$|R
40|$|A ConstituiÃÃo de 1988 Ã a Carta Constitucional que mais instituiu direitos sociais, dentre esses estÃo os direitos previdenciÃrios, tanto em relaÃÃo ao Regime Geral de PrevidÃncia Social, que rege os critÃrios de concessÃo de aposentadoria aos trabalhadores cujos contratados de trabalhado sÃo regidos pela CLT, quanto do Regime PrÃprio de PrevidÃncia Social, dos servidores pÃblicos civis e militares. Apesar desses avanÃos nos direitos sociais serem resultado de lutas e reivindicaÃÃes de homens e mulheres, que foram Ãs ruas em busca de melhores condiÃÃes de trabalho e vida, organizados em sindicatos, partidos de esquerda, movimentos sociais, a promulgaÃÃo desta Carta foi feita pela elite brasileira, representada pela direita. Todavia, mal encerrou o processo de aprovaÃÃo desta ConstituiÃÃo, esses mesmos grupos, comeÃaram a atuar na implantaÃÃo do capitalismo em sua forma neoliberal, iniciando atrelado a este o processo de âreforma da previdÃncia social brasileiraâ. Apesar das tentativas de implantaÃÃo desta ao longo do governo Collor/Itamar, esta foi efetivada somente em 1998 com a aprovaÃÃo da Emenda Constitucional nÂ 20 / 98. Essa emenda acabou com a aposentadoria por tempo de serviÃo, implantou a aposentadoria por tempo de contribuiÃÃo, definiu teto mÃximo para pagamento de benefÃcios previdenciÃrios do regime geral e instituiu o regime de previdÃncia complementar, seguindo critÃrios definidos pelo Banco Mundial, atrelado ao FMI e governo estadunidense. No entanto, mesmo conseguindo a aprovaÃÃo da EC nÂ 20, o governo FHC nÃo conseguiu avanÃar no sentido da desregulamentaÃÃo dos direitos previdenciÃrios dos servidores pÃblicos. Esse retrocesso foi conseguido na reforma seguinte implantada ao final do 1 Â ano do governo Lula (2003), atravÃs da aprovaÃÃo da Emenda Constitucional nÂ 41. Nosso objetivo Ã analisar o processo da reforma previdenciÃria brasileira, de 1990 a 2003, a partir das discussÃes {{realizadas}} nas votaÃÃes das PECs no Ãmbito do Congresso Nacional, pensado enquanto sociedade polÃtica, formada por representantes de grupos com interesses heterogÃneos, visando perceber as contradiÃÃes e conflitos intra/extraclasseThe 1988 Constitution is the Constitutional Charter {{was instituted}} more social rights, {{among these are}} pension rights, both {{in relation to the}} General Welfare, the criteria governing the granting of retirement to workers whose contract of workers are governed by the Labor Code, as the Regime of Social Security Self, the civil servants and the military. Despite these advances in social rights were the result of struggles and demands {{of men and women who}} took to the streets in search of better conditions of work and life, organized into unions, leftist parties, social movements, the promulgation of the Charter was made by elite Brazil, represented by the right. However, barely closed the adoption of this Constitution, these same groups, began working in the implementation of capitalism in its neoliberal form, starting coupled to this process of "welfare reform Brazilian". Despite attempts to implement this throughout the Collor / Itamar, this was effective only in 1998 with the approval of Constitutional Amendment. 20 / 98. This amendment ended with retirement for length of service, deployed retirement contribution <b>time,</b> set maximum <b>limit</b> <b>for</b> <b>payment</b> of pension benefits under the general scheme and the mandatory pension scheme, following criteria set by the World Bank, the IMF and government linked U. S. However, even getting the approval of Amendment. 20, the Cardoso government failed to move towards deregulation pension rights of public employees. This setback was achieved in the reform implemented following the end of the 1 st year of the Lula government (2003), through the adoption of Constitutional Amendment 41. Our goal is to analyze the process of pension reform in Brazil, 1990 - 2003, from the discussions in the polls of PECs in the National Congress, thought of as political society, formed by representatives of groups with heterogeneous interests, aiming to realize the contradictions and conflicts intra / extra-clas...|$|R
40|$|<b>Time</b> <b>Limit</b> <b>for</b> Tax Assessment The thesis {{deals with}} the <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> <b>for</b> tax {{assessment}} as it is regulated especially in the Tax Procedure Code (Act No. 280 / 2009 Coll.). The <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> <b>for</b> tax assessment represents {{a period of time}} during which it is possible to assess the tax. This <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> thus creates a time frame of the whole tax administration because tax decision is its aim, and in the case in which tax cannot be assessed {{there is no reason to}} proceed with any tax administration. Its main purpose consists in the establishment of certainty providing that after the lapse of the period of time, rights and duties relating to substantive tax law cannot be changed. The thesis is composed of two basic chapters. Chapter One is introductory and describes the phenomenon of <b>time</b> <b>limits.</b> It is subdivided into three parts. Part One focuses on the concept and categories of <b>time</b> <b>limits.</b> Part Two explains general aspects of the <b>time</b> <b>limit</b> <b>for</b> tax assessment.

The justifications for enacting this Act were the illiquidity of the business sector and the implementation of the EU Directive on combating late payment in commercial transactions. Yet, the Act includes several differences in comparison to the regime envisaged in the Directive. The <b>time</b> <b>limits</b> governing the performance of monetary liabilities in transactions between economic operators (undertakings) are identical with those in the EU Directive; however, the Act does not regulate payment in installment and does not provide for an extension of <b>time</b> <b>limits</b> unless expressly agreed.
