5|$|At {{the end of}} the war Rodd {{returned}} home, but {{the marriage}} was essentially over; although remaining on friendly terms, the couple led separate lives. Mitford's visit to France in late 1945 had revived her longing to be there, and in April 1946, having given up working in the shop the previous month, she left London to make her permanent home in Paris; she never lived in England again. She was a prolific letter writer, and kept contact with her large cohort of friends by a voluminous correspondence. According to Hastings, she developed many of her friendships far further on paper <b>than</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> have done through normal social intercourse.|$|E
5|$|On October 14, 1853, {{following}} the National Woman's Rights Convention held in Cleveland, Ohio, Stone and Lucretia Mott addressed Cincinnati’s first women’s rights meeting, arranged by Henry Blackwell, a local businessman {{from a family}} of capable women, who had taken an interest in Stone. After that successful meeting, Stone accepted Blackwell's offer to arrange a lecturing tour for her in the western states – considered then to be those west of Pennsylvania and Virginia. Over the following thirteen weeks, Stone gave over forty lectures in thirteen cities, during which a report to the New York Tribune said she was stirring the West on women’s rights “as it is seldom stirred on any subject whatsoever.” After four lectures in Louisville, Stone was begged to repeat the entire course and told she was having more effect there <b>than</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> have anywhere else. An Indianapolis newspaper reported that Stone “set about two-thirds {{of the women in the}} town crazy after women’s rights and placed half the men in a similar predicament.” St. Louis papers said her lectures attracted the largest crowds ever assembled there, filling the city’s largest auditorium beyond its capacity of two thousand. Chicago papers praised her lectures as the best of the season, and said they were inspiring discussion and debate in the city’s homes and meeting places. When Stone headed home in January, 1854, she left behind incalculable influence.|$|E
25|$|Kim Delaney as Megan Donner; Horatio's first {{partner and}} a {{respected}} MDPD Police Lieutenant. She {{was the director}} of the MDPD Crime Lab prior to taking indefinite leave due to the death of her husband, who was killed in the line of duty. She believes in following the evidence, and as such is often seen as adversarial to Horatio's go-with-the-gut detective style. As a result of this, Megan resigns, finding the pressure of the job to now be more <b>than</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> handle. (season 1).|$|E

25|$|As Amelia's adored son George grows up, his {{grandfather}} Mr Osborne relents towards him (though not towards Amelia) and takes {{him from his}} impoverished mother, who knows the rich old man will give him a better start in life <b>than</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> manage. After twelve years abroad, both Joseph Sedley and Dobbin return. Dobbin professes his unchanged love to Amelia. Amelia is affectionate, but she cannot forget {{the memory of her}} dead husband. Dobbin mediates a reconciliation between Amelia and her father-in-law, who dies soon after. He had amended his will, bequeathing young George half his large fortune and Amelia a generous annuity.|$|E
25|$|In 1931 Courtneidge and Hulbert {{suffered}} a serious setback when {{they discovered that}} their financial manager had been speculating with their money, suffering heavy losses and putting their business into liquidation. Hulbert accepted responsibility for all the business's debts and undertook to repay every creditor. To achieve this, he and Courtneidge temporarily went their separate professional ways, reasoning that they could earn more as individual stars than as a double act. A boom in the film industry enabled both to earn large sums; Courtneidge appeared in 11 British films and one Hollywood film in the 1930s. She was amused to find that in eight weeks in a film studio she could earn more <b>than</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> in {{a year in the}} theatre. She and Hulbert managed to work together on several films, including The Ghost Train (1931) and Jack's the Boy (1932).|$|E
25|$|Cinderpaw {{falls from}} the Sky Oak, {{breaking}} her back leg. As Leafpool's determination to heal her begins to border on an obsession, Jaypaw begins to wonder why. One night, he falls asleep by Cinderpaw and wakes up in a strange forest. There he meets Cinderpaw, unhurt, who leads him to a camp filled with familiar smells; ThunderClan's previous home in the forest. Cinderpaw describes how she once lived there before the Great Journey and asks Jaypaw to tell Leafpool that she is proud of her, and that she has learned far more <b>than</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> have ever taught her. By then Jaypaw is confused, but upon looking into Cinderpaw's eyes, he sees a series of flashbacks from her previous life. Jaypaw realizes that when Cinderpelt, the former ThunderClan medicine cat, died in Twilight she was reincarnated as Cinderpaw, without Cinderpaw herself knowing it. However, when Cinderpaw wakes she does not remember the dream, only that Jaypaw {{had been able to}} see in it.|$|E
60|$|Clementina {{could not}} pretend that Gregory had asked, but <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not {{blame him for}} a {{forgetfulness}} of Mrs. Lander which she had shared with him. This helped somehow to deepen the misgiving which followed her from Mrs. Lander's bed to her own, and haunted her far into the night. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> escape from it only by promising herself {{to deal with it}} the first thing in the morning. She did this in terms much briefer <b>than</b> <b>she</b> thought <b>she</b> <b>could</b> have commanded. <b>She</b> supposed she would have to write a very long letter, but she came to the end of all she need say, in a very few lines.|$|R

50|$|Subsequently, Bethany {{lets the}} reporters {{interview}} her. One asks {{her what she}} would do if given the chance to undo the loss of her arm. She says that she would still lose it because she can embrace more people now <b>than</b> <b>she</b> ever <b>could</b> with both.|$|R
500|$|Conversely, Price Peterson, {{writing for}} TV.com, gave a more mixed review, heavily criticizing the {{resolution}} to Veronica's rape case. While calling it an [...] "entertaining episode", {{he said that}} it had an [...] "appalling message." [...] He explained by writing that [...] "egardless of Duncan having been drugged, Veronica could not give consent to him any more <b>than</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> to the dudes who were playing puppet-girl with her during the party. Regardless of the retroactive comfort of knowing that she'd lost her virginity to someone she liked, Veronica did not remember it...That kind of psychological trauma goes away immediately?" [...] Kimberly Roots of TV Line called the episode [...] "cathartic" [...] and that [...] "we get a huge reveal from Duncan, some unintentionally very public LoVe PDA and a say-it-ain’t-so-Logan! cliffhanger that swings us right into the season finale." ...|$|E
500|$|Hilda Ellis Davidson {{points out}} a tale from Iceland that {{features}} a female settler [...] "whose husband had died on the voyage out, establishing her claim {{to a piece of}} land by driving a young hiefer round it." [...] Davidson notes that in Landnámabók, this is recorded as a recognized method for a woman to claim land, and the work further details that [...] "she might not possess more <b>than</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> encircle in this way between sunrise and sunset on a spring day." [...] Davidson comments that [...] "this sounds like a ritual taking over of land rather than a legal requirement, like the custom of men lighting fires when taking new land, and {{it is possible that the}} women's custom was linked with the fertility goddess." [...] In addition, Davidson notes that Zealand is the most fertile region of Denmark.|$|E
500|$|... 'Fly Like A Bird', is a kitchen-sink, hyper-produced gospel number, but {{is really}} quite moving. There is a real, human yearning for mercy in it — Mariah’s true cry for help from a place of near-suicidal despair: 'Sometimes this life can be so cold /(Lord) I pray you'll come and [...] carry me home'. But there’s {{a lot of hope}} and faith in this wounded voice: Carey keeps, with {{touching}} conviction, a firm grip on the idea that some higher, divine intelligence out there loves her, even if nobody else does; even if she is lost to herself. It comes across emotionally, because her heart is fully in it — Mimi has been beaten, humiliated, heartbroken; joys have been slapped out of her hands quicker <b>than</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> appreciate them. She’s deeply confused, and God, she really needs help. Hell: We’ve all been there.|$|E

500|$|Alice and Louis's {{return to}} Darmstadt as Grand Duke and Duchess {{was met with}} celebration that Alice did not expect. However, she found her duties overwhelming, writing to her mother that she [...] "dreaded everything". Alice used her new role to reform the social {{conditions}} of Darmstadt, but found the responsibility of being Landesmutter (mother of her people) strenuous. In another letter to her mother, she wrote that her duties were [...] "more <b>than</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> stand in the long run". She was distressed by a rumour that she was once unkind to Louis's aunt, Grand Duchess Mathilde Caroline, and she was hurt by an unkind letter from Queen Victoria. Alice complained to Louis that the letter [...] "made me cry with anger...I wish I were dead and it probably will not be too long before I give Mama that pleasure." [...] However, no mention is made of what provoked this angry outburst.|$|E

2500|$|Those {{who knew}} Oughton {{recognized}} this period {{as the major}} turning point in her life; according to Powers, Oughton came to feel something close {{to a sense of}} shame at being American. In Fugitive Days, Bill Ayers writes that Oughton [...] "had had an abundance of experience in Guatemala, a torrent, almost more <b>than</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> endure. [...] She now sometimes suffered the full flood of her experiences." [...] Oughton became much more aware of the United States' impact on foreign countries, and she did not return to Philadelphia the same Midwest Republican. Oughton's old friends from college noticed upon her return to the United States how she had matured, while also displaying sadness regarding the poverty she encountered in Guatemala in the previous two years.|$|E
5000|$|In November 2005, Pat Fordice {{resigned}} {{as the city}} of Jacksons interim head of Human and Cultural Services. At the time, she indicated that the full-time position was more demanding <b>than</b> <b>she</b> believed <b>she</b> <b>could</b> handle. <b>She</b> was also a co-host of Woman to Woman, with Juanita Sims Doty, on Mississippi Public Broadcasting.

60|$|His {{hand was}} upon the latch before she {{realized}} that he was actually going. She sprang to her feet. Abuse, scorn, upbraidings, even violence--she had been prepared for all of these.

60|$|On the {{threshold}} she paused--turned partly round--for perchance {{the idea of}} entering alone and all so changed, the home of so intense a former life, was more dreary and desolate <b>than</b> even <b>she</b> <b>could</b> bear.
