25|$|The family plays {{a central}} role in Judaism, both {{socially}} and in transmitting the traditions of the religion. To honour one's father and mother is one of the Ten Commandments. Jewish families try to have close, respectful family relationships, with care for both the elderly and young. Religious observance {{is an integral part of}} home life, including the weekly Sabbath and keeping kosher dietary laws. The Talmud tells parents to <b>teach</b> <b>their</b> <b>children</b> a trade and survival skills, and children are asked to look after their parents.|$|E
25|$|Noongar {{people live}} in many country towns {{throughout}} the south-west {{as well as in}} the major population centres of Perth, Mandurah, Bunbury, Geraldton, Albany and Esperance. Many country Noongar people have developed long-standing relationships with wadjila (white fella) farmers and continue to hunt kangaroo and gather bush tucker (food) as well as to <b>teach</b> <b>their</b> <b>children</b> stories about the land. In a few areas in the south-west, visitors can go on bushtucker walks, trying foods such as kangaroo, emu, quandong jam or relish, bush tomatoes, witchetty grub pâté and bush honey.|$|E
25|$|At the time, Bonneauville was {{governed by}} the North-West Territories, as the {{province}} of Saskatchewan {{had yet to be}} created. There was no legislative act regulating education in the area. Consequently, the school was dependent on ratepayers for funding. Having this burden enabled the residents of Bonneauville, under the North-West Territories Act of 1875, to choose which language the school would <b>teach</b> <b>their</b> <b>children</b> in. Because records were vague during the school's first two years of operation, it is difficult to ascertain which language they learned in. However, it is likely that they learned in French because the majority of residents were francophones in 1888.|$|E

25|$|In the Islamic conception, {{every human}} being has a {{responsibility}} towards oneself. Since human life is sacred and initially created by divine rather than human agency, people are responsible for trying to keep their bodies and souls healthy, and not causing themselves spiritual or physical harm. Consequently, sport has obvious attractions in Islam: traditions record that Muḥammad raced with his wife 'Ā'ishah, and that he encouraged parents to <b>teach</b> <b>their</b> <b>children</b> swimming, riding and archery. Persian miniatures show Muslim women jointly playing polo with men in the same field. In the twenty-first century, some Muslim sociologists even argue {{that it should be}} obligatory for Muslim females to participate in sport of some kind.|$|E
25|$|Often {{times after}} {{internment}} families {{could not be}} reunited. Many mothers were left with children, but no husband. Furthermore, communities were impossible to rebuild. The lack of community lead to an even more intensified gap between the generations. Children had no one with whom to speak Japanese outside the home {{and as a result}} they rarely learned the language fluently. The lack of community also led to a lack of Japanese foundation and many children lost touch with their culture. Mothers had also learned to be bolder in their own way and were now taking on wage-earning jobs, which meant that they had less time to <b>teach</b> <b>their</b> <b>children</b> about traditional Japanese culture and traditions. The internment camps had forever changed the way of Japanese-Canadian life.|$|E

[...] In the Second Treatise on Government (1689), he contends that it is the parents' duty to educate their children and to act for them because children, though they have the ability to reason when young, do not do so consistently and are therefore usually irrational; it is the parents' obligation to <b>teach</b> <b>their</b> <b>children</b> to become rational adults so that they will not always be fettered by parental ties.|$|E

2500|$|Shema Yisrael (or Sh'ma Yisrael; [...] "Hear, [...] Israel") are {{the first}} two words of {{a section of the}} Torah, and is the title, better known as The Shema) of a prayer that serves as a {{centerpiece}} of the morning and evening Jewish prayer services. The first verse encapsulates the monotheistic essence of Judaism: [...] "Hear, O Israel: the [...] our God, the [...] is one" [...] (...) , found in , sometimes alternatively translated as [...] "The [...] is our God, the [...] is one." [...] Observant Jews consider the Shema {{to be the most important}} part of the prayer service in Judaism, and its twice-daily recitation as a mitzvah (religious commandment).

2500|$|A {{subset of}} heteronormativity {{is the concept}} of heteronormative temporality. This {{ideology}} states that the ultimate life goal for society is heterosexual marriage. Societal factors influence adults to search for a partner of the opposite sex to engage in heterosexual marriage with the goal of having children through the traditional nuclear family structure. Heteronormative temporality promotes abstinence only until marriage. Many American parents adhere to this heteronormative narrative, and <b>teach</b> <b>their</b> <b>children</b> accordingly. According to [...] Amy T. Schalet, it seems that the bulk of parent-child sex education revolves around abstinence only practices in the United States, but this differs {{in other parts of the}} world. Similarly, George Washington University Professor Abby Wilkerson discusses the ways in which the healthcare and medicinal industries reinforce the views of heterosexual marriage in order to promote heteronormative temporality. The concept of heteronormative temporality extends beyond heterosexual marriage to include a pervasive system where heterosexuality is seen as a standard, and anything outside of that realm is not tolerated. Wilkerson explains that it dictates aspects of everyday life such as nutritional health, socio-economic status, personal beliefs, and traditional gender roles.|$|E

2500|$|The {{organized}} tribes, {{which developed}} from kinship and geographic communities, establish their own requirements for membership, {{as well as}} what they consider its obligations. Generally, members must pay dues; attend tribal meetings (which are usually monthly in the [...] "home" [...] areas); volunteer to serve as a tribal officer when asked; help to put on tribal events; belong to the tribal church (if one exists and they are able); <b>teach</b> <b>their</b> <b>children</b> their people's history and pass on traditional crafts; volunteer to represent the tribe at the Virginia Council on Indians, the United Indians of Virginia, or at other tribes' powwows; speak at engagements for civic or school groups; and live in a good way, so as to best represent their tribe and Native Americans in general. Most Indian tribes maintain some traditions from before the time of European settlement, and are keen to pass these on to their children. Although Indians are also highly involved in non-native culture and employment, they regularly engage in activities for their individual tribes, including wearing regalia and attending powwows, heritage festivals, and tribal homecomings. Individuals try to maintain a balance between elements of their traditional culture and participating in the majority culture.|$|E
2500|$|By 1798 Rapp and {{his group}} of {{followers}} {{had already begun to}} distance themselves from mainstream society and intended to establish a new religious congregation of fellow believers. In the Lomersheimer declaration, written in 1798, these religious Separatists presented their statement of faith, based on Christian principles, to the Wurttemberg legislature. Rapp's followers declared their desire to form a separate congregation who would meet in members’ homes, free from Lutheran Church doctrines. The group supported the belief that baptism was not necessary until children could decide for themselves whether they wanted to become a Christian. They also believed that confirmation for youth was not necessary and communion and confession would only be held a few times a year. Although the Separatists supported civil government, the group refused to make a physical oath in its support, [...] "for according to the Gospel not oath is allowed him who gives evidence of a righteous life as an upright man." [...] They also refused to serve in the military or attend Lutheran schools, choosing instead to <b>teach</b> <b>their</b> <b>children</b> at home. This declaration of faith, along with some later additions, guided the Harmony Society's religious beliefs even after they had emigrated from Germany to the United States.|$|E
2500|$|Sex {{education}} {{is still a}} debate in the United States to this day. Some parents believe that their children's school programs encourage sexual activity, and the schools {{believe that there are}} many students that don't get any sex education at home. The goal for the parents is for their children to follow their family values. Parents want the ability to <b>teach</b> <b>their</b> <b>children</b> what they want about sex education rather than school programs teaching them of things that certain things that parents are trying to avoid. Sex education programs in schools are mainly trying to give the students a complete picture about sex and sexuality. They want students to know their bodies as well as know how to protect them and make smart decisions. In a study titled [...] "Emerging Answers: Research Findings on Programs to reduce Teen Pregnancy" [...] showed that sex education programs in schools are having a huge impact on teen's decisions to remain abstinent or to use contraceptives if they do choose to have intercourse (1). School programs are teaching students everything they need to know about sex and sexuality and that is helping these same students {{to make their own decisions}} and to be safe no matter what they choose to do.|$|E
