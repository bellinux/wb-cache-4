5|$|The 1992 Maastricht Treaty obliges most EU {{member states}} <b>to</b> <b>adopt</b> <b>the</b> euro upon meeting certain {{monetary}} and budgetary convergence criteria, {{although not all}} states have done so. The United Kingdom and Denmark negotiated exemptions, while Sweden (which joined the EU in 1995, after the Maastricht Treaty was signed) turned down the euro in a 2003 referendum, and has circumvented the obligation <b>to</b> <b>adopt</b> <b>the</b> euro by not meeting the monetary and budgetary requirements. All nations that have joined the EU since 1993 have pledged <b>to</b> <b>adopt</b> <b>the</b> euro in due course.|$|E

40|$|The {{concept of}} cloud {{computing}} services is {{appealing to the}} small and medium enterprises (SMEs), {{with the opportunity to}} acquire modern information technology resources as a utility and avoid costly capital investments in technology resources. However, the adoption of the cloud computing services presents significant challenges to the SMEs. The SMEs need to determine a path <b>to</b> <b>adopting</b> <b>the</b> cloud computing services that would ensure their sustainable presence in the cloud computing environment. Information about approaches <b>to</b> <b>adopting</b> <b>the</b> cloud computing services by the SMEs is fragmented. Through an interpretive design, we suggest that the SMEs need to have a strategic and incremental intent, understand their organizational structure, understand the external factors, consider the human resource capacity, and understand the value expectations from the cloud computing services to forge a successful path <b>to</b> <b>adopting</b> <b>the</b> cloud computing services. These factors would contribute to a model of cloud services for SMEs...|$|R

5|$|Agreeing with Browne-Wilkinson, Lord Griffiths also wrote, {{in regards}} to {{legislative}} interpretation, that: The days have long passed when the courts adopted a strict constructionist view of interpretation which required them <b>to</b> <b>adopt</b> <b>the</b> literal meaning of the language.

5|$|As a {{young man}} he married Rampanambonitany. Oral history {{provides}} two conflicting accounts of their marriage. According to one version, the couple had no children of their own, leading the king <b>to</b> <b>adopt</b> <b>the</b> eight daughters and five sons of his sister Rangorinimerina. In another version, {{at least some of}} the five sons and eight daughters issued from the king's marriage, and his son Rakotomavo was adopted from a woman called Rangorimanana. The remaining four sons were named Andriantoarana, Andriamohara, Ratsimanjaka and Andriampalimana. The names of only three of his eight daughters are preserved in the oral histories: Randriamizaza, Rahisatra and Rahira.|$|E
5|$|At {{the first}} tournament in 1920, {{there were many}} {{differences}} from the modern game: games were played outdoors on natural ice, forward passes were not allowed, the rink (which had been intended to be used only for figure skating) was 56m×18m (165ft×58.5ft) and two 20-minute periods were played. Each team had seven players on the ice, the extra position being the rover.

5|$|Countershading, like counter-illumination, {{has rarely}} been applied in {{practice}} for military camouflage, though not because military authorities were unaware of it.

5|$|Following his {{decision}} not to run for re-election as mayor in 1893, three years later, McCauley sought to be Edmonton's representative in the North-West Territories Legislature. During his term as representative, he worked to upgrade Edmonton's school system, along with upgrading the town's trade industry. He served in this capacity until 1902, when he was defeated. During his time, McCauley kept his focus on his development of the school system, introducing a single tax bill intended to give schools boards power <b>to</b> <b>adopt</b> <b>the</b> tax.|$|E
5|$|Further {{construction}} of the line was limited {{by a lack of}} funds. Russell asked the LNWR <b>to</b> <b>adopt</b> <b>the</b> line in August 1865, to no avail. An Act of 1866 gave permission to raise a further £20,000, with loans of £6,600. After raising this capital, the line was opened to Llanerchymedd in 1866, with the temporary station at Llangefni replaced by a permanent structure half a mile further on. Captain Rich, when surveying the line, noted that the curves and gradients were severe, and recommended that the line be worked at moderate speed. He also noted the lack of turntables, and the company's intention to use Fairlie engines on the line.|$|E
