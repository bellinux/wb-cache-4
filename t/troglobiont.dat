Hypothetically, trogloxenes characterized as not adapted, and troglophiles as not completely adapted to thermally stable subterranean environment, have retained or partially retained their ability to withstand freezing, while most <b>troglobionts</b> have not. We tested this hypothesis experimentally on 37 species inhabiting caves in Slovenia, analyzing their lower lethal temperatures in summer and winter, or for one season, if the species was not present in caves during both seasons.

40|$|Terrestrial {{animals in}} {{subterranean}} habitats are often classified {{according to their}} degree of morphological or ecological specialization to the subterranean environment. The commonly held view is that, as distance into a cave increases, the frequency of morphologically specialized, i. e., troglomorphic, species or ecological specialization will increase. We tested this hypothesis for the fauna in 54 caves in Slovenia-the classical land for subterranean biology. We found that there exist two ecologically well separated terrestrial subsurface faunas: one shallow and one deep. 1) The shallow subterranean fauna, adapted to the terrestrial shallow subterranean habitats (SSHs) in the upper 10 m of subsurface strata, is most diverse. It consists of randomly distributed non-troglobionts and a major group of <b>troglobionts</b> adapted to the soil root zone. 2) The deep subterranean fauna is represented by a minor group of <b>troglobionts,</b> adapted to caves. <b>Troglobionts</b> are strictly divided between the two faunas.

40|$|Cave-obligate organisms {{usually have}} smaller ranges and their assemblages have higher beta {{diversity}} than their epigean counterparts. Phylogenetic and functional diversity is usually low in cave communities, leading to taxonomic and functional disharmony, with entire groups {{missing from the}} subterranean realm. The objective of this work is to compare range, beta diversity, phylogenetic and functional diversity, taxonomic and functional disharmony of epigean versus <b>troglobiont</b> spiders in the Iberian Peninsula. The median extent of occurrence {{was found to be}} 33 times higher for epigean than for cave species. Beta diversity was significantly higher for <b>troglobiont</b> assemblages. Cave assemblages present lower phylogenetic and functional diversities than expected by chance. Taxonomic disharmony was noticeable, with many speciose families, namely Gnaphosidae, Salticidae and Lycosidae, absent in caves. Functional disharmony was equally high, with ambush hunters and sensing web weavers being absent in caves. The small range and high beta diversity of <b>troglobiont</b> spiders in the Iberian Peninsula is typical of many cave-obligate organisms, caused by the fragmentation and isolation of cave systems and the low vagility and high habitat specialization of species. Caves were colonized mainly by pre-adapted lineages, with high proportions of eutroglophile species. Some families no longer occur in surface habitats, possibly since the last glaciations, and currently are restricted to caves in the region. Few hunting strategies and web types are efficient in caves and these dominate among the <b>troglobiont</b> species. As <b>troglobiont</b> communities are of low alpha diversity, with low functional redundancy, have narrow ranges, present high levels of population fragmentation and are taxonomically unique, they should present higher proportions of imperilled species than epigean spiders in the Iberian Peninsula.

The focus {{of this paper is}} on identifying the role played by cave features in the occurrence of aquatic <b>troglobiont</b> fauna and assessing the relationship between species with and without troglomorphic features and their cave habitat requirements. Organisms’ occurrence and environmental features were assessed during a repeated survey of all the caves occurring in a karstic valley of north-western Italy.

All the taxa did not occur randomly. Aquatic troglobionts preferred deep and dark caves while other non obligate cave dweller occurred in shallower and brighter caves. The most important variables assessing distribution within caves were distance from the entrance and the temperature variation range of the pools.

40|$|Seasonality in surface weather {{results in}} {{seasonal}} {{temperature and humidity}} changes in caves. Ecological and physiological differences among trogloxenes, troglophiles, and <b>troglobionts</b> result in species-dependent responses to this variability. To investigate these responses, we conducted five biological inventories in a marble cave in the Sierra Nevada Range, California, USA between May and December 2010. The cave was divided into six quadrats and temperature was continuously logged in each (humidity was logged at the entrance and in the deep cave). With increasing distance from the entrance, temperature changes were increasingly attenuated and lagged relative to surface temperature. Linear regressions were created to determine the relationship between measured environmental variables and diversity for cavernicoles (<b>troglobionts</b> and troglophiles) and trogloxenes cave– wide and in the transition zone. Diversity for cavernicoles and trogloxenes peaked in the entrance and deep cave zones, respectively. Quadrat, date, 2 -week antecedent temperature average, 2 -week antecedent temperature range, and trogloxene abundance explained 76 % of cavernicole diversity variability. Quadrat explained 55 % of trogloxene diversity variability. In the transition zone, trogloxene abundance explained 26 % of cavernicole variability and 2 -week antecedent temperature and 2 -week antecedent temperature range explained 40 % of trogloxene variability. In the transition zone, trogloxene diversity was inversely related to 2 -week antecedent temperature average and 2 -week antecedent temperature range, suggesting that species were moving into the transition zone when temperature was most stable. In a CCA of cavernicoles distribution data and environmental variables, 35 % of variation in species-specific distributions was attributable to quadrat, and non-significant percentages were explained by date and environmental variables. Differences in assemblage structure among quadrats were largely due to differences between distributions of trogloxenes and cavernicoles, but responses varied among species. Differences are likely due to ecological niche width, physiological constraints, and competition...|$|R

40|$|Subsurface biota extends over a {{wide variety}} of {{habitats}} that can be spatially interconnected. The largest communities of this subsurface biota inhabit cavities and are well known mainly in caves where biologists are able to have access. Data about deep subterranean communities and arthropods living under one thousand meters was unknown. An expedition to world’s deepest cave, Krubera-Voronja in Western Caucasus, revealed an interesting subterranean community, living below 2000 meters and represented by more than 12 species of arthropods, including several new species for science. This deep cave biota is composed of <b>troglobionts</b> and also epigean species, that can penetrate until - 2140 m. Deep subterranean ecosystems should not be seen only as an evolu- tionary dead end towards the troglomorphic syndrome, but also as a shelter for epigean species populations, especially during long periods of time when surface conditions are severe for their survival. Most of the subsurface biota depends on allochthonous sources of organic carbon coming from: water percolating from the surface, sinking streams that enter caves, and activities of animals mov- ing in and out of caves. The biocoenosis and the vertical distribution of invertebrate fauna of Krubera-Voronja are provided, from its entrance to the remarkable depth of 2140 meters, including the discovery of world’s deepest dwelling arthropod...|$|R
40|$|The {{study of}} {{subterranean}} Oniscidea in Portugal has been neglected for nearly 70 years, but recent investigations have revealed high diversity. All the terrestrial isopods from caves of mainland Portugal, including {{data from the}} literature and new material, are listed, revealing new biodiversity patterns. Twenty-seven species, belonging to 15 genera and six families, are known, of which 16 species {{are considered to be}} exclusively from subterranean ecosystems, i. e., <b>troglobionts.</b> Trichoniscidae is the most diverse family. Seven species in the family Trichoniscidae and one species in the family Styloniscidae are described as new (all with Reboleira & Taiti as authors) : Trichoniscoides bellesi sp. nov. from the Montejunto Massif; T. sicoensis sp. nov. from the Sic? Massif; Metatrichoniscoides salirensis sp. nov. from the typhonic valley of Caldas da Rainha; Troglonethes olissipoensis sp. nov. from the Lisbon Peninsula; T. arrabidaensis sp. nov. from the Arr?bida Massif; Miktoniscus longispina sp. nov. from the Sic? Massif and Cesaredas Plateau; Moserius inexpectatus sp. nov. from the Estremenho Massif; and Cordioniscus lusitanicus sp. nov. from Alentejo and Algarve, the southernmost provinces of Portugal. The subgenus Trogleluma Vandel, 1946 (Armadillidiidae) is raised to genus level. In this geographic region terrestrial isopods are the richest group of cave-adapted animals...|$|R
