5|$|Before Hollanda struck Mauritius, {{most people}} were already {{residing}} at home, due to the cyclone striking during the Chinese New Year. Officials closed the airport prior to the cyclone's arrival, and most stores and banks were also closed. Officials also ordered for cars <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>off</b> the roads during the storm and for people to remain indoors. Forecasters initially expected the storm would remain slightly offshore.|$|E
5|$|On November 2, 2010, in a {{game against}} the Ottawa Senators, Phaneuf {{sustained}} an injury in the leg by having it cut open with a skate from Peter Regin while crashing into the boards. He was carried off the ice immediately and had surgery done the same night. Phaneuf was said <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>off</b> the ice for four-to-six weeks, and made a return to the Leafs' line-up on December 9, 2010, a home ice game against the Philadelphia Flyers, which Philadelphia won 4–1, though he had one assist on the lone Toronto goal.|$|E
5|$|Sastre's {{team had}} been the one setting the pace in the peloton just before the climb, but fell off when Philip Deignan spun out and tumbled off the road into a ditch. Deignan's bike was damaged and he {{sustained}} numerous visible scrapes and bruises, but he managed to continue and finish the stage with the last gruppetto. Sastre himself seemed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>off</b> the form he had had before the rest day, and by virtue of Pellizotti's stage win and two-minute gap over the reigning Tour de France champion, he fell from third to fifth in the overall classification with Pellizotti moving up to third.|$|E

25|$|Mullion sailed Kingsmill to the Bight of Biafra and Gulf of Guinea islands. From {{there she}} took her slaves to Martinique.

25|$|In week 3, the Golden Hurricane {{made the}} drive to Norman for their 24th meeting with the Sooners, whom they had beaten only once since 1979. Tulsa {{appeared}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>off</b> to a good start, intercepting Landry Jones on the first {{play of the game}} and taking 25 of their first 27 snaps in Oklahoma territory, but two costly red-zone turnovers and a missed 50-yard field goal kept them scoreless in the first half while the Sooners built an insurmountable 31-0 lead. The Golden Hurricane offense failed to threaten at all in the second half and Tulsa was shut {{out for the first time}} since 2004, falling to 7–16–1 overall against Oklahoma.|$|E
25|$|In {{spite of}} the success, the design also {{demonstrated}} several serious problems. In particular, the gyroscopic platform had to be leveled out before use using several spirit levels, and then checked and repeatedly reset for accuracy. Worse, the gyros had a limited degree of movement, and if the plane banked far enough the gyro would reach its limit {{and have to be}} re-set from scratch - something that could happen even due to strong turbulence. If the gyros were found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>off,</b> the leveling procedure took as long as eight and a half minutes. Other minor problems were the direct current electric motors which drove the gyroscopes, whose brushes wore down quickly and left carbon dust throughout the interior of the device, and the positioning of the control knobs, which meant the bombardier could only adjust side-to-side or up-and-down aim at a time, not both. But in spite of all of these problems, the Mark XV was so superior to any other design that the Navy ordered it into production.|$|E
25|$|Tea Time is an oil {{painting}} on cardboard with dimensions 75.9 x 70.2cm (29.9 x 27.6 in), signed Metzinger and dated 1911 lower right. The painting represents a barely draped (nude) woman holding a spoon, {{seated at a}} table with a cup of tea. In the 'background', the upper left quadrant, stands a vase on a commode, table or shelf. A square or cubic shape, a chair or painting behind the model, espouses the shape of the stretcher. The painting is practically square, like the side of a cube. The woman's head is highly stylized, divided into geometrized facets, planes and curves (the forehead, nose, cheeks, hair). The source of light appears <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>off</b> to her right, with some reflected light {{on the left side of}} her face. Reflected light, consistently, can be seen on other parts of her body (breast, shoulder, arm). Her breast is composed of a triangle and a sphere. The faceting of the rest of her body, to some extent, coincides with actual muscular and skeletal features (collar bone, ribcage, pectorals, deltoids, neck tissue). Both of here shoulders are coupled with elements of the background, superimposed, gradational and transparent to varying degrees. Unidentified elements are composed of alternating angular structures, The colors employed by Metzinger are subdued, mixed (either on a palette of directly on the surface), with an overall natural allure. The brushwork is reminiscent of Metzinger's Divisionist period (ca. 1903–1907), described by the critic (Louis Vauxcelles) in 1907 as large, mosaic-like 'cubes', used to construct small but highly symbolic compositions.|$|E

500|$|In May 1992, Lombardo {{quit the}} band due to {{conflicts}} with other members, {{as well as}} his desire <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>off</b> tour for the birth of his first child. Lombardo formed his own band Grip Inc, with Voodoocult guitarist Waldemar Sorychta, and Slayer recruited former Forbidden drummer Paul Bostaph to take his place. Slayer made its debut appearance with Bostaph at the 1992 Monsters of Rock festival at Castle Donington. Bostaph's first studio effort was a medley of three Exploited songs, [...] "War," [...] "UK '82," [...] and [...] "Disorder," [...] with rapper Ice-T, for the Judgment Night movie soundtrack in 1993.|$|E
500|$|The {{film was}} {{conceived}} {{as a result of}} the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike, which delayed the seventh season for an entire year; the producers were exploring ways to get back on the air earlier. Ideas included airing webisodes or mobisodes. According to the President of Entertainment at Fox, [...] "We were going <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>off</b> the air for a while and how do you bridge that gap. We thought about doing something online and after talking with [...] Howard Gordon we decided to do it on air." [...] The working title for the film was 24: Exile, until the change to 24: Redemption.|$|E
500|$|Jeff Kaplan has {{commented on}} her harassing {{gameplay}} style, noting that: [...] characters like Tracer and Genji ... {{who are really}} unique in how Overwatch is played, and sometimes the absolute right thing for Tracer to be doing is <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>off</b> on her own, completely away from the objective or completely away from the team, harassing other players who are running back from the spawn. And she {{might not even be}} killing those players [...] She's a distracting, ambushing skirmisher. And that doesn't really fit in necessarily with objective time. [...] You can be the absolute MVP of the match when you're doing some of those things, and there's no way to really score it accurately.|$|E

500|$|From {{atop the}} ridge {{on the eastern}} side of the Ninnis Glacier, Mawson began to doubt the {{accuracy}} of the reports of land to the east by Charles Wilkes during the 1838–42 United States Exploring Expedition. By Wilkes' reckoning, Mawson recorded in his diary, [...] "We now appear <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>off</b> the real continent edge." [...] Concerned about overlap with Madigan's party to the north, he turned his party south. They made good progress initially, but beginning on 6 December a blizzard confined them to their tent for three days. On 9 December, they set off again, but Ninnis was struggling. He had developed neuralgia on the left side of his face and a whitlow on one of his fingers. The latter was making sleep difficult for him, and on 13 December Mawson lanced the finger.|$|E
500|$|The song selection, use {{of master}} recordings, and {{expansion}} to the full-band experience were praised. Dan Amrich of Official Xbox Magazine called the selection an [...] "excellent selection of material" [...] that avoided {{the most popular}} songs in favor of those that [...] "are the most fun to play". Addition of full band tracking for the songs was considered helpful to avoid making the game's material feel like [...] "warmed-over leftovers from the series' past", according to Gerstmann. The mixing {{of some of the}} songs was also considered <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>off,</b> with Roper specifically noting a too-loud bass and too-soft vocals for [...] "No One Knows". Roper noted that the PlayStation 2 version of the game suffered from graphics [...] "stuttering", making it difficult to hit notes even after refining the game's controller calibration, considering the impact as [...] "crippling the game".|$|E
500|$|The two-hour premiere episode {{cost up to}} $10 {{million to}} produce, and Cameron {{reportedly}} [...] "brought the pilot in on time and on budget". Subsequent episodes had a considerably smaller budget. Fox spent heavily on the promotional campaign for the premiere, paying for theatrical trailers, billboards, and guerilla marketing. Cameron took a [...] "very basic view" [...] of the show's chance of success, saying: [...] "If it flies, it flies. If it doesn't, it doesn't... If people connect with it, which I hope they will, fine. If we don't find an audience, we deserve <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>off</b> the air. It's that simple." [...] Eglee admitted the series had been [...] "routinely overbudget" [...] in the first season, and feared {{that this would be}} a factor in whether or not the show was renewed for a second season, though Cameron downplayed these concerns.|$|E
