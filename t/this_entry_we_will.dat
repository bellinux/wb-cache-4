The special case of events that occur in space (or, more precisely, on a plane) has developed some particular approaches, usually assuming spatial stationarity and isotropy (i. e. {{the distribution of the}} process is invariant under translations and rotations, respectively). In <b>this</b> <b>entry</b> <b>we</b> <b>will</b> focus on this type of process. Points, or events, take place at spatial locations, and we identify each event with its location. As an example, Figure 1 shows locations that experienced damage of modified Mercalli intensity (MMI) level VI in the 1989 Loma Prieta, CA, earthquake.

40|$|Introduction: Connectionist {{models have}} {{recently}} provided a concrete computational platform {{from which to}} explore how different initial constraints in the cognitive system can interact with an environment to generate the behaviors we find in normal development (Elman et al., 1996; Mareschal & Thomas, 2000). In this sense, networks embody several principles inherent to Piagetian theory, the major developmental theory of the twentieth century. By extension, these models provide the opportunity to explore how shifts in these initial constraints (or boundary conditions) can result {{in the emergence of}} the abnormal behaviors we find in atypical development. Although this field is very new, connectionist models have already been put forward to explain disordered language development in Specific Language Impairment (Hoeffner & McClelland, 1993), Williams Syndrome (Thomas & Karmiloff-Smith, 1999), and developmental dyslexia (Seidenberg and colleagues, see e. g. Harm & Seidenberg, in press); to explain unusual characteristics of perceptual discrimination in autism (Cohen, 1994; Gustafsson, 1997); and to explore the emergence of disordered cortical feature maps using a neurobiologically constrained model (Oliver, Johnson, Karmiloff-Smith, & Pennington, in press). In <b>this</b> <b>entry,</b> <b>we</b> <b>will</b> examine the types of initial constraints that connectionist modelers typically build in to their models, and how variations in these constraints have been proposed as possible accounts of the causes of particular developmental disorders. In particular, we will examine the claim that these constraints are candidates for what will constitute innate knowledge. First, however, we need to consider a current debate concerning whether developmental disorders are a useful tool to explore the (possibly innate) structure of the normal cognitive system. We will find that connectionist approaches are much more consistent with one side of this debate than the other...|$|E

40|$|Knowing {{what to do}} {{with the}} massive amount of data {{collected}} has always been an ongoing issue for many organizations. While data mining has been touted to be the solution, it has failed to deliver the impact despite its successes in many areas. One reason is that data mining algorithms were not designed for the real world, i. e., they usually assume a static view of the data and a stable execution environment where resources are abundant. The reality however is that data are constantly changing and the execution environment is dynamic. Hence, it becomes difficult for data mining to truly deliver timely and relevant results. Recently, the processing of stream data has received many attention. What is interesting is that the methodology to design stream-based algorithms may well be the solution to the above problem.

Dealing with a worldwide scale check-in patterns introduces a new challenge as the exact location information (e. g., location’s specific function, location’s exact geo-position) is difficult to determine. To address this issue, we use a unique combination of generative model and von Mises-Fisher distribution to determine the topic of a location at a specific time, given the check-in patterns and friendship networks information of all users who check in.
