5|$|M64 (NGC 4826) {{is known}} as the Black Eye Galaxy because of the {{prominent}} dark dust lane in front of the galaxy's bright nucleus. Also known as the Sleeping Beauty and Evil Eye galaxy, it is about 24 million light-years away. Recent studies indicate that the interstellar gas in the galaxy's outer regions rotates in the opposite direction from that in the inner regions, leading astronomers to believe that at least one satellite galaxy collided with it less <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>billion</b> years ago. All other evidence of the smaller galaxy has been assimilated. At the interface between the clockwise- and counterclockwise-rotating regions are many new nebulae and young stars.|$|E
5|$|Receiving {{light and}} other signals from distant astronomical sources can even take much longer. For example, {{it has taken}} 13billion (13) years for light to travel to Earth from the faraway galaxies viewed in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field images. Those photographs, taken today, capture images of the galaxies as they {{appeared}} 13billion years ago, {{when the universe was}} less <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>billion</b> years old. The fact that more distant objects appear to be younger, due to the finite speed of light, allows astronomers to infer the evolution of stars, of galaxies, and of the universe itself.|$|E
5|$|The star is {{estimated}} to be less <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>billion</b> years old. Because of its relative youth, Epsilon Eridani has a higher level of magnetic activity than the present-day Sun, with a stellar wind 30 times as strong. Its rotation period is 11.2days at the equator. Epsilon Eridani is smaller and less massive than the Sun, and has a comparatively lower level of elements heavier than helium. It is a main-sequence star of spectral class K2, which means that energy generated at the core through nuclear fusion of hydrogen is emitted from the surface at a temperature of about , giving it an orange hue.|$|E

They also supported Gottlieb Duttweiler's 1938popular initiative calling for the purchase of a thousand aircraft and the training of three thousand pilots. After 92,000citizens signed in support, nearly twice the number necessary for a national popular vote, the federal government offered a referendum proposal in 1939that was nearly as extensive, which was accepted by a 69percent majority.|$|E
5|$|The {{rotation}} {{of a star}} causes a Doppler shift to the spectrum. On average, {{this results in a}} broadening of the absorption lines in its spectrum, with the lines increasing in width with higher rates of rotation. However, only the rotational motion {{in the direction of the}} observer can be measured by this means, so the resulting data provides a lower limit on the star's rotation. This projected rotational velocity of Wolf 359's equator is less than 3 km/s, which is below the threshold of detection through spectral line broadening. This low rate of rotation may have been caused by loss of angular momentum through a stellar wind. Typically, the time scale for the spin down of a star at spectral class M6 is roughly 10 billion years, because fully convective stars like this lose their rotation more slowly than other stars. However, evolutionary models suggest that Wolf 359 is a relatively young star with an age of less <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>billion</b> years.|$|E
5|$|Wolf 359 {{is one of}} {{the faintest}} and lowest-mass stars known. At the {{light-emitting}} layer called the photosphere, it has a temperature of about 2,800 K, which is low enough for chemical compounds to form and survive. The absorption lines of compounds such as water and titanium(II) oxide have been observed in the spectrum. The surface has a magnetic field that is stronger than the average magnetic field on the Sun. As a result of magnetic activity caused by convection, Wolf 359 is a flare star that can undergo sudden increases in luminosity for several minutes. These flares emit strong bursts of X-ray and gamma ray radiation that have been observed by space telescopes. Wolf 359 is a relatively young star with an age of less <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>billion</b> years. No companions or disks of debris have been detected in orbit around it.|$|E

5|$|Hoag's Object, located 600 {{million light-years}} from Earth, {{is a member}} of the very rare class of galaxies known as ring galaxies. The outer ring is largely {{composed}} of young blue stars while the core is made up of older yellow stars. The predominant theory regarding its formation is that the progenitor galaxy was a barred spiral galaxy whose arms had velocities too great to keep the galaxy's coherence and therefore detached. Arp 220 is another unusual galaxy in Serpens. The prototypical ultraluminous infrared galaxy, Arp 220 is somewhat closer than Hoag's Object at 250 million light-years from Earth. It consists of two large spiral galaxies in the process of colliding with their nuclei orbiting at a distance of 1,200 light-years, causing extensive star formation throughout both components. It possesses a large cluster of more <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>billion</b> stars, partially covered by thick dust clouds near one of the galaxies' core. Another interacting galaxy pair, albeit in an earlier stage, consists of the galaxies NGC 5953 and NGC 5954.
