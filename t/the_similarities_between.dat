5|$|In {{the western}} Italian Alps, the Alpine chough nests {{in a greater}} variety of sites than red-billed chough, using natural cliffs, pot-holes and {{abandoned}} buildings, whereas the red-billed uses only natural cliffs (although it nests in old buildings elsewhere).

40|$|To study <b>the</b> <b>similarity</b> <b>between</b> moving object trajectories is {{important}} in many applications, e. g., to find the clusters of moving objects which share the same moving pattern, and infer the future locations of a moving object from its similar trajectories. To define <b>the</b> <b>similarity</b> <b>between</b> moving objects is a challenging task, since not only their locations change but also their speed and semantic features vary. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to measure <b>the</b> <b>similarity</b> <b>between</b> trajectories. <b>The</b> <b>similarity</b> is defined based on both geographic and semantic features of movements.

5|$|Historian Timothy Bolton has {{recently}} argued that <b>the</b> <b>similarities</b> <b>between</b> these genealogies {{is evidence of}} a shared family tradition between the descendants of Siward and Thorgil Sprakling. Bolton hypothesized that Siward's alleged father Bjorn was probably a historical figure, a brother of Thorgil Sprakling. Siward would then have been first cousin to Earl Ulf, the earl of Denmark who married Cnut's sister Estrith and founded the dynasty of Danish monarchs that eventually succeeded Cnut's. Bolton argued that the Sprakling family had only recently risen to prominence in Scandinavia, and so Siward's career in England was another indication of that family's success in Scandinavian politics.|$|E
