5|$|The next morning, Tara leaves {{early and}} decides to inform Rajat's mother. After Girish brings Tara the {{required}} insurance papers, she thanks him for always being there for her and apologises for being rude. She decides {{to go ahead with}} the surgery after all. Rajat is taken to surgery, and she holds his hand until they arrive at the operating room. Shiv, on the other hand, decides to take Pankaja off the ventilator and let his wife herself make the final call. Pankaja tries to breathe on her own as the viewers are treated with flashbacks of the heyday of both couples. Tara <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>seat</b> in the waiting lounge, and is joined by Shiv as the camera pans out.|$|E
500|$|On {{a stormy}} Cambridge night, Nina lets herself in to an office, {{where she is}} found by Professor Nigel Squires. He is holding a gun, {{but it is not}} loaded. Nina's boyfriend Simon is a fan of cryptic crosswords, but she is never able to help him. She has come to the office of Squires—a classicist who sets crosswords for Varsity as the Sphinx—to seek the answers to the next day's crossword. Squires sets about to teach Nina: [...] "I teach wild {{creature}} without hospital building" [...] results in ARCHITECTURE, which Simon studies. They turn to the clues for the next day, beginning to fill a large grid. Squires uses the name of the Sphinx because she would asphyxiate and consume those who failed to answer her riddle: she was [...] "devious and deadly". Squires makes tea, as Nina looks to his trophies. A picture of Squires with his late wife draws her attention, and they discuss the cut-throat world of competitive crosswording. Nina has answered DOWNANDOUT and WRAP; Squires answers DESI and helps with TRENT. Squires asks about Simon, but catches Nina in a lie; with her excuse being that she only wants to learn. Together, they deduce SWAMPLANDS, meaning [...] "bog". Nina, though, suggests that is should be bogs, otherwise Squires would be cheating. Suddenly spluttering, Squires <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>seat,</b> as Nina begins on the next clue. She suddenly displays clear proficiency, answering ASPHYXIATION.|$|E
500|$|Casablanca Records {{commissioned}} a music video {{to be directed}} by Jake Nava, who previously worked {{in the same year}} with Britney Spears on her music video for [...] "My Prerogative" [...] (2004). The music video for [...] "Rumors" [...] premiered on October 14, 2004 and October 20, 2004 through Disney Channel and MTV. In the beginning of the video, Lohan is followed by paparazzi as she is entering her car. It is revealed that this is a Lindsay-look-alike, and that the real Lohan is entering another car to go to a club. The car comes to a stop, and she then steps into an elevator and sings the first verse of the song, while she is filmed by a CCTV camera in the elevator. The next sequence shows her running through a hallway, dressed up, before getting into the club. There, she dances in the crowd, where she takes a picture of one of the paparazzi herself to get back at him. In the next sequence, she is walking slowly through the club where she finds the man who seems to be her boyfriend. She <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>seat</b> next to her lover and they begin kissing and touching each other, all the while being constantly filmed by cameras in the club. While Lohan sings the second chorus, she is trapped in a cage {{in the middle of the}} club and the whole crowd is watching her. After this Lohan is shown dancing in the club with her friends. At the end of the music video Lohan and her friends enter the top of a high-rise and perform a dance routine while helicopters are circling around them. Finally Lohan gets into a helicopter and escapes. In the end, she throws her camera away with all the pictures taken of her.|$|E

6000|$|She {{has noticed}} already that Julian is paler than usual, {{and that there}} is {{something}} in his manner at once uneasy and subdued--highly uncharacteristic of him at other times. He <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>seat</b> by her side, and kisses her hand. But--for {{the first time in his}} aunt's experience of him--he refuses the good things on the luncheon table, and he has nothing to say to the cat! That neglected animal takes refuge on Lady Janet's lap. Lady Janet, with her eyes fixed expectantly on her nephew (determining to [...] "have it out of him" [...] at the first opportunity), waits to hear what he has to say for himself. Julian has no alternative but to break the silence, and tell his story as he best may.|$|E

60|$|It is charming then to see {{the girls}} urge one another to dance; each vows with much {{dramatic}} gesture that she cannot, calling the Blessed Virgin to witness that she has strained her ankle and has a shocking cold. But some youth springs up and volunteers, inviting a particular damsel to join him. She is pushed forward, and the couple take their places. The man carefully puts down his cigarette, jams his broad-brimmed hat on his head, buttons his short coat and arches his back! The spectators cry: 'Ole!' The girl passes an arranging hand over her hair. The measure begins. The pair stand opposite one another, a yard or so distant, and foot it in accordance with one another's motions. It is not a thing of complicated steps, but, {{as one might expect}} from its Moorish origin, of movements of the body. With much graceful swaying from side to side the executants approach and retire, and at the middle of the dance change positions. It finishes with a great clapping of hands, the maiden sinks down among her friends and begins violently to fan herself, while her partner, with a great affectation of nonchalance, <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>seat</b> and relights his cigarette.|$|E
6000|$|There {{have been}} times (and they will come again no doubt) when I [...] could write to you about {{ordinary}} things in a way at least not [...] depressing; but for a good while now I have felt so tired out, [...] bodily and mentally, that I couldn't conscientiously ask you to [...] share my mood. The life I live here in the country, and so very [...] much alone, is capable of being the happiest or the unhappiest of [...] existences, as it all depends so on oneself and is so very little [...] interfered with by outside influences. Perhaps I am more than [...] usually subject to extremes of happiness and of depression, yet I [...] suppose everyone must have moments, {{even in the most}} varied and [...] distracting life, when the old questioning spirit, the demon of the [...] Why, Whence, Whither? stalks in like the skeleton at the feast and [...] <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>seat</b> beside him. I say everyone, but I must except those [...] rare and happy souls who really believe in Christianity, who no [...] longer strive after even goodness as it comes from one's own [...] effort, but take refuge in the mysterious sacrifice of Christ, his [...] merit sufficing, and in short throw themselves in the orthodox way [...] on the consoling truth of the Atonement--to me hitherto neither [...] comprehensible nor desirable. These people, having completely [...] surrendered self, having lost their lives, as it were in Christ, [...] must truly have found them, must know the rest that comes from [...] literally casting their care of doubt and strife and thought upon [...] the Lord.|$|E
60|$|He {{was born}} about 1860; {{and has been}} a member of Parliament since about 1890. For the first half of his life he was a Liberal; for the second half he has been a Conservative; but his actual policy in Parliament has {{remained}} largely unchanged and consistent. His policy in Parliament is as follows: he <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>seat</b> in a room downstairs at Westminster, and takes from his breast pocket an excellent cigar-case, from which in turn he takes an excellent cigar. This he lights, and converses with other owners of such cigars on equus celer or such matters as may afford him entertainment. Two or three times in the afternoon a bell rings; whereupon he deposits the cigar in an ashtray with great particularity, taking care not to break the ash, and proceeds to an upstairs room, flanked with two passages. He then walks into whichever of the two passages shall be indicated to him by a young man of the upper classes, holding a slip of paper. Having gone into this passage he comes out of it again, is counted by the young man and proceeds downstairs again; where he takes up the cigar once more, being careful not to break the ash. This process, which is known as Representative Government, has never called for any great variety in the manner of his life. Nevertheless, while his Parliamentary policy is unchanged, his change from one side of the House to the other did correspond with a certain change in his general policy in commerce and social life. The change of the party label is by this time quite a trifling matter; but there was in his case a change of philosophy or at least a change of project; though it was not so much becoming a Tory, as becoming rather the wrong kind of Socialist. He is a man with a history. It is a sad history, for he is certainly a less good man than he was when he started. That is why he is the man who is really behind Eugenics. It is because he has degenerated that he has come to talking of Degeneration.|$|E
