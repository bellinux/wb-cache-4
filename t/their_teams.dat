5|$|Four {{managers}} have twice led <b>their</b> <b>teams</b> {{to victory in}} the tournament, Johan Cruyff, Valeri Lobanovsky, Nereo Rocco and most recently Alex Ferguson, who won the cup in 1983 with Aberdeen of Scotland and subsequently with Manchester United of England in 1991.|$|E
5|$|The Marlins and Rockies {{used the}} {{expansion}} draft to build <b>their</b> <b>teams</b> using different strategies. As the Rockies had a smaller operating budget than the Marlins, the Rockies targeted prospects with low salaries, while the Marlins selected older players {{intended to provide}} more immediate impact. All three rounds of the draft were televised by ESPN.|$|E
5|$|Training {{camp was}} not {{expected}} to be long if there ended up being a season. Some players organized workouts for <b>their</b> <b>teams</b> to build team chemistry. The NBPA announced it was setting up workout centers in Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Houston and possibly Miami for players to work out at the union's expense.|$|E
5000|$|Uzbekistan {{withdrew from}} the tournament; their replacements, Kyrgyzstan, withdrew too after the plane {{carrying}} <b>their</b> <b>team</b> crashed, killing half of <b>their</b> <b>team.</b>|$|R
5|$|Many of {{the athletes}} competed in several sports because each country {{selected}} <b>their</b> <b>team</b> based on versatility of sporting ability to reduce <b>their</b> <b>team</b> size and costs.|$|R
50|$|The {{candidates}} {{were divided into}} two teams, males versus females. The women named <b>their</b> <b>team</b> A.S.A.P., an acronym for Artists, Singers, Authors, and Professionals for a Purpose. The men named <b>their</b> <b>team</b> Backbone.|$|R
5|$|A {{total of}} 142 riders have been {{qualified}} {{in the event}} at these Games. Most {{of them are not}} expected to finish one-day races, having worked in support for <b>their</b> <b>teams</b> (in this case, nations) to place their riders with better climbing skills in good positions once the mountainous part of a course begins. Many of these riders also sought to conserve themselves for the time trial that was to come. Additionally, if a rider was lapped by the race leader on the Badaling circuit, he would be forced to stop.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 66 cyclists have been {{qualified}} {{in the event}} at these Games. Most {{of them are not}} expected to finish one-day races, having worked in support for <b>their</b> <b>teams</b> (in this case, nations) to place riders with better climbing skills in good positions once the mountainous part of a course begins. Additionally, any rider lapped by the race leader on the Badaling circuit would be forced to stop, although this situation did not occur.|$|E
5|$|Asia League {{was created}} {{primarily}} {{for the development of}} hockey in Asia. The league allows teams to hire a small number of imports to play on the team in order to even out strength as well as increase the level of competitiveness in the league. Playing against more skilled foreign players will allow players from the participating countries to increase their skills and benefit from having some more experienced players on <b>their</b> <b>teams.</b> China is allowed the most imports while the experienced Japanese teams are allowed the fewest. As part of some sponsorship deals China was provided western players from the San Jose Sharks, and the two Chinese teams were provided Swedish players when the Nordic Vikings were active in the league.|$|E
2500|$|Korona supporters' tireless {{cheering for}} <b>their</b> <b>team</b> often helps <b>their</b> <b>team</b> to victories. The most {{faithful}} fans are {{seated in the}} [...] "Młyn" [...] – [...] "the Mill" [...] – which contains 500 – 2,000 people.|$|R
50|$|The club {{announced}} <b>their</b> <b>team</b> on January 9, 2012 at Cape Coral City Hall {{in front}} of the Mayor, City Council, fans and media. They also announced <b>their</b> <b>team</b> logo and summer schedule at the press conference.|$|R
5|$|Arsenal {{announced}} <b>their</b> <b>team</b> {{two days}} before the match, recalling Cliff Holton who had recovered from injury. Blackpool refused to reveal <b>their</b> <b>team</b> until the evening of 12 October, but manager Joe Smith did confirm to the press that Matthews would start.|$|R
5|$|In {{a second}} letter, also dated June 18, Dupasquier and Shorrock {{confirmed}} {{that they would}} not permit <b>their</b> <b>teams</b> to race on the Michelin tyres used during qualification without changes to the circuit, and reiterated their request to slow down Turn 13. Whiting's brief reply maintained that no such change would be permitted, and gave the teams the choice of limiting speeds through Turn 13, using tyres of a different specification to those used in qualifying, subject to a penalty, or changing tyres repeatedly, which would have been permitted if a driver's safety were at issue.|$|E
5|$|Instead of {{operating}} as {{an association of}} independently owned teams, MLS is a single entity in which each team is owned and controlled by the league's investors. The investor-operators control <b>their</b> <b>teams</b> as owners control teams in other leagues, and are commonly (but inaccurately) {{referred to as the}} team's owners. The league has a fixed membership, like most sports leagues in the United States and Canada, which makes it one of the world's few soccer leagues that does not use promotion and relegation, a practice that is uncommon in the two countries. MLS headquarters is located in New York City.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool Data Research Associates (LDRA) {{were called}} in to {{investigate}} allegations of cheating using banned driving aids, such as traction control and launch control, both prohibited {{at the start of}} the year. The top three cars of Michael Schumacher, Nicola Larini and Mika Häkkinen were investigated and <b>their</b> <b>teams</b> were asked to surrender their systems' source code to the company. Larini's team, Ferrari, complied in light of allegations that they were cheating, but Schumacher and Häkkinen's teams, Benetton and McLaren refused, claiming copyright reasons. After being fined $100,000 by the FIA, both teams complied eight days after the race. LDRA discovered that McLaren were running a programme that permitted automatic gearshifts but the car was declared legal.|$|E
50|$|Various gaming {{teams have}} a {{professional}} Warcraft III squad. These squads represent <b>their</b> <b>team</b> in such leagues as the Warcraft 3 Champions League and the NGL One professional league. Players also represent <b>their</b> <b>team</b> in various individual leagues. This {{needs to be}} updated.|$|R

50|$|A full {{international}} since 2005, Zabaleta represented Argentina at the 2011 and 2015 Copa América, and {{was part}} of <b>their</b> <b>team</b> which finished as runners-up in the 2014 FIFA World Cup. He was also in <b>their</b> <b>team</b> which won gold at the 2008 Olympics.|$|R
5|$|Many early Northern sports {{players were}} {{working class and}} needed to miss work to play, with <b>their</b> <b>teams</b> {{compensating}} them for lost wages. By contrast, Southern teams, drawing from the traditions of public schools and Oxbridge, put great emphasis on amateurism and the Southern-dominated governing bodies forbade payments to players. This tension shaped the sports of association football and cricket, {{and led to the}} schism between the two main forms of rugby. The North is also associated with the animal sports of dog racing with whippets, pigeon racing and ferret legging, although these are now far more popular in stereotype than in reality.|$|E
5|$|Many young enforcers need to {{establish}} their role early in their career to avoid losing their jobs. Due to the farm systems that most professional hockey leagues use, enforcers who {{get a chance to}} play at the level above their current one (for example, an AHL player getting a chance to play in an NHL game) need to show other players, coaches, and fans that they are worthy of the enforcer role on the team. Players and coaches enjoy being with enforcers who fight for <b>their</b> <b>teams,</b> not for themselves.|$|E
5|$|Michigan State's NCAA Division I-A program offers 12 varsity {{sports for}} men and 13 for women. Since <b>their</b> <b>teams</b> are called the Spartans, MSU's mascot is a Spartan warrior named Sparty. The {{university}} participates in the Big Ten Conference in all varsity sports, including the new Big Ten hockey conference, featuring 6 teams. The current athletic director is Mark Hollis, who was promoted to the position on January 1, 2008. Hollis replaced Ron Mason, who served as head hockey coach from 1979 to 2002, retiring with a record total of 924 wins, and a 635–270–69 record at MSU.|$|E
50|$|Virus {{was a game}} {{very similar}} to Reversi or Ataxx where four players, two on each team would face off, taking turns with <b>their</b> <b>team</b> mate to outwit the other team. Players could chat privately with <b>their</b> <b>team</b> mate or {{publicly}} with the everyone.|$|R
50|$|Some {{managers}} {{choose to}} act as <b>their</b> <b>team's</b> first base or third base coach while <b>their</b> <b>team</b> is batting in order to more closely communicate with baserunners, but most managers delegate this responsibility to an assistant. Managers are typically assisted by two or more coaches.|$|R
50|$|<b>Their</b> <b>team</b> colours were black, red and yellow.|$|R
5|$|The rules {{had a major}} {{influence}} on how the modern game of football developed. Among other things they introduced into the laws of the game the concepts of corners, throw-ins, and free kicks for fouls. The abolition of the fair catch also led to <b>their</b> <b>teams</b> {{to be the first to}} head the ball. Games played under the rules are also credited with the development of heading and the origins of the goalkeeper and forward positions. The first inter-club football match and competitive tournament were both played using Sheffield Rules.|$|E
5|$|Universities in South Dakota host {{a variety}} of sports programs. For many years, South Dakota {{was one of the}} only states in the country without a NCAA Division I {{football}} or basketball team. However, several years ago SDSU decided to move <b>their</b> <b>teams</b> from Division II to Division I, a move followed by the University of South Dakota. Other universities in the state compete at the NCAA's Division II or III levels, or in the NAIA.|$|E
5|$|As {{professional}} baseball became increasingly profitable, players frequently raised grievances against owners over issues {{of control and}} equitable income distribution. During the major leagues' early decades, players on various teams occasionally attempted strikes, which routinely failed when their jobs were sufficiently threatened. In general, the strict rules of baseball contracts and the reserve clause, which bound players to <b>their</b> <b>teams</b> even when their contracts had ended, tended to keep the players in check. Motivated by dislike for particularly stingy owner Charles Comiskey and gamblers' payoffs, real and promised, members of the Chicago White Sox conspired to throw the 1919 World Series. The Black Sox Scandal {{led to the formation}} of a new National Commission of baseball that drew the two major leagues closer together. The first major league baseball commissioner, Kenesaw Mountain Landis, was elected in 1920. That year also saw the founding of the Negro National League; the first significant Negro league, it would operate until 1931. For part of the 1920s, it was joined by the Eastern Colored League.|$|E

30|$|In {{this present}} study, we {{explored}} how engineering students’ verbal episodes in team settings {{relate to their}} individual achievement as well as <b>their</b> <b>team</b> performances on an engineering design project. In addition, we studied how the distribution of individual team member contributions during teamwork affect <b>their</b> <b>team</b> level success.|$|R
50|$|NHL {{players have}} often grown beards when <b>their</b> <b>team</b> {{is in the}} playoffs, where they do not shave until <b>their</b> <b>team</b> is {{eliminated}} or wins the Stanley Cup. The tradition was started in the 1980s by the New York Islanders, and is often mirrored by the fans, as well.|$|R
5|$|By September 25, 24 {{exhibition}} {{games were}} canceled and training camps were postponed indefinitely {{as a result}} of stalled talks. Further negotiating sessions took place in October and November, but no agreement was reached. The season's first two weeks were officially canceled on October 13, and 99 games scheduled for November were lost as a result. It {{was the first time in}} NBA history that games were canceled due to a labor dispute. On October 20, arbitrator John Feerick ruled that the owners did not have to pay players with guaranteed contracts during the lockout. Feerick's decision gave the owners leverage in bargaining talks. Another factor favoring the owners was that <b>their</b> <b>teams</b> received money from the NBA's television broadcasters, whose contracts with the league called for payments to be made if games were not played.|$|E
5|$|Gameplay in {{relation}} to The Lost Age's battle mode is similar to traditional role-playing video games. In each battle, the player is required to defeat all the enemies using direct attacks with weapons, offensive Psynergy spells, and other means of causing damage, all while keeping their own party alive through items and supportive Psynergy that restore life and supplement defense. If all the player's characters are downed by reducing their hit points to zero, the party is returned to the last village that the player visited and suffers a monetary penalty. The successful completion of a battle yields experience points, coins, and occasionally rare items. In addition to the main game itself, {{there is also a}} competitive battling mode accessible from the menu screen, where players can enter <b>their</b> <b>teams</b> into an arena to battle increasingly difficult CPU-controlled enemies or other players head-to-head.|$|E
5|$|In a {{flashback}} set in Hong Kong, Oliver learns how to torture suspects effectively to obtain information. In the present, Oliver and Roy Harper locate {{the home of}} Digger Harkness, the boomerang-wielding murderer, where they find A.R.G.U.S. operatives looking for him as well. Caitlin Snow and Cisco Ramon arrive in Starling City to help Felicity Smoak investigate Sara Lance's death. Digger attempts to kill Lyla Michaels, Roy, and Oliver, but Barry arrives and stops him. Later, Lyla reveals Digger {{was part of the}} Suicide Squad. When Oliver uses extreme interrogation methods against a Russian mob member in order to locate Digger, Barry questions how emotionally stable Oliver is. Digger locates Oliver's hideout and wounds Lyla before escaping. In order to leave town, Digger plants five bombs around the city. While Oliver captures Digger, Barry uses both of <b>their</b> <b>teams</b> to defuse the bombs simultaneously. Digger is incarcerated on the island with Slade Wilson. Before Barry and his team's departure, he and Oliver decide to have a friendly duel.|$|E
50|$|A holding or {{deep-lying}} midfielder stays {{close to}} <b>their</b> <b>team's</b> defence, while other midfielders may move forward to attack. The holding midfielder {{may also have}} responsibilities when <b>their</b> <b>team</b> has the ball. This player will make mostly short and simple passes to more attacking members of <b>their</b> <b>team</b> but may try some more difficult passes depending on the team's strategy. Marcelo Bielsa is considered as a pioneer {{for the use of}} a holding midfielder in defense. This position may be seen in the 4-2-3-1 and 4-4-2 diamond formations.|$|R

50|$|Following {{their heavy}} {{defeat in the}} first ODI, Sri Lanka made two changes to <b>their</b> <b>team</b> {{enforced}} due to injury. Rangana Herath replaced fellow spinner Ajantha Mendis, while pace bowler Dhammika Prasad was called up {{to play in the}} place of Dilhara Fernando. South Africa made no changes to <b>their</b> <b>team.</b>|$|R
