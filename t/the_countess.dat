The idea is to use their wealth to reopen Castle Ornstein. After an afternoon of chauffeuring the Pleschkes around the countryside, he gets Rudolph, <b>the</b> <b>countess's</b> footman, drunk at the local Biergarten and then run over by a train.

5|$|There are a {{wide variety}} of {{junctions}} on the A303. These range from motorway-style free-flowing junctions such as that with the A36 near Wylye, to simple forks on the single carriageway sections. Some junctions, such as <b>the</b> <b>Countess</b> Roundabout with the A345 near Amesbury, are known congestion hotspots because they are insufficient to cope with traffic.|$|E
5|$|While in Paris, the Doctor and Romana {{sense the}} effects of time distortion. They observe <b>the</b> <b>Countess</b> Scarlioni using an alien device to scan the {{security}} systems housing Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa at the Louvre. The pair meet Inspector Duggan, who suspects <b>the</b> <b>Countess</b> {{to be involved in}} an ongoing art theft scheme with her husband, Count Scarlioni. Duggan joins the Doctor and Romana in investigating the Scarlioni mansion. There, they find equipment used by Dr. Kerensky to experiment in time, the source of the time distortions, as well as six exact copies of the Mona Lisa. The Doctor instructs Romana and Duggan to continue investigating here while he returns to the TARDIS to visit da Vinci, a good friend of his. After the Doctor leaves, the Count returns after successfully stealing the Mona Lisa, and captures Romana and Duggan. Learning that Romana is familiar with time, he kills Dr. Kerensky and forces Romana to continue the tests.|$|E
5|$|Cosima was 24 {{years younger}} than Wagner and was herself illegitimate, the {{daughter}} of <b>the</b> <b>Countess</b> Marie d'Agoult, who had left her husband for Franz Liszt. Liszt initially disapproved of his daughter's involvement with Wagner, though nevertheless {{the two men were}} friends. The indiscreet affair scandalised Munich, and Wagner also fell into disfavour with many leading members of the court, who were suspicious of his influence on the King. In December 1865, Ludwig was finally forced to ask the composer to leave Munich. He apparently also {{toyed with the idea of}} abdicating to follow his hero into exile, but Wagner quickly dissuaded him.|$|E

5|$|Despite the damage, Tyler {{was able}} to move back into his castle, which was now {{protected}} by a small Parliamentary garrison. After investigation by Parliamentary agents Brown and Selden, however, the castle was slighted the following year, which rendered it impossible to defend. <b>The</b> <b>Countess</b> of Kent, the new owner of the castle, was given £1,000 in damages, but chose not to rebuild the fortification as it was by then virtually uninhabitable.|$|E
5|$|During {{his time}} abroad, Cooper stayed with <b>the</b> <b>Countess</b> Dorothy di Frasso at the Villa Madama in Rome, where she taught him about {{good food and}} vintage wines, how to read Italian and French menus, and how to socialize among Europe's nobility and upper classes. After guiding him through the great art museums and {{galleries}} of Italy, she accompanied him on a ten-week big-game hunting safari {{on the slopes of}} Mount Kenya in East Africa, where he was credited with over sixty kills, including two lions, a rhinoceros, and various antelopes. His safari experience in Africa had a profound influence on Cooper and intensified his love of the wilderness. After returning to Europe, he and <b>the</b> <b>countess</b> set off on a Mediterranean cruise of the Italian and French Rivieras. Rested and rejuvenated by his year-long exile, a healthy Cooper returned to Hollywood in April 1932 and negotiated a new contract with Paramount for two films per year, a salary of $4,000 a week, and director and script approval.|$|E
5|$|Edward Martyn was a {{neighbour}} of Lady Gregory, and it {{was during}} a visit to his home, Tullira Castle, in 1896 that she first met W. B. Yeats. Discussions between the three of them, over the following year or so, led to the founding of the Irish Literary Theatre in 1899. Lady Gregory undertook fundraising, and the first programme consisted of Martyn's The Heather Field and Yeats's <b>The</b> <b>Countess</b> Cathleen.|$|E

5|$|John Wesley preached in Shakerley four times, between 1748 and 1752, {{laying the}} {{foundations}} for a place of worship. In the 1780s George Whitfield who worked with Wesley early in his ministry also preached there. Tyldesley's first place of worship, Top Chapel {{was built in the}} Square in 1789 for <b>the</b> <b>Countess</b> of Huntingdon's Connexion which had broken from the Church of England. Thomas Johnson, gifted the site on the highest point of Tyldesley and Lady Huntingdon, a supporter of Wesley supplied money for building materials. The chapel became known as Top Chapel from its geographical location.|$|E
5|$|Lacock Abbey, {{dedicated}} to St Mary and St Bernard, {{was founded in}} 1229 by the widowed Lady Ela <b>the</b> <b>Countess</b> of Salisbury, who laid the abbey's first stone 16 April 1232, in the reign of King Henry III, and to which she retired in 1238. Her late husband had been William Longespee, an illegitimate son of King Henry II. The abbey was founded in Snail's Meadow, {{near the village of}} Lacock. The first of the Augustinian nuns were veiled in 1232.|$|E
5|$|Mary {{was born}} on 18 February 1516 at the Palace of Placentia in Greenwich, London. She was {{the only child of}} King Henry VIII by his first wife, Catherine of Aragon, to survive infancy. Her mother had many miscarriages; before Mary's birth, four {{previous}} pregnancies had resulted in a stillborn daughter and three short-lived or stillborn sons, including Henry, Duke of Cornwall. She was baptised into the Catholic faith at the Church of the Observant Friars in Greenwich three days after her birth. Her godparents included her great-aunt <b>the</b> <b>Countess</b> of Devon, Lord Chancellor Thomas Wolsey, and the Duchess of Norfolk. Henry VIII's cousin once removed, Margaret Pole, Countess of Salisbury, stood sponsor for Mary's confirmation, which was held immediately after the baptism. The following year, Mary became a godmother herself when she was named as one of the sponsors of her cousin Frances Brandon. In 1520, <b>the</b> <b>Countess</b> of Salisbury was appointed Mary's governess. Sir John Hussey, later Lord Hussey, was her chamberlain from 1530, and his wife, Lady Anne, daughter of George Grey, 2nd Earl of Kent, was one of Mary's attendants.|$|E
25|$|It transpires that <b>the</b> <b>Countess's</b> illegitimate son Simon (Claudio Volonté) is the killer. After killing Filippo Donati, {{he is now}} conspiring with Frank Ventura, {{who offers}} Simon a large cash pay-off in {{exchange}} for agreeing to sign the relevant legal documents turning sole ownership of <b>the</b> <b>Countess's</b> estate and property over to Ventura. Their scheme is dealt a potentially ruinous blow when Countess Federica's estranged daughter Renata (Claudine Auger) unexpectedly appears, determined to ensure that her mother's estate comes into her possession. A search for <b>the</b> <b>Countess's</b> will proves unsuccessful, and Ventura, who believes that Renata may be the rightful beneficiary, urges Simon to finish his half-sister off.|$|R

5|$|Penman's {{characterization}} of Simon de Montfort {{is that of}} a man increasingly disillusioned by his sovereign, who rebels in 1263, becomes regent to Henry III, and attempts to reestablish rights granted under the Magna Carta. In addition to the story of Simon de Montfort and his wife, Eleanor <b>the</b> <b>Countess</b> of Pembroke and sister to King Henry III, the novel presents characters such as the Welsh ruler Llywelyn Fawr and London's FitzThomas.|$|E
5|$|She {{also became}} {{the theme of}} {{paintings}} by several artists of the epoch, among them Hyppolyte Bellange, Achille Deveria, Philipp Veit, Francois de Villain and Wojciech Kossak. In 1842, J. K. Salomoński published a short biography of Plater in New York, under the title of Emily Plater, The Polish Heroine; Life of <b>the</b> <b>Countess</b> Emily Plater. A lithograph by F. De Villaine, based on Deveria's work, {{became one of the}} most recognizable portraits of her, popularizing her image as a delicate and noble female warrior.|$|E
5|$|Since Callimachus' poem, Coma Berenices {{has been}} {{occasionally}} mentioned outside astronomy. In 1886, Spanish artist Luis Ricardo Falero created a mezzotint print personifying Coma Berenices alongside Virgo and Leo. In 1892, the Russian poet Afanasy Fet made the constellation {{the subject of}} his short poem, composed for <b>the</b> <b>Countess</b> Natalya Sollogub. Francisco Guerrero, a 20th century composer from Spain, wrote an orchestral work on the constellation in 1996. In 1999 Irish artist Alice Maher made a series of four oversize drawings, entitled Coma Berenices, of entwining black hair coils.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Countess</b> sends Sandor {{to fetch}} her {{a model to}} paint; he returns with Lili (Nan Grey). Countess Zaleska {{initially}} resists her urges but succumbs and attacks her. Lili survives the attack and is examined by Dr. Garth through hypnosis; she reveals enough information to let Dr. Garth {{know that it was}} Countess Zaleska that attacked her, but suffers heart failure and dies. <b>The</b> <b>Countess</b> gives up fighting her urges and accepts that a cure is not possible; she lures Dr. Garth him to Transylvania by kidnapping Janet (Marguerite Churchill), his secretary, whom he has a playfully antagonistic relationship with, but now realizes that he cares for her. Zaleska intends to transform Dr. Garth into a vampire to be her eternal companion. Arriving at Castle Dracula in Transylvania, Dr. Garth agrees to exchange his life for Janet's. Before he can be transformed, Countess Zaleska is destroyed when Sandor shoots her through the heart with an arrow as revenge for her breaking her promise to make him immortal. He takes aim at Dr. Garth but is shot dead by a Scotland Yard policeman who, along with Von Helsing, have followed Dr. Garth from London.|$|E
5|$|The Earl {{returned}} to England in December 1586, but was sent {{again to the}} Netherlands in the following June—to the grief of his wife, as the young Earl of Essex remarked in a letter. Leicester eventually resigned his post in December 1587. <b>The</b> <b>Countess</b> was {{with him when he}} died unexpectedly, possibly of malaria, on 4 September 1588 at Cornbury Park, Oxfordshire; they had been on their way to Kenilworth and Buxton. The Earl's funeral at Warwick in October 1588 was attended by his widow as well as numerous members of her family circle.|$|E
5|$|The executions and attainders of Essex and Blount {{led to a}} {{legal dispute}} over <b>the</b> <b>Countess</b> of Leicester's {{remaining}} property. In this context she claimed that Blount, {{in the process of}} paying off Leicester's debts, had squandered her jewels and much of her landed wealth. The death of ElizabethI in 1603 meant some form of rehabilitation for the Countess; the new monarch, James I, not only restored her grandson, the third Earl of Essex, to his father's title and estate, but quickly cancelled the rest of her debts to the Crown, almost £4,000.|$|E
