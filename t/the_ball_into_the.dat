5|$|Liverpool kicked-off {{the second}} half, and within 13 seconds they had scored {{to lead the}} match 3–0. Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher kicked <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Bayern half, defender Thiam missed his header, which meant the ball dropped to Owen, who {{controlled}} the ball with his right foot and then put <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Bayern goal with his left foot. Bayern reduced the deficit in the 57th minute when Salihamidžić scored. He headed <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Liverpool goal from Bayern's first corner of the match {{to reduce the deficit}} to two goals. Midway through the half both teams made substitutions. Bayern replaced Sforza, Claudio Pizarro and Salihamidžić for Niko Kovač, Carsten Jancker and Roque Santa Cruz respectively. Liverpool substituted Gerrard and Riise for Igor Bišćan and Danny Murphy respectively. Liverpool started to pass the ball around their midfield and defence in an attempt to waste time, however in the 82nd minute Bayern scored again. Substitute Jancker headed into the Liverpool goal from a cross by Elber. Immediately afterwards Bayern had an opportunity to equalise, however Lizarazu's shot was straight at Liverpool goalkeeper Sander Westerveld. No further goals were scored and the referee blew for full-time with the final score 3–2 to Liverpool.|$|E

5000|$|BallBlast: BallBlast is a Scavenger-hunt game type, where players {{fight for}} colored balls, {{in order to}} shoot them into targets.

The game is ended by any player shooting all <b>balls</b> including <b>the</b> golden <b>ball</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> target.

5|$|Minutes later Alavés {{made the}} first {{substitution}} of the match when Iván Alonso replaced defender Dan Eggen. The change had the desired effect as four minutes later, Alavés scored. Right wing-back Cosmin Contra put <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> area form {{the right side of}} the pitch and Alonso rose above Babbel to head <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> net to make the scoreline 2–1.

5|$|Arsenal {{continued}} to dominate possession once {{the second half}} got underway, but struggled {{to use it to}} their advantage. Lauren's cross from the right was cleared away by the United defence and Henry moments later miscued his effort aimed at goal. Moments later Ljungberg beat his marker and crossed <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> penalty area, only for Bergkamp to drag his shot wide. United threatened once the game reached the hour mark, winning duels and earning set-pieces. Gabriel Heinze's shot from about 20 yards tested Arsenal goalkeeper Jens Lehmann in the 65th minute. Five minutes later Wenger substituted Reyes off in place of Pirès.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal {{were drawn}} {{away in the}} third round, against Sheffield United at Bramall Lane. Both teams scored rapidly, with three goals scored {{in the space of}} six minutes.

Buffalo recovered for the fifth time, {{but was unable to}} score, punting to ball back to UConn with 4:37 left in the half. Brown made up for his earlier mistake by breaking off a 75-yard run before being caught from behind. On the next play Tyler Lorenzen ran <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> end zone from 13yards out. Neither team scored {{for the remainder of the}} first half, making the score 20–17 Buffalo going into halftime.|$|E
5|$|He {{played in}} {{all three of the}} group games in the 1990 World Cup in Italy, and England topped Group F, Gascoigne {{providing}} the assist for Mark Wright's winner against Egypt. In the first knockout game against Belgium he made another assist after chipping a free-kick into the penalty area, where David Platt volleyed <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> net. Gascoigne was at the centre of the action again in the quarter-final clash with Cameroon when he gave away a penalty, which Cameroon converted. In extra-time he made a successful through-ball pass from which Gary Lineker won, and subsequently scored a penalty, which proved to be the winning goal.|$|E
5|$|Ideal batting {{conditions}} and clear weather greeted {{the players on}} the second day. After only four overs had been bowled in total the previous afternoon, Edrich was relieved of the new ball, which was given to Barnett, who accompanied Bedser. Both bowlers swung <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> right-handed Barnes and away from the left-handed Morris. Not a frontline bowler, Barnett focused on bowling defensively at medium pace, and the Australians wanted to make a safe start, so they decided to play him watchfully. This prompted some commentators to claim Barnett had allowed the Australians to settle into their rhythm by not trying to pressure them.|$|E

5|$|Less than 30seconds {{after the}} {{subsequent}} kick-off, United forced another corner, but Schmeichel stayed in his penalty area this time under instruction from Ferguson. Beckham again swung the corner in, finding {{the head of}} Sheringham, who nodded the ball down {{across the face of}} goal. Solskjær reacted fastest, shot out a foot and poked <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> roof of the Bayern goal for United to take the lead. The goal was timed at 90+2:17'. Solskjær celebrated by sliding on his knees, mimicking Basler's earlier celebration, before quickly being mobbed by the United players, substitutes and coaching staff. Schmeichel, in his own penalty area, cartwheeled with glee.|$|E
5|$|Lindwall and Johnston {{extracted}} steep bounce {{with the}} new ball, troubling the English batsmen. Fielding in the slips, Lindwall dropped Hutton from Johnston's bowling before the English batsman had scored. Johnston usually moved <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> right-handed batsmen, but on this occasion the ball went straight on and took {{the outside of the}} edge of Hutton's bat. Hutton had trouble with both Australian pacemen, and played and missed multiple times in the deteriorating light. In a fidgety display, he played loosely outside the off stump and missed four times in one Johnston over, before Lindwall dismissed him.|$|E
5|$|McGurk {{retired from}} {{professional}} football in May 2014 {{as a result}} of injury problems, but remained playing as a part-timer after signing for Conference North clin Harrogate Town on 2 June.

5|$|Napoli winger Insigne {{opened the}} scoring in the 11th minute by cutting {{in from the}} left and curling a shot past Fiorentina goalkeeper Neto. He doubled the lead six minutes later by {{connecting}} to Higuaín's cross and forcing a deflection off Nenad Tomović. With two goals in the final, he equalled the amount of goals that he had scored in the entire Serie A season. Fiorentina responded in the 28th minute, when Josip Iličić chipped the defence and Juan Vargas volleyed <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> goal. In the last minute of the half, Alberto Aquilani put the ball into Napoli's goal, but it was disallowed for offside.|$|E
5|$|Queen's went on {{the attack}} once again, with Christie going on a run but losing {{possession}} to Hargreaves. After around 30 minutes of play, Hargreaves passed the ball to his teammate Douglas {{who went on to}} score Rovers' first goal. Queen's Park then committed the second handball of the game, giving Rovers a free kick. Brown took the ball up the wing, and centred it towards Forrest, who turned <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> back of the Queen's Park goal and put Blackburn two ahead. In response, Queen's Park's attacks on the Blackburn defence increased, and they scored through Christie before half time.|$|E
5|$|Since NIU got {{the ball}} to start the game, Kent State got it to start the second half and {{got the ball}} at their own 47 after a 28-yard return by Josh Boyle. Kent State got <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> red zone, but {{ultimately}} settled for a field goal which cut NIU's lead to 4 points. Northern Illinois' prolific offense continued their scoring by executing a 10-play, 75-yard drive highlighted by a 44-yard run by Lynch on a 4th and 1.
