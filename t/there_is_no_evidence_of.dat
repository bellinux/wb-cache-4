5|$|It is {{generally}} believed the house's first owner was Sir William Compton, Groom of the Stool to Henry VIII {{and one of}} the period's prominent courtiers, who acquired the manor of Tottenham in 1514.

5|$|The {{first known}} {{evidence}} {{of people in}} Scarborough comes from an archaeological site in Fenwood Heights, which has been dated to 8000 BCE.

5|$|Alexander Kellner {{suggested}} that the large crests of the pterosaur Tapejara, {{as well as other}} species, might be used for heat exchange, allowing these pterosaurs to absorb or shed heat and regulate body temperature, which also would account for the correlation between crest size and body size. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> extra blood vessels in the crest for this purpose, however, and the large, membranous wings filled with blood vessels would have served that purpose much more effectively.|$|E
5|$|Great white {{pelicans}} {{range over}} a large area of Africa and southern Asia.

Threats include the drainage of wetlands, persecution and sport hunting, disturbance at the breeding colonies, and contamination by pesticides and heavy metals.|$|E
5|$|In 1897 Formby met Martha Maria Salter, a 20-year-old {{music hall}} performer, and {{they married in}} her home town of Halifax in August. Little is known about Salter, {{although}} the 1901 census shows {{that she was still}} living with her parents. The marriage {{does not appear to have}} been successful, but according to Formby's biographers, Sue Smart and Richard Bothway Howard, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> a divorce between the couple and no information relating to when the couple separated.|$|E

5|$|It {{was long}} {{believed}} that ceratopsians like Styracosaurus used their frills and horns in defence against the large predatory dinosaurs of the time. Although pitting, holes, lesions, and other damage on ceratopsid skulls are often attributed to horn damage in combat, a 2006 study {{found no evidence}} for horn thrust injuries causing these forms of damage (for example, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> infection or healing). Instead, non-pathological bone resorption, or unknown bone diseases, are suggested as causes.|$|E
5|$|It {{was while}} Roger was Theobald's clerk {{that he made}} lasting friendships with Gilbert Foliot and Hugh de Puiset. Roger {{attended}} the Council of Reims in 1148 with Theobald, John of Salisbury, and possibly Thomas Becket. This council condemned some of Gilbert de la Porrée's teachings, and consecrated Foliot as Bishop of Hereford. While it was later recalled that Roger and Becket did not get along, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> hatred between the two before the Becket crisis happened.|$|E
5|$|Mitcham Cricket Club {{was formed}} in 1685, the club playing on what is today known as Mitcham Cricket Green. The site has hosted cricket matches ever since. Mitcham is {{believed}} to be the world's oldest cricket club as <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> any club being founded before 1685. Croydon, Dartford and London had all been founded by the 1720s but their dates of origin have been lost, although there was an actual reference to a London Club in 1722.|$|E

25|$|<b>There</b> have <b>been</b> {{few studies}} on the {{psychological}} aspects of BDSM using modern scientific standards. Psychotherapist Charles Moser said <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> for the theory that BDSM has common symptoms or any common psychopathology, emphasizing that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> that BDSM practitioners have any special psychiatric other problems based on their sexual preferences.|$|R
5|$|Mozart did {{not write}} down a cadenza for the movement, or at least <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> him having done so. Many later composers and performers, {{including}} Johannes Brahms, Ferruccio Busoni and Gabriel Fauré, have composed their own. Uniquely among Mozart's concertos, the score does not direct the soloist to end the cadenza with a cadential trill. The omission of the customary trill {{is likely to have}} been deliberate, with Mozart choosing to have the cadenza connect directly to the coda without one.|$|E
5|$|On 19 November, he {{was sworn}} in as a Privy Counsellor. He {{suspended}} his duties temporarily on 5 April 1757, when appointed Chancellor of the Exchequer, due to an old custom that the Lord Chief Justice took the position when it was empty. He only served until 8 April, and <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> his performing anything more than the standard day-to-day duties. He became a cabinet minister in 1757, still serving as Lord Chief Justice, and stayed until 1765.|$|E
5|$|Some Neolithic flint tools {{recovered}} {{from the top of}} the Tor show that the site has been visited, perhaps with lasting occupation, since prehistory. The nearby remains of Glastonbury Lake Village were identified at the site in 1892, which confirmed that there was an Iron Age settlement in about 300–200BC on what was an easily defended island in the fens. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> permanent occupation of the Tor, but finds, including Roman pottery, do suggest that it was visited on a regular basis.|$|E

5|$|South African cave {{sites have}} {{also contributed to}} the data {{regarding}} this shift with accurate dating due to deposits of volcanic ash, which have allowed these sites to be dated to between 999 and 49 thousand years ago.

5|$|The {{garden warbler}} {{has a very}} large range of 9,650,000km2 (3,700,000mi2), and its {{population}} in Europe is estimated at 17–31million breeding pairs. Allowing for birds breeding in Asia, the total population is between 54–124million individuals. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> any serious decline in numbers, so it is classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as being of least concern.|$|E
