Remarkably, for an age <b>that</b> <b>prided</b> <b>itself</b> <b>on</b> a protective attitude for the [...] "weaker sex", the conditions for women prisoners were persistently worse than for men. As early as his 1809 report the Inspector had observed that male prisoners were supplied with iron bedsteads while females 'lay on straw on the flags in the cells and common halls.' Half a century later there was little improvement. The women's section, located in the west wing, remained overcrowded. In an attempt to relieve the overcrowding 30 female cells were added to the Gaol in 1840. These improvements had not been made long before the Great Famine occurred, and Kilmainham was overwhelmed with the increase of prisoners.|$|R

2500|$|While {{the early}} part of Ashoka's reign was {{apparently}} quite bloodthirsty, he became a follower of the Buddha's teachings after his conquest of Kalinga on the east coast of India in the present-day states of Odisha and North Coastal Andhra Pradesh.

From his 13th inscription, we come to know that the battle was a massive one and caused the deaths of more than 100,000 soldiers and many civilians who rose up in defence; over 150,000 were deported.

40|$|Evocative {{computer}} graphic installation {{exploring the}} relation between aesthetic composition and emotive impact. In the context of global migration {{as a consequence of}} war and ecological pressure, the exploration of novel narrative forms capable of eliciting shifts of perspective and empathetic accord has become pivotal to the arts. TAMPA engages with the Howard Government’s refusal to permit the MV Tampa, carrying 438 Afghan refugees, to enter Australian waters in 2001. The four-minute installation combines an original music score with archival audio from the battlefields of Afghanistan, giving a birds-eye view of a violent ocean through a circular, porthole projection. Without falling prey to voyeuristic impulses, TAMPA positions the viewer in a subjective multi-modal environment that transcends the representative visual paradigm, opening up an aesthetically affective space. The installation forms part of the ‘Firewall’ series at William Wright Artists Projects. It explores ‘doors’ {{as a metaphor for the}} dynamic interaction between human and natural worlds. ‘Doors’ occupy a fundamental place in human society, whilst also being central to the natural world. The focus of TAMPA is the interrelationship between human and natural ‘doors’: The oceans surrounding Australia have often been represented as vast impenetrable ‘doors’, keeping human and natural dangers at bay, protecting Australia’s citizens in a safe haven of peace and prosperity. The concurrent narrative of an Australia <b>that</b> <b>prided</b> <b>itself</b> <b>on</b> humanely opening its ‘doors’ to those fleeing persecution amid the wars of the 20 th century was radically ended in 2001, when the MV Tampa was intercepted by the Navy Special Forces to “prevent a foreign ‘invasion’”. The project documents this shift and prototypes a new aesthetically coded form of expression for the interrelationship between politics, memory and trauma. Significance is evidenced by: (a) funding by the ARC; (b) exhibition in leading international art fora...|$|R
40|$|In many respects, the "London whale" scandal at JPMorgan Chase {{is similar}} to other "rogue trading" events, in {{that a group of}} traders took large, {{speculative}} positions in complex derivative securities that went wrong, resulting in over US$ 6 billion of trading losses to the firm. As in other rogue trading cases, there were desperate attempts to cover up the losses until they became too big to ignore and eventually had to be recognized in the financial accounts of the bank. However, the whale case, so-called because of the sheer size of the trading positions involved, differs in several important respects from other rogue trading cases, not least because the sheer size and riskiness of the positions were well-known to many executives within JPMorgan, a firm <b>that</b> <b>prided</b> <b>itself</b> <b>on</b> having advanced risk management capabilities and systems. The role of Model Risk in this scandal, while not the primary cause, is important in that {{at least part of the}} impetus to take huge positions was due to incorrect risk modeling. Various external and internal inquiries into the events have concluded that critical risk management processes in the bank broke down, not only in the Chief Investment Office, the division in which the losses occurred, but across the bank. In particular, deficiencies in the firm's Model Development and Approval processes allowed traders to trade while underestimating the risks that they were running. Under Basel II regulations, losses due to process failure are classified as operational risk losses and hence this case demonstrates a significant failure of operational risk management in JPMorgan. This paper dissects the whale scandal from an operational risk perspective using the late Professor Barry Turner's framework for analyzing organizational disasters. The paper also makes suggestions as to how model risk may be managed to prevent similar losses in future. 42 page(s...|$|R
