2500|$|Andros Island is an {{archipelago}} {{within the}} Bahamas, {{the largest of}} the 26 inhabited Bahamian Islands. Politically considered a single island, Andros in total has an area greater than all the other 700 Bahamian islands combined. The land area of Andros consists of hundreds of small islets and cays connected by mangrove estuaries and tidal swamp lands, together with three major islands: North Andros, Mangrove Cay, and South Andros. The three main islands are separated by [...] "bights", estuaries that <b>trifurcate</b> the island, connecting the island's east and west coasts. It is 104 miles (167km) long by 40 miles (64km) wide, at the widest point.|$|E

40|$|<b>Trifurcating</b> {{coronary}} artery disease is a complex atherosclerotic process involving the origin of one or more of three side branches arising from a left main {{coronary artery}}. With the emergence of drug-eluting stents, interventional cardiologists have become more aggressive in treating this kind of complex diseases, also in patients with an unprotected left main disease. Few series of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) on significant lesions of the left main trifurcations have been described, approached with dissimilar techniques in the best attempt of avoiding life-threatening complications. We therefore describe a case of successful PCI on a left main trifurcation supported by pre-and post-intravascular ultrasound iconography...|$|R
40|$|Background: Abdominal donor-site flaps {{based on}} the deep {{inferior}} epigastric artery (DIEA) {{are the most common}} flaps used in autologous breast reconstruction. With significant variation in the vascular anatomy of the DIEA, preoperative imaging is desirable. Computed tomographic angiography, recently described for this purpose, uniquely demonstrates the branching pattern of the DIEA. The authors sought to correlate the DIEA branching pattern to the location and course of perforators as a preoperative planning tool for perforator flaps. Methods: Forty-five cadaveric hemi–abdominal walls were used for contrast injection of the DIEA with subsequent radiographic imaging. The branching pattern on radiography was thus correlated to the location and intramuscular course of perforators, from the main DIEA trunk to the point of the penetrating rectus sheath. Results: The DIEA branching pattern correlated closely with the course of perforators. A bifurcating (type II) branching pattern demonstrated a reduced transverse distance traversed by each perforator, whereas a <b>trifurcating</b> (type III) branching pattern demonstrated significantly greater transverse distances (p = 0. 0002). Type I vessels were intermediate. Vessel branching type, however, displayed no significant correlation with the number of perforators (p = 0. 56). Conclusions: The distances traversed by perforators were significantly reduced with a bifurcating branching pattern of the DIEA, particularly those originating from the lateral branch, and were greatest with a <b>trifurcating</b> branching pattern. Increased transverse distances correlate with greater rectus muscle sacrificed during perforator flap surgery. As computed tomographic angiography is the optimal modality for demonstrating this pattern preoperatively, the authors suggest its use for preoperative assessment in transverse rectus abdominis musculocutaneous and DIEA perforator flaps. 7 page(s...|$|R

This group of vascular plants are recognisable by their masses of terminal sporangia, which adorn the ends of axes which may bifurcate or <b>trifurcate.</b> Some organisms, such as Psilophyton, bore s. These are small, spiny outgrowths of the stem, lacking their own vascular supply.|$|E
5000|$|The {{shell of}} Peltoceras is evolute with whorls hardly embracing, {{so that all}} whorls are mostly exposed. The outer rim, which {{is known as the}} venter, {{aligning}} with the lower part or belly of the animal, is nearly flat. Inner whorls have strong ribs that bifurcate and <b>trifurcate</b> on the ventral margin.

5000|$|This {{headworks}} {{is located}} {{about a mile}} from the Indian border on the Sutlej River. From here originate three major canals which supply irrigation water to a large area in Southern Punjab and the Bahawalnagar district. The Upper Pakpattan Canal arises from its right bank and two canals arise from the left. The canals on the left bank are Fordwah and Eastern Sadiqia Canal. The later canal runs along the Pakistan-India border. After 46 miles at Jalwala headworks, Eastern Sadiqia Canal <b>trifurcates</b> into Sirajwah distributary, Malik Branch Canal and Hakara Branch Canal. Hakara branch runs in a southwesterly direction for another 75 miles and is at few places it is a few meters from the Indian border.

30|$|The {{sixth and}} last {{feature is the}} {{additional}} branches {{at the level of}} the knee joint. The most important is the articular branch (also called recurrent branch). When exiting the fibular tunnel the peroneal nerve typically <b>trifurcates</b> in the deep and superficial peroneal nerve and a smaller articular branch (Fig.  1). This articular branch provides sensory information from the proximal tibiofibular joint and has been shown to be a very common location and entrance port for intraneural ganglia [13]. In addition to the articular branch, the lateral sural cutaneous nerve and the peroneal communicating branch, a small cutaneous branch that originates from the common peroneal nerve, about 11  mm above the joint line, is also described, and this may explain anecdotal cases of postoperative dysesthesia on the lateral side of the knee [8]. This small branch is too small to discern on conventional MR imaging, unless there is pathological enlargement.|$|R

40|$|Variations in the {{arterial}} {{pattern of}} the upper extremity are numerous and have been documented. Superficially placed arteries in the cubital fossa may be mistaken for cutaneous veins and may lead to intra-arterial injection instead of the intended intra-venous one.

Interestingly, an unusual branch was noted originating from the mid shaft of the left main trunk with a funnel-shaped root and travelling the course of a left atrial (LA) branch (Figures 1 and 2). The left main coronary artery (LMCA) usually bifurcates into two major branches: the left anterior descending (LAD) and left circumflex (LCx) arteries. In some patients, the LMCA <b>trifurcates</b> into the LAD, LCx, and a branch artery named ramus intermedius. This third branch arises between the LAD and LCx arteries.
