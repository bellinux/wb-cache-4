5|$|In 2008, Nauru {{recognised}} Kosovo as {{an independent}} country, and in 2009 Nauru became the fourth country, after Russia, Nicaragua, and Venezuela, to recognise Abkhazia, a breakaway region of Georgia. Russia was reported <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>giving</b> Nauru $50million in humanitarian aid {{as a result of}} this recognition. On 15 July 2008, the Nauruan government announced a port refurbishment programme, financed with US$9million of development aid received from Russia. The Nauru government claims this aid is not related to its recognising Abkhazia and South Ossetia.|$|E
5|$|Jim Martin, {{positioned}} {{in the lower}} right, gives a coy and perhaps mischievous glance back at the viewer. He {{is a microcosm of}} the entire scene in which no one appears <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>giving</b> thanks in a traditional manner of a Thanksgiving dinner. Solomon finds it a departure from previous depictions of Thanksgiving in that the participants do not lower their heads or raise their hands in the traditional poses of prayer. She sees it as an example of treating American traditions in both sanctified and casual ways. Theologian David Brown sees gratitude as implicit in the painting, while Kenneth Bendiner writes that Rockwell was mindful of the Last Supper and that the painting's perspective echoes its rendition by Tintoretto.|$|E

According to the Treaty of Sèvres, all but the Assyrians would have had their wishes honored. Armenia <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>given</b> {{a significant portion of}} the east, known as Wilsonian Armenia, extending as far down as the Lake Van area and as far west as Mush, Greece <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>given</b> Smyrna and the area around it (and likely would have gained Constantinople and all of Thrace, which was administered as internationally controlled and demilitarized territory), Italy <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>given</b> control over the south-central and western coast of Anatolia around Antalya, France <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>given</b> the area of Cilicia, and Britain <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>given</b> all the area south of Armenia.

25|$|By {{this time}} the {{programme}} was benefiting from publicity gained after it became known that Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher was a regular listener. Ministers thus became keen {{to go on the}} programme, but the tough, confrontational interviewing they encountered led to accusations that the BBC was biased. Criticism was particularly directed against Redhead, who was often seen as being on the left. Chancellor Nigel Lawson accused him of having been a Labour voter all his life during a live interview, in 1988. The style of the male interviewers was analysed and contrasted with the approach of MacGregor, who was alleged <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>giving</b> subjects an easier time. The 'Big 8.10' interview that follows the 8 o'clock news had become an important institution of British politics, a position it retains.|$|E
25|$|A {{prelude to}} the 1943 raids came from the De Havilland Mosquito, which hit the capital on 30 January 1943, the tenth anniversary of the Nazis' Machtergreifung. That same day, both Göring and Goebbels were known <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>giving</b> big speeches that were to be {{broadcast}} live by radio. At precisely 11.00am, Mosquitoes of No. 105 Squadron arrived over Berlin exactly on time to disrupt Göring’s speech. Later that day, No. 139 Squadron repeated the trick for Goebbels. These were great propaganda raids which—much as the Doolittle Raid on the Japanese home islands had done for boosting American morale in April 1942—were a severe embarrassment for the German leadership. 20 April 1943 was Hitler's 54th birthday. Bomber Command decided {{that they had to}} mark the occasion with a raid on Berlin, and it was decided that the Mosquito was the right aircraft for the job. Accordingly, No. 105 Squadron was dispatched to the German capital, successfully reaching the city with the loss of only one aircraft.|$|E
25|$|Bangladeshi captain Shakib Al Hasan won the toss {{and elected}} to field on an easy-paced track at the Queens Sports Club, Bulawayo. Bangladesh's opening bowler Syed Rasel got the {{tourists}} {{off to a}} good start dismissing Zimbawean opener Hamilton Masakadza for a duck in the opening over. After five years out of the International game, Mark Vermeulen and number three Chamu Chibhabha, stabilised the innings with a second-wicket partnership of 25 from 37 balls, before Chibhabha was dismissed by Nazmul Hossain for seven. Joining Vermuelan at the crease was Wicket-keeper Brendan Taylor, and with the score on 2-25, looked <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>giving</b> Vermuelan support with 20 from 39 balls. Starting with a flicked boundary, Taylor was unlucky to be given out leg before wicket (lbw) to Shakib—after an inside edge—breaking the innings highest partnership (49). Joined at the crease by Charles Coventry, Vermuelan who was lucky to survive a lbw appeal off Shakib Al Hasan in the 13th over, went on to register his fifth ODI half century from 73 deliveries. Looking to be aggressive, Coventry was caught on the boundary with Mohammad Ashraful's first ball, after scoring 19.|$|E

25|$|Women {{invariably}} grew {{their hair}} long and, {{as in other}} European cultures, this custom was also common among the men. It is said that the Gaelic Irish took great pride in their long hair—for example, a person {{could be forced to}} pay the heavy fine of two cows for shaving a man's head against his will. For women, very long hair was seen as a mark of beauty. Sometimes, wealthy men and women would braid their hair and fasten hollow golden balls to the braids. Another style that was popular among some medieval Gaelic men was the glib (short all over except for a long, thick lock of hair towards the front of the head). A band or ribbon around the forehead was the typical way of holding one's hair in place. For the wealthy, this band was often a thin and flexible band of burnished gold, silver or findruine. When the Anglo-Normans and the English colonized Ireland, hair length came to signify one's allegiance. Irishmen who cut their hair short were deemed to be forsaking their Irish heritage. Likewise, English colonists who grew their hair long at the back were deemed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>giving</b> in to the Irish life.|$|E

500|$|Critical {{response}} to Star Wars Headspace was mixed, holding a weighted mean of a 48 out of 100 {{on the site}} Metacritic based on seven reviews. Drew Mcweeny reviewed it for One Thing I Love Today, his daily column on HitFix which is meant to highlight certain aspects of modern-day popular culture. He honored the compilation's concept of an EDM Star Wars tribute as funny: [...] "I'm not sure how long I'll listen to it, because in the end, it's still {{an hour or so}} of EDM, but it was a delightful soundtrack to a busy weekend, and all of the small surprises built into it should make it something that any Star Wars fan will be able to easily enjoy." [...] A correspondent for The Boston Globe wrote that it was much better than he expected it <b>to</b> <b>be,</b> <b>giving</b> all credit to the producers who contributed to the compilation. Los Angeles Times critic Randall Roberts spotlighted the distinguishing characteristic of each song. [...] Bromwich, who wrote a review for Pitchfork Media, scored the release a 6.9 out of ten, highlighting the record's goal of just being [...] "simple fun" [...] and [...] "Neither [...] stale tribute nor sloppy lovefest". At the same time, however, he also disliked that the nostalgic style was seemingly [...] "a way of avoiding risk".|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from television critics. Jessica Morgan from Television Without Pity awarded the episode a [...] "C–" [...] grade. John Keegan from Critical Myth gave the episode a largely positive review and awarded it an 8 out of 10. He wrote, [...] "Overall, {{this was a}} very enjoyable and balanced episode. It gave us the scares, the humor, and the layered commentary that we had come to expect from the series. With only five episodes to go, it’s the perfect time for 1013 <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>giving</b> the series a good bit of resolution, even if it’s more metaphorical than actual." [...] Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode four stars out of five. The two enjoyed Schnauz's script, calling it [...] "better than most" [...] of season nine's episodes, and noted that he wrote it with [...] "pace and wit". They noted, however, that the entry's self-references [...] "feel like carping [...] at the audience who are still left to complain." [...] Despite this, Shearman and Pearson also positively critiqued several of the episode's juxtapositions, such as the scene featuring Scully performing an autopsy on a cat while wearing a kitchen apron that says [...] "something smells goooood", calling them [...] "the funniest of the season". M.A. Crang, in his book Denying the Truth: Revisiting The X-Files after 9/11, called the episode a [...] "solid little entry", saying that it was a [...] "nice spin on the isolation stories that the series has always done so effectively".|$|E

2500|$|The {{weight of}} a truss member depends {{directly}} on its cross section—that weight partially determines how strong {{the other members of}} the truss need <b>to</b> <b>be.</b> <b>Giving</b> one member a larger cross section than on a previous iteration requires giving other members a larger cross section as well, to hold the greater weight of the first member—one needs to go through another iteration to find exactly how much greater the other members need to be. Sometimes the designer goes through several iterations of the design process to converge on the [...] "right" [...] cross section for each member. On the other hand, reducing the size of one member from the previous iteration merely makes the other members have a larger (and more expensive) safety factor than is technically necessary, but doesn't require another iteration to find a buildable truss.|$|E
