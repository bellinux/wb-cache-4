5|$|Interstate 80 crosses {{through the}} water gap carved by Nescopeck Creek in Nescopeck Mountain. The Susquehanna River Lowlands are in the {{vicinity}} of <b>the</b> <b>ridge.</b> Large groups of small kettle holes are found along the base of <b>the</b> <b>ridge.</b>|$|E
5|$|North from Nethermost Pike is the {{depression}} of Swallow Scarth, above {{the head of}} Nethermost Cove. From here <b>the</b> <b>ridge</b> climbs again, turning to the west as the long plateau of Helvellyn top is reached. Southwards <b>the</b> <b>ridge</b> steps down over High Crag, and narrows as it swings east around Ruthwaite Cove to Dollywaggon Pike. A heavily eroded path runs along <b>the</b> <b>ridge,</b> but actually bypasses the top of Nethermost Pike to the west, as it leads to Helvellyn.|$|E
5|$|The {{failure to}} capture <b>the</b> <b>ridge</b> {{had little effect}} on the overall Allied position, as the success of Operation Cobra was so {{overwhelming}} that the Germans diverted significant resources, including two Panzer divisions, from <b>the</b> <b>ridge</b> in their attempt to keep Bradley's forces boxed in. With its defences weakened, subsequent Commonwealth attacks on <b>the</b> <b>ridge</b> were successful; Operation Totalize finally managed to wrest the position from its SS defenders on 8 August.|$|E
50|$|The shoal {{consists}} of four geologic ridges: <b>the</b> north <b>ridge,</b> <b>the</b> central <b>ridge,</b> <b>the</b> halfway <b>ridge,</b> and <b>the</b> south <b>ridge.</b> <b>The</b> north <b>ridge</b> is a subtle but distinct rise across the northern portion of the shoal; <b>the</b> central <b>ridge</b> {{consists of}} a few high peaks in the eastern-center of the shoal; <b>the</b> halfway <b>ridge</b> is <b>the</b> largest <b>ridge</b> and stretches in an arc {{from east to west}} across the entire feature; <b>the</b> south <b>ridge</b> is made up of two associated basalt rises on the southern edge of the formation. The Isle Royale Fault creates a gorge between <b>the</b> north <b>ridge</b> and <b>the</b> other three <b>ridges.</b>|$|R
50|$|Parting lineation is a {{sedimentary}} structure commonly {{found on the}} surface of parallel-laminated sandstones. It is aligned with the current direction, the alignment holding out in places over several square meters. The lineation is formed by flat, parallel ridges which are separated by depressions or grooves. The height of <b>the</b> <b>ridges</b> rarely exceeds several grain diameters. In profile the depressions are flat-bottomed and <b>the</b> <b>ridges</b> are rounded. Ridges and depressions are arranged en echelon, so that in downstream direction <b>the</b> <b>ridges</b> pass into depressions and vice versa. The crosswise distance between individual ridges typically varies between 0.59 and 1.25 centimeters. Length as well as spacing of <b>the</b> <b>ridges</b> augments with increasing grain size: in fine-grained sands <b>the</b> <b>ridges</b> are 3.5 to 12 centimeters long, whereas in medium-grained sands they can reach 30 centimeters in length. The long dimension of <b>the</b> <b>ridges</b> is therefore 5 to 20 times their crosswise spacing. The coarse(r) sediment fraction accumulates in <b>the</b> <b>ridges,</b> whereas dark heavy minerals and mica trails take up an intermediate position between <b>the</b> <b>ridges</b> and <b>the</b> grooves.|$|R
5000|$|For {{efficient}} ridged mirrors, both estimates above should predict high reflectivity. This implies {{reduction of}} both, width, [...] of <b>the</b> <b>ridges</b> and <b>the</b> period, [...] The width of <b>the</b> <b>ridges</b> cannot be {{smaller than the}} size of an atom; this sets the limit of performance of <b>the</b> <b>ridged</b> mirrors.|$|R

5|$|A {{portion of}} the Pennsylvania State Game Lands Number 58 is on Nescopeck Mountain. Additionally, the Pennsylvania State Game Lands Number 187 contain the Nescopeck Mountain Barrens. <b>The</b> <b>ridge</b> is on the {{northern}} border of the 3550-acre Nescopeck State Park. Historically, there were trails {{leading up to the}} top of Nescopeck Mountain. There is high visibility from the top of <b>the</b> <b>ridge</b> and the town of Bloomsburg can be seen.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternate}} route between Los Angeles and Bakersfield followed the southern approach to <b>the</b> <b>Ridge</b> Route to Saugus, but took a longer route between Saugus and Gorman, heading northeast through the San Francisquito Canyon to the Antelope Valley and west to Gorman. The {{rest of the}} route, from Gorman toward Bakersfield via the Tejon Pass, followed the same path as <b>the</b> <b>Ridge</b> Route.|$|E
60|$|It may {{be asked}} why ridges are {{followed}} and not furrows, the furrow being the real boundary between two systems. The reply is, that <b>the</b> <b>ridges</b> are <b>the</b> easiest to trace; and, as the error through following <b>the</b> <b>ridges</b> cannot exceed one-half of a ridge-interval, I have been content to disregard it. I began by tracing furrows, but preferred <b>the</b> <b>ridges</b> after trial.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>ridged</b> plains unit are lava plains {{deformed}} by ridges. They have {{a smooth}} surface with relatively higher elevation than <b>the</b> surroundings. <b>The</b> <b>ridges</b> are usually symmetrical in cross-section and collected into prominent belts.|$|R
50|$|Atwell Peak {{consists}} of three <b>ridges,</b> <b>the</b> north, east, and south. <b>The</b> east <b>ridge</b> connects with <b>the</b> north <b>ridge</b> about 100 horizontal metres north of <b>the</b> summit. All <b>ridges,</b> with <b>the</b> possible exception of <b>the</b> upper east <b>ridge,</b> are sharp and heavily corniced in winter and spring. <b>The</b> north <b>ridge</b> is <b>the</b> shortest climbing route. Several gullies on the southeast face offer moderate routes that eventually join one of <b>the</b> three <b>ridges.</b> <b>The</b> northeast face is the shortest of the peak's faces but has many bergschrunds.|$|R

5|$|Historically, {{there was}} a Native American village in the {{vicinity}} of Nescopeck Mountain, where the borough of Nescopeck is in modern times. Additionally, the Forks Indians arrived at <b>the</b> <b>ridge</b> in 1740 after being evicted from their lands in the Lehigh Valley. As early as 1755, a pair of Moravian missionaries, Christian Seidel and Henry Frey, descended <b>the</b> <b>ridge</b> while visiting Native Americans.|$|E
5|$|In {{an effort}} to improve the Australian line of {{communications}} in the sector, engineers from the 16th Field Company later constructed a road using a bulldozer that had to haul itself up <b>the</b> <b>ridge</b> via a steel cable that was manhandled {{up to a point}} just below <b>the</b> <b>ridge</b> over the course of eight days. A light rail system was also established between Barges' Hill and Pearl Ridge.|$|E
50|$|The {{southern}} enclosure of this basin {{is formed}} by <b>the</b> Central Indian <b>Ridge,</b> <b>the</b> Carlsberg <b>Ridge</b> and <b>the</b> Chagos-Laccadive <b>Ridge.</b> Bottom water enters the basin through the Owen Fracture Zone to the west. <b>The</b> Carlsberg <b>Ridge,</b> {{at a depth}} of 3,800 m, separates this basin from the Somali Basin to the southwest. The Arabian Basin is separated from the shallow Oman Basin by <b>the</b> Murray <b>Ridge.</b> Most of <b>the</b> northern and eastern limits are formed by <b>the</b> Laxmi <b>Ridge</b> and <b>the</b> Laccadive Plateau.|$|R
50|$|The {{site has}} six {{concentric}} earthworks separated by ditches, or swales, where dirt was removed to build <b>the</b> <b>ridges.</b> <b>The</b> ends of <b>the</b> outermost <b>ridge</b> are 1204 m apart, which is nearly 3/4 of a mile. The {{ends of the}} interior embankment are 594 m apart. If <b>the</b> <b>ridges</b> were straightened and laid end to end, they would compose an embankment of 12 km long. Originally, <b>the</b> <b>ridges</b> stood 4 ft to 6 ft high and 140 ft to 200 ft apart. Many years of plowing have reduced some to only 1 ft in height. Archeologists believe that the homes of 500 to 1,000 inhabitants were located on these ridges.|$|R
5000|$|Gray Wolf Mountain, at 7218 {{feet above}} sea level, is <b>the</b> <b>ridge's</b> highest summit. It was first climbed by Leigh B. Lint in 1928. [...] Other {{distinct}} peaks include '7076' (7076), Baldy (6797), Tyler Peak (6364), and Maynard Peak (5065), which forms the northeastern terminus of Gray Wolf Ridge. Gray Wolf River runs through the valley-bottom to <b>the</b> <b>Ridge's</b> north; Royal Creek and the Dungeness River flow through the valley along <b>the</b> <b>Ridge's</b> east and south.|$|R
5|$|Kohala had two active rift zones, a {{characteristic}} common to Hawaiian volcanoes. The double ridge, shaped axially, {{was active in}} both the shield and postshield stages. The southeast rift zone passes under the nearby Mauna Kea and reappears further southeast in the Hilo Ridge, {{as indicated by the}} relationship between collected lava samples. In addition, the two features align to one another more closely then does <b>the</b> <b>ridge</b> to Mauna Kea, of which it was once thought to constitute a part. The bulk of <b>the</b> <b>ridge</b> is built of volcanic rock with reverse magnetic polarity, evidence that the volcano is at least 780,000years old. Older lava dated from the toe of <b>the</b> <b>ridge</b> was estimated to be roughly between 1.1 and 1.2million years old.|$|E

30|$|The {{reason for}} the {{differences}} between the cases, i.e., with and without secondary etching, was related to the annealing process at high temperatures. For the case without secondary etching, the surface diffusion of catalyst particles was limited by the layer of redeposited material at <b>the</b> <b>ridges.</b> <b>The</b> catalyst particles agglomerated in the area before <b>the</b> <b>ridges,</b> which became a barrier for further catalyst surface diffusion to the area outside <b>the</b> <b>ridges,</b> resulting in a higher area density of the particles, allowing the growth of CNTs on the edges.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> four <b>ridges</b> {{encompass}} {{almost exactly}} the four cardinal directions. <b>The</b> west <b>ridge</b> is named Arête de Ferpècle and <b>the</b> east <b>ridge</b> is named Arête des Quatre Ânes.

5|$|Responding to the Japanese {{capture of}} part of the ridgeline, Major Odell M. Conoley—Hanneken's {{battalion}} executive officer—quickly gathered a counterattack unit of 17 men, including communications specialists, messmen, a cook, and a bandsman. Conoley's scratch force was joined by elements of Hanneken's Company G, Company C, and a few unwounded survivors from Company F and attacked the Japanese before they could consolidate their positions on top of <b>the</b> <b>ridge.</b> By 06:00, Conoley's force had pushed the Japanese back off <b>the</b> <b>ridge,</b> effectively ending Oka's attack. The Marines counted 98 Japanese bodies on <b>the</b> <b>ridge</b> and 200 more in the ravine in front of it. Hanneken's unit suffered 14 killed and 32 wounded.|$|E

5|$|The Battle of Pearl Ridge (30–31 December 1944) was an {{engagement}} of the Second World War fought between Australian and Japanese forces on Bougainville Island. Part {{of the wider}} Bougainville Campaign, the battle {{took place in the}} central sector of the island, shortly after the Australians had taken over responsibility from the Americans. Believing that <b>the</b> <b>ridge</b> was held by less than a company of Japanese, on 30 December the Australian 25th Infantry Battalion launched a four-pronged attacked <b>the</b> <b>ridge.</b> The defending force, however, had been greatly reinforced by elements of the 38th Independent Mixed Brigade and was closer to a battalion in strength. After being held up on the right of their advance, the Australians dug-in overnight and repulsed a strong Japanese counterattack before resuming the attack on 31 December. By late in the afternoon, the Japanese had been swept off <b>the</b> <b>ridge.</b> The Australians later established an observation post on <b>the</b> <b>ridge,</b> which had commanding views of the whole island, and throughout the remainder of the campaign used it to control artillery fire as they advanced towards Japanese enclaves in the north and south of the island.|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} problem of {{estimating}} <b>the</b> <b>ridges</b> of a density function. Ridge estimation {{is an extension of}} mode finding and is useful for understanding the structure of a density. It {{can also be used to}} find hidden structure in point cloud data. We show that, under mild regularity conditions, <b>the</b> <b>ridges</b> of <b>the</b> kernel density estimator consistently estimate <b>the</b> <b>ridges</b> of <b>the</b> true density. When the data are noisy measurements of a manifold, we show that <b>the</b> <b>ridges</b> are close and topologically similar to the hidden manifold. To find <b>the</b> estimated <b>ridges</b> in practice, we adapt the modified mean-shift algorithm proposed by Ozertem and Erdogmus [J. Mach. Learn. Res. 12 (2011) 1249 - 1286]. Some numerical experiments verify that the algorithm is accurate. Comment: Published in at [URL] the Annals of Statistics ([URL] by the Institute of Mathematical Statistics ([URL]...|$|R
60|$|The embryological {{development}} of <b>the</b> <b>ridges</b> {{has been studied}} by many, but more especially by Dr. A.

5|$|The {{immediate}} Allied {{objective was}} Verrières Ridge, a belt of high ground which dominates the route from Caen to Falaise. <b>The</b> <b>ridge</b> was invested by battle-hardened German veterans, {{who had fallen}} back from Caen and entrenched to form a strong defensive position. Over the course of six days, substantial Canadian and British forces made repeated attempts to capture <b>the</b> <b>ridge.</b> Strict German adherence to defensive doctrine, as well as strong and effective counterattacks by Panzer formations, resulted in heavy Allied casualties for little strategic gain.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>ridge</b> {{fell under}} German control in October 1914, during the Race to the Sea, as the Franco-British and German forces {{continually}} attempted to outflank {{each other through}} northeastern France. The French Tenth Army attempted to dislodge the Germans from the region during the Second Battle of Artois in May 1915 by attacking their positions at Vimy Ridge and Notre Dame de Lorette. During the attack, the French 1st Moroccan Division briefly captured the height of <b>the</b> <b>ridge,</b> where the Vimy memorial is currently located, {{but was unable to}} hold it owing to a lack of reinforcements. The French made another attempt during the Third Battle of Artois in September 1915, but were once again unsuccessful in capturing the top of <b>the</b> <b>ridge.</b> The French suffered approximately 150,000 casualties in their attempts to gain control of Vimy Ridge and surrounding territory.|$|E
