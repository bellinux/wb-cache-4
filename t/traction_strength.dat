40|$|A evolução tecnológica de concretos refratários tem tornado mais difícil a etapa de secagem devido a redução da sua permeabilidade e conseqüente aumento da dificuldade para que o vapor de água migre do {{interior}} do corpo para a superfície. A hidratação do cimento de aluminato de cálcio também causa decréscimo da permeabilidade dos concretos. Tal processo é significativamente afetado pela presença de aditivos utilizados para a dispersão do concreto. Neste contexto, este trabalho teve como objetivo relacionar o tipo de aditivo utilizado no processamento de concretos refratários com seu comportamento de secagem e resistência à tração. Foi verificado que os aditivos não atuam somente na dispersão das partículas da matriz e ligante, mas o efeito da sua atuação pode influenciar no tipo de hidrato formado. O aditivo CS se mostrou um eficiente dispersante promovendo a redução no consumo de água. Isso acarretou na formação preferencial dos hidratos C 3 AH 6 disponibilizando mais alumina para a formação de AH 3. Essa fase apresenta alta capacidade de preencher vazios interparticulas contribuindo para aumentar a resistência à tração do material. Por outro lado, o aditivo AC desfavoreceu a formação desses tipos de hidratos uma vez que atua como retardador da hidratação do cimento por meio do consumo de íons cálcio. Também a presença de um maior teor de água nos concretos preparados com este aditivo pode explicar o aumento da porosidade e decréscimo da resistência à tração do concreto. The growing technology {{applied in}} the refractory castables production has become more difficult the drying process due the reduction of their permeability and the consequent increasing difficult of vapor migration from the inner region {{of the body to}} the surface. The hydration of calcium aluminate cement is also responsible for the castables permeability reduction. This process is significatively affected by the presence of additives used to disperse the castables. In this context, the objective of this work was to evaluate the influence of the different kind of additives on the drying behavior and <b>traction</b> <b>strength</b> of castables. It was verified that additives not only influence in the dispersion of matrix and binder particles but also in the type resulting hydrate. The additive CS favored the dispersion of castable and decreased water consumption resulting in the main formation of hydrates C 3 AH 6 and AH 3. The formation of AH 3 is particularly favored by precipitation of C 3 AH 6 due to alumina content available to its formation to be larger. This phase appears frequently as gel and due its high capacity to fill interparticle voids can be correlated to the <b>traction</b> <b>strength</b> development.

40|$|The cyclic {{laws for}} dynamic {{analyses}} of reinforced concrete (RC) structures usually neglect the concrete <b>traction</b> <b>strength</b> and the re-loading branch from traction to compression. These assumptions {{may lead to}} unreal results in cyclic or dynamics analyses. For example, flag-shaped moment-curvature diagrams of slender RC walls are presented. For this reason, the behaviour of concrete in cyclic tension, determined by Reinhardt et al. (1986, 1989) and modified by Ferracuti and Savoia (2005), is added to an existing cyclic stress-strain law. Making use of the finite element (FE) software OpenSees, the resulting concrete law is firstly validated by simulating experimental tests on RC cantilever beams cyclically loaded. Then, slender RC walls in multi-storey buildings are considered and dynamic analyses are done. Moment-curvature curves at base sections are obtained, together with force and displacement envelopes. The results obtained with the implemented law are compared against the ones obtained with a common law.

40|$|The {{case study}} is the {{pentagonal}} tower from Serravalle Castle fortification, located near to the river Temo (west-cost of Sardinia), above the medieval Bosa village (XII-XIV cent.). The castle belongs to the medieval Giudicato di Torres (X cent.) and then to Malaspina from Lunigiana (XII cent.), Turrritani, Arborea, Aragonese, until to the Catalans (from Alghero) that led it to decline (XVI cent.). The aim of this proposal is to analyze from mineralogical-petrographic point of view the mortars used {{in the construction of}} the tower. Samples were taken between the volcanic ashlars at different heights with respect to the ground level, to assess any compositional variations during the construction of the building. Through microscopic analysis, the compositional aspects concerning the nature and petro-mineralogical features of the raw materials used for the aggregate were defined. By image analysis (on meso-microscopic photographs) the vol. % of binder/aggregate ratios and their grain-size characteristics were determined and compared with the wt% data obtained from disaggregation method of mortars and acid attack of carbonate binder, in order to understand if the mixing ratios used by constructors have respected the production standards of those historic period.

MÉTODOS: Foram construídos 48 corpos de provas, distribuídos em seis grupos com oito corpos cada. A resistência à tração foi testada nos grupos 1, 2 e 3 utilizando-se uma máquina de tração de fabricação ITM®. Para verificar a resistência à flexão, nos grupos 4, 5 e 6, foram usados um perfurador de bancada, marca Cardoso® FFC- 20 na instalação do pino e, em seguida, a máquina {{universal}} de ensaios ZD 100 PU. RESULTADOS: Nos testes de tração os pinos cônicos suportaram a tração média de 98, 462 kgf; os de rosca uniforme longa (40 mm), 283, 70 kgf; e os pinos propostos com rosca uniforme de 15 mm, a força média de 116, 947 kgf. A diferença estatística não foi significante entre os grupos. Nos testes de flexão, os pinos cônicos resistiram à força de 6, 563 kgf; os pinos com rosca uniforme de 40 mm, à força média de 6, 177 kgf; e os pinos propostos, à força média de 30, 275 kgf, existindo diferença significativa com os grupos anteriores. CONCLUSÕES: Os três modelos de pinos de Schanz apresentaram resistência equivalente à tração e o modelo proposto - comprimento de rosca de 15 mm - é significativamente mais resistente às forças de flexão.

Histological analysis of the L group showed a decrease in the number of inflammatory cells in relation to other groups in both periods studied. the comparative results between the number of inflammatory cells in the control and treated groups at 7 and 14 days showed statistically significant differences. Qualitative analysis findings obtained by the picrosirius red technique under polarized light showed that in 7 days, the T group presented collagen types I and III in the same proportion; group D presented a predominance of type III fibers, while in group L, type I collagen predominated. the 14 -day group D showed collagen types I and III in the same proportion, while in group L, there was a predominance of type I fibers. Biomechanical analysis showed that 7 -day groups L and C showed similar stiffness and increased breaking strength. the 14 -day groups L and C showed greater rupturing strength as well as increased stiffness angle. Group D showed a decrease of maximum <b>traction</b> <b>strength</b> and degree of rigidity.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to contribute to the knowledge on ice-ridges structures interactions. This work is a follow-up of previous research on simulations of ice-structure interaction using finite element method (Gürtner, 2009 b; Konuk, et al., 2009 a,b) and a preliminary study of freeze-bond (FB) shear strength (Repetto-Llamazares, et al., 2009 b). The presented data should be regarded as illustrative rather than exhaustive. Many important aspects of ice-ridges structures interactions have not been addressed in this thesis. An analysis of experiments with FBs was performed, and a finite element model was built in order to simulate these experiments. Within the framework of the classical theory of elasticity, the numerical model incorporates a cohesive model in order to simulate ice fracture along the FB during shear test. The cohesive behavior of the FB was described by the bilinear traction-separation law. The approach of Camanho and Davila (2002) was applied in order to calculate stresses in the FB under mixed-mode loading conditions. A 6 -node cohesive finite element was used for implementation of assumed behavior of the FB. Information obtained via detailed analysis of the FB shear strength experiments and via their numerical simulation can be used for a better understanding of FB failure processes and for a numerical modeling of ice-ridges. The results of numerical simulation confirmed that the finite element model could reproduce phenomena commonly observed in actual shear tests of FBs, including the shear strength hardening and partly softening behavior. The peak load in simulations was completely determined by the maximum <b>traction</b> <b>strength</b> and the initial part of a traction-separation law. This study also showed that from the conducted experiments intended to study FB strength in model ice, it is also possible to study ice fracture processes as well as post-failure behavior. By improving the experimental procedure as described in Repetto-Llamazares, et al. (2009 b) it will be possible to study not only FB shear strength but also the frictional behavior of ice after the FB failure. By video monitoring of the crack initiation and growth it will be possible to study a fracture process inside the FB. This work is of appeal to different scientists actively participating in investigations in, and possibly also on the standardization of methods for, measuring strength of freeze-bonds in order to improve existing analytical and numerical models, which are used nowadays for calculation of loads for scenarios of ice-ridges interactions with structures.

40|$|Abstract. Sutures and {{cyanoacrylate}} {{high strength}} tissue adhesives {{are commonly used}} for wound closure in several surgical applications. Although effective for closing simple and small incisions, cyanoacrylate adhesives were limited by compromising adhesion and stiffness, i. e. cyanoacrylates with short alkyl chain length showed higher adhesion but lower flexibility than the ones with long alkyl chain length. In this paper, a new concept of flexible and high strength tissue cyanoacrylate based adhesive- Adhflex®- is presented. The balance between adhesion and flexibility in Adhflex® was achieved by adding an inert (i. e. non-reactive) chemical to a short alkyl chain length cyanoacrylate able to partially inhibit its polymerization in presence of moisture. Adhesion properties of Adhflex ® were superior as compared to other commercial cyanoacrylate tissue adhesives (i. e. higher <b>traction</b> and shear <b>strength).</b> Furthermore, Adhflex ® has been successfully used in a clinical trial for inguinal hernia repair (case study) as the surgery time with respect to suturing was reduced substantially, {{the comfort of the}} patient was improved (i. e. reduced tension after surgery, reduced allergic reaction) and the scare was minimal...|$|R
