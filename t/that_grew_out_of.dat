5|$|The first farming {{people to}} settle {{in the region are}} {{associated}} with the Neolithic Starčevo culture, which flourished between 6200 and 5200 BC. There are several Starčevo sites in and around Belgrade, including the eponymous site of Starčevo. The Starčevo culture was succeeded by the Vinča culture (5500–4500 BC), a more sophisticated farming culture <b>that</b> <b>grew</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the earlier Starčevo settlements which is also named for a site in the Belgrade region (Vinča-Belo Brdo). The Vinča culture is known for its very large settlements, one of the earliest settlements by continuous habitation and some of the largest in prehistoric Europe; anthropomorphic figurines such as the Lady of Vinča; the earliest known copper metallurgy in Europe; a proto-writing form developed prior to the Sumerians and Minoans, known as the Old European script, dating back to around 5300 BC.|$|E
5|$|The Whig Party {{was also}} divided in Kentucky, not only between Clay and Taylor, but between gubernatorial candidates. William J. Graves, out of {{politics}} since his fatal shooting of Representative Cilley, had the backing of sitting Whig governor William Owsley, while Archibald Dixon had secured support from former Whig governor Robert P. Letcher. Letcher wrote to Crittenden that a Whig split and Democratic victory in the gubernatorial election would have an injurious effect on Whig hopes of carrying Kentucky in the 1848 presidential election; another former Whig governor, Thomas Metcalfe, concurred. At the Whig nominating convention, both Graves and Dixon withdrew their names and a delegate from Logan County put forward Crittenden's name without his consent. The nomination easily carried before Crittenden's friends could block it. The governorship was less prestigious and paid less than Crittenden's position in the Senate. He {{would also have to}} abandon his growing legal practice before the Supreme Court and would lose input on national issues of importance to him such as the territorial questions <b>that</b> <b>grew</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the Mexican War. Nevertheless, he believed that his candidacy would unite the Whigs and help Taylor win Kentucky's electoral votes in the general election. He accepted the nomination a week after it was made.|$|E

25|$|The {{religion}} of ancient Greece {{was a form}} of nature worship <b>that</b> <b>grew</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the beliefs of earlier cultures. However, unlike earlier cultures, man was no longer perceived as being threatened by nature, but as its sublime product. The natural elements were personified as gods of completely human form, and very human behaviour.|$|E

25|$|Colonial empires {{were the}} product of the European Age of Discovery from the 15th century. The initial impulse behind these {{dispersed}} maritime empires and those that followed was trade, driven by the new ideas and the capitalism <b>that</b> <b>grew</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the Renaissance. Both the Portuguese Empire and Spanish Empire quickly grew into the first global political and economic systems with territories spread around the world.|$|E

25|$|Jack Bush was a Canadian {{abstract}} expressionist painter, born in Toronto, Ontario in 1909. He was {{a member}} of Painters Eleven, the group founded by William Ronald in 1954 to promote abstract painting in Canada, and was soon encouraged in his art by the American art critic Clement Greenberg. With encouragement from Greenberg, Bush became closely tied to two movements <b>that</b> <b>grew</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the efforts of the abstract expressionists: Color Field Painting and Lyrical Abstraction. His painting Big A is an example of his color field paintings of the late 1960s.|$|E
25|$|In 1842, Newell {{helped to}} {{establish}} the Oregon Lyceum at Oregon City, Oregon. He would later become {{the director of the}} Oregon Printing Association <b>that</b> <b>grew</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the Lyceum and started the first newspaper west of the Rocky Mountains, the Oregon Spectator. At the May 2, 1843, settler meeting Newell voted in favor of creating a provisional government in the region. The vote passed 52 to 50 and a Provisional Legislature was created. Newell served in that body from 1843 until it was replaced with the Oregon Territorial Legislature in 1849, although he resigned during the final session. During the 1847 meeting of the group, Newell served as Speaker of the body.|$|E
25|$|Political power congealed {{around the}} 13 cantons (Bern, Zürich, Zug, Glarus, Uri, Schwyz, Unterwalden, Fribourg, Solothurn, Basel, Luzern, Schaffhausen, Appenzell) {{of the old}} confederation. During this era, the patrician {{families}} decreased in number but increased in power. Some patrician families were drawn from leadership in the guilds or trading groups within the town, while other families grew from successful mercenary captains and soldiers. The trend toward increasing authoritarianism conflicted {{with the history of}} public expression <b>that</b> <b>grew</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the Swiss Reformation. In many regions the patrician families were unable to suppress the public assemblies, but they did dominate the assemblies. The tradition of inviting the people to express their opinions died out mostly during this era.|$|E

25|$|The {{neighborhood}} has become home to numerous contemporary art galleries. One {{of the very}} first was ABC No Rio. Begun by a group of Colab no wave artists (some living on Ludlow Street), ABC No Rio opened an outsider gallery space that invited community participation and encouraged the widespread production of art. Taking an activist approach to art <b>that</b> <b>grew</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> The Real Estate Show (the take over of an abandoned building by artists to open an outsider gallery only to have it chained closed by the police) ABC No Rio kept its sense of activism, community, and outsiderness. The product of this open, expansive approach to art was a space for creating new works that did not have links to the art market place and that were able to explore new artistic possibilities.|$|E
25|$|Maaseh Merkabah (Working of the Chariot) is {{the modern}} name {{given to a}} Hekhalot text, {{discovered}} by scholar Gershom Scholem. Works of the Chariot dates from late Hellenistic period, {{after the end of}} the Second Temple period following the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE when the physical cult ceased to function. The idea of making a journey to the heavenly hekhal seems to be a kind of spiritualization of the pilgrimages to the earthly hekhal that were now no longer possible. It is a form of pre-Kabbalah Jewish mysticism that teaches both of the possibility of making a sublime journey to God and of the ability of man to draw down divine powers to earth; it seems to have been an esoteric movement <b>that</b> <b>grew</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the priestly mysticism already evident in the Dead Sea Scrolls and some apocalyptic writings (see the studies by Rachel Elior).|$|E
25|$|Some years later, after Easton became President of the American Political Science Association, he led {{the charge}} of a new post-behavioralist revolution, arguing that {{political}} science research should be both relevant and action-oriented, so it might better {{serve the needs of}} society by solving social and political problems revealed during the 1960s. This new revolution was not a change in the methods of inquiry but a change in orientation <b>that</b> <b>grew</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> a deep discontent with the direction of contemporary political research and which advocated more attention to the public responsibilities of the discipline and to relevant research on contemporary political problems and issues. According to John Gunnell, this was the official birth announcement of the public policy enterprise in political science which became the basis of the self-image of orthodox political science in the 1970s. With this shift came a distinct de-emphasis of concern for establishing a general unified theory as the core of the discipline, and a retreat from any pointed confrontation with the history of political theory.|$|E

25|$|The {{first episode}} was {{broadcast}} on 28 May 1951 on the BBC Home Service. Although {{he did not}} perform {{as much in the}} early shows, Milligan eventually became a lead performer in almost all of the Goon Show episodes, portraying a wide range of characters including Eccles, Minnie Bannister, Jim Spriggs and the nefarious Count Moriarty. He was also the primary author of most of the scripts, although he co-wrote many scripts with various collaborators, most notably Larry Stephens and Eric Sykes. Most of the early shows were co-written with Stephens (and edited by Jimmy Grafton) but this partnership faltered after Series 3. Milligan wrote most of Series 4 but from Series 5 (coinciding with the birth of the Milligans' second child, Seán) and through most of Series 6, he collaborated with Eric Sykes, a development <b>that</b> <b>grew</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> his contemporary business collaboration with Sykes in Associated London Scripts. Milligan and Stephens reunited during Series 6 but towards the end of Series 8 Stephens was sidelined by health problems and Milligan worked briefly with John Antrobus. The Milligan-Stephens partnership was finally ended by Stephens' death from a brain haemorrhage in January 1959; Milligan later downplayed and disparaged Stephens' contributions.|$|E
