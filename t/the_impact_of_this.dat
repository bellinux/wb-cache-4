5|$|Twenty-two {{people lost}} their lives in {{accidents}} caused by Cyclone Rewa, while it affected parts off the Solomon Islands, Papua New Guinea, Australia, New Caledonia, Vanuatu and New Zealand. Due to <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> storm, the name Rewa was retired.|$|E
5|$|A direct {{consequence}} of the invasion was the almost total elimination of the old English aristocracy {{and the loss of}} English control over the Catholic Church in England. William systematically dispossessed English landowners and conferred their property on his continental followers. The Domesday Book meticulously documents <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> colossal programme of expropriation, revealing that by 1086 only about 5 per cent of land in England south of the Tees was left in English hands. Even this tiny residue was further diminished in the decades that followed, the elimination of native landholding being most complete in southern parts of the country.|$|E
5|$|Several islands {{within the}} Solomon Islands {{reported}} extensive property and crop damage. Within Vanautu, Anne brought heavy rains, flooding, and a storm surge. These effects damaged houses, crops, and property, especially on Ureparapara islands and the Torres Islands. Extensive damage {{was reported in}} New Caledonia after it was exposed to a prolonged period of storm force winds, with the eastern and southern coasts particularly affected. On January12, the system produced the highest daily rainfall totals since 1951 in several areas. Two people were killed after they attempted to cross a flooded river, and about 80others were injured by the cyclone. Due to <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> storm, the name Anne was retired.|$|E
40|$|As {{the largest}} market and {{importer}} of fisheries products, the European Union (EU) has adopted an ambitious Regulation on Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated (IUU) Fishing. This regulation not only {{applies to the}} maritime waters under the jurisdiction or sovereignty of the Member States, but also imposes strict controls on IUU fishing {{on the high seas}} and in maritime waters under the jurisdiction or sovereignty of other coastal states. Therefore, <b>the</b> <b>impacts</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> regulation on third countries’ fisheries deserve research attention. Port states measures and trade-market measures influence third countries the most among those measures adopted by the regulation. China is a main exporter of fisheries products to the EU. This study particularly focuses on <b>the</b> <b>impacts</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> regulation on China’s fisheries management and conservation. Firstly, the EU IUU Regulation is briefly introduced. Then the study discusses <b>the</b> <b>impacts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> EU IUU Regulation on China. Finally, recommendations for development of China’s fisheries laws are provided...|$|R

25|$|The anti-Chinese {{sentiment}} of the Nanyang has subsided {{in recent years}} as Chinese influence results in prosperous rather than communist results.

5|$|Severe Tropical Cyclone Joni {{impacted}} {{the island}} nations of Tuvalu and Fiji, while it also threatened the Fijian dependency of Rotuma and the French territory of Wallis and Futuna. The {{majority of the}} Tuvaluan islands suffered minor damage from Joni, while in Fiji the system caused a moderate to severe amount of damage. Due to <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> system, the name Joni was subsequently retired, {{from the list of}} names for the region by the World Meteorological Organization. This would normally mean that the name would not be used again in the region, however, the name remained on the list and was used during the 2008–09 season.|$|E
5|$|Allen and Clay, both lawyers by profession, {{were hurt}} by a general {{distrust}} of lawyers by the Kentucky electorate. Further, Allen {{had served as}} general counsel for Aaron Burr, and several anonymous letters to the state's newspapers {{accused him of being}} privy to Burr's alleged scheme to create an independent state in the southwest. Henry Clay was among those who vigorously defended Allen from the charges. Scott also frequently spoke in highly complimentary terms of Allen. As a legislator, Green Clay pushed for measures favorable to debtors; he consequently enjoyed strong support from settlers south of the Green River, many of whom were squatters and land speculators who owed substantial debts to the state. To counter Scott's hero image, Clay supporters pointed to his service with George Rogers Clark in a 1782 expedition against the Shawnee, but <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> line of campaigning was minimal. As the most senior Revolutionary War officer in Kentucky, Scott became the recognized leader of the state's veterans' lobby. The Independence Day celebrations held around the state just before the August 1 election provided a boost for his campaign. On election day, he garnered 22,050 votes, compared to 8,430 votes for Allen and 5,516 votes for Clay.|$|E
5|$|The book starts by {{quoting the}} First Amendment, which prohibits the U.S. Congress from {{creating}} legislation that limits free speech or {{freedom of the}} press. The author analyzes <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> clause and refers to the writer of the United States Constitution, James Madison, who believed that {{freedom of the press}} would serve as a form of separation of powers to the government. Lewis writes that an expansive respect for freedom of speech informs the reader as to why citizens should object to governmental attempts to block the media from reporting about the causes of a controversial war. Lewis warns that, in a state in which controversial views are not allowed to be spoken, citizens and reporters merely serve as advocates for the state itself. He recounts key historic events in which fear led to overreaching acts by the government, particularly from the executive branch. The author gives background on the century-long process by which the U.S. judicial system began defending publishers and writers from attempts at suppression of speech by the government.|$|E

5|$|Raids resumed soon after, {{in which}} the Cretans were joined by North African and Syrian fleets. The Peloponnese in {{particular}} suffered considerably from their raids, but also Euboea and the Cyclades: the islands of Patmos, Karpathos and nearby Sokastro came under Cretan control, and Cretan rule extended {{as far north as}} Aegina in the Saronic Gulf, and to Elafonisos and Cythera off the southern coast of the Peloponnese; the great Cycladic island of Naxos, probably along with the neighbouring islands of Paros and Ios, was forced to pay them the poll-tax (jizya). As the Muslim presence left generally few material or literary traces, the list of islands at one time controlled or occupied by them could well be longer. Nevertheless, <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> new wave of Arab raids was felt across the Aegean, where some islands were deserted altogether, and elsewhere coastal sites were abandoned for better protected inland locations. Athens may have been occupied in c. 896–902, and in 904, a Syrian fleet led by Leo of Tripoli sacked the Byzantine Empire's second city, Thessalonica. The Arabs of Crete co-operated closely with their Syrian counterparts, who often used Crete as a base or a stop-over, as during Leo of Tripoli's fleet return from Thessalonica, when many of the over 20,000 Thessalonian captives were sold or gifted as slaves in Crete. Likewise, the Cretan emirate received strong support from the Tulunid governors of Egypt (868–905), but their Ikhshidid successors neglected aid to Crete. In 911, another large-scale Byzantine expedition of well over 100 ships was launched against Crete, headed by the admiral Himerios, but it was forced to leave the island after a few months. On its return journey, Himerios' fleet was destroyed in battle off Chios by the Syrian fleet.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> {{arrangement}} on {{the economics}} of transporting large volumes of NGL was considerable.

25|$|Hydroelectric {{power plants}} {{generally}} require {{the creation of}} a large artificial lake.
