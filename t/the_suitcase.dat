5|$|Lorena Telpuk, {{formerly}} María del Luján Telpuk (sometimes María de Luján Telpuk) or <b>the</b> <b>Suitcase</b> Girl (born c. 1981), is {{a former}} airport police officer at Aeroparque Jorge Newbery in Buenos Aires, Argentina, who noticed a suitcase with US$800,000 as it went through an X-ray machine in August 2007. In December 2007, the money became a very public part of an international election suitcase scandal, known as Maletinazo. When <b>the</b> <b>suitcase</b> scandal became public, she became an international celebrity and appeared {{on the cover of}} several magazines, including those of the February 2008 issue of the Argentine edition of Playboy magazine and the March 2008 issue of the Venezuelan edition of Playboy magazine.|$|E
5|$|In 1970, the 73-note Stage Piano was {{introduced}} as a lighter and more portable {{alternative to the}} existing two-piece style, featuring four detachable legs (used in Fender steel pedal guitars), a sustain pedal and a single output jack. Although the Stage could be used with any amplifier, catalogs suggested {{the use of the}} Fender Twin Reverb. The older style piano continued to be sold alongside the Stage and was renamed <b>the</b> <b>Suitcase</b> Piano, with 88 note models also becoming available.|$|E
25|$|The {{caretaker}} at the Otis home {{heard of}} the Zeehandelaar bomb, and decided to search around the Otis house. He found a leather suitcase behind some bushes under a bay window. Again the police arrived, and carried <b>the</b> <b>suitcase</b> {{away from the house}} and out in the open. But while they were cutting open <b>the</b> <b>suitcase,</b> the clockwork alarm went off inside <b>the</b> <b>suitcase.</b> The police ran to safety just before the bomb exploded. Investigators speculated that, like the Zeehandelaar bomb, the clock mechanism at the Otis house had been wound too tightly, delaying the explosion.|$|E
25|$|To {{dispose of}} <b>the</b> body, <b>the</b> <b>suitcases</b> were thrown off a {{bridge over the}} Lehigh River in White Haven, Pennsylvania, along Interstate 80. They fell about 300 feet before hitting the ground. It is {{believed}} that <b>the</b> <b>suitcases</b> were thrown out of a vehicle traveling west. The killer most likely intended to have <b>the</b> <b>suitcases</b> land in <b>the</b> water below, to lessen the chance of their being found. Two of <b>the</b> <b>suitcases</b> landed in <b>the</b> woods, 20 feet from the river; the third, containing the head and fetus, {{was found on the}} river bank.|$|R

25|$|A search {{concluded}} that there was no T. Keane missing in any English-speaking country and a nationwide circulation of the dry-cleaning marks also proved fruitless. In fact, all that could be garnered from <b>the</b> <b>suitcase</b> was that since a coat in <b>the</b> <b>suitcase</b> had a front gusset and featherstitching, it could have been made only in the United States, as this was the only country that possessed the machinery for that stitch. Although mass-produced, the body work is done when the owner is fitted before it is completed. The coat had not been imported, indicating the man had been in the United States or bought the coat from someone of similar size who had been.|$|E
25|$|As an example, {{consider}} {{determining whether}} a suitcase contains some radioactive material. Placed under a Geiger counter, it produces 10 counts per minute. The null hypothesis is that no radioactive material is in <b>the</b> <b>suitcase</b> and that all measured counts are due to ambient radioactivity typical of the surrounding air and harmless objects. We can then calculate how {{likely it is that}} we would observe 10 counts per minute if the null hypothesis were true. If the null hypothesis predicts (say) on average 9 counts per minute, then according to the Poisson distribution typical for radioactive decay there is about 41% chance of recording 10 or more counts. Thus we can say that <b>the</b> <b>suitcase</b> is compatible with the null hypothesis (this does not guarantee that there is no radioactive material, just that we don't have enough evidence to suggest there is). On the other hand, if the null hypothesis predicts 3 counts per minute (for which the Poisson distribution predicts only 0.1% chance of recording 10 or more counts) then <b>the</b> <b>suitcase</b> is not compatible with the null hypothesis, and there are likely other factors responsible to produce the measurements.|$|E
25|$|To {{slightly}} formalize intuition: Radioactivity {{is suspected}} if the Geiger-count with <b>the</b> <b>suitcase</b> is among or exceeds the greatest (5% or 1%) of the Geiger-counts made with ambient radiation alone. This makes no {{assumptions about the}} distribution of counts. Many ambient radiation observations are required to obtain good probability estimates for rare events.|$|E

5000|$|Yousef, {{wanting to}} get the bombs on a plane bound for the U.S., called a friend with {{diplomatic}} immunity in Qatar {{who was willing to}} take <b>the</b> <b>suitcases</b> to London and check them on a flight to the U.S. The plan was that they would explode mid-flight and destroy the plane. Yousef planned to use the friend's diplomatic immunity to ensure <b>the</b> <b>suitcases</b> would be loaded on the plane. According to Simon Reeve's book The New Jackals, the name of this friend has not been revealed, but his father {{is said to be a}} very senior politician and leading member of the establishment in Qatar (at the time, Yousef's maternal uncle, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, was living in Qatar as the guest of a Qatari cabinet official). However, there was a problem and <b>the</b> <b>suitcases</b> were not checked in. Yousef and Parker returned to Pakistan on 2 February 1995.(Reeve (1999), pp 98-100) ...|$|R
25|$|Having fallen a long distance, two of <b>the</b> <b>suitcases</b> {{had opened}} {{and parts of}} the body had emerged. The head, fetus, and the two halves of the torso were exposed.|$|R
25|$|A {{canceled}} check {{introduced into}} {{evidence showed that}} Cottrell purchased <b>the</b> <b>suitcase</b> six days before the murder. Drops of Phillips' blood {{were found on the}} bathroom tiles in the hotel. Cottrell's DNA was also found on a cigarette in Cottrell's truck. Previously, investigators were unsure whether Phillips had been killed at Rough River Lake, where his body was found, or elsewhere.|$|E
25|$|Chambers {{remained}} handcuffed {{through the}} trial. Barlow was not cuffed but used crutches {{due to a}} groin injury. The arresting officer testified that he saw Barlow holding the maroon suitcase and shivering while waiting to board the plane. The court heard that Chambers had acknowledged ownership of <b>the</b> <b>suitcase</b> {{two days after the}} arrest. Chambers testified in court that he didn't know about the drugs in the case, and that Barlow had also used the case. Chambers also testified that Barlow had attempted to bribe a policeman at the airport when the drugs were discovered.|$|E
25|$|On 15 July 2015, {{the remains}} of a young child {{surrounded}} by girl's clothing were discovered by a passing motorist who examined an abandoned suitcase {{at the side of the}} Karoonda Highway near Wynarka in the Murray Mallee region of South Australia. From the beginning, investigators believed the child had suffered a violent death several years before the remains had been dumped in <b>the</b> <b>suitcase.</b> It was not until October 2015 that the victim was identified as Pearce, aged two, who, with her mother, had been reported missing from Alice Springs more than five years earlier, in 2009.|$|E

25|$|At 11 am on May 29, 2012, {{a package}} {{containing}} a left foot {{was delivered to}} the national headquarters of the Conservative Party of Canada. The package was stained with blood and had a foul smell. It was marked with a red heart symbol. Another package containing a left hand was intercepted in a Canada Post processing facility, addressed to the Liberal Party. A janitor discovered a decomposing torso inside a suitcase, left in a garbage pile in the alley behind an apartment building in the Snowdon area of Montreal. He first saw <b>the</b> <b>suitcase</b> on May 25, {{but it was not}} picked up due to the large amount of garbage that day.|$|E
25|$|Soon {{after the}} {{discovery}} of the child's remains, police made a public appeal for information that could help identify her, based on items that were found with <b>the</b> <b>suitcase</b> including children's clothing and a distinctive hand-made quilt. After more than 1,200 calls to Crime Stoppers, one caller was able to identify the quilt as one made by the child's grandmother, who had died in 2012 believing her daughter and granddaughter were living interstate. Positive identification was achieved by comparing DNA extracted from the child's skeletal remains with DNA retained from a neonatal heel prick test. A national DNA search then linked the child's remains with the profile of her mother, the previously unidentified remains found in the Belanglo State Forest.|$|E

25|$|One {{telephone}} number left as a contact was Vancouver's Ross Street Sikh temple. The other number {{became one of}} the first leads tracked by investigators, and was traced to Hardial Singh Johal, a janitor at a Vancouver high school. Johal was an avid follower of Talwinder Singh Parmar, and thus closely scrutinised in the investigation following the Air India bombing. He was alleged to have stored <b>the</b> <b>suitcase</b> explosives in the basement of a Vancouver school and to have purchased the tickets for the flights on which the bombs were placed. Mandip Singh Grewal recounted how he saw and recognised Johal as his school's janitor when he said goodbye to his father, one of the Flight 182 victims, at the airport on the day of the bombing.|$|E
