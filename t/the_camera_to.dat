5|$|Technique-wise, Sjumandjaja used <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> <b>to</b> emphasise the narrative. Bajangan, {{his first}} work, used long shots {{to show the}} main character's lonesomeness. He would often use several shots to show the {{psychological}} issues faced by his characters, focusing on both the characters and the space around them. He also used references to well-known cultural works; a scene in Kartini was framed so to reflect Leonardo da Vinci's The Last Supper.|$|E
5|$|Shooting in Venice {{took place}} on August 8. For scenes such as Indiana and Brody {{greeting}} Elsa, shots of the boat chase, and Kazim telling Indiana where his father is, Robert Watts gained control of the Grand Canal from 7 am to 1 pm, sealing off tourists {{for as long as}} possible. Cinematographer Douglas Slocombe positioned <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> <b>to</b> ensure no satellite dishes would be visible. San Barnaba di Venezia served as the library's exterior. The next day, filming moved to the ancient city of Petra, Jordan, where Al Khazneh (The Treasury) stood in for the temple housing the Grail. The cast and crew became guests of King Hussein and Queen Noor. The Treasury had previously appeared in Sinbad and the Eye of the Tiger. The main cast completed their scenes that week, after 63 days of filming.|$|E

30|$|PFCEA {{adjusts the}} orientations of <b>the</b> <b>cameras</b> <b>to</b> enlarge <b>the</b> FOV of <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> network.

As PFCEA cannot relate the ROI with the FOV of <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> network, new approaches must be developed. In our proposed PSO, ROI and FOV are related by (1), so our method can work well without any modification.|$|R
5|$|The Bird-of-Prey's {{travel through}} time {{was one of}} the most {{difficult}} effects sequences of the film. While ILM was experienced in creating the streaking warp effect they used for previous films, the sequence required <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> <b>to</b> trail a sustained warp effect as the Bird-of-Prey rounded the sun. Matching the effect to the model was accomplished through trial-and-error guesswork. The team did not have the time to wait for the animation department to create the sun for this shot. Assistant cameraman Pete Kozachic devised a way of creating the sun on-stage. He placed two sheets of textured plexiglass next to each other and backlit them with a powerful yellow light. The rig was rotated on a circular track and the sheet in front created a moire pattern as its position shifted. Animator John Knoll added solar flare effects to complete the look; Dow recalled that the effect came close to matching footage of the sun taken by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.|$|E
5|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began on}} November 9, 1981, and ended on January 29, 1982. The Wrath of Khan was more action-oriented than its predecessor, but less costly to make. The project was supervised by Paramount's television unit {{rather than its}} theatrical division. Bennett, a respected television veteran, made The Wrath of Khan on a budget of $11million—far less than The Motion Pictures $46million. The budget was initially lower at $8.5 million, but it rose when the producers were impressed by {{the first two weeks}} of footage. Meyer used camera and set tricks to spare the construction of large and expensive sets. For a scene taking place at Starfleet Academy, a forced perspective was created by placing scenery close to <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> <b>to</b> give the sense the set was larger than it really was. To present the illusion that the Enterprises elevators moved between decks, corridor pieces were wheeled out of sight to change the hall configuration while the lift doors were closed. Background equipment such as computer terminals were rented when possible instead of purchased outright. Some designed props, such as a redesigned phaser and communicator, were vetoed by Paramount executives in favor of existing materials from The Motion Picture.|$|E

25|$|If direct flash must be used, a {{good rule}} of thumb is to {{separate}} the flash from the lens by 1/20 of the distance of <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> <b>to</b> the subject.

30|$|The {{novelty of}} the {{proposed}} method arises from using a reference image and local areas to compute the image-quality attributes of the natural pictures captured by <b>the</b> <b>cameras</b> <b>to</b> be benchmarked. <b>The</b> contribution of the method lies in utilizing scene features <b>to</b> measure digital <b>camera</b> quality attributes. This is accomplished by identifying local areas from a given scene digitized by capturing with reference camera. A high-quality reference camera plays a key role. The corresponding areas for the images captured by <b>the</b> <b>cameras</b> <b>to</b> be benchmarked are located using area descriptors. The difference from the earlier RR metrics [18, 19] is using local regions for the attribute measurements.|$|R

He was the most photographed American of the 19th Century, self-consciously using photography to advance his political views. He never smiled, specifically so as not to play into the racist caricature of a happy slave. He tended to look directly into <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> <b>to</b> confront the viewer, with a stern look.|$|E
25|$|Several special filming {{techniques}} were devised to obtain {{some of the}} footage of rare and elusive animals. One cameraman spent hundreds of hours waiting for the fleeting moment when a rare frog, which incubates its young in its mouth, finally spat them out. Another built a replica of a mole rat burrow in a horizontally mounted wheel, so that as the mole rat ran along the tunnel, the wheel could be spun to keep the animal adjacent to <b>the</b> <b>camera.</b> <b>To</b> illustrate the motion of bats' wings in flight, a slow motion sequence was filmed in a wind tunnel.

25|$|There was {{a problem}} facing the crew in the newsroom, however. There was no {{television}} camera in the studio {{at the time as}} the technical crew was working on it. Eventually the camera was retrieved and brought back to the newsroom. Because of the magnitude of the story and the continuous flow of information coming from various sources, time was of the essence and the camera would take at least twenty minutes to become operational under normal circumstances. The decision was made to dispatch Cronkite to the CBS Radio Network booth to report the events and play the audio over the television airwaves while the crew worked on <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> <b>to</b> see if they could get it set up quicker.|$|E
