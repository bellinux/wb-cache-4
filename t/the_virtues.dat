5|$|Although Sanskrit {{literature}} remained popular {{during the}} Hoysala rule, royal patronage of local Kannada scholars increased. In the 12th century some works {{were written in}} the Champu style, but distinctive Kannada metres became more widely accepted. The Sangatya metre used in compositions, Shatpadi (six line), tripadi (three line) metres in verses and ragale (lyrical poems) became fashionable. Jain works continued to extol <b>the</b> <b>virtues</b> of Tirthankaras (Jain saviour figures).|$|E

5|$|As {{the pair}} leave separately, Mařenka's parents, Ludmila and Krušina, enter with the {{marriage}} broker Kecal. After some discussion, Kecal announces {{that he has}} found a groom for Mařenka – Vašek, younger son of Tobiáš Mícha, a wealthy landowner; the older son, he explains, is a worthless good-for-nothing. Kecal extols <b>the</b> <b>virtues</b> of Vašek ("He's a nice boy, well brought up"), as Mařenka re-enters. In the subsequent quartet she responds by saying that she already has a chosen lover. Send him packing, orders Kecal. The four argue, but little is resolved. Kecal decides he must convince Jeník to give up Mařenka, as the villagers return, singing and dancing a festive polka.|$|E

5|$|Britomart Redeems Faire Amoret is an oil {{painting}} on canvas by English artist William Etty, first exhibited in 1833 {{and now in}} Tate Britain. Intended to illustrate <b>the</b> <b>virtues</b> of honour and chastity, it depicts a scene from Edmund Spenser's The Faerie Queene in which the female warrior Britomart slays the evil magician Busirane and frees his captive, the beautiful Amoret. In Spenser's original poem Amoret has been tortured and mutilated {{by the time of}} her rescue, but Etty disliked the depiction of violence and portrayed her as unharmed.|$|E

Katherine remained unaware of her sons' strip club activities for many years. Journalist J. Randy Taraborrelli reflected on Jackson's early life and noted that {{at such a young}} age, the singer may not have been psychologically equipped to fully understand any sexual stimulation he may have received from such voyeuristic events. The writer further commented that Jackson's views on sex must have been conflicted between those of his religiously strict mother and his more libertine and promiscuous father.|$|E
5|$|Friedman was an {{advisor to}} Republican U.S. President Ronald Reagan and Conservative British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. His {{political}} philosophy extolled <b>the</b> <b>virtues</b> {{of a free}} market economic system with minimal intervention. He once stated that his role in eliminating U.S. conscription was his proudest accomplishment. In his 1962 book Capitalism and Freedom, Friedman advocated policies such as a volunteer military, freely floating exchange rates, abolition of medical licenses, a negative income tax, and school vouchers. His support for school choice led him to found the Friedman Foundation for Educational Choice, later renamed EdChoice.|$|E

5|$|Hope {{is closely}} related to Idle Child of Fancy, {{completed}} by Watts in 1885, which also shows a personification of one of the traditional virtues (in this case Love) sitting on a cloud-shrouded globe. In traditional depictions of <b>the</b> <b>virtues,</b> Love was shown blindfolded while Hope was not; in Hope and Idle Child Watts reversed this imagery, depicting Love looking straight ahead and Hope as blind. It {{is believed to be the}} first time a European artist depicted Hope as blind.|$|E

5|$|Many of Model's fellow {{officers}} considered him a Nazi. He frequently harangued his troops {{to have faith}} in the Führer and uphold <b>the</b> <b>virtues</b> of National Socialism. He accepted the offer of SS-Gruppenführer Hermann Fegelein to appoint a Waffen-SS officer as his adjutant at Army Group North in 1944, after the Heerespersonalamt had refused him an adjutant, and filled the Nationalsozialistischer Führungsoffizier (NSFO, essentially a Nazi political commissar) post at Army Group B that had been vacant before his arrival. His habit of parroting the Führer's orders caused him to be viewed as a sycophant, even if he often undermined or ignored those orders in practice.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Virtue</b> amps were {{launched}} at the Rocky Mountain Audio Fest in Denver, Colorado on October 2008. The company’s first product, <b>the</b> <b>Virtue</b> One, shipped November, 2008. Initially called the Audiophile.ONE and Audiophile.TWO, the names were changed due to possible trademark issues with another audio product. The rear of both units include a single set of {{left and right}} speaker terminals, {{as well as a}} single set of left and right RCA inputs and a buffered subwoofer output and power source input. The face includes a proportionally large chrome volume knob and a push in power button. <b>The</b> <b>Virtue</b> One ships standard with a 24volt, 65 watt regulated switching power supply, which is said to produce 30 watts per channel. <b>The</b> <b>Virtue</b> Two ships with a 30 volt, 90 watt unit producing 50 watts per channel. The 30v, 90 power supply produces 45 watts per channel from <b>the</b> <b>Virtue</b> One as an upgrade. A 30 volt, 130 watt power supply is also offered as an upgrade to both units producing 60 watts per channel.|$|R
5|$|Winston {{cigarettes}} were {{sponsors of}} such television series as The Beverly Hillbillies and The Flintstones.

The latter series would later {{come under fire}} for advertising cigarettes on an animated series watched by many children, but Winston pulled their involvement with the series after the Pebbles Flintstone character was born in 1963.|$|E
5|$|A {{composite}} of Perrault's male heroes, however, indicates {{the opposite of}} his heroines: his male characters are not particularly handsome, but they are active, brave, ambitious, and deft, and they use their wit, intelligence, and great civility {{to work their way}} up the social ladder and to achieve their goals. In this case of course, it is the cat who displays the characteristics and the man benefits from his trickery and skills. Unlike the tales dealing with submissive heroines waiting for marriage, the male-centered tales suggest social status and achievement are more important than marriage for men. <b>The</b> <b>virtues</b> of Perrault's heroes reflect upon the bourgeoisie of the court of Louis XIV and upon the nature of Perrault, who was a successful civil servant in France during the seventeenth century.|$|E
5|$|After the Reformation, the Mass and Purgatory were {{rejected}} by the Kirk, along with the efficacy of good works and prayers for the dead. In place of elaborate processions and masses at a funeral there was a simple service, where the body was taken to its resting place without singing and readings and interred soberly without ceremony. Unlike other reformed churches the Kirk also rejected burial inside the church, which were now seen as unseemly for a house of prayer. This caused friction with traditional rights, particularly of local notables, to be buried with their ancestors. The use of burial aisles, an extension projecting for {{the main body of}} the church, almost exclusively used for burial and commemoration, represented a uniquely Scottish solution to this problem. For most ranks in society the kirkyard remained the desired place of burial. From the seventeenth century burials were increasingly marked by gravestones, often including inscriptions that indicated affection for and <b>the</b> <b>virtues</b> of the deceased.|$|E

5|$|Another element {{widely used}} by Gaudí was the {{catenary}} arch. He had studied geometry thoroughly {{when he was}} young, studying numerous articles about engineering, a field that praised <b>the</b> <b>virtues</b> of the catenary curve as a mechanical element, one which at that time, however, was used only {{in the construction of}} suspension bridges. Gaudí was the first to use this element in common architecture. Catenary arches in works like the Casa Milà, the Teresian College, the crypt of the Colònia Güell and the Sagrada Família allowed Gaudí to add an element of great strength to his structures, given that the catenary distributes the weight it regularly carries evenly, being affected only by self-canceling tangential forces.|$|E
5|$|At a {{young age}} Saint-Just had shown a fascination with literature, and during his stay at the {{reformatory}} he used his time to begin writing a lengthy poem. He published it anonymously {{more than two years}} later, in May 1789, at the very outbreak of the Revolution. The 21-year-old Saint-Just thereby added his own touch to the social tumult of the times with Organt, poem in twenty cantos. The poem, a medieval epic fantasy, relates the quest of young Antoine Organt. It extols <b>the</b> <b>virtues</b> of primitive man, praising his libertinism and independence while blaming all present-day troubles on modern inequalities of wealth and power. Written in a style mimicking Ariosto, it gave a juvenile foreshadowing of his own political extremism. Spiked with brutal satire and scandalous pornographic episodes, it also made unmistakable attacks upon the monarchy, the nobility, and the Church.|$|E
5|$|Brahmashiva, {{the court}} poet of King Vikramaditya VI, earned the title Kavichakravarti ("Emperor among poets") from his patron for his writing Samayaparikshe ("Analysis of the doctrine", c.1125). In this {{philosophical}} writing, containing touches of propagandist satire and humor, the author seeks to prove <b>the</b> <b>virtues</b> of Jainism superior {{to all other}} contemporary religions. Brahmashiva portrays contemporary life and beliefs {{of the people of}} the Kannada-speaking region. He criticises Hinduism and the conversion of a Jain temple originally dedicated to the Tirthankar Chandrapraba in Kholapur into a Hindu temple deifying the goddess Mahalakshmi. He expresses reservation regarding the existence of religious cosmopolitanism within a household where family members followed multiple faiths. The author is concerned about the eroding popularity of Jainism in southern India due to the rising popularity of the Veerashaiva movement. Prince Kirtivarma, a younger brother of King Vikramaditya VI, wrote Govaidya ("Cattle Medicine"), the earliest available writing in Kannada on veterinary science, which mixes medicine and magic.|$|E
25|$|In Sanskrit {{literature}} of Hinduism, <b>the</b> <b>virtue</b> of humility is explained with many terms, {{some of which}} use the root word, neti (sometimes spelled nati, nti, Sanskrit: नति).
