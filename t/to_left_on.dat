25|$|The {{standard}} marked patrol {{vehicle for}} response and neighbourhood officers {{has been the}} Vauxhall Astra although these are gradually being phased out in favour of automatic Vauxhall Insignias. A number of Peugeot 308, Peugeot Expert cage vans, LDV Maxi cage vans and Ford Focus vehicles {{are included in the}} fleet also. All of these vehicles are modified for police usage with radios installed, lights, sirens and a 'run lock' facility enabling officers to take the keys out of the ignition without stopping the engine running, thereby ensuring the battery isn't depleted if the lights need <b>to</b> <b>left</b> <b>on</b> for long periods.|$|E
25|$|Wakefield {{entered his}} 16th {{season with the}} Boston Red Sox in 2010. He began {{the year in the}} {{starting}} rotation until Daisuke Matsuzaka came off the disabled list. He later rejoined the rotation due to an injury to Josh Beckett. On May 12, Wakefield recorded his 2000th career strikeout against Vernon Wells of the Toronto Blue Jays in a 3-2 loss. He joined Jamie Moyer, Javier Vázquez, and Andy Pettitte as the only active pitchers with at least 2000 career strikeouts. On June 8, Wakefield passed Roger Clemens for the most innings pitched by a Red Sox pitcher. He went on to win that game 3-2 over the Cleveland Indians. On June 13, Wakefield joined Moyer and Pettitte as the only active pitchers with 3,000 innings pitched. He accomplished this feat by retiring Shane Victorino of the Philadelphia Phillies on a fly ball <b>to</b> <b>left.</b> <b>On</b> July 2, he surpassed Clemens for another record, this for starts at Fenway; he went 8 innings to win 3-2 over the Baltimore Orioles.|$|E

2500|$|Leg spin {{is a type}} of spin bowling in {{the sport}} of cricket. A leg spinner bowls right-arm with a wrist spin action, causing the ball to spin from right to left in the cricket pitch, at the point of delivery. When the ball bounces, the spin causes the ball to deviate sharply from right to left, that is, away from the leg side of a {{right-handed}} batsman. The same kind of trajectory, which spins from right <b>to</b> <b>left</b> <b>on</b> pitching, when performed by a left-arm bowler is known as left-arm orthodox spin bowling.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{scholars}} interpret {{these images}} as Krasner's reworking of Hebrew script. In an interview later in her career, Krasner admitted to subconsciously working from right <b>to</b> <b>left</b> <b>on</b> her canvases, leading scholars {{to believe that}} her Jewish background affected the rendering of her work. Some scholars have interpreted these paintings to represent Krasner's reaction to the tragedy of The Holocaust. [...] Others have claimed that her work with the War Services project caused her {{to be interested in}} text and codes since cryptoanalysis was a main concern for winning the war.|$|E

2500|$|The Libyan Berbers {{developed}} their own writing system, evidently derived from Phoenician, {{as early as the}} 4th century BC. It was a boustrophic script, i.e., written left to right then right <b>to</b> <b>left</b> <b>on</b> alternating lines, or up and down in columns. Most of these early inscriptions were funerary and short in length. Several longer texts exist, taken from Thugga, modern Dougga, Tunisia. Both are bilingual, being written in Punic with its letters and in Berber with its letters. One throws some light on the governing institutions of the Berbers in the 2nd century BC. The other text begins: [...] "This temple the citizens of Thugga built for King Masinissa.... Today the script descendent from the ancient Libyan remains in use; it is called Tifinagh.|$|E
