40|$|Despite {{the ban on}} high-seas {{driftnet}} {{fishing in}} the north Pacific Ocean in the early 1990 s, fishing effort by <b>trawlers,</b> longliners, <b>purse</b> <b>seiners,</b> trollers, and driftnetters continues throughout the Pacific Ocean. The annual number of vessels operating per fishery per country varies greatly, from less than 10 vessels per fishery {{for some of the}} small island nations, to over 600 for the more economically powerful countries. For most of these fishing fleets, little or no data exists regarding the incidental bycatch of marine mammal and sea turtle populations, particularly for those species in danger of extinction. Without such information, it is difficult to assess the impacts of these fisheries on species included in this Opinion. Nevertheless, bycatch information, including survival rates following entanglements, collected by observers and through fisher self reporting does exist for some fisheries in the eastern and western Pacific Ocean.

In comparison with the tuna long liner of 500 GT class, the American style <b>purse</b> <b>seiner</b> {{of the same size}} is 20. 2 % broader in actual size and 16 % broader in L/B and has more stability. The speed which is required to be over 14 knots in cruising condition is 14. 7 knots for the <b>purse</b> <b>seiner</b> and 12. 8 knots for the tuna long liner. The <b>purse</b> <b>seiner</b> has the hull form of greater midship section coefficient and smaller block coefficient, i. e., the hull form of fat midship and rapidly slim bow and stern. The incident angle of water line at the bow is 9 ～ 14 degrees for the <b>purse</b> <b>seiner</b> while it is approximately 38 degrees for the tuna long liner. The trim of the <b>purse</b> <b>seiner</b> in light load condition is by the head since this vessel carries net and skiff boat in the stern area. This is a significant characteristic of the <b>purse</b> <b>seiner.</b> The metacentric height (GM) in full load condition, i. e., in working condition is 0. 93 m which is about twice as much as that of ordinary fishing vessels, giving consideration to the safty against unvavorable condition in navigation and fishing operation. However, the period of rolling is 7 ～ 9 seconds which is an ordinary period for the fishing vessel of 500 GT class. 米国で開発された 500 総トン級米国式旋網船と日本で開発された 500 総トン級鮪延縄船各 4 隻の要目,速力、船型,性能の平均値を比較検討した。米国式旋網船は,甲板上の搭載物重量が重いため幅を鮪延縄船より 20. 2 %広げて復原力を増している。米国式旋網船の巡航速力である 3 / 4 負荷では, 14 ノット以上要求されているが,調査した限りでは平均で 14. 7 ノットであり,鮪延縄船では, 12, 8 ノットであった。米国式旋網船は,船体中央部では鮪延縄船より肥っているが船首および船尾で急激にやせている船型である。船首の水線入射角は,米国式旋網船は極端に小さく 9 度～ 14 度であり,鮪延縄船では 38 度位である。軽荷状態の米国式旋網船のTrimはTrim by the headである。船尾に重量物(漁網約 30 トン, 9 mスキフボート約 15 トン) を積む関係であるが,このTrimは顕著な特徴である。重量物の搭載後の満載状態では 1. 14 mTrim by the sternとなり,航海に適したTrimとなる。運航者が,船の安全度と初期復原力を知る目安としているMetacentric height (GM) は,稼働状態の満載状態では 0. 93 mで一般漁船の約 2 倍となっているが,漁撈時に於ける船体の傾斜,その他の航海,操業時における悪条件の中での安全性について考慮を払ったものと思われる。GMが大きければ横揺れ周期が短くなるが,周期は 7 ～ 9 秒で 500 トン級漁船としては通常の周期である...|$|R
40|$|The {{evaluation}} of the fishing effort exerted by <b>purse</b> <b>seiners</b> on tropical tuna requires a constant monitoring {{of the changes in}} individual fishing power of <b>purse</b> <b>seiners</b> due to changes in vessel characteristics, fishing gears or fishing strategies. Also, since the 1990 s, increasing numbers of drifting Fish Aggregating Devices have been used by this fleet. As dFADs contribute to a reduction of search times, traditional measures of fishing effort such as search time or fishing time are inappropriate. Here, using logbook data from the French and the Spanish purse seine fleets over 2003 - 2014, the effects of purse seiners' characteristics (length, the size of the wells, period of construction) and their use of support vessels on the efficiency of <b>purse</b> <b>seiners</b> are analyzed with GLM models. 3 dimensions of the efficiency of <b>purse</b> <b>seiners</b> are analyzed: monthly catch rates, monthly frequency of fishing sets and monthly distance of fishing sets.

40|$|India is {{endowed with}} a {{continental}} shelf of 0. 5 million km 2 and an {{exclusive economic zone}} (EEZ) of about 2 million km 2. Almost half (39 %) of the Indian population utilizes the marine fisheries resources. India ranked sixth worldwide in total fish production (4. 95 million t) and second in inland fish production (2. 24 million t) during 1995 - 96. Fish production expanded from 0. 75 million t in 1950 - 51 to 4. 95 million t in 1995 - 96, giving a significant increase at a cumulative growth rate of 4. 2 % per annum. Marine fish production increased from 0. 53 million t in 1950 - 51 to 2. 71 million t in 1995 - 96. The contribution of the fisheries sector to the total gross domestic product (GDP) improved from 0. 75 % in 1980 - 81 to 1. 28 % in 1994 - 95, with marine fisheries providing employment opportunities both in the production and post-harvest sectors. Subsidiary employment in fishing includes boat building and repair, net mending, repair of engines and supply of diesel, kerosene and other essential items. Women are mostly engaged in post-harvest operations like net mending, fish processing, packing and selling of fish and fish products. The contribution to foreign exchange earnings by the fishery sector substantially increased from Rs 46 crores in 1960 - 61 to Rs 4 697 (US$ 121 *) in 1997 - 98. India exports about 55 types of marine products to different countries in Southwest Asia, Europe and USA. The total quantity of marine product exports rose from 97 200 t in 1987 - 88 to 307 337 t in 1994 - 95 giving an equivalent export value of Rs 53 000 lakhs to Rs 357 500 lakhs**. The marine fishing sector can be classified into: (a) non-motorized artisanal sector using country craft with traditional gear; (b) motorized sector; (c) mechanized sector using inboard engines of 50 to 120 HP; and (d) deep sea fishing with bigger boats (25 m and above) and engines of 120 HP and above. In 1996, India had a total fishing fleet of 238 125 units comprising 160 000 traditional craft, 31 726 motorized craft (converted from traditional) and 46 918 mechanized vessels operating different gear combinations. For artisanal fishing, the use of canoe and boat seine in Kerala provided the highest net income of Rs 0. 10 lakh with an annual catch of 51 t and an initial investment of Rs 0. 85 lakh. In motorized fishing, canoe and ring seine in Kerala offered a net income of Rs 0. 98 lakh with an annual catch of 220 t and an initial investment of Rs 5. 0 lakh. All major fishing units in Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Gujarat have higher profits not because of higher levels of fish catch but due to a better fish price. In the motorized sector, {{the increase in the}} price of fish over the years is greater than the increase in fuel expenditure. Small <b>trawlers,</b> <b>purse</b> <b>seiners,</b> dol-netters, gillnetters, pair trawlers and sona boats are the major types of mechanized fishing units operating in the inshore waters (up to 50 m depth). Trawlers and gillnetters are mostly operated along the Indian coasts whereas the fishing fleet mentioned above is confined to certain regions only. A small trawler (32 Ã† - 36 Ã†) has a net income of Rs 0. 90 lakh with an annual catch of 72 t and initial investment of Rs 5. 2 lakh in Karnataka. A <b>purse</b> <b>seiner</b> has a net earning of Rs 3. 14 lakh per year with an annual catch of 280 t and an average investment of Rs 10 lakh. However the average value of fish caught in a <b>purse</b> <b>seiner</b> is Rs 4. 29 per kg set against the break-even cost of Rs 3. 16 per kg. To assess the economic sustainability of Indian marine fisheries in the period 1985 to 1998, the surplus production model or Schaefer Model was applied. Based on this, the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) was estimated at 2 353 726 t with an estimated effort of 984 586 annual fishing hours (AFH). Using the Fox surplus production model, MSY was equal to 2 973 752 t with an effort of 6 126 232 AFH. Note that actual yield during that period was 2 441 043 t with an effort of 12 97 092 AFH. This is indicative of over-fishing in the Indian Sea and Bay of Bengal. A number of management strategies can be applied to reduce the fishing pressure on the coastal areas of India. These are: (a) a ban of certain fishing gear and restricted entry to over-exploited fishing grounds; (b) the promotion of alternative/subsidiary income and emphasizing the importance of mariculture/aquaculture; (c) effective implementation of small scale fishery development projects like infrastructure and service facilities; (d) coastal zone management including protection of marine habitats; and (e) information dissemination and education on the importance of fisheries resources.

The results when compared to the CPUE per species for the East Atlantic revealed that the Ghanaian vessels (1980 – 2000) were in some cases up to 40 times more efficient than large <b>purse</b> <b>seiners</b> in the East Atlantic (1967 - 1980). A single species bioeconomic analysis was conducted {{for each of the three}} species using biological parameters adopted from Conrad and Adu-Asamoah (1986). This showed that present harvest levels of Skipjack and Yellowfin for the East Atlantic region were in excess of the open access equilibrium. Thus a decline in future harvest levels of Skipjack and Yellowfin is expected. Sustainable economic rents calculated for the two-vessel types revealed that, bioeconomically, baitboats are more profitable than <b>purse</b> <b>seiners.</b> It was observed that the FAD’s might be the main cause of changes in the species composition ratio of the tuna catches over the past decade...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{impact of}} {{fisheries}} within a Natura 2000 area in western Greece was assessed over a 12 -month period in 2007. The estimated total biomass removed annually by 307 fishing boats averaged 3503. 5 t. <b>Purse</b> <b>seiners,</b> beach seiners and trawlers took 70 % {{of the total}} landings. <b>Purse</b> <b>seiners,</b> contributing 3 % of the total fishing fleet, were responsible for 33 % of total biomass removed. Beach and <b>purse</b> <b>seiners</b> primarily caught small pelagic species, whereas trawlers and trammel netters mostly demersal species. A mismatch {{was found between the}} Common Fisheries Register (CFR) and an in situ assessment of the active fishing fleet; the number of industrial fishing boats exceeded those registered in CFR for the three administrative ports involved, and {{a large proportion of the}} CFR netters were small and effectively inactive. Fishery management measures for the recovery of an ecosystem considerably damaged by overfishing are proposed...|$|R
