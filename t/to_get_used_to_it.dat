2500|$|In the reset {{timeline}} for the series' fourth season, Torv {{explained that}} [...] "The Olivia we meet and know has known about Fringe Division and {{had all this}} time <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> and work {{out that this is}} her life," [...] rather than becoming familiar with it after the attack on John Scott. Consequently, [...] "when Lincoln comes in, she’s a little more open to him [...] and working with someone again." ...|$|E
2500|$|Peter Jackson {{claimed that}} the poor {{reception}} [...] "wasn't particularly surprising" [...] because [...] "it does take you a while <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>it.</b> Ten minutes is sort of marginal, it probably needed a little bit more". However, once the entire film was released, many critics retained their complaints. While many noted the clarity and immediacy of the action scenes, they also criticised the picture quality as [...] "hyper-real," [...] clear enough to detect [...] "painted sets" [...] and [...] "prosthetic noses". Some critics did respond positively to the overall effect of the higher frame rate, saying it just {{takes a while to}} get used to– still allowing that the extra clarity can make some scenes look like [...] "actors on a set rather than a scene in a movie".|$|E
50|$|It {{begins with}} Kumi {{appearing}} to have landed {{on earth and}} trying <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> Earth's atmosphere. Throughout the video, the version of Kumi tries <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> Earth's atmosphere as another incarnation of her dances {{in front of a}} space shuttle.|$|R
50|$|Many of the men, {{like the}} ones from the 34th Infantry Division who were from Iowa, Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wisconsin, {{had never been to}} the South. Not only did they have <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> basic training, they had <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> the climate (weather and altitude) of Louisiana.|$|R

2500|$|The ram {{air ducts}} {{at the front}} of the drooping, rounded nose {{squeezed}} frontal area away from the headlight, and this, along with the need for a narrow frontal area, necessitated a stacked headlight and high beam behind a single lens. Moreover, the need to reduce the extreme drag encountered at high speeds determined the Hayabusa's entire bulbous, and much-criticized, bodywork design. Koblenz remarked, [...] "non-traditional styling generates the main controversy of the Hayabusa." [...] When viewed through the eyes of those who judged its beauty on the basis of its functionality, or given a little time <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>it,</b> the bike's looks did find admirers. The striking two-tone copper/silver paint scheme was similarly loved by some and hated by others, but was successful if the intent of an all-new, flagship product is to make a bold statement. So while it was called ugly by some in the press, those who aren't appalled by its bulbous silhouette... Styling reminiscent of a walleye pike." [...] this aerodynamic shape was key to the Hayabusa's ability to reach record-setting speeds.|$|E
2500|$|Ringer {{participated in}} his first {{organized}} team activities in May 2009. When talking about rookie camp, he said [...] "Ability-wise, I feel like I am good with competing. Strength, speed and quickness, I feel like I am OK. It's just the plays {{are a lot more}} complicated than college, and I am trying <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>it.</b> I just need some more time. We all just need time. But the veterans have been helpful." [...] Discussing all the Titans rookies (including Ringer), offensive coordinator Mike Heimer-dinger said [...] "Right now, you can tell they're all rookies. But that's about it." [...] Ringer was one of three Titans rookies who remained unsigned trough July 20. Bruce Tollner, Ringer's agent, said of signing Ringer “We are continuing to talk with the Titans, and hopefully we should have something done pretty soon." [...] However, Ringer and the Titans agreed to a multi-year deal on July 21, 2009. His base salary is expected to be $310,000. Titans' running backs coach Earnest Byner said of the running backs, “Each one knows that they're competing for playing time and a position on this team, so there's something to be said about that.” He also said of Ringer, “Bringing in Javon has definitely added to the mix because, right away, guys know he's something to reckon with because they see what he's done out here." ...|$|E

60|$|Timothy nodded. He seemed trying <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> the {{apparition}} before him.|$|R
5000|$|The whole co-writing {{thing was}} kind of hard for me <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> at first, because my song writing process before was a very {{personal}} thing, just by myself, in my room, {{and it was hard}} <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> opening up that thing to somebody else. But it was really cool to work with these folks- I feel like I learned a lot. Matt Hires ...|$|R

6000|$|... "They'll have <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>it,</b> {{just as we}} {{got used}} to it when father went off to Africa and Uncle Randy sent us to Putnam Hall. Perhaps we had better tell them----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{will take}} a few days <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> I suppose," [...] said Sam, with a trace of a sigh. [...] "I know I {{felt the same way}} when first I went to Putnam Hall." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, then, Johnny {{shall have}} more time to think of it,' {{returned}} Mrs Boffin; 'the pretty child shall have time <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>it.</b> And you'll get him more used to it, if you think well of it; won't you?' ...|$|E

[...] "This is the twentieth time I have been across, and I'm {{just as much}} {{astonished}} as I was the first, {{to find out that}} they don't want to know anything about us here." ...|$|E
6000|$|But {{it brought}} them back. [...] "How indeed then she must care!" [...] In answer to which Strether's {{entertainer}} dropped a comprehensive [...] "Ah!" [...] expressive perhaps of some impatience {{for the time}} he took <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>it.</b> She herself had {{got used to it}} long before.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, it {{worries me}} good deal," [...] {{answered}} Cap'n Bill, perched upon Trot's shoulder. [...] "I'm always afraid o' bein' stepped on, and I don't like {{the flavor of}} grass an' can't seem <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>it.</b> It's my nature to eat grass, you know, but I begin to suspect it's an acquired taste." ...|$|E
30|$|At first I {{was just}} {{starting}} <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> everything because I didn’t know everyone but now I just fall right in.|$|R
6000|$|... "We got {{to learn}} all the rotten little game first. See, F'rinstance, we got <b>to</b> <b>get</b> samples of all the blessed wines there are--and learn 'em up. Stern, Smoor, Burgundy, all of 'em! She took Stern to-night--and when she tasted it first--you pulled a face, Susan, you did. I saw you. It {{surprised}} you. You bunched your nose. We got <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> wine and not do that. We got <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> wearing evening dress--YOU, Susan, too." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{the other}} half of him is--SHE! And that's what I can't bear! But I ought to--I'll try <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> it; yes, I ought!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{answered}} March, [...] "you {{have some}} opportunities <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> on this side, {{if you happen}} to live in New York," [...] and he went on to speak of the raggedness which often penetrated the frontier of comfort where he lived in Stuyvesant Square, and which seemed as glad of alms in food or money as this poverty of the steerage.|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{people are}} going to laugh at us," [...] she said, [...] "when they find out we are on a wedding-journey--and they will be sure to find it out in some way or other--I think the fewer people we mingle with the better. I do not think I shall like camping altogether, but I know it is healthful, and I suppose I ought <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>it.</b> It would be dreadfully lonely for just Mr. Archibald and me, but I suppose we can take some one with us to guide and cook." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah! But I don't want <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>it,</b> for {{it costs}} {{too much in}} the end. I don't wish to get used to being whisked about a hot room by men who have taken too much wine, to turn day into night, wasting time that might be better spent, and grow into a fashionable fast girl who can't get along without excitement. I don't deny that much of it is pleasant, but don't try to make me too fond of gaiety. Help me to resist what I know is hurtful, and please don't laugh me out of the good habits Uncle has tried so hard to give me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{guess it}} is safe enough, Dora," [...] he replied, not wishing to alarm her. [...] "It's like an auto--you've got <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> it." ...|$|R
6000|$|But he so far forgot {{himself as}} to interrupt. [...] "It took Mrs. McRankine years, sir, <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> her first husband. She told me so." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I suppose I'm {{about as}} {{comfortable}} as could be expected. Anyhow, I've got <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> the thing. Six weeks is the shortest limit, isn't it?" ...|$|R
60|$|It was not {{his first}} train ride, for Mrs. Elwell had once taken him to Belltown to get an aching tooth extracted, but it was {{certainly}} his first under such exhilarating circumstances, and he meant to enjoy it. To be sure, he was very hungry, but that, he reflected, was only what he would probably be many times before he made his fortune, {{and it was just}} as well <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>it.</b> Meanwhile, it behooved him to keep his eyes open. On the road from Roxbury to Belltown there was not much to be seen that morning that Chester did not see.|$|E
6000|$|EILEEN (in {{a muffled}} voice of hysterical self-accusation, pushing his head away). No, no, you mustn't! I was wrong. The doctor {{told you not}} to, didn't he? Please don't, Fred! It would be awful if {{anything}} happened to you--through me. (Nicholls gives up his attempts, recalled to caution by her words. She raises her face and tries to force a smile through her tears.) But you can kiss me on the forehead, Fred. That can't do any harm. (His face crimson, he does so. She laughs hysterically.) It seems so silly--being kissed that way--by you. (She gulps back a sob and continued to attempt to joke.) I'll have <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>it,</b> won't I? ...|$|E
60|$|He {{attempted}} {{to laugh at}} this pleasantry, but the laugh was hollow and seemed to freeze in his gullet as the wail broke forth again, ten times more hideous than at first. After a time the wail became more continuous, and the watcher began <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>it.</b> Then a happy thought flashed into his mind--this was, perhaps, some sort of mourning for the dead! He was right. The duty of {{the father of the}} poor youth who had been killed was, for several days after the funeral, to sit alone in his house and chant from sunset till daybreak a death-dirge, or, as it is called, the tjerita bari. It was not till next day that this was told to him, but meanwhile the surmise afforded him instantaneous relief.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have changed}} my mind about letting you work here," [...] he said. [...] "I want you <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> the place before I put you among those other boys." ...|$|R
50|$|Practice Mode is a {{great place}} for beginners <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the {{opportunity}} <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> snowboarding. As in Freeride, players have the ability to do what they wish, and to practice tricks.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I was,' I said, with conviction. 'It was too sudden for me. It's {{the sort}} of thing one wants <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> gradually. I shall be ready for it another time.' ...|$|R
