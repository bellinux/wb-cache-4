In fact, there isn't even a setting to let you designate it as your default browser. But for those instance where you need to fire up a lighting-fast browser for quick surfing, Epiphany will do the trick." [...] She further noted, [...] "Though I still use Firefox as my primary browser, lately it seems to run at a snail's pace. So, one of <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>things</b> <b>I</b> noticed about Epiphany is how quickly it launches. And subsequent page loads on my system are equally as fast." [...] Henry criticized Epiphany for its short list of extensions, singling out the lack of Firebug as a deficiency. Web instead supports Web Inspector offered by the WebKit engine, which has similar functionality.|$|E
2500|$|In November 2012, Rowland {{revealed}} she {{had been}} working with production duo Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis. Speaking of their collaboration to Billboards Keith Caulfield, she said [...] "Let me tell you something, {{they are a part}} of the foundation of who I am...Because their sound was one of <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>things</b> <b>I</b> remember about R Being in the studio with them, I wanted to pinch myself." [...] However, it was later revealed that the songs she recorded with Jam and Lewis did not make the album. In February 2013, Rowland revealed that she had over fifty songs recorded for the album that she was continuously working on to put together the final collection. Rowland also worked with The-Dream, Pharrell Williams and Boi-1da. According to USA Today in April 2013, rapper Pusha T would make an appearance on the album. In April 2013, Rowland revealed she had over 70 songs to choose from, amongst a feature vocal from Lil Wayne, the album features Wiz Khalifa and a duet with Pharrell Williams. Additionally Rowland reunited with former Destiny's Child bandmates Beyoncé and Michelle Williams for a song on the album, Rowland stressed that it was not a Destiny's Child reunion but rather a song by herself featuring Beyoncé and Williams.|$|E
2500|$|For the film, Lynch {{decided to}} include pop {{songs from the}} 1960s, {{including}} [...] "In Dreams" [...] by Roy Orbison and [...] "Blue Velvet" [...] by Bobby Vinton, the latter of which was largely inspirational for the film, with Lynch stating that [...] "It was the song that sparked the movie... There was something mysterious about it. It made me think about things. And <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>things</b> <b>I</b> thought about were lawns – lawns and the neighborhood." [...] Other music for the film was also produced, this time composed by Angelo Badalamenti, who {{would go on to}} produce the music for most of Lynch's subsequent cinematic works. Dino de Laurentiis loved the film, and it achieved support from some of the early specialist screenings, but the preview screenings to a mainstream audience were instead highly negative, with most of the audience hating the film. Although Lynch had found success previously with The Elephant Man, Blue Velvets controversy with audiences and critics introduced him into the mainstream, and it became a huge critical and moderate commercial success. The film earned Lynch his second Academy Award nomination for Best Director. Woody Allen, whose film Hannah and Her Sisters was nominated for Best Picture, said that Blue Velvet was his favorite film of the year.|$|E

60|$|The {{remainder}} of the magnificent army of 120,000 men which entered Corinth on the 30th of May had now become so scattered that I was put entirely on the defensive in a territory whose population was hostile to the Union. One of <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>things</b> <b>I</b> {{had to do was}} to construct fortifications at Corinth better suited to the garrison that could be spared to man them. The structures that had been built during the months of May and June were left as monuments to the skill of the engineer, and others were constructed in a few days, plainer in design but suited to the command available to defend them.|$|E

60|$|One of <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>things</b> <b>I</b> {{encountered}} in Pont de Montvert was, if I remember rightly, the Protestant temple; {{but this was}} but the type of other novelties. A subtle atmosphere distinguishes a town in England from a town in France, or even in Scotland. At Carlisle you can see {{you are in the}} one country; at Dumfries, thirty miles away, you are as sure that you are in the other. I should find it difficult to tell in what particulars Pont de Montvert differed from Monastier or Langogne, or even Bleymard; but the difference existed, and spoke eloquently to the eyes. The place, with its houses, its lanes, its glaring river-bed, wore an indescribable air of the South.|$|E
6000|$|Only {{a man who}} has {{undergone}} famine can properly value food; only sailors and desert-dwellers know the meaning of fresh water. And only a child, with a child's imagination, can come to know the meaning of things it has been long denied. I early discovered that the only things I could have were those I got for myself. My meagre childhood developed meagreness. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>things</b> <b>I</b> had been able to get for myself had been cigarette pictures, cigarette posters, and cigarette albums. I had not had the spending of the money I earned, so I traded [...] "extra" [...] newspapers for these treasures. I traded duplicates with the other boys, and circulating, as I did, all about town, I had greater opportunities for trading and acquiring.|$|E
60|$|I {{was born}} in San Francisco in 1876. At fifteen I was a man among men, and if I had a spare nickel I spent it on beer instead of candy, because I thought it was more manly to buy beer. Now, when my years are nearly doubled, I am out on a hunt for the boyhood which I never had, and I am less serious {{than at any other}} time of my life. Guess I'll find that boyhood! Almost <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>things</b> <b>I</b> {{realized}} were responsibilities. I have no recollection of being taught to read or write--I could do both at the age of five--but I know that my first school was in Alameda before I went out on a ranch with my folks and as a ranch boy worked hard from my eighth year.|$|E

6000|$|... "I don't know. I {{think it}} must have been from a woman--perhaps she was my mother; I don't know--who used to sit up in the bed and cough, all night it seemed to me. People would come to see us--ladies in fine clothes, and gentlemen with oily hair. I think they wanted to help us. Many of them had kind voices. But always a hard look would come into her face, and she would tell them what even then I knew to be untrue--it was one of <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>things</b> <b>I</b> can recollect--that we had {{everything}} we wanted, that we needed no help from anyone. They would go away, shrugging their shoulders. I grew up with the feeling that seemed to have been burnt into my brain, that to take from anybody anything you had not earned was shameful. I don't think I could do it even now, not even from you. I am useful to you, dad--I do help you?" ...|$|E
60|$|One of <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>things</b> <b>I</b> {{should take}} in hand, were European affairs {{handed over to}} my control, would be the {{rearrangement}} of the Carnival. As matters are, the Carnival takes place all over Europe in February. At Nice, in Spain, or in Italy, it may be occasionally possible to feel you want to dance about the streets in thin costume during February. But in more northern countries during Carnival time I have seen only one sensible masker; {{he was a man}} who had got himself up as a diver. It was in Antwerp. The rain was pouring down in torrents; a cheery, boisterous John Bull sort of an east wind was blustering through the streets at the rate of fifteen miles an hour. Pierrots, with frozen hands, were blowing blue noses. An elderly Cupid had borrowed an umbrella from a cafe and was waiting for a tram. A very little devil was crying with the cold, and wiping his eyes with the end of his own tail. Every doorway was crowded with shivering maskers. The diver alone walked erect, the water streaming from him.|$|E
60|$|Then that old, faded green curtain, {{which is}} painted as hanging down {{on either side}} of the picture, is, to my eye, a nuisance. The whole interest, therefore, of the piece {{concentrates}} in the centre figures, the Madonna and Child, and two angel children gazing up from the foot of the picture. These angel children were the first point on which my mind rested, in its struggle to overcome its disappointment, and bring itself en rapport with the artist. In order fully to appreciate their spiritual beauty, one must have seen an assortment of those things called angels, which occur in the works of the old masters. Generally speaking, I know of nothing more calculated to moderate any undue eagerness to go to heaven than the common run of canvas angels. Far the greater part are roistering, able-bodied fellows with wings, giving indisputable signs of good living, and of a coarseness slightly suggestive of blackguardism. Far otherwise with these fair creatures, with their rainbow-colored wings, and their serene, upturned eyes of thought baptized with emotion. They are <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>things</b> <b>I</b> have seen worthy of my ideas of Raphael.|$|E

6000|$|I myself, more fortunate, {{was there}} some five years longer. During this period I lost my friend Latouche, who died of a malarious fever during a tour in the Levant. One of <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>things</b> <b>I</b> did on my return was {{to go up to}} Grimwinter to pay a consolatory visit to his poor mother. I found her in deep affliction, and I sat with her the whole of the morning that {{followed}} my arrival (I had come in late at night), listening to her tearful descant and singing the praises of my friend. We talked of nothing else, and our conversation terminated only with the arrival of a quick little woman who drove herself up to the door in a [...] "carryall," [...] and whom I saw toss the reins upon the horse's back with the briskness of a startled sleeper throwing back the bed-clothes. She jumped out of the carryall and she jumped into the room. She proved to be the minister's wife and the great town-gossip, and she had evidently, in the latter capacity, a choice morsel to communicate. I was as sure of this as I was that poor Mrs. Latouche was not absolutely too bereaved to listen to her. It seemed to me discreet to retire; I said I believed I would go and take a walk before dinner.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's a very, {{very long}} time. And yet, when I {{look back on}} it, it all seems but {{a day or two}} ago. Strange that each day should seem so long and that many days added {{together}} should be less than an hour. How clearly I can see old Haydon pacing up and down! Much more clearly, indeed, than I see you, Mr. Spode. The eyes of memory don t grow dim. But my sight is improving, I assure you; it's improving daily. I shall soon be able to see those ankles." [...] He laughed like a cracked bell--one of those little old bells, Spode fancied, that ring, with much rattling of wires, in the far-off servants quarters of ancient houses. [...] "And very soon," [...] Mr. Tillotson went on, [...] "I shall be painting again. Ah, Mr. Spode, my luck is extraordinary. I believe in it, I trust in it. And after all, what is luck? Simply another name for Providence, in spite of the Origin of Species and the rest of it. How right the Laureate was when he said that there was more faith in honest doubt, believe me, than in all the ... er, the ... er ... well, you know. I regard you, Mr. Spode, as the emissary of Providence. Your coming marked a turning-point in my life, and the beginning, for me, of happier days. Do you know, one of <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>things</b> <b>I</b> shall do when my fortunes are restored will be to buy a hedgehog." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do you remember, Mr. Paynter, {{that day}} you first lunched here {{and told us}} about the African trees? Well, it was my birthday; I mean my first birthday. I was born then, or woke up or something. I had walked in this garden like a somnambulist in the sun. I {{think there are many}} such somnambulists in our set and our society; stunned with health, drugged with good manners, fitting their {{surroundings}} too well to be alive. Well, I came alive somehow; and you know how deep in us are the things we first realize when we were babies and began to take notice. I began to take notice. One of <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>things</b> <b>I</b> noticed was your own story, Mr. Paynter. I feel as if I heard of St. Securis as children hear of Santa Claus, and as if that big tree were a bogey I still believed in. For I do still believe in such things, or rather I believe in them more and more; I feel certain my poor father drove on the rocks by disbelieving, and you are all racing to ruin after him. That is why I do honestly want the estate, and that is why I am not ashamed of wanting it. I am perfectly certain, Mr. Paynter, that nobody can save this perishing land and this perishing people but those who understand. I mean who understand a thousand little signs and guides in the very soil and lie of the land, and traces that are almost trampled out. My husband understands, and I have begun to understand; my father would never have understood. There are powers, there is the spirit of a place, there are presences that are not to be put by. Oh, don't fancy I am sentimental and hanker after the good old days. The old days were not all good; that is just the point, and we must understand enough to know the good from the evil. We must understand enough to save the traces of a saint or a sacred tradition, or, where a wicked god has been worshiped, to destroy his altar and to cut down his grove." ...|$|E
