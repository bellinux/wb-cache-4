5|$|Any dive {{which is}} started while the tissues retain {{residual}} inert gas {{in excess of}} the surface equilibrium condition is considered a repetitive dive. This means that the decompression required for the dive is influenced by the divers decompression history. Allowance must be made for inert gas preloading of the tissues which will result in them containing more dissolved gas <b>than</b> <b>would</b> have been the case if the diver had fully equilibrated before the dive. The diver will need to decompress longer to eliminate this increased gas loading.|$|E
5|$|Appropriate {{antibiotics}} {{decrease the}} average 3–5 day duration of symptoms by about one day, and also reduce contagiousness. They are primarily prescribed to reduce rare complications such as rheumatic fever and peritonsillar abscess. The arguments {{in favor of}} antibiotic treatment should be balanced by the consideration of possible side effects, and it is reasonable to suggest that no antimicrobial treatment be given to healthy adults who have adverse reactions to medication or those at low risk of complications. Antibiotics are prescribed for strep throat at a higher rate <b>than</b> <b>would</b> be expected from how common it is.|$|E
5|$|Before 2000, {{arguments}} that the Deccan Traps flood basalts caused the extinction were usually {{linked to the}} view that the extinction was gradual, as the flood basalt events were thought to have started around 68million years ago and lasted for over 2 million years. However, there is evidence that two thirds of the Deccan Traps were created in only 1 million years about 66million years ago, and so these eruptions would have caused a fairly rapid extinction, possibly over a period of thousands of years, but still longer <b>than</b> <b>would</b> be expected from a single impact event.|$|E

5|$|Eta Carinae {{is a close}} binary {{and this}} complicates the {{evolution}} of both stars. Compact massive companions can strip mass from larger primary stars much more quickly <b>than</b> <b>would</b> occur in a single star, so the properties at core collapse can be very different. In some scenarios, the secondary can accrue significant mass, accelerating its evolution, and in turn be stripped by the now compact Wolf–Rayet primary. In the case of Eta Carinae, the secondary is clearly causing additional instability in the primary, {{making it difficult to}} predict future developments.|$|E
5|$|Foliot {{supported}} his uncle Robert de Chesney's nomination to become Bishop of Lincoln, lobbying the pope on Robert's behalf, {{and maintaining a}} long correspondence with Robert after his elevation. The letters to this uncle are full of warm sentiments, more <b>than</b> <b>would</b> be expected of a dutiful correspondence. Other episcopal correspondents and friends included Roger de Pont L'Évêque, the Archbishop of York, Josceline de Bohon, the Bishop of Salisbury, and William de Turbeville, the Bishop of Norwich, who became a regular correspondent after Foliot was translated to London.|$|E
5|$|Frogs have three-chambered hearts, {{a feature}} they share with lizards. Oxygenated {{blood from the}} lungs and de-oxygenated blood from the respiring tissues enter the heart through {{separate}} atria. When these chambers contract, the two blood streams pass into a common ventricle before being pumped via a spiral valve to the appropriate vessel, the aorta for oxygenated blood and pulmonary artery for deoxygenated blood. The ventricle is partially divided into narrow cavities which minimizes the mixing of {{the two types of}} blood. These features enable frogs to have a higher metabolic rate and be more active <b>than</b> <b>would</b> otherwise be possible.|$|E

"Spendthrifts," by contrast, experience too little pain of paying and typically spend more <b>than</b> they <b>would</b> ideally like to spend. This article introduces and validates the "spendthrift-tightwad" scale, a measure of individual differences in the pain of paying. Spending differences between tightwads and spendthrifts are greatest in situations that amplify the pain of paying and smallest in situations that diminish the pain of paying.

Kaney applied to strike out the claim before filing a defence, on the basis that the claim could not possibly succeed given the binding authority of the Court of Appeal decision of Stanton v Callaghan in 1998 that expert witnesses could not be sued for negligence when preparing a joint statement with the opposing side's expert witness.|$|E
5|$|Insects are {{the only}} {{invertebrates}} to have developed active flight capability, and this has {{played an important role}} in their success. Their muscles are able to contract multiple times for each single nerve impulse, allowing the wings to beat faster <b>than</b> <b>would</b> ordinarily be possible. Having their muscles attached to their exoskeletons is more efficient and allows more muscle connections; crustaceans also use the same method, though all spiders use hydraulic pressure to extend their legs, a system inherited from their pre-arthropod ancestors. Unlike insects, though, most aquatic crustaceans are biomineralized with calcium carbonate extracted from the water.|$|E
5|$|Instead of {{generating}} {{a set of}} woven source code, some AspectJ weavers instead weave the aspects and classes together directly into bytecode, acting both as the aspect weaver and compiler. While {{it is expected that}} the performance of aspect weavers which also perform the compilation process will require more computation time due to the weaving process involved. However, the bytecode weaving process produces more efficient runtime code <b>than</b> <b>would</b> usually be achieved through compiled woven source.|$|E

5|$|On 1 March 1927, Joseph Berchtold {{transferred}} {{leadership of}} the SS to Heiden, who was his acting deputy. Berchtold had become disillusioned by the SA's authority over the SS.

Under Heiden's leadership a stricter code of discipline was enforced <b>than</b> <b>would</b> have been tolerated in the SA ranks. Heiden further demanded that the men under his command were not to be involved in party matters which were none of their concern. His intention was to create a small elite unit and obtain higher quality recruits.|$|E
5|$|Rundgren {{had become}} {{confident}} enough at other instruments beyond his standard guitar and keyboards {{that he had}} tackled in earlier releases, and this, coupled with a general dissatisfaction with other studio musicians, led him to temporarily relocate to Los Angeles {{in an attempt to}} record an entire album single-handedly. After he had created significantly more material <b>than</b> <b>would</b> fit on a standard LP, an earthquake struck LA. He decided to head back to New York for some live sessions, with the help of Moogy Klingman, to lighten the mood. The final sessions were in Bearsville, where the remainder of the recording and mixing took place, and this created enough material for a double album.|$|E
5|$|Schreck, a {{founding}} member of the SA and a close confidant of Hitler, became the first SS chief in March 1925. On 15 April 1926, Joseph Berchtold succeeded him as chief of the SS. Berchtold changed the title of the office to Reichsführer-SS (Reich Leader-SS). Berchtold was considered more dynamic than his predecessor, but became increasingly frustrated by the authority the SA had over the SS. This led to him transferring leadership of the SS to his deputy, Erhard Heiden, on 1 March 1927. Under Heiden's leadership, a stricter code of discipline was enforced <b>than</b> <b>would</b> have been tolerated in the SA.|$|E
