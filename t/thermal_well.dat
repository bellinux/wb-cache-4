40|$|The {{subject of}} this thesis is the {{nondestructive}} assay (NDA) of nuclear materials.

Fission Multiplicity Detection (FMD) {{is the name of the}} standard technique used in NDA of nuclear materials in the 1960 s and 1970 s. It was characterized by the use of fast plastic scintillating detectors. These systems were used in both active and passive mode.

3000|$|Having a good {{estimation}} of geothermal gradient and the reservoir temperature {{has a great}} impact on the methodological reservoir management in the entire reservoir life, from natural depletion phase up to draining the last portion of hydrocarbon by applying an appropriate EOR method. This issue could become crucial in a gas condensate reservoir management as the reservoir temperature has great influence on the time and amount of precipitated condensate in the reservoir and on the surface. It is usual to consider a constant reservoir temperature throughout the field. Also, encountering a constant geothermal gradient, with a similar fluid in a reservoir, is expected. During drilling campaign of two appraisal wells (one in the crest and other in the flank) of one of Middle East gas reservoir, it is aproximately found one geothermal gas gradient in both well; however, with some displacement in the wells. To find out a scientific justification for this phenomenon, a study was set out and results were presented in this paper. By using the analytical solution to unsteady-state conduction heat transfer for a cylinder with a radius of r [...] m [...] and infinite length and the available temperature data from FBDSTs, the exact reservoir temperature at different depths is calculated. It is also shown that by using the analytical solution ‘affected <b>thermal</b> <b>well</b> bore radius’ can be estimated. The affected <b>thermal</b> <b>well</b> bore radius is defined as the radius that beyond it, formation rock is not affected by any down-hole temperature variation. Based on the elaborated work, in addition to confirmation of having one geothermal gradient in the reservoir, it is found out that the ‘affected <b>thermal</b> <b>well</b> bore radius’ in wells is about 20 – 60  cm. Also by using the basic steady-state conduction heat transfer equation and assuming that the amount of transferred heat via layers of earth is constant, it is qualitatively shown that having different reservoir temperatures at constant depth throughout a giant deep-reservoir is normal and it should be accounted for the reservoir simulation.|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} found through {{experiments}} at Southwest Research Institute that temperature differences between the gas and wall of the pipe through which the gas is flowing can greatly influence the gas flow in the pipe line and give different velocity magnitudes {{at the top and}} bottom half of the pipe. The effect on the flow is observed to worsen at low fluid flow and high temperature differences. This effect has been observed by ultrasonic flow meters which measure the chord average gas velocity at four heights across the pipe. A significant variance in chord averaged velocities is apparent at these conditions. CFD analysis was performed. Low flow velocities of 0. 1524 m/sec, 0. 3048 m/sec and 0. 6096 m/sec and temperature differences of 5. 5 oK, 13. 8 oK and 27. 7 oK were considered. When these conditions were imposed onto the three different geometries, it was seen that the heating caused increased errors in the ultrasonic meter response. For the single elbow and double elbow pipe configurations, the errors were below 0. 5 % for constant wall temperature conditions but rose to 1 % for sinusoid varying wall temperature conditions. The error was seen to increase as the axial velocity became more stratified due to momentum or temperature effects. The case of maximum error was noted for the double elbow geometry with sinusoid wall temperature condition where a swirl type of flow was noted to create localized velocity maxima {{at the center of the}} pipe. This part of the pipe was barely touched by the ultrasonic meter acoustic path giving maximum error of 1. 4 %. A <b>thermal</b> <b>well</b> was placed in the path of the gas flow in the pipe to observe the temperature response on the surface of the <b>thermal</b> <b>well.</b> It was noted that the <b>thermal</b> <b>well</b> surface temperature differed by 1. 4 % for most cases with gas velocity below 0. 6096 m/sec...|$|E

40|$|The current {{practice}} of nondestructive assay (NDA) of fissile materials using neutrons {{is dominated by}} the {sup 3 }He detector. This has been the case since the mid 1980 s when Fission Multiplicity Detection (FMD) was replaced with <b>thermal</b> <b>well</b> counters and neutron multiplicity counting (NMC). The <b>thermal</b> <b>well</b> counters detect neutrons by neutron capture in the {sup 3 }He detector subsequent to moderation. The process of detection requires from 30 to 60 {micro}s. As will be explained in Section 3. 3 the rate of detecting correlated neutrons (signal) from the same fission are independent of this time but the rate of accidental correlations (noise) are proportional to this time. The well counters are at a distinct disadvantage when there is a large source of uncorrelated neutrons present from ({alpha}, n) reactions for example. Plastic scintillating detectors, as were used in FMD, require only about 20 ns to detect neutrons from fission. One thousandth as many accidental coincidences are therefore accumulated. The major problem with the use of fast-plastic scintillation detectors, however, is that both neutrons and gamma rays are detected. The pulses from the two are indistinguishable in these detectors. For this thesis, a new technique was developed to use higher-order time correlation statistics to distinguish combinations of neutron and gamma ray detections in fast-plastic scintillation detectors. A system of analysis to describe these correlations was developed based on simple physical principles. Other sources of correlations from non-fission events are identified and integrated into the analysis developed for fission events. A number of ratios and metric are identified to determine physical properties of the source from the correlations. It is possible to determine both the quantity being measured and detection efficiency from these ratios from a single measurement without a separate calibration. To account for detector dead-time, an alternative analytical technique was also developed...|$|E

To achieve these purposes, waters from deep wells and springs in the Rovte area and waters from <b>thermal</b> <b>wells</b> and subthermal springs in the Cerkno/Kranj area were analysed. Hydrochemical analysis was done by spectrophotometry, ion chromatography and atom absorption spectrometry. Isotope analysis (δ 2 H and δ 18 O) was done with the automated Picarro L 2130 -i analyser. The wells Z (Zavčan), R (Rodofov Mlin) and B (Bizjakov Mlin) penetrate gypsum strata at a depth of several hundred meters. Thus, samples from wells Z and R show high SO 42 - concentrations and molar-Mg 2 +/Ca 2 +-ratios lower than 1. In contrast, water samples from surface springs show very low SO 42 - but high NO 3 - and Cl- concentrations. These samples are clearly impacted anthropogenically. The isotopes (δ 2 H and δ 18 O) of the wells Z and R are in the same range suggesting that the waters from Z and R derive from the same aquifer system. The Calculation of saturation indices with PHREEQC shows that most samples from the wells were supersaturated with respect to calcite and mostly undersaturated with respect to dolomite. Furthermore, the diagram of pH vs. SO 42 - concentration from Z and R show a negative correlation. This and the preferential removal of Mg 2 +, as suggested by the molar-Mg 2 +/Ca 2 +-ratios lower than 1, indicates that dedolomitisation might still be occurring. The hydrochemical analysis of the waters from <b>thermal</b> <b>wells</b> and subthermal springs revealed that a deep flow pattern exists in NW-Slovenia.

40|$|Thermal {{recovery}} by {{steam injection}} {{is considered to}} be a promising method for achieving a high ultimate recovery. A composite reservoir may occur during any enhanced oil recovery (EOR) project like steam injection into an oil reservoir. Thermal falloff test analysis offers a quick way to obtain an estimate of the swept volume and steam zone properties. Most of the models used for the analysis assume two regioncomposite reservoirs with different but uniform properties separated by a sharp vertical interface which is not very realistic. Numerical simulation study of steam injection in both vertical and horizontal wells (SAGD well pairs) was done to evaluate the applicability and accuracy of <b>thermal</b> <b>well</b> test analysis method and effects of several parameters on the results. Primary results showed that quite reasonable estimates were obtained. Some trends seen on the pressure plots, however, cannot be explained using the existing models and there are errors associated with the volume estimates that could be related to the simplifying assumptions of the conventional models. Therefore, the main objective of this PhD project is to develop a new analytical model for pressure transient analysis of composite reservoirs to improve previous models with inclusion of some parameters and more realistic assumptions. Two models are presented. In the models proposed, the interface separating the two regions is not sharp. Instead, there is an intermediate region between the inner and the outer region in which mobility and storativity decrease smoothly, as power-law functions of the radial distance from the first interface. The interfaces are considered to be tilted due to gravity effects. A single-layer model with continuous tilted front is assumed in the first model. In addition, tilted front is modeled using the conventional way of treating the gas override by assuming a multi-layer reservoir model in the second model of this study. Inclusion of steam condensation in the form of heat loss from the steam zone to the surroundings was first studied numerically with the conclusion that in the case of huge heat loss, pressure data are significantly affected and method of analysis should change. Heat loss effect is therefore included in the analytical models of this work. In another effort, a conventional multi-region model is improved to include the effect of gravity. This model with some modifications can finally match the models presented in this thesis within reasonable accuracy. The new sets of type curves for <b>thermal</b> <b>well</b> test interpretation are generated and verified against some conventional models. Effects of several parameters included in the models on the shape of type curves are discussed.

The thermocouple was checked in LN 2, in an ice water bath, and against an ordinary thermometer (which was assumed to be accurate to plus or minus 0. 3 C) at room temperature. The results are shown below in 'Table 1 ' By interpolation of the data, thermocouple error at - 31. 0 C was found to be 0. 43 C on the warm side. Since this error was small, it was ignored. 'Table 2 ' shows the results of the tests. Ten readings were taken with the switch wired in the 'normally open' mode. This results in a signal at room temperature. The worst deviation was 2. 5 C. Three readings were then taken from the 'normally closed' wiring arrangement (the way it will be wired for installation). The greatest deviation was 1. 2 C. The next day, the switch was checked five times wired in the 'normally open' configuration. The greatest error was 1. 1 C. A graph has been prepared showing the switching and resetting temperatures. The errors these tests bore out do not threaten the exhaust fan and are therefore acceptable...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In Situ Thermal Desorption (ISID) is a {{remediation}} {{process in}} which heat and vacuum are applied simultaneously to subsurface soils to vaporize and destroy contaminants in situ or transport them to the surface for additional treatment. The paper presents the largest commercial application of ISTD to date (covering about 3 / 4 acre) {{and was the first}} project to remediate contaminated soil underneath buildings by inserting <b>thermal</b> <b>wells</b> through the building floor. This was also the first ISTD application to specifically target the removal of free product from atop groundwater in addition to soil remediation. The site was treated with 761 <b>thermal</b> <b>wells</b> containing electric heaters installed to depths of 10 to 12 feet below ground surface on a triangular grid pattern with 7 -foot well spacing. Heating of the soil continued for nearly 120 days, during which time 6134 5 tons of hydrocarbons were removed from the soil and groundwater. All free product was removed and concentration of benzene, the primary constituent of concern, was reduced to below state regulatory levels in both soil and groundwater. Quarterly groundwater monitoring has confirmed the remedial effectiveness of the technology, and site closure is pending. The site was a former bulk fuel terminal located within a mixed commercial-residential neighborhood in Eugene, Oregon. The site was used for the storage and sale of bulk petroleum fuels from the 1920 s through early 1970 s (PEG, 1996). The facility was equipped with severa...|$|R
