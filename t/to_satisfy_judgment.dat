40|$|Since the {{commencement}} of the State Liability Act 20 of 1957 the (until 2011) prevailing legislation rendered it almost impossible <b>to</b> <b>satisfy</b> <b>judgment</b> debts sounding in money against the State. There has been a continuous struggle in South Africa “to reach a balance between State immunity from tort liability and government accountability to the State’s citizens”. The State Liability Amendment Act of 2011 (following on the Constitutional Court’s decision in Nyathi v MEC for Department of Health Gauteng 2008 5 SA 94 (CC)) will enable judgment creditors to obtain effective relief against the State.

50|$|Private {{property}} may {{be sold in}} {{a public}} auction {{for a number of}} reasons. It may be seized through a governmental process <b>to</b> <b>satisfy</b> a <b>judgment</b> rendered by a court or agency, or to liquidate a mortgage foreclosure, tax lien, or tax sale. Usually, prices obtained at a public auction <b>to</b> <b>satisfy</b> a <b>judgment</b> are distressed - that is, they are much lower than the price which would be obtained for that property if the seller were free to hold out for an optimal time to sell. In the United States, public auctions <b>to</b> <b>satisfy</b> <b>judgments</b> are usually conducted under the authority of the sheriff of the county or city in which the property to be auctioned was seized pursuant to the judgment, and an auction held for such a purpose is also called a Sheriff's sale.|$|R

50|$|In the High Court, {{there does}} not appear to be any rule {{prescribing}} when, after judgment, a writ may be issued.

2500|$|Following his dismissal, Garrett {{returned}} {{with his family}} to New Mexico. Garrett was in deep financial difficulty. His ranch had been heavily mortgaged, and when he was unable to make payments, the county auctioned off all of Garrett's personal possessions <b>to</b> <b>satisfy</b> <b>judgments</b> against him. The total from the auction came to only $650. President Roosevelt had appointed Pat's friend, George Curry as the territorial governor of New Mexico. Garrett met with Curry, who promised him the position of superintendent of the territorial prison at Santa Fe, once he was inaugurated. Since Curry's inauguration was still months away, the destitute Garrett left his family in New Mexico and returned to El Paso where he found employment with the real estate firm of H.M. Maple and Company. During this period Garrett moved in with a woman known as [...] "Mrs. Brown", who was described as an El Paso prostitute. When Governor-elect Curry learned of his involvement with Brown, the promised appointment of prison superintendent was withdrawn.|$|R

2500|$|The {{proposed}} book outraged the Goldman family, who {{criticized the}} publisher for [...] "helping a murderer get his voice out there." [...] According to lawyers for Ron Goldman's family, the Goldmans planned {{to attempt to}} garnish any earnings Simpson might get from the book. Fred Goldman, Ron's father, was awarded $33.5 million by a jury in 1997 for the wrongful death of his son. However, Simpson never paid this judgment due to a California law that prevents pensions from being used <b>to</b> <b>satisfy</b> <b>judgments,</b> {{and the fact that}} the bulk of his income comes from his NFL pension. Goldman described the book and television interview as [...] "an all-time low" [...] and [...] "morally reprehensible to me... to think you are willing to give somebody airtime about how they would murder two people." [...] Patricia Schroeder, president and chief executive of the Association of American Publishers, felt that the book would [...] "stir an awful lot of debate and make the culture take a real look at itself, and that may not be unhealthy".|$|R
