5|$|Germans viewed this clause as a {{national}} humiliation, forcing Germany to accept full responsibility for causing the war. German politicians were vocal in their opposition to <b>the</b> <b>article</b> <b>in</b> an attempt to generate international sympathy, while German historians worked to undermine the article {{with the objective of}} subverting the entire treaty. The Allied leaders were surprised at the German reaction; they saw the article only as a necessary legal basis to extract compensation from Germany. The article, with the signatory's name changed, was also included in the treaties signed by Germany's allies who did not view the clause with the same disdain as the Germans did. American diplomat John Foster Dullesone of the two authors of the articlelater regretted the wording used, believing it further aggravated the German people.|$|E

Professor Kenneth Pye, a defense witness, said that {{there was no evidence that}} the rock had ever been on the lake bed at all. <b>The</b> <b>article</b> <b>in</b> the Sunday Herald also claims that the policeman said to be responsible for finding the rock fainted when it was produced in court, offering no explanation, but still denying that he ever found it.|$|E
5|$|In the Summer of 1999, a {{group of}} volunteers worked to restore and clean up the {{cemetery}} {{that led to a}} ceremony in October 1999 with more than 60 people in attendance. <b>The</b> <b>article</b> <b>in</b> The Day highlighted the difficulty in finding the cemetery which is located {{on the banks of the}} Pachaug River, in the village of Glasgo, located in the town of Griswold. Iva Arpin said that the town would repair the stone walls and that the Children of the American Revolution would return in the spring to continue their work on the cemetery. In 2002, the cemetery had undergone a significant restoration which included the unearthing and accounting for all the burial markers that had been strewn about the grounds. Arpin noted that some of the stones showed signs of vandalism. The Day described how some of the marker stones and monuments were covered in nearly a foot of pine needles and that the roots had uprooted the anchor stones causing the headstones to fall and break.|$|E

25|$|Announcements of Red Cloud's {{death and}} {{recognition}} of his achievements were printed in major newspapers across the country. As had been typical of the US perception during Red Cloud's prominence in war, <b>the</b> <b>article</b> <b>in</b> The New York Times mistakenly described him as leader of all the Sioux bands and tribes, but noted his abilities as a leader and diplomat. While he was a prominent leader, the Lakota were highly decentralized and never had one overall leader, especially of the major divisions, such as Oglala and Brulé.|$|E
25|$|The JAACAP {{article on}} study 329 was never retracted. The journal's editors say the {{negative}} findings {{are included in}} a table, and that therefore there are no grounds to withdraw <b>the</b> <b>article.</b> <b>In</b> September 2015 the BMJ published a re-analysis of the study. This concluded that neither paroxetine nor imipramine had differed in efficacy from placebo in treating depression, that the paroxetine group had experienced more suicidal ideation and behaviour, and that the imipramine group had experienced more cardiovascular problems.|$|E

25|$|A Simpsons fan, Rob Baur of Lake Oswego, Oregon, was {{inspired}} by the episode. Remembering <b>the</b> <b>article</b> <b>in</b> a textbook, Baur cultivated real tomacco in 2003. The plant produced offspring that looked like a normal tomato, but Baur suspected that it contained a lethal amount of nicotine and thus would be inedible. Testing later proved that the leaves of the plant contained some nicotine. Both plants are members of the same family, Solanaceae or nightshade. The tomacco plant bore tomaccoes until it died after 18 months, spending one winter indoors. Baur appeared on the episode's DVD commentary, discussing the plant and resulting fame.|$|E
25|$|On April 24, 2006 The Independent, the Daily Star and The Times confirmed, {{following}} previous rumours, that K-9 {{would be}} featured in a 26-part computer-animated children's series, K-9, to be written by Bob Baker. <b>The</b> <b>article</b> <b>in</b> The Times also featured {{a picture of the}} redesigned K-9 for the animated series. Each episode will be 30 minutes long, made by Jetix Europe and London-based distribution outfit Park Entertainment. According to a report in Broadcast magazine, the BBC opted out of involvement in order to focus on Torchwood, meaning that BBC-owned characters are unlikely to appear in the series. K-9 Premiered October 31, 2009. The 26th and final episode aired September 25, 2010.|$|E
25|$|After the spy had {{returned}} to Sweden, Guillou in advance placed <b>the</b> <b>article</b> <b>in</b> a major newspaper and with a television news editor. He also contacted the Foreign Department {{in order to prevent}} official denials, and discuss the repercussions of the espionage exposure. The published article was a true 'scoop', and the CIA spy handler was ordered to leave Sweden together with a colleague. The spy himself, avoided prosecution thanks to the article's portrayal of him as a rather heroic journalist, exposing foreign illegal operations to the public. Afterwards, both he and Jan Guillou were interrogated by the Swedish Security Service, but for assumed political reasons, no criminal charges were made. This time, the system worked to the journalist's advantage.|$|E
