2500|$|An {{escalator}} is {{a moving}} staircase, a conveyor <b>transport</b> <b>device</b> for carrying people between floors of a building. Commonly found {{and used in}} shopping malls, department stores, airports, an escalator consists of a motor-driven chain of individual, linked steps that move up or down on tracks, allowing the step treads to remain horizontal. The escalator was invented in 1859 by Nathan Ames of Saugus, Massachusetts for an invention that he called [...] "Revolving Stairs". However, Ames' escalator was never built. The earliest form of a working escalator, patented in 1892 by Jesse W. Reno, was introduced as a new novelty ride at the Old Iron Pier at Coney Island, New York in 1896.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{describes}} a new {{continuously variable transmission}} (CVT) {{that may be used}} in a variety of machines and <b>transport</b> <b>devices.</b> Unlike many CVTs that are relatively heavy and bulky, the present CVT, named “eDrive”, is fairly small and lightweight. These attributes allow eDrive to be used in human-powered <b>transport</b> <b>devices</b> such as bicycles. The eDrive incorporates a sprocket able to vary its effective diameter via computer controlled actuation. The sprocket accommodates a rotational input and provides an output using a loop belt rotationally engaged with sprocket. The eDrive promises to increase a bicyclist's user experience, provide more efficient conversion of human energy to locomotion, and overall promote sustainable urban transportation. In addition, eDrive can be configured and scaled to provide CVT functionality for a variety of other vehicles and machines, such as wind or water turbines and electric vehicles...|$|R

50|$|Detachable reel {{magazines}} can {{be fitted}} (e.g. {{to enable the}} projection of nitrate film in accordance with safety regulations), or removed (e.g. to enable projection using an external film <b>transport</b> <b>device</b> such as a platter or tower, or to fit an external audio reader) as needed. Special fire trap rollers for nitrate were also available, to comply with fire regulations in some jurisdictions. Separate magnetic and analog optical audio heads are built into the mechanism itself, enabling all 5/70 magnetic and 4/35 optical formats to be projected without the need to adjust or replace any audio components. The change of gauge is done by swapping some gate components, pad roller assemblies, reel spindles and the lens, {{and in some cases}} making minor adjustments to the lamphouse. This procedure can be completed by a competent projectionist in 5-10 minutes, which is a major reason for the DP70's popularity with venues that show 4/35 and 5/70 prints interchangeably.|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} an electronic transport model and an implementation approach that {{respond to the}} challenges of device modeling for gigascale integration. We use the density-gradient (DG) transport model, which adds tunneling and quantum smoothing of carrier density profiles to the driftdiffusion model. We present the current implementation of the DG model in PROPHET, a partial differential equation solver developed by Lucent Technologies. This implementation approach permits rapid development and enhancement of models, as well as run-time modifications and model switching. We show that even in typical bulk <b>transport</b> <b>devices</b> such as P-N diodes and BJTs, DG quantum effects can significantly modify the I-V characteristics. Quantum effects are shown to be even more significant in small, surface <b>transport</b> <b>devices,</b> such as sub- 0. 1 µm MOSFETs.

5000|$|The Crack in Space is a 1966 {{science fiction}} novel by American writer Philip K. Dick. In the United Kingdom, {{it has been}} {{published}} under {{the title of the}} original novella, Cantata 140, published in the July 1964 issue of The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction. This original title refers to the short title in English, Sleepers Awake, of J.S. Bach's Cantata BWV 140 and the novel's 'bibs', the millions sleeping in suspended animation. Both are based on the short story Prominent Author. The common elements are the Jiffi-scuttler <b>transport</b> <b>device,</b> the company, Terran Development, that manufactures it (and still exists to play a large role in the later works), and a brief summary of Prominent Author as an event of the past in chapter 2.

Once Baxter Stockman assembled the Arc Capacitor, Krang immediately began assembling the Technodrome however, Krang had no second thoughts about betraying Shredder, freezing him and locking him away with his collection of other defeated foes.
