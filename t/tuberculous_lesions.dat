5000|$|Whitlockite {{can also}} be found in {{biological}} systems and has been implicated in several human diseases. Whitlockite can be found at many sites in the human body, but is particularly concentrated in calcified tissues, such as embryonic and adult bone. The highest concentrations of whitlockite appear in the weight bearing area of the femoral head. Traces of whitlockite have also been found in <b>tuberculous</b> <b>lesions,</b> urinary calculi and even prostatic deposits. Whitlockite {{can also be}} found in the oral cavity, where it is a primary component of dental calculi and salivary stones. Lastly, whitlockite can be found in aortic media, where it may be involved in arteriosclerosis. The presence of whitlockite at these places has not attracted much attention from biomedical scientists or clinicians, chiefly because whitlockite is not visible with the stains used to routinely examine microscopic sections of healthy or diseased tissue. However, the presence of whitlockite becomes obvious when X-ray diffraction is used to examine these sections. [...] In part, whitlockite occurs commonly in biologic systems because of the high concentrations of proteolipids and divalent cations in biologic fluids. Formation of this type of whitlockite is magnesium rich, and is preferred at temperatures typical of biologic systems because of the smaller diameter of the magnesium ion compared to calcium.|$|E

40|$|Background: Acid-fast bacilli (AFB) is {{not seen}} in all {{necrotic}} <b>tuberculous</b> <b>lesions.</b> If the subset of <b>tuberculous</b> <b>lesions</b> which yield positive result for AFB can be identified, it would save on time and manpower besides optimizing use of resources. A prospective study was undertaken to assess if presence of eosinophilic structures (ESs) in necrotic <b>tuberculous</b> <b>lesions</b> correlated {{with the presence of}} AFB. Materials and Methods: Patients referred for fine needle aspiration cytology for evaluation of lymphadenopathy between July 2012 and June 2013 were analyzed. The hematoxylin and eosin and May-Grünwald-Giemsa stained slides were screened for epithelioid cell granuloma, ES and necrosis and Ziehl Neelsen stained smears for AFB. Result: One hundred and eight tuberculous lymph nodes yielded necrotic material on aspiration. Four cytologic pictures were seen: (a) ES + AFB + in 58. 33 %, (b) ES + AFB− in 20. 37 %, (c) ES− AFB + in 9. 26 % (d) ES− AFB− in 12. 04 % cases. Overall AFB was found in 67. 59 % cases, out of which 58. 33 % correlated with the presence of ES while 9. 26 % were seen in smears without ES. Conclusion: Presence of ESs {{should be included in the}} morphological description of <b>tuberculous</b> <b>lesions.</b> In the absence of granulomas, they indicate tuberculous nature of the lesion. Presence of ES mandates a search for AFB as probability of finding AFB is high in such lesions. Significance of ES lies in their presence and not in their absence.

However, in Zambia, these diseases are mainly diagnosed at abattoirs during routine meat inspection. Albeit the coinfection status, these diseases have been reported {{as nothing more than}} normal separate findings without an explanatory phenomena. Forthwith, we formulated this study to assess the possible association of the two diseases in a known high prevalence area on the Kafue basin ecosystem. Of the 1, 680 animals screened, 600 (35. 7 %; 95 % CI 33. 4 %– 38 %) and 124 (7. 4 %; 95 % CI 6. 1 %– 8. 6 %) had fasciolosis and tuberculous lesions; respectively, whilst 72 had both fasciola and <b>tuberculous</b> <b>lesions</b> representing 12 % (95 % CI 9. 4 %– 14. 6 %) and 58. 1 % (95 % CI; 49. 3 %– 66. 7 %) of the total positives for fasciola and tuberculosis, respectively. Jaundice was seen in 304 animals, 18. 1 % (95 % CI; 16. 3 %– 19. 9 %) and was significantly correlated to fasciolosis (r= 0. 59, P< 0. 0001). A significant association (χ 2 = 76. 2, df= 1, and P< 0. 0001) was found between fasciolosis and <b>tuberculous</b> <b>lesions.</b> Simple logistic regression intimated fasciolosis as a strong predictor for <b>tuberculous</b> <b>lesions</b> with animals that had fasciola being five {{times more likely to have}} <b>tuberculous</b> <b>lesions</b> (odds ratio = 4. 8, 95 % CI: 3. 3 – 7. 0).

Histopathological examinations revealed caseous necrosis, epithelioid cell granuloma, and multinucleated Langhans' giant cells, but no neoplastic cell was found. We confirmed that the mass was clinically compatible with tuberculoma. The characteristic presentation of the chest wall tuberculosis is abscess, which is frequently cystic, doughy, or soft.

In curatve effect, however, the treatment with streptomycin plus tuberculin surpassed that of INAH plus tuberculin. 2) The fact that, the antituberculous drugs showed an increased curative effect on tuberculosis, administered in combination with tuberculin, may be attributed, first, to the enrichment and localization of the drugs in <b>tuberculous</b> <b>lesion,</b> owing to the focal reaction to tuberculin, and, second, to the desensitizing effect of tuberculin which intensifies resistance in tuberculous animals...|$|R
