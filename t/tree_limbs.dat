5|$|October 8, 1996- The {{remnants}} of Tropical Storm Josephine cause 45mph (72km/h) wind gusts and light rainfall {{of up to}} 2.37inches (60mm) in Dover. The rainfall causes river flooding, while the wind knocks down <b>tree</b> <b>limbs.</b>|$|E
5|$|Females {{predominantly}} scent mark {{with their}} anogenital scent glands, by squatting to rub their anogenital region along horizontal surfaces, such as <b>tree</b> <b>limbs.</b> Males, {{on the other}} hand, favor using the glands on their neck, muzzle, and chest, by embracing horizontal and vertical surfaces and rubbing themselves over them. Both sexes will occasionally scent mark in ways characteristic of the opposite sex.|$|E

5|$|The {{effects of}} the {{hurricane}} were compounded by flooding caused by the remnants of Tropical Storm Henri days before. Moderate winds of up to 62mph (100km/h) downed numerous trees, <b>tree</b> <b>limbs,</b> and power lines across the state, leaving at least 15,300 without power. Numerous low-lying areas were flooded due to high surf, strong storm surge, or run-off from flooding further inland. The passage of Hurricane Isabel resulted in $40million in damage (2003USD, ($ USD)) and no casualties in the state.|$|E
5|$|Strong {{winds were}} also {{reported}} in New England. The highest winds associated with Daisy were felt over coastal Maine, where winds of 70mph (115km/h) were commonly reported. Wind damage was severe and widespread; {{one person in}} Maine was killed when a fallen tree landed on, and crushed his car {{while he was in}} it. In the southeastern portion of the state, power outages were reported, due to fallen trees and <b>tree</b> <b>limbs.</b> In addition, some roof shingles blown off in Maine and Massachusetts, while other houses were completely unroofed. Daisy caused moderate to severe damage in eastern New England. Total wind damage in New England was estimated to have reached $500,000.|$|E
5|$|The {{effects of}} the {{hurricane}} in Delaware were compounded by flooding caused by the remnants of Tropical Storm Henri days before. Moderate winds of up to 62mph (100km/h) in Lewes downed numerous trees, <b>tree</b> <b>limbs,</b> and power lines across the state, leaving at least 15,300 without power. Numerous low-lying areas were flooded due to high surf, strong storm surge, or run-off from flooding further inland. The passage of Hurricane Isabel resulted in $40million in damage (2003USD, $ USD) and no casualties in the state.|$|E

5|$|The extratropical {{remnant of}} Alberto {{produced}} strong winds across the Canadian Maritimes, including gusts of 74mph (119km/h) in the Barrington district of Nova Scotia. Sustained winds reached 51mph (83km/h). Rainfall {{from the storm}} was moderate, with some locations reporting 0.4inches (10mm) per hour; totals exceeded 2inches (50mm) in numerous areas. Due to wet grounds, the winds knocked down some trees and several <b>tree</b> <b>limbs,</b> and also downed some power lines, causing localized power outages. Moderate winds and rainfall affected Newfoundland, as well. According to a press report, the storm left four sailors missing about 230miles (370km) south of Nova Scotia.|$|E
5|$|The {{remnants}} of Beryl dropped moderate precipitation in Atlantic Canada, officially peaking at 2.8inches (71mm) in Scots Bay, Nova Scotia with an unofficially higher total of 3.5inches (88mm); in some locations 1inch of rain fell in an hour. Additionally, a station in Fredericton, New Brunswick reported 1.77inches (45mm) in twohours. The rainfall caused some flooding, with some overflown streams flooding some streets. Moderate winds were reported along its path, which peaked at 60mph (96km/h) in southern Nova Scotia. The winds downed some <b>tree</b> <b>limbs</b> {{and led to}} some power outages. Overall damage was minor.|$|E
5|$|Additional traits {{shared with}} other {{prosimian}} primates (strepsirrhine primates and tarsiers) include a bicornuate (two-horned) uterus and epitheliochorial placentation. Because their thumbs are only pseudo-opposable, making their movement less {{independent of the}} other fingers, their hands are less than perfect at grasping and manipulating objects. On their feet, they have a widely abducted hallux (first toe) which facilitates the grasping of <b>tree</b> <b>limbs.</b> A common misconception is that lemurs have a prehensile tail, a trait found only in New World monkeys, particularly atelids, among primates. Lemurs also rely heavily on their sense of smell, a trait shared with most other mammals and early primates, {{but not with the}} visually oriented higher primates. This sense of smell is important in terms of marking territory as well as provide an indication of whether or not another lemur is a viable breeding partner.|$|E

5|$|During the storm, roughly 50,500 people {{sought refuge}} in shelters set {{up across the}} country. Throughout the Philippines, 47 people {{were killed by the}} typhoon, mostly from drowning. Sixteen of these {{fatalities}} occurred in Isabela Province, where Elsie made landfall. Heavy rains triggered several landslides across mountainous areas of the country. High winds also created deadly air-borne debris, including roofing and <b>tree</b> <b>limbs.</b> Downed power lines across the northern provinces left most of Luzon without power. Officials stated that about 61,300 homes were either damaged or destroyed by Elsie in the Philippines. In the wake of the typhoon, roughly 332,000 people were left homeless. Damages sustained by agriculture amounted to 105million PHP ($2,253,702 USD). In all, Typhoon Elsie killed 47 people and injured 363 others in the Philippines, and left roughly $35.4million in damages.|$|E
5|$|Gloria's {{high winds}} downed {{numerous}} trees across New England, causing minor to moderate damage. In the region, Connecticut received {{the worst of}} the hurricane, where tree and structural damage was greatest. Along the coastline, storm surge and strong waves washed away several fishing piers, and some roadways were underwater during the storm's passage. New Hampshire was affected only slightly from the hurricane, and was limited to minor wind damage and localized flooding. In Maine, damage was more severe, where strong wind gusts ripped off roofs and uprooted hundreds of trees. High winds across New England resulted in significant power outages, leaving 250,000 in Maine. In all, seven deaths occurred in New England, many of which occurred from falling <b>tree</b> <b>limbs.</b>|$|E
5|$|Hours after Humberto made landfall, Rick Perry {{declared}} Galveston, Jefferson, and Orange counties as disaster areas, which allocated {{state resources}} {{to assist the}} affected residents. The governor applied for a presidential disaster declaration on September 21. Four Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) teams assessed the hurricane damage in the three most affected counties. Following their assessment, they determined that {{the damage caused by}} Humberto was not significant enough to require a disaster declaration. As such, Governor Rick Perry's request from FEMA was denied. Across the Bolivar Peninsula, an estimated 1,500 cubic yards of structural debris and 3,000 cubic yards of <b>tree</b> <b>limbs</b> were needed to be removed {{in the wake of the}} storm.|$|E
2500|$|Brachiation (from brachium, Latin for [...] "arm"), {{is a form}} of {{arboreal}} locomotion {{in which}} primates swing from <b>tree</b> <b>limb</b> to <b>tree</b> <b>limb</b> using only their arms. During brachiation, the body is alternately supported under each forelimb. This is the primary means of locomotion for the small gibbons and siamangs of southeast Asia. Some New World monkeys such as spider monkeys and muriquis are [...] "semibrachiators" [...] and move through the trees with a combination of leaping and brachiation. Some New World species also practice suspensory behaviors by using their prehensile tail, which acts as a fifth grasping hand.|$|R
50|$|Sedley Alley, a {{civilian}} {{married to an}} enlisted member of the military, abducted Collins {{late in the evening}} of July 11, 1985 while she was jogging on the base. He took her to nearby Edmund Orgill Park. Once there he beat her multiple times, fracturing her skull, before repeatedly shoving a <b>tree</b> <b>limb</b> up her vagina with enough force to penetrate her abdomen and tear one of her lungs. The autopsy would state that Collins died from blunt force trauma to the head and internal hemorrhaging from the <b>tree</b> <b>limb.</b> He then ditched the body and fled the scene.|$|R

5|$|Isa first {{affected}} Pohnpei as {{a tropical}} storm on April 12. While passing near the island, the storm produced moderate winds across the island, peaking at 95km/h (60mph). The winds downed several trees and <b>tree</b> <b>limbs</b> which destroyed 40% of the island's power lines. A few buildings reported roof damage. About 15% of the crops on Pohnpei were damaged, including losses to the banana and breadfruit crops. After {{the passage of the}} typhoon, President of the Federated States of Micronesia Jacob Nena declared Pohnpei as a major disaster area due to the damage from Typhoon Isa and subsequent flooding; on April 20 heavy rainfall caused widespread mudslides and 19fatalities on the island, though they were not related to Isa.|$|E
5|$|Moderate wind gusts {{throughout}} the state downed hundreds of trees, <b>tree</b> <b>limbs,</b> and power lines. Over 382,000people were without power, {{one of the worst}} power outages on record for area utilities. Downed trees and power lines closed major streets and schools in Union County. One downed tree greatly damaged a house in Middletown, and in Hudson County several trees fell onto and damaged cars. A downed tree in Englewood injured a woman when she was struck, and a woman in Independence Township was killed when a fallen tree landed on the vehicle she was driving. Strong winds from Isabel blew out the windows in an office building in East Rutherford, causing injuries to two women when they were struck. Throughout the state, damage totaled to about $50million (2003USD, $59million 2008USD).|$|E
5|$|Wind gusts reached 60mph (95km/h) {{in northeastern}} Pennsylvania, {{resulting}} in scattered reports of downed trees and power lines. Tens of thousands were left without power. A few downed trees hit cars and houses, with damage totaling about $350,000 (2003USD, $410,000 in 2008USD). The fallen trees also closed some roads. In the central {{portion of the}} state, the storm dropped moderate precipitation of over 3inches (75mm), while wind gusts reached 73mph (117km/h) at a station in Lancaster County. The combination of the wind gusts and moist grounds from previous rainfalls resulted in hundreds of downed <b>tree</b> <b>limbs,</b> primarily in Dauphin and Lancaster Counties. Lancaster County reportedly suffered the worst wind damage since Hurricane Hazel in 1954.|$|E

5|$|After {{the storm}} {{moved into the}} western Atlantic, the Miami U.S. Weather Bureau issued storm {{warnings}} for the North Carolina coastline from Wilmington to Cape Hatteras; the region was warned to prepare for strong winds. The agency also issued a small craft advisory southward through Charleston, South Carolina. Offshore, the storm produced winds of up to 85mph (140km/h), as well as waves up to 35feet (10m) in height. The combination of the winds and rough waves drove a freighter ashore along Portsmouth Island in the Outer Banks, after the engine was damaged when water entered the fuel line. The 26person crew initially planned to evacuate, but they later decided {{to stay on the}} freighter as the U.S. Coast Guard were deployed to assist. The seas damaged a portion of the ship, but the entire crew was rescued without any injuries. The storm later brushed New England, bringing rain, fog, warmer temperatures, and gusty winds. The combination resulted in downed power poles and <b>tree</b> <b>limbs,</b> leaving 10,000houses without electricity.|$|E
5|$|Electricians had power {{restored}} to the Freeport area by {{the day after the}} storm, and had power {{restored to}} most of the western portion of the island within three weeks after the hurricane. Work crews quickly removed road debris and <b>tree</b> <b>limbs,</b> and by the day after the passage of Wilma most roads were cleared. The passage of the hurricane left 1,000–4,000people and hundreds of animals homeless. In response, the Grand Bahama Humane Society distributed about 340kg (750lb) of dog food and treated or euthanized injured animals, depending on their condition. The earlier effects of Wilma on Mexico left many tourist areas in that country closed, leading to a 10% increase in tourism in the Bahamas in December 2005. By about three weeks after the hurricane, the airport on Grand Bahama Island was reopened, and all but one resort were also reopened; the remaining resort was reopened about two months after the hurricane.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to rain and flooding, winds damaged more homes and businesses, and a tornado was spawned {{a few miles}} southwest of Port Arthur. More than 19,000power outages were reported in the area near where Bonnie made landfall. Texas State Highway 87 was closed in Jefferson County due to debris and electrical poles fallen on the roadway. The storm left broken windows, scattered <b>tree</b> <b>limbs,</b> and debris filled streets in Port Arthur and Beaumont. At the latter, strong winds toppled a radio tower at the Texas Department of Public Safety building, while several schools suffered damage to the roof and windows. Marinas and boats at Lake Sam Rayburn were damaged. Hank Creek Marina, located across the lake, broke free from its moorings and floated away, while portions of were submerged. Four indirect fatalities were confirmed in Texas, two from traffic accidents, one from a house fire ignited by a candle, and another from drowning. Several injuries were also reported, including four after a truck flipped over due to strong winds.|$|E
