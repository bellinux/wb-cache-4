5|$|Philosophie Zoologique ("Zoological Philosophy, or Exposition with Regard to the Natural History of Animals") is an 1809 book by the French naturalist Jean-Baptiste Lamarck, {{in which}} he {{outlines}} his pre-Darwinian <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>evolution</b> now known as Lamarckism.|$|E
5|$|As {{biologists}} define macroevolution, both microevolution and macroevolution {{have been}} observed. Speciations, for example, have been directly observed many times, despite popular misconceptions to the contrary. Additionally, the modern evolutionary synthesis draws no distinction in the processes {{described by the}} <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>evolution</b> when considering macroevolution and microevolution as the former is simply at the species level or above and the latter is below the species level. An {{example of this is}} ring species.|$|E

5|$|Epicurus (341 – 270 BC) {{anticipated}} {{the idea of}} natural selection. The Roman philosopher and atomist Lucretius (c. 99 – 55 BC) explicated these ideas in his poem De rerum natura (On the Nature of Things). In the Epicurean system, {{it was assumed that}} many living forms had been spontaneously generated from Gaia in the past, but that only the most functional forms had survived to have offspring. The Epicureans did not anticipate the full <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>evolution</b> as we now know it, but seem to have postulated separate abiogenetic events for each species.|$|E
5|$|Finally, {{the motives}} they {{suggested}} for a forgery are not strong, and are contradictory; {{one is that}} Richard Owen wanted to forge {{evidence in support of}} Charles Darwin's <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>evolution,</b> which is unlikely given Owen's views toward Darwin and his theory. The other is that Owen wanted to set a trap for Darwin, hoping the latter would support the fossils so Owen could discredit him with the forgery; this is unlikely because Owen wrote a detailed paper on the London specimen, so such an action would certainly backfire.|$|E
5|$|In the {{so-called}} modern {{synthesis of the}} early 20th century, Ronald Fisher brought together Darwin's <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>evolution,</b> with its insistence on natural selection, heredity, and variation, and Gregor Mendel's laws of genetics into a coherent structure for evolutionary biology. Biologists assumed that an organism was a straightforward reflection of its component genes: the genes coded for proteins, which built the organism's body. Biochemical pathways (and, they supposed, new species) evolved through mutations in these genes. It was a simple, clear and nearly comprehensive picture: {{but it did not}} explain embryology.|$|E

5|$|Saltationism was {{the idea}} that new species arise as a result of large mutations. It was seen as a much faster {{alternative}} to the Darwinian concept of a gradual process of small random variations being acted on by natural selection, and was popular with early geneticists such as Hugo de Vries, William Bateson, and early in his career, Thomas Hunt Morgan. It became the basis of the mutation <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>evolution.</b>|$|E
5|$|Similarly, it {{is argued}} that {{evolutionary}} theory is circular reasoning, in that evidence is interpreted as supporting evolution, but evolution is required to interpret the evidence. An example of this is the claim that geological strata are dated through the fossils they hold, but that fossils are in turn dated by the strata they are in. However, in most cases strata are not dated by their fossils, but by their position relative to other strata and by radiometric dating, and most strata were dated before the <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>evolution</b> was formulated.|$|E

The medal was first awarded to Alfred Russel Wallace, a noted biologist and naturalist who had independently developed the <b>Theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>Evolution</b> by Natural Selection.|$|E
50|$|Much of 19th-century {{classical}} {{social theory}} has been expanded upon to create newer, more contemporary social theories such as multilineal <b>theories</b> <b>of</b> <b>evolution</b> (neoevolutionism, sociobiology, <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> modernization, <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> post-industrial society) and various strains of Neo-Marxism.|$|R
50|$|In {{the history}} <b>of</b> <b>theories</b> <b>of</b> <b>evolution,</b> the {{proposed}} genetic memory of an individual's experiences and environmental influences {{was a central}} part of Lamarckism to explain the inheritance of evolutionary changes.|$|R

5|$|The Late Jurassic Archaeopteryx is {{well known}} as one of the first {{transitional}} fossils to be found, and it provided support for the <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>evolution</b> in the late 19th century. Archaeopteryx was the first fossil to display both clearly traditional reptilian characteristics: teeth, clawed fingers, and a long, lizard-like tail, as well as wings with flight feathers similar to those of modern birds. It is not considered a direct ancestor of birds, though it is possibly closely related to the true ancestor.|$|E
5|$|The {{town has}} been the birthplace and home to notable people, of {{national}} and international acclaim. Former residents include British radio disc jockey Tony Blackburn, the artist Augustus John, John Lennon's aunt and parental guardian Mimi Smith, and The Lord of the Rings author J. R. R. Tolkien who lived in Poole for four years during his retirement. Alfred Russel Wallace, the 19th century explorer, naturalist and co-formulator of the <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>evolution</b> by natural selection, moved to Poole in 1902 when he was 78 years old and is buried in Broadstone cemetery.|$|E
5|$|Though {{evolution}} is not progressive, it does sometimes proceed in a linear way, reinforcing characteristics in certain lineages, but such examples are entirely {{consistent with the}} modern neo-Darwinian <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>evolution.</b> These examples have sometimes {{been referred to as}} orthoselection but are not strictly orthogenetic, and simply appear as linear and constant changes because of environmental and molecular constraints on the direction of change. The term orthoselection was first used by Ludwig Hermann Plate, and was incorporated into the modern synthesis by Julian Huxley and Bernard Rensch.|$|E

5|$|A central {{organizing}} {{concept in}} biology is that life changes and develops through evolution, {{and that all}} life-forms known have a common origin. The <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>evolution</b> postulates that all organisms on the Earth, both living and extinct, have descended from a common ancestor or an ancestral gene pool. This universal common ancestor of all organisms {{is believed to have}} appeared about 3.5 billion years ago. Biologists regard the ubiquity of the genetic code as definitive evidence in favor of the theory of universal common descent for all bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes (see: origin of life).|$|E
5|$|Charles Darwin {{had argued}} that {{humanity}} evolved in Africa, because this is where great apes like gorillas and chimpanzees lived. Though Darwin's claims have since been vindicated by the fossil record, they were proposed without any fossil evidence. Other scientific authorities disagreed with him, like Charles Lyell, a geologist, and Alfred Russel Wallace, who had thought of the <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>evolution</b> {{around the same time}} as Darwin. Because both Lyell and Wallace believed that humans were more closely related to gibbons and orangutans, they identified Southeast Asia as the cradle of humanity because this is where these apes lived. Dutch anatomist Eugène Dubois favored the latter theory, and sought to confirm it.|$|E
5|$|Darwin {{published}} his <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>evolution</b> with compelling evidence in his 1859 book On the Origin of Species, overcoming scientific rejection of earlier concepts of transmutation of species. By the 1870s, {{the scientific community}} {{and much of the}} general public had accepted evolution as a fact. However, many favoured competing explanations and {{it was not until the}} emergence of the modern evolutionary synthesis from the 1930s to the 1950s that a broad consensus developed in which natural selection was the basic mechanism of evolution. Darwin's scientific discovery is the unifying theory of the life sciences, explaining the diversity of life.|$|E
