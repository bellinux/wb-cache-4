[...] "Therefore we have been forced to come to the conclusion that your story, incredible as it appeared, is a true one. That you, a youth and a foreigner, should have had the incredible levity to act in the way you describe, and to assume the disguise of a person absolutely unknown to you, upon the persuasion of a woman also absolutely unknown to you, well-nigh passes belief. Had you been older you would at once have been sent to the frontier; but as it is, the Czar, to whom the case has been specially submitted, has graciously allowed you to continue your residence here, the testimony being unanimous as to your father's position as a merchant, and to the prudence of his behaviour while resident here. But I warn you, Godfrey Bullen, that escapades of this kind, which may be harmless in England, are very serious matters here. Ignorantly, I admit, but none the less certainly, you have aided in the escape of a malefactor of the worst kind; and but for the proofs that have been afforded us that you were a mere dupe, the consequences would have been most serious to you, and even the fact of your being a foreigner would not have sufficed to save you from the hands of justice. You are now free to depart; but let this be a lesson to you, and a most serious one, never again to mix yourself up in any way with persons of whose antecedents you are ignorant, and in future to conduct yourself in all respects wisely and prudently." ...|$|E

She eventually came back to the Commonwealth Film Unit, and with her family in mind, she opted to work as a freelance scriptwriter rather than a full-time employee. However, as mentioned during her interview with Marie Knuckey, it was a decision that was frowned upon by certain people in her entourage: ¨What they said to my face was only a fraction of what they said to my back - you still get people who criticize the fact <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>work</b> … No one questions a man's right to work or that his career should go on.

5000|$|In July 2010, the Rhode Island Board of Economic Development {{approved}} a $75 million guaranteed loan to 38 Studios. 38 Studios promised to bring 450 {{jobs to the}} state {{by the end of}} 2012. In May 2012, 38 Studios defaulted on its loan from the state of Rhode Island and failed to meet payroll obligations to its employees. 38 Studios and its subsidiary, Big Huge Games, then laid off their staffs with a mass email. Some of the laid-off employees may have second mortgages because the company had not actually sold homes for them as part of a relocation package. Some have accused Schilling of hypocrisy based on the conflict between his professed views on [...] "big government" [...] and the studio's relationship with [...] "big government". On November 1, 2012, Schilling was sued by the state in connection with the loan. Governor Lincoln Chafee said: [...] "My message to Rhode Islanders is this: I know <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>work</b> hard for your paychecks, and for your tax dollars to be squandered is unacceptable.

5000|$|Moi Peter Julius, {{who was a}} {{political}} reporter for a South Sudanese newspaper The Corporate, was found murdered late {{on the night of}} August 19, 2015 in a residential area of Juba after being shot twice from behind. His murder was committed three days after Kiir publicly and officially threatened journalists, stating that “freedom of the press does not mean <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>work</b> against your country. If anybody does not know that this country will kill people, we will demonstrate on them.” Earlier in 2015, five journalists by the names of Musa Mohamed (the director of the state-run radio station Raja FM), Adam Juma (reporter and presenter for Raja FM), Dalia Marko and Randa George (reporters for Raja FM), and Boutros Martin (a cameraman for the Western Bahr el Ghazal of South Sudan Television) had been murdered while traveling as part of a convoy, along with six other people. Tom Rhodes of the Committee to Protect Journalists stated after the murders that [...] "The murder of five journalists is a devastating attack on South Sudan's already beleaguered press corps," [...] and that [...] "We urge Western Bahr el Ghazal authorities to do their utmost to identify the perpetrators and bring them to justice, and to ensure journalists are allowed to carry out their duties safely." [...] At present, none of the parties responsible for ordering the murders or perpetrators of the crimes have been arrested, charged, or convicted.|$|E
5000|$|Sharapova's next tournament was {{the first}} major of the year, the Australian Open, an event she had {{previously}} won in 2008. She was seeded third and was defending heavy points from the previous years semifinal, which she lost in straight sets to Li Na. Sharapova began her title bid against American Bethanie Mattek-Sands and prevailed 6-3, 6-4. She then faced Italian Karin Knapp in the second round and ultimately won 6-4, 4-6, 10-8, in a match that lasted for almost three and a half hours. Following the match, the tournament was criticized from some quarters, for allowing the match to continue under the closed roof on Rod Laver Arena, despite play being stopped on all other courts due to the tournaments Extreme Heat policy. Sharapova later played down the complaints stating [...] "I think you just get numb to heat, it just doesn't faze you any more. I'm happy - these are the matches <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>work</b> for." [...] Next, Sharapova had a much easier time in the third round, defeating French 25th seed Alizé Cornet in straight sets 6-1, 7-6.

Sharapova had won the first set 6-3, but the lost the next two sets to be eliminated from the competition. Sharapova's ranking fell two places to world #5 after the tournament.|$|E
5000|$|Kierkegaard is {{wondering}} if one generation can learn wonder, love, anxiety, peace, patience, hope, {{from a previous}} generation or if each [...] "single individual" [...] in each generation must learn these things, for the most part, on their own. He {{asked the same question}} in Philosophical Fragments about how someone learns to become a Christian. Are we Christian because of our family and personal history or because we have made a [...] "decisive resolution"? What kind of goods is the Christian looking to gain? Isn't hope a good and despair an evil in yourself <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>work</b> to change into the good called hope? Isn't patience a good and impatience an evil that can be changed if you want to change it? Isn't your soul a good? Is the soul given to the chosen few or is it given as a free gift to all, without merit? [...] Is our future a matter of fate, of choice, or a combination of both? Kierkegaard answers this way: [...] If a person does not first make clear to himself the meaning of “self,” it is of no use to say of sin that it is selfishness. Only when the concept of the particular is given can there be any talk of selfishness, however, no science can say what the self is without stating it quite generally. And this is the wonder of life, that each man who is mindful of himself knows what no science knows, since he knows who he himself is, and this is the profundity of the Greek saying know yourself, which too long has been understood in the German way as pure self-consciousness, the airiness of idealism. It is about time to seek to understand it in the Greek way, and then again as the Greeks would have understood it if they had possessed Christian presuppositions. However, the real “self” is posited only by the qualitative leap. In the prior state there can be no question about it. Therefore, when sin is explained by selfishness, one becomes entangled in indistinctness because, on the contrary, it is by sin and in sin that selfishness comes into being. *Søren Kierkegaard, The Concept of Anxiety, Nichol p. 78-79 ...|$|E
