5|$|Those {{who engage}} in self-harm face the {{contradictory}} reality of harming themselves {{while at the same}} time obtaining relief from this act. It may even be hard for some to actually initiate cutting, but they often do because they know the relief that will follow. For some self-harmers this relief is primarily psychological while for others <b>this</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> relief comes from the beta endorphins released in the brain. Endorphins are endogenous opioids that are released in response to physical injury, act as natural painkillers, and induce pleasant feelings and would act to reduce tension and emotional distress. Many self-harmers report feeling very little to no pain while self-harming and, for some, deliberate self-harm may become a means of seeking pleasure.|$|E

25|$|This Oamaru Hotel {{is one of}} Lawson's {{more adventurous}} forays into {{classical}} architecture. Forsaking Palladian-influenced temple-like columns and porticos, he initially took as his inspiration the mannerist palazzi, which were {{a reaction to the}} more ornate high renaissance style of architecture popular in early 16th century Italy. There are even some minor similarities between this building and the Palazzo del Te. Just as at street level the palazzi often have a ground floor of rusticated stone, so did this hotel. Massive blocks of ashlar were used to create an impression of strength, supporting the more delicately designed floor above; <b>this</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> strength was further enhanced by double pilasters serving merely to imply a need to support the great weight above.|$|E
25|$|In 1979, Ronald Reagan {{visited the}} NORAD command base, Cheyenne Mountain Complex, {{where he was}} first {{introduced}} to the extensive tracking and detection systems extending throughout {{the world and into}} space. However, he was struck by their comments that while they could track the attack down to the individual targets, there was nothing one could do to stop it. Reagan felt that {{in the event of an}} attack this would place the president in a terrible position, having to choose between immediate counterattack or attempting to absorb the attack and then maintain an upper hand in the post-attack era. Shultz suggests that <b>this</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> helplessness, coupled with the defensive ideas proposed by Teller a decade earlier, combined to form the impetus of the SDI. In the fall of 1979, at Reagan's request, Lieutenant General Daniel O. Graham, the former head of the DIA, briefed Reagan on a concept he called the High Frontier, a missile shield composed of multi-layered ground- and space-based weapons that could track, intercept, and destroy ballistic missiles, which would theoretically be possible because of emerging technologies. It was designed to replace the MAD doctrine that Reagan and his aides described as a suicide pact. In September 1981, Graham formed a small, Virginia-based think tank called High Frontier to continue research on the missile shield. The Heritage Foundation provided High Frontier with space to conduct research, and Graham published a 1982 report entitled, “High Frontier: A New National Strategy” that examined in greater detail how the system would function.|$|E

In the royal cemetery, while other monarchs are given the inscription [...] "King of the Hellenes, Prince of Denmark", Alexander's reads [...] "Alexander, son of the King of the Hellenes, Prince of Denmark. He ruled in the place of his father from 14 June 1917 to 25 October 1920." [...] According to Alexander's favorite sister, Queen Helen of Romania, <b>this</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> illegitimacy was also shared by Alexander himself, a sentiment that helps explain his mésalliance with Aspasia Manos.|$|E
500|$|The song, if not {{the title}} alone, {{was a source of}} {{irritation}} for those critics who deemed Living in the Material World overly preachy and didactic. In a full-page album review in Melody Maker, Michael Watts summarised his impression of Harrison's spiritual message: [...] "One gets <b>this</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> George, somewhat remote and rarefied, indicting the world for being what it is, although if anybody could change the world it would be an old Beatle." [...] While noting the song as an autobiographical statement on the singer's [...] "struggle to retain personal dignity and peace of mind", Watts wrote: [...] "He's dealing in lofty sentiments and abstractions; not everyone will want to drink of the cup." ...|$|E

Will is often {{very hard on}} Jake (dating {{all the way back}} to their childhood, when Jake sold the family cow to an old man in exchange for [...] "magic beans" [...] instead of money for a doctor; resulting in their sickly younger sister's death) berating and ordering him around. Will is somewhat of a womanizer and wants to make money, whereas Jake is more interested in fairy tales and adventures. Jake feels that Will doesn't care about or believe in him; but even into their adulthood, Will is still very pained by the loss of their sister and blames Jake's belief in magic and happy endings for her death. <b>This</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> resentment is compounded with Will's intense desire to protect Jake, at times from himself.|$|E

500|$|Philip Andelman {{directed}} the music video for [...] "Lips Are Movin". It was filmed in Los Angeles. It premiered on Trainor's Vevo account on November 19, 2014. Trainor told [...] MTV News, [...] "Here's me being sassy {{and other people}} dancing with me and having just {{a good time and}} trying to get through <b>this</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>of,</b> Ugh he's cheating on me again". The video was commissioned by information technology corporation Hewlett-Packard. It features several [...] "influencers"—actors, dancers and set designers with large social media followings. The influencers featured in the video include set designer Bri Emery; actors Marcus Johns, Cody Johns, and Robby Ayala; YouTube star Liza Koshy; dancers Les Twins; Spanish stylist Sara Escudero; hair stylist Kristin Ess; Japanese nail artist Mei Kawajiri; American dancer Chachi Gonzales; and Pomeranian dog Barkley the Pom. Andelman suggested showcasing behind-the-scenes events occurring during a music video shoot, which was used as the video's theme. Trainor's team asked the ad agency 180LA to make the music video similar to [...] "All About That Bass" [...] and not stray too far from it.|$|E
500|$|The show's writers {{spent time}} researching local California {{politics}} and attending Los Angeles City Council meetings. Schur said they observed that many community hearings were attended only by those opposed, often angrily, to the proposals under consideration. This confirmed his existing impression: [...] "I've been to some community meetings in my life, {{and it is}} often <b>this</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> utter sparseness. That nobody cares." [...] The depiction of public hearings in several Parks and Recreation episodes was inspired by this perspective, which was also {{the basis for the}} entire [...] "Canvassing" [...] episode. Schur asked urban planners in Claremont, California, whether efforts to turn a construction pit into a park could realistically take several months or longer. They told him that was entirely plausible, and that they had recently broken ground on a park that had been in various planning stages for 18 years. Schur said the pit project was conceived as a device to bring all the characters together, which was partially inspired by the way various characters in The Wire were brought together to work toward a common goal or project. The writers originally envisioned the pit becoming a park only in the series finale, although those plans were later changed and the pit was filled in during the second season.|$|E

500|$|In the 1996 musical, Evita, Madonna {{played the}} title role of Eva Perón. For a long time, Madonna had desired to play Perón and wrote to {{director}} Alan Parker to explain why she would be perfect for the part. She said later, [...] "This is the role I was born to play. I put everything of me into this because {{it was much more}} than a role in a movie. It was exhilarating and intimidating at the same time. And I am prouder of Evita than anything else I have done." [...] After securing the role, she had vocal training and learned about the history of Argentina and Perón. During shooting she became ill several times due to the intense emotional effort required. However, as she told Oprah Winfrey, she was also pregnant during the filming: [...] "I was winded after every take. I had to lie on the couch every ten minutes so I could recover from dizzy spells, I was worried that I was shaking the baby around too much and that would injure it in some way." [...] Madonna wrote in her personal diary at the time: [...] "Ironically, <b>this</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> vulnerability and weakness is helping me in the movie. I'm sure Evita felt this way every day of her life once she discovered she was ill." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{first draft}} of the script portrayed Leslie and Mark as {{slightly}} less likable characters. Originally, Mark asked Ron to green-light the park project not to help Leslie, but because he was attracted to Ann and wanted another excuse to keep seeing her. These elements of the script were changed after press tours and focus group screenings. The show's writers spent time researching local California politics and attended Los Angeles City Council meetings. Daniels and Schur wanted the pilot to establish that one of Leslie's duties {{was talking to the}} public on a regular basis, and they deliberately portrayed her public forum meetings as poorly attended except by a select group of angry residents. Schur said, [...] "I've been to some community meetings in my life, and it is often <b>this</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> utter sparseness. That nobody cares." [...] In writing the script, Schur wanted Mark and Leslie to have a long history together before the events of the episode, rather than having the two characters meet {{for the first time on}} screen, which he felt had already been done in many television shows. The first shot of the pilot was originally a scene with Ann standing over the pit and staring at it with an annoyed expression, followed by a documentary interview with Ann and Andy. The opening scene was changed because Daniels and Schur decided they wanted the first scene of the series to be set in a park. As a result, the episode started with a cold open of Leslie interviewing children in a park, then using a broom to push a drunk man out of spiral slide. Daniels had such a specific vision for the scene, he drew an elaborate and detailed storyboard sketch of a drunk man stuck in a tubular slide.|$|E

According to Picard, <b>this</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> certainty may be caused by a dysfunction of the anterior insula, a part of the brain which is involved in interoception, self-reflection, and in avoiding uncertainty about the internal representations of the world by [...] "anticipation of resolution of uncertainty or risk".|$|E
