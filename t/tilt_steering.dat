40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the consequences on the physical workload of new solutions in the forklift cab environment for the driver by quantifying the physical workload on the neck, shoulders, arms and wrists as an effect of steering systems. Twelve male subjects conducted identical test cycles with three types of steering: normal, tilted and miniature. The physical load on the drivers was evaluated using goniometry, inclinometry and electromyography. No major differences were detected when comparing the normal to the <b>tilted</b> <b>steering</b> wheel. The miniature steering wheel showed, in comparison to the normal steering wheel, lower velocity for the right and left wrists, lower elevation and lower velocity for the left upper arm, a reduction in load on the right trapezius muscle, respectively, and most noticeably a 6 -fold increase in the "static" load and a 10 -fold decrease in the time for rest/recovery for the left wrist extensor muscles. The <b>tilted</b> <b>steering</b> wheel did not have any significant effect on the workload. However, the effects of the miniature steering wheel indicate an increased risk for over exertion resulting in disorders of the wrist and forearm for the left side. Relevance to industry: When introducing new techniques or changes in technical systems, it is essential to evaluate the effects on the human workload with objective measurements...|$|R
25|$|The {{interior}} of the Supra had optional power windows and power locks {{as part of the}} convenience package. The convenience package also included cruise control and special door trim with door pull straps, with an optional sunroof. As for standard features, in the center console there was an extendable map light and a flip-top armrest, which provided storage. Some other features were the <b>tilt</b> <b>steering</b> wheel, deep zippered pockets {{on the backs of the}} front seats, and a tonneau cover under the liftback. The dashboard also contained a state of the art AM/FM/MPX 4-speaker stereo radio, analog clock, and tachometer as part of the instrument panel.|$|E
25|$|On the inside, this {{generation}} had standard power windows, power door locks, and power mirrors {{as well as}} a <b>tilt</b> <b>steering</b> wheel. The power door lock was located in the center console next to the power mirror control. The analog dash of this year only went to 85mph (140km/h) in North America. The optional automatic climate control was renovated and was now seen as a standard feature on the A60. Cruise control was standard in {{this generation}}. Toyota also included the retractable map light as standard. Some options included the addition of a sunroof, two-tone paint schemes, and a five-speaker AM/FM/MPX tuner with cassette. The optional cassette stereo featured a 105-watt power amplifier and a seven-band graphic equalizer. The standard stereo was a five-channel AM/FM/MPX tuner. Leather was an option on L-types of this year, but P-types were limited to standard striped cloth.|$|E
25|$|Buick's largest, plushest {{and most}} {{expensive}} models were restyled for 1963, with distinctive rear fenders {{culminating in a}} sharp vertical edge housing narrow back-up lights. The taillights were horizontally placed in the vertical deck cove. A unique cast grille was used at the front. Bright wheelhouse and lower body moldings, with ribbed rear fender panels were used. Red-filled Electra 225 badges {{were found on the}} rear fenders, while four VentiPorts lent status to the front fenders. Interiors were cloth and vinyl combinations, while a Custom interior in vinyl and leather, with front bucket seats and a storage console, was available for the convertible and sport coupe.

Buick dropped the Riviera name as a body style designation after the 1963 model year, shifting the Riviera name exclusively to Buick's new personal luxury coupe that had been introduced in 1963. Buick added a 7-way <b>tilt</b> <b>steering</b> wheel and a new cruise control as an option.|$|E
50|$|The CJ-7 {{featured}} {{an optional}} new automatic all-wheel drive system called Quadra-Trac, {{as well as}} a part-time two-speed transfer case; an automatic transmission was also an option. Other features included an optional molded hardtop, and steel doors. The CJ-7 was also available in Renegade and Laredo models. Distinguished by their different body decals, the Laredo model featured highback leather bucket seats, a <b>tilting</b> <b>steering</b> wheel and a chrome package that included the bumpers, front grill cover, and side mirrors. An optional Trak-Lok rear differential was available too. Axle ratio was typically 3.54, but later went up to 3.73.|$|R
5000|$|Mitsubishi {{launched}} GL Satellite limited {{editions of}} the GN series in c. October 1986, adding air conditioning, unique striping, headlamp protectors, front and rear mudflaps, <b>tilt</b> adjustable <b>steering</b> column, remote control tailgate (for wagons) and side mirrors.|$|R

25|$|In the 2004 model year, the XG350 {{received}} larger front brakes (discs {{went from}} 10.9- to 12-inch), {{which in turn}} required a 16-inch spare tire as standard equipment, replacing the 'space-saver' design used since 2001. Also new this year were restyled front and rear bumpers, bodyside moldings, headlights (now with HID availability), driving lights, tail lamps, grille, and deck lid with recessed license plate holder. The high-mounted stop lamp in the rear window went to an all-new LED design. The interior wood-tone trim changed to a lighter shade, glove compartment and storage bins were now covered in charcoal gray material (formerly black), the door-mounted power window switch panels now matched the interior color (previously, they were high-gloss wood-tone), recessed seat tethers allowed for secure installation of child seats in all three rear seat positions, and the trunk hinges were now supported using hydraulic pistons. Standard equipment leather upholstery was available in solid deep charcoal or a two-tone finish featuring a tan interior with brown dashboard/center console and upper door trim. The L versions were equipped with specific 12-spoke silver-painted allow rims featuring center caps covering the lug nuts. Minor equipment changes inside included redesigned levers for the hood release and <b>tilt</b> <b>steering</b> column, an updated cruise control switch, a recessed trunk pull-down handle, and leather trim around the console armrest tray.|$|E
25|$|VAM's {{decision}} to focus all {{efforts on the}} new two-version Lerma model plus the loss of luxury accessories meant the discontinuation of Rally SST for 1982. The loss of the exemption of 500 units of automobile engines without emission certification forced the retirement of the Rally GT. The only model left for 1982 was the Rally AMX, with substantial differences from the previous two years. The taillight surrounding areas plus the headlight bezels and front hood molding were completely blacked out, the last two parts also having a horizontal red stripe passing from edge to edge. An all-new grille design with a horizontal bar {{at the same height}} of the bezels' division between the parking lights and headlights and a vertical bar at the very center; behind these was a set of smaller narrower horizontal lines. Both bumpers for the year were those of the AMC Eagle SX/4 Sport, being blacked out equipped with thick nerfing strips with central bright moldings and longer more aerodynamic bumper end caps with their respective bright molding. Unlike the previous two years, no decals or stickers of any kind were used. The standard wheel designs for the year were the eight spoke steel units with blacked out volcano hubcaps. Due to the impossibility of having the bullet-type door mirrors reproduced, the model switched to sporty design that was used in the 1978–1980 models. However, the remote controls for these mirrors while still available were moved to the option list. The Recaro-type seats received new patterns with a smaller bucket shape to allow an easier {{in and out of the}} car in the driver's side (due to the lack of a <b>tilt</b> <b>steering</b> column). The door panels were the same units as in 1981 except for the change in the fabric portion from plain to a pattern of vertical stripes and the removal of a fake chrome molding in place of a woodgrain unit. The six-bolt sports steering wheel was replaced by a leather-wrapped three-arm Nardi unit. VAM managed to find a local company to reproduce the center console, but it was reduced to the shifter and gauges portions, deleting the armrest with the rear ashtray. Despite the loss in accessories, two new options arrived for the year in the form of the AM FM stereo tape player radio and the rear wiper and washer. The car received two changes in the mid year, the first being a new wooden sports steering wheel and the second a new set of ten-round-spoke steel wheels. Mechanically, the only novelties for the year were wider gear ratios for the A998 automatic transmission and in the mid year a new head design with rounded internal intake ports and smaller spark plug outlets, still retaining the metal valve cover of the previous years. A different head gasket was used to bring the compression ratio from 8.0:1 to 8.5:1.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "Limited": Available in 1979–1980, the Limited had leather seats, extra sound proofing, and deeper-pile carpet (18-oz. vs. the {{standard}} 12-oz) as standard, plus amenities that were otherwise options, including: AM radio, power door locks, power windows, and <b>tilt</b> <b>steering</b> wheel. The exterior had chrome accents, styled road wheels, and [...] "Limited" [...] badging.|$|E
50|$|For the E170 Corolla model, the {{transmission}} is an {{electric power steering}} system offering improved directness and weight; an electric rack and pinion system eliminates an accessory driven hydraulic steering system, reducing parasitic loss. The components of the <b>tilt,</b> telescopic <b>steering</b> structure help improve steering rigidity, and reduce vibration. A more structurally rigid intermediate shaft increases the direct feel of steering. Steering measures 3.19 turns total.|$|R
50|$|Some {{differences}} {{have been reported}} between the 1998 and the 2000 version such as the ECU software on the 2000 version that seems to provide better gearbox performances and longer life to the gearbox.

2500|$|The Lerma is introduced, an {{original}} adaptation combining VAM American sedan with {{the rear of}} the smaller Rally creating a line of two- and four-door hatchbacks in a European style. The VAM American for 1981 in high trim included as standard equipment a rear defroster, reading dome lights, intermittent wipers, dual remote controlled mirrors, and AM/FM stereo radio. The option list now added a <b>tilt</b> <b>steering</b> column and power seats. All units had the AMC-designed Spirit grille for the year along with fan shroud and coolant recovery tank as standard equipment regardless of the presence of the air conditioning system. Appearance changes included [...] "Noryl" [...] wheel covers for the high trim versions. The base models were upgraded, and ordering any of the three body styles with automatic transmission now included as standard equipment: a quartz digital clock, retractable seat belts, tinted windshield, parcel shelf, full light group (except reading dome light), woodgrain panels applied on the dashboard, wheel trim rings, full bright molding package (hood, rocker panels, wheel lips, drip rails), and protective rubber side moldings aside from the already existing power steering and bumper guards. This meant a mid-range model between the standard basic units and the GFS/ECD/DL ones. This created for the first time an automatic base wagon that was not a DL. However, despite this change, VAM did not create any designation or distinction for the new better-equipped base models. In 1981 and 1982 there were four versions of the station wagon model: base manual, base automatic, basic DL, and equipped DL.|$|E

All high-trim Americans for 1982 were no longer available with power door locks, power windows, power trunk release, <b>tilt</b> <b>steering</b> column, quartz digital clock, and rear defroster. Items that were standard for 1981 such as the remote controls for the door mirrors, the intermittent wipers, the reading dome light, and vanity mirror were put on the option list. The rest of the equipment was virtually unchanged from 1981. Despite this, {{there was a new}} optional accessory for the year, an AM/FM/stereo tape player radio. All three high-trim editions featured a new VAM-designed luxurious grille with a rectangular pattern, while the three base models used AMC's square-pattern design borrowed from U.S. market Eagle models. The GFS, ECD and DL models also got a set of plain VAM-designed bumper end caps with a chrome molding on the top side edge. Along with these, AMC's Eagle nerfing strip design was also used in both bumpers. The headlight bezels changed to blacked out units in their internal sections keeping the chromed surrounding areas. All-new aluminum road wheels also replaced the previously-imported Noryl wheel covers. A unique version of the year was the American ECD, which featured a lengthened and squared rear roofline with smaller and more rectangular C-pillar windows that had a small [...] "ECD" [...] sand-blasted logo. Other changes were black rear side window surrounds for the American DL wagon that were originally created by AMC for the Eagle models, while the American GFS had plain side window panels.

40|$|The {{lateral force}} of a tyre is a {{function}} of the sideslip and camber angles. The camber angle can provide a significant effect on the stability of a vehicle by increasing or adjusting the required lateral force to keep the vehicle on the road. To control the camber angle and hence, the lateral force of each tyre, we can use the caster angle of the wheel. We introduce a possible variable and controllable caster angle in order to adjust the camber angle when the sideslip angle cannot be changed. As long as the left and right wheels are steering together according to a kinematic condition, such as Ackerman, the sideslip angle of the inner wheel cannot be increased independently to alter the reduced lateral force because of weight transfer and reduction of the normal load F z A variable caster mechanism can adjust the caster angle of the wheels to achieve their top capacity and maximise the lateral force, when needed. Such a system would potentially increase the safety, stability, and maneuverability of the vehicles. Using the screw theory, this paper will examine the kinematics of a variable caster and present the required mathematical equation to calculate the camber angle as a function of suspension mechanism parameters and other relevant variables. Having a steered wheel about a <b>tilted</b> <b>steering</b> axis will change the position and orientation of the wheel with respect to the body of the car. This paper provides the required kinematics of such a suspension and extracts the equations in special practical situations.
