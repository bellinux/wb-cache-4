5|$|The South financed a {{much lower}} {{proportion}} of its expenditures through direct <b>taxes</b> <b>than</b> the North. The share of direct taxes in total revenue for the North was about 20%, while for the South the same share was only about 8%. A {{major part of the}} reason why tax revenue did not play as large a role for the Confederacy was the individual states' opposition to a strong central government and the belief in states' rights which precluded giving too much taxing power to the government in Richmond. Another factor for not extending the tax system more broadly was the belief, present in both the North and the South, that the war would be of limited duration, and hence there was no compelling reason to increase the tax burden.|$|E
5|$|Although {{he belonged}} to a prestigious family, Cofresí was not wealthy. In 1818 he paid 17 maravedís in taxes, {{spending}} {{most of his time}} at sea and earning a low wage. According to historian Walter Cardona Bonet, Cofresí probably worked in a number of fishing corrals in Boquerón Bay. The corrals belonged to Cristóbal Pabón Dávila, a friend of municipal port captain José Mendoza. This connection is believed to have later protected Cofresí, since Mendoza was godfather to several of his brother Juan Francisco's children. The following year he first appeared on a government registry as a sailor, and there is no evidence linking him to any other jobs in Cabo Rojo. Although Cofresí's brothers were maritime merchants and sailed a boat, Avispa, he probably worked as an able fisherman. On December 28, 1819 Cofresí was registered on Ramona, ferrying goods between the southern municipalities. In addition, her frequent voyages to the Mona Passage and Cofresí's recognition by local residents indicate that he occasionally accompanied Avispa That year, Cofresí and Juana lived in Barrio del Pueblo and paid higher <b>taxes</b> <b>than</b> the previous year: five reales.|$|E

40|$|Assuming {{constant}} marginal cost, it {{is shown}} that a switch from specific to ad valorem taxation {{has no effect on}} the critical discount factor required to sustain collusion. This result is shown to hold for Cournot oligopoly as well as for Bertrand oligopoly when collusion is sustained with Nash-reversion strategies or optimal-punishment strategies. In a Cournot duopoly model with linear demand and quadratic costs, it is shown that the critical discount factor is lower with an ad valorem <b>tax</b> <b>than</b> with a specific tax. However, in contrast to Colombo and Labrecciosa (2013), it is shown that revenue is always higher with an ad valorem <b>tax</b> <b>than</b> with a specific tax...|$|R

25|$|In {{any given}} time period, the {{government}}’s budget can be either in deficit or in surplus. A deficit occurs when the government spends more than it taxes; and a surplus occurs when a government taxes more than it spends. MMT states that {{as a matter of}} accounting, it follows that government budget deficits add net financial assets to the private sector. This is because a budget deficit means that a government has deposited more money into private bank accounts than it has removed in taxes. A budget surplus means the opposite: in total, the government has removed more money from private bank accounts via <b>taxes</b> <b>than</b> it has put back in via spending.|$|E

Towns may choose to engage in zoning or provide more services, however, overlapping with those provided by the county.

2500|$|Studies of refugees' {{impact on}} native welfare are scant but the {{existing}} literature shows a positive fiscal impact and mixed results (negative, positive and no significant effects) on native welfare. A 2017 National Bureau of Economic Research paper found that refugees to the United States pay [...] "$21,000 more in <b>taxes</b> <b>than</b> they receive in benefits over their first 20 years in the U.S." [...] An internal study by the Department of Health and Human Services under the Trump administration, which was suppressed and not shown to the public, found that refugees to the United States brought in $63 billion more in government revenues than they cost the government. According to labor economist Giovanni Peri, {{the existing literature}} {{suggests that there are}} no economic reasons why the American labor market could not easily absorb 100,000 Syrian refugees in a year. Refugees integrate more slowly into host countries' labor markets than labor migrants, in part due to the loss and depreciation of human capital and credentials during the asylum procedure.|$|E

50|$|During 2015, {{payroll taxes}} were levied {{on the first}} $118,500 of income; {{earnings}} above that amount were not taxed. Approximately 6% of workers earned over this amount in 2011. Because of this limit, people with higher incomes pay a lower percentage of <b>tax</b> <b>than</b> people with lower incomes; the payroll tax is therefore a regressive tax.|$|R
2500|$|Taxes {{other than}} the income tax (for example, taxes on sales and payrolls) tend to be {{regressive}}. Hence, making the income tax flat {{could result in a}} regressive overall tax structure. Under such a structure, those with lower incomes tend to pay a higher proportion of their income in total <b>taxes</b> <b>than</b> the affluent do. The fraction of household income that is a return to capital (dividends, interest, royalties, profits of unincorporated businesses) is positively correlated with total household income. Hence a flat tax limited to wages would seem to leave the wealthy better off. Modifying the tax base can change the effects. [...] A flat tax could be targeted at income (rather than wages), which could place the tax burden equally on all earners, including those who earn income primarily from returns on investment. [...] Tax systems could utilize a flat sales tax to target all consumption, which can be modified with rebates or exemptions to remove regressive effects (such as the proposed FairTax in the U.S.).|$|E
2500|$|Unlike Septembrist {{initiatives}} that were {{centered on the}} district capitals, many of Cabral's programs affected {{the people of the}} country's interior [...] directly. Cabral's moves once again decentralized government, placing the costs of health care, public finances and other sectors onto the tributary network, reinvoking the medieval system and subordinating local governmental authority. Two other initiatives, the forbidding of church burials and land assessment, were directly worrisome to the rural population, who were fearful of the government seizing their land rights. The revolt that occurred around the middle of April 1846 was similar to one that had occurred in Galicia, and involved a popular uprising in the parish of Fontarcada, Póvoa de Lanhoso. Although the revolt included both men and women, it was known as the Revolution of Maria da Fonte, because women were active involved in this rural uprising: armed with carbines, pistols, torches, and stakes, the peasantry assaulted municipal buildings, burned land records, stole property and even attacked a garrison from Braga. Some even declared themselves Miguelistas, but rather for being in opposition to encroachments by the state and the imposition of <b>taxes</b> <b>than</b> as a political affirmation.|$|E
2500|$|As governor, {{serving a}} term from 1926 to 1930, Byrd pushed through {{constitutional}} amendments that streamlined {{the state government}} and allowed for more efficient use of tax dollars. He also made property taxes solely a county responsibility. When {{it was obvious that}} increased spending on road construction was not enough to [...] "get Virginia out of the mud," [...] he pushed through a secondary roads bill that gave the state responsibility for maintaining county roads. These measures made Byrd seem like a New South progressive at first. However, many of his measures were more to the benefit of rural areas more interested in low <b>taxes</b> <b>than</b> better services. He instituted a [...] "pay as you go" [...] approach to spending, in which no state money was spent until enough taxes and fees came in to pay for it. Highways and tourism were his primary pursuits, says his biographer. [...] "He advocated building roads to state shrines such as Jamestown and Monticello and called for historical markers along roadways, the first of which appeared in Fredericksburg. He held regional meetings to bring about closer cooperation between state and county road officials, prophesying that the road system could be completed within ten years through such cooperation... A tour of the highway system convinced him of the progress being made in extending the arterial network. Indeed, over 2,000 miles would be added to the system during Byrd's governorship, 1,787 of these miles in 1928. Road building was one way to keep the voters happy and prove the efficacy of pay-as-you-go." ...|$|E
