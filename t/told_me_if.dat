2500|$|Orchard {{testified that}} during the Cripple Creek strike, when {{he thought that the}} union was not {{rewarding}} him enough, he had contacted railroad detective D. C. Scott and warned that some men would try to derail a train. The detectives paid him $20, and arranged safe passage for him through the National Guard lines where union men were not permitted. Orchard's contacts were Scott and K.C. Sterling, a CCMOA detective. Sterling had previously admitted the goal of blaming such violence on the Western Federation of Miners.p.119,125 Orchard recalled that [...] " [...] <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> I ever got into trouble with the militia to let him know."p.119 Detective Scott, in fact, had taken direct orders from General Sherman Bell,p.229 and Major Ellison testified that Sherman Bell had been implicated in an earlier plot to [...] "hold up or shoot" [...] working miners just four months prior to the Independence Depot explosion.|$|E

I had offers from the USA and Qatar but I {{wanted to be part}} of a new {{beginning}} for the sport in India. As for the conditions, we all know about them — but I'm ready and training hard. I like the pressure," [...] he said, making it clear that the USA and Qatar hardly excited him as much as India. Pirès is a regular at Arsenal's training ground, using the facilities to stay fit, and said that he spoke to Arsène Wenger about playing in India: [...] "He <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> you have it in you and if you have the passion to go play in India, then do it. And I think I'm ready." [...] "The reception at the airport was amazing," [...] he said, on his unveiling in India, before adding, [...] "Thank you for the welcome India... and the spicy food." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Gimme Shelter DVD {{contains}} extensive {{excerpts from}} that broadcast. A Hells Angels member who {{identified himself as}} [...] "Pete, from Hells Angels San Francisco" [...] (most likely Pete Knell, president of the San Francisco chapter), says [...] "they offered us $500 worth of beer (to) go there {{and take care of}} the stage ... we took this $500 worth of beer to do it." [...] Sonny Barger, who also called into the KSAN forum, states: [...] "We were told by one of the (other Hells Angels) clubs if we showed up down there (and) sat on the stage and drink some beer ... that the Stones manager or somebody had bought for us." [...] In his lengthy call, Barger mentions the beer deal yet again: [...] "I ain't no cop, I ain't never going to ever pretend to be no cop. I didn't go there to police nothing, man. They <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> I could sit on the edge of the stage so nobody could climb over me, I could drink beer until the show was over. And that's what I went there to do." ...|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, Jim Kaat earned {{rave reviews}} {{for his role}} as CBS' backup analyst (which flashed a {{considerable}} [...] "good-guy air"). Ron Bergman wrote of Kaat's performance during the 1990 ALCS, [...] "This was a night for pitchers to excel. Dave Stewart. Roger Clemens. Jim Kaat [...]" [...] Despite the rave reviews, Jim Kaat admitted that he was frustrated. He felt that at that point and time, the idea of figuring out what to talk about during a three-hour broadcast had become intimidating. As a result, Kaat would bring notes into the booth, but in the process, found himself providing too much detail. He ultimately confided in his broadcasting partner, Dick Stockton, that he wanted to work without notes. So Stockton hooked Kaat up with then-lead NFL on CBS color commentator, John Madden for a telephone seminar. Madden said if he brought notes into the booth he felt compelled to use them and would [...] "force" [...] something into a telecast. On his seminar with John Madden, Jim Kaat said [...] "Then John <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> he did his homework it would be stored in his memory bank. And if it is important it will come out. If it doesn't, it probably wasn't that important." ...|$|E
2500|$|Zina {{recorded}} in her autobiography {{that when she}} was eighteen she was courted by Henry Bailey Jacobs. During this time, Joseph Smith, also taught her about plural marriage in private conversations; he proposed that she become his spiritual wife on at least three different occasions. Zina declined the proposals out of her respect for Emma Smith and for traditional Christian monogamy, and because such a union would require secrecy. On March 7, 1841, she married Jacobs, believing she had thus avoided future proposals from Smith. Nauvoo mayor John C. Bennett conducted the ceremony. Her journal from the day of the wedding reads: I was Married to Mr. Henry Bailey Jacobs. He had been a missionary preaching the Gospel for some time. His Father Henry Jacobs {{was one of the first}} elders in the Church, faithful and true until the last.Zina become pregnant shortly after her marriage. However, she continued to feel concern that she had rejected God by rejecting Joseph, whom she considered a prophet and God's spokesperson. Later she recorded, [...] "I received a testimony for myself from the Lord of this work, and that Joseph Smith was a prophet of God before I ever saw him, while I resided in the state of New York, given in answer to prayer. I knew him in his lifetime, and know him to have been a great true man and a servant of God." [...] Smith wrote to her in October 1841 that he had [...] "put it off till an angel with a drawn sword stood by me and <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> I did not establish that principle [...] upon the earth I would lose my position and my life." [...] She and Smith were married on October 27, 1841. [...] Her brother Dimick performed the ceremony. [...] By that time, Joseph was married to five other women, besides his first wife Emma: Fanny Alger, Louisa Beaman, Lucinda Pendleton Morgan, Nancy Marinda Johnson Hyde, and Clarissa Reed Hancock.|$|E

2500|$|Upon arrival, Bree {{was shown}} as a polite and sensitive, well trained doctor, sharply {{contrasting}} her sister Brooke (Beth Allen). The character made friends quickly and appeared overly generous. However, as the character developed, {{it was revealed}} she too had a nasty side and {{was a lot more}} similar to Brooke than originally thought. Blampied enjoyed playing the personality change, labelling it as; [...] "making a great descent" [...] and stating; [...] "It's a massive change from how the character arrived and through her relationship with Brooke and Vinnie, it goes haywire. I'm looking forward to the challenge of how to justify those decisions she makes." [...] Bree's manipulative persona was blamed on her [...] "tumultuous upbringing" [...] which saw her be fostered by several families before being adopted at 10. As a result, she suffered from self-consciousness. Blampied enjoyed playing such a complex character, stating: [...] "It's definitely a lot more interesting than always being the nice guy because you do get to say and do some things you would never do and it's the furthest thing from my personal character and demeanor, so it is quite a turnaround." [...] Blampied went on to explain her mixed opinions of Bree: [...] "I obviously don't agree with what she's doing. Sometimes I read the script and go, 'Why are you doing that? There are a hundred easier ways to do that.' I have days where I really don't like Bree and what she's doing." [...] The character has been described as [...] "conniving" [...] and [...] "scheming". Blampied did not at first realise how manipulative Bree was to become and when she realised the extent to which writers were pushing her antagonistic characterisation, she described it as [...] "daunting". However Blampied had been warned, [...] "Someone <b>told</b> <b>me,</b> <b>if</b> you're on Shortland Street, always play your character as if you have a secret – because you will have a secret!" [...] To portray Bree's penultimate breakdown, Blampied researched borderline personality disorder and severe narcissism. Blampied enjoyed how Bree was portrayed in her final scene, stating: [...] "We don't often see Bree's vulnerable side side and when we do she's still being manipulative and deceitful ... I really like the way she ends up because {{there is an element of}} real sadness to it ... when she realises how wrong she's been." [...] Blampied cared for her character and hoped for an uneventful future for Bree, [...] "I'd like to see her get well, hold down a job and maybe even get into a relationship. Life is hard for her and always has been. I care about Bree and I know that sounds like a weird thing to say." [...] Describing Bree upon her return, Blampied stated, [...] "She's still mentally very fragile, and her manipulative tendencies are most definitely still at the surface", but affirmed, [...] "she's a lot more aware now though".|$|E
