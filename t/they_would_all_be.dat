5|$|Isabella {{is accused}} of driving a stolen van and taken into custody, while the other {{survivors}} reunite for safety. After Nora is decapitated by malfunctioning elevator doors, the group leaves to track down Isabella, who has gone into labor at the police station, while the policeman on duty rushes Isabella {{to the hospital in}} her van. Along the way they discover they have all cheated death twice; {{had it not been for}} the survivors of Flight 180 <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>all</b> <b>be</b> dead, which explains why the survivors are dying in reverse. Since Thomas saved Kimberly from being hit by the truck, she is last on Death's list.|$|E
5|$|Philip, {{disappointed}} by the spoils in Mysia, proceeded south and plundered the towns and cities of Caria. He invested Prinassus, which held out bravely at first, but when Philip set up his artillery, he sent an envoy into the city offering to let them leave the city unharmed or <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>all</b> <b>be</b> killed. The citizens decided to abandon the city. At this stage in the campaign, Philip's army {{was running out of}} food, so he seized the city of Myus and gave it to the Magnesians in return for food supplies. Since the Magnesians had no grain, Philip settled for enough figs to feed his whole army. Subsequently, Philip turned north in order to seize and garrison the cities of Iasos, Bargylia, Euromus and Pedasa in quick succession.|$|E
25|$|After the {{conclusion}} of the Rwandan genocide, the new Rwandan government was having difficulty prosecuting approximately 130,000 alleged perpetrators of the genocide. Originally, perpetrators of the genocide were to be tried in the ICTR (International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda); however, the vast number of perpetrators made it highly improbable that <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>all</b> <b>be</b> convicted.|$|E

50|$|When a comet or {{asteroid}} collides at a {{high rate}} of speed interplanetary with the surface of Mars it creates a primary impact crater. The primary impact may also eject significant numbers of rocks which eventually fall back to make secondary craters. The secondary craters may be arranged in clusters. All of the craters in the cluster would appear to be equally eroded; indicating that <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>all</b> <b>are</b> of the same age. If these secondary craters formed from a single, large, nearby impact, then <b>they</b> <b>would</b> have formed at roughly the same instant in time. The image below of Dennin Crater shows a cluster of secondary craters.|$|R

25|$|Before the Indépendance, the Cubists {{infiltrated}} {{the placement}} committee {{to make sure}} <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>all</b> <b>be</b> shown as a group. Le Fauconnier, {{the secretary of the}} salon, facilitated the goal of hanging their works together. Until then, works had been placed according to alphabetical order of the artists names. In Room 41 hung works by Gleizes, Metzinger, Léger, Delaunay, Le Fauconnier and Archipenko. In room 43 hung works by André Lhote, Roger de La Fresnaye, André Dunoyer de Segonzac, Luc-Albert Moreau and André Mare.|$|E
25|$|The {{fighting}} lasted {{nearly an}} hour. During the foray, Private Tucker attempted {{to rescue the}} captain, but the latter told the former to save himself. Just then, Jones was struck {{in the chest and}} killed. After that, Lujan went to Kirchner and told him that they had unknowingly crossed into Mexico and that they had better leave now because the villagers had sent word to the Mexican Army. Unwilling to leave his captain behind, Kirchner and his men fought it out for the next forty-five minutes before they realized that if the Mexicans were able to flank and surround them then <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>all</b> <b>be</b> killed. Accordingly, the Americans fought their way back across the Rio Grande and made it to the small town of Clint, where news of the engagement was relayed to Sheriff Frank B. Simmons in El Paso.|$|E
25|$|In 1985, three Israeli IAI Arava 201 {{transport}} aircraft were purchased and {{from at least}} 2013 all three were not in service. The Defence White Paper 2013 stated an intention to return two into service by 2014, however, the Commander PNGDF Statement of Intent for 2016 stated <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>all</b> <b>be</b> removed from Force inventory by 2016. In 1992, two CASA CN-235-100 {{transport aircraft}} were purchased from Spain and from at least 2013 both were not in service. The Defence White Paper 2013 stated an intention to return both into service by 2014, however, only one has returned to service in June 2015. In 1997, the PNGDF acquired a CASA C212-200 transport aircraft from the Sandline affair. The Defence White Paper 2013 stated an intention to have this in service by June 2015. In February 2016, a contract was signed with New Zealand company Pacific Aerospace for four PAC P-750 XSTOL aircraft for search and rescue and surveillance and two PAC CT/4 Airtrainer aircraft.|$|E

25|$|By 1 April, {{when the}} trap closed around the Germans in the Ruhr, their fate was sealed. In {{a matter of}} days <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>all</b> <b>be</b> killed or captured. On 4 April, the day it shifted to Bradley's control, the 9th Army began its attack south toward the Ruhr River. In the south, the 1st Army's III Corps {{launched}} its strike on the 5th, and the XVIII Airborne Corps joined in on the 6th, both pushing generally northward. German resistance, initially rather determined, dwindled rapidly. By 13 April, the 9th Army had cleared {{the northern part of the}} pocket, while elements of the XVIII Airborne Corps′ 8th Infantry Division reached the southern bank of the Ruhr, splitting the southern section of the pocket in two. Thousands of prisoners were being taken every day; from 16–18 April, when all opposition ended and the remnants of German Army Group B formally surrendered, German troops had been surrendering in droves throughout the region. Army Group B commander Walther Model committed suicide on 21 April.|$|E
500|$|By {{the time}} of the composer's death in 1912 his {{reputation}} had declined, especially outside his native country. In the second edition (1907) of Grove, J A Fuller Maitland accused the composer of pandering to the fashionable Parisian taste of the moment, and disguising a uniformly [...] "weak and sugary" [...] style with superficial effects. Fuller Maitland contended that to discerning music lovers such as himself the operas of Massenet were [...] "inexpressibly monotonous", and he predicted that <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>all</b> <b>be</b> forgotten after the composer's death.|$|E

The main reason to go into hiatus was that, in early 2003, lead singer Gwen Stefani started work on her 1980s-inspired new wave/dance-pop music side project, under which she released two solo albums: Love. Angel. Music. Baby. on November 22, 2004 and The Sweet Escape on December 4, 2006.|$|E

500|$|Commentators have {{generally}} accepted the trial jury's verdict that the Claimant was Arthur Orton. However, McWilliam cites the monumental study by Douglas Woodruff (1957), {{in which the}} author posits that the Claimant could just possibly have been Roger Tichborne. Woodruff's principal argument is the sheer improbability that anyone could conceive such an imposture from scratch, at such a distance, and then implement it: [...] "t was carrying effrontery {{beyond the bounds of}} sanity if Arthur Orton embarked with a wife and retinue and crossed the world, knowing that <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>all</b> <b>be</b> destitute if he did not succeed in convincing a woman he had never met and knew nothing about first-hand, that he was her son".|$|E
500|$|After the {{surrender}} {{of tens of thousands}} of American troops during the Battle of Bataan, many were sent to the Cabanatuan prison camp following the Bataan Death March. The Japanese transferred most of the prisoners to other areas, leaving just over 500American and other Allied POWs and civilians in the prison. Facing brutal conditions including disease, torture, and malnourishment, the prisoners feared <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>all</b> <b>be</b> executed by their captors before the arrival of General Douglas MacArthur and his American forces returning to Luzon. In late January 1945, a plan was developed by Sixth Army leaders and Filipino guerrillas to send a small force to rescue the prisoners. A group of over a hundred Rangers and Scouts and a couple of hundred guerrillas traveled [...] behind Japanese lines to reach the camp.|$|E
500|$|In April 1931, {{after the}} advent of the Second Spanish Republic, Alfonso XIII became part of the Spanish Republican Navy and was renamed España, the name {{previously}} held by her sister ship , which had been wrecked in 1923 while engaged in combat operations at Cape Tres Forcas. By 1934, the renamed España was laid up at Ferrol awaiting disposal. That year, the Spanish Navy considered rebuilding the ship and Jaime I into analogues to the German s, with new oil-fired boilers. The ships' hulls would have been lengthened, and the main battery turrets rearranged so <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>all</b> <b>be</b> on the centerline. The ships' secondary batteries would have been replaced with dual-purpose [...] guns. The plan was nevertheless abandoned. In 1936, the Navy again proposed a modernization for the two ships. It was a less radical plan, and called for additional anti-aircraft guns, modern fire control equipment, oil-fired boilers, and an increase to the elevation of the main guns.|$|E

5000|$|The {{film has}} {{garnered}} more praise in recent years, however. RedLetterMedia lauded Xtro for its screenwriting {{and use of}} practical effects in their Best of the Worst show after accidentally choosing it from a lineup of B movies <b>they</b> believed <b>would</b> <b>all</b> <b>be</b> of poor quality.

500|$|The {{operation}} had two aims: {{creating the}} appearance of army units where none existed and concealing the real armour, artillery and matériel at the front. Barkas observed that [...] "the concealment of the huge assembly of the Armoured Corps was essentially a piece of military planning by Army Headquarters, with Camouflage carrying out certain specific tasks". Since {{it would be impossible}} to hide the existence of such a large number of vehicles, especially of tanks in the Martello area, Barkas planned instead to make the vehicles there quite obvious, as trucks, well before battle. The tanks, too, would be openly displayed, far behind the battle front. When the enemy saw that nothing seemed to be happening, the trucks would be replaced by tanks, masquerading as trucks. That meant that the tanks, too, would have to be seen not to move.so <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>all</b> <b>be</b> replaced with dummies. An unprecedented and [...] "formidable" [...] number of dummies were required: more than 400 tanks, 100 guns, and nearly 2000 soft-skinned vehicles.|$|E
2500|$|The Yankees {{organization}} {{did work}} closely with the Creatures to ensure that they sat together again, and designated a total of 136 season-ticket packages for them in section 203. The move was monitored by long-time Creature Teena Lewis, known as the [...] "Queen of the Bleachers", and Marc Chalpin, who organized a list of about 50+ Creatures to ensure <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>all</b> <b>be</b> sitting together again in the new stadium. Despite the Creatures' concerns over how the Yankees management would handle the move, Lewis said that, [...] "The Yankees helped us because I calmed everybody down over the years. We behaved ourselves, took away some of the chants, and they pretty much paid us back." ...|$|E
2500|$|On October 4, 2007, The New York Times {{reported}} that, {{shortly after}} Alberto Gonzales became Attorney General in February 2005, the Justice Department issued a secret opinion {{which for the}} first time provided CIA explicit authorization to barrage terror suspects with a combination of painful physical and psychological tactics, including head-slapping, simulated drowning and frigid temperatures. This was in direct opposition to a public legal opinion issued in December 2004 that declared torture [...] "abhorrent". Gonzales reportedly approved the legal memorandum on [...] "combined effects" [...] over the objections of James B. Comey, the outgoing deputy attorney general, who told colleagues at the Justice Department that <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>all</b> <b>be</b> [...] "ashamed" [...] when the world eventually learned of it. According to the Times report, the 2005 Justice Department opinions remain in effect, and their legal conclusions have been confirmed by several more recent memorandums.|$|E

2500|$|After {{destroying}} Hill's Ironworks {{and putting}} the rebel garrison there to flight, Huck convened a compulsory meeting of the remaining male residents of the New Acquisition District (mostly men too old to fight), and proclaimed that [...] "God almighty had become a rebel, but if there were twenty gods on that side, <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>all</b> <b>be</b> conquered." [...] Huck then stated that [...] "even if the rebels were as thick as trees, and Jesus Christ would come down and lead them, he would still defeat them," [...] following which he and his troopers confiscated all the men's horses. Actions like these quickly earned Huck the nickname [...] "the swearing captain" [...] and further angered the Presbyterian inhabitants of the backcountry. After witnessing Huck's tirade, one resident, Daniel Collins, told his wife, [...] "I have come home determined to take my gun and when I lay it down, I lay down my life with it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Unknown to Timmermann, the Germans {{had about}} 300 {{soldiers}} and civilians within the 325 meter long railroad tunnel. [...] In addition, they had four freight train cars loaded with ammunition and aircraft fuel. After a few attempts to escape, the Germans {{realized they were}} trapped. The soldiers had been ordered to destroy the bridge, but they had failed. The civilians, {{along with many other}} soldiers, hid in the tunnel because of the American shelling and bombing. The remaining officers had orders to defend and resist to the last man. Women and children were crying and the soldiers became resigned to their fate. Any movement near the tunnel openings were met with enemy fire. Soon enemy tanks would come across the bridge and fire into the tunnel. [...] When that would happen <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>all</b> <b>be</b> incinerated. German leadership failed and two German youths, who had been enlisted as helpers for the anti-aircraft cannons, came forward.|$|E
2500|$|In {{an attempt}} to resolve the {{difficulties}} in governance, Tung reformed the structure of government substantially starting from his second term in 2002. In a system popularly called the Principal Officials Accountability system, all principal officials, including the Chief Secretary, Financial Secretary, Secretary for Justice and head of government bureaux {{would no longer be}} politically neutral career civil servants. Instead, <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>all</b> <b>be</b> political appointees chosen by the Chief Executive. The system was portrayed as the key to solve previous administrative problems, notably the cooperation of high-ranking civil servants with the Chief Executive. Under the new system, all heads of bureau became members of the Executive Council, and came directly under the Chief Executive instead of the Chief Secretary or the Financial Secretary. The heads of the Liberal Party and Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong, two pro-government parties in the Legislative Council, were also appointed into the Executive Council to form a [...] "ruling alliance," [...] a de facto coalition. This practically shut out the pro-democratic parties and individuals.|$|E
