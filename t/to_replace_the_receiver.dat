40|$|Abstract- Continuous phase {{modulation}} (CPM) schemes are generally used in peak-power limited transmission {{systems such as}} digital satellite communications. Their major drawback, however, is a prohibitively complex receiver structure, particularly in modulation schemes with high packing densities. In this paper we propose feed-forward neural nets (NN) as receivers for partial response CPM systems. Our approach is <b>to</b> <b>replace</b> <b>the</b> entire <b>receiver</b> structure, excluding timing recovery, with a neural net unit whose inputs are time samples of the incoming baseband signals, and whose outputs are the decoded symbols. We present simulation results for coherent and incoherent NN based receivers, and compare their performance with the optimum maximum-likelihood (ML) receiver. A performance analysis of NN-based receivers at large SNR is presented. I...|$|R

40|$|Optical free-space {{communication}} {{will be a}} key {{building block}} for future information systems. However, when the link includes part of the atmosphere, clear-air turbulence induces serious phase distortions and fading to the optical link. To mitigate this fading using spatial diversity techniques, it is necessary <b>to</b> <b>replace</b> <b>the</b> single <b>receiver</b> with a receiver array, where each individual detector observes a different section of the received optical beam. Caused by atmospheric turbulence, the individual detectors of the array will detect different amplitudes and phases, which shall be phase corrected and combined in the electrical domain. In this context, the feasibility to restore the modulation contents of an atmospherically distorted wave-front using complex vector modulators needs to be explored. If atmospheric fading information is known for each aperture, the corresponding output electric signals can be adaptively processed, co-phased, and scaled by electronic vector modulators before they are summed, mitigating signal fading caused by atmospheric turbulence. In this activity we plan to characterise electronic properties, such as communication bandwidths and control response time, of several commercially available vector modulators...|$|R
40|$|Iterative {{processing}} {{has been}} shown to be very effective in multiuser space-time block coding (STBC) systems. The complexity and efficiency of an iterative receiver depend heavily on how the log-likelihood ratios (LLRs) of the coded bits are computed and exchanged at <b>the</b> <b>receiver</b> among its three major components, namely the multiuser detector, the maximum a posterior probability (MAP) demodulators and the MAP channel decoders. This thesis first presents a method to quantitatively measure the system complexities with floating-point operations (FLOPS) and a technique to evaluate <b>the</b> iterative <b>receiver's</b> convergence property based on mutual information and extrinsic information transfer (EXIT) charts. Then, an integrated iterative receiver is developed by applying the sigma mappings for M-ary quadrature amplitude modulation (M-QAM) constellations. Due to the linear relationship between the coded bits and the transmitted channel symbol, the multiuser detector can work on the bit-level and hence improves the convergence property of <b>the</b> iterative <b>receiver.</b> It is shown that <b>the</b> integrated iterative <b>receiver</b> is an attractive candidate <b>to</b> <b>replace</b> <b>the</b> conventional <b>receiver</b> when a few receive antennas and a high-order M-QAM constellation are employed. Finally, a more general two-loop iterative receiver is proposed by introducing an inner iteration loop between the MAP demodulators and the MAP convolutional decoders besides the outer iteration loop that involves the multiuser detection (MUD) as in <b>the</b> conventional iterative <b>receiver.</b> <b>The</b> proposed two-loop iterative <b>receiver</b> greatly improves <b>the</b> iteration efficiency. It is demonstrated that the proposed two-loop iterative <b>receiver</b> can achieve <b>the</b> same asymptotic performance as that of <b>the</b> conventional iterative <b>receiver,</b> but with much less outer-loop iterations...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, two {{numerical}} {{models are}} presented to simulate an enhanced very early time electromagnetic (VETEM) prototype system, {{which is used}} for buried-object detection and environmental problems. Usually, the VETEM system contains a transmitting loop antenna and a receiving loop antenna, which run on a lossy ground to detect buried objects. In the first numerical model, the loop antennas are accurately analyzed using the Method of Moments (MoM) for wire antennas above or buried in lossy ground. Then, Conjugate Gradient (CG) methods, {{with the use of}} the fast Fourier transform (FFT) or MoM, are applied to investigate the scattering from buried objects. Reflected and scattered magnetic fields are evaluated at the receiving loop to calculate the output electric current. However, the working frequency for the VETEM system is usually low and, hence, two magnetic dipoles are used <b>to</b> <b>replace</b> <b>the</b> transmitter and <b>receiver</b> in <b>the</b> second numerical model. Comparing these two models, the second one is simple, but only valid for low frequency or small loops, while the first modeling is more general. In this paper, all computations are performed in the frequency domain, and the FFT is used to obtain the time-domain responses. Numerical examples show that simulation results from these two models fit very well when the frequency ranges from 10 kHz to 10 MHz, and both results are close to the measured data. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Prather, DennisSchuetz, ChristopherThe modern {{communications}} {{environment is}} becoming an increasingly crowded place, resulting in rapidly increasing demands on current technology. Military and civilian operations require the ability to locate and decode all communication signals in the environment. However, developments in RADAR (RAdio Detection And Ranging) and communications technology are making it harder to effectively identify and maintain bandwidth usage for everyone. Millimeter waves—waves measured between one millimeter to one centimeter in wavelength—have only recently been explored as a new technology <b>to</b> <b>replace</b> <b>the</b> augment <b>receiver</b> architectures. These small wavelengths introduce many engineering challenges, such as: large atmospheric losses, poor sensitivity, and expensive electronic equipment. With growing developments in Microwave Photonics, low-noise RF amplifiers and high-speed modulators have demonstrated the ability to design RF communication links in the millimeter wave regime to counter such problems. However, despite these developments, toward a cost-effective, spatial division multiplexing (SDM) receiver concept has not proved capable of being implemented {{as part of the}} next generation 5 G wireless network infrastructure. To this end, we present a novel receiver architecture utilizing an optically addressed phased-array millimeter wave receiver based on optical-upconversion and signal recovery. This receiver is capable of geolocation and spatial multiplexing of multiple Tunable Optically Paired Source (TOPS) communication signals in its scene. Operating at 35 GHz, <b>the</b> <b>receiver</b> up-converts <b>the</b> received RF onto an optical sideband, which, to our advantage, contains all of the frequency, amplitude, and phase information of the received signals. Subsequent optical processing allows routing of the sideband to a free space detector port. Photomixing a coherent optical local oscillator (LO) with the optical sideband performs heterodyne down-conversion to an Intermediate Frequency (IF) where we are able to spatially resolve each signal individually to recover complex modulated formats transmitted by our TOPS generators. In this thesis, we describe the unique advantages of our receiver concept to allow for frequency re-use as well as cell sectoring methods to increase the overall data capacity bandwidth. Primarily, the use of a distrusted aperture array enables high resolution imaging, limited only by the diffraction efficiency set at the antenna array. Thus, angle-of-arrival (AoA) capabilities help deduce the position of each signal and the data it contains. Unlike IR or visible wavelengths, millimeter waves have the unique ability to penetrate dust, smoke, cloud coverage, and thin fabrics such as clothing. As such, millimeter wave <b>receivers</b> have <b>the</b> capability of achieving high signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) in obscured environments compared to their counterparts. This optically addressed communication receiver offers vast advantages over current communication receiver architectures in place today. This approach has the potential to operate as the next generation communication receiver for 5 G wireless. In addition, this receiver concept appeals to many security and defense applications requiring secure communications and unwanted signal avoidance.
