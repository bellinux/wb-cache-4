In August 2007, the top rate of tax on the most profitable fields was increased to 40%.The new licensing terms called for changes to the tax imposed based upon fields ' profit ratios (equal to the rate of profit less 25% divided by the accumulated level of capital investment). Where this ratio is greater than 4.5, an additional 15% tax was imposed, where it is between 3.0 and 4.5 an additional 10% was imposed and where the profit ratio is between 1.5 and 3.0, and additional 5% tax was added.

50|$|The Waterfront, {{unlike the}} SouthSide Works located {{a few miles}} up the river, was {{developed}} in a more suburban fashion, with retail, residential, and office spaces all being separated from each other by vast parking lots. However, unlike the Southside Works, the Waterfront did not benefit from proximity to, and unrestricted access to, a thriving urban commercial area. Also of note; while comparisons of relative <b>tax</b> <b>yield</b> are often made, these comparisons do {{not take into account}} the sizeable public investment required to facilitate the Southside Works. The Waterfront was predominantly a private investment, although there was a tax increment financing of approximately $ 25 million approved by three separate municipalities, one county, and one school district, a notable accomplishment. Traffic congestion within the development is common due to the large distances between outlets and the lack of sidewalks and pathways; the limited entrances into and out of The Waterfront also add to the congestion. The complex is separated from the original sections of Homestead, West Homestead, and Munhall, via railroad tracks and does not physically or visually connect with the older sections of the municipalities, which was impossible due to the active rail lines. To facilitate access, Allegheny County constructed a new access ramp to the site from the Homestead High Level (Grays) Bridge, and also partnered with the Commonwealth of PA in 1993 on the construction of the East Flyover Ramp in Munhall Borough. The construction of this ramp was well in advance of development plans which were announced in 1997. This resulted in a ramp which ultimately proved to be less than optimal. The Town Center area of the development is home to stores one would find in most malls, including Charming Charlie, Gap, and Victoria's Secret. Macy's (formerly Kaufmann's), Barnes & Noble, and a Loews Cineplex are located in this area as well. The eastern end of the development resembles more of a traditional suburban strip mall, with many big-box retail stores fronting a large parking lot. Stores here include Bed, Bath, & Beyond, Dick's Sporting Goods, Giant Eagle grocery, Lowe's, and Target. Around the perimeter of the complex, particularly along the Monongahela River, are most of the development's restaurants, almost all of which are typical chain restaurants like Uno Chicago Grill, LongHorn Steakhouse, Panera Bread, Red Robin, T.G.I. Friday's, Eat'n Park, and P. F. Chang's China Bistro, as well as several fast food locations. An apartment complex, a few office buildings (such as GAI Consultants, Inc.), fueling station, and multiple hotels are also located along the river perimeter.|$|E

40|$|The paper studies optimal forest {{taxation}} under {{uncertainty about}} future timber price when private forest owners value amenity services of forest stands and forest stands have public goods characteristics. It {{is assumed that}} preferences of forest owners can be described by a quasi-linear, intertemporal utility function which reflects risk aversion in terms of consumption and constant marginal utility in terms of amenity services. The comparative statics of current and future harvesting in terms of timber price risk, site productivity <b>tax</b> and <b>yield</b> <b>tax</b> are first developed. It is shown that, given the optimal site productivity tax, which is independent of the timber harvested and thus non-distortionary, it is desirable to introduce the <b>yield</b> <b>tax</b> at the margin; it both corrects externality due to the public goods characteristic of forest stands {{and serves as a}} social insurance device. The optimal <b>yield</b> <b>tax</b> is less than 100 % and depends on the social value of forest stands, timber price risk and properties of compensated timber supply.

40|$|Despite the {{extensive}} {{literature on the}} relation between crime and migration, not much is known about how crime affects the tax capacity of local communities. This paper empirically investigates whether the Flemish local income <b>tax</b> base <b>yield</b> is sensitive {{to changes in the}} local crime level. The underlying assumptions are twofold. In a Tiebout world rational voters holding the local government accountable for the safety of its citizens move out when the local level of security gets too much alienated from what they want it to be (first assumption). If migration is due to crime, the more wealthy citizens are expected to move first. Looking for a place elsewhere implies transaction costs, which the more wealthy citizens {{are more likely to be}} able to afford. As a consequence, the average income per capita and so the income distribution will be affected, which in turn, will influence the local income <b>tax</b> base <b>yield</b> (second assumption). Ceteris paribus, the decreasing average income per capita, results in a lower local income <b>tax</b> base <b>yield.</b> In absence of a higher level governments’ compensation, decreasing local tax revenues could prove to be disastrous for a crime-ridden municipality. When communities do not succeed in forcing back the number of offences, this can be the onset of a cumulative process of urban deterioration. A spatial panel data model containing several proxies for the local level of crime in 306 Flemish municipalities covering the period 2000 - 2014 is used to test the relation between crime and the local income <b>tax</b> base <b>yield.</b> When using aggregate crime rate statistics, the total number of offenses per capita, no significant results were found. Yet when using the type specific crime statistics, significant results do were found. By regressing the specific types of crime and the control variable onto household mobility (per capita efflux- en influx of citizens) the first assumption was confirmed. Respectively, a negative and a positive link was found between the per capita efflux- and influx of citizens, and the change in the relative number of violent crime per capita. Results regarding the efflux of citizens were persistent up until a 1 year lag. To investigate the second assumption, a 2 SLS panel data analysis was used. These results show that crime induced household mobility does indeed lower the income <b>tax</b> base <b>yield</b> and therefore confirms the second assumption. An increase in per capita violent crimes, will stimulate the per capita efflux of people, in turn lowering the local income <b>tax</b> base <b>yield.</b> A negative result was also found for the crime induced per capita efflux of citizens, although it was barely insignificant. By confirming both assumptions we present evidence for a relation between changes in local crime rates and the income <b>tax</b> base <b>yield</b> of a municipality, coming about thru household mobilit...|$|R
