25|$|High-energy {{radio waves}} {{are known as}} {{microwaves}} and <b>this</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>an</b> important area of astronomy ever since {{the discovery of the}} cosmic microwave background radiation in 1964. Many ground-based radio telescopes can study microwaves. Short wavelength microwaves are best studied from space because water vapor (even at high altitudes) strongly weakens the signal. The Cosmic Background Explorer (1989) revolutionized the study of the microwave background radiation.|$|E
25|$|They {{reached the}} plate final of the 1994 ICC Trophy, {{but did not}} play the match as they had already booked a flight home, not expecting to qualify. <b>This</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>an</b> {{occasional}} problem for Papua New Guinea, as flights {{to and from the}} country are infrequent. They also left the 1998 ACC Trophy in Nepal early after losing their first two games, forfeiting their match against the Maldives as otherwise {{they would have had to}} have waited more than a week for the next flight. This has also meant they have rarely played overseas outside of official tournaments, the only exceptions being a visit to Fiji in 1977, a tour of Hong Kong in the early 1980s and the aforementioned tour of Australia.|$|E

25|$|By {{the first}} {{millennium}} BC, bronze-working peoples lived in Mongolia. With the appearance of iron weapons by the 3rd century BC, the inhabitants of Mongolia had begun to form Clan alliances and lived a hunter and herder lifestyle. The origins of more modern inhabitants are found among the forest hunters and nomadic tribes of Inner Asia. They inhabited a great arc of land extending generally from the Korean Peninsula in the east, across the northern tier of China to present-day Kazakhstan and to the Pamir Mountains and Lake Balkash in the west. During most of recorded history, <b>this</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>an</b> area of constant ferment from which emerged numerous migrations and invasions to the southeast (into China), to the southwest (into Transoxiana—modern Uzbekistan, Iran, and India), and to the west (across Scythia toward Europe).|$|E
500|$|By 14 March, the {{expedition}} crews {{had completed the}} change over, but until the shuttle undocked, Shepherd officially remained commander of the station. The morning of the 14th the astronauts' wake-up call was the song [...] "Should I Stay or Should I Go" [...] by The Clash, {{at the request of}} Shepherd's wife. Shepherd, a former Navy SEAL, said during the change over ceremony: [...] "May the good will, spirit and sense of mission we had enjoyed on board endure. Sail her well." [...] The commander of Discovery, Jim Wetherbee, said [...] ""For Captain Shepherd and his crew, we hold you in admiration as we prepare to bring you home. <b>This</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>an</b> arduous duty for you.

Leto told MTV News, [...] "It's been an incredible adventure, but it's also been really difficult, {{because there are so}} many people, and we're shutting down streets of Los Angeles." [...] He further said that they were really worried about a scene regarding a lone horse running down a Los Angeles street: [...] "We only had three takes that we had time to do. The first take it went sideways, second take it went the other way. Third take? Perfect." [...] Leto described the experience of filming the music video saying, [...] "It's a lyrical and slightly metaphorical surreal journey through the city of Angels, from downtown Los Angeles to Santa Monica Pier. We like to create an adventure and <b>this</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>an</b> adventure. [...] This is what we were supposed to do. And I doubted the idea up until the very last minute, but the process has been phenomenal." [...] The music video premiered on November 9, 2009 at the Montalban Theater in Los Angeles.|$|E

More recently, supercritical fluids have started to be deployed in several important applications, ranging from the extraction of floral fragrance from flowers to applications in food science such as creating decaffeinated coffee, functional food ingredients, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, polymers, powders, bio- and functional materials, nano-systems, natural products, biotechnology, fossil and bio-fuels, microelectronics, energy and environment.

2500|$|The {{trial began}} on 14 April 2008 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, with Rowling testifying {{on day one}} and Vander Ark testifying on day two. During her testimony, Rowling reiterated her claim that the Lexicon {{contained}} minimal commentary and merely recycled her writing, adding nothing other than [...] "facetious asides and etymologies of the easiest kind." [...] Rowling referred to the Lexicon as [...] "wholesale theft of 17 years of my hard work", and criticized it as [...] "sloppy" [...] and characterized by [...] "very little research". In sometimes emotional testimony, Rowling recalled beginning the Potter books when she was an impoverished 25-year-old single mother, nearly coming to tears when saying, [...] "These characters continue to mean {{so much to me}} {{over a long period of}} time. The closest you could come is to say, 'How do you feel about your children?'" [...] Rowling also revealed that the lawsuit has [...] "decimated her creative work" [...] over the prior month, causing her to cease work on a new novel. In his testimony, Vander Ark said that he too had had reserves about publishing the encyclopedia and that the publishing company had talked him into it. [...] "It's been difficult because there has been a lot of criticism, obviously, and that was never the intention. ... <b>This</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>an</b> important part of my life for the last nine years or so," [...] he said.|$|E
