In addition, the number of mother and baby homes had declined by nearly 72% since 1966.

500|$|With {{the rise}} of feminist {{literary}} criticism in the 1970s, Mary Shelley's works, particularly Frankenstein, began to attract much more attention from scholars.

Ellen Moers {{was one of the first}} to claim that Shelley's loss of a baby was a crucial influence on the writing of Frankenstein. She argues that the novel is a [...] "birth myth" [...] in which Shelley comes to terms with her guilt for causing her mother's death as well as for failing as a parent. Shelley scholar Anne K. Mellor suggests that, from a feminist viewpoint, it is a story [...] "about what happens when a man tries <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>baby</b> without a woman... is profoundly concerned with natural as opposed to unnatural modes of production and reproduction". Victor Frankenstein's failure as a [...] "parent" [...] in the novel has been read as an expression of the anxieties which accompany pregnancy, giving birth, and particularly maternity.|$|E

[...] Nicole later told Marilyn Chambers (Emily Symons) about the baby and she offered to adopt it. James later revealed that when she joined Home and Away she told the writers that they can do anything with her character, except make her pregnant.

500|$|Originally {{credited}} as Phylicia Ayers-Allen, Rashad eventually {{adopted the}} surname of her third husband, sportscaster Ahmad Rashad, who she married during the show's third season. During the wedding ceremony, Rashad was [...] "given away" [...] to Ahmad by television husband Cosby, by whom {{the couple had}} first been introduced. Cosby assured Rashad {{that she would be}} allowed to remain on the show should she and Ahmad decide <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>baby,</b> joking, [...] "We'll just add another Huxtable". Rashad became pregnant with their child during season three. To avoid having to add an infant to the main cast, extreme tactics were used to conceal the actress' pregnancy onscreen, such as confining Clair to bed or having her be out of town for several episodes at a time. Scooped out, the bed's mattress was specially constructed to prevent Rashad's growing stomach from being visible underneath the covers but ultimately resulted in the actress suffering a pinched nerve in her back. Rashad would also hide behind props such as kitchen tables, counters and jackets. In the episode [...] "Vanessa's Rich", Rashad uses a large teddy bear to hide her pregnancy while seated on the living room sofa, but the toy's origin and purpose within the episode remains unexplained. After giving birth to daughter Condola Rashad in 1986, Rashad managed to lose the weight she had gained while pregnant by the time season four premiered. Rashad's sister, actress Debbie Allen, appeared in an episode of The Cosby Show as Clair's personal trainer.|$|E
