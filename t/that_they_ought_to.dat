5|$|A {{public enquiry}} {{was held in}} 1873, to {{determine}} whether it would be advantageous for the city to be administered by a municipal corporation. The result being in the affirmative, the city council, sometimes archaically called the corporation, was founded by a Charter of Incorporation dated 17 March 1874, under the government of a mayor, six aldermen and 18 councillors. Something of an anomaly, the Parliamentary Boundary Commission of 1868 had decided that the urban parts of Fletton and Woodston were so involved in Peterborough <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> be in the borough and added the newly built-up portions of these parishes to the parliamentary constituency. In local matters they were still in Huntingdonshire and, as the City of Peterborough did not extend south of the River Nene, the full title of the new municipality was the City and Borough of Peterborough and its inhabitants, citizens and burgesses.|$|E
25|$|During the retreat, Haussegger was {{captured}} {{along with a}} number of his soldiers near the lower fords. According to a second account, on 1 January he insisted on marching his battalion into Princeton. Major Weltner argued strongly against this, and when the colonel and 10 men continued into the town, they were made prisoners. While he was in New York City, other prisoners including Ethan Allen and Alexander Graydon reported that Haussegger told them that the American cause was finished. He suggested to the others <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> ask forgiveness and make peace with the British. Haussegger bragged that he dined with Hessian General Leopold Philip von Heister.|$|E
25|$|Simmias confesses that he {{does not}} wish to disturb Socrates during his final hours by unsettling his belief in the {{immortality}} of the soul, and those present are reluctant to voice their skepticism. Socrates grows aware of their doubt and assures his interlocutors {{that he does}} indeed believe in the soul's immortality, {{regardless of whether or not}} he has succeeded in showing it as yet. For this reason, he is not upset facing death and assures them <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> express their concerns regarding the arguments. Simmias then presents his case that the soul resembles the harmony of the lyre. It may be, then, that as the soul resembles the harmony in its being invisible and divine, once the lyre has been destroyed, the harmony too vanishes, therefore when the body dies, the soul too vanishes. Once the harmony is dissipated, we may infer that so too will the soul dissipate once the body has been broken, through death.|$|E

500|$|A socialist {{from his}} {{undergraduate}} days, Childe was an atheist and critic of religion, viewing it as a false consciousness based in superstition. In History (1947) he commented that [...] "Magic {{is a way}} of making people believe {{they are going to get}} what they want, whereas religion is a system for persuading them <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> want what they get." [...] Archaeologist Colin Renfrew noted that Childe was liberal minded on social issues, but thought that although Childe deplored racism, he did not entirely escape the pervasive 19th century view on distinct differences between different races.|$|E

2500|$|In November 1985, Spacemen 3 {{played a}} gig at a leisure centre in Coventry to an {{audience}} of fewer than ten people. Nevertheless, encouraged by the support of Pat Fish, they determined <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> record a new demo tape. By this time they had reconfigured and honed their musical style, and their repertoire consisted of newer songs and re-worked older ones.

2500|$|In 1998, the Union for Socialist Ideas and Action told {{a left-wing}} Australian {{organization}} that Ramos hesitantly admitted that contrary to his government's earlier claim, the economic fundamentals {{of the country}} may actually be unsound.

2500|$|Most of Amulo's works also {{directly}} {{refer to}} the Church Fathers, including Saint Augustine, Jerome, and Gregory the Great. He mostly wrote on issues concerning Jewish mysticism, predestination, and Halakha which was not known to the patristic authors. [...] These works were often quoted to support polemical arguments. [...] Similarly, Amulo demonstrates his knowledge of Jewish texts to strengthen his position. [...] It is clear from his writings that Scripture was insufficient; a wide base of Church scholarship fueled debates between dioceses over Christ's nature, Jewish tradition, and superstition. [...] Both Amulo and Agobard strove to counter Jewish influence in Francia, and worked to convince Christians <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> limit their interaction with the Jewish population of Lyons.|$|E
2500|$|The {{debate is}} rooted in a {{literary}} question about whom Homer intended to portray as the better man, Achilles or Odysseus. [...] Socrates says he has heard Eudicus' father, Apemantus, declare {{that there is a}} parallel analogy between the artistic quality of the Iliad and the moral quality of its main character, Achilles, {{and the quality of the}} Odyssey and the quality of its main character, Odysseus. The men do not pursue this thesis, that the moral status of the characters in a work of literature has some bearing on its artistry. Socrates does resurrect the idea in the Republic, however, when he argues that Homer's classics would be better books if Achilles and the other warriors were presented as always righteous. Socrates says <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> be rewritten to this effect.|$|E
2500|$|As I've been a {{governor}} {{and seen the}} impact {{that the federal government}} can have holding down the interest of the teachers' unions and instead putting the interests of the kids and the parents and the teachers first, I see that the Department of Education can actually make a difference. So I supported No Child Left Behind. I still do. I know there are a lot in my party that don't like it, but I like testing in our schools.

60|$|That {{is exactly}} what the Professor does not find in any University in the three Kingdoms that I can hear of--the reason of which state of things lies in the {{extremely}} faulty organisation of the majority of secondary schools.

2500|$|Johann Wolfgang von Goethe says, [...] "Treat {{people as}} they were <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> be and you may help them to become what {{they are capable of}} being". As a leader, there are two qualities that you need to focus on in an organization: the {{structure}} of the organization and how followers are involved. The type of leadership you want in an organization would be a democratic approach. A democratic leader does not feel threatened when followers make suggestions, but instead accepts the contributions to help improve the overall quality of decision-making. Having a democratic system allows for the followers to set goals for the organization, and this creates two-way communication that openly flows between the leader and followers. The leader wants to have more interaction with the followers. Through interaction it allows followers to be engaged in the organization, but they also have a higher participation rate. The democratic style of leadership communication is often most effective. Generally, the benefits derived from democratic communication far outweigh any potential cost.|$|E

And I think in any case where you feel that someone's making an argument that you are inventing something or improperly casting a cloud on someone, you respond. And we responded fairly and honestly by saying there was a cloud there caused by – not caused by us. And by Mr. Libby obstructing justice and lying about what happened, {{he had failed to}} remove the cloud. And sometimes when people tell the truth, clouds disappear. And sometimes they don't. But when you don't know what's happening, that's a problem. And so {{the fact that there was}} a cloud over anyone was not our doing. It was the facts of the case. It was the facts of the case. It was aggravated by Mr. Libby telling falsehoods. And that's what we said. We're not going to add to that or subtract to that.

25|$|Whereas Singer is {{primarily}} concerned with improving the treatment of animals and accepts that, in some hypothetical scenarios, individual animals might be used legitimately to further human or nonhuman ends, Regan believes we <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> treat nonhuman animals as we would humans.
