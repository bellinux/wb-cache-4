40|$|The {{etiological}} agent {{most commonly}} associated with bacillary dysentery is Shigella. As part of its mandate, the Bacteriology and Enteric Disease Program of Health Canada identifies and serotypes unusual isolates of Shigella received from provincial laboratories of public health. In this report, six unusual isolates from three provinces were analyzed biochemically and serologically using slide and <b>tube</b> <b>agglutinations</b> and molecularly using standard pulsed-filed gel electrophoresis (PFGE), PCR, and PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) techniques. All six isolates were identical. PFGE analysis grouped these strains; biochemically, they were mannitol negative and consistent with the profile of Shigella. Serologically, these strains produced weak reactions in Shigella dysenteriae serovars 4 and 16 and Escherichia coli O 159 and O 173 antisera. Molecular serotyping by PCR-RFLP of the rfb gene produced an S. dysenteriae serovar 2 /E. coli O 112 ac pattern. They were positive by PCR for ipaH and ial enteroinvasive genes but negative for all other genes tested. Antiserum was prepared {{from one of the}} isolates and tested against Shigella and E. coli reference strains {{as well as the other}} isolates. The antiserum reacted with the five remaining isolates and showed cross-reactivity with S. dysenteriae serovars 1, 4, and 16; Shigella flexneri type 3; and E. coli O 118, O 159, O 168, O 172, and O 173 antigens. Absorbing the sera with E. coli O 159 and S. dysenteriae serovar 4 antigen removed all cross-reactions and only slightly reduced the homologous titer.

Detection thresholds for purified capsular polysaccharide in normal urine ranged from 0. 33 to 10 ng/mL. The sensitivity of the assay for the 10 pneumococcal serotypes was 0. 57 (95 % confidence interval, 0. 44 – 0. 70) and was unaffected by human immunodeficiency virus seropositivity, prior antibiotic use, and bacteremic or nonbacteremic status but varied significantly by serotype.

On a sample of 167 culture positive cattle, the sensitivities of the tests were CFT: 79. 0 %, BPAT: 75. 4, RBPT: 74. 9 %, CARD: 74. 3 %, SPAT: 73. 1 %, STAT: 68. 9 %, and 2 MET: 59. 9 %. All tests combined detected only 82 % of these infected cattle. Analysis of the relative sensitivity of the six agglutination tests gave the following ranking: BPAT greater than RBPT greater than CARD greater than SPAT greater than STAT. The 2 MET ranked between the BPAT and RBPT or between the RBPT and CARD depending on the analysis used. The use of the BPAT as a screening test is recommended provided that a test of high specificity and sensitivity such as the CFT is used to confirm screening test reactions...|$|R
40|$|Sera from 2 000 dogs from southwestern Ontario {{were tested}} for {{antibodies}} to Brucella canis by a rapid slide agglutination test. The 100 positively reacting sera were tested by <b>tube</b> <b>agglutination</b> and immunoprecipitation (gel diffusion) tests. Thirty-one of these sera gave suspicious titres and one a positive titre in the <b>tube</b> <b>agglutination</b> test. Six {{of the rapid}} slide test positive sera gave positive reactions in immunoprecipitation tests. One dog was identified which {{was found to have}} a history very suggestive of B. canis infection. It was judged that 0. 3 % of sera tested showed serological evidence of B. canis infection. The complexities of the serological diagnosis of B. canis infection was apparent, in particular the tendency to false-positive results in the rapid slide agglutination test...|$|E

Method: Randomly selected 123 regular blood donors of O group were phenotyped for seven blood group systems by direct <b>tube</b> <b>agglutination</b> and or indirect antiglobulin tests...|$|E
40|$|Antibodies against Yersinia enterocolitica {{serotype}} O: 3 {{were measured}} by crossed immunoelectrophoresis (XIE) using whole-cell sonic extract as antigen and by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) using either purified lipopolysaccharide or whole formalinized cells expressing virulence plasmid-encoded surface antigens (pYV+ cells). The results {{were compared with}} those obtained with the standard <b>tube</b> <b>agglutination</b> method. Sera from three groups of people were examined by using these assays. The first group consisted of healthy blood donors, the second consisted of patients with recent infection due to microorganisms other than Y. enterocolitica O: 3, and the third consisted of patients with recent Y. enterocolitica O: 3 infection. Sera from the last group were also obtained at regular intervals for 12 months postinfection. Results obtained with XIE and the ELISAs were in good agreement with those obtained with <b>tube</b> <b>agglutination.</b> Variation, diagnostic sensitivity, and diagnostic specificity were satisfactory for all the assays studied. However, the lipopolysaccharide ELISA was less laborious than <b>tube</b> <b>agglutination</b> and XIE and carried a somewhat greater diagnostic specificity than the pYV+ ELISA. XIE and the pYV+ ELISA, on the other hand, also had advantages. XIE enabled simultaneous examination of the individual antibody response against {{a wide range of}} chromosome-encoded antigens, and the pYV+ ELISA enabled detection of specific pYV antibodies when sera were adsorbed with formalinized pYV-cured Y. enterocolitica O: 3 cells prior to the assay...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to compare the {{incidence}} of brucellosis in groups of Kangal Akkaraman sheep flocks raised in farm conditions in Sivas province. The first and second groups of the sheep flocks were part of the 8 sub-projects which belong to The Project entitled “Nationwide Genetic Improvement of Small Ruminants in Farm Condition” continued for 7 and 1 - 3 years, respectively. The third group of the sheep flocks was not part of this nationwide project. The study material consisted of 1491 units of blood serum (n= 278, 1166 and 47 for the first, second and third groups, respectively). Brucella antibodies were looked for in blood serum using <b>tube</b> and slide <b>agglutination</b> tests. The incidences of brucellosis were 4 % and 7. 5 % in flocks which were part of the nationwide project continued for 7 and 3 years, respectively and 25. 5 % for the flocks not part of the nationwide project. The differences between groups were found statistically significant. Even though there was no brucella vaccination programs in the flocks of the nationwide project, practices such as regular controls of the flocks by veterinary technicians, drug/vaccination applications for parasites and some other diseases, removal of rams positive for brucella before breeding season significantly reduced the incidence of brucella. As a result, promoting good breeding practices along with the brucella vaccination program applied by the related Ministry can be very beneficial for the eradication of brucella disease that is a big problem for the country...|$|R
40|$|The first Canadian case of Legionella pneumophila {{serogroup}} 12 {{infection is}} reported. The initial diagnosis {{was made with}} a urine specimen by a broad-spectrum enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; further serogrouping was done by indirect fluorescent-antibody and <b>tube</b> <b>agglutination</b> tests.

40|$|Chickens were {{experimentally}} {{infected with}} Salmonella thompson (serogroup C, paratyphoid) and Salmonella pullorum (serogroup D). Five serological methods and one cultural method {{were used in}} detecting the infections. The microantiglobulin test was superior to all other methods for detection of paratyphoid (S. THOMPSON) infection and was followed in efficacy by the microagglutination test, rapid serum plate test, cloacal swab culture, macroscopic <b>tube</b> <b>agglutination</b> test, and rapid whole-blood test, in that order. Birds infected with S. pullorum showed much higher agglutinin titers than the birds infected with paratyphoid. The microagglutination and microantiglobulin tests {{were not significantly different}} for detection of pullorum infection and were followed in efficacy by the rapid serum plate, macroscopic <b>tube</b> <b>agglutination,</b> rapid whole-blood, and cloacal swab culture tests, in that order. The cloacal swab culture test was totally inadequate for the detection of pullorum infection...|$|E
