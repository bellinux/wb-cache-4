5|$|As I {{was reading}} about Cope and Marsh, I ran across Knight as {{something}} of a bit player in their lives.

A reaction to Holmboe's books and method of teaching, it was more practically oriented. Holmboe wrote a review of <b>the</b> <b>book</b> <b>for</b> the newspaper Morgenbladet, in which he advised schools not to use it.

He considers A Second Chance at Sarah to be a personal story, focusing on the characters instead of the supernatural elements. Druckmann worked on several unsuccessful comic book ideas and pitches, before collaborating with Wong on A Second Chance at Sarah. Wong's work on the book was extensive, as she refined and extended Druckmann's initial concepts and ideas. The two worked on <b>the</b> <b>book</b> <b>for</b> over a year.

5|$|In {{a review}} of <b>the</b> <b>book</b> <b>for</b> the journal International Criminal Justice Review, Robert M.

Worley comments on the relevance of the book to scholars in various fields, including history, law, law enforcement, and terrorism analysis. Worley concludes his review by recommending <b>the</b> <b>book</b> <b>for</b> those with a fascination in researching criminal justice or the law. William Abresch comments favorably on Targeted Killing in International Law, in a review for the European Journal of International Law. He writes that the book is an important addition to the field of scholarship regarding how international law governs the practice of targeted killing. Abresch calls the author's writing style logical, and praises the book's organizational structure including its separate sections on use of targeted in war contrasted with use by police.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{scholars}} and readers have criticized <b>the</b> <b>book</b> <b>for</b> what {{are seen as}} condescending racist descriptions of the book's black characters, {{especially with regard to}} the characters' appearances, speech, and behavior, as well as the passive nature of Uncle Tom in accepting his fate. The novel's creation and use of common stereotypes about African Americans is significant because Uncle Tom's Cabin was the best-selling novel in the world during the 19th century. As a result, the book (along with illustrations from the book and associated stage productions) {{played a major role in}} permanently ingraining these stereotypes into the American psyche.|$|E

5|$|Reviewers {{recommended}} <b>the</b> <b>book</b> <b>for</b> public educators as {{an important}} contribution to liberal theory. Their common criticism was based around practical applications and the imposition of autonomy as a value, e.g., her contemporary examples of national civics education, how citizens who disagreed with the focus on autonomy could be accommodated, and how a weak perfectionist state could defend marginalized group interests in a public school setting.|$|E
5|$|Richard H.

Robyn Blumner of the St. Petersburg Times wrote that Lewis aptly summarized {{the development of the}} U.S. Constitution's protections of freedom of speech and of the press. She observed that the book forcefully presented the author's admiration of brave judges who had helped to develop interpretation of the U.S. Constitution's protections of the rights of freedom of expression as a defense against censorship.|$|E
5|$|Rowlands {{argues that}} {{the problem with the}} book's central {{approach}} is that it assumes that all interests have a clear relation to welfare and thus moral considerability; an assumption which, he argues, is partially undermined by the introduction of biological interests.
