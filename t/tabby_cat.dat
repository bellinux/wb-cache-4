She was reportedly last seen {{on the roof of the}} shed at Pier 27, watching her ship sail out of Quebec City. [...] Early the next morning Empress of Ireland collided with [...] while steaming through fog at the mouth of the St. Lawrence River and rapidly sank, killing over 1,000 people.

2500|$|An {{additional}} genetic condition {{can remove}} {{most of the}} striping of a white tiger, making the animal almost pure white. One such specimen was exhibited at Exeter Change in England in 1820, and described by Georges Cuvier as [...] "A white variety of Tiger is sometimes seen, with the stripes very opaque, {{and not to be}} observed except in certain angles of light." [...] Naturalist Richard Lydekker said that, [...] "a white tiger, in which the fur was of a creamy tint, with the usual stripes faintly visible in certain parts, was exhibited at the old menagerie at Exeter Change about the year 1820." [...] Hamilton Smith said, [...] "A wholly white tiger, with the stripe-pattern visible only under reflected light, like the pattern of a white <b>tabby</b> <b>cat,</b> was exhibited in the Exeter Change Menagerie in 1820.", and John George Wood stated that, [...] "a creamy white, with the ordinary tigerine stripes so faintly marked that they were only visible in certain lights." [...] Edwin Henry Landseer also drew this tigress in 1824.|$|E
2500|$|Compared {{to other}} members of the Felinae, the wildcat is a small species, but is {{nonetheless}} larger than the housecat. The wildcat is similar in appearance to a striped <b>tabby</b> <b>cat,</b> but has relatively longer legs, a more robust build, and a greater cranial volume. The tail is long, and usually slightly exceeds one-half of the animal's body length. Its skull is more spherical in shape than that of the jungle and leopard cat. The ears are moderate in length, and broad at the base. The eyes are large, with vertical pupils, and yellowish-green irises. Its dentition is relatively smaller and weaker than the jungle cat's. The species size varies according to Bergmann's rule, with the largest specimens occurring in cool, northern areas of Europe (such as Scotland and Scandinavia) and of Middle Asia (such as Mongolia, Manchuria and Siberia). Males measure [...] in body length, [...] in tail length, and normally weigh [...] Females are slightly smaller, measuring [...] in body length and [...] in tail length, and weighing [...]|$|E

50|$|Solid color bicolor cats {{occur because}} there is a white {{spotting}} gene present along with a recessive allele of the agouti gene, which evens out the usual striped pattern of the colors of the coat. In contrast, <b>tabby</b> <b>cats</b> have an agouti gene that produces striping of the coat. The Abyssinian has agouti (ticked tabby) fur, giving the appearance of even color with color-banded hairs.|$|R

60|$|Octavian Ruttle was one {{of those}} lively cheerful {{individuals}} on whom amiability had set its unmistakable stamp, and, like most of his kind, his soul’s peace depended in large measure on the unstinted approval of his fellows. In hunting to death a small <b>tabby</b> <b>cat</b> he had done a thing of which he scarcely approved himself, and he was glad when the gardener had hidden the body in its hastily dug grave under a lone oak-tree in the meadow, the same tree that the hunted quarry had climbed as a last effort towards safety. It had been a distasteful and seemingly ruthless deed, but circumstances had demanded the doing of it. Octavian kept chickens; at least he kept some of them; others vanished from his keeping, leaving only a few bloodstained feathers to mark the manner of their going. The <b>tabby</b> <b>cat</b> from the large grey house that stood with its back to the meadow had been detected in many furtive visits to the hen-coups, and after due negotiation with those in authority at the grey house a sentence of death had been agreed on. “The children will mind, but they need not know,” had been the last word on the matter.|$|E

5000|$|Onstage, Mungojerrie and Rumpleteazer {{are usually}} costumed as orange, black and brown calico or <b>tabby</b> <b>cats.</b> Their relation, be it siblings, friends or mates, is unknown. In the {{original}} Broadway production, they wore baggy clown-like costumes seemingly made of various food wrappers as characters performing for Bustopher Jones. Generally, Mungojerrie's costume is a darker, more heavily striped tabby pattern, while Rumpleteazer is paler. However, when they perform their duet song, they have additional costume pieces that vary by which {{version of the}} song is performed: a vest and stockings for Mungojerrie and a leotard and stockings for the original Rumpleteazer, or pearls for the modern Rumpleteazer. This {{has the effect of}} making them appear almost identically marked.|$|R
