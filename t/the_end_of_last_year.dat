Colin Smythe, his long-term friend and agent, donated some pieces of meteoric iron – 'thunderbolt iron' has a special place in magic and we put that in the smelt, and I remember when we sawed the iron apart it looked like silver.

[...] She later told Inside Soap that the storyline was [...] "really exciting", calling it [...] "cleverly written so {{no one knows who}} Kat's secret lover is—not even me or the mystery man himself.

The scriptwriters have been brilliant at putting everyone in the frame. I can't wait to find out who it is!", and said that Kat loves being the centre of attention when she charms each of the suspects to join the football team, especially as her marriage to Alfie has lost its spark. She said that [...] "Alfie has always loved Kat's sexy side, so he doesn't see any harm in [...] It's just that Kat doesn't think he has the same interest in her that he used to. Alfie just seems content with domestic life, and the passion has gone." [...] Speaking of Kat's motivation for the affair, Wallace told Inside Soap that [...] "Kat feels deflated, as [...] haven't had much alone time lately, but her mood is soon lifted when she hears the football lads chanting her name and goes back down to the bar. Later, she's cleaning in the kitchen when someone walks in. At first she thinks it's Alfie, but she's surprised to see it's one of the other team members.

60|$|A further account {{has been}} {{published}} by Dr. Howe, since the report from which I have just quoted. It describes her rapid mental growth and improvement during twelve months more, and brings her little history down to <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>last</b> <b>year.</b> It is very remarkable, that as we dream in words, and carry on imaginary conversations, in which we speak both for ourselves and for the shadows who appear to us in those visions of the night, so she, having no words, uses her finger alphabet in her sleep. And it has been ascertained that when her slumber is broken, and is much disturbed by dreams, she expresses her thoughts in an irregular and confused manner on her fingers: just as we should murmur and mutter them indistinctly, in the like circumstances.|$|E
60|$|The {{book was}} {{in yet another}} respect of the {{greatest}} importance to me, in that it brought back to my remembrance events through which I had lived--now showing me much that I had overlooked, now transplanting me to some unexpected standpoint, thus forcing me to reconsider a question which I had looked upon as settled, and in a special manner putting me {{in a position to}} pass judgment upon the unfavourable critics of this book--for these cannot fail--and to estimate at their true value the objections which are sure to be made from their side. From all this you will understand how <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>last</b> <b>year</b> could have brought with it no gift more welcome to me than this book. The work has become to me as it were a golden net, wherewith I can recover from out the waves of Lethe the shadowy pictures of my past life, and in that rich draught I am finding my present employment.|$|E
60|$|Yours of the 22d was {{received}} yesterday. When I wrote you before, I did not intend, nor do I now, {{to engage in}} an argument with you on military questions.

I repeat that my appreciation of you has not abated. I can never forget whilst I remember anything, that about <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>last</b> <b>year</b> and the beginning of this, you gave us a hard-earned victory, which, had there been a defeat instead, the nation could hardly have lived over.

2500|$|The last glacial {{period is}} {{sometimes}} colloquially {{referred to as}} the [...] "last ice age", though this use is incorrect because an ice age is a longer period of cold temperature in which ice sheets cover large parts of the Earth, such as Antarctica.

Thus, <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> glacial period is not <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> ice age. <b>The</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> glacial period was about 11,700 years ago, while <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> ice age has not yet come.|$|R
6000|$|About <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>last</b> <b>year,</b> that war, {{a war of}} the Tupuas under Tamasese the younger, {{which was}} a {{necessary}} pendant to the crushing of Mataafa, began to make itself heard of in obscure grumblings. It was but a timid business. One half of the Tupua party, the whole province of Atua, never joined the rebellion, but sulked in their villages and spent the time in indecisive eloquence and barren embassies. Tamasese, by a trick eminently Samoan, [...] "went in the high bush and the mountains," [...] carrying a gun like a private soldier--served, in fact, with his own troops incognito--and thus, to Samoan eyes, waived his dynastic pretensions. And the war, which was announced in the beginning with a long catalogue of complaints against the King and a distinct and ugly threat to the white population of Apia, degenerated into a war of defence by the province of Aána against the eminently brutal troops of Savaii, in which sympathy was generally and justly with the rebels. Savaii, raging with private clan hatred and the lust of destruction, was put at free quarters in the disaffected province, repeated on a wider scale the outrages of Manono and Apolima, cut down the food-trees, stripped and insulted the women, robbed the children of their little possessions, burned the houses, killed the horses, the pigs, the dogs, the cats, along {{one half of the}} seaboard of Aána, and in the prosecution of these manly exploits managed (to the joy of all) to lose some sixty men killed, wounded, and drowned.|$|E
6000|$|Having {{regard to}} that part of the {{question}} which concerns the issue between the two Houses, we repudiate emphatically the claim of the other House to what the French call faire l'ange--to [...] "play the angel," [...] to know better than the people themselves what the people want, to have a greater authority to speak {{in the name of the}} people than their representatives sent to Parliament by the elaborate process I have described. To dispute the authority of a newly elected Parliament is something very like an incitement to violence on the part of the other House. The noble Lord[6] laughs; but we are anxious to convince him and his friends that we are in earnest. We go through all the processes which the Constitution prescribes, we produce an enormous majority, and we express the opinion of that majority, but still the noble Lord and other noble Lords, less intelligent, but more remote, tell us that they are not convinced. What steps do they suggest that we should take in order to bring home to them the earnestness of our plea? What steps do they suggest that the people should take in order to assert their wishes? I hold entirely by what I said that to dispute the authority of an elected body fresh from its constituents is a deliberate incitement to the adoption of lawless and unconstitutional methods. The assertion which the House of Lords made at <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>last</b> <b>year</b> is an intolerable assertion. I believe the country is altogether unprepared for it; and I wonder it was thought worth while to risk an institution which has lasted so many centuries, in the very skirmish line of Party warfare.|$|E
60|$|Toward <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>last</b> <b>year,</b> I spent a {{few months}} in Munich, Bavaria. In November I was living in Fraulein Dahlweiner's PENSION, 1a, Karlstrasse; but my working {{quarters}} were a mile from there, in the house of a widow who supported herself by taking lodgers. She and her two young children used to drop in every morning and talk German to me--by request. One day, during a ramble about the city, I visited one of the two establishments where the Government keeps and watches corpses until the doctors decide that they are permanently dead, and not in a trance state. It was a grisly place, that spacious room. There were thirty-six corpses of adults in sight, stretched on their backs on slightly slanted boards, in three long rows--all of them with wax-white, rigid faces, and all of them wrapped in white shrouds. Along the sides of the room were deep alcoves, like bay windows; and in each of these lay several marble-visaged babes, utterly hidden and buried under banks of fresh flowers, all but their faces and crossed hands. Around a finger of each of these fifty still forms, both great and small, was a ring; and from the ring a wire led to the ceiling, and thence to a bell in a watch-room yonder, where, day and night, a watchman sits always alert and ready to spring to the aid of any of that pallid company who, waking out of death, shall make a movement--for any, even the slightest, movement will twitch the wire and ring that fearful bell. I imagined myself a death-sentinel drowsing there alone, far in the dragging watches of some wailing, gusty night, and having in a twinkling all my body stricken to quivering jelly by the sudden clamor of that awful summons! So I inquired about this thing; asked what resulted usually? if the watchman died, and the restored corpse came and did what it could to make his last moments easy. But I was rebuked for trying to feed an idle and frivolous curiosity in so solemn and so mournful a place; and went my way with a humbled crest.|$|E

60|$|For {{the last}} and worst of the {{mistakes}} on the Laupepa side {{it would be unfair}} to blame any but the king himself. Capable both of virtuous resolutions and of fits of apathetic obstinacy, His Majesty is usually the whip-top of competitive advisers; and his conduct is so unstable as to wear at times an appearance of treachery which would surprise himself if he could see it. Take, for example, the experience of Lieutenant Ulfsparre, late chief of police, and (so to speak) commander of the forces. His men were under orders for a certain hour; he found himself almost alone at the place of muster, and learned the king had sent the soldiery on errands. He sought an audience, explained that he was here to implant discipline, that (with this purpose in view) his men could only receive orders through himself, and if that condition were not agreed to and faithfully observed, he must send in his papers. The king was as usual easily persuaded, the interview passed and ended to the satisfaction of all parties engaged--and the bargain was kept for one day. On the day after, the troops were again dispersed as post-runners, and their commander resigned. With such a sovereign, I repeat, it would be unfair to blame any individual minister for any specific fault. And yet the policy of our two whites against Mataafa has appeared uniformly so excessive and implacable, that the blame of the last scandal is laid generally at their doors. It is yet fresh. Lauati, towards <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>last</b> <b>year,</b> became deeply concerned about the situation; and by great personal exertions and the charms of oratory brought Savaii and Manono into agreement upon certain terms of compromise: Laupepa still to be king, Mataafa to accept a high executive office comparable to that of our own prime minister, and the two governments to coalesce. Intractable Manono was a party. Malie was said to view the proposal with resignation, if not relief. Peace was thought secure. The night before the king was to receive Lauati, I met one of his company,--the family chief, Iina,--and we shook hands over the unexpected issue of our troubles. What no one dreamed was that Laupepa would refuse. And he did. He refused undisputed royalty for himself and peace for these unhappy islands; and the two whites on Mulinuu rightly or wrongly got the blame of it.|$|E

'But Schiller, whom {{still other}} debts in Stuttgart, unknown to his Father, were {{pressing}} hard, could only repay the smaller of these drafts; {{and thus the}} worthy Father saw himself compelled to pay the larger, the 10l., out of the savings he had made for outfit of his Daughters. Whereupon, as was not undeserved, he took his Son tightly to task, and wrote to him: [...] "As long as thou, my Son, shalt make thy reckoning on resources that are still to come, and therefore are still subject to chance and mischance, so long wilt thou continue in thy mess of embarrassments. Furthermore, as long as thou thinkest, This gulden or batzen (shilling or farthing) can't help me to get over it; so long will thy debts become never the smaller: and, what were a sorrow to me, thou wilt not be able, after a heavy labour of head got done, to recreate thyself in the society of other good men. But, withal, to make recreation-days of that kind more numerous than work-days, that surely will not turn out well. Best Son, thy abode in Bauerbach has been of that latter kind. Hinc illæ lacrymæ! For these thou art now suffering, and that not by accident. The embarrassment thou now art in is verily a work of Higher Providence, to lead thee off from too great trust in thy own force; to make thee soft and contrite; that, laying aside all self-will, thou mayest follow more the counsel of thy Father and other true friends; must meet every one with due respectful courtesy and readiness to oblige; and become ever more convinced that our most gracious Duke, in his restrictive plans, meant well with thee; and that altogether thy position and outlooks had now been better, hadst thou complied, and continued in thy country. Many a time I find thou hast wayward humours, that make thee to thy truest friend scarcely endurable; stiff ways which repel the best-wishing man;—for example, when I sent thee my excellent old friend Herr Amtmann Cramer from Altdorf near Speier, {{who had come to}} Herr Hofrath Schwan's in <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>last</b> <b>year,</b> thy reception of him was altogether dry and stingy, though by my Letter I had given thee so good an opportunity to seek the friendship of this honourable, rational and influential man (who has no children of his own), and to try whether he might not have been of help to thee.
