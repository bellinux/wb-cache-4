25|$|The {{belief in}} angels is {{fundamental}} to the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community. They are spiritual beings created by God to obey him and implement his commandments. Unlike human beings, angels have no free will and cannot act independently. Under God's command, they bring revelations to the Prophets, bring punishment on the Prophets' enemies, glorify God with his praise, and keep records of human beings' deeds. Angels are not visible to the physical eye. Yet, according to the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community, they do sometimes appear to man {{in one form or}} another. This appearance, however, is not physical but a spiritual manifestation. Ahmadi Muslims regards angels as celestial beings who have their own entity as persons. The major role they play is the <b>transmission</b> <b>of</b> <b>messages</b> from God to human beings. According to the Quran, the entire material universe as well as the religious universe is governed by some spiritual powers, which are referred to as angels. Whatever they do is in complete submission to the Will of God and the design that he created for things. According to Islam, as interpreted by Ahmadi Muslims, they cannot deviate from the set course or functions allocated to them, or from the overall plan of things made by God.|$|E

[...] The telegraph was some [...] long and enabled the <b>transmission</b> <b>of</b> <b>messages</b> across the African interior for the first time. [...] As a result, Mohun claimed to be known amongst the indigenous peoples along the route as [...] "Big master of the telephone". [...] Mohun, the only white survivor of the expedition, returned to Belgium from the west coast Congo ports and thus completed an east-west traverse of the continent. Mohun {{claimed to be the}} first American to achieve the feat, a credit usually given to Henry Morton Stanley for his 1874-77 expedition. [...] Mohun's claim may have been due to knowing Stanley was a naturalised American citizen born in Wales. He is regarded as one of three Americans who played key roles in opening the Belgian Congo to outsiders, alongside Stanley and the missionary William Henry Sheppard.|$|E

60|$|The framers were wise {{in their}} {{generation}} {{and wanted to}} do the very best possible to secure their own liberty and independence, and that also of their descendants to the latest days. It is preposterous to suppose that the people of one generation can lay down the best and only rules of government for all who are to come after them, and under unforeseen contingencies. At the time of the framing of our constitution the only physical forces that had been subdued and made to serve man and do his labor, were the currents in the streams and in the air we breathe. Rude machinery, propelled by water power, had been invented; sails to propel ships upon the waters had been set to catch the passing breeze--but the application of stream to propel vessels against both wind and current, and machinery to do all manner of work had not been thought of. The instantaneous <b>transmission</b> <b>of</b> <b>messages</b> around the world by means of electricity would probably at that day have been attributed to witchcraft or a league with the Devil. Immaterial circumstances had changed as greatly as material ones. We could not and ought not to be rigidly bound by the rules laid down under circumstances so different for emergencies so utterly unanticipated. The fathers themselves would have been the first to declare that their prerogatives were not irrevocable. They would surely have resisted secession could they have lived to see the shape it assumed.|$|E

40|$|Causal message {{ordering}} is {{a partial}} ordering <b>of</b> <b>messages</b> in a distributed computing environment. It places a restriction on communication between processes by requiring {{that if the}} <b>transmission</b> <b>of</b> <b>message</b> mi to process pk necessarily preceded the <b>transmission</b> <b>of</b> <b>message</b> mj to the same process, then the delivery <b>of</b> these <b>messages</b> to that process must be ordered such that mi is delivered before mj. Causal message ordering is either needed or desirable {{in a variety of}} distributed algorithms such as fault-tolerant object replication, distributed resource allocation and teleconferencing. In this paper we evaluate several algorithms for ensuring causal message ordering in a distributed system. We analyze the algorithms based on two orthogonal axes of optimization, which are message size overhead and non-causal message latency. The best algorithm in each class is detailed, as is some significant prior art that led to the discovery of these algorithms. The minimum message size overhead achievable is O(1) but at the expense of P Ã—Tw non-causal latency, where P is the number of processes in the system and Tw is the worst message time between a process and any other process. By contrast, the non-causal latency can be as low as zero, but with a <b>message</b> size overhead <b>of</b> O(P 2). ...|$|R
