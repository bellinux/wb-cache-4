5|$|A young Addie (Katelyn Reed) {{stares up}} at an old mansion when two {{troublesome}} twins Brian and Troy (Kai and Bodhi Schulz) arrive, planning to enter the house. Addie warns them not to enter the house, but they ignore her warning and enter the house anyway. While they wreak havoc, Brian discovers a dying animal and the twins find an open door to <b>the</b> <b>basement.</b> They enter <b>the</b> <b>basement</b> where they find jars containing animal remains and human fetuses. After complaining about the smell, Brian leaves <b>the</b> <b>basement</b> {{only to find that}} his brother has gone silent. He searches for him and finds him with his throat slit, gasping for air. The Infantata (Ben Woolf) appears behind him and kills him off screen.|$|E
5|$|Around 1919 <b>the</b> <b>basement</b> {{was first}} leased to a pool hall, “Dad’s Billiard Room”. While this {{business}} {{was not present}} in 1920, <b>the</b> <b>basement</b> would house a pool hall continuously from 1927 into the 1970s.|$|E
5|$|The {{tower was}} terraced {{into the side}} of a mound, so the {{northern}} side of <b>the</b> <b>basement</b> is partially below ground level. As was typical of most keeps, the bottom floor was an undercroft used for storage. One of the rooms contained a well. Although the layout has remained the same since the tower's construction, the interior of <b>the</b> <b>basement</b> dates mostly from the 18thcentury when the floor was lowered and the pre-existing timber vaults were replaced with brick counterparts. <b>The</b> <b>basement</b> is lit through small slits.|$|E
50|$|There was {{no crime}} scene {{investigation}} and no judicial authority {{was allowed to}} enter <b>the</b> <b>basements.</b> Instead <b>the</b> Turkish authorities arranged that the ruins were flattened, <b>the</b> <b>basements</b> filled up with rubble, and bodies were taken away. Therefore, Human Rights Watch suspects a cover-up.|$|R

Upon reaching <b>the</b> <b>basement,</b> something attacks Mike and causes him to drop the camera and go silent. Heather enters <b>the</b> <b>basement</b> screaming, and her camera captures Mike facing a corner. Something then attacks Heather, causing her to drop her camera and go silent as well. The footage continues for another moment and then ends.|$|E
5|$|Above <b>the</b> <b>basement</b> rise two storeys, ornamented with quatrefoils and niches {{originally}} holding {{about four}} hundred statues, with three hundred surviving until the mid-20th century.

5|$|According to the {{accounts}} {{of some of the}} guards, there may have been an opportunity for {{one or more of the}} guards to rescue a survivor.

There was reportedly a span of time when the bodies of the victims were left largely unattended in the truck, in <b>the</b> <b>basement,</b> and in the corridor of the house. Some guards who had not participated in the murders and had been sympathetic to the grand duchesses were left in <b>the</b> <b>basement</b> with the bodies.|$|E

5|$|In late December {{the last}} of the {{survivors}} that were able to be extricated were pulled from the fallen buildings, rescue operations ceased, and the cleanup began, beginning with the destruction of buildings that were too heavily damaged to be repaired. Six friends were in <b>the</b> <b>basement</b> of a nine-story building relocating barrels when it came down around them on December 7.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Basement</b> Tapes is {{a studio}} album by American singer-songwriter Bob Dylan and The Band. It was {{released}} on June 26, 1975, by Columbia Records and is Dylan's 16th studio album.

50|$|Both the children's and adults' {{buildings}} are {{connected by a}} series of underground tunnels, like many sanitariums.

Large pieces of rusty, sharp metal, cloth and debris hang from the ceiling, and the buildings contain large amounts of asbestos and lead paint. Each hospital basement has its own morgue. Today, these walkways are littered with garbage, broken glass, and graffiti. <b>The</b> hospital <b>basements</b> are also infested with rats and bats. In addition, parts of the walkways are flooded with nearly 3 ft of water.|$|R
5|$|The Port of Liverpool Building was {{constructed}} using a reinforced concrete frame, {{which not only}} made the building structurally strong, but also much more fire resistant than buildings in the past. As {{a result of being}} built {{on the site of the}} former George’s Dock, the building required deeper foundations than normal and in total some 35,000 tons of cement were used. Due to the building’s proximity to the River Mersey, extensive work was carried out during the development of <b>the</b> <b>basement</b> level in order to make sure it was water resistant. Asphalt was used extensively to coat the floors and walls of <b>the</b> <b>basement,</b> in order to make sure it stayed dry.|$|E
