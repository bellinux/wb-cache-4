2500|$|In New South Wales, {{students}} are being issued with Lenovo laptops {{no bigger than}} a sheet of A4 paper. In 2009 the model issued was the IdeaPad S10e, in 2010, the ThinkPad Mini 10 in 2011, the ThinkPad Edge 11, in 2012 the ThinkPad X130e which has been uniquely designed [...] and in 2013, the ThinkPad X131e. The laptops also come with pre-installed software, such as Adobe CS5, Adobe LiveCycle ES2, Microsoft Office 2010, and Microsoft Forefront. In June 2010 a recall of laptop cases was issued after it was found that there was a flaw {{in the design of the}} case when several students reported that their screens had cracks. The New South Wales Department of Education and Training's Chief Information Officer Stephen Wilson said that the filtering system on the laptops is impervious and no student will be able to break through the system. [...] "Our internet filtering is unbreakable. We have a huge proxy array that does all the filtering. We've just brought that in-house and <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> done that is we want much tighter control over it, every internet site that's known is actually categorised. If it isn't known, it's blocked. If you go to a site and it's not categorised you can't get to it," [...] said Wilson.|$|E

40|$|Physicalism is {{the claim}} that {{that there is nothing}} in the world but the physical. Philosophers who defend physicalism have to confront a {{well-known}} dilemma, known as Hempel’s dilemma, concerning the definition of “the physical”: if “the physical ” is whatever current physics says there is, then physicalism is most probably false; but if “the physical ” is whatever the true theory of physics would say that there is, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> that physicalism is vacuous and runs the risk of becoming trivial. This paper has two parts. The first, negative, part is devoted to developing a criticism of the so-called via negativa response to Hempel’s dilemma. In the second, more substantial, part, I propose to take the first horn of Hempel’s dilemma. However, I argue for a broad construal of “current physics ” and characterize “the physical ” accordingly. The virtues of the broad characterization of “the physical ” are: first, it makes physicalism less likely to be false; and second, it ties our understanding of “the physical ” to <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> for believing in physicalism. That is, it fulfills the desideratum of construing our theses according to <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> to believe in them. 1...|$|R

60|$|The {{horror of}} this barbarous action, {{increased}} by the sacredness {{of the person}} who suffered and of the place where it was committed, diffused itself on all sides with incredible rapidity. The clergy, in whose cause he fell, equalled him to the most holy martyrs; compassion for his fate made all men forget his faults; and the report of frequent miracles at his tomb sanctified his cause and character, and threw a general odium on the king. What became of the murderers is uncertain: they were neither protected by the king nor punished by the laws, for <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> not long since mentioned. The king with infinite difficulty extricated himself from the consequences of this murder, which threatened, under the Papal banners, to arm all Europe against him; nor was he absolved, but by renouncing the most material parts of the Constitutions of Clarendon, by purging himself upon oath of the murder of Becket, by doing a very humiliating penance at his tomb to expiate the rash words which had given occasion to his death, and by engaging to furnish a large sum of money for the relief of the Holy Land, and taking the cross himself as soon as his affairs should admit it. The king probably thought his freedom from the haughtiness of Becket cheaply purchased by these condescensions: and without question, though Becket might have been justifiable, perhaps even laudable, for his steady maintenance of the privileges which his Church and his order had acquired by the care of his predecessors, and of which he by his place was the depository, yet the principles upon which he supported these privileges, subversive of all good government, his extravagant ideas of Church power, the schemes he meditated, even to his death, to extend it yet further, his violent and unreserved attachment to the Papacy, and that inflexible spirit which all his virtues rendered but the more dangerous, made his death as advantageous, at that time, as the means by which it was effected were sacrilegious and detestable.|$|E
60|$|IN THE {{consideration}} of the faculties and impulses--of the prima mobilia of the human soul, the phrenologists have failed {{to make room for}} a propensity which, although obviously existing as a radical, primitive, irreducible sentiment, has been equally overlooked by all the moralists who have preceded them. In the pure arrogance of <b>the</b> <b>reason,</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> all overlooked it. We have suffered its existence to escape our senses, solely through want of belief--of faith;--whether it be faith in Revelation, or faith in the Kabbala. The idea of it has never occurred to us, simply because of its supererogation. We saw no need of the impulse--for the propensity. We could not perceive its necessity. We could not understand, that is to say, we could not have understood, had the notion of this primum mobile ever obtruded itself;--we could not have understood in what manner it might be made to further the objects of humanity, either temporal or eternal. It cannot be denied that phrenology and, in great measure, all metaphysicianism have been concocted a priori. The intellectual or logical man, rather than the understanding or observant man, set himself to imagine designs--to dictate purposes to God. Having thus fathomed, to his satisfaction, the intentions of Jehovah, out of these intentions he built his innumerable systems of mind. In the matter of phrenology, for example, we first determined, naturally enough, that it was the design of the Deity that man should eat. We then assigned to man an organ of alimentiveness, and this organ is the scourge with which the Deity compels man, will-I nill-I, into eating. Secondly, having settled it to be God's will that man should continue his species, we discovered an organ of amativeness, forthwith. And so with combativeness, with ideality, with causality, with constructiveness,--so, in short, with every organ, whether representing a propensity, a moral sentiment, or a faculty of the pure intellect. And in these arrangements of the Principia of human action, the Spurzheimites, whether right or wrong, in part, or upon the whole, have but followed, in principle, the footsteps of their predecessors: deducing and establishing every thing from the preconceived destiny of man, and upon the ground of the objects of his Creator.|$|E
