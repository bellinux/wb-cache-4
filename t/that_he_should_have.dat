5|$|Little is {{revealed}} of Quatermass's early life {{during the course}} of the films and television series in which he appears. In The Quatermass Experiment, he at one point despairs <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> stuck to his original career as a surveyor.|$|E
5|$|Bamber {{launched}} two legal actions {{while in}} prison {{to secure a}} share of the estate, which the cousins said was part of an attempt to harass and vilify them. In 2003 he began a High Court action to recover £1.2m from the estate of his adoptive grandmother, arguing <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> inherited her home at Carbonnells Farm, Wix, Essex, which went instead to June's sister—the grandmother had cut Bamber out of her will when he was arrested—and that he was owed 17 years' rent from his cousins who lived there. In 2004 he went to the High Court again to claim a £326,000 share of the profit from the caravan site. The court ruled against him.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} Robert dies, Renly has fled the capital, and Joffrey has already ordered his own {{coronation}} within a fortnight. As Ned {{and his allies}} enter the throne room, he gives Ser Barristan Selmy Robert's will to read out aloud. Cersei refuses to follow Robert's will and tears it up, ordering Barristan to seize Ned. Ned orders his men to arrest Cersei and Joffrey. As both sides prepare to fight, the City Watch slaughters the Stark men while Littlefinger holds Ned with a knife at his throat, telling Ned <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> listened to Littlefinger's advice about distrusting him.|$|E

60|$|One morning, accordingly, when {{alone with}} the count, he said to him <b>that</b> <b>he</b> feared <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> to leave for England in a few days, and it was {{probable}} <b>he</b> <b>should</b> shortly join his ship.|$|R
5|$|In 1643, Governor Winthrop became {{embroiled in}} a {{controversy}} over the propriety of taking sides in a power struggle going on in neighbouring French Acadia. Endecott pointed out <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> let the French fight amongst themselves without English involvement, as this would weaken them both. The 1644 governor's election became a referendum on Winthrop's policy; Endecott was elected governor, with Winthrop as his deputy. During his one-year term he oversaw {{the division of the}} colony into four counties: Suffolk, Essex, Middlesex, and Norfolk. The ascent of the Salem-based Endecott also prompted an attempt by other Salem residents to have the colonial capital relocated there; the attempt was rejected by the governor's council of assistants.|$|E
5|$|In May 1945, when Nazi Germany surrendered, and {{the initial}} {{motivation}} for the crash atomic bomb project dissipated as {{it was discovered that}} the German nuclear energy project was years behind, Wilson raised the question of whether they should continue with their work. News of this met with an icy reception from Major General Leslie Groves, director of the Manhattan Project. In later life, when interviewed in the Oscar-nominated documentary The Day After Trinity (1980), Wilson would say <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> strongly considered ceasing work on the bomb after the surrender of Germany, and regretted not doing so to some extent.|$|E
5|$|In his High Court appeal Dietrich was {{represented}} by David Grace, QC. The main argument advanced on Dietrich's behalf was that his trial was a miscarriage of justice, since {{he did not have}} legal representation. He argued <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> been provided with counsel at public expense, given the seriousness of the crime with which he was charged. Alternatively, he argued that the judge should have stayed or adjourned the trial until he was able to obtain counsel himself. His argument was based on the common law tradition that an accused is entitled to a fair trial.|$|E

60|$|Young Joe Clark couldn't bear it, {{but being}} down in 'is uncle's will for five cottages {{and a bit}} o' land {{bringing}} in about forty pounds a year, he 'ad to 'ide his feelings and pretend as he loved it. He used to take it little drops o' cream and tit-bits o' meat, and old Clark was so pleased <b>that</b> <b>'e</b> promised 'im <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>'ave</b> the cat {{along with all the}} other property when 'e was dead.|$|R
5|$|Between 1935 and 1937, Kenyatta was {{employed}} as a linguistic informant for the Phonetics Department at University College London (UCL); his voice recordings of the Kikuyu language assisted Lilias Armstrong in her production of The Phonetic and Tonal Structure of Kikuyu. The book was posthumously published under Armstrong's name, although Kenyatta claimed <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> been recognised as co-author. He enrolled at UCL as a student, studying an English course between January and July 1935 and then a course in phonetics from October 1935 to June 1936. Enabled {{by a grant from}} the International African Institute, he also took a social anthropology course under Bronisław Malinowski at the London School of Economics (LSE). Kenyatta lacked the qualifications normally required to join the course, but Malinowski was keen to support the participation of indigenous peoples in anthropological research. For Kenyatta, acquiring an advanced degree would bolster his status among Kenyans and display his intellectual equality with white Europeans.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the discoveries}} of Richard's remains in 2012, {{it was decided}} that they should be reburied at Leicester Cathedral, despite {{feelings}} in some quarters <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> been reburied in York Minster. His remains were carried in procession to the cathedral on 22 March 2015, and reburied on 26 March 2015 at a religious re-burial service at which both the Right Reverend Tim Stevens, the Bishop of Leicester, and the Most Reverend Justin Welby, the Archbishop of Canterbury, officiated. The British Royal Family was represented by the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester and the Countess of Wessex. The actor Benedict Cumberbatch, who is a distant relation of the king and later portrayed him in The Hollow Crown television series, read a poem by Poet Laureate Carol Ann Duffy.|$|E
5|$|In the Fourth Test at Headingley, England batted {{first on}} a pitch {{regarded}} as being ideal for strokeplay, and Australia's bowlers had little {{success on the}} first day. Early in the day, Johnston appeared to be having back problems. He had bowled the most overs of any bowler on the tour and his loss would have meant a heavy workload for his remaining colleagues. His apparent discomfort led onlookers to opine <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> been given more rest in the county matches. After an opening partnership of 143, England consolidated to reach 1/268 in the last over of the day before Johnston removed Washbrook for 143. Johnston did not taste further success in the first innings and ended with 1/86 from 38 overs as the home team ended on 496, their highest score of the series.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{after his}} {{election}} as president in 1960, Kennedy chose Cooper {{to conduct a}} then-secret mission to Moscow and New Delhi to assess {{the attitudes of the}} Soviet government for the new administration. Kennedy and Cooper had served together on the Senate Labor Committee and maintained a social friendship. On the mission, Cooper discovered that the Soviets disliked Kennedy and Nixon equally. Cooper concluded in his report to Kennedy that there was little potential for harmonious relations with the Soviets. After meeting with Secretary Khruschev, Kennedy confirmed to Cooper that his report had been correct and confessed <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> taken it even more seriously. Cooper supported Kennedy's decision to resume nuclear weapons testing after the Soviets resumed their testing in March 1962, but he urged Kennedy to negotiate an agreement with the Soviets if possible.|$|E
5|$|The Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles {{was founded}} in 1977 by Rabbi Marvin Hier using large {{donations}} from philanthropists Samuel Belzberg and Joseph Tennenbaum. Hier's organisation paid Wiesenthal an honorarium {{for the right to}} use his name. The center helped with the campaign to remove the statute of limitations on Nazi crimes and continues the hunt for suspected Nazi war criminals, but today its primary activities include Holocaust remembrance, education, and fighting antisemitism. The center's Holocaust museum, the largest in the United States, opened in 1993. Moriah Films, the center's media division, has won two Academy Awards, including one for the documentary Genocide (1982). Wiesenthal was not always happy with the way the center was run. He thought the museum was not dignified enough and <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> a larger say in the overall operations. He even wrote to the Board of Directors requesting Hier's removal, but in the end had to be content with being a figurehead.|$|E
5|$|When {{war broke}} out in Europe in 1939, Learned Hand adopted an anti-isolationist stance. He rarely spoke out publicly, {{not only because of}} his {{position}} but because he thought bellicosity unseemly in an old man. In February 1939, he became his court's senior circuit leader (in effect, chief judge, although the title was not created until 1948). In this post, Hand succeeded Martin Manton, who had resigned after corruption allegations that later led to Manton's criminal conviction for bribery. Not an admirer of Manton, Hand nonetheless testified at his trial that he had never noticed any corrupt behavior in his predecessor. Having sat in two cases in which Manton accepted bribes, Hand worried for years afterward <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> detected his colleague's corruption.|$|E

5|$|The {{next night}} is Krusty's {{farewell}} special, and as Krusty describes {{the history of}} his career, Bob straps Bart with explosives in order to kill Krusty. Bart attempts to hug Krusty, thereby setting off the explosives, but before he can, Krusty talks to the audience about how he regrets mistreating Sideshow Bob, holding himself responsible of turning Bob into a ruthless criminal. Krusty even goes far by singing a song on behalf of Bob, stating how very remorseful he is of mistreating him. Upon witnessing this, Bob is touched and develops a change of heart, but does {{not have time to}} stop his original plan from being carried out. Luckily, Krusty's trained chimp Mr. Teeny sees the life-threatening explosives, which he throws into the network executives' office, killing all the executives, though they would later reanimate themselves like the T-1000 from Terminator 2. Bart comes out of his hypnotic state and he and his family serve dinner with Krusty, Bob and Sideshow Mel in a restaurant. Although Krusty and Bob reconcile, police decide to execute Bob by guillotine for his plot of attempted murder, although he argues with Chief Wiggum <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> a trial for it at least.|$|E
5|$|Saturday evening's {{qualifying}} {{session was}} divided into three parts. The first part ran for twenty minutes and eliminated the cars that finished the session eighteenth or lower. The second part of qualifying lasted fifteen minutes and eliminated cars that finished in positions eleven to seventeen. The final part of qualifying determined the positions from first to tenth and decided pole position. Cars which competed in the final qualifying session {{were not allowed to}} change tyres before the race; these started the race fitted with the tyres with which they set their quickest lap times. It was held in dry weather conditions. Alonso was fastest in the first and third sessions, and clinched his second consecutive pole position with a lap time of 1:45.390 which he set on his first run of the third session. He was restricted to one timed lap in the second session because of an engine mapping problem, which meant Ferrari immediately re-programmed Alonso's engine upon discovering the issue. Alonso was joined on the front row of the grid by Vettel, who recorded a lap 0.067seconds off Alonso's pace, and felt he could have taken pole position as he misjudged a gap while following Schumacher and brushed the wall exiting the Singapore Sling chicane. Hamilton qualified third and was happy with his starting position despite losing downforce on the track's final sector while running in teammate Button's tow. Button secured fourth and pushed hard in the final session which meant he had slight damage to his rear tyres on his first run, and could not get the optimum tyre temperature in the first section on his second run. Webber managed fifth and admitted that he was struggling to find a good rhythm when driving the circuit. Barrichello qualified in sixth. The two Mercedes drivers took seventh and ninth; Rosberg ahead of Schumacher. Rosberg believed <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> performed better in qualifying than in the practice session, as he felt the soft tyres lacked grip; Schumacher was satisfied with his qualifying performance. The Mercedes drivers were separated by Kubica, in the faster Renault, who was happy with his lap time despite his car sliding from a lack of grip. Kobayashi rounded out the top ten qualifiers.|$|E

60|$|Miss Deringham {{felt that}} she had trespassed, but was {{astonished}} that this teamster <b>should</b> <b>have</b> wit enough to silence her with a compliment. She also decided <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> not <b>have</b> the opportunity again.|$|R
25|$|Scott Ritter, former Chief UN Weapons Inspector in Iraq, stated at {{the time}} that McChrystal should be fired for insubordination for {{disclosing}} information <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> said only in private to the President of the United States.|$|E
