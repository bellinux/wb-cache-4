5|$|Although the June 28, 1969, Stonewall riots are {{generally}} considered {{the starting point}} of the modern gay liberation movement, a number of demonstrations and actions took place before that date. These actions, often organized by local homophile organizations but sometimes spontaneous, addressed concerns ranging from anti-gay discrimination in employment and public accommodations to the exclusion of homosexuals from the United States military to police harassment <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>treatment</b> of homosexuals in revolutionary Cuba. The early actions have been credited with preparing the gay community for Stonewall and contributing to the riots' symbolic power.|$|E

Using his military experience, Matthews consulted with the film crew and helped direct the actors playing Colonial Marines. According to fellow Aliens actor Daniel Kash, Matthews improvised much of his performance and based it on his Vietnam War experience. His performance influenced the military science fiction subgenre, with the charismatic black commander inspiring the character of Sergeant Avery Johnson in the Halo video-game franchise.|$|E

5|$|Most of the {{accounts}} of ancient versions were rewritten by distinguished scholars, who were leaders in their several departments. The early part of Volume I was enriched from the admirable book on “Greek and Latin Palaeography”, by Edward Maunde Thompson. Many corrections suggested by eminent scholars were introduced in different places throughout the book. H. J. White rewrote the chapter on Latin versions. G. H. Gwilliam, editor of the Peshitta, helped to improve the passages on the Peshitta and the Curetonian Version. H. Deane made an additions <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>treatment</b> of the Harkleian Version. A. C. Headlam made a revision of the long chapter on the Egyptian versions; F. C. Conybeare, rewrote the sections on the Armenian and Georgian versions; Margoliouth rewrote the sections on the Arabic and Ethiopic versions; J. M. Bebb rewrote the section on the Slavonic version; James W. Bright rewrote the section on the Anglo-Saxon Version.|$|E
5|$|On {{arrival at}} Falmouth, England, after a {{crossing}} under filthy conditions, Allen {{and the other}} prisoners were imprisoned in Pendennis Castle, Cornwall.

Unknown to Allen, British prisoners now included General Prescott, captured trying to escape from Montreal, and the letter came {{into the hands of}} the British cabinet. Also faced with opposition within the British establishment <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>treatment</b> of captives taken in North America, King George decreed that the men should be sent back to America and treated as prisoners of war.|$|E
5|$|One such {{success is}} related to {{identifying}} the genetic variant associated with response to anti-hepatitis C virus treatment. For genotype 1 hepatitis C treated with Pegylated interferon-alpha-2a or Pegylated interferon-alpha-2b combined with ribavirin, a GWA study has shown that SNPs near the human IL28B gene, encoding interferon lambda 3, are associated with significant differences in response <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>treatment.</b> A later report demonstrated that the same genetic variants are also associated with the natural clearance of the genotype 1 hepatitis C virus. These major findings facilitated the development of personalized medicine and allowed physicians to customize medical decisions based on the patient's genotype.|$|E

Among the Malays of Riau, arranged marriages were common, and women would sometimes be married to men older than their father.

This group developed into a wider pan-Africanist organisation, the International African Service Bureau (IASB), which Kenyatta joined. Kenyatta began giving anti-colonial lectures across Britain for groups like the IASB and the Workers' Educational Association. In October 1938, he gave a talk to the Manchester Fabian Society in which he described British colonial policy as fascism and compared the treatment of indigenous people in East Africa <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>treatment</b> of Jews in Nazi Germany.
