5|$|In 1147 while Byzantine emperor Manuel I Komnenos was {{focusing}} all {{his efforts}} on the Second Crusade, <b>the</b> <b>Norman</b> king Roger II of Sicily attacked Corinth and Thebes, two important centres of Byzantine silk production. They took the crops and silk production infrastructure, and deported all the workers to Palermo, thereby causing <b>the</b> <b>Norman</b> silk industry to flourish.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, the Byzantine {{right and}} centre had been {{engaging}} in skirmishes with the Normans opposite them. However, {{with the collapse}} of <b>the</b> <b>Norman</b> right, the knights were in danger of being outflanked. At this point, the Varangians (mainly Anglo-Saxons who had left England after <b>the</b> <b>Norman</b> Conquest) joined in the pursuit of <b>the</b> <b>Norman</b> right. With their massive battle axes, the Varangians attacked <b>the</b> <b>Norman</b> knights, who were driven away after their horses panicked. The Varangians soon became separated from the main force and exhausted so they were in no position to resist an assault. Guiscard sent a strong force of spearmen and crossbowmen against the Varangian flank and inflicted heavy casualties on them. The few remaining Varangians fled into the church of the Archangel Michael. The Normans immediately set the church on fire, and all Varangians perished in the blaze.|$|E

5000|$|The {{availability}} of this mercenary force (<b>the</b> <b>Normans</b> were famous for being militariter lucrum quaerens, [...] "seeking wealth through military service") {{could not escape}} the notice of the Christian rulers of Southern Italy, who employed <b>the</b> <b>Normans</b> in their internal wars. <b>The</b> <b>Normans</b> took advantage of this turmoil; in 1030, Rainulf Drengot obtained the County of Aversa.|$|R
5|$|In {{the regions}} of Saint-Lo and Cotentin, <b>the</b> <b>Norman</b> Cob was {{widespread}} in agricultural uses until 1950, and the population continued to increase {{in the first half}} of the 20th century, even through the occupation during World War II. Even the Percheron, which was internationally recognized as <b>the</b> <b>Norman</b> draft horse, was not as popular in the homeland of <b>the</b> <b>Norman</b> Cob breed. In 1945, Norman Cob stallions accounted for 40% of the conscripted horses, and in 1950 a studbook was created for the breed.|$|E
5|$|Lydford Castle is {{a medieval}} castle {{in the town}} of Lydford, Devon, England. The first castle in Lydford, {{sometimes}} termed <b>the</b> <b>Norman</b> fort, was a small ringwork built {{in a corner of the}} Anglo-Saxon fortified burh in the years after <b>the</b> <b>Norman</b> conquest of England. It was intended to help control Devon following the widespread revolt against Norman rule in 1068. <b>The</b> <b>Norman</b> fort had been abandoned by the middle of the 12th century.|$|E

50|$|The {{forces of}} Brian Ua Néill had been raiding Norman-held {{territory}} in Ulster after 1257 {{in an attempt}} to assert their independence and form a coalition of the Irish against <b>the</b> <b>Normans.</b> Ua Néill allied with Aedh mac Fedhlimidh Ua Conchobhair of Connacht and together with their men went into battle against <b>the</b> <b>Normans.</b> According to <b>the</b> Annals of Innisfallen, <b>the</b> <b>Normans</b> had gathered an army of mostly Irish Gaelic mercenaries to fight against the coalition, and <b>the</b> <b>Normans</b> themselves played only a small role in the fighting. Many of the Irish clans in Leinster, Ulster, Munster, Meath and Breifne, which were under <b>Norman</b> rule at <b>the</b> time, provided <b>the</b> <b>Normans</b> with <b>the</b> bulk of their fighting forces, serving as mercenaries and retained bands. Thus, most of the battles between <b>the</b> <b>Normans</b> and Irish at this time would have seemed more like battles between the Irish themselves. Brian Ua Néill was defeated and killed together with a number of Uí Catháin chiefs.|$|R

50|$|The Pope {{had also}} another {{friendly}} power, the Byzantine Empire ruled by Constantine IX. At first, the Byzantines, established in Apulia, {{had tried to}} buy off <b>the</b> <b>Normans</b> and press them into service within their own largely mercenary army; since <b>the</b> <b>Normans</b> were famous for their avarice. So, the Byzantine commander, the Lombard Catepan of Italy Argyrus, offered money to disperse as mercenaries to the Eastern frontiers of the Empire, but <b>the</b> <b>Normans</b> rejected <b>the</b> proposal, explicitly stating that their aim was the conquest of southern Italy. Thus spurned, Argyrus contacted the Pope, and when Leo and his army moved from Rome to Apulia to engage <b>the</b> <b>Normans</b> in battle, a Byzantine army personally led by Argyrus moved from Apulia with the same plan, catching <b>the</b> <b>Normans</b> in a pinch.|$|R

5|$|Castles {{have played}} an {{important}} military, economic and social role in Great Britain and Ireland since their introduction following <b>the</b> <b>Norman</b> invasion of England in 1066. Although {{a small number of}} castles had been built in England in the 1050s, the Normans began to build motte and bailey and ringworks castles in large numbers to control their newly occupied territories in England and the Welsh Marches. During the 12th century the Normans began to build more castles in stone– with characteristic square keeps– that played both military and political roles. Royal castles were used to control key towns and the economically important forests, while baronial castles were used by <b>the</b> <b>Norman</b> lords to control their widespread estates. David I invited Anglo-Norman lords into Scotland in the early 12th century to help him colonise and control areas of his kingdom such as Galloway; the new lords brought castle technologies with them and wooden castles began to be established over the south of the kingdom. Following <b>the</b> <b>Norman</b> invasion of Ireland in the 1170s, under Henry II, castles were established there too.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Normans</b> have Norse mythology {{in their}} Viking heritage, however, they {{were known to}} readily {{assimilate}} into other cultures. After a generation or two, <b>the</b> <b>Normans</b> were generally indistinguishable from their French neighbours.|$|R
5|$|During {{the late}} 11th century, <b>the</b> <b>Norman</b> lord, Robert Fitzhamon entered Morgannwg {{in an attempt}} to gain control of the area, {{building}} many earth and timber castles in the lowlands. In the early 12th century <b>the</b> <b>Norman</b> expansion continued with castles being founded around Neath, Kenfig and Coity, while within the same period Bishop Urban established the Diocese of Llandaff under which Glynrhondda belonged to the large parish of Llantrisant.|$|E

5|$|In {{the period}} before <b>the</b> <b>Norman</b> Conquest, Somerset {{came under the}} control of Godwin, Earl of Wessex, and his family. There seems to have been some Danish {{settlement}} at Thurloxton and Spaxton, judging from the place-names. After <b>the</b> <b>Norman</b> Conquest, the county was divided into 700 fiefs, and large areas were owned by the crown, with fortifications such as Dunster Castle used for control and defence.|$|E

5000|$|To begin with, Leo {{moved to}} Apulia, {{and reached the}} Fortore River {{near the city of}} Civitate (or Civitella, {{northwest}} of Foggia). <b>The</b> <b>Normans</b> went forth to intercept the Papal army near Civitella and prevent its union with the Byzantine army, led by Argyrus. <b>The</b> <b>Normans</b> were short on supplies because of the harvest season, and had fewer men than their enemies, with no more than 3,000 horsemen and 500 infantry against 6,000 horsemen and infantry. Both Amatus' account and William of Apulia agree that <b>the</b> <b>Normans</b> were suffering from hunger and lack of nutrition, and both also add that <b>the</b> <b>Normans</b> forces were in fact so lacking that they, [...] "by the example of the Apostles took the heads of grain, rubbed them in their hands, and ate the kernels," [...] some may have cooked them over the fire beforehand as well. [...] Because of this, <b>the</b> <b>Normans</b> were driven to ask for a truce, but were refused, though there is some disagreement on who the greater enemies of <b>the</b> <b>Normans</b> were in refusing the negotiations, varying between the Lombards, the Germans, and the curia of Pope Leo himself, whom <b>the</b> <b>Normans</b> in fact wish to swear their fidelitas.|$|R
5000|$|A {{number of}} wars between <b>the</b> <b>Normans</b> and <b>the</b> Eastern Roman Empire were fought from [...] 1040 until 1185 when <b>the</b> last <b>Norman</b> {{invasion}} of East Roman territory was defeated. At {{the end of}} the conflict, neither <b>the</b> <b>Normans</b> nor <b>the</b> Byzantines could boast much power; by the mid-13th century exhaustive fighting with other powers had undermined the rule of both, leading to the Byzantines losing Asia Minor to the Turks in the 14th century, and <b>the</b> <b>Normans</b> losing Sicily to the Hohenstaufen, who in turn were succeeded by the Angevins and finally the Aragonese.|$|R
5|$|Like all French draft breeds, <b>the</b> <b>Norman</b> Cob was {{threatened}} by the advent of mechanization in farming. The only option left to many breeders was to redirect their production to the meat markets. However, <b>the</b> <b>Norman</b> Cob avoided this, {{through the efforts of}} Laurens St. Martin, the head of the Saint-Lo stud in 1944 and the developer of the Selle Francais. He began crossing Thoroughbred stallions with Norman Cob mares to produce Selle Francais horses, and the success of this program allowed a reorientation of the Cob breeding programs. Although population numbers continued to decline until 1995, the physical characteristics of the breed remained much the same, not growing heavier and slower as many of the French draft breeds did due to breeding for the production of meat. Even today, some Selle Francais from Norman bloodlines are similar to <b>the</b> <b>Norman</b> Cob in appearance.|$|E
5|$|Monmouth was a {{significant}} settlement in Roman Britain, as the border fort of Blestium and as an important centre for ironworking. It is possible the Romans bridged the River Wye during their occupation, but the Monnow appears not {{to have had a}} crossing until after <b>the</b> <b>Norman</b> invasion. <b>The</b> <b>Norman</b> lord William FitzOsbern built a castle near the confluence of the two rivers in around 1070. The following two centuries saw the establishment of the Benedictine Priory and the development of the town as a defensive location on the Welsh Marches.|$|E
5|$|Ralph {{inherited}} the ancestral lands in Normandy. <b>The</b> <b>Norman</b> chronicler Orderic Vitalis wrote that Basset built a tower on his ancestral lands of Montreuil in Normandy purely {{to demonstrate his}} status and wealth.|$|E
5000|$|Ten years later, <b>the</b> <b>Normans</b> went up <b>the</b> Loire again, {{and this}} time burned the city. For over a hundred years, they held the area and {{continued}} to devastate the country. They were such a formidable scourge that the Nantes Church had added to their litany ..." [...] the fury of <b>the</b> <b>Normans,</b> deliver us, O Lord...." [...] It was not until 939AD that Alain Barbe-Torte definitely drove <b>the</b> <b>Normans</b> from <b>the</b> country and brought peace.|$|R
50|$|Another {{version of}} the story tells of a French family, the de Frainets, who removed Nicholas' remains from Myra to Bari, Italy, in 1169 when Bari was under <b>the</b> <b>Normans.</b> <b>The</b> de Frainets were crusaders to the Holy Land and also owned land in Thomastown, Ireland. After <b>the</b> <b>Normans</b> were forced out of Bari, the de Frainets moved to Nice, France, taking the relics with them. When <b>the</b> <b>Normans</b> lost power in France, Nicholas de Frainet moved to Ireland. This story has the relics being buried in Jerpoint in 1200.|$|R
50|$|Only a {{few days}} after <b>the</b> <b>Normans</b> had {{captured}} Anglesey from the Welsh, Magnus Barefoot appeared with some ships off the coast. Fighting soon began with arrows shot between the Norwegian ships and <b>Norman</b> forces on <b>the</b> shore, but as Hugh of Montgomery was hit with an arrow and killed, <b>the</b> <b>Normans</b> retreated back to England.

5000|$|In ca. 1148, the {{political}} situation in the Balkans was divided by two sides, one being the alliance of the Byzantines and Venice, <b>the</b> other <b>the</b> <b>Normans</b> and Hungarians. <b>The</b> <b>Normans</b> were sure of the danger that the battlefield would move from the Balkans to their area in Italy.
