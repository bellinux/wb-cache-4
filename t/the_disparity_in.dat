40|$|<b>Disparities</b> <b>in</b> health {{exist between}} the three main {{population}} groups in Israel, non-immigrant Jews, immigrants from the former Soviet Union (arriving in Israel since 1990) and Arabs. This study examines the relationship between health and socioeconomic status in this multicultural population and assesses to what extent subjective and objective socioeconomic measures may explain <b>the</b> <b>disparities</b> <b>in</b> health. AÂ random cross sectional telephone survey of 1004 Israelis aged 35 - 65 was performed. The questionnaire measured physical and mental health-related quality of life using the Short Form 12. Information regarding subjective socioeconomic status (SSS) and objective socioeconomic status (SES) was collected. Arabs and immigrant women from the former Soviet Union had worse physical health compared to non-immigrant Jews. Immigrant and Arab men and women had worse mental health compared to non-immigrant Jews. Multivariable log-linear regression analysis adjusting for age, SSS or SES explained <b>the</b> <b>disparities</b> <b>in</b> physical health between Arab and non-immigrant Jewish men. However, SSS and SES did not explain <b>the</b> <b>disparities</b> <b>in</b> physical health between the three groups of women. <b>The</b> <b>disparities</b> <b>in</b> mental health between immigrants and non-immigrant Jews {{can be explained by}} SSS for both men and women, whereas <b>the</b> <b>disparities</b> between Arabs and Jews can be explained by objective SES only among women. Employed men reported better physical and mental health. Part of <b>the</b> <b>disparities</b> <b>in</b> mental health in Israel can be attributed to differences in SSS and SES in the different groups. However, {{there is a need to}} identify additional factors that may add to <b>the</b> <b>disparities</b> <b>in</b> both physical and mental health. <b>The</b> <b>disparities</b> due to socioeconomic status vary by health measure and population group.

40|$|Drawing on data {{contained}} in the 2005 EU-SILC, this paper investigates <b>the</b> <b>disparities</b> <b>in</b> educational opportunities in Italy and Spain. Its main objective is to analyse the predicted probabilities of successfully completing upper-secondary and tertiary education for individuals with different parental backgrounds, and the changes in these probabilities across birth cohorts extending from 1940 to 1980. The results suggest that <b>the</b> <b>disparities</b> <b>in</b> tertiary education opportunities in Italy tend to increase over time. By contrast, the gap in educational opportunity in Spain shows a marked decrease across the cohorts. Moreover, by using an intuitive decomposition strategy, the paper shows that {{a large part of}} the educational gap between individuals of different backgrounds is “composed” of the difference in the endowment of family characteristics. Specifically, it seems that more highly educated parents are more able to endow their children with a better composition of family characteristics, which accounts for a significant proportion of <b>the</b> <b>disparities</b> <b>in</b> educational opportunity.

40|$|One major {{critique}} of the Chinese economic reform focuses on <b>disparities</b> <b>in</b> development. This study examines the recent trends <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>disparities</b> <b>in</b> health and health care resources across the provinces. This study also examines the relationship between health status, health care resources, and socioeconomic status. A panel data from “All China Data ” and China Health Statistic Yearbooks is used in this study. These data include health status, health care resources, and socioeconomic status variables at the provincial level from 1980 to 2003. Index of disparity {{was used as the}} indicator for measuring regional <b>disparity</b> <b>in</b> health and health care resources. A fixed effect model was used to estimate the relationships between health status and health care resources and their potential determinants. The results of this study show that <b>the</b> <b>disparities</b> <b>in</b> maternal mortality, number of beds, and number of doctors increased and then declined in most recent years. However, the values of their indexes of <b>disparity</b> <b>in</b> 2002 are still higher than their values <b>in</b> 1985.

5|$|In {{addition}} to <b>the</b> <b>disparity</b> <b>in</b> population, {{there was also}} a great disparity between the fighting capabilities of the armed forces of the two countries. In 1977, Vietnam was estimated to have 615,000 soldiers and 900 tanks, supported by a 12,000-member air force with 300 combat aircraft, including one squadron of light bombers. In comparison, Kampuchea had an army of 70,000, only a few heavy tanks, 200 armoured vehicles, and limited air capability. Despite facing such heavy odds, Kampuchea showed no signs of hesitation as its military continued to assault Vietnam’s border regions. In January 1978, Kampuchean forces still held portions of Vietnamese territory and began overrunning Vietnamese outposts in Hà Tiên Province. On 27 January 1978, Vietnam started calling on the Kampuchean military along the border regions to overthrow the Khmer Rouge regime.|$|E

5|$|For {{stationary}} shots where Superman is seen flying toward or {{away from}} the camera, blue screen matte techniques were used. Reeve would be photographed suspended against a blue screen. While a special device made his cape flap to give the illusion of movement, the actor himself would remain stationary (save for banking his body). Instead, the camera would use a mixture of long zoom-ins and zoom-outs and dolly in/dolly outs to cause him to become larger or smaller in the frame. The blue background would then be photochemically removed and Reeve's isolated image would be 'inserted' into a matted area of a background plate shot. The zoom-ins or zoom-outs would {{give the appearance of}} flying away or toward the contents of the background plate. <b>The</b> <b>disparity</b> <b>in</b> lighting and color between the matted image and the background plate, the occasional presence of black matte lines (where the matte area and the matted image—in this case, Superman—do not exactly match up), and the slightly unconvincing impression of movement achieved through the use of zoom lenses is characteristic of these shots.|$|E
40|$|The {{study is}} focused on <b>the</b> <b>disparities</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{development}} of Bulgarian municipalities in the contest of the problem “center - periphery”. <b>The</b> municipal <b>disparities</b> <b>in</b> employment and unemployment are also subject of this study. One of the specific evidences of <b>the</b> municipal <b>disparities</b> is <b>the</b> problem “center - periphery”. The author tries {{to answer the following}} questions: • what is the methodological background of the problem “center - periphery” in the development of municipalities? • which are the roots for the existence of the central and remote (outskirts) territories”? • what are the features and the aspects of the problem “center - periphery” during the transition towards market economy? • what policies should be applied to alleviate the problem “center - periphery” as one of the acute issues {{in the development of the}} municipalities? A special indicator called “Municipality with economic active and employed population” is designed to asses the level of utilization of the human capital. The economic background for <b>the</b> <b>disparities</b> <b>in</b> employment and unemployment levels are analyzed. The main conclusion is that <b>the</b> large <b>disparities</b> <b>in</b> employment and unemployment can be explained by the different level of development of the economy sectors in the municipalities.

5|$|Northumbria's {{southern}} neighbour Mercia was, {{under the}} rule of kings Æthelbald, Offa and Coenwulf, the dominant kingdom in Anglo-Saxon England. Offa, the greatest of the three, ruled Mercia until 796, followed soon after by Coenwulf. Offa's dominance was secured in part by marriage alliances with the other major kingdoms: Beorhtric of Wessex and Æthelred of Northumbria were married to his daughters. Further afield, Charlemagne, the pre-eminent ruler in the Christian West, appears to have taken an active interest in Northumbrian affairs. Charlemagne initially ruled Francia and parts of Italy, but by 796 had become master of an empire which stretched from the Atlantic Ocean to the Great Hungarian Plain. He was a staunch defender of the Papacy, and in the popes and the church hierarchy he had allies whose influence extended to Northumbria and beyond. Events in southern Britain to 796 have sometimes been portrayed as a struggle between Offa and Charlemagne, but <b>the</b> <b>disparity</b> <b>in</b> their power was enormous, and Offa and then Coenwulf were clearly minor figures by comparison.|$|E
5|$|Part of <b>the</b> <b>disparity</b> <b>in</b> genus sizes is {{attributable}} to historical factors. According to a hypothesis published by Max Walters in 1961, the size of plant genera {{is related to the}} age, not of the taxon itself, but of the concept of the taxon in the minds of taxonomists. Plants which grew in Europe, where most of the early taxonomy was based, were therefore divided into relatively small genera, while those from the tropics were grouped into much larger and more heterogeneous genera. Likewise, plants which shared common medicinal properties, such as the many species of Euphorbia, were united into a single genus, while plants of diverse uses, such as the grasses, were split into many genera. Where there were many classical names for groups of plants, such as in Apiaceae / Umbelliferae or Brassicaceae / Cruciferae, small genera were defined, whereas groups not subdivided by classical authors remained as larger genera, such as Carex. A number of biological factors also influence the number of species. For instance, the occurrence of apomixis allows the recognition of large numbers of agamospecies, and such taxa have helped to bolster genera such as Ranunculus and Potentilla.|$|E
5|$|Finishing {{the regular}} season as the seventh seed, Washington was matched up with the {{defending}} champion Boston Bruins. As Tomas Vokoun and Michal Neuvirth were still injured, the Capitals were forced to start Braden Holtby in Game 1. Through the first two periods, Boston was {{in control of the}} game, out-shooting Washington 26–7. Despite <b>the</b> <b>disparity</b> <b>in</b> shots, the game remained tied 0–0 after regulation. Washington lost the game shortly into overtime. They rebounded to tie the series when Nicklas Backstrom scored in double overtime of game two. Through the first two games of the series, Holtby stopped 72 of 74 Bruins' shots. In Game 3, the two teams again looked to be heading to overtime tied 3–3 late in the third when Backstrom took a penalty. Zdeno Chara scored on the man advantage with under two minutes remaining, giving Boston the win. After the game ended, Backstrom was given a match penalty for intent to injure following a cross-check to Rich Peverley. Backstrom received a one-game suspension for his actions. Without Backstrom in Game 4, the Capitals evened the series with a 2–1 victory that featured a 44-save performance from Holtby. The Capitals took their first lead in the series thanks to a Troy Brouwer power-play goal with 1:27 left in regulation of game five. Facing elimination, Boston did not trail throughout Game 6 and was in position to win late in the third. However, an Alexander Ovechkin goal led to overtime, were Tyler Seguin scored to force a seventh and deciding game. Game 7 went to overtime, where a dump-in attempt was blocked by Mike Knuble, giving him a breakaway. He took a backhand that was stopped by Boston's Tim Thomas. Joel Ward followed the play and scored the game-winning goal on the rebound. With Washington's victory in the series, Holtby became just the third rookie goaltender in NHL history to defeat the reigning Stanley Cup champions. It was also the first playoff series in NHL history which all seven games were decided by one goal.|$|E

Tonelli then swam his leg in 54.94s, almost two seconds faster than his previous best. He did so with an uneven arm technique due to <b>the</b> <b>disparity</b> <b>in</b> the strength of his arms. He began to lose ground in the last 50m and was a bodylength behind until a late surge brought him to within a metre of the lead by the end of his leg. Brooks then made a powerful, well-timed dive and surfaced almost even with his Soviet counterpart. At the halfway mark, he had drawn level and made a superior turn to take the lead. The Soviet freestyler Kopliakov pulled level at the 25m mark before Brooks again sprinted away to seal an Australian victory by 0.22s. He did not breathe in the last ten metres, and claimed to be laughing for the final five metres, confident that his opponent could not pass him. The Australian freestyler had finished his leg in 49.86s as he had vowed to his team mates. The time of 3m 45.70s sealed Australia's first ever win in a medley relay at the Olympics, for men or women. Brooks dedicated the team's win to his mother, who had died from cancer the previous Christmas.

40|$|The mega-urban {{regions of}} Jabotabek (the Jakarta Extended Metropolitan Region) Bandung and Surabaya {{have been widely}} {{demonstrated}} {{to have some of}} the lowest child mortality rates (CMR) in Indonesia. However, <b>the</b> wide <b>disparities</b> <b>in</b> socioeconomic characteristics, living conditions and access to health services of the rapidly growing populations of these places leads to the assumption that CMR levels vary drastically as well. This paper, which contains the initial results of a PhD thesis, presents analysis of the spatial distribution of CMR in the sub-districts within Jabotabek, Bandung and Surabaya. The CMR are indirectly estimated by the Brass methods (Trussell equations) using the 2000 Indonesian Population Census, and the important limitations of this methodology and data source are analysed in depth.
