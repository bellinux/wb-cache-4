5|$|Following the {{introduction}} of rugby-style rules to American football, Camp became a fixture at the Massasoit House conventions where rules were debated and changed. Dissatisfied with what seemed to {{him to be a}} disorganized mob, he proposed his first rule change at the first meeting he attended in 1878: a reduction from fifteen players to eleven. The motion was rejected at that time but passed in 1880. The effect was to open up the game and emphasize speed over strength. Camp's most famous change, the establishment of the line of scrimmage and <b>the</b> <b>snap</b> from center to quarterback, was also passed in 1880. Originally, <b>the</b> <b>snap</b> was executed with the foot of the center. Later changes made it possible to snap the ball with the hands, either through the air or by a direct hand-to-hand pass.|$|E

5|$|The main backfield {{positions}} are the quarterback (QB), halfback/tailback (HB/TB) and fullback (FB). The quarterback {{is the leader}} of the offense. Either he or a coach calls the plays. Quarterbacks typically inform the rest of the offense of the play in the huddle before the team lines up. The quarterback lines up behind the center to take <b>the</b> <b>snap</b> and then hands the ball off, throws it or runs with it.|$|E
5|$|The umpire is {{positioned}} in the defensive backfield, {{except in the}} NFL, where he {{is positioned}} lateral to the referee {{on the opposite side}} of the formation. He watches play along the line of scrimmage to make sure that no more than 11 offensive players are on the field prior to <b>the</b> <b>snap</b> and that no offensive linemen are illegally downfield on pass plays. He monitors the contact between offensive and defensive linemen and calls most of the holding penalties. The umpire records the number of timeouts taken and the winner of the coin toss and the game score, assists the referee in situations involving possession of the ball close to the line of scrimmage, determines whether player equipment is legal, and dries wet balls prior to <b>the</b> <b>snap</b> if a game is played in rain.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the next}} two seasons, Jones {{developed}} into a star flanker, a position he helped invent. He was both a running threat and a receiver – his tall stature was well-suited to receiving – and helped complement a passing attack that featured the Browns' two main ends, Dante Lavelli and Mac Speedie. Jones often went in motion behind {{the line of scrimmage}} before <b>the</b> <b>snap</b> at a time when few players did so, causing confusion and mismatches on defense. He had 312 rushing yards and 241 receiving yards in 1949, when the Browns won another AAFC championship.|$|E
5|$|The {{offensive}} team must {{line up in}} a legal formation {{before they}} can snap the ball. An offensive formation is considered illegal if {{there are more than}} four players in the backfield or fewer than five players numbered 50–79 on the offensive line. Players can temporarily line up in a position whose eligibility is different from what their number permits as long as they immediately report the change to the referee, who then informs the defensive team of the change. Neither team's players, {{with the exception of the}} snapper, are allowed to line up in or cross the neutral zone until the ball is snapped. Interior offensive linemen are not allowed to move until <b>the</b> <b>snap</b> of the ball.|$|E

5|$|After a short return, Georgia QB Stafford {{went to work}} on the Georgia 24-yard line. Two {{incomplete}} {{passes and}} one sack later, Georgia was again punting. Virginia Tech again was in excellent field position, starting on their own 47-yard line. Instead of rushing the ball, as had been the trend for the Tech offense up to that point, Virginia Tech head coach Frank Beamer called for a trick play. At <b>the</b> <b>snap,</b> quarterback Sean Glennon lateraled the football to wide receiver Eddie Royal. Rather than running the ball, Royal threw the ball downfield, catching the Georgia defense off guard. Tight end Sam Wheeler, the target of the throw, had been left uncovered by a defense expecting a run. The pass was completed, and Wheeler ran unimpeded 53yards for a touchdown. The play took 19seconds to execute, and gave Virginia Tech a 21–3 lead with 4:00 remaining in the half.|$|E
5|$|After {{the failed}} trick play, the Hokies' offense started at their 44-yard line. The first Tech {{play of the}} drive was a 15-yard pass from DeShazo to Still for a first down. A three-yard run by Thomas was {{followed}} by a seven-yard reverse by Still for another first down at the Tennessee 29-yard line. On first down, Thomas pushed the Hokies eight yards forward with a run up the middle. This was followed by two incomplete passes, bringing up fourth down. Again, Tech head coach Frank Beamer elected to try to convert the fourth down rather than kick a field goal. Unlike Tech's previous fourth down, however, the try was unsuccessful after DeShazo mishandled <b>the</b> <b>snap</b> and was tackled for a loss. Virginia Tech turned the ball over on downs, and Tennessee's offense returned to the game with 1:31 remaining in the quarter.|$|E
5|$|After three {{consecutive}} victories {{to start the}} season, the Crimson Tide opened conference play against the Arkansas Razorbacks, and defeated them 38–14 at Bryant–Denny Stadium.

Alabama quarterback AJ McCarron received <b>the</b> <b>snap</b> as the holder, and proceeded to throw a 37-yard touchdown pass to Michael Williams to give the Crimson Tide a 7–0 lead. The Razorbacks tied the game at 7–7 {{late in the first}} quarter when Tyler Wilson threw a ten-yard touchdown pass to Dennis Johnson. After an Arkansas goal line stand, Jeremy Shelley connected on a 20-yard field goal to give Alabama a 10–7 lead. On the ensuing Arkansas possession, the Crimson Tide scored when DeQuan Menzie intercepted a Wilson pass and returned it 25-yards for a touchdown to give Alabama a 17–7 lead at the half.|$|E

Snaps price sometimes have up and down, does it run simultaneously or not in the Merjosari and Oro-oro Dowo Market which is a traditional market? Uncertain price fluctuatuions in snaps commodity based on that traditional market information became a phenomenon that is quite interesting to study in Merjosari and Oro-oro Doro Market. Therefore, the researcher is interesting to this study, thus making the researcher conducts the thesis which entitled “Horizontal Market Integration of Snaps Commodity (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) Between Merjosari and Oro-oro Dowo Market. ” Based on that background, the problems {{that need to be}} studied in the research is about the horizontal market integration of snaps commodity (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) between Merjosari and Oro-oro Dowo Market are: 1. Mow can the price fluctuation happened to snaps commodity (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) in Merjosari and Oro-oro Dowo Market? 2. How is the price mechanism to market level that is same between Merjosari and Oro-oro Dowo Market, does it run simultaneously or not? Due to the core problem so that the goals of research are: 1. To know the price fluctuation that happaned to <b>the</b> <b>snaps</b> commodity (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) in Merjosari and Oro-oro Dowo Market. 2. To know about the simultaneity price of snaps commodity (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) in Merjosari and Oro-oro Dowo Market. The research is done deliberately in Merjosari and Oro-oro Dowo Market. Sampling was done with Accidental Sampling, that is by asking directly to <b>the</b> <b>snaps</b> merchants that have been randomly selected with a fixed respondents, there were 12 respondents for each Market in Merjosari and Oro-oro Dowo Market for 15 days once in a day.

5|$|At {{the start}} of conference play, the Bearcats were 4–1, and their only loss was against top-five {{opponent}} Oklahoma. With Pike still injured, Cincinnati beat Rutgers, 13–10, in the Bearcats' first Big East game of the season. The Bearcats suffered their second defeat {{of the season in}} the following week, however, losing to the UConn Huskies, 40–16. Pike returned from the injury and had the Bearcats leading at halftime, but he left the game at the half when numbness in his non-throwing hand prevented him from being able to take <b>the</b> <b>snap.</b> In the two weeks that followed the loss to the Huskies, Cincinnati recovered to beat two top-25 opponents: No. 23 South Florida and No. 20 West Virginia. The two victories pushed the Bearcats to a 3–1 conference record and the No. 22 position in the AP Poll before Cincinnati's annual rivalry game against Louisville. That game, also known as the Battle for The Keg of Nails, ended in a Cincinnati victory {{for the first time since}} 2002.|$|E

Following some anti-Semitic comments made by Le Pen and the FN newspaper National Hebdo in the late 1980s, some valuable FN politicians left the party. Other quarrels soon also left the party without its remaining member of the National Assembly. In November 1988, general secretary Jean-Pierre Stirbois, who, together with his wife Marie-France, had been instrumental in the FN's early electoral successes, died in a car accident, leaving Bruno Mégret as the unrivalled de facto FN deputy leader. The FN only got 5% in the 1988 cantonal elections, while the RPR announced it would reject any alliance with the FN, now including at local level.

5|$|There are {{two main}} ways that the offense can advance the ball: running and passing. In a typical play, the quarterback calls the play, and the center passes the ball {{backwards}} and under his legs to the quarterback in {{a process known as}} <b>the</b> <b>snap.</b> The quarterback then either hands the ball off to a back, throws the ball or runs with it himself. The play ends when the player with the ball is tackled or goes out of bounds, or a pass hits the ground without a player having caught it. A forward pass can only be legally attempted if the passer is behind the line of scrimmage. In the NFL, a down also ends if the runner's helmet comes off.|$|E
