50|$|<b>Thyroid</b> <b>scintigraphy,</b> {{in which}} the thyroid is imaged {{with the aid of}} {{radioactive}} iodine (usually iodine-123, which does not harm thyroid cells, or rarely, iodine-131), is performed in the nuclear medicine department of a hospital or clinic. Radioiodine collects in the thyroid gland before being excreted in the urine. While in the thyroid, the radioactive emissions can be detected by a camera, producing a rough image of the shape (a radioiodine scan) and tissue activity (a radioiodine uptake) of the thyroid gland.|$|E
50|$|<b>Thyroid</b> <b>scintigraphy</b> is {{a useful}} test to {{characterize}} (distinguish between causes of) hyperthyroidism, and this entity from thyroiditis. This test procedure typically involves two tests performed in connection with each other: an iodine uptake test and a scan (imaging) with a gamma camera. The uptake test involves administering a dose of radioactive iodine (radioiodine), traditionally iodine-131 (131I), and more recently iodine-123 (123I). Iodine-123 may be the preferred radionuclide in some clinics due to its more favorable radiation dosimetry (i.e. less radiation dose to the patient per unit administered radioactivity) and a gamma photon energy more amenable to imaging with the gamma camera. For the imaging scan, I-123 is considered an almost ideal isotope of iodine for imaging thyroid tissue and thyroid cancer metastasis.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: To assess scintigraphic pattern, {{clinical}} indication {{and relevance}} of dual ectopic thyroid tissue (ETT). Literature is reviewed for such cases. METHODS: In this 5 -year retrospective study, we reviewed all <b>thyroid</b> <b>scintigraphies</b> in our data base. Patients diagnosed with suspected ETT were identified. Literature is reviewed. Statistics were done by {{one-way analysis of}} variance and least significant difference test. RESULTS: From 11905 <b>thyroid</b> <b>scintigraphies</b> during the 5 -year period, we retrieved 121 patients eligible for analysis. The top two indications were assessing a palpable front neck mass to determine whether it was an ETT, and primary hypothyroidism. Patients were divided into 3 groups. Group 1 with single ETT (83 cases); group 2 with dual ETT (6 cases) and group 3 with athyroid (32 cases). Age and thyroid hormones were highest in group 2, and lowest in group 3. Thyrotropin was highest in group 3, and lowest in group 2. Thyroxine was given to hypothyroid patients, while no surgery was performed. There were 42 published cases with dual ETT, most of whom were under 30 years old. 38. 10 % of them were euthyroid, 33. 33 % hypothyroid, and 21. 43 % subclinical hypothyroid. Most frequent ectopic positions included lingual (33. 73 %), sublingual (27. 71 %) and subhyoid (22. 89 %). CONCLUSIONS: In our cohort, incidence of dual ETT was 0. 05 % if the denominator was total number of <b>thyroid</b> <b>scintigraphies.</b> The incidence was 4. 96 % if the denominator was the number of patients with suspected ETT. Important clinical indication is a front neck palpable mass suggestive of an ETT. Important clinical relevance of recognizing the dual ETT pattern is to avoid inappropriate surgery. After reviewing all published cases, we find dual ETT is often seen in young patients. Most of such patients are euthyroid or mildly hypothyroid.

40|$|International audienceThyroid {{scintigraphy}} holds a key {{place in}} the etiologic workup of neonatal hypothyroidism. Routine screening for this disorder in maternity hospitals in industrialized countries, for nearly 40 years, has permitted early treatment and thereby helped to prevent its physical and mental complications. Neonatal hypothyroidism affects approximately 1 in 3000 births. The most common causes are abnormal thyroid gland development and defective hormone synthesis by an eutopic thyroid gland. The incidence of the latter has risen in recent years, for reasons that remain unclear. A thorough etiologic workup helps to determine the disease type. Current guidelines recommend thyroid imaging by means of ultrasound and scintigraphy. Ultrasound should be done by a practitioner trained to examine the cervical region of newborns, as the thyroid is very small and must be distinguished from the particular aspect of the “thyroid empty lodge. ” Ultrasound lacks sensitivity for detecting small ectopic glands but is {{the gold standard for}} measuring <b>thyroid</b> dimensions. <b>Scintigraphy</b> provides an etiologic diagnosis in most cases. The two isotopes used in this setting are technetium- 99 m and iodine- 123. The latter isotope gives more contrast and allows the perchlorate discharge test to be performed to detect abnormal iodide organification in the neonate with an eutopic <b>thyroid.</b> If <b>scintigraphy</b> cannot be performed during the neonatal period, a postponed procedure can be achieved after 3 years of age. Close cooperation between the nuclear medicine physician and the pediatric endocrinologist is crucial for timely and optimized scintigraphy...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Mass-screening for {{congenital}} hypothyroidism has identified cases of mild hypothyroidism, transient hypothyroidism, and transient hyperthyrotropinemia {{as well as}} typical hypothyroidism. In this paper, we examine the clinical data of the cases found positive in the screening test at our hospital. From 1989 to 1999 there were 72 patients with positive screening tests who started levothyroxine sodium (l-T 4; Thyradin-S) as supplement therapy. At the age of 3 to 4 yr the patients were re-evaluated to determine whether treatment should be continued. <b>Thyroid</b> <b>scintigraphies</b> were done at the same time. We divided these cases into 4 groups. Those in group 1 A started l-T 4 in early infancy without a TRH test because of obvious clinical evidence of hypothyroidism, and treatment was continued after re-evaluation (n= 37). Those in group 1 B also started treatment in early infancy without a TRH test, but treatment was discontinued after re-evaluation (n= 20). Patients in group 2 A started l-T 4 after evaluation by a TRH test and treatment was continued after re-evaluation (n= 14), while those in group 2 B started treatment after a TRH test, but after re-evaluation, treatment was discontinued (n= 1). In group 2 A, only a low dose of l-T 4 was needed, and a slightly elevated TSH and slightly decreased free T 4 (FT 4) were observed after the drug washout period. However, these patients had an exaggerated response to the TRH test at re-evaluation. These findings indicate that this group, forming not {{a small part of}} whole screening-positive subjects, had mild hypothyroidism. Such patients require careful follow-up and repeated evaluation to determine whether treatment should be continued.

40|$|<b>Thyroid</b> <b>scintigraphy</b> was {{performed}} in 69 consecutive infants with permanent primary congenital hypothyroidism (CH) detected by systematic neonatal thyroid screening using a rectilinear scanner or a gamma camera 15 minutes after the intravenous injection of 250 microCi Tc- 99 m sodium pertechnetate, immediately after the infants were fed. Immobilization of the infant in a supine position with the neck in hyperextension was achieved by a vacuum cushion without any sedation. <b>Thyroid</b> <b>scintigraphy</b> showed thyroid ectopia in 43 of the 69 CH infants, thyroid agenesis in 19, and goiter in the last 7 infants, respectively.

Employing [3 H]iloprost, a chemically stable PGI 2 -analogue as a radioligand, saturation experiments for comparative binding studies have been attempted. Scatchard analysis of the binding data obtained for normal thyroid parenchyma distant to the nodule area revealed heterogeneity of the [3 H]iloprost sites exhibiting a high-affinity binding capacity (Bmax) of 613. 2 +/- 130. 4 fmol mg- 1 membrane protein and a low-affinity binding capacity of 5. 1 +/- 1. 6 pmol mg- 1 membrane protein. The equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) amounted to 18. 9 +/- 8. 9 nM and to 131. 5 +/- 39. 2 nM, respectively. Scatchard analysis of the binding data obtained for benign thyroid adenoma indicated significant lower binding capacities exhibiting a Bmax of 325. 8 +/- 110. 0 fmol mg- 1 membrane protein (Kd: 31. 0 +/- 7. 5 nM) for the high-affinity sites and of 3. 9 +/- 2. 5 pmol mg- 1 membrane protein (Kd: 364. 9 +/- 183. 6) for the low affinity sites.

40|$|Objective: To {{assess the}} value of <b>thyroid</b> <b>scintigraphy</b> to {{determine}} thyroid status in dogs with hypothyroidism and various non-thyroidal illnesses. Methods: Thyroid hormone concentrations were measured and quantitative <b>thyroid</b> <b>scintigraphy</b> performed in 21 dogs with clinical and/or clinicopathological features consistent with hypothyroidism. Results: In 14 dogs with technetium thyroidal uptake values consistent with euthyroidism, further investigations supported non-thyroidal illness. In five dogs with technetium thyroidal uptake values within the hypothyroid range, primary hypothyroidism was confirmed as the only disease in four. The remaining dog had pituitary-dependent hyperadrenocorticism. Two dogs had technetium thyroidal uptake values in the non-diagnostic range. One dog had iodothyronine concentrations indicative of euthyroidism. In the other, a dog receiving glucocorticoid therapy, all iodothyronine concentrations were decreased. Markedly asymmetric technetium thyroidal uptake was present in two dogs. All iodothyronine concentrations were within reference interval but canine thyroid stimulating hormone concentration was elevated in one. Non-thyroidal illness was identified in both cases.

40|$|The {{clinical}} {{occurrence of}} ectopic thyroid gland is an infrequently encountered condition, {{resulting from a}} developmental abnormality during the migration of the thyroid anlage {{from the floor of}} the primitive foregut to its final position in the neck. It can be found along the way of thyroid descent, in the midline, or laterally in the neck or even in the mediastinum or under the diaphragm.

Ultrasonography showed a giant, {{heterogeneous}} mass occupying the middle and superior poles and protruding outside of the left thyroid lobe. The results of the thyroid function tests were normal. <b>Thyroid</b> <b>scintigraphy</b> revealed a large hypoactive nodule in the left thyroid lobe. Complete surgical removal of tumor was performed and macroscopically demonstrated a well-demarked lesion outside the thyroid gland. Microscopically, the lesion was composed of fibroblast-like spindle cells in a patternless architecture and extensive stromal hyalinization. Immunohistochemistry showed positive reaction for CD 34 in spindle cells and diffuse bcl- 2 staining. The pathology was confirmed as solitary fibrous tumor. In the follow-up period after surgery, <b>thyroid</b> <b>scintigraphy</b> showed normal left thyroid lobe. Solitary fibrous tumor originated from or associated with thyroid gland is extremely rare. According to our knowledge, {{this is the first}} reported solitary fibrous tumor presenting like a cold thyroid nodule. This pathology must be considered for differential diagnosis of neck masses in the thyroid region...|$|E
30|$|By using <b>thyroid</b> 99 mTc-MIBI <b>scintigraphy</b> {{data from}} 3 patients, we {{generated}} 9 TACs and 90 Monte Carlo TAC simulations using gamma distribution convolution (GDC) models. The GDC models fit the TAC data with high fidelity and small enough TAC noise-image misregistration (0.8 %) {{that they have}} a plausible use as simulations of thyroid activity for querying performance of other models, such as washout models, for altered ROI size, noise, administered dose and image framing rates. Monte Carlo accuracy testing results for all of the GDC model parameter values were good with a GDC MRT accuracy of 0.46 %, despite fitting only 90  min of data. Since the GDC model is an actual concentration model, it does not have to decay several half-lives in order to obtain model parameters or validate the methodology. The 4 washout-only models applied to the same data all exceeded 10 % precision error compared to the GDC, with the apparent excess error suspected to be from having insufficient temporal data for washout modelling.|$|R
40|$|Objective To {{search for}} genetic {{alteration}} in NKX 2. 5 gene in patients presenting both {{congenital heart disease}} (CHD) and TD. Subjects and methods Individual phenotypes were carefully analyzed in 86 children with thyroid dysgenesis (TD) using <b>thyroid</b> function tests, <b>scintigraphy,</b> ultrasound and echocardiography. DNA was extracted and NKX 2. 5 gene coding region was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequenced. Results CHD were found in 8. 1 % of patients with TD. The mutation screening revealed two known polymorphisms in patients with isolated TD or TD associated with CHD. None of them are predicted to result in codon change in conserved domain. The c. 63 A>G polymorphism was detected in 54 / 86 patients (49 with isolated TD and 5 with TD combined with CHD). There was a significant association of c. 63 A>G polymorphism with hypoplasia (p A polymorphism was observed in only one patient with isolated thyroid hypoplasia. Conclusion NKX 2. 5 mutations were not found. The c. 63 A>G polymorphism might be associated with thyroid hypoplasia...|$|R
40|$|Background and {{objectives}} The value {{and practice of}} thyroid radionuclide imaging in the diagnosis and management of hyperthyroidism is unsettled. Our objectives were to {{determine the influence of}} <b>thyroid</b> uptake and <b>scintigraphy</b> on the diagnosis of hyperthyroidism and the prediction of outcome following radioiodine therapy. Patients and design We reviewed records and scintigraphic studies on 881 hyperthyroid patients carried out between 2000 and 2007. The agreement between the clinical and scintigraphic diagnosis was evaluated by kappa statistics. We determined the relationship between 4 -h 123 I uptake and the outcome of 131 I treatment in 626 patients. A multiple logistic regression model was used to determine variables influencing treatment outcome in 1 year. Results The diagnostic categories were Graves’ disease (GD, n = 383), toxic multinodular goitre (n = 253), solitary toxic nodule (n = 164) and Graves’ disease coexisting with nodules (n = 81). The mean age of the patients was 58 ± 17, (M:F 160 : 721). There was good agreement between clinical and scintigraph diagnosis (K = 0 · 60, 95...|$|R
