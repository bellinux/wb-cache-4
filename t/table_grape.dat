5|$|Grapes {{are mostly}} grown for making wine and vinegar as basic {{components}} of the Mediterranean diet, as well for drying as raisins or for eating as table grapes. Raisins and <b>table</b> <b>grape</b> varieties are chosen for their flavour. Grape production remains important in the Mediterranean area, with Southern Europe accounting for 21% of the world's harvest. In 2014, Italy produced 6.9 million tonnes (mt) of grapes, Spain 6.2 mt, France 6.2 mt, Turkey 4.2 mt, and Germany 1.2 mt. Wine production for Southern Europe was 37% of the world total in 2014, with Italy producing 4.8 mt, Spain 4.6 mt, France 4.3 mt, and Germany 0.9 mt.|$|E
5|$|Thomcord grape is {{a hybrid}} of Thompson Seedless grape (Vitis vinifera, or Sultanina), which is popular in {{supermarkets}} during the summer, and seeded Concord grape (Vitis labrusca), commonly used to make grape juice and jelly. It is a plump, juicy, seedless <b>table</b> <b>grape</b> and is slightly firmer than Concord. Thomcord has a blue-black skin with medium thickness and a whitish bloom. Unlike Concord, whose tough skin separates easily from the fruit, Thomcord has a more edible skin that clings to the flesh, much like Thompson Seedless. It has an aromatic flavor, similar to the Concord in taste ("labrusca"), though lighter due to the sweet, mild taste from Thompson Seedless.|$|E

Locally, <b>table</b> <b>grapes</b> are packed manually using seasonal labour, who often have limited formal education. Punnets must conform to upper and lower mass limits, but many deviations occur due to human and machine error. Check-weighing proved effective in reducing out-of-specification punnets, but human and machine errors were still problem factors...|$|R

The goal of our project that has started in 2004 is to develop and establish a cultivation system for organic <b>table</b> <b>grapes</b> under Swiss climatic and economic conditions with a high yield security and fulfilling the high quality demands of the market. Preliminary results: Interesting cultivars to produce are e. g. Fanny, Lilla, Palatina. However they are disease susceptible and must be produced under a rain roof. Better suited cultivars {{still need to be}} found. Consumer acceptance for organic <b>table</b> <b>grapes</b> produced in Switzerland is very positive.

2500|$|Today ampelographers {{believe that}} Pedro Ximénez {{probably}} originated {{somewhere in the}} Andalusia region of southern Spain where the grape has been growing {{since at least the}} early 17th century. In 1618, the Spanish writer Vicente Espinel, described the famous wine of [...] "Pedro Ximénez de Malaga". In 2007, DNA analysis showed that Pedro Ximénez was the offspring of the Arabic <b>table</b> <b>grape</b> Gibi which was once grown in southern France and throughout the Iberian peninsula, possibly introduced sometime during the Al-Andalus period of Moorish rule. Gibi was also discovered {{to be one of the}} parent varieties of the Extremadura wine grape Alarije, making the later variety a half-sibling to Pedro Ximénez.|$|E

2500|$|Like most Muscat varieties, Muscat of Alexandria {{is notable}} {{for being a}} {{desirable}} raisin and <b>table</b> <b>grape.</b> This {{is due in part}} to the grape's high tolerance of heat and drought conditions. While it is used in wine production (most notably on the island of Pantelleria between Sicily and Tunisia, where it makes a passito style dessert wine under the name of [...] "Zibibbo"), the grape lags far behind the reputation of Muscat blanc à Petits Grains. This is partly because Muscat of Alexandria is very vigorous and prone to produce high yields that can be easily overcropped as well as a more assertive aroma profile due to a higher concentration of the monoterpene geraniol, which produces a geranium scent, and lower concentration of nerol which a more fresh, sweet rose aroma.|$|E
2500|$|Commercially {{cultivated}} grapes {{can usually}} be classified as either table or wine grapes, based on their intended method of consumption: eaten raw (table grapes) or used to make wine (wine grapes). While {{almost all of them}} belong to the same species, Vitis vinifera, table and wine grapes have significant differences, brought about through selective breeding. <b>Table</b> <b>grape</b> cultivars tend to have large, seedless fruit (see below) with relatively thin skin. Wine grapes are smaller, usually seeded, and have relatively thick skins (a desirable characteristic in winemaking, since much of the aroma in wine comes from the skin). Wine grapes also tend to be very sweet: they are harvested at the time when their juice is approximately 24% sugar by weight. By comparison, commercially produced [...] "100% grape juice", made from table grapes, is usually around 15% sugar by weight.|$|E

50|$|The {{international}} trade in <b>table</b> <b>grapes</b> has significantly benefitted from the increased availability of cold storage and refrigerated container technology. <b>Table</b> <b>grapes</b> are a labour-intensive agricultural product that require harvesting by hand at peak ripeness. In order to maintain product quality at point of sale, harvested grapes must be sorted, packaged and cooled to near 0 °C as quickly as possible. Transportation in ventilated and temperature controlled environments requires significant investment in processing facilities, shipping and logistics. As the production cycle for <b>table</b> <b>grapes</b> is relatively long compared with other fruit, with new plantations taking 2-3 years to become productive, export production and promotion is often concentrated {{in the hands of}} large vertically integrated commercial enterprises or producer-exporter associations such as the Fruit Exporters Association of Chile (ASOEX).|$|R
