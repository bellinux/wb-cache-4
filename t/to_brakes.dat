5|$|Internal forces, {{those between}} {{components}} of the bike and rider system, are mostly caused by the rider or by friction. In addition to pedaling, the rider can apply torques between the steering mechanism (front fork, handlebars, front wheel, etc.) and rear frame, and between the rider and the rear frame. Friction exists between any parts that move against each other: in the drive train, between the steering mechanism and the rear frame, etc. In addition <b>to</b> <b>brakes,</b> which create friction between rotating wheels and non-rotating frame parts, many bikes have front and rear suspensions. Some motorcycles and bicycles have a steering damper to dissipate undesirable kinetic energy, and some bicycles have a spring connecting the front fork to the frame to provide a progressive torque that tends to steer the bicycle straight ahead. On bikes with rear suspensions, feedback between the drive train and the suspension is an issue designers attempt to handle with various linkage configurations and dampers.|$|E
25|$|The {{system is}} fully regenerative, {{all of the}} engine's power reaches the track either through the main {{driveshaft}} or the steering system, none of the energy is being lost <b>to</b> <b>brakes</b> or clutches.

25|$|Essentially {{similar to}} the P-47B, the initial P-47C {{featured}} strengthened all-metal control surfaces, an upgraded GE turbosupercharger regulator, and a short vertical radio mast. After the initial manufacture of a block of 57 P-47Cs, production moved to the P-47C-1, which had an 8in (20cm) fuselage extension forward of the cockpit at the firewall to correct center of gravity problems, ease engine maintenance and allow installation of a new engine mount. There {{were a number of}} other changes, such as revised exhausts for the oil coolers, and fixes <b>to</b> <b>brakes,</b> undercarriage and electrical systems, as well as a redesigned rudder and elevator balance. The 55 P-47C-1s were followed by 128 P-47C-2s which introduced a centerline hardpoint with under-fuselage shackles for either a 500lb (227kg) bomb or a 200U.S. gal (758l, 167Imp gal) fuel tank that conformed to the underside of the fuselage. The main production P-47C sub-variant was the P-47C-5 which introduced a new whip antenna. With the use of pressurized drop tanks, the P-47C was able to extend its range on missions beginning 30 July 1943.|$|E

Most modern petrol vehicles cut off the fuel supply completely when coasting (over-running) in gear, although the moving engine adds considerable frictional drag and speed is lost more quickly than with the engine declutched from the drivetrain.|$|E
50|$|As {{darkness}} fell on {{the former}} Hendricks Army Airfield, the Lancias of Ascari and Villoresi, and Fangio and Castellotti had retired due <b>to</b> <b>brakes</b> and gearbox issues respectively, leaving {{the burden on the}} shoulders of Taruffi and Manzon. This D24, was still lapping swiftly on the now night-blackened circuit, at an average speed of 82 mph - more than seven mph faster than the 1953 record-breaking Cunningham C4R - albeit with only one headlight. As Taruffi and Manzon streaked out of sight, chief race steward, Alec Ulmann announced that the Lancia would be black-flagged if it continued to race with just one light. The team’s race director, Attilio Pasquarelli put out a red flag, and leaned far out onto the course to block the car’s path. When the car finally pitted, Manzon protested: “The car wouldn’t go any faster - oil pressure was off”. He thought the red flag was a pit signal that their lead was in danger.|$|E

Brake squeal noise is the most troublesome and irritant one to both car passenger and the environment, and is expensive <b>to</b> <b>brakes</b> and carmakers in terms of warranty costs. It is well accepted that brake squeal is due to a friction-induced dynamic instability and it frequently occurs at frequency above 1 kHz and is described as sound pressure level above 78 dB. Brake squeal has been studied over 20 years ago through experimental, analytical and numerical methods in an attempt to understand, to predict and to prevent squeal occurrence. In recent years, the finite element (FE) method has become the preferred method due to inadequacy of experimental methods in predicting squeal at early stage in the design process. However, the drawbacks of the FE method are over-predictions and missing unstable modes in the squeal frequency range. This paper attempts to improve the drawbacks by considering temperature dependent friction coefficient (T-µ dependency), which is typically neglected by many previous investigators. Prediction of disc brake squeal is performed using complex eigenvalue analysis that available in ABAQUS V 6. 4. In doing so, a validated and detailed 3 -D finite element model of a real disc brake is used.
