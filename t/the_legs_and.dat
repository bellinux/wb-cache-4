5|$|Many {{species of}} birdlice are {{present on the}} birds and in their nests, and mites of the genus Knemidocoptes {{have been known to}} infest populations, {{resulting}} in lesions on <b>the</b> <b>legs</b> <b>and</b> toes. Parasitisation of nestlings by Protocalliphora blow-fly larvae is a significant factor in nestling mortality. Egg size does not influence nestling mortality, but chicks from large eggs grow faster.|$|E

The case when <b>the</b> middle <b>leg</b> is located between <b>the</b> hind <b>leg</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> center of mass is also formed using six beams: specifically, <b>the</b> three <b>legs,</b> <b>the</b> connection between <b>the</b> hind <b>leg</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> middle <b>leg,</b> <b>the</b> connection between <b>the</b> middle <b>leg</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> center of mass and the connection between the center of mass <b>and</b> <b>the</b> front <b>leg.</b>|$|R

5|$|Only {{three classes}} of pigment (ommochromes, bilins and guanine) have been {{identified}} in spiders, although other pigments have been detected but not yet characterized. Melanins, carotenoids and pterins, very common in other animals, are apparently absent. In some species, the exocuticle of <b>the</b> <b>legs</b> <b>and</b> prosoma is modified by a tanning process, resulting in brown coloration.|$|E

5|$|The Australian Cattle Dog was {{developed}} {{for its ability to}} encourage reluctant cattle to travel long distances and may be the best breed in the world for this work.

5|$|The overall {{appearance}} of the Saluki is one of grace and symmetry. Two coat types—smooth and feathered—are evident in the breed's gene pool. The latter variety has light feathering {{on the back of}} <b>the</b> <b>legs</b> <b>and</b> thighs. The fur on both types is silky and is low-shedding when compared to other breeds.|$|E
5|$|The text {{begins by}} stating {{the size of}} the bird.

Next, the origin and distribution of the species are discussed, with notes or quotations from authorities such as John Ray, Gilbert White and Buffon.|$|E
5|$|The thorax, which {{develops}} from segments 2, 3 and 4 of the larva, {{consists of}} three invisibly divided segments, namely prothorax, metathorax and mesothorax. The organs of insect locomotion – <b>the</b> <b>legs</b> <b>and</b> wings – are borne on the thorax. The forelegs spring from the prothorax, the forewings and middle pair of legs are borne on the mesothorax, and the hindwings and hindlegs arise from the metathorax. In some cases, the wings are vestigial.|$|E

5|$|A normal dog has {{a muscular}} {{appearance}} {{with a deep}} chest and strong legs. The French Spaniel has eyes of a dark amber colour, and a thick tail that tapers towards the tip. The hair is medium, dense, with long feathers on the ears, backs of <b>the</b> <b>legs</b> <b>and</b> tail. It has some waviness on the chest and otherwise lies flat on the body. The normal colour of a French Spaniel's coat is white with brown markings rather in shade from a light cinnamon to dark liver. Historically, the coat was only white with black markings, but the breed was mixed with other colours of Spaniels during the 19th century.|$|E
5|$|Although no {{subspecies}} are recognized, {{there are}} morphological differences in wood turtles between areas. Individuals {{found in the}} west of its geographic range (areas like the Great Lakes and the Midwest United States) have a paler complexion {{on the inside of}} <b>the</b> <b>legs</b> <b>and</b> underside of the neck than ones found in the east (places including the Appalachian Mountains, New York, and Pennsylvania). Genetic analysis has also revealed that southern populations have less genetic diversity than the northern; however, both exhibit a fair amount of diversity considering the decline in numbers that have occurred during previous ice ages.|$|E

5|$|Least weasels {{from various}} parts of its range vary greatly in size. The body is slender and {{elongated}} and <b>the</b> <b>legs</b> <b>and</b> tail are relatively short. The colour varies geographically, as does the pelage type and length of tail. The dorsal surface, flanks, limbs and tail of the animal are usually some shade of brown while the underparts are white. The line delineating {{the boundary between the}} two colours is usually straight. At high altitudes and {{in the northern part of}} its range, the coat becomes pure white in winter. Eighteen subspecies are recognised.|$|E
5|$|On July 29, 1967, McCain was a {{lieutenant}} commander {{when he was}} near {{the epicenter of the}} USS Forrestal fire. He escaped from his burning jet and was trying to help another pilot escape when a bomb exploded; McCain was struck in <b>the</b> <b>legs</b> <b>and</b> chest by fragments. The ensuing fire killed 134sailors and took 24hours to control. With the Forrestal out of commission, McCain volunteered for assignment with the , another aircraft carrier employed in Operation Rolling Thunder.

5|$|Spiders a {{class of}} arachnids have four pairs of legs; a body of two segments—a {{cephalothorax}} and an abdomen. Spiders have no wings and no antennae. They have mouthparts called chelicerae which are often connected to venom glands as most spiders are venomous. They have a second pair of appendages called pedipalps attached to the cephalothorax. These have similar segmentation to <b>the</b> <b>legs</b> <b>and</b> function as taste and smell organs. At {{the end of each}} male pedipalp is a spoon-shaped cymbium that acts to support the copulatory organ.|$|E

5|$|Taken together, the {{injuries}} {{appear to be}} a combination of battle wounds, which were the cause of death, followed by post-mortem humiliation wounds inflicted on the corpse. The body wounds show that the corpse had been stripped of its armour, as the stabbed torso would have been protected by a backplate and the pelvis would have been protected by armour. The wounds were made from behind on the back and buttocks while they were exposed to the elements, consistent with the contemporary descriptions of Richard's naked body being tied across a horse with <b>the</b> <b>legs</b> <b>and</b> arms dangling down on either side. There may have been further flesh wounds not apparent from the bones.|$|E
5|$|The {{effects of}} {{injuries}} {{at or above}} the lumbar or sacral regions of the spinal cord (lower back and pelvis) include decreased control of <b>the</b> <b>legs</b> <b>and</b> hips, genitourinary system, and anus. People injured below level L2 may still have use of their hip flexor and knee extensor muscles. Bowel and bladder function are regulated by the sacral region. It is common to experience sexual dysfunction after injury, as well as dysfunction of the bowel and bladder, including fecal and urinary incontinence. It is also possible for the bladder to fail to empty, leading to a potentially harmful buildup of urine. One sign of spinal cord injury that emergency providers may find is priapism, an erection of the penis.|$|E
