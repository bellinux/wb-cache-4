50|$|The {{number of}} <b>turbine</b> <b>stages</b> varies in {{different}} types of engines, with high-bypass-ratio engines tending {{to have the most}} <b>turbine</b> <b>stages.</b> The number of <b>turbine</b> <b>stages</b> can have a great effect on how the turbine blades are designed for each stage. Many gas turbine engines are twin-spool designs, meaning that there is a high-pressure spool and a low-pressure spool. Other gas turbines use three spools, adding an intermediate-pressure spool between the high- and low-pressure spool. The high-pressure turbine is exposed to the hottest, highest-pressure air, and the low-pressure turbine is subjected to cooler, lower-pressure air. The difference in conditions leads to the design of high-pressure and low-pressure turbine blades that are significantly different in material and cooling choices even though the aerodynamic and thermodynamic principles are the same.Under these severe operating conditions inside the gas and steam turbines, the blades face high temperature, high stresses, and potentially high vibrations. Steam turbine blades are critical components in power plants which convert the linear motion of high-temperature and high-pressure steam flowing down a pressure gradient into a rotary motion of the turbine shaft.|$|E

On the downstream side of the <b>turbine</b> <b>stage</b> a clear linear dependence of the generated entropy sound power from the squared values of the injected temperature fluctuation amplitudes is detected for the different operation conditions.

40|$|Noise {{originating}} {{from the core}} of an aero-engine is challenging to quantify since the understanding of its generation and propagation is less advanced than that for noise sources of other engine components. To overcome the difficulties associated with dynamic measurements in the crowded core region, dedicated experiments {{have been set up}} in order to investigate mainly two processes: the propagation of direct combustion noise through the subsequent <b>turbine</b> <b>stage,</b> and the generation of indirect combustion noise by the passage of inhomogeneities of entropy and vorticity through the <b>turbine</b> <b>stage.</b> In the current work, a transonic <b>turbine</b> <b>stage</b> was exposed to isolated and well-characterized acoustic, entropic, and vortical disturbances.

5000|$|Reaction {{turbines}} develop torque by {{reacting to}} the gas or fluid's pressure or mass. The pressure of the gas or fluid changes as it passes through the turbine rotor blades. A pressure casement is needed to contain the working fluid as it acts on the <b>turbine</b> <b>stage(s)</b> or the turbine must be fully immersed in the fluid flow (such as with wind turbines). The casing contains and directs the working fluid and, for water turbines, maintains the suction imparted by the draft tube. Francis turbines and most steam turbines use this concept. For compressible working fluids, multiple <b>turbine</b> <b>stages</b> are usually used to harness the expanding gas efficiently.
