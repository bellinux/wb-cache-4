5|$|In 1796, {{following}} the secret {{terms of the}} Treaty of San Ildefonso, the Kingdom of Spain suddenly reversed {{its position in the}} French Revolutionary Wars <b>turning</b> <b>from</b> an enemy of the French Republic into an ally. The Spanish declaration of war on Great Britain forced the British Mediterranean Fleet to abandon the Mediterranean Sea entirely, retreating to ports at Gibraltar and Lisbon. This force now concentrated against the Spanish Navy, most of which was stationed at the main fleet base of Cádiz in Southern Spain. A British blockade fleet won a significant victory over the Spanish at the Battle of Cape St Vincent in February 1797, dissuading the Spanish fleet from playing {{a significant role in the}} ongoing war.|$|E
5|$|Six years later, the Voyager {{missions}} {{vastly improved}} {{the understanding of}} the Galilean moons and discovered Jupiter's rings. They also confirmed that the Great Red Spot was anticyclonic. Comparison of images showed that the Red Spot had changed hue since the Pioneer missions, <b>turning</b> <b>from</b> orange to dark brown. A torus of ionized atoms was discovered along Io's orbital path, and volcanoes were found on the moon's surface, some in the process of erupting. As the spacecraft passed behind the planet, it observed flashes of lightning in the night side atmosphere.|$|E

25|$|Like most Daylamites at the time, the Buyids were Shia {{and have}} been called Twelvers. However, {{it is more likely}} that they began as Zaydis. As the reason of this <b>turning</b> <b>from</b> Zaydism to Twelverism, Moojen Momen {{suggests}} that since the Buyids were not descendants of Ali, the first Shi'i Imam, Zaydism would have urged them to install an Imam from Ali's family. For that reason Buyids tended toward Twelverism, which has an occulted Imam, which was more politically attractive to them.|$|E

Her painting style changed in 1947, <b>turning</b> <b>from</b> small landscapes and portraits into a bold, subjective abstraction when she began to make constructions from bits of wood and other materials that washed up on the beach near her home; most often her constructions reflected the area around her North Fork home, but sometimes the pieces reflected her travels to the Caribbean and abroad.|$|E
25|$|Tanker 910 {{experienced}} {{its first}} serious aviation incident on June 25, 2007.

It encountered sinking air, the left wing dropped, and the aircraft descended 100 to 200 feet lower than expected. The left wing struck several trees before pilots were able to power out of the descent. The aircraft climbed to altitude for a controllability check and to dump its load of retardant, then returned to its base in Victorville, where it made an emergency landing and was grounded pending an investigation, inspection, and repairs.|$|E

25|$|The cooling units {{could only}} {{work in a}} vacuum. Water from a tank in the {{backpack}} flowed out through tiny pores in a metal sublimator plate where it quickly vaporized into space. The loss of the heat of vaporization froze the remaining water, forming a layer of ice {{on the outside of}} the plate that also sublimated into space (<b>turning</b> <b>from</b> a solid directly into a gas). A separate water loop flowed through the LCG (Liquid Cooling Garment) worn by the astronaut, carrying his metabolic waste heat through the sublimator plate where it was cooled and returned to the LCG. Twelve pounds (5.4kg) of feedwater gave about eight hours of cooling; because of its bulk, it was often the limiting consumable on the length of an EVA.|$|E
25|$|Many {{books of}} the Nevi'im section of the Hebrew Bible such as the Book of Isaiah and Book of Jeremiah spoke out against those Israelites who brought forth sacrifices but did not act {{in accord with the}} precepts of the Law. The Prophets disparaged sacrifices that were offered without a {{regeneration}} of the heart, i.e., a determined <b>turning</b> <b>from</b> sin and returning to God by striving after righteousness (Book of Hosea 14:1-2, Joel 2:13, Micah 6:6-8). At the same time, prophets stressed the importance of offerings combined with justice and good even as they taught that offerings were unacceptable unless combined with heartfelt repentance and good deeds. Malachi, the last prophet in the Hebrew Bible, emphasized that the goal of repentance is not to end sacrifices, but to make the offerings fit for acceptance once again (Book of Malachi, 3:3-4). Similarly, the Book of Isaiah despite disparagement of sacrifices without justice, portrays sacrifice as having a role complementary with prayer in a universalistic eschatology (Isaiah 56:1; 6-7).|$|E

25|$|In 2008, Alberta {{completed}} a functional planning {{study to determine}} the best course of action for upgrades to the incomplete interchange of Glenmore Trail and Deerfoot Trail. The interchange carries 130,000 vehicles per day on Deerfoot Trail and 100,000 vehicles on Glenmore {{making it one of the}} busiest interchanges in Alberta, but there is no direct access for traffic <b>turning</b> <b>from</b> northbound Deerfoot to westbound Glenmore. Traffic must first exit to the east, proceed through a traffic light behind Calgary Auto Mall, and enter Glenmore Trail from the north side. Stage1 of the proposed improvements would not remedy this problem, but rather correct a pinch point on Deerfoot Trail by constructing a new three lane bridge to carry the northbound lanes over Glenmore. Ultimately, a large cloverstack interchange is planned with north-west and east-north flyovers to provide free-flowing access to and from Deerfoot Trail, but it will require acquisition of land from adjacent properties. The plans also call for widening of Glenmore Trail to as many as 10 lanes between Blackfoot and Deerfoot, modifications of the interchange at Blackfoot Trail, and braided ramps.|$|E

The highway expands to six lanes east of MD 414 and passes a Smithsonian Institution Libraries support center. MD 458 enters Suitland at its partial cloverleaf interchange with the Suitland Parkway. Just beyond the parkway, the highway passes the Suitland station on the Washington Metro's Green Line. MD 458 continues past the Suitland Federal Center, whose main tenant is the U.S. Census Bureau, and intersects Suitland Road, which heads northwest as MD 218 {{in the center of}} Suitland.
