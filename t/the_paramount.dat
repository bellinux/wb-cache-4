5|$|<b>The</b> <b>paramount</b> chief {{maintained}} some loyalty for his subjects. He {{persuaded the}} Germans {{to carry out}} infrastructure improvements such as the building of roads, schools, health clinics, and churches; and he defended his subjects from colonial reprisals. In one instance, an Ewondo interpreter fired a gun during a dispute with a German, an offence punishable with a stiff prison sentence. Atangana interceded, and the man's punishment was reduced to porter duty. However, <b>the</b> <b>paramount</b> chief remained completely loyal to the governors. In 1914, for example, representatives of Duala leader Rudolf Duala Manga Bell tried to secure Atangana's backing for a pan-Kamerun revolt. Atangana kept the plot under wraps, but he instructed the envoy to urge Manga Bell to reconsider.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the filming}} {{locations}} were Lone Pine, Calif., Buffalo Flats in Malibu, Calif., <b>the</b> <b>Paramount</b> Ranch in Agoura, Calif., and the Iverson Movie Ranch in Chatsworth, Calif.

5|$|Reitman needed fifty days to film Up in the Air, {{eight of}} which were devoted to aerial shooting. The aerial shots {{turned out to be}} more {{difficult}} than expected. He was unable to use three days of the aerial filming. Many aerial shots, such as the crop circle on fire, are seen in <b>the</b> <b>Paramount</b> trailer, but are not used in the film. The pilot who flies the Boeing 747 that carried the space shuttle flew the aircraft for the aerial shots.|$|E

5000|$|Trower {{was born}} in Catford, London, but grew up in Southend-on-Sea, Essex. In 1962, he formed a group that became <b>The</b> <b>Paramounts,</b> later {{including}} Westcliff High School pupil Gary Brooker. <b>The</b> <b>Paramounts</b> disbanded in 1966 to pursue individual projects. During this time, Trower created a local three-piece band called the Jam (not {{to be confused with}} the later group with Paul Weller). Trower then joined Brooker's new band Procol Harum following the success of their debut single [...] "A Whiter Shade of Pale" [...] in 1967, remaining with them until 1971 and appearing on Procol Harum's first five albums.|$|R

5|$|The Bahá'í {{writings}} {{emphasize the}} essential equality of human beings, and {{the abolition of}} prejudice. Humanity is seen as essentially one, though highly varied; its diversity of race and culture are seen as worthy of appreciation and acceptance. Doctrines of racism, nationalism, caste, social class, and gender-based hierarchy are seen as artificial impediments to unity. The Bahá'í teachings state that the unification of humanity is <b>the</b> <b>paramount</b> issue in the religious and political conditions of the present world.|$|E

5|$|The {{result of}} this process has been {{described}} as being, in effect, an assertion of paramountcy by the Government of India over the states in a more pervasive form. While this contradicted the British statement that paramountcy would lapse on the transfer of power, the Congress position had always been that independent India would inherit the position of being <b>the</b> <b>paramount</b> power.|$|E
5|$|The site, however, {{was often}} at war and {{inscriptions}} tell of alliances and conflict with other Maya states, including Uaxactun, Caracol, Naranjo and Calakmul.

The earlier part of the Early Classic saw hostilities between Tikal and its neighbor Uaxactun, with Uaxactun recording the capture of prisoners from Tikal.|$|E

5|$|With {{just one}} owned-and-operated station, Paramount's program service never gelled into a true {{television}} network; television historians such as Alex McNeil (1996) consider Paramount programs syndicated rather than network series. While <b>the</b> <b>Paramount</b> series Hollywood Wrestling and Time For Beany were widely seen on stations across the United States, most other Paramount television programs aired {{in only a}} handful of markets (another exception, Hollywood Reel, aired in fourteen major cities in 1950).|$|E
5|$|After filming, {{parts of}} the {{interior}} sets of the So'na ships were added using CGI. Stage 15 on <b>the</b> <b>Paramount</b> lot {{was used for the}} climactic scene between Picard and Ru'afo. Because of the dangers of the four-story scaffolding-like set, the actors were attached by safety cables at all times. Paramount's B tankwhich was used to represent San Francisco Bay in Star Trek IV: The Voyage Homewas used to shoot footage of Picard, Data and Anij at the Ba'ku lake. For a scene in which Data walks along a lake-bed, the actor's tricorder prop was covered with plastic to make it watertight.|$|E
5|$|Allen {{recalled}} The Original Series, {{and said}} that she was pleased to be remembered as an Orion slave girl. However, she was not pleased with the make-up process which took between four and five hours to apply, and required each actress to be sprayed with green make-up over their whole body. Removal of the makeup was via the showers in <b>the</b> <b>Paramount</b> lot's executive gym. The make-up team also needed to apply fake sweat and bruises to other members of the cast to represent the results of the increased aggression shown by them in the episode's plot.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Paramounts</b> {{were signed}} to EMI UK for their releases; {{until one day}} before Procol Harum linked with EMI UK again, they were called The Pinewoods. A last-minute offer from Chris Blackwell's fledgling Island Records label was {{rejected}} by Brooker and band.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Paramounts</b> were an English beat group, {{based in}} Southend-on-Sea, Essex. They had one hit single with their cover version of [...] "Poison Ivy", which reached #35 on the UK Singles Chart in 1964, but are {{primarily}} {{known as the}} fore-runner to Procol Harum.|$|R
5000|$|The first UK {{recording}} of [...] "Baby I'm Yours" [...] {{was made by}} <b>the</b> <b>Paramounts</b> at Abbey Road Studios {{in the summer of}} 1965, but the track went unreleased until their 1998 compilation release <b>The</b> <b>Paramounts</b> at Abbey Road 1963 to 1970. A higher-profile act also on the Columbia UK roster, Peter and Gordon, had the UK hit version of the song, released October 15, 1965, which reached #19 in the UK. The Peter and Gordon version was recorded in an Abbey Road session produced by Norman Newell and featuring Big Jim Sullivan on guitar. Peter Asher — who was partnered with Gordon Waller as Peter and Gordon — would recall: [...] "We did 'Baby I’m Yours' because I loved the original Barbara Lewis record." ...|$|R
