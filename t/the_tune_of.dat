5000|$|The German word Stimmung [...] {{has several}} meanings, {{including}} [...] "tuning" [...] and [...] "mood". The word is the noun formed from the verb stimmen, which means [...] "to harmonize, to be correct", {{and related to}} Stimme (voice). The primary sense of the title [...] "implies not only <b>the</b> outward <b>tuning</b> <b>of</b> voices or instruments, but also <b>the</b> inward <b>tuning</b> <b>of</b> one's soul" [...] According to the composer, the word [...] means [...] "tuning," [...] but it really should be translated with many other words because Stimmung incorporates <b>the</b> meanings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tuning</b> <b>of</b> a piano, <b>the</b> <b>tuning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> voice, <b>the</b> <b>tuning</b> <b>of</b> a group <b>of</b> people, <b>the</b> <b>tuning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> soul. This is all in the German word. Also, when you say: We're in a good Stimmung, you mean a good psychological tuning, being well tuned together.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—A novel {{approach}} to fuzzy modeling based on <b>the</b> <b>tuning</b> <b>of</b> parametric conjunction operations is proposed. First, some novel methods {{for the construction}} of parametric generalized conjunction operations simpler than the known parametric classes of conjunctions are considered and discussed. Second, several examples of function approximation by fuzzy models, based on <b>the</b> <b>tuning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> parameters of the new conjunction operations, are given and their approximation performances are compared with the approaches based on a <b>tuning</b> <b>of</b> membership functions and other approaches proposed in the literature. It is seen that <b>the</b> <b>tuning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> conjunction operations can be used for obtaining fuzzy models with a sufficiently good performance when <b>the</b> <b>tuning</b> <b>of</b> membership functions is not possible or not desirable. Index Terms—Conjunction, disjunction, functions approximation, fuzzy modeling, t-norm. I...|$|R

5|$|Although {{the bailout}} support {{programme}} feature sufficient financial transfers until March 2016, Cyprus began slowly to regain its {{access to the}} private lending markets already in June 2014. At this point of time, the government sold €0.75bn of bonds with a five-year maturity, to <b>the</b> <b>tune</b> <b>of</b> a 4.85% yield. A continued selling of bonds with a ten-year maturity, which would equal a regain of complete access to the private lending market (and {{mark the end of}} the era with need for bailout support), is expected to happen sometime in 2015. The Cypriot minister of finance recently confirmed, that the government plan to issue two new European Medium Term Note (EMTN) bonds in 2015, likely shortly ahead of the expiry of another €1.1bn bond on 1 July and a second expiry of a €0.9bn bond on 1 November. As announced in advance, the Cypriot government issued €1bn of seven-year bonds with a 4.0% yield by the end of April 2015.|$|E
