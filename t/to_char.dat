5|$|At the {{conclusion}} of Brood War, Kerrigan and her Zerg forces became the dominant faction in the Koprulu Sector, having annihilated the United Earth Directorate's Expeditionary Force, defeated the Terran Dominion, and invaded the Protoss homeworld of Aiur. However, after {{the conclusion}} of Brood War, Kerrigan retreats <b>to</b> <b>Char,</b> despite having more than enough power to crush all remaining resistance in the Koprulu Sector. In the four {{years leading up to}} the events of StarCraft II, she has not been seen or heard from by any of the other characters.|$|E
5|$|However, Kerrigan {{does not}} perish, {{and as the}} second chapter begins, the player is charged by the Zerg hive mind, the Overmind, to protect a {{chrysalis}} it claims will be its greatest creation. The chrysalis eventually hatches on the Zerg world Char to reveal Kerrigan having been infested with Zerg DNA, making her a powerful hybrid of both Zerg and Terran genetics. Raynor, drawn <b>to</b> <b>Char</b> by psychic dreams cast by Kerrigan during her incubation, fails {{in an attempt to}} rescue her, but is spared as Kerrigan does not see him as a threat, and possibly due to any lingering affection she had for him. After breaking into a Terran science vessel and reversing the neural conditioning from her training as a psionic agent, Kerrigan is able to sense the presence of the Protoss fleet commander Tassadar on Char. Tassadar diverts Kerrigan's attention long enough for his companion Zeratul to assassinate Zasz, one of the Zerg commanders, with psionic energies the Zerg are unfamiliar with. This causes a temporary mental link between Zeratul and the Overmind, who uses this momentary contact with Zeratul's memories to locate the Protoss homeworld Aiur. The Overmind immediately launches the bulk of the Zerg Swarm in an invasion, although Kerrigan remains behind on Char to hunt down Tassadar and Zeratul.|$|E
5|$|Kerrigan {{returns in}} StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty (2010). At BlizzCon 2007, Chris Metzen {{explained}} {{that in the}} years after Brood War, Kerrigan relocated <b>to</b> <b>Char,</b> pulling back most of the Zerg, and has since been quiet. She has the power to wipe out all her enemies but has not, creating a tense state of peace in the sector. Metzen also indicated an interest in exploring if there was any humanity left in Kerrigan or if she is beyond redemption in her current state. He revealed that Kerrigan's withdrawal {{has little to do with}} any suspicion she has of Duran, who is revealed towards the end of Brood War to be conducting secret experiments on creating a Protoss/Zerg hybrid; she does not know much about him, but in the time after Brood War, she is beginning to piece together the puzzle surrounding his motives. At BlizzCon 2008, Kerrigan made two brief appearances in cinematic trailers, one during an attack on a Terran city that was captured on video, and again in a series of caverns where Zeratul was studying ancient runes; in the latter, Kerrigan implies she has been waiting for his arrival.|$|E

25|$|To {{meet this}} requirement, Folland {{designed}} the Nighthawk, a wooden two-bay biplane. An initial order for 150 Nighthawks {{was placed in}} August 1918, well before prototypes or flight-ready engines were available, with the first prototype, serial number F-2909 flying in April or May 1919. By this time, {{it was clear that}} the Dragonfly had serious problems, being prone to extreme overheating (which was so severe as <b>to</b> <b>char</b> propeller hubs), high fuel consumption and severe vibration (inadvertently being designed to run at its resonance frequency). When the engine could be persuaded to work, the Nighthawk showed excellent performance, but in September 1919, it was finally recognised that the Dragonfly was unsalvagable and the engine programme was cancelled, although by this time 1,147 engines had been delivered.|$|E
500|$|Between {{the end of}} the Brood War and Kerrigan's defeat on Char, Kerrigan created {{numerous}} broodmothers, powerful s, each {{of which}} would lead a brood. The queens were ordered to evolve and only submit to the will of the strongest leader, which became a problem upon Kerrigan's defeat. The brood mothers scattered their broods. Kerrigan was forced to follow and attempt to subdue them. Following the eradication of the last cerebrates in Brood War, Kerrigan creates powerful and intelligent broodmothers to fulfill their role in the Swarm. Kerrigan commanded the broodmothers [...] "to fight, to conquer, to be strong and to lead by force of will". Through decentralizing command hierarchy, Kerrigan ensured the Zerg Swarm could function without leadership. The strongest of these zerg broods, The Zagara Brood, was led by Zagara. Following Kerrigan's defeat and de-infestation on Char, the Zagara brood remained there, seeking large egg piles in an acid marsh. Despite General Horace Warfield's extermination campaign against the zerg remaining on the planet, the brood thrived while all others perished. Its prosperity was interrupted however, when Kerrigan returned <b>to</b> <b>Char</b> and subjugated Zagara, thereby putting the brood under Kerrigan's control.|$|E
500|$|Zagara is a zerg broodmother, Kerrigan's second-in-command, and {{the leader}} of the Zagara Brood. In the absence of the Queen of Blades, Zagara sought to reunite the Swarm under her own leadership. She rallied the feral zerg of Char to her side, and managed to hold out against the genocidal forces of General Horace Warfield. However, her brute tactics {{prevented}} her from achieving victory. When Kerrigan returned <b>to</b> <b>Char,</b> Zagara challenged her authority due to her regained humanity, thus deeming her unworthy to lead the Swarm. Once defeated by Kerrigan, the broodmother was forgiven and rejoined Kerrigan's Zerg Swarm forces. Her renewed loyalty is not left unrewarded though, as once Kerrigan ascends to become a Xel'naga, she relinquishes all command over the Zerg Swarm to Zagara, making her the new [...] "Queen of Blades",but after being evolved by Abathur and subjected to Kerrigan's teaching her some lessons. She is seen in the Epilogue, establishing a foothold over dozens of systems to grant a safe haven for the Zerg Swarm as it rebuilds from the long conflict against the Terrans, the Protoss and Amon's Hybrids forces.|$|E

5000|$|Charring - is {{observed}} as tiny black specs at the fat/non-fat interface in the butyrometer. This problem is due <b>to</b> <b>charring</b> of the milk proteins by the concentrated Gerber acid. It could also arise {{as a result}} of pouring the milk sample directly onto the acid in the butyrometer. <b>To</b> avoid <b>charring,</b> first, ensure the acid concentration is right. Secondly, while adding the milk sample, let it flow {{on the side of the}} butyrometer to avoid violent reaction when it drops on the surface of the acid.|$|R

A [...] tunnel [...] long was dug in 1863 to bring water from the dam through the powder works. Water powered powder mill machinery and was used to dissolve and purify the crude potassium nitrate from Chile. Water was distributed through the powder works by a system of flumes later dismantled when electricity became available to power the wheel mills. Charcoal was manufactured locally using redwood fuel <b>to</b> <b>char</b> willow, madrone and alder. To facilitate transport and shipping, the company built a bridge across the river (the first bridge can be seen in an early panoramic lithograph, viewable online) and purchased a wharf off the main Santa Cruz beach.|$|E

Heating at increments up to 570  °F [300  °C] are intended to better understand connection performance with increase in temperature prior <b>to</b> <b>charring.</b>|$|R

This arranged, she leaned on the poker and waited, while an increasing rapture laid hold on her. She ceased to think. She gave herself up to feel. Her long pleasure was broken by a sound that she had waited for in agony several times in her life. She leaned forward and listened, smiling. There could be no mistake. She closed her eyes and drank it in. Once it ceased abruptly.|$|E

Sometimes he would mix with it a bag of sugar. Sometimes he would sit licking a lump of such salt as is given to cows, or eating a huge lump of dates, stones and all, such as one sees in London on barrows. For drink he walked to the rivulet beyond the {{burnt-out}} site of the Experimental Farm at Hickleybrow and put down his face to the stream. It was from his drinking in that way after eating that the Food of the Gods did at last get loose, spreading first of all in huge weeds from the river-side, then in big frogs, bigger trout and stranding carp, and at last in a fantastic exuberance of vegetation all over the little valley.|$|E

Babemba and the witch-doctor were arguing so fiercely that neither of them seemed to notice what I was doing. Getting the focus right, I directed the concentrated spark straight on to Imbozwi's greased top-knot, where I knew he would feel nothing, my plan being <b>to</b> <b>char</b> a hole in it. But as it happened this top-knot was built up round something of a highly inflammable nature, reed or camphor-wood, I expect.
