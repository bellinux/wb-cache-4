5|$|As the Cold War {{developed}} and <b>the</b> <b>Guatemalan</b> government clashed with U.S. corporations on {{an increasing number}} of issues, the U.S. government grew increasingly suspicious of <b>the</b> <b>Guatemalan</b> Revolution. In addition, the Cold War predisposed the Truman administration to see <b>the</b> <b>Guatemalan</b> government as communist. Arévalo's support for the Caribbean Legion also worried the Truman administration, which saw it as a vehicle for communism, rather than as the anti-dictatorial force it was conceived as. Until the end of its term, the Truman administration had relied on purely diplomatic and economic means to try and reduce the perceived communist influence. The U.S. had refused to sell arms to <b>the</b> <b>Guatemalan</b> government after 1944; in 1951 it began to block all weapons purchases by Guatemala.|$|E

5|$|Castillo Armas' army of 480 men was {{not large}} enough to defeat <b>the</b> <b>Guatemalan</b> military, even with U.S.-supplied aircraft. Therefore, the plans for Operation PBSUCCESS called for a {{campaign}} of psychological warfare, which would present Castillo Armas' victory as a fait accompli to <b>the</b> <b>Guatemalan</b> people, and would force Árbenz to resign. The propaganda campaign had begun well before the invasion, with the U.S. Information Agency (USIA) writing hundreds of articles on Guatemala based on CIA reports, and distributing {{tens of thousands of}} leaflets throughout Latin America. The CIA persuaded friendly governments to screen video footage of Guatemala that supported the U.S. version of events.|$|E
5|$|His {{policies}} ran {{afoul of}} the United Fruit Company, which lobbied the United States government to have him overthrown. The US was also concerned {{by the presence of}} communists in <b>the</b> <b>Guatemalan</b> government, and Árbenz was ousted in the 1954 Guatemalan coup d'état engineered by the US Department of State and the Central Intelligence Agency. Colonel Carlos Castillo Armas replaced him as president. Árbenz went into exile through several countries, where his family gradually fell apart. His daughter committed suicide, and he descended further into alcoholism, eventually dying in Mexico in 1971.

5|$|Although the {{administration}} of Harry Truman had become convinced that <b>the</b> <b>Guatemalan</b> government had been penetrated by communists, it relied on purely diplomatic and economic means to try and reduce the communist influence, {{at least until the}} end of its term. The United States had refused to sell arms to <b>the</b> <b>Guatemalan</b> government after 1944; in 1951 it began to block weapons purchases by Guatemala from other countries. In 1952 Truman became sufficiently convinced of the threat posed by Árbenz to start planning a covert overthrow, titled Operation PBFORTUNE. The plan had originally been suggested by the US supported dictator of Nicaragua, Anastasio Somoza García, who said that if he were given weapons, he could overthrow <b>the</b> <b>Guatemalan</b> government. Truman gave the CIA permission {{to go ahead with the}} plan, without informing the state department. The CIA placed a shipment of weapons on a vessel owned by the United Fruit Company, and the operation was paid for by Rafael Trujillo and Marcos Pérez Jiménez, the right-wing anti-communist dictators of the Dominican Republic and Venezuela, respectively. The operation was to be led by Carlos Castillo Armas. However, the US state department discovered the conspiracy, and secretary of state Dean Acheson persuaded Truman to abort the plan.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, the {{involvement}} of the Kersten committee and of Kersten and Hillings caused concern for the CIA. Dulles constantly worried that their investigation would damage CIA operations, particularly when Hillings visited Guatemala shortly before PBSUCCESS was to begin. Additionally, Congresspeople had not officially been informed of the CIA's role in the coup, and Dulles wished to keep them uninformed. By supplying them with PBHistory documents, Dulles hoped to forestall them from inadvertently exposing the CIA's other projects. Following the hearings, a subcommittee headed by Hillings produced a final report. In addition to stating without evidence that <b>the</b> <b>Guatemalan</b> government had been acting under orders from the Soviet Union, this report also falsely claimed that Soviet weapons had been brought covertly to Guatemala by submarine. This unintentionally drew attention to Operation WASHTUB, a CIA effort to foist incriminating weapons on <b>the</b> <b>Guatemalan</b> government.|$|E

5|$|Castillo Armas {{was given}} {{enough money to}} recruit a small force of mercenaries from among Guatemalan exiles and the populations of nearby countries. This band was called the Army of Liberation. The CIA {{established}} training camps in Nicaragua and Honduras and supplied them with weapons {{as well as several}} bombers. The U.S. signed military agreements with both those countries prior to the invasion of Guatemala, allowing it to move heavier arms freely. These preparations were only superficially covert: the CIA intended Árbenz to find out about them, as a part of its plan to convince <b>the</b> <b>Guatemalan</b> people that the overthrow of Árbenz was a fait accompli. Additionally, the CIA made covert contact with a number of church leaders throughout <b>the</b> <b>Guatemalan</b> countryside, and persuaded them to incorporate anti-government messages into their sermons.|$|E
5|$|During this period, Castillo Armas {{had begun}} to intensify his aerial attacks, with the extra planes that Eisenhower had approved. They had limited {{material}} success; many of their bombs were surplus material from World War II, and failed to explode. Nonetheless, they had a significant psychological impact. On 25 June, {{the same day that}} he received the army's ultimatum, Árbenz learned that Castillo Armas had scored what later proved to be his only military victory, defeating <b>the</b> <b>Guatemalan</b> garrison at Chiquimula. Historian Piero Gleijeses has stated that {{if it were not for}} U.S. support for the rebellion, the officer corps of <b>the</b> <b>Guatemalan</b> army would have remained loyal to Árbenz because, although they were not uniformly his supporters, they were more wary of Castillo Armas, and also had strong nationalist views. As it was, they believed that the U.S. would intervene militarily, leading to a battle they could not win.|$|E
5|$|Early in {{the morning}} on 27 June 1954, a CIA Lockheed P-38M Lightning {{attacked}} Puerto San José and dropped napalm bombs on the British cargo ship, , which was on charter to the U.S. company W.R. Grace and Company Line, and was being loaded with Guatemalan cotton and coffee. This incident cost the CIA one million U.S. dollars in compensation. On 22 June, another rebel plane bombed the Honduran town of San Pedro de Copán; John Dulles claimed the attack had been by <b>the</b> <b>Guatemalan</b> air force, thus avoiding diplomatic consequences. The handful of bombers that the rebel forces had begun with were shot down by <b>the</b> <b>Guatemalan</b> army within a few days, causing Castillo Armas to demand more from the CIA. Eisenhower quickly agreed to provide these additional planes, bolstering the rebel force. William Pawley had a crucial role to play in the delivery of these aircraft.|$|E

5|$|However, <b>the</b> <b>Guatemalan</b> {{group was}} not granted {{the power to}} arrest or search house of {{prominent}} government officials who had served under Árbenz. This was largely because Armas and other military leaders lacked trust in the Comité. Nevertheless, the Comité was able to conduct personal searches of exiles {{as they left the}} country. This proved to be ineffective as very few documents proved to be revealing.|$|E
5|$|In November 1952, Dwight Eisenhower {{was elected}} {{president}} of the US. Eisenhower's campaign had promised a more hawkish stance against communism. Many senior figures in his cabinet, including John Foster Dulles and his brother Allen, had close connections to the United Fruit Company, which made Eisenhower more strongly predisposed than Truman to support Árbenz's overthrow. In June 1954, the US trained and funded an invasion force led by Castillo Armas, backed by an intense campaign of psychological warfare by the CIA. Árbenz resigned on 27 June 1954, ending <b>the</b> <b>Guatemalan</b> Revolution. From 1954 onwards Guatemala was ruled by a series of US-backed military dictators, leading to <b>the</b> <b>Guatemalan</b> Civil War. 200,000 civilians were killed in the war, and numerous human rights violations committed, including massacres of civilian populations, rape, aerial bombardment, and forced disappearances. 93% of these violations were committed by the United States-backed military, which included a genocidal scorched-earth campaign against the indigenous Maya population in the 1980s.|$|E
