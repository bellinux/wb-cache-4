40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{encourage}} a new stream of research into complaints and the role of the chief executive officer (<b>CEO).</b> <b>The</b> objectives of this paper were firstly to assess the intensity of dissatisfaction driving customers to complain directly to <b>the</b> <b>CEO</b> and secondly to ascertain if the reasons for complaining to <b>the</b> <b>CEO</b> were different to those of complainants using ‘normal’ channels. A leading financial services company in the UK provided access to its complaint letters and its CEO. Based on analysis of a sample of 100 letters sent to <b>the</b> <b>CEO</b> and 100 standard complaint letters, it was found that customers complaining directly to <b>the</b> <b>CEO</b> have a significantly greater intensity of dissatisfaction. However, unexpectedly, despite the greater positional power of <b>the</b> <b>CEO,</b> <b>the</b> reasons for complaining to <b>the</b> <b>CEO</b> were little different to the reasons for using the ‘normal’ channels. Interestingly most of the complainants to <b>the</b> <b>CEO</b> had multiple reasons for complaint suggesting that complaints to <b>the</b> <b>CEO</b> are motivated by multiple underlying service failures...|$|R

50|$|The {{functions}} of <b>the</b> <b>CEO</b> vary from school district to school district.

25|$|The {{business}} community reacted strongly to Weld's leadership. In a 1994 survey of chief executives {{conducted by the}} Massachusetts High Technology Council, 83% of those polled rated the state's business climate as good or excellent—up from only 33% {{at the beginning of}} his term. Proponents might claim that Weld's leadership changed the minds of 50% of <b>the</b> <b>CEOs</b> surveyed while others would note the national economic trends or other factors might play a part. Weld also reaped the benefits of the 1990s prosperity, as the state's unemployment rate fell by more than 3 percentage points during his first term, from 9.6% in 1991 to 6.4% in 1994. As a result, Weld received grades of A in 1992, B in 1994, and B in 1996 from the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, in their biennial Fiscal Policy Report Card on America's Governors. In 1993 he supported adoption of a gun control bill in Massachusetts that included limits on gun purchases under age 21, as well as prohibiting certain types of weapons, which was not ultimately passed. He has since renounced this proposal. During his term, he launched a successful effort to privatize many state's human services, laying off thousands of state employees. After cutting state spending year-over-year for his first two years, the Republican Party lost its ability to sustain a veto in the legislature due to losses in the Massachusetts State Senate, forcing Weld to make greater concessions to Democratic legislators.|$|E
