5|$|After {{graduating from}} Yale Law School, Clinton {{returned}} to Arkansas {{and became a}} law professor at the University of Arkansas. In 1974, he ran for the House of Representatives. Running in a conservative district against incumbent Republican John Paul Hammerschmidt, Clinton's campaign was bolstered by the anti-Republican and anti-incumbent mood resulting from the Watergate scandal. Hammerschmidt, who had received 77 percent of the vote in 1972, defeated Clinton by only a 52percent to 48percent margin. In 1976, Clinton ran for Arkansas Attorney General.

5|$|As {{the coal}} boom began to wane, Patton sold {{most of his}} coal {{interests}} in 1978. After a meeting with allies of his friend, First District Congressman Carroll Hubbard, in Madisonville on September 20, 1978, Patton considered running for governor in 1979. However, he subsequently decided that he lacked the time to organize a campaign before the May primary election; a letter leaked to the Paducah Sun showed that he believed he was losing Hubbard's support. He joined Terry McBrayer's campaign during <b>the</b> <b>primary,</b> <b>and</b> after McBrayer lost, he worked to elect John Y. Brown, Jr., the Democratic nominee. Brown won the election, and Patton was appointed deputy secretary of transportation. He served only three months before resigning to protest Brown's proposal for a coal severance tax.|$|E

40|$|The {{kinematics}} of both <b>the</b> <b>primaries</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> multiples (multiple diffractions) from sea-floor scatterers {{have similar}} characteristics when {{the sea floor}} is reasonably smooth and has only isolated irregularities. The multiple diffractions, like <b>the</b> <b>primary</b> scattering, are organised in mid-point gathers {{in such a way}} that mid-point stacking can enhance portions of the multiple. Also like <b>the</b> <b>primary</b> scattering, <b>the</b> multiples can be distinguished from primary reflection events in the data by their dip in pre-stack shot and receiver gathers. Pre-stack dip-filtering in those domains can be used to remove the portions of the multiple diffractions that are enhanced by the mid-point stack, in the same way that dip-filtering can be used to remove <b>the</b> <b>primary</b> scattering. Shot <b>and</b> receiver dip-filtering can, however, damage diffractions and lateral amplitude changes in primary reflections. A partial strategy in less complex structure is to apply pre-stack imaging in conjunction with the multiple removal, with the aim of simplifying <b>the</b> <b>primaries</b> <b>and</b> increasing <b>the</b> separation between <b>primaries</b> <b>and</b> multiples...|$|R

5|$|Eruptions on Mauna Loa {{are almost}} always preceded and {{accompanied}} by prolonged episodes of seismic activity, the monitoring of which was <b>the</b> <b>primary</b> <b>and</b> often only warning mechanism {{in the past and}} which remains viable today. Seismic stations have been maintained on Hawaiʻi since the Observatory's inception, but these were concentrated primarily on Kīlauea, with coverage on Mauna Loa improving only slowly through the 20th century. Following the invention of modern monitoring equipment, the backbone of the present-day monitoring system was installed on the volcano in the 1970s. Mauna Loa's July 1975 eruption was forewarned by {{more than a year of}} seismic unrest, with the HVO issuing warnings to the general public from late 1974; the 1984 eruption was similarly preceded by as much as three years of unusually high seismic activity, with volcanologists predicting an eruption within two years in 1983.|$|E

The strategist also served as Holt's campaign manager in the California 22nd Congressional district Republican primary. Senator Nixon endorsed Holt over State Senator Jack Tenney, and Chotiner asked Nixon to supply him with Tenney's House Un-American Activities Committee file—the state senator had once had communist leanings, though he had long renounced them. Nixon arranged for Chotiner to get the file, {{which was supposed to}} be for Congressional use only, though he apparently made no public use of the file in the campaign.

5|$|Nearly 78 {{percent of}} the {{estimated}} 26,000 trees harvested for use at Chetro Ketl were felled between 1030 and 1060. More than 7,000 trees were felled for kiva (round room) construction alone, with approximately 750 used in the great kiva. Roofs typically consisted of primary beams, secondary beams, {{and one or two}} layers of split shakes, probably of a juniper species or pinyon pine, which were locally available. Most of <b>the</b> <b>primary</b> <b>and</b> secondary construction beams were of ponderosa pine. In addition to bulk materials, construction required other items in smaller quantities. Cordage was used for lashing roof elements together, and baskets and wood frames were needed for transporting mortar and rock. Other tools, such as digging sticks and hammerstones, were used in quantity; many discarded hammerstones have been found built into the wall interiors.|$|E
5|$|SR104 was {{established}} during the 1964 state highway renumbering as {{the successor to}} several state highways: SSH9E between Discovery Bay and Port Gamble, PSH21 between Port Gamble and Kingston, SSH1W in Edmonds, and SSH2B between Edmonds and Lake Forest Park. The highway between Port Gamble and Kingston {{was established}} in 1915 as part of State Road21, which extended south to Bremerton. During the creation of <b>the</b> <b>Primary</b> <b>and</b> secondary state highways in 1937, State Road21 was re-designated as PSH21 and extended south to Gorst. SSH9E was also established, connecting US101 and PSH9 in Discovery Bay to Port Ludlow, along with SSH1W from US99 and PSH1 in Lynnwood through Edmonds to US99 and PSH1 in Woodway, following the route of an unpaved road built in the 1890s.
