25|$|The James Bond {{films are}} also {{known to have}} plots {{surrounding}} nuclear weapons. Films like Thunderball (1965), You Only Live Twice (1967), Diamonds Are Forever (1971), The Spy Who Loved Me (1977), Octopussy (1983), Tomorrow Never Dies (1997) and The World Is Not Enough (1999) involve nuclear weapons. Some are based around their threatened use or theft, others in a showdown between the superpowers. The threat is prevented by Bond {{in the nick of}} time, although weapons are detonated in The Spy Who Loved Me when two Polaris missiles each destroy a stolen nuclear submarine out at sea, British and Russian respectively. However, these do not harm the world's population or land, killing only the villain's crews in each stolen submarine. In Goldfinger (1964) the titular antagonist (with assistance from Chinese and North Korean agents who want economic collapse in the West) attempts <b>to</b> <b>irradiate</b> the US's national gold reserves stored at Fort Knox with an atomic bomb in order to increase the value of his own stockpile. The villain in Octopussy (1983) was a power-mad renegade Soviet general opposed to disarmament talks with NATO, who hatches an elaborate plot to invade Western Europe after the clandestine placement and detonation of a nuclear weapon on a US Air Force base in West Germany. GoldenEye (1995) focuses on a nuclear satellite weapon that unleashes a powerful electromagnetic pulse attack upon whatever area it is detonated over, destroying anything with an electronic circuit.|$|E

500|$|Richard Maibaum, who co-wrote the {{previous}} films, returned {{to adapt the}} seventh James Bond novel. Maibaum fixed the novel's heavily criticised plot hole, where Goldfinger actually attempts to empty Fort Knox. In the film, Bond notes it would take twelve days for Goldfinger to steal the gold, before the villain reveals he actually intends <b>to</b> <b>irradiate</b> it with the then topical concept of a Red Chinese atomic bomb. However, Harry Saltzman disliked the first draft, and brought in Paul Dehn to revise it. Hamilton said Dehn [...] "brought out the British side of things". Connery disliked his draft, so Maibaum returned. Dehn also suggested the pre-credit sequence to be an action scene with no relevance to the actual plot. Wolf Mankowitz, an un-credited screenwriter on Dr. No, suggested the scene where Oddjob puts his car into a car crusher to dispose of a dead body. Because {{of the quality of}} work of Maibaum and Dehn, the script and outline for Goldfinger became the blueprint for future Bond films.|$|E

40|$|A {{temporal}} {{relationship has been}} demonstrated between persisting immune complexes and non-antigen-specific immunodepression. Mice were given intraperitoneal injections of Bordetella pertussis at weekly intervals. After 7 weeks they developed circulating immune complexes, the levels of which increased with continued administration of pertussis. The increase in immune complex levels {{was accompanied by a}} diminished primary immune response to intraperitoneally injected sheep erythrocytes (SRBC) as judged by a reduction in their direct and indirect plaque-forming cell response and serum agglutination titres. Spleen cells from immunodepressed pertussis-treated mice were transferred <b>to</b> <b>irradiated</b> normal recipients and displayed a normal response to SRBC. By contrast, spleen cells transferred from normal donors <b>to</b> <b>irradiated</b> pertussis-treated recipients had an impaired response to SRBC. Thus, the immunodepression caused by pertussis treatment is a property of the environment and not the lymphocytes themselves.
