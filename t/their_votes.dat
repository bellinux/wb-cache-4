One national electronic voter list was used for early voting; though for the 17 April poll, voters could only vote at their designated local polling station. The expatriate voter turnout in 91 countries rose by 2.2% to a record-high 10.7%, with 35,000 people casting <b>their</b> <b>votes.</b> In addition, 400 Finns voted on ships at sea.|$|E
5|$|Despite Auburn's {{victory and}} undefeated season, {{they were not}} named {{national}} champions. That honor went to the University of Southern California, which defeated Oklahoma in the 2005 national championship game, 55–19. Three voters in the final Associated Press poll of the season voted Auburn the number one team in the country, but <b>their</b> <b>votes</b> were not enough to deny USC a national championship, as voted {{by members of the}} Associated Press and Coaches' polls. Several players from each team were selected in the 2005 NFL Draft and went on to careers in the National Football League.|$|E
5|$|Each state's presidential electors {{gathered}} in their state's capital on February 4, 1789 to cast <b>their</b> <b>votes</b> for the president. As the election occurred prior to {{ratification of the}} Twelfth Amendment, each elector cast two votes for the presidency, though the electors {{were not allowed to}} cast both votes for the same person. Under the terms of the constitution, the individual who won the most electoral votes would become president while the individual with the second-most electoral votes would become vice president. Each state's votes were sealed and delivered to Congress to be counted.|$|E
40|$|We {{study how}} {{changes in the}} {{barriers}} ex-felons face to restore <b>their</b> <b>voting</b> rights affect <b>their</b> political participation in Iowa. Prior to Executive Order 42, ex-felons were required to submit applications to request the restoration of <b>their</b> <b>voting</b> rights. We build an original dataset of who applied to have <b>their</b> <b>voting</b> rights restored and which of these applications were granted. These data reveal {{that only a small}} percentage of exfelons submitted applications. While most applications were granted, those submitted by individuals convicted of violent crimes, particularly sex crimes, were substantially more likely to be denied. The signing of Executive Order 42 in 2005 and Executive Order 70 in 2011 generates variation in whether ex-felons must submit applications to restore <b>their</b> <b>voting</b> rights. Our results show that eliminating applications increases ex-felon political participation, especially when ex-felons are notified that <b>their</b> <b>voting</b> rights are automatically restored...|$|R

5|$|Members of the IOC did not {{disclose}} <b>their</b> <b>votes,</b> but news reports speculated that broad international support led to China's selection, especially from developing nations who had received assistance from China {{in the construction of}} stadiums. The size of China, its increased enforcement of doping controls, and sympathy concerning its loss of the 2000 Summer Olympics to Sydney were all factors in the decision. Eight years earlier, Beijing had led every round of voting for the 2000 Summer Olympics before losing to Sydney by two votes in the final round.|$|E
5|$|Parker's long {{service on}} the bench {{proved to be an}} {{advantage}} in his nomination, as he had avoided taking stands on issues that divided the party, particularly that of currency standards. Hill and other Parker supporters remained deliberately silent on their candidate's beliefs. By the time the convention cast <b>their</b> <b>votes,</b> it was clear that no candidate but Parker could unify the party, and he was selected on the first ballot. Henry G. Davis, an elderly West Virginia millionaire and former senator, was selected as the vice presidential candidate in the hope that he would partially finance Parker's campaign.|$|E
5|$|Pittsburgh was a Republican stronghold {{starting}} in the 1880s, and the Republican governments provided jobs and assistance for the new immigrants in return for <b>their</b> <b>votes.</b> But the Great Depression {{starting in}} 1929 ruined the GOP in the city. The Democratic victory of 1932 meant an end to Republican patronage jobs and assistance. As the Depression worsened, Pittsburgh ethnics voted heavily for the Democrats, especially in 1934, making the city a stronghold of the New Deal Coalition. By 1936, Democratic programs for relief and jobs, especially the WPA, were so popular with the ethnics that a large majority voted for the Democrats.|$|E

5|$|Randall left {{no doubt}} about his sympathies when he {{assigned}} members to the committee, stacking it with Hayes's enemies from both parties. The committee's investigation had {{the opposite of the}} Democrats' intended effect, uncovering telegrams from Tilden's nephew, William Tilden Pelton, offering bribes to Southern Republicans in the disputed states to help Tilden claim <b>their</b> <b>votes.</b> The Pelton telegrams were in code, which the committee was able to decode; Republicans had also sent ciphered dispatches, but the committee was unable to decode them. The ensuing excitement fizzled out by June 1878 as the Congress went into recess.|$|E
5|$|Ten men {{received}} {{votes on}} the first vice-presidential ballot. Mississippi's John A. Quitman had the most support with 59 votes. Eight state delegations – {{with a total of}} 55 votes – voted for Breckinridge in spite of his refusal of the nomination, making him the second-highest vote getter. Kentucky cast its 12 votes for Boyd, bringing his third-place total to 33 votes. Seeing Breckinridge's strength on the first ballot, large numbers of delegates voted for him on the second ballot, {{and those who did not}} soon saw that his nomination was inevitable and changed <b>their</b> <b>votes</b> to make it unanimous.|$|E
5|$|The Ipswich Town Player of the Year {{award is}} voted for {{annually}} by Ipswich Town's supporters {{in recognition of}} the best overall performance by an individual player throughout the football season.

They do this by submitting a paper slip to the club's Portman Road offices, with the winner being the player who polls the most votes.

50|$|Turnout {{followed}} recent trends, at {{a slightly}} improved 19.5%, although the three wards that trailed postal voting seen marked increases. Similarities ended there, as the Conservatives seen a dramatic recovery in their fortunes, with their voter share {{rising to the}} highest since 1980, and <b>their</b> <b>vote</b> near double recent years figures. Labour, in turn, suffered double-digit swings against them in most wards, with a sharp fall in <b>their</b> <b>vote</b> share to pre-peak levels and <b>their</b> lowest <b>vote</b> figure since the council's inception, narrowly surpassing the previous figure set in 1975. The Lib Dems seen another year of modest improvement in <b>their</b> <b>vote,</b> and the two returning Independents, {{as well as a}} third in Hindley garnered large swings towards them.|$|R

The Conservatives managed to increase modestly upon their rock-bottom standing {{of the previous}} year, but on accumulated votes they failed to surpass anything other than their nadir. The Lib Dems figure reflected their seventies-style participation, with <b>their</b> <b>vote</b> share reduced to single figures for the first since 1980, and <b>their</b> lowest <b>vote</b> figure since 1978.|$|R
5|$|Congressman Phillip Burton, Assemblyman Willie Brown, {{and other}} California {{politicians}} recognized the growing clout {{and organization of}} homosexuals in the city, and courted <b>their</b> <b>votes</b> by attending meetings {{of gay and lesbian}} organizations. Brown pushed for legalization of sex between consenting adults in 1969 but failed. SIR was also pursued by popular moderate Supervisor Dianne Feinstein in her bid to become mayor, opposing Alioto. Ex-policeman Richard Hongisto worked for 10 years to change the conservative views of the San Francisco Police Department, and also actively appealed to the gay community, which responded by raising significant funds for his campaign for sheriff. Though Feinstein was unsuccessful, Hongisto's win in 1971 showed the political clout of the gay community.|$|E
5|$|Each state's presidential electors {{gathered}} in their state's capital on February 4, 1789 to cast <b>their</b> <b>votes</b> for the president. As originally prescribed by Article II of the Constitution, each state chose {{a number of}} electors equal to its representation in Congress. Each elector then cast two votes for president, though the electors {{were not allowed to}} cast both votes for the same person, and were prohibited from casting both their ballots for persons from their own state. The individual who won the most electoral votes would become president while the individual with the second-most electoral votes would become vice president. Each state's votes were sealed and delivered to Congress to be counted. Adams received 34 electoral college votes in the presidential election of 1789, finishing in second place behind George Washington, who garnered 69 votes. As a result, Washington became the nation's first president, and Adams became the its first vice president.|$|E
5|$|In 1795, Scott {{traveled}} to Philadelphia to help clarify service records {{that would determine}} the final pay {{of the men who}} served under him before returning to his farm in Kentucky. He continued to serve, nominally, as major general of the 2nd militia division of the state militia until 1799. Celebrations of Scott's military heroism were held all over Kentucky, sparking his interest in a political career. With the advent of the First Party System, he declared himself a Democratic-Republican, as did most Kentuckians. In 1800, he was chosen as a presidential elector for his district by a vote of 75 to 44 over Caleb Wallace. Scott and his fellow electors all cast <b>their</b> <b>votes</b> for the ticket of Thomas Jefferson and Aaron Burr.|$|E

5000|$|After a {{great deal}} of infighting {{conservative}} presidential candidate Pat Buchanan was granted the party's ballot line. Due to confusion over the ballot, many residents miscast <b>their</b> <b>vote</b> for Buchanan, believing they were casting <b>their</b> <b>vote</b> for Al Gore. Thus, Buchanan received an unexpected 3,407 votes in Palm Beach County. Many accused Buchanan of being a [...] "spoiler." ...|$|R
5|$|John Adams {{was running}} {{this time with}} Charles Cotesworth Pinckney of South Carolina (the elder brother of {{candidate}} Thomas Pinckney from the 1796 election). Hamilton now toured New England, again urging northern electors to hold firm for Pinckney in the renewed hope of making Pinckney president; and he again intrigued in South Carolina. Hamilton's ideas involved coaxing middle-state Federalists to assert their non-support for Adams {{if there was no}} support for Pinckney and writing to more of the modest supports of Adams concerning his supposed misconduct while president. Hamilton expected to see southern states such as the Carolinas cast <b>their</b> <b>votes</b> for Pinckney and Jefferson, and would result in the former being ahead of both Adams and Jefferson.|$|E
5|$|Pierce {{was unable}} to secure the {{nomination}} at the national convention, so Breckinridge switched his support to Stephen Douglas, but the combination of Pierce and Douglas supporters did not prevent James Buchanan's nomination. After Douglas's floor manager, William Richardson, suggested that nominating Breckinridge for vice president would help Buchanan secure the support of erstwhile Douglas backers in the general election, Louisiana's J. L. Lewis nominated him. Breckinridge declined in deference to Linn Boyd but received 51 votes on the first ballot, behind Mississippi's John A. Quitman with 59, but ahead of third-place Boyd, who garnered 33. On the second ballot, Breckinridge received overwhelming support, and opposition delegates changed <b>their</b> <b>votes</b> to make his nomination unanimous.|$|E
5|$|Special {{trains to}} Oxford were {{provided}} {{on the day}} of the election, 7 December 1860, for non-residents to cast <b>their</b> <b>votes.</b> At the end of the hard-fought campaign, Williams won by a majority of over 220 votes. Thereafter, he helped to establish the Indian Institute at Oxford, received a knighthood, and held the chair until his death in 1899. Müller, although deeply disappointed by his defeat, remained in Oxford for the rest of his career, but never taught Sanskrit there. The 1860 election was the last time that Convocation chose the Boden professor, as this power was removed in 1882 as a result of reforms imposed by Parliament. , the professorship is still in existence, and is now the last remaining Sanskrit professorship in the United Kingdom.|$|E

50|$|The {{election}} saw the Conservatives {{remain in}} overall {{control of the}} council after winning 13 of the 15 seats which were contested. They gained Eastbrook from the Liberal Democrats having lost it in a double vacancy at the 2010 elections, but this gain was offset {{by the loss of}} Cokeham to Labour, who thus gained their first representation on the council since 2006. In addition Labour saw <b>their</b> <b>vote</b> share rise by more than 12% across the district, whilst the UK Independence Party (UKIP) also saw <b>their</b> <b>vote</b> share increase. The Liberal Democrats were the main losers, seeing <b>their</b> <b>vote</b> fall by 14%, pushing their into fourth place, behind UKIP.|$|R
