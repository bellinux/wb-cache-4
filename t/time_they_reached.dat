5|$|In the FA Cup, Rovers {{have reached}} the quarter-final stage on three occasions. The first time was in 1950–51 when they faced Newcastle United at St James' Park {{in front of a}} crowd of 62,787, the record for the highest {{attendance}} at any Bristol Rovers match. The second <b>time</b> <b>they</b> <b>reached</b> the quarter final was in 1957–58, when they lost to Fulham, and the most recent appearance {{at this stage of the}} competition was during the 2007–08 season, when they faced West Bromwich Albion. They were the first Division Three team to win an FA Cup tie away to a Premier League side, when in 2002 they beat Derby County 3–1 at Pride Park Stadium.|$|E
5|$|The Panic of 1893 had damaged labor {{conditions}} {{across the}} United States, and {{the victory of}} anti-silver legislation worsened the mood of western laborers. A group of workingmen led by Jacob S. Coxey began to march east toward Washington, D.C. to protest Cleveland's policies. This group, known as Coxey's Army, agitated {{in favor of a}} national roads program to give jobs to workingmen, and a weakened currency to help farmers pay their debts. By the <b>time</b> <b>they</b> <b>reached</b> Washington, only a few hundred remained, and when they were arrested the next day for walking on the lawn of the United States Capitol, the group scattered. Even though Coxey's Army may not have been a threat to the government, it signaled a growing dissatisfaction in the West with Eastern monetary policies.|$|E
5|$|At 21:00, about 100 {{men of the}} 19th Infantry {{moved into}} the hills {{to the east of}} the town. They carried with them about 30 wounded, {{including}} several litter-bound patients too seriously wounded to walk. Some of the group of 100 were ordered to carry these men, but many of them separated from the group in the mountains. By the <b>time</b> <b>they</b> <b>reached</b> the top of the mountain, officers decided some of the seriously wounded could not be carried any further, as their carriers were exhausted. The regimental medical officer, Captain Linton J. Buttrey, and Chaplain Herman G. Felhoelter remained behind with the wounded, intending to move them when another group of troops came through who could carry them. Buttrey wore a Red Cross brassard identifying him as a medic, while Felhoelter wore a large white Latin cross brassard, identifying him as a military chaplain in the U.S. Army Chaplain Corps. The two who remained and the wounded were non-combatants under international law, as they carried no weapons.|$|E

5|$|The {{defending}} army, the Nanking Garrison Force, was {{on paper}} a formidable army of thirteen divisions, including three elite German-trained divisions plus the super-elite Training Brigade, {{but in reality}} most of these units had trickled back to Nanking severely mauled from the fighting in Shanghai. By the <b>time</b> <b>they</b> <b>reached</b> Nanking they were physically exhausted, low on equipment, and badly depleted in total troop strength. In order to replenish some of these units, 16,000 young men and teenagers from Nanking and the rural villages surrounding it were speedily pressed into service as new recruits. An additional 14,000 fresh soldiers were brought in from Hankou to fill {{the ranks of the}} 2nd Army. However, due the unexpected rapidity of the Japanese advance, most of the new conscripts received only rudimentary training on how to fire their guns on their way to or upon their arrival at the frontlines. No definitive statistics exist on how many soldiers the Nanking Garrison Force had managed to cobble together {{by the time of the}} battle, but among leading estimates are those of David Askew who says 73,790 to 81,500, those of Ikuhiko Hata who estimates 100,000, and those of Tokushi Kasahara who argues in favor of about 150,000.|$|E

During his first term, Peres sided with the liberals in Portugal.|$|E

25|$|Towards {{the end of}} May, the INA's 1st and 2nd Guerrilla Regiments (the latter {{commanded}} by Malik Munawar Khan Awan) had been redirected to Kohima. They moved north across the Japanese rear but by the <b>time</b> <b>they</b> <b>reached</b> Ukhrul, the Japanese {{had already begun to}} withdraw. They decided to attack Imphal instead. At Imphal, both units suffered some desertions, but not on the scale that the Commonwealth forces expected.|$|E
25|$|The {{town was}} often the target of enemies across the English Channel, {{especially}} during the Hundred Years' War. In 1340 French attackers, who had been successfully burning towns along the coast by surprise, burned a manor house and took some prisoners, but failed {{to get into the}} town; by the <b>time</b> <b>they</b> <b>reached</b> Plymouth, they had lost the advantage of surprise. In 1403, the town was briefly occupied and burnt by Breton raiders.|$|E

25|$|Portuguese {{reinforcements}} forced marched {{along the}} coast, crossing three major rivers by boats. They did not encounter any Kandyan troops and advanced without encountering resistance. However, by the <b>time</b> <b>they</b> <b>reached</b> Aluthgama, Mendonça {{realized that he}} would not be able to reach Galle in time. So he sent Francisco Antunes, the Dissawe of Matara, in advance with a detachment of Lascarins from the Korale of Galle. They managed to reach Galle on the morning of 8 March 1640, just before the arrival of Dutch.|$|E
25|$|When the {{launches}} {{approached the}} bay, Captain Lourenço Ferreira de Brito (commander of the Galle fort) sent a force under Francisco Antunes {{to open up}} trenches at Magale to check the landing of the Dutch. This force consisted of three companies from the garrison and the Lascarins who came {{with him in the}} morning. However, the Dutch were efficient in their landing and Portuguese had to advance along the curve of the bay. By the <b>time</b> <b>they</b> <b>reached</b> there, the Dutch were in battle formation and had deployed cannons.|$|E
25|$|As {{they left}} {{carrying}} the sick officers in hammocks they experienced some harassment and raids by natives ruled by Lukuku, and the march was exceptionally hard {{owing to the}} heavy rains {{at the end of}} the wet season (as well as to the continuing illness and weakness of expedition members). Bonchamps had recovered by the <b>time</b> <b>they</b> <b>reached</b> Lake Tanganyika and was put in charge by Stairs, who had not fully recovered. This caused some friction between Bonchamps and Moloney, and there are some contradictions between their accounts.|$|E

25|$|At dawn of 20 January, the 3/16th Punjab Regiment, {{commanded}} by Lieutenant Colonel Henry Moorhead (who {{took part in}} Operation Krohcol), was ordered to recapture the ridge. By the <b>time</b> <b>they</b> <b>reached</b> it, they came under friendly fire from the Norfolks, who had mistaken them for the Japanese, causing several casualties. After losses on both sides, it was later sorted out. But before a proper defence could be organised, the Japanese attacked, killing Moorhead and driving both the Norfolks and Indian troops off the hill. The 45th Brigade and the two Australian battalions at Bakri were now {{in danger of being}} cut off.|$|E
25|$|The UFW {{considered}} more mass picketing, more rallies, and more boycotts, but the union {{was worried that}} it had lost the support of farm workers and the public and that such events would point out {{the weakness of the}} union rather than its strength. Instead, the UFW settled on a 110-mile (180km) march by a small group of UFW leaders from San Francisco to the E & J Gallo Winery in Modesto. The organizers envisioned a small but dramatic march that would not require large numbers of participants. Just a few hundred marchers left San Francisco on February 22, 1975. But more than 15,000 people joined them en route by the <b>time</b> <b>they</b> <b>reached</b> Modesto on March 1.|$|E
25|$|On-board {{weather radar}} gave good {{information}} to the crew about the approach and movement of the severe weather system. The CVR contains details of repeated discussion of weather amongst the crew between 12:38 and 12:54. Initially, there was some doubt amongst the crew members whether the radar returns being displayed were ground echoes or were from inclement weather around the airfield. However, the crew soon realized that the weather radar was not showing ground echoes but was indicating adverse weather as confirmed by the co-pilot's exclamatory comments at 12:46 and at 12:47. They even discussed that the clouds were moving and hoped that the airfield would be clear of clouds by the <b>time</b> <b>they</b> <b>reached</b> the airfield.|$|E
