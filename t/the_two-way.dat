5|$|After winning {{back to back}} Presidents' Trophies {{in prior}} seasons the Canucks were {{projected}} as Stanley Cup contenders. The prediction was based on Vancouver's team depth, the offense provided by Daniel and Henrik Sedin, <b>the</b> <b>two-way</b> play of Kesler and Alexandre Burrows, plus the versatility of the Canuck's top four defenceman. The Hockey News predicted that the Canucks would win the Northwest Division and finish as the second place team in the Western Conference.|$|E
5|$|Instead of {{focusing}} on individual organisms, paleoecology examines the interactions between different organisms, such as their places in food chains, and <b>the</b> <b>two-way</b> interaction between organisms and their environment.  One example {{is the development of}} oxygenic photosynthesis by bacteria, which hugely increased the productivity and diversity of ecosystems. This also caused the oxygenation of the atmosphere. Together, these were a prerequisite for the evolution of the most complex eukaryotic cells, from which all multicellular organisms are built.|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} {{relation}} between <b>the</b> standard <b>two-way</b> automata and more powerful devices, namely, two-way finite automata with an additional "pebble" movable along the input tape. Similarly {{as in the case}} of <b>the</b> classical <b>two-way</b> machines, it is not known whether there exists a polynomial trade-off, in the number of states, between the nondeterministic and deterministic pebble two-way automata. However, we show that these two machine models are not independent: if there exists a polynomial trade-off for <b>the</b> classical <b>two-way</b> automata, then there must also exist a polynomial trade-off for <b>the</b> pebble <b>two-way</b> automata. Thus, we have an upward collapse (or a downward separation) from <b>the</b> classical <b>two-way</b> automata to more powerful pebble automata, still staying within the class of regular languages. The same upward collapse holds for complementation of nondeterministic two-way machines. These results are obtained by showing that each pebble machine can be, by using suitable inputs, simulated by a classical two-way automaton with a linear number of states (and vice versa), despite the existing exponential blow-up between the classical and pebble two-way machines...|$|R

5|$|The Ashford Ring Road was {{completed}} in November 1974 around the town centre {{in an attempt to}} relieve congestion, though part of it involved demolition of existing properties and part of the old market. It initially opened as one way, but was converted back into a two-way operation in 2007, at a total cost of £14m, so the town centre could expand and accommodate more people. <b>The</b> <b>two-way</b> route incorporates the first shared space scheme in the country. An art installation, Lost O, curated by the artist Michael Pinsky, was created as part of this redevelopment but confused drivers.|$|E

5|$|It {{was thought}} at the time that empty space was filled with a {{background}} medium called the luminiferous aether in which the electromagnetic field existed. Some physicists thought that this aether acted as a preferred frame of reference for the propagation of light and therefore {{it should be possible to}} measure the motion of the Earth with respect to this medium, by measuring the isotropy of the speed of light. Beginning in the 1880s several experiments were performed to try to detect this motion, the most famous of which is the experiment performed by Albert A. Michelson and Edward W. Morley in 1887. The detected motion was always less than the observational error. Modern experiments indicate that <b>the</b> <b>two-way</b> speed of light is isotropic (the same in every direction) to within 6 nanometres per second.|$|E

5|$|North of the river, {{the highway}} passes over NY5 before {{intersecting}} Albany Street {{just west of}} downtown Little Falls. Albany Street is the eastbound half of a one-way couplet with nearby Main Street; as a result, the two directions of NY167 split to follow different alignments through western Little Falls. From Overhead Street, northbound NY167 turns east to follow Albany Street for two blocks to Little Falls' commercial center, where it intersects with southbound NY169 at South Ann Street. NY169 turns east here to follow Albany Street while NY167 heads south along <b>the</b> <b>two-way</b> South Ann Street for one block to reach NY5, a four-lane divided highway on the north bank of the Mohawk River. At this point, NY167 northbound reconnects to the southbound route, which follows NY5 west from South Ann Street to NY5's junction with {{the west end of}} Albany Street.|$|E
5|$|The {{southern}} terminus of M-203 is at {{the west}} end of a pair of one-way streets carrying US41 through the City of Hancock at the bottom of Quincy Hill. Northbound US41 follows Quincy Street while southbound traffic is directed along Hancock Street. The two directions merge along Lincoln Drive, and M-203 is <b>the</b> <b>two-way,</b> western continuation of Quncy Street west of Lincoln Drive, passing north of the St. Joseph Cemetery. M-203 then runs along the north shore of the Portage Lake Canal turning northward and northwesterly along the canal. South of the canal's northern entry to Lake Superior, MDOT measured the annual average daily traffic (AADT) at 820vehicles in 2007.|$|E
5|$|Business Loop I-75 (BL I-75) is a {{business}} loop serving Pontiac and Auburn Hills. It uses portions of former Business M-24 (Bus. M-24) through town. The highway starts as an eight-lane freeway at an interchange on I-75 in Bloomfield Township. The freeway continues past an interchange with Opdyke Road to end at Square Lake Road, dropping to six lanes. BL I-75 continues to M-1 at Woodward Avenue. Square Lake Road continues to the west as Bus. US24, BL I-75 turns northwesterly along the eight-lane divided Woodward Avenue, running concurrently with Bus. US24 into downtown Pontiac. At {{the south side of}} downtown, Woodward drops to six lanes the two directions of Woodward Avenue split and form a four-lane loop. The Woodward Avenue Loop encircles downtown Pontiac, and it is crossed by the eastbound direction of M-59 running on Huron Street. One block north, the westbound direction of M-59 runs along University Drive and turns to follow BL I-75/Bus. US24 (Woodward Avenue Loop). The loop intersects Perry Street another block further north, and BL I-75 turns northeasterly onto <b>the</b> <b>two-way</b> Perry Street. BL I-75 passes through residential areas and a minor business area along the four-lane Perry Street. Outside of the downtown area, Perry Street widens to include a center turn lane. North of Walton Boulevard in Auburn Hills, the street name changes to Lapeer Road. BL I-75 intersects Opdyke Road a couple hundred feet west of I-75 before crossing the freeway. Lapeer Road continues as a six-lane, divided roadway to the ramps of a double trumpet interchange, where the BL I-75 designation ends. The roadway however, continues as M-24 providing access to the Palace of Auburn Hills. On average each day in 2013, 9,829vehicles use the business loop between the two M-59 junctions, and 73,795vehicles do so on the freeway stub east of Opdyke Road, the lowest and highest traffic counts.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, the {{individual}} secrecy of two-way wiretap channel is investigated, where two legitimate users' messages are separately guaranteed secure against an external eavesdropper. For one thing, in some communication scenarios, the joint secrecy {{is impossible to}} achieve both positive secrecy rates of two users. For another, {{the individual}} secrecy satisfies the secrecy demand of many practical communication systems. Thus, firstly, an achievable secrecy rate region is derived for <b>the</b> general <b>two-way</b> wiretap channel with individual secrecy. In a deterministic channel, the region with individual secrecy is shown to be larger than that with joint secrecy. Secondly, outer bounds on the secrecy capacity region are obtained for <b>the</b> general <b>two-way</b> wiretap channel and for two classes of special <b>two-way</b> wiretap channels. <b>The</b> gap between inner and outer bounds on the secrecy capacity region is explored via <b>the</b> binary input <b>two-way</b> wiretap channels and <b>the</b> degraded Gaussian <b>two-way</b> wiretap. Most notably, the secrecy capacity regions are established for the XOR channel and <b>the</b> degraded Gaussian <b>two-way</b> wiretap channel. Furthermore, the secure sum-rate of <b>the</b> degraded Gaussian <b>two-way</b> wiretap channel under the individual secrecy constraint is demonstrated to be strictly larger than that under the joint secrecy constraint...|$|R
