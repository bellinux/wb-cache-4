5|$|Although Richard sought {{peace with}} France, {{he took a}} {{different}} approach <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> in Ireland. The English lordships in Ireland {{were in danger of}} being overrun, and the Anglo-Irish lords were pleading for the king to intervene. In the autumn of 1394, Richard left for Ireland, where he remained until May 1395. His army of more than 8,000 men was the largest force brought to the island during the late Middle Ages. The invasion was a success, and a number of Irish chieftains submitted to English overlordship. It {{was one of the most}} successful achievements of Richard's reign, and strengthened the king's support at home, although the consolidation of the English position in Ireland proved to be short-lived.|$|E

5|$|Although many {{hypotheses}} {{have been}} put forward {{to explain how the}} ketogenic diet works, it remains a mystery. Disproven hypotheses include systemic acidosis (high levels of acid in the blood), electrolyte changes and hypoglycaemia (low blood glucose). Although many biochemical changes are known to occur in the brain of a patient on the ketogenic diet, it is not known which of these has an anticonvulsant effect. The lack of understanding in this area is similar <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> with many anticonvulsant drugs.|$|E
5|$|An ongoing {{question}} is whether RAD should {{be thought of as}} a disorder of the child's personality or a distortion of the relationship between the child and a specific other person. It has been noted that as attachment disorders are by their very nature relational disorders, they do not fit comfortably into noslogies that characterize the disorder as centered on the person. Work by C.H. Zeanah indicates that atypical attachment-related behaviors may occur with one caregiver but not with another. This is similar <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> reported for attachment styles, in which a particular parent's frightened expression has been considered as possibly responsible for disorganized/disoriented reunion behavior during the Strange Situation Procedure.|$|E
5|$|As {{he waited}} for the Emperor's {{confirmation}} of his directorship, Mahler shared duties as a resident conductor with Joseph Hellmesberger Jr. (son of the former conservatory director) and Hans Richter, an internationally renowned interpreter of Wagner and the conductor of the original Ring cycle at Bayreuth in 1876. Director Wilhelm Jahn had not consulted Richter about Mahler's appointment; Mahler, sensitive <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation,</b> wrote Richter a complimentary letter expressing unswerving admiration for the older conductor. Subsequently, the two were rarely in agreement, but kept their divisions private.|$|E

Fearing that the agent will alert the world to their existence, he initiates plans for a war economy and decides to question Silvia in her hospital room. Their dialogue reveals the story of his escape during the collapse of governments and the establishment of the microstate. He was damaged and in transport for repairs when the anarchist revolution began 200 years prior, allowing him to survive in hiding. Enraged by his calm indifference to the prospect of war, Silvia attacks him and attempts her escape, but is restrained by guards.|$|E
5|$|By {{the evening}} of 8 April, the Yugoslav Supreme Headquarters was under the mistaken {{impression}} that {{the situation in the}} 4th Army's area of operation was relatively good, believing the penetration of German troops had been temporarily halted. However, the effect of the rebellions and desertions within the 4th Army was significant within the flanking 2nd and 7th Armies, and contributed to further withdrawals. This was particularly marked {{in the area of the}} 7th Army, which was forced to withdraw from the Drava on the night of 8/9 April due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> in the 4th Army on its right flank, leading to the loss of Maribor.|$|E

Responding <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation,</b> the Congolese Minister of Defence presented a new defence reform master plan to the international community in February 2008. Essentially the three force tiers all had their readiness dates pushed back: the first, territorial forces, to 2008-2012, the mobile force to 2008-10, and the main defence force to 2015.|$|E

5000|$|Merton's {{concept of}} the self-fulfilling prophecy stems from the Thomas theorem, which states that [...] "If men define {{situations}} as real, they are real in their consequences".According to Thomas, people react not only <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>situations</b> they are in, but also, and often primarily, <b>to</b> <b>the</b> way they perceive <b>the</b> <b>situations</b> and <b>to</b> <b>the</b> meaning they assign to their perceptions.

Once people convince themselves that a situation really has a certain meaning, {{regardless of whether it}} actually does, they will take very real actions in consequence.|$|R

5|$|During the {{campaign}} Shelby's political enemies, notably Humphrey Marshall, criticized {{his response to}} Jefferson's second letter regarding the Genêt affair and questioned his loyalty to the United States.

5|$|In {{some ways}} the run-up to Plataea resembled that at the Battle of Marathon; there was a {{prolonged}} stalemate in which neither side risked attacking the other. The reasons for this stalemate were primarily tactical, and similar <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> at Marathon; the Greek hoplites {{did not want to}} risk being outflanked by the Persian cavalry and the lightly armed Persian infantry could not hope to assault well-defended positions.|$|E

Members of the Akodon varius group, with which Akodon oenos was formerly associated, tend to have much broader interorbital regions. The braincase is somewhat inflated and bears well-developed temporal and lambdoid crests relative <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> in A.caenosus; Akodon polopi has even better developed crests.|$|E

5|$|The F-4s {{and their}} crews, however, proved equal <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> and claimed seven MiG-21s destroyed, {{almost half of}} the 16 then in service with the VPAF without loss to USAF aircraft. Olds himself shot down one of the seven, for which he and the other aircrew were awarded Silver Stars. Follow-up interceptions over the next two days by MiGs against RF-4C {{reconnaissance}} aircraft led to a similar mission on a smaller scale on January 6, with another two MiG-21s shot down. VPAF fighter activity diminished to almost nothing for 10 weeks afterwards, thereby accomplishing the main goal of Operation Bolo: to eliminate or diminish the threat of MiGs to the strike formations.|$|E

With {{the assistance of the}} Soviet Union, the North Vietnamese had also quickly integrated an early warning radar system of more than 200 facilities which covered the entire country, tracking incoming U.S. raids, and then coordinating SAMs, anti-aircraft batteries, and MiGs to attack them. During 1967 U.S. losses totaled 248 aircraft (145 Air Force, 102 Navy, and one Marine Corps).|$|E
