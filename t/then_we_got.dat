500|$|The biggest {{trouble that}} we've had {{basically}} {{is that the}} song, [...] "Hold me Now" [...] was a huge hit, it was really big here, it was really big all over the world. Which is great, {{but it was just}} an accidental thing. It was just a song that we wrote. But after that <b>then,</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> everybody—managers, the record company—on our back to write [...] "Hold me Now, Part 2" [...] and harassing you to try and find a formula. But we can't really. We'll never find a formula for what we did. And that upsets some of them.|$|E
500|$|We {{were already}} in pre-production. We {{believed}} that it was just a formality, that Eminem just wanted to hear the final mix of the song... And <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> a phone call saying {{he was not going to}} give permission for a video. We were devastated [...] I certainly don't have any bad feelings toward Eminem. He was gracious enough to let us use the song on the album—and we use [...] "The Real Slim Shady" [...] in the [...] "Angry White Boy Polka" [...] medley, too. But this is the first album I've ever released without an accompanying video.|$|E
500|$|... 'You know what, I'm {{going to}} be freezing. I'm {{going to be}} miserable, I'll be {{complaining}} all day, I'll be sorry that I ever chose a cold place. So I said, 'Let's {{do it in the}} desert, it'll be warm,' and it would be sort of the opposite, because even though you think of deserts as being hot, they're still sort of frozen in terms of there's no vegetation and they're very desolate. I thought that that would still work as a visual, but <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> there and it was like 20 degrees below zero, it was bitterly cold, and I was barefoot. I was barefoot for the entire video, and then it started pouring rain and everyone got really sick, and it just actually {{turned out to be a}} really miserable experience.|$|E
6000|$|... "Was that a tree went down?" [...] asked Randolph Rover, and Cujo nodded. [...] "It {{is a good}} thing, <b>then,</b> that <b>we</b> <b>got</b> out of the forest." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, <b>then,</b> <b>we</b> have <b>got</b> {{to fight}} it, Master Cyril, {{and we will}} beat it {{if it is to}} be beaten. Now, lad, for the hot blanket." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Here, <b>then,</b> <b>we</b> have <b>got</b> home at last," [...] said Karlsefin, as they rowed {{over the}} still {{water to a}} spit, or natural landing-place, near Leif's old booths.|$|R
500|$|On May 9, 2007, {{during a}} show in Fort Worth, Texas Chevelle's trailer {{containing}} all of the band's equipment was stolen from the hotel at which the members were staying. The band posted a notice saying, [...] "Most items are labeled 'Chevelle' and if you notice anything suspicious on eBay or other online resellers selling 'authentic' Chevelle items... guitar, basses, drums, amplifiers, risers, backdrops, tee shirts... please call the police..." [...] A month later in an interview, Sam Loeffler stated, [...] "Of the 14 guitars, we got two of 'em, and <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> some amplifiers back and our monitor system. So it's really, I mean it's cool because it's kind of like Christmas, only really weird. People have been calling us and saying, 'Hey, I bought this or that', and you know, we're just doing our best to buy it back from them. And certainly {{the issue is not}} a money issue, it's about having the pieces of gear that you did all your records with." ...|$|E
500|$|Slayer {{began writing}} lyrics {{for a new}} album prior to their {{appearance}} at the 1999 Ozzfest. However, every {{three to four months}} the band was distracted by commitments to Ozzfest, and worldwide [...] "Tattoo the Earth" [...] tour with Slipknot. Guitarist Jeff Hanneman later admitted [...] "that was the last break. <b>Then</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> our shit together." [...] The band's longtime producer, Rick Rubin, was too busy to work with Slayer, and felt [...] "burned out"—unable to create intense music. Araya and King had similar feelings about Rubin, and King remarked he [...] "wanted to work with someone into the heavy-music scene, and Rubin's not anymore. I wanted somebody who knows what's hot, knows what's selling, knows the new techniques, and will keep me on my toes." [...] Rubin recommended two producers, although the first producer was not going to work out personality-wise according to Hanneman. The band gave second candidate, Matt Hyde, a trial on the song [...] "Bloodline", which appeared in the movie Dracula 2000. The band was pleased with Hyde's work on [...] "Bloodline" [...] and hired him to produce the entire album. [...] "Bloodline" [...] was also briefly used in the 2009 film Law Abiding Citizen. The song [...] "Here Comes the Pain" [...] had originally been recorded almost two years prior to the release of God Hates Us All, appearing on the compilation album [...] in 1999, and then used as the opening theme for WCW Thunder from February 16, 2000 to the final episode on March 21, 2001.|$|E
500|$|Further {{changes were}} made after the March 2007 preview {{screenings}} of the film in Portland, Oregon and Phoenix, Arizona. This included the deletion of Kang and Kodos heavily criticizing the film during the end credits. A lot {{of people at the}} screenings found the original film too coarse, and some of Homer's behavior too unkind, so several scenes were toned down to make him appear nicer. Russ Cargill was redesigned several times, originally appearing as an older man whose speech patterns Albert Brooks based on Donald Rumsfeld. The older model was the one used by Burger King for the action figure. Cargill's scene with Bart and Homer at the film's conclusion was added in to fully resolve his story, and the [...] "Spider-Pig" [...] gag was also a late addition. One excised scene, before the dome is put over Springfield, had Mr. Burns reminding viewers that it was the last point in the film that they could get a refund. Other deletions included Homer's encounter with a sausage truck driver, which was featured on the DVD, a scene with Plopper the pig at the end, and a news report, showing the dome's effect on daily life in Springfield in areas such as farming and sport, was cut because it did not fit the overall context of the film. Several musical numbers, at various intervals throughout the film, were cut. These included a song about Alaska, featuring music by Dave Stewart of Eurythmics. Jean said it [...] "got pretty far along in the animation, and <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> scared that the movie began to drag in that section." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Uncle George {{said that}} it was an {{excellent}} plan to go there, for <b>then,</b> if <b>we</b> <b>got</b> tired of the canal boat in going, we could come home by a railroad train.|$|R
5000|$|... "I {{ended up}} {{recording}} {{little bits of}} the song for her as YouTube links and <b>then</b> <b>we</b> just shared them {{back and forth and}} <b>then</b> when <b>we</b> <b>got</b> together she had translated them," [...] says Cardiff. [...] "It was pretty sweet. She’s a very lovely person and I feel lucky that that happened." ...|$|R
60|$|And by {{this time}} we had reached the gigs. The doctor, with the pick-axe, {{demolished}} one of them, and <b>then</b> <b>we</b> all <b>got</b> aboard the other {{and set out to}} go round by sea for North Inlet.|$|R
2500|$|... "The sun turned {{black in}} the middle of the battle; we could still see it over us, or should have thought we had been {{fighting}} till evening. <b>Then</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> into the camp, and there was a great deal of smoke and firing. Afterwards the sun came out bright again." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "we did 'Fragments of a Faith Forgotten' on {{a little}} four track, we did it in two afternoons just threw it down. We didn't think much about it but off that we got a deal with Noise, two pages in Kerrang! and a Radio One session. It just snowballed. After the session the label were even more {{interested}} and <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> the Kerrang! cover after that." ...|$|E
2500|$|......<b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> married, {{lived in}} the unit (in Ramsgate) for a while, and had a baby. We {{moved to a new}} house {{a quarter of a mile}} away. It cost me heaps. I had a {{mortgage}} I couldn't possibly afford. I remember for over a year we had a gross income of $9,000 and I was paying $4,500 on the mortgage. That was hard, very hard. We were really struggling.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Arnold R. Fesser, oiler, 17 {{years at}} sea: [...] "We {{got a big}} job to do until this war is won. We will keep them sailing until the end. <b>Then</b> <b>we</b> have <b>got</b> time for holidays." [...] October 14, 1944.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not come here," [...] Luka said decidedly, [...] "we keep {{plenty of}} big fire. All beasts afraid of fire. <b>Then</b> <b>we</b> have <b>got</b> dogs and guns. Much easier for wolves to attack elk; {{but even that}} they seldom do unless it is wounded or has injured itself." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>then</b> <b>got</b> {{the clock}} upstairs {{and put it}} together, and I fixed it {{in the corner of}} the dining-room.|$|R
2500|$|No, we're {{all done}} with that [...] now, all the old material. We didn't {{actually}} {{want to do the}} Greatest Hits, we were ready to start our new record—until the record company pointed out that it was in the contract. But <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> into it, and tried to be creative with it as much as [...] And, you know, we ended up being really proud of it. You have to have a different brain when you're doing a record like that. It's more about [...] "this is your achievement"; I could hold in one hand all the records we've released, so that was cool. We're moving on now, and getting on with the new record.|$|E
2500|$|Gymnastics {{came of age}} in India when, at the 2010 Commonwealth Games, Ashish Kumar won {{the first-ever}} medal in {{gymnastics}} for India and also won a bronze medal. However, soon after the win, the president of the Gymnastics Federation of India, controversially asked Kumar's chief coach from the Soviet Union, Vladimir Chertkov, [...] "Is this all that you can deliver, a bronze?" [...] The comment was widely reported in the press. Later, the coach revealed that, [...] "In August 2009, we had no equipment. Ashish trained on hard floor till February 2010, and <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> equipment around 20 years old." [...] The federation announced that no Indian team would travel to Rotterdam for the World Championships in October, which would mean that Indian gymnasts would not have the opportunity to qualify as a team for the 2012 Summer Olympics.|$|E
2500|$|In June 2011, {{the band}} moved to Marfa, Texas to begin {{recording}} their fourth studio album, with bassist and multi-instrumentalist Chris Taylor {{returning to his}} role as producer. Droste noted, [...] "We had passed through before {{and there is a}} great arts collective and vibe. We decided to rent a place and make our next album there." [...] The band recorded [...] "an album's worth of material" [...] in Marfa, but ultimately abandoned the majority of tracks. Vocalist Ed Droste noted, [...] "We were like, 'We're ready to do this!' <b>Then,</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> there and recorded twelve songs and were like, 'This isn't quite there.'" [...] Vocalist and guitarist Daniel Rossen elaborated, [...] "We didn't have that unspoken momentum, that unspoken understanding of what everyone is into." [...] Only two songs from these sessions made it onto the finished album; [...] "Sleeping Ute" [...] and [...] "Yet Again".|$|E
6000|$|... "Not yet," [...] Skinner laughed. [...] "If {{we played}} at all {{we should have}} to use a cannon-ball, so that it should not be kicked over the sides; but <b>then,</b> unless <b>we</b> <b>got</b> iron shoes made for the purpose, we should all be laid up. But I have got a {{football}} in my cabin, and once or twice we have had games at Suakim, and very good fun it was too." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Colonel Roosevelt--he {{was only}} Lieutenant-Colonel then--had six troops under him, {{and he did}} all he could to make the boys comfortable. But the cars were crowded, and {{travelling}} was so slow it took us four days to reach Tampa. <b>Then</b> when <b>we</b> <b>got</b> there, <b>we</b> found everything in confusion. The railroad yard was chock-a-block with freight and passenger cars, and nobody was there to tell us where to go or where to find provisions.|$|R
6000|$|... "Most {{certainly}} I do. They {{say everything}} {{will go up}} to such prices as never were heard of before. Of course, {{in a month or}} two the country will come to our rescue and destroy the Prussians, but till <b>then</b> <b>we</b> have <b>got</b> to live. Already eggs are fetching four times as much as they did last week. It is frightful to think of it, is it not, monsieur?" ...|$|R
2500|$|Breault and I {{separated}} {{to pound}} {{on each of}} the boat’s sides. In this way, the rescuers would know that there were two of us. Breault played a kind of tune with his hammer, indicating to the diver that we were in good shape and cheerful. Neither of us knew Morse Code. We [...] had no food or water, and only a flashlight. We were confident we could stay alive for forty-eight hours. The high pressure and foul air gave us severe headaches. We did very little moving or talking; it excited our hearts too much. We heard scraping on the hull for hours. A couple of times we felt the O-5 being lifted, and <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> tossed roughly when the slings broke. We knew they were hard after us. This buoyed our hopes [...] for rescue tremendously. Finally, the sub began to be tilted upward slowly. We felt we would escape this time, but it seemed like forever. The last 20 minutes were unbearable. We heard our comrades walking on deck. Breault opened the hatch and we could see daylight. [...] We were saved!!! ...|$|E
2500|$|Captain Brooke's plan, after {{casting off}} the Jolly Bachelor, {{would be to}} ram the prahus while keeping them engaged so as to prevent the pirates from {{boarding}} and overwhelming the Sarawakians. McDougall wrote; [...] "Our plan of action was to silence the brass guns with our rifles, to shake them at their oars with grape and round shot, until we could run into them without their being strong enough to board us. The steamer was kept dodging about within range until {{the time came to}} run in; <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> into a good position to put on all steam and given them the stem, which was always admirably and coolly done by Captain Hewat whenever the order was given by the Rajah Mudah." [...] After the first prahu got away the attention was turned to the second boat which was sailing for the shore and when the Rainbow was 200 yards away the Sulus opened fire with all of their guns. For the next few minutes Brooke chased the prahu at full speed before running right over it and sinking her. The Sarawakians called out to the survivors to hang onto the wreckage and wait for rescue, they then went after the third prahu but the Rainbow ran aground in less than two fathoms of water.|$|E
2500|$|Newly crowned {{champion}} di Grassi said of {{his title}} success, [...] "This journey, this day started {{three years ago when}} we started season one, and <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> a lot of good results. I arrived in London fighting for the championship, even though I got disqualified from winning a race. Season two, the same situation, even got disqualified from winning a race. Finally I came here as an underdog, 10 points behind and had the nerves to keep calm, I did the job yesterday and today managed to win it also. I’m so happy for my team, so happy for the ABT Schaeffler Audi Sport guys, they really deserve it." [...] He later claimed to have not given up hope in winning the championship despite a competitive field and retiring from the Paris ePrix, but also admitted that focusing on Formula E after Audi's withdrawal from the World Endurance Championship at the end of 2016 aided his title effort. While Buemi admitted his disappointment in losing the championship, he congratulated di Grassi on securing the accolade, and stated him missing the New York City races was not an excuse in his loss. Regarding his pit stop early in the race, Buemi chose not to judge if the stewards made the correct decision and admitted not knowing about the regulation that required him to enter the pit lane because of car damage.|$|E
6000|$|... "I did--several times. But he wouldn't {{listen to}} me. Of course, I didn't want to act rude, and when I {{told him to}} turn back he only laughed at me. <b>Then,</b> when <b>we</b> <b>got</b> to Dennville, and I told him that I {{positively}} would not go any farther, he said, 'Oh, yes, you will. We {{are going to have}} a good, long ride. I am going to make you pay up in full for not riding with me before.'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{left the}} brig last night, got ashore on the Beaupre side, {{arranged}} for this canoe, and lay dark all day. <b>Then</b> to-night <b>we</b> <b>got</b> alongside and I roused you easily, for I knew where you slept. The friar nearly spoiled all {{when you were}} below, but we gagged him and passed him over the side. Ephraim popped on his gown {{so that he might}} go forward to help you without danger, for we were scared at the delay." ...|$|R
50|$|If {{we make a}} {{comparison}} of these four orders of the mass, A and B seem to have most in common. If this can {{be taken as a}} further indication that B gives the substance of the rite of Nidaros in the 13th century, <b>then</b> <b>we</b> have <b>got</b> a basis from which to determine the most important alterations in the rite of this see in the last 250 years before the Reformation.|$|R
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> {{to talking}} about my brother Samuel, {{and he told me}} my {{explanations}} were confusing.|$|E
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> up--he with {{a scarlet}} face, furious at being baulked; {{but he was}} a true sportsman, and without one word went back to his seat at the table.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{think the}} manifests were sent, but now and <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> cargo {{at the last}} moment as we were going to sea. Besides, the officer was a friend of ours----" ...|$|E
6000|$|When breakfast {{was ready}} we lolled {{on the grass}} and eat it smoking hot. Jim laid it in with all his might, for he was most about starved. <b>Then</b> when <b>we</b> had <b>got</b> pretty well stuffed, we laid off and lazied. By and by Jim says: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, {{that is true}} enough," [...] Edgar agreed; [...] "but <b>then</b> <b>we</b> have <b>got</b> discipline. The {{order is}} given, and the whole {{regiment}} goes off together; one could not hold back if one would. But that is a different thing from rushing forward each man on his own account, as they did against us, and running up to what seemed certain death. I know the feeling among our fellows was {{that they would not}} have believed it had they not seen it." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>we</b> all <b>got</b> mad. <b>We</b> {{took that}} tin {{out on the}} bank, and Harris went up into a field and got a big sharp stone, and I {{went back into the}} boat and brought out the mast, and George held the tin and Harris held the sharp end of his stone against the top of it, and I took the mast and poised it high up in the air, and {{gathered}} up all my strength and brought it down.|$|R
