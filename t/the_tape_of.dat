5|$|During {{a routine}} liposuction {{operation}} in Winnetka, Illinois, Dr. Harrison Lloyd (John Juliani) suddenly begins to remove so much fat {{from a patient}} that the patient dies. Following the unusual experience, Lloyd tells Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) that he killed the patient because he was possessed. Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) is skeptical about Lloyd's claims, believing he's only making it up to escape legal consequences. Mulder inspects the operation room and discovers a pentagram burned into the floor; he begins to suspect that witchcraft might have {{played a part in}} the crime. Meanwhile, the staff at Lloyd's clinic are shocked when another plastic surgeon, Dr. Ilaqua (Paul Raskin), murders an elderly patient by burning a hole through her cheek and neck with a surgical laser, severing her brain stem. Scully interviews Ilaqua, who claims that he cannot remember anything of the incident. Mulder's suspicions are strengthened when he reviews <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> <b>of</b> the second murder, and he sees a pentagram-like pattern on the stomach of the victim.|$|E
5|$|Member of parliament, Inge Myrvoll, and {{president}} of the Norwegian Airline Pilots Association, Cpt.Peter Helland, both stated that the Accident Investigation Board should make a new inquiry about the accident. Cpt. Helland stated that the report's credibility was weakened due to the influence de Havilland Canada had during the process. On 10 June, the commission reopened the case, after having held meetings with Tyrer. The commission stated that there was disagreement as to if the tail rudder and tail plane or the end piece had cracked first, which would be crucial in determining the cause of the accident. Among the inquiries would be to re-investigate <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> <b>of</b> cockpit sound with new technology. The Accident Investigation Board used the National Aerospace Laboratory in the Netherlands to conduct tests on the end pieces. The report from the National Aerospace Laboratory was published on 23 March 1995, and supported the conclusion in the commissions report. The journalist Oddvar Kristoffersen in Fremover won the SKUP Award for 1994 for his work related to uncovering the controversy. The pilots' union in Widerøe was initially critical of the report, but by July it stated that it supported the conclusion. In addition, Det Norske Veritas withdrew its critical comments concerning the commission. With this, all officially involved parties supported the report.|$|E

Then again and again, until I had viewed it 25 times. And still I could not believe what I was looking at. To see my officers engage {{in what appeared to}} be excessive use of force, possibly criminally excessive, to see them beat a man with their batons 56 times, to see a sergeant on the scene who did nothing to seize control, was something I never dreamed I would witness.|$|E
25|$|Statements {{described}} Murray {{as someone}} using a non-standard CPR technique on Jackson. During <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> <b>of</b> the emergency call, released on June 26 {{one day after}} Jackson's death, the doctor was described as administering CPR on a bed, not on a hard surface such as a floor, which would be standard practice. The doctor's attorney said that Murray placed one hand underneath Jackson and used the other hand for chest compression, where the standard practice is to use both hands for compression. A Los Angeles Fire Department (LAFD) spokesperson said the 911 call came in at 12:21:04p.m. PDT (19:21:04UTC). Paramedics reached Jackson at 12:26p.m. and found that he still was not breathing.|$|E
25|$|By 1979 Leroy Brown {{began working}} in San Francisco for NWA Hollywood. Brown {{teamed up with}} Allen Coage and {{together}} they defeated Los Guerreros (Héctor and Mando Guerrero) to win the NWA Americas Tag Team Championship. They would later lose the belts to Mando Guerrero and Carlos Mata. Working for NWA Hollywood also allowed Brown to travel to Japan, touring with New Japan Pro Wrestling (NJPW). During the tour he challenged Seiji Sakaguchi for the NWF North American Heavyweight Championship in July 1979 but Sakaguchi retained the title by disqualification. In his book Animal, George Steele describes Brown's problems in Japan, including how during a match a Japanese wrestler was trying to break a bottle over Brown's head but had not prepared it properly and it took several hard blows to break the bottle. The following day several Japanese wrestlers would watch <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> <b>of</b> the match over and over again, laughing at Brown's misfortune and pain. Back in San Francisco Brown defeated Chavo Guerrero to win the WWA Americas Heavyweight Championship, holding it for 50 days before losing it to Al Madril. In late 1979 Brown returned to the eastern coast, competing for Championship Wrestling from Florida. Initially he became involved in a feud with then NWA Florida Heavyweight Champion, Manny Fernandez facing him on several occasions during January. After that {{he moved on to}} facing Sweet Brown Sugar, whom he defeated to win the NWA Southern Heavyweight Championship. He would later lose it to Dusty Rhodes on February 16, 1980 Jacksonville, Florida. By late 1980 Brown ended up working for Bill Watts' Mid-South Wrestling, teaming with Ernie Ladd for {{most of his time in}} Mid-South. The two defeated Junkyard Dog and Terry Orndorff to win the Mid-South Tag Team Championship. They later trade the championship with Junkyard Dog and other partners such as Killer Karl Kox and Dick Murdoch.|$|E

Simon Conway Morris disputes this conclusion, arguing that convergence is a dominant force in evolution, and given that the same environmental and physical constraints are at work, life will inevitably evolve toward an [...] "optimum" [...] body plan, and at some point, evolution is bound to stumble upon intelligence, a trait presently identified with at least primates, corvids, and cetaceans.|$|E

[...] To further his argument, Bremer plays back <b>the</b> <b>tape</b> <b>of</b> Mulder and Scully. [...] The militia group turns against Haley. [...] Bremer offers Haley a set of car keys and tells him he can leave the group unharmed. Haley agrees and drives off. Bremer, along with a thug from the group, marches Mulder into a desolate area and prepares to execute him. However, Bremer instead kills the thug and tells Mulder to run, lest they both be discovered.|$|E

After the match Carlos stated that he felt the reason Hughes fell to the mat was because he was rendered unconscious from the triangle choke.

500|$|At 8:30, Goodman {{issued a}} {{statement}} apologizing for the incident, and stating that he had missed {{the ending of the}} game [...] "as much as anybody". He stated that it was [...] "a forgivable error committed by humans who were concerned about children expecting to see Heidi". The following morning, Cline was called into a meeting with his bosses. He was told that if he had done anything other than what he did, NBC would have been at the mercy of Timex and Cline would have been fired. The network turned the fiasco into an advantage by subsequent self-mockery, promoting the following week's Jets game telecast with an advertisement showing Namath with Heidi on his shoulders, and running another ad with testimonials about Heidi, the last: [...] "I didn't {{get a chance to see}} it, but I hear it was great", signed by Namath. Other networks joined in: on the CBS Evening News the following Monday night (November 18), Harry Reasoner announced the [...] "result" [...] of the game: [...] "Heidi married the goat-herder".
