40|$|Roundabouts {{have become}} {{increasingly}} popular {{in recent years as}} an innovative operational and safety solution at both low volume and high volume intersections. This paper contains capacity analysis of existing roads at a busy intersection in Dhaka named Polashi intersection, compare capacity and volume, AADT, velocity study, road user behavior, pedestrian flow analysis for proposed roundabout. Evaluations are made on a rational basis using qualitative analysis wherever possible and accepting that some matters determine by the exercise of judgments. Roundabouts have a number of advantages over traffic signals depending on the conditions. They reduce the severity of crashes since head-on and right-angle conflicts are nearly eliminated. They may consume less land area since <b>turn</b> <b>pocket</b> lanes are not needed. They have lower energy and maintenance cost...|$|E
40|$|Roundabouts are an {{increasingly}} popular alternative to traffic signals for intersection {{control in the}} United States. Roundabouts {{have a number of}} advantages over traffic signals depending on the conditions. They reduce the severity of crashes since head-on and right-angle conflicts are nearly eliminated. They reduce through traffic speeds to provide a “calmer ” roadway environment. They may consume less land area since <b>turn</b> <b>pocket</b> lanes are not needed and also have lower energy and maintenance costs. This study analyzed capacity and performance of Suame roundabout in Kumasi, Ghana. Traffic and geometric data were collected on the field. The analysis revealed that Suame roundabout was operating at a level of service F, which represented worst conditions. Signalized intersection with 5 approach lanes was proposed to control all the movements. Exclusive pedestrian phases were proposed to protect pedestrians...|$|E

50|$|In the Pocket Universe (which was an {{alternate}} {{version of the}} pre-Crisis Earth-One), Quex-Ul was freed with General Zod and Zaora from the Phantom Zone by a naive Lex Luthor, whereupon they <b>turned</b> <b>Pocket</b> Earth into a dead world. Quex-Ul {{and the others were}} executed by Superman using green kryptonite, a controversial move that haunted him for some time.|$|R

50|$|An {{upcoming}} project, {{adding a}} loop ramp onto the I-5 interchange, started in March 2009 and {{will end in}} 2011. WSDOT has awarded the contract for the project to Northwest Construction, Inc. Part of the project includes widening the main entry point to Lakewood Crossing, by adding <b>turn</b> <b>pockets.</b> Widening SR 531 between 43rd Avenue NE and 67th Avenue NE from its current two to five lanes near the Arlington Airport is another planned project. The project is currently in planning stages and WSDOT {{has set up a}} webpage for the project.|$|R

50|$|Starting in the 1950s, Copenhagen {{experienced}} {{a decline in}} utility cycling due to increasing wealth and affordability of motor vehicles. While no bike paths were actually removed at the time, new road construction omitted bicycle infrastructure, and many bike lanes were curtailed at intersections to increase the throughput of cars by adding <b>turn</b> <b>pockets</b> and other car related infrastructure in its place. At the same time car traffic increased dramatically on existing streets without bicycle infrastructure, decreasing the cyclists sense of safety on those streets. During the late 60s and early 70s the modal share of bicycles fell to an all-time low of 10%.|$|R

60|$|The man <b>turned</b> his <b>pockets</b> out {{upon the}} grass, and counted, besides some foreign coins and two rings, five-and-forty guineas in gold.

5000|$|Routing {{and design}} of vacuum tubing layout {{is very similar to}} drain-waste-vent (DWV) plumbing, with the {{exception}} that pipe pitch or gradient for drainage is not required. Vacuum system designs share with DWV designs a concern about eliminating internal roughness, ridges, burrs, sharp <b>turns,</b> <b>pockets,</b> or other obstructions to smooth flow that might cause build-up of material into pipe blockages. Tubing for central vacuums has a few peculiar constraints of its own, and a few unusual capabilities, such as the ability to run a pipe straight upwards after a sufficiently long horizontal [...] "running start". In some jurisdictions, fire code regulations require that an intumescent firestop collar be installed around the pipe when it penetrates a firewall. If a pipe runs through an unheated space, it may require external pipe insulation to prevent water vapor from condensing inside. These and other installation details are described in installation manuals available from manufacturers.|$|R

60|$|In a word, I {{found that}} the muse had played me another of her tricks, and had betrayed me {{into the hands of}} a footpad.
