5|$|Honora Sneyd {{was soon}} pregnant, {{giving birth to}} her {{daughter}} Honora on 30 May 1774, who {{died at the age}} of sixteen. Her second child, Lovell, who inherited the property, was born the following year on 30 June 1775. The Edgeworth children were raised according to the system of Rousseau, as refined and modified by the Edgeworths. Richard Edgeworth considered his early educational efforts a failure, <b>the</b> <b>older</b> <b>children</b> from his first marriage growing up unruly and then being sent away to school, and readily concurred with his new wife's stricter rules. However he had seen very little of them in their early years.|$|E
5|$|In 1861, Parry married Jane Thomas. She was the {{daughter}} of Welsh immigrants and the sister of Gomer Thomas, who published many of Parry's early compositions. The couple had three sons and two daughters. <b>The</b> <b>older</b> <b>children</b> were born when the family was still living in Danville; only Parry's youngest child was born in Wales. Two of Parry's three sons died after the family moved to Penarth. Parry's youngest son, William, died in 1892; his oldest son, Joseph Haydn, died two years later. While all of Parry's children are said to have had musical talent, his eldest, Joseph Haydn, followed in his father's footsteps as a composer and teacher.|$|E
5|$|That summer, Victoria and Albert spent a rainy {{holiday in}} the west of Scotland at Loch Laggan, but heard from their doctor, Sir James Clark, that his son had enjoyed dry, sunny days farther east at Balmoral Castle. The tenant of Balmoral, Sir Robert Gordon, died {{suddenly}} in early October, and Albert began negotiations {{to take over the}} lease from the owner, the Earl Fife. In May the following year, Albert leased Balmoral, which he had never visited, and in September 1848 he, his wife and <b>the</b> <b>older</b> <b>children</b> went there for the first time. They came to relish the privacy it afforded.|$|E
25|$|Typically, if <b>the</b> <b>oldest</b> in <b>the</b> family died, <b>the</b> next <b>oldest</b> is not {{required}} to fast. However, if <b>the</b> <b>oldest</b> <b>child</b> had died within 30 days of birth, <b>the</b> next <b>oldest</b> is required to fast. (The Dagul Mervavah maintains that this only applies if <b>the</b> <b>oldest</b> <b>child</b> had been born prematurely or was not born viable).|$|R

Street children, especially <b>the</b> <b>older</b> <b>children,</b> are also sometimes engaged in activities such as stealing, pick-pocketing, drug-peddling, and prostitution, though {{this is a small}} proportion. Most of the street children work 8–10 hours total each day in their various economic activities.|$|E
25|$|Hinrich {{was born}} to Jim and Nancy Hinrich of Sioux City, Iowa. His father had played college {{basketball}} at Briar Cliff College and later became a coach for Sioux City West High School. When Hinrich was about seven years old, Jim Hinrich visited Ray Nacke, his old college coach, and asked if Kirk could enroll in Nacke's summer camp for fourth, fifth, and sixth graders. Despite Nacke's hesitations, Hinrich was allowed to attend the camp, and played well against <b>the</b> <b>older</b> <b>children.</b> After just two years, Hinrich advanced to Nacke's camp for young teenagers, and excelled there, as well.|$|E
25|$|Anne {{was barely}} {{a year old}} when her mother became ill of what is {{believed}} to have been uterine cancer. Maria Branwell died on 15 September 1821. In order to provide a mother for his children, Patrick tried to remarry, but without success. Maria's sister, Elizabeth Branwell (1776–1842), moved to the parsonage, initially to nurse her dying sister, but she spent the rest of her life there raising the children. She did it from a sense of duty, but she was a stern woman who expected respect, rather than love. There was little affection between her and <b>the</b> <b>older</b> <b>children,</b> but Anne, according to tradition, was her favourite.|$|E

25|$|Jones {{was born}} in Auckland, New Zealand, {{and grew up in}} Te Atatu South, a suburb in the west of Auckland, {{attending}} Edmonton Primary, Rangeview Intermediate and Henderson High School. His talent for playing was discovered early, as a 10-year-old tackling 15- to 18-year-olds at the weekend kick-abouts at the primary school. He played for the primary school team when still in standard one, when he was three years younger than many of <b>the</b> <b>older</b> <b>children</b> {{and by the time he}} attended Henderson High School, he was already well-known locally. He then helped turn a mediocre high school first XV into a successful rugby team that could compete with Auckland Grammar and Kelston Boys High (the regional heavyweights) for the first time. He played for the local Waitemata Rugby Club and it wasn't long before the Auckland representative team (coached by John Hart) took notice.|$|E

In 1952, three years after David was born, {{the family moved to}} southwest suburban Evergreen Park, Illinois; Ted transferred to Evergreen Park Central School. After testing scored his IQ at 167 he skipped the sixth grade. Kaczynski later described this as a pivotal event: previously he had socialized with his peers and was even a leader, but after skipping ahead he felt he did not fit in with <b>the</b> <b>older</b> <b>children</b> and was bullied.|$|E
500|$|Although Kelly {{was raised}} as a Roman Catholic, he later {{described}} himself as a non-believer in any religion. He is the great great grandson of Jeremiah Kelly, who emigrated from Ireland in 1852 and settled in Clare, South Australia. His paternal grandfather, Francis Kelly, established a law firm in 1917, which his father, John, joined in 1937. John Kelly died in 1968 at the age of 52, after being diagnosed with Parkinson's disease three years earlier. Paul Kelly was thirteen years old when his father died. Kelly described his father: [...] "I have good memories, {{he was the kind of}} father that, well, I missed him when he died very much. <b>The</b> <b>older</b> <b>children</b> were growing into him at the time he died. He was not well enough to play sport with me".|$|E

500|$|Through this {{marriage}} Sneyd became step-mother to Edgeworth's four surviving children {{by his first}} wife, Anna Maria, ranging from seven months to nine years in age; Richard, Maria, who became a writer in her own right, Emmeline and Anna Maria. On encountering her new family she observed that Maria, then aged five, was exhibiting behavioural problems, and expressed her views that speedy and consistent punishment were the keys to ensuring good behaviour in children, a view she proceeded to practice. However she believed that such discipline needed to be imposed [...] "before the age of 5 or 6", and was therefore rather late {{in the case of}} <b>the</b> <b>older</b> <b>children,</b> however she imposed a strict discipline. Following a period of ill health on Sneyd's part, Maria Edgeworth was sent away to boarding school in Derby (1775–1781), and later London upon the death of Honora Sneyd (1781–1782). Similarly, her older brother Richard was sent to Charterhouse (1776–1778) and then went to sea, and she never saw him again. Later Richard Edgeworth would comment on how difficult the first two years were for Sneyd in her new role as stepmother to undisciplined children, a role her relatives had advised her against.|$|E

2500|$|After Kristallnacht, the United Kingdom {{agreed to}} accept 10,000 German {{children}} in Kindertransports and Bunce Court took {{in as many}} of the refugees as possible. As Hitler invaded and annexed other countries, children began to come from Austria, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Hungary. With an enrolment of uprooted children whose parents were in unknown circumstances, coming from different social classes and cultures, Essinger sometimes found it difficult to find British teachers who were up to the challenges and needs of the pupils. Some children were [...] "almost ill with homesickness and <b>the</b> <b>older</b> <b>children</b> anxious for parents, brothers and sisters left in Germany.

[...] Ultimately, many of the pupils never saw their parents again.|$|E
2500|$|While {{there remains}} a general gap in the {{literature}} regarding the production of facial expressions and the processes which underlie this production at middle childhood and adolescence ages, research has been done to assess the overall production capabilities of children ranging in ages 5–13. Results generally indicate that the ability to produce facial emotion increases with age and is slightly correlated with the ability to discriminate the facial expressions of another. Odom and Lemond (1972) created a study to test the potential for [...] "a developmental lag between the perception and production of facial expressions," [...] meaning they were looking to uncover a relationship between previously created schemas and mental representations of different expressions and the ability to transform these representations into facial expression. They operated using the logical assumption that coding perceptions of expressions comes before the discrimination of expressions which then precedes production. Upon assessing two differing age groups, one in kindergarten and the other in fifth grade, they discovered that there is a lag between perception and production of facial expressions, however this lag does not decrease with age. Production and discrimination do not develop at the same rate. [...] Odom and Lemond (1972) have arrived at the far conclusion that production of facial expressions will never be at the same level of discrimination of facial expressions, which supports the findings of another study by Izard (1971) who found that even adults have difficulty producing requested expressions. Despite this, the increased accurate productions of the older kids was found to be due to their discrimination abilities yet <b>the</b> <b>older</b> <b>children</b> still made many errors leading researchers to believe that full discrimination abilities are not at full potential at the middle childhood and adolescence stage of development.|$|E
