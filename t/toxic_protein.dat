5|$|A toxin-antitoxin {{system is}} a set of two or more closely linked genes that {{together}} encode both a protein 'poison' and a corresponding 'antidote'. When these systems are contained on plasmids– transferable genetic elements– they ensure that only the daughter cells that inherit the plasmid survive after cell division. If the plasmid is absent in a daughter cell, the unstable antitoxin is degraded and the stable <b>toxic</b> <b>protein</b> kills the new cell; this is known as 'post-segregational killing' (PSK). Toxin-antitoxin systems are widely distributed in prokaryotes, and organisms often have them in multiple copies.|$|E
5|$|Ensuring a plasmid accepts {{an insert}} {{is a common}} problem of DNA cloning. Toxin-antitoxin systems {{can be used to}} {{positively}} select for only those cells that have taken up a plasmid containing the inserted gene of interest, screening out those that lack the inserted gene. An example of this application comes from CcdB-encoded toxin, which has been incorporated into plasmid vectors. The gene of interest is then targeted to recombine into the CcdB locus, inactivating the transcription of the <b>toxic</b> <b>protein.</b> Thus, cells containing the plasmid but not the insert perish due to the toxic effects of CcdB protein, and only those that incorporate the insert survive.|$|E
5|$|Type III toxin-antitoxin systems rely {{on direct}} {{interaction}} between a <b>toxic</b> <b>protein</b> and an RNA antitoxin. The toxic {{effects of the}} protein are neutralised by the RNA gene. One example is the ToxIN system from the bacterial plant pathogen Erwinia carotovora. The toxic ToxN protein is approximately 170 amino acids long and {{has been shown to}} be toxic to E. coli. The toxic activity of ToxN is inhibited by ToxI RNA, an RNA with 5.5 direct repeats of a 36 nucleotide motif (AGGTGATTTGCTACCTTTAAGTGCAGCTAGAAATTC). Crystallographic analysis of ToxIN has found that ToxN inhibition requires the formation of a trimeric ToxIN complex, whereby three ToxI monomers bind three ToxN monomers; the complex is held together by extensive protein-RNA interactions.|$|E

5|$|Gene {{silencing}} aims {{to reduce}} {{the production of the}} mutant protein, since HD is caused by a single dominant gene encoding a <b>toxic</b> <b>protein.</b> Gene silencing experiments in mouse models have shown that when the expression of mHTT is reduced, symptoms improve. Safety of non-allele specific RNAi and ASO gene silencing has now been demonstrated in mice and the large, human-like brains of primates. Allele-specific silencing attempts to silence mutant HTT while leaving wild-type HTT untouched. One way of accomplishing this is to identify polymorphisms present on only one allele and produce gene silencing drugs that target polymorphisms in only the mutant allele. The first 'gene silencing' trial involving human HD patients began in 2015, testing the safety of IONIS-HTTRx, produced by Ionis Pharmaceuticals and led by UCL Institute of Neurology. Mutant huntingtin was detected and quantified {{for the first time in}} cerebrospinal fluid from Huntington's disease mutation-carriers in 2015 using a novel 'single-molecule counting' immunoassay, providing a direct way to assess whether huntingtin-lowering treatments are achieving the desired effect. Similarly, gene splicing techniques are being looked at to try to repair a genome with the erroneous gene that causes HD, using tools such as CRISPR/Cas9.|$|E
25|$|TTR is {{also thought}} to have {{beneficial}} side effects, by binding to the infamous beta-amyloid protein, thereby preventing beta-amyloid's natural tendency to accumulate into the plaques associated with {{the early stages of}} Alzheimer's Disease. Preventing plaque formation is thought to enable a cell to rid itself of this otherwise <b>toxic</b> <b>protein</b> form and, thus, help prevent and maybe even treat the disease.|$|E

40|$|Summary: There {{has been}} a great {{expansion}} in the number of small regulatory RNAs identified in bacteria. Some of these small RNAs repress the synthesis of potentially <b>toxic</b> <b>proteins.</b> Generally the toxin proteins are hydrophobic and less than 60 amino acids in length, and the corresponding antitoxin small RNA genes are antisense to the toxin genes or share long stretches of complementarity with the target mRNAs. Given their short length, {{only a limited number of}} these type I toxin-antitoxin loci have been identified, but it is predicted that many remain to be found. Already their characterization has given insights into regulation by small RNAs, has suggested functions for the small <b>toxic</b> <b>proteins</b> at the cell membrane, and has led to practical applications for some of the type I toxin-antitoxin loci...|$|R

5|$|The {{selective}} breeding of crop plants often involves selection against the plant's intrinsic resistance strategies. This makes crop plant varieties particularly susceptible to pests unlike their wild relatives. In breeding for host-plant resistance, {{it is often}} the wild relatives that provide the source of resistance genes. These genes are incorporated using conventional approaches to plant breeding, but have also been augmented by recombinant techniques, which allow introduction of genes from completely unrelated organisms. The most famous transgenic approach is the introduction of genes from the bacterial species, Bacillus thuringiensis, into plants. The bacterium produces proteins that, when ingested, kill lepidopteran caterpillars. The gene encoding for these highly <b>toxic</b> <b>proteins,</b> when introduced into the host plant genome, confers resistance against caterpillars, when the same <b>toxic</b> <b>proteins</b> are produced within the plant. This approach is controversial, however, due {{to the possibility of}} ecological and toxicological side effects.|$|R

40|$|Two {{mammalian}} introns, {{the human}} growth hormone intron and the Simian virus 40 large T antigen intron, were inserted into the coding sequences of diphtheria toxin fragment A (DT-A) and barnase (Bar), respectively, to disrupt their open-reading frames (ORFs). Expression of these two <b>toxic</b> <b>proteins</b> were totally abolished, which enabled the production of normal levels of recombinant baculoviral and adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors in insect cells. When these viral vectors were introduced into mammalian cells, the introns were spliced out and the <b>toxic</b> <b>proteins</b> were expressed, which resulted in apoptosis in mammalian cells. This is the first report to show that viral vectors harboring toxin genes can be produced at normal levels by exploiting the intron-splicing mechanism of insect cells. Furthermore, viral vectors carrying the DT-A gene under control of tumor-specific promoters were able to exert tumor-specific cell killing.
