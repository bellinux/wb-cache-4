By nightfall, both battalions held a toehold on {{the western edge of}} Ortona, yet had encountered heavy resistance in <b>their</b> <b>attempts</b> <b>to</b> secure it. The following day, D Company of the Loyal Edmonton Regiment launched attacks eastward towards the city centre, but accurate German sniper fire rapidly stalled the advance.|$|E

Although critics initially welcomed the character as a diverse addition to the cast, they grew frustrated with {{the slow pace of}} her storyline as the season progressed. Critics compared Angie to Betty Applewhite (Alfre Woodard), a character whose lagging storyline was slow in developing during the series' second season.|$|E

She had started coaching L'Estartit's youth teams the previous season. Difficulties with her visa and commitments with the Mexico national team eventually reduced Domínguez's playing time with UE L'Estartit.

5|$|Reduced {{to a minor}} character, the new fictional Napoleon became not a world {{historical}} figure but {{an intimate}} one, fashioned by individuals' needs and consumed as popular entertainment. In <b>their</b> <b>attempts</b> <b>to</b> represent the emperor as a figure of national unity, proponents and detractors of the Third Republic used the legend {{as a vehicle for}} exploring anxieties about gender and fears about the processes of democratization that accompanied this new era of mass politics and culture.|$|E

5|$|After {{the end of}} World War II in 1945, the rightwing {{elements}} who had {{resisted the}} US entry into World War II because of their pro-Fascist isolationism, continued <b>their</b> <b>attempts</b> <b>to</b> control and punish the left-leaning entertainment professionals who fought the spread of Fascism in Europe during the 1930s while the United States was technically neutral. In 1946, the Republicans gained an overwhelming majority in the Congressional elections. and used this power to re-invigorate committees there that had failed to stop anti-Fascist artists before the war. The Communist victory of China in 1949 {{and the start of}} the Korean War in 1950 reinforced the anti-Communist hysteria being whipped up at the time.|$|E
5|$|As a {{deception}} unit, {{the division}} {{was assigned to}} the bogus Operation Trolleycar. Trolleycar was initially envisioned as a fictitious amphibious assault upon the coast of the Netherlands, by the phantom British Fourth Army, to exploit the success of the authentic Operation Market Garden. When the Battle of Arnhem failed, the notional invasion plan was temporarily scrapped. Trolleycar was revived to convince the Germans that the Fourth Army would land near Emden, in support of an imaginary assault by the First Canadian Army, that would be launched west of Arnhem and through the Netherlands. The deception effort was kept up until 1945, being wound down in January. Despite the British ceasing <b>their</b> <b>attempts</b> <b>to</b> deceive the Germans about this possible landing and the Germans not believing all that had been reported to them, the Germans remained anxious about a landing along the northern coast {{for the remainder of the}} war.|$|E
5|$|Cope and Marsh were {{financially and}} {{socially}} ruined by <b>their</b> <b>attempts</b> <b>to</b> outcompete and disgrace each other, {{but they made}} important contributions to science and the field of paleontology, and provided substantial material for further work—both scientists left behind many unopened boxes of fossils after their deaths. The efforts {{of the two men}} led to more than 136 new species of dinosaurs being discovered and described. The products of the Bone Wars resulted in an increase in knowledge of prehistoric life, and sparked the public's interest in dinosaurs, leading to continued fossil excavation in North America in the decades to follow. Many historical books and fictional adaptations have been published about this period of intense fossil-hunting activity.|$|E

5|$|Durham's {{location}} in the north left it insecure, as Malcolm Canmore, King of Scots, raided and invaded the north of England {{on a number of}} occasions. Malcolm claimed Northumbria, in which Durham was located, as part of his kingdom. St-Calais managed to befriend Malcolm, and secured his support for the patron saint of Durham, Saint Cuthbert. Malcolm and his wife helped lay the foundation stone of the new cathedral dedicated to Cuthbert. Respect for the saint did not mean that Malcolm refrained entirely from raiding the north; he was killed in 1093 while once more raiding Northumbria. Both the English king and St-Calais did all in their power to support Malcolm's sons, who had been educated in England, in <b>their</b> <b>attempts</b> <b>to</b> secure the Scottish throne.|$|E
5|$|Gregory House, M.D., often {{construed}} as a misanthropic medical genius, heads a team of diagnosticians at the Princeton-Plainsboro Teaching Hospital in New Jersey. Most episodes revolve around the diagnosis of a primary patient and start with a cold open set outside the hospital, showing events ending {{with the onset of}} the patient's symptoms. The typical episode follows the team in <b>their</b> <b>attempts</b> <b>to</b> diagnose and treat the patient's illness, which often fail until the patient's condition is critical. They usually treat only patients whom other doctors have not accurately diagnosed, and House routinely rejects cases that he does not find interesting. The story lines tend to focus on his unconventional medical theories and practices, and on the other characters' reactions to them, rather than on the details of the treatments.|$|E

5|$|In 1797, the Escheat Movement {{was born}} {{with the goal of}} convincing the Crown to acquire land from the proprietors and sell it back to the tenants. In 1803, members of this Movement won seats in the General Assembly of Prince Edward Island, but <b>their</b> <b>attempts</b> <b>to</b> set in motion the escheat scheme were blocked by the British government. In the {{following}} years, a number of General Assemblies attempted to acquire land from the proprietors, but were repeatedly blocked by the British government. Following an unsuccessful attempt at civil disobedience in 1864-65, the proprietors gradually pulled out of the real estate market, selling their land piece-by-piece back to the local governments of the Island for sale to the occupants of their land. In 1873, Prince Edward Island joined the Canadian Confederation on the condition that the proprietors/tenants system be scrapped, ending the 'Land Question' in the province.|$|E
5|$|Lashed together, Temeraire and Fougueux {{exchanged}} fire, Temeraire initially {{clearing the}} French ship's upper deck with small arms fire. The French rallied, but the greater {{height of the}} three-decked Temeraire compared to the two-decked Fougueux thwarted <b>their</b> <b>attempts</b> <b>to</b> board. Instead Harvey dispatched his own boarding party, led by First-Lieutenant Thomas Fortescue Kennedy, which entered Fougueux via her main deck ports and chains. The French tried to defend the decks port by port, but were steadily overwhelmed. Fougueuxs captain, Louis Alexis Baudoin, had suffered a fatal wound earlier in the fighting, leaving Commander François Bazin in charge. When he learned that {{nearly all of the}} officers were dead or wounded and that most of the guns were out of action, Bazin surrendered the ship to the boarders.|$|E

Marge then wakes up on Christmas Day to find that her family has brought her the ingredients for breakfast in bed. <b>Their</b> <b>attempts</b> <b>to</b> cook it go awry, so they go out for breakfast instead.|$|E
