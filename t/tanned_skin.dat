5|$|Scotland Yard issued another {{appeal in}} March 2014 for {{information}} {{about a man who}} had entered holiday homes occupied by British families in four incidents in the western Algarve between 2004 and 2006, two of them in Praia da Luz. On those occasions he sexually assaulted five white girls, aged 7–10, in their beds. The man spoke English with a foreign accent and his speech was slow and perhaps slurred. He had short, dark, unkempt hair, <b>tanned</b> <b>skin,</b> and in the view of three victims a distinctive smell; he may have worn a long-sleeved burgundy top, perhaps with a white circle on the back. These were among 12 incidents in the area between 2004 and 2010. The Polícia Judiciária reportedly believed the intruder in the four incidents between 2004 and 2006 was Euclides Monteiro, the former Ocean Club employee from Cape Verde who died in 2009.|$|E
25|$|Originally, {{pale skin}} was {{considered}} most attractive.

25|$|Light-skinned {{people living}} in high {{sunlight}} environments {{are more susceptible to}} the harmful UV rays of sunlight {{because of the lack of}} melanin produced in the skin. The most common risk that comes with high exposure to sunlight is the increased risk of sunburns. This increased risk has come along with the cultural practice of sunbathing, which is popular among some human populations. This cultural practice to gain <b>tanned</b> <b>skin</b> if not regulated properly can lead to sunburn, especially among very lightly-skinned humans. The overexposure to sunlight also can lead to basal cell carcinoma, which is a common form of skin cancer.|$|E
25|$|In {{the second}} process, {{triggered}} primarily by UVB, {{there is an}} increase in production of melanin (melanogenesis), which is the body's reaction to direct DNA photodamage (formation of pyrimidine dimers) from UV radiation. Melanogenesis leads to delayed tanning, and typically becomes visible two or three days after exposure. The tan that is created by increased melanogenesis typically lasts for a few weeks or months, much longer than the tan that is caused by oxidation of existing melanin, and is also actually protective against UV skin damage and sunburn, rather than simply cosmetic. Typically, it can provide a modest Sun Protection Factor (SPF) of 3, meaning that <b>tanned</b> <b>skin</b> would tolerate up to 3 times the UV exposure as pale skin. However, in order to cause true melanogenesis-tanning by means of UV exposure, some direct DNA photodamage must first be produced, and this requires UVB exposure (as present in natural sunlight, or sunlamps that produce UVB).|$|E
25|$|In 1962, {{sunscreen}} commenced to be SPF rated, although SPF labeling in the US was not standardised by the FDA until 1978. In 1971, Mattel introduced Malibu Barbie, {{which had}} <b>tanned</b> <b>skin,</b> sunglasses, and her very own bottle of sun tanning lotion. In 1978, both sunscreen with an SPF 15 rating {{as well as}} tanning beds first appeared. In 2007, there were an estimated 50,000 outlets for indoor tanning; it was a five-billion-dollar industry in the United States, and had spawned an auxiliary industry for indoor tanning lotions including bronzers, intensifiers, and accelerators. Since then, the indoor tanning industry has become more constrained by health regulations. In China, darker skin is still {{considered by many to}} be the mark of the lower classes. As recently as 2012, in some parts of China, ski masks were becoming popular items to wear at the beach in order to protect the wearer's face from the effects of the sun.|$|E

25|$|Dark skin offers great {{protection}} against UVR {{because of its}} eumelanin content, the UVR-absorbing capabilities of large melanosomes, and because eumelanin can be mobilized faster and brought {{to the surface of}} the skin from the depths of the epidermis. For the same body region, light- and dark-skinned individuals have similar numbers of melanocytes (there is considerable variation between different body regions), but pigment-containing organelles, called melanosomes, are larger and more numerous in dark-skinned individuals. Keratocytes from dark skin cocultured with melanocytes give rise to a melanosome distribution pattern characteristic of dark skin. Melanosomes are not in aggregated state in darkly pigmented skin compared to lightly pigmented skin. Due to the heavily melanised melanosomes in darkly pigmented skin, it can absorb more energy from UVR and thus offers better {{protection against}} sunburns and by absorption and dispersion UV rays. Darkly pigmented skin protects against direct and indirect DNA damage. Photodegration occurs when melanin absorbs photons. Recent research suggest that the photoprotective effect of dark skin is increased by the fact that melanin can capture free radicals, such as hydrogen peroxide, which are created by the interaction of UVR and layers of the skin. Heavily pigmented melanocytes have greater capacity to divide after UVR irradiation, which suggests that they receive less damage to their DNA. Despite this, UVB damages the immune system even in darker skinned individuals due to its effect on Langerhans cells. The stratum corneum of people with dark or heavily <b>tanned</b> <b>skin</b> is more condensed and contains more cornified cell layers than in lightly pigmented humans. These qualities of dark skin enhance the barrier protection function of the skin.|$|E

2500|$|Significant {{exceptions}} to {{a preference for}} lighter skin started to appear in Western culture in the mid-20th century. Though sun-tanned skin was once associated with the sun-exposed manual labor of the lower class, the associations became dramatically reversed during this time—a change usually credited to the trendsetting Frenchwoman Coco Chanel making <b>tanned</b> <b>skin</b> seem fashionable, healthy, and luxurious. Today, though an overall preference for lighter skin remains prevalent in the United States, many within the country regard <b>tanned</b> <b>skin</b> as both more attractive and healthier than pale or very dark skin. [...] Western mass media and popular culture continued to reinforce negative stereotypes about dark skin, but in some circles pale skin has become associated with indoor office work while <b>tanned</b> <b>skin</b> has become associated with increased leisure time, sportiness and good health that comes with wealth and higher social status.

40|$|Vegetable tannins {{are found}} in several forest species. Actually, the Northeast Brazilian tanners have, on Anadenanthera colubrina var. cebil, their only source of {{vegetable}} tannins. This study aimed to evaluate the tanning capacity of tannins extracted from four vegetable species of Brazilian Semi-arid region, seeking to make possible the diversification of species {{to be used in}} tannings in the region. Thus, physical and mechanical characteristics of bovid treated skins with extract tannic of Anadenanthera colubrina var. cebil, Anacardium occidentale, Mimosa tenuiflora and Mimosa arenosa were analyzed. The bovid <b>skins</b> were <b>tanned</b> with extracted tannins of those species and compared to <b>tanned</b> <b>skins</b> by tannins of Acacia mearnsii (Seta Natur commercial tannin). The samples of <b>tanned</b> <b>skins</b> were submitted to tension, lengthening and progressive tear resistance tests. Good results were verified to <b>tanned</b> <b>skins</b> by Mimosa tenuiflora and Mimosa arenosa. Due to the abundance of these species in Brazilian Semi-arid region, they showed potential to exploration of tannins. However, researches are necessaries to indicate the best forms of application of obtained tannins...|$|R

2500|$|Shortly thereafter, in the 1920s, fashion-designer Coco Chanel accidentally got sunburnt {{while visiting}} the French Riviera. When she arrived home, she {{arrived with a}} sun tan and her fans {{apparently}} liked the look and started to adopt darker skin tones themselves. <b>Tanned</b> <b>skin</b> became a trend partly because of Coco’s status and the longing for her lifestyle by other members of society. In addition, Parisians {{fell in love with}} Josephine Baker, a “caramel-skinned” singer in Paris, and idolised her dark skin. These two women were leading figures of the transformation that <b>tanned</b> <b>skin</b> underwent, in which it became perceived as fashionable, healthy, and luxurious.
