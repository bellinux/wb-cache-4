Other occupations <b>that</b> <b>recently</b> has seen an increase in deskilling are doctors, teachers and assembly line workers.|$|E

25|$|Set and {{filmed in}} New York City, the series follows a two-part approach: the first half-hour is the {{investigation}} of a crime (usually murder) and apprehension of a suspect by New York City Police Department detectives; the second half is the prosecution of the defendant by the Manhattan District Attorney's Office. Plots are often based on real cases <b>that</b> <b>recently</b> made headlines, although the motivation for the crime and the perpetrator may be different.|$|E
25|$|Both the {{cladogram}} {{derived from}} Kenrick and Crane's studies {{and its implications}} for the evolution of land plants have been questioned by others. A 2008 review by Gensel notes <b>that</b> <b>recently</b> discovered fossil spores suggest that tracheophytes were present earlier than previously thought; perhaps earlier than supposed stem group members. Spore diversity suggests that there were many plant groups, of which no other remains are known. Some early plants may have had heteromorphic alternation of generations, with later acquisition of isomorphic gametophytes in certain lineages.|$|E

25|$|There are a {{diversity}} of Hispanic Jews living in America. The oldest community {{is that of the}} Sephardic Jews of New Netherland. Their ancestors had fled Spain or Portugal during the Inquisition for the Netherlands, and then came to New Netherland. Though there is dispute over whether they should be considered Hispanic. Some Hispanic Jews, particularly in Miami and Los Angeles, immigrated from Latin America. The largest groups are those that fled Cuba after the communist revolution (known as Jewbans), and Argentine Jews. Argentina is the Latin American country with the largest Jewish population. There are a large number of synagogues in the Miami area that give services in Spanish. The last Hispanic Jewish community would be those <b>that</b> <b>recently</b> came from Portugal or Spain, after Spain and Portugal granted citizenship to the descendants of Jews who fled during the Inquisition. All of the above listed Hispanic Jewish groups speak either Spanish or Ladino.|$|E
500|$|In the 19th century astronomers {{began to}} realize <b>that</b> <b>recently</b> {{discovered}} bodies that had been classified as planets for {{almost half a century}} (such as Ceres, Pallas, Juno, and Vesta) were very different from the traditional ones. These bodies shared the same region of space between Mars and Jupiter (the asteroid belt), and had a much smaller mass; as a result they were reclassified as [...] "asteroids". In the absence of any formal definition, a [...] "planet" [...] came to be understood as any [...] "large" [...] body that orbited the Sun. Because there was a dramatic size gap between the asteroids and the planets, and the spate of new discoveries seemed to have ended after the discovery of Neptune in 1846, there was no apparent need to have a formal definition.|$|E

In the episode, the Simpson family goes to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil {{in search of a}} Brazilian orphan named Ronaldo whom Lisa has been sponsoring. Lisa used to receive a letter from Ronaldo every month, but <b>that</b> <b>recently</b> stopped and according to personnel at the orphanage, he is missing. As the Simpsons search through Rio de Janeiro, Homer is kidnapped and in order to free him the family must pay a ransom of $50,000, which they do not have.

500|$|In chapter 49, High {{describes}} {{the death of}} the god Baldr. Hermóðr agrees to ride to Hel to offer a ransom for Baldr's return, and so [...] "then Odin's horse Sleipnir was fetched and led forward." [...] Hermóðr mounts Sleipnir and rides away. Hermóðr rides for nine nights in deep, dark valleys where Hermóðr can see nothing. The two arrive at the river Gjöll and then continue to Gjöll bridge, encountering a maiden guarding the bridge named Móðguðr. Some dialogue occurs between Hermóðr and Móðguðr, including that Móðguðr notes <b>that</b> <b>recently</b> there had ridden five battalions of dead men across the bridge that made less sound than he. Sleipnir and Hermóðr continue [...] "downwards and northwards" [...] on the road to Hel, until the two arrive at Hel's gates. Hermóðr dismounts from Sleipnir, tightens Sleipnir's girth, mounts him, and spurs Sleipnir on. Sleipnir [...] "jumped so hard and over the gate that it came nowhere near." [...] Hermóðr rides up to the hall, and dismounts from Sleipnir. After Hermóðr's pleas to Hel to return Baldr are accepted under a condition, Hermóðr and Baldr retrace their path backward and return to Asgard.|$|E
500|$|The {{scenario}} is {{an adaptation of}} Oliver Goldsmith's She Stoops to Conquer and was not, by that time, not familiar to most theatergoers. The writer of the {{scenario is}} unknown, but it was most likely Lloyd Lonergan. He was an experienced newspaperman employed by The New York Evening World while writing scripts for the Thanhouser productions. The impetus to adapt the play for the film may {{have been inspired by}} a recent Broadway production as noted in one Thanhouser advertisement, [...] "So revered is She Stoops to Conquer in the hearts of the American public <b>that</b> <b>recently</b> they saw it as an all-star Broadway production with Eleanor Robson as Kate and Kyrle Bellew as Marlow, and it scored an epoch-making success. The present producers don't claim it to be a Broadway production but they [...] know it's the best picture thing of its kind that has been released this far in the game." [...] The advertisement also claims to be the first film adaptation of the play, which according to The Complete Index to Literary Sources in Film it is. She Stoops to Conquer would see numerous adaptations over the following decades, but the Thanhouser Company would also draw from Goldsmith's work with their first adaptation of The Vicar of Wakefield in 1910.|$|E

500|$|Separately {{from the}} Independent Counsel investigation, Judicial Watch, a {{conservative}} watchdog group, engaged in long-running litigation over the White House personnel file controversy. [...] Judicial Watch's Cara Leslie Alexander et al. vs. Federal Bureau of Investigation et al. class action lawsuit, filed {{on behalf of}} {{several members of the}} Reagan and George H. W. Bush Administrations, alleged that Livingstone, along with Anthony Marceca and William Kennedy, obtained the files and then rifled through them. [...] Judicial Watch founder and Clintons antagonist suprême Larry Klayman attracted enough attention with the case to have the recurring Larry Claypool character modeled after him on the television series The West Wing. [...] As late as January 2000, Judicial Watch was filing affidavits in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia under Judge Royce C. Lamberth related to the case. [...] In their $90 million lawsuit, they claimed that the First Lady did, despite her denials, know Livingstone – indeed, that Livingstone had bragged to associates he was very close to both the president and his wife – and that Clinton had personally hired him for the security job. (White House defenders pointed out that Livingstone had a long history of exaggerating his importance and connections.) Judicial Watch also said they had five sources who claimed Livingstone had been hired by and worked under the First Lady, and also discovered some photographs of Livingstone {{in the vicinity of the}} First Lady (but not talking with him). [...] In December 2002 Judicial Watch obtained a ruling from Judge Lamberth <b>that</b> <b>recently</b> uncovered White House e-mails be searched for possible evidence in the lawsuit. [...] Klayman said, [...] "Hillary Clinton was the mastermind of Filegate. She will not escape justice." [...] Klayman and Judicial Watch had a severe falling out in 2003, however, and several years went by with little or nothing happening in the lawsuit.|$|E
