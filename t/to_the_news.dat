5|$|As a {{response}} to the Young Turk Revolution of 1908, Venizelos's power base was further strengthened, and on 8 October 1908 the Cretan Assembly passed a resolution in favor of union despite both the reservations of the Athens government under Georgios Theotokis and the objections of the Great Powers. The muted reaction of the Athens Government <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>news</b> from Crete led to an unsettled state of affairs on the mainland.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, Arsenal invited Galatasaray {{to compete}} at their annual Emirates Cup tournament.

5|$|In {{contrast}} to Wat Tyler's entrance in 1381, in 1450, Jack Cade and 4,000 rebels were barred entry {{from the city}} at West Gate. In 1533, Canterbury reacted with concern <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>news</b> of Thomas Wyatt's rebellion in Kent; repairs {{were made to the}} walls, guns and ammunition mobilised, and the Riding Gate was blocked up.

5|$|When BSkyB publicised their {{intentions}} {{to take over}} Manchester United, supporters reacted furiously <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>news.</b> The majority felt the club’s traditions, built on a loyal fan base and great teams including the Busby Babes and currently Fergie's Fledglings would just be tarnished forever. United were no longer an independent entity, and major decisions affecting the club looked increasingly likely to be taken {{on the other side}} of the globe.|$|E
5|$|A letter dated 26 September 1985 {{from the}} {{assistant}} director of public prosecutions who prepared the case against Bamber suggests that Mugford not be prosecuted for the burglary, the cheque fraud, and for a further offence of selling cannabis. She subsequently testified against Bamber during his trial in October 1986. The judge told the jury that they could convict Bamber on Mugford's testimony alone. Immediately after the verdict was announced, Mugford sold her story <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>News</b> of the World for ₤25,000 (£ in 2016).|$|E
5|$|After {{a five-day}} away mission spent apologising {{on the planet}} Kreetassa, the away team {{consisting}} of Captain Archer, Sub-Commander T'Pol, Ensign Sato, and Archer's dog, Porthos, return to the ship to decontaminate. Porthos has acquired a pathogen on the planet surface and must be quarantined. Archer learns from Commander Tucker of the ship's need for an extra plasma injector from the Kreetassans, but negotiations break down after it is discovered that Porthos had urinated on a sacred tree, insulting the Kreetassans.

5|$|Although {{the main}} story ends here, the {{introduction}} of the Broken Steel DLC creates a new choice with the ending, in that the Lone Wanderer can send one of their radiation-immune companions into the chamber to input the code. Furthermore, the game remains open-ended from this point onwards, with the Wanderer surviving the radiation they were subjected to, and recovering two weeks later <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>news</b> that the purifier is working well and supplying clean water {{to the people of the}} waste, or has been having an adverse effect on life thanks to {{the introduction of}} the modified FEV. Sarah Lyons does not survive if sent into the chamber in the Broken Steel ending.|$|E
5|$|Another crisis {{broke in}} September 1949 when the Air Force picked up {{signs of the}} Soviet Union's RDS-1 nuclear test. Bacher joined Oppenheimer, Parsons, General Hoyt Vandenberg, the Atomic Energy Commissioners and a British {{delegation}} under William Penney to discuss what to do. The recent devaluation of the British pound had already triggered a financial crisis, and there was concern about how the markets would react <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>news.</b> Oppenheimer and Bacher saw the evidence of a nuclear test as conclusive, and Bacher in particular came down strongly {{on the side of}} making a public announcement, as {{the number of people who}} already knew made a leak almost inevitable. Truman made the announcement a few days later.|$|E
5|$|Documents {{released}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>news</b> media by {{the animal}} rights organization Uncaged Campaigns showed that, between 1994 and 2000, wild baboons imported to the UK from Africa by Imutran Ltd, {{a subsidiary of}} Novartis Pharma AG, in conjunction with Cambridge University and Huntingdon Life Sciences, {{to be used in}} experiments that involved grafting pig tissues, suffered serious and sometimes fatal injuries. A scandal occurred when it was revealed that the company had communicated with the British government in an attempt to avoid regulation.|$|E

5|$|On April 12, 1961, Soviet {{cosmonaut}} Yuri Gagarin {{became the}} first person to fly in space, reinforcing American fears about being left behind in a technological competition with the Soviet Union. At a meeting of the US House Committee on Science and Astronautics one day after Gagarin's flight, many congressmen pledged their support for a crash program aimed at ensuring that America would catch up. Kennedy was circumspect in his response <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>news,</b> refusing to make a commitment on America's response to the Soviets.|$|E
5|$|Since its release, Kadhalikka Neramillai has {{developed}} a cult status in Tamil cinema. It has been hailed as a trendsetting comedy, and the film is said to kindle a feeling of joie de vivre. The film's comedy sequences are regarded as evergreen.

According <b>to</b> <b>The</b> <b>News</b> Today, Kadhalikka Neramillai also popularised the romantic comedy genre.|$|E

5|$|Stalin {{was aware}} that the Americans {{were working on the}} atomic bomb and, given that the Soviets' own rival program was in place, he reacted <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>news</b> calmly.

One week {{after the end of the}} Potsdam Conference, the US bombed Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Shortly after the attacks, Stalin protested to US officials when Truman offered the Soviets little real influence in occupied Japan.|$|E
5|$|The {{prescribed}} readings for {{the second}} of three Easter feast days included the narration of the Road to Emmaus. The cantata was Bach's first composition for Easter as Thomaskantor in Leipzig. He derived it from his earlier Serenata, which had a similar celebratory mood. An unknown librettist solved the problem that Bach's congratulatory cantata was a dialogue of tenor and alto by retaining a dialogue in three movements, assigned to Hope and Fear. They represent different attitudes <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>news</b> of the Resurrection of Jesus, which {{may be found in}} the two disciples, discussing the events on their walk, but also within the listener of the cantata.|$|E
