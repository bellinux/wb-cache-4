25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Coast</b> Guard's {{main task}} is to assert and uphold Norwegian {{sovereignty}} over its inland waters, territorial waters and exclusive economic zone (EEZ). Its structure is centered around a peace-time role, with judicial basis in <b>the</b> <b>Coast</b> Guard Act (Kystvaktloven) of 1997. It states that the authority of <b>the</b> <b>Coast</b> Guard lies with the primary agency responsible for a situation and that <b>the</b> <b>Coast</b> Guard's powers supplement these. However, <b>the</b> <b>Coast</b> Guard also holds a series of independent capabilities in which it can take action without external instruction.

5|$|The Atlantic puffin is a bird of the colder {{waters of}} the North Atlantic Ocean. It breeds on <b>the</b> <b>coasts</b> of north west Europe, the Arctic fringes and eastern North America. More than 90% of the global {{population}} is found in Europe (4,770,000-5,780,000 pairs, equalling 9,550,000-11,600,000 adults) and colonies in Iceland alone are home to 60% of the world's Atlantic puffins. The largest colony in the western Atlantic (estimated at more than 260,000 pairs) {{can be found at}} the Witless Bay Ecological Reserve, south of St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador. Other major breeding locations include the north and west coasts of Norway, the Faroe Islands, the Shetland and Orkney islands, the west coast of Greenland and <b>the</b> <b>coasts</b> of Newfoundland. Smaller sized colonies are also found elsewhere in the British Isles, the Murmansk area of Russia, Novaya Zemlya, Spitzbergen, Labrador, Nova Scotia and Maine.

40|$|In {{response}} to {{the terrorist attacks of}} September 11, 2001, <b>the</b> <b>Coast</b> Guard significantly increased homeland-security operations to protect U.
