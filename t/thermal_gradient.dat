40|$|This study {{presents}} an experimental and numerical {{investigation of the}} beneficial effect of higher conductivity materials in HP turbine nozzles. Most of the literature studies focus on the maximum temperature that a nozzle can withstand, whereas the effect of <b>thermal</b> <b>gradients</b> is often neglected.

In this work it is shown that <b>thermal</b> <b>gradients</b> are reduced by using high conductivity materials and, as a consequence, the nozzles life is appreciably increased. A representative film cooled leading edge with an internal impingement plate was studied experimentally at Texas AM University. Two materials were used, namely polycarbonate and stainless steel, in order to highlight the impact of conduction on coolant effectiveness. Numerically conjugate heat transfer simulations have been carried out with an in house solver to analyse in detail the impact of conduction and internal convection.

The present work studied the effect of natural <b>thermal</b> <b>gradients</b> on estimates of sap flow by using thermal dissipation probe in mango plants. The study was carried by using mango plants of the cultivar Tommy Atkins during two development stages: (a) during the initial development phase of plants with leaf area of 0. 66, 0. 73, 1. 78 m 2, planted in 15 and 50 liters pots.

2500|$|By this time, geologists {{recognised}} {{that the}} Earth was {{millions of years}} old. The exact chronology proposed by Darwin was disputed by other geologists, and the leading physicist [...] (later enobled as Lord Kelvin) produced an analyses of the heat energy and thermal histories of the Earth and Sun which yielded age estimates that were too short for gradual evolution. Thomson's colleague Fleeming Jenkin wrote an 1867 review of Darwin's On the Origin of species which opposed evolution {{on the basis of}} the shortened time available.

2500|$|In 1821, Thomas Johann Seebeck {{discovered}} that a <b>thermal</b> <b>gradient</b> formed between two dissimilar conductors produces a voltage. [...] At {{the heart of the}} thermoelectric effect is the fact that a temperature gradient in a conducting material results in heat flow; this results in the diffusion of charge carriers. The flow of charge carriers between the hot and cold regions in turn creates a voltage difference. In 1834, Jean Charles Athanase Peltier {{discovered that}} running an electric current through the junction of two dissimilar conductors could, depending on the direction of the current, cause it to act as a heater or cooler. The heat absorbed or produced is proportional to the current, and the proportionality constant is known as the Peltier coefficient. Today, due to knowledge of the Seebeck and Peltier effects, thermoelectric materials can be used as heaters, coolers and generators (TEGs).|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{effectiveness}} of structural health monitoring via ultrasonic methods is seriously compromised by changing environmental {{conditions such as}} temperature. Variations in temperature can be spuriously identified as damage owing to thermal expansion or contraction of the material as well as changing of the wave propagation speed. This problem becomes even more serious when temperature changes are inhomogeneous such as when the structure is in unevenly sunlit conditions. The focus {{of this paper is}} the detection and characterization of <b>thermal</b> <b>gradients</b> in a homogeneous plate, which is a necessary first step before considering the effect of <b>thermal</b> <b>gradients</b> on monitoring of damage. Experiments were performed by permanently mounting two piezoelectric disc transducers on a homogeneous aluminum plate. Long-time, reverberating signals were recorded from the plate under ambient conditions, homogeneous temperature changes, and <b>thermal</b> <b>gradients.</b> The gradients were generated by local heating of a small area on the plate, and signals were recorded during cooling until steady state conditions were reached. Signals from both homogeneous temperature changes and <b>thermal</b> <b>gradients</b> were compared with the baselines using several metric, and these metrics were evaluated in terms of their ability to detect and characterize <b>thermal</b> <b>gradients</b> as compared to homogeneous temperature changes. Results indicate that the peak coherence drop and the standard deviation of the time-dependent time delay were most effective...|$|R
40|$|Solid {{oxide fuel}} cells (SOFCs) are high {{temperature}} (600 C- 1000 C) composite metallic/ceramic-cermet electrochemical devices. There {{is a need}} to effectively manage the heat transfer through the cell to mitigate material failure induced by thermal stresses while yet preserving performance. The present dissertation offers a novel thermodynamic optimization approach that utilizes dimensionless geometric parameters to design a SOFC. Through entropy generation minimization, the architecture of a planar SOFC has been redesigned to optimally balance <b>thermal</b> <b>gradients</b> and cell performance. Cell performance has been defined using the 2 nd law metric of exergetic efficiency. One constrained optimization problem was solved. The optimization sought to maximize exergetic efficiency through minimizing total entropy production while constraining <b>thermal</b> <b>gradients.</b> Optimal designs were produced that had exergetic efficiency exceeding 92 % while maximum <b>thermal</b> <b>gradients</b> were between 219 C/m and 1249 C/m. As the architecture was modified, the magnitude of sources of entropy generation changed. Ultimately, it was shown that the architecture of a SOFC can be modified through thermodynamic optimization to maximize performance while limiting <b>thermal</b> <b>gradients.</b> The present dissertation highlights a new design methodology and provides insights on the connection between <b>thermal</b> <b>gradients,</b> performance, sources of entropy generation, and cell architecture.

40|$|The Late Cretaceous {{was much}} warmer than today. There was no {{significant}} ice at high latitudes, meridional <b>thermal</b> <b>gradients</b> were low, and continental interiors remained warm during winter. Late Cretaceous atmospheric C 02 concentrations were about four times greater than today and an enhanced "greenhouse" effect contributed to the overall warmth of the Late Cretaceous. However, increases in atmospheric C 02 tend to increase temperatures at all latitudes and do not explain the very low <b>thermal</b> <b>gradients</b> recognized in the geologic record. Increased poleward ocean heat transport has been cited as a mechanism for maintaining low meridional <b>thermal</b> <b>gradients</b> during the Cretaceous. However, ocean heat transport values larger than the present day are difficult to reconcile. In addition, low meridional <b>thermal</b> <b>gradients</b> suggest sluggish atmospheric circulation, implying that the advection of heat from the warm oceans into the continental interiors was limited. In general, paleoclimate simulations using Atmospheric General Circulations Models (AGCMs) have not been successful in simulating the low meridional <b>thermal</b> <b>gradients</b> and warm winter continental interiors of the Cretaceous, forcing the concept of "equability" to be questioned.
