2500|$|Lancashire's reply started <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>unstuck</b> {{when both}} openers, Stuart Law and Iain Sutcliffe, fell in {{successive}} balls with the score on 23. The game saw {{the return of}} Andrew Flintoff, back after his operation and playing just as a batsman. But he couldn't stop the rot and made only 17 before falling lbw to Scott Styris. The Lightning were finally all out for 141 and Middlesex completed their second win in two matches. All eleven bowlers used in the match got at least one wicket, but the most prolific wicket-taker, Kyle Hogg, also conceded the most runs.|$|E
5000|$|In February 2009, it was {{announced}} that Sharon Duncan Brewster had been cast as Lucas's estranged wife Trina. Entertainment website Digital Spy reported: [...] "Trina arrives and surprises Lucas and she makes it very clear she wants to give things another go. Lucas tries to get rid of her but his secret is out when Patrick (Rudolph Walker) sees what's going on. Just how willing will Trina be to let her husband walk into the arms of another woman? And more importantly, will she divorce him to enable him to marry again?" [...] Despite his connection with the church, in September 2009 Lucas attempts to cover up his involvement in Trina's death. Gilet told Soaplife magazine, [...] "When he first appeared someone wrote in saying he was a good character, but somewhere down the line something was going <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>unstuck.</b> We've always known there was more to this do-gooder than meets the eye. Things {{are going to get a}} lot darker in the build-up to Christmas. ... It's going to get very dark and I hope I can pull it off." [...] Lucas went on to kill Denise's ex-husband Owen Turner (Lee Ross) when he came close to discovering how Lucas was involved in Trina's death. Gilet explained that although Lucas does not want people dead and has no malice in his heart, he sees killing as a way to stop things from happening. When the show's executive producer Diederick Santer was asked by Digital Spy what was lined up for Lucas in 2010, he said [...] "He's got right on his side, hasn't he? Is the world a better place without Trina? Probably, yes. Is the world a better place without Owen? Well, I don't know about that, but he's not a particularly nice person... Lucas is doing the Lord's work and who knows what that's doing to his head maybe he'll kill again. Lucas's story is 'poised' and we're just trying to work out the exact timing of the long-term story. There's brilliant stuff in the pipeline [...] - [...] it's one for a slow burn really. We have Lucas who's a murderer. Will he murder again? Who's the next person to cross him? He's one dangerous man." ...|$|E
40|$|A program’s {{development}} and implementation in a higher education institution is usually launched with great fanfare, goodwill and a huge {{effort on the part}} of the whole development team to ensure a worthwhile cohesive set of learning experiences aligned to the desired course learning outcomes. It is often not long before the glue starts <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>unstuck</b> arising from staffing changes, subtle migration of course resources, opportunistic inclusions of “off the shelf ” or unit based innovative teaching and learning approaches, and perhaps general poor attention to detail with regard to the impact of new introductions and electives. This paper presents an initial investigation into the elusive goal of achieving course cohesion. The authors consider building cohesion into a course as it is being designed through identified cohesion factors and in sustaining course cohesion through active leadership...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} concept of local {{universality}} {{in relation to the}} regulation of animal health. Protocols have <b>come</b> <b>to</b> {{play an important role in}} medical practice, standardising diseases and the expertise required to identify them. Focusing on the use of protocols to identify bovine tuberculosis (bTB) in England and Wales, it is argued that the decontextualised expertise inherent <b>to</b> protocols <b>comes</b> <b>unstuck</b> in practice. Using ethnographies of two veterinary practices, the paper instead shows how forms of situated veterinary expertise emerge in response to practical contingencies, thereby enacting different ontological versions of bTB. The development of these skills stems from the relationships that organise bTB testing as well as through informal work-based modes of learning. Although these practices vary from place to place and depart from the bTB testing protocol, it is variation in practice rather than uniformity that effectively allows the protocol to work. In conclusion, the paper discusses how the management of animal health may be assisted by a flexible rather than uniform approach to disease and veterinary expertise...|$|R
50|$|The 2008-09 {{season was}} <b>to</b> see Wasps <b>come</b> <b>unstuck.</b> With their captain having retired, {{many of the}} players failed to play to their full potential. Wasps would {{eventually}} finish in seventh place, having also failed to reach the knock-out stages of the Heineken Cup and EDF Anglo Welsh Cup. On 12 May 2009 it was announced in the evening standard that Ian McGeechan {{had been forced to}} step down and will now take a consultancy role both at London Wasps and London Scottish. This was confirmed by the BBC on 14 May. Tony Hanks, a former coach at the club, was announced as the new Director of Rugby soon after. He had more recently been coaching at Waikato and also been a stand in for McGeechan for {{the latter part of the}} 2008/09 season, while he was primarily committed to British and Irish Lions duty. McGeechan had technically been a Lions employee for the whole season and through agreement with Wasps was loaned back to the club.|$|R
40|$|The {{methacrylate}} terpolymers, a nonchromophoric and chromophoric one, containing 2 -hydroxyethyl {{groups were}} reacted with 3 -isocyanatopropyltriethoxysilane to obtain reactive polymers able to form covalent bonding with –SiOH {{groups of the}} glass surface via triethoxysilane group condensation. Chemical modification of the Corning 2949 glass plates treated in this way resulted in increase of wetting angle from 11 ° to ca. 70 – 73 °. Determination of ellipsometric parameters revealed low value of the substrate refractive index as {{compared with that of}} bulk Corning 2949 glass suggesting roughness of the surface. The AFM image of the bare glass surface and that modified with terpolymer monolayer confirmed this phenomenon. Modification of the glass with the terpolymer monolayer made it possible to create the substrate surface well suited for deposition of familiar chromophore film by spin-coating. The chromophore polymer film deposited onto the modified glass surface was found to be resistant <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>unstuck</b> in aqueous solution...|$|E

2500|$|On September 4, {{a devastating}} {{nighttime}} air raid struck a riverbank only 7 kilometres {{to the southwest}} of Kunduz.
