40|$|Metabolic {{syndrome}} (MetSyn) is the clustering {{of multiple}} metabolic disorders that further {{increase the risk}} for cardiovascular disease and has been recently linked to poor lymphatic function. The lymphatic system {{plays a crucial role}} in maintaining oncotic balance and returning excess fluid and macromolecules back to the blood circulation. In this dissertation we addressed the role of macrophage polarization and nitric oxide mechanisms in lymphatic dysfunction in a rat model of MetSyn. We hypothesized that mesenteric lymphatic vessel dysfunction would be associated with a polarization switch of resident macrophages after induction of peritonitis or metabolic syndrome. We used an intra-peritoneal injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to simulate peritonitis in the rat and a seven-week high fructose-feeding regime to induce the MetSyn. We distinguished macrophage polarization and recruitment to the lymphatic collecting vessels using immunofluorescence and a combination of CD 163, CD 206, and major histocompatibility complex II (MHCII) expression. We determined the intrinsic mesenteric lymphatic contractility using the isolated mesenteric lymphatic vessel isobaric preparation. LPS-induced peritonitis increased the macrophage accumulation two fold and increased both CD 163 +CD 206 + and CD 163 -CD 206 + cell populations and had severely impaired lymphatic contractility. We also found evidence for a phenotype switch from CD 163 +MHCII- M 2 macrophages to a M 1 skewed CD 163 +MHCII+ phenotype in the MetSyn rats and impaired lymphatic contractility. Additionally, cultured lymphatic endothelial and muscle cells were found to express macrophage maturation and expansion markers in response to LPS stimulation. We also examined the role of nitric oxide in the contractile regulation of lymphatic <b>thoracic</b> <b>ducts</b> isolated from MetSyn rats. We found a reduced flow-dependent inhibition of contractility in metabolic syndrome <b>thoracic</b> <b>ducts</b> despite a normal response to the exogenous nitric oxide donor S-nitro-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP). The reactive oxygen species scavenging agent 4 -hydroxy- 2, 2, 6, 6 -tetramethylpiperidine-N-oxyl (TEMPOL) did not restore flow sensitivity, however control vessels treated with the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor L-NG-nitro arginine methyl ester (LNAME) had comparable flow inhibition to MetSyn <b>thoracic</b> <b>ducts.</b> Western blots of <b>thoracic</b> <b>ducts</b> revealed a 60 % reduction in the expression of eNOS, which can explain the loss of shear sensitivity.

25|$|Lymphedema, {{also known}} as {{lymphoedema}} and lymphatic edema, is a condition of localized fluid retention and tissue swelling caused by a compromised lymphatic system, which normally returns interstitial fluid to the <b>thoracic</b> <b>duct,</b> then the bloodstream.

25|$|The lymphatic vessels, {{also called}} lymph vessels, conduct lymph between {{different}} parts of the body. They include the tubular vessels of the lymph capillaries, and the larger collecting vessels–the right lymphatic duct and the <b>thoracic</b> <b>duct</b> (the left lymphatic duct). The lymph capillaries are mainly responsible for the absorption of interstitial fluid from the tissues, while lymph vessels propel the absorbed fluid forward into the larger collecting ducts, where it ultimately returns to the bloodstream via one of the subclavian veins.

50|$|Triglycerides are {{emulsified}} by bile and hydrolyzed by {{the enzyme}} lipase, {{resulting in a}} mixture of fatty acids and monoglycerides.

The triacylglycerol is then combined with phospholipids, cholesterol ester, and apolipoprotein B-48 to form a nascent chylomicron. These are then released by exocytosis from enterocytes into lacteals, lymphatic vessels originating in the villi of the small intestine, and are then secreted into the bloodstream at the <b>thoracic</b> <b>duct's</b> connection with the left subclavian vein.|$|R

This condition commonly results in a lung torsion (in which the dog's lung twists within the chest cavity, requiring emergency surgery), due to the breed's typically deep, [...] "barrel"-shaped chest. If not corrected through surgery, chylothorax can ultimately cause fibrosing pleuritis, or a hardening of the organs, due to scar tissue forming around the organs to protect them from the chyle fluid.

25|$|Bile emulsifies fats {{contained}} in the chyme, then pancreatic lipase cleaves triacylglycerol molecules into two fatty acids and one 2-monoacylglycerol. Enterocytes readily absorb these small molecules from the chymus. Inside of the enterocytes, fatty acids and monoacylglycerides are transformed again into triacylglycerides. Then these lipids (i.e. triacylglycerols, phospholipids, cholesterol, and cholesteryl esters) are assembled with apolipoprotein B-48 into nascent chylomicrons. These particles are then secreted into the lacteals {{in a process that}} depends heavily on apolipoprotein B-48. As they circulate through the lymphatic vessels, nascent chylomicrons bypass the liver circulation and are drained via the <b>thoracic</b> <b>duct</b> into the bloodstream.|$|E
25|$|The {{contents}} of these micelles (but not the bile salts) enter the enterocytes (epithelial cells lining the small intestine) {{where they are}} resynthesized into triglycerides, and packaged into chylomicrons which are released into the lacteals (the capillaries of the lymph system of the intestines). These lacteals drain into the <b>thoracic</b> <b>duct</b> which empties into the venous blood at the junction of the left jugular and left subclavian veins on the lower left hand side of the neck. This means that the fat soluble products of digestion are discharged directly into the general circulation, without first passing through the liver, as all other digestion products do. The reason for this peculiarity is unknown.|$|E

40|$|Lymphangiogenesis, the {{formation}} of new lymphatic vessels, is associated to numerous pathologies (1) and understanding the molecular and cellular basis of this complex process {{is essential for the}} development of novel therapeutic strategies. Studies on lymphangiogenesis have been hampered by difficulties in culturing lymphatic capillaries as three-dimensional (3 D) structures in vitro that mimic the in vivo features of lymphatic vessels and lymphangiogenesis. The lymphatic ring assay described here phenocopies the different steps of lymphangiogenesis, including the spreading from a preexisting vessel, cell proliferation, migration and differentiation into capillaries. It consists on the adaptation of the aortic ring assay that has proved to be useful to investigate the molecular basis of angiogenesis (2 - 4). The lymphatic ring model is an ideal assay for testing the activity of lymphangiogenic agonists or antagonists. The absence of inflammatory cells allows a simple interpretation of results and the determination of direct effects of compounds on lymphatic endothelial cell properties. Another advantage of the lymphatic ring assay is that cell outgrowing are primary cells which have not been modified by repeated passages or immortalization.

25|$|Lymph {{is formed}} from the fluid that filters {{out of the}} blood {{circulation}} to nourish cells. This fluid returns through venous capillaries to the blood circulation through the force of osmosis in the venous blood; however, {{a portion of the}} fluid that contains proteins, cellular debris, bacteria, etc. must return through the lymphatic collection system to maintain tissue fluid balance. The collection of this prelymph fluid is carried out by the initial lymph collectors that are blind-ended epithelial-lined vessels with fenestrated openings that allow fluids and particles as large as cells to enter. Once inside the lumen of the lymphatic vessels, the fluid is guided along increasingly larger vessels, first with rudimentary valves to prevent backflow, which later develop into complete valves similar to the venous valve. Once the lymph enters the fully valved lymphatic vessels, it is pumped by a rhythmic peristaltic-like action by smooth muscle cells within the lymphatic vessel walls. This peristaltic action is the primary driving force, moving lymph within its vessel walls. The regulation of the frequency and power of contraction is regulated by the sympathetic nervous system. Lymph movement can be influenced by the pressure of nearby muscle contraction, arterial pulse pressure and the vacuum created in the chest cavity during respiration, but these passive forces contribute only a minor percentage of lymph transport. The fluids collected are pumped into continually larger vessels and through lymph nodes, which remove debris and police the fluid for dangerous microbes. The lymph ends its journey in the <b>thoracic</b> <b>duct</b> or right lymphatic duct, which drain into the blood circulation.|$|E

2500|$|In the mid 16th century, Gabriele Falloppio (discoverer of the fallopian tubes), {{described}} what are {{now known as}} the lacteals as [...] "coursing over the intestines full of yellow matter." [...] In about 1563 Bartolomeo Eustachi, a professor of anatomy, described the <b>thoracic</b> <b>duct</b> in horses as vena alba thoracis. The next breakthrough came when in 1622 a physician, Gaspare Aselli, identified lymphatic vessels of the intestines in dogs and termed them venae alba et lacteae, which is now known as simply the lacteals. The lacteals were termed the fourth kind of vessels (the other three being the artery, vein and nerve, which was then believed to be a type of vessel), and disproved Galen's assertion that chyle was carried by the veins. But, he still believed that the lacteals carried the chyle to the liver (as taught by Galen). He also identified the <b>thoracic</b> <b>duct</b> but failed to notice its connection with the lacteals. This connection was established by Jean Pecquet in 1651, who found a white fluid mixing with blood in a dog's heart. He suspected that fluid to be chyle as its flow increased when abdominal pressure was applied. He traced this fluid to the <b>thoracic</b> <b>duct,</b> which he then followed to a chyle-filled sac he called the chyli receptaculum, which is {{now known as the}} cisternae chyli; further investigations led him to find that lacteals' contents enter the venous system via the <b>thoracic</b> <b>duct.</b> Thus, it was proven convincingly that the lacteals did not terminate in the liver, thus disproving Galen's second idea: that the chyle flowed to the liver. Johann Veslingius drew the earliest sketches of the lacteals in humans in 1647.|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE:To {{evaluate}} the changes of contractility and reactivity in isolated lymphatics from hemorrhagic shock rats with resuscitation.

40|$|Several {{theories}} have been advanced {{to describe the}} digestion of fats in animals and in humans. Of these, two have been popular. The hydrolytic theory (1) suggests that triglycerides are broken down completely to fatty acids and glycerol which are then absorbed into the intestinal wall. The particulate theory (2) suggests that triglycerides are partially hydrolyzed in the intestinal lumen to monoglycerides, diglycerides, and fatty acids. The partial glycerides, fatty acids, and bile salts cause a fine emulsification of the remaining tri-glyceride. This emulsion, containing triglycer-ides, then enters the intestinal wall. Much indirect evidence exists {{for the formation of}} partial glycerides during fat digestion. Reiser, Bryson, Carr, and Kuiken (3) analyzed the lipids recovered from the <b>thoracic</b> <b>ducts</b> of rats fed tagged triglyceride and concluded that the major portion of ingested fat is hydrolyzed to mono-glyceride prior to absorption. Frazer and Sam-mons (4) noted that lipids isolated from the lu-men of the intestinal tract of rats had a high hydroxyl value and concluded that monoglyceride was present. Later Frazer (5) reported, without presenting experimental details, that he had found monoglycerides in the intestinal tracts of human subjects. The formation and presence of mono-glycerides in the intestinal tract during the di-gestion of fat has been reported in the dog (6), rat (3, 4, 7 - 9), cat (10), monkey (8), and man (5, 11).

Mixtures containing similar amounts of two, three, or four C14-labeled fatty acids (palmitic, stearic, oleic, and linoleic acids), but with varying ratios of unlabeled fatty acids, were given by gastric intubation to rats with cannulated <b>thoracic</b> <b>ducts.</b> The chyle or chylomicron lipid so obtained was chromatographed on silicic acid columns to separate cholesterol esters and glycerides (the latter being 98.2% triglycerides). After assaying each lipid class for total radioactivity, gas-liquid chromatography was employed to measure the total mass {{and the distribution of}} mass and of radioactivity in the individual fatty acid components of each lipid fraction. The specific radioactivity of each fatty acid in each fraction could then be calculated. The data provided quantitative information on the relative specificity of incorporation of each fatty acid into each chylomicron lipid class and on the relative extent to which each fatty acid in each lipid fraction was diluted with endogenous fatty acid. With the exception of a slight discrimination against stearic acid, the processes of fatty acid absorption and chylomicron triglyceride formation displayed no specificity for one fatty acid relative to another. In contrast, chylomicron cholesterol ester formation showed marked specificity for oleic acid, relative to the other three fatty acids. This specificity was not significantly altered by varying the composition of the test meal, by including cholesterol in the test meal, or by feeding the animal a high-cholesterol diet for several weeks preceding the study. Considerable dilution of the dietary fatty acids with endogenous fatty acids was observed. In one experiment, 43% of the chylomicron triglyceride fatty acids was of endogenous origin. Relatively more (54%) of the cholesterol ester fatty acids was of endogenous origin.|$|R

In a villus we find (Figure IX., Sheet 3) a series of small blood-vessels and with it another vessel called a lacteal. The lacteals run together into larger and larger branches until they form a main trunk, the <b>thoracic</b> <b>duct,</b> which opens into the blood circulation at a point near the heart; but of this we shall speak further later.

60|$|Section 36. The chyle of the lacteals passes, {{as we have}} said, by the <b>thoracic</b> <b>duct</b> {{directly}} into the circulation. It enters the left vena cava superior (l.v.c.s.) near where this joins the jugular vein (ex.j.) (see Figure 1, Sheet 2, th.d.) and goes on at once {{with the rest of}} the blood to the heart. The small veins of the villi, however, which also help suck up the soluble nutritive material, are not directly continuous with the other body veins, the systemic veins; they belong to a special system, and, running together into larger and larger branches, form the lieno gastric (l.g.v.) and mesenteric (m.v.) veins, which unite to form the portal vein (p.v.) which enters the liver (l.v.) and there breaks up again into smaller and smaller branches. The very finest ramifications of this spreading network are called the (liver) capillaries, and these again unite to form at last the hepatic vein (h.v.) which enters the vena cava inferior (v.c.i.), a median vessel, running directly to the heart. This capillary network in the liver is probably connected with changes requisite before the recently absorbed materials can enter the general blood current.|$|E

40|$|The {{sites for}} {{formation}} of microbubbles that are routinely detected precordially by Doppler after a decompression {{are still a}} matter of debate. Firstly, microbubbles could form on the endothelial wall of capillaries, at specific nanometric sites, but the release mechanism of such small emerging entities remains puzzling. They might also be formed from pre-existing gas nuclei present in the blood when favourable local hydrodynamic/supersaturation conditions generate microcavitation and tribonucleation phenomena. Finally, tissues could represent large pools for microbubble formation and amplification. Nevertheless, it remains unexplained {{as to what the}} potential driving pathways might be. Knowing that the permeability of most of the blood capillary network is quite low, an alternative is proposed for such transport. The lymphatic system, which drains the interstitial fluid to guarantee the fluid balance of tissues, could allow the transfer of micrometric elements, like stabilized microbubbles formed in tissues, over long distances. These might then be reinjected into the bloodstream via the right lymphatic and <b>thoracic</b> <b>ducts.</b> The characteristics of this slow transport, activated by the muscular pump, could explain the detection of vascular gas emboli (VGE) over long periods. This hypothesis may give credence to a relatively old empirical finding of combat and commercial divers: that one should drive the boat fast to the dive site, but not on the way back, {{to reduce the risk of}} decompression sickness. These stories finally interested researchers enough to take a scientific look at why this happens. It was confirmed that 30 minutes of whole-body vibration before a dive (30 min, 30 msw) had preventive effects on post-dive bubble formation. As there was no observed change in flow-mediated dilatation after vibration, the authors concluded that a nitrogen monoxide-mediated mechanism was not involved; rather, a mechanical dislodgement or enhanced lymphatic elimination of gas nuclei was hypothesized. There are several possible explanations for this effect. Firstly, the vibrational force transmission to the whole-body should interact with the blood flow as well as the endothelium in order to eliminate the gas nuclei. In addition, vibrations may increase the blood friction forces on the endothelium favoring the detachment of gas micronuclei from the vascular wall. Vibrations should induce, by force transmission, a modification of endothelial spatial conformation. This modification should be responsible for a higher exposition of gas nuclei to the blood flow drag forces. Finally, the increase of lymphatic circulation, induced by vibration, would allow the elimination of a part of intercellular tissue micronuclei (Figure 1). In conclusion, the effectiveness of vibration on VGE elimination might be explained by the mechanical action of vibration on the endovascular and tissue localization of micronuclei. Other preconditioning situations showing positive effects on the number of post-dive vascular gas emboli also can be explained by increased lymphatic activity.
