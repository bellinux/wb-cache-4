5|$|Medusae swim by {{a form of}} jet propulsion: muscles, {{especially}} inside <b>the</b> <b>rim</b> <b>of</b> the bell, squeeze {{water out}} of the cavity inside the bell, and the springiness of the mesoglea powers the recovery stroke. Since the tissue layers are very thin, they provide too little power to swim against currents and just enough to control movement within currents.|$|E
5|$|Missouri {{returned}} to the United States via Diego Garcia, Australia, and Hawaii in early 1988. Several months later, Missouris crew again headed for Hawaiian waters for <b>the</b> <b>Rim</b> <b>of</b> the Pacific (RimPac) exercises, which involved more than 50,000 troops and ships from the navies of Australia, Canada, Japan, and the United States. Port visits in 1988 included Vancouver and Victoria in Canada, San Diego, Seattle, and Bremerton.|$|E
5|$|The galactic {{plane of}} the Milky Way passes through Perseus, but is much less obvious than {{elsewhere}} in the sky as it is mostly obscured by molecular clouds. The Perseus Arm is a spiral arm of the Milky Way galaxy and stretches across the sky from the constellation Cassiopeia through Perseus and Auriga to Gemini and Monoceros. This segment is towards <b>the</b> <b>rim</b> <b>of</b> the galaxy.|$|E

5|$|Zethus Crater is {{the largest}} (diameter about 40km) crater on and the only named surface feature of Jupiter's moon Thebe. There are several bright spots at <b>the</b> <b>rim</b> <b>of</b> this crater. It {{is located on the}} far side of Thebe, facing away from Jupiter. It was {{discovered}} by the Galileo spacecraft. It is named for Zethus, the husband of the nymph Thebe in Greek mythology.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the orbit}} of the Moon is tilted only 5° from the ecliptic, the {{interior}} of this crater lies in perpetual darkness. Estimates of the area in permanent shadow were obtained from Earth-based radar studies. Peaks along <b>the</b> <b>rim</b> <b>of</b> the crater are almost continually illuminated by sunlight, spending about 80–90% of each lunar orbit exposed to the Sun. Continuously illuminated mountains have been termed peaks of eternal light and have been predicted to exist since the 1900s.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} 1919, Mount Pleasant Road {{existed between}} St. Clair Avenue and Blythwood Road, ending at <b>the</b> <b>rim</b> <b>of</b> the Blythwood Ravine. Despite this, the road on the {{opposite}} rim was renamed from Sidmouth Avenue in 1920. Following {{the construction of the}} Vale of Avoca {{in the first half of}} the 1920s, the newly formed Toronto Transit Commission extended the St. Clair streetcar line east to Mount Pleasant Road December 1, 1924 and then north to Eglinton Avenue on November 4, 1925.|$|E
50|$|This crater lies across <b>the</b> eastern <b>rim</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> larger crater Orontius. <b>The</b> eastern <b>rim</b> <b>of</b> Huggins is laid {{across in}} turn by the {{slightly}} smaller crater Nasireddin. Thus these three craters form a triplet of decreasing age from west to east. To the northwest of Huggins is Miller, which {{is attached to}} <b>the</b> northern <b>rim</b> <b>of</b> Nasireddin.|$|R

5|$|NASA {{has named}} <b>the</b> <b>rim</b> <b>of</b> Shackleton as a {{potential}} candidate for its lunar outpost, slated to {{be up and running}} by 2020 and continuously staffed by a crew by 2024. The location would promote self-sustainability for lunar residents, as perpetual sunlight on the south pole would provide energy for solar panels. Furthermore, the shadowed polar regions are believed to contain the frozen water necessary for human consumption and could also be harvested for fuel manufacture.|$|E
5|$|On 11 September, OG North paused {{offensive}} operations {{while the}} 4th and 7th Guards Brigades moved into reserve. They were {{replaced with the}} 1st and the 2nd Guards Brigades of the HVO, which became the spearhead of OG North. A probing attack by the 2nd Guards Brigade achieved some gains towards Jajce along <b>the</b> <b>rim</b> <b>of</b> the Kupres Plateau. OGs South and West made another effort to capture Drvar, but were beaten back by VRS infantry supported by artillery and M-87 Orkan rockets.|$|E
5|$|Positioned at the {{national}} grid reference 35960865, Hampton Down Stone Circle {{is located on the}} southern edge of an open downland ridge at a height of 680 feet above sea level. Located 1 kilometre (0.6 miles) north-west of Portesham on private land, it is positioned on <b>the</b> <b>rim</b> <b>of</b> Portesham Hill and overlooks the coast. Had the vegetation levels been low {{at the time of the}} circle's creation then it would have permitted extensive panoramic views of the coastline. The site is a scheduled monument, and thus accorded legal protection under the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979.|$|E

5|$|She {{was next}} seen by Navy divers, the same year, lying upside {{down with her}} bow on <b>the</b> <b>rim</b> <b>of</b> the {{underwater}} bomb crater and stern angled toward the center. There {{was no sign of}} the superstructure or the big guns. The first diver to reach Arkansas sank up to his armpits in radioactive mud. When National Park Service divers returned in 1989 and 1990, the bottom was again firm-packed sand, and the mud was gone. They were able to see the barrels of the forward guns, which had not been visible in 1946.|$|E
5|$|The Antarctic scallop {{can swim}} rather slowly by {{opening and closing}} its valves. It {{advances}} in this way with <b>the</b> <b>rim</b> <b>of</b> the shell to the front. It can detect the movement of nearby objects with its rudimentary eyes and, in order to escape predators, can move much more swiftly umbones first, by clapping its valves shut. A remotely controlled camera stationed on the sea bed is apt to find that all the scallops that were originally in its field of view have moved off to other locations.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} perfect ring-shaped {{formation of}} the foramen spinosum was observed in the eighth month after birth and the latest seven years after birth in a developmental study of the foramen rotundum, foramen ovale and foramen spinosum. The majority of the foramina in the skull studies were round in shape. The sphenomandibular ligament, derived from the first pharyngeal arch and usually attached to {{the spine of the}} sphenoid bone, may be found attached to <b>the</b> <b>rim</b> <b>of</b> the foramen.|$|E

A total of eleven residences, three commercial structures, and 98 outbuildings were destroyed in the fire. A total of ten injuries from the wildfire were also reported, but no firefighters were killed during the suppression efforts which cost more than $127 million (2013 USD).|$|E
5|$|The most {{widespread}} form of Lucian work song is the chanté siay, which {{accompanies the}} sawing of wood. The vocals are {{performed by a}} lead singer and two responding singers, accompanied by a ka and tibwa duo. Both instruments are played in an atypical manner. The ka drum is played on the ground rather than upright, and the tibwa percussion sticks are struck against a bamboo or wooden stick rather than <b>the</b> <b>rim</b> <b>of</b> a drum.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>rim</b> <b>of</b> {{the central}} plain is vegetated by a dense shrubland of Rhagodia baccata (berry saltbush), Atriplex paludosa and Threlkeldia diffusa (coast bonefruit). Nearer the centre, the {{vegetation}} consists of Frankenia pauciflora (seaheath), Muellerolimon salicorniaceum and Tecticornia arbuscula (bulli bulli), although T.arbuscula {{is replaced by}} Tecticornia halocnemoides (shrubby samphire) where the soil is shallow. The most low-lying area of the central plain, south of the salt lake, is water-logged in winter; it is vegetated by a dense mat of Sarcocornia quinqueflora (beaded samphire), Sporobolus virginicus (marine couch) and Suaeda australis (seablite).|$|E

50|$|Paschen is a lunar crater on the {{far side}} of the Moon. The {{relatively}} large satellite crater Paschen M partly overlies <b>the</b> southern <b>rim</b> <b>of</b> Paschen, and they nearly form a merged pair with only a section of irregular terrain along their common border. The smaller but well-formed crater Paschen S lies across <b>the</b> southwestern <b>rim</b> <b>of</b> Paschen. As a result, most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> southern <b>rim</b> <b>of</b> Paschen is now gone.|$|R
