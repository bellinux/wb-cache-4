Cascioferro had been arrested some 69 times before and always had been acquitted, but this time it was different. After hearing the sentence the president of the court asked Cascioferro if he had something to say in his defense. Cascioferro stood up and said: [...] "Gentlemen, as you have been unable to obtain proof of any of the numerous crimes I have committed, you have been reduced to condemning me for <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>I</b> never committed."

500|$|Vocal Studies + Uprock Narratives {{was named}} {{as one of}} the best albums of 2001 by several publications, {{including}} Pitchfork, Ottawa Citizen and Rolling Stone. The Globe & Mail named it the seventh best album of the year, with Carl Wilson writing that [...] "of all the electronica-glich-IDM this year, [...] is <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>I</b> go back to as if it were the Rolling Stones." [...] In 2005, Pitchfork ranked the album the 84th best of 2000-2004. Herren was overwhelmed with the positive reception the album received, exclaiming that [...] "Most of it was so positive, but I'd also get a really strong reaction from people- some that want to kill me, 'cause they're under the impression that I'm trying to kill hip hop or something, and I'm like 'uh see ya, whatever man.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Rich Juzwiak {{noted that}} Beyoncé [...] "ecstatically and hyperactively" [...] changes keys four {{times during the}} entire song. As stated by Scott Shetler of PopCrush, she {{constantly}} sings praises of her love interest in the first verse where she also seemingly sends him subtle digs as he did not give her his full attention in the past, this being illustrated in lyrics such as, [...] "after fighting through my fears [...] finally you've put me first." [...] The chorus, complimented with sweet backing harmonies, then arrives, with Beyoncé chanting, [...] "Baby it's you, you're the one I love / You're the one I need / You're <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>I</b> see / Come on baby it's you / You're the one that gives your all / You're the one I can always call / When I need you make everything stop / Finally you put my love on top." [...] The chorus carries the final two minutes of the song through four key changes, proceeding to D♭, then to D, E♭ and finally to [...] E. This was highlighted by Henderson who wrote that [...] "the spirit carries both her and the song into a Stevie Wonder-reminiscent climax of continually rising key changes." [...] In this way, the word [...] "baby" [...] is said about 24 times throughout the song. As soon as the synthesizers drop out, the song fades out almost instantaneously.|$|E
500|$|Biographer Taraborrelli commented, [...] "Madonna {{had more}} {{confidence}} in her stage presence, her music was showing a deeper maturity, her voice was fuller, and the show was expertly choreographed with complex numbers. J. D. Considine from The Baltimore Sun commented, [...] "I've seen the Springsteen stadium tour, I've seen Dylan and the [...] Dead, and I was at Live Aid. Out of all those shows, Madonna's is <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>I</b> want to see again. You need a larger-than-life show {{if you want to}} come off in a stadium, and Madonna does. She's not that large physically, but she holds your attention." [...] Ann Ayers, assistant entertainment editor of USA Today felt that the show was high on glitz and low on emotional quotient. [...] "Madonna's going for a certain kind of show: a Broadway, show-biz, song-and-dance spectacle. In that context it's hard to make a connection with the audience, and I'd have to say that she didn't." [...] Peter Goddard from Toronto Star reviewed the concert in CNE Stadium and said, [...] "Madonna proved that she may be a lost girl in the roads of life, like her film, but she ain't lost when she is singing. Especially during songs like 'Papa Don't Preach', her vocal prowess was substantially notable." [...] Scott A Zamost and Elizabeth Snead, writing for Chicago Tribune, felt that [...] "For the most part, the premiere concert on Madonna's Who's That Girl tour was a success, an extravaganza of multiple videos, flashing lights and precision dancing. If the high-tech accoutrements and inferior sound system made it difficult to hear the singer, one hopes that will be refined as the tour continues across the United States. [...] As a dancer, Madonna is supreme on stage. Her trademark skip to a funky beat highlighted the constant acrobatics. One minute she was stage left, another minute stage right. She ran up a wide staircase center stage to party with her three back-up singers, then scooted down to the stage floor, swinging her hips, accompanied by other dancers." ...|$|E

2500|$|Nightingale {{suggested}} that the storyline [...] "echoed" [...] the assertion that a woman cannot be trusted {{to make her own}} decision about abortion, which she describes as profoundly undermining and a [...] "subtle" [...] reinforcement of an [...] "underlying implication" [...] that women should be punished for exercising their legal right. She comments, [...] "I am confused by the writers' unswerving insistence on her absolute certainty that abortion was the right choice for her, until the very last moment – such portrayals smack of her finally 'seeing the light'. Had the Natalie presented been a confused or uncertain woman, her change of heart would have seemed infinitely more credible, but she was neither. In fact, the very plausibility of the script was sacrificed, presumably to make a point – and <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>I</b> can dig out is that of the dangers of going through with an abortion, even if you think you're sure – come on, what do you know?".|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the species}} {{described}} in [...] was [...] "Papilio ecclipsis". This {{was based on a}} specimen sent by William Charlton to James Petiver in 1702, who wrote: [...] "It exactly resembles our English Brimstone Butterfly (R. Rhamni), were it not for those black spots and apparent blue moons on the lower wings. This is <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>I</b> have seen." [...] Carl Linnaeus examined the butterfly, and named it Papilio ecclipsis in Centuria Insectorum Rariorum, including it in his [...] from the 12th edition (1767) onwards. It was not until 1793 that the hoax was discovered by Johan Christian Fabricius, who recognised that the dark patches had been painted on, and that the specimen was a common brimstone butterfly (now called Gonepteryx rhamni). Although the curator at the British Museum [...] "indignantly stamped the specimen to pieces" [...] when he found out, William Jones created two replicas to replace the lost specimen.|$|E
2500|$|Kelly Clarkson {{was born}} in Fort Worth, Texas, to Jeanne Ann (née Rose), a first grade English teacher, and Stephen Michael Clarkson, a former engineer. She is the {{youngest}} of three children with a brother named Jason and a sister named Alyssa. Clarkson also has two younger half brothers from her father's second marriage. Her parents divorced when she was six years old, wherein her brother went to go live with their father, her sister {{went to live with}} an aunt and she stayed with her mother. Clarkson's mother later remarried, to Jimmy Taylor. Her ancestry is Greek (from a maternal great-grandfather), Welsh, English, Irish, German, and Scottish. Her mother is a descendant of Republican state senator Isaiah Rose, whose life story was discussed on Clarkson's episode of Who Do You Think You Are?, in 2013. Clarkson was raised Southern Baptist. She has said: [...] "I always grew up in church. I was the leader of our youth group. I’ve always grown up pretty close to church and with God. But I think I’ve just gotten a lot closer just because He’s <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>I</b> can lean on."

2500|$|Although {{the band}} began work with Tony Hoffer producing, {{the album was}} {{produced}} by Stephen Street (The Smiths, Blur). Overall, seven different recording studios and four producers were used during the two years spent recording A New Morning, with costs estimated at around £1million. The album was a commercial disappointment which failed to enter the top 20 and it was never released in the US. A New Morning sharply divided fans of the band {{even more so than}} Head Music and critical reaction was decidedly lukewarm. Furthermore, the mainstream public interest had long disappeared. Only two singles, [...] "Positivity" [...] and [...] "Obsessions", were released, the fewest singles taken from any of the band's albums, and neither charted particularly well. Anderson has since stressed his disappointment with Suede's final album, stating [...] "We made one Suede album too many. 'A New Morning' is <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>I</b> don't believe in as much as the other Suede records and I totally believed in the first four, even 'Head Music' which divided the fans." [...] Mat Osman told journalist Jon Cronshaw in October 2013 that: [...] "“It sounded like a Suede album that had been made by a committee – it was quite bland. We’re all quite ashamed of it". Anderson went further in his criticism in 2016, saying: [...] "It’s a poor record and we should never have released it." ...|$|E

2500|$|Gladstone became {{concerned}} with the situation of [...] "coal whippers". These were the men who worked on London docks, [...] "whipping" [...] in baskets from ships to barges or wharves all incoming coal from the sea. They were called up and relieved through public-houses and therefore a man could not get this job unless he possessed the favourable opinion of the publican, who looked upon most favourably those who drank. The man's name was written down and the [...] "score" [...] followed. Publicans issued employment solely on {{the capacity of the}} man to pay, and men often left the pub to work drunk. They spent their savings on drink to secure the favourable opinion of publicans and therefore further employment. Gladstone passed the Coal Vendors Act 1843 to set up a central office for employment. When this Act expired in 1856 a Select Committee was appointed by the Lords in 1857 to look into the question. Gladstone gave evidence to the Committee: [...] "I approached the subject in the first instance as I think everyone in Parliament of necessity did, with the strongest possible prejudice against the proposal but the facts stated were of so extraordinary and deplorable a character, {{that it was impossible to}} withhold attention from them. Then the question being whether legislative interference was required I was at length induced to look at a remedy of an extraordinary character as <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>I</b> thought applicable to the case...it was a great innovation". Looking back in 1883, Gladstone wrote that [...] "In principle, perhaps my Coalwhippers Act of 1843 was the most Socialistic measure of the last half century".|$|E
