40|$|Those {{in academia}} who have {{presented}} compelling {{evidence of the}} interactions between the Iroquois Confederacy and the founders of <b>the</b> <b>American</b> Constitution which plausibly points {{to the impact of}} the former on the latter, have been pilloried by their colleagues. While {{there seems to be no}} dispute within academia that the Iroquois political system embodied (and continues to embody) many characteristics that we might associate with liberal democracy (e. g., political representation, gender equality, individual freedoms), charges are still made that claims about the influence of the Iroquois on <b>the</b> <b>American</b> political system are unscholarly, without rigour, dogmatic, lacking in ‘objectivity’, and a practice of ‘myth-making’.

40|$|English Department Honors Thesis. I {{argue that}} one of the most major focuses in Toni Morrison’s novels is the {{exploration}} of trauma, specifically the forms of trauma that have afflicted <b>the</b> African <b>American</b> community. Although Morrison’s novels predominantly feature African American characters and communities, the traumatic events she explores, including active combat, domestic abuse, and deadly accidents, transcend racial boundaries. Trauma can be universal, and thus the arguments about trauma that emerge from Morrison’s novels, while certainly having significance in a racial discussion, should be thought about in universal terms as well. Morrison’s novels are thus tools with which to reflect on the implications of trauma in a global sense, and to investigate how descriptions of trauma are informed by—and even respond to—the historical moment in which they were written. While there are many ways of expressing and relating trauma, I will focus on Morrison’s literary portrayal of mental illness, specifically post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). I will evaluate this issue in three of Morrison’s novels: Sula, Beloved, and Home. Morrison’s novels feature an abundance of mentally ill characters, which can be explained by the fact that mental illness is both a common physiological byproduct of trauma and a means of psychological detachment from unbearable traumatic realities. Morrison does not depict trauma merely to show its insidious presence in <b>the</b> African <b>American</b> <b>psyche,</b> and does not explore mental illness merely to demonize the systems and prejudices that instilled it. Instead, her novels offer complex meditations on the network of factors that give rise to mental illness over time, the treatment options available to victims of mental illness at the narrative present, and the impact of mental illness on both the individual and the community.

40|$|This thesis interrogates {{the part}} {{played by the}} figure of ‘the Indian’ in the {{formation}} of the U. S. national consciousness as reflected in the nineteenth-century fictional works of James Fenimore Cooper, Robert Montgomery Bird, Lydia Maria Child, Helen Hunt Jackson and Herman Melville. I propose that new understandings can be reached concerning Indian representations and national identity in the selected texts via an approach that combines postcolonial and psychoanalytic theories, in particular as detailed by Ranjana Khanna in Dark Continents (2003). I explore how the national ideals articulated by Cooper, Bird, Child and Jackson are predicated on repression identifiable in historical revisionism, disavowal, ideological rhetoric, generic conventions and so forth, which reflects a melancholic nationalism more generally concerning the colonial subjugation of Native Americans. I demonstrate that where the national origins mythology of The Last of the Mohicans is ‘haunted’ by inassimilable historical memories associated with frontier conquest and displacement, the Indian-hating premise of Bird’s Nick of the Woods is yet more melancholic in being overwhelmed by the genocide it seeks to justify. In contrast, Ramona and Hobomok effectuate their own forms of epistemic violence in assimilating the Indian into the national body. However these novels also allow for the principle of an autonomous Indian perspective, which jeopardises the idea of state legitimacy that is crucial for their national ideals. In Melville’s The Confidence-Man a historically recuperative national vision is absent and this allows indirect recognition of the Indian ‘phantoms’ of the nation’s past. These works encompass psychological, ideological and cultural patterns of negotiation with a Native American presence that reflect different facets of <b>the</b> nineteenth-century <b>American</b> <b>psyche</b> and its evolution. My readings of these patterns provide a new perspective on how <b>the</b> nineteenth-century <b>American</b> national consciousness is unable to reconcile its history of imperialist, frontier expansion to its ‘ego-ideal’ as a democratic institution distinguished from its European predecessors...|$|R

30|$|Indeed, the {{position}} of Native <b>Americans</b> in <b>the</b> national, white <b>American</b> <b>psyche</b> is ambiguous, grounded in two interlocked traditions of self-criticism and conquest (Deloria 1998). ‘Non-Indians’ seem to narrate their own present against what they constructed as a backdrop of the past, symbolized by Native American people and their culture (O’Brien 2010). The previous notion {{is closely related to}} how the idea of race was conceptualized in a North American context, placing some people in a natural situation of inferiority compared to others, to legitimate the relation of conquest and domination which was constructed throughout more than four centuries. Drawing on a Hegelian conception of history as linear, settlers from European origin considered themselves as superior and representing ‘modernity’. Even though they needed indigenous people from the beginning to survive and then settle down on the continent, colonizers built a hierarchy where indigenous were inferior and denied political and cultural sovereignty (Quijano 2000). In spite of the traumatizing events which ensued from the implementation of that ideology, and its translation into concrete policies like removal or erasure, American Indians have been practicing resilience to large-scale and long-term adversity (Reinschmidt 2016), and in 2015, more than 500 Nations were still officially recognized by the United States government, while almost seven million people were self-identifying as being American Indian or Alaska Natives, mixed or not (www.census.gov).|$|R
