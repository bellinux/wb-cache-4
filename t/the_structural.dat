5|$|Study of <b>the</b> <b>structural</b> {{colouration}} of {{the wing}} scales of swallowtail butterflies {{led to the development}} of more efficient light-emitting diodes. <b>The</b> <b>structural</b> colouration of butterflies is inspiring nanotechnology research to produce paints that do not use toxic pigments and in the development of new display technologies.|$|E
5|$|Surface gratings, {{consisting}} on ordered surface features due {{exposure of}} ordered muscle cells on cuts of meat. <b>The</b> <b>structural</b> coloration on meat cuts appears {{only after the}} ordered pattern of muscle fibrils is exposed and light is diffracted by the proteins in the fibrils. The coloration or wavelength of the diffracted light depends on the angle of observation and can be enhanced by covering the meat with translucent foils. Roughening the surface or removing water content by drying causes the structure to collapse, thus, <b>the</b> <b>structural</b> coloration to disappear.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: <b>The</b> wood-plastic <b>structural</b> plates, {{which were}} made of {{polyethylene}} (PE) and poplar powder, were used in decking as a structural material. It is of great significance to analyze the material reliability for the safety in service. In this paper, the modulus of elasticity and static bending strength of specimens were obtained through test, the first order second moment method (FOSM) was {{used to analyze the}} reliability of <b>the</b> wood-plastic <b>structural</b> plates. <b>The</b> result showed that <b>the</b> wood-plastic <b>structural</b> plates have a better reliability, and the reliability of <b>the</b> wood-plastic <b>structural</b> plates was related to the thickness of the specimens...|$|R

5|$|By {{the early}} twentieth century {{scientists}} had come to believe that cells are surrounded by a thin oil-like barrier, but <b>the</b> <b>structural</b> nature of this membrane was not known. Two experiments in 1925 laid the groundwork to fill in this gap. By measuring the capacitance of erythrocyte solutions, Hugo Fricke determined that the cell membrane was 3.3nm thick.|$|E
5|$|D mode {{is present}} in all graphite-like carbons and {{originates}} from structural defects. Therefore, {{the ratio of the}} G/D modes is conventionally used to quantify <b>the</b> <b>structural</b> quality of carbon nanotubes. High-quality nanotubes have this ratio significantly higher than 100. At a lower functionalisation of the nanotube, the G/D ratio remains almost unchanged. This ratio gives an idea of the functionalisation of a nanotube.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{this shift}} in thought about the {{underlying}} mechanisms in plantar fasciitis, many in the academic community have stated the condition should be renamed plantar fasciosis. <b>The</b> <b>structural</b> breakdown of the plantar fascia {{is believed to be}} the result of repetitive microtrauma (small tears). Microscopic examination of the plantar fascia often shows myxomatous degeneration, connective tissue calcium deposits, and disorganized collagen fibers.|$|E

25|$|In the mid-1980s, {{demand for}} <b>the</b> plant's <b>structural</b> {{products}} began to diminish, and new competition entered the marketplace.

5|$|FETA {{began to}} be {{concerned}} over <b>the</b> <b>structural</b> wear of the bridge in the 21st century. The planned theoretical capacity for the bridge (30,000vehicles per day in each direction) was routinely exceeded as traffic levels outstripped predictions. The Scottish Government stated in 2006 that 60,000vehicles travelled on {{more than half the}} days in a year. This raised concerns about the lifespan of the bridge, originally planned at 120 years.|$|E
