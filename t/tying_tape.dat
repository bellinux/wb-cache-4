5000|$|Tall (1.15 meter/4 foot) slim (10 cm/4 inch) {{fluorescent}} red {{or orange}} plastic bollards with reflective tape and removable heavy rubber bases are frequently used in road traffic control where traffic cones {{would be inappropriate}} due to their width and ease of movement. Also referred to as [...] "delineators", the bases are usually made from recycled rubber, and can be easily glued to the road surface to resist movement following minor impacts from passing traffic. The term [...] "T-top bollards" [...] refers to the T-bar moulded into the top for <b>tying</b> <b>tape.</b> Bollards are regarded as an economical and safe delineation system for motorways and busy arterial roads; and, in conjunction with plastic tape, for pedestrian control.|$|E

40|$|Patients with burns {{are at risk}} of inhaling {{superheated}} gases. Signs, {{which include}} singeing of the nasal hair, carbon deposition around the nose or oral cavity, and changes in the voice, may herald potential embarrassment of the airway. This should be urgently assessed by a senior anaesthetist for consideration of an early definitive airway, 1 which necessitates placement of a cuffed tube fixed in the lumen of the trachea. Traditionally, the tube is secured by <b>ties</b> or <b>tapes</b> fastened around the patient's lower face, and neck...|$|R
5000|$|Multicable is {{used when}} {{technicians}} need to mount lights where no permanent circuiting options exist. Typically, mounting pipes designed for lighting use have enclosed raceways with permanent power outlets, running {{to a remote}} [...] unit somewhere in the theater. When such options are not available, technicians have to run cable to these positions instead. Originally, {{it had to be}} done with cable bundles, running single extension cords long distances and <b>tying</b> or <b>taping</b> them into groups, or just running cable in a disorganized mess.|$|R

60|$|The ottoman whence, as Gavinia said, Miss Ailie {{produced}} the presents she gave to Mr. McLean, {{stood near the}} door of the blue-and-white room, with a reel of thread between, to keep them apart forever. Except on washing days it was of a genteel appearance, for though but a wooden kist, it had a gay outer garment with frills, which Gavinia starched, and beneath this was apparel of a private character that <b>tied</b> with <b>tapes.</b> When Miss Ailie, pins in her mouth, was on her knees arraying the ottoman, it might almost have been mistaken for a female child.|$|R
30|$|One of the {{strengths}} {{of this study is}} the use of matched human tissue for both the bony and soft components. Magen et al. [31] suggested that animal tissue should not be used to estimate the performance of interference screw fixation in human tissue, and while Colderidge and Amis [27] used bovine tissue, they also stated that younger human cadaveric tibia would have been ideal. In an uncontrolled 7 -mm tape and 10 -mm screw biomechanical study, Collette et al. [14] utilized cadaveric tissue; however, they used femoral heads, rather than cadaveric tibia, which would have had very different bone density and corticocancellous structure from a tibia. The only other study to use cadaveric tibia in a tape and screw study to date is that of Birmingham et al. [23], who reported mean failure load of 136  N (± 136  N) with a 10 -mm screw, compared with 288  N (± 77  N) for the comparator Endobutton group. When they used a larger 12 -mm screw and <b>tied</b> the <b>tape</b> over an additional button, they achieved a statistically significantly greater mean failure load of 668  N (± 278  N), with the additional cortical fixation. It should be noted that we <b>tied</b> the <b>tape</b> over an 11 -mm screw, rather than to an additional button, hence we did not gain cortical fixation. They reported greater stiffness in the larger screw–button–tape group than the standard screw–tape group and comparator Endobutton group, but the same migration.|$|R

Ann asks Peter why he does not kill them directly, and Peter replies {{that they should not}} forget the fun of games. Ann {{attempts}} to be freed by George in an absence of Peter but fails to make it before his return and is beaten again. Ann begs him to let them go, but Peter refuses. When found, Georgie attempts to shoot Paul with a shotgun, but the gun fails to go off. Paul returns him to the living room, along with the shotgun.|$|R

50|$|The third style, called Etchū fundoshi, which {{originated}} {{in the vicinity of}} Toyama Prefecture, is a long rectangle of cloth with tapes at one narrow end. Etchū fundoshi is a length of cloth, however it has a strip of material at the waist to form a fastening or string. The dimensions are 14 inches width by about 40 inches length, and it is tied with the material strip in front of the body. One <b>ties</b> the <b>tapes</b> around the hips, with the cloth at the small of the back, and then pulls the cloth between the legs and through the belt, letting the remainder hang as an apron. Such fundoshi were issued to Japanese troops in World War II, and often were the sole garb of Allied POWs in tropic areas.|$|R
50|$|Polo ponies {{have their}} manes hogged and their tails plaited up before a match, {{so that the}} polo mallet will not get tangled in them. Formerly, their tails would be docked and banged. Today, polo ponies in {{competition}} often have their dock trimmed or shaved, and the skirt of the tail is braided and folded up against the tailbone. The braid is tied off with a lock of hair excluded from the braid, <b>taped,</b> or <b>tied</b> off and <b>taped.</b>|$|R
30|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} an alternative method of tape–screw construct fixation using full-length outside-in created tibial tunnels with <b>tape</b> <b>tied</b> over the screw for additional fixation. This alternative method would offer a graft tibial fixation option to surgeons who wished to preoperatively utilize a quadrupled ST graft to avoid harvesting the gracilis, or intraoperatively if a harvested gracilis tendon was inadequate in diameter or length to be used, while utilizing a fixed suspensory fixation device on the femur.|$|R

6000|$|One day she chanced {{to be in}} the schoolroom with Henry Sympson, whose amiable and affectionate {{disposition}} {{had quickly}} recommended him to her regard. The boy was busied about some mechanical contrivance; his lameness made him fond of sedentary occupation. He began to ransack his tutor's desk for a piece of wax or twine necessary to his work. Moore happened to be absent. Mr. Hall, indeed, had called for him to take a long walk. Henry could not immediately find the object of his search. He rummaged compartment after compartment; and at last, opening an inner drawer, he came upon--not a ball of cord or a lump of beeswax, but a little bundle of small marble-coloured cahiers, <b>tied</b> with <b>tape.</b> Henry looked at them. [...] "What rubbish Mr. Moore stores up in his desk!" [...] he said. [...] "I hope he won't keep my old exercises so carefully." ...|$|R

50|$|In air {{layering}} (or marcotting), the target region is wounded by an upward 4 cm long cut and held {{open with a}} toothpick or similar, or a strip of bark is removed. The wound is then surrounded with a lump of moisture-retaining medium such as sphagnum moss or cloth, and then further surrounded by a moisture barrier such as plastic film <b>tied</b> or <b>taped</b> to the branch to prevent moisture loss or ingress of too much water as from rain. Rooting hormone is often applied to the wound to encourage root growth. When sufficient roots have grown from the wound, the stem {{is removed from the}} parent plant and planted, taking care to shield it from too much sun and to protect it from drying out until the new roots take hold. It can take the layer from a few weeks to one or more growing seasons to produce sufficient roots; this is largely dependent on the plant species and the vigor of the parent plant.|$|R
