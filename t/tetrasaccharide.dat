To generate inhibitors, modifications of the glycan structure can be introduced. Conjugation of hydrophobic compounds to saccharides has proven to be promising as increased binding of galectin- 3 can be observed. In the present study, we report on neo-glycans carrying hydrophobic biotin as novel ligands for human galectin- 3. We modified N-acetyllactosamine- and N,N-diacetyllactosamine-based <b>tetrasaccharides</b> at the C 6 -position of the terminal saccharide unit using selective enzymatic oxidation and subsequent chemical conjugation of biotinamidohexanoic acid hydrazide.

We generated multivalent neo-glycoproteins by conjugation of neo-glycans to bovine serum albumin showing high affinity for galectin- 3. Compared to non-biotinylated neo-glycoproteins, we achieved high binding levels of galectin- 3 with a lesser amount of conjugated neo-glycans.
