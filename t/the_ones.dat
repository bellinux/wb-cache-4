50|$|Plotinus {{speaks about}} the {{generation}} of Intellect from <b>the</b> <b>One,</b> and Intellect's attempt to return to <b>the</b> <b>One</b> in a thinking {{which is also a}} desiring.

Intellect remains in <b>the</b> <b>One,</b> which means that it has <b>the</b> <b>One</b> as its origin. It proceeds from <b>the</b> <b>One,</b> which means that it comes to be as a separate entity. But it returns to <b>the</b> <b>One,</b> which means that it doesn't cut itself off from its source, but receives the good which is its identity from <b>the</b> <b>One.</b> This threefold motion is used by Proclus to structure all levels of his system below <b>the</b> <b>One</b> and above material reality, so that all things except those mentioned remain, proceed, and return.|$|R

50|$|Hypothesis n. 1: If it is <b>one.</b> <b>The</b> <b>one</b> {{cannot be}} made up of parts, because then <b>the</b> <b>one</b> would be made of many. Nor can it be a whole, because wholes are made of parts. Thus <b>the</b> <b>one</b> has no parts and is not a whole. It has not a beginning, a middle nor an end because these are parts, it is {{therefore}} unlimited. It has no shape because it is neither linear nor circular: a circle has parts all equidistant from the centre, but <b>the</b> <b>one</b> has no parts nor a centre; It is not a line because a line has a middle and two extremes, which <b>the</b> <b>one</b> cannot have. Thus <b>the</b> <b>one</b> has no shape. <b>The</b> <b>one</b> cannot be in anything nor in itself. If it was in another it would be all surrounded and by what it is inside and would be touched at many parts by what contains it, but <b>the</b> <b>one</b> has no parts and thus cannot be inside something else. If it were in itself it would contain itself, but if it is contained then it is different from what contains it and thus <b>the</b> <b>one</b> would be two. <b>The</b> <b>one</b> cannot move because movement is change or change in position. It cannot change because it has no parts to change. If it moves position it moves either circularly or linearly. If it spins in place its outer part revolves around its middle but <b>the</b> <b>one</b> has neither. If it moves its position it moves through something else, which it cannot be inside. Thus <b>the</b> <b>one</b> does not move. <b>The</b> <b>one</b> must be itself and cannot be different from it. <b>The</b> <b>one</b> does not take part in the flowing of time so it is imperishable.|$|R
