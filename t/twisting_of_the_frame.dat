40|$|AbstractCurrently a {{substantial}} amount of cycling research and training is conducted in sports science laboratories utilising cycle ergometers and/or turbo trainers. These devices have been widely used within cycling research, however, they {{have been found to be}} difficult to set-up and adjust, particularly whilst in use as well as to replicate a force profile similar to that experienced when competing. This study details the development of a novel cycle ergometer that incorporates automatic bike set-up and adjustment. The ergometer was designed in accordance with a design specification developed through the use of needs analysis of elite cyclists and performance scientists. The user analysis identified a need for increased adjustability (seat height (SH), seat set back (SS), handlebar drop (HD) and handlebar reach (HBR)) and positioning accuracy, whilst maximising the stability and stiffness of the frame when conducting maximal effort trials particularly at the bottom bracket. The novel ergometer incorporates two lifting columns to provide HD adjustment from 411 mm to 868 mm and SH adjustment from 568 mm to 928 mm. The two lifting columns were mounted on two linear rails to provide horizontal adjustment of the handlebars relative to the seat, and seat relative to the bottom bracket. The motors on both the lifting columns and linear rails were fitted with HTL encoders, increasing the positioning accuracy to+/- 0. 1 mm. An anti-coast brake was also fitted to prevent the lifting columns or linear rails from slipping whilst in use. When comparing existing set up time, adjusting from the largest to smallest set-up, current ergometers can take up to 30 minutes, whereas the new ergometer takes 8 seconds. To minimise <b>twisting</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>frame</b> during maximal effort cycling, the bottom bracket has been mounted on a 65 mm x 65 mm square column. Finite element analysis of the structure identified that it would remain stable whilst subjected to up to 800 Nm of torque. In conclusion the development of the novel ergometer allows for greater adjustability, speed of set-up and maximise frame stability during use...|$|E
40|$|The twist is a {{fundamental}} geometric property of nucleic acids. Calculation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>twist</b> in the most general case requires detailed specification <b>of</b> <b>the</b> three-dimensional path <b>of</b> each strand, but many important cases may be analyzed by considering only the twist difference. If C 1, C 2, and C 3 are three distinct space curves, the twist difference about C 1 is defined as Tw(C 3, C 1) - Tw(C 2, C 1). We show here that this difference measures <b>the</b> rotation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> correspondence surface joining C 1 to C 2 about the correspondence surface joining C 1 to C 3. This result has application to DNA containing local nonuniformities, such as denatured regions, cruciforms, and other altered structures. It also facilitates <b>the</b> calculation <b>of</b> <b>twist</b> for three-stranded structures, including D-loops in mitochondrial DNA and replication and transcription intermediates. The twist difference may {{also be used to}} simplify greatly <b>the</b> analysis <b>of</b> <b>twist</b> changes in duplex DNA due to winding on surfaces, such as histones and certain enzymes. In such cases <b>the</b> strand-axis <b>twist</b> <b>of</b> DNA divides into two independent terms. The first term arises from <b>the</b> <b>twist</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> local reference <b>frame,</b> and <b>the</b> second arises from <b>the</b> rotation <b>of</b> either strand about the duplex axis as measured in <b>the</b> local reference <b>frame.</b> Twist changes consequent to nucleosome winding, for example, arise from <b>the</b> <b>twist</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nucleosome axis, a straight line, about the DNA axis plus <b>the</b> rotation <b>of</b> either strand <b>of</b> <b>the</b> DNA about its axis in <b>the</b> reference <b>frame</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cylinder...|$|R

40|$|Mechanical {{properties}} such as load-deflection {{relationship and}} modulus <b>of</b> rigidity on <b>the</b> <b>twisting</b> <b>of</b> yarn in stationary state {{have been studied}} by many researchers. But on <b>the</b> <b>twisting</b> <b>of</b> yarn in rnnning state there are few fundamental studies, experimental or theoretical, except Tobisch 2 ̆ 7 s theory. Tobisch derived his theory {{on the assumption that}} <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> <b>twists</b> <b>of</b> yarn per unit length, or twist density, was uniform everywhere in the twisting field, but this is true only when the delivery velocity is very small or <b>the</b> internal friction <b>of</b> yarn is negligible. The author has made theoretical and experimental studies on <b>the</b> <b>twisting</b> <b>of</b> yarn in running state, considering it as a visco-elastic body made of homogeneous and uniform materials. The studies may be briefly summerized in the following outline. 　(1) A yarn of total length L is fixed at both ends. This yarn is divided into two parts, <b>the</b> length l <b>of</b> it being <b>twisted</b> and the other length L-l free from twisting. If a point fixed between these two parts is suddenly released, twisting will be transmitted to the untwisted part. <b>The</b> theory <b>of</b> this transient transmission <b>of</b> <b>twisting</b> has been treated by solving the following partial differential equation :　p(∂^ 2 θ/∂t^ 2) = G(∂^ 2 θ/∂x^ 2) + η(∂^ 3 θ/∂t∂x^ 2) 　where p = <b>the</b> density <b>of</b> yarn　θ = angle of torsion at x along the yarn　t = time G = modulus of rigidity of yarn. 　η = tangential coefficient <b>of</b> viscosity at <b>the</b> cross section <b>of</b> yarn. 　In <b>the</b> case under consideration, let <b>the</b> angles <b>of</b> torsion along <b>the</b> yarn and at <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lenght l be Θ and θ_ 0 respectively. Then the following relation holds : θ=Θ-θ_(0 x) /L. <b>The</b> solution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> above differential equation by <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> this relation and initial and boundary conditions in this case has shown that <b>the</b> <b>twist</b> density <b>of</b> yarn transmitted to the untwisted part is exponentially increased with time and approaches to θ_ 0 /L. 　(2) A high speed camera by which 64 pictures could be taken per second was used in order to confirm the above theory. The results measured coincided satisfactorily with the theory. 　(3) When the yarn was fixed at one end and free at the other and the twisting moment was applied at the free end, the above differential equation was solved under the initial and boundary conditions in this case. <b>The</b> <b>twist</b> density <b>of</b> yarn in this transient case also approaches exponentially to θ_ 0 /L with time. 　(4) In the running yarn, <b>the</b> following transformation <b>of</b> coordinates was used : x=ξ+vt, where v is <b>the</b> velocity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> running yarn, x is a fixed coordinate in yarn and ξ is in space. By solving this transformed equation, {{it has been shown that}} <b>the</b> <b>twist</b> density <b>of</b> running yarn with only internal friction is in steady state exponentially decreased from the twisting element, say <b>the</b> aperture <b>of</b> flyer, to <b>the</b> nip point <b>of</b> delivery roller. 　(5) Also by <b>the</b> solution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> above transformed equation, Ball 2 ̆ 7 s distribution diagram <b>of</b> <b>twist</b> in <b>the</b> <b>twisting</b> fields <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ring <b>frame</b> and mule has proved to be the distributed one in a case when the yarn is considered as a visco-elastic body with solid friction. 　(6) In the yarn with plasticity, the twisting field is divied into two Zones : an elastic zone ξ= 0 -ξ_ 1. and a plastic zone ξ=ξ_ 1 -L. <b>The</b> equations <b>of</b> <b>twist</b> density in elastic and plastic zones have been derived under considerations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> boundary conditions. An experiment <b>of</b> <b>twisting</b> rayon yarn with <b>the</b> flyer <b>frame</b> showed that these twe zones occurred and could be explained by substituting appropriate numerical values into the above derived equations. 　(7) When <b>the</b> internal friction <b>of</b> yarn is negligible or <b>the</b> delivery velocity <b>of</b> yarn is very small, Tobisch 2 ̆ 7 s theory is applicable. So, in such a state, <b>the</b> double <b>twisting</b> principle <b>of</b> tyre cord has been analyzed by this theory. 　(8) <b>The</b> re-distribution <b>of</b> <b>twists</b> in <b>the</b> twisting field by <b>the</b> invasion <b>of</b> <b>twisted</b> yarn into <b>the</b> untwisted field or by its regression from the twisting field with <b>the</b> introduction <b>of</b> untwisted yarn is occasionally important in spinning operation, especially in false <b>twisting</b> <b>of</b> worsted spinning and rotating funnel of high draft system in cotton spinning. <b>The</b> state <b>of</b> this re-distribution was experimentally studied by photographing the twisting operation in one twisting field, and the results measured could be qualitatively explained by the above described theorics. 　(9) <b>The</b> permanent deformations <b>of</b> <b>twisted</b> yarn set by steam or initially applied tension were studied by measuring the free rotating angle about <b>the</b> axis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> yarn loaded axially. According to these experiments, the permanent sets are 0 - 28...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{presents}} the basic requirements for transport vehicles. A special request regarding <b>the</b> adaptation <b>of</b> transport vehicles for <b>the</b> transport <b>of</b> {{various types of}} cargo was taken into consideration. Superstructures and the situation arising after mounting superstructures on wheeled transport vehicles were analyzed and the following was described: console coupling, stirrups, simplex elastic coupling, two-way elastic and rigid connection elements. Vehicle torsional elasticity is provided by a proper choice <b>of</b> <b>the</b> type <b>of</b> connection between <b>the</b> superstructure and the vehicle chassis. Applying <b>the</b> instructions <b>of</b> vehicle manufacturers for using appropriate connections between the truck superstructure and the vehicle chassis provides positive torsional elasticity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vehicle. The paper gives <b>the</b> general recommendations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Volvo, Mercedes and Renault transport vehicle producers for <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> particular connection types of locations as well as structural requirements for <b>the</b> mounting <b>of</b> concrete mixers, tippers and truck tanks on their vehicles. Introduction Achieving {{a high level of}} transport effectiveness depends on a number of factors. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most important ones is the possibility to increase the payload share in the gross vehicle weight. This share depends on the net vehicle weight, a method <b>of</b> coupling <b>the</b> truck superstructure with <b>the</b> chassis <b>frame</b> {{as well as on the}} truck superstructure construction. Realization of this requirement is of significant importance, particularly for large business systems since it results in <b>the</b> reduction <b>of</b> number of necessary vehicles, more economic fleet maintenance and the fleet capacity increase. It is also relatively easy to adapt the vehicle for <b>the</b> transportation <b>of</b> other loads, depending on user's current needs. The adaptation is correctly performed if manufacturer's recommendations are followed during <b>the</b> mounting <b>of</b> <b>the</b> superstructure on the chassis. This paper gives <b>the</b> analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> types <b>of</b> coupling used for particular truck superstructures. Types of truck superstructure A truck superstructure is generally a torsionally stiffer structure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vehicle chassis and by its mounting on <b>the</b> vehicle main <b>frame</b> <b>the</b> torsion stiffness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> whole vehicle increases. In order to retain the vehicle torsional elasticity because of its positive reaction to strain, it is necessary to apply a particular type of coupling for a particular type of truck superstructure. Regarding the torsional stiffness, truck superstructures can be divided into three groups: 1. Torsionally elastic 2. Torsionally semielastic 3. Torsionally rigid Connection <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chassis and the truck superstructure In order to retain the vehicle torsional elasticity because of its positive reaction to strain, it is necessary to apply a particular type of coupling for a particular type of truck superstructure: Panel connection Panel connection allows longitudinal motion and prevents lateral or vertical motion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chassis runner in relation to <b>the</b> main vehicle <b>frame.</b> Stirrup (U bolt) connection Stirrup connections enable longitudinal motion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chassis runner in relation to <b>the</b> main <b>frame</b> but they cannot accept lateral forces, so additional leading plates are mounted for that purpose. Simplex elastic connection Simplex elastic connections enable vertical motions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> automotive <b>frames</b> due to <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> longitudinal torsion moments as well as longitudinal motion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chassis runner due to <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> longitudinal forces and frame flexion moments. Two - way elastic connection This kind of connections is used to connect the truck tank with <b>the</b> vehicle automotive <b>frame.</b> <b>The</b> connection supports lateral and longitudinal forces and enables vertical motion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> automotive <b>frame</b> in relation to the truck tank, during the torsion and lifting <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vehicle. Stiff connection (connection plates, sheets) This type of connections enables rigid connection <b>of</b> <b>the</b> automotive <b>frame</b> and <b>the</b> chassis runner thus making them behave as a whole. Connection plates transfer longitudinal, lateral and vertical forces. They are mounted from <b>the</b> front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> anterior support <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rear suspension to <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> automotive (chassis runner) <b>frame.</b> <b>The</b> upper part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plate is welded for the chassis runner, while <b>the</b> lower part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plate is bolted for <b>the</b> automotive <b>frame.</b> Guidelines for <b>the</b> application <b>of</b> particular truck superstructures A truck superstructure must not prevent the chassis movement; therefore, it is important to choose a proper type <b>of</b> connection between <b>the</b> chassis and the truck superstructure. Chassis twisting is most expressed in the area behind the driver's cabin and it should decline towards <b>the</b> rear <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vehicle. If a rigid superstructure is mounted on <b>the</b> basic <b>frame</b> and <b>the</b> coupling is also rigid, <b>the</b> <b>twisting</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main <b>frame</b> is not gradual but sudden and restricted to a limited area where high levels of torsion stress occur. The principal rule regarding <b>the</b> rigidity <b>of</b> superstructures is: <b>the</b> stiffer superstructure is, the more elastic connection must be. Manufacturer's recommendations for particular types of truck superstructures Manufacturer's recommendations for concrete mixer superstructures <b>The</b> truck superstructure <b>of</b> a concrete mixer is an example of torsionally flexible mounting. Figs. 7, 8, and 9 show types and cites of connections as well as some structural requirements of Volvo, Mercedes and Renault transport vehicles [2, 3, 4, 5]. In a 6 x 2 Volvo (Fig. 7), the first three couplings are cantilevered and five other connections are achieved with midfielder plates. The mixer is mounted on 6 x 2 vehicles with suspension or on 4 x 2 or 6 x 2 vehicles with air damping. All twin - shaft trucks could be loaded with 13 t on the rear axle. Mercedes does not give much information related to the concrete mixer superstructure. To ensure stability and reduce strain <b>of</b> truck <b>frames,</b> <b>the</b> chassis runner is stiffened in the rear. Fig. 6 shows that the Mercedes chassis runner bends outwards, because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> possibility <b>of</b> embedding a larger drum or because <b>of</b> lowering <b>the</b> existing one in order to lower the focus down and thus increase <b>the</b> stability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> entire vehicle. Recommendations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> body tipper manufacturer A body tipper is an example of a torsionally flexible superstructure. Fig. 10 shows some types of sites and links, as well as some structural requirements of Volvo and Mercedes tippers [2, 3, 4]. Linking <b>the</b> main <b>frame</b> with <b>the</b> mounting one is performed using the console connection in the front part while near the axles connecting plates are used. To ensure <b>the</b> stability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vehicle when unloading and to reduce stress, <b>the</b> <b>frames</b> are stiffened in the rear (Fig. 8). Recommendations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> manufacturer for mounting tanks Tank compartments are usually of circular or elliptical cross section, and as such they have large shaft, polar or torsion inertional moments. If <b>the</b> theories <b>of</b> material resistance and construction resistance are applied, it can be easily shown that the bending and torsion rigidity directly depend on <b>the</b> size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> moment inertia; x x c ~ I; ϕ ϕ c ~ I, from which it can be concluded that the tank is a very rigid structure regarding bending and twisting. To connect the superstructure to the vehicle base, two-way elastic connections are used. Fig. 9 shows a twin-shaft Volvo tank with the number and types of connections used in connecting <b>the</b> main <b>frame</b> with <b>the</b> tank compartment. Three-axle tanks and four-axle tanks with the type and number <b>of</b> links <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main vehicle <b>frame</b> with <b>the</b> tank compartment are also shown. Similarly to <b>the</b> case <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tipper MB [3], there is no much information about linking <b>the</b> basic <b>frame</b> with <b>the</b> tank. Fig. 9 shows only a simplified method of coupling, without defining <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> connections and a more detailed description of connections. However, an important difference observed in relation to <b>the</b> solution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Volvo manufacturer is that a chassis runner is used. Conclusion <b>The</b> analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> guidelines <b>of</b> leading manufacturers for upgrades, transport vehicle chassis and their connections leads to the following conclusions: The connection with <b>the</b> basic superstructure <b>frame</b> is an extremely complex issue. It is necessary to consider many factors (type <b>of</b> connection, <b>the</b> connection location, size and shape <b>of</b> <b>the</b> assembly - extra <b>frames,</b> <b>the</b> types <b>of</b> upgrades, etc.) since its characteristics directly affect both the reliability and the payload mass. As shown in the guidelines for <b>the</b> implementation <b>of</b> certain kinds of connection upgrades, a type <b>of</b> interactions on <b>the</b> basic <b>frame</b> depends on <b>the</b> torsional stiffness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> superstructure. Truck superstructures must not move to limit the chassis and is thus important to properly choose <b>the</b> types <b>of</b> connections and chassis upgrades. <b>The</b> connection <b>of</b> <b>the</b> upgrade to <b>the</b> basic <b>frame</b> is taken as already given by the manufacturer, having in mind extensive research <b>of</b> <b>the</b> manufacturer in this field. Regardless the simplifications in <b>the</b> application <b>of</b> general recommendations, <b>the</b> comparative analysis shows that there is a proper connection <b>of</b> <b>the</b> base and mounting <b>frame</b> which eliminates <b>the</b> possibility <b>of</b> breakdown...|$|R
