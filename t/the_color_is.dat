5|$|Protactinium(V) {{fluoride}} forms {{white crystals}} where protactinium ions {{are arranged in}} pentagonal bipyramids and coordinated by 7 other ions. The coordination is the same in protactinium(V) chloride, but <b>the</b> <b>color</b> <b>is</b> yellow. The coordination changes to octahedral in the brown protactinium(V) bromide and is unknown for protactinium(V) iodide. The protactinium coordination in all its tetrahalides is 8, but the arrangement is square antiprismatic in protactinium(IV) fluoride and dodecahedral in the chloride and bromide. Brown-colored protactinium(III) iodide has been reported where protactinium ions are 8-coordinated in a bicapped trigonal prismatic arrangement.|$|E
5|$|The {{color in}} the {{original}} print is breathtaking; Redskin leaves an impression of a kaleidoscope of awe-inspiring backgrounds, with such much happening in the foreground that one hardly has time {{to take in the}} whole frame. <b>The</b> <b>color</b> <b>is</b> used for emotional impact; black and white (toned amber) represents the world of the white man; color is reserved for scenes of Indian life.|$|E
5|$|The American Cream is {{the only}} breed of draft horse {{developed}} in the United States that is still in existence today. The breed descends from a foundation mare named Old Granny. She was probably foaled between 1900 and 1905, and was first noticed at an auction in Story County, Iowa, in 1911 and purchased by Harry Lakin, a well known stock dealer. She was eventually sold to Nelson Brothers Farm in Jewell, Iowa. Her breeding is not known, but she was cream-colored and many of her foals were as well; they sold for above-average prices because of their color. Her cream-colored coat, pink skin and amber eyes are defining standards for the breed, and <b>the</b> <b>color</b> <b>is</b> now known as gold champagne. In 1946, {{two years after the}} breed registry was formed, 98 percent of the horses registered could be traced back to Old Granny.|$|E

25|$|Rose quartz {{is a type}} of quartz which {{exhibits}} a pale pink to rose red hue. <b>The</b> <b>color</b> <b>is</b> usually considered as due to trace amounts of titanium, iron, or manganese, in the massive material. Some rose quartz contains microscopic rutile needles which produces an asterism in transmitted light. Recent X-ray diffraction studies suggest that <b>the</b> <b>color</b> <b>is</b> due to thin microscopic fibers of possibly dumortierite within the massive quartz.|$|E

25|$|When {{one of the}} {{components}} has the strongest intensity, <b>the</b> <b>color</b> <b>is</b> a hue near this primary color (reddish, greenish or bluish), and when two components have the same strongest intensity, then <b>the</b> <b>color</b> <b>is</b> a hue of a secondary color (a shade of cyan, magenta or yellow). A secondary color is formed by the sum of two primary colors of equal intensity: cyan is green+blue, magenta is red+blue, and yellow is red+green. Every secondary color is the complement of one primary color; when a primary and its complementary secondary color are added together, the result is white: cyan complements red, magenta complements green, and yellow complements blue.|$|E

25|$|A {{color in}} the RGB color model is {{described}} by indicating how much {{of each of the}} red, green, and blue is included. <b>The</b> <b>color</b> <b>is</b> expressed as an RGB triplet (r,g,b), each component of which can vary from zero to a defined maximum value.

25|$|The {{most common}} {{treatment}} is {{the application of}} heat. Most rubies {{at the lower end}} of the market are heat treated to improve color, remove purple tinge, blue patches, and silk. These heat treatments typically occur around temperatures of 1800°C (3300°F). Some rubies undergo a process of low tube heat, when the stone is heated over charcoal of a temperature of about 1300°C (2400°F) for 20 to 30 minutes. The silk is partially broken, and <b>the</b> <b>color</b> <b>is</b> improved.|$|E

25|$|The {{pale blue}} color of {{aquamarine}} {{is attributed to}} Fe2+. Fe3+ ions produce golden-yellow color, and when both Fe2+ and Fe3+ are present, <b>the</b> <b>color</b> <b>is</b> a darker blue as in maxixe. Decoloration of maxixe by light or heat thus {{may be due to}} the charge transfer between Fe3+ and Fe2+. Dark-blue maxixe color can be produced in green, pink or yellow beryl by irradiating it with high-energy particles (gamma rays, neutrons or even X-rays).|$|E
25|$|Quantitative symbols give {{a visual}} {{indication}} {{of the magnitude of}} the phenomenon that the symbol represents. Two major classes of symbols are used to portray quantity. Proportional symbols change size according to phenomenon’s magnitude, making them appropriate for representing statistics. Choropleth maps portray data collection areas, such as counties or census tracts, with color. Using color this way, the darkness and intensity (or value) of <b>the</b> <b>color</b> <b>is</b> evaluated by the eye as a measure of intensity or concentration.|$|E
25|$|Although <b>the</b> <b>color</b> <b>is</b> {{sometimes}} randomly chosen, professional queen breeders use a {{color that}} identifies the year a queen hatched, which helps them {{to decide whether}} their queens are too old to maintain a strong hive {{and need to be}} replaced. The mnemonic taught to assist beekeepers in remembering the colour order is Will You Raise Good Bees (white, yellow, red, green, blue). Sometimes tiny convex disks marked with identification numbers (Opalithplättchen) are used when a beekeeper has many queens born in the same year.|$|E
