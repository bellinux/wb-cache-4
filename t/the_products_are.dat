Aerial oxidation, hydrolysis, and other chemical reactions that degrade <b>the</b> <b>products</b> <b>are</b> retarded or prevented entirely. High-purity chemicals and pharmaceuticals are sometimes packed and sealed in argon.|$|E
5|$|Germany is {{a leading}} country in the fashion {{industry}}. The German textile industry consisted of about 1,300 companies with more than 130,000 employees in 2010, which generated a revenue of 28 billion Euro. Almost 44 per cent of <b>the</b> <b>products</b> <b>are</b> exported. The Berlin Fashion Week and the fashion trade fair Bread & Butter are held twice a year.|$|E

50|$|These {{compounds}} react readily with nucleophiles like water, alcohols, amines, thiols, and Grignard reagents. If the nucleophile <b>is</b> water <b>the</b> <b>product</b> <b>is</b> a sulfinic acid, if it <b>is</b> {{an alcohol}} <b>the</b> <b>product</b> <b>is</b> a sulfinic ester, {{if it is}} a primary or secondary amine <b>the</b> <b>product</b> <b>is</b> a sulfinamide, if it <b>is</b> a thiol <b>the</b> <b>product</b> <b>is</b> a thiosulfinate, while {{if it is a}} Grignard reagent <b>the</b> <b>product</b> <b>is</b> a sulfoxide. Because of their reactivity and instability, alkanesulfinyl chlorides are generally used without purification immediately after their synthesis. Storage is not recommended since pressure develops within the container due to hydrogen chloride release.|$|R

5|$|The {{leaf spring}} {{industry}} has {{its presence in}} Mangalore, with Canara Workshops Ltd. and Lamina Suspension Products Ltd. in the city. The Old Mangalore Port is a fishing port located at Bunder in Mangalore, where {{a large number of}} mechanised boats anchor. The traffic at this port was 122,000 tonnes during the years 2003–04. Fishing is a traditional occupation, and <b>the</b> <b>products</b> <b>are</b> exported to the surrounding regions. Mangalorean firms have a major presence in the tile, beedi, coffee, and cashew nut industry, although the tile industry has declined due to concrete being preferred in modern construction. The Albuquerque tile factory in Mangalore is one of India's oldest red roof tile manufacturing factories. The Ullal suburb of Mangalore produces hosiery and coir yarns, while beedi rolling is an important source of revenue to many in the city.|$|E
5|$|Alkanes and aryl alkanes may be {{chlorinated}} under {{free radical}} conditions, with UV light. However, {{the extent of}} chlorination is difficult to control: the reaction is not regioselective and often results {{in a mixture of}} various isomers with different degrees of chlorination, though this may be permissible if <b>the</b> <b>products</b> <b>are</b> easily separated. Aryl chlorides may be prepared by the Friedel-Crafts halogenation, using chlorine and a Lewis acid catalyst. The haloform reaction, using chlorine and sodium hydroxide, is also able to generate alkyl halides from methyl ketones, and related compounds. Chlorine adds to the multiple bonds on alkenes and alkynes as well, giving di- or tetra-chloro compounds. However, due to the expense and reactivity of chlorine, organochlorine compounds are more commonly produced by using hydrogen chloride, or with chlorinating agents such as phosphorus pentachloride (PCl5) or thionyl chloride (SOCl2). The last is very convenient in the laboratory because all side products are gaseous and {{do not have to be}} distilled out.|$|E
25|$|Two {{individual}} {{terms were}} coined. The first, 'made in Hong Kong', {{refers to the}} process in which all power, resources (apart from raw materials exported from foreign countries), labour, capital, design and management occur in Hong Kong, and <b>the</b> <b>products</b> <b>are</b> either sold locally or exported overseas. This system is a pre-relocation manufacturing system. The second, 'made by Hong Kong', refers to the process in which capital, design, management and office occur in Hong Kong. However, the power and labour are supplied from Mainland China where the factories are located. Raw materials are transported to Mainland China via Hong Kong. <b>The</b> <b>products</b> <b>are</b> then shipped to overseas countries. This system describes the system that the relocated factories follow.|$|E

The major {{catching}} nations are South Korea, Norway, Japan and Poland. <b>The</b> <b>products</b> <b>are</b> used as animal food and fish bait. Krill fisheries are difficult to operate in two important respects. First, a krill net needs to have very fine meshes, producing a very high drag, which generates a bow wave that deflects the krill to the sides. Second, fine meshes tend to clog very fast.|$|E
50|$|The {{incremental}} build {{model is}} a method of software development where <b>the</b> <b>product</b> <b>is</b> designed, implemented and tested incrementally (a little more is added each time) until <b>the</b> <b>product</b> <b>is</b> finished.

25|$|Second-generation fuels require either higher {{confinement}} temperatures {{or longer}} confinement time than those required of first-generation fusion fuels, but generate fewer neutrons. Neutrons are an unwanted byproduct of fusion reactions in an energy generation context, {{because they are}} absorbed by {{the walls of a}} fusion chamber, making them radioactive. They cannot be confined by magnetic fields, because they are not electrically charged. This group consists of deuterium and helium-3. <b>The</b> <b>products</b> <b>are</b> all charged particles, but there may be significant side reactions leading to the production of neutrons.|$|E
25|$|Ozone reacts {{directly}} with some hydrocarbons such as aldehydes and thus begins their removal from the air, but <b>the</b> <b>products</b> <b>are</b> themselves {{key components of}} smog. Ozone photolysis by UV light leads to production of the hydroxyl radical HO• and this plays {{a part in the}} removal of hydrocarbons from the air, but is also {{the first step in the}} creation of components of smog such as peroxyacyl nitrates, which can be powerful eye irritants. The atmospheric lifetime of tropospheric ozone is about 22 days; its main removal mechanisms are being deposited to the ground, the above-mentioned reaction giving HO•, and by reactions with OH and the peroxy radical HO2•.|$|E

25|$|Nested PCR: {{increases}} {{the specificity of}} DNA amplification, by reducing background due to non-specific amplification of DNA. Two sets of primers are used in two successive PCRs. In the first reaction, one pair of primers is used to generate DNA products, which besides the intended target, may still consist of non-specifically amplified DNA fragments. <b>The</b> <b>product(s)</b> <b>are</b> then used in a second PCR {{with a set of}} primers whose binding sites are completely or partially different from and located 3' of each of the primers used in the first reaction. Nested PCR is often more successful in specifically amplifying long DNA fragments than conventional PCR, but it requires more detailed knowledge of the target sequences.|$|E
25|$|All {{bicycles}} and equipment must be built within strict guidelines {{set by the}} NJS, by a certified builder using NJS-approved materials. <b>The</b> <b>products</b> <b>are</b> then stamped by NJS and only equipment bearing this stamp may be used. Exceptions to this are a very limited set of equipment including carbon wheels, tires, stems and saddles used in Girls' Keirin, {{which can be used}} without NJS certification. The NJS standard is to ensure that no rider will have any advantage or disadvantage based on equipment and does not necessarily relate to quality or standard of manufacture. For example, 36 spoke wheels are allowed but not 32, although 32 spoke wheels are typically lighter, and frames must be built by a very limited number of approved builders.|$|E
25|$|Some {{scholars}} use emergy (spelled with an m) analysis, for example, {{budgets for}} the amount of energy of one kind (exergy) that is required to make or transform things into another kind of product or service. Emergy calculations take into account economics which can alter pure physics based results. Using emergy life-cycle analysis researchers have concluded that materials with large refining costs have the greatest potential for high recycle benefits. Moreover, the highest emergy efficiency accrues from systems geared toward material recycling, where materials are engineered to recycle back into their original form and purpose, followed by adaptive reuse systems where the materials are recycled into a different kind of product, and then by-product reuse systems where parts of <b>the</b> <b>products</b> <b>are</b> used to make an entirely different product.|$|E
