5|$|In recent years, Gyeongju has {{followed}} the same trends that have affected the rest of South Korea. Like <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> whole, Gyeongju has seen its population age {{and the size of}} families shrink. For instance, the mean household size is 2.8 people. Because this has fallen in recent years, there are more households in the city as of 2008 (105,009) than there were in 2003, even though the population has fallen.|$|E

5|$|The Belgian {{resistance}} was praised by contemporaries for {{its contribution to}} the Allied war effort; particularly during the later period. In a letter to Lieutenant-General Pire, commander of the , General Eisenhower praised {{the role that the}} Belgian resistance had played in disrupting German supply lines after D-Day. The continuing actions of the resistance stopped the Germans ever being able to use <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> secure base, never fully becoming pacified.|$|E
5|$|The East German {{government}} {{sought to}} define <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> legitimate state {{in its own}} right and portrayed West Germany as enemy territory (feindliches Ausland)– a capitalist, semi-fascist state that exploited its citizens, sought to regain the lost territories of the Third Reich, and stood opposed to the peaceful socialism of the GDR.|$|E
5|$|The Polish {{population}} is historically declining. This is primarily caused by low natural birth rate, assimilation, high intermarriage rate (the majority of Poles live in mixed relationships), and migration {{to other parts}} of <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> result of job seeking.|$|E

5|$|After his retirement, San Martín {{intended}} {{to live in}} Cuyo. Although the war of independence had ended in the region, the Argentine Civil Wars continued. The unitarians wanted to organize <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> unitary state centered on Buenos Aires, and the federals, who preferred a federation of provinces. San Martín had {{good relations with the}} federal caudillos and a personal feud with unitarian leader Bernardino Rivadavia, but tried to stay neutral. San Martín's wife, María de los Remedios de Escalada, died in 1823, so he returned to Buenos Aires. He took his daughter Mercedes Tomasa, who was living with her mother's family, and sailed to Europe.|$|E
5|$|Although many Canadians {{have come}} to view Brock {{as one of their}} own, Brock never really felt at home in Canada. On the whole, he viewed <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> backwater, and earnestly wished to return to Europe to fight against Napoleon. Brock mistrusted the Canadian colonists, many of whom he {{suspected}} of being American sympathizers, and he was reluctant to arm them indiscriminately to help defend the colonies. He favoured expansion of volunteer forces which could be trained and supervised, as well as the use of British regulars and Tecumseh's warriors.|$|E
5|$|As a result, the Riverside Historic District, Jacksonville's first {{historic}} district, {{was added}} to the National Register of Historic Places in 1985; it now comprises 6870 acres and contains 2120 historic buildings. In 1989, the Avondale Historic District was added, and the following year the Jacksonville City Council established the Jacksonville Historic Preservation Commission in order to protect historic structures. Riverside Avondale Preservation has grown into one of the largest such organizations in <b>the</b> <b>country.</b> <b>As</b> <b>a</b> result of this focus on preservation and planning, the American Planning Association named Riverside and Avondale one of the country's top ten neighborhoods in 2010.|$|E

5|$|As {{kerosene}} {{and gasoline}} grew in importance, Rockefeller's wealth soared {{and he became}} the richest person in the country, controlling 90% of all oil in the United States at his peak. Oil was used throughout <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> light source until the introduction of electricity and as a fuel after {{the invention of the}} automobile. Furthermore, Rockefeller gained enormous influence over the railroad industry, which transported his oil around the country. Standard Oil was the first great business trust in the United States. Rockefeller revolutionized the petroleum industry, and along with other key contemporary industrialists such as steel magnate Andrew Carnegie, defined the structure of modern philanthropy.|$|E
5|$|At first Catherine {{kept the}} nine-year-old king, who cried at his coronation, close to her, and slept in his chamber. She presided over his council, decided policy, and {{controlled}} state business and patronage. However, {{she was never}} {{in a position to}} control <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> whole, which was on the brink of civil war. In many parts of France the rule of nobles held sway rather than that of the crown. The challenges Catherine faced were complex and in some ways difficult for her to comprehend as a foreigner.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{formation}} of Hurricane Kate, a ridge was located across the southeastern United States {{for much of the}} autumn of 1985; concurrently, a major trough persisted across the western portion of <b>the</b> <b>country.</b> <b>As</b> <b>a</b> result, weather conditions across the Gulf of Mexico and western Atlantic Ocean in November were more typical of the pattern in late September, including sea surface temperatures of 81°F (27°C). On November13, a weak tropical wave began interacting with a trough to the northeast of the Lesser Antilles. It gradually organized due to the favorable conditions, and on November15, a Hurricane Hunters flight into the area indicated the development of a tropical cyclone. As gale force winds were already present, the system was immediately declared Tropical Storm Kate, about 240miles (385km) northeast of San Juan, Puerto Rico.|$|E

5|$|But {{above all}} Mario Vargas Llosa uses the fictional Urania to {{facilitate}} the novel's attempt at remembering the regime. The novel opens and closes with Urania's story, effectively framing the narrative {{in the terms of}} remembering the past and understanding its legacy in the present. In addition, because of her academic study {{of the history of the}} Trujillo regime, Urania is also confronting the memory of the regime for <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> whole. This is in keeping with one purpose of the book, which is to ensure that the atrocities of the dictatorship and the dangers of absolute power will be remembered by a new generation.|$|E
5|$|Contact between English and {{immigrant}} languages {{has given rise}} to new accents and dialects. For instance, the variety of English spoken by Poles in Manchester is distinct both from typical Polish-accented English and from Mancunian. At a local level, the diversity of immigrant communities means that some languages that are extremely rare in <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> whole have strongholds in Northern towns: Pashto is spoken natively by 0.08% of the population of England but 0.7% of the population of Bradford, while Cantonese is the first language of 0.4% of the population of Manchester compared to 0.08% nationally.|$|E
5|$|Discontent with Richard's actions {{manifested}} itself in the summer after he took control of <b>the</b> <b>country,</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> conspiracy emerged to displace him from the throne. The rebels were mostly loyalists to Edward IV, who saw Richard as a usurper. Their plans were coordinated by a Lancastrian, Henry's mother Lady Margaret, who was promoting her son {{as a candidate for}} the throne. The highest-ranking conspirator was Buckingham. No chronicles tell of the duke's motive in joining the plot, although historian Charles Ross proposes that Buckingham was trying to distance himself from a king who was becoming increasingly unpopular with the people. Michael Jones and Malcolm Underwood suggest that Margaret deceived Buckingham into thinking the rebels supported him to be king.|$|E
50|$|John Miles Verrall (1849 - 17 September 1921), {{also known}} as John Miles Verrell, was a 19th-century Member of Parliament in Canterbury, New Zealand. In his later years, he was known {{throughout}} <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> advocate for a state bank.|$|R
50|$|The {{coronation}} was a {{sign that}} he had overcome Poland's internal fragmentation and re-united and re-instated <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> independent kingdom under his rule. Poland now needed friends abroad; so in 1320, Hedwig and Władysław's daughter Elizabeth (1305-1380) married Charles I of Hungary.|$|R

Dayton is the home of the Dayton Art Institute.|$|R
5|$|Forces of the South Korean Republic of Korea Army, {{supported}} by the United States Navy and United States Air Force, defended the eastern coast of <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> part of the Pusan Perimeter. When several divisions of the North Korean People's Army crossed through mountainous terrain to push the UN forces back, a complicated battle ensued in the rugged terrain around P'ohang-dong, which contained the vital supply line to the main UN force at Taegu.|$|E
5|$|In 2011 (the {{last year}} for which {{information}} is available), Phoenix had a slightly younger population than <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> whole. While the United States had 13.3% of its population over the age of 65, Phoenix's percentage stood significantly lower, at 8.1%. Phoenix's percentage of 18.8% in the next age group, 45–64 was also a great deal lower than the national average of 26.6%. This results in 73% of Phoenix's population being 44 or younger, as compared to the national percentage of 60.|$|E
5|$|In April 1946, Kenney {{became the}} first {{commander}} of the newly formed Strategic Air Command (SAC). He was encouraged by Secretary of the Air Force Stuart Symington {{to join him in}} the political battle surrounding the establishment of an independent United States Air Force. Separately, the two men gave promotional speeches around <b>the</b> <b>country.</b> <b>As</b> <b>a</b> result, SAC's efficiency suffered. On 8 May 1946, Kenney publicly presented the Medal of Honor to the family of Thomas B. McGuire, Jr, the second-highest scoring US fighter pilot, who had been killed in action.|$|E

25|$|In February 2009, Argentina {{expelled}} Richard Williamson, an excommunicated Roman Catholic bishop. Williamson, {{who headed}} a seminary near Buenos Aires, {{was ordered to}} leave for 'concealing true activity' (he had entered <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> employee of a non-governmental group, not a priest).
