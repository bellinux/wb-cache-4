25|$|The {{narrative}} use of fragmented {{sentences and}} stream of consciousness does {{not conform to}} the rules of traditional grammar or sentence structure. These methods encourage the reader to better understand the psyche and experiences of the protagonist. The timing of the publication is significant: during the 1980s, Austria's younger generation was <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> grips with their country's Nazi past. The story of a February hidden in shadows—February Shadows—forces the readers, most of whom would be Austrians, to relieve the experience of that February and thus remember a past that most Austrians wanted to suppress. In this way, it is both a culturally revealing and politically charged story.|$|E

500|$|As mankind {{comes in}} contact with this terrifying beauty {{represented}} by these angels, Rilke {{is concerned with the}} experience of existential angst in <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> terms with the coexistence of the spiritual and earthly. [...] He portrays human beings as alone in a universe where God is abstract and possibly non-existent, [...] "where memory and patterns of intuition raise the sensitive consciousness to a realization of solitude." [...] Rilke depicts the alternative, a spiritually fulfilling possibility beyond human limitations in the form of angels. Beginning with the first line of the collection, Rilke's despairing speaker calls upon the angels to notice human suffering and to intervene. There is a deeply felt despair and unresolvable tension in that no matter man's striving, the limitation of human and earthly existence renders humanity unable {{to reach out to the}} angels. [...] The narrative voice Rilke employs in the Duino Elegies strives [...] "to achieve in human consciousness the angel's presumed plenitude of being" [...] (i.e. being, or existence, in German: Dasein).|$|E

2500|$|Every {{coming out}} {{story is the}} person <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> terms with {{who they are and}} their sexual orientation. Several models have been created to {{describe}} coming out as a process for gay and lesbian identity development, e.g. Dank, 1971; Cass, 1984; Coleman, 1989; Troiden, 1989. Of these models, the most widely accepted is the Cass identity model established by Vivienne Cass. This model outlines six discrete stages transited by individuals who successfully come out: identity confusion, identity comparison, identity tolerance, identity acceptance, identity pride, and identity synthesis. However, not every LGBT person follows such a model. For example, some LGBT youth become aware of and accept their same-sex desires or gender identity at puberty in a way similar to which heterosexual teens become aware of their sexuality, i.e. free of any notion of difference, stigma or shame in terms of the gender of the people to whom they are attracted. [...] Regardless of whether LGBT youth develop their identity based on a model, the typical age at which youth in the United States come out has been dropping. High school students and even middle school students are coming out.|$|E
2500|$|Gale Edwards' 1995 RSC {{production}} at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre, starring Josie Lawrence and Michael Siberry. Edwards {{was the first woman}} to direct the play at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre, and for this reason alone, it received a great deal of attention. The play opens on a stormy night, with a woman (played by Lawrence) dressed in rags trying to get her drunk husband (played by Siberry) to come home. He refuses, and falls asleep outside the tavern. As with the Bogdanov production, the taming story was then presented as Sly's dream. However, in Edwards, it was set in a surreal landscape, with the characters sporting a bizarre mixture of costumes; Elizabethan, commedia dell'arte, pantomime, Victorian, Edwardian, and modern dress. At the end of Katherina's speech (which was delivered lovingly until she realised she was part of a wager, at which point she began to speak angrily, and by the end, Petruchio had become bowed with shame), the text was cut and at this point, the play returned to the Induction setting. Sly, having been deeply moved by his dream, condemns the subjugation of women and embraces his wife, whose love he now appreciates {{for the first time in}} his life. The production notes say of Katherina's speech; [...] "Petruchio slowly realises what he has been attempting to do to Katherina in the name of love. By the end of the speech, his dream has become his nightmare." [...] Speaking of the correlation between Sly and Petruchio, Siberry stated that Petruchio becomes [...] "sobered and then shamed" [...] during the speech, whilst Sly releases [...] "that his behavior has become unacceptable." [...] As the play ends with a kneeling Sly embracing his standing wife, Siberry argues that Sly [...] "is trying to make some sense of what had happened, understanding that he has made an awful mistake and <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> terms with it." [...] The production ended ambiguously, however, with no indication as to whether Sly's wife would forgive him.|$|E
