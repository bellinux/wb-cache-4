5|$|It is {{revealed}} {{that this man}} is the actual, corporeal Prismo, and the version Finn and Jake are familiar with is merely a dream. Prismo explains that killing a wishmaster—as in, waking up the man—is a cosmic crime, but that he will return when his corporal body falls back asleep. At <b>that</b> <b>instant,</b> the Lich springs into action, physically waking and destroying Prismo, killing him. Suddenly, an interdimensional being arrives and begins taking the Lich to the Citadel, to which Finn and Jake give chase.|$|E
5|$|Following the 2009 {{legislative}} session, Attorney General Jack Conway {{was asked}} to issue advisory opinions on two gambling-related issues. Republican state senator Damon Thayer asked for an opinion as to whether Instant Racing – allowing individuals to bet {{on the outcome of}} previously run horse races – would be allowable under the state constitution. Democratic Representative Jody Richards also asked for an advisory opinion as to whether a constitutional amendment was required to allow video lottery terminals at the state's racetracks or whether they could be construed as legal under the amendment that allowed a state lottery. Critics charged that Conway had a conflict of interest in the matter because his father {{was a member of the}} Kentucky Horse Racing Commission, but Conway denied that a conflict existed, and the state Executive Branch Ethics Board refused to take a position unless an official request for an investigation were made. Conway subsequently opined in June 2009 that video lottery terminals would be legal if governed by the Kentucky Lottery Corporation and in January 2010 <b>that</b> <b>instant</b> racing would be allowable under the state's parimutuel betting statutes with a few regulatory changes.|$|E

25|$|After the {{two teams}} traded punts on their first drives of the game, the 49ers, aided by a {{roughing}} the passer penalty and a 17-yard screen pass to fullback Tom Rathman on 3rd-and-10, marched 73 yards from their own 3-yard line to the Bengals 24. But dropped passes, including one by receiver Mike Wilson on the 2-yard line (the {{first time in a}} Super Bowl <b>that</b> <b>instant</b> replay was used to reverse a call), forced them to settle for a 41-yard field goal from kicker Mike Cofer.|$|E

25|$|Conventional bombsights {{are set up}} {{pointing}} at a fixed angle, the range angle, which accounts for the various effects on the trajectory of the bomb. To the operator looking through the sights, the crosshairs indicate the location on the ground the bombs would impact if released at <b>that</b> <b>instant.</b> As the aircraft moves forward, the target approaches the crosshairs from the front, moving rearward, and the bombardier releases the bombs as the target passes through {{the line of the}} sights. One example of a highly automated system of this type was the RAF's Mark XIV bomb sight.|$|E
25|$|During the 1950s, the Philippine government, {{with the}} help of the Americans, brought in a more {{resistant}} variety of coffee. It was also then <b>that</b> <b>instant</b> coffee was being produced commercially, thus increasing the demand for beans. Because of favorable market conditions, many farmers went back to growing coffee in the 1960s. But the sudden proliferation of coffee farms resulted in a surplus of beans around the world, and for a while importation of coffee was banned in order to protect local coffee producers. When Brazil was hit by a frost in the 1970s, world market coffee prices soared. The Philippines became a member of the International Coffee Organization (ICO) in 1980.|$|E
25|$|The {{system worked}} by having two dipole antennas instead of one, {{slightly}} offset {{on either side}} of the mounting mast projecting through the middle of the parabolic dish. Being offset, the beams produced by the two dipoles were angled away from each other, to either side of the dish centreline. Normally the signals from both were added together and displayed, producing an output largely identical to the single-dipole case. The dipole shaft was mounted on another motor that rapidly spun them at 800rpm. A switch was placed so that it was triggered by the motor when the dipoles were roughly vertical or roughly horizontal, triggering a second circuit that subtracted the signals from each other instead of adding. The result was the difference in signal strength, which indicated which of the two dipoles was receiving more energy at <b>that</b> <b>instant.</b> This signal was fed into the scanner motors, driving it in the right direction.|$|E

25|$|On 9 April 1799, after reconnoitering two French frigates in L'Orient, St Fiorenzo and HMS Amelia sailed towards Belle Île. Conditions were hazy and {{although}} Neale had sighted some vessels, {{it was only}} when he had passed the island that he discovered three French frigates and a large gun vessel. At <b>that</b> <b>instant</b> a sudden squall carried away Amelias main-top-mast and fore and mizzen top-gallant masts; the fall of the main-top-mast tore away much of the mainsail from the yard. Neale shortened St Fiorenzos sail and ordered Amelia to keep close to St Fiorenzo to maintain the weather gage, and to prepare for battle. An action commenced but the French vessels avoided close-quarter action and, although the British ships came under fire from shore batteries, they had to bear down on the French three times to engage them. After nearly two hours the French wore ship and sailed away to take refuge in the Loire, with the gun-vessel returning to Belle Île.|$|E
25|$|On 11 July Rawlinson {{ordered that}} lost ground be {{recovered}} by outflanking the new German line along the canal in the Dunes sector. The XV Corps commander, Lieutenant-General Du Cane noted <b>that</b> <b>instant</b> counter-attacks made by local initiative usually succeeded, while those ordered later by higher authority were {{too late to}} exploit disorganisation among the attackers and that adequate preparation and a methodical attack was necessary. The remainder of the bridgehead was constricted, the German artillery reinforcements were still present and after a successful counter-attack, British troops would be vulnerable to another German operation. Du Cane wanted {{to wait until the}} rest of the British artillery arrived and the main offensive at Ypres had begun. Rawlinson accepted Du Cane's views and counter-attacks planned for 12 July by the 32nd Division were cancelled. The 33rd Division was moved to the coast in August and took over from Nieuport to Lombartsyde, spending three weeks in the line, under night bombing and gas shelling. Two of the 33rd Division battalions were kilted Scottish and suffered severely from mustard gas burns, until equipped with undergarments.|$|E
25|$|The team first {{considered}} {{spinning the}} radar dish around a vertical axis and then angling the dish {{up and down}} a few degrees with each complete circuit. The vertical motion could be smoothed out by moving continually rather than in steps, producing a helix pattern. However, this helical-scan solution had two disadvantages; one was that the dish spent half of its time pointed backwards, limiting the amount of energy broadcast forward, and the other was that it required the microwave energy to somehow be sent to the antenna through a rotating feed. At a 25 October all-hands meeting attended by Dee, Hodgkin and members of the GEC group at GEC's labs, {{the decision was made to}} proceed with the helical-scan solution in spite of these issues. GEC solved the problem of having the signal turned off half the time by using two dishes mounted back-to-back and switching the output of the magnetron to the one facing forward at <b>that</b> <b>instant.</b> They initially suggested that the system would be available by December 1940, but as work progressed it became clear that it would take much longer.|$|E

500|$|Al Wefaq {{released}} a statement accusing authorities of cutting Internet connection {{in a number of}} areas. [...] "Personal devices of some citizens have also been selectively cut off," [...] the statement added. The secular-leftist Waad society said <b>that</b> <b>instant</b> messaging applications such as WhatsApp had been blocked by VIVA Bahrain telecommunications company. Several citizens also complained of loss of Internet for several hours in different locations during the day. They said the cut was at a time when protests were being held. Previously in February 2011, when the uprising began, a similar situation occurred during which the Internet became either slow or was lost completely. Telecommunication companies said then that the problem was due an overload on Internet networks.|$|E
500|$|Shelley's first travel {{narrative}} and first published work, History of a Six Weeks' Tour, was published anonymously and was co-written with her husband. Rambles, {{on the other}} hand, places Mary Shelley at {{the centre of the}} narrative. It tells the story of [...] "the recovery of paradise" [...] and the fears of a mother. Her maternal sorrow is generalised. For example, in discussing the death of her daughter in 1818, she writes: [...] "I was agitated again by emotions—by passions—and those the deepest a woman's heart can harbour—a dread to see her child even at <b>that</b> <b>instant</b> expire—which then occupied me". Connecting these deep feelings to writings by Shakespeare, Wordsworth, Coleridge, and Thomas Holcroft, she argues that intense emotion and environment are intertwined, contending that maternal grief is sublime.|$|E

Burr wrote for the San Antonio Express-News, [...] " [...] balanced torchy ballads full of hurt and pain such as 'Amor Prohibido' with fun dance cumbias {{with a sense of}} humor"; [...] "Songs such as 'Baila Esta Cumbia', 'La Carcacha', 'Como la Flor' and 'Amor Prohibido' had <b>that</b> <b>instant</b> appeal, that memorable melodic hook". Burr further wrote that [...] "Amor Prohibido" [...] and Selena's 1994 single [...] "No Me Queda Más" [...] were [...] "heartbreaking ballads". Texas Monthly editor Joe Nick Patoski called [...] "Amor Prohibido" [...] the [...] "perfect pop cumbia". [...] "Con Tanto Amor Medley", a 2002 single from Ones, which is a mashup of [...] "Amor Prohibido", [...] "Si Una Vez" [...] and [...] "Como la Flor", was released to favorable reviews.|$|E
