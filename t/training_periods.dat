5|$|After {{a period}} of leave, the {{battalion}} began to reform on the Atherton Tablelands in Queensland during February 1944 {{and for the next}} eight months they undertook a number of exercises and <b>training</b> <b>periods</b> as they prepared for the next stage of the war. During this time, the battalion's authorised strength was reduced to 803 men of all ranks, as the 3rd Division was converted to the Jungle divisional establishment. On 20 July 1944, the 61st Battalion embarked upon HMAT Katoomba in Cairns and proceeded overseas again. They arrived at Madang in New Guinea four days later. As it was considered that there were still isolated pockets of Japanese in the area, the battalion began patrolling operations almost as soon as they had landed.|$|E
5|$|McNair had {{difficulty}} implementing {{a training program}} for National Guard units, chiefly because of their lack of prior military experience other than monthly drills and short annual <b>training</b> <b>periods.</b> He recommended a wholesale demobilization of the National Guard; Marshall and the Secretary of War disagreed, partly because they anticipated political backlash, and partly because the manpower they provided was in demand. McNair also found National Guard senior commanders wanting; in his view, National Guard officers should not progress beyond the grade of colonel, and professional full-time officers should command at the division level and above. In this, he was mostly successful; all but two National Guard division commanders were replaced by regular Army officers, and most National Guard generals carried out stateside assignments, or non-combat overseas assignments. Some served in roles below division commander (such as assistant division commander), or carried out administrative and training roles, such as provost marshal or school commandant. In addition, some accepted reductions in rank so they could serve in overseas assignments.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{evaluate}} the applicability of surface electromyography (EMG) for evaluation of training related changes in muscle contractile properties. Eight nationally ranked junior tennis players participated in a six weeks training program designed to increase speed and explosiveness. Their physical characteristics were evaluated before and after the <b>training</b> <b>period</b> by: tennis-specific field tests, measuring isometric twitch contraction of the medial gastrocnemius muscle, and by monitoring the frequency spectrum of the EMG at 50 % of the maximal voluntary contraction. All the players improved the results of tennis specific field tests after the <b>training</b> <b>period,</b> but only three players were recognized to increase contractile speed of the medial gastrocnemius muscle expressed by shorter twitch contraction times after the <b>training</b> <b>period.</b> The same three players exhibited higher characteristic frequency (defined as the mean frequency lying between the sixth and ninth decile of the spectral distribution function) and a wider EMG amplitude spectrum after the <b>training</b> <b>period.</b> A good correlation was found between the number of the parameters of the isometric twitch contraction that were improved by more than 2 % after the <b>training</b> <b>period</b> (N P) and the ratio between characteristic frequency after the <b>training</b> <b>period</b> (f A) and characteristic frequency before the <b>training</b> <b>period</b> (f B) (f A /f B) (p = 0. 0065), as well as between N P and the slope of the linear approximation of the dependence between decile frequencies of the EMG signal after the <b>training</b> <b>period</b> (dAf) and decile frequencies of the EMG signal before the <b>training</b> <b>period</b> (dBf) (dAf = f(dBf)) (p = 0. 0035). The correlation between the number of parameters of the isometric twitch contraction that were improved after the <b>training</b> <b>period</b> and the changes in characteristic parameters of EMG suggests the applicability of EMG for following-up sports training efficiency...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn Japan, transcatheter {{aortic valve}} {{implantation}} (TAVI) with Edwards-SAPIEN XT valve (Edwards Lifesciences Inc., Irvine, CA, USA) started in October 2013. All institutions should undergo a <b>training</b> <b>period</b> to perform TAVI independently. Balloon aortic valvuloplasty (BAV) {{as a bridge}} to TAVI during the <b>training</b> <b>period</b> should be performed with caution to avoid severe aortic regurgitation (AR) because bailout TAVI is not possible. We present {{a case in which}} BAV was successfully performed as a bridge to TAVI during the <b>training</b> <b>period.</b> The patient was an 85 -year-old man with medically uncontrollable congestive heart failure due to severe aortic valve stenosis. The aortic valve area was 0. 60 cm 2 with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 20 %. TAVI was considered a safe but high-risk strategy owing to the unstable hemodynamic condition. We chose BAV as a bridge therapy to TAVI. The aortic annulus diameter was 25. 3 mm on computed tomography scans. We chose a 20 -mm balloon catheter to avoid BAV-induced AR. Transfemoral TAVI was performed successfully 16 days after BAV using a 26 -mm SAPIEN XT valve. The postoperative course was uneventful. The case demonstrated BAV as a bridge therapy to TAVI can be safely and effectively performed during the <b>training</b> <b>period.</b> <Learning objective: All institutions should undergo a <b>training</b> <b>period</b> to start transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). Balloon aortic valvuloplasty (BAV) during the <b>training</b> <b>period</b> should be performed with caution. The present case suggests that BAV as a bridge therapy to TAVI can be safely performed during the <b>training</b> <b>period.</b> An accurate measurement of aortic annulus diameter and the use of an undersized balloon catheter might reduce the risk of BAV-related aortic regurgitation. ...|$|R

Unhappy with his situation with Leverkusen, Donovan was loaned to the San Jose Earthquakes of Major League Soccer (MLS) for the 2001 season. In MLS, Donovan had immediate success, leading the Earthquakes to MLS Cup championships in 2001 and 2003 and {{becoming one of the}} only recognizable faces of soccer in America. In four years in the league, he scored 32 goals and 29 assists in league play, and ten goals and six assists in the playoffs.

In February 1938, future World War II armor commander Colonel Bruce C. Clarke became division chief of staff, holding the position until 1940. On 1 April 1938, Major General James K. Parsons took command of the division while simultaneously commanding the Third Corps Area. On 27 September 1940, the division headquarters was relocated to the Hurst Building in Baltimore. After the Attack on Pearl Harbor resulted in American entry into World War II, the division was disbanded on 30 January 1942, by which time it had practically ceased due exist due to the calling up for active duty of most of its officers.|$|E
