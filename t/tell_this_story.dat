500|$|A Channel Seven {{spokeswoman}} {{revealed that}} the network received fewer than 30 telephone calls nationally after screening the [...] "lesbian kiss" [...] episode of the show. The calls were evenly split between those supporting the broadcast of the kiss, and those raising concerns. The show's series producer Cameron Welsh and Anderson both spoke out in defence of the storyline. Welsh said, [...] "The idea of this show {{has always been that}} we hold a mirror to society – and when society changes, we change with it. What's ahead in Home and Away is right not only for the series, but also for the times we are living in". Anderson said that she felt it was the right time to <b>tell</b> <b>this</b> <b>story</b> and added, [...] "It's really important for us to reflect society, and this storyline is what is going on for many people in real life". She also said that she did not think the plot would be so shocking, but was glad the show was exploring a gay relationship.|$|E
500|$|In August 2016, Singer {{said that}} Legion had been {{designed}} {{to fit into the}} X-Men universe, but also to stand alone, so [...] "you wouldn't have to label" [...] the relationship between the series and the films. Hawley explained that because the series is depicting the title character's [...] "subjective reality", it would not have to address any connections to the films straight away, noting that his series Fargo, which is connected to the 1996 film of the same name, at first [...] "had to stand on its own feet" [...] before exploring those connections more; [...] "We have to earn the right {{to be part of this}} universe. My hope is we create something so strong that the people in the movie studio call and say they would be foolish enough not to connect these things." [...] He did state that [...] "you can't <b>tell</b> <b>this</b> <b>story</b> without" [...] acknowledging that Legion is the son of Charles Xavier, who appears in the films. This acknowledgement comes in [...] "Chapter 7", with the appearance of Xavier's signature wheelchair in one of Haller's memories. Hawley explained that Haller would look to learn more of his father in future seasons, with Xavier potentially making a physical appearance in the series at that point.|$|E

500|$|The {{on-screen}} {{relationship between}} Dot and Jim was halted in 2007 when Jim was hastily written {{out of the}} soap due to Bardon's health problems. In the script Jim suffered a stroke and {{was placed in the}} care of off-screen relatives. Dot and Jim remained together, with Jim making sporadic appearances between 2008 and 2009 to visit Dot. A more permanent return for the character was announced in 2009. However, it was reported in April 2011 that Bardon had filmed his exit from the series, and that the show's staff believed it marked the end of the character. A source told the Daily Mirror: [...] "Dot's been struggling for a while and realises that she can no longer give Jim the care and attention he deserves and is forced to make the heartbreaking decision that he should move into a home. [...] It was very emotional on the set for the scenes where Dot discusses her decision and talks to Jim about him going into care for good. There were a lot of tears. [...] The feeling is that {{this is the end of}} Jim as a character because he won't leave the home and won't ever be a regular in Albert Square again." [...] It was reported that Jim could still appear in the care home if Bardon's health permitted it. Jim left the show on 26 May 2011. Brown opined that Dot would feel lonely without Jim, saying, [...] "I think she'll be very lonely and feel she doesn't have much purpose in life. It was really important to <b>tell</b> <b>this</b> <b>story</b> because there are so many people in a similar situation to Dot. It was moving to act out, too—not just because of Dot and Jim's relationship, but because I'm really good friends with John Bardon in real life." ...|$|E

2500|$|The first {{clinical}} study {{took place at}} the Christie Hospital in 1971, and showed a convincing effect in advanced breast cancer, but nevertheless ICI's development programme came close to termination when it was reviewed in 1972. Tamoxifen's further development may have been bolstered by a second {{clinical study}} by Harold W.C. Ward [...] at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Birmingham. Ward's study showed a more definitive response to the drug at a higher dosage. Walpole also may have helped to convince the company to market tamoxifen for late stage breast cancer in 1973. He was also instrumental in funding V. Craig Jordan to work on tamoxifen. In 1972, ICI Pharmaceuticals Division abandoned development of tamoxifen for financial reasons. The drug was subsequently reinvented from a failed contraceptive, to become tamoxifen, the gold standard for the adjuvant treatment of breast cancer and the pioneering medicine for chemprevention for high risk women.

2500|$|The {{style of}} film is {{presented}} in a nonlinear narrative. Each scene is introduced using a title card showing which of the 500 days it is. Co-writer of the film Scott Neustadter admitted the film {{was based on a}} real romance. Neustadter explains that when he met the real girl who inspired the character Summer as a student at the London School of Economics in 2002, he was rebounding from a bad breakup back home, and promptly fell [...] "crazily, madly, hopelessly in love" [...] with the girl who [...] "returned his kisses but not his ardor." [...] The ending of the relationship was [...] "painfully and unforgettably awful," [...] which prompted him to co-write the film with Michael H. Weber. When Neustadter later showed the script to Summer's real life counterpart, she said she related more to the Tom character. Weber also stated that, [...] "we've all been in the trenches of love, we've all gone through the highs and lows, so Scott and I felt {{that the only way to}} <b>tell</b> <b>this</b> <b>story</b> was to come at it from a completely real place. It was pretty interesting for us because Scott was just going through a break-up and I was in a long-term relationship, so we each brought a totally opposite perspective, living it and not living it, and I think that tension helped to bring out more of the comedy".|$|E
2500|$|Other reviewers {{were more}} critical. Neil Genzlinger of The New York Times said the film [...] "has a few {{segments}} that get beyond platitudes". He enjoyed the sequences that highlighted individual songs but noted the documentary [...] "doesn't {{have much in}} the way of full songs". Steven Zeitchik of the Los Angeles Times called From the Sky Down a [...] "procedural look" [...] at the album's inception. Although he enjoyed Bono's humorous insights, Zeitchik said that [...] "much of the movie is abstract, insider stuff about how he and others find inspiration". John DeFore of The Hollywood Reporter pointed out the limited scope of the film, calling it [...] "neither a comprehensive portrait nor one of those tossed-off featurettes that would be at home only as the filler for a commemorative Achtung Baby boxed set". Commenting on Guggenheim's filmmaking style, DeFore judged that some of his attempts to make the film more [...] "movie-ish" [...] failed to enhance the subject material. In the reviewer's opinion, this gave the [...] "impression of a filmmaker who can <b>tell</b> <b>this</b> <b>story</b> competently but isn't quite up to making a lasting film about one of rock history's most successful bands". Steven Hyden of The A.V. Club gave the film a C+, calling it [...] "occasionally enlightening but mostly frustrating". The review lamented the lack of coverage of most of the album's songs, and in Hyden's opinion, it was ironic that the band was trying to live down the [...] "ego-inflating" [...] Rattle and Hum in a film that he also considered [...] "ego-inflating".|$|E
