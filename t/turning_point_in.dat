40|$|<b>Turning</b> <b>points</b> <b>in</b> {{commodity}} {{returns are}} important for decisions of policy makers, commodity producers and consumers reliant on medium term outcomes. However, forecasting of <b>turning</b> <b>points</b> has been a neglected feature of forecasting, especially in commodity markets. I forecast <b>turning</b> <b>points</b> <b>in</b> metals price returns using Bayesian Decision Theory. The method produces a probabilistic statement about our belief of a <b>turning</b> <b>point</b> occurring <b>in</b> the next period which, combined with a decision rule based on a loss function generates optimal <b>turning</b> <b>point</b> forecasts. This method produces positive results <b>in</b> forecasting <b>turning</b> <b>points</b> <b>in</b> metals returns, with the simple linear models investigated producing more accurate <b>turning</b> <b>point</b> forecasts than naive models across {{a number of different}} evaluation methods for the general case and for the specific example of a producing firm. ...|$|R
