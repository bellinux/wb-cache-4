5|$|Once a turn is established, {{the torque}} {{that must be}} applied to the {{steering}} mechanism in order to maintain a constant radius at a constant forward speed depends on the forward speed and the geometry and mass distribution of the bike. At speeds below the capsize speed, described below in the section on Eigenvalues and also called the inversion speed, the self-stability of the bike will cause it to tend <b>to</b> <b>steer</b> into the turn, righting itself and exiting the turn, unless a torque is applied in the opposite direction of the turn. At speeds above the capsize speed, the capsize instability will cause it to tend <b>to</b> <b>steer</b> out of the turn, increasing the lean, unless a torque is applied {{in the direction of the}} turn. At the capsize speed no input steering torque is necessary to maintain the steady-state turn.|$|E

5|$|It {{can also}} be seen however that this simple 2-dimensional model, {{essentially}} an inverted pendulum on a turntable, predicts that the steady-state turn is unstable. If the bike is displaced slightly downwards from its equilibrium lean angle, the torque of gravity increases, that of centrifugal force decreases and the displacement gets amplified. A more-sophisticated model that allows a wheel <b>to</b> <b>steer,</b> adjust the path, and counter the torque of gravity, is necessary to capture the self-stability observed in real bikes.|$|E

The experiment analysed carcass and meat quality parameters and the subsequent grading and gross values between Bos indicus bulls and steers that were either –homozygous, heterozygous or +homozygous for the calpastatin gene. Overall bulls produced a heavier carcass (P= 0. 005) that had less marbling (P= 0. 001) and had greater ossification scores (P= 0. 007) when compared <b>to</b> <b>steers.</b> Bulls also produced M.

40|$|A pooled-analysis of feedlot pens {{examined}} the effects of steer age (calf-fed, short yearling, long yearling) and initial body weight on feedlot growth performance. Feed efficiency decreased linearly as initial body weight increased for all age groups of steers. ^ Three feedlot experiments evaluated the effects of NEXT ENHANCE (EO) and monensin/tylosin (MT) on growth performance and carcass characteristics in beef finishing diets. In Exp. 1, there were no MT x EO interactions for finishing performance and carcass characteristics. Feeding MT resulted in a 3. 9 % improvement in G:F compared <b>to</b> <b>steers</b> fed no MT. Feed efficiency was not different between steers fed EO and those not fed EO. In Exp. 2, EO dose (0, 75, 150, 225, or 300 mg/steer daily of EO) was evaluated. Increasing EO dose linearly decreased DMI, but ADG was not different among treatments. Feed efficiency linearly increased as EO dose increased. Feeding EO at 225 and 300 mg/steer daily improved G:F 4. 4 and 3. 8 % compared <b>to</b> <b>steers</b> fed 0 EO. In Exp. 3, concentration of EO (0, 16. 5, 33. 1, or 49. 6 mg/kg of EO) was evaluated. Concentration of EO had no effect on DMI, ADG, or G:F. ^ Two experiments evaluated the effects of ractopamine hydrochloride (RAC) dose and duration on growth performance and carcass characteristics of finishing steers. In Exp. 1, RAC dose (0 or 200 mg/steer daily) and RAC duration (28 or 42 d prior to harvest) were evaluated. Hot carcass weight was 6. 0 kg heavier for steers fed 200 mg/steer daily of RAC for 28 d compared with steers fed 0 RAC for 28 d. Feeding 200 mg/steer daily of RAC increased HCW 4. 0 kg over steers fed 0 RAC for 42 d. In Exp. 2, RAC dose (0, 300, and 400 mg/steer daily) and RAC duration (14, 28, or 42 d) were evaluated. Feeding 300 mg/steer daily of RAC for 28 and 42 d increased HCW by 5. 1 and 7. 6 kg compared <b>to</b> <b>steers</b> fed 0 RAC.

5|$|Another {{factor that}} can also {{contribute}} to the self-stability of traditional bike designs is the distribution of mass in the steering mechanism, which includes the front wheel, the fork, and the handlebar.

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Agricultural EconomicsKevin C. DhuyvetterWhen {{purchasing}} feeder calves, bulls {{are typically}} discounted relative <b>to</b> <b>steers.</b> Most {{would agree that}} a discount is warranted but determining the appropriate discount to apply is considerably more difficult. Being able to calculate this discount under varying conditions would help stock operators maintain {{a certain level of}} profitability or recognize opportunities to make more profit when excessive discounts are being applied. The goals of this study were to determine how castration timing affects performance (as measured by average daily gain), morbidity, and carcass quality and how morbidity affects performance and carcass quality. Ordinary Least Squares regression and logit models were estimated to quantify the effects of various management and environmental factors on performance, morbidity, and carcass quality. These model estimates of production variables along with price and cost assumptions were used to calculate breakeven purchase prices and price discounts for bulls relative <b>to</b> <b>steers,</b> accounting for the possibility of contracting bovine respiratory disease, if owned for a short background period or if ownership is retained through slaughter. Model results confirm that late-castrated steers do indeed exhibit diminished performance and increased morbidity probabilities relative <b>to</b> early-castrated <b>steers.</b> Increased morbidity also decreases average daily gain. However, this study found that castration timing and morbidity during the backgrounding period have minimal effects on carcass quality, with morbidity only impacting hot carcass weight and castration timing significantly affecting days to market and only tending to impact hot carcass weight. Ultimately, based on 2009 market conditions, bulls should be discounted at feeder calf sales compared <b>to</b> <b>steers.</b> The average calf arrived at 459 pounds, and at this weight bulls should be discounted $ 4. 69 /cwt relative to the same weight steers. The discount increases to $ 5. 37 /cwt for 400 pound calves and drops to $ 4. 20 /cwt for 500 pound calves. If ownership is retained through slaughter, required discounts will change to $ 6. 77 /cwt, $ 4. 91 /cwt, and $ 7. 55 /cwt, respectively...|$|R
