50|$|A {{general theory}} is that {{individuals}} must be enticed with some <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>benefit</b> to join an interest group. However, the free rider problem addresses the difficulty of obtaining members of a particular interest group when the benefits are already reaped without membership. For instance, an interest group dedicated to improving farming standards will fight for the general goal of improving farming for every farmer, {{even those who are}} not members of that particular interest group. Thus, there is no real incentive to join an interest group and pay dues if the farmer will receive that benefit anyway. For another example, every individual in the world would benefit from a cleaner environment, but an environmental protection interest groups do not receive monetary help from every individual in the world.|$|E

50|$|Fourth, the {{stakeholder}} {{theory is}} as important as agency theory. Each member of the board must be familiar with the consequences of his or her actions given the competing interest of both internal and external stakeholders with interests in the company. Without familiarity of stakeholder theory, the board member is less than prepared to contribute to an effective governance body. With stakeholder theory the existence of a complex bargaining process involves multiple interests. The multiple competing interests can be found at each level of management within a company, starting at the top with the board of directors. A stakeholder board may be less efficient at generating total benefits. The stakeholder theory defines different groups of interest represented by stakeholders where stakeholders have competing interests yet the desire for the same end, which is to receive some <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>benefit.</b>|$|E

The UNFCCC {{decisions}} on REDD+ are {{silent on the}} issue of rewarding countries and participants for their verified net emission reductions or enhanced removals of greenhouse gases. It is not very likely that specific requirements for sub-national implementation of the distribution of benefits will be adopted, as this will be perceived to be an issue of national sovereignty.

Countries may decide to channel any benefits through an existing program on rural development, for instance, provide additional services (e.g. extension, better market access, training, seedlings) or pay local stakeholders directly. Many financial entities do have specific requirement on the design of a system to use funds received, and reporting on the use of these funds.|$|E

However, previous research has shown that reliable discrimination among different types of benefits is not possible in the typical general household survey. Consequently, research requiring distinctions among benefit types has required that survey data be matched to SSA program records. Such matches are time consuming, difficult to implement, and subject to stringent confidentiality restrictions.

A manufacturer can reap three <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>benefits</b> from offering a user innovation toolkit.

We study these issues for the case of simulator software. A web-based survey was conducted, yielding 2713 responses. We find that the possibility to develop one’s own modules is widely used, and highly valued. All three <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>benefits</b> are found to materialize.

30|$|In-network {{acceleration}} {{has several}} advantages, allowing for faster convergence essentially “without paying any price.” At first glance, {{this appears to}} be a “free lunch” <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>benefit</b> and deservedly makes one skeptical. Actually, the benefit comes from leveraging information that is completely overlooked by fully decentralized methods. To see this, recall that in D-CADMM, each node communicates with only one neighbor each time, without accounting for the entire neighborhood. Instead, H-CADMM manages to exploit network topology by creating virtual LFCs that gather and share information with the whole neighborhood. It is this additional information that enables faster flow of data and hence faster convergence. Therefore, it is not a “free lunch” for H-CADMM, but a lunch “not even tasted” by D-CADMM.|$|E

These category types {{may not be}} mutually exclusive, and some mimics may gain more than one <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>benefit.</b> Here we examined a contentious classic textbook example of mimicry between the cleaner wrasse Labroides dimidiatus and its mimic, the sabre-toothed blenny Aspidontus taeniatus. We found that the benefit obtained by the sabre-toothed blenny varied between four geographical locations. At the Great Barrier Reef, in Indonesia and in the Red Sea, it rarely attacked reef fish victims, but instead relied on other food sources such as substrate items, damselfish eggs and tubeworms. Here, the main function of the mimicry system could be to protect the sabre-toothed blenny from predation (protective mimicry) and was consistent with a previous study in Japan. However, in French Polynesia, the sabre-toothed blenny aggressively attacked reef fish frequently, and potential victims {{were more likely to}} pose to solicit a cleaning interaction. Diet analysis from individuals in French Polynesia indicated material was gleaned from the surface of fish, including large pieces of fin, implying an increase in the benefits obtained from attacking reef fish (aggressive mimicry). This study provides a potential second example of a mimicry system in which multiple types of benefits are gained by a mimic, and importantly, that the benefits obtained by the mimic vary between different environmental conditions and/or geographical locations. This may have important implications for the maintenance and evolution of mimicry systems and may reflect different stages of an arms race with potential victims.

Therefore it is very important to have a sample of individuals that adequately represents the population of pensioners, taking into account these variables.|$|E
