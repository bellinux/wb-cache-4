25|$|Faced with Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman's advance from Chattanooga to Atlanta in {{the spring}} of 1864, Johnston {{conducted}} a series of withdrawals that appeared similar to his Peninsula Campaign strategy. He repeatedly prepared strong defensive positions, only to see Sherman maneuver around them in expert <b>turning</b> <b>movements,</b> causing him to fall back {{in the general direction of}} Atlanta. Johnston saw the preservation of his army as the most important consideration, and hence conducted a very cautious campaign. He handled his army well, slowing the Union advance and inflicting heavier losses than he sustained.|$|E

25|$|Kray's troops reached Alessandria on 12 June and Suvorov {{planned to}} launch {{them into an}} attack on Pérignon's wing early on the 14th. This proved to be impossible, but Kray managed to join Bellegarde's force and he promised to attack on 15 August. Meanwhile, the {{division}} of François Watrin moved down from the hills {{in the direction of}} Tortona, giving every indication that the French offensive was still in full swing. Joubert had hoped that he was facing only 8,000 enemies. But he was stunned to see that he was facing at least 36,000 enemies including Kray's corps in the plains below. Both Pérignon and Saint-Cyr counseled retreat, but Joubert put off a final decision until the next day. Meanwhile, Suvorov assumed that the French army would soon descend into the plains. When the French came forward, Kray and 27,000 soldiers would cut into their left flank while Bagration's 5,700-man Russian advance guard would turn their right flank. With luck the two forces would link hands behind the French. Once the <b>turning</b> <b>movements</b> were well developed, Wilhelm Derfelden's 9,850 Russians and Melas' 8,800 Austrians would join the battle. Farther north, Johann Baptist Alcaini's 5,260-strong force besieged Tortona, covered by Andrei Grigorevich Rosenberg's 8,270 Russians.|$|E
500|$|Sherman's {{record as}} a tactician was mixed, and his {{military}} legacy rests primarily on his command of logistics and on his brilliance as a strategist. The influential 20th-century British military historian and theorist B. H. Liddell Hart ranked Sherman {{as one of the}} most important strategists in the annals of war, along with Scipio Africanus, Belisarius, Napoleon Bonaparte, T. E. Lawrence, and Erwin Rommel. Liddell Hart credited Sherman with mastery of maneuver warfare (also known as the [...] "indirect approach"), as demonstrated by his series of <b>turning</b> <b>movements</b> against Johnston during the Atlanta Campaign. Liddell Hart also stated that study of Sherman's campaigns had contributed significantly to his own [...] "theory of strategy and tactics in mechanized warfare", which had in turn influenced Heinz Guderian's doctrine of Blitzkrieg and Rommel's use of tanks during the Second World War. Another World War II-era student of Liddell Hart's writings about Sherman was George S. Patton, who [...] "'spent a long vacation studying Sherman's campaigns on the ground in Georgia and the Carolinas, with the aid of [...] book'" [...] and later [...] "'carried out his [...] plans, in super-Sherman style'".|$|E
2500|$|All {{the above}} factors are largely in {{response}} to safety but VII could lead to noticeable gains in the operational efficiency of a transportation network. [...] As vehicles will be linked together with a resulting decrease in reaction times, the headway between vehicles could be reduced {{so that there is}} less empty space on the road. Available capacity for traffic would therefore be increased. More capacity per lane will in turn mean fewer lanes in general, possibly satisfying the community's concerns about the impact of roadway widening. VII will enable precise traffic-signal coordination by tracking vehicle platoons and will benefit from accurate timing by drawing on real-time traffic data covering volume, density and <b>turning</b> <b>movements.</b>|$|E

40|$|Collecting {{intersection}} <b>turning</b> <b>movement</b> counts at intersections is {{an essential}} data collection task for many types of traffic engineering studies. On a daily basis, consulting firms and agencies collect <b>turning</b> <b>movement</b> counts that are used for preparing traffic impact studies, determining design hours for road improvements, and the retiming of traffic signals. Although {{there is a substantial}} body of literature on the stochastic nature of traffic volumes and how they vary by time, day of week, and season, the literature is quite sparse on how accurately <b>turning</b> <b>movement</b> counts can be collected at signalized intersections. The objective {{of this paper is to}} characterize the reliability of manual intersection <b>turning</b> <b>movement</b> counts performed with modern data collection technology. Live intersection <b>turning</b> <b>movement</b> counts were performed on three days for three hours to characterize the range and reliability of percent errors. Every user, regardless of interface or device, improved from the first day to the second day, and all but one improved again between the second and third day. There was no clear superior data collection technology, but with the emerging ubiquitous of smart phones and tablets, the cost –benefit of these devices has the potential to change the manual counting techniques of the future.

60|$|Botha and his stalwarts had {{not gone}} far from the capital. Fifteen miles out to the east the railway line runs through {{a gap in the}} hills called Pienaars Poort, and here was such a {{position}} as the Boer loves to hold. It was very strong in front, and it had widely spread formidable flanking hills to hamper those <b>turning</b> <b>movements</b> which had so often been fatal to the Boer generals. Behind was the uncut railway line along which the guns could in case of need be removed. The whole position was over fifteen miles from wing to wing, and it was well known to the Boer general that Lord Roberts had no longer that preponderance of force which would enable him to execute wide <b>turning</b> <b>movements,</b> as he had done in his advance from the south. His army had decreased seriously in numbers. The mounted men, the most essential branch of all, were so ill horsed that brigades were not larger than regiments. One brigade of infantry (the 14th) had been left to garrison Johannesburg, and another (the 18th) had been chosen for special duty in Pretoria. Smith-Dorrien's Brigade had been detached for duty upon the line of communications. With all these deductions and the wastage caused by wounds and disease, the force was in no state to assume a vigorous offensive. So hard pressed were they for men that the three thousand released prisoners from Waterval were hurriedly armed with Boer weapons and sent down the line to help to guard the more vital points.|$|E
60|$|A {{successful}} retreat is a {{poor thing}} for a relieving army to boast of when their gallant friends are hard pressed and worn out. But this withdrawal showed that this force possesses both a leader and machinery of organisation, and it is this, and this alone, that has preserved our confidence. We believe that Buller gauged the capacity of one subordinate at Colenso, of another at Spion Kop, and that now he will do things himself, as he was meant to do. I know not why he has waited so long. Probably some pedantic principle of military etiquette: 'Commander-in-Chief should occupy a central position; <b>turning</b> <b>movements</b> should be directed by subordinates.' But the army believes {{that this is all}} over now, and that for the future Buller will trust no one but himself in great matters; and it is because they believe this that the soldiers are looking forward with confidence and eagerness to the third and last attempt--for the sands at Ladysmith have run down very low--to shatter the Boer lines.|$|E

The British columns flowed over and onwards without a pause, tramping steadily northwards to their destination. The bulk of the Free State forces refused to leave their own country, and moved away to the eastern and northern portion of the State, where the British Generals thought--incorrectly, as the future was to prove--that no further harm would come from them. The State which they were in arms to defend had really ceased to exist, for already it had been publicly proclaimed at Bloemfontein in the Queen's name that the country had been annexed to the Empire, and that its style henceforth was that of 'The Orange River Colony.' Those who think this measure unduly harsh must remember that every mile of land which the Freestaters had conquered {{in the early part of}} the war had been solemnly annexed by them. At the same time, those Englishmen who knew the history of this State, which had once been the model of all that a State should be, were saddened by the thought that it should have deliberately committed suicide for the sake of one of the most corrupt governments which have ever been known. Had the Transvaal been governed as the Orange Free State was, such an event as the second Boer war could never have occurred.|$|E

The research objective is to evaluate the effect of left <b>turn</b> <b>movement</b> elimination in sample networks. The type of intersections considered is restricted to a grid network but is defined by the roadway hierarchy.

50|$|In the United States, some intersections have a three-lens signal without arrows with an {{adjoining}} three-lens signal (with arrows) governing exclusive left- or right-turns. Signals with circular lenses generally control all movements.

At those intersections, the signals with circular lenses govern movements in all directions except those in the direction which the turn signal controls.
