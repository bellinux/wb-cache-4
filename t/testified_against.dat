5|$|Teller became {{controversial}} in 1954 when he <b>testified</b> <b>against</b> Oppenheimer at Oppenheimer's security clearance hearing. Teller had clashed with Oppenheimer many times at Los Alamos over issues relating both to fission and fusion research, and during Oppenheimer's trial {{he was the}} only member of the scientific community to state that Oppenheimer should not be granted security clearance.|$|E
5|$|The suspect list {{drawn up}} by Nove's team {{included}} Nicholas Jacobs, who would be tried for the murder and acquitted in 2014, based on the statements gathered during the second investigation. It transpired during Jacobs' trial {{that two of the}} witnesses who <b>testified</b> <b>against</b> him had been paid expenses to the tune of thousands of pounds during Nove's inquiry.|$|E

5|$|Häyhänen, Fisher's former assistant, <b>testified</b> <b>against</b> {{him at the}} trial. The {{prosecution}} {{failed to}} find any other alleged members of Fisher's spy network, if there were any. The jury retired {{for three and a}} half hours and returned on the afternoon of October 25, 1957, finding Fisher guilty on all three counts. On November 15, 1957, Judge Mortimer W. Byers imposed on Fisher a total sentence of thirty years and fines of three thousand dollars.|$|E
5|$|In {{a series}} of appeals, defense {{attorneys}} presented mitigating evidence of the troubled upbringing of Gardner, who had spent nearly his entire adult life in incarceration. His request for commutation of his death sentence was denied in 2010 after the families of his victims <b>testified</b> <b>against</b> him. Gardner's legal team took the case {{all the way to}} the U.S. Supreme Court, which declined to intervene.|$|E
5|$|Kevin Wacholz, who had portrayed Nailz, {{left the}} WWF shortly after Survivor Series. Upset about his pay from SummerSlam 1992, he confronted WWF owner Vince McMahon and {{reportedly}} attacked him physically. He later <b>testified</b> <b>against</b> McMahon during {{a trial in}} which McMahon was accused of distributing steroids to wrestlers. Wacholz' statements have been reported as having a harmful effect on the prosecution's case because his anger at McMahon overshadowed his testimony.|$|E

5|$|Leading {{up to the}} 2016 presidential election, Booker {{endorsed}} Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination. He was speculated as {{a potential}} vice presidential candidate during the primary and as the general election began, though Booker stated on June 16, 2016 {{that he was not}} being vetted. After the election, in which Donald Trump defeated Clinton, on January 11, 2017, Booker <b>testified</b> <b>against</b> Attorney General nominee Jeff Sessions, the first instance of a sitting senator testifying against another during a cabinet position confirmation hearing.|$|E
5|$|Puk, the {{organizer}} of the first massacre, was captured by British forces while attempting to flee to Austria in May 1945 and was extradited to Yugoslavia several months later, where he committed suicide by slitting his wrists with a razor blade. Luburić, {{the organizer}} of the second massacre, escaped Yugoslavia {{after the war and}} moved to fascist Spain, where he was assassinated by a person generally assumed to have been an agent of the Yugoslav State Security Service (UDBA). Pavelić survived the war and died in Spain in 1959. Stepinac, who failed to publicly condemn the atrocities in Glina, was accused of collaborating with the Ustaše by Yugoslavia's new Communist government and was tried in 1946, where Jednak <b>testified</b> <b>against</b> him. He was subsequently sentenced to sixteen years imprisonment and died while under house arrest in 1960. In 1986, Jednak <b>testified</b> <b>against</b> the Ustaše government's Minister of the Interior, Andrija Artuković, at his trial in Croatia.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} day, the Latter Day Saints {{surrendered to}} 2,500 state troops {{and agreed to}} forfeit their property and leave the state. Smith was immediately brought before a military court, accused of treason, and sentenced to be executed the next morning; Alexander Doniphan, who was Smith's former attorney and a brigadier general in the Missouri militia, refused {{to carry out the}} order. Smith was then sent to a state court for a preliminary hearing, where several of his former allies <b>testified</b> <b>against</b> him.|$|E

Trapper Nelson, angered by his step-brother's actions, <b>testified</b> <b>against</b> {{him at the}} trial for Dykas' murder. Charles was given a 20-year sentence at Raiford Prison. Disillusioned with civilization, Nelson withdrew from the beach, settling deep in the woods on the Loxahatchee River that same December. Using what little money he had and money borrowed from his sister, he bought 800acres.|$|E
5|$|A letter dated 26 September 1985 {{from the}} {{assistant}} director of public prosecutions who prepared the case against Bamber suggests that Mugford not be prosecuted for the burglary, the cheque fraud, and for a further offence of selling cannabis. She subsequently <b>testified</b> <b>against</b> Bamber during his trial in October 1986. The judge told the jury that they could convict Bamber on Mugford's testimony alone. Immediately after the verdict was announced, Mugford sold her story to the News of the World for ₤25,000 (£ in 2016).|$|E
5|$|He was Director of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, {{which he}} helped to found with Ernest O. Lawrence, from 1958 to 1960, and after that he {{continued}} as an Associate Director. He chaired the committee that founded the Space Sciences Laboratory at Berkeley. He also served concurrently as a Professor of Physics at the University of California, Berkeley. He was a tireless advocate of a strong nuclear program and argued for continued testing and development—in fact, he {{stepped down from the}} directorship of Livermore so that he could better lobby against the proposed test ban. He <b>testified</b> <b>against</b> the test ban both before Congress as well as on television.|$|E

5|$|The {{loss of his}} {{security}} clearance ended Oppenheimer's role in government and policy. He became an academic exile, cut off from his former career and the world he had helped to create. The reputations {{of those who had}} <b>testified</b> <b>against</b> Oppenheimer were tarnished as well, and Oppenheimer's reputation was later partly rehabilitated by Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson. The brief period when scientists were hailed as heroes uniquely qualified to comment on public policy was ended, and scientists working within the government were on notice that dissent was no longer tolerated.|$|E
5|$|Šišić and Opačić {{were tried}} in {{absentia}} in Croatia, {{and both were}} {{convicted and sentenced to}} 20 years in prison. Borović, who defected to Croatia a month after the attack, <b>testified</b> <b>against</b> Šišić. Šišić was arrested by Hungarian police at the Horgoš–Röszke border crossing on 9 May 2001. His extradition was requested by both Croatia and Italy. He was ultimately extradited to Italy in June 2002, where he was subsequently tried, convicted, and sentenced to 15 years in prison for five counts of homicide and causing an aircraft disaster. In 2006, he was transferred to Serbia {{for the remainder of the}} prison term. He was released by Serbian authorities in 2008.|$|E
5|$|Several {{witnesses}} <b>testified</b> <b>against</b> him. The widow Eliza Sharp {{testified that}} {{the voice of the}} killer was distinct. A test was devised allowing Mrs. Sharp to hear Beauchamp's voice; she immediately identified it as that of the killer. (Beauchamp claimed he had disguised his voice {{on the night of the}} murder and thought Mrs. Sharp would not recognize it). Patrick Henry Darby, an Old Court partisan, claimed that in 1824, he had a chance encounter with the man he now knew as Beauchamp. Darby said the man – a stranger to him at the time – had asked for Darby's help in prosecuting an unspecified claim against Sharp. The man then identified himself as the husband of Anna Cooke and said he intended to kill Sharp. Based on the circumstantial evidence, Beauchamp was held for trial at the next term of the circuit court in March 1826.|$|E

5|$|While {{stopped on}} the Biggerstaff land, the rebels convicted 36 Loyalist prisoners. Some were <b>testified</b> <b>against</b> by Patriots who had {{previously}} fought alongside them and later changed sides. Nine of the prisoners were hanged before Isaac Shelby brought {{an end to the}} proceedings. His decision to halt the executions came after an impassioned plea for mercy from one of the Biggerstaff women, although accounts vary as to whether it was Martha Biggerstaff, Aaron's wife, or Mary Van Zant Biggerstaff, Benjamin's wife. Many of the Patriots dispersed over the next few days, while all but 130 of the Loyalist prisoners escaped while being led in single file through woodlands. The column finally made camp at Salem, North Carolina.|$|E
5|$|Caesar became consul in 59 BC. His colleague, Marcus Calpurnius Bibulus, was {{an extreme}} aristocrat. Caesar {{submitted}} {{the laws that}} he had promised Pompey to the assemblies. Bibulus attempted to obstruct the enactment of these laws, and so Caesar used violent means to ensure their passage. Caesar was then made governor of three provinces. He facilitated {{the election of the}} former patrician Publius Clodius Pulcher to the tribunate for 58 BC. Clodius set about depriving Caesar's senatorial enemies of two of their more obstinate leaders in Cato and Cicero. Clodius was a bitter opponent of Cicero because Cicero had <b>testified</b> <b>against</b> him in a sacrilege case. Clodius attempted to try Cicero for executing citizens without a trial during the Catiline conspiracy, resulting in Cicero going into self-imposed exile and his house in Rome being burnt down. Clodius also passed a bill that forced Cato to lead the invasion of Cyprus which would keep him away from Rome for some years. Clodius also passed a law to expand the previous partial grain subsidy to a fully free grain dole for citizens.|$|E
5|$|In November 1955, a {{grand jury}} {{declined}} to indict Bryant and Milam for kidnapping, despite their own admissions of having taken Till. Mose Wright and {{a young man named}} Willie Reed, who testified to seeing Milam enter the shed from which screams and blows were heard, both testified in front of the grand jury. After the trial, T.R.M.Howard paid the costs of relocating to Chicago for Wright, Reed, and another black witness who <b>testified</b> <b>against</b> Milam and Bryant, {{in order to protect the}} three witnesses from reprisals for having testified. Reed, who later changed his name to Willie Louis to avoid being found, continued to live in the Chicago area until his death on July 18, 2013. He avoided publicity and even kept his history secret from his wife until she was told by a relative. Reed began to speak publicly about the case in the PBS documentary The Murder of Emmett Till aired in 2003.|$|E
