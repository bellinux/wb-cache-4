500|$|Revolutions per Minute was {{released}} on April 8, 2003. Like The Unraveling, it failed to reach any major record charts, but did reach number thirty-five on the Independent Albums chart in the United States. Critics praised the album for its impassioned lyrics and unique blend of hardcore punk and melodic hardcore; Brian Hiatt of Rolling Stone called Revolutions per Minute [...] "easily among the finest punk records of the past decade". To support the album, Rise Against traveled with other Fat Wreck Chord bands like Anti-Flag, None More Black, and No Use for a Name on North American and Japan based tours, and participated in the 2003 Warped Tour in North America. When asked about the band's early years with Fat Wreck Chords, Principe said: [...] "Our goal was to be on Fat Wreck Chords and just sell enough records so that when we were home from tour, we wouldn't have to get jobs...Of course, that was all before we had families and children and numerous responsibilities. That was the beauty. And then <b>the</b> <b>longer</b> <b>we</b> did it things just kept coming our way." ...|$|E

Written in they key of B Minor, the song's beat is set in common time and moves at a tempo of 120 beats per minute. Houston's voice spans A3 to the note of B4. The song also {{features}} a sample of Loleatta Holloway's 1977 song [...] "We're Getting Stronger (<b>The</b> <b>Longer</b> <b>We</b> Stay Together)". Swizz Beatz explained that the song [...] "is all about the feelings new love can bring".|$|E

2500|$|Therefore, at 10:00am on Monday, 11 February 1963, the Beatles {{began working}} their way through their live set song by song, the number of takes varying on each, and {{finished}} at 10:45pm—less than 13 hours later— capturing in essence an authentic representation of the band's Cavern Club-era sound. The day ended with a cover of [...] "Twist and Shout", {{which had to be}} recorded last because John Lennon had a particularly bad cold and Martin feared the throat-shredding vocal would ruin Lennon's voice for the day. This performance, caught on the first take, prompted Martin to say: [...] "I don't know how they do it. We've been recording all day but <b>the</b> <b>longer</b> <b>we</b> go on the better they get." [...] Mark Lewisohn would later write: [...] "There can scarcely have been 585 more productive minutes in the history of recorded music" [...] Paul McCartney double tracked his vocal on [...] "A Taste of Honey" [...] and Lennon added harmonica onto [...] "There's a Place" [...] during these sessions. Martin overdubbed piano on [...] "Misery" [...] and celesta on [...] "Baby It's You" [...] on 20 February, during which the Beatles were not present.|$|E

Physically, since the width of a window function determines the length of segments of a target, <b>the</b> <b>longer</b> <b>the</b> segment <b>we</b> divide a target into, the more physical composition of the target will be contained in the each component of the observation vector; meanwhile, the overlap across the windows determines the redundancy of the segments.|$|R
