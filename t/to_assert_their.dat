5|$|During that period, the Byzantines were {{generally}} on the defensive, and suffered some catastrophic defeats {{such as the}} razing of Amorium, the home city of the reigning Byzantine dynasty, in 838. Nevertheless, with the waning of the Abbasid Caliphate's power after 842 {{and the rise of}} semi-independent emirates along the Byzantine eastern frontier, the Byzantines were increasingly able <b>to</b> <b>assert</b> <b>their</b> own power.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the 1973 oil crisis, {{combined}} with the growing influence of Third World alignments such as the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and the Non-Aligned Movement, less-powerful countries had more room <b>to</b> <b>assert</b> <b>their</b> independence and often showed themselves resistant to pressure from either superpower. Meanwhile, Moscow was forced to turn its attention inward to deal with the Soviet Union's deep-seated domestic economic problems. During this period, Soviet leaders such as Leonid Brezhnev and Alexei Kosygin embraced the notion of détente.|$|E
5|$|With urbanisation, {{distinctive}} urban accents {{have arisen}} which often differ greatly from the historical accents {{of the surrounding}} rural areas and sometimes share features with Southern English accents. Northern English dialects remain {{an important part of}} the culture of the region, and the desire of speakers <b>to</b> <b>assert</b> <b>their</b> local identity has led to accents such as Scouse and Geordie becoming more distinctive and spreading into surrounding areas.|$|E

5|$|After Yugoslavia's leader Josip Broz Tito died in 1980, long-suppressed ethnic {{nationalism}} revived and {{the individual}} republics began <b>to</b> <b>assert</b> <b>their</b> authority more strongly {{as the federal government}} weakened. Slovenia and Croatia moved towards multi-party democracy and economic reform, but Serbia's authoritarian communist President Slobodan Milošević opposed reform and sought to increase the power of the communist Yugoslav government. In 1990, Slovenia and Croatia held elections that ended communist rule and brought pro-independence nationalist parties to power in both republics. In Croatia, the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) party of Franjo Tuđman took office, with Tuđman as President.|$|E
5|$|John Adams {{was running}} {{this time with}} Charles Cotesworth Pinckney of South Carolina (the elder brother of {{candidate}} Thomas Pinckney from the 1796 election). Hamilton now toured New England, again urging northern electors to hold firm for Pinckney in the renewed hope of making Pinckney president; and he again intrigued in South Carolina. Hamilton's ideas involved coaxing middle-state Federalists <b>to</b> <b>assert</b> <b>their</b> non-support for Adams {{if there was no}} support for Pinckney and writing to more of the modest supports of Adams concerning his supposed misconduct while president. Hamilton expected to see southern states such as the Carolinas cast their votes for Pinckney and Jefferson, and would result in the former being ahead of both Adams and Jefferson.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. {{government}} prevented Du Bois {{from attending}} the 1955 Bandung Conference in Indonesia. The conference was {{the culmination of}} 40 years of Du Bois's dreams– a meeting of 29 nations from Africa and Asia, many recently independent, representing most of the world's colored peoples. The conference celebrated their independence, as the nations began <b>to</b> <b>assert</b> <b>their</b> power as non-aligned nations during the Cold War. In 1958, Du Bois regained his passport, and with his second wife, Shirley Graham Du Bois, he traveled around the world, visiting Russia and China. In both countries he was celebrated and given guided tours of the best aspects of communism. Du Bois later wrote approvingly of the conditions in both countries. He was 90 years old.|$|E

5|$|After {{the death}} of Saladin in 1193, his sons contested control of the sultanate, but Saladin's brother al-Adil became the {{paramount}} Ayyubid sultan in 1200, {{and all of the}} later Ayyubid sultans of Egypt were his descendants. In the 1230s, the emirs of Syria attempted <b>to</b> <b>assert</b> <b>their</b> independence from Egypt and the Ayyubid realm remained divided until Sultan as-Salih Ayyub restored its unity by conquering most of Syria, except Aleppo, by 1247. By then, local Muslim dynasties had driven out the Ayyubids from Yemen, the Hejaz and parts of Mesopotamia. After his death in 1249, as-Salih Ayyub was succeeded in Egypt by al-Mu'azzam Turanshah. However, the latter was soon overthrown by the Mamluk generals who had repelled a Crusader invasion of the Nile Delta. This effectively ended Ayyubid power in Egypt; attempts by the emirs of Syria, led by an-Nasir Yusuf of Aleppo, to wrest back Egypt failed. In 1260, the Mongols sacked Aleppo and conquered the Ayyubids' remaining territories soon after. The Mamluks, who expelled the Mongols, maintained the Ayyubid principality of Hama until deposing its last ruler in 1341.|$|E
5|$|Al-Ashraf's rule in Damascus was stable, {{but he and}} {{the other}} emirs of Syria sought <b>to</b> <b>assert</b> <b>their</b> {{independence}} from Cairo. Amid these tensions, al-Ashraf died in August 1237 after a four-month illness and was succeeded by his brother as-Salih Ismail. Two months later, al-Kamil's Egyptian army arrived and besieged Damascus, but as-Salih Ismail had destroyed the suburbs of the city to deny al-Kamil's forces shelter. In 1232, al-Kamil installed his eldest son as-Salih Ayyub to govern Hisn Kayfa, but upon al-Kamil's death in 1238, as-Salih Ayyub disputed the proclamation of younger brother al-Adil II as sultan in Cairo. As-Salih Ayyub eventually occupied Damascus in December 1238, but his uncle Ismail retrieved the city in September 1239. Ismail's cousin an-Nasir Dawud had Ismail detained in Karak in a move to prevent the latter's arrest by al-Adil II. Ismail entered into an alliance with Dawud who released him the following year, allowing him to proclaim himself sultan in place of al-Adil II in May 1240.|$|E
5|$|Governors {{first began}} <b>to</b> <b>assert</b> <b>their</b> own power during the American Civil War as the General Assembly {{attempted}} to remove {{command of the}} militia from the governor. In response, the General Assembly was effectively suppressed, during which time the governor assumed many powers to appoint public officials, hire and remove state employees, and manage state finances. When the General Assembly reconvened with a majority sympathetic to the governor, he was permitted to continue many of his assumed powers. In 1889, the General Assembly began to reassert its authority over hiring state employees. The issued ended when the Supreme Court {{ruled in favor of}} the legislature, again returning to it final authority over hiring state employees. The legislature passed acts in 1895 that removed the last of the governor's authority to appoint anyone to executive positions.|$|E

60|$|For {{understand}} this well, young men, and settle {{it in your}} hearts as the first condition of human life, yea, {{of the life of}} every rational created being, that a man is justified only by faith; and not only a man, but angels, archangels, and all possible created spirits, past, present, and to come. All stand, all are in their right state, only {{as long as they are}} consciously dependent on God the Father of spirits and his Son Jesus Christ the Lord, in whom they live and move and have their being. The moment they attempt <b>to</b> <b>assert</b> themselves, whether <b>their</b> own power, their own genius, their own wisdom, or even their own virtue, they ipso facto sin, and are justified and just no longer; because they are trying to take themselves out of their just and right state of dependence, and to put themselves into an unjust and wrong state of independence. <b>To</b> <b>assert</b> that anything is <b>their</b> own, <b>to</b> <b>assert</b> that <b>their</b> virtue is their own, just as much as <b>to</b> <b>assert</b> that <b>their</b> wisdom, or any other part of their being, is their own, is to deny the primary fact of their existence--that in God they live and move and have that being. And therefore Milton's Satan, though, over and above all his other grandeurs, he had been adorned with every virtue, would have been Satan still by the one sin of ingratitude, just because and just as long as he set up himself, apart from that God from whom alone comes every good and perfect gift.|$|R
5|$|In {{the early}} 1860s, the Eyalet of Egypt, a {{province}} of the Ottoman Empire, ordered a series of ironclad warships from foreign shipyards. Iclaliye was the last vessel to be ordered by the Egyptian government. The contract was awarded to the Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino shipyard in Trieste, then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in 1868. By this time, Egyptian efforts <b>to</b> <b>assert</b> <b>their</b> independence had angered Sultan Abdülaziz, who on 5 June 1867 demanded Egypt surrender all of the ironclads ordered from foreign shipyards. After lengthy negotiations, Egypt surrendered Iclaliye and the other Egyptian ironclads {{in exchange for the}} central government recognizing greater autonomy, transforming the Eyalet into the Khedivate of Egypt. Iclaliye was a slightly enlarged version of the earlier s that had been built in France, carrying a slightly more powerful armament.|$|E
5|$|The first {{city had}} the {{characteristics}} of large urban centers, such as monumental buildings, and {{seems to have been}} ruled by a kinship based assembly, headed by elders. The pre-Akkadian kingdom was decentralized, and the provincial center of Nabada was ruled by a council of elders, next to the king's representative. The Nagarite monarchs had to tour their kingdom regularly in order <b>to</b> <b>assert</b> <b>their</b> political control. During the early Akkadian period, Nagar was administrated by local officials. However, central control was tightened and the number of Akkadian officials increased, following the supposed environmental event that preceded the construction of Naram-Sin's palace. The post-Akkadian Nagar was a city-state kingdom, that gradually lost its political importance during the early second millennium BC, as no evidence for a king dating to that period exists.|$|E
5|$|The first {{hospital}} {{was founded in}} the town by Bishop Fray Pedro de Silva in 1485. Those affected by the plague epidemic were treated here in 1506. During the 16th century the city experienced a cultural renaissance thanks to personalities such as the painter Luis de Morales, the composer Juan Vázquez, the humanist Rodrigo Dosma, the poet Joaquin Romero de Cepeda, the playwright Diego Sánchez de Badajoz, the Dominican mystic Fray Luis de Granada and architect Gaspar Méndez. In 1524, a board meeting between representatives of Spain and Portugal {{took place in the}} Old Town Hall in the city to clarify the status of their territorial arrangements, attended by Hernando Colón, Juan Vespucio, Sebastián Caboto, Juan Sebastián Elcano, Diego Ribeiro and Esteban Gómez. With reason <b>to</b> <b>assert</b> <b>their</b> rights to the Portuguese Crown, Philip II of Spain briefly moved his court to Badajoz in August 1580. Queen Anne of Austria died in the city two months later, and on 5 December 1580, Philip moved out of the city. From 1580 until 1640, {{as a result of the}} absence of war, the city flourished once again. According to the historian Vicente Navarro del Castillo, some 428 residents of Badajoz contributed to the Spanish conquest of the Americas, including Pedro de Alvarado, Luis de Moscoso, Sebastián Garcilaso de la Vega y Vargas (father of Inca Garcilaso) and Hernán Sánchez de Badajoz. In 1640 the city was attacked during the Portuguese Restoration War.|$|E

In the early nineteenth century, all the previously Spanish possessions in South America as well as Brazil achieved independence. With this new freedom, countries turned <b>their</b> attention <b>to</b> <b>asserting</b> <b>their</b> statehood through the delineation of three constitutive elements: government, territory and population. The new governments had to define {{who were going to}} be considered as nationals, citizens and foreigners, and the rights that pertained to each of these categories. These countries were all concerned with attracting new settlers and very early on introduced constitutional provisions on open borders and equal treatment for foreigners. White, male Europeans were the principal addresses of open borders provisions in an effort to entice them to settle in territories presented as empty to the exclusion of indigenous groups, bring new industries, and contribute to the whitening of mixed race populations. Whilst weak statehood came with independence, forming nations was a much longer process and States used migration and citizenship policies as tools to define nationhood...|$|R
