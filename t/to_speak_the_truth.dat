I only care <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth.</b> The truth is that no one, not Natalie Portman, or even myself can come anywhere close {{to the level of a}} professional ballerina in a year and a half. Period. That doesn't mean that I don't admire Natalie and her acting. She is so talented and can inspire people, as well, with her own art form. She did an amazing job portraying her character in Black Swan. (Though the movie wasn't a completely realistic reflection of ballet or dancers.) My only wish is that Natalie, Darren, and certain others who worked closely on the movie could have grasped the beauty and the heart of true ballet. If they had, they would have advocated for this art more and given the real dancers the credit that they deserve.|$|E

25|$|J.K. Balaganapathy (Sivakumar), {{popularly known}} as JKB, is a gifted carnatic {{musician}} but his wife Bhairavi (Sulakshana), despite her love and loyalty, fails to satisfy or challenge him intellectually. For JKB, this, and her inability to have children, is a problem. Gajapathi (Janagaraj) works for JKB as a tambura musician, {{and he is a}} compulsive liar. The film starts with an introduction of all characters of the film followed by JKB going to a concert where he finds Gurumoorthy (Delhi Ganesh), who works for JKB as a Mridangam musician, drunk. He instructs Gurumoorthy to leave the premises and performs in the concert without the use of Mridangam which is considered a basic/compulsory instrument to perform a carnatic concert. When Gurumoorthy is asked to permanently leave the band, he promises not to drink again. While Bhairavi's grandfather is going to receive his pension, which he does on the first of every month, Gajapathi lies to him that his pension has been cancelled. The old man starts crying and JKB intervenes to confirm that his pension is not canceled and that he can go and collect it. JKB then scolds Gajapathi for it and tells him the old man could have died on hearing such a lies, as he is very particular about his pension. Following this, when JKB finds out that Gajapathi has lied to him too and others causing problems he asks him to promise <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth.</b>|$|E

The album won five Latin Grammys at the Latin Grammy Awards of 2009 including [...] "Album of the Year". The group generated controversy when vocalist/lyricist Residente was hosting the 2009 MTV Latin America Awards and attempted to inform the audience about a strike in Puerto Rico in protest of governor Luis Fortuño's cutting of thousands of government jobs, one of which belonged to Residente's mother.

2500|$|The inquisitorial process {{consisted}} {{of a series of}} hearings, in which both the denouncers and the defendant gave testimony.

Interrogation of the defendant was done {{in the presence of the}} Notary of the Secreto, who meticulously wrote down the words of the accused.

2500|$|Also in Sister Outsider is [...] "The Transformation of Silence into Language and Action.*" [...] Lorde {{discusses}} {{the importance of}} speaking, even when afraid because one's silence will not protect them from being marginalized and oppressed. [...] Many people fear <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> because of how it may cause pain, however, one ought to put fear into perspective when deliberating whether to speak or not. [...] Lorde emphasizes that [...] "the transformation of silence into language and action is a self-revelation, and that always seems fraught with danger." [...] People are afraid of others' reactions for speaking, but mostly for demanding visibility, which is essential to live. [...] Lorde adds, [...] "We can sit in our corners mute forever while our sisters and ourselves are wasted, while our children are distorted and destroyed, while our earth is poisoned; we can sit in our safe corners mute as bottles, and we will still be no less afraid."

His remarks triggered debate from netizens, as it seemed to contravene the practices of the Communist Party, particularly in its suppression of dissent. Analysts noted that Wen's message was aimed at party members, and not necessarily the general public because Wen believes freedom of speech has deteriorated since Hu Jintao's accession to power and has negatively affected China's political landscape and international reputation. His comments also ostensibly addressed the pervasive [...] "fake-talking" [...] present in Chinese political circles, in an attempt to curb systemic and institutional woes stemming from officials who are afraid <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth.</b>|$|E
