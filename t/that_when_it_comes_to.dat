500|$|However, preeminent Holocaust scholar Raul Hilberg {{said the}} book {{expressed}} views Hilberg himself subscribed to in substance, {{in that he}} too found the exploitation of the Holocaust, as Finkelstein describes, [...] "detestable". Asked on another occasion if Finkelstein's analysis might play {{into the hands of}} neo-Nazis for antisemitic purposes, Hilberg replied: [...] "Well, even if they do use it in that fashion, I'm afraid <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> the truth, it has to be said openly, without regard to any consequences that would be undesirable, embarrassing".|$|E

500|$|A 2006 study {{published}} by Indiana University tried {{to compare the}} substantive amount of information of The Daily Show against prime time network news broadcasts, and concluded <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> substance, there is little difference between The Daily Show and other news outlets. The study contended that, since both programs are more focused {{on the nature of}} [...] "infotainment" [...] and ratings than on the dissemination of information, both are broadly equal in terms of the amount of substantial news coverage they offer.|$|E
500|$|The {{music of}} Agneepath has {{received}} positive reviews from critics. Joginder Tuteja praised the compositions {{and added that}} [...] "Chikni Chameli" [...] {{would be responsible for}} the rise in sales of the album. Sukanya Verma of Rediff.com gave the album 3 out of 5 stars and said that the film's soundtrack was better than that of the original, while praising the composition of the songs [...] "Deva Shree Ganesha" [...] and [...] "O Saiyyan". A review carried by BBC UK summed up, [...] "Blessedly free of unnecessary remixes, Agneepath is a well-crafted, evocative collection of songs that proves the adage <b>that,</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> Indian music composers, sometimes two heads can be better than one.|$|E
500|$|Todd McCarthy of Variety {{gave the}} film a {{positive}} review, saying [...] "Lasseter and Pixar broke new technical and aesthetic {{ground in the}} animation field with Toy Story, and here they surpass it in both scope and complexity of movement while telling a story that overlaps Antz in numerous ways." [...] James Berardinelli of ReelViews gave the film {{three and a half}} stars out of four, saying [...] "A Bug's Life, like Toy Story, develops protagonists we can root for, and places them {{in the midst of a}} fast-moving, energetic adventure." [...] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film three and a half stars out of four, saying [...] "Will A Bug's Life suffer by coming out so soon after Antz? Not any more than one thriller hurts the chances for the next one. Antz may even help business for A Bug's Life by demonstrating how many dramatic and comedic possibilities can be found in an anthill." [...] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times gave the film four out of five stars, saying [...] "What A Bug's Life demonstrates is <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> bugs, the most fun ones to hang out with hang exclusively with the gang at Pixar." [...] Peter Stack of the San Francisco Chronicle gave the film four out of four stars, saying [...] "A Bug's Life is one of the great movies – a triumph of storytelling and character development, and a whole new ballgame for computer animation. Pixar Animation Studios has raised the genre to an astonishing new level".|$|E

500|$|In {{the fourth}} week of November – {{well into the}} lucrative Christmas sales period and close to {{four months after the}} concerts – Harrison voiced his {{frustration}} at the stalemate with Capitol on ABC's late-night chat show, The Dick Cavett Show. Harrison was on the program to promote the Raga documentary with Shankar, but after making a surprise guest performance with Gary Wright's new band Wonderwheel, he launched into a complaint about his US record company's interference and threatened to take the whole album package to Columbia. With the outburst attracting unfavourable attention in the press, where Capitol were viewed as [...] "profiteering on the backs of famine victims", the company eventually backed down and agreed to release the album on Harrison's terms. Of all the labels involved, only Columbia would make any money from The Concert for Bangladesh – 25 cents on every copy sold. Although none of these royalties went to the artist, Dylan and his record company were already benefiting from the exposure provided by the Bangladesh concerts, through the timely release of Bob Dylan's Greatest Hits Vol. II. Of the other featured artists at the Concert for Bangladesh, the careers of both Preston (A Records) and Russell (Shelter) likewise prospered {{as a result of their}} participation, but their record companies imposed no such conditions on Apple and Capitol. In January 1972, Melody Makers Richard Williams remarked in his Concert for Bangladesh album review: [...] "Between them, Capitol and CBS have proved <b>that,</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> awareness and enlightenment, the business is still several years behind the musicians." ...|$|E
500|$|The series 10 episode [...] "Love Will Tear Us Apart", {{which saw}} Maddy stood up by Dan on a return visit from France, was {{selected}} as a televisual pick of the day by The Guardian, the Daily Mirror, and the Birmingham Mail. The Guardian critic Gareth McLean was critical of the episode, writing: [...] "Now here's an idea for another Holby spin-off - one set in the hospital's STD clinic. Of course, given the ceaseless intra-departmental shagging {{that goes on in}} that hospital, there might be too much crossover with existing shows, with not a look-in for characters who aren't actually on staff. Here, sexist surgeon Clifford returns to complicate Maddy's life, though since she's been sleeping with Sam, who's slept with Connie, Chrissie and Faye, she appears to need no help in that area.She's going to die." [...] The Sun journalist Anita Baig has also commented critically on the character, noting <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> medicine, Maddy [...] "always seems to be having difficulties." [...] Daily Mirror [...] critic Jim Shelley has discussed the outlandish nature of the character's storylines, dubbing the line [...] "I don't know why people complain about the NHS" [...] from a 2007 episode his 'Naive statement of the week', explaining: [...] "Hmmmm let's see. Abra covering up that he was operating on his arms-dealer father. Maddy hiding the fact she killed her junkie sister's daughter. And secret cokehead Jesus Of Nazareth (Robert Powell) keeping quiet about counselling Elliot's son for heroin addiction. Oh yeah, and in Casualty, in Holby's A department, nurse Ruth Winters secretly fixed her dad's breathalyser test. Anyone detect a theme emerging?" [...] Shelley has, however, also deemed Maddy to be one of Holby Citys [...] "few really good, realistic, characters".|$|E

2500|$|Although The Hollywood Reporter {{declared}} {{the film to}} be [...] "a rather rarified effort that will probably appeal more to adults than to children," [...] it described it as [...] "charming" [...] and commented that, [...] "Arriving amidst {{a tidal wave of}} overblown and frequently charmless big studio efforts, [...] "Sita Sings the Blues" [...] is a welcome reminder <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> animation bigger isn't necessarily better." ...|$|E

2500|$|After {{a career}} that spanned eight decades, British {{illustrator}} Denis McLoughlin gained a degree of long overdue recognition in the late-1990s for his hard-boiled detective illustrations that graced book covers produced primarily for the London publishing house of T.V. Boardman, Ltd. (Boardman Books). It is this work, no doubt, with which McLoughlin will always be most strongly associated. Bio-bibliographer David Ashford claims for McLoughlin, [...] "In the history of British Illustration {{there is no one}} who can be reasonably compared to him. He does not fit anywhere into the British tradition." [...] Ashford concludes <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> hard-boiled illustration, McLoughlin is simply the best.|$|E

[...] "I have {{said in the past}} – and I'll repeat again – that the best reparations we can provide are good schools in the inner city and jobs for people who are unemployed," [...] Obama said. An apology for slavery would be appropriate but not particularly helpful in improving the lives of African Americans, he said. Reparations could also be a distraction, Obama said. [...] "I consistently believe <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> whether it's Native Americans or African-American issues or reparations, {{the most important thing for}} the U.S. government to do is not just offer words, but offer deeds," [...] Obama told a meeting in Chicago in July 2008.|$|E
2500|$|Robert A. Dahl {{argues that}} the {{fundamental}} democratic principle is <b>that,</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> binding collective decisions, each person in a political community is entitled to have his/her interests be given equal consideration (not necessarily that all people are equally satisfied by the collective decision). He uses the term polyarchy to refer to societies in which there exists a certain set of institutions and procedures which are perceived as leading to such democracy. First and foremost among these institutions is the regular occurrence of free and open elections which are used to select representatives who then manage {{all or most of}} the public policy of the society. However, these polyarchic procedures may not create a full democracy if, for example, poverty prevents political participation. Similarly, Ronald Dworkin argues that [...] "democracy is a substantive, not a merely procedural, ideal." ...|$|E
