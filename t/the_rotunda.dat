5|$|Visitors {{typically}} {{arrive at}} a tram station in the arrival plaza located between the administrative buildings and the Museum entrance. A large set of steps leads to the main doors of <b>the</b> <b>rotunda</b> building. <b>The</b> <b>rotunda</b> building houses information desks, two orientation theatres and Museum shops. It also holds a grand staircase that starts a path toward the paintings located {{on the second floor}} of each art pavilion. <b>The</b> <b>rotunda</b> opens to the south to a terrace that links all five of the Museum pavilions. A separate building to the west of the arrival plaza and stairs holds a cafeteria and restaurant. Next to the restaurant is a stone arch, which separates the Museum from the GRI. Stairs from the terrace connecting the GRI and the restaurant lead down to the central garden.|$|E
5|$|In 1984, Truman was posthumously {{awarded the}} United States Congressional Gold Medal. In 1991, he was {{inducted}} into the Hall of Famous Missourians, and a bronze bust depicting him is on permanent display in <b>the</b> <b>rotunda</b> of the Missouri State Capitol.|$|E
5|$|The main axes of {{the museum}} grid that is offset by 22.5 degrees begins with the arrival plaza, carries through {{the edge of the}} stairs up to the main entrance, aligns with the columns {{supporting}} <b>the</b> <b>rotunda</b> as well as the center point of <b>the</b> <b>rotunda,</b> aligns with travertine benches in the courtyard between the pavilions, includes a narrow walkway between the west and south pavilions, a staircase down to the cactus garden and ends in the garden. The corresponding cross axis starts with the center point of the circle forming the GRI library garden, then passing {{to the center of the}} entrance rotunda, and aligning with the south wall of <b>the</b> <b>rotunda</b> building. Although all of the Museum is aligned on these alternative axes, portions of the exhibitions pavilion and the east pavilion are aligned on the true north-south axis as a reminder that both grids are present in the campus.|$|E

50|$|The Procession of Life {{continues}} in <b>the</b> <b>Rotunda's</b> floor with <b>the</b> mosaic panel Vital Energy, {{which shows the}} Genius of Life—an Eros-like figure with butterflies and pine cones. At <b>the</b> <b>Rotunda's</b> center, four tondi mosaics representing the Genius of Water, the Genius of Fire, the Genius of Air, and the Genius of Earth surround a larger tondo mosaic of Earth as the Life-giver. A mosaic band, or guilloche, interlaces the five tondi and depicts the fossil life of the Great Plains. Meière based the fossil mosaics on scientific illustrations drawn by University of Nebraska geologist Erwin Hinckley Barbour. The Procession of Life concludes at <b>the</b> <b>Rotunda's</b> south entrance with The Family.|$|R
5|$|When {{the casket}} {{reached the top}} of the steps, Nancy Reagan and her {{military}} escort met it. As the casket passed them, Nancy momentarily pulled away from her escort, reached out, and touched the casket. They followed it inside to <b>the</b> <b>rotunda.</b>|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} to Washington following the G8 summit, President George W. Bush and First Lady Laura Bush visited <b>the</b> <b>rotunda</b> {{to pay their}} respects. Many world leaders did the same, including interim Iraqi President Ghazi al-Yawer, former Polish president Lech Wałęsa, Gorbachev, and Thatcher, Reagan's good friend and associate.|$|E
5|$|MacArthur had {{requested}} {{to be buried}} in Norfolk, Virginia, where his mother had been born and where his parents had married. Accordingly, on 11 April, his funeral service was held in St Paul's Episcopal Church in Norfolk and his body was finally laid to rest in <b>the</b> <b>rotunda</b> of the Douglas MacArthur Memorial (the former Norfolk City Hall and later courthouse).|$|E

50|$|In 2012, the University {{began an}} {{extensive}} construction project to repair and renovate <b>the</b> aging <b>Rotunda.</b> <b>The</b> {{first phase of}} the project will replace <b>the</b> <b>Rotunda's</b> copper roof. Although the engineers were several months ahead of schedule, the roof remained an unpainted copper for the graduating class of 2013. The project is slated to finish in 2016.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> two <b>Rotundas</b> are {{category}} B listed buildings, with <b>the</b> South <b>Rotunda</b> {{identified as}} being [...] "at risk".|$|R
5|$|Meier also {{designed}} three other buildings located {{next to the}} north promontory and offset at a 22.5 degree angle from the main axis of the Museum pavilions. The north-most building is an auditorium. Next to it is the North Building, with the East Building sitting between the North Building and <b>the</b> <b>rotunda.</b> The main entrance to the East Building is flanked by two round silos that hold its elevators. A bridge over a sunken courtyard links the main entrance of the East Building to the main walkway that connects the auditorium and North Buildings to <b>the</b> <b>rotunda.</b> These buildings house the Getty Conservation Institute (GCI), the J. Paul Getty Trust and the Getty Foundation. These buildings are generally {{closed to the public}} except for special events held in the auditorium. They are linked to the Museum both by landscaped terraces and by an enclosed glass walkway that leads from the main rotunda.|$|E
5|$|On 15 May 2013, Lloyd Webber {{revealed}} a £4 million {{restoration of the}} theatre to mark its 350th anniversary. Using a team of specialist heritage tradesmen, the detailed restoration has returned the public areas of <b>the</b> <b>Rotunda,</b> Royal Staircases and Grand Saloon, {{all of which were}} part of the 1810 theatre, to their original Regency style.|$|E
5|$|On June 17, 1996, a -long boom {{portion of}} a {{construction}} crane crashed at the construction site, scraping the stone {{on the east side}} of the building, but not injuring anyone. Due to the fragile sandstone exterior, the damage on <b>the</b> <b>rotunda</b> was not repaired. In January 1997, construction crews finished the demolition portion of the project and finished the structural reinforcement part before they began the interior construction phase.|$|E
50|$|Originally, three-storey red {{and white}} brick towers stood {{alongside}} <b>the</b> <b>Rotundas,</b> containing <b>the</b> hydraulic accumulators that powered the lifts, but these have been demolished.|$|R
5000|$|The towers were {{completed}} in 1971 and incorporated <b>the</b> <b>rotundas</b> in <b>the</b> base. <b>The</b> <b>Rotundas</b> {{were used as}} a communications centre and a civil service sports club, amongst other things. By the time the towers were complete, the three separate ministries had merged into the Department of the Environment, and having separate towers proved inefficient. The bland frontage of the blocks, described in Nikolaus Pevsner's architectural guides as [...] "the very image of faceless bureaucracy", was much criticised and local people nicknamed them as [...] "the three ugly sisters".|$|R
50|$|He {{was married}} to Kyndra Rotunda (and {{divorced}} in 2014). <b>The</b> <b>Rotundas</b> were on faculty at George Mason University School of Law until departing in 2008 for Chapman University.|$|R
5|$|Ross was {{the first}} {{governor}} to set aside a day for civic improvements, declaring the third Friday in January to be Arbor Day, when schoolchildren should endeavor to plant trees. He also supported the legislature's efforts to purchase the Huddle portrait gallery, a collection of paintings of each governor of Texas. These paintings continue to hang in <b>the</b> <b>rotunda</b> of the Texas State Capitol.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, {{a lawsuit}} by the Alliance Defense Fund, a {{conservative}} Christian {{group in the}} United States, was brought against the state of Washington when it permitted a public display of a holiday tree and a menorah but not a nativity scene. Because of the lawsuit, {{the decision was made}} to permit a nativity scene to be displayed in <b>the</b> <b>rotunda</b> of the state Capitol, in Olympia, as long as other symbols of the season were included.|$|E
5|$|In the game's {{multiplayer}} mode, Zeus (Corey Burton), the King of the Olympian Gods, Ares (Steven Blum), the God of War, Poseidon (Gideon Emery), the God of the Sea, and Hades (Fred Tatasciore), the God of the Underworld, {{appear as}} statues at <b>the</b> <b>Rotunda</b> of Olympus where the player selects one to align to, {{after which the}} chosen god will communicate with the player during gameplay. Castor and Pollux, the demigod Hercules (Kevin Sorbo), the Titan cyclops Polyphemus, the Gorgon Stheno, and the giant scorpion Skorpius also appear in the multiplayer as bosses and/or environmental obstacles.|$|E

50|$|On the inside, the {{courthouse}} has a <b>rotunda</b> on both <b>the</b> {{second and third}} floors with a main corridor spanning the length of <b>the</b> building. Each <b>rotunda</b> is made of marble pilaster columns with decorative murals in niches located near them. Both <b>the</b> <b>rotundas</b> and corridors are made from cut and polished marble with decorative copper handrails and hand-blown, egg-shaped glass light fixtures.|$|R
50|$|Hood {{died of a}} {{heart attack}} on October 7, 1998. His body lay in state in <b>the</b> Capitol <b>rotunda,</b> <b>the</b> first {{legislator}} to receive the honor.|$|R
5|$|Still in office, Borah died in {{his sleep}} of a {{cerebral}} hemorrhage {{at his home in}} Washington, D.C., aged 74, on January 19, 1940. His state funeral at the U.S. Capitol was held in the Senate chamber on Monday, January 22. A second funeral was held three days later at the Idaho State Capitol in Boise, where Borah's casket lay beneath <b>the</b> <b>rotunda</b> for six hours prior to the service. An estimated 23,000 passed by the bier or attended the funeral. He is buried in Morris Hill Cemetery in Boise.|$|E
5|$|The casket {{was placed}} under <b>the</b> <b>rotunda,</b> where it lay in state on Abraham Lincoln's catafalque. An evening {{memorial}} service then took place, with dignitaries primarily composed of Congressional members, {{members of the}} United States Supreme Court, and the diplomatic corps; the Reverend Daniel Coughlin, Chaplain of the House of Representatives, gave the invocation. Eulogies were then delivered by Senate President pro tempore Ted Stevens, House Speaker Dennis Hastert, and Vice President Dick Cheney.|$|E
5|$|The semicircular apse fits {{naturally}} {{with the}} other vaults of <b>the</b> <b>rotunda</b> despite being larger, and features vaults on its north and south walls. The marble ambon was situated {{in the middle of}} the circle of columns and of the whole rotunda, directly under the dome's centre, as evidenced by a mortar padding. Stairs from the east and west, aligned with the apse, used to lead up to the ambon. The bishop's throne or cathedra probably lay near one of the south vaults, which was likely enlarged for the purpose.|$|E
50|$|The Glasgow Harbour Tunnel Rotundas are two iconic {{red brick}} stone {{buildings}} which flank the River Clyde in the Finnieston area of Glasgow. <b>The</b> North <b>Rotunda</b> {{is located on}} Tunnel Street with <b>the</b> South <b>Rotunda</b> at Plantation Place.|$|R

5|$|George Washington had {{fourteen}} handwritten {{copies of}} the Bill of Rights made, one for Congress and {{one for each of}} the original thirteen states. The copies for Georgia, Maryland, New York, and Pennsylvania went missing. The New York copy is thought to have been destroyed in a fire. Two unidentified {{copies of the}} missing four (thought to be the Georgia and Maryland copies) survive; one is in the National Archives, and the other is in the New York Public Library. North Carolina's copy was stolen from the State Capitol by a Union soldier following the Civil War. In an FBI sting operation, it was recovered in 2003. The copy retained by the First Congress has been on display (along with the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence) in <b>the</b> <b>Rotunda</b> for the Charters of Freedom room at the National Archives Building in Washington, D.C. since December 13, 1952.|$|E
5|$|Liberty Bell {{refers to}} one of two replicas in Portland, Oregon, United States, of the {{original}} Liberty Bell in Philadelphia. The first replica was purchased in 1962, and installed in <b>the</b> <b>rotunda</b> of City Hall in 1964. On November 21, 1970, it was destroyed in a bomb blast that also damaged the building's east portico. The second replica was installed outside of City Hall soon after the blast (c. 1972) with funds from private donations. It was constructed at the McShane Bell Foundry in Baltimore and dedicated on November 6, 1975. The bell is listed as a state veterans memorial by the Oregon Department of Veterans' Affairs.|$|E
5|$|On April 25, 1935 at 6:43pm, a {{custodial}} engineer {{called the}} Salem Fire Department to report smoke. Citizens helped to remove {{items from the}} smoky building, but when firefighters arrived, they ordered everyone to leave the structure, which was soon engulfed in flame. Among the helping citizens was twelve-year-old Mark Hatfield, who later became governor. It was determined the fire started {{in the basement of}} the east wing and quickly spread to piles of old records. A strong updraft in the hollow columns enclosing the dome's eight supporting steel lattice girders pulled the flames through <b>the</b> <b>rotunda</b> to upper stories. The intense heat burned even the copper dome and lit the night sky.|$|E
