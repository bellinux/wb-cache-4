5|$|Hemimetabolous insects, {{those with}} {{incomplete}} metamorphosis, change gradually by undergoing {{a series of}} molts. An insect molts when it outgrows its exoskeleton, which does not stretch and would otherwise restrict the insect's growth. The molting process begins as the insect's epidermis secretes a new epicuticle inside the old one. After this new epicuticle is secreted, the epidermis releases a mixture of enzymes that digests the endocuticle and thus detaches the old cuticle. When this stage is complete, the insect makes its body swell by taking in a large quantity of water or air, which makes the old cuticle split along predefined weaknesses where the old exocuticle was <b>thinnest.</b>|$|E
5|$|While parody {{sometimes}} {{served as}} {{a special kind of}} translation, some translations returned the compliment by providing a parodic version of the Elegy in their endeavour to accord to the current poetic style in the host language. An extreme example was provided by the classicised French imitation by the Latin scholar John Roberts in 1875. In place of the plain English of Gray’s “And all that beauty, all that wealth e’er gave”, he substituted the Parnassian Tous les dons de Plutus, tous les dons de Cythère (All the gifts of Plutus and of Cytherea) and kept this up throughout the poem in a performance that its English reviewer noted as bearing only the <b>thinnest</b> relation to the original.|$|E
5|$|Enamel is {{the hardest}} and most highly mineralized {{substance}} of the body. It {{is one of the}} four major tissues which make up the tooth, along with dentin, cementum, and dental pulp. It is normally visible and must be supported by underlying dentin. 96% of enamel consists of mineral, with water and organic material comprising the rest. The normal color of enamel varies from light yellow to grayish white. At the edges of teeth where there is no dentin underlying the enamel, the color sometimes has a slightly blue tone. Since enamel is semitranslucent, the color of dentin and any restorative dental material underneath the enamel strongly affects the appearance of a tooth. Enamel varies in thickness over the surface of the tooth and is often thickest at the cusp, up to 2.5mm, and <b>thinnest</b> at its border, which is seen clinically as the CEJ. The wear rate of enamel, called attrition, is 8 micrometers a year from normal factors.|$|E

30|$|This {{work closely}} follows that of Nishizono (2010), the major {{difference}} being the definitions of <b>thinning</b> intensity {{and the addition of}} fertilisation. Analyzing the models using a <b>thinning</b> intensity defined as the volume removed in a previous <b>thinning,</b> as was used by Nishizono (2010) resulted in a poorer fit. The definition of <b>thinning</b> intensity that was implemented (volume removed divided by time since <b>thinning)</b> results in the effect of the <b>thinning</b> in the model dwindling over time. The stands in the data set were only <b>thinned</b> once; hence only one <b>thinning</b> was modelled. It is not intuitive how to modify the implemented <b>thinning</b> intensity definition for multiple entries. Two options are to either accumulate the <b>thinning</b> intensities or to calculate the <b>thinning</b> intensity as if a previous <b>thinning</b> had not been done.

5|$|The {{atmospheric}} {{effect of}} surface friction with winds aloft force surface winds to slow and back counterclockwise {{near the surface}} of the Earth blowing inward across isobars (lines of equal pressure), when compared to the winds in frictionless flow well above the Earth's surface. This layer where friction slows and changes the wind is known as the planetary boundary layer, sometimes the Ekman layer, and it is thickest during the day and <b>thinnest</b> at night. Daytime heating thickens the boundary layer as winds at the surface become increasingly mixed with winds aloft due to insolation, or solar heating. Radiative cooling overnight further enhances wind decoupling between the winds at the surface and the winds above the boundary layer by calming the surface wind which increases wind shear. These wind changes force wind shear between the boundary layer and the wind aloft, and is most emphasized at night.|$|E
5|$|The grenade did possess several {{problems}} with its design. Users were urged to actually {{run up to}} the tank and place it by hand, rather than throw it, thus the adhesive could very easily stick to their uniform in the process; the user would then {{be placed in the}} unenviable situation of attempting to pry the grenade loose whilst still holding onto the lever. It was also discovered that as time passed the nitroglycerin began to deteriorate and become unstable, which made it even more difficult to use. As the grenade was a short-range weapon, users were trained to hide in a trench or other place of concealment until the tank went past them, and then to stick the grenade {{to the rear of the}} tank, where its armour was <b>thinnest.</b> Users were relatively safe from a few yards away, as long as they were not in line with the handle when it detonated.

40|$|Graduation date: 2002 <b>Thinning</b> {{of young}} Douglas-fir forests has the {{potential}} to enhance structural diversity and improve habitat for wildlife. I examined the effects of <b>thinning</b> and <b>thinning</b> intensity on abundance and demographic characteristics of forest-floor small mammals in the Coast Range of Oregon 5 and 6 years after <b>thinning</b> had occurred. <b>Thinning</b> resulted in greater densities of Townsend's chipmunks (Tamias townsendii), creeping voles (Microtus oregoni), and Pacific jumping mice (Zapus trinotatus), and densities of chipmunks and creeping voles were greater in heavily <b>thinned</b> stands than in moderately <b>thinned</b> stands. Movement of female chipmunks was less in heavily <b>thinned</b> stands and movement of female deer mice was less in <b>thinned</b> stands. Sex ratios of deer mice and creeping voles were skewed toward females in heavily <b>thinned</b> stands. Body mass of male deer mice was also greater in heavily <b>thinned</b> stands. <b>Thinning</b> had neutral effects on density of deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) and on populations of Trowbridge's shrews (Sorex trowbridgii), Baird's shrews (Sorex bairdi), Pacific shrews (Sorexpacjflcus), and shrew-moles (Neurotrichus gibbsii). Northern flying squirrels (Glaucomys sabrinus) were more abundant in unthmnned stands than in <b>thinned</b> stands 5 years after <b>thinning</b> had occurred. Greater amounts of small-diameter down wood and slash, and increases in percent cover of low shrubs after <b>thinning</b> may partially explain the increases in abundance of chipmunks, Pacific jumping mice, and creeping voles in <b>thinned</b> stands. <b>Thinning</b> young Douglas-fir forests appears to enhance habitat quality for most species of forest-floor small mammals.
