40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the consequences on the physical workload of new solutions in the forklift cab environment for the driver by quantifying the physical workload on the neck, shoulders, arms and wrists as an effect of steering systems. Twelve male subjects conducted identical test cycles with three types of steering: normal, tilted and miniature. The physical load on the drivers was evaluated using goniometry, inclinometry and electromyography. No major differences were detected when comparing the normal to the <b>tilted</b> <b>steering</b> <b>wheel.</b> The miniature <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> showed, in comparison to the normal <b>steering</b> <b>wheel,</b> lower velocity for the right and left wrists, lower elevation and lower velocity for the left upper arm, a reduction in load on the right trapezius muscle, respectively, and most noticeably a 6 -fold increase in the "static" load and a 10 -fold decrease in the time for rest/recovery for the left wrist extensor muscles. The <b>tilted</b> <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> did not have any significant effect on the workload. However, the effects of the miniature <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> indicate an increased risk for over exertion resulting in disorders of the wrist and forearm for the left side. Relevance to industry: When introducing new techniques or changes in technical systems, it is essential to evaluate the effects on the human workload with objective measurements...|$|R
50|$|In 1994, Ford updated {{the hood}} on the {{medium-duty}} F-Series {{to a more}} aerodynamic design. For the B-Series swan song, the chassis stayed the same but the new aerodynamic cowl was applied. Inside, the 1980s instrument panel and steering column were retained, although a <b>tilt</b> <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> became an option. Buses with this option are distinguished by their Navistar-sourced <b>steering</b> <b>wheels.</b> This generation became {{the first of the}} B-Series to be powered exclusively by diesel engines; their increasing popularity in conventional school buses led to their standardization in 1990, following suit with International (Navistar).|$|R
50|$|Although a new thirteenth {{generation}} New Yorker {{was introduced}} for 1988, the twelfth generation continued {{for one more}} abbreviated model year as the 1988 New Yorker Turbo.

One of its most pioneering innovations was the button-controlled <b>tilt</b> <b>steering</b> <b>wheel,</b> {{making it one of the}} first vehicles with such feature. The speedometer was placed at the center of the foldable two-spoke <b>steering</b> <b>wheel.</b> The futuristic center console and control levers were inspired by an aircraft cockpit.|$|R
