5|$|For {{the letter}} experiment, they asked 219 Japanese {{undergraduate}} students to rate {{each of the}} 45 hiragana, part of the Japanese writing system, according to how much <b>they</b> <b>liked</b> <b>it.</b> For the number experiment, they asked 269 Japanese undergraduate students to rate the numbers between 0 and 49 on attractiveness. The number 49 {{was chosen as the}} upper limit to mask the true aim of the study, which 31 (being the maximum number of days in a month) might have hinted at. Likewise, the number 0 was included for disguise. Participants had to give ratings on a six-point scale, ranging from 1 if they disliked the number very much, to 6 if <b>they</b> <b>liked</b> <b>it</b> very much. Once done, participants were asked for various demographic data, including their birthday.|$|E
5|$|The film's budget {{climbed from}} an initial US$150 {{million to a}} then-record-breaking $207 million, making it {{at one point the}} most {{expensive}} film yet made. Universal only agreed to such an outlay after seeing a screening of the unfinished film, to which executives responded enthusiastically. Marketing and promotion costs were an estimated $60 million. The film's length also grew; originally set to be 135 minutes, it soon grew to 200, prompting Universal executives to fly to New Zealand to view a rough cut, but <b>they</b> <b>liked</b> <b>it</b> so their concerns were addressed.|$|E
5|$|Artist and {{inventor}} Bill Lishman created two sculptures {{for this}} section of the park, as well as some smaller works for application to the buildings. The most prominent is a dragon {{at the entrance to the}} Dragon Fire, which had originally been intended to hold a sign, but the park management decided <b>they</b> <b>liked</b> <b>it</b> enough for it to be a standalone sculpture. Lishman was allowed to design it from scratch, as opposed to follow preset designs established before he was hired, taking him and assistant Richard Van Heuvelan two months to complete. The other main sculpture was the wild boar at Wild Beast, both this and the dragon being built at his home in Blackstock, Ontario, for about $75,000. Signs by Lishman included Sherwood Florist, Boo Boo's Buggys, an ice cream cone, and for a popcorn counter.|$|E

25|$|In name {{directories}} in the Netherlands, the prefixes {{are always}} ignored for sorting (e.g., Van Rijn is ordered under 'R', but written in full. So a listing would be Raamdonck, Van Rijn, Rutgers and not Vaandrig, Van Rijn, Vondel). A Dutch surname may often contain an article and/or a preposition, preceding the noun. Sometimes {{these have been}} merged with the name. Many Dutch surnames originated from different personal qualities, geographical locations, and occupations. However, Dutch names in English directories (e.g., reference lists of scientific papers) may be ordered on the full name including all prefixes (Van Rijn would be ordered under 'V'), partly because many Dutch emigrant families to English-speaking countries have had their prefixes capitalized for them, whether <b>they</b> <b>liked</b> <b>it</b> or not, like Martin Van Buren or Steve Van Dyck, and normal practise in English is to order on the first capitalized element.|$|E

500|$|When {{the game}} was {{localized}} for distribution in America, Capcom changed {{the title of the}} game from Rockman to Mega Man. This moniker was created by Capcom's then-Senior Vice President Joseph Marici, who claimed it was changed merely because he did not like the original name. [...] "That title was horrible," [...] Marici said. [...] "So I came up with Mega Man, and <b>they</b> <b>liked</b> <b>it</b> enough to keep using it for the U.S. games." [...] 1UP.com's Nadia Oxford attributed this change to Capcom's belief that American children would be more interested in a game with the latter title.|$|E

Because The Simpsons had been airing for such a long time, he found it {{difficult}} to think of a story that had not been done before. He finally based the plot on the British reality series Wife Swap after a suggestion from his girlfriend Jane Fallon, and wrote the character Charles to resemble David Brent, the character Gervais played on The Office. While working on the episode, Gervais made sure to make use of his favorite characters from The Simpsons, such as Lenny. He revealed to the press {{for the first time in}} December 2004 that he was writing an episode, commenting that [...] "I've got the rough idea but this is the most intimidating project of my career.
