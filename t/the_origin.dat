5|$|<b>The</b> <b>origin</b> of the endomembrane {{system is}} linked to <b>the</b> <b>origin</b> of eukaryotes {{themselves}} and <b>the</b> <b>origin</b> of eukaryoties to the endosymbiotic origin of mitochondria. Many models have been put forward to explain <b>the</b> <b>origin</b> of the endomembrane system (reviewed in). The most recent concept suggests that the endomembrane system evolved from outer membrane vesicles the endosymbiotic mitochondrion secreted. This OMV-based model for <b>the</b> <b>origin</b> of the endomembrane system is currently the one that requires {{the least amount of}} novel inventions at eukaryote origin and explains the many connections of mitochondria with other compartments of the cell.|$|E

5|$|The dorsal and pelvic fins are angular, {{with the}} first dorsal fin larger than the second. The {{pectoral}} fins are narrow, pointed, and falcate (sickle-shaped); their shape separates this species from the similar-looking nurse shark. <b>The</b> <b>origin</b> of the first dorsal fin is about even with <b>the</b> <b>origin</b> of the pelvic fins, while <b>the</b> <b>origin</b> of the anal fin is even with or somewhat behind <b>the</b> <b>origin</b> of the second dorsal fin. The caudal fin has a shallow upper lobe and barely present lower lobe, comprising {{about a quarter of}} the total length in adults. The dermal denticles are diamond-shaped, bearing 45 faint ridges radiating from a blunt point. Tawny nurse sharks are yellowish, reddish, or grayish brown above and off-white below, and are capable of slowly changing their color to better blend with the environment.
