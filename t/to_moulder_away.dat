All I ask {{is to be}} left alone <b>to</b> <b>moulder</b> <b>away</b> in solitude. It's obvious that the world's going as fast as it can to--the Nethermost Pit, and all I can do is to sit still and consume as much of my own smoke as possible."

My soul is drawn toward old Pendle, yon, with a love passing that of woman, heartless and passionless though the huge mass be. Heartless!' said he, after a pause,--'heartless! when every minute there is a fresh {{expression}} upon its beautiful front? Ay, even so, for it looms yonder calm and unconcerned when we are ushered into the world, and when we are ushered out of it, and laid <b>to</b> <b>moulder</b> <b>away</b> under the mountain's shadow; and it will rear its bold bluffs to heaven and smile in the sunlight or frown in the gloom after we who now love to gaze upon it are blind to the solemn loveliness of its impassable face.

6000|$|With a wild whimsiness, he {{now used}} his coffin for a sea-chest; and {{emptying}} into it his canvas bag of clothes, set {{them in order}} there. Many spare hours he spent, in carving the lid with all manner of grotesque figures and drawings; {{and it seemed that}} hereby he was striving, in his rude way, to copy parts of the twisted tattooing on his body. And this tattooing had been the work of a departed prophet and seer of his island, who, by those hieroglyphic marks, had written out on his body a complete theory of the heavens and the earth, and a mystical treatise on the art of attaining truth; so that Queequeg in his own proper person was a riddle to unfold; a wondrous work in one volume; but whose mysteries not even himself could read, though his own live heart beat against them; and these mysteries were therefore destined in the end <b>to</b> <b>moulder</b> <b>away</b> with the living parchment whereon they were inscribed, and so be unsolved to the last. And this thought it must have been which suggested to Ahab that wild exclamation of his, when one morning turning away from surveying poor Queequeg--"Oh, devilish tantalization of the gods!" ...|$|E
5000|$|The second body {{is called}} Linga-Sarira, (Sanskrit, from linga meaning {{characteristic}} mark, model, pattern + sarira, from the verbal root sri <b>to</b> <b>moulder,</b> waste <b>away).</b> A pattern or model that is impermanent; the model-body or astral body, {{only slightly more}} ethereal than the physical body. It is the astral model around which the physical body is built, and from which the physical body flows or develops as growth proceeds.|$|R
5000|$|The first body {{is called}} sthula-sarira (Sanskrit, from sthula meaning coarse, gross, not refined, heavy, bulky, {{fat in the}} sense of bigness, {{conditioned}} and differentiated matter + sarira <b>to</b> <b>moulder,</b> waste <b>away).</b> A gross body, impermanent because of its wholly compound character. The physical body is usually considered as the lowest substance-principle. The physical form {{is the result of the}} harmonious co-working on the physical plane of forces and faculties streaming through their astral vehicle or linga-sarira, the pattern or model of the physical body.|$|R
60|$|It is {{a curious}} fact that if you deprive the cocoa-nut tree of the verdant tuft at its head, it dies at once; and if allowed to stand thus, the trunk, which, when alive, is encased in so hard a bark as to be almost {{impervious}} <b>to</b> a bullet, <b>moulders</b> <b>away,</b> and, in an incredibly short period, becomes dust. This is, perhaps, partly owing to the peculiar constitution of the trunk, a mere cylinder of minute hollow reeds, closely packed, and very hard; but, when exposed at top, peculiarly fitted to convey moisture and decay through the entire stem.|$|R

"This proceeds, {{without all}} question," [...] added the Mahometan, [...] "from some {{enormous}} sin, {{but what it}} is, I know not: and whatsoever reflections I can make, I am not able to find what has drawn upon us so dreadful a misfortune." [...] "There is nothing more clear," [...] replied Xavier; [...] "God, who detests the prayer of infidels, has permitted a worship <b>to</b> <b>moulder</b> <b>away,</b> which is displeasing to him; and gives you thence to understand, that he condemns your sect." [...] The Saracen was not satisfied with this reason, nor with any other argument which Xavier used against the Alcoran. While they were thus disputing, a Caciz, or doctor of the law, joined company with them, having made the same complaint concerning the mosques, how little they were frequented, and how cold was grown the devotion of the people. [...] "I have taken my measures," [...] said he, [...] "and if in two years Mahomet comes not in person to visit the congregations of the faithful, who acknowledge him for God's true prophet, I will certainly look out for some other religion." [...] Xavier took pity on the folly of the Caciz, and endeavoured all he could to convert him at that instant from Mahometanism; {{but he could not}} prevail upon an obstinate mind, blinded with the opinion of its own reason; and therefore the father acquiesced in the decrees of that Providence, which has fixed the times and revolutions for the conversion of infidels and sinners.|$|E
60|$|I {{walked through}} and through the town {{all the rest of}} the day, and could have walked there until now, I think. In one place, there was a very pretty modern theatre, where they had just {{performed}} the opera (always popular in Verona) of Romeo and Juliet. In another there was a collection, under a colonnade, of Greek, Roman, and Etruscan remains, presided over by an ancient man who might have been an Etruscan relic himself; for he was not strong enough to open the iron gate, when he had unlocked it, and had neither voice enough to be audible when he described the curiosities, nor sight enough to see them: he was so very old. In another place, there was a gallery of pictures: so abominably bad, that it was quite delightful <b>to</b> see them <b>mouldering</b> <b>away.</b> But anywhere: in the churches, among the palaces, in the streets, on the bridge, or down beside the river: it was always pleasant Verona, and in my remembrance always will be.|$|R

When I lighted my candles, he fell into meek transports with the room that was revealed to him; and when I heated the coffee in an unassuming block-tin vessel in which Mrs. Crupp delighted to prepare it (chiefly, I believe, {{because it was not}} intended for the purpose, being a shaving-pot, and because there was a patent invention of great price <b>mouldering</b> <b>away</b> in the pantry), he professed so much emotion, that I could joyfully have scalded him.|$|R

I thought these, often intermingled with {{the old days of}} the city: with its beauties, tyrants, captains, patriots, merchants, counters, priests: nay, with its very stones, and bricks, and public places; all of which lived again, about me, on the walls.

The writing was just legible enough to keep a keen antiquity-hunter on a doubtful chase; here and there he would be completely thrown out, and then there would be a few words so plainly written as to put him on the scent again. In this way he had been led on for a whole day, until he had found himself completely at fault.|$|R
