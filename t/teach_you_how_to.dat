He further stated that the past can bring people [...] "down a road" [...] {{because they are not}} aware of it. According to him, [...] "The time spent with a father will teach you a certain understanding of live and how to cope and deal with things. The lack of a father being there can also <b>teach</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> deal with life – and that’s what 'Sins Of The Father' is about... That statement was made because that’s something that I felt." [...] Usher added that the song itself is a [...] "kind of testament" [...] for the father he is.|$|E
500|$|Following the {{win against}} Matthysse, {{negotiations}} {{for a fight}} against Kaizer Mabuza began. Both sides eventually agreed to a March 5 bout, with the vacant IBF Light Welterweight title on the line. Former champion Pernell Whitaker joined Judah's training camp to help him prepare for the match. Whitaker said: [...] "I don't train guys to be like me. I help guys {{to do the things}} that work for them. If I can <b>teach</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> hit and not get hit, that's a blessing for you. Zab has the same abilities I have, but Zab still has to put it together and do it the way that Zab knows how to do it." [...] On March 5, 2011, Judah defeated Mabuza via technical knockout in the seventh round, at the Prudential Center in Newark, New Jersey, claiming the IBF title again after almost ten years.|$|E
500|$|Madonna herself {{would later}} say: [...] "I wouldn't say I regret it. I've made {{mistakes}} and learned from them. Most {{people want to}} hear me say that I regret publishing my Sex book. I don't. What was the problem was releasing my Erotica album at the same time. I love that album and it got overlooked." [...] However, author Andy Koopmans in his book Madonna (2002) would comment that the singer regretted both publishing Sex and recording Erotica and that the book [...] "had affected everything she did later". It was not until 2003 that Madonna would once again declare that she regretted nothing; [...] "I'm not apologizing in any shape or form [...] I was interested in pushing buttons and being rebellious and being mischievous and trying to bend the rules. There was a lot of irony in the Sex book and I am poking fun at a lot of things and I am being kind of silly and adolescent and I am being very f you, if a man can do it, I can do it." [...] A year earlier on 2002, Naomi Campbell confessed to [...] "have {{a lot of respect for}} Madonna being bold enough to come out and do a book on sex. I've never reneged on that". However, in 2009, rapper Vanilla Ice, who was Madonna's boyfriend at the time of the book's creation, confessed to not being happy with the book once he saw it. [...] "My friends were like, 'Dude, that's cool man', but I was like, 'I'm dating her, it's not cool to see your girlfriend with all these other people' [...] It kinda ruined the whole thing. I wonder what her kids think of that book? Here she is writing kids' books now but they're going to see it and go, 'Mommy, what were you thinking?'" [...] Another of the book's models, actress Isabella Rossellini, told Out magazine that she regretted her participation on the book; [...] "I don't think the book worked, even though the photos were extraordinary, and some of them quite memorable. I think there was a little bit of a moralistic sort of 'I'll <b>teach</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> be free!' – and that bothered the hell out of me." ...|$|E

2500|$|During the 2008 season, {{prior to}} the hiring of Gaston, the Blue Jays had a record of 35–39. Once Gaston and his coaches took over the Blue Jays went 51–37 to finish with an 86–76 record. The {{offensive}} improvements under Gaston {{were one of the}} reasons for the resurgence and as the hitting coach, Tenace was credited with rejuvenating a stagnant offense. Adam Lind commented: [...] "The thing is, a lot of people can <b>teach</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> hit, but not a lot of people can <b>teach</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> hit in the big leagues", referring to the major league experience of Gaston and Tenace.Blue Jays' former center fielder Vernon Wells has said he likes the approach to hitting that Tenace teaches: [...] "One thing Gene talks about is having that approach mentally when you go up there, in your mind you already guarantee yourself that one run on third, but you want to do more than that. Gene always says that first runner is a gimme, you should be able to come through in pretty much every situation like that. And then you try to do more damage than just that one run".|$|E
2500|$|Oppewall {{obtained}} her master's {{degree from}} Bryn Mawr in 1969 {{and moved to}} Los Angeles, California. At age 22, she was given a job answering phones at the Venice studio of Charles Eames. According to some sources, Paul Schrader arranged an interview between Oppewall and Eames when he was writing a magazine article about the Eameses. Oppewall, however, has claimed she got the job while visiting the Charles Eames office as a guest and, upon leaving, casually asked a secretary whether there were any jobs available. Upon taking the job, Charles Eames told Oppewall, [...] "I can <b>teach</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> draw, I cannot <b>teach</b> <b>you</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> think or see. If you can think and you can see, you can stay." [...] Oppewall worked with him for eight years, during which time Eames, in Oppewall's words, [...] "saw something in me I didn't know was there." [...] By {{the end of her}} time with Eames, she was helping design and organize Eames museum exhibits. Eames made more than 100 small personal and educational films in that time and, {{as a result of her}} exposure to them, Oppewall said she got into the film business [...] "by accident." ...|$|E

Thus, while CRS includes swimming, boating, hiking, ping pong, soccer, basketball, tennis, and other sports, its focus is on providing opportunities for intellectual growth, for development of leadership skills, and appreciation {{of the value of}} diversity. The program challenges campers to try new things, but also offers them the option of participating or not, a freedom some have never experienced before. Campers work together in peer-led teams {{to take care of the}} daily maintenance needs of the camp. Counselors are skilled in a variety of disciplines from lifesaving to Japanese wrestling to filmmaking. There is instruction by staff, visiting alumni, guests, or other students on subjects like international affairs, poetry, theater, microscopes, filmmaking, creative writing, landscaping, history, music, art, drama, philosophy, ethics, and nature. Three weekly newspapers, written and produced by campers, document the comedic, artistic, and overall progress of the camp.|$|E
