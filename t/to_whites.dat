Waters's performances across Europe in the 1950s and at Newport helped popularize blues {{to a broader}} audience, especially <b>to</b> <b>whites.</b> The album {{is said to be}} one of the first live blues albums.|$|E
5|$|On {{the issue}} of slavery, Smith took {{different}} positions. Initially he opposed it, but during the mid-1830s when the Mormons were settling in Missouri (a slave state), Smith cautiously justified slavery in a strongly anti-abolitionist essay. Then in the early 1840s, after Mormons had been expelled from Missouri, he once again opposed slavery. During his presidential campaign of 1844, he proposed ending slavery by 1850 and compensating slaveholders for their loss. Smith said that blacks were not inherently inferior <b>to</b> <b>whites,</b> and he welcomed slaves into the church. However, he opposed baptizing them without permission of their masters, and he opposed interracial marriage.|$|E
5|$|In March 1978, Smith {{reached an}} accord with three African leaders, led by Bishop Abel Muzorewa, who offered {{to leave the}} white {{population}} comfortably entrenched {{in exchange for the}} establishment of a biracial democracy. As a result of the Internal Settlement, elections were held in April 1979, concluding with the United African National Council (UANC) carrying a majority of parliamentary seats. On 1 June 1979, Muzorewa, the UANC head, became prime minister and the country's name was changed to Zimbabwe Rhodesia. The Internal Settlement left control of the Rhodesian Security Forces, civil service, judiciary, and a third of parliament seats <b>to</b> <b>whites.</b> On 12 June, the United States Senate voted to lift economic pressure on the former Rhodesia.|$|E

50|$|Black women {{experience}} more wage equality in comparison <b>to</b> <b>white</b> women than black men do <b>to</b> <b>white</b> men. By the mid-1970s, wages for {{black and white}} women were almost equal; however, since then, black women's wages have decreased about 10 percent relative <b>to</b> <b>white</b> women's wages. This difference that emerged {{has been attributed to}} the increase of white women in the labor force following the mid-1970s.|$|R

25|$|Nearing {{the end of}} his {{bachelor}} of arts studies, he decided to continue on to a master's degree, securing a TEF grant to fund it; he studied for this degree from October 1965 until September 1966, completing his dissertation on Islam in West Africa. During this period, the family moved from Golders Green to Bletchingley in Surrey, where Tutu worked as the assistant curate of St Mary's Church. In the village, he encouraged cooperation between his Anglican parishioners and the local Roman Catholic and Methodist communities. Tutu's time in London helped him to jettison any bitterness <b>to</b> <b>whites</b> and feelings of racial inferiority; he overcame his habit of automatically deferring <b>to</b> <b>whites.</b>|$|E
25|$|Claflin University, {{founded in}} 1869 by the American Missionary Association, {{is the oldest}} {{historically}} black college in the state. After the Democratic-dominated legislature closed the university in 1877, before passing a law to restrict admission <b>to</b> <b>whites,</b> it designated Claflin as the only state college for blacks.|$|E

25|$|Much of {{the wealth}} of the Barclay family was founded on the slave trade: David and Alexander Barclay were engaged in the slave trade in 1756; David Barclay owned a great {{plantation}} in Jamaica, later freeing his slaves and coming to appreciate their equivalence <b>to</b> <b>whites.</b>|$|E
25|$|Lowndes County, in the Black Belt, {{had been}} an area of large cotton {{plantations}} before the Civil War. Devoted to agriculture, in 1890 the county had the highest proportion of Negroes <b>to</b> <b>whites</b> of any in Alabama. Most blacks worked as sharecroppers cultivating cotton.|$|E

25|$|In his Notes, Jefferson {{contemporarily}} described {{blacks as}} inherently (fixed nature) inferior <b>to</b> <b>whites</b> in critical reasoning and beauty, but superior in musical ability. Jefferson {{believed that the}} bonds of love for blacks were weaker than those for whites. According to one scholar, William Peden, this idea about fixed nature was Jefferson's rationalized justification for the racial caste of slavery.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, some {{industries}} {{were established in}} Mississippi, but jobs were generally restricted <b>to</b> <b>whites,</b> including child workers. The lack of jobs also drove some southern whites north to cities such as Chicago and Detroit, seeking employment, where they also competed with European immigrants. The state depended on agriculture, but mechanization put many farm laborers out of work.|$|E
25|$|When Utah {{territory}} was created, suffrage {{was only}} granted to free white males. At that time, {{only a few}} states had allowed black suffrage. Brigham Young explained that this {{was connected to the}} priesthood ban. He argued that black suffrage would help make blacks equal <b>to</b> <b>whites,</b> which would result in a curse. On January 10, 1867, Congress passed the Territorial Suffrage Act, which prohibited denying suffrage based on race or previous condition of servitude, which nullified Utah's ban on black suffrage.|$|E
25|$|During Reconstruction, black legislators {{had been}} a {{majority}} in the lower house of the legislature. The new requirements, applied under white authority, led to only about 15,000 of the 140,000 eligible blacks qualifying to register. In practice, many more blacks were prohibited from voting by the subjective voter registration process controlled by white registrars. In addition, the Democratic Party primary was restricted <b>to</b> <b>whites</b> only. By October 1896, there were 50,000 whites registered, but only 5,500 blacks, in a state in which blacks were the majority.|$|E

25|$|At first, only African Americans {{were buying}} R discs. According to Jerry Wexler of Atlantic Records, sales were {{localized}} in African-American markets; {{there was no}} white sales nor white radio play. During the early 1950s, more white teenagers started {{to become aware of}} R and to purchase the music. For example, 40% of 1952 sales at Dolphin's of Hollywood record shop, located in an African-American area of Los Angeles, were <b>to</b> <b>whites.</b> Eventually, white teens across the country turned their music taste towards rhythm and blues.|$|E
25|$|Julia {{seemed to}} believe that blacks were not fully equal <b>to</b> <b>whites,</b> but she refused to lend any support to white supremacists, {{including}} her brother Louis Dent. She strongly encouraged blacks on the White House domestic staff to buy land in the District {{while it was still}} cheap, in order to ensure their future financial security. She also decided to greet anyone properly dressed—regardless of race—who attended her afternoon receptions, but never questioned why blacks failed to call on her. The simple answer was that White House security prevented them from doing so.|$|E
25|$|The Plessy {{decision}} {{was not all}} bad for civil rights. For example, in Missouri ex rel. Gaines v. Canada (1938), Lloyd Gaines was a black student at Lincoln University of Missouri, one of the historically black colleges in Missouri. He applied for admission to the law school at the all-white University of Missouri, since Lincoln {{did not have a}} law school, but was denied admission due solely to his race. The Supreme Court, applying the separate-but-equal principle of Plessy, held that a State offering a legal education <b>to</b> <b>whites</b> but not to blacks violated the Equal Protection Clause.|$|E
