5|$|Cacti have {{a variety}} of uses: many species are used as {{ornamental}} plants, others are grown for fodder or forage, and others for food (particularly their fruit). Cochineal is the product of an insect <b>that</b> <b>lives</b> on some cacti.|$|E
5|$|Local legend {{tells of}} a giant crab, eight tatami mats in size, <b>that</b> <b>lives</b> in the Kamegaike Pond in Old Ikata's Futami neighborhood.|$|E
25|$|Several {{life history}} forms of Arctic {{grayling}} occur: fluvial populations <b>that</b> <b>live</b> and spawn in rivers; lacustrine populations <b>that</b> <b>live</b> and spawn in lakes; and potamodromous populations <b>that</b> <b>live</b> in lakes and spawn in tributary streams.|$|R
50|$|Among {{the species}} <b>that</b> <b>lived</b> here are: Zalmoxes, Telmatosaurus, Balaur, Rhabdodon, Magyarosaurus and Struthiosaurus. Other prehistoric creatures <b>that</b> <b>lived</b> among them, without being dinosaurs are: Allodaposuchus and Hatzegopteryx.|$|R
50|$|These beetles live in forests. They can {{be found}} in {{lowlands}} or in mountains. Species <b>that</b> <b>live</b> in trees have wings; those <b>that</b> <b>live</b> mostly on the ground are often wingless.|$|R
5|$|A key {{stress on}} both {{freshwater}} and marine ecosystems is habitat degradation including water pollution, {{the building of}} dams, removal of water for use by humans, {{and the introduction of}} exotic species. An example of a fish that has become endangered because of habitat change is the pallid sturgeon, a North American freshwater fish <b>that</b> <b>lives</b> in rivers damaged by human activity.|$|E
5|$|Hindu scriptures, {{dated to}} between 5th century and 1st century BC, while {{discussing}} human diet, initially suggest kosher meat may be eaten, evolving {{it with the}} suggestion that only meat obtained through ritual sacrifice can be eaten, then that one should eat no meat because it hurts animals, with verses describing the noble life as one <b>that</b> <b>lives</b> on flowers, roots and fruits alone.|$|E
5|$|In April 2010, Linguswamy's Paiyaa released. A romantic road-trip film, {{featuring}} a blockbuster album by Yuvan Shankar Raja, {{it was very}} successful. For the first time, he enacted a character <b>that</b> <b>lives</b> in an urban area. He said that he accepted the film because he desperately wanted to play a cool dude on screen. Karthi's performances in Aayirathil Oruvan and Paiyaa earned him further nominations at the 58th Filmfare Awards South in the Best Actor category. Both films were dubbed into Telugu as Yuganiki Okkadu and Aawara, respectively, and were successful.|$|E
5000|$|Anthropic {{organisms are}} organisms that show anthropophily, where the {{adjective}} synanthropic [...] refers to organisms <b>that</b> <b>live</b> close to human settlements and houses, and eusynathropic to those <b>that</b> <b>live</b> within human housing.|$|R
50|$|Epifauna, {{also called}} epibenthos, are aquatic animals <b>that</b> <b>live</b> {{on the bottom}} {{substratum}} as opposed to within it, that is, the benthic fauna <b>that</b> <b>live</b> {{on top of the}} sediment surface at the seafloor...|$|R
50|$|The first tribe was the Mipedians, which {{consisted}} of lizard-like creatures <b>that</b> <b>lived</b> in the Overworld deserts. The second was the Danians, which included ant-like creatures <b>that</b> <b>lived</b> in the Underworlds Mount Pillar location.|$|R
5|$|Nests may be {{protected}} from physical threats such as flooding and overheating by elaborate nest architecture. Workers of Cataulacus muticus, an arboreal species <b>that</b> <b>lives</b> in plant hollows, respond to flooding by drinking water inside the nest, and excreting it outside. Camponotus anderseni, which nests in the cavities of wood in mangrove habitats, deals with submergence under water by switching to anaerobic respiration.|$|E
5|$|The {{variegated}} fairywren (Malurus lamberti) is a fairywren <b>that</b> <b>lives</b> {{in diverse}} habitats across most of Australia. Four subspecies are recognised. In {{a species that}} exhibits sexual dimorphism, the brightly coloured breeding male has chestnut shoulders and azure crown and ear coverts, while non-breeding males, females and juveniles have predominantly grey-brown plumage, although females of the subspecies rogersi and dulcis (previously termed lavender-flanked fairywren) have mainly blue-grey plumage.|$|E
5|$|While an Australian Cattle Dog {{generally}} works silently, it will bark {{in alarm}} or to attract attention. It has a distinctive intense, high-pitched bark. Barking {{can be a}} sign of boredom or frustration, although research has shown that pet dogs increase their vocalisation when raised in a noisy environment. It responds well to familiar dogs, but when multiple dogs are present, establishing a pecking order can trigger aggression. It is not a breed <b>that</b> <b>lives</b> in a pack with other dogs.|$|E
50|$|The larvae feed on Cornus sanguinea. Larvae can {{be found}} in June and August. Larvae <b>that</b> <b>live</b> on green leaves are green and larvae <b>that</b> <b>live</b> on red leaves are red. It overwinters as a pupa.|$|R
5000|$|In 1991, {{there were}} 142 [...] "permanent residents" [...] {{including}} 19 minors. [...] "Residents" [...] are families <b>that</b> <b>live</b> in Antarctica or scientists <b>that</b> have <b>lived</b> {{for more than}} two years. They were 121 men and 21 women <b>that</b> <b>lived</b> mostly in the colony of Esperanza and other bases. As of 1998-1999, Argentine Antarctica had a winter population of 165.|$|R
50|$|The term aquatic can {{in theory}} {{be applied to}} animals <b>that</b> <b>live</b> in either fresh water (fresh water animals) or salt water (marine animals). However, the {{adjective}} marine is most commonly used for animals <b>that</b> <b>live</b> in saltwater, i.e. in oceans, seas, etc.|$|R
5|$|A popular tourist destination, Ambohimanga {{received}} 97,847 {{visitors in}} 2011. Visitors to the World Heritage Site are charged a fee (10,000 ariary for foreigners and 400 ariary for locals), which is largely {{used to pay}} for the preservation of the site. The commune of Ambohimanga Rova is a small but thriving rural village <b>that</b> <b>lives</b> on agriculture and services provided to tourists and pilgrims who visit the royal city. Multilingual tour guides can be hired at the site to provide detailed descriptions of its features and history. Photographs are permitted outdoors but prohibited inside the historic buildings. Tourism has been negatively affected at the site {{as a consequence of the}} 2009 Malagasy political crisis; management of the site has also been hampered by political instability and reduced revenues since 2009.|$|E
5|$|Adamussium colbecki is a large, slow-growing scallop <b>that</b> <b>lives</b> on the seabed. The shell {{consists}} {{of a pair of}} ribbed calcareous valves which enclose the soft body and are joined by a ligament at a hinge. It feeds on microscopic green algae and is sometimes present in great numbers. It is able to move around by flapping its valves and to dart backwards to escape threats. The species is an important member of the Antarctic seabed community as the upper valve often acts as a substrate for seaweeds, sponges and other organisms. In addition, juveniles bind themselves by threads to the upper valve of older shells, using these as a base for several years as they grow. The adult scallops have been used in research to study the accumulation of heavy metals in marine organisms.|$|E
5|$|Despite the setback, {{the team}} {{returned}} to the Eastern Conference Finals during the lockout-shortened 1994–95 season and defeated the Philadelphia Flyers four games to two. They swept the heavily favored Detroit Red Wings to win New Jersey's first-ever Stanley Cup, as they brought the Cup across the Hudson River from New York, after the Rangers had won it the year before. The 1995 Devils team became the first to give the players a day with the Stanley Cup, a tradition <b>that</b> <b>lives</b> on with each Cup winner. Claude Lemieux was awarded the Conn Smythe Trophy as playoffs MVP. The success came amid constant rumors that the team would move {{for the third time}} in its history to Nashville.|$|E
50|$|Different organisms {{have devised}} {{different}} strategies {{in order to}} control what goes {{in and out of the}} cell. Bacteria and eukaryotic cells contain phospholipid bilayers containing ester linkages, while archaea contain ether linkages. While these mechanisms work very well for organisms <b>that</b> <b>live</b> in mesophilic environments, they do not work for extremophiles. Mesophiles are organisms <b>that</b> <b>live</b> within relatively moderate temperatures (20-45 °C). They are organisms <b>that</b> <b>live</b> around sea level and can survive around the same temperatures as humans.|$|R
25|$|Farm cats (also called barn cats) are cats <b>that</b> <b>live</b> on {{agricultural}} {{properties in}} feral or semi-feral condition. They primarily live outdoors, usually sheltering in outbuildings. They hunt vermin such as rodents {{and other small}} animals <b>that</b> <b>live</b> in or around outbuildings and farm fields.|$|R
50|$|After the {{partitioning}} of Armenia and {{the death}} of Arsaces III, many Armenians <b>that</b> <b>lived</b> in Western Armenia moved into Eastern Armenia which included many of the Nakharars. The Armenians <b>that</b> <b>lived</b> under Sassanid rule, requested to Shapur III from him an Arsacid King.|$|R
5|$|In the game, {{the player}} {{controls}} Scarygirl, {{a young girl}} with an eye patch, a sewn-shut mouth and a hook-capped tentacle for one arm. The girl, an orphan, was raised and cared for by Blister, an intelligent, mustached octopus that built the girl a tree house to live in. Plagued by recurring nightmares that featured a mysterious man, the girl consults Bunnyguru, a rabbit <b>that</b> <b>lives</b> {{in the bottom of}} the tree where the girl makes her home. Bunniguru offers a vision of a city far away from the girl's home. The girl is then sent by Blister into a forest to investigate why the Tree of Life is losing its leaves, where she discovers that one of the keepers of the forest has been kidnapped and taken to the city from Bunnyguru's vision, and becomes tasked with seeing to the keeper of the forest's safe return.|$|E
5|$|On August 16, 2010, Microsoft {{announced}} Age of Empires Online, {{which was}} a free-to-play Games for Windows Live online game, it developed in collaboration with Robot Entertainment. It featured Free-to-play experiences via Games for Windows LIVE as well as: A persistent online capital city <b>that</b> <b>lives</b> and grows even when you're offline, Cooperative multiplayer quests, trading and a level-based system that lets you progress at your own pace. Premium content could be earned or purchased, such as access to blueprints and special items, {{as well as more}} quests and features. In September 2013, it was announced that the game would remain functional until July 1, 2014, after which it would be shut down due to the content being too expensive to maintain.|$|E
5|$|Sea Mither, or Mither of the Sea, is {{a mythical}} being of Orcadian {{folklore}} <b>that</b> <b>lives</b> {{in the sea}} during summer, when she confines the demonic nuckelavee to the ocean depths. Each spring she battles with her arch-enemy Teran, another spirit of Orcadian legend capable of causing severe winter storms, {{to gain control of}} the seas and the weather. Eventually Sea Mither overcomes Teran and sends him to the depths of the ocean, but the effort of keeping him confined there along with her other benevolent labours during the summer exhaust her, until in the autumn Teran takes advantage of her weakness to wrest control from her once again.|$|E
50|$|Farm cats (also called barn cats) are cats <b>that</b> <b>live</b> on {{agricultural}} {{properties in}} feral or semi-feral condition.

50|$|Animals <b>that</b> <b>live</b> on Mount Bogong {{have all}} found {{some way to}} adapt to the {{environment}} which is very harsh. Animals <b>that</b> <b>live</b> on Mount Bogong include pygmy possum, bogong moth, smoky mouse, broad toothed rat, powerful owl, spotted tree frog and she-oak skink.|$|R
5000|$|Examples {{of animals}} <b>that</b> <b>live</b> here are swordfish, squid, Anarhichadidae or [...] "wolffish" [...] and some species of cuttlefish.

5|$|The Wonder Mountain's Guardian {{version of}} the {{attraction}} features eight characters. Stansien is the riders' guide who leads them through the mountain. Crazy Crabs are characterized as attractive but dangerous. Beasty Bats are recognizable by their oversized fangs compared to those of regular bats. Sneaky Spiders {{have the ability to}} ambush riders and their bites contain venom. Archers fight with bows and arrows, and can move around quickly. Wet Ones are reptilian creatures similar to fish but they can walk on land. These reptiles are most dangerous when they are in the water. Draconians protect Draconian City and carry swords and shields. Ormaar is the dragon <b>that</b> <b>lives</b> inside the mountain and confronts riders {{at the end of the}} ride.|$|E
5|$|Vikos–Aoös National Park {{preserves}} one of {{the richest}} mountain and forest ecosystems in terms of wildlife diversity in Greece. Numerous species of large mammals such as wolves, foxes, wild horses, and roe deer are found in the area year-round. Otters and wild cats live around the area of Tymfi, with the latter being quite rare. The Pindus range, of which Vikos–Aoös is part, is home to the endangered brown bear and lynx, and is also the southernmost point of their European habitat. One of the park's special attractions is the existence of the chamois (Rupicapra rupicapra), a rare species <b>that</b> <b>lives</b> at higher altitudes far from human activity, especially at the rocky cliffs of the gorges, for example in Megas Lakos, a secondary ravine of the Vikos Gorge.|$|E
5|$|Another {{parasitic}} trematode {{example is}} seen in a terrestrial setting. Leucochloridium is a genus of flatworm (phylum Platyhelminthes) which matures in the intestine of songbirds. Their eggs pass out of the bird in the feces and are then taken in by Succinea, a terrestrial snail <b>that</b> <b>lives</b> in moist environments. The eggs develop into larvae inside this intermediate host, and then must {{find their way into}} the digestive system of a suitable bird. The problem here is that these birds do not eat snails, so the sporocyst must find some way of manipulating its future host into eating it. Unlike related species, these parasites are brightly colored and able to move in a pulsating manner. A sporocyst sac forces its way into the snail's eye stalks, and pulsates at high speed, enlarging the tentacle in the process. It also affects the host's behavior: the snail moves towards light, which it usually avoids. These combined factors make the sporocysts highly conspicuous, such that they are soon eaten by a hungry songbird. The snail then regenerates its tentacles, and Leucochloridium carries on with its life cycle.|$|E

25|$|Fish <b>that</b> <b>live</b> on or {{in close}} {{association}} with the sea floor are called demersal fish. This section discusses the coastal demersal fish <b>that</b> <b>live</b> on the continental shelf, but are living further from the coast and in deeper water than the nearshore fish discussed above.|$|R
50|$|Marine {{biology is}} the {{scientific}} study of organisms in the sea. Given that in biology many phyla, families and genera have some species <b>that</b> <b>live</b> in the sea and others <b>that</b> <b>live</b> on land, marine biology classifies species based on the environment rather than on taxonomy.|$|R
