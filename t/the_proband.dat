40|$|Background and Aims: The {{effect of}} <b>the</b> <b>proband's</b> gender on <b>the</b> {{familial}} aggregation of psychiatric disorders {{has rarely been}} investigated. Consequently, {{the goals of the}} study were to assess the effect of <b>the</b> <b>proband's</b> gender on <b>the</b> familial aggregation of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and Bipolar-I Disorder (BP-I). Methods: The present paper was based on data from a family study of 130 bipolar-I probands, 158 unipolar depressive probands and 97 normal controls as well as their adult first-degree relatives (n= 1651). Diagnoses were made according to a best-estimate procedure based on a semi-structured interview (DIGS), medical records and family history information. Analyses were performed using logistic regression models. Results: The major findings were that the relatives of female probands with MDD had an almost doubled risk of suffering from recurrent MDD as compared to the those of male probands with MDD. Moreover, the relatives of female probands suffered from anxiety disorders and committed suicidal attempts more frequently than those of male <b>probands.</b> In contrast, <b>the</b> <b>proband's</b> gender was found to have no impact on the familial transmission of bipolar disorder. However, there was a two-times increased risk for alcohol dependence in the relatives of female as compared to male bipolar probands. Conclusions: Our data provided support for the influence of <b>the</b> <b>proband's</b> gender on <b>the</b> familial aggregation of MDD, suggesting higher genetic loading in depressed females as compared to males. A similar effect of <b>the</b> <b>proband's</b> gender could not be observed for bipolar disorder...|$|R
40|$|When family {{data are}} ascertained through single {{selection}} based on truncation, a prevailing {{method of analysis}} is to condition the likelihood function on <b>the</b> <b>proband's</b> actual phenotypic value.

Methods: The retrospective and prospective study {{was based on a}} sample of 841 individuals, registered at the Hospital de Reabilitação de Anomalias Craniofaciais, Universidade de São Paulo (HRAC/USP). The minimum criteria used for inclusion were: presence of NSCLP and the existence of biological children of <b>the</b> <b>proband’s.</b> <b>The</b> sample was divided into two groups, Group I: proband’s with cleft lip with or without cleft palate (CL+/-CP) and Group II: proband’s with cleft palate (CP). Results: From the total of 841 individuals, 660 (237 M and 423 F) constituted Group I and 181 (41 M and 140 F), Group II. The frequency of familial cases in Group I was 14. 0 %, while in Group II it was 11 %. By estimation of the recurrence risk, a risk of 5. 3 % SR (statistical reliability) 95 % (4. 2 %- 6. 7 %) and of 4. 3 % SR 95 % (2. 6 %- 6. 8 %) was determined for <b>the</b> <b>proband’s</b> child in Group I and II respectively, with one affected parent, independent of <b>the</b> <b>proband’s</b> gender.

FH, familial defective apoprotein (apo) B, sitosterolemia, and cholesteryl ester storage disease were excluded by in vitro studies. We addressed the metabolic basis of this inherited disorder by studying the in vivo metabolism of LDL in 3 probands from these 2 families. 125 I-LDL turnover studies disclosed a marked reduction in the fractional catabolic rate (0. 19 +/- 0. 01 versus 0. 36 +/- 0. 03 pools per day, respectively; P< 0. 001) and {{a significant increase in the}} production rate [20. 7 +/- 4. 4 versus 14. 0 +/- 2. 4 mg. kg- 1. d- 1, respectively; P< 0. 01] of LDL apoB in <b>the</b> <b>probands</b> compared with normolipidemic controls.
