50|$|Within his own party, Dole {{was under}} {{pressure}} {{from both sides of}} the political spectrum. Social liberals such as California Governor Pete Wilson and Massachusetts Governor William Weld loudly argued to remove the Human Life Amendment plank from the convention platform. On the right, primary opponents Patrick Buchanan and Alan Keyes withheld endorsements—Buchanan staged a rally for his supporters in nearby Escondido on the eve of the San Diego convention. Indeed, past comments by Kemp labeling Dole as a tax-raiser surfaced. The long, bitter primary had also left <b>the</b> <b>Dole</b> <b>campaign</b> short of funds as a result of federal election spending limits in the months leading up to the convention.|$|E
5000|$|In late October, Dole {{released}} a controversial television ad attacking Hagan for reportedly taking donations from individuals {{involved in the}} Godless Americans PAC, a group which advocates {{for the rights of}} people who do not believe in God. The ad also included a female voice saying, [...] "There is no God." [...] <b>The</b> <b>Dole</b> <b>campaign</b> said the ad correctly shows who Hagan will associate with in order to raise campaign funds, and on November 1, Bob Dole also defended it, asserting that [...] "it never questions her faith," [...] and that [...] "the issue is why she was there. There's no question about her faith. I think it's ad's fair game." ...|$|E

When Senator Dole formed a Presidential Exploratory Committee in January 1995, she was appointed Finance Director and {{also served as}} acting campaign Manager until campaign manager Scott Reed joined the campaign staff. She continued {{in the role of}} Finance Director of <b>the</b> <b>Dole's</b> <b>campaign</b> committee (ref: United States presidential election, 1996) until she had raised the maximum allowable under federal campaign law, after which she transferred to the Republican National Committee as deputy finance chairman.

5000|$|Dole did not hire a {{full-time}} campaign manager, former Tennessee Senator Bill Brock, until late 1987, well after Bush's team {{had been in}} place. Despite raising almost {{as much money as}} the Bush campaign, <b>the</b> <b>Dole</b> <b>campaign</b> spent its money faster and was vastly outspent in the contests held after Iowa, New Hampshire, Minnesota, and South Dakota. Despite a key endorsement by Senator Strom Thurmond, one of many Republican senators who supported their leader, Dole was defeated by Bush again in South Carolina in early March. Several days later, every southern state voted for Bush in a [...] "Super Tuesday" [...] sweep. Another big loss in Illinois persuaded Dole to withdraw from the race.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Dole</b> <b>campaign</b> {{sought to}} use the {{convention}} to unite the party, to appeal to political moderates, and to highlight Dole's honorable service in World War II and in the U.S. Senate. Nearly all floor speeches were delivered by moderate or liberal Republicans, including the keynote address by New York Congresswoman Susan Molinari, and Dole was nominated by fellow veteran and Arizona Senator John McCain. Gingrich, who {{less than two years}} ago had been a star of the party, was denied a prime time slot altogether, as was Buchanan, who had finished in second place for the nomination, with over 200 delegates. However, supporters in the socially conservative grassroots organizations such as the Christian Coalition directed the convention to adopt a conservative platform with little controversy, and Buchanan released his delegates at the last minute.|$|E
5000|$|The ad has met {{exceptionally}} strong {{criticism from}} the public {{as well as many}} local and several national media outlets. CNN's Campbell Brown said about the ad: [...] "Amid all the attack ads on the airwaves competing to out-ugly one another, we think we've found a winner." [...] The ad has been described as [...] "ridiculously outrageous," [...] "indecent," [...] a [...] "gross misrepresentation," [...] "worse than dishonest" [...] and [...] "beyond the bounds of acceptable political disagreement," [...] among other harsh criticism. Another ad issued by <b>the</b> <b>Dole</b> <b>campaign</b> in mid-October 2008 was described by The Fayetteville Observer as [...] "setting the low mark in negative political campaigning." [...] The media reported, that within 48 hours of the first ad Hagan received over 3,600 contributions, including major donors as well as individual support from a range of atheists, agnostics and followers of other religious beliefs who felt they were being attacked by Dole. Following the second ad Hagan's lead doubled according to some polls.|$|E

Following Hagan's victory, the lawsuit was dropped. The ad was roundly criticized in local and several national media outlets, including by CNN's Campbell Brown, who said about the ad: [...] "Amid all the attack ads on the airwaves competing to out-ugly one another, we think we've found a winner." ...|$|E
2500|$|Kirkpatrick briefly {{considered}} {{running for}} President in 1988 against George H. W. Bush, because she {{believed he was}} not tough enough on Communism. Kirkpatrick endorsed Senator Robert Dole of Kansas, who was the runner up to Bush. Despite a strong showing in <b>the</b> Iowa caucuses, <b>Dole's</b> <b>campaign</b> quickly faded after he lost the New Hampshire primary in February 1988. Kirkpatrick was an active surrogate campaigner for Dole even as he was losing, as was her old foe, Alexander Haig, who endorsed Dole after ending his own 1988 campaign several days before the New Hampshire primary.|$|R

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Dole</b> Gudbrandsdal, Dølahest or Dole is a draft- and harness-type horse from Norway. <b>The</b> <b>Dole</b> Trotter is {{alternately}} {{considered a}} subtype of <b>the</b> <b>Dole</b> Gudbrandsdal {{and a separate}} breed; it is also considered {{a part of the}} Coldblood trotter type. <b>The</b> <b>Dole</b> Gudbrandsdal is a small draft horse, known for its pulling power and agility, while <b>the</b> <b>Dole</b> Trotter is a smaller, faster horse used for harness racing; the two types are commonly interbred. Both types are strictly critiqued before entry into the studbook, which has over time resulted in an improvement in the breed type. <b>The</b> <b>Dole</b> is originally from the Gudbrandsdal Valley, and is probably descended in part from the Friesian horse. Over time the breed has had Thoroughbred, Arabian and other blood added in, especially during the creation of <b>the</b> <b>Dole</b> Trotter in <b>the</b> 19th century. The first studbook was created in 1941, and the current breed association formed in 1947.

40|$|Under Federal Government budget {{proposals}} {{there will}} be a mass mobilisation of Australia’s jobseekers into Work for <b>the</b> <b>Dole</b> schemes. This is being called an ‘expanded Work for the Dole’. How is this Work for <b>the</b> <b>Dole</b> different from previous versions of Work for <b>the</b> <b>Dole?</b> For <b>the</b> first time Work for <b>the</b> <b>Dole</b> includes older jobseekers (up to the age of 50). Previous versions of Work for <b>the</b> <b>Dole</b> had young people working on community projects. Community projects can still happen but this expanded Work for <b>the</b> <b>Dole</b> will have a greater emphasis on putting people in individual work placements. The Government has said that the individual placements have to be with local councils, not-for profit organisations (including schools) and federal and state government agencies. TasCOSS estimates that approximately 8441 Work for <b>the</b> <b>Dole</b> placements will need to be found for Tasmanians aged 18 to 2911 and approximately 8635 for Tasmanians aged 30 to 49 {{in the next four years}} 12.

40|$|Work for <b>the</b> <b>Dole</b> has {{a unique}} {{importance}} as the default option in Australia’s mutual obligation system. The only substantial independent review of the Work for <b>the</b> <b>Dole</b> program covered a period ending in June 2003. Since then there have been substantial changes to the program and three relevant major studies have been completed. This paper makes a further overall evaluation of Work for <b>the</b> <b>Dole.</b> It confirms that employment outcomes are positive and surprisingly high by international standards. However, {{the changes in the}} program have not brought the increase in effectiveness in Work for <b>the</b> <b>Dole</b> that one would expect. To a large extent this is because Job Network members are slow to see Work for <b>the</b> <b>Dole</b> as a valuable option for particular clients, rather than routinely referring people to Work for <b>the</b> <b>Dole</b> when they reach the mutual obligation legal requirement. ...|$|R

5|$|In 1872, <b>the</b> <b>Dole</b> Gudbrandsdal {{was split}} into two types - a class for heavier {{agriculture}} and driving horses and a class for lighter racing and riding horses. In 1875, the Norwegian Trotting Association was formed by enthusiasts of the second type. In 1902, <b>the</b> first <b>Dole</b> Gudbrandsdal stud book was published, containing stallions from both types born between 1846 and 1892. In 1903, the Norwegian Trotting Association split their registration between purebred Norwegian trotters and trotting crosses. At the same time, standards for entry were tightened and the first inspection committee was created. In 1965, <b>the</b> Norwegian or <b>Dole</b> Trotter studbook {{was taken over by}} the Norwegian Trotting Association, as part of the new Coldblood trotter program approved by the Norwegian Ministry for Agriculture. <b>The</b> <b>Dole</b> Trotter studbook is still coordinated with <b>the</b> original <b>Dole</b> Gudbrandsdal registry, and horses have to meet many of the same standards. <b>The</b> <b>Dole</b> Trotter is alternately considered a subtype of <b>the</b> <b>Dole</b> Gudbrandsdal and a separate breed.|$|R
500|$|In the 19th century, harness racing {{began to}} rise in {{popularity}} in Norway and breeders looked to create a horse suitable for that sport. <b>The</b> <b>Dole</b> Trotter, a smaller, lighter, faster variation of <b>the</b> draft-type <b>Dole</b> Gudbrandsdal, was then developed. Infusions of Thoroughbred blood, {{as well as that}} of various trotting and heavy draft breeds, was used to create this new type. [...] <b>The</b> <b>Dole</b> Trotter was especially influenced between 1840 and 1860 by two other stallions, Toftebrun and Dovre (an Arabian); the latter is the foundation stallion of <b>the</b> <b>Dole</b> Trotter type. <b>The</b> two types are commonly interbred, especially since 1960.|$|R

500|$|When {{originally}} developed, Dole Gudbrandsdals {{were used}} as pack horses on overland trade routes across Norway, the main one of which connected Oslo with the North Sea and ran through the Gudbrandsdal Valley. <b>The</b> <b>Dole</b> Gudbrandsdal is used mainly for heavy draft and agricultural work, as well as timber hauling, while <b>the</b> lighter <b>Dole</b> Trotter is used mainly for harness racing. <b>The</b> <b>Dole</b> Gudbrandsdal was an influential breed {{in the formation of}} the North Swedish Horse, and the two breeds are very similar in conformation. When <b>the</b> <b>Dole</b> [...] and North Swedish breeds are crossed, they produce a lighter-weight horse with more forward gaits that is often used for harness racing. <b>The</b> <b>Dole</b> Gudbrandsdal has also been crossed with Swedish Warmbloods to produce riding-type horses, and it has been theorized that Dole/Thoroughbred crosses may produce nice hunter horses.|$|R
