For two reasons the ‘psychohistorical’ model emphasising the subjective and irrational aspects of terrorism has only limited value for the Transcaucasian case. First, {{the significance of the}} contextual factor is powerfully underscored by the phenomenon of workers' ‘economic terrorism’. It was not uncommon even, for workers to blackmail reluctant party organisations into supporting the killing of their enemies. Secondly, the social democrats were not driven by irrational urges but followed a rationally motivated and selective terrorist strategy.

Soon after, as construction work started at a massive scale all over the city for the Commonwealth Games (CWG) to be held in October this year, a need to highlight the plight of the construction workers was strongly felt. Construction workers are at a more disadvantageous position than even casual labour working in industrial units or engaged as security or sanitation staff, because of the time bound nature of their work. Secondly, the shifting nature of their work makes it impossible for them <b>to</b> <b>organise</b> themselves and <b>struggle</b> for their rights. Thirdly, workers recruited through the thekedars, sardars or jamdars (either introduced to them through social networks or not known to them) are in no state to bargain with them because of the workers’ total dependence and insecure economic condition. ...|$|R
