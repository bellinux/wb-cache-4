25|$|The Second Polish Republic {{regarded}} the Klaipėda Region as possible compensation for Danzig. After World War I, the Polish Corridor provided {{access to the}} Baltic Sea, but the Free City of Danzig was not granted to Poland. In early 1919, Roman Dmowski, the Polish representative to the Paris Peace Conference, campaigned for the incorporation of Klaipėda Region into Lithuania, which was then {{to enter into a}} union with Poland (see Dmowski's Line and Międzymorze federation). The Polish formula was Klaipėda to Lithuania, Lithuania to Poland. Until the Polish–Lithuanian union could be worked out, Klaipėda was to be placed under the <b>temporary</b> <b>administration</b> of the Allies. While such a union had a historic tradition in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, Lithuania categorically refused any such proposals. Worsening Polish–Lithuanian relations led to the Polish–Lithuanian War and dispute over the Vilnius Region. However, the union idea was met favorably in Western Europe. In December 1921, Poland sent Marceli Szarota as a new envoy to the region. Due to his initiative, Poland and Klaipėda signed a trade agreement in April 1922. In addition, Poland attempted to establish its economic presence by buying property, establishing business enterprises, and making connections with the port.|$|E

Two days later, Forster joined others in {{establishing}} a Jacobin Club called [...] "Freunde der Freiheit und Gleichheit" [...] ("Friends of Freedom and Equality") in the Electoral Palace. From early 1793 he was actively involved in organizing the Mainz Republic.

500|$|In {{the tenth}} century, the Principality of Hungary had begun conquering Transylvania, which Hungarians had fully {{occupied}} by around 1200. The {{idea of a}} [...] "Greater Romania" [...] had existed {{in the minds of}} Romanians in Transylvania for some time and Brătianu had actively supported the concept before the war. In 1918, both Bessarabia and Bukovina voted for union with Romania. An assembly took place in the ancient city of Alba Iulia on 1 December 1918, where Vasile Goldiș read the resolution for the union of Transylvania with the Old Kingdom. This document, supported by Romanian as well as Saxon deputies, established a High National Romanian Council (...) for the province's <b>temporary</b> <b>administration.</b> Marie wrote, [...] "the dream of România Mare seems to be becoming a reality... it is all so incredible that I hardly dare believe it." [...] After the assembly, Ferdinand and Marie returned to Bucharest, where they were met by general mirth: [...] "a day of 'wild, delirious enthusiasm', with the bands crashing and the troops marching and the people cheering". Allied troops took part in the celebration and Marie was elated to see the Entente on Romanian soil for the first time.|$|E

2500|$|In 1971, the People's Republic of China won the United Nations seat as [...] "China" [...] {{and use of}} {{the name}} and {{expelled}} the ROC from the UN. Since then the term [...] "Taiwan, China" [...] is a designation typically used in international organizations like the United Nations and its associated organs under pressure from the PRC to accommodate its claim and to give the false impression that Taiwan belongs to the PRC. (The term [...] "Chinese Taipei" [...] was similarly created for the same purpose.) However, the political status of Taiwan is a complex and controversial issue and currently unresolved, in large part due to the United States and the Allies of World War II handling of the surrender of Taiwan from Japan in 1945 (which was to be a <b>temporary</b> <b>administration</b> by the ROC troops), and the Treaty of Peace with Japan ("Treaty of San Francisco") in 1951, for which neither the ROC nor the PRC was invited, and left Taiwan's sovereignty legally undefined in international law and in dispute.|$|E
