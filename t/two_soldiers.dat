5|$|French {{physician}} Jean-Baptiste Octave Landry {{first described}} the disorder in 1859. In 1916, Georges Guillain, Jean Alexandre Barré, and André Strohl diagnosed <b>two</b> <b>soldiers</b> with the illness {{and described the}} key diagnostic abnormality—albuminocytological dissociation—of increased spinal fluid protein concentration but a normal cell count.|$|E
5|$|In addition, <b>two</b> <b>soldiers</b> {{from this}} {{division}} were awarded the Medal of Honor for their service in combat. They are Willy F.

5|$|On 7 March 2009 the RIRA claimed {{responsibility}} for the 2009 Massereene Barracks shooting. This shooting occurred outside the Massereene Barracks as four soldiers were receiving a pizza delivery. <b>Two</b> <b>soldiers</b> were killed, and the other <b>two</b> <b>soldiers</b> and two deliverymen were injured. On 3 April 2009 the RIRA in Derry {{claimed responsibility}} for carrying out a punishment shooting {{of a man who was}} awaiting sentencing for raping a 15-year-old girl. The RIRA were also blamed for orchestrating rioting in the Ardoyne area of Belfast on 13 July 2009 as an Apprentice Boys parade was passing. Several PSNI officers were injured in the rioting and at least one shot was fired at police. In early November, the Independent Monitoring Commission released a report stating that the threat from the RIRA and other dissident republicans was at its most serious level since the 1998 Good Friday Agreement.|$|E
5|$|The Victoria Cross (VC) {{was instituted}} in 1856 as the British Empire's highest {{decoration}} for valour. From that date until the 52nd merged with 43rd in 1881, <b>two</b> <b>soldiers</b> from the 52nd were awarded the Victoria Cross, both at Delhi in 1857: Bugler Robert Hawthorne and Lance Corporal Henry Smith.|$|E
5|$|To {{reinforce}} the 102nd Infantry Bridade {{and the independent}} armoured-mechanised unit, ten soldiers from the Glina Battalion were attached to each battalion of the 10th and 102nd brigades; <b>two</b> <b>soldiers</b> were assigned to serve as guides for each tank. In addition, the Glina Battalion was tasked with reconnaissance, harassment of JNA's rear and securing captured infrastructure.|$|E

5|$|Detainees {{who were}} not {{suspected}} of involvement with the Croatian armed forces were evacuated from Vukovar to other locations in Serbia and Croatia. The non-Serb population of Vukovar and the surrounding region was systematically ethnically cleansed and at least 20,000 of Vukovar's inhabitants were forced to leave the town, adding to {{the tens of thousands}} already expelled from across eastern Slavonia. 2,600 people disappeared {{after the fall of the}} town, of whom around 550 are still missing. There were also incidents of war rape, for which <b>two</b> <b>soldiers</b> were later convicted.|$|E
5|$|The fort was {{initially}} commanded by Captain James Crane, with a garrison of ten men, including his second in command, a porter, six gunners and <b>two</b> <b>soldiers.</b> As time went on, {{not all of}} the gunners worked full-time at the fort, some living and working in the town itself. It is uncertain how many artillery pieces the blockhouse {{was initially}} equipped with, although it is known that the five blockhouses along the Thames had 108 brass and iron guns in total between them in 1540.|$|E
5|$|Three Taliban {{fighters were}} in the courtyard, which had a chicken coop within it. The Taliban fired on Petry and Robinson; Petry was wounded by one round that went through both his legs, and Robinson was wounded, being hit on the armor plate {{protecting}} his side. Petry led Robinson to {{the cover of the}} chicken coop, and reported the contact and their wounded condition. Petry threw a thermobaric grenade from cover. At the chicken coop, the two men were joined by Sergeant Daniel Higgins, who assessed the wounds of the <b>two</b> <b>soldiers.</b>|$|E

5|$|Between 29December 1946 and 3January the division's brigades {{carried out}} seven search {{operations}} in Tel Aviv, arresting 191 people. On 2January several attacks {{were made on}} roads in the division's area. One attack wounded eight men of the 4th and 5th Parachute Battalions. Another attack {{on the same day}} was carried out by the Lehi against the 1st Parachute Battalion headquarters in Tel Aviv, killing a Jewish policeman and wounding <b>two</b> <b>soldiers</b> and another police officer. Then on 18January the 6th Airborne and 1st Infantry Division swapped locations, the airborne division now assuming responsibility for the north of the country. Although it remained part of the division, the 2nd Parachute Brigade was withdrawn to England on 24January.|$|E
5|$|Captain San Pedro {{detected}} {{the movements of}} the American troops from his positions on a nearby hill and ordered his men to open fire. Garretson then ordered a direct attack on the Spanish and Puerto Rican forces in the hacienda. At day break, the 6th Massachusetts overran the Spanish forces and suffered four casualties. Puig was expecting reinforcements from Yauco which did not arrive and was ordered to disengage and retreat. Before retreating {{the right wing of the}} Spanish force, which was not overrun, initiated a flanking attack against two positions held by the Illinois and Massachusetts companies. The unexpected strength of the Spanish force caused some of the 6th Massachusetts troops to momentarily panic, but the Spanish forces were eventually driven off. Puig and his forces suffered two officers and three soldiers wounded and <b>two</b> <b>soldiers</b> dead.|$|E
5|$|Cumulative {{friendly}} casualties for Operation Scotland, {{which began}} on 1 November 1967, were: 205 killed in action, 1,668 wounded, and 25 missing and presumed dead. These figures {{do not include}} casualties among Special Forces troops at Lang Vei, aircrews killed or missing in the area or Marine replacements killed or wounded while entering or exiting the base aboard aircraft. As far as North Vietnamese casualties were concerned, 1,602 bodies were counted, seven prisoners were taken, and <b>two</b> <b>soldiers</b> defected to allied forces during the operation. American intelligence estimated that between 10,000 and 15,000 NVA troops were killed during the operation, equating to up to 90% of the attacking 17,200 men NVA force. The NVA acknowledged 2,500 men killed in action. They also reported 1,436 wounded before mid-March, of which 484 men returned to their units while 396 were sent up the Ho Chi Minh trail to hospitals in the north.|$|E

5|$|Due to 10th Mountain Division efforts, {{humanitarian}} agencies {{declared an}} end to the food emergency and factional fighting decreased. When Task Force Ranger and the SAR team were pinned down during a raid in what later became known as the Battle of Mogadishu, the 10th Mountain Division provided infantry for the UN quick reaction force sent to rescue them. The 10th Mountain Division had <b>two</b> <b>soldiers</b> killed in the fighting, which was the longest sustained firefight by regular US Army forces since the Vietnam War. The division began a gradual reduction of forces in Somalia in February 1994, until the last soldiers of the 2nd Battalion, 22nd Infantry returned to the United States in March 1994.|$|E
5|$|During the battle, Coalition forces {{incurred}} 43 fatalities and 52 injured casualties. This included 25 Americans killed, 11 {{of them by}} {{friendly fire}} along with 14 airmen killed when their AC-130 was shot down by Iraqi SAMs. The Americans also had <b>two</b> <b>soldiers</b> wounded and another <b>two</b> <b>soldiers</b> were captured in Khafji. Saudi and Kuwaiti casualties totaled 18 killed and 50 wounded. Two Kuwaiti AMX-30s main battle tanks and between seven and ten lightly armored Saudi V-150s were knocked out. Most of the V150s were knocked out by RPG-7 fire in close-range fighting inside the town of Khafji, although {{one of the two}} that was a catastrophic kill was hit by a 100mm main gun round from a T-55. Iraq listed its casualties as 71 dead, 148 wounded and 702 missing. U.S. sources present at the battle claim that 300 Iraqis lost their lives, and at least 90 vehicles were destroyed. Another source suggests that 60 Iraqi soldiers were killed and at least 400 taken prisoner, while no less than 80 armored vehicles were knocked out; however these casualties are attributed to the fighting both inside and directly north of Khafji. Whatever the exact casualties, the majority of three Iraqi mechanized/armored divisions had been destroyed. The U.S. Army's 2nd Armored Division's 1st Tiger Brigade claims 181 destroyed or captured enemy tanks, 148 APCs, 40 artillery pieces, 27 AA emplacements, 263 Iraqi dead and 4,051 captured after 100 hours of combat.|$|E
5|$|Egyptian forces {{attempted}} a surprise {{attack on the}} crusaders' camp on 9 October, but John discovered their movements. He and his retinue attacked and annihilated the Egyptian advance guard, hindering the main force. The crusaders built a floating fortress on the Nile near Damietta, but a storm blew it near the Egyptian camp. The Egyptians seized the fortress, killing nearly all of its defenders. Only <b>two</b> <b>soldiers</b> survived the attack; they were accused of cowardice, and John ordered their execution. Taking advantage of the new Italian troops, Cardinal Pelagius began to intervene in strategic decisions. His debates with John angered their troops. The soldiers broke into the Egyptian camp on 29 August 1219 without an order, but they were soon defeated and nearly annihilated. During the ensuing panic, only the cooperation of John, the Templars, the Hospitallers and the noble crusaders prevented the Egyptians from destroying their camp.|$|E

5|$|HMAS Waller, {{the third}} of the RAN's Collins-class {{submarines}} to enter service, was commissioned on 10July 1999. The attendees included John Waller, Michael Waller's wife, and surviving crewmen of HMAS Perth. On 13March 2010, a memorial to Waller was unveiled in his home town of Benalla. In April 2011, {{he was one of}} thirteen servicemen—eleven sailors and <b>two</b> <b>soldiers,</b> including Teddy Sheean, Robert Rankin, and John Simpson Kirkpatrick—named by the Australian government for consideration as possible recipients of the Victoria Cross for extreme valour in combat, under a review by the Defence Honours and Awards Appeals Tribunal; no RAN member had ever been awarded the decoration. Concluding its investigations in February 2013, the tribunal recommended that no further award be made to any of the thirteen servicemen, but that the name Waller (among others) should continue to be used for RAN ships after the current bearer was decommissioned.|$|E
5|$|Hollander {{tries to}} get to Cloud, but is killed by Zack. Zack then finds Director Lazard who, now mutated into an Angeal clone, has turned against Shinra. Lazard directs Zack to the remains of Banora to find Genesis. Zack defeats Genesis, but upon {{returning}} he discovers that Shinra have located them, and killed Lazard. The Angeal clone that was left guarding Aerith also arrives, but he too is killed. Zack discovers a note he had carried from Aerith, and learns he and Cloud had been subjected to Hojo's experiments for four years. Zack and Cloud are able to escape, heading towards Midgar, whilst Genesis' body is collected by <b>two</b> <b>soldiers.</b>|$|E
5|$|Low-level {{operations}} continued, however, {{with a small}} Australian {{force of}} 80 soldiers remaining in Iraq to protect the Australian Embassy in Baghdad as part of SECDET under Operation Kruger. SECDET was finally withdrawn in August 2011, {{and was replaced by}} a private military company which took over responsibility for providing security for Australia's diplomatic presence in Iraq. Although more than 17,000 personnel served during operations in Iraq, Australian casualties were relatively light, with <b>two</b> <b>soldiers</b> accidentally killed, while a third Australian died serving with the British Royal Air Force. A further 27 personnel were wounded. Two officers remained in Iraq attached to the United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq as part of Operation Riverbank. This operation concluded in November 2013.|$|E
