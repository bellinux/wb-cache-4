5|$|Motions of a bike can {{be roughly}} grouped into <b>those</b> <b>out</b> {{of the central}} plane of symmetry: lateral; {{and those in the}} central plane of symmetry: {{longitudinal}} or vertical. Lateral motions include balancing, leaning, steering, and turning. Motions in the central plane of symmetry include rolling forward, of course, but also stoppies, wheelies, brake diving, and most suspension activation. Motions in these two groups are linearly decoupled, that is they do not interact with each other to the first order. An uncontrolled bike is laterally unstable when stationary and can be laterally self-stable when moving under the right conditions or when controlled by a rider. Conversely, a bike is longitudinally stable when stationary and can be longitudinally unstable when undergoing sufficient acceleration or deceleration.|$|E
5|$|There is a Practice mode {{which allows}} the player to {{practice}} any track with opponents. Time Attack lets the player choose a track and complete a 3-lap race in the shortest time possible. Transparent re-enactments of Time Attack performances, or ghost data, from the player or game developer can be raced against. Up to 3 player-contributed ghosts can be raced against simultaneously, but only one can be saved per track. Death Race has the player annihilating the 29 other racers as speedily as possible on a specialized course. There is no selectable difficulty level, or set amount of laps, but the boost is immediately available. Vs. Battle is the multiplayer mode where 2 to 4 players compete in a 3-lap race, and slots not in use by players can be operated by the artificial intelligence. A slot machine for <b>those</b> <b>out</b> of the race early will appear if the option is enabled. Players can adversely affect the energy levels of those still competing by matching symbols.|$|E

25|$|Morgan {{was forced}} by post-lingual {{deafness}} {{as an early}} teen to communicate by letters throughout his professional life. This effort created a written network for scholars interested in Western American themes. Vast stores of correspondence indicate his willingness to help another writer or scholar, to provide information on sources and materials, or offer advice on projects. Many emerging scholars, particularly <b>those</b> <b>out</b> of the academic mainstream, considered him a mentor. As a result, Morgan {{stood in the center}} of a scholarly group of literary figures of the 1930s through 1960s involved in history and biography of the American West. These individuals included Juanita Brooks, Fawn Brodie, Bernard DeVoto, Charles Kelly, J. Roderic Korns, A. Russell Mortensen, William Mulder, and Harold Schindler.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally, {{those within}} the same {{category}} (for example the four midfielders in a 4–4–2) would generally play as a fairly flat line across the pitch, with <b>those</b> <b>out</b> wide often playing in a slightly more advanced position. In many modern formations, {{this is not the}} case, which has led to some analysts splitting the categories in two separate bands, leading to four- or even five-numbered formations. A common example is 4–2–1–3, where the midfielders are split into two defensive and one offensive player; as such, this formation can be considered a type of 4–3–3. An example of a five-numbered formation would be 4-1-2-1-2, where the midfield consists of a defensive midfielder, two central midfielders and an offensive midfielder; this is sometimes considered {{to be a kind of}} 4-4-2.|$|E
25|$|The {{promulgation}} of law for {{the protection}} of a position held purely on religious grounds cannot therefore be justified. It is irrational, as preferring the subjective over the objective. But it is also divisive, capricious and arbitrary. We do not live in a society where all the people share uniform religious beliefs. The precepts of any one religion – any belief system – cannot, by force of their religious origins, sound any louder in the general law than the precepts of any other. If they did, <b>those</b> <b>out</b> in the cold would be less than citizens; and our constitution would be {{on the way to a}} theocracy, which is of necessity autocratic.

25|$|Historically, {{because of}} its reputation, the demand for places in the school has outstripped capacity, and entry was selective. The school was zoned {{at least since the}} 1960s. Since 2000, school zoning is {{determined}} by a state school enrolment scheme, which gives first preference to students living in a designated home zone, and then to brothers of current students who live outside the zone. The school argues that zoning increases house prices in the zone, reducing access to the school for students from lower socio-economic groups. Research by the Real Estate Institute of New Zealand shows there is a 30 percent premium ($257,000) on houses in-zone compared to <b>those</b> <b>out</b> of zone. In 2014, nearby One Tree Hill College and Selwyn College introduced enrolment schemes which initially planned to overlap parts of the Auckland Grammar zone. Both were forced to backtrack after opposition from parents in the overlapping areas, who feared it could ultimately lead to Auckland Grammar shrinking its zone and affecting the resale value of their homes.|$|E
25|$|Aufmarsch I West {{was one of}} four {{deployment}} plans {{available to}} the German General Staff in 1914. Each plan favoured certain operations, but did not specify exactly how those operations were to be carried out, leaving the commanding officers to carry <b>those</b> <b>out</b> at their own initiative and with minimal oversight. Aufmarsch I West, designed for a one-front war with France, had been retired once it became clear it was irrelevant to the wars Germany could expect to face; both Russia and Britain were expected to help France, and there was no possibility of Italian nor Austro-Hungarian troops being available for operations against France. But despite its unsuitability, and the availability of more sensible and decisive options, it retained a certain allure due to its offensive nature and the pessimism of pre-war thinking, which expected offensive operations to be short-lived, costly in casualties, and unlikely to be decisive. Accordingly, the Aufmarsch II West deployment was changed for the offensive of 1914, despite its unrealistic goals and the insufficient forces Germany had available for decisive success. Moltke took Schlieffen's plan and modified the deployment of forces on the western front by reducing the right wing, the one to advance through Belgium, from 85% to 70%. In the end, the Schlieffen plan was so radically modified by Moltke, that it could be more properly called the Moltke Plan.|$|E
25|$|Müller’s SPD {{government}} eventually fell as {{a result}} of the catastrophic effects of the Great Depression. Müller’s government, an ideologically diverse “Grand Coalition” representing five parties ranging from the left to the right, was unable to develop effective counter-measures to tackle the catastrophic effects of the economic crisis, as characterised by the massive rise in the numbers of registered unemployed. In 1928–29, 2.5million were estimated to be unemployed, a figure that reached over 3million by the following winter. A major problem facing Müller’s government was a deficit in the Reich budget, which the government spending more than it was receiving. This situation was made worse by the inadequacy of the unemployment scheme which was unable to pay out enough benefits to the rising numbers of unemployed, forcing the government to make contributions to the scheme (which in turn worsened the budget deficit). The coalition was badly divided on this issue, with the SPD wishing to raise the level of contributions to the scheme while safeguarding both those in work and <b>those</b> <b>out</b> of work as much as possible. The right-wing parties, by contrast, wished to reduce unemployment benefits while lightening the tax burden. Unable to garner enough support in the Reichstag to pass laws, Müller turned to Hindenburg for support, wishing him to grant him the use of the emergency powers under Article 48 of the Weimar Constitution so that he did not have to rely on support from the Reichstag.|$|E

500|$|For The Last of Us, {{the team}} had to create new engines to satisfy their needs. The {{artificial}} intelligence (AI) was created to coordinate with players on an intimate level, {{as opposed to the}} action elements from their previous projects; the addition of Ellie as AI was also a major contributor to the engine. The team intentionally added a feature in which Ellie remains close to Joel, in order to avoid being conceived as a [...] "burden". Programmer Max Dyckhoff stated that, when working on Ellie as AI, he tried to imagine her experiences throughout the game's events, in an attempt to achieve realism. The enemy AI, {{considered one of the most}} important features of the game, was developed to make random choices; they study their surroundings, finding tactics to attack the player. This uniqueness to gameplay was a factor into the attempt at making players feel emotions towards the enemies. The lighting engine was also re-created to incorporate soft light, in which the sunlight seeps in through spaces and reflects off surfaces. The team found great difficulty in developing the gameplay for The Last of Us, as they felt that every mechanic required thorough analysis. [...] "You feel a lot of pressure to add things to make it 'more fun' and it gets super difficult to keep <b>those</b> <b>out</b> sometimes," [...] Druckmann said. In The Last of Us, the weapon that players have equipped change the behavior of the human NPCs. In addition, the stealth system was intentionally developed to offer a sense of desperation, to make players feel the same.|$|E
500|$|The Way I See It was an {{exemplary}} {{release of the}} classic soul revival during its peak in 2008. The music scene was marked by similarly retro-minded work from mainstream artists such as Amy Winehouse and Adele, independent acts such as Sharon Jones & The Dap-Kings and Mayer Hawthorne, and older artists attempting comebacks such as Al Green and Bettye LaVette. Oliver Wang cited Saadiq's album, along with Solange Knowles' 2008 record Sol-Angel and the Hadley St. Dreams, {{as one of the}} [...] "retro-soul" [...] efforts that were released by contemporary R artists as the music scene peaked in popularity.

[...] Estelle said in 2008, [...] "Every song is like a different era of Motown ... Everything sounds exactly like it did back in the day. Not to take away from Amy, but this is the real shit." [...] It was described by David Nathan as the [...] "contemporary album that was the closest to authentically recreating the great soul music sound of the late '60s and early '70s." [...] Ken Tucker found it distinct from other soul revival music: [...] "You can reproduce variations on melodies and rhythm, but without an emotional commitment, it's all tedious pandering to baby boomers.

2500|$|The NLRB applies a {{similarly}} strict standard in reviewing unions' enforcement of exclusive hiring halls, i.e., {{those in which}} the employer is bound, by contract, to hire only employees referred to it by the union. The NLRB requires unions to establish clear procedures and to follow those procedures {{in order to minimize}} the likelihood that the union would use a hiring hall procedure to exclude non-members or <b>those</b> <b>out</b> of favour with the union from the workplace. On the other hand, the NLRB applies the more deferential standard applied to union decisions generally in the case of non-exclusive hiring halls, i.e., those in which the union has the power to refer applicants for employment but the employer may also hire employees [...] "off the street"; in those cases the union is barred from acting arbitrarily, in bad faith or discriminatorily.|$|E

2500|$|The Battle of Isandlwana (alternative spelling: Isandhlwana) on 22 January 1879 was {{the first}} major {{encounter}} in the Anglo–Zulu War between the British Empire and the Zulu Kingdom. Eleven days after the British commenced their invasion of Zululand in South Africa, a Zulu force of some 20,000 warriors attacked a portion of the British main column consisting of about 1,800 British, colonial and native troops and perhaps 400 civilians. The Zulus were equipped mainly with the traditional assegai iron spears and cow-hide shields, but also had a number of muskets and old rifles though they were not formally trained in their use. [...] The British and colonial troops were armed with the modern Martini-Henry breech-loading rifle and two 7-pounder (3-inch, 76 mm) mountain guns deployed as field guns, as well as a Hale rocket battery. Despite a vast disadvantage in weapons technology, the numerically superior Zulus ultimately overwhelmed the poorly led and badly deployed British, killing over 1,300 troops, including all <b>those</b> <b>out</b> on the forward firing line. The Zulu army suffered around a thousand killed.|$|E
2500|$|Huddersfield was a {{centre of}} civil unrest during the Industrial Revolution. In {{a period where}} Europe was {{experiencing}} frequent wars, where trade had slumped and the crops had failed, many local weavers faced losing their livelihood due {{to the introduction of}} machinery in factories. Luddites began destroying mills and machinery in response; {{one of the most notorious}} attacks was on Cartwright – a Huddersfield mill-owner, who had a reputation for cruelty – and his Rawfolds Mill. In his book Rebels Against the Future, Kirkpatrick Sale describes how an army platoon was stationed at Huddersfield to deal with Luddites; at its peak, there were about a thousand soldiers in Huddersfield and ten thousand civilians. In response, Luddites began to focus attacks on nearby towns and villages, which were less well-protected; the largest act of damage that they committed was the destruction of Foster's Mill at Horbury – a village about [...] east of Huddersfield. The government campaign that crushed the movement was provoked by a murder that took place in Huddersfield. William Horsfall, a mill-owner and a passionate prosecutor of Luddites, was killed in 1812. Although the movement faded out, Parliament began to increase welfare provision for <b>those</b> <b>out</b> of work, and introduce regulations to improve conditions in the mills.|$|E
2500|$|Cato Uticensis (95–46). His mother's {{brother was}} the {{reformer}} Livius Drusus. His father's grandfather was the famous censor, Cato the Elder (234–149). Here, Cato (also called 'the Younger') {{was a rare}} man among the aristocracy, [...] "a man of the best intentions and of rare devotedness", yet Quixotic and cheerless. Although honourable, steadfast, earnest, and strongly attached [...] "to country and to its hereditary constitution" [...] he possessed little practical understanding. Cato, [...] "dull in intellect and sensuously as well as morally destitute of passion", might have made [...] "a tolerable state accountant." [...] Walking [...] "in the sinful capital as a model citizen and mirror of virtue" [...] he would 'scold' <b>those</b> <b>out</b> of line. His ancestor Cato the Elder worked as a farmer, his anger had made him an orator; wielder of plough and sword, in politics [...] "his narrow, but original and sound common sense ordinarily {{hit the nail on}} the head." [...] The younger Cato, however, inspired by the example of his great-grandfather, made a [...] "strange caricature" [...] of him. Formal and philosophical, a follower of the Stoa, the younger Cato would speak in [...] "scholastic wisdom" [...] and appeared as [...] "this cloud-walker in the realm of abstract morals." [...] Yet like his ancestor, he began [...] "to travel on foot instead of riding, to take no interest, to decline badges of distinction as a soldier", and like the legendary king Romulus to appear shirtless. In [...] "an utterly wretched and cowardly age his courage and his negative virtues told powerfully with the multitude." [...] As [...] "the only conservative of note who possessed if not talent and insight, at any rate integrity and courage... he soon became the champion of the Optimate party." [...] He never missed a senate meeting, and [...] "as long as he lived he checked the details of the public budget." [...] Yet unfortunately in politics he simply lacked common sense. Cato's tactics seemed to consist of nothing more than [...] "setting his face against every one who deviated" [...] from the traditional catechism of the aristocracy, which of course worked as much against the Optimates as for them. By his character and his actions this [...] "Don Quixote of the aristocracy" [...] proved the exhaustion of senate politics.|$|E
