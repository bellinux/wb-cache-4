5|$|General Dynamics and BAE Systems, who {{received}} contracts in the Ground Combat Vehicle program, criticized <b>the</b> <b>CBO</b> report, saying {{they used the}} wrong vehicle in its analysis. Officials from both companies said they used the wrong notional model of the GCV that did {{not account for the}} change in requirements made by the Army or the advancements made in the technology development phase of the program. They also criticized the comparisons of the other vehicles. The report factored cost, survivability, mobility, and lethality, ranking the GCV's capabilities as lower than all others. The Army questioned the suitability of existing design. An Army test of currently fielded vehicles in 2012 revealed that some met critical GCV requirements, but none met enough without needing significant redesign. They also note that lethality was judged with a 25mm cannon for analysis, before the Army planned to mount a 30mm cannon. <b>The</b> <b>CBO</b> report did give credit to cost, assuming the Army's goal of $13 million per vehicle. However, Pentagon cost assessments estimated the price at $16–$17 million per vehicle.|$|E
40|$|Each year, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) publishes its Budget and Economic Outlook. <b>The</b> <b>CBO’s</b> deficit {{projections}} {{for the current}} fiscal year (FY) and the next 10 FYs are widely followed because they provide an assessment of the medium-term budget outlook based on current law and a presumed path for the economy over the next decade. Admittedly, this task is more difficult because of the required assumption that the laws governing future outlays and revenues do not change. Nevertheless, given its nonpartisan nature and <b>the</b> <b>CBO’s</b> well-respected staff of professional economists and budget analysts, its projections are closely followed. In this article, the authors update their 2001 assessment of the accuracy of <b>the</b> <b>CBO’s</b> short- and medium-term budget projections by adding an additional 10 years of data. Such analysis is useful in light of the dramatic change in actual and expected fiscal policy, especially over the past few years.

40|$|This study {{describes}} {{and reflects}} on the partnership between Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) and Community-Based Organisations (CBOs) in implementing development projects in Mozambique. This is a qualitative case study, whose methods of data collection were in-depth semi-structured interviews and document analysis. The {{study was conducted with}} two NGOs (one international and one national) and with four CBOs and it took place in Nampula and Gaza provinces and the capital Maputo. The data were analyzed using quantitative method. NGOs and CBOs are different entities in terms of their levels of actuation, responsibilities, nature, and also differ in terms of resources, such as access to information, funding sources and human resources. These differences have raised questions around the possibility of the establishment of an equitable and properly functioning partnership between entities that differ so much in naure. The NGOs depend majorly on external funds to support the CBOs; however they also rely on their own funds or funds made available by local funders' institutions. Equally, <b>the</b> <b>CBOs</b> also undertake, some income activity generation, whose income is used for their own institutional expenses and also to support some community needs, though they rely mostly on funds provided by the NGOs. The central idea {{of this study is that}} despite the differences between NGOs and CBOs they can establish a balanced partnership based on the recognition of the contribution of each partner and on the significance both attribute to the partnership. The differences constitute the basis of the partnership which in turn allows the acquisition of mutual benefits, recognition and sharing of power. In terms of theoretical framework, I have used Agency theory wherein the NGO is the "Principal" which in a relationship governed by a contract delegates <b>the</b> <b>CBOs</b> as <b>the</b> "Agent" of the implementation of projects in the communities. vii The results showed that the partnership between NGOs and CBOs is characterised by complementarities, mutual benefits, exchange, contribution, and sharing of power by both. The partnership is also based on recognition of the weaknesses, strengths and value of each pa 1 iner which give place to a balanced partnership. However being a balanced partnership it is also characterised by conflicts that result from the difference of interest between NGOs and CBOs. Risk constitutes another element that characterizes this partnership since the NGOs delegate <b>the</b> <b>CBOs</b> <b>the</b> implementation of the project and not always <b>the</b> <b>CBOs</b> will perform as it is advocated in the contract. Though, as the partnership is valuable for both, NGOs and CBOs will engage in developing strategies for minimising the potential risk in order to maintain and maximise the partnership. The data also showed that the locus of conflict and risk are essentially linked to misusage of money. Since <b>the</b> <b>CBOs</b> implement <b>the</b> project and are institutionally independent from the NGOs, the NGOs develop some strategies of control to ensure that <b>the</b> <b>CBOs</b> will act in accordance of what the contract advocates. It is within these strategies wherein the conflict arises, especidlly because <b>the</b> <b>CBOs</b> do not always understand some of the strategies adopted by NGOs to ensure the accomplishment of the contract what led <b>the</b> <b>CBOs</b> also to adopt some strategies of resistance. In terms of power and decision-making the data showed that both exercise different kind of power and <b>the</b> <b>CBOs</b> influence <b>the</b> decision-making process, though the NGOs showed to have greater control over the process. The contribution of this study to the existing literature lies in the fact that it brings a different approach to the power relations between NGOs and CBOs, which is usually seen as a relationship of the exercise of power by the NGOs over <b>the</b> <b>CBOs.</b> <b>The</b> study seeks to show that the strategies of resistance, counter power and negotiation developed by <b>the</b> <b>CBOs</b> constitute a different form of exercise of power and influence. It also shows that <b>the</b> <b>CBOs</b> are not passive actors in the partnership because they develop strategies to influence and attract the NGOs in the establishment of partnership and decision-making throughout the project cycle...|$|R

5|$|The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) {{estimated}} that 20.0 million adults (aged 18–64) gained healthcare coverage via ACA as of February 2016, a 2.4 million increase over September 2015.

Of the 20.0 million, an estimated 6.1 million were aged 19–25. Similarly, the Urban Institute issued a report in December 2016 that said that about 19.2 million non-elderly Americans had gained health insurance coverage from 2010 to 2015.

30|$|Finally, {{trust between}} the reward giver and the reward seeker has been {{identified}} as a potential factor influencing motivation (Benabou and Tirole 2003). Although the types of frustrations experienced by some Family Rewards participants are not unusual for cash transfer programs, which might diminish motivation, <b>the</b> <b>CBOs</b> and <b>the</b> helpline created a good degree of trust for the program—through dedicated customer service, community-building social events and clear explanations of rules for payment and their legitimacy.

40|$|The {{analyses}} of fiscal and monetary policies that the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) provides Congress {{tend to be}} biased, encouraging the use of activist stabilization policies. <b>The</b> <b>CBO’s</b> virtual neglect of economic uncertainties and its emphasis on very short time horizons make active policies appear much more attractive than its own model implies. Moreover, <b>the</b> <b>CBO’s</b> adoption of <b>the</b> macroeconometric approach fundamentally biases its analyses. Macroeconometric models do not remain invariant to changes in policy rules and are mute on the implications of alternative policies for efficiency and income distribution. The rational expectations equilibrium approach overcomes these difficulties and implies that less activist and less inflationary policies are desirable. ...|$|R

25|$|In {{terms of}} {{the impact on the}} federal budget, <b>the</b> <b>CBO</b> {{estimates}} that deficits would reduce between 2011–2020, but in part due to the risk-based assessment fees levied to initially capitalize the Orderly Liquidation Fund; after which, the majority of revenue for the fund would be drawn primarily from interest payments. Due to this, <b>the</b> <b>CBO</b> projects that eventually the money being paid into the Fund (in the form of fees) would be exceeded by the expenses of the Fund itself.

30|$|First, {{psychological}} studies on behavior associated with earning rewards {{suggest that it}} is important that incentives be understood and translatable into specific action by potential recipients (Eisenberger et al. 1999).
