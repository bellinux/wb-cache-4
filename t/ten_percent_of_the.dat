5|$|Upon taking office, Johnson {{faced the}} {{question}} {{of what to do with}} the Confederacy. President Lincoln had authorized loyalist governments in Virginia, Arkansas, Louisiana, and Tennessee as the Union came to control large parts of those states and advocated a ten percent plan that would allow elections after <b>ten</b> <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> voters in any state took an oath of future loyalty to the Union. Congress considered this too lenient; its own plan, requiring a majority of voters to take the loyalty oath, passed both houses in 1864, but Lincoln pocket vetoed it.|$|E

5|$|Paul finally became sheriff in April 1881, {{but it was}} {{too late}} to reappoint Wyatt Earp as deputy sheriff because on January 1, 1881, the eastern portion of Pima County {{containing}} Tombstone had been split off into the new Cochise County, which would need its own sheriff, based in the county's largest city, Tombstone. This position was filled by a political appointment from the governor, and Wyatt and Behan both wanted the job. The Cochise County sheriff's position was worth more than $40,000 a year (about $ today) because the office holder was also county assessor and tax collector, and the board of supervisors allowed him to keep <b>ten</b> <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> amounts paid.|$|E

In 1984, The Friends raised over $400,000 to pay the salaries of the artistic director, technical director, costume designer, and dance, strings, and production teachers. In later years, The Friends raised up to $1million each year through special events, corporate gifts and sponsorships, advertising sales, and other programs to support the artistic needs of the school including staff salaries, production expenses, scholarships for private lessons, and artists in residence.|$|E
5|$|National referendums, or plebiscites, are {{elections}} whereby {{citizens can}} {{determine whether a}} specific legal text can become official law or not. For this to take place, {{one of the following}} conditions must be met: The president wishes to hold one, both houses of the National Assembly request to hold one, or the citizens petition for it. If the National Assembly calls for a plebiscite, a majority is needed in both chambers for it to be official. If the citizens request a plebiscite, they must gather 430,000 signatures from eligible voters across the country. Additionally, over 30,000 people from each region must sign the petition, including the capital Minsk. Once either condition is met, the president must issue a decree setting the date of the national plebiscite. The plebiscite must take place less than three months after the decree was signed. Local cities can hold their own plebiscites if <b>ten</b> <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> local population ask for it.|$|E

5|$|The {{endoplasmic}} reticulum (ER) is a membranous synthesis and transport organelle {{that is an}} extension of the nuclear envelope. More than half the total membrane in eukaryotic cells is accounted for by the ER. The ER is made up of flattened sacs and branching tubules that are thought to interconnect, so that the ER membrane forms a continuous sheet enclosing a single internal space. This highly convoluted space is called the ER lumen and is also referred to as the ER cisternal space. The lumen takes up about <b>ten</b> <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> entire cell volume. The {{endoplasmic reticulum}} membrane allows molecules to be selectively transferred between the lumen and the cytoplasm, and since it is connected to the nuclear envelope, it provides a channel between the nucleus and the cytoplasm.|$|E
5|$|Shortly afterwards, the {{men were}} split up and sent to various {{locations}} to serve as forced labourers. The majority of the 2/18th's personnel were sent to Blakang Mati, but some remained in Changi, while others were sent to Japan or were sent {{to work on the}} Thaiâ€“Burma Railway. A total of 174 men were sent to Borneo where in 1945 they were subjected to the Sandakan Death Marches, which only about <b>ten</b> <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 2/18th men survived. Despite being separated, though, wherever possible the 2/18th men sought to stay together in their groups and the battalion structure was maintained even in captivity. The battalion's first commanding officer, Varley, was one of those sent to Burma where, as senior Allied officer, he worked to secure the welfare of over 9,000 men working on the railway, including many from the 2/18th. He was later sent to Thailand before being brought back to Singapore once work was completed. In late 1944 he was transferred to Formosa. On 12 September, while en route, the transport shipâ€”Rakuyo Maruâ€”that he and around 1,250 other prisoners were on, was torpedoed by a US submarine, USS Sealion. Varley took charge of several lifeboats of prisoners during the evacuation, attempting to lead them to safety. They were never seen again and are believed to have been machine-gunned several days later by Japanese frigates that were in the area.|$|E
5|$|Torchwoods third series (2009) is a five-part serial {{entitled}} Children of Earth. Aliens {{known as}} the 4-5-6 announce they are coming to Earth. Civil servant John Frobisher (Peter Capaldi) orders the destruction of Torchwood to cover a conspiracy; in 1965, the British government had authorized Jack to sacrifice twelve children to the 4-5-6, which is shown in flashbacks. Jack is blown apart in an explosion, but painfully reconstitutes from an incomplete pile of body parts; Gwen and Ianto escape and later rescue Jack from a concrete grave. Jack's daughter Alice (Lucy Cohu) and grandson Steven (Bear McCausland) are taken into custody by the assassins. The 4-5-6 demand <b>ten</b> <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world's children. Although he handed over twelve children in 1965, Jack refuses to give up any this time around. The 4-5-6 release a fatal virus; Ianto dies in Jack's arms. To create the signal that will destroy the 4-5-6, Jack sacrifices Steven. Six months later, having lost his lover, his grandson and his daughter, he bids farewell to Gwen and is transported aboard an alien ship to leave Earth for parts unknown. In the closing scenes of 2010 Doctor Who special The End of Time, the critically injured Doctor gives each companion a farewell before his impending regeneration. Finding Jack in an exotic alien bar, he leaves him a note containing the name of Titanic crew member Alonso Frame (Russell Tovey), sitting on Jack's left side; the two proceed to flirt.|$|E
30|$|Acoustic methods {{enable us}} to monitor Î¦ remotely. One {{important}} point is that |T| and |R| show approximately linear responses to Î¦ as shown in FiguresÂ  6 and 7 within a range 0.7 <Î¦/Î¦ 0 < 1. This means that they are linear to lnV, not V. This is very advantageous for preslip where V changes over many orders of magnitude but remains in a very low absolute range. Earthquake cycle simulations suggest that acoustically monitorable changes can be fairly large. The strength drop in the preslip period can be as large as several <b>tens</b> <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> coseismic strength change over the whole cycle even when <b>the</b> predicted amount <b>of</b> preslip in <b>the</b> same period is only a minuscule fraction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> coseismic slip.

5|$|The War of the Bavarian Succession was {{the last}} war for both Frederick and Maria Theresa, whose reigns began and ended with wars against one another. Although they {{deployed}} armies {{three to four times}} the size of the armies of the Seven Years' War, neither monarch used the entirety of the military force each had at his or her disposal, making this war-without-battles remarkable. Despite the restraint of the monarchs, some early nineteenth-century casualty estimates suggest that tens of thousands died of starvation and hunger-related disease. Carlyle's more moderate estimate lies at about ten thousand Prussian and probably another ten thousand Austrian dead. Michael Hochedlinger assesses combined casualties at approximately thirty thousand; Robert Kann gives no estimate of casualties but suggests the primary causes of death were cholera and dysentery. Gaston Bodart, whose 1915 work is still considered the authority on Austrian military losses, is specific: five Austrian generals (he does not name them), over twelve thousand soldiers, and 74officers died of disease. In minor actions and skirmishes, nine officers and 265men were killed and four officers and 123men were wounded, but not fatally. Sixty-two officers and 2,802men were taken prisoner, and 137men were missing. Over three thousand Imperial soldiers deserted. Finally, twenty-six officers and 372men were discharged with disabilities. Bodart also gives Prussian losses: one general killed (he does not say which), 87officers and 3,364 men killed, wounded or captured. Overall, he assumes losses of <b>ten</b> <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fighting force. Little has been discovered of civilian casualties, although certainly the civilians also suffered from starvation and disease. There were other damages: for example, Habelschwerdt and one of its hamlets were destroyed by fire.|$|E
