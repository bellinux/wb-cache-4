40|$|We {{propose a}} new static <b>test</b> <b>set</b> {{compaction}} method {{based on a}} careful examination of attributes of fault coverage curves. Our method is based on two key ideas: (1) fault-list and testset partitioning, and (2) vector re-ordering. Typically, the first few vectors of a <b>test</b> <b>set</b> detect {{a large number of}} faults. The remaining vectors usually constitute a large fraction of the <b>test</b> <b>set,</b> but these vectors are included to detect relatively few hard faults. We show that significant compaction can be achieved by partitioning faults into hard and easy faults. This significantly reduces the computational cost for static <b>test</b> <b>set</b> compaction without affecting quality of compaction. The second technique re-orders vectors in a <b>test</b> <b>set</b> by moving sequences that detect hard faults {{to the beginning of the}} <b>test</b> <b>set.</b> Fault simulation of the newly concatenated re-ordered <b>test</b> <b>set</b> results in the omission of several vectors so that the compact <b>test</b> <b>set</b> is smaller than the original <b>test</b> <b>set.</b> Experiments on sev [...] ...|$|R

40|$|It was {{recently}} observed that, {{in order to}} improve the defect coverage of a <b>test</b> <b>set,</b> <b>test</b> generation based on fault models such as the single-line stuck-at model may need to be augmented so as to derive <b>test</b> <b>sets</b> that detect each modeled fault more than once.

Additionally, we study the effects of <b>test</b> <b>set</b> compaction on the defect coverage of such <b>test</b> <b>sets.</b> For the purpose of experimentation, defect coverage is measured by the coverage of surrogate faults, using a framework proposed earlier. Within this framework, we show that the defect coverage {{does not have to be}} sacrificed by test compaction if the <b>test</b> <b>set</b> is computed using appropriate test generation objectives. Moreover, two <b>test</b> <b>sets</b> generated using the same test generation objectives, except that compaction heuristics were used during the generation of one but not the other, typically have similar defect coverages, even if the compacted <b>test</b> <b>set</b> is significantly smaller than the noncompacted one.

Our circuit realization requires only two extra inputs for controllability and one extra output for observability. The cardinality of our <b>test</b> <b>set</b> for an input circuit is (+ 6). For Built-in Self Test (BIST) applications, we show that our <b>test</b> <b>set</b> can be generated internally as easily as a pseudo-random pattern, and that it provides 100 % single stuck-at fault coverage.
