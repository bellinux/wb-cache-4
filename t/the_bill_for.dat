5|$|In 1833, Wilberforce's health {{declined}} {{further and}} {{he suffered a}} severe attack of influenza from which he never fully recovered. He made a final anti-slavery speech in April 1833 at a public meeting in Maidstone, Kent. The following month, the Whig government introduced <b>the</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>for</b> the Abolition of Slavery, formally saluting Wilberforce in the process. On 26 July 1833, Wilberforce heard of government concessions that guaranteed the passing of <b>the</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>for</b> the Abolition of Slavery. The following day he grew much weaker, and he died early {{on the morning of}} 29 July at his cousin's house in Cadogan Place, London.|$|E

5|$|If the PCMR submits {{an adverse}} report, Parliament can either make {{amendments}} to the bill and resubmit it to the Council for approval, or decide to present <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> <b>for</b> the President's assent nonetheless provided that a Parliamentary motion for such action has been passed by at least two-thirds of all MPs. The PCMR has not rendered any adverse reports since it {{was set up in}} 1970.|$|E
5|$|Leading {{up to the}} {{elections}} of 1970, Tydings faced criticism from both parties for his actions as senator. In July 1970, syndicated columnist Marquis Childs noted that Tydings' problems on the left stemmed from his support of a crime bill for the District of Columbia, which was perceived as repressive against African Americans. There was also criticism directed at <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> <b>for</b> writing into law the practices of preventive detention and no knock warrants.|$|E

5|$|The Senate {{passed an}} {{unchanged}} bill on January 22, 2010, with a veto-proof two-thirds' majority, after {{an amendment to}} update the effective date was rejected. The measure moved for final approval to the House of Representatives, but on January 29, House Speaker Calvin Say moved to indefinitely postpone {{a vote on the}} bill, which was approved by voice vote. No votes were recorded and the move deferred action on <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> <b>for</b> 2010 unless two-thirds of Representatives vote to reconsider the bill, and it was considered dead.|$|E
5|$|Through the 1920s and 1930s, Trotter {{subsided}} into a genteel poverty, {{using the}} Guardian {{as an ongoing}} voice of protest. He lobbied for anti-lynching bills in Congress, with limited success. Even when the House overwhelmingly passed such a bill in 1922, the Southern bloc in the Senate filibustered and effectively killed passage of <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> <b>for</b> three years running. (White Democrats effectively controlled nearly all the Congressional seats apportioned to {{the total population of}} the South, after having disfranchised blacks.) They controlled chairmanships of numerous important committees, which were established by seniority.|$|E

5|$|By late 1915, British {{forces in}} the border areas of Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland, on German East Africa's {{south-western}} flank, were severely stretched. Disease was a constant curse, decimating the ranks. Francis Drummond Chaplin, the British South Africa Company administrator in Southern Rhodesia, offered to provide the British with a column of between 500 and 1,000 askaris, and Whitehall accepted this in March 1916; however, there was then disagreement regarding who would foot <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> <b>for</b> the organisation of this enterprise. After this was resolved in April 1916—the Company agreed to pay, conditional on reimbursement by the British Colonial Office—recruitment began in May.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{work began}} in August 1898, {{although}} the BS was continuing {{to develop new}} route plans. <b>The</b> <b>bill</b> <b>for</b> 1899, published on 22 November 1898, requested more time for the construction works and proposed two extensions to the railway and a modification to part of the previously approved route. The first extension, like the NC's plan from the year before, was to branch from the already-approved route under Park Crescent, but then followed a more northerly route than the NC, running under Regent's Park to cross the park's Outer Circle between Chester Road and Cumberland Gate where a station was to be constructed. The route then followed Cumberland Street West (now Nash Street), Cumberland Market, Cumberland Street East and Edward Street (both now Varndell Street), before ending at a station under Cardington Street {{on the west side}} of Euston station.|$|E
5|$|In 1903 Synge left Paris {{and moved}} to London. He had written two one-act plays, Riders to the Sea and The Shadow of the Glen, the {{previous}} year. These met with Lady Gregory's approval and The Shadow of the Glen was performed at the Molesworth Hall in October 1903. Riders to the Sea was performed at the same venue in February the following year. The Shadow of the Glen, under the title In the Shadow of the Glen, formed part of <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> <b>for</b> the opening run of the Abbey Theatre from 27 December 1904 to 3 January 1905. Both plays were based on stories that Synge had collected in the Aran Islands, and Synge relied on props from the Aran Islands to help {{set the stage for}} each of them. He also relied on Hiberno-English, the English dialect of Ireland, to reinforce its usefulness as a literary language, partly because he believed that the Irish language could not survive.|$|E

5|$|In 1972 a {{testimonial}} {{match was}} organised by Everton on Lawton's behalf {{to help him}} pay off his debts of around £6,000. However his financial situation was still bleak, and on two occasions he narrowly avoided a prison sentence for failing to pay his rates after an Arsenal supporters club and later an anonymous former co-worker stepped in to pay <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> <b>for</b> him. In August 1974, he was again found Guilty of obtaining goods by deception after failing to repay a £10 debt to a publican, {{and was sentenced to}} 200 hours of Community service and ordered to pay £40 costs. In 1984, he began writing a column for the Nottingham Evening Post. Brentford also organised a testimonial match for him in May 1985.|$|E
5|$|In June 1893, {{when the}} Australasian Federal League was formed {{at a meeting}} in the Sydney Town Hall, Garran joined {{immediately}} and was made a member of the executive committee. He was one of the League's four delegates to the 1893 Corowa Conference and a League delegate to the 1896 Bathurst Conference, informal conferences held between members of the League (primarily based in Sydney), the Australian Natives' Association (mainly Victorian) and other pro-federation groups. At Corowa he was part of an impromptu group organised by John Quick which drafted a resolution, passed at the Conference, calling on the colonial parliaments to hold a directly elected Constitutional Convention to be charged with drafting <b>the</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>for</b> the Constitution of Australia. The proposal, which {{came to be known as}} the Corowa Plan, was later accepted at the 1895 Premiers' Conference and formed the basis for the federation process over the following five years.|$|E
5|$|In some matters Tyler was on {{good terms}} with Jackson. He defended Jackson for vetoing the Maysville Road funding project, which Jackson {{considered}} unconstitutional. He voted to confirm several of the president's appointments, including Jackson's future running mate Martin Van Buren as United States Minister to Britain. The leading issue in the 1832 presidential election was the recharter of the Second Bank of the United States, which both Tyler and Jackson opposed. Congress voted to recharter the bank in July 1832, and Jackson vetoed <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> <b>for</b> both constitutional and practical reasons. Tyler voted to sustain the veto and endorsed the president in his successful bid for re-election.|$|E

5|$|The Goodison Park {{structure}} {{was built in}} stages. In the summer of 1895 a new Bullens Road stand was built and a roof placed on the original Goodison Road stand but only after five directors, including Chairman, George Mahon had resigned over what was described in the club minutes as 'acute administrative difficulties'. In 1906, the doubled-decker Goodison Avenue Stand was built behind the goal {{at the south end}} of the ground. The stand was designed by Liverpool architect Henry Hartley who went on to chair the Liverpool Architectural Society a year later. The club minutes from the time show that Hartley was unhappy with certain aspects of the stand and the poor sightlines meant that the goal line had to be moved seven metres north, towards Gwladys Street. In January 1908, he complained that his fees had not been paid and <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> <b>for</b> the stand was near £13,000. There were 2,657 seats on its upper tier with a terrace below.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>bill</b> <b>for</b> {{the plane}} {{remained}} unpaid. In 1914 Vickers reminded Mawson, who had apparently forgotten the outstanding debt. Mawson wrote to Vickers director Sir Trevor Dawson in November 1916, requesting the company write off the bill as a donation. His company buoyed by armaments contracts, Dawson agreed. The next expedition {{to take a}} plane to the Antarctic was Shackleton's 1921–22 Quest Expedition, but the Avro Baby remained grounded owing to missing parts. Not until 16November 1928—when Hubert Wilkins and Carl Ben Eielson flew for 20minutes around Deception Island, {{just over a year}} before Admiral Richard Evelyn Byrd's first flight over the South Pole—was a plane airborne in the Antarctic.|$|E
5|$|While still {{popular with}} the Rhodesian Front members, he was criticised at the 1972 Party Congress for his lack of success in {{improving}} Rhodesia's image around the world; however, he retained the confidence of Ian Smith and was kept on in a government reshuffle on 24 May 1973. That winter saw him promote a new Broadcasting Bill to transfer control of the monopoly Rhodesian Broadcasting Corporation. Allan Savory, then the lone white opposition MP, criticised <b>the</b> <b>Bill</b> <b>for</b> {{the composition of the}} proposed board, which was dominated by strong supporters of the Rhodesian Front. Van der Byl insisted, somewhat unsuccessfully to foreign observers, that the government was not trying to take over broadcasting.|$|E
