5|$|With {{the advent}} of high {{resolution}} imaging, researchers have started to obtain experimental data which have led them to question the assumptions of the Cassie–Baxter equation when calculating the apparent contact angle. These groups believe the apparent contact angle is largely dependent on <b>the</b> <b>triple</b> line. <b>The</b> <b>triple</b> line, which is {{in contact with the}} heterogeneous surface, cannot rest on the heterogeneous surface {{like the rest of the}} drop. In theory, it should follow the surface imperfection. This bending in triple line is unfavorable and is not seen in real-world situations. A theory that preserves the Cassie–Baxter equation while at the same time explaining the presence of minimized energy state of <b>the</b> <b>triple</b> line hinges on the idea of a precursor film. This film of submicrometer thickness advances ahead of the motion of the droplet and is found around <b>the</b> <b>triple</b> line. Furthermore, this precursor film allows <b>the</b> <b>triple</b> line to bend and take different conformations that were originally considered unfavorable. This precursor fluid has been observed using environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM) in surfaces with pores formed in the bulk. With the introduction of the precursor film concept, <b>the</b> <b>triple</b> line can follow energetically feasible conformations and thereby correctly explaining the Cassie–Baxter model.|$|E
