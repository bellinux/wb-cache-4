5|$|Industrialist Charles M.

By 1907, Rhyolite had electric lights, water mains, telephones, newspapers, a hospital, a school, an opera house, and a stock exchange. Published estimates of the town's peak population vary widely, but scholarly sources generally place it in a range between 3,500 and 5,000 in 1907–08.|$|E
5|$|Pantulf {{was from}} Noron in the Calvados region of Normandy.

5|$|In 1842, Conroy {{settled at}} his {{family home in}} Arborfield Hall near Reading, Berkshire and became a gentleman farmer, winning prizes for his pig breeding. He founded <b>the</b> <b>Montgomery</b> Regiment of Militia in 1849. Despite his {{pensions}} and ownership of properties and lead mines in Wales, Conroy was in substantial debt when he died on 2 March 1854 at Arborfield. His eldest son Edward succeeded him to the baronetcy. After his death, the Duchess of Kent finally agreed to open her financial accounts and acknowledged that significant funds were missing. She was moved to admit that Conroy had swindled her {{while at the same}} time hurting her relationship with Victoria for his own benefit. A rapprochement followed between mother and daughter.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} morning of December 28, police {{informed}} news sources {{that she had been}} walking southbound on Interstate 71 near Union Township when she was struck by a semi-trailer just before 2:30 am near the South Lebanon exit.

The highway was closed {{for more than an hour}} after the incident. An investigation was launched by the Ohio State Highway Patrol, while Alcorn's body was transported to <b>the</b> <b>Montgomery</b> County coroner, where an autopsy was scheduled.

While <b>the</b> <b>Montgomery</b> County portion has not changed much in the ensuing decades, MD 410 has been realigned and extended multiple times within Prince George's County. These changes include an extension along existing roads further into Hyattsville in the mid-1940s, a realignment within Hyattsville in the mid-1950s, an extension through Riverdale in the late 1960s, and the final extension to Landover Hills in the early 1990s.|$|E

5|$|On December 1, 1955, Rosa Parks {{was arrested}} for refusing {{to give up her}} seat on a city bus. <b>The</b> <b>Montgomery</b> bus boycott, urged and planned by Nixon and led by King, soon followed. The boycott lasted for 385 days, and the {{situation}} became so tense that King's house was bombed. King was arrested during this campaign, which concluded with a United States District Court ruling in Browder v. Gayle that ended racial segregation on all Montgomery public buses. King's role in the bus boycott transformed him into a national figure and the best-known spokesman of the civil rights movement.|$|E
5|$|Ralph {{was the son}} of Seffrid d'Escures and {{his first}} wife Rascendis, and a half brother of Seffrid I, Bishop of Chichester from 1125 to 1145. The surname of de Turbine, by which he is {{sometimes}} known in older scholarship, is only attested in the fourteenth century and possibly resulted from confusion with William de Corbeil, Ralph's successor at Canterbury. Ralph studied at the school at the Abbey of Bec before entering the abbey of St Martin at Séez in 1079. St. Martin was a house founded by <b>the</b> <b>Montgomery</b> and Bellême families, and was still under their lordship. He became abbot of the house in 1091, and his election was attended by Anselm, abbot of Bec.|$|E
5|$|Rhyolite {{declined}} {{almost as}} rapidly as it rose. After the richest ore was exhausted, production fell. The 1906 San Francisco earthquake and the financial panic of 1907 {{made it more difficult}} to raise development capital. In 1908, investors in <b>the</b> <b>Montgomery</b> Shoshone Mine, concerned that it was overvalued, ordered an independent study. When the study's findings proved unfavorable, the company's stock value crashed, further restricting funding. By the end of 1910, the mine was operating at a loss, and it closed in 1911. By this time, many out-of-work miners had moved elsewhere, and Rhyolite's population dropped well below 1,000. By 1920, it was close to zero.|$|E

50|$|In 1968, the Gershen brothers, {{who were}} raised in New Jersey, formed a rock band in New York City called <b>the</b> <b>Montgomeries.</b> Another {{founding}} member of this band was Tony Brown who would later appear on Bob Dylan’s album “Blood on the Tracks.” In 1969, <b>the</b> <b>Montgomeries</b> relocated to Woodstock, where they crossed paths with other recently transplanted musicians including Van Morrison, who often played gigs with them. Morrison, in fact, became {{a good friend of}} <b>the</b> <b>Montgomeries</b> and <b>the</b> band that would become Borderline during the early days in Woodstock. After <b>the</b> <b>Montgomeries</b> broke up, Jon Gershen met Rooney, a veteran of the Boston folk music scene who had moved to Woodstock in 1971. Rooney was at the time working as business manager at Bearsville Studios, which was built by Albert Grossman, who managed Bob Dylan, Janis Joplin and the Band. Guitarists Rooney and Gershen got together for some informal music-making sessions and discovered they had a unique sound that should be pursued further. Soon after, they invited David Gershen - who specialized in folk and country music - to join in. The trio, still unnamed, began seriously working together in the fall of 1971. They landed a record contract with United Artists Records, which had once expressed interest in <b>the</b> <b>Montgomeries.</b> They eventually chose the name Borderline to reflect the way their different styles existed in close proximity to each other.|$|R

The Crucible Theatre is the home (since 1977) of the World Snooker Championships and hosts many well-known stage productions throughout the year. The Lyceum, which opened in 1897, serves as a venue for touring West End productions and operas by Opera North, as well as locally produced shows. Sheffield also has <b>the</b> <b>Montgomery</b> Theatre, a small 420 seater theatre located {{a short distance from}} Tudor Square, opposite the town hall on Surrey Street. There are also a large number of smaller amateur theatres scattered throughout the city.|$|E
5|$|Tickets officially {{went on sale}} December 4, {{and three}} days later, Virginia Tech had sold out its entire initial {{allotment}} of 15,000 tickets. A second allotment of 2,400 tickets was sold out in a few hours, leaving ticketless fans disgruntled. Many fans who were turned away at the Virginia Tech ticket office bought tickets from the secondary market or traveled to New Orleans in hopes of buying tickets at the game. So many Virginia Tech fans traveled to the game that <b>the</b> <b>Montgomery</b> County school district extended its winter break one day to avoid a shortage of teachers and students. The crowds also caused problems at Roanoke Regional Airport, the nearest airport to Virginia Tech. Forty-three aircraft chartered by Virginia Tech fans arrived in New Orleans on a single day.|$|E
5|$|Swiatek and Breen {{described}} the Alabama half dollar as {{caught up in}} the presidential election of 1920, as a Republican administration might not be willing to put the Democrat Wilson on a coin, or might insist on the new incumbent appearing, something likely to dampen sales in Alabama, part of the Democratic Solid South. The Republican, Ohio Senator Warren G. Harding, won the election and was inaugurated in March 1921. On June 29, 1921, Owen wrote to Baker, suggesting a new pair of honorees for the coin: Kilby, the state's chief executive {{at the time of the}} 1919 centennial, and the State of Alabama's first governor, William Bibb. Cartoonist Frank Spangler of <b>the</b> <b>Montgomery</b> Advertiser prepared sketches of the new design. At James Fraser's suggestion, the plaster models were created by his wife, Laura Gardin Fraser, who was a noted sculptor in her own right. She shipped her completed work to the Commission of Fine Arts on September 22, 1921, and gained members' approval; the models were then sent to the Philadelphia Mint for use in making coinage dies. Laura Fraser thus became the first woman to design a coin, not only of the U.S., but of any country.|$|E
