50|$|In {{real life}} {{situations}} one never encounters a zero lead time. There {{is always a}} time lag from <b>the</b> <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>placing</b> an order for material and the date on which materials are received. As a result the reorder point is always higher than zero, and if the firm places the order when the inventory reaches the reorder point, the new goods will arrive before the firm runs out of goods to sell. The decision on how much stock to hold is generally {{referred to as the}} order point problem, that is, how low should the inventory be depleted before it is reordered.|$|E

40|$|No toponym {{has come}} from nothing and {{there has always been}} a linkbetween a place and its name. When it {{concerns}} the past, it is a scholar’s task to explore this connection. The article discusses Estonian-Swedish maritime place names from an archaeological perspective, and is based on the premise that research into toponyms should depart from the principle that the scholar tries to reconstruct the name giver’s viewpoint. The article deals with two main topics: the meanings <b>of</b> <b>place</b> names related to the Estonian Swedes’ possible practical use of the coast and sea, and, more importantly, to the possible function <b>of</b> <b>place</b> names as indicators of archaeologically interesting maritime locations.
