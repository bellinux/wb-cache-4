500|$|Producers of Mad Men {{approached}} January Jones {{to portray}} Betty Draper, Don's {{wife and the}} mother of their two children. Jones avouched that portraying the character would give the audience an opportunity to see a dark side of her nature. She initially auditioned for the role of Peggy Olson, which was later given to fellow cast member Elisabeth Moss. [...] "It got down between Elisabeth Moss and myself, and it was obviously more suited to her, but Matthew had said, you know, there’s this other role, of the wife." [...] Jones signed a seven-year contract with the show, although her character originally had two lines in [...] "Smoke Gets in Your Eyes." [...] Weiner eventually edited the script to accommodate her desires. [...] "It’s such a testament to his ability," [...] Jones stated. [...] "He just took something out of thin air, which makes me <b>think</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> he had to have had an idea that the wife was {{going to be part of}} the show, because I kind of took the job with the promise that Betty would be a part of the show. When you sign a seven-year contract, you want to make sure you’re in the show." [...] Christina Hendricks was brought in to play Joan Holloway, the office manager and head of Sterling Cooper's secretarial pool. While Hendricks had previously made recurring appearances on ER before being on Mad Men, her acting career had been largely inactive, and Hendricks' agent urged her not to participate in the project. [...] "They said to me, 'AMC [...] doesn't have any other big shows—why would you do this instead of taking something that's a better bet?' I said, 'Look, I've gone with the one that's the better bet in the past—let's go with the really good script this time.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|The investigation, {{known as}} the Siegal {{committee}}, found heated debate among the staff over affirmative action hiring, as Blair is African American. Jonathan Landman, Blair's editor, told the Siegal committee he felt that Blair's being black played a large part in the younger man's initial promotion in 2001 to full-time staffer. [...] "I think race was the decisive factor in his promotion," [...] he said. [...] "I thought then and I <b>think</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> {{it was the wrong}} decision." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, {{we shall}} know better next time, Terence. I <b>think</b> <b>that,</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> it is light, {{we had better}} get some sleep, by turns. Do you lie down for four hours, and then I will take a turn." ...|$|R

She's {{spouting}} like a daisy, and I knew she would, from the first," [...] said Bob, as he came in to breakfast next morning, after having worked all night, his joy so great {{that he did not}} even feel the fatigue.|$|R
6000|$|... 'We shall take {{a dose of}} {{him every}} night after dinner to {{complete}} the resemblance.
