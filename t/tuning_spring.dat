40|$|In {{the field}} of nanomechanics, {{parametric}} excitations are of interest since they can greatly enhance sensing capabilities and eliminate cross-talk. However, parametric excitations often rely on externally <b>tuned</b> <b>springs,</b> which limits their application to high quality factor resonators and usually does not allow excitation of multiple higher modes into parametric resonance. Here we demonstrate parametric amplification and resonance of suspended single-layer graphene membranes by an efficient opto-thermal drive that modulates the intrinsic spring constant. With a large amplitude of the optical drive, {{a record number of}} 14 mechanical modes can be brought into parametric resonance by modulating a single parameter: the pretension.

40|$|In {{the field}} of mobile {{agricultural}} and off-road machinery, {{there is a growing}} interest to examine the dynamic behaviour of the vehicle under construction with a view to improve passenger comfort and machine performance. As many of these machine constructors are small sized, specialised companies are required to execute vibration tests and to evaluate vibration levels. Because most of these machines are heavy constructions with exceptional proportions, it is obvious to perform vibration tests on the factory floor by means of a low power mobile excitation device such as an electro-hydraulic shaker. This paper shows that an air spring, parallel to the actuator of an electro-hydraulic shaker, results in considerable power savings. The behaviour of the shaker is discussed at its resonance frequencies. For small band excitation signals, extra power savings can be achieved by <b>tuning</b> the <b>spring</b> stiffness and by using the air spring at constant pressure. Experiments on a one degree of freedom vertical shaker show good agreement with the theory and demonstrate that the different mode shapes of an agricultural tractor can be sufficiently excited with a nominal hydraulic power of 500 W.

40|$|SYNOPSIS. Animals {{can lower}} the {{metabolic}} cost of swimming by using appropriately <b>tuned,</b> elastic <b>springs.</b> Jet-powered invertebrates use springs that lie in functional parallel to their swimming muscles to power half the locomotor cycle. The parallel geometry constrains the spring to be non-linearly elastic; muscle power is diverted {{to load the}} spring only when swimming muscles are not capable of producing maximal hydro-dynamic thrust. The springs of jellyfish and scallops are forced at or near their resonant frequency, producing large energy savings. Measuring the contribution of elastic energy storage to jet-powered locomotion has been facilitated by the relatively simple geometries of invertebrate locomotor systems. In contrast, complex musculoskeletal systems and kinematics have complicated the study of springs in swimming vertebrates. Skins, tendons and axial skeletons of some vertebrate swimmers have appropri-ate mechanical properties to act as springs. To date, though, there exist {{just a handful of}} studies that have investigated the mechanical behaviors of these locomotor structures in swimming vertebrates, and these data have yet to be integrated with measures of swimming power. Integrating mechanical, kinematic, hydrodynamic and metabolic data are required to understand more fully the role of elastic springs in vertebrate swimming energetics...|$|R
50|$|Some {{pneumatic}} recoil buffers used in firearms are fast, low-power gas springs. When compressed, {{they present}} initial resistance as the rod-to-seal grip is broken {{and then they}} move in a regular manner. An additional small spring can be used inside the gas spring if rapid turnaround times are needed. Springs twist and the coils try to ride over each other when moving and this chaotic movement does not exist with gas springs, hence reducing twist and jump of the firearm. These features are very advantageous. Fine <b>tuning</b> of the <b>spring</b> power is also possible by altering the internal gas volume. This design for firearms was invented and patented by Collins and Shipman of Bedford, UK and Bergstrom in the U.S. in 2001.|$|R
