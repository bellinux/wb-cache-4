The focus {{of this paper is}} the transformative scope of social innovation initiatives promoted by CSOsin two <b>public</b> <b>arenas</b> in Brazil: <b>the</b> fight against electoral corruption and the protection of children and adolescents? rights. The research consisted of three stages: 1) controversy mapping {{to understand}} <b>the</b> configuration ofthese <b>public</b> <b>arenas</b> and compare <b>the</b> trajectories of <b>the</b> <b>public</b> problems studied; 2) observation of the ?field of experience? of some CSOs that perform in these arenas; and 3) analysis of ?political grammars? produced in public arenas, connecting them to the performance of the CSOs analysed. The results reveal how social innovation emerges, develops and is disseminated in <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>arenas</b> studied and highlights the similarities and differences between the two cases, discussing the practices and role of CSOs in these processes. As conclusions, the study indicates that social innovation initiatives promoted by CSOs are influenced by and {{have an effect on the}} ?political culture? in <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>arenas.</b> Additionally, this work states that the regime of CSOs? engagement in the public sphere and their performance have consequences in terms of influence on social and political changes. In the cases studied, when CSOs go beyond the logic of coproduction of public services and engage in ?public inquiry? processes, their capacity to inspire social transformation seems to be enhanced...|$|R

What entertainment is for one group or individual may be regarded as work by another.|$|E
5|$|During {{this period}} the {{struggle}} against colonial rule intensified. Nationalism became the pre-eminent cause. Claiming Indian superiority became the tool of cultural revivalism resulting in an essentialising model of Indian womanhood {{similar to that of}} Victorian womanhood: special yet separated from public space. Gandhi legitimised and expanded Indian women's public activities by initiating them into the non-violent civil disobedience movement against the British Raj. He exalted their feminine roles of caring, self-abnegation, sacrifice and tolerance; and carved a niche for those in <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>arena.</b> Peasant women {{played an important role in}} the rural satyagrahas of Borsad and Bardoli. Women-only organisations like All India Women's Conference (AIWC) and the National Federation of Indian Women (NFIW) emerged. Women were grappling with issues relating to the scope of women's political participation, women's franchise, communal awards, and leadership roles in political parties.|$|E

25|$|Pakistani women lack {{social value}} and status because of {{negation}} of {{their roles as}} producers and providers in all social roles. The preference for sons due to their productive role often dictates the allocation of household resources in their favor. Traditionally, male {{members of the family}} are given better education and are equipped with skills to compete for resources in <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>arena,</b> while female members are imparted domestic skills to be good mothers and wives. Lack of skills, limited opportunities in the job market, and social, religious and cultural restrictions limit women’s chances to compete for resources in <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>arena.</b> This situation has led to the social and economic dependency of women that becomes the basis for male power over women in all social relationships.|$|E
