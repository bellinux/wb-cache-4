5|$|Within a coral head, the genetically {{identical}} polyps reproduce asexually, {{either by}} budding (gemmation) or by dividing, whether longitudinally or <b>transversely.</b>|$|E
5|$|Toroids : The fossil Vendoglossa tuberculata {{from the}} Nama Group, Namibia, has been {{interpreted}} as a dorso-ventrally compressed stem-group metazoan, with a large gut cavity and a <b>transversely</b> ridged ectoderm. The organism is {{in the shape of}} a flattened torus, with the long axis of its toroidal body running through the approximate center of the presumed gut cavity.|$|E
5|$|A {{sea anemone}} {{is capable of}} {{changing}} its shape dramatically. The column and tentacles have longitudinal, transverse and diagonal sheets of muscle and can lengthen and contract, as well as bend and twist. The gullet and mesenteries can evert (turn inside out), or the oral disc and tentacles can retract inside the gullet, with the sphincter closing the aperture; during this process, the gullet folds <b>transversely</b> and water is discharged through the mouth.|$|E
5|$|Both {{tracks and}} wheels {{were used for}} {{steering}}. The steering system was set up so that gentle turns used just the steerable front wheels, but brakes would {{be applied to the}} tracks the farther the steering wheel was turned. The drive sprocket had the track-saving but more complicated rollers rather than the more common teeth. The rear suspension consisted of five double roadwheels, overlapping and interleaved in the Schachtellaufwerk layout, mounted on swing arms sprung by torsion bars. An idler wheel, mounted {{at the rear of the}} vehicle, was used to control track tension. The front axle had <b>transversely</b> mounted leaf springs and shock absorbers - the only ones on the vehicle.|$|E
5|$|In the holotype of C. casuarius, {{the sides}} and tail of the body are covered in scales of several types. Polygonal tuberculate scales, covered in small bumps, vary in size over the body. Conical limpet-like scales are only {{preserved}} on a fold of skin preserved {{on the back of}} the tibia, but which was probably from the bottom of the belly, rather than the leg. Separating the polygonal scales of C. casuarius are shieldlike scales, arranged close together in rows. Ossified tendons are present on all the vertebrae, except for those in the cervical region. On no vertebrae do the tendons extend below the transverse processes. Each tendon is flattened at its origin, and <b>transversely</b> ovoid in the central rod, ending at a rounded point.|$|E
5|$|In the {{particular}} {{version of the}} experiment shown here, Hoek used a prism P to disperse light from a slit into a spectrum which passed through a collimator C before entering the apparatus. With the apparatus oriented parallel to the hypothetical aether wind, Hoek expected the light in one circuit to be retarded 7/600mm {{with respect to the}} other. Where this retardation represented an integral number of wavelengths, he expected to see constructive interference; where this retardation represented a half-integral number of wavelengths, he expected to see destructive interference. In the absence of dragging, his expectation was for the observed spectrum to be continuous with the apparatus oriented <b>transversely</b> to the aether wind, and to be banded with the apparatus oriented parallel to the aether wind. His actual experimental results were completely negative.|$|E
5|$|The fourth upper premolar (P4) {{has four}} main, <b>transversely</b> placed crests; the {{description}} of S.bolligeri mentions an additional, centrally placed small crest. De Bruijn interpreted the four main crests as the anteroloph, protoloph, metaloph, and posteroloph {{from front to back}} and wrote that these crests are not connected {{on the sides of the}} tooth. Prieto and Böhme note that the posteroloph is convex on the back margin of the tooth. In Muscardinus, the number of ridges on P4 ranges from five in Muscardinus sansaniensis to two in M.pliocaenicus and the living hazel dormouse, but the protoloph and metaloph are always connected on the lingual (inner) side of the tooth. P4 is two-rooted in S.alpinus and three-rooted in S.bolligeri.|$|E
5|$|This is {{the manner}} in which they are made; two (parallel) walls of very thick wooden (planking) are raised, and across the space between them are placed very thick planks (the bulkheads) secured {{longitudinally}} and <b>transversely</b> by means of large nails, each three ells in length. When these walls have thus been built, the lower deck is fitted in, and the ship is launched before the upper works are finished. The pieces of wood, and those parts of the hull, near the water(-line) serve for the crew to wash and to accomplish their natural necessities. On the sides of these pieces of wood also the oars are found; they are as big as masts, and are worked by 10 or 15 men (each), who row standing up.|$|E
5|$|The Stonesfield Slate {{material}} {{contains no}} neck vertebrae; {{but a single}} broken anterior cervical vertebra is known from the New Park Quarry, specimen BMNH R9674. The breakage reveals large internal air chambers. The vertebra is also otherwise heavily pneumatised, with large pleurocoels, pneumatic excavations, on its sides. The rear facet of the centrum is strongly concave. The neck ribs are short. The front dorsal vertebrae are slightly opisthocoelous, with convex front centrum facets and concave rear centrum facets. They are also deeply keeled, with the ridge on the underside representing about 50% of the total centrum height. The front dorsals perhaps have a pleurocoel above the diapophysis, the lower rib joint process. The rear dorsal vertebrae, according to Benson, are not pneumatised. They are slightly amphicoelous, with hollow centrum facets. They have secondary joint processes, forming a hyposphene–hypantrum complex, the hyposphene having a triangular transverse cross-section. The height of the dorsal spines of the rear dorsals is unknown, but a high spine on a tail vertebra of the New Park Quarry material, specimen BMNH R9677, suggests {{the presence of a}} crest on the hip area. The spines of the five vertebrae of the sacrum form a supraneural plate, fused at the top. The undersides of the sacral vertebrae are rounded but the second sacral is keeled; normally it is the third or fourth sacral having a ridge. The sacral vertebrae seem not to be pneumatised but have excavations at their sides. The tail vertebrae are slightly amphicoelous, with hollow centrum facets on both the front and rear side. They have excavations at their sides and a longitudinal groove on the underside. The neural spines of the tail basis are <b>transversely</b> thin and tall, representing {{more than half of the}} total vertebral height.|$|E
5|$|The scapula {{was short}} with a {{moderately}} expanded upper end. The coracoid was circular in side view. The {{elements of the}} forelimb were generally moderately long, straight and stout. The hand is only known from recent discoveries and {{has not yet been}} described. In the rather wide pelvis, the ilium was straight in side view. Its front blade was rod-shaped and moderately splayed to the outside, creating room for the belly. This was reinforced by the sacral ribs becoming longer towards the front. The sacral ribs were wider at their attachment areas with the ilium, but were not fused into a sacral yoke. The pubis featured a short prepubis. The pubis shaft was straight, running parallel to a straight ischium shaft that was <b>transversely</b> flattened at its lower end. The thighbone was straight in side view, in front view it was somewhat bowed to the outside. Its head was not separated from the shaft by a real neck. While the major trochanter was at about the same level as the head, the lower minor trochanter was separated from both by a deep cleft. At it rear side, the femur mid-shaft featured a well-developed drooping fourth trochanter, a process for the attachment of the retractor tail muscle, the Musculus caudofemoralis longus. The lower leg was somewhat shorter than the thighbone. The tibia had a wide upper end, with a cnemial crest protruding well to the front. The tibia lower end was also robust and rotated about 70° compared to the upper part, turning the foot strongly to the outside. The foot was very large and wide. The fifth metatarsal was only rudimentary but the other four were robust. Scelidosaurus had four large toes, with the innermost digit being the smallest. The fourth metatarsal was short but its toe was long and built to be splayed to the outside of the foot, to improve the stability. The claws were flat, hoof-shaped and curved to the inside.|$|E
25|$|Some {{particular}} contemporary {{developments are}} {{the proliferation of}} front- and all-wheel drive, {{the adoption of the}} diesel engine, and the ubiquity of fuel injection. Most modern passenger cars are front-wheel-drive monocoque/unibody designs, with <b>transversely</b> mounted engines.|$|E
25|$|Model T {{suspension}} {{employed a}} <b>transversely</b> mounted semi-elliptical spring {{for each of}} the front and rear beam axles which allowed a great deal of wheel movement to cope with the dirt roads of the time.|$|E
25|$|The Lagrangian Floer {{homology}} of two <b>transversely</b> intersecting Lagrangian submanifolds of a symplectic manifold is the homology {{of a chain}} complex {{generated by}} the intersection points of the two submanifolds and whose differential counts pseudoholomorphic Whitney discs.|$|E
25|$|The Robbe had upward tilted, stabilizing, chined floats {{at about}} one third span, each mounted on N-form struts and <b>transversely</b> braced with {{converging}} struts to the wing below the engine mountings. Each float was divided into three watertight compartments.|$|E
25|$|The {{dimensions}} of these parts are usually co-ordinated such that two bricks laid {{side by side}} separated only by {{the width of a}} perpend have a total width identical to the length of a single brick laid <b>transversely</b> on top of them.|$|E
25|$|The lift {{includes}} two cars that travel the distance simultaneously in opposite directions. The cars have three doors {{on either side}} (with two flanked windows per door), and three compartments within the platform, with wooden seats oriented <b>transversely</b> from the central body.|$|E
25|$|Crotalus ruber is {{very similar}} in pattern to C. atrox, but it is {{distinguished}} by its reddish color, to which the specific name, ruber, refers. Also, the first lower labial scale on each side is <b>transversely</b> divided to form a pair of anterior chin shields.|$|E
25|$|The {{cervical}} vertebrae had well-developed cervical ribs, {{fused to}} the vertebral body. The ribs were elongated, with a forward-pointing process on the capitulum, the main rib head. The neural spines {{of the rear}} cervicals and front dorsals are <b>transversely</b> expanded at their upper ends due to rugosities serving as an attachment for tendons. This expanded sector projects to the front also, creating a notch on the lower front edge. Additionally the neural spine base is <b>transversely</b> constricted. Ridges extend to the rear {{from the sides of}} the neural spine base, over the upper sides of the rear joint processes, the postzygapophyses. These postzygapophyses themselves project far beyond the rear facet of the vertebral body, a derived trait. The prezygapophyses to the contrary, are much shorter; they have a notch at the front upper edge.|$|E
25|$|The LTTF flap is a {{horizontal}} {{variant of the}} vertical TFL flap, nourished by the perforating vessels of either the ascending or the transverse branch of the lateral circumflex femoral artery and vein. The flap is oriented <b>transversely</b> on the tensor fasciae latae, {{also known as the}} “saddlebag” area.|$|E
25|$|When the {{division}} of rooms was fundamentally changed in the 19th century, a separate kitchen {{was established in the}} living accommodation {{at the back of the}} farmhouse. So the farmhouse, which had been divided longitudinally for such a long time, now had its different functions arranged <b>transversely</b> across the building.|$|E
25|$|Mechanical {{changes can}} make {{equipment}} (and control systems) more stable. Sailors add ballast {{to improve the}} stability of ships. Cruise ships use antiroll fins that extend <b>transversely</b> {{from the side of}} the ship for perhaps 30 feet (10 m) and are continuously rotated about their axes to develop forces that oppose the roll.|$|E
25|$|A sleeper is a {{rectangular}} object {{on which the}} rails are supported and fixed. The sleeper has two main roles: to transfer the loads from the rails to the track ballast and the ground underneath, and to hold the rails to the correct width apart (to maintain the rail gauge). They are generally laid <b>transversely</b> to the rails.|$|E
25|$|Eggs are oval spheroids with {{flattened}} bases, about 0.5mm high. They are ribbed (longitudinally, i.e. {{from top}} to bottom) and striated (<b>transversely,</b> i.e. around the egg). Pale cream when laid, eggs darken to pale yellow within two days, and then dark grey {{a few days before}} hatching. Eggs mature in two to three weeks.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} of launch in 2003, it became the world's first dual-clutch {{transmission}} in a series-production car, in the German-market Volkswagen Golf Mk4 R32, and shortly afterwards worldwide, in the original Audi TT 3.2. For {{the first few years}} of production, this original DSG transmission was only available in <b>transversely</b> oriented front-engine, front-wheel-drive and Haldex Traction-based four-wheel-drive vehicle layouts.|$|E
25|$|The RK.25 had a {{traditional}} fixed undercarriage with a track of , its mainwheels {{on a single}} axle supported {{by a pair of}} V-struts from the lower fuselage. The tops of the forward V-strut members were joined <b>transversely</b> by a beam, free to slide vertically between pairs of fuselage members but restrained by sets of rubber rings which also circled the wing structure as it crossed the fuselage.|$|E
25|$|The {{company also}} {{revealed}} the Primo, a 28-seat low-floor minibus, in September 2005. This 7.9 m long vehicle {{is powered by}} the Cummins ISBe Euro III engine, mounted <b>transversely</b> at the rear. The Primo frame is assembled in Hungary by Enterprise Bus, effectively a conventional chassis in most respects but one which extends up to cantrail level, before being shipped to Scarborough for completion.|$|E
25|$|The Polo is {{a compact}} car, with a {{traditional}} <b>transversely</b> mounted engine and front wheel drive. Mark I Polos only came with four cylinder petrol engines, but for the Mark II, a diesel engine was offered for the first time, although only in certain markets, others having {{to wait until the}} launch of the Mark III. The current range includes a variety of three and four cylinder petrol and diesel engines.|$|E
25|$|Under the {{original}} proposal, T95 and T96 tanks {{had to be}} equipped with an X-shaped 750hp 12-cylinder diesel engine. However, because this engine {{was only in the}} early stages of development, it was decided to temporarily equip the tanks with a 4-stroke, 8-cylinder AOI-1195 gasoline engine. The engine was placed <b>transversely</b> and was connected with the XTG-410 four-speed transmission. Three fuel tanks, with a total capacity of 780 liters, were installed in the engine compartment.|$|E
25|$|The {{eggs are}} spherical and yellowish. They are {{laid on the}} leaf blades and stems of grasses. The larvae are spindle shaped, <b>transversely</b> wrinkled, and covered in small tubercles, giving it a rough appearance. Two long brown spines on the head point forward, while a pair of pinkish prongs project from the anal segment. The colour above is rosy red with a blue dorsal and a white lateral line, below which, the underparts are green.|$|E
25|$|In the {{majority}} of flowering plants, the zygote's first division is <b>transversely</b> oriented {{in regards to the}} long axis, and this establishes the polarity of the embryo. The upper or chalazal pole becomes the main area of growth of the embryo, while the lower or micropylar pole produces the stalk-like suspensor that attaches to the micropyle. The suspensor absorbs and manufactures nutrients from the endosperm that are used during the embryo's growth.|$|E
25|$|Before the Primula, all Fiat Group {{passenger}} cars were rear-wheel drive; the larger models followed the classic FR layout (front engine powering the rear axle), and small cars were rear-engined. Meanwhile, a practical concept emerged, namely the front-wheel drive layout {{with the engine}} mounted <b>transversely,</b> which allowed for very efficient space utilization. Although invented by Fiat, it was first popularized by the Mini, it also {{found its way to}} other, bigger models, starting with BMC's Austin/Morris 1100.|$|E
25|$|The Honda Life {{represented}} Honda's {{efforts in}} {{competing in the}} kei car segment, offering sedan, delivery van and small pick-up platforms on a shared chassis. The Life StepVan had a novel approach that, while not initially a commercial success, {{appears to be an}} influence in vehicles with the front passengers sitting behind the engine, a large cargo area with a flat roof and a liftgate installed in back, and utilizing a <b>transversely</b> installed engine with a front-wheel-drive powertrain.|$|E
25|$|Ribbed vaults {{came into}} general {{use in the}} 12th century. In ribbed vaults, not only are there ribs {{spanning}} the vaulted area <b>transversely,</b> but each vaulted bay has diagonal ribs, following the same course as the groins in a groin vault. However, whereas in a groin vault, the vault itself is the structural member, in a ribbed vault, it is the ribs that are the structural members, and the spaces between them can be filled with lighter, non-structural material.|$|E
25|$|Running {{the length}} of the {{northern}} side of the southern garden wall to the east and west of the great gate are galleried arcades. The galleries were used during the rainy season to admit the poor and distribute alms. A raised platform with geometric paving provides a seating for the column bases and between them are cusped arches typical of the Mughul architecture of the period. The galleries terminate at each end with a <b>transversely</b> placed room with tripartite divisions.|$|E
25|$|The left radius {{is damaged}} at its {{proximal}} and distal ends. The radius is gracile, with a midshaft width to length ratio of 0.12. In anterior view, the lateral {{face of the}} shaft is straight, whereas the medial face is concave. The anteroposteriorly expanded proximal end has a prominent ridge on its lateral face. The proximal end has an approximately oval outline with a pointed anterior process and broadly rounded posterior process. The proximomedial margin is nearly straight, whereas the proximolateral margin is concave anteriorly and convex posteriorly. The oval cross-section of the upper shaft gradually transforms into a rounded D-shape at mid-shaft, with the long axis of the cross section extending <b>transversely.</b> This ‘D’ shape becomes more anteriorly compressed towards the distal end, with a <b>transversely</b> rounded anterior face and increasingly flattened posterior face. This {{is associated with the}} strong transverse expansion of the distal shaft and distal end of the bone, as originally described as a twisting of the bone. Strong transverse expansion of the distal radius is normally found only in titanosaurs (e.g., Alamosaurus and Jainosaurus) and is considered a local autapomorphy of Huabeisaurus. Posterolateral ridges are weak to absent along the distal half of the bone and do not extend further proximally.|$|E
25|$|The stark {{difference}} in arm length {{compared to other}} dromaeosaurids implies that {{the function of the}} arms in Tianyuraptor was different from that of other dromaeosaurs. Members of the subfamily Microraptorinae, such as Microraptor, have been suggested to have been aerodynamic and may have glided. Microraptorines are usually noted for their long and robust forelimbs and large, asymmetrical flight feathers. However, the shortened forelimbs, small furcula, and the <b>transversely</b> wide coracoid in Tianyuraptor suggest that it was not suited for aerodynamic gliding or flight.|$|E
