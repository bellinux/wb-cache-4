40|$|AbstractIt {{is known}} that a graded lattice of rank n is supersolvable {{if and only if}} it has an EL-{{labelling}} where the labels along any maximal chain are exactly the numbers 1, 2,…,n without repetition. These labellings are called Sn EL-labellings, and having such a labelling is also equivalent <b>to</b> <b>possessing</b> a maximal chain of left modular elements. In the case of an ungraded lattice, there is a natural extension of Sn EL-labellings, called interpolating labellings. We show that admitting an interpolating labelling is again equivalent <b>to</b> <b>possessing</b> a maximal chain of left modular elements. Furthermore, we work in the setting of an arbitrary bounded poset as all the above results generalize to this case...|$|R
