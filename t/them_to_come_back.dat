25|$|By the 980s {{the kings}} of Wessex had a {{powerful}} grip on the coinage of the realm. It is reckoned there were about 300 moneyers, and 60 mints, around the country. Every {{five or six years}} the coinage in circulation would cease to be legal tender and new coins were issued. The system controlling the currency around the country was extremely sophisticated; this enabled the king to raise large sums of money if needed. The ability to raise large sums of money was needed after the battle of Maldon, as Æthelred decided that, rather than fight, he would pay ransom to the Danes in a system known as Danegeld. As part of the ransom, a peace treaty was drawn up that was intended to stop the raids. However, rather than buying the Vikings off, payment of Danegeld only encouraged <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> for more.|$|E
25|$|By {{the start}} of September, the Royalist {{garrison}} of Southsea Castle consisted of only a dozen men. On the night of 4 September, a Parliamentarian force of 400 infantry equipped with ladders and backed by cavalry set out to attack the castle. Although the force was spotted and fired on by the guns of Portsmouth, {{they were able to}} make to the seaward side of the castle. Simultaneously, a small party approached the main gate and called on the castle to surrender. Captain Challoner was at the time somewhat inebriated and asked <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> in the morning. At around this time, the guns of Portsmouth once more opened fire on the assaulting force, and the Parliamentarians responded by scaling the walls and capturing the castle without further opposition. A significant Parliamentarian garrison was then installed in the castle to keep it from being recaptured.|$|E

25|$|The Portuguese {{initially}} made Hirado {{their preferred}} port of call, {{since it was}} familiar to their wokou partners, although they also visited the ports of Kagoshima, Yamagawa, Hiji, and Funai from time to time. The Jesuits felt that the carrack should take turns visiting each port of Kyushu so the priests could cover more ground and convert more people, but the merchants had other priorities in mind: the carrack had to land at a harbour that protected their valuable cargo from the wind and weather, and a stable port of call was essential to build a reliable clientele. The daimyo of Hirado, Matsura Takanobu, was initially accommodative to the missionaries due to their association with the Portuguese traders, but turned hostile once he felt they overdid their evangelization by burning books and destroying Buddhist images. Matsura Takanobu evicted the missionaries from Hirado in 1558, and did not allow <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> for five years. In 1561, 15 Portuguese were killed in Hirado in a brawl with the Japanese while a captain was also killed in Akune marking the first recorded clashes between Europeans and the Japanese.|$|E

According to author and course participant, Cooke de Herrera, the Beatles were [...] "very happy at {{the way it was}} done". De Herrara wrote in her memoir that the Maharishi gave [...] "special attention" [...] to all the celebrities despite her {{warnings}} not to feed their egos. Mia Farrow wrote that she felt overwhelmed by the Maharishi's attention to her, including private sessions, gifts of mangoes, and a birthday party where he gave her a paper crown. Early the following morning the Maharishi arranged for a group photo and told everyone where to sit. [...] Since it was her birthday the day before, Mia was asked to sit in the centre and each student was adorned with a marigold garland. [...] All sat on a podium and the Maharishi had a large picture of his guru, Brahmananda Saraswati, behind him. The photo took half an hour and has been described as [...] "one of the most iconic photographs in the history of rock 'n' roll". Photographers included Paul Saltzman, a Canadian filmmaker who was visiting the ashram after completing film work elsewhere in India. Saltzman's snapshots from this time were later assembled into a book, The Beatles in India (2000).|$|E

Poniewozik stated that Jim and Pam's fight was [...] "believable in its arc and its parameters" [...] and that both characters were presented in a way in which their plights were understandable. Ally Serrigran of Hollywood.com wrote that the [...] "episode was one worth tuning in for."

Mark Perigard of the Boston Herald commented on the fight between Jim and Pam, writing that it [...] "felt just like the kind of argument that two real people would have." [...] Brett Harrison Davinger of the California Literary Review wrote that the episode was [...] "fine" [...] and was composed of [...] "several small storylines, all of which worked".

Shortly after the invasion of Iraq, he appeared on BBC Breakfast with Frost, speaking to presenter Peter Sissons about his role. He praised the military campaign and went on to talk about the challenges of rebuilding the country, saying [...] "I think in relative terms we are not as badly off as me might have feared", but agreed that there were insufficient [...] "people on the ground" [...] to ensure security {{in the aftermath of the}} invasion and removal of Saddam Hussein's government. He was later deeply critical of the planning made for post-war Iraq, and stated that he attempted to raise the issue of insufficient planning with politicians. However, he was never [...] "overly concerned" [...] by warnings from aid agencies of a massive humanitarian crisis in the aftermath of the invasion which, in the event, never materialised, though he admitted he had been too optimistic about the state of the Iraqi infrastructure. In the Breakfast with Frost interview, he drew an analogy with London, [...] "if you imagine going into London and every Ministry building is completely empty of furniture, completely empty of people, most of the windows blown out, just trying to find the people who work in those Ministries, the equivalent of the Home Office and [...] out who worked there, getting them back to work, beginning to pay their salaries which we're now beginning to do, and encouraging <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>back</b> and work with us is bound to take a bit of time." ...|$|E

2500|$|The letter lambda (Λ), {{standing}} for Laconia or Lacedaemon, which was {{painted on the}} Spartans' shields, was first adopted in the 420s BC, and quickly became a widely known Spartan symbol. Military families passed on their shields to each generation as family heirlooms. The technical evolution and design of Spartan shields evolved from bashing and shield wall tactics, and were of such great importance in the Spartan army that while losing a sword and a spear was an exception, to lose a shield {{was a sign of}} disgrace. Not only does it protect the user, but it also protects the whole phalanx formation. To come home without the shield was the mark of a deserter; rhipsaspia or [...] "dropping the shield", was a synonym for desertion in the field.

[...] While working for General Wesley K.

Following a talent competition win in Windsor, Ontario, in 1960, The Primettes were invited to audition for Motown records.

Later, following local success via live performances at sock hops, etc., Ross approached former neighbor (and rumored childhood former boyfriend), William [...] "Smokey" [...] Robinson, who insisted that the group audition for him first. Robinson agreed to bring The Primettes to Motown, in exchange for letting he and The Miracles hire The Primettes' guitarist, Marv Tarplin, for an upcoming tour. Tarplin played in Robinson's band(s) for the next 30-plus years. In her autobiography, [...] "Secrets of a Sparrow", Ross wrote that she felt that deal was [...] "a fair trade". The Primettes later auditioned for Motown Records, before various Motown executives. In Berry Gordy's autobiography, To Be Loved, Gordy recalled he was heading to a business meeting when he heard Ross singing [...] "There Goes My Baby" [...] and Ross' voice [...] "stopped me in my tracks".
