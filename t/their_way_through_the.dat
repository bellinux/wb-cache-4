5|$|At Lulworth Cove, {{the waves}} have cut <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> {{resistant}} Portland stone {{and created a}} horseshoe-shaped cove by eroding the softer sands and clays behind. Another feature {{of this part of}} the coast is Durdle Door, a natural arch. Sea stacks and pinnacles, such as Old Harry Rocks at Handfast Point, have been formed by erosion of the chalk cliffs.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, the Mongol wings closed around the {{shattered}} Rus' army, cutting off its retreat.

5|$|Although {{the bark}} {{functions}} as a protective barrier, it is itself attacked by boring insects such as beetles. These lay their eggs in crevices and the larvae chew <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> cellulose tissues leaving a gallery of tunnels. This may allow fungal spores to gain admittance and attack the tree. Dutch elm disease {{is caused by a}} fungus (Ophiostoma species) carried from one elm tree to another by various beetles. The tree reacts to the growth of the fungus by blocking off the xylem tissue carrying sap upwards and the branch above, and eventually the whole tree, is deprived of nourishment and dies. In Britain in the 1990s, 25 million elm trees were killed by this disease.|$|E

5|$|Butterflies are {{threatened}} {{in their early}} stages by parasitoids and in all stages by predators, diseases and environmental factors. Braconid and other parasitic wasps lay their eggs in lepidopteran eggs or larvae and the wasps' parasitoid larvae devour their hosts, usually pupating inside or outside the desiccated husk. Most wasps are very specific about their host species and some {{have been used as}} biological controls of pest butterflies like the large white butterfly. When the small cabbage white was accidentally introduced to New Zealand, it had no natural enemies. In order to control it, some pupae that had been parasitised by a chalcid wasp were imported, and natural control was thus regained. Some flies lay their eggs on the outside of caterpillars and the newly hatched fly larvae bore <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> skin and feed in a similar way to the parasitoid wasp larvae. Predators of butterflies include ants, spiders, wasps, and birds.|$|E
5|$|Each {{battery-powered}} vehicle, or AGV, {{is made up}} of two platforms. Riders sit on {{the upper}} platform, which provides three degrees of freedom. A lower platform provides omnidirectional lateral movement. Unlike previous ride designs, the trackless system and the wheel and motor configurations allow movements diagonal to a rider's perspective. The vehicles use a dead reckoning system developed by Frog AGV to navigate <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> environment, allowing a vehicle to cross another's path. Each vehicle features a built-in controller, which wirelessly communicates with a central ride-system controller. Movement commands are issued by the ride-system controller, and executed by the vehicles' controllers. A specially-designed battery and charge system allow the vehicles to be quickly charged while docked at the loading and unloading platforms.|$|E

5|$|Fertilised female wasps {{enter the}} {{receptive}} 'fig' (the syconium) through a tiny {{hole at the}} crown (the ostiole). They crawl around the inflorescenced interior of the fig, pollinating some of the female flowers, before laying eggs inside some of the flowers and dying. After several weeks' development in their galls, the male wasps emerge before the females. They chew holes in the galls containing females and fertilise them through the hole they have just chewed. Males return later to mated females, and enlarge the mating holes to enable the females to emerge. Some males then chew <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> syconium wall, which allows the females to disperse after collecting pollen from the now fully developed male flowers. Females then have a short time (< 48 hours) to find a tree with receptive syconia to successfully reproduce and disperse pollen.|$|E
5|$|Following the Mongol {{invasion}} of Central Asia {{and the subsequent}} collapse of the Khwarezmian Empire, a Mongol force {{under the command of}} generals Jebe and Subutai advanced into Iraq-i Ajam.

While waiting for Genghis Khan's reply, the duo set out on a raid in which they attacked Georgia and killed its king. Genghis Khan granted the duo permission to undertake their expedition, and after making <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> Caucasus, they defeated a coalition of Caucasian tribes before defeating the Cumans.
