5|$|The {{style and}} nature of the vignettes used <b>to</b> <b>illustrate</b> <b>a</b> Book of the Dead varies widely. Some contain lavish colour {{illustration}}s, even making use of gold leaf. Others contain only line drawings, or one simple illustration at the opening.|$|E
5|$|Aware {{that the}} public {{appreciated}} instrumental music with context, Liszt provided written prefaces for nine of his symphonic poems. However, Liszt's view of the symphonic poem tended to be evocative, using music to create a general mood or atmosphere rather than <b>to</b> <b>illustrate</b> <b>a</b> narrative or describe something literally. In this regard, Liszt authority Humphrey Searle suggests {{that he may have}} been closer to his contemporary Hector Berlioz than to many who would follow him in writing symphonic poems.|$|E
5|$|Gil Grissom has a {{more than}} passing {{similarity}} to Sherlock Holmes. Like Holmes, Grissom is dispassionate with a fierce devotion to logic and little regard for societal norms of behavior; Grissom once smashed mustard jars {{in a grocery store}} <b>to</b> <b>illustrate</b> <b>a</b> theory ("I-15 Murders"), much as Holmes once practiced spearing a pig in a butchers to determine how strong a man would have to be to transfix a man with a harpoon.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to religious allusions, the crew used color schemes and camera movements {{to create their}} own themes for the characters. Since the show was told from Clark's point of view, particular visual elements were utilized <b>to</b> <b>illustrate</b> <b>a</b> particular characteristic. When he was safe at home the colors used to illustrate the environment were warm and gentle, with an earth tone, while the camera movement was gentle as well. When Clark was keeping his secret, but there was no danger around, the lighting was more neutral, with greater camera movement. When there was danger, the lighting became colder with more grays and blues, and the camera shifted to a handheld, allowing more extreme angles.|$|E
5|$|Nanako Kato, a {{spokesperson}} from Sony Computer Entertainment, addressed the matter from Tokyo. She {{pointed out that}} historical buildings are often used in entertainment, such as in iconic movie scenes involving Godzilla and the Tokyo Tower and King Kong in Manhattan. She acknowledged {{the church in the}} game holds a resemblance to Manchester Cathedral, but that the point was to depict a backdrop of an old church, not <b>to</b> <b>illustrate</b> <b>a</b> specific church. She added that Sony understands why the Church of England was offended especially because of its efforts to reduce the serious problem of gun violence in Manchester. She did not answer on whether Sony would donate money to the Cathedral's anti-gun program as the Church has demanded. At the time, over 2million copies of the game had been sold.|$|E
5|$|In the {{opinions}} then current at the Royal Academy and among critics, {{the most prestigious}} form of painting was considered history painting, in which an artwork illustrated a story. It was thought that such works enabled British artists to show themselves as equal or even superior to those European artists active at the time, {{as well as to}} the Old Masters. Other forms of painting such as portraiture and landscapes were considered lesser styles, as they did not give the artist as much opportunity <b>to</b> <b>illustrate</b> <b>a</b> story but instead were simply depictions of reality. Nonetheless, even the most eminent artists would often devote time to portrait painting, as portraits were generally commissioned by the subjects or their families, providing a guaranteed source of income to the artist; two of the first three presidents of the Royal Academy (Joshua Reynolds and Sir Thomas Lawrence) had made their names as portrait painters. Owing to a lack of patrons willing to commission history paintings, by the early 19th century history painting in England was in serious decline.|$|E

25|$|This {{problem was}} {{proposed}} by the logician Carl Gustav Hempel in the 1940s <b>to</b> <b>illustrate</b> <b>a</b> contradiction between inductive logic and intuition.|$|E

25|$|Imam Nawawi's Forty Hadith, a brief {{collection}} of forty hadith by {{the founder of}} the Shāfiʿī school, each used <b>to</b> <b>illustrate</b> <b>a</b> fundamental of shariah.|$|E
25|$|On 27 May 2012 the BBC News website used a {{photograph}} taken in Iraq in 2003 <b>to</b> <b>illustrate</b> <b>a</b> massacre which was reported as having {{taken place in}} Syria in 2012.|$|E
25|$|When {{operating}} in the public system, patients are asked to co-pay {{a portion of the}} cost for each type of care that they receive. <b>To</b> <b>illustrate,</b> <b>a</b> patient requiring hospitalization is liable for 20 percent of costs for the first month, and nothing thereafter.|$|E

25|$|The dollar auction is a non-zero sum {{sequential}} game {{designed by}} economist Martin Shubik <b>to</b> <b>illustrate</b> <b>a</b> paradox {{brought about by}} traditional rational choice theory in which players with perfect information in the game are compelled to make an ultimately irrational decision based completely on a sequence of apparently rational choices made throughout the game.|$|E
25|$|Colin draws {{pictures}} with a marker on white poster-sized paper <b>to</b> <b>illustrate</b> <b>a</b> concept to encapsulate his {{opinion about the}} stories of the day. After he draws the pictures, Charissa critiques his drawings and the audience cheers if they like his drawing and jeers or remains silent if their reaction is negative.|$|E
25|$|Dawkins intends {{this example}} <b>to</b> <b>illustrate</b> <b>a</b> common {{misunderstanding}} of evolutionary change, i.e. that DNA sequences or organic compounds such as proteins {{are the result}} of atoms randomly combining to form more complex structures. In these types of computations, any sequence of amino acids in a protein will be extraordinarily improbable (this is known as Hoyle's fallacy). Rather, evolution proceeds by hill climbing, as in adaptive landscapes.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the early}} 1900s, she was {{commissioned}} <b>to</b> <b>illustrate</b> <b>an</b> advertisement for the National Board of the YWCA. The {{title of the}} poster was [...] "The Play's the Thing," [...] and its message was camaraderie and sisterhood.|$|R
30|$|In {{this section}} the {{preliminary}} {{design of a}} coupled wall is developed <b>to</b> <b>illustrate</b> how the estimated yield displacement {{can be used in}} seismic design.

25|$|While Marey's {{scientific}} {{achievements in}} {{the realms of}} cardiology and aerodynamics (as well as pioneering work in photography and chronophotography) are indisputable, Muybridge's efforts were to some degree more artistic rather than scientific. As Muybridge explained, {{in some of his}} published sequences he had substituted images where original exposures had failed, in order <b>to</b> <b>illustrate</b> <b>a</b> representative movement (rather than producing a strictly scientific recording of a particular sequence).|$|E
25|$|Lactarius deliciosus, {{commonly}} known as the saffron milk cap and red pine mushroom, {{is one of the best}} known members of the large milk-cap genus Lactarius in the order Russulales. It is found in Europe and has been accidentally introduced to other countries under conifers and can be found growing in pine plantations. A fresco in the Roman town of Herculaneum appears to depict Lactarius deliciosus and is one of the earliest pieces of art <b>to</b> <b>illustrate</b> <b>a</b> fungus.|$|E
25|$|The parable {{has been}} used <b>to</b> <b>illustrate</b> <b>a</b> range of truths and fallacies; broadly, the parable implies that one's {{subjective}} experience can be true, but that such experience is inherently limited by its failure to account for other truths or a totality of truth. At various times the parable has provided insight into the relativism, opaqueness or inexpressible nature of truth, the behavior of experts in fields {{where there is a}} deficit or inaccessibility of information, the need for communication, and respect for different perspectives.|$|E
5000|$|In adult {{discourse}} {{the phrase}} [...] "connect the dots" [...] {{can be used}} as <b>a</b> metaphor <b>to</b> <b>illustrate</b> <b>an</b> ability (or inability) to associate one idea with another, to find the [...] "big picture", or salient feature, in a mass of data.|$|R
40|$|An {{analytical}} {{investigation of}} a swept-forward high-aspect-ratio graphite-epoxy transport wing is described.
