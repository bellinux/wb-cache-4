50|$|Instead of panniers, some riders {{prefer a}} bicycle trailer. Trailers {{are easy to}} use and allow touring with bikes on which it is {{impossible}} to attach racks. However, double <b>wheeled</b> <b>trailers</b> decrease maneuverability and are not particularly suited for touring in mountainous regions or on rugged terrain. On the other hand, single <b>wheel</b> <b>trailers</b> are extremely maneuverable, with the <b>trailer</b> <b>wheel</b> tracking very closely with the rear wheel. These can easily be ridden on single track trails (about 40 cm width), over some very technical terrain.|$|R

50|$|A {{side dump}} truck (SDT) {{consists}} of a 3-axle tractor pulling a 2-axle semi-trailer. It has hydraulic rams which tilt the dump body onto its side, spilling the material to either {{the left or right}} side of the trailer. The key advantages of the side dump are that it allows rapid unloading and can carry more weight in the western United States. In addition, it is almost immune to upset (tipping over) while dumping, unlike the semi end dumps which are very prone to tipping over. It is, however, highly likely that a side dump trailer will tip over if dumping is stopped prematurely. Also, when dumping loose materials or cobble sized stone, the side dump can become stuck if the pile becomes wide enough to cover too much of the <b>trailer's</b> <b>wheels.</b> <b>Trailers</b> that dump at the appropriate angle (50° for example) avoid the problem of the dumped load fouling the path of the <b>trailer</b> <b>wheels</b> by dumping their loads further {{to the side of the}} truck, in some cases leaving sufficient clearance to walk between the dumped load and the trailer.|$|R

40|$|Wheel {{detachment}} from plant trailers used on public highways represents a significant {{health and safety}} hazard and major financial risk, especially for construction and utility companies that rely on these type of trailers to transport machinery such as mini excavators or road rollers. This study uncovers the antecedents of plant <b>trailer</b> <b>wheel</b> detachment and suggests pragmatic guidance for mitigating this risk. A case study using elements of action research studies {{the problem in the}} field through direct observation and stakeholder interviews. Analysis of resulting qualitative data conceptualizes antecedents on which guidance is formulated. Risks are found to result from a combination of physical failure underpinned by inadequate human interventions and poor risk management. The primary contributions of the study are that it describes entirely novel research on <b>trailer</b> <b>wheel</b> detachment, produces new safety guidance for businesses and practitioners that operate plant trailers, and resultantly contributes to lowering the risks identified.

40|$|With {{the goal}} of {{understanding}} how to mitigate the safety hazard of splash and spray around heavy vehicles, a computational study of the aerodynamics and spray dispersion about a simplified <b>trailer</b> <b>wheel</b> assembly has been completed. A tandem dual slick (TDS) wheel model that neglects complex geometric features such as brakes, wheel bolts and wheel cutouts but with the same dimensions as an actual <b>trailer</b> <b>wheel</b> assembly was used. A detailed simulation of the wheels alone demonstrated that the flow field is both unsteady and complex, containing a number of vortical structures that interact strongly with spray. Preliminary simulations with fenders and fairings demonstrated that these devices prevent the ballistic transport of drops larger than approximately 0. 1 mm, but the fine mist speculated {{to be responsible for}} visibility reduction is unaffected. This work suggests that to use computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to design and evaluate spray mitigation strategies the jet or sheet breakup processes can be modeled using an array of injectors of small (< 0. 01 mm) water droplets; however the choice of size distribution, injection locations, directions and velocities is largely unknown and requires further study. Possible containment strategies would include using flow structures to 'focus' particles into regions away from passing cars or surface treatments to capture small drops...|$|R

50|$|Already in 1934 {{it became}} obvious that Renault had been right in advising to select a {{different}} suspension type. The standard one proved to be much too flimsy and especially the oil shock dampers were very maintenance intensive. Both the three vehicles built in 1935 and the two rebuilt prototypes were therefore fitted with an improved AMR 35 suspension type with rubber cylinders. Prototype 79758 had been used to test three different systems: the first with the <b>trailer</b> <b>wheel</b> touching the ground, the second with five road wheels and the last was the one selected. The second type would form the basis for the Renault ZB, a lengthened export version, destined for China.|$|R

50|$|An {{articulated}} dumper is an all-wheel drive, off-road dump truck. It has a hinge {{between the}} cab and the dump box, but is distinct from a semi-trailer truck in that the power unit is a permanent fixture, not a separable vehicle. Steering is accomplished via hydraulic cylinders that pivot the entire tractor {{in relation to the}} trailer, rather than rack and pinion steering on the front axle as in a conventional dump truck. By this way of steering, the <b>trailers</b> <b>wheels</b> follow the same path as the front wheels. Together with all-wheel drive and low center of gravity, it is highly adaptable to rough terrain. Major manufacturers include Volvo CE, Terex, John Deere and Caterpillar.|$|R

40|$|The paper {{considers}} {{an important}} problem in improvement of  braking dynamics potential {{as part of}} the overall tractor train dynamics consisting of   an all-wheel drive tractor and heavy-duty trailers which are either locally manufactured or developed with the participation of the paper’s authors. The trailers have a mechanical drive for their wheels from the tractor engine. The trains are intended for transportation peat, organic fertilizers and various loads in  forest exploitation and under other complicated soil and climatic and road conditions where there is justified necessity to activate the <b>trailer</b> <b>wheels.</b> Methodological tools have been developed with the purpose to analyze an influence of the blocked inter-double-reduction axle drive of an active tractor train on distribution of braking forces in double-reduction axles with due account of the heavy-duty peat trailer specificity. Theoretical provisions for wheeled vehicles have been developed with regard to the braking application specificity of active tractor trains with mechanical multi-path drive for wheels of a multi-double-reduction axle propulsion device. The paper presents calculation and theoretical data in order to estimate  distribution of specific braking forces in the double-reduction axle links of the active tractor train when the blocked inter-double-reduction axle drive of the tractor and <b>trailer</b> <b>wheels</b> is switched on and also in the case when the tractor engine is involved in braking process and a clutch coupling is switched-on. Sequence of the calculation formula has been completely carried out in the paper. They represent clear design and operational parameters of the active tractor train. Such approach has made it possible to realize them {{in the form of a}} software application which is convenient for analysis of the braking process pertaining to the investigated objects in order to select means for improvement of braking dynamics, rational parameters of multi-path wheel drive and tire completing of the active tractor train under design. The proposed information has a theoretical and practical value for specialists who are involved in development of new machine-tractor units for transport application in peat extraction, forestry, and agriculture. </p...|$|R
