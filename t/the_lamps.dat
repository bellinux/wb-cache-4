5|$|The second version, with blue-green filters {{over the}} projectors, was trialled {{on board the}} {{corvette}} HMCS Chambly in May 1941. This gave better results as the filters removed the reddish bias to <b>the</b> <b>lamps</b> when at low intensity (lower colour temperature). The supports too were retractable, so the delicate projectors could be stowed away for protection when not in use. This second version reduced Chambly's visibility by 50% in most conditions, and sometimes {{by as much as}} 75%. This was enough to justify development of a more robust version.|$|E
5|$|Hess died on 17 August 1987 {{at the age}} of 93 in {{a summer}} house that had been set up in the prison garden as a reading room. He took an {{extension}} cord from one of <b>the</b> <b>lamps,</b> strung it over a window latch, and hanged himself. Death occurred by asphyxiation. A short note to his family, thanking them for all they had done, was found in his pocket. The Four Powers released a statement on 17 September ruling the death a suicide. Initially buried at a secret location to avoid media attention or demonstrations by Nazi sympathisers, Hess was re-interred in a family plot at Wunsiedel on 17 March 1988, and his wife was buried beside him when she died in 1995. Spandau Prison was demolished to prevent it from becoming a neo-Nazi shrine.|$|E

5|$|In 1900, {{ownership}} of the gatehouse was transferred from Henry Somerset, 9th Duke of Beaufort to Monmouthshire County Council {{as part of the}} disposal of the entirety of the Somersets' land holdings in Monmouthshire. The gift is recorded on a brass plaque attached to the gatehouse. The local antiquarian Mary Ellen Bagnall-Oakeley wrote the first history of the bridge and gatehouse, Monnow Bridge Tower, which appeared in 1903. In April 1893, the first street light had been erected on the bridge by the town council. In the late 1920s, the top portion of this light was replaced by twin electric lamps. In the 1960s, <b>the</b> <b>lamps</b> were removed completely, and since 1991 the bridge has been floodlit.|$|E
5|$|During the 1980s these battleships {{made use}} of the RQ-2 Pioneer, an {{unmanned}} aerial vehicle employed in spotting for the guns. Launched from the fantail using a rocket-assist booster that was discarded shortly after takeoff, the Pioneer carried a video camera in a pod under {{the belly of the}} aircraft which transmitted live video to the ship so operators could observe enemy actions or fall of shot during naval gunnery. To land the UAV a large net was deployed {{at the back of the}} ship; the aircraft was flown into it. Missouri and Wisconsin both used the Pioneer UAVs successfully during Operation Desert Storm, and in one particularly memorable incident, a Pioneer UAV operated by Wisconsin received the surrender of Iraqi troops during combat operations. This particular Pioneer was later donated to the Smithsonian Institution, and is now on public display. During Operation Desert Storm these Pioneers were operated by detachments of VC-6. In addition to the Pioneer UAVs, the recommissioned Iowas could support six types of helicopters: the Sikorsky HO3S-1, UH-1 Iroquois, SH-2 Seasprites, CH-46 Sea Knight, CH-53 Sea Stallion and <b>the</b> <b>LAMPS</b> III SH-60B Seahawk.|$|E
5|$|This Case further {{represented}} {{the development of}} the incandescent electric light bulb from the fundamental steps shown in Case #1. These electric lamps were from worldwide inventors that worked directly with Edison on ideas. The electric light bulbs were grouped chronologically from 1881 to 1904. Among these were some Diehl's induction lamps for use with alternating current. A description of how this technology worked is that of a secondary coil of wire was placed inside the bulb of a vacuum. The two ends of the coiled wire connected to the filament that was electrified and provided the light. A primary coil was wound {{on the outside of the}} glass bulb. This coil was connected to an alternating current electrical power supply. The secondary coil inside the bulb would receive this alternating magnetism from the primary coil and provide an electrical current that electrified the inside filament. Ultimately this type of alternating current technology never developed and was not used. Pictures of some of <b>the</b> <b>lamps</b> that were in this display are below. These were later numbered 358 to 536.|$|E
50|$|The {{lifetime}} of a flashtube depends {{on both the}} energy level used for <b>the</b> <b>lamp</b> in proportion to its explosion energy, and on the pulse duration of <b>the</b> <b>lamp.</b> Failures can be catastrophic, causing <b>the</b> <b>lamp</b> to shatter, or they can be gradual, reducing the performance of <b>the</b> <b>lamp</b> below a usable rating.|$|R
50|$|When <b>the</b> <b>lamp</b> sustains <b>the</b> arc, the ballast {{performs}} {{its second}} function, {{to limit the}} current to that needed to operate <b>the</b> <b>lamp.</b> <b>The</b> <b>lamp,</b> ballast and igniter are rated matched to each other; these parts must be replaced with the same rating as the failed component or <b>the</b> <b>lamp</b> will not work.|$|R
40|$|A simple design {{method has}} been {{developed}} to investigate the dimming control of electronic ballast circuits for fluorescent lamps. This method {{is based on the}} steady-state calculation of the ballast at resonant frequency, f 0, and the inherent characteristics of <b>the</b> fluorescent <b>lamp,</b> i. e. <b>the</b> relationship between <b>the</b> <b>lamp</b> resistance and <b>the</b> <b>lamp</b> power. <b>The</b> inherent <b>lamp</b> characteristics encompass <b>the</b> fact that the voltage across <b>the</b> <b>lamp</b> varies with <b>the</b> <b>lamp</b> power. Including this inherent characteristic into a new lamp Spice simulation model can provide an accurate simulation result of the relations between the ballast operation frequency and <b>the</b> <b>lamp</b> power...|$|R
25|$|Prior to firing, the Nd:glass {{amplifiers}} {{are first}} pumped {{with a series}} of Xenon flash lamps surrounding them. Some of the light produced by <b>the</b> <b>lamps</b> is captured in the glass, leading to a population inversion that allows for amplification via stimulated emission. This process is quite inefficient, and only about 1 to 1.5% of the power fed into <b>the</b> <b>lamps</b> is actually turned into laser energy. In order to produce the sort of laser power required for Nova, <b>the</b> <b>lamps</b> had to be very large, fed power from a large bank of capacitors located under the laser bay. The flash also generates a large amount of heat which distorts the glass, requiring time for <b>the</b> <b>lamps</b> and glass to cool before they can be fired again. This limits Nova to about six firings a day at the maximum.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the older}} style (but still most popular) [...] "choke ballast", {{each end of}} <b>the</b> <b>lamp</b> has its own cathode and anode, however, once <b>the</b> <b>lamp</b> has started, <b>the</b> plasma flows {{from one end of}} <b>the</b> <b>lamp</b> to <b>the</b> other, with each end acting as a single cathode or anode. The starter is a plasma switch itself, and {{temporarily}} connects the cathode on one end of <b>the</b> <b>lamp</b> to <b>the</b> anode {{on the other end of}} <b>the</b> <b>lamp,</b> causing <b>the</b> <b>lamp</b> ends to heat up quickly, or [...] "preheat".

5000|$|For xenon arc <b>lamps,</b> during start-up, <b>the</b> <b>lamp</b> is ignited by a 5-20-kilovolt pulse from a current-regulating ballast to {{initiate}} an arc between two electrodes in the quartz tube.

As <b>the</b> <b>lamp</b> ages, <b>the</b> arc tube's electrodes wear out and light output declines somewhat, while waste heating of <b>the</b> <b>lamp</b> increases. <b>The</b> <b>lamp's</b> end of life is typically indicated by an LED on the unit or an onscreen text warning, necessitating replacement of <b>the</b> <b>lamp</b> unit.|$|R
25|$|In UVGI systems <b>the</b> <b>lamps</b> are {{shielded}} {{or are in}} {{environments that}} limit exposure, such as a closed water tank or closed air circulation system, often with interlocks that automatically shut off the UV lamps if the system is opened for access by humans.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a dynamic model for HID lamps; {{the model is}} based on thermal and electric principles, and it includes the plasma characteristics.

This capacitors and resistors represent the thermal behavior of <b>the</b> <b>lamp</b> and can be used to predict the dynamic of <b>the</b> <b>lamp</b> and its stability. The proposed model emulates the effects of the filling gas, the arc tube, the partial vacuum, and the outer bulb. This model is used to emulate <b>the</b> <b>lamp</b> behavior when <b>the</b> <b>lamp</b> is fed with square waveforms. This model can be implemented in software as "PSpice", "Simnon" or "MATLAB"...|$|R

25|$|One folk belief {{concerning}} the bakeneko {{is that they}} would lick the oil of oriental lamps, and in the Edo period encyclopedia, the Wakan Sansai Zue, {{it is said that}} for a cat to lick this oil is an omen of some strange event about to occur. People in the early modern period used cheap oils from fish, like sardine oil, in <b>the</b> <b>lamps,</b> and that could explain why cats would want to lick them. Also, the diet of Japanese people at that time was based mainly on grains and vegetables, and the leftovers would be fed to the cats. However, since cats are carnivores, such a diet would have been lacking in protein and fat, and therefore they would have been even more attracted to the oil in <b>the</b> <b>lamps.</b> Furthermore, the sight of a cat standing up its hind legs to reach the lamp, with its face lit up and eyes round with anticipation, could have seemed eerie and unnatural, like a yōkai.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "emission mix" [...] on <b>the</b> <b>lamp</b> filaments/cathodes is {{required}} to enable electrons to pass into the gas via thermionic emission at <b>the</b> <b>lamp</b> operating voltages used. The mix is slowly sputtered off by bombardment with electrons and mercury ions during operation, but a larger amount is sputtered off each time <b>the</b> <b>lamp</b> is started with cold cathodes. The method of starting <b>the</b> <b>lamp</b> has {{a significant impact on}} this. Lamps operated for typically less than 3 hours each switch-on will normally run out of the emission mix before other parts of <b>the</b> <b>lamp</b> fail. <b>The</b> sputtered emission mix forms the dark marks at <b>the</b> <b>lamp</b> ends seen in old <b>lamps.</b> When all <b>the</b> emission mix is gone, the cathode cannot pass sufficient electrons into the gas fill to maintain the gas discharge at <b>the</b> designed <b>lamp</b> operating voltage. Ideally, the control gear should shut down <b>the</b> <b>lamp</b> when this happens. However, some control gear will provide sufficient increased voltage to continue operating <b>the</b> <b>lamp</b> in cold cathode mode, which will cause overheating of <b>the</b> <b>lamp</b> end and rapid disintegration of the electrodes (filament goes open-circuit) and filament support wires until they are completely gone or the glass cracks, destroying the low pressure gas fill and stopping the gas discharge.|$|R

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>lamp</b> {{was invented}} by the French watchmaker Bernard Guillaume Carcel (1750-1818) to {{overcome}} the disadvantages of <b>the</b> Argand-type <b>lamps</b> then in use. The vegetable - mostly colza - oils then available were thick and would not travel far up a wick. <b>The</b> Argand <b>lamps</b> used a gravity feed which meant that the oil reservoir was located above the burner, casting a shadow and making <b>the</b> <b>lamp</b> top heavy. Carcel designed a <b>lamp</b> with <b>the</b> oil reservoir under the burner, {{in the body of}} <b>the</b> <b>lamp.</b> To keep <b>the</b> oil moving up to the burner, Carcel housed a clockwork mechanism in <b>the</b> <b>lamp</b> base that drove a small pump submerged in the oil tank.
