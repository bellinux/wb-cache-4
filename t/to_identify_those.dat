5|$|The {{species has}} not yet been well defined in their areas of roosting. Some have even been found to roost in caves and {{possibly}} housing, though whether this is typical behavior or an effect of displacement is uncertain. Tracking the species by radio signals, {{it was found that the}} species prefers older, larger trees, specifically beeches, perhaps due to possessing relatively spacious trunks and branches, allowing for ease of entry. The species does not have one specific roost, but a network through which the colony can rotate individuals. Recent years have seen less reliance on fossil fuels and rather relying on wood as a source of energy, and consequently an increase in logging, therefore it is important to locate the areas in which they roosts <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> <b>those</b> which should be protected to prevent their decline, through which radio tracking proves an effective method.|$|E

40|$|The {{majority}} of the Asian countries involved in the Strategies to Prevent Suicide (STOPS) project have adopted novel approaches <b>to</b> <b>identifying</b> <b>those</b> at heightened risk of suicide, {{with a view to}} encouraging them to seek help. These approaches include: screening and detection programmes in mental health and suicide prevention services, and identification programmes conducted in the community or by schools, welfare agencies or other non-medical organizations. These approaches appear to have potential as suicide prevention strategies, but their effectiveness may be limited in communities where lack of mental health services or intense stigma about using mental health services makes it unlikely that identified individuals will seek professional help. Further evaluation is necessary before definitive conclusions about the benefit of these innovative identification programmes can be drawn. Need for innovation Help-seeking behaviour among suicidal individuals in Asia is generally limited. Although around half of those who die by suicide communicate with friends and family about their intention to die, few seek any sort of professional help (Barnes et al., 2001; Hong Kong Centre for Suicide Research and Prevention, 2005). For this reason, innovative approaches <b>to</b> <b>identifying</b> <b>those</b> at risk of suicide and bringing them to the attention of professionals who can help them may be valuable in saving lives. These professionals {{may or may not be}} specialist mental health care providers; in under-resourced countries with few mental health professionals there will need to be a heavy reliance on trained professionals and volunteers from allied sectors. The current chapter describes some of the innovative approaches <b>to</b> <b>identifying</b> <b>those</b> at risk of suicide that are currently being undertaken by the Asian countries involved in the Strategies to Prevent Suicide (STOPS) project. The focus is on novel approaches to detecting those at risk rather than on the direct provision of specialist care, though the immediate support and referral pathways provided once those at high risk have been identified are also discussed. 63 SUICIDE AND SUICIDE PREVENTION IN ASI...|$|R

25|$|Societies in Islam have {{recognized}} “both erotic attraction and sexual behavior {{between members of}} the same sex.” However, their attitudes about them have often been contradictory: “severe religious and legal sanctions” against homosexual behavior {{and at the same time}} “celebratory expressions” of erotic attraction. Homoeroticism was idealized in the form of poetry or artistic declarations of love from one man to another. Accordingly, the Arabic language had an appreciable vocabulary of homoerotic terms, with a dozens of word just to describe types of male prostitutes.

25|$|Micrometer {{measurements}} of the positions of stars in clusters were made as early as 1877 by the German astronomer E. Schönfeld and further pursued by the American astronomer E. E. Barnard prior to his death in 1923. No indication of stellar motion was detected by these efforts. However, in 1918 the Dutch-American astronomer Adriaan van Maanen was able to measure the proper motion of stars in part of the Pleiades cluster by comparing photographic plates taken at different times. As astrometry became more accurate, cluster stars were found to share a common proper motion through space. By comparing the photographic plates of the Pleiades cluster taken in 1918 with images taken in 1943, van Maanen was able <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> <b>those</b> stars that had a proper motion similar to the mean motion of the cluster, and were therefore {{more likely to be}} members.

The CBC is not subject to any conditions or expectations concerning its LRRP. The CBC noted that Première Chaîne (now Ici Radio-Canada Première) and CBC Radio One were available to about 99 percent of the Canadian population. The CBC stated that it plans to maintain its radio service but has no plans to grow the coverage area. It described the LRRP as a planning vehicle and indicated that it would no longer use it. Given reductions in public funding to the CBC and given that Première Chaîne and Radio One are available to the vast majority of Canadians, the commission considers that the CBC's plan to maintain current coverage and discontinue the LRRP is reasonable. Accordingly, the Commission accepts the CBC's proposal to discontinue the LRRP.|$|E
