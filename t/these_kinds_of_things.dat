500|$|Made-up stories did not {{exclusively}} comprise Animaniacs writing, as Hastings remarked: [...] "We weren't really there to tell compelling stories... {{you could do}} a real story, you could recite the Star-Spangled Banner, or you could parody a commercial... you could do all <b>these</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>things,</b> and we had this tremendous freedom and a talent to back it up." [...] Writers for the series wrote into Animaniacs stories that happened to them; the episodes [...] "Ups and Downs," [...] "Survey Ladies," [...] and [...] "I Got Yer Can" [...] were episodes based on true stories that happened to Rugg, Deanna Oliver, and Stoner, respectively. Another episode, [...] "Bumbie's Mom," [...] both parodied the film Bambi and was a story based on Stoner's childhood reaction to the film.|$|E

I {{think one of the}} times I felt the parallels was when I was writing about the arrest of Stan Shunpike, you know? I always planned that <b>these</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> would happen, but these have very powerful resonances, given that I believe, and many people believe, that there have been instances of persecution of people who did not deserve to be persecuted, even while we're attempting to find the people who have committed utter atrocities. These things just happen, it's human nature. There were some very startling parallels at the time I was writing it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Both Akiva and the [...] "Ishmaelic Akher" [...] traded {{upon the}} [...] "two-thrones"/"two-powers"-in-Heaven motif in their {{respective}} Merkabah-oriented undertakings. Akiva's version is memorialized in the Babylonian Gemara to tractate Hagigah at 14a-ii wherein Akiva puts forth the pairing of God and [...] "David" [...] in a messianic version of that mystical motif. Immediately after this Akivian [...] "solution" [...] to the puzzle of thrones referred to in Song of Songs and the two thrones spoken of in Daniel, Chapter , the text presents Akiva as being pressured—and then acquiescing to—a domesticated version of this twoness theme for the single Jewish God which would be acceptable to Rabbinic officialdom. The text offers Justice [...] and Charity [...] as the middot of God which are enthroned in Heaven. [...] Akher's non-Messianic and Metatron-oriented version of this [...] "two-thrones"/"two-powers"-in-Heaven motif is discussed at length in the entry [...] "Paradigmatia" [...] of the above-mentioned study. The generic point {{in all of this}} is that by the time of the final editing of the Mishna this whole motif (along with other dimensions of Merkabah-oriented study and practice) came to be severely discouraged by Rabbinic officialdom. Those who still pursued <b>these</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> were marginalized by the Rabbinic Movement over the next several centuries becoming, in effect, a separate grouping responsible for the Hekhalot literature.|$|E

2500|$|Using English {{words in}} daily conversation, advertising, and {{entertainment}} {{is seen as}} trendy and cool. However this use can often lead to misunderstandings due to problems with pronunciation, grammar or vocabulary. Modern use of Konglish has already created a linguistic divide between North Korea and South Korea. North Korean defectors can have trouble integrating into South Korean society {{because much of the}} Konglish used there is not used in North Korea. This can lead to confusion, misunderstandings and delay integration into the society. This is not the sole cause of the linguistic divide between the two nations as some Korean words are also used differently between the two countries. While Konglish problems exist between the North and South they also exist between the metropolitan and rural. Ahn Jung-hyo a Korean-English translator who is the author of [...] "A False English Dictionary" [...] was noted for saying that improper use of Konglish in other countries is likely to bring shame to Korea. However, John Huer, a columnist for Korea Times, noted Konglish usage as one of his [...] "10 Most Wonderful Things About Korea". He felt that it was both inventive and clever. After that article Huer criticized Koreans for their bad English and improper use of loanwords, though. Modern Konglish usage could even be viewed as art, yet {{there is a difference between}} a cultural use of a word like [...] "Fighting!" [...] and the bad grammar and vocabulary seen on signs, packages, and TV around Korea. Sebastian Harrisan has suggested that calling <b>these</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> Konglish masks the problem with English education in Korea. The Korean government has been criticized by civic groups for their use of Konglish in slogans and focusing too much on English education. They feel that the heavy focus on English will damage the Korean language and doesn't benefit international competitiveness. In contrast, Jasper Kim, a law professor at Ewha Womans University, wrote that Konglish is necessary in a global context and that strict adherence to grammatical rules shouldn't trump getting the message across.|$|E
