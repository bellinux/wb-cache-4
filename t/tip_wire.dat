50|$|When simple {{on-premises}} wiring is color-coded, two-wire telephone plugs or {{the first}} pair of a multi-pair connector commonly have the <b>tip</b> <b>wire</b> coded green and ring coded red. In four wire plugs, the second pair has black tip and yellow ring. A third pair consists of white tip and blue ring. For larger cable assemblies more complex schemes such as the 25-pair color code are used.|$|E
50|$|Circuit pairs are {{connected}} to the block with a punch-down tool by terminating the <b>tip</b> <b>wire</b> on the leftmost slot of one row and ring wire on the leftmost slot of the row beneath the mating <b>tip</b> <b>wire.</b> Typically, a 25-pair cable coming from the phone company is punched down {{on the left side of}} the block in pairs. The right hand side of the block is wired to the customer premises equipment with jumper wires. Bridging clips are used to connect the two center terminals, connecting the left-hand side of a split block with its right-hand side, thus completing the circuit. The clips form the point of interface between the subscriber and the provider. The bridging clips can be easily removed by either the subscriber or phone company personnel for trouble isolation, allowing the ability to split a circuit and determine in which direction trouble may exist. An orange insulating cover attached to a 66 block denotes its designation as a demarcation point by the local exchange carrier.|$|E

50|$|The {{telephone}} company maintains large battery systems that supply DC line voltage {{for the operation}} of analog telephone service at customer locations. The voltage supplied is a compromise between operational needs for reliable service and safety precautions for customers and service personnel. The length of the line to a customer telephone interface presents a resistance across which the central office voltage experiences a drop and therefore the voltage at the customer site may vary. The nominal battery (system) voltage is 52.1 V, based on a 24-cell lead-acid battery. The voltage at a subscriber's network interface is typically 48 V between the ring and <b>tip</b> <b>wires.</b>|$|R
50|$|The sensor has a {{much higher}} {{stiffness}} than silicon microcantilevers, ~1800 N/m (tip placement further down the tine can lead to higher stiffness’s ~2600 N/m). This higher stiffness allows higher forces before snap to contact instabilities. The resonant frequency of a qPlus sensor is typically {{lower than that of}} a silicon microcantilever, ~25 kHz (Watch tuning forks have a resonant frequency of 32,768 kHz before tip placement). Several factors (in particular detector noise and eigenfrequency) affect the speed of operation. qPlus sensors with long <b>tip</b> <b>wires</b> that approach the length of the sensor display a movement of the apex which is no longer perpendicular to the surface, thus probing the forces in a different direction to expected.|$|R
5000|$|As the {{tungsten}} <b>tip</b> <b>wire</b> is conductive, {{the sensor}} {{can be used}} for combined STM/nc-AFM operation. The tip can either be electrically connected to one of tuning fork electrodes, or to a separate thin (~30μm diameter) gold wire. The advantage of the separate wire is that it can reduce cross-talk between the tunnel current and the deflection channels, however the wire will have its own resonance, which can affect the resonant properties of the sensor. New versions of the qPlus sensor with one or several integrated service electrodes as proposed in reference [...] solve that problem. The Bergman reaction has recently been imaged by the IBM group in Zurich using such a qPlus sensor with integrated STM electroce.|$|E
40|$|In this thesis, two {{important}} heat transfer processes with electronic packaging applications [...] plasma arc discharge heat transfer and phase-change heat transfer are studied by numerical simulation and experimental methods. With plasma arc discharge heat transfer, the conservation equations for charged particle densities, electron temperature and Poisson 2 ̆ 7 s equation for the self-consistent electric field are solved simultaneously {{taking into account}} the potential drop in the gap during the discharge. The current flux and the heat flux to the wire are calculated. With phase change heat transfer, the heating and melting processes of the wire electrode during the ball formation process are simulated. These studies have direct applications in the manufacturing of semiconductor packaging equipment. ^ Several design aspects of the wire-bonding process will also be studied. Various designs for an auxiliary wand electrode used in the discharge will be studied by comparing the initial electric field intensity {{at the onset of the}} electronic flame off (EFO) discharge. The design improvement of a fine-pitch capillary is also proposed by considering the smallest symmetric ball size which can be formed from a bent <b>tip</b> <b>wire.</b> ^ A wide spectrum of numerical and experimental techniques are used as part of this research. Numerical methods including finite difference, control volume, finite element, and boundary element methods are employed in the research as well as CFD packages such as FIDAP and ANSYS. Laboratory studies required electronic data recording by high speed digital memory oscilloscopes, chemical etching, and SEM examination of the ball and wire samples. ^ The numerical results obtained from the arc discharge simulation and the ball formation simulation are in good agreement with experimental data. The current and heat flux to the wire obtained from the arc discharge simulation are close to the findings of the experiments. The calculations of ball size and temperature distribution along the wire from the ball formation simulation agreed very well with experimental data. This is shown by examining the ball size and grain structure of the wire which has gone through the heating and cooling process. ...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION The {{effect of}} {{atherosclerosis}} {{is well documented}} and many procedures such as balloon angioplasty and stentimplantation {{have been developed to}} reopen occluded arteries. However, there are considerable differences in the material properties of various atherosclerotic lesions as they develop. Many authors have suggested that rigid calcified plaques may require specific procedures that target this rigid material through de-bulking or complete removal (Salunke et al, 1997). Ultrasound angioplasty is the delivery of high power low frequency ultrasound via a wire waveguide to the lesion location. This results in distal <b>tip</b> <b>wire</b> displacements of up to 100 um peak-to-peak (p-p) at frequencies of between 20 - 45 kHz (Atar, 1999 and Yock, 1997). Ultrasound angioplasty was shown to be effective in the ablation of fibrous and calcified blockages in arteries (Siegel, 1993). At the displacements and frequencies mentioned the pressure field developed can produce disruptive cavitations around the distal tip (Gavin et al, 2004). The principal objective {{of this study was to}} develop an ultrasound angioplasty device and investigate its performance characteristics both experimentally and numerically. MATERIALS AND METHODS Ultrasound was generated by a piezoelectric transducer driven by an ultrasonic generator. The ultrasonic generator drives the transducer at its resonant frequency, in the case of the present device, 22. 5 kHz with output displacements of between 3 - 18 um (p-p). This output was passed into an acoustic horn with a wire waveguide attached to the distal end. These amplify the displacement characteristics and the waveguide has a working flexibility similar to present balloon catheters and a working length of approximately 500 mm. The wire waveguide was ensheathed in a catheter with the distal end of the wire protruding at the tip. The output (p-p) displacements at the distal end of the wire waveguide were measured using an optical microscope with video acquisition and measurement. The characteristics of the system along the length of the wire waveguide have also been numerically simulated using FEA RESULTS The output displacement characteristics of the wire waveguide showed achievable peak-to-peak output displacements of 15 - 90 um (p-p) at 22. 5 kHz. Fig. 1 shows an image obtained by the optical measurement system of the distal tip of a 1 mm wire waveguide subjected to ultrasonic energy. DISCUSSION This initial testing of tip displacements has proved promising and the comparison of the FEA and experimental results has shown good agreement. Future studies involve identifying cavitations and testing is to be carried out on various materials that simulate plaque with a focus on rigid calcified lesions...|$|E

40|$|ObjectivesTo {{investigate}} the {{factors related to}} the successful computed tomography–guided nodule localization for subsequent nodule excision. MethodsWe retrospectively reviewed the medical records for 181 patients who had undergone computed tomography–guided nodule localization using hook wire and subsequent video-assisted thoracic surgery resection for lung nodules. The demographic factors, nodule factors, and technical factors were reviewed to determine what affects effective nodule localization for video-assisted thoracic surgery resection using both univariate and multivariate models. ResultsA total of 174 patients were included in our study. Successful localization was accomplished in 166 patients (95 %). Univariate analysis implicated patient age, nodule solidity, zonal location, and a sufficient distance between the hook <b>wire</b> <b>tip</b> and pleural surface as significant factors for successful localization. Multivariate analysis focused on {{the distance between the}} <b>wire</b> <b>tip</b> and pleural surface as the sole independent factor for successful localization (P = . 012).

40|$|Aim: There {{is a risk}} of {{iatrogenic}} {{injury to}} the soft tissues of the calcaneus and this study assesses the risk of injury to these structures in circular frame calcaneal fracture fixation. Materials and Methods: After olive <b>tip</b> <b>wires</b> were inserted, an L-shaped incision on the lateral and medial aspects of 5 formalin fixed cadaveric feet was performed to expose the underlying soft tissues. The calcaneus was divided into zones corresponding to high, medium and low risk using a grading system.

Soft tissue structures on the lateral side that were shown to be at lower risk of injury were the small saphenous vein and the sural nerve and the tendons of fibularis longus and fibularis brevis. Conclusion: The lateral surface of the calcaneus provides a lower risk area for external fixation.

Also {{there is a significant}} amount of ongoing research on selective and sensitive optical nanosensors of biological agents. In this context, the current emerging trend in nanoscale research is: controlled synthesis with well-defined sizes and geometries; unravelling their fundamental physical properties and assembly of these nanoscale building blocks into functional devices. The growth of nanoscale tips by conventional vapor transport and condensation processes is explained by either catalyst-assisted Vapor–Liquid–Solid (VLS) or catalyst-free Vapor–Solid (VS) growth mechanisms [1 – 5]. Ultrafast laser nanostructuring techniques offer advantages of high resolution, high throughput, uniformity, localized heating, simplicity and reproducibility [6 – 9]. The time scales of heating and cooling of materials with femtosecond laser irradiation are significantly shorter than in the traditional thermal processes [10]. The rapid absorption of energy leads to efficient material removal before significant heat diffusion to the substrate occurs. Femtosecond laser radiation is used to fabricate nano-sized spikes of semiconductor [11], metallic [12, 13] and dielectric surfaces [14], glass nanofibers [15] and nanorods, nanocones of ZnO [16] at KHz pulse repetition rate in vacuum condition. In this study, we report direct synthesis of nanofibrous structure and nanotips of glass using femtosecond laser radiation at atmospheric pressure. Also we intend to discuss the growth mechanisms of nanoscale tips.|$|R

The microstructure and properties of the sprayed coatings and the overall economics of the process depend critically on the melting and atomization occurring at the <b>wire</b> <b>tip.</b> This paper presents results characterizing several aspects of wire melting and droplet breakup in an HVOF device. Fluctuations in the incandescent emission of the plume one centimeter downstream from the <b>wire</b> <b>tip</b> were recorded using a fast photodiode.

The recorded size distributions approximate a log-normal distribution. Small particles traveled faster than large particles, but the difference was considerably smaller than simple aerodynamic drag arguments would suggest. A set of experiments was carried out to determine the effect that variations in torch gas flow rates have on wire melt rate, average particle size, and average particle velocity. The observed variation of particle size with spray condition is qualitatively consistent with a Weber breakup of the droplets coming off the wire.
