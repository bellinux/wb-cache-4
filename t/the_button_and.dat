5|$|On 6 December 2011, a prequel to {{the episode}} was {{released}} online. The Doctor (Matt Smith) is {{seen on a}} spaceship holding a red button which, when he lets go, will cause the space ship to explode. While holding the button, he has phoned the TARDIS to speak to Amy Pond asking her to rescue him, although {{he does not have}} his co-ordinates, Amy cannot fly the TARDIS, and she is not on the TARDIS. The Doctor wishes Amy a Merry Christmas before letting go of <b>the</b> <b>button,</b> <b>and</b> the spaceship explodes.|$|E
5|$|The basic close combat from {{previous}} installments has been heavily refined and expanded into the CQC system. When unarmed or using a one-handed weapon, Snake can grab opponents {{and put them}} in a chokehold, at which point a variety of actions can be performed, such as choking the enemy unconscious, slitting the enemy's throat, or interrogating them at knifepoint to obtain information. The context, pressure applied to <b>the</b> <b>button,</b> <b>and</b> movement of the analog stick determine the action performed.|$|E
5|$|The 2011 Hyundai Sonata Hybrid is {{the first}} mass {{production}} car manufactured by Hyundai to include the warning sound system. In 2010 the carmaker {{decided to have a}} button on the Sonata Hybrid's instrument panel to turn the VESS on and off, but after the enactment of the Pedestrian Safety Enhancement Act of 2010, signed into law by President Obama in early 2011, and learning that the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration would not allow such switches to avoid the noise device to be turned off, Hyundai decided not to install <b>the</b> <b>button,</b> <b>and</b> the first Sonata Hybrids destined for the U.S. market had to be altered to remove the switch.|$|E
50|$|The {{standard}} {{means of}} determining rank {{in these early}} days of Royal Navy uniforms was <b>the</b> arrangement of <b>buttons</b> <b>and</b> well as gold facing on <b>the</b> <b>buttons</b> <b>and</b> cuffbands.

5|$|Development of the PlayStation Vita port began {{shortly before}} the start of the game's service in 2014. The team formed a {{partnership}} with Sony to develop the title, but production ran into difficulties as the team attempted to create an experience of the same quality as the mobile version, along with adjusting the controls from touch-based to <b>the</b> <b>button</b> <b>and</b> joystick controls of the Vita. There was also some resistance from staff surrounding the usage of the Mana franchise and Oyamada's determination to bring Rise of Mana to consoles in the face of suggestions that it would be better to make a completely new game. When the project was proposed to Sony, the Unity technology built into the Vita was fairly new and did not make full use of the platform's processing power. In addition, the staff were unused to the version of Unity for the Vita. The team needed cooperation from both Sony and Unity Technologies to optimize the engine so the game could run on the new platform. By the time of the Vita version's announcement, only the preliminary development work had been completed, but development was proceeding according to plan. Technical troubles related to the game's performance persisted beyond this point, resulting in the release being delayed into the following year.|$|E
500|$|The {{production}} {{consists of}} various computer beats and electronic effects. The song contains an ascending bridge {{incorporated into the}} chorus, which consists of the lines: [...] "If you're ready for me boy / You'd better push <b>the</b> <b>button</b> <b>and</b> let me know / Before I get the wrong idea and go." [...] Lyrically, the song is about a woman's sexual frustration of being unnoticed by a man. [...] Joe Macare of Stylus Magazine described Buena's delivery of the lyric [...] "my sexy ass" [...] as [...] "carefree", and noted that the lyrics adapt an [...] "idiosyncratic approach" [...] to the English language. Musically, [...] "Push the Button" [...] received comparisons {{to the sound of}} pop group ABBA.|$|E
500|$|Sugababes {{performed}} [...] "Ugly" [...] at the V Festival in 2006 {{as part of}} a set list, {{which included}} Hole in the Head, Red Dress and Push the Button. Reviewers from The Sun said that the Sugababes [...] "proved both that pop can work at festivals and that losing Mutya has not caused them to miss a beat". In 2008, they performed the song at the same event in the JJB Champion Arena, {{as part of a}} set list which included Push <b>the</b> <b>Button</b> <b>and</b> About You Now. The performance received positive reviews, with a reviewer from MTV UK calling it [...] "a highlight of our festival in the JJB Arena". In August 2007, former group member Mutya Buena, who left the band shortly following the single's release, performed the song at the V Festival in Chelmsford; before playing it, she stated: [...] "This song is one I sang with my previous group... It's called 'Ugly'". On 18 September 2007, Sugababes performed an acoustic version of [...] "Ugly" [...] at the Indig02 as part of a set list, which included such songs as [...] "Freak Like Me", [...] "Round Round", [...] "In the Middle", [...] "Red Dress" [...] and [...] "Too Lost In You". Nick Levine of Digital Spy felt the performance [...] "proves that no member's a slacker in the trilling department".|$|E

2500|$|There {{are several}} {{recurring}} elements and motifs on Lost, which generally have no {{direct effect on}} the story itself but expand the show's literary and philosophical subtext. These elements include frequent appearances of black and white, which reflect the dualism within characters and situations; as well as rebellion in almost all characters, especially Kate; dysfunctional family situations (especially ones that revolve around the fathers of many characters), as portrayed {{in the lives of}} nearly all the main characters; apocalyptic references, including Desmond's pushing the button to forestall the end of the world; coincidence versus fate, revealed most apparently through the juxtaposition of the characters Locke and Mr. Eko; conflict between science and faith, embodied by the leadership tug-of-war between Jack and Locke and their stark disagreements on subjects such as the hatch, <b>the</b> <b>button,</b> <b>and</b> leaving the island; the struggle between good and evil, shown by the relationship between Jacob and the Man in Black, several times by Locke using symbols such as his backgammon set, also the white and black rocks that the Man in Black referred to as an [...] "inside joke"; and references to numerous works of literature, including mentions and discussions of particular novels. One notable reference to a novel is John Steinbeck's Of Mice and Men, usually when Sawyer is seen reading it or referencing it. There are also many allusions in characters' names to famous historical thinkers and writers, such as Ben Linus (after chemist Linus Pauling), John Locke (after the philosopher) and his alias Jeremy Bentham (after the philosopher), Danielle Rousseau (after philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau), Desmond David Hume (after philosopher David Hume), Juliet's ex-husband (after philosopher Edmund Burke), Mikhail Bakunin (after the anarchist philosopher), Daniel Faraday (after physicist Michael Faraday), Eloise Hawking (after physicist Stephen Hawking), George Minkowski (after mathematician Hermann Minkowski), Richard Alpert (the birth name of spiritual teacher Ram Dass), Boone Carlyle (after pioneer Daniel Boone and philosopher Thomas Carlyle), and Charlotte Staples Lewis (after author Clive Staples (C.S.) Lewis).|$|E
60|$|With {{trembling}} hands The Oskaloosa Kid directed the lens {{over the edge}} of the swaying and rotting bannister. His finger slipped from the lighting button plunging them all into darkness. In his frantic effort to find <b>the</b> <b>button</b> <b>and</b> relight the lamp the worst occurred--he fumbled <b>the</b> <b>button</b> <b>and</b> the lamp slipped through his fingers, falling over the bannister to the floor below. Instantly the sound of the dragging chain ceased; but the silence was even more horrible than the noise which had preceded it.|$|E

60|$|So we waited, {{ten times}} a decent interval, when the Carter stealthily {{advanced}} a timid forefinger to <b>the</b> <b>button,</b> <b>and</b> {{gave it the}} faintest, shortest possible push.

2500|$|However, in 1835 Army Regulations {{prescribed}} {{black as}} the branch color for chaplains, directing that a chaplain wear a black coat.

In 1864, the Army Uniform Board [...] "enhanced" [...] the frock coat by adding black [...] "herringbone braid" [...] in across the chest at <b>the</b> <b>buttons</b> <b>and</b> buttonholes, with <b>buttons</b> still covered in black. This coat was used by army chaplains until 1880, when shoulder boards were authorized for chaplains for the first time, and the first official insignia was introduced.|$|R
