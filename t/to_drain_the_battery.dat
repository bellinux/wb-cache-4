50|$|At {{one time}} or another, most models in the line since the {{introduction}} of the LCD models have been available in both solar powered and battery versions; the Xa retains solar power only on models sold in a few markets in Europe, while the XIIS and XS MultiView models run off both solar and battery power depending on available ambient light. The earliest model, however, ran off of a 9 volt battery, and was said <b>to</b> <b>drain</b> <b>the</b> <b>battery</b> quite quickly, creating a market in aftermarket rechargeable battery upgrades.|$|E
50|$|The iPhone 5s was {{the first}} iPhone to contain an Apple Motion Coprocessor which was denoted the M7 chip paired with the first 64-bit ARM-based Apple processor, the Apple A7 SoC (System on a Chip). The {{addition}} of the separate always on coprocessor allows the main CPU to snooze while it tracks {{the motion of the}} phone, through the use of an inertial measurement unit (IMU) consisting of an accelerometer, MEMS gyroscope and digital compass. This means that it will know when you're jogging or when you're in the car, and can take that information and store it without needing <b>to</b> <b>drain</b> <b>the</b> <b>battery</b> by having the main CPU run. It can retrofit the data to apps that you download at a later date, meaning any M7-enabled app that uses the new CoreMotion API will be able to give you information on recent training.|$|E

40|$|It is {{observed}} that pulsed discharge currents allow <b>to</b> <b>drain</b> <b>the</b> <b>battery</b> {{with a higher}} specific power. Thus they improve the batteries durability and discharge performance. The question is how can the allowed {{discharge of a battery}} be modeled. Embedded real-time systems often rely on batteries. For these systems it is necessary to prove both, real-time feasibility and the constraint to not exceed the allowed discharge currents. This paper presents a unified approach for both objectives using the flexible model of event streams, because it allows both to model a complex alloweddischarge curve and the real-time requirements for complex task stimuli. We present the model and the calculation of the allowed and requested discharge curves. Together with the known eventstream based real-time feasibility analysis this allows a unified analysis of both aspects of the system. This work enables the modeling of complex discharge requirements of batteries for real-time systems...|$|E
40|$|A Denial of Service (DoS) {{attack is}} an {{incident}} in which the user is deprived of {{the services of a}} resource he is expected to have. With the increasing reliance on mobile devices like laptops and palmtops, a new type of DoS attack is possible that attacks the batteries of these devices, called “sleep deprivation attacks”. The goal of sleep deprivation attacks is to rapidly drain the battery of the mobile devices, rendering the device inoperable long before the expected battery lifetime, thus denying the service the user expects from the mobile device. The purpose of this research is to investigate these types of attacks so that proper defense mechanisms can be put in place before the attacks become a more sophisticated and potent force. This research presents three different possible methods that can be adopted by an attacker <b>to</b> <b>drain</b> <b>the</b> <b>battery</b> of a device i. e. malignant attacks, benign attacks and network service request attacks. These attacks are implemented on a variety of mobile computing platforms like palmtops and a laptop and the corresponding results are presented.

40|$|This {{experiment}} {{report is}} based on the changing available charge capacity (electron count) of a battery by the average current demand, by using Peukert's Law. The battery capacity written on packaging wasn't found to be constant, as Peukert's Law states that high current demand from a battery decreases the number of electrons that the battery can provide. Thus, charge output and runtime aren't linearly correlated - current demands decrease the charge output in a curved fashion. The power that this curve is raised to is called the Peukert constant. This paper found the Peukert constant for GP 2700 Series Rechargable battery to be 1. 174. The greater this constant is, the greater the electron losses. Results are directly applicable to battery performance. Increasing currents are found <b>to</b> <b>drain</b> <b>the</b> <b>battery</b> exponentially (eg. doubling the current empties the battery not twice, but more than twice as fast). Thus, making energy-e�cient mobile devices will not only save energy, but will make more potential energy available to the device. Most importantly, expecting to obtain the rated (advertised) battery capacity regardless of current is ungrounded, while capacity is a function of current draft abiding by Peukert's Law. This report analyzes 10 trials of collected current and runtime data by changing current drafts (through varying resistances) to utilize the mathematical model leading to the calculation of the Peukert constant...|$|E
5000|$|Bluetooth is {{a feature}} now {{found in many}} higher-end phones, and the virus Caribe hijacked this function, making Bluetooth phones infect other Bluetooth phones running the Symbian OS. In early November 2004, several web sites began {{offering}} a specific piece of software promising ringtones and screensavers for certain phones.

30|$|For {{this study}} {{we focus on the}} {{location}} data, which is collected by the smartphones with a frequency of one sample every 15 minutes. Each location sample contains a timestamp, a latitude and longitude, and an accuracy value. Location is determined by the best available provider, either GPS or WiFi, with a median accuracy of ≈ 20 meters; more than 90 % of the data samples are reported to have an accuracy better than 40 meters. For individual participants, there may be periods missing data. These periods can occur for a number of reasons, for example due <b>to</b> a <b>drained</b> <b>battery,</b> <b>the</b> phone being switched off, the location probe being disabled, or due to software issues. Since we are interested in reconstructing mobility histories without large gaps, we select the longest period that has at least one sample in 90 % of the 15 -minutes time-bins for each participant. Moreover we consider only participants that have at least 3 months of such contiguous data. We are left with 454 users, with data collection periods of data ranging from three months to one year (Additional file 1 Figure  1).|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe subject {{addressed}} in this paper {{is the issue of}} using an UAV type Quadcopter in the internal logistics within a manufacturing plant, particularly at the stage of assembly and /or customization of products. The vertical takeoff and landing, as well as horizontal flight, both with the characteristic of low speed and high precision, are major requirements for this work. The quadrotor architecture has been chosen for analysis because of its low dimensions, good maneuverability, simple mechanics and available payload capacity. As a major drawback, the high energy consumption when operating is a constraint to be modeled and optimized. In the first step, an internal logistics modeling is performed {{in order to determine the}} location of depots, clusters and sub-clusters; workstations are defined and routes are generated using a genetic algorithm for each quadcopter of a particular fleet. In a second step, the weight to be transported by each quadcopter is determined, depending on the assigned route and workstations that should go through the sequence either to remove materials (picking) or to deliver materials (delivery). In a third step, it is determined the electric power amount <b>to</b> be <b>drained</b> off <b>the</b> <b>battery</b> of every quadcopter for a given route depending on the weight carried, distance covered, number of workstations visited and the quadcopter aerodynamic efficiency...|$|R
40|$|Energy bugs in Android apps are defects {{that can}} make Android systems waste much energy as a whole. Energy bugs {{detection}} in Android apps has become an important issue since smartphones usually operate on {{a limited amount of}} <b>battery</b> capacity and <b>the</b> existence of energy bugs may lead <b>to</b> serious <b>drain</b> in <b>the</b> <b>battery</b> power. This paper focuses on detecting two types of energy bugs, namely resource leak and layout defect, in Android apps. A resource leak is a particular type of energy wasting phenomena where an app does not release its acquired resources such as a sensor and GPS. A layout defect refers to a poor layout structure causing more energy consumption for measuring and drawing the layout. In this paper, we present a static analysis technique called SAAD, that can automatically detect energy bugs in a context-sensitive way. SAAD detects the energy bugs by taking an inter-procedural anaysis of an app. For resource leak analysis, SAAD decompiles APK file into Dalvik bytecodes files and then performs resource leak analysis by taking components call relationship analysis, inter-procedure and intra-procedure analysis. For detecting layout defect, SAAD firstly employs Lint to perform some traditional app analysis, then filters energy defects from reported issues. Our experimental result on 64 publicly-available Android apps shows that SAAD can detect energy bugs effectively. The accuracies of detecting resource leak and layout energy defect are 87. 5 % and 78. 1 % respectively. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{details the}} {{analysis}} and design of ultra-low power radio transceivers operating at microwave frequencies. Hybrid prototypes and Monolithic Microwave Integrated Circuits (MMICs) which achieve power consumptions of less than 1 mW and theoretical operating ranges of over 10 m are described. The motivation behind the design of circuits exhibiting ultra low power consumption and, {{in the case of}} the MMICs, small size is the emerging technology of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN). WSNs consist of spatially distributed ‘nodes’ or ‘specks’ each with their own renewable energy source, one or more sensors, limited memory, processing capability and radio or optical link. The idea is that specks within a ‘speckzone’ cooperate and share computational resources to perform complex tasks such as monitoring fire hazards, radiation levels or for motion tracking. The radio section must be ultra low power e. g. sub 1 mW in order not <b>to</b> <b>drain</b> <b>the</b> limited <b>battery</b> capacity. <b>The</b> radio must also be small in size e. g. less than 5 x 5 mm so that the overall speck size is small. Also, the radio must still be able to operate over a range of at least a metre so as to allow radio contact between, for example, rooms or relatively distant specks. The unsuitability of conventional homodyne topologies to WSNs is discussed and more efficient methods of modulation (On-Off Keying) and demodulation (non-coherent) are presented. Furthermore, it is shown how Super-Regenerative Receivers (SRR) can be used to achieve relatively large output voltages for small input powers. This is important because baseband Op-Amps connected at the RF receiver output generally cannot amplify small signals at the input without the output being saturated in noise (10 mV is the smallest measured input for 741 Op-Amp). Instrumentation amplifiers are used in this work as they can amplify signals below 1 mV. The thesis details {{the analysis and}} design of basic RF building blocks: amplifiers, oscillators, switches and detectors. It also details how the circuits can be put together to make transceivers as well as describing various strategies to lower power consumption. In addition, novel techniques in both circuit and system design are presented which allow the power consumption of the radio to be reduced by as much as 97 % whilst still retaining adequate performance. These techniques are based on duty cycling the transmitter and receiver and are possible because of the discontinuous nature of the On-Off Keying signal. In order to ease the sensitivity requirements of the baseband receive amplifier a design methodology for large output voltage receivers is presented. The designed receiver is measured to give a 5 mV output for an input power of - 90 dBm and yet consumes less than 0. 7 mW. There is also an appendix on the non linear modelling of the Glasgow University 50 nm InP meta-morphic High Electron Mobility Transistor (50 nm mHEMT) and one on the non linear modelling of a commercial Step Recovery diode (SRD). Models for the 50 nm mHEMT and the SRD are useful in the analysis, simulation and design of oscillators and pulse generators respectively.

We describe three main methods for an attacker <b>to</b> <b>drain</b> <b>the</b> battery: (1) Service request power attacks, where repeated requests are made to the victim for services, typically over a network [...] even if the service is not provided the victim must expend energy deciding whether or not to honor the request; (2) benign power attacks, where the victim is made to execute a valid but energy-hungry task repeatedly, and (3) malignant power attacks, where the attacker modifies or creates an executable to make the system consume more energy than it would otherwise. Our initial results demonstrate the increased power consumption due to these attacks, which we believe are the first real examples of these attacks to appear in the literature. We also propose a power-secure architecture to thwart these power attacks by employing multi-level authentication and energy signatures. 1...|$|R
