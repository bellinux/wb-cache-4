5|$|After the war, the {{military}} service of Hawaiians, including James Wood Bush and many others, was largely forgotten, disappearing from the collective {{memories of the}} American Civil War {{and the history of}} Hawaii. However, in recent years, Hawaiian residents, historians, and descendants of Hawaiian combatants in the conflict have insisted on the need to remember the legacy of the Hawaiians who fought. Renewed interest in the stories of these individuals and this particular period of Hawaiian-American history have inspired efforts to preserve <b>the</b> <b>memories</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Hawaiians who served in the war.|$|E
5|$|In {{the decades}} {{following}} the peasant war the city authorities tried {{to suppress the}} memory of this nearly successful revolt. Resistance symbols like the flags or the weapons used by the peasants, in particular their typical clubs with nails on the hitting end (called (Bauern-) Knüttel), were outlawed, confiscated, and destroyed. Documents such as the Bundesbriefe of Huttwil were stashed away in the vaults of the city archives. Any public remembrances or pilgrimages to {{the places where the}} leaders had been executed were forbidden and carried the death penalty, as did the singing of the peasants' war songs. Bern was particularly active in trying to censor <b>the</b> <b>memories</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> event and also tried to suppress images of the peasant leaders. Historic texts written during the Ancien Régime of Switzerland generally follow the official diction and mention the peasant war, if they do so at all, only briefly and in negative terms. Works with differing viewpoints were often prohibited. The censorship was not entirely successful; in private, the rural population kept the memories of 1653 alive, and various accounts of the events were printed in Germany.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>memory</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> war <b>of</b> 1812 was not {{especially}} important in the decades that followed it.

5|$|The game {{begins on}} April 1, with Makoto {{awakening}} from a nightmare {{of a girl}} dying on April 6 with a bell in her hand. As the week goes on, he occasionally experiences premonitions of the future, all of which come true. Depending on the player's choices, Makoto ends up getting close {{to one of the}} girls, and on April 5, the story branches into different routes focusing on one of them. In each route, the girl Makoto was close to dies on April 6 with a bell in her hand. Afterwards, Makoto finds that he has traveled back in time to April 1, retaining <b>the</b> <b>memories</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> previous six days. Concluding that he is trapped in an infinite loop, he vows to keep the girl alive and break free of the loop. He does so by rebuilding his relationships with her while dealing with the emotional problem troubling her. On April 6, the girl ends up in a situation similar to when she died in the last loop, but Makoto saves her, breaking free of the loop and becoming her boyfriend.|$|E
5|$|The {{memorials}} to World War I {{were shaped}} by the traumatic nature of the conflict {{and its impact on}} individuals and communities. The experience of the different nations varied considerably, but common themes emerged. The war required a mass call to arms, with a significant percentage of the population mobilised to fight, either as volunteers or through conscription. Campaigns were conducted on multiple fronts across Europe and beyond. The fighting was mechanised and conducted on an industrial scale; existing weapons, such as machine guns and artillery, were combined with the innovative deployment of aircraft, submarines and poison gas. In many theatres of operation, mobile campaigns degenerated into static trench warfare, depending on the slow attrition of the enemy over many years for victory. The battles spread across larger areas than ever before, with key engagements, such as that at Verdun etched on <b>the</b> <b>memories</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nations involved.|$|E
5|$|The game {{begins as}} Nilin (Kezia Burrows), an Errorist imprisoned in the Bastille Fortress, is having almost all her memory wiped by Memorize. As she {{is taken to}} have {{the last of her}} {{memories}} wiped, a mysterious man called Edge, the leader of the Errorists and a man she only hears over her comm device, helps her escape. Edge tells her that she is an Errorist with the gift of both stealing and remixing memories. After escaping into the slums of Neo-Paris, Nilin encounters Tommy, a fellow Errorist. Nilin and Tommy are attacked by Olga Sedova, a bounty hunter chasing Nilin. Nilin dives into Olga's mind and remixes her memory to make Olga believe that her husband was killed by a Memorize doctor. She then becomes an Errorist ally, and transports Nilin to her first destination. Arriving in the Saint-Michel district, Nilin, who is aided by another Errorist codenamed Bad Request, is told by Edge to steal secret codes from Kaori Sheridan, Neo-Paris' top architect. After retrieving and uploading the codes to Edge, he uses them to open the Saint-Michel dam, flooding the district. Due to the flood draining out the slums, Nilin is able to infiltrate the Bastille and heads to the memory servers to free the stored memories of herself and the inmates while taking down Madame, the sadistic manager of the Bastille. With Madame defeated, Nilin releases <b>the</b> <b>memories</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> inmates and partially regains some of her own. She remembers the crime that landed her in the Bastille; on a mission, Nilin remixed the mind of a Memorize commander and made him believe he had killed his girlfriend. The altered memory pushed him to commit suicide.|$|E

40|$|This study explores <b>the</b> usage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>memory</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bombings <b>of</b> Belgrade from WWII in <b>the</b> {{time period}} <b>of</b> Yugoslavia from 1995 until 2003. Considering that Belgrade was bombed by two {{opposing}} forces during WWII, once by Nazis in 1941, {{and the second}} time by the Allies in 1944, and {{due to the fact}} that <b>the</b> exploitation <b>of</b> <b>memory</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two bombings was rather unequal during the Socialist Yugoslavia with the latter bombings being a taboo theme, I was interested in answering following questions: how <b>the</b> two <b>memories</b> were used in the times before, during and after the NATO Air Strikes <b>of</b> Yugoslavia, if <b>the</b> <b>memory</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Allied bombings emerged in the public sphere and how it coexists with <b>the</b> one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Nazi bombings. My primary sources are articles from "Politika" newspaper issues from commemoration dates during the research time frame from 1995 until 2003. The final conclusion shows <b>the</b> dominant usage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>memory</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Nazi bombings throughout the whole time frame even though we could witness <b>the</b> emergence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>memory</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Allied bombings...|$|R

40|$|This {{article is}} a case study <b>of</b> Irish republican <b>memory</b> {{entrepreneurship}} that critically examines <b>the</b> collective <b>memory</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ‘Loughgall Martyrs’. Critiquing <b>the</b> ‘malleability <b>of</b> memory’, it interrogates attempts at remoulding <b>the</b> <b>memory</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ‘Loughgall Martyrs’ in tandem with ‘memory politics’ in modern Irish republicanism and transitioning Northern Ireland. It examines <b>the</b> reinterpretation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Loughgall <b>memory</b> by Sinn Fein to support their current strategy in <b>the</b> transition <b>of</b> Northern Ireland and conversely how traditionalists use <b>the</b> resilience <b>of</b> <b>memory</b> to contest reinterpretation. Particular examination is given to <b>the</b> emergence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1916 societies as a platform for localised resistance to political use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>memory</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> men by Sinn Fein. It also examines how <b>the</b> <b>memory</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ‘Loughgall Martyrs’ has been imbibed with assertions of victimhood that feed into wider contestation over the past in <b>the</b> North <b>of</b> Ireland...|$|R

On the ribbon under the board is the Latin text:” In necessariis unitas – in dubiis libertas – in omnibus caritas.” (Unity in unavoidable matters – freedom in doubtful matters – love in all things.)

25|$|The {{original}} Star Sapphire's {{powers are}} vast. She {{is equipped with}} an arsenal of weapons, including a replicate Zamaron star sapphire, of unknown origin. She also {{has a variety of}} personal powers, though whether they stem from herself or her personal armament is unclear. She is also able to access <b>the</b> <b>memories</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Zamorans regarding the Star Sapphire gem, such as the experiences of other wearers. As with the powers of the woman bearing the title of Star Sapphire, the limitations of the Star Sapphire gem are also unclear. Psychologically, the women serving as Star Sapphire have displayed a bizarre preoccupation with gender, suspected of reflecting a pathological fear of men. They also have had a less than accurate grasp of the variations in physics between dimensions. They are sometimes foiled primarily due to their own overconfidence. The Star Sapphire gems used to power the original incarnations of Star Sapphire were used by the Zamarons to create the main violet Power Battery.|$|E
25|$|The {{evidence}} for SRA was {{primarily in the}} form of testimonies from children who made allegations of SRA, and adults who claim to remember abuse during childhood, that may have been forgotten and recovered during therapy. With both children and adults, no corroborating evidence has been found for anything except pseudosatanism in which the satanic and ritual aspects were secondary to and used as a cover for sexual abuse. Despite this lack of objective evidence, and aided by the competing definitions of what SRA actually was, proponents claimed SRA was a real phenomenon throughout the peak and during the decline of the moral panic. Despite allegations appearing in the United States, Netherlands, Sweden, New Zealand and Australia, no material evidence has been found to corroborate allegations of organized cult-based abuse that practices human sacrifice and cannibalism. Though trauma specialists frequently claimed the allegations made by children and adults were the same, in reality the statements made by adults were more elaborate, severe, and featured more bizarre abuse. In 95% of the adults' cases, <b>the</b> <b>memories</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> abuse were recovered during psychotherapy.|$|E
