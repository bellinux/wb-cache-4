5|$|The {{following}} {{table lists}} the toll rates for passenger cars, both {{with and without}} FasTrak (as of June 12, 2012). The toll rate is doubled for vehicles with more than <b>two</b> <b>axles.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} {{table lists}} the tolls {{at each of}} the tolled exits for passenger cars and other two-axle vehicles (as of July 1, 2015). Vehicles with more than <b>two</b> <b>axles</b> pay a higher toll at the Orange Grove Toll Plaza.|$|E
5|$|The charges vary {{according}} to the type of vehicle. Motorcycles are free but there are standard charges for cars, two-axle goods vehicles and larger vehicles with more than <b>two</b> <b>axles.</b> Drivers who fail to pay the charge are issued with a penalty charge notice. There are no signs warning of penalty charges.|$|E
50|$|Both Windhoff and Talbot {{trains are}} operationally compatible; {{differences}} between the versions include the electronic control systems, minor differences in dimension, and the wheel arrangement. The three intermediate unpowered vehicles in the Windhoff CargoSprinter are <b>two</b> <b>axle</b> wagons, the Talbot intermediate unpowered cars use <b>two</b> <b>axle</b> jacobs articulation between the wagons, and <b>two</b> <b>axle</b> bogies on the end wagons.|$|R

5|$|As of 2009, {{passengers}} of two-axle vehicles (such as {{cars and}} motorcycles) pay tolls of 65¢ in cash or 55¢ if Pikepass is used. Drivers in vehicles {{with more than}} <b>two</b> <b>axles,</b> such as truckers, pay higher tolls. Tolls are collected at the single barrier toll plaza between the US-177 and Roff interchanges. Due to the partial interchanges, {{it is not possible}} to legally use the turnpike without passing through this toll plaza. The toll is the same regardless of the point of entry or exit.|$|E
5|$|Stephenson {{built the}} {{locomotive}} originally as an 0-4-0 (an 0-4-0 is the Whyte notation for a steam locomotive with two powered axles and no unpowered leading or trailing axles). The locomotive's power was {{transmitted to the}} driving axles through pistons that were mounted under the boiler between the two front wheels {{and in front of}} the front axle. These inside cylinders' main rods were connected to a rear crank axle with a connecting rod between the <b>two</b> <b>axles</b> to power the front axle.|$|E
5|$|All {{but one of}} the trams had a SV36-bogie from Strømmens Værksted. The two bogies, {{each with}} <b>two</b> <b>axles,</b> were {{attached}} to the steel crossbeam. The aluminium body was attached to the crossbeam with leaf springs. The bogie frames were fastened to the axle box via a revolute joint and a spiral spring. Each bogie had two motors, each controlling one axle. In 1941, no. 187 was equipped with a SV41-bogie from Strømmen; it had a different spring system that allowed the tram to remain at the same height independent of the weight.|$|E
50|$|Coal was {{initially}} transported in waggons with a bamboo superstructure, {{later with a}} wooden superstructure and today <b>two</b> <b>axle</b> steel waggons are being used. For the passenger service <b>two</b> <b>axle</b> carriages with open windows are used, and for checked-in luggage there are four axle carriages available. The tourist carriages have also four axles. Their windows are covered by transparent plastic {{and some of them}} are painted in brown.|$|R

50|$|As {{a special}} feature, the {{locomotive}} had been {{fitted with a}} <b>two</b> <b>axle</b> subframe supporting the brake frame for the electromagnetic rail brakes, which were supplied with current through the overhead catenary. Due to these subframes, the locomotive's wheel arrangement is correctly described as C′2′C′ in its original form, and B′2′B′ in its modified form. The <b>two</b> <b>axle</b> subframe, together with a small luggage compartment, has never been {{taken into account in}} the official classification of the locomotive. Strictly speaking, the locomotive should be classified as GDe 4/6 in its present configuration.|$|R
25|$|The LVSR {{is powered}} by a 15.2-litre Caterpillar C15 six-cylinder in-line turbocharged, {{water-cooled}} four-stroke diesel, developing 600 hp (448kW). This is coupled to a seven-speed Allison automatic gearbox and Oshkosh single-speed transfer case. Suspension is Oshkosh TAK-4 fully independent all-round, and by coil springs on the front <b>two</b> <b>axles,</b> hydraulic on the rear three.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} Fun Ho! {{race cars}} {{made in the}} late 1930s were mostly generic midget, sprint, and salt flat cars of simple casting with <b>two</b> <b>axles,</b> and four rubber wheels (sometimes the rubber was white). The first cars were made out of lead (Jordan 2015). Most of the cars had a driver {{that was part of}} the casting. Only a couple, like the Cooper and Mercedes Streamliner were replicas of real cars (Fun Ho! 2015).|$|E
25|$|One Heaver-bodied {{coach for}} City Coach Company, Romford and two deck {{and a half}} airport coaches bodied by the Northern Ireland Road Transport Board for their own use were built to a twin-steering three-axle {{specification}} with the second steering axle, which had 17-inch rather than 21-inch wheels, designed to be readily removed once 30ft length on <b>two</b> <b>axles</b> was legal. City had pre-war operated the largest fleet of the Leyland Gnu twin-steering single decker, switching to them from conventional six-wheeled Tigers.|$|E
5000|$|In 1979 {{mining and}} {{construction}} locomotive builder Bedia Maschinenfabrik of Bonn supplied five D35/6 <b>two</b> <b>axle</b> diesel-hydraulic [...] narrow gauge locomotives, works numbers 150-154, to an unknown customer in Afghanistan.|$|R
2500|$|... "A1A-A1A" [...] {{means there}} are two trucks under the unit. Each truck has <b>two</b> powered <b>axles,</b> with an idler axle between them. This spreads {{the weight of the}} {{locomotive}} more evenly spread over the track and counteracts the tendency of trucks to oscillate at high speeds, which is a problem with <b>two</b> <b>axle</b> trucks. The idler wheels may be smaller than the powered wheels.|$|R
50|$|Also a {{cylindrical}} body can be clamped between <b>two</b> <b>axle</b> centres. Here also the dial gauge is mounted over the {{cylindrical body}} {{and thus the}} roundness is measured by similar procedure as above.|$|R
25|$|As {{locomotive}} types {{began to}} diverge {{in the late}} 19th century, freight engine designs at first emphasised tractive effort, whereas those for passenger engines emphasised speed. Over time, freight locomotive size increased, and {{the overall number of}} axles increased accordingly; the leading bogie was usually a single axle, but a trailing truck was added to larger locomotives to support a larger firebox that could no longer fit between or above the driving wheels. Passenger locomotives had leading bogies with <b>two</b> <b>axles,</b> fewer driving axles, and very large driving wheels in order to limit the speed at which the reciprocating parts had to move.|$|E
25|$|Tolls {{are only}} {{collected}} from westbound traffic at the toll plaza {{on the east}} side of the bay. Since July 2010, the toll rate for passenger cars is $5. For vehicles with more than <b>two</b> <b>axles,</b> the toll rate is $5 per axle. Drivers may either pay by cash or use the FasTrak electronic toll collection device. There are seven toll lanes at the plaza. During peak traffic hours, the leftmost lane is designated a FasTrak-only HOV lane, allowing carpool vehicles carrying two or more people or motorcycles to pass for a toll of $2.50. The next two leftmost lanes are FasTrak-only lanes for all vehicles, and all other lanes accept both cash and FasTrak. During non-peak hours the HOV lane is open to vehicles carrying only one person, but remains FasTrak-only.|$|E
25|$|They {{are usually}} 8-car {{articulated}} units (DSB class SA-SB-SC-SD-SD-SC-SB-SA, {{also known as}} Litra SA) supplied by Alstom-LHB and Siemens with prefabricated friction stir welded aluminium roof panels made by Marine Aluminium from Sapa extrusions, and were manufactured from 1996 to 2007. The cars are shorter than conventional railway cars; each has a single axle under one end, the other end being supported by the neighbouring car. (The end cars have <b>two</b> <b>axles</b> each). They have automatic Scharfenberg couplers at the ends; in peak hours most trains consist of two coupled units, giving a total train length of 168 meters. They have video surveillance to ensure passenger and staff security and to prevent acts of vandalism. These trains introduced air conditioning in the interior and regenerative braking to the network, increasing energy efficiency. At present, there are 105 8-car trains (840 cars).|$|E
25|$|Campbell's {{solution}} to the problem of weight distribution and tractive effort was to develop two coupled drivers, one in front of the boiler and one at the rear with a <b>two</b> <b>axle</b> lead truck.|$|R
2500|$|... "2-B+B-2" [...] {{means there}} are two sets of {{articulated}} axles under the unit. Within each of these sets, there is a truck with <b>two</b> idler <b>axles,</b> and inboard of it are <b>two</b> powered <b>axles.</b> <b>Two</b> of these articulated sets are placed back to back and connected by a hinge. The PRR DD1 and DD2 electric locomotives used this arrangement.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} explain the {{theoretical}} ground for the weeding-out of the <b>two</b> <b>axle</b> wagons with short wheel base, {{we are going to}} prove by numerical calculations how the rail side-thrust caused by vehicle yawing is changed by the size of wheel bases. 　The yawing of <b>two</b> <b>axle</b> vehicles running on the rails with sinuous form deformations was analyzed and we got the following conclusion by applying to this the data of the present vehicles. lf a goods wagon of 10 t. carrying capacity uses a 4 m. wheel base instead of a 3 m. wheel base, the rail side-thrust by yawing will decrease 25 %...|$|R
25|$|On April 7, 2014, {{the toll}} for users of FasTrak was {{increased}} from $5 to $6, while the toll for drivers using either {{the license plate}} tolling or the one time payment system was raised from $6 to $7. Bicycle, pedestrian, and northbound motor vehicle traffic remain toll free. For vehicles with more than <b>two</b> <b>axles,</b> the toll rate is $7 per axle for those using license plate tolling or the one time payment system, and $6 per axle for FasTrak users. During peak traffic hours, carpool vehicles carrying two or more people and motorcycles pay a discounted toll of $4; drivers must have Fastrak {{to take advantage of}} this carpool rate. The Golden Gate Transportation District then planned to increase the tolls by 25 cents in July 2015, and then by another 25 cents each of the next three years.|$|E
