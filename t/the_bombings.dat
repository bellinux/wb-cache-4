5|$|Before {{the end of}} <b>the</b> <b>bombings</b> on August 15, 1973, a legal {{challenge}} to <b>the</b> <b>bombings</b> had mounted in United States Federal Court {{in the case of}} Schlesinger v. Holtzman. Congresswoman Elizabeth Holtzman voted against the Case-Church amendment, as she wanted an immediate end to <b>the</b> <b>bombings,</b> and subsequently filed suit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York seeking an order to require such. On July 25, 1973, U.S. District Judge Orrin Grimmell Judd granted summary judgment to Holtzman and issued an injunction ordering the military to refrain from participating in military activities in Cambodia. His order would have become effective on July 27, however, on that day, a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit unanimously stayed his order. Holtzman then attempted to get the Circuit Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court overseeing the Second Circuit, Justice Thurgood Marshall, to vacate the stay. Justice Marshall refused to vacate the stay, issuing an in-chambers opinion. Holtzman then turned to Justice William O. Douglas who granted Holtzman's motion to vacate the stay on August 4, 1973, and he ordered the U.S. Military to cease all bombing in Cambodia. The military ignored his order, and six hours later, the other eight Justices of the Supreme Court voted unanimously to reverse Douglas's order.|$|E
5|$|Hibakusha {{and their}} {{children}} were (and still are) victims of severe discrimination in Japan due to public ignorance {{about the consequences of}} radiation sickness, with much of the public believing it to be hereditary or even contagious. This is despite the fact that no statistically demonstrable increase of birth defects or congenital malformations was found among the later conceived children born to survivors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. A study of the long-term psychological effects of <b>the</b> <b>bombings</b> on the survivors found that even 17–20 years after <b>the</b> <b>bombings</b> had occurred survivors showed a higher prevalence of anxiety and somatization symptoms.|$|E
5|$|Alex is able {{to prove}} her innocence in the Grand Central Terminal bombing {{with the help of}} her classmates at Quantico and discovers that the {{suspected}} bomber was former FBI analyst-trainee Elias Harper (Rick Cosnett), who had planted the bomb under the instruction of a terrorist mastermind. Having cleared her name in a congressional hearing, Alex is reinstated as an FBI agent and assigned to the field office in New York City, specifically the operations section, and now strives to uncover the true mastermind behind <b>the</b> <b>bombings</b> as the 2016 Presidential election draws ever closer. Prior to the election, the terrorist kills Natalie Vasquez and Drew Perales to force Alex into doing his bidding. At the end of season one, Liam is revealed to be the traitor, with Alex and Ryan killing him in the finale. After <b>the</b> <b>bombings,</b> the ensuing publicity, and Simon Asher's death, Alex is fired from the FBI. Two months after the presidential election, Alex is approached by Matthew Keyes (Henry Czerny), the director of the CIA, who extends an offer for her to join and work for the organization.|$|E

Though the congregation officially supported him, a number of members privately urged him to leave Beth Israel and find another pulpit.
