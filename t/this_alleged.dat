5|$|I {{examined}} Mr. Andrew Wilson on Feb. 15 & 16, 1982. He {{had multiple}} bruises, swellings and abrasions {{on his face}} and head. His right eye was battered and had a superficial laceration. Andrew Wilson had several linear blisters on his right thigh, right cheek and anterior chest which were consistent with radiator burns. He stated he'd been cuffed to a radiator and pushed into it. He also stated that electrical shocks had been administered to his gums, lips and genitals. All these injuries occurred prior to his arrival at the Jail. There must be a thorough investigation of <b>this</b> <b>alleged</b> brutality.|$|E
5|$|Although he openly opposed secession {{during the}} American Civil War, federal {{military}} forces labeled Helm a Confederate sympathizer. In September 1862, {{he was arrested}} for <b>this</b> <b>alleged</b> sympathy, but Governor James F. Robinson recognized him as he was being transported to a prison in Louisville and had him released. After the war Helm identified with the Democratic Party, and in 1865 Hardin County voters returned him to the state senate. In 1867 he was the state's Democratic candidate for governor. Despite his failing health, Helm made a vigorous canvass of the state and won the general election. He was too weak to travel to Frankfort for his inauguration, so state officials administered the oath of office at his home on September 3, 1867. He died five days later.|$|E
5|$|To Brodie, Jefferson’s {{ambiguous}} posturings on slavery {{could be}} explained by his personal life. If he had been conducting a 28-year affair with a slave, then he could not free his slaves because once they were freed, Virginia law would force them from the state, unless he gained permission from the legislature for them to stay. He could continue his liaison with Hemings only if his slaves remained slaves. Two of the most prominent Jefferson biographers of the twentieth century, Dumas Malone and Merrill Peterson, had relied on Jefferson family testimony by two Randolph grandchildren who named his Carr nephews as fathers. They discounted other evidence about <b>this</b> <b>alleged</b> sexual relationship, including by Madison Hemings in 1873, who identified Jefferson as his father. The relationship was first reported in 1802 by the journalist James T. Callender when Jefferson was President, after Callender failed to win an appointment by the president.|$|E
5000|$|The vehicle {{driver was}} {{subsequently}} arrested. Press TV disputed <b>this,</b> <b>alleging</b> that both driver and vehicle [...] "have disappeared" [...] and her death is [...] "suspicious".|$|R
25|$|Russian {{television}} carried little {{coverage of}} the attacks for the first hour after the first explosion took place (at 7:57 am). Commentators have criticised <b>this,</b> <b>alleging</b> that it spread more panic and led to citizens feeling helpless.|$|R
50|$|Due to Regeni's {{research}} activities and left-wing political leanings, the Egyptian police are strongly suspected {{of involvement in}} his murder in Europe, although Egypt's media and government deny <b>this,</b> <b>alleging</b> secret undercover agents belonging to the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt carried out the crime in order to embarrass the Egyptian government and destabilize relations between Italy and Egypt.|$|R
5|$|In 1370, {{following}} the ousting of the Mongols from China {{and the establishment}} of the Chinese Ming dynasty, the Pope sent a new mission to China, comprising the Parisian theologian Guillaume du Pré as the new archbishop and 50 Franciscans. However, this mission disappeared, apparently eliminated by Emperor Zhu Yuanzhang of Ming. The Ming Hongwu Emperor sent a diplomatic letter to the Byzantine Empire, through a European in China named Nieh-ku-lun. John V Palaiologos was the Byzantine Emperor at the time the message was sent by Hongwu, with the proclamatory letter informing him about the establishment of the new Ming dynasty. The message was sent to the Byzantine ruler in September 1371 when Hongwu met with the merchant Nieh-ku-lun (捏古倫) from Fu lin (Byzantium). The Khanbaliq bishop Nicolaus de Bentra is speculated to be the same person as Nieh-ku-lun, for instance, by Emil Bretschneider in 1888. More recently, Edward N. Luttwak (2009) also mused that Nicolaus de Bentra and <b>this</b> <b>alleged</b> Byzantine merchant Nieh-ku-lin were one in the same.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after de Gaulle and Foccart's meeting, French commanders Haulin and Royer were {{released}} {{at the request}} of the French Embassy. Intervention could not commence without a formal petition to the Head of State of Gabon. Since M'ba was held hostage, the French contacted the Vice President of Gabon, Paul-Marie Yembit, who had not been arrested. At the time, Yembit was in a car with U.S. ambassador Charles Darlington travelling to N'Dende. This was to officially open a school built by the Peace Corps nearby, in Yembit's birthplace of Moussambou, and completing his electoral campaign. Therefore, they decided to compose a predated letter that Yembit would later sign, confirming their intervention. They sent this to him via a small airplane, since there were no road bridges in Gabon at the time and the only way to cross a river was on a ferry. Yembit did not come back to Libreville on the plane as would be expected, but rather at 8:00 WAT on 18 February to read a statement over Radio Libreville that was likely prepared by French officials. Yembit, however, claimed that he called for French intervention while the insurgent troops held M'ba hostage; this version of the story was quickly disputed by several diplomats on the scene, as several French troops had arrived before <b>this</b> <b>alleged</b> incident.|$|E
25|$|Certain {{neurological}} {{and respiratory}} ill health effects {{have been linked}} anecdotally to exposure to bleed air that has been alleged to have been contaminated with toxic levels on commercial and military aircraft. <b>This</b> <b>alleged</b> long-term illness {{is referred to as}} Aerotoxic Syndrome by agenda groups, {{but it is not a}} medically recognized syndrome. One alleged potential contaminant is tricresyl phosphate.|$|E
5000|$|In December 2014, the German {{broadcaster}} ARD made wide-ranging {{allegations of}} doping in Russian athletics and high-level cover-ups of <b>this.</b> <b>Alleging</b> state involvement in systematic cheating, the documentary accused Russia of an [...] "East German-style" [...] doping programme. These resulted in then ARAF President Valentin Balakhnichev's resignation as Treasurer of the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF).|$|R
50|$|Maser {{maintained}} {{that he had}} heard of a reputed son of Hitler {{for the first time in}} 1965 while doing research in Wavrin and surrounding cities. He followed up on these reports, met Loret in the process, and was able to convince him to let the story be published. Maser exerted great effort to gather evidence to support it, however, historians including Anton Joachimsthaler have criticised <b>this,</b> <b>alleging</b> that Maser was subordinating the scholarly pursuit of truth in order to pursue commercial motives such as sensationalism and enjoyment of scandal.|$|R
50|$|In 2005, {{a second}} ethical {{complaint}} {{on the same}} incident was filed by a Kansas state disciplinary panel, <b>this</b> time <b>alleging</b> that he broke rules of professional conduct for lawyers.|$|R
25|$|Many {{lobbying}} {{groups have}} been set up to advocate for research into <b>this</b> <b>alleged</b> hazard. The groups include the Aviation Organophosphate Information Site (AOPIS) (2001), the Global Cabin Air Quality Executive (2006) and the UK-based Aerotoxic Association (2007). Cabin Environment Research is one of many functions of the ACER Group, but their researchers have not yet established any causal relationship relationship.|$|E
25|$|In September 2012, {{the city}} {{passed a law}} {{limiting}} the practice of circumcision among Orthodox Jews. The legislation requires that at each event, the mohel receives signed consent forms from the parents, acknowledging that they were notified of health risks associated with cleaning the wound by sucking blood from the male baby's organ. This regulation caused an outcry among certain Orthodox Jewish communities on <b>this</b> <b>alleged</b> infringement of their religious freedom, and the matter was taken to federal court.|$|E
25|$|The Baconian {{theory of}} Shakespearean authorship holds that Sir Francis Bacon, philosopher, essayist and scientist, wrote the plays which were {{publicly}} attributed to William Shakespeare. Various explanations are offered for <b>this</b> <b>alleged</b> subterfuge, most commonly that Bacon's rise to high office {{might have been}} hindered were it to become known that he wrote plays for the public stage. Thus the plays were credited to Shakespeare, who was merely a front to shield the identity of Bacon.|$|E
50|$|<b>This</b> plus <b>alleged</b> {{evidence}} {{obtained from}} the Iraq Embassy {{was used as a}} pretext for the dismissal of the provincial government of Sardar Attaullah Mengal and the subsequent military intervention in Balochistan.|$|R
50|$|In January 2010, the National Book Critics Circle named The Hindus as {{a finalist}} for its 2009 book awards. The Hindu American Foundation protested <b>this</b> decision, <b>alleging</b> {{inaccuracies}} and bias in the book.|$|R

25|$|The church built {{there is}} now the {{basilica}} of Santa Maria Maggiore, and the feast was celebrated at that church for centuries on August 5 each year. However, {{there was no mention}} of <b>this</b> <b>alleged</b> miracle in historical records until a few hundred years later, not even by Pope Sixtus III in his dedicatory inscription, and it may be that the legend has no historical basis. However, in the 14th century the feast was extended to all the churches of Rome and finally it was made a universal feast by Pope Pius V.|$|E
25|$|An {{example of}} <b>this</b> <b>alleged</b> {{attitude}} is the previous displaying {{of the picture}} of an Ulster Volunteer Force member who was allegedly involved, among others, {{in the murder of}} 26 people in Dublin in the 1974 Dublin and Monaghan Bombings, and who was himself killed by the Provisional IRA in 1976. His picture had appeared at FAIR rallies and an organiser of the Love Ulster demonstration previously told a republican newspaper that he would not guarantee that images of the murder suspect would not be displayed during the demonstration.|$|E
25|$|In {{retaliation}} for <b>this</b> <b>alleged</b> crime, forces {{loyal to the}} Pope marched on Castro. Ranuccio attempted to ride out against the Pope's forces but was routed by Luigi Mattei. On 2 September, on the Pope's orders, the city was completely destroyed. Not only did Pope Innocent's troops destroy the fortifications and general buildings of Castro, they destroyed the churches as well so as to completely sever all links between {{the city and the}} papacy. As a final insult, the troops destroyed Duke Ranuccio's family Palazzo Farnese and erected a column reading Quì fu Castro ("Here stood Castro").|$|E
5000|$|That quotation, in this 1913-published book, was {{referring}} {{not at all}} to the Federal Reserve System, as <b>this</b> film <b>alleges,</b> but instead to the situation that preceded it and that Wilson was attacking: the [...] "trusts" [...] and [...] "monopolies." ...|$|R
500|$|Held in the French town of Grenoble, the 1968 Winter Olympics {{were the}} first Olympic Games to be {{broadcast}} in colour. There were 37 nations and 1,158 athletes competing in 35 events. [...] Frenchman Jean-Claude Killy became only the second person to win all the men's alpine skiing events. The organising committee sold television rights for US$2million, which was {{more than twice the}} price of the broadcast rights for the Innsbruck Games. Venues were spread over long distances requiring three athletes' villages. The organisers claimed this was required to accommodate technological advances. Critics disputed <b>this,</b> <b>alleging</b> that the layout was necessary to provide the best possible venues for television broadcasts {{at the expense of the}} athletes.|$|R
50|$|Beside <b>this</b> lots of <b>alleged</b> criminals {{were killed}} by Bangladesh police {{by the name of}} cross fire.|$|R
25|$|Born and baptized in the Roman Catholic faith {{although}} he was a lapsed adherent, Kérékou allegedly converted to Islam in 1980 while {{on a visit to}} Libya, and changed his first name to Ahmed, but he later returned {{to the use of the}} name Mathieu. <b>This</b> <b>alleged</b> conversion may have been designed to please the Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi and obtain financial and military support. Alternatively, the conversion story may have been a rumor planted by some of his opponents in order to destabilize his regime. He subsequently became a born-again Christian. Some Vodun believers in Benin regarded him as having magical powers, explaining his ability to survive repeated coup attempts during his military rule.|$|E
25|$|Hardin {{claimed that}} on July 1, 1874, he drove off 17 Texas Rangers {{who had been}} {{trailing}} him, and killed one of them. <b>This</b> <b>alleged</b> shooting happened after a triple lynching of Hardin's cousin and two ranch hands. He also claimed to have driven off another group of men after killing one of them. There are no contemporary reports to confirm these stories. However, on June 1, 1874, a Texas Ranger's company did kill Hardin's cousins, Alexander Barekman and Alexander Anderson, in a gunfight and claimed to have wounded Hardin as well. Hardin wrote about his cousins' killings but does not confirm that he was wounded at all, and claimed to have heard about their deaths later.|$|E
25|$|Minor was cooptated to the {{governing}} Central Executive Committee of the CPA on April 24, 1922, by {{decision of the}} CEC itself. He was re-elected {{in his own right}} at the ill-fated August 1922 convention held on the shores of Lake Michigan just outside the tiny Michigan town of Bridgman. This convention was raided by local and Michigan state authorities, acting in concert with the Bureau of Investigation of the U.S. Department of Justice, who had an undercover agent sitting as a delegate. Wanted by the police, Minor surrendered with 9 others on March 10, 1923, and was released shortly thereafter on $1,000 bond. He was never tried for <b>this</b> <b>alleged</b> violation of the Michigan criminal syndicalism law.|$|E

50|$|Often {{the ears}} are cropped short when {{the dogs are}} very young. <b>This</b> is <b>alleged</b> to be in homage {{to the days when}} they were hunted (the ears were {{presented}} for the bounty.) Most fighting dog breeds have their ears severely cropped.|$|R
2500|$|Killing Joke also sued Nirvana during <b>this</b> phase, <b>alleging</b> {{that the}} riff for the latter's song [...] "Come as You Are" [...] was copied from the riff for their song [...] "Eighties". The lawsuit was dropped after {{the suicide of}} Nirvana {{frontman}} Kurt Cobain.|$|R
25|$|The {{removal of}} quotas was largely {{reported}} to have resulted {{in an increase in}} the percentage of Bumiputra entering public universities. The perceived bias towards Bumiputras has meant that non-Bumiputra who can afford to do so choose to enter private colleges or to go overseas to further their education. There is a significant proportion of non-Bumiputra who do not enter into contention for admission to public universities. It is also alleged that during the marking of examination scripts in the Government exams, that Malay/Bumiputra students are given additional points even before the students sit for the exams. As a result, despite the removal of the Quota system, <b>this</b> <b>alleged</b> unfair advantage gives more places to undeserving students of Malay origin.|$|E
25|$|Daschle has a mixed {{voting record}} on abortion-related issues, which led the pro-choice {{organization}} NARAL {{to give him}} a 50% vote rating. In 1999 and 2003, Daschle voted in favor of the ban on partial-birth abortion, and supported legislation making it a crime to harm an unborn child when someone attacks a pregnant woman. (Investigators into the 2001 anthrax attacks, which included Senator Daschle's Capitol Hill office, suspect that alleged anthrax mailer Bruce Ivins may have chosen to target Daschle over his views on abortion, although Ivins's lawyer disputed <b>this</b> <b>alleged</b> motive.) In 2003 Daschle's stance on abortion was reportedly criticized by Roman Catholic Bishop Robert Carlson wrote to Senator Daschle as in conflict with Roman Catholic teaching, and that he should no longer identify himself as a Catholic.|$|E
25|$|Hamburg was hit {{much more}} severely. When the plague had reached Pinneberg and Rellingen {{just north of}} the Hamburg {{territory}} in the summer of 1712, Hamburg restricted travel to the town, which the Danish king used as a pretext to encircle Hamburg with his forces and confiscate Hamburg vessels on the River Elbe, demanding 500,000 thalers (later reduced to 246,000 thalers) to make up for <b>this</b> <b>alleged</b> discrimination against his subjects in Altona. 12,000 Danish soldiers were moved before Hamburg's gates. When the plague broke out in Hamburg less than three weeks later, it was carried there from the Danish troops by a prostitute from Hamburg's Gerkenshof lane, where out of 53 people 35 fell ill and 18 died. The lane was blocked and isolated; however, the quarantine could not prevent the disease from spreading through the densely built-up neighborhoods. Among the dead was the plague doctor Majus, who belonged to those physicians who wore a beak-shaped mask containing a vinegar-soaked sponge to protect him against the miasma. In December, the plague faded out.|$|E
50|$|Further {{testimony}} {{indicated the}} petitioner, {{who was a}} World War II veteran had encouraged Communist Party members to join various veteran groups in the United States {{with the intent of}} converting them to the Communist cause. <b>This</b> was <b>alleged</b> to have occurred in 1946.|$|R

5000|$|A famous Georgian poet Galaktion Tabidze is {{sometimes}} {{thought to have}} been in love with Mary. The word of Tabidze's alleged romantic feelings for the princess spread throughout Georgia after the publication of his poem titled [...] "Mary," [...] in which the poet bitterly described the wedding ceremony of a certain Mary, without specifying whether he was referring to Princess Eristavi. Princess Mary herself disagreed with the rumors, stressing that the poem was first published in 1915 in a Georgian journal Theater and Life, while her wedding to Prince George Eristavi did not occur until 1918. Some sources confirm <b>this,</b> <b>alleging</b> that it was only in 1935 when Galaktion met Mary by accident as she sat in front of Louvre.|$|R
