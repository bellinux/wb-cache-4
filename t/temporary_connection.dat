5|$|When {{the line}} reopened in 1907 just one {{locomotive}} was used. This was a Beyer Peacock 4-4-0T built in 1879 for the Metropolitan Railway in London, it was number 37 of their A Class condensing locomotives. It {{arrived on the}} railway on 30 June 1907 {{by way of a}} <b>temporary</b> <b>connection</b> from the Great Western Railway (GWR) at Kentsford.|$|E
25|$|On June 30, 1924, {{at what is}} now {{the other}} end of the line, a subway line {{initially}} known as the 14th Street–Eastern District Line, usually shortened to 14th Street–Eastern Line, was opened running beneath 14th Street in Manhattan, from Sixth Avenue under the East River and through Williamsburg to Montrose Avenue and Bushwick Avenues. In 1924, a <b>temporary</b> <b>connection</b> was built from the Long Island Rail Road's Bushwick Yard that ran via Montrose Avenue and then connected to the BMT Canarsie Line under Bushwick Avenue just near the Montrose Avenue station. This was done in order for the delivery of new BMT Standard subway cars for the then isolated Canarsie Line of the New York City Subway. The first of the cars were delivered by this ramp on June 18, 1924.|$|E
2500|$|The line did pick up {{significant}} {{traffic from}} sawmills in the area, {{some of which}} had their own sidings. A connection was made with the Tyers Valley Tramway at Collins siding, between Watson and Erica. While the tramway used the same gauge as the railway, there was no physical connection, timber being transhipped by hand. A <b>temporary</b> <b>connection</b> {{had to be put}} in place to move locomotives to and from the tramway. A small copper mine and two lime kilns near Platina provided additional traffic. A series of [...] "Back to Walhalla" [...] days in the 1930s caused the railways to put on special passenger trains for these occasions, and such was the demand some were double-headed.|$|E

50|$|The use of {{flexible}} cords with plugs at their ends and sockets (jacks) to make <b>temporary</b> <b>connections</b> {{dates back to}} cord-type manually operated telephone switchboards (if not even earlier, possibly for telegraph circuits). Cords with plugs at both ends had been used for many decades {{before the advent of}} Moog's synthesizers to make <b>temporary</b> <b>connections</b> (patches) in such places as radio and recording studios. These became known as patch cords, and that term was also used for Moog modular systems. As familiarity developed, a given setup of the synthesizer (both cord connections and knob settings) came to be referred to as a patch, and the term has persisted, applying to systems that do not use patch cords.|$|R

2500|$|In the end, his <b>temporary</b> <b>connection</b> {{with the}} Collège de Beauvais was ended by a fight, {{in which he}} {{defeated}} officers of the king's guard, forcing him once again to change his place of residence. The story is told in Latin by Gian Vittorio Rossi, a contemporary. He begins with a characterisation of Dempster that has been much repeated: [...] "But, I don't know by what pact, those most mild-mannered sisters (the Muses) ... have embraced Thomas Dempster, a Scot, a man made for war and contention ... he allowed almost no day to go by empty of strife ... but that he should fight another by sword, or, if he had no sword, with fists ...." [...] In the story, Dempster whips a student on the bare back for dueling, but the student, unable to bear the insult, brings in three relatives who happen {{to belong to the}} custodes corporis Regis, the king's own bodyguard. In response Dempster arms the other students, surrounds the guardsmen and puts them in chains in the bell tower. In the resulting inquiry, [...] "such a storm arose" [...] that Thomas departed for England. The story says distinctly that England was a [...] "safe refuge", meaning between the lines that Catholic prosecutors could not extradite him or threaten him with agents.|$|E
2500|$|The Utah State Legislature {{added the}} road from US-89 in Gunnison north to US-91 (now SR-78) in Levan to the state highway system in 1925 and {{numbered}} it SR-28 in 1927. In 1968, the legislature designated several portions of soon-to-be truncated US-91 with several other numbers: SR-163 (renumbered SR-78 in the 1977 renumbering) from the split west of Levan east to that town, an extension of SR-28 from Levan to a proposed interchange with I-15 two miles (3.2km) south of Sheep Lane, and State Route 41 from another interchange one-half mile (0.8km) south of Sheep Lane through Nephi to {{the north end of}} the bypass. The approximately [...] piece of old US-91 between the two interchanges would become a local road. The state legislature extended SR-41 north along old US-91 through Mona in 1969, taking it to a proposed interchange near Rocky Ridge Road, and in 1971 the State Road Commission agreed that, once the bypass of Mona was complete, SR-41 would be truncated back to its 1968 terminus, with a short connection between Mona and I-15 at exit 233 becoming SR-54. The legislature and commission carried out this change in 1975, with SR-41 now running north to a <b>temporary</b> <b>connection</b> with I-15 about one mile (1.5km) north of Country Road. (When I-15 was built, it was truncated slightly to exit 228 near Country Road.) ...|$|E
60|$|There is not {{the least}} {{reason to believe that}} a branch which has borne seed or fruit {{directly}} modified by foreign pollen is itself affected, so as afterwards to produce modified buds; such an occurrence, from the <b>temporary</b> <b>connection</b> of the flower with the stem, would be hardly possible. Hence, but very few, if any, of the cases of bud-variation in the fruit of trees, given {{in the early part of}} this chapter can be accounted for by the action of foreign pollen; for such fruits have commonly been propagated by budding or grafting. It is also obvious that changes of colour in flowers, which necessarily supervene long before they are ready for fertilisation, and changes in the shape or colour of leaves, when due to the appearance of modified buds, can have no relation to the action of foreign pollen.|$|E

40|$|For years, power {{distribution}} companies (DISCOMs) have {{been struggling to}} cope with the anarchy at rural feeders which heightens during the peak irrigation period, with both farmers and non-farmer community suffering alike. One of the ways to tackle this situation is to give more power hours to farmers during the peak season which a few companies do. While states like Gujarat and Punjab opted for feeder separation to improve rural power quality, West Bengal and Madhya Pradesh have resorted to giving <b>temporary</b> <b>connections</b> to farmers during peak irrigation period. This paper analyses whether the <b>temporary</b> agricultural <b>connections</b> mitigate the anarchy during peak demand period and how.

60|$|This {{plan was}} thus only {{partially}} successful, and Hannibal devised a more effectual method {{for the remainder}} of the troop. He built an immensely large raft, floated it up to the shore, fastened it there securely, and covered it with earth, turf, and bushes, so as to make it resemble a projection of the land. He then caused a second raft to be constructed of the same size, and this he brought up to the outer edge of the other, fastened it there by a <b>temporary</b> <b>connection,</b> and covered and concealed it as he had done the first. The first of these rafts extended two hundred feet from the shore, and was fifty feet broad. The other, that is, the outer one, was only a little smaller. The soldiers then contrived to allure and drive the elephants over these rafts to the outer one, the animals imagining that they had not left the land. The two rafts were then disconnected from each other, and the outer one began to move with its bulky passengers over the water, towed by a number of boats which had previously been attached to its outer edge.|$|E
60|$|Now let us {{endeavour}} {{to imagine}} (what {{it is very}} probable may occur in future ages) that a slow upheaval of {{the bed of the}} Atlantic should take place, {{while at the same time}} earthquake-shocks and volcanic action on the land should cause increased volumes of sediment to be poured down by the rivers, so that the two continents should gradually spread out by the addition of newly-formed lands, and thus reduce the Atlantic which now separates them, to an arm of the sea a few hundred miles wide. At the same time we may suppose islands to be upheaved in mid-channel; and, as the subterranean forces varied in intensity, and shifted their points of greatest action, these islands would sometimes become connected with the land on one side or other of the strait, and at other times again be separated from it. Several islands would at one time be joined together, at another would be broken up again, until at last, after many long ages of such intermittent action, we might have an irregular archipelago of islands filling up the ocean channel of the Atlantic, in whose appearance and arrangement we could discover nothing to tell us which had been connected with Africa and which with America. The animals and plants inhabiting these islands would, however, certainly reveal this portion of their former history. On those islands which had ever formed a part of the South American continent, we should be sure to find such common birds as chatterers and toucans and hummingbirds, and some of the peculiar American quadrupeds; while on those which had been separated from Africa, hornbills, orioles, and honeysuckers would as certainly be found. Some portion of the upraised land might at different times have had a <b>temporary</b> <b>connection</b> with both continents, and would then contain a certain amount of mixture in its living inhabitants. Such seems to have been the case with the islands of Celebes and the Philippines. Other islands, again, though in such close proximity as Bali and Lombock, might each exhibit an almost unmixed sample of the productions of the continents of which they had directly or indirectly once formed a part.|$|E

40|$|One of {{the main}} {{challenges}} of Delay-Tolerant Networks (DTNs) is on how to define effective routing protocols. Contrarily to traditional networks, which use static routing protocols and guarantee end-to-end paths between nodes of the network, connectivity is intermittent in DTNs. A routing path between two nodes is dynamically built over the time, i. e., a connection between two intermediate nodes of a routing path is not necessarily established beforehand. Hence, it may happen that {{at a given time}} or period there is no direct path between two given nodes, however further future <b>temporary</b> <b>connections</b> between some intermediary nodes may provide a path over time, also called journey, between those two nodes. <b>Temporary</b> <b>connections</b> between nodes, denoted contacts, is thus strongly exploited by DTN routing protocols for message delivery. A DTN routing protocol must carefully select journeys between nodes for performance’s sake. Usually routing takes place using a store and forward mechanism and depends on several parameters such as time of request, availability of connectivity, message size, network traffic, transmission delay, etc. Moreover, different metrics can be exploited for supporting routing decisions like the number of hops between the given nodes, the arriva...|$|R
