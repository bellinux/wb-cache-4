5|$|The {{superior}} parathyroid glands {{receive their}} blood from <b>the</b> <b>inferior</b> thyroid arteries. <b>The</b> <b>inferior</b> parathyroid glands receive a variable blood supply, {{from either the}} ascending branch of <b>the</b> <b>inferior</b> thyroid arteries or the thyroid ima artery. <b>The</b> <b>inferior</b> thyroid artery arises from the subclavian arteries.|$|E
5|$|Connecting the {{cerebellum}} {{to different}} parts of the nervous system are three paired cerebellar peduncles. These are the superior cerebellar peduncle, the middle cerebellar peduncle and <b>the</b> <b>inferior</b> cerebellar peduncle, named by their position relative to the vermis. The superior cerebellar peduncle is mainly an output to the cerebral cortex, carrying efferent fibers via thalamic nuclei to upper motor neurons in the cerebral cortex. The fibers arise from the deep cerebellar nuclei. The middle cerebellar peduncle is connected to the pons and receives all of its input from the pons mainly from the pontine nuclei. The input to the pons is from the cerebral cortex and is relayed from the pontine nuclei via transverse pontine fibers to the cerebellum. The middle peduncle is the largest of the three and its afferent fibers are grouped into three separate fascicles taking their inputs to {{different parts of}} the cerebellum. <b>The</b> <b>inferior</b> cerebellar peduncle receives input from afferent fibers from the vestibular nuclei, spinal cord and the tegmentum. Output from <b>the</b> <b>inferior</b> peduncle is via efferent fibers to the vestibular nuclei and the reticular formation. The whole of the cerebellum receives modulatory input from <b>the</b> <b>inferior</b> olivary nucleus via <b>the</b> <b>inferior</b> cerebellar peduncle.|$|E
5|$|The thyroid is {{supplied}} with arterial {{blood from the}} superior thyroid artery, {{a branch of the}} external carotid artery, and <b>the</b> <b>inferior</b> thyroid artery, a branch of the thyrocervical trunk, and sometimes by an anatomical variant the thyroid ima artery, which has a variable origin. The superior thyroid artery splits into anterior and posterior branches supplying the thyroid, and <b>the</b> <b>inferior</b> thyroid artery splits into superior and inferior branches. The superior and inferior thyroid arteries join together behind the outer part of the thyroid lobes. The venous blood is drained via superior and middle thyroid veins, which drain to the internal jugular vein, and via <b>the</b> <b>inferior</b> thyroid veins. <b>The</b> <b>inferior</b> thyroid veins originate in a network of veins and drain into the left and right brachiocephalic veins. Both arteries and veins form a plexus between the two layers of the capsule of the thyroid gland.|$|E

5|$|Parathyroid glands share {{a similar}} blood supply, venous {{drainage}}, and lymphatic drainage to the thyroid glands.

The relative position of <b>the</b> <b>inferior</b> and superior glands, which are named according to their final location, changes because of the migration of embryological tissues.|$|E

The working group consisted of 208 students who study at Uludağ University Faculty of Education, Physical Education and Sport Department in the 2005 - 2006 academic year. The research has been designed as descriptive research. The material used in this research is Social Skills Inventory (SSI).

5|$|The vagus nerves, {{from which}} the {{recurrent}} laryngeal nerves branch, exit the skull at the jugular foramen and travel within the carotid sheath alongside the carotid arteries through the neck. The recurrent laryngeal nerves branch off the vagus, the left at the aortic arch, and the right at the right subclavian artery. The left RLN passes {{in front of the}} arch, and then wraps underneath and behind it. After branching, the nerves typically ascend in a groove at the junction of the trachea and esophagus. They then pass behind the posterior, middle part of the outer lobes of the thyroid gland and enter the larynx underneath <b>the</b> <b>inferior</b> constrictor muscle, passing into the larynx just posterior to the cricothyroid joint. The terminal branch is called <b>the</b> <b>inferior</b> laryngeal nerve.|$|E
5|$|Based on {{findings}} correlating mirror neuron {{activity and}} mu wave suppression in individuals with autism as in typically developing individuals, {{studies have examined}} both the development of mirror neurons and therapeutic means for stimulating the system. A recent study has found that fMRI activation magnitudes in <b>the</b> <b>inferior</b> frontal gyrus increase with age in people with autism. This finding was not apparent in typically developing individuals. Furthermore, greater activation was associated with greater amounts of eye contact and better social functioning. Scientists believe <b>the</b> <b>inferior</b> frontal gyrus {{is one of the}} main neural correlates with the mirror neuron system in humans and is often related to deficits associated with autism. These findings suggest that the mirror neuron system may not be non-functional in individuals with autism, but simply abnormal in its development. This information is significant to the present discussion because mu waves may be integrating different areas of mirror neuron activity in the brain. Other studies have assessed attempts to consciously stimulate the mirror neuron system and suppress mu waves using neurofeedback (a type of biofeedback given through computers that analyze real time recordings of brain activity, in this case EEGs of mu waves). This type of therapy is still in its early phases of implementation for individuals with autism, and has conflicting forecasts for success.|$|E
