5|$|In May 2011, all 24,091 C3 Picassos in the UK were {{recalled}} for {{a safety}} modification, following complaints and {{an investigation by}} BBC consumer affairs programme Watchdog into brakes that could be activated on <b>the</b> <b>passenger</b> <b>side</b> of the right-hand drive vehicles.|$|E
5|$|Penny {{attended}} Castilleja School until 1977. She {{graduated with}} a Bachelor of Arts in economics from Harvard College in 1981. The following year, Penny's mother died after falling out of <b>the</b> <b>passenger</b> <b>side</b> of a tow truck. Penny returned to school, earning both a Juris Doctor and a Masters of Business Administration from Stanford University in 1985.|$|E
5|$|The problem {{occurred}} {{because of the}} way the vehicles were modified for right-hand-drive. The investigation showed that although the brake pedal had been moved to the right, it was still connected to a mechanism on <b>the</b> <b>passenger</b> <b>side.</b> This was covered by felt carpet and meant that both the front passenger and driver could activate the brakes. A further investigation by Watchdog later found the same problem in other Citroën models and some vehicles produced by Renault and Peugeot, some of which were registered in 2002. All three manufacturers worked with the Vehicle and Operator Services Agency (VOSA) to identify the severity of the problem but no vehicles were found to be affected enough to issue recalls.|$|E

50|$|Air-conditioning {{was never}} an option on right-hand-drive Saxos because the blower motor was mounted in the bulk-head on the driver's side. As a result, there was {{insufficient}} space available to accommodate the evaporator, except by first ducting the air flow to <b>the</b> <b>passenger's</b> <b>side</b> {{and then at the}} expense of the glove-box. Although an after-market kit was available that did exactly this, the resultant pressure loss made the system noisy and ineffective. The blower motor could also not be easily relocated, since the windscreen wiper motor was mounted in <b>the</b> <b>passenger's</b> <b>side</b> space.|$|R
5|$|The {{secondary}} rivalry {{was between}} The Undertaker and Mr. Kennedy. On the September 8, 2006 episode of SmackDown!, Kennedy {{announced that he}} was looking for a new opponent, one that he had never faced before. Long informed Kennedy that he knew a SmackDown! superstar that had never faced Kennedy, The Undertaker. A match was made between the two for No Mercy, in which Kennedy defeated Undertaker by disqualification. At Survivor Series, Kennedy once again defeated Undertaker in a First Blood match. On the December 1 episode of SmackDown!, Undertaker fought Montel Vontavious Porter (MVP) in a match where neither wrestler won. During the match, MVP was scripted to attempt escaping from the ring, but Kennedy caught him during the process and tried to throw him back into the ring. MVP instead threw Kennedy in. Undertaker then kicked Kennedy in the face, and Kane attacked MVP at ringside. The following week as Kennedy was in the ring, the hearse, appearing to have nobody in the driver's seat, drove into the arena; suddenly, The Undertaker appeared from the back of the hearse, as Kennedy sprung from the ring. Later that night, Kane defeated Kennedy by disqualification after MVP interfered on Kennedy's behalf. On the December 15 episode of SmackDown!, The Undertaker and Kane teamed together to face Kennedy and MVP in a tag team match, which ended in neither team winning. Kennedy knocked Kane down in the aisle and jumped into the driver's seat of the hearse that had been at ringside for the match, and threatened to run him over with it however the Undertaker appeared in <b>the</b> <b>passenger</b> <b>side</b> seat scaring Kennedy off.|$|E
25|$|To {{minimize}} {{production costs}} for export, {{the windshield wipers}} used a pattern where the wipers started {{in the center and}} wiped towards the edge of the windshield, instead of from <b>the</b> <b>passenger</b> <b>side</b> towards the driver.|$|E
25|$|Once Bland {{is out of}} her car, {{the officer}} orders her to put down her cell phone and tells her {{she is going to}} jail. In response, Bland asks why. In the video, both Bland and the officer move to <b>the</b> <b>passenger</b> <b>side</b> of the vehicle and are no longer visible, while they {{continue}} to argue heatedly. Bland can be heard crying and screaming.|$|E
5000|$|Options {{available}} at extra cost included velour carpeting, grab handles for <b>the</b> <b>passengers</b> in <b>the</b> back, whitewall tires, a two tone paint finish {{and even a}} [...] "make-up mirror" [...] cleverly incorporated into the sun-visor on <b>the</b> <b>passenger's</b> <b>side.</b>|$|R
50|$|As in {{previous}} years, the Top 40 Qualifying cars eligible to start, must have flashing lights installed (for better {{identification of the}} Top 40 competitors) behind the windscreen on <b>the</b> <b>passenger’s</b> <b>side.</b>|$|R
50|$|Each car is {{numbered}} (1 to 100), with a 348 Serie Speciale {{plate on}} <b>the</b> <b>passenger's</b> <b>side</b> door-post.In 1994, a further 15 units were produced, {{bringing the total}} production of this limited edition to 115.|$|R
25|$|An air bag is {{a safety}} feature {{designed}} to protect automobile passengers in a head-on collision. Most cars today have driver's side airbags and many have one on <b>the</b> <b>passenger</b> <b>side</b> as well. Located in the steering wheel assembly on the driver's side and in the dashboard on <b>the</b> <b>passenger</b> <b>side,</b> the air bag device responds within milliseconds of a crash. The original safety cushion was first created by John W. Hetrick in 1952. After a car accident that his family was involved in, Hetrick drew sketches of compressed air stored in a container. When a spring-loaded weight senses the car decelerating at a rapid enough rate, it opens a valve that allows the pressure in the container to fill a bag. With this knowledge, he developed his design until {{he was able to}} obtain a patent on the device on August 5, 1952. Later in 1967, Dr. Allen S. Breed invented and developed a key component for automotive use in 1967, the ball-in-tube inertial sensor for crash detection. Breed Corporation then marketed this innovation to Chrysler.|$|E
25|$|Mounting base: Attaches the {{mounting}} {{system to the}} vehicle. This element is commonly composed of rugged materials such as steel. Tunnel Mounts attach to the raised floor area (drive shaft tunnel) between the driver and passenger. Passenger Side Mounts attach to floor on <b>the</b> <b>passenger</b> <b>side</b> of the vehicle. Console mounting brackets attach to an existing vehicle center console. Trunk Mounts provide mounting options for use inside car trunks.|$|E
25|$|The {{effect that}} {{windshield}} wipers {{have on a}} vehicles airflow varies between vehicles; however, they are often omitted from race vehicles and high efficiency concepts {{in order to maintain}} the smallest possible coefficient of drag. A much more common option is to replace the windshield wipers with lower profile wipers, or to only remove the windshield wiper on <b>the</b> <b>passenger</b> <b>side</b> of the vehicle, and even to fabricate a deflector to deflect the air up and over the wipers.|$|E

50|$|The interior, {{like the}} {{exterior}} and chassis, is made entirely of carbon fiber. There are four screens: {{one on the}} driver's side of the dashboard, one on <b>the</b> <b>passenger's</b> <b>side</b> of <b>the</b> dashboard, one on the center console, {{and one on the}} steering wheel.|$|R
50|$|Cars sold from 1952 also {{featured}} a fuel-based passenger cabin heater. In order to ignite the heater {{it was necessary}} first to open a small tap in the engine bay, after which the flow of hot air could be regulated using a control in the footwell on <b>the</b> <b>passenger's</b> <b>side.</b>|$|R
25|$|On many {{automobile}} engines, {{including all}} Chrysler Group and General Motors products, the thermostat does not restrict {{flow to the}} heater core. <b>The</b> <b>passenger</b> <b>side</b> tank of the radiator {{is used as a}} bypass to the thermostat, flowing through the heater core. This prevents formation of steam pockets before the thermostat opens, and allows the heater to function before the thermostat opens. Another benefit is that there is still some flow through the radiator if the thermostat fails.|$|E
25|$|Early on July 31, 1977, Stacy Moskowitz and Robert Violante, both 20, were in Violante's car, {{which was}} parked under a streetlight near a city {{park in the}} {{neighborhood}} of Bath Beach. They were kissing when a man approached within three feet of <b>the</b> <b>passenger</b> <b>side</b> of Violante's car and fired four rounds into the car, striking both victims in the head before he escaped into the park. Moskowitz died several hours later in the hospital. Violante survived, although he lost vision in one eye and retained very limited vision in the other eye.|$|E
25|$|Bryant {{then moved}} back to <b>the</b> <b>passenger</b> <b>side</b> of the Corolla as Hall {{attempted}} to climb over to the driver's seat. Bryant raised his rifle and fired three shots, killing her. Many people around the service station witnessed this and ran to hide in nearby bushland. The service station attendant told everyone to lie down and he locked the main doors. He grabbed his rifle, {{but by the time}} he could retrieve some ammunition and load his gun, Bryant had left in the BMW. A police officer arrived several minutes later and then set out in pursuit of Bryant.|$|E
30|$|Since odd HGVs {{are more}} {{susceptible}} to accidents, Rwanda must enact new regulation making it compulsory for the foreign HGVs to be fitted with Fresnel lens or close proximity (Class V) mirror to <b>the</b> <b>passenger’s</b> <b>side</b> widow to resolve the blind spot which can otherwise hinder HGV drivers’ vision of other traffic.|$|R
50|$|Their car was {{reportedly}} traveling 130 km/h, when it veered into oncoming traffic lanes at the 60th kilometer of the Belgrade—Niš highway, colliding head-on with a FAP truck driven by 52-year-old Rastko Grujić. Armenulić {{had been sleeping}} in <b>the</b> <b>passenger's</b> <b>side</b> seat and her younger sister was asleep in the back seat.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: In {{one episode}} of I Was Impaled, a woman {{riding in a}} truck on a dirt road was impaled by a two-inch thick branch of an {{evergreen}} tree similar to this one which broke through <b>the</b> <b>passenger's</b> <b>side</b> window; <b>the</b> branch penetrated her neck and shoulder, but she was saved by medical personnel.|$|R
25|$|Steel {{supports}} {{around the}} quarter lights allowed the windscreen {{to be both}} more steeply raked and moved forwards to provide more interior room. This also allowed a properly sprung bench-type rear seat to be fitted capable of seating two adults. The front seats were adjustable for position and <b>the</b> <b>passenger</b> <b>side</b> now folded much further forward than on previous models to allow easier access to the rear, although the doors were still felt to be too narrow for easy entry. Controls were similar to the Mark F, but the fuel tap was now moved from beneath the bonnet to under the dash. Doors were now lockable and included wind-up windows.|$|E
25|$|Most jurisdictions permit rear {{fog lamps}} to be {{installed}} either singly or in pairs. If a single rear fog is fitted, most jurisdictions require it to be located at or to the driver's side of the vehicle's centreline—whichever side is the prevailing driver's side {{in the country in}} which the vehicle is registered. This is to maximize the sight line of following drivers to the rear fog lamp. In many cases, a single reversing lamp is mounted on <b>the</b> <b>passenger</b> <b>side</b> of the vehicle, positionally symmetrical with the rear fog. If two {{rear fog lamps}} are fitted, they must be symmetrical with respect to the vehicle's centreline.|$|E
25|$|The third-generation RX comes {{standard}} with a twin-chamber {{front passenger}} airbags, side torso airbags {{for the front}} row, side curtain airbags for front and rear rows, and knee airbags for the front row. Active headrests become standard to help reduce whiplash injuries. Vehicle Stability Control (VSC) and Hill Assist Control (HAC) which helps prevent the vehicle from rolling backwards on inclines are standard while a more advanced Vehicle Dynamics Integrated Management (VDIM) system is optional. VDIM {{is designed to be}} more subtle and less intrusive in performance than VSC alone, VDIM can also engage prior to an actual skid taking place acting as a preventative measure. The Adaptive Front-lighting System (AFS) remains optional, while a new bi-xenon optional Intelligent Highbeam feature is added, this system can dim the high-beams automatically whenever traffic is detected. Other optional safety features include a Pre-Collision System (PCS) and a Head-up Display (HUD) which helps the driver keep attention on the road ahead by displaying navigation, speed, and audio information on the windshield; the HUD uses high-intensity LEDs displaying high contrast white figures on the windshield allowing it to be read in direct sunlight. The optional navigation system offers a backup camera and a Wide-View Side Monitor utilizes a camera on <b>the</b> <b>passenger</b> <b>side</b> view mirror to help eliminate blind spots on <b>the</b> <b>passenger</b> <b>side</b> at low speeds, this system does not include the 180° wide-angle front camera found in the LX 570. To further help improve visibility, water-repellent glass is used on the front doors.|$|E
6000|$|The {{gathering}} {{shadows of}} night fall fast; [...] The lamps {{in the street}} are lit; [...] To the roof have the eerie footsteps passed, [...] Where <b>the</b> outside <b>passengers</b> sit. [...] To <b>the</b> <b>passenger's</b> <b>side</b> has <b>the</b> spectre paced; [...] For a moment he halts, they say, [...] Then a ring from the punch at the unseen waist, [...] And the footsteps pass away.|$|R
50|$|In other cases, {{evacuation}} may be via <b>the</b> vehicle <b>passenger</b> <b>side</b> {{doors to}} a trackside walkway in a tunnel, {{without the use}} of a detrainment device.|$|R
50|$|The {{chassis built}} of channel-section steel has {{cable-operated}} four-wheel brakes and it rides on half-elliptic springs. The 26-inch wire wheels take tyres of 3.50-inch section. (by December the car tested had 27 x 4.00-inch tyres) The car {{is to be}} complete with all accessories including an engine starter. The central brake lever works a transmission brake {{at the back of}} the gearbox. The bucket-type front seats are adjustable, <b>the</b> <b>passenger's</b> <b>side</b> folds and tips.|$|R
25|$|On October 17, Labonte {{announced}} the GEICO 500 {{is to be}} his 890th and final start. To commemorate the occasion, Go Fas Racing designed a car split into three designs: the Kellogg's design from his 1996 title run on the driver side, the Piedmont Airlines design from his 1984 championship year on <b>the</b> <b>passenger</b> <b>side,</b> and the Duck Industries design from his early career in the center. However, NASCAR did not allow the scheme, due to a rule stating cars must have the same colors on both the driver side and passenger {{side of the car}} for safety reasons; the team would switch to the former design, while being allowed to retain the center. Labonte qualified ninth, but because of the unapproved paint scheme, was forced to start {{at the tail end of}} the field. He would finish in thirty-third place, one lap down in his final race.|$|E
25|$|Just {{before midnight}} on July 4, 1969, Darlene Ferrin and Michael Mageau {{drove into the}} Blue Rock Springs Park in Vallejo, four miles from the Lake Herman Road murder site, and parked. While the couple sat in Ferrin's car, a second car drove into the lot and parked {{alongside}} them but almost immediately drove away. Returning about 10 minutes later, this second car parked behind them. The driver of the second car then exited the vehicle, approaching <b>the</b> <b>passenger</b> <b>side</b> door of Ferrin's car, carrying a flashlight and a 9mm Luger. The killer directed the flashlight into Mageau's and Ferrin's eyes before shooting at them, firing five times. Both victims were hit, and several bullets had passed through Mageau and into Ferrin. The killer {{walked away from the}} car but upon hearing Mageau's moaning, returned and shot each victim twice more before driving off.|$|E
25|$|Ibrahim Bako (then Director of the Army Faculty at the Armed Forces Command {{and staff}} College, Jaji) and acting GOC 1 Mechanised Division, Kaduna, was tasked by the coup conspirators with arresting President Shehu Shagari presumably after Shagari's Brigade of Guards had been {{neutralized}} (without violence as planned) by Col Tunde Ogbeha. Author Max Siollun notes that Bako {{was chosen for}} the arresting role because Bako's father was a personal friend to Shagari. Unknown to Bako {{was the fact that}} the coup plot had been leaked to President Shagari, whose guards were on high alert. After arriving at the Presidential residence (in non-military attire) with an armed detachment to arrest the President, Bako was shot dead while sitting in <b>the</b> <b>passenger</b> <b>side</b> of a Unimog utility truck in an ensuing firefight between troops from Bako's detachment and the Brigade of Guards soldiers under the command of Captain Augustine Anyogo. The Unimog utility truck that Bako was killed in is on display at the Nigerian Army Museum in Zaria, Nigeria.|$|E
50|$|In his confession, Beach {{alleged that}} he choked Nees, but an autopsy found no {{indication}} of strangulation. Beach also claimed that after the murder, he wiped his fingerprints from the truck, but many fingerprints, four palm prints and one bloody palm print {{were found on the}} truck, none of which belonged to Nees or Beach. Finally, Beach said that Nees tried to escape from the driver’s side door, but the bloody palm print was on <b>the</b> <b>passenger’s</b> <b>side.</b>|$|R
5000|$|On 7 August 2006, Hüseyin Başbilen, a 31-year-old {{mechanical}} engineer working {{for ten years}} at Aselsan as a production engineer, {{was found dead in}} his car at Pursaklar, Ankara. His left wrist and throat were cut, his head was under the glove compartment on <b>the</b> <b>passenger's</b> <b>side</b> and his feet were up on the driver's seat. In 2009, a court ruled that it was suicide. In 2011, the case was reopened as part of the [...] "Ergenekon" [...] investigation.|$|R
25|$|In frustration, Ryan forced Mitchinson to back off, {{then got}} out of <b>the</b> <b>passenger's</b> <b>side</b> door and noticed Walker running towards him, being chased by Hodson who was holding the pipe in his hand. Walker was {{shouting}} frantically to Ryan that prison guard William Bennett, standing on the Number 2 prison tower, had his rifle aimed at them. At this time, Hodson was chasing Walker, Ryan {{took a couple of}} steps forward and raised his rifle and aimed it at Hodson.|$|R
