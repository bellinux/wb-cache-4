5|$|Should {{the player}} choose {{to fulfill the}} promise, the protagonist begins her sophomore year at St. PigeoNation's largely as normal, but with one exception—she begins to have {{recurring}} dreams of her younger self and Ryouta, and her parents lying dead {{in front of an}} unfamiliar house. A mysterious man approaches them, promising to grant any wish that they make. On 2 September, she decides to check on Ryouta, who had gone to the infirmary earlier that day; the next morning, she fails to show up for class. Kazuaki asks Ryouta to retrieve their class' box of print handouts, and upon retrieving it, blood is discovered leaking from a corner of the box. Ryouta opens the lid, and it is revealed that the box contains the protagonist's severed head. A siren sounds and there is an order to evacuate to the gymnasium, where Ryouta overhears other students mention that more pieces of a human corpse were found in the other print boxes. Doubting the headmaster's explanation of a natural disaster occurring, Sakuya and Ryouta resolve to figure out the identity of the protagonist's killer and leave the gymnasium, discovering a large metal dome surrounding the school. Upon returning to <b>their</b> <b>classroom</b> and finding the box empty, Yuuya explains that the protagonist's body had been gathered in the chemistry lab, where Shuu performs an autopsy concluding that the protagonist died of asphyxiation caused by illness or poison with the dismemberment occurring afterwards.|$|E
25|$|Research {{has also}} shown a {{correlation}} between goal orientation and the occurrence of academic cheating. Students who perceive <b>their</b> <b>classroom</b> to have high mastery goals {{are less likely to}} engage in cheating than those who perceive <b>their</b> <b>classroom</b> to emphasize performance goals. In other words, students who are encouraged to learn for the sake of learning and who exhibit an intrinsic value of education are less likely to cheat than those who are encouraged primarily by grades and other extrinsic rewards.|$|E

40|$|This file {{was last}} viewed in Adobe Reader XThe {{following}} quantitative research descriptive {{study was conducted}} in the area of differentiation with the focus being the differentiation methods/strategies. Differentiation is defined as teachers meeting the individual interests and abilities of students within <b>their</b> <b>classrooms.</b> Teachers were asked during a pre-survey various questions regarding their current knowledge of differentiation terms and how often it is used within <b>their</b> <b>classrooms.</b> Another pre-survey asked teachers which methods/strategies are currently used within <b>their</b> <b>classrooms</b> or <b>their</b> familiarity with them. Four differentiation presentations were held during a course of two weeks. An overview of differentiation and methods/strategies were discussed, along with ideas associated with differentiation. About a month following the presentations teachers were asked to fill out a post-survey. About half of the teachers responded with the post-survey. Teachers showed an increased knowledge in differentiation methods/strategies {{that can be used in}} <b>their</b> <b>classrooms.</b> Teachers also took various assessment strategies away from the presentations that can be used to assess their students...|$|R
25|$|George Wesley Bellows {{was born}} and raised in Columbus, Ohio. He was the only child of George Bellows and Anna Wilhelmina Smith Bellows (he had a half-sister, Laura, 18 years his senior). He was born four years after his parents married, at the ages of fifty (George) and forty (Anna). His mother was the {{daughter}} of a whaling captain based in Sag Harbor, Long Island, and his family returned there for their summer vacations.

25|$|The {{children}} are turning <b>their</b> <b>classroom</b> into Dinosaur Land for Parents' Night, {{as they are}} studying dinosaurs. Ms Frizzle receives a letter from an old high school friend {{who is now a}} paleontologist and she decides to take the class on a trip to the dig. When she discovers that they are missing the bones of some Maiasaurs, she turns the bus into a time machine to travel back to the age of dinosaurs to find the bones. The class sees dinosaurs and learns the name of the different periods of the era and other information. This is the first time Ms Frizzle's first name is mentioned, and it is the first appearance of Carlos Ramon and Keesha Franklin, although Keesha was first seen in The Magic School Bus: On the Ocean Floor.|$|E
25|$|Nine-year-old Cassie Logan {{is walking}} {{to school with}} her {{siblings}} Stacey (twelve years old), Christopher-John (seven years old), and Little Man whose real name is Clayton Chester Logan (six years old) in rural Mississippi. Cassie talks about the land on which the Logan family lives. It belonged to Harlan Granger, but he sold 2000 acres of it in 1886 to cover his taxes during Reconstruction. Their grandfather bought two hundred acres in 1887, then another two hundred acres in 1918. After several miles of walking, T.J. Avery and his brother appear. The Avery family sharecrop on the Granger plantation. At school, Cassie and Little Man go to <b>their</b> <b>classroom,</b> where Cassie's teacher, Daisy Crocker, gives them their textbooks, worn-out, outdated castoffs from the white school with a chart that says only white kids used these books up until they were in bad condition, indicating their future uses are intended only for black students. Crocker meets with Cassie's mother, Mary, who calmly glues {{a piece of paper}} over the chart containing the racist indicator in all the books. She hands them back to a dumbstruck Crocker. That Saturday their father, David Logan, comes home from his railroad job in Louisiana, bringing with him L.T. Morrison to assist in planting, farming, protection and other jobs, as Morrison was fired from the railroad for a fight that was the white men's fault. Papa leaves the next day to catch a train.|$|E

500|$|Several critics {{wrote that}} [...] Portal 2 excels in {{teaching}} the player to solve puzzles; {{in a review}} for the New York Times, Seth Schiesel wrote, [...] "Somewhere out there an innovative, dynamic high school physics teacher will use Portal 2 as the linchpin of an entire series of lessons and will immediately {{become the most important}} science teacher those lucky students have ever had." [...] Mathematics and science teachers wrote e-mails to Valve to tell them how they had included Portal in <b>their</b> <b>classroom</b> lessons as part of a project to promote the [...] "gamification of learning". Portal developers Joshua Weier and Yasser Malaika led a team within Valve to explore ways of using Portal 2 for education. This {{led to the development of}} Puzzle Maker, a level editor for Portal 2 players, built from the professional tools used to develop the game. Weier and Malaika did not want to design curricula themselves, but wanted to provide educators with tools for creating lesson plans. Hammer, the only tool freely available before the release of the built-in level editor in 2012, was difficult for educators to learn and understand. Valve gave Puzzle Maker an easy-to-learn interface and the ability to share puzzles and lesson plans. The tools were developed with a mathematics teacher and her students. This formed the basis of a new [...] "Steam for Schools" [...] initiative launched in June 2012, under which educators could acquire Portal 2 and the Puzzle Maker software free of charge for classroom use through its [...] "Teach with Portals" [...] program. , Valve estimates that over 2,500 educators are using the [...] "Teach with Portals" [...] software within their lesson plans.|$|E

However, Searle also argued that tenured professors be reviewed every seven years to help eliminate [...] "incompetent" [...] teachers who can otherwise find refuge in the tenure system.|$|E

Levitt also states that teachers may inflate the results of tests given in <b>their</b> <b>classroom.</b> Teachers and librarians can have a significant proactive impact on doing honest work.|$|E

2500|$|The term [...] "Gifted Assessment" [...] is {{typically}} applied [...] {{to a process}} of using norm-referenced psychometric tests administered by a qualified psychologist or psychometrist {{with the goal of}} identifying children whose intellectual functioning is significantly advanced as compared to the appropriate reference group (i.e., individuals of their age, gender, and country). The cut-off score for differentiating this group is usually determined by district school boards and can differ slightly from area to area, however, the majority defines this group as students scoring in the top 2 percentiles on one of the accepted tests of intellectual (cognitive) functioning or IQ. Some school boards also require a child to demonstrate advanced academic standing on individualized achievement tests and/ or through <b>their</b> <b>classroom</b> performance. Identifying gifted children is often difficult but is very important because typical school teachers are not qualified to educate a gifted student. This can lead to a situation where a gifted child is bored, underachieves and misbehaves in class.|$|E
