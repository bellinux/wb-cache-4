Wide fluctuations occurring in the hardness and size distribution of feed materials <b>to</b> <b>regrinding</b> mills result in a nonuniform product fineness and processing inefficiency. Using a previously developed regrinding model, this paper presents the dynamic analysis and design considerations of a control system for open-circuit grinding, using the traditional P-, PI-, and PID-control algorithms.

40|$|In this study, the {{differences}} between the separation of chalcopyrite and chalcocite from pyrite in cleaner flotation after regrinding were investigated. In the rougher flotation prior <b>to</b> <b>regrinding,</b> high chalcopyrite and chalcocite recovery were obtained in conjunction with high pyrite flotation recovery due to the activation of pyrite by copper ions during primary grinding. The rougher flotation concentrate was reground in a rod mill before cleaner flotation. It was found that chalcopyrite and chalcocite exhibited different flotation behavior and also affected pyrite flotation differently in cleaner flotation. The mechanism underpinning these phenomena was investigated by a range of techniques including the polarization of mineral electrodes, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses and ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) extraction. It was found that the flotation behavior of both copper minerals and their effect on pyrite flotation after regrinding were governed by their electrochemical activities and galvanic coupling with pyrite.

40|$|Stirred mills {{have been}} widely used for {{regrinding}} and are more energy efficient than tumbling mills. These two types of mills present different particle breakage mechanisms and redox environments during grinding. In this study, the effect of regrinding with these two types of mills on the separation of chalcopyrite from pyrite in the cleaner stage was studied. A laboratory rod mill and a laboratory stirred mill were used <b>to</b> <b>regrind</b> rougher flotation concentrates. It was found that chalcopyrite and pyrite exhibited different flotation behavior after regrinding with the rod mill and the stirred mill, resulting in different separability of chalcopyrite from pyrite. The mechanism underpinning this phenomenon was investigated by a range of techniques including dissolved oxygen demand measurements, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Time of flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS). It was found that the two mills produced different surface oxidation and pyrite activation by copper ions which determined the separation of chalcopyrite from pyrite. This study demonstrates that the selection of a regrind mill should not only depend on its energy efficiency but also the property of surfaces produced for subsequent flotation...|$|E

On one hand, such multi-tool setups offer the advantages of reduced down-time and cost of production and require less space and in-process inventory, {{and on the other}} hand, require proper tool management for economic operations. A number of strategies have been devised to solve the tool selection problems and a number of tool replacement policies have been proposed in the past. These strategies have been solved in isolation, whereas, a comprehensive algorithm for proper selection of tools out of those available in the tool magazine for performing operation and for replacement of tools on failure/wear is necessary. In this paper, taking cue from the computer memory management policies, four tool selection strategies have been presented and their performance in tandem with various tool replacement policies has been studied. The effect of important parameters such as reduction of tool life due <b>to</b> <b>regrinding,</b> limited number of regrindings, catastrophic failures etc. have been considered.

40|$|Issue: Contamination {{limits the}} {{ultimate}} marketability {{of the full}} range of PET plastic containers collected by local recycling programs. Contamination reduces the value of recyclable PET; it hinders processing and causes unproductive downtime and clean-up expenses for PET processors, reclaimers and end-users; and, it results in unnecessary manufacturing waste from the PET recycling process. Background: Intermediate plastic processors take in baled (and in some cases loose) plastic containers that have been separated from other recycable materials at MRFs, buyback or drop-off centers. Intermediate processors then granulate the containers for sale as “dirty <b>regrind</b> ” <b>to</b> reclaimers and end-users.

40|$|At Newcrest 2 ̆ 7 s Telfer gold mine, a {{strategy}} of regrinding pyrite rougher flotation concentrates has been proposed to incr ease gold recovery and reduce cyanide consumption in the CIL circuit. The r egrinding {{will be followed by}} an additional copper/ gold flotation stage, where copper minerals need to be separated from pyrite. However, although the minerals are well liberated, the separation of chalcopyrite from pyrite in the cleaner stage is not always straightforward. The surfaces of the fine particles, produced during regrinding, are more easily oxidised and contaminated than coarse particles, directly influencing the particle floatability. The depression of pyrite is difficult in the cleaner stage as well due to copper activation, a process which is also highly dependent on the grinding environment. In this study, different grinding media, including mild steel and stainless steel, was used in the <b>regrinding</b> <b>to</b> prod uce different regrinding chemistry, such as, pH, Eh, and iron hydr oxide contamination. The effects of regrinding conditions on chalcopyrite flotation and its separation from pyrite were studied. It was found that the stainless steel grinding media, which produced an oxidising environment, was more beneficial for the separation of chalcopyrite from pyrite after regrinding. The mild steel grinding media had a detrimental effect on both chalcopyrite and pyrite flotation. This study addresses the importance of choosing suitable regrinding conditions in the pyrite and copper flotation circuit...|$|R
40|$|Rail {{corrugation}} is {{a periodic}} wear pattern that develops {{on the wheel}} and rail contacting surfaces in railway systems. It is a commonly observed phenomenon worldwide and {{is a serious problem}} because it causes degradation of the track and its components and is a significant source of noise. Currently the only reliable method of ameliorating the negative effects of rail corrugation is <b>to</b> periodically <b>regrind</b> the rail surface to a smooth profile, at great expense to the railway operator. It is therefore of interest to investigate other possible control strategies to reduce corrugation growth through an understanding of the mechanism of corrugation formation. This thesis presents an investigation into the effect of speed variation on the corrugation formation mechanism. The research presented is intended to highlight the significant role that speed variation has on corrugation formation via a disruption of the feedback mechanism which leads to corrugation growth over successive train passages. This discovery motivates the investigation the feasibility of altered speed variation as a novel corrugation control method, due to the large effect that the variance of train speed has on corrugation growth rates. The effect of variable pass speed on corrugation formation has been investigated in this thesis through the use of efficient models of corrugation formation in straight track and cornering conditions. These models are simple enough to readily perform corrugation control studies without neglecting any relevant physics, obscuring the corrugation formation mechanism with overly detailed modelling or imposing a significant computational burden on performing control studies. These novel models have been outlined and their predictions elucidated in detail. A theoretical investigation into the effect of speed variation {{in the presence of a}} resonance free mechanism for corrugation growth via a contact filter has been performed and shown to only be important when the dynamic wavelength of formation approaches the size of the contact patch. The results of these corrugation models have been validated via test rig and field experiments. An investigation of the effectiveness of speed variation as a corrugation growth control measure has also been investigated via test rig experiments. The results of this thesis have formed the basis of an industry supported field trail of this technique for corrugation mitigation that is currently in progress...|$|R
40|$|Changes in {{the surface}} {{properties}} of minerals with grinding and regrinding {{play a key role}} in mineral flotation performance, being recognised in industry through the development of the IsaMill and Stirred Mill Detritor. This paper describes some initial results in a larger study which attempts to quantify changes in the flotation properties of sulphide minerals with regrinding using different mills. Pyrrhotite has been chosen in the current study due its importance in the recovery of Platinum Group Minerals and in its separation from pentlandite in Sudbury basin nickel ores. This current paper focuses on the results obtained using a Magotteaux Mill only. Factors which affected pyrrhotite flotation were particle size, grinding media contamination, and exposure of new mineral surface. Pyrrhotite recovery decreased with size reduction from 90 %, achieved before <b>regrinding,</b> <b>to</b> 77 %, 64 %, 30 % and 7 % after regrinding with stainless steel medium to d{ 80 } values of 60, 40, 20 and 10 m, respectively.

Increased collector addition only partially restored pyrrhotite recovery. The surface of the pyrrhotite mineral was changed by regrinding in a way that hindered collector adsorption onto the new mineral surface. A further dramatic depression of pyrrhotite recovery when using mild steel regrinding medium demonstrated that there was an additional contribution to pyrrhotite depression from media contamination in this case.

Many investigators have reported that the principal effect of pelleting is to in-crease the density of the feed, thus allow-ing greater feed intake and a resultant in-crease in rate of growth and efficiency of feed utilization. Others suggest that the pelleting process enhances the utilization of nutrients in the feed. Lindblad et al. (1955) observed an increase in rate of growth of chicks fed pelleted rations with-out increased consumption of feed. Allred et al. (1957 b) observed a growth response to pelleting even when the pellets were ground to a particle size and density similar to the original mash.

The primary goal was to find methods how the undesired output, plastic waste or scrap, could be eliminated. The Group’s target is to decrease the scrap percentage to 7. 5 % (in the year 2015 it was 10. 06 %). The secondary target was to study how scrap could be recycled inside the factory <b>to</b> valuable input, <b>regrind.</b> The current state of the core company was studied through participant and non-participant observation, through interviews and the analysis of the ERP- and BI-programs and also by working short periods in the production. Observation continued during {{the research}} and meant taking part in morning meetings and observing other daily operations. Numerical data showed the efficiency of the current extrusion process. Working in the production made it possible to see the production process from inside. The interviews and the analysis helped to discover the main development issues in the current state. Literature was used for surveying the requirements for the closed-loop system, for the concept of process-orientated thinking, elements of extrusion and for the study of plastics recycling. The literature about Lean-Philosophy was also important for this research. The most important results of the research concern development issues and recommendations of the raw material purchase, inventory and material management, the production process, recycling, information flows and daily management. Main problems were related to the lack of systematic and studied methods. Also the use of regrind requires scientifically studied and tested ratios, because its mechanical and processing properties (for instance MFI and bulk density) change during recycling. It was also noted that the performance of employees affects strongly the performance of the extrusion process due to its manual nature. The first recommendation is to correct issues relating to the sources of scrap because biggest financial benefits are related to it. Also the study on regrind ratios should start as soon as possible. This may require forming a project team due to the extent of the topic. The secondary proposal is to carry out issues that facilitate recycling and help to achieve a closed-loop system...|$|R
40|$|The final degree {{project for}} a Bachelor of Science in Mining and Mineral Engineering {{has been carried}} out at Boliden Mineral AB between April and June 2013. The report {{describes}} the history and geology of the mines of Boliden, origin and the development of one of the largest metal-mining companies in Europe - Boliden Mineral AB. In the Boliden area there are many important ore fields which contain gold, zinc, copper, silver and lead. The objective of this project was to investigate and provide the guidelines for the improvement of the regrinding in the ball mill in the Concentrator flotation circuit having influence on metal recovery. The report follows the ore flow from the mine, through the Concentrator and finally to the end product, concentrates. The evaluation leads to conclusions which parameters may affect the concentration process negative. It was discovered that there are problems with the ore stockpiles at the mine and the segregation of the fractions in the silos. It is proposed to install a cone {{on the top of the}} silos to reduce segregation of ore fractions. To reduce this problem Boliden should install a mobile conveyor on the way to the silos and to the ore stockpiles in the mine. This method has been successfully installed at the Aitik ore stockpiles near the new Concentrator. The main task of the thesis was to analyze metal distribution in the flotation circuit, especially technical analysis of regrinding effects on the results of flotation. The analysis of the sampled pulp from the flotation process was done in the Mineral Processing Laboratory and in the Process Laboratory in Boliden. The analytical equipment such as X-rays and ICP were used for metal analysis and QEMSCAN was used for mineralogical determinations analyses. Theoretical calculations and results of conducted laboratory experiments suggests that regrinding in the ball mill has a positive effect on the flotation process, but some improvement is required, especially the regrinding of the gangue particles. This process helps to liberate all metal particles and improves results of metal recovery. For improvement of regrinding process, it is proposed <b>to</b> replace the <b>regrinding</b> ball mill with a newer, more efficient mill of SMD type (Stirred Media Detritor).

40|$|Molybdenum is a {{versatile}} alloying and refractory metal of strategic importance. In India almost all molybdenite is obtained currently as st byproduct from copper and uranium deposits. The present Indian production {{is only about}} 66 tonnes while the demand is over 1000 tomes. It thus becomes important to explore newer deposits of molybdenum and develop efficient beneficiation strategies to recover the metal. A potential source of primary rnolybdenite {{has been found in}} the Ham area of Dharmapuri district in Tamil Nadu. In the present investigation, taking into consideration the importance of the problem beneficiation studies have been undertaken on core - drill molybdenite ore samples from the Hanu area. Initially, detailed characterization of the molybdenite ore has been carried out with respect to its mineralogy and chemical composition. The X-ray diffkactogam of the ore has also been recorded These studies have indicated that quartz and sericite are the major minerals followed by carbonates and feldspar. Among the sulphide minerals, pyrite is dominant with trace amounts of galena, sphalerite, chalcopyrite and molybdenite. The molybdenum content in the ore sample has been determined to be about 0. 1 %. Liberation studies have revealed that molybdenum is more or less uniformly distributed in the different size fractions from 1. 7 mm down below to 75 microns. However, mineralogical analysis of the different size fractions has indicated that about 85 % of the molybdenite is liberated. from associated silicate and carbonates below 2 12 microns. The results of the flotation kinetic tests have shown that percentage recovery and grade of molybdenum foLZow an inverse relationship with time. Studies carried out to evaluate different reagent - combinations, reveal that optimum values of grade and recovery could be achieved using kerosene and M 1 IBC. Further, these studies have shown that flotation time of 4 minutes is adequate, as beyond this time the grade of molybdenum is found to deteriorate. Detailed mesh-of-grind studies have indicated that 20 minutes of grinding yields optimum values of molybdenum and lead in the float product and this time was fixed for all subsequent experiments. Preliminary experiments conducted to evaluate djfferent depressants for galena have shown that satisfactory results are obtained only with sodium dichromate. Optimisation studies performed to arrive at the dosage of sodium dichromate have shown that the addition of 0. 25 kg/t of sodium dichromate gives optimum results with respect to overall recovery and grade of molybdenum, copper and lead in the float and tailing fractions. In a similar manner, the optimum dosage of kerosene (collector for molybdenite) has been arrived at to be 0. 8 kg/t taking a holistic view of the grades and recoveries of the different metal values of interest. Based on the studies carried out with respect to optimization of the mesh-of-grind, depressant and collector concentrations, it became apparent that a grade of about 0. 8 % Mo only could be achieved with over 80 % recovery. The redeeming feature however was that over 90 % of the feed could be rejected at the rougher flotation stage itself with a negligence loss of about 0. 02 % Mo in the tailings. It was thus considered logical to further upgrade the Mo content by regrinding. An extensive flotation campaign was therefore mounted, adopting the following strategies: (1) Ist stage regrinding and one cleaning (2) IInd stage regrinding and three cleanings (3) IIIrd stage regrinding and two cleanings Based on the first stage regrinding tests it was found that by <b>regrinding</b> <b>to</b> 100 % passing 106 microns, the Mo assay could be enhanced to over 32 % from a initial value of about 0. 1 % in the feed. The enrichment ratio at this stage corresponds to about 340. After the second stage regrinding followed by three stages of cleaning, close to 75 % recovery of Mo with an assay value of about 52 % could be achieved, further enhancing the enrichment ratio to about 540. A few experiments were conducted using sodium cyanide during second stage regrinding tests and it was found that copper assay could be brought down to 0. 3 % from about 0. 8 %, without affecting the grade of lead and molybdenum. The results of the third stage regrinding tests have highlighted that a final concentrate assaying about 55 % molybdenum with over 70 % recovery could be obtained. It is worthy to mention that the concentrate so produced meets the specification of metallurgical grade molybdenite. The overall enrichment ratio obtained, commencing from a feed assaying 0. 1 % Mo, corresponds to about 580. In order to explore the efficacy of organic depressants, which are more acceptable on environmental grounds, detailed flotation studies were carried out using dextrin with particular emphasis on galena depression. A series of experiments was carried out in an identical manner to those conducted using sodium dichromate. Here again, three stages of regrinding/cleanings test where carried out, akin to those performed using sodium dichromate. A dextrin concentration of 0. 01 kg/t was found to be an optimum value from the point of grade, wt. % recovery and distribution of molybdenum, lead and copper in the cleaner concentrate. It is noteworthy that after second stage regrinding followed by four stages of cleaning, the molybdenum assay value has significantly improved from 16 % to about 53 % with over 70 % recovery. Another notable feature is that copper content in the concentrate is only about 0. 2 % even without the addition of sodium cyanide. The results of the third stage regrinding/cleaning tests have shown marginal improvement in the molybdenum assay values without affecting the grade of copper and lead. On a comparative basis, it can be inferred that dextrin holds promise {{to be used as a}} potential substitute for the inorganic depressants such as sodium dichromate and sodium cyanide. On the basis of the extensive investigations carried out on the beneficiation of molybdenite ore, a comprehensive flowsheet has been developed...|$|R
