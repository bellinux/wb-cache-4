Stream-dwelling plethodontid salamanders are particularly susceptible to urbanization due to declining water quality and hydrological changes, but few studies have examined these taxa in cities. The northern dusky salamander (Desmognathus fuscus) was once common in the New York City metropolitan area, but has substantially declined throughout the region in recent decades. We used five tetranucleotide microsatellite loci to examine population differentiation, genetic variation, and bottlenecks among five remnant urban populations of dusky salamanders in NYC. These genetic measures provide information on isolation, prevalence of inbreeding, long-term prospects for population persistence, and potential for evolutionary responses to future environmental change. All populations were genetically differentiated from each other, and the most isolated populations in Manhattan have maintained very little genetic variation (i. e. < 20 % heterozygosity). A majority of the populations also exhibited evidence of genetic bottlenecks. These findings contrast with published estimates of high genetic variation within and lack of structure between populations of other desmognathine salamanders sampled over similar or larger spatial scales. Declines in genetic variation likely resulted from population extirpations and the degradation of stream and <b>terrestrial</b> <b>paths</b> for dispersal in NYC. Loss of genetic variability in populations isolated by human development may be an underappreciated cause and/or consequence of the decline of this species in urbanized areas of the northeast USA...|$|R

40|$|The {{adoption}} of satellite systems in providing broadband transmissions to mobile users such as trains, buses and vans {{is expected to}} be an interesting solution. The scenario we considered refers to a hybrid network architecture, where a geostationary satellite forward link and a terrestrial 3 G return link are used in order to exploit both the high bandwidth of a satellite channel and the lower propagation delay of a <b>terrestrial</b> <b>path.</b> The resulting round-trip delay is much shorter than that one experienced by using both the forward and return link via satellite.

40|$|High photon-efficiency (many bits/photon) optical {{communication}} is possible with pulse-position modulation and direct detection, and high spectral efficiency (many bits/sec-Hz) {{optical communication}} is possible with quadrature-amplitude modulation and coherent detection. These high efficiencies, however, cannot be achieved simultaneously unless multiple spatial modes are employed. Previous {{work for the}} vacuum-propagation channel has shown that achieving 10 bits/photon and 5 bits/sec-Hz is impossible with coherent detection, and it requires 189 low diffraction-loss spatial modes at the ultimate Holevo limit, and 4500 such modes at the Shannon limit for on-off keying with direct detection. For <b>terrestrial</b> propagation <b>paths,</b> however, the effects of atmospheric turbulence must be factored into the photon and spectral efficiency assessments. This paper accomplishes that goal by presenting {{upper and lower bounds}} on the turbulent channel’s ergodic Holevo capacity for M-mode systems whose transmitters use either focused-beam, Hermite-Gaussian (HG), or Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) modes, and whose receivers do M-mode detection either with or without adaptive optics. The bounds show that use of adaptive optics will not be necessary for achieving high photon efficiency and high spectral efficiency through atmospheric turbulence, although receivers which do not use adaptive optics will need to cope with considerable crosstalk between the spatial patterns produced in their entrance pupils by the M-mode transmitter. The bounds also show the exact theoretical equivalence of the HG and LG mode sets for this application, generalizing a result previously established for the vacuum-propagation channel. Finally, our results show that the FB modes outperform the HG and LG modes in operation with and without adaptive optics. National Science Foundation (U. S.).

40|$|In the {{locality}} of Silveirinha, to {{the south}} of Figueira da Foz, is found a rich and heterogeneous mammalian fauna with very archaic characteristics. In this research more than thirty tax belonging to the following mammal orders:Didelphimorphia, Apatotheria; Lipotyphla; Cimolesta, Dermoptera, Taeniodonta (until now considered as confined to North America), Primates, Creodonta, Carnivora, Rodentia, Condylarthra, Artiodactyla, Perissodactyla, plus two tax Incertae sedis were identified and described. The faunistic list comprises several new tax that include ten species (five of them published or to be published), two genus and two subfamilies. The new species described in this research are: Leptacodon nascimentoi, Arcius zbyszewskii, Donrussellia lusitanica, Microparamys paisi e Meldimys cardosoi. Biostratigraphical correlations were established with some others european sites of comparable age. The whole fauna has more primitive characteristics than the fauna of any other european site of the reference level MP 7 of Dormaal (early Eocene), which makes Silveirinha the oldest european Eocene locality, near the Paleocene-Eocene boundary. Although there exist in Silveirinha two genus common to the Paleocene european faunas, it is difficult to establish the correlation with these due to scarce knowledge about mammalian faunas of this age. From the cronostratigraphic point of view, the Silveirinha mammalian fauna permits the precise datation of the corresponding deposits, which belong to the lithostratigraphical level known as 'Areias e Argilas de Silveirinha'. The presence in Silveirinha of ten or eleven genus in common with the North America ones (particularly from the early Wasatchian) shows paleogeographical conditions allowing faunistic exchanges between this continent and Europe. The geological data justifies the faunistic similarity and is evidence of the existence of a continuous and habitable terrestrial connection during the latest Paleocene and the earliest Eocene.

40|$|<b>Terrestrial</b> {{panoramic}} cues, <b>path</b> {{integration and}} search behavior {{are the main}} navigational strategies used by ants to locate food and find {{their way back to}} the nest. Searching becomes important when the other navigational cues are either not available or cannot provide sufficient information to pinpoint the goal. When searching in one-dimensional channels Melophorus bagoti ants exhibit a systematic drift in the starting-point-to-goal direction as they turn back and forth, sometimes past the goal location (Narendra et al., 2008). Here we show that this drift in channels is not a stereotypical part of the search behavior in these ants. It rather depends on the conditions of training. In experiments in which the nest entrance is located not at the end but {{at the side of the}} channel, forward drift is not always part of the nest search. Experiments on food searches showed that with the food source at the end of the channel, ants performed a linear drift in the starting-point-to-food direction. With food at the side of the channel, they showed a less pronounced drift toward the food source. In this constrained environment, especially with the goal at the end of the channel, ants seem to learn a routine such as 'run along the channel', and mix this routine with their usual strategy of turning back and forth in search. 6 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Tropical Cyclones (TCs) {{intensity}} and frequency {{are expected to}} be impacted by climate change. Despite their destructive potential, these phenomena, which can produce heavy precipitation, are also an important source of freshwater. Therefore any change in frequency, seasonal timing and intensity of TCs is expected to strongly impact the regional water cycle and consequently the freshwater availability and distribution. This is critical, {{due to the fact that}} freshwater resources in the US are under stress due to the population growth and economic development that increasingly create more demands from agricultural, municipal and industrial uses, resulting in frequent over-allocation of water resources. In this study we concentrate on monitoring the impact of hurricanes and tropical storms on vegetation activity along their terrestrial tracks and investigate the underlying physical processes. To characterize and monitor the spatial organization and time of recovery of vegetation disturbance in the aftermath of major hurricanes over the entire southeastern US, a remote sensed framework based on MODIS enhanced vegetation index (EVI) was developed. At the SE scale, this framework was complemented by a water balance approach to estimate the variability in hurricane groundwater recharge capacity spatially and between events. Then we investigate the contribution of TCs (season totals and event by event) to the SE US annual precipitation totals from 2002 to 2011. A water budget approach applied at the drainage basins scale is used to investigate the partitioning of TCs' precipitation into surface runoff and groundwater system in the direct aftermath of major TCs. This framework allows exploring the contribution of TCs to annual precipitation totals and the consequent recharge of groundwater reservoirs across different physiographic regions (mountains, coastal and alluvial plains) versus the fraction that is quickly evacuated through the river network and surface runoff. Then a Land surface Eco-Hydrological Model (LEHM), combining water and energy budgets with photosynthesis activity, is used to estimate Gross Primary Production (GPP) over the SE US The obtained data is compared to AmeriFlux and MODIS GPP data over the SE United States in order to establish the model's ability to capture vegetation dynamics for the different biomes of the SE US. Then, a suite of numerical experiments is conducted to evaluate the impact of Tropical Cyclones (TCs) precipitation over the SE US. The numerical experiments consist of with and without TC precipitation simulations by replacing the signature of TC forcing by NARR-derived climatology of atmospheric forcing ahead of landfall during the TC <b>terrestrial</b> <b>path.</b> The comparison of these GPP estimates with those obtained with the normal forcing result in areas of discrepancies where the GPP was significantly modulated by TC activity.
