5|$|Lighting and {{its effect}} on characters' skin was of {{particular}} importance to the Business Division 2 team, with a lot of work going into making sure shading and transparency fitted with each character's position in a scene in relation to its lighting. Previsualization was initially going to be done entirely in-house, but the team eventually decided to bring in <b>The</b> <b>Third</b> <b>Floor,</b> an external company specializing in previsualization. <b>The</b> <b>Third</b> <b>Floor</b> ended up handling around 40% of the work. The animation was also supposed to be handled in-house using the V-Ray software, but the team found it difficult to adapt the software to their needs. As Nozue wanted to use the experience and technology of Visual Works to create Kingsglaive, they decided to bring in experienced and dedicated outside help to handle V-Ray. This resulted in the cooperation with Digic Pictures, which included former staff from Square Enix's North American branch and were highly skilled in the creation of high-quality cutscenes. For procedural environmental elements such as falling rubble, they used the Houdini animation software.|$|E
