25|$|Over the years, {{many people}} have asked me how I run the Naval Reactors Program, {{so that they might}} find some benefit for their own work. I am always chagrined at the {{tendency}} of people to expect <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> simple, easy gimmick that makes my program function. Any successful program functions as an integrated whole of many factors. Trying to select one aspect as the key one will not work. Each element depends on all the others.|$|E
500|$|I love Brett {{because he}} is like me. If I'm {{eternally}} 12 -- because he's {{a little bit more}} naughty than I am -- he's eternally 15. He has a great sense of humor, obviously, and he knows <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> sense of humor and he feels that people don't recognize that about me. And I'll do stuff that I'm totally joking and they're like (uses mean girl voice), [...] "Why is she doing that? Why is she doing the treadmill with her high heels on?" [...] I'm like, [...] "It's a freakin' joke! It's 'Cribs'! Hello! It's a freakin' joke!" ...|$|E
500|$|Halperin {{concludes that}} the Scientology {{organization}} is more focused on money than on other issues: [...] "I pretty much found that everything about the church is about making {{as much money as}} possible, which doesn't really make them much different from most other religions. I have to be honest and admit I also met some nice people in the church. It's just <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> huge problem with their discriminatory attitude toward gays." [...] Halperin disputes Andrew Morton's claim in his book [...] that actor Tom Cruise is second in command of the organization, instead asserting Cruise is actually in the top position of leadership.|$|E

All {{everyone}} is obsessed about at the moment is being a celebrity. I'm saying that's bullshit and who knows better than me? Before it happens you have all kinds of notions about how wonderful celebrity is and how much joy it's going to bring you. Then you arrive... Look like this you're gonna be happy. Drive this car you're gonna be popular. Wear these clothes and people are gonna wanna fuck you. It's a very powerful illusion and people are caught up in it, including myself. Or I was." ...|$|E
500|$|Throughout 2016, PewDiePie's video style change {{became more}} {{apparent}} than the tweaks he implemented in the past (see above for more). As aforementioned, PewDiePie addressed his use of words such as gay as a pejorative, retrospectively expressing, [...] "I still make kinda stupid jokes that I shouldn't make. But I feel like back then I didn't understand. I was so immature and I just thought things were funny just because they were offensive [...] I'm not proud of it. I'm really not. But I'm also glad that I've grown past it." [...] While continuing to produce fewer Let's Play videos about horror games, his style of humour also changed; PewDiePie commented in a December 2016 video, [...] "I think the thing is <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> lot of younger audience , and I think my humour got drier, and they don't get it." ...|$|E
500|$|Early in his career, West {{made clear}} his {{interest}} in fashion and desire {{to work in the}} clothing design industry. In September 2005, West announced that he would release his Pastelle Clothing line in spring 2006, claiming [...] "Now <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> Grammy under my belt and Late Registration is finished, I am ready to launch my clothing line next spring." [...] The line was developed over the following four years – with multiple pieces teased by West himself – before the line was ultimately cancelled in 2009. In 2009, West collaborated with Nike to release his own shoe, the Air Yeezys, with a second version released in 2012. In January 2009, West introduced his first shoe line designed for Louis Vuitton during Paris Fashion Week. The line was released in summer 2009. West has additionally designed shoewear for Bape and Italian shoemaker Giuseppe Zanotti. In fall 2009 West moved to Rome and did an internship at Italian fashion brand Fendi where he gave ideas for the men's collection. In March 2011, West collaborated with M/M Paris for a series of silk scarves featuring artwork from My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy.|$|E

500|$|Andy Battaglia of The A.V. Club {{suggested}} that the influence of Endtroducing..... {{may have had a}} negative effect on the album itself, saying that it [...] "has been partially diluted by the symphonic beat-collage culture it helped spawn." [...] The album's acclaim set considerably high standards for future releases by DJ Shadow, and he has expressed his dissatisfaction with being expected to [...] "repeat Endtroducing..... over and over again". Despite this, DJ Shadow {{has made it clear that}} he views the album in a positive light and denies any pressure that may have come about as a result of the album's praise: [...] "...people always seem to suggest that there's this pressure, and that Endtroducing..... is some kind of albatross, and I've just honestly never felt that way. I think <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> healthy enough respect for the lineage of the music and how rare it is that you can connect with an audience. If that will always be 'the record' then so be it, that's cool." [...] As of April 26, 2005, Endtroducing..... has sold upwards of 290,000 copies in the United States alone.|$|E
500|$|The Giants {{were founded}} in 1925 by Tim Mara, a {{bookmaker}} (legal in 1925), businessman, and promoter, with {{an investment of}} US$500 after a meeting with league president Joseph Carr, and Harry March. Carr {{was sent to the}} east coast to find someone to put a team in a major city there to help the struggling league. Carr contacted Billy Gibson who was the manager of heavyweight boxer Gene Tunney and knew of Mara from Mara's interest in investing in Tunney. Mara decided to spend the $500 on the Giants as opposed to Tunney in a spur of the moment decision, and started the team with the statement, [...] "an exclusive franchise for anything in New York is worth $500." [...] His son Wellington later said that his father felt that even an empty store in the city was worth that price. Mara purchased the team, despite never having watched a single pro game, saying to the sellers at the time, [...] "Just tell me one thing. Now <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> franchise, what do I do with it." [...] To differentiate themselves from the baseball team of the same name, they took the name [...] "New York Football Giants", which they still use as their legal corporate name.|$|E
500|$|In a press release, Lewis {{explained}} the meaning behind [...] "Trouble": [...] "it {{tells the story}} of love going bad and becoming destructive, aspects of which we can all relate to. It’s a deeply emotional and poignant song <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> real connection to." [...] According to the Sunday Mirror, [...] "Trouble" [...] was inspired by Lewis' break-up with her childhood sweetheart Lou Al-Chamaa. Lyrics which reference her relationship with Chamaa include the lines: [...] "I told you never to get used to me, I stay awake while you fall asleep. I'm a whole lot of trouble, we're in a whole lot of trouble. You shout louder than you used to, and you hold on tighter in the bedroom." [...] During an interview with Digital Spy, Lewis further explained that she was inspired and influenced by British trip-hop pioneers Massive Attack. The Suns showbiz editor Gordan Smart also picked up on the similarities, noting that [...] "Trouble" [...] sounds similar to [...] "Unfinished Sympathy" [...] (1991) and [...] "Teardrop" [...] (1998) by Massive Attack. [...] "Trouble" [...] drew comparisons to Sandé's own singles; according to Michael Cragg from The Guardian, [...] "Trouble" [...] was much like [...] "Heaven" [...] (2011) while MSN's Danielle Cheeseman compared it to Sandé collaboration with Naughty Boy, [...] "Daddy" [...] (2011).|$|E

500|$|On December 17, 2013, LaBeouf {{released}} his short film Howard Cantour.com to the Internet; shortly thereafter, several bloggers noted its close similarity to Justin M. Damiano, a 2007 comic by Ghost World creator Dan Clowes. Wired journalist Graeme McMillan noted {{at least three}} similarities in their article, {{one of which was}} that the opening monologue for the short and the comic were identical. LaBeouf would later remove the film and claim that he did not intend to copy Clowes but was instead [...] "inspired" [...] by him and [...] "got lost in the creative process." [...] He followed this up with several apologies via Twitter writing, [...] "In my excitement and naiveté as an amateur filmmaker, I got lost in the creative process and neglected to follow proper accreditation", and [...] "I deeply regret the manner in which these events have unfolded and want @danielclowes to know <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> great respect for his work". Clowes responded by saying [...] "The first I ever heard of the film was this morning when someone sent me a link. I've never spoken to or met Mr. LaBeouf ... I actually can't imagine what was going through his mind." [...] LaBeouf was criticized over his apology, with some sites such as The A.V. Club noting that the apology itself appeared to have been lifted from a 2010 post on Yahoo! Answers.|$|E
