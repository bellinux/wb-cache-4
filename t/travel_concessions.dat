Members of the Socialist Workers Party disrupted negotiations between BA management and Unite to prevent industrial action. Further disruption struck when Derek Simpson, a Unite co-leader, was discovered to have leaked details of confidential negotiations online via Twitter. Industrial action re-emerged in 2017, this time by BA's Mixed Fleet flight attendants, whom were employed on much less favorable pay and terms and conditions compared to previous cabin staff who joined prior to 2010. A ballot for industrial action was distributed to Mixed Fleet crew in November 2016 and resulted in an overwhelming yes majority for industrial action. Unite described Mixed Fleet crew as on [...] "poverty pay", with many Mixed Fleet flight attendants sleeping in their cars in between shifts because they cannot afford the fuel to drive home, or operating while sick as they cannot afford to call in sick and lose their pay for the shift. Unite also blasted BA of removing staff <b>travel</b> <b>concessions,</b> bonus payments and other benefits to all cabin crew who undertook industrial action, as well as strike-breaking tactics such as wet-leasing aircraft from other airlines and offering financial incentives for cabin crew not to strike. The first dates of strikes during Christmas 2016 were cancelled due to pay negotiations. Industrial action by Mixed Fleet commenced in January 2017 after rejecting a pay offer. Strike action continued throughout 2017 in numerous discontinuous periods, resulting in one of the longest running disputes in aviation history. On October 31, 2017, after 85 days of discontinuous industrial action, Mixed Fleet accepted a new pay deal from BA which ended the dispute.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>Travel</b> <b>Concessions</b> Act of 1964, one of {{the first}} Acts passed by the First Wilson Government, {{provided}} concessions to all pensioners travelling on buses operated by municipal transport authorities. The Transport Act 1968 established the principle of government grants for transport authorities if uneconomic passenger services were justified on social grounds. A National Freight Corporation was also established to provide integrated rail freight and road services. Public expenditure on roads steadily increased and stricter safety precautions were introduced, such as the breathalyser test for drunken driving, under the 1967 Road Traffic Act. [...] The Transport Act gave a much needed financial boost to British Rail, treating them like they were a company which had become bankrupt but could now, under new management, carry on debt-free. The act also established a national freight corporation and introduced government rail subsidies for passenger transport on the same basis as existing subsidies for roads to enable local authorities to improve public transport in their areas.|$|E

5000|$|Following World War II and the Cold War, the Western {{world was}} focused on mutual {{cooperation}} and understanding {{in order to prevent}} a resurgence of fascism. This atmosphere gave impetus for student organisations to form, with the aim of working together for peace and cooperation throughout the world. One such student organisation, the International Student Conference (ISC) held their 3rd ISC at the Studenterforeningen’s Hus in Copenhagen. It was attended by National Unions of Students and Coordinating Secretariat of National Unions of Students (COSEC), Denmark, amongst others. The attending student organisations made the decision to establish a single international identity document valid for the perceived need of <b>travel</b> <b>concessions.</b> This is the first documented mention of the International Student Identity Card (ISIC).Representatives of the ISC were also representatives of the International Student Travel Conference (ISTC). At the 4th International Student Travel Conference (ISTC), and following the decision made at the 3rd International Student Conference (ISC), the Norwegian and Netherlands Union of Students, in co-operation with COSEC, presented a document based on a Survey of the Council of Europe. The document concluded that the formation of an international student card would be of benefit to students while travelling. The Norwegian and Netherlands Union of Students, in co-operation with COSEC accepted responsibility to form a Travel Aids Commission and “take the necessary steps to ensure that an International Student Identity Card be made available as soon as possible in as large {{a part of the world}} as possible”. [...] Thus, the International Student Identity Card was founded with the aim to provide students worldwide with access to student facilities, wherever they travelled. It was agreed that the real value of the card would prove that the holder was a “bona fide” student. [...] The first ISIC cards were produced by the Travel Aids Commission managed by the ISTC. 56,000 cards were issued amongst 31 countries in the first year.|$|E

5000|$|On 26 February 2001, the Howard {{government}} {{amended the}} Social Security Act 1991 (SSA 1991). New Zealand citizens may reside, work and study in Australia indefinitely without needing to first {{apply for a}} visa. They are granted a Special Category Visa (SCV) sub-class 444 on arrival subject to meeting health and character requirements, however this is a temporary visa which was introduced on 1 September 1994. The amendment to the SSA 1991 excludes most NZ citizens who arrived after 26 February 2001 from being eligible to apply for citizenship and claim social security payments. NZ citizens who were in Australia on 26 February 2001 or for 12 months {{in the two years}} prior, or who hold a Centrelink certificate issued under the Social Security Act 1991 stating that they were residing in Australia on a particular date are considered to be [...] "protected" [...] SCV holders. These people are entitled to much the same as Australian permanent visa holders. They may also apply for citizenship provided they meet the residence requirement. [...] "Non-protected" [...] SCV holders (those NZ citizens who don't meet the February 2001 criteria) who wish to become Australian citizens must first obtain a permanent visa. About 60% of the NZ citizens in Australia do not qualify for any of the permanent visas. Those NZ citizens who are non-protected SCV holders but who entered Australia at any time before September 1994 may be eligible for a Resident Return Visa (RRV). NZ citizens who entered Australia before September 1994 were granted permanent residence on arrival and the RRV reinstates that permanent resident status. Many NZ citizens who have obtained a permanent visa sponsor their NZ citizen partner and NZ-born children. The fees NZ citizens pay for a permanent visa are the same as the fees people from other countries pay, even though the NZ citizen applicants may have lived and paid taxes in Australia since 2001, while those from other countries may have never contributed anything to Australia at the time of applying for a permanent visa. The amendments to the SSA 1991 have created an underclass of residents in Australia, from inaccessibility to assistance in the event of sudden job loss or severe illness, to being ineligible to access the recently introduced National Disability Insurance Scheme which is funded via an increased Medicare levy. Non-protected SCV holders are Australian residents for tax purposes but cannot work for the federal government or join the defence force because they are ineligible to apply for citizenship, are currently ineligible for student loans, are not eligible for public housing or student <b>travel</b> <b>concessions</b> in some states, cannot work for state government in some states, are not covered by many insurance policies because they don't meet the insurer's definition of a permanent resident, are excluded from applying for some jobs because they don't meet the criteria of being a permanent resident and cannot access shelters in the event they are escaping a domestic violence situation.|$|E
40|$|A {{key issue}} {{identified}} in the Universities Australia Ten-Point Action Plan on Student Safety was the absence of suitable transport concessions provided to international students - particularly so in NSW and Victoria. Both Governments have remained strongly opposed to issuing such concessions {{even in the face}} of the recent public debate on international student safety. This paper: examines the arguments surrounding the issue of <b>travel</b> <b>concessions</b> for international students; identifies the costs and benefits of implementing transport concessions for those students in NSW and Victoria (including estimated cost to state government revenue);  and  recommends the best way forward on this issue.   It is concluded that given the spate of attacks on international students and the attendant public debate and diplomatic difficulties, not to say the consequences for the affected individuals, action on <b>travel</b> <b>concessions</b> for international students will send a clear message that the responsible governments in Australia wish to do all they can to welcome and support such students in an equitable way.

40|$|Public {{transport}} in all countries, {{rich and}} poor, facilitates {{access to some}} of the determinants of health including employment, and health and educational services. Some cities (largely in higher income countries) now provide incentives to use public transport. Drawing on qualitative data from two groups typically at risk of transport exclusion, this paper focuses on young (12 - 18 years of age) and older (60 + years of age) bus users??? accounts of bus travel and of the <b>travel</b> <b>concessions</b> they receive. Both groups perceived that their entitlement to free bus travel reflected their social worth, but that entitlement to particular spaces on the bus reflected less valued social attributes such as need or vulnerability. Their free bus journeys were related to social inclusion through enhancing a sense of belonging: to the city, and to a collective ???public???. We focus on the ways in which entitlement to public transport can mediate the relationships between mobility and wellbeing. These findings are important because while much research has focussed on ???active travel??? modes and health, fewer studies look at the relationship between public transport use and wider health and social benefits...|$|E
40|$|Everyone has a {{soft spot}} for pensioners. This {{probably}} explains most peoples’ unquestioning approval of pensioners’ <b>travel</b> <b>concessions.</b> However, it is argued here that concessions do not make sense because pensioners would be better off with the cash equivalent of their concessions. Concessions involve inefficiencies of which the following are the main ones. First, there are good arguments for some subsidies (e. g. health and education). These arguments do not apply well to pensioner travel. For example in the case of health, many people {{in the absence of the}} National Health Service would face sudden large bills for medical treatment. In contrast, the bill for essential travel, like going to the shops, is a predictable and modest weekly expense of the same order as the weekly cost of food (for which pensioners are not given concessions). Second, about three quarters of the money spent on concessions is wasted in that it goes on transporting those who could afford the full fare or who are on non-essential journeys. In contrast, under a no concession scenario only about a quarter of the expenditure is wasted. Also, concessions are a poor means of supplying transport facilities to pensioners since about a third are not well served by public transport. In contrast, under a no concessions scenario, virtually all less well off pensioners get “transport subsidy money” since this money is contained in an increased state pension. Under a no concessions scenario, pensioners can spend their “subsidy money” on for example home delivery of groceries, taxi trips or subsidising relatives’ car running costs where the latter do the shopping. Fourth, social exclusion is often used to justify concessions. It is shown that abolishing concessions, far from increasing social exclusion, might even reduce it. ...|$|E
