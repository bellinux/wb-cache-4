500|$|Thanks to the media, {{people have}} started taking boxing seriously {{over the past}} two years. Everyone knows my name now because my {{achievements}} have been highlighted. Lekin boxing ka toh kuch promotion hi nahin hota India mein. (But boxing is still not promoted in India!) We don’t have boxing academies, we don’t even have proper boxing rings. I have lost count of <b>the</b> <b>times</b> <b>I</b> have approached the government and the sporting authorities for support, but nothing has happened. [...] In this country, everyone is hung up on cricket. Forget about boxing, India is doing so well in other sports too. Saina Nehwal is a great badminton player, the Indian tennis team has just won a Davis Cup tie, lekin hamare liye support kahan hai? (but where is the support for all of us?) ...|$|E
500|$|Swift was {{inspired}} to write [...] "Teardrops on My Guitar" [...] about her experience with a boy named Drew Hardwick, a classmate of hers whom she had feelings for. Hardwick later went on to join the Navy. During their freshman {{year of high school}} at Hendersonville High School, Swift and Hardwick sat beside each other in a class everyday. The two developed a fond friendship, although Swift secretively desired for it to become a romantic relationship. Because of Hardwick's unawareness, he would frequently speak to Swift about a girl he had feelings for, something Swift pretended to be endeared by, commenting, [...] "How beautiful she was, how nice and smart and perfect she was. And I sat there and listened, never meaning it any of <b>the</b> <b>times</b> <b>I</b> said 'Oh, I'm so happy for you.'" [...] Hardwick and his love interest eventually developed a relationship which lasted for a few years. Swift never confessed her feelings to him. By the release of Taylor Swift, he remained unaware of Swift's intentions or the song and continued his relationship with the same female. Upon [...] "Teardrops on My Guitar"'s release as a single, Hardwick attempted to contact Swift via phone calls, which Swift did not respond to; he then left voicemails, but Swift felt too awkward to call back.|$|E
500|$|Conway {{continued}} McConnell's line {{of attack}} on Bevin's finances, specifically the issue of delinquent taxes. While McConnell's charges involved delinquent taxes against Bevin Brothers Manufacturing, Theo Keith of Louisville's WAVE reported in June that Bevin had been late at least 10 times paying property taxes on his vacation homes in Maine and Louisiana between 2002 and 2009. He further reported in July that Bevin's company, Integrity Holdings, also had multiple past delinquency issues. In total, Keith estimated that Bevin had paid about $1,800 in penalties for late tax payments. Bevin became irritated with Keith's reporting and refused to answer questions from him at subsequent press conferences; he did not buy ads on WAVE, despite running ads on Louisville's other three network broadcast stations. The Associated Press' Adam Beam eventually reported that Bevin had paid his taxes late on 30 different occasions. In an October interview with Beam, Bevin said, [...] "Sometimes you do pay it late and you pay interest on having paid it late. But you pay the taxes. ... You do {{this all the time}} in business." [...] He added that his critics [...] "could have done just as breathless a story of all <b>the</b> <b>times</b> <b>I</b> paid my taxes early and gotten a discount on it." [...] He also reiterated that, as of the time of the interview, he had paid all of his taxes: [...] "Do I actually owe taxes to anyone, anywhere? The answer is no." ...|$|E

In February 1968 the album's lead single [...] "By <b>the</b> <b>Time</b> <b>I</b> Get to Phoenix", released October 1967, won Grammys for both Best Vocal Performance, Male and Best Contemporary Male Solo Vocal Performance (for 1967). In 2004 [...] "By <b>the</b> <b>Time</b> <b>I</b> Get to Phoenix" [...] was inducted in the Grammy Hall of Fame.|$|R
5000|$|Michael Longley has {{experimented with}} Ulster Scots for the {{translation}} of Classical verse, as in his 1995 collection The Ghost Orchid. Longley has spoken of his identity as a Northern Irish poet: [...] "some of <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> feel British and some of <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> feel Irish. But most of <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> feel neither and the marvellous thing about the Good Friday agreement was that it allowed me to feel more of each if I wanted to." [...] He was awarded the Queen's Gold Medal for Poetry in 2001.|$|R
2500|$|On October 31, 2008, Ellison's {{mother died}} of {{complications}} from diabetes, twenty-one months after his great-aunt Alice Coltrane's death. Ellison said, [...] "I decided that if I was going to speak after that experience , it better be something honest, and deeper than a record that was just made for <b>the</b> <b>times.</b> <b>I</b> {{wanted to do something}} that made her proud." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rowling said [...] "I've never thought, 'It's {{time for}} a post-9/11 Harry Potter book,' no. But what Voldemort does, in many senses, is terrorism, and that was quite clear in my mind before 9/11 happened.... but there are {{parallels}}, obviously. I think one of <b>the</b> <b>times</b> <b>I</b> felt the parallels was when I was writing about the arrest of Stan Shunpike, you know? I always planned that {{these kinds of things}} would happen, but these have very powerful resonances, given that I believe, and many people believe, that there have been instances of persecution of people who did not deserve to be persecuted, even while we're attempting to find the people who have committed utter atrocities. These things just happen, it's human nature. There were some very startling parallels at the time I was writing it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rawlins corroborated Rowley's {{account of}} Grant's {{whereabouts}} and performance, maintaining that the rumors were typically [...] "unmitigated slander" [...] {{and that he}} had never seen Grant at any time take a drink, and that [...] "Grant and his staff" [...] were on the battlefield by 7 A.M. Colonel John E. Smith, also of the 45th Illinois, corroborated Rowley's claim as well, maintaining that the army was [...] "astonished" [...] to hear such claims, and that they were made by [...] "those who are jealous of him". Colonel Jacob Ammen, who had also seen Grant at Savannah and at Pittsburg Landing, in like manner claimed [...] "I am satisfied General Grant was not under the influence of liquor, either of <b>the</b> <b>times</b> <b>I</b> saw him. Rowley was soon promoted to Major General of Volunteers and later served on a detail as Provost Marshal General of Departments of Tennessee and Cumberland, in 1863.|$|E

2500|$|Author Isaac Asimov {{recounted in}} his second autobiographical volume In Joy Still Felt seeing Lehrer perform in a Boston nightclub on October 9, 1954, during which he sang very cleverly about Jim getting it from Louise, and Sally from Jim, [...] "and {{after a while you}} {{gathered}} the 'it' to be venereal disease [...] Suddenly, as the combinations grew more grotesque, you realized he was satirizing every perversion known to mankind without using a single naughty phrase. It was clearly unsingable (in those days) outside a nightclub." [...] Asimov also recalled a song that dealt with the Boston subway system, making use of the stations leading into town from Harvard, observing that the local subject-matter rendered the song useless for general distribution. Lehrer subsequently granted Asimov permission to print the lyrics to the subway song in his book. [...] "I haven't gone to nightclubs often," [...] said Asimov, [...] "but of all <b>the</b> <b>times</b> <b>I</b> have gone, it was on this occasion that I had by far the best time." ...|$|E
