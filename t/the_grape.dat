5|$|<b>The</b> <b>grape</b> {{originated}} in France, {{in the regions}} of Bordeaux and the Loire Valley. Plantings in California, Australia, Chile and South Africa are also extensive, and Sauvignon blanc is steadily increasing in popularity as white wine drinkers seek alternatives to Chardonnay. <b>The</b> <b>grape</b> {{can also be found}} in Italy and Central Europe.|$|E
5|$|Winemakers in New Zealand and Chile {{harvest the}} grapes at various {{intervals}} {{for the different}} blending characteristics that <b>the</b> <b>grape</b> can impart depending on its ripeness levels. At its most unripe stage, <b>the</b> <b>grape</b> is high in malic acid. As it progresses further towards ripeness <b>the</b> <b>grape</b> develops red & green pepper flavors and eventually achieves a balance of sugars. The flavors characteristic of Sauvignon blanc come from the chemicals methoxypyrazines. Grapes grown in Marlborough's Wairau Valley may exhibit different levels of ripeness over the vineyard, caused by slight unevenness in the land and giving a similar flavor profile to the resulting wine.|$|E
5|$|DNA {{evidence}} has shown Cabernet Sauvignon {{is the result}} of the crossing of two other Bordeaux grape varieties— Cabernet franc and Sauvignon blanc— which has led grapevine historians, or ampelographers, to believe that <b>the</b> <b>grape</b> originated in Bordeaux. Early records indicate that <b>the</b> <b>grape</b> was a popular planting in the Médoc region during the 18th century. The loose berry clusters and thick skins of <b>the</b> <b>grape</b> provided a good resistance to rot in the sometimes wet maritime climate of Bordeaux. <b>The</b> <b>grape</b> continued to grow in popularity until the Powdery mildew epidemic of 1852 exposed Cabernet Sauvignon's sensitivity to that grape disease. With vineyards severely ravaged or lost, many Bordeaux wine growers turned to Merlot, increasing its plantings to where it soon became the most widely planted grape in Bordeaux. As the region's winemakers started to better understand the area's terroir and how the different grape varieties performed in different region, Cabernet Sauvignon increased in plantings all along the Left Bank region of the Gironde river in the Médoc as well as Graves region, where it became the dominant variety in the wine blends. In the Right bank regions of Saint-Émilion and Pomerol, Cabernet is a distant third in plantings behind Merlot & Cabernet franc.|$|E

5|$|The Sauvignon blanc vine often buds late but ripens early, {{which allows}} it to perform well in sunny climates when not exposed to {{overwhelming}} heat. In warm regions such as South Africa, Australia and California, <b>the</b> <b>grape</b> flourishes in cooler climate appellations such as the Alexander Valley area. In areas where the vine is subjected to high heat, <b>the</b> <b>grape</b> will quickly become over-ripe and produce wines with dull flavors and flat acidity.

25|$|White wine is {{made from}} white or black grapes (but always with white flesh, <b>the</b> <b>grapes</b> with {{coloured}} flesh are called Teinturier meaning coloured juice).

50|$|A {{bladder press}} {{consists}} of a large cylinder, closed at each end, into which the fruit is loaded. To press <b>the</b> <b>grapes,</b> a large bladder expands and pushes <b>the</b> <b>grapes</b> against <b>the</b> sides. The juice then flows out through small openings in the cylinder.

5|$|Carménère {{favors a}} long growing season in {{moderate}} to warm climates. During harvest {{time and the}} winter period the vine fares poorly if it is introduced {{to high levels of}} rain or irrigation water. This is particularly true in poor-soil plantings where the vine would need more water. Over-watering during this period accentuates the herbaceous and green pepper characteristics of <b>the</b> <b>grape.</b> <b>The</b> <b>grape</b> naturally develops high levels of sugar before the tannins achieve ripeness. If grown in too hot a climate the resulting wine will have a high alcohol level and low balance. Carménère buds and flowers three to seven days later than Merlot and the yield is lower than that of the latter grape. The Carménère leaves turn to crimson before dropping.|$|E
5|$|Far {{from being}} extinct, {{in recent years}} the Carménère grape has been {{discovered}} to be thriving in several areas outside France. In Chile, growers almost inadvertently preserved <b>the</b> <b>grape</b> variety during the last 150 years, due largely to its similarity to Merlot.|$|E

5|$|In the United Kingdom, English wine {{producers}} have experimented with growing the variety in plastic tunnels which {{can create a}} greenhouse effect and protect the grapes from the less than ideal climate of the wine region. While <b>the</b> <b>grape</b> is permitted to be planted in some German wine regions (such as the Mosel), the vineyard sites best suited for ripening Cabernet are generally already occupied with Riesling; many producers are ill-inclined to uproot the popular German variety in favor of Cabernet Sauvignon. In the 1980s, inexpensive Bulgarian Cabernet Sauvignon was highly touted for its value and helped to establish that country's wine industry and garner it more international presence in the wine market. <b>The</b> <b>grape</b> is performing a similar function for many countries in Eastern Europe, including Turkey, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Georgia, Hungary, Moldova, Romania, Slovenia, and Ukraine.

5|$|J. Grossman's Sons began {{manufacturing}} Grapico in 1914.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>grape</b> was domesticated between 7,000 and 4,000 BC {{between the}} Black Sea and Persia; archaeological {{evidence}} shows that wine was being made there by 6,000 BC, reaching Greece and Crete in the fifth millennium BC and Spain by the last millennium BC.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to follow up the {{evolution}} of both the physico-chemical indices and the dynamics of the oxidative enzymes during the maturation of white grapes, more particularly until <b>the</b> <b>grapes</b> reach technological maturity. Studying the dynamics of the physico-chemical indices during the maturation of <b>the</b> <b>grapes</b> an increase of the content of glucides, polyphenols, antiocyanins, simultaneously with the decrease of the acidity was noticed. The enzymatic activity of tyrosinase is high at the moment when <b>the</b> <b>grapes</b> are in <b>the</b> beginning of the ripening period and afterwards it presents a decline during the ripening of <b>the</b> <b>grapes,</b> having a relatively low level before harvesting. The enzymatic activity of the laccase increases up till the full maturity of <b>the</b> <b>grapes,</b> then it decreses a little before the harvesting of the fruit, having lower values than at the start of ripening.

5|$|While {{the period}} when the name Cabernet Sauvignon became more {{prevalent}} over Petite Vidure is not certain, records indicate that <b>the</b> <b>grape</b> was a popular Bordeaux planting in the 18th century Médoc region.

5|$|A map of Kintzheim in Alsace from 1348 {{contains}} the text zu dem Russelinge, {{but it is}} not certain that this reference is to <b>the</b> <b>grape</b> variety.

5|$|Historically, <b>the</b> <b>grape</b> was {{fermented}} {{and shipped}} north to Tuscany and Piedmont, {{where it was}} used as a blending grape to enhance the body of thin red wines produced in those areas. When the link between Primitivo and Zinfandel began to emerge, plantings in the region and production of non-blended varietal increased. Today most Italian Primitivo is made as a rustic, highly alcoholic red wine with up to 16% alcohol by volume (ABV). Some Italian winemakers age the wines in new American oak to imitate American-style Zinfandel.|$|E

40|$|The {{bachelor}} thesis process {{current literature}} dealing with partial deleafing around grapes during vegetation period {{and its impact}} on sugar and acid level in grapes. No own experiment was made. Deleafing the plant around <b>the</b> <b>grapes</b> during vegetation season may lead to higher quality of <b>the</b> <b>grapes.</b> It is, however, necessary to know basic deleafing rules. An excessive deleafing leads to overexposing <b>the</b> <b>grapes.</b> Such exposure causes negative effects, for example sunburn. Optimal deleafing (1 - 3 leaves and shoots around <b>the</b> <b>grapes)</b> exposes <b>the</b> <b>grapes</b> in an ideal way and they are warmed. The warming reduces the malic acid level and allows better sugar production. A variety sensitive deleafing of grapevine is recommended. Weather and station are also important factors. The work in wineyard demands manpower and it is time consuming. Still it pays off as this thesis shows...|$|R

5|$|In the Sauternes region, <b>the</b> <b>grape</b> is {{blended with}} Sémillon {{to make the}} late harvest wine, Sauternes. The {{composition}} of Sauvignon blanc varies from producer and can range from 5-50% with the Premier Cru Supérieur Château d'Yquem using 20%. A traditional practice often employed in Sauternes is to plant one Sauvignon Blanc vine at regular intervals among rows of Sémillon. However, Sauvignon blanc's propensity to ripen 1–2 weeks earlier can lead the grapes to lose some of their intensity and aroma as they hang longer on the vine. This has prompted more producers to isolate their parcels of Sauvignon blanc.|$|E
5|$|Since almost its {{inception}} in 1914, Grapico was associated with real grape juice by J. Grossman's Sons through its advertisements and business stationery. Publicly associating Grapico with genuine grape juice allowed J. Grossman's Sons to compete directly with real grape juice producers such as Welch Grape Juice Co. and have an advantage over other imitation grape flavored beverage producers. A problem with this approach was that Grapico was an artificial grape drink that included neither real grape juice nor fruit from <b>the</b> <b>grape.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Bordeaux wine region {{accounts}} for more than 60% of the Cabernet Sauvignon grown in France. Outside of Bordeaux, Cabernet Sauvignon is found in varying quantities throughout Le Midi and in the Loire Valley. In general, Cabernet Sauvignon wines are lighter and less structured, drinkable much earlier than Bordeaux wine. In the southwest French appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOCs) of Bergerac and Buzet it is used to make rosé wine. In some regions it is used to add flavor and structure to Carignan while it is blended with Négrette in Gaillac and Fronton as well as Tannat in Madiran. In Provence, <b>the</b> <b>grape</b> had some presence in the region in the mid 19th century, when viticulturist Jules Guyot recommended it as a blending partner with Syrah. In recent years, several Midi wine estates, such as Mas de Daumas Gassac have received international acclaim for their Cabernet Sauvignon blended in Hérault, with Rhône grapes like Syrah. It is often made as a single varietal in the vin de pays of the Languedoc. The influence of Australian flying winemakers has been considerable in how Cabernet Sauvignon is treated by some Languedoc wine estates, with some producers making wines that can seem like they are from the New World. Overall, <b>the</b> <b>grape</b> has not exerted it dominance of the region, generally considered less ideally situated to the dry climate than Syrah. The Languedoc producers who give serious consideration to Cabernet Sauvignon, generally rely on irrigation to compensate for the climate.|$|E
