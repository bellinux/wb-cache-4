5|$|The poem, {{written in}} free verse in 206 lines, uses {{many of the}} {{literary}} techniques associated with the pastoral elegy. It {{was written in the}} summer of 1865 during a period of profound national mourning {{in the aftermath of the}} assassination of President Abraham Lincoln on April 14, 1865. Despite the poem being an elegy to the fallen president, Whitman neither mentions Lincoln by name nor discusses the circumstances of his death. Instead, Whitman uses a series of rural and natural imagery including the symbols of the lilacs, a drooping star in the western sky (Venus), and the hermit thrush, and employs the traditional progression of the pastoral elegy in moving from grief toward an acceptance and knowledge of death. The poem also addresses <b>the</b> <b>pity</b> of war through imagery vaguely referencing the American Civil War (1861–1865) which ended only days before the assassination.|$|E

The exploitation of oil that goes {{back to the beginning of}} the 20th Century is presented as the catalyst of conditions that led to the ecological disaster of Dust Bowl.

500|$|The {{relationship}} between Chamberlain and Lloyd George was thenceforth one of hatred, with Chamberlain calling Lloyd George [...] "that dirty little Welsh Attorney" [...] and being implacably opposed to Lloyd George joining the National Government in the 1930s. Austen Chamberlain, {{the brother of}} one opponent and, for a time, the political ally of the other, regretted the enmity, [...] "More's <b>the</b> <b>pity,</b> for together if they were together they might do a great deal." [...] Lloyd George would later paint a most unflattering portrait of Chamberlain in his 1935 War Memoirs, claiming that “Mr Chamberlain {{is a man of}} rigid competency. Such men have their uses in conventional times … and are indispensable for filling subordinate posts at all times. But they are lost in an emergency or in creative tasks at any time.” HIs dislike of Chamberlain is sometimes said to have been based on phrenology, although little contemporary evidence has been found to confirm this. Lloyd George would also have the last laugh in May 1940, when his speech in the Norway Debate helped bring down Chamberlain’s government.|$|E
500|$|It {{was then}} an annual custom for the Pope {{to receive a}} {{delegation}} from Rome's Jewish community shortly after the New Year. The meeting on 2 February 1859 quickly descended into a heated argument, with Pope Pius berating the Jewish visitors for [...] "stirring up a storm all over Europe about this Mortara case". When the delegation denied that the Jews of Rome had had any hand in the anti-clerical articles, the Pope dismissed Scazzocchio as inexperienced and foolish, then shouted: [...] "The newspapers can write all they want. I couldn't care less what the world thinks!" [...] The Pope then calmed down somewhat: [...] "So strong is <b>the</b> <b>pity</b> I have for you, that I pardon you, indeed, I must pardon you." [...] One of the delegates proposed that the Church should not give so much credence to Morisi's testimony, given her spurious morals—the Pope countered that regardless of her character, so {{far as he could}} see the servant had no reason to invent such a story, and in any case Momolo Mortara should not have employed a Catholic in the first place.|$|E

500|$|With {{the first}} play of the season imminent, the Horderns moved to Stratford and took {{temporary}} accommodation at Goldicote House, a large country property situated on the River Avon. The first of his two plays, The Tempest, caused Hordern to doubt his own acting ability when he compared his interpretation of Caliban to that of Alec Guinness, who had played the same role four years earlier. [...] Reassured by Byam Shaw, Hordern remained in the role for the entire run. A few days later, the actor was thrilled to receive a letter of appreciation from Michael Redgrave, who thought Hordern's Caliban was [...] "immensely fine, with all <b>the</b> <b>pity</b> and pathos... but with real terror and humour as well". More praise was received as the season continued; an anonymous theatre reviewer, quoted in Hordern's autobiography, called the actor's portrayal of Menenius Aggripa [...] "a dryly acute study of the 'humorous patrician' and one moreover that can move our compassion in the Volscian cameo", before going on to say [...] "we had felt {{that it would be}} long before Alec Guinness's Menenius could be matched. The fact that Michael Hordern's different reading can now stand beside the other does credit to a player who will be a Stratford prize." ...|$|E
500|$|When Egerton-Warburton {{took over}} the estate, the hall was [...] "dilapidated and {{swarming}} with rats", and {{so he decided to}} replace it completely. He took great interest {{in the design of the}} new house and chapel, and his ideas reflected respectively his artistic and his religious values. [...] In respect of the house, he was influenced by the spirit of the Romantic movement. [...] He also wanted the new house to reflect his ancient lineage: [...] "to suggest something of <b>the</b> <b>pity</b> of the Middle Ages as well as the grandeur of Elizabethan England". He therefore rejected the neoclassical style of architecture, which was fashionable at the time, and chose instead to build a house in what is now known as Jacobethan style. [...] He also wanted it to incorporate modern technology and materials in its construction, and he did not want it to be too expensive. [...] He commissioned a young local architect, George Latham from Nantwich, and worked closely with him in the design. [...] Latham suggested that the final cost would be in the region of £5,000–6,000 (£–£ today). It was agreed that every architectural feature of the house should have an exact model in an existing Elizabethan building. [...] Egerton-Warburton and Latham travelled together and visited such buildings to study these features.|$|E

50|$|A person {{experiencing}} pity {{will experience}} {{a combination of}} intense sorrow and mercy for the person or creature, often giving <b>the</b> <b>pitied</b> some kind of aid, physical help, and/or financial assistance. Although pity may be confused with compassion, empathy, commiseration, condolence, or sympathy, pity is different from all of these. Nietzsche pointed out that since all people to some degree value self-esteem and self-worth, pity can negatively affect any situation. Additionally, pity may actually be psychologically harmful to the pitied: Self-pity and depression can sometimes {{be the result of}} the power imbalance fostered by pity, sometimes with extremely negative psychological and psycho-social consequences for <b>the</b> <b>pitied</b> party.|$|R

2500|$|Throughout the 1940s and 1950s Pears {{continually}} {{expanded his}} recital and concert repertoire. He sang his first Gerontius in 1944, and the tenor part in Das Lied von der Erde {{in the same}} year. From the late 1940s he gained an international reputation as the Evangelist in the St Matthew Passion. The music critic David Cairns wrote, [...] "Pears's interpretation of the evangelist's part in the Bach Passions seemed complete as no other singer's: it encompassed every turn in the drama, <b>the</b> <b>pity,</b> the anger, the despair, the resignation." [...] In Lieder by Schubert, Schumann and others he was almost always accompanied by Britten, a partnership that Headington calls [...] "as nearly an artistic unity as could be imagined"; Cairns calls their Lieder performances [...] "never to be forgotten". They made recordings for Decca of Die schöne Müllerin, Winterreise and [...] Dichterliebe that have remained in print since their first issue in the 1960s.|$|E
