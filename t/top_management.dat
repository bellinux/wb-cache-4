Different board structures are optimal for different firms. Moreover, the ability of the board to monitor the firm's executives is a function of its access to information. Executive directors possess superior knowledge of the decision-making process and therefore evaluate <b>top</b> <b>management</b> {{on the basis of the}} quality of its decisions that lead to financial performance outcomes, ex ante.
