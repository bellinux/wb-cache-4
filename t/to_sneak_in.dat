Instead, at least 50,000—including {{tens of thousands of}} Dahl's adherents—packed the stadium, and thousands more continued <b>to</b> <b>sneak</b> <b>in</b> even after gates were closed. Many of the records were not collected by staff and were thrown like flying discs from the stands. After Dahl blew up the collected records, thousands of fans stormed the field and remained there until dispersed by riot police.|$|E
5|$|The film shows Luttrell (Wahlberg) {{being able}} to walk after the Taliban's ambush on the four-man SEAL team. In reality, Luttrell {{explained}} that his legs were numb immediately after the ambush, and when feeling did return to them, the pain from the shrapnel in his legs made it too painful to walk; he had to crawl seven miles looking for water and sanctuary. Luttrell {{also said that he}} did not witness the MH-47 Chinook helicopter being shot down, as seen in the film. At the end of the film, the Pashtun villagers fight off a Taliban attack in a firefight that never actually happened. In reality, the Taliban fighters were outnumbered by the villagers and had no intentions of attacking the village. They did, however, try <b>to</b> <b>sneak</b> <b>in</b> and capture Luttrell in secret. Luttrell also did not go into cardiac arrest after he was rescued, nor was he near death, as seen in the film.|$|E
5|$|The Simpsons {{drive to}} the park for a picnic but {{discover}} {{that it has been}} overrun by mosquitoes. While heading home, the family finds an Indian casino. Bart is turned away because of his age but is able <b>to</b> <b>sneak</b> <b>in</b> by hiding in ventriloquist Arthur Crandall's dummy case. During Crandall's performance at the casino, Bart bursts out of the case and gets caught by casino guards.

Brian then explains that Stewie has a 'tumor' {{shaped like a}} football, which convinces Miley to let them hang out with her backstage. Miley and Stewie quickly become best friends and they sing a song which Stewie wrote. Soon, Chris realizes that the Monkey has {{spent more time with}} him, like taking him to play baseball and going to a father and son BBQ in Monkeykid. Chris then says to Peter that he has never gave as much attention to him as the monkey has, so he grows to resent his own father. While having ice-cream with Miley, Stewie notices a signal interference on her cell phone when handing it to her. He then realises something is strange about Miley. Upon spying on her, Stewie and Brian discover that she is actually an android after seeing an employee insert a USB drive on the control panel on Miley's back. They both realized that Miley was created by Walt Disney Imagineering to become the perfect teen idol that can never fail. When Brian curiously asks if she can perform other tasks, Stewie agrees to reprogram Miley to have sex with Brian by gaining access to the control panel. However, it goes wrong and he accidentally sends Miley into a rage, forcing Stewie and Brian to run away from the monstrous Miley.|$|E
25|$|Once in the match, Sakuraba {{was able}} <b>to</b> <b>sneak</b> <b>in</b> a double leg {{takedown}} after Funaki committed heavily to a missed right cross. Funaki closed guard around Sakuraba before opening {{it up to}} spin for a kneebar, {{and for a moment}} Funaki appeared to secure Sakuraba's leg, but he was thwarted by a combination of Sakuraba's submission acumen and their position against the ring ropes. Sakuraba then maneuvered to Funaki's back, only for the Pancrase founder to roll back into the guard position. Breaking away momentarily from the grappling contest, Sakuraba stood up and began to assault Funaki's legs with a series of kicks, which Funaki answered with an upkick of his own, cutting Sakuraba's eye. Kazushi then returned himself to the ground, where Funaki immediately attempted to sweep him, but Sakuraba blocked the attempt and secured a Kimura lock or double wristlock, eventually forcing Funaki to submit.|$|E
25|$|The Ronnie Johns Half Hour {{was created}} after representatives from Channel 10 saw a {{performance}} of The Third Degree's stage show, and were impressed by the cast and characters. They offered the group the chance to film a pilot. Originally, the cast {{was going to call}} the show The 3rd Degree, after the name of their performance group. Channel 10, however, liked the idea of Ronnie Johns being the host, so they asked if the show could be renamed after him. In response, The 3rd Degree came up with a title that they felt was ridiculously long, The Ronnie Johns Good Times Campfire Jamboree Half Hour Show (Now on Television). The network shortened it to The Ronnie Johns Half Hour. Despite this, the writers, cast and prop designers try <b>to</b> <b>sneak</b> <b>in</b> The 3rd Degree's logo as much as possible in sketches. For example, football jerseys will have The 3rd Degree as their sponsor.|$|E

500|$|The {{first section}} of footage to be filmed were montage shots of the band walking around Boscoreale, mixed with shots of {{volcanic}} mud, which {{can be seen at}} various points in [...] "Echoes" [...] and [...] "Careful with That Axe, Eugene".

[...] During the same scene Casey mutters [...] "I have a bad feeling about this," [...] a catch-phrase used by characters throughout the film series. The series is twice referenced directly, by Chuck when Sarah fails to understand his [...] "Chewie" [...] reference, and by Casey, who says, [...] "This {{is what happens when}} you draw your plans from Star Wars."

Dr. Hibbert tells Comic Book Guy that he needs to take a break from running the store and to leave it in the care of friends. Since he actually doesn't have any friends, Comic Book Guy reluctantly leaves the store in Bart and Milhouse's care. The store becomes wildly successful under the management of the two boys, only to lose much of its newfound prosperity after Milhouse goes overboard in ordering a shipment of two thousand comics depicting [...] "Biclops", a superhero with thick glasses, which flops spectacularly.|$|E
2500|$|Social {{networking}} services foster {{learning through}} what Jenkins (2006) {{describes as a}} [...] "participatory culture". A participatory culture consists of a space that allows engagement, sharing, mentoring, and an opportunity for social interaction. Participants of social network services avail of this opportunity. Informal learning, in the forms of participatory and social learning online, is an excellent tool for teachers <b>to</b> <b>sneak</b> <b>in</b> material and ideas that students will identify with and therefore, in a secondary manner, students will learn skills that would normally be taught in a formal setting in the more interesting and engaging environment of social learning. Sites like Twitter provide students {{with the opportunity to}} converse and collaborate with others in real time.|$|E

With mystic powers, he raises a vision of Antonia's dead mother and induces Antonia to sing, causing her death. Crespel arrives just in time to witness his daughter's last breath. Hoffmann enters the room and Crespel wants to kill him, thinking that he is responsible for his daughter's death. Nicklausse saves his friend from the old man's vengeance.|$|E
