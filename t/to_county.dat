One involved a four-lane subsea tunnel, one involved building a second, two-lane bridge immediately adjacent to the current one, which would {{give the impression of}} a single bridge, another involved a new four-lane bridge slightly to the south, and the last involved a new bridge considerably further to the south, which would connect <b>to</b> <b>County</b> Road 557.|$|E
5|$|In 1960, {{the section}} of M-69 east of Randville was decommissioned, and the {{concurrency}} with M-95 was removed. This truncated the highway to , approximately one-fifth of its previous length. The transfer <b>to</b> <b>county</b> control {{was part of a}} program to reduce the total state highway mileage in the state. After October 5, 1970, this section was renamed G-30 with the beginning of the County-Designated Highway program in Michigan.|$|E
5|$|M-91 {{was formed}} when M-66 was rerouted in the 1940s. At the time, the highway {{continued}} south to Lowell, but subsequent transfers or roadway sections have truncated {{the route to}} its present form.

5|$|A {{road from}} New Albany to north of Center Village first {{appeared}} on maps in 1924. In 1929, the road was extended to connect to Condit. SR 605 was designated in 1937, following the alignment from US 62, to a junction with the US 36/SR 3 concurrency in Condit. By 1994, jurisdiction of the portion of SR 605 between SR 37 and the US 36/SR 3 concurrency was transferred from the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) to Delaware County, who renamed the road <b>to</b> <b>County</b> Road 605.

5|$|A roadway {{was present}} along parts of today's H-58 {{by the late}} 1920s; initially, this county road was gravel or earth between Munising and Kingston Corners and {{connected}} with other roads to Grand Marais. In the 1930s, another segment was built to connect to Deer Park and {{to fill in the}} gap between Kingston Corners and Grand Marais. The southwestern segment between Munising and Van Meer formed part of M-94 from 1929 until it was transferred back <b>to</b> <b>county</b> control in the early 1960s.|$|E
5|$|After {{entering}} Middlesex County, Route 18 continues {{north as}} a freeway, entering Old Bridge Township. After interchanging with U.S. Route 9 (exit 30), the freeway ends, and the route becomes an arterial highway through a mostly wooded commercial stretch of Old Bridge. The route crosses several roads in this area. It then passes under County Route 516 and County Route 527 (Old Bridge-Matawan Road), {{but has no}} northbound interchange to connect with them; motorists have to travel through a residential area to access these roads. On the southbound side, motorists can use a cloverleaf or Englishtown Road. Route 18 then enters East Brunswick, then interchanging with Middlesex County Route 615, which also connects <b>to</b> <b>County</b> Route 527.|$|E
5|$|Amid {{difficulties}} in her personal life, Lansbury moved from California <b>to</b> <b>County</b> Cork, Ireland, in 1970, and continued {{with a variety}} of theatrical and cinematic appearances throughout that decade. These included leading roles in the stage musicals Gypsy, , and The King and I, {{as well as in the}} hit Disney film Bedknobs and Broomsticks (1971). Moving into television, she achieved worldwide fame as fictional writer and sleuth Jessica Fletcher in the American whodunit series Murder, She Wrote, which ran for twelve seasons from 1984 until 1996, becoming one of the longest-running and most popular detective drama series in television history. Through Corymore Productions, a company that she co-owned with her husband Peter Shaw, Lansbury assumed ownership of the series and was its executive producer for the final four seasons. She also moved into voice work, thereby contributing to animated films such as Disney's Beauty and the Beast (1991). Since then, she has toured in a variety of international theatrical productions and continued to make occasional film appearances.|$|E

5|$|CR492 was {{previously}} {{known as the}} Marquette–Negaunee Road before it was made {{a part of the}} State Trunkline Highway System. It was originally designated as a part of M-15 as early as 1917. The superintendent of the Marquette County Road Commission, Kenneth Ingalls Sawyer, painted the first rural highway centerline on the roadway on Dead Man's Curve. The highway was later a part of M-28 before being transferred back <b>to</b> <b>county</b> control. The highway assumed its current form by 2001. The eastern section along Brookton Road in Marquette Township was redesignated as a county secondary highway when a new connection to US41/M-28 was opened, and the designation was extended along Wright Street on the west and north sides of Marquette.|$|E
5|$|Croatia is {{traditionally}} divided into numerous, often overlapping geographic regions, whose borders {{are not always}} clearly defined. The largest and most readily recognizable ones throughout the country are Central Croatia (also described as the Zagreb macro-region), Eastern Croatia (largely corresponding with Slavonia), and Mountainous Croatia (Lika and Gorski Kotar; {{to the west of}} Central Croatia). These three comprise the inland or continental part of Croatia. Coastal Croatia consists of a further two regions: Dalmatia or the southern littoral, between the general area of the city of Zadar and the southernmost tip of the country; and the northern littoral located north of Dalmatia, encompassing the Croatian Littoral and Istria. The geographical regions generally do not conform <b>to</b> <b>county</b> boundaries or other administrative divisions, and all of them encompass further, more specific, geographic regions.|$|E
5|$|During {{the time}} that Loring was {{proposed}} for closure, the region experienced economic uncertainty. Once the Air Force made its intent known in 1976, property values plummeted, and people delayed buying homes, fearing that {{they would need to}} relocate. The reduction in the base of around 80% meant that possibly 60% of Aroostook County would need to relocate, according <b>to</b> <b>county</b> officials. A $25,000 study, commissioned by the Department of Labor and conducted at Northeastern University, calculated that the region had lost over $14 million in these three years of economic uncertainty.|$|E
