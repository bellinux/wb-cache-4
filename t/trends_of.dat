40|$|One of the {{expected}} benefits of the Sulu-Celebes Sea Project during its implementation is to have increased fish stocks at demonstration sites, {{as indicated by the}} Catch per Unit of Effort (CPUE).

By using the pajeko as the standardized fishing gear the <b>trend</b> <b>of</b> CPUE has been calculated. Between 2000 - 2005, the <b>trend</b> <b>of</b> production (catch), effort and CPUE followed the general pattern of the exploited fisheries that already fully exploited, where the increasing <b>trend</b> <b>of</b> effort was not followed by the increasing catch. On the other hand, the <b>trend</b> <b>of</b> CPUE is decreased. In the following years, the <b>trend</b> <b>of</b> both catch and CPUE do not follow the general pattern of the exploited fisheries. The <b>trend</b> <b>of</b> catch, effort and CPUE has likely been stable, indicating that the fishery in this period has been leveled-off. The status of exploitation of the small pelagic fish resources in the Indonesian Sulawesi Sea is demermined by the MSY level that has likely been surpassed during the period 2003 - 2004. Therefore with the increasing effort in the following year the <b>trend</b> <b>of</b> catch was relatively stable.

40|$|Introduction: Lung {{cancer is}} the leading cause of death in Hong Kong amongst all {{communicable}} and non- communicable disease. Historically, lung cancer was seen mainly in people smoke tobacco. There have been significantly strong evidences supporting the correlation between tobacco smoke and lung cancer. Tobacco smoking in major public places has been banned since 2007. In addition, the air quality is also improving over last decades. However, the incidence of lung cancer continues to rise, with more than 4600 cases reported in 2012. In female particularly, the daily smoker prevalence is lower in female and it seems to be stable over the last decades. The specific <b>trend</b> <b>of</b> lung cancer incidence in female has not been studied since 2004. Therefore, the <b>trend</b> <b>of</b> lung cancer is uncertain. Aims and Objectives: The aim is to investigate whether the downtrend of lung cancer in substantial during the period of 1983 through 2012. The objective is to describe the <b>trends</b> through parameterization <b>of</b> the effect of age, period and cohort. An exploratory analysis was conducted to study the <b>trend</b> <b>of</b> adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma of lung. Method: Lung cancer incidence data was analysed graphically and statistically utilising generalised linear Age- period- cohort model fitting technique with the R package. Result: The general lung cancer trend in female from 1983 through 2012 was decreasing. The effects of age and cohort are negative but vary over the spectrum of age and cohort respectively. A modest increase in relative risk of lung cancer is seen during 2001 through 2012. An increasing <b>trend</b> <b>of</b> adenocarcinoma and decreasing <b>trend</b> <b>of</b> squamous cell carcinoma are seen. Conclusion: Lung cancer incidence rate continues to decrease. However, there is a sign <b>of</b> increasing <b>trend</b> <b>of</b> incidence rate of adenocarcinoma. Further research on <b>trend</b> <b>of</b> adenocarcinoma of female in Hong Kong is warranted. published_or_final_versionPublic HealthMasterMaster of Public Healt...|$|R
