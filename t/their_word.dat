5|$|Critics {{argue that}} {{theories}} of constraints {{focus on how}} children learn nouns, but ignore other aspects of <b>their</b> <b>word</b> learning. Although constraints are useful in explaining how children limit possible meanings when learning novel words, the same constraints would eventually need to be overridden {{because they are not}} utilized in adult language. For instance, adult speakers often use several terms, each term meaning something slightly different, when referring to one entity, such as a family pet. This practice would violate the mutual exclusivity constraint.|$|E

5|$|The emergentist {{coalition}} model {{suggests that}} children {{make use of}} multiple cues to successfully attach a novel label to a novel object. The word learning situation may offer an infant combinations of social, perceptual, cognitive, and linguistic cues. While a range of cues {{are available from the}} start of word learning, it may be the case that not all cues are utilized by the infant when they begin the word learning process. While younger children may only be able to detect a limited number of cues, older, more experienced word learners may be able to make use of a range of cues. For instance, young children seem to focus primarily on perceptual salience, but older children attend to the gaze of caregivers and use the focus of caregivers to direct <b>their</b> <b>word</b> mapping. Therefore, this model argues that principles or cues may be present from the onset of word learning, but the use {{of a wide range of}} cues develops over time.|$|E

25|$|Both contestants {{write down}} the words they form, in case they select the same one. After time runs out, the host asks the contestants to declare <b>their</b> <b>word</b> lengths, {{starting}} with the contestant who chose the letters. The host then asks the discovered words, starting with the shorter declared length. However, if a contestant fails to write a word in time, they must declare this fact and state <b>their</b> <b>word</b> first to prevent cheating. The contestant with the longer word scores one point per letter, or 18 points if they have used all nine. If the words are identical or of the same length, both contestants score. In the former case, the contestants must show their written word {{to prove that they}} are the same. Each round ends with Dictionary Corner revealing the longest words that can be formed from the available letters, aided by the production team.|$|E

25|$|Miller has {{collected}} two Turkish traditions about {{the fall of}} Trebizond. One tells how {{the citizens of the}} city, expecting an army to arrive before dawn that would force the Sultan to lift the siege, agreed to surrender at cock-crow. However, on that occasion the roosters crowed in the small hours of the night, whereupon the Turks forced the city-dwellers to keep <b>their</b> <b>word.</b> The other describes how a girl, dressed in black, held out in the tower of the palace, and when all was lost, leaped to her death from its heights; consequently that tower was called Kara kızın saray ("The Black Girl's palace").|$|E

25|$|Nine of {{the sons}} {{returned}} to their father Israel from Egypt, stockpiled with grain on their donkeys. They relayed to their father all that had happened in Egypt.

He couldn't understand how they were put in a position to tell the Egyptians all about their family.

Israel then became angry with the loss of Joseph, Simeon, and now possibly Benjamin.|$|E
25|$|The Bulgarians and the Byzantines {{agreed to}} a joint {{campaign}} against Serbia, but it took five years until the differences and tensions between Bulgaria and Byzantium were overcome. Michael Shishman gathered 15,000 troops and invaded Serbia. He engaged the Serbian king Stephen Dečanski, who commanded an approximately equal force, near the border town of Velbazhd. The two rulers, both expecting reinforcements, {{agreed to a}} one-day truce but when a Catalan detachment under the king's son Stephen Dušan arrived, the Serbs broke <b>their</b> <b>word.</b> The Bulgarians were defeated in the ensuing Battle of Velbazhd and their emperor perished. Despite their victory, the Serbs did not risk an invasion of Bulgaria and the two sides agreed to peace. As a result, Ivan Stephen, the eldest son of the dead emperor by his Serbian wife, succeeded him in Tarnovo and was deposed after a brief rule. Bulgaria did not lose territory but could not stop the Serbian expansion in Macedonia.|$|E
25|$|On 10 June 1940, {{the forces}} in Northern Norway capitulated, a ceasefire {{having been in}} place since 24:00 on 9 June.

Before releasing the Norwegian officers from captivity, the Germans demanded that each gave <b>their</b> <b>word</b> of honour {{not to participate in}} further resistance. Following the Norwegian capitulation, Colonel Løken worked on maintaining order and calm in Northern Norway in the transition phase to German occupation. Løken had been made the acting commander of the 6th Division in the demobilization phase, retaining a 10-man force of armed military police under his command until 27 July 1940. The military police officers worked on returning requisitioned civilian vehicles and organizing military depots. Once the tasks in connection with the demobilization of the Norwegian forces in the north were completed, Løken returned to his home in Mosjøen.|$|E
