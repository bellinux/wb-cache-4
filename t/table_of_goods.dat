40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{an explanation of}} the emergence of the standard textbook definition of public goods {{in the middle of the}} 20 th century. It focuses on Richard Musgrave's contribution in defining public goods as non-rival and non-excludable - from 1939 to 1969. Although Samuelson's mathematical definition is generally used in models of public goods, the qualitative understanding of the specificity of pure public goods owes more to Musgrave's emphasis on the impossibility of exclusion. This paper also highlights the importance of the size of the group to which benefits of a public good accrue. This analysis allow for a reassessment of the Summary <b>table</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> which first appeared in Musgrave and Musgrave (1973) textbook...|$|E

40|$|An {{interleaver}} is {{a critical}} component for the channel coding performance of turbo codes. Algebraic constructions are important because they admit analytical designs and simple, practical hardware implementation. The spread factor of an interleaver is a common measure for turbo coding applications. Maximum-spread interleavers are interleavers whose spread factors achieve the upper bound. An infinite sequence of quadratic permutation polynomials over integer rings that generate maximum-spread interleavers is presented. New properties of permutation polynomial interleavers are investigated from an algebraic-geometric perspective resulting in a new non-linearity metric for interleavers. A new interleaver metric that {{is a function of}} both the non-linearity metric and the spread factor is proposed. It is numerically demonstrated that the spread factor has a diminishing importance with the block length. A <b>table</b> <b>of</b> <b>good</b> interleavers for a variety of interleaver lengths according to the new metric is listed. Extensive computer simulation results with impressive frame error rates confirm the efficacy of the new metric. Further, when tail-biting constituent codes are used, the resulting turbo codes are quasi-cyclic. Comment: 25 pages, 11 figures, 6 tables, submitted to IEEE Trans. on Inform. Theor...|$|R

Structured interviews were conducted with 300 ART patients. Data were analysed using SPSS version 13 and presented in charts, graphs and frequency <b>tables.</b> Motivators <b>of</b> <b>good</b> adherence were identified as disclosure of HIV positive status to more than one person, frequent adherence counselling, self-efficacy to adhere to ART, positive interactions between patients and healthcare providers; and using an adherence partner. Barriers to adherence were forgetfulness, transportation costs to and from the clinic, time away from work and side effects. There was a strong positive correlation between adherence, CD 4 counts and viral load. Adherence was closely tied to immunologic and virologic improvements.

40|$|Process tables is a {{tool for}} {{presenting}} and explaining in a tabular form what sources are used {{and what happens to}} the source figures in the process of compiling national accounts. In Norway the first attempt to produce some sort <b>of</b> process <b>table</b> was carried out in the early 2000 s. The use <b>of</b> the <b>table</b> was first and foremost to inform the various statistical divisions within Statistics Norway of what happens to “their figures” in the national accounts. During the same period Eurostat developed at set <b>of</b> process <b>tables</b> to accompany the detailed documentation of the national accounts in terms of an Inventory for each member country. The Eurostat guidelines on process tables were given in the document Eurostat/C 1 /GNIC/ 054 and presented in 2005. Norway compiled {{for the first time a}} process <b>table</b> <b>of</b> the Eurostat type as part of the 2007 Inventory. The tables were modified following the Eurostat visits to Statistics Norway in 2009 and 2010. These first attempts in compiling process tables were largely done manually as a sub-routine subsequent to the compilation of the final national accounts. Clear lessons from these experiences were that to achieve <b>tables</b> <b>of</b> <b>good</b> quality and in an efficient way the tables must be compiled as an integrated part of the national accounts compilation process itself and as much as possible in an automated way. The crucial questions to be answered in designing a system for the compilation <b>of</b> process <b>tables</b> in practice are what technical platform to use and at what level of details and at what frequency should the tables be compiled? Also, what structure or type of characteristics should be used in the tables – identical to those <b>of</b> the Euorstat <b>tables</b> or are there special needs of Statistics Norway to be taken into account? This report addresses these questions and presents the new system for process tables in the Norwegian national accounts. This system is built to serve both the needs of Eurostat and some additional needs of Statistic Norway. The tables will be compiled on an annual basis as part of the routines of compiling the final national accounts. However, as the report reveals, although the structure and design <b>of</b> all the <b>tables</b> have been finalized, some follow-up work will have to be done to finalize the routines for filling in all the process tables. This concerns in particular the household final consumption and exports and imports <b>of</b> the <b>table</b> for the expenditure measure, and the tables for the income measure and the table for transition from GDP to GNI...|$|R

40|$|Kant {{takes up}} the {{problems}} of the concepts <b>of</b> <b>good</b> and evil as objects of practical reason. He argues that an idea of some object that determines the will is regarded as good or evil, and when it has any concrete substance, it is empirically known, and is judged by the feeling of pleasure and displeasure. Only when an idea of some object is that of a formal law, it undergoes a priori judgment. He dismisses as fundamentally wrong the traditional ethical theories which regard the concepts <b>of</b> <b>good</b> and evil as the ground that determines the will, because only after the establishment of the moral law, the concept <b>of</b> <b>good</b> and evil can be determined, the former being heteronomy of the will which cannot be the true theory of ethics. After establishing that the moral laws are the a priori determining ground of the will, Kant presents a <b>table</b> <b>of</b> the categories of practical reason with reference to the cocepts <b>of</b> <b>good</b> and evil. This table corresponds to the <b>table</b> <b>of</b> the categories of the pure concepts of understanding. It is based on the a priori moral laws, but he begins with the inquiry into the empirically conditioned concepts <b>of</b> <b>good,</b> proceeding by generalization to the empirically unconditioned laws. In this argumentation of Kant's we see a problem of how to understand the relation between the empirical and the a priori in the concepts <b>of</b> <b>good</b> and evil. The moral laws must be established a priori and be recognized as such. However they are always realized by the empirical conditions of human life, and so they constitute the concepts <b>of</b> <b>good</b> and evil. ...|$|R

The control methods of Bactrocera oleae (Gmelin) used by Sicilian organic farms were surveyed in 2004 and 2005. After a bibliographic search on internet and by personal contacts, a sample of 30 organic farms in Sicily was chosen; 23 farms produce bottled extra-virgin oil and 7 produce table olives. Then farms were contacted by phone, some of them visited and olive growers were interviewed. For each farm were put together data about: interventions vs. the olive fruit fly, altitude, surface of the olive grove, olive cultivar, irrigation method, harvesting period, milling procedure, product destination and production results in 2005 and in the previous years. From collected data we can say that obtaining oils of excellent quality and <b>table</b> olives <b>of</b> <b>good</b> quality in organic farming is surely possible; the early harvesting and a quick milling (for the oil) let to obtain good results. The most used interventions are: mass trapping with ammonium carbonate, pheromone and pyrethroids, bottled-traps baited with sardines, yellow sticky traps, sprays with kaolin, Bordeaux mixture or pyrethrum, but {{there is more than one}} third of sampled oil producers not using any control method except early harvesting and a quick milling. Unfortunately the organic farms producing table olives in Sicily are very few, perhaps because, differently from olive oil producers, table olive plantings are almost all young and the experience of growers in such organic cultivation is not strong. Also these growers prefer to use mass trapping to control olive fruit fly, but best results were achieved by farmers spraying kaolin, rotenone or copper hydroxide. ...|$|R
