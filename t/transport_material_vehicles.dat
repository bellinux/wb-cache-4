40|$|The {{proposed}} <b>vehicle,</b> the Lunar <b>Material</b> <b>Transport</b> <b>Vehicle</b> (LMTV), has {{a mission}} objective of efficient lunar soil <b>material</b> <b>transport.</b> The LMTV {{was designed to}} meet a required set of performance specifications while operating under a given set of constraints. The LMTV is essentially an articulated steering, double-ended dump truck. The vehicle moves on four wheels and has two identical chassis halves. Each half consists of a chassis frame, a material bucket, two wheels with integral curvilinear synchronous motors, a fuel cell and battery arrangement, an electromechanically actuated dumping mechanism, and a powerful microprocessor. The vehicle, as designed, is capable of transporting up to 200 cu ft of material over a one mile round trip per hour. The LMTV is capable of being operated {{from a variety of}} sources.

40|$|The {{design of}} a two wheel bulk <b>material</b> <b>transport</b> <b>vehicle</b> is {{described}} in detail. The design consists of a modified cylindrical bowl, two independently controlled direct drive motors, and two deformable wheels. The bowl has a carrying capacity of 2. 8 m (100 ft) and is constructed of aluminum. The low speed, high HP motors are directly connected to the wheels, thus yielding only two moving parts. The wheels, specifically designed for lunar applications, utilize the chevron tread pattern for optimum traction. The vehicle is maneuvered by varying the relative angular velocities of the wheels. The bulk <b>material</b> being <b>transported</b> is unloaded by utilizing the motors to oscillate the bowl {{back and forth to}} a height at which dumping is achieved. The analytical models were tested using a scaled prototype of the lunar transport vehicle. The experimental data correlated well with theoretical predictions.

Five soils of this region (two Alfisols, two Ultisols and one Mollisol) were sampled and morphological, sand grain size statistics, chemical and mineralogical analyses were used to search for evidences of deposition of <b>transported</b> <b>materials.</b> Two soils had abrupt textural change but no evidence of deposition of <b>transported</b> <b>materials,</b> two soils had less contrasting morphology and some characteristics that are possibly related to deposition, and one soil had no morphological discontinuity, but had deposition of material enriched in magnetite-maghemite in the sand fraction of the A horizon.

30|$|Despite {{their high}} efficiency, DSSCs based on liquid {{electrolyte}} have reliability issues {{caused by the}} liquid redox electrolyte. Device instability {{and the need for}} good device packaging have become major hurdles for commercial application of DSSCs [11]. Furthermore, liquid electrolyte based solar cells cannot be easily fabricated into multicell modules [12]. One way to address this manufacturing difficulty is to replace the liquid redox electrolyte by a solid-state hole <b>transport</b> <b>material,</b> typically a p-type conjugated polymer. Recently, many attempts have been made by using different hole <b>transport</b> <b>materials,</b> such as OMeTAD [13, 14], pentacene [15], poly(triphenyldiamine) [16], polythiophene [17], and poly(3 -hexylthiophene) (P 3 HT) [18], along with dye-loaded porous nanoparticle films.

Both λabs and λfl of the derivatives with 2 -thiophene and 2 - 1 H-pyrrole fragments show bathochromic shifts compared with parent compound 2 -pyridyl substituted derivative (1), while the corresponding values of the substituted derivatives with 4 -pyridyl, 2 -pyrazine, and phenyl fragments {{are similar to those of}} parent compound 1. Our results suggest that the substituted derivatives with 4 -pyridyl, 2 -pyrazine, phenyl, 2 -thiophene, and 2 - 1 H-pyrrole fragments are expected to be promising candidates for luminescent materials for OLEDs. Furthermore, the substituted derivatives with 4 -pyridyl, 2 -pyrazine, phenyl, and 2 -thiophene fragments can be used as promising electron <b>transport</b> <b>materials,</b> while the substituted derivatives with 2 -pyrazine and 2 - 1 H-pyrrole fragments can be used as promising hole <b>transport</b> <b>materials.</b> In addition, the substituted derivative with 2 -pyrazine fragment may be used as good candidate for ambipolar charge <b>transport</b> <b>material</b> for OLEDs...|$|R
40|$|A {{photoelectric}} {{conversion efficiency}} of 3. 8 % was achieved based on organic-inorganic hybrid perovskites CH 3 NH 3 PbBr 3 and CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 in 2009, and their efficiencies have leaped to 20. 1 % {{in the past}} five years, which are comparable to Cu(In,Ga) Se- 2 solar cells. The researchers mainly focused on appropriate materials and device structures, high-quality film depositions, careful interface designs and controllable carrier properties. Even so, it is still a long-term work to develop the low-priced, stable, environmental-friendly and highly-efficient perovskite solar cells, for example, the hole <b>transport</b> <b>material</b> spiro-OMeTAD is complicated and expensive, the electron <b>transport</b> <b>material</b> TiO 2 must be processed by high temperature annealing and the Au electrode is extensively used, all of which are not conducible to the commercialized application. On this occasion, new carbon materials, such as graphene oxide, carbon nanotubes, fullerene, graphdiyne, etc. have become another highlight of perovskite solar cells due to their excellent thermal, mechanical, electrical and optical performances. Carbon materials are low-cost and highly available industrial materials, which have been applied to highly efficient counter electrodes for dye-sensitized solar cell and quantum dot-sensitized solar cells. The approximate 5. 0 eV work function makes carbon material the ideal counter electrode material for perovskite solar cell. Carbon material is endowed with remarkably high charge mobility and electronic conductivity, which has been identified as one of the strongest <b>materials</b> for electron <b>transport</b> in perovskite solar cell. Similarly, a perovskite solar cell using hole <b>transport</b> <b>materials</b> incorporating carbon material shows an improved power conversion efficiency due to enhanced electrical conductivity and carrier mobility because the low electrical conductivity of hole <b>transport</b> <b>material</b> such as spiro-OMeTAD is considered to be an impediment to further enhancement of the power conversion efficiency and a hole <b>transport</b> <b>material</b> with higher conductivity should reduce the series resistance and increase the fill factor, thereby enhancing the power conversion efficiency of perovskite solar cell. In this paper, the research progress of new carbon materials for counter electrode, electron <b>transport</b> <b>materials,</b> hole <b>transport</b> <b>materials</b> in perovskite solar cells are summarized. The power efficiency of perovskite solar cell is enhanced greatly because of the introduction of new carbon materials, which provides a new idea for the further application of new carbon materials and device design of perovskite solar cells...|$|R

A combination of steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence, along with transient absorption spectroscopy revealed that only a small driving energy (∆E~ 0. 07 eV) is required to induce highly efficient hole transfer. The findings of this paper suggest that further improvements in the open-circuit voltage, and so the power conversion efficiency, of perovskite solar cells could be achieved by incorporating hole <b>transport</b> <b>materials</b> that provide an interfacial energy offset in the range 0 < ∆E < 0. 18 eV...|$|R
