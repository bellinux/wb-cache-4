This system comprises motors, belts, a cushion and a comforter to press and swing the user lying on the bed. Haptic Bed {{is a type of}} whole-body haptic interface, characterized by the presentation of low-frequency force with multiple degrees of freedom. The prototype system with two motors can present a weight sensation to approximately five regions of the abdomen. Although a sensation is only presented to the abdomen in this study, Haptic Bed can present a weight sensation to a wider area by increasing the number of motors. The system has the potential to enrich the audio visual experience in several ways, such as by expressing the sensation of a horrific ghost sitting on the user as part of entertainment content, or by presenting the existence of a remote relative as a <b>telecommunication</b> <b>tool.</b> Overall, the system changes a bed into a new medium through which immersive contents are presented in an immersive manner.

40|$|Humanoid robot avatars are a {{potential}} new <b>telecommunication</b> <b>tool,</b> whereby a user is remotely {{represented by a}} robot that replicates their arm, head, and possible face movements. They {{have been shown to}} have a number of benefits over more traditional media such as phones or video calls. However, using a teleoperated humanoid as a communication medium inherently changes the appearance of the operator, and appearance-based stereotypes are used in interpersonal judgments (whether consciously or unconsciously). One such judgment that {{plays a key role in}} how people interact is personality. Hence, we have been motivated to investigate if and how using a robot avatar alters the perceived personality of teleoperators. To do so, we carried out two studies where participants performed 3 communication tasks, solo in study one and dyadic in study two, and were recorded on video both with and without robot mediation. Judges recruited using online crowdsourcing services then made personality judgments of the participants in the video clips. We observed that judges were able to make internally consistent trait judgments in both communication conditions. However, judge agreement was affected by robot mediation, although which traits were affected was highly task dependent. Our most important finding was that in dyadic tasks personality trait perception was shifted to incorporate cues relating to the robot’s appearance when it was used to communicate. Our findings have important implications for telepresence robot design and personality expression in autonomous robots.

40|$|Background: Chronic pain, {{practically}} {{defined as}} persistent pain {{for more than}} three months, is experienced by 34. 9 % of the population in Hong Kong according to a local survey. Due to various limitations in the existing pain management and increasing service demand, under-treatment of chronic pain patients is well documented. Telemedicine is currently under active research has a cost-effective way to enhance service accessibility for chronic pain management and has been implemented in some western countries. The objectives of this study are to investigate the effectiveness of telemedicine to the management of chronic pain, compare it with conventional care and find out the implications for implementation through reviewing the latest literatures. Methods: Literature search through electronic database was conducted to locate randomized controlled trials (RCTs) which carried out from year 2004 to year 2014 and primarily investigated the effectiveness or efficacy of telemedicine on chronic pain of all kinds. Outcome measures including pain intensity, pain catastrophizing, self-efficacy, physical functioning and patient satisfaction are extracted for in-depth study. Findings: 10 RCTs were selected for this systematic review. All studies involved either internet or telephone as the <b>telecommunication</b> <b>tool</b> for treatment. All included studies showed beneficial effect of telemedicine to at least one condition commonly experienced by chronic pain patients. While consistent findings were found for the improvement of pain catastrophizing and self-efficacy, limited yet promising effect was found for pain intensity and physical functioning. From the studies using usual care control group, the potential superiority of telemedicine over the conventional care in chronic pain management was also revealed. Study participates were generally satisfied with telemedicine and found it as useful. Conclusions: This study presented promising results on the effectiveness of telemedicine to the management of chronic pain. It also revealed the potential superiority of telemedicine over conventional care in terms of treatment effect and patient’s experience. To further assess the application of telemedicine to chronic pain, analysis on cost and treatment methodology were suggested. published_or_final_versionPublic HealthMasterMaster of Public Healt...|$|R

40|$|The main {{premise of}} this article is that in {{information}} societies generally, and in virtual social contexts particularly, a distinctive style of interaction to facilitate the communication of difference, heterotopic communication, has emerged. It rests on two cultural foundations: an ideological belief in the positive, socially integrat-ing power of communication, and a prevailing ethic of instrumen-tal rationality,subjective individualism, and strategicallypracticed self-interest. The former is demonstrated by the use of simulation and spectacle as sources of information; exhibitionism/voyeurism as a communicative style; and the awareness of surveillance. The latter is seen in the competitive use of knowledge as a commodity; a surface globalismmasking deep parochialism; lateral as well as vertical information inequity; and the use of public versus private as strategies for engagement rather than as spaces. Those who en-gage in heterotopic communication resort to their ª own devicesº both in the sense of personal agendas, strategies, interests, and in-terpretations, and {{in the form of the}} <b>telecommunication</b> <b>tools</b> that help realize them.

40|$|SUMMARY: Over {{the past}} decades, {{construction}} firms {{have been using}} several off-the-shelf <b>telecommunication</b> <b>tools</b> and techniques to provide the communication means necessary to their mobile personnel on the jobsite. It is obvious that two-way radio transceivers such as walkie-talkie were the de facto standard adopted within the industry at first sight and for many years for very good reasons i. e. inexpensive, ease of installation, etc. Today’s rapid expansion and advancements in the telecommunications field are changing the way people communicate. Moreover, while legacy systems including wired, mobile and wireless technologies are offering {{a wider range of}} communications to the construction industry, this is not without constraints; such constraints could be of a technological and financial nature, limiting their availability to a particular class of users in certain circumstances. Furthermore, {{it is well known that}} the construction industry is information intensive and all teams involved in a given construction project are dispersed. The need to communicate with one another must be done in an effective, financially affordable and easy to use way that should satisfy the project requirements. An alternative to such traditional systems is the use of IP (Internet Protocol) Telephony communications instead. This new and emerging technology could offer to the construction industry as a whole, benefits and values that are absent in the traditional telecommunications systems.

Theoretical <b>tools</b> for the analysis and simulation of SAWs and SAW resonators are vital {{in the development of}} high-performance SAW devices. The carrying theoretical concept is the excitation of acoustic waves in periodic electrode arrays. The first part of the thesis is concerned with the characterization of periodic electrode arrays with rigorous simulations. In this work a structure simulator based on combined finite-element and boundary-element methods has been implemented, and it has been applied to analyze leaky surface-acoustic waves (LSAW) in rotated Y-cut LiNbO 3 and LiTaO 3 substrates, and surface transverse waves (STW) in langasite. The second part of the thesis consists of contributions to phenomenological modeling. Firstly, it is shown that the parameters used in the phenomenological coupling-of-modes theory, popular in device design, may be efficiently extracted from rigorous simulations of periodic electrode arrays using a novel phase-shift algorithm. Secondly, so-called Plessky's model for the STW dispersion in periodic structures is extended into a simulation model for finite, synchronous LSAW and STW resonators. The third part of the thesis concentrates on acoustic loss mechanisms in LSAW resonators on LiTaO 3 substrate. The electric losses due to various mechanisms are estimated and discussed. Most importantly, a recently observed acoustic leakage is identified as parasitic excitation of LSAWs to the busbars of the resonator. reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Two very {{different}} deep space exploration missions [...] Mars Exploration Rover and Cassini [...] have {{made use of}} distributed operations for their science teams. In the case of MER, the distributed operations capability was implemented only after the prime mission was completed, as the rovers continued to operate well in excess of their expected mission lifetimes; Cassini, designed for a mission of more than ten years, had planned for distributed operations from its inception. The rapid command turnaround timeline of MER, {{as well as many}} of the operations features implemented to support it, have proven to be conducive to distributed operations. These features include: a single science team leader during the tactical operations timeline, highly integrated science and engineering teams, processes and file structures designed to permit multiple team members to work in parallel to deliver sequencing products, web-based spacecraft status and planning reports for team-wide access, and near-elimination of paper products from the operations process. Additionally, MER has benefited from the initial co-location of its entire operations team, and from having a single Principal Investigator, while Cassini operations have had to reconcile multiple science teams distributed from before launch. Cassini has faced greater challenges in implementing effective distributed operations. Because extensive early planning is required to capture science opportunities on its tour and because sequence development takes significantly longer than sequence execution, multiple teams are contributing to multiple sequences concurrently. The complexity of integrating inputs from multiple teams is exacerbated by spacecraft operability issues and resource contention among the teams, each of which has their own Principal Investigator. Finally, much of the technology that MER has exploited to facilitate distributed operations was not available when the Cassini ground system was designed, although later adoption of web-based and <b>telecommunication</b> <b>tools</b> has been {{critical to the success of}} Cassini operations...|$|E
