40|$|Conjugative {{plasmids}} encode {{antibiotic resistance}} determinants or toxin {{genes in the}} anaerobic pathogen Clostridium perfringens. The paradigm conjugative plasmid in this bacterium is pCW 3, a 47 -kb tetracycline resistance plasmid that encodes the unique tcp <b>transfer</b> <b>locus.</b> The tcp locus consists of 11 genes, intP and tcpA-tcpJ, {{at least three of}} which, tcpA, tcpF, and tcpH, are essential for the conjugative transfer of pCW 3. In this study we examined protein-protein interactions involving TcpA, the putative coupling protein. Use of a bacterial two-hybrid system identified interactions between TcpA and TcpC, TcpG, and TcpH. This analysis also demonstrated TcpA, TcpC, and TcpG self-interactions, which were confirmed by chemical cross-linking studies. Examination of a series of deletion and site-directed derivatives of TcpA identified the domains and motifs required for these interactions. Based on these results, we have constructed a model for this unique conjugative transfer apparatus...|$|E
40|$|In Clostridium perfringens, toxins {{that cause}} histotoxic and {{gastrointestinal}} diseases {{have been identified}} on a family of large conjugative plasmids. The tcp <b>transfer</b> <b>locus</b> was initially identified on the prototype conjugative plasmid, pCW 3. This locus {{has been shown to}} mediate conjugative plasmid transfer and studies on several of the Tcp proteins have identified their role in plasmid transfer. In general less is known about the mechanism of conjugative transfer in Gram positive bacteria, nonetheless some functional similarity between the protein families in the C. perfringens conjugation system and other Gram positive systems have been identified. To contribute {{to our understanding of the}} mechanism of conjugative transfer in C. perfringens this thesis examined the functional role of TcpM (formerly called IntP), TcpD, TcpE and TcpJ, all of which are encoded on the tcp <b>transfer</b> <b>locus</b> of pCW 3 (Chapter 2 and 3), and identified components of the novel relaxosome of pCW 3 (Chapter 3). To determine the role of the hypothetical proteins, TcpD, TcpE and TcpJ, independent homologous recombinant mutants were constructed. Conjugative mating studies with the pCW 3 ∆tcpD and pCW 3 ∆tcpE mutants and their complemented derivatives showed that TcpD and TcpE were essential for pCW 3 transfer. The pCW 3 ∆tcpJ mutant transferred at levels similar to wild-type, which showed TcpJ was not required for conjugative transfer. To further analyse the role of TcpD and TcpE, functional HA-tagged derivatives were constructed and shown to complement the respective mutants. Cell fractionation, western blot and immunofluorescence studies showed that TcpD and TcpE were localized to the cell envelope, primarily at the poles of C. perfringens cells, independently of proteins encoded on pCW 3. These results provide evidence that the essential conjugation proteins, TcpD and TcpE, form part of the multi-protein transfer apparatus in C. perfringens donor cells. Although several components of the multi-protein transfer apparatus had been identified, nothing was known about the relaxosome complex that must be essential for C. perfringens plasmid transfer. Key components of this complex, the relaxase gene and the oriT site, had not been identified on pCW 3. The first gene on the tcp locus, tcpM, was hypothesised to be the pCW 3 relaxase due to its similarity to tyrosine recombinases, a family of DNA processing proteins. A tcpM insertion mutant was constructed and shown to have a significantly reduced level of plasmid transfer. Site-directed mutagenesis identified a tyrosine residue Y 259 as the only conserved tyrosine recombinase catalytic residue involved in the in vivo activity of TcpM. The residue Y 259 was also shown to be required for the ability of TcpM to relaxase plasmid DNA in an in vitro assay, which is consistent with the requirement for nucleophilic attack on the DNA substrate by a relaxase. A gene encoding a potential accessory protein, TcpK, of the pCW 3 relaxosome was identified outside the tcp locus. Mutagenesis and complementation studies showed that TcpK was required for wild-type pCW 3 transfer. Mobilization studies then were used to identify the pCW 3 oriT site. A 150 bp fragment located within the intergenic region between tcpK and tcpM increased mobilization of a shuttle vector. Gel mobility shift studies showed that TcpM bound to the oriT site. The addition of TcpK resulted in the formation of a supershift, providing evidence that TcpK could bind to the TcpM-oriT complex. In conclusion, this thesis has completed the genetic analysis the tcp <b>transfer</b> <b>locus</b> on pCW 3, identified a gene outside of the currently defined tcp locus as being involved in conjugative transfer and identified the DNA substrate, the pCW 3 oriT site. Overall these results have lead to the identification of the novel pCW 3 relaxosome. These findings have furthered our understanding of the mechanism of C. perfringens plasmid transfer and have contributed to the advancement of knowledge of Gram positive conjugation systems...|$|E

A replication locus (repA) and a conjugal <b>transfer</b> <b>locus</b> (traA-traC) were identified in pZL 12. Surprisingly, the supernatant of a 9 R- 2 liquid culture containing partially purified phage particles infected 9 R- 2 cured of pZL 12 (9 R- 2 X) to form plaques, and a phage particle (φZL 12) was observed by transmission electron microscopy. Major structural proteins (capsid, portal, and tail) of φZL 12 virions were encoded by pZL 12 genes. Like bacteriophage P 1, linear φZL 12 DNA contained ends from a largely random pZL 12 sequence. There was also a hot end sequence in linear φZL 12. φZL 12 virions efficiently infected only one host, 9 R- 2 X, but failed to infect and form plaques in 18 other Streptomyces strains. Some 9 R- 2 X spores rescued from lysis by infection of φZL 12 virions contained a circular pZL 12 plasmid, completing a cycle comprising autonomous plasmid pZL 12 and lytic phage φZL 12.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Susswein et al’s {{analysis}} of the existing discourse on internalization in psychology continues the dialogue within the socio-cultural field on the prioritization of person-centered (focusing on the “inside””outside ” separation) or communion-centered (emphasizing the core meanings of “participation”, “mastery”) tactics for theory construction. Taking the latter axiomatic stand, Susswein et al. decide not to build their account {{through the use of}} the internalization concept, persuading their readers to accept the notions of mastery and adaptation instead. In contrast, I start from the axiomatic perspective within which internalization is necessarily the central concept. My theoretical construction prioritizes subjective experiencing as culturally mediated through the personal construction of the self that coincides with re-construction of the cultural (semiotic) mediating devices. The multi-layer model of internalization/externalization guarantees the production of novelty and openness to innovation together with selective buffering of the intra-psychological affective and mental worlds through dialogical processes at the always ambiguous quadratic boundary of the unity of INSIDE/OUTSIDE and PAST/FUTURE functionally related opposites. Possible forms of dialogical processes at the <b>transfer</b> <b>loci</b> are discussed...|$|R

The three completely sequenced IncP- 9 plasmids, pWW 0, pDTG 1 and NAH 7, show extensive homology in replication, partitioning and <b>transfer</b> <b>loci</b> (an ~ 25 kb region) {{and to a lesser extent}} in the remaining backbone segments. We used PCR, DNA sequencing, hybridization and phylogenetic analyses to investigate the genetic diversity of 30 IncP- 9 plasmids as well as the possibility of recombination between plasmids belonging to this family. Phylogenetic analysis of rep and oriV sequences revealed nine plasmid subgroups with 7 – 35 % divergence between them. Only one phenotypic character was normally associated with each subgroup, except for the IncP- 9 b cluster, which included naphthalene- and toluene-degradation plasmids. The PCR and hybridization analysis using pWW 0 - and pDTG 1 -specific primers and probes targeting selected backbone loci showed that members of different IncP- 9 subgroups have considerable similarity in their overall organization, supporting the existence of a conserved ancestral IncP- 9 sequence. The results suggested that some IncP- 9 plasmids are the product of recombination between plasmids of different IncP- 9 subgroups but demonstrated clearly that insertion of degradative transposon...|$|R

Previous studies of the regulation of Escherichia coli biofilm formation suggested the involvement of an unknown adhesin. We now establish that the pgaABCD (formerly ycdSRQP) locus affects biofilm development by promoting abiotic surface binding and intercellular adhesion. All of the pga genes are required for optimal biofilm formation {{under a variety of}} growth conditions. A pga-dependent cell-bound polysaccharide was isolated and determined by nuclear magnetic resonance analyses to consist of unbranched β- 1, 6 -N-acetyl-d-glucosamine, a polymer previously unknown from the gram-negative bacteria but involved in adhesion by staphylococci. The pga genes are predicted to encode envelope proteins involved in synthesis, translocation, and possibly surface docking of this polysaccharide. As predicted, if poly-β- 1, 6 -GlcNAc (PGA) mediates cohesion, metaperiodate caused biofilm dispersal and the release of intact cells, whereas treatment with protease or other lytic enzymes had no effect. The pgaABCD operon exhibits features of a horizontally <b>transferred</b> <b>locus</b> and is present in a variety of eubacteria.

On transmissible plasmids, DNA transfer initiates within a cis-acting site, {{the origin of}} conjugal transfer, or oriT. We have localized an oriT on the A. tumefaciens plasmid pTiC 58 to a region containing the conjugal <b>transfer</b> <b>loci</b> traI and traII and acc, which is the locus encoding catabolism of the two conjugal opines, agrocinopines A and B. The smallest functional oriT clone, a 65 -bp BamHI-ApaI fragment in the recombinant plasmid pDCBA 60 - 11, mapped within the traII locus. The nucleotide sequence for a 665 -bp KpnI-EcoRI fragment with oriT activity was determined. DNA sequence alignments showed identities between the pTiC 58 oriT and the transfer origins of RSF 1010, pTF 1, and RK 2 /RP 4 and with the pTiC 58 T-region borders. The RSF 1010 -like sequence on pTiC 58 {{is located in the}} smallest active oriT clone of pTiC 58, while the sequence showing identities with the oriT regions of RK 2 /RP 4 and with T-region borders maps outside this region.

In contrast, other Ti plasmids and a conjugally active Agrobacterium opine catabolic plasmid, pAtK 84 b, efficiently mobilized pTiC 58 oriT clones.

By using mutator vibriophage VcA- 3 insertion to promote high-frequency <b>transfer,</b> the hly <b>locus</b> was mapped between arg and ilv on the V. cholerae RV 79 chromosome...|$|R
40|$|A {{vaccinia virus}} mutant deleted of ca. 18 {{kilobase}} pairs at the left-hand {{end of the}} genome is unable to multiply on many human cell lines. To determine whether all {{or some of the}} deleted sequences were responsible for the host range property, the corresponding region from wild-type DNA was cloned in three pieces into a vaccinia transplacement vector containing the thymidine kinase gene on the HindIII J fragment. The next step was to transfer these pieces to the genome of the host range deletion mutant by in vivo homologous recombination around the thymidine kinase <b>locus.</b> <b>Transfer</b> of one 5. 2 -kilobase-pair EcoRI fragment was found to restore a wild-type phenotype on the host range mutant, thus demonstrating that {{only a small portion of}} the 18 -kilobase-pair deletion contains the host range function(s). This result also illustrates that the method initially devised for inserting foreign genes into vaccinia virus DNA is useful for studies of the vaccinia genome...|$|R
40|$|A simple {{model of}} gene {{conversion}} presented earlier {{has been compared}} with a more general model under the assumption of no bias. The former {{is based on a}} simple concept that, by conversion, a gene (or a segment of a gene) is <b>transferred</b> from one <b>locus</b> to another in a multigene family. Intrachromatid symmetric conversion may result in reciprocal exchange of genes within a multigene family, and the previous theory of identity coefficients needs modification when it occurs. The relationship of various parameters of the two models was made clear in formulating the transition equations of identity coefficients. As an example of extending the analyses, a model of preferential conversion that is relevant to the observed uneven polymorphisms of class I genes in the major histocompatibility complex has been investigated. It differs from the biased conversion, in that directional process is through location of genes on the chromosome. It is shown that the model satisfactorily explains the observed data, even though the effect of preferential conversion is difficult to distinguish from that of natural selection...|$|R
40|$|Most current {{hardware}} {{engineering practice}} is {{deeply rooted in}} discrete-event modeling and synchronous design. Most current software engineering is deeply rooted in procedural abstractions. The latter says little about concurrency and temporal properties, whereas the former lacks many of modularity capabilities of modern programming languages. Actor-oriented design emphasizes concurrency and communication between components while maintaining modularity. Components called actors execute and communicate with other actors. In contrast to the interfaces in object-oriented design (methods, principally, which mediate <b>transfer</b> of the <b>locus</b> of control), interfaces in actor-oriented design (which we call ports) mediate communication. But the communication is not assumed to involve a transfer of control. This paper discuses the structure of actor-oriented models and shows how data and behavioral type systems enhance modularity and re-use potential while enabling designs that embrace concurrency and time. This paper shows how components can be designed for re-use through parameterization and behavioral polymorphism, and how component specialization can offset the performance costs of doing so. Actor-oriented design, behavioral types, behavioral polymorphism, component specialization, code generation, parameterization, Ptolemy. ...|$|R
40|$|The ardA gene of I 1 plasmid Collb-P 9 was {{previously}} shown to alleviate DNA restriction by type I enzymes {{and to promote}} conjugative transmission of the unmodified plasmid to a restricting host. To clarify the ecological role of sdA, its distribution was determined on plasmids from 23 incompatibility groups using hybridization to the coding sequence as an assay. Hybridizing sequences, shown by nucleotide sequencing {{to have at least}} 60 % identity with adA, were detected on plasmids belonging to the I complex (IncB, I 1 and K), the F complex (IncFV) and the lncN group. The adA homologues were found to specify an antirestriction phenotype which was enhanced by genetic derepression of the plasmid <b>transfer</b> system. adA <b>loci</b> map in plasmid leading regions but show no consistent association with a particular type of origin-oftransfer or a leading region gene of the ssb (single-stranded DNA-binding protein), psis (plasmid SOS inhibition) and hok (host killing) families. It may be significant that adA+ plasmids are authentic enterobacterial plasmids and that type I restriction systems are associated historically with members of the Enterobacteriaceae...|$|R
