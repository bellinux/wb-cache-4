Increase of the 6 -gingerol concentration in the extract did not improve the anti-inflammatory activity. The medicated plasters, containing 1 mg/cm 2 of the commercial DE or EDE, had good technological characteristics and exerted a significant antiphlogistic effect, too. By using the plaster containing EDE, the 6 - gingerol amount that permeated through human epidermis was 6. 9 μg/cm 2 while the amount that passed through mouse skin was 22. 1 μg/cm 2. Nevertheless, the amounts of 6 -gingerol permeated through human epidermis and mouse skin in the early period (8 h) were comparable (p > 0. 3). This preliminary result suggests that the anti-inflammatory effect observed in mice could also be exerted in humans...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To assess current {{practice}} patterns for dry eye patients in South Korea and {{to evaluate the}} preference according to the ages and clinic types of physicians. Methods: Dry eye patients (n = 1, 612) were enrolled in this multicenter cross-sectional, observational study. The severity level of dry eye patients was classified based on the Korean guidelines for dry eye treatment. The medical records of the enrolled dry eye patients were evaluated, and the practice styles and the preferences were analyzed according to the ages and clinic types of physicians. Results: Of all patients, dry eye level 1 was most common (47. 5 %), followed by level 2 (33. 5 %), level 3 (9. 1 %), and level 4 (1. 1 %). <b>Topical</b> <b>anti-inflammatory</b> agents were used in 70. 7 % of patients with dry eye level 2 and in 80. 6 % of patients at levels 3 and 4. <b>Topical</b> <b>anti-inflammatory</b> agents were also used in 48. 7 % of patients with dry eye level 1. Preservative-free artificial tears were preferred at all dry eye levels. The use of <b>topical</b> <b>anti-inflammatory</b> agents did not differ with investigator ages, but older physicians preferred preserved artificial tears more tha...|$|R

40|$|Since {{the great}} {{majority}} of patients possess immune response to herpes simplex virus (HSV), the influence of a <b>topical</b> <b>anti-inflammatory</b> corticosteroid (0. 1 % clobetasone butyrate) on ulcerative herpetic keratitis was studied in rabbits with a previous HSV skin infection (immunised) and compared with that in normal rabbits. Corticosteroid treatment had a much greater ulceration-exacerbating effect in immunised than in normal animals. On day 7 the mean area of ulceration in immunised rabbits were 3 times greater in treated eyes. 0. 01 % clobetasone butyrate treatment had less effect on immunised rabbits; 0. 001 % had no effect. It is concluded that the immunised rabbit provides a useful experimental model for studying the relationship between concentration of <b>topical</b> <b>anti-inflammatory</b> agents and enhancement of herpetic ulceration...|$|R
