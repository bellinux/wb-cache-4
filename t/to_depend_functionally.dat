One of the basic assumptions required to apply the Kalman smoothing frame-work is that error covariance matrices are known and given. In this paper, we study a general class of inference problems where covariance matrices can <b>depend</b> <b>functionally</b> on unknown parameters. In the Kalman framework, this allows modeling situations where covariance matrices may <b>depend</b> <b>functionally</b> on the state sequence being estimated. We present an extended formulation and generalized Gauss-Newton (GGN) algorithm for inference in this context. When applied to dynamic systems inference, we show the algorithm can be implemented to preserve the computational efficiency of the classic Kalman smoother.

Applying the variational principle, we derive pseudoeigenvalue equations for these two amplitudes, which cast the internal Schrödinger equation in a form akin to the Born-Oppenheimer separation of nuclear and electronic degrees of freedom in molecules. The marginal equation involves an effective radial Hamiltonian, which contains a nonadiabatic potential energy surface that takes into account all interparticle correlations in an averaged way, and whose unique eigenvalue is the internal energy. At each point (r_ 1,r_ 2), such surface is, in turn, the unique eigenvalue in the conditional equation. Employing the ground state of He as prototype, we show that the nonadiabatic potential energy surface affords a molecularlike interpretation {{of the structure of the}} atom, and aids in the analysis of energetic and spatial aspects of the Coulomb correlation, in particular correlation-induced symmetry breaking and quantum phase transition.

Our purpose here is to extend the model by linking the fluctuation of the generation time to the history of the colony. Such a linkage is natural, since, for example, when a colony grows large enough to severely tax its environment, the generation time lengthens accordingly. The resulting model consists of a pair of hyperbolic balance laws with a boundary condition of the form u(0, t) = 2 (1 − m′(t)) u(m(t),t), where m <b>depends</b> <b>functionally</b> on the solution u.

40|$|Fundamental {{aspects of}} fluid {{dynamics}} {{are related to}} construction of statistical models for incompressible Navier-Stokes fluids. The latter can be considered either deterministic or stochastic, respectively for regular or turbulent flows. In this work we claim that a possible statistical formulation of this type {{can be achieved by}} means of the 1 -point (local) velocity-space probability density function (PDF, f_ 1) to be determined in the framework of the so-called inverse kinetic theory (IKT). There are several important consequences of the theory. These include, in particular, the characterization of the initial PDF [for the statistical model f_ 1,Γ]. This is found to be generally non-Gaussian PDF, even in the case of flows which are regular at the initial time. Moreover, both for regular and turbulent flows, its time evolution is provided by a Liouville equation, while the corresponding Liouville operator is found <b>to</b> <b>depend</b> only on a finite number of velocity moments of the same PDF. Hence, its time evolution <b>depends</b> (<b>functionally)</b> solely on the same PDF. In addition, the statistical model here developed determines uniquely both the initial condition and the time evolution of f_ 1. As a basic implication, the theory allows the exact construction of the corresponding statistical equation for the stochastic-averaged PDFand the unique representation of the multi-point PDF's in solely in terms of the 1 -point PDF. As an example, the case of the reduced 2 -point PDF's, usually adopted for the statistical description of NS turbulence, is considered...|$|R
2500|$|Jets are {{normally}} regarded as abstract polynomials in the variable z, not as actual polynomial functions in that variable. In other words, z is an indeterminate variable allowing one to perform various algebraic operations among the jets. It {{is in fact}} the base-point [...] from which jets derive their functional dependency. Thus, by varying the base-point, a jet yields a polynomial of order at most k at every point. This marks an important conceptual distinction between jets and truncated Taylor series: ordinarily a Taylor series is regarded as <b>depending</b> <b>functionally</b> on its variable, rather than its base-point. Jets, on the other hand, separate the algebraic properties of Taylor series from their functional properties. We shall deal with the reasons and applications of this separation later in the article.|$|R

We present two members of this class, one of which results from the implementation of a method for obtaining action principles belonging to the class. For the case of a nonvanishing cosmological constant, we solve for the complex-valued 4 -form and get pure connection action principles. We perform the canonical analysis of the class. The analysis shows that only the Hamiltonian constraint is modified with respect to the Ashtekar formulation and that the members of the class have two physical degrees of freedom per space point.

40|$|The perturbative {{solutions}} to the semiclassical Einstein field equations describing spherically-symmetric and static lukewarm black hole are constructed. The source term is composed of the (classical) stress-energy tensor of the electromagnetic field and the renormalized stress-energy tensor of the quantized massive scalar field in a large mass limit. We used two different parametrizations. In the first parametrization we calculated the zeroth-order solution. Subsequently, making use of the quantum part of the total stress-energy tensor constructed in the classical background we calculated the corrections to the metric potentials and the corrections to the horizons. This procedure {{can be thought of}} as switching the quantized field on and analyzing its influence on the classical background via the back-reaction. In the second parametrization we are looking for a self-consistent lukewarm solution from the very beginning.

40|$|We {{present the}} TSW system (TestSystem Web), a web-based {{environment}} currently {{developed at the}} Rome 1 University, for the delivery of C programming exercises and their automatic correction. The core of the correction system automatically tests the student’s programs by applying unit-tests and/or by comparing the behaviour of the student’s code to a reference implementation. Care is taken to avoid error propagation from a function <b>to</b> other <b>functionally</b> <b>depending</b> procedures by redirecting the failing calls to the corresponding reference implementation. The system “instruments” the student’s code by using a code analyser and rewriter to handle instruction tracing and function calls redirection. The rewriter can be easily extended to develop other analysis instruments. As an example, we have developed: a code coverage tool that reports {{how much of the}} student’s code has been visited during the test, a cyclomatic complexity evaluator to compare the number of different logic paths in the code, a tracker for stack depth usage to check for proper implementation of recursive functions, a function/loop execution counter for the evaluation of the execution complexity. Additional care is taken to capture disruptive errors that would abort the program: “segmentation faults” caused by wrong pointer dereferentiation, and time-out caused by run-away processes. With these tools, the teacher can write rich unit tests that can either compare the behaviour of the function under analysis with a reference implementation (e. g. by generating random input and comparing the results), or by submitting well-crafted special inputs to elicit special cases or by comparing the complexity and/or stack depth counters. Each test applied will then explain to the student what was the problem found.

The practical solution used in many computer implementations of meta-GGA density functionalsfor ground-state calculations is abstracted and generalized to a class of density functionals that is broader than meta-GGAs and to any order of functional differentiation. Importantly, the TDDFT working equations for meta-GGA density functionals are presented here for the first time, together with the technical details of their computer implementation. The analysis presented here also uncovers the implicit assumptions in the practical solution to computing functional derivatives of meta-GGA density functionals. The connection between the approximation that is invoked in taking functional derivatives of density functionals, the non-uniqueness with respect to the KS orbitals, and the non-locality of the resultant potential is also discussed...|$|R
40|$|Dynamical systems often contain oscillatory {{forces or}} depend on {{periodic}} potentials. Time or space periodicity {{is reflected in}} the properties of these systems through a dependence on the parameters of their periodic terms. In this paper we provide a general theoretical framework for dealing with these kinds of systems, regardless of whether they are classical or quantum, stochastic or deterministic, dissipative or nondissipative, linear or nonlinear, etc. In particular, we are able to show that simple symmetry considerations determine, to a large extent, how their properties <b>depend</b> <b>functionally</b> on some of the parameters of the periodic terms. For the sake of illustration, we apply this formalism to find the functional dependence of the expectation value of the momentum of a Bose-Einstein condensate, described by the Gross-Pitaewskii equation, when it is exposed to a sawtooth potential whose amplitude is periodically modulated in time. We show that, by using this formalism, a small set of measurements is enough to obtain the functional form {{for a wide range of}} parameters. This can be very helpful when characterizing experimentally the response of systems for which performing measurements is costly or difficult. Comment: 5 pages, 1 figur...|$|R

Iwata (Econometrics 1974, 42, pp. 947 - 66) and Rogers (PhD Dissertation, GeorgeWashington University, 1983). We estimate the degree of market power of an oligopolistic industry, using a linear system and the 2 SLS estimation method. Our departure point is the work of Appelbaum (1982) where a 'market power index' is estimated for each of the sample's 25 years. As the market power index <b>depends</b> <b>functionally</b> on the conjectural elasticity, the goal is to obtain annual estimates for that elasticity. For this purpose, Appelbaum defines a non-linear simultaneous-equation system and obtains, with non-linear methods, the conjectural elasticity estimates for each year of the sample. Considering the conjectural elasticity's functional form that Appelbaum adopts, we use a different approach and obtain a linear system that is easier to estimate. Due to the particular features of the industry analysed, we also derive a much simpler form for the equations involved. The model's simplicity is appealing and its generalisation to other industries with homogeneous products may be implemented with ease. Oligopoly, Market Power, Conjectural Elasticity,...|$|R

Here, we identify a novel physiological link between Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2 and GJIC through modulation of Connexin- 43 (Cx 43) during acute and chronic inflammatory injury of the intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) barrier. Data from in vitro studies reveal that TLR 2 activation modulates Cx 43 synthesis and increases GJIC via Cx 43 during IEC injury. The ulcerative colitis-associated TLR 2 -R 753 Q mutant targets Cx 43 for increased proteasomal degradation, impairing TLR 2 -mediated GJIC during intestinal epithelial wounding. In vivo studies using mucosal RNA interference show that TLR 2 -mediated mucosal healing <b>depends</b> <b>functionally</b> on intestinal epithelial Cx 43 during acute inflammatory stress-induced damage. Mice deficient in TLR 2 exhibit IEC-specific alterations in Cx 43, whereas administration of a TLR 2 agonist protects GJIC by blocking accumulation of Cx 43 and its hyperphosphorylation at Ser 368 to prevent spontaneous chronic colitis in MDR 1 α-deficient mice. Finally, adding the TLR 2 agonist to three-dimensional intestinal mucosa-like cultures of human biopsies preserves intestinal epithelial Cx 43 integrity and polarization ex vivo. In conclusion, Cx 43 {{plays an important role}} in innate immune control of commensal-mediated intestinal epithelial wound repair...|$|R
