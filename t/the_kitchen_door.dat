5|$|Living in Bendigo and {{studying}} at Camp Hill Primary School, Leech could only travel {{three times a}} year to train with Froelich, so she relied heavily on dry land simulations, such as a pulley attached to <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>door.</b> When she was 12, she covered 110 yards in 1 minute (min) 7.1 seconds, setting an unofficial world record for her age group. This achievement prompted her parents to rent an apartment in Melbourne, so she could train with Froelich on a regular basis. Leech moved there with her mother, while her father stayed in Bendigo to look after the family's jewellery business.|$|E
5|$|Mr. Krabs tells SpongeBob and Squidward {{that it is}} {{a perfect}} {{opportunity}} for his business rival, Plankton to steal the Krabby Patty formula. Mr. Krabs has hired Patrick as a security guard so he does not have to pay for a real one, and SpongeBob spectacularly decorates the Krusty Krab. Patrick, Squidward, and Mr. Krabs follow SpongeBob into the freezer where he shows them a giant Krabby Patty ice sculpture that he made himself. However, in attempt to take the ice sculpture outside, they accidentally knock SpongeBob out the open freezer door; he then rebounds off <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>door</b> and back into the freezer. The impact shuts the door and it locks, trapping all four friends inside. Mr. Krabs remembers that {{there is a way to}} escape without using the door, which is through the ventilation system. While finding their way through the maze of air vents, they look back at some memorable moments in their lives.|$|E
500|$|The defence {{disputed the}} {{location}} of Sheila's body. The police said they found her upstairs with her mother. According to early police logs, PC Laurence Collins initially reported seeing through a window {{what he thought was}} the body of a woman near <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>door,</b> but he later radioed that it was in fact a man. A retired police officer who worked on the case said in 2011 that the first police logs were simply mistaken in reporting that a woman's body had been found downstairs.|$|E
60|$|His {{mother was}} not in <b>the</b> <b>kitchen.</b> <b>The</b> <b>door</b> stood open. He heard her outside talking to a {{neighbor}} woman, over the fence.|$|R
50|$|Emergency exit doors, and sidesteps {{leading down}} from <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>door's</b> {{southern}} landing, access the carpark in Pacey Street. Part {{of the slope}} at the hall's rear was excavated to provide building access and space. Several macadamised parking spaces abut its southern side, extending to a secondary side road.|$|R
60|$|There was {{a murmur}} of voices in <b>the</b> <b>kitchen.</b> <b>The</b> <b>door</b> was partly open and Jerry saw {{the girl and}} her little brother {{standing}} there, confronted by a burly man.|$|R

2500|$|Fernández was {{the very}} first {{successful}} Afro-Puerto Rican female singer, and as such, she broke color barriers and stereotypes. The Mingo band was contracted to perform at {{a benefit for the}} American Red Cross in the Condado Vanderbilt Hotel on August 4, 1945. The director of the orchestra told her that according to the hotel's rules, she had to enter through <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>door</b> like all other black musicians (a de facto integration rule, illegal at the time in Puerto Rico, but still in place at the time out of concern for American patrons of the hotel). Ruth however, did not follow the instructions and entered through the main entrance, driven by a chauffeur on a Packard automobile. She went on stage and performed before the astonished audience. When asked in a documentary years later how she felt about the incident, she replied: [...] "Me llamaron negra. ¿Negra? ¿Y qué?" [...] ("They called me a negro. Negro? So what?"). She was particularly proud about how well dressed she was that day, [...] "wearing more decorations than Douglas MacArthur". From that point on she proudly and constantly referred to herself (even in songs such as [...] "Soy la que soy") as [...] "La Negra de Ponce" [...] ("The Black Woman from Ponce)", making reference to her racial heritage [...] and her city of origin. She often also joked that she considered herself [...] "Insoportablemente Ponceña" [...] ("unbearably Ponceña").|$|E
60|$|Suddenly {{the house}} was full of the Invisible Man's resounding blows on <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>door.</b> The girl stared towards the kitchen, shuddered, and retreated into the dining-room. Kemp tried to explain in broken sentences. They heard <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>door</b> give.|$|E
5000|$|In his memoir, Kitchen Confidential, chef Anthony Bourdain {{wrote an}} entire chapter ("I Make My Bones") about his {{year and a}} half in <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> staff of <b>the</b> Rainbow Room, {{describing}} in detail - both good and bad - the working conditions in an extremely famous and busy restaurant and the numerous dealings normally kept invisible behind <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>doors.</b>|$|R
60|$|Soon {{the whole}} crowd was busy, breakfast, for the time, being forgotten. All went at the task with a will, {{and before long}} {{everything}} was straightened out but <b>the</b> <b>kitchen.</b> <b>Doors</b> and windows had been closed, a fresh fire had been lit, and then the roaring logs sent a grateful warmth through the entire bungalow.|$|R
60|$|Bessie {{looked through}} <b>the</b> open <b>kitchen</b> <b>door</b> at <b>the</b> lights and shadows that chased {{each other across}} the {{swelling}} bosom of the hill behind the house.|$|R

60|$|The captain, halting by <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>door,</b> said he {{was sorry}} to hear it.|$|E
60|$|Miss Panney turned quickly, {{and through}} the window she saw La Fleur {{approaching}} <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>door.</b>|$|E
5000|$|... b1 takes a purist {{approach}} to <b>the</b> <b>kitchen.</b> <b>The</b> <b>doors</b> and pull-outs {{can all be}} opened without handles.

50|$|The film {{ends with}} Kathir and Nisha hugging in <b>the</b> <b>kitchen.</b> <b>The</b> glass <b>door</b> shows Shruti and Shiva reflection, showing that their ghosts are still inside the house.|$|R
60|$|He {{turned at}} the sound of a light {{shuffling}} step in <b>the</b> <b>kitchen.</b> <b>The</b> <b>door</b> opened gently and the head of Mr. Truefitt was slowly inserted. Glimpses of a shirt and trousers, and the rumpled condition of the intruder’s hair, suggested that he had newly risen from bed.|$|R
60|$|So I sang as I {{walked to}} <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>door,</b> and sent Jonas {{to the barn}} for the bottle.|$|E

60|$|A {{few minutes}} later <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>door</b> opened softly, and my mother's hand, {{appearing}} through the jar, beckoned to me mysteriously.|$|E
6000|$|Kemp {{stood in}} the passage trying to think. In a moment the Invisible Man would be in <b>the</b> <b>kitchen.</b> This <b>door</b> would not keep him a moment, and then-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am going}} in," [...] {{declared}} Dick, and pushed open <b>the</b> old <b>kitchen</b> <b>door.</b> It was damp and mouldy in the apartment, for {{the rain had}} soaked loose much of the plaster and caused it to fall.|$|R
60|$|In the {{meantime}} I {{had gone out}} of the door by which we had entered, and soon discovered, {{on the other side of}} the house, a small building with a chimney to it, which I felt sure must be <b>the</b> <b>kitchen.</b> <b>The</b> <b>door</b> and shutters were fastened, but before making any attempt to open them I returned to announce my discovery.|$|R
60|$|Just before Cicely {{reached the}} back piazza, La Fleur {{came out of}} <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>door</b> with the {{telegram}} in her hand.|$|E
6000|$|We went forward, and {{unlatched}} <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>door.</b> The great-aunt {{was seated}} in her little, round-backed armchair, sipping her [...] "night-cap." ...|$|E
6000|$|... [The two {{children}} came in. They stand together {{a little way}} from the threshold of <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>door,</b> looking timidly at their father.] ...|$|E
6000|$|A {{gleam of}} red light {{spread across the}} passage from <b>the</b> half-open <b>kitchen</b> <b>door,</b> whence issued <b>the</b> savoury steam of the supper {{preparing}} for Monseigneur.

60|$|He put {{the tools}} away, took a great drink {{of the water}} that again flowed through the pipes, {{and sat down on}} the bench by <b>the</b> open <b>kitchen</b> <b>door.</b> Dede was inside, {{preparing}} supper, and the sound of her footsteps gave him a vast content.|$|R
50|$|The narrow {{layout of}} <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> was not due {{solely to the}} space {{constraints}} mentioned above, it was equally a conscious design decision in a Taylorist attempt to minimise the number of steps needed when working in <b>the</b> <b>kitchen.</b> <b>The</b> sliding <b>door</b> also helped minimise the walking distance between <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> and <b>the</b> table in the adjacent room.|$|R
60|$|The {{little girls}} were {{dragging}} a rough, dark object {{out of a}} corner of the passage into the light of <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>door.</b>|$|E

50|$|Next Door is {{an urban}} casual American Eatery from <b>The</b> <b>Kitchen.</b> Next <b>Door</b> was co-founded by Kimbal Musk and Hugo Matheson in 2011 in Boulder, Colo.

60|$|Directly Jack {{perceived}} that the Giant was fast asleep, he {{pushed open the}} door of the wardrobe and crept out; very softly he stole across the room, and, picking up the hen, made haste to quit the apartment. He knew the way to <b>the</b> <b>kitchen,</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> of which he found was left ajar; he opened it, shut and locked it after him, and flew back to the Beanstalk, which he descended as fast as his feet would move.|$|R
60|$|He {{mounted the}} stairs and came out into a wide kitchen. No one was present, nor did any fire burn in the big stove. From <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> a <b>door</b> led to a dining room, which, in turn, led to a sitting room. In the last-named room were the three men.|$|R
