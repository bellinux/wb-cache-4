The grabber operates differently from Half-Life 2s gravity gun, using only a single <b>trigger</b> <b>function.</b> Once the grabber is aimed at an appropriate object, it locks on, allowing the player to lift the object with the trigger. When the player releases the trigger, the object will be propelled forward with force, turning it into an impromptu weapon.

However, unlike the gravity gun in Half-Life 2, the grabber cannot hold objects {{for as long as the}} player wishes; if they wait too long to launch the object, the grabber will start to overload and disengage, dropping the object gently on the ground.

DESIGN AND SETTING: Bench study at a research laboratory in a university hospital. METHODS: Four turbine-based ventilators and nine conventional servo-valve compressed-gas ventilators were tested using a two-compartment lung model. Three levels of effort were simulated. Each ventilator was evaluated at four PSV levels (5, 10, 15, and 20 cm H 2 O), with and without positive end-expiratory pressure (5 cm H 2 O). <b>Trigger</b> <b>function</b> was assessed as the time from effort onset to detectable pressurization. Pressurization capacity was evaluated using the airway pressure-time product computed as the net area under the pressure-time curve over the first 0. 3 s after inspiratory effort onset. Expiratory resistance was evaluated by measuring trapped volume in controlled ventilation. RESULTS: Significant differences were found across the ventilators, {{with a range of}} triggering delays from 42 to 88 ms for all conditions averaged (P < 0. 001). Under difficult conditions, the triggering delay was longer than 100 ms and the pressurization was poor for five ventilators at PSV 5 and three at PSV 10, suggesting an inability to unload patient's effort. On average, turbine-based ventilators performed better than conventional ventilators, which showed no improvement compared to a bench comparison in 2000. CONCLUSION: Technical performance of <b>trigger</b> <b>function,</b> pressurization capacity, and expiratory resistance differs considerably across new-generation ICU ventilators. ICU ventilators seem to have reached a technical ceiling in recent years, and some ventilators still perform inadequately...|$|E
40|$|This paper proposes three {{different}} distributed event-triggered control algorithms to achieve leader-follower consensus for {{a network of}} Euler-Lagrange agents. We firstly propose two model-independent algorithms for a subclass of Euler-Lagrange agents without the vector of gravitational potential forces. By model-independent, we mean that each agent can execute its algorithm with {{no knowledge of the}} agent self-dynamics. A variable-gain algorithm is employed when the sensing graph is undirected; algorithm parameters are selected in a fully distributed manner with much greater flexibility compared to all previous work concerning event-triggered consensus problems. When the sensing graph is directed, a constant-gain algorithm is employed. The control gains must be centrally designed to exceed several lower bounding inequalities which require limited knowledge of bounds on the matrices describing the agent dynamics, bounds on network topology information and bounds on the initial conditions. When the Euler-Lagrange agents have dynamics which include the vector of gravitational potential forces, an adaptive algorithm is proposed which requires more information about the agent dynamics but can estimate uncertain agent parameters. For each algorithm, a <b>trigger</b> <b>function</b> is proposed to govern the event update times. At each event, the controller is updated, which ensures that the control input is piecewise constant and saves energy resources. We analyse each controllers and <b>trigger</b> <b>function</b> and exclude Zeno behaviour. Extensive simulations show 1) the advantages of our proposed <b>trigger</b> <b>function</b> as compared to those in existing literature, and 2) the effectiveness of our proposed controllers.

40|$|Recent {{research}} {{has suggested that}} the overall dependence of convection near coasts on large-scale atmospheric conditions is weaker than over the open ocean or inland areas. This {{is due to the fact}} that in coastal regions convection is often supported by meso-scale land-sea interactions and the topography of coastal areas. As these effects are not resolved and not included in standard cumulus parametrization schemes, coastal convection is among the most poorly simulated phenomena in global models. To outline a possible parametrization framework for coastal convection we develop an idealized modeling approach and test its ability to capture the main characteristics of coastal convection. The new approach first develops a decision algorithm, or <b>trigger</b> <b>function,</b> for the existence of coastal convection. The function is then applied in a stochastic cloud model to increase the occurrence probability of deep convection when land-sea interactions are diagnosed to be important. The results suggest that the combination of the <b>trigger</b> <b>function</b> with a stochastic model is able to capture the occurrence of deep convection in atmospheric conditions often found for coastal convection. When coastal effects are deemed to be present the spatial and temporal organization of clouds that has been documented form observations is well captured by the model. The presented modeling approach has therefore potential to improve the representation of clouds and convection in global numerical weather forecasting and climate models.

40|$|The {{sensitivity}} of quantitative precipitation forecasts to various modifications of the Kain-Fritsch (KF) convective parameterization scheme (CPS) is examined for twenty selected cases characterized by intense convective activity and widespread precipitation over Greece, during the warm period of 2005 – 2007. The study is conducted using the MM 5 {{model with a}} two nested domains strategy, with horizontal grid increments of 24 and 8 km, respectively. Five modifications to the KF CPS, each designed to test the {{sensitivity of}} the model to the convective scheme formulation, are discussed. The modifications include: (i) the maximization of the convective scheme precipitation efficiency, (ii) the change of the convective time step, (iii) the forcing of the convective scheme to produce more/less cloud material, (iv) changes to the <b>trigger</b> <b>function</b> and (v) the alteration of the vertical profile of updraft mass flux detrainment. The simulated precipitation from the 8 -km grid is verified against raingauge measurements. Although skill scores vary widely among the cases and the precipitation thresholds, model results using the modifications of the convective scheme show improvements in 6 -h precipitation totals compared to simulations generated using the unmodified convective scheme. In general, forcing the model to produce less cloud material improves the precipitation forecast for the moderate and high precipitation amounts, while the same modification and the change of the convective time step to 1 min has the same result for the high precipitation thresholds. The increase of convective time step to 15 min, the maximization of precipitation efficiency and the changes to the <b>trigger</b> <b>function</b> give similar results for medium and high precipitation.
