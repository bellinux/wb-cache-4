5|$|By the 1970s, {{the idea}} that the game had been created solely by Charles Darrow had become popular folklore; it was printed in the game's {{instructions}} for many years, in a 1974 book devoted to Monopoly, and was cited in a general book about toys even as recently as 2007. Even a guide <b>to</b> <b>family</b> games published for Reader's Digest in 2003 only gave credit to Darrow and Elizabeth Magie, erroneously stating that Magie's original game was created in the 19th century, and not acknowledging any of the game's development between Magie's creation of the game, and the eventual publication by Parker Brothers.|$|E
5|$|Central “substrate domain” {{containing}} multiple repeats of tyrosine residues {{embedded within}} specific conserved sequences (YxxP) (amino acids 69-350 for human EFS). This region contains 9 such binding sites, in contrast <b>to</b> <b>family</b> members BCAR1 and NEDD9 (20 and 18 motifs, respectively) and similar to CASS4 (estimated at 10 such motifs). Once phosphorylated by SRC or other kinases, these tyrosine motifs {{are bound by}} the SH2 domains of signaling proteins.

40|$|The {{state may}} provide {{financial}} assistance <b>to</b> <b>families</b> {{with dependent children}} either by reducing their tax burden or by increasing their welfare benefits. Both means of support increase their net wage, thus providing financial support. This paper {{provides an overview of}} financial support amounts provided <b>to</b> <b>families</b> with dependent children or families with the youngest child aged 1 to 3, and of measures limiting such support. The lower tax burden of families with children ensues from lower income tax, not from the social and health care security systems. Within this system, tax support provided <b>to</b> <b>families</b> with children is comparable to that provided <b>to</b> low-income <b>families</b> without children. Additional support provided <b>to</b> <b>families</b> with children includes tax benefits tied directly to children in the family, and tax credit for a dependent spouse. Should the tax system not provide such benefits, families with children, or rather families with a youngest child aged 1 to 3 would have a higher effective tax rate than childless families with comparable income...|$|R
5|$|Classifications {{published}} {{since the}} use of molecular phylogenetics have taken a narrower view of the Liliaceae (s.s.). In 1998, Tamura considered Calochortus sufficiently distinct to elevate the subfamily Calochortoideae <b>to</b> <b>family</b> status as Calochortaceae, resulting in the term Liliaceae sensu Tamura to indicate Liliaceae without the Calochortoideae. In 2009, Takhtajan used an even narrower definition (see Table 2 & Table 3 below).|$|E
5|$|Fleming bowed <b>to</b> <b>family</b> {{pressure}} in October 1933, {{and went into}} banking with a position at the financiers Cull & Co.

Early in 1939 Fleming began an affair with Ann O'Neill (née Charteris), who was married to the 3rd Baron O'Neill; she was also {{having an affair with}} Esmond Harmsworth, the heir to Lord Rothermere, owner of the Daily Mail.|$|E
5|$|Further {{measures}} included pouring {{boiling water}} over the grave or complete incineration of the body. In the Balkans, a vampire could also be killed by being shot or drowned, by repeating the funeral service, by sprinkling holy water on the body, or by exorcism. In Romania, garlic could {{be placed in the}} mouth, and as recently as the 19th century, the precaution of shooting a bullet through the coffin was taken. For resistant cases, the body was dismembered and the pieces burned, mixed with water, and administered <b>to</b> <b>family</b> members as a cure. In Saxon regions of Germany, a lemon was placed in the mouth of suspected vampires.|$|E

5|$|Goofus and Gallant {{was created}} by Garry Cleveland Myers and was first {{featured}} in the magazine Children's Activities in 1940. According <b>to</b> <b>family</b> legend, the grandchildren of Myers and his wife Caroline, Kent Brown and Garry Cleveland Myers III, inspired the characters Goofus and Gallant respectively. At first, the comic's characters were depicted as elves. In 1946, when the Myerses founded Highlights for Children, they brought Goofus and Gallant {{with them to the}} new magazine. By the 1950s, the strip's art style changed and Goofus and Gallant turned from elves to human boys. Throughout Goofus and Gallants history, numerous artists have drawn for the strip, including Marion Hull Hammel, who illustrated the strip for 32 years beginning in the early 1950s.|$|E

5|$|Human rights {{agreements}} require most {{governments to}} provide {{family planning and}} contraceptive information and services.
