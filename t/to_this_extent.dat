These steps were seen by some as inadequate, and her role was undermined by her poor relationship with the homosexual community.

He believed that grapes produce the best wine when they receive the maximum amount of sunshine. <b>To</b> <b>this</b> <b>extent,</b> he recommended that vines be trained in trees as high as possible and then be severely pruned of all leaves once the grapes began to ripen. He also advised winemakers to wait until the grapes are fully ripe before the harvest to ensure high quality in the wine and thus maintain the reputation of the wine estate.|$|E
25|$|Our {{authorities}} speak {{very little}} of his character. An inference may, however, be drawn {{on the basis of}} his performance. Ambitious, bold and rapacious, Churaman was cunning to an unusual degree. Certain traits of his character suggest that as a person he was complex. His movements after the murder of Husain Ali reflect his coolness and foresight, but the case of his suicide reveals his sense of devotion and gratitude. At the same time his conduct in the wars of succession generally testifies to his being unscrupulous and deceitful. Similarly, while his treatment and imperious disposition, the way he held back in face of extreme provocation from his eldest son, Muhkam Singh, speaks of his occasional resignation and self-restraint. Churaman displayed a passionate love for money and plunder throughout his life. Examples of occasional loot were not wanting among the Jats either before or after him. But no other Jat leader of his caliber had ever given himself to plunder <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>extent.</b>|$|E

25|$|Jean-Paul Akayesu {{became the}} first person convicted for using rape as form of genocide. Initially, gender based {{violence}} had not {{been included in the}} indictment against Akayesu; however, following pressure by non-governmental organizations (NGOs), the indictment was amended. During the trial of Akayesu, the ICTR affirmed that sexual violence, including rape, fell under paragraph B of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, as the rapes had been carried out with the sole intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a specific group. The ICTR also found that the sexual violence against Tutsi women was a systematic part of the genocide. <b>To</b> <b>this</b> <b>extent,</b> the finding against Akayesu, that rape can be an act of genocide, represented a major change in international jurisprudence and prosecutions of genocide. On 2 September 1998, Akayesu was sentenced to life imprisonment after being found guilty of genocide and crimes against humanity, including rape.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1320s, a Lithuanian army led by Gediminas {{defeated}} a Slavic army led by Stanislav of Kiev at the Battle on the Irpen' River, and conquered the city. The Tatars, who also claimed Kiev, retaliated in 1324–1325, so while Kiev was {{ruled by a}} Lithuanian prince, it had to pay {{a tribute to the}} Golden Horde. Finally, {{as a result of the}} Battle of Blue Waters in 1362, Kiev and surrounding areas were incorporated into the Grand Duchy of Lithuania by Algirdas, Grand Duke of Lithuania. In 1482, the Crimean Tatars sacked and burned much of Kiev. In 1569 (Union of Lublin), when the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth was established, the Lithuanian-controlled lands of the Kiev region, Podolia, Volhynia, and Podlachia, were transferred from the Grand Duchy of Lithuania to the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland, and Kiev became the capital of Kiev Voivodeship. In 1658 (Treaty of Hadiach), Kiev was supposed to become the capital of the Duchy of Rus' within the Polish–Lithuanian–Ruthenian Commonwealth, but the treaty was never ratified <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>extent.</b> Kept by the Russian troops since 1654 (Treaty of Pereyaslav), it became a part of the Tsardom of Russia from 1667 on (Truce of Andrusovo) and enjoyed a degree of autonomy. None of the Polish-Russian treaties concerning Kiev have ever been ratified. In the Russian Empire Kiev was a primary Christian centre, attracting pilgrims, and the cradle of many of the empire's most important religious figures, but until the 19th century the city's commercial importance remained marginal.|$|E

500|$|Following the {{partition}} of India {{and the creation of}} Pakistan the East and West wings were not only separated geographically, but also culturally. The authorities of the West viewed the Bengali Muslims in the East as [...] "too Bengali" [...] and their application of Islam as [...] "inferior and impure", and this made them unreliable. <b>To</b> <b>this</b> <b>extent</b> the West began a strategy to forcibly assimilate the Bengalis culturally. The Bengali-speaking people of East Pakistan were chiefly Muslim, but their numbers were interspersed with a significant Hindu minority. Very few spoke Urdu, which in 1948 had been declared the national language of Pakistan. To express their opposition, activists in East Pakistan founded the Bengali language movement in February 1952. [...] Earlier, in 1949, other activists had founded the Awami League {{as an alternative to the}} ruling Muslim League in West Pakistan. [...] In the next decade and half, Bengalis became gradually disenchanted with the balance of power in Pakistan, which was under military rule during much of this time; eventually some began to call for secession.

500|$|Daytime levels {{focus on}} Sonic's speed, and <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>extent,</b> sees the player control Sonic through {{fast-moving}} stages containing both 2D and 3D styles of gameplay. 2D sections {{are reminiscent of}} the Mega Drive/Genesis-era Sonic games, where the player controls Sonic in a side-scrolling fashion, while 3D sections see the camera placed behind Sonic, so the player may move in all directions. In addition to moves available in past games, such as the Homing Attack, new moves are also introduced. For instance, a new sidestep feature known as the Quick Step is available, allowing Sonic to dodge left and right, and a Drift feature, which allows Sonic to make tighter turns without slowing down. The game also features a gameplay mechanic previously used in the Sonic Rush series called the Sonic Boost, which greatly increases Sonic's speed, allowing him to smash through objects, destroy enemies instantly, or even access different level paths. In the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions, an on-screen [...] "Ring Energy" [...] meter displays how much boost is available. The amount of boost remaining may be increased by collecting more rings, and is decreased by using the Boost. In contrast, the PlayStation 2 and Wii versions of the game represent available Boost using bars, which may be added by performing [...] "Action Chains", destroying multiple enemies in quick succession {{through the use of}} homing attacks, or by collecting rings. Japanese game company Dimps helped design some of the stages.|$|E
500|$|In {{terms of}} technology, Hashimoto remarked that the visual style was {{born out of}} desire to see a global {{illumination}} solution used for the game's lighting — that is, light reflecting from one object in the scene onto others. <b>To</b> <b>this</b> <b>extent,</b> development on the renderer for this process began, and the final solution allowed the developers to use distributed rendering over hundreds of computers to calculate lighting for each ten- to twenty-kilometer action stage in around two or three days. Characters, enemies and objects are then lit at run-time with Sonic Team's [...] "Light Field" [...] technology to blend them in with the surrounding pre-calculated lighting. Because the game was being developed for two levels of hardware capability depending on the target platform, two development [...] "silos" [...] were set up to work on two separate builds of the game: one for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 version utilizing the Hedgehog Engine, and one for the PlayStation 2 and Wii version, which instead utilizes a modified version of an existing, internal Sega engine. Hashimoto, who had never directed a Sonic game before, incorporated new features such as a [...] "Quick Step" [...] mechanic allowing players to dodge obstacles with the L and R triggers. Hashimoto sought to combine the best qualities of 2D and 3D Sonic gameplay and address the criticisms directed at previous 3D entries in the franchise. Additional code to dynamically adjust the speed of the game for different situations was used to properly balance its fast pace with traditional platforming elements.|$|E
500|$|Several {{influential}} {{decisions of}} the House of Lords have determined the limited scope {{for the use of}} prerogative powers. In 1915, an appeal was made to the House of Lords, Re Petition of Right ("Shoreham Aerodrome Case"), but during the appeal the case was settled and the appeal withdrawn when the Crown agreed to pay compensation. The appeal was from a unanimous decision of the Court of Appeal that the Crown, both under the statutory Defence of the Realm Regulations and by the royal prerogative, was entitled to take and occupy, for military purposes in wartime, a commercial airfield on the south coast. The government argued that this action was to defend against an invasion; the courts held that for the prerogative to be exercised, the government must demonstrate that a threat of invasion exists. This was backed up by The Zamora (1916), where the Privy Council, on appeal from the Prize Court, held generally that to exercise a power not granted by statute (such as a prerogative power) the government must prove to the court that the exercise is justified. The next decision came in Attorney General v De Keyser's Royal Hotel Ltd (1920), where the House of Lords confirmed that a statutory provision in an area where prerogative powers are in use [...] "abridges the Royal Prerogative while it is in force <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>extent</b> – that the Crown can only do the particular thing under and in accordance with the statutory provisions, and that its prerogative power to do that thing is in abeyance".|$|E
