5|$|These {{decisions}} give {{support to}} a current mistaken {{view of the}} Constitution and the constitutional function of <b>this</b> <b>court.</b> This view, in short, is that every major social ill in this country can find its cure in some constitutional principle and that <b>this</b> <b>court</b> should {{take the lead in}} promoting reform when other branches of government fail to act. The Constitution is not a panacea for every blot upon the public welfare nor should <b>this</b> <b>court,</b> ordained as a judicial body, {{be thought of as a}} general haven of reform movements.|$|E
5|$|Although this {{question}} is brought up {{now for the first}} time to be decided by <b>this</b> <b>Court,</b> we consider it as having been long since settled in public opinion.

5|$|I {{realize that}} many good and able men have eloquently spoken and written, {{sometimes}} in rhapsodical strains, about {{the duty of}} <b>this</b> <b>Court</b> to keep the Constitution {{in tune with the}} times. The idea is that the Constitution must be changed from time to time, and that <b>this</b> <b>Court</b> is charged with a duty to make those changes. For myself, I must, with all deference, reject that philosophy. The Constitution makers knew the need for change, and provided for it. Amendments suggested by the people's elected representatives can be submitted to the people or their selected agents for ratification. That method of change was good for our Fathers, and, being somewhat old-fashioned, I must add it is good enough for me.|$|E

5|$|<b>This</b> <b>Court,</b> {{limited in}} {{function}} {{in accordance with}} that premise, does not serve its high purpose when it exceeds its authority, even to satisfy justified impatience with the slow workings of the political process. For when, {{in the name of}} constitutional interpretation, the Court adds something to the Constitution that was deliberately excluded from it, the Court, in reality, substitutes its view of what should be so for the amending process.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the regular}} courts handled {{political}} cases and even issued death sentences for these cases, {{a new type}} of court, the Volksgerichtshof (People's Court), was established in 1934 to deal with politically important matters. <b>This</b> <b>court</b> handed out over 5,000 death sentences until its dissolution in 1945. The death penalty could be issued for offences such as being a communist, printing seditious leaflets or even making jokes about Hitler or other top party officials. Nazi Germany employed three types of capital punishment: hanging, decapitation and death by shooting. The Gestapo was in charge of investigative policing to enforce National Socialist ideology as they located and confined political offenders, Jews and others deemed undesirable. Political offenders who were released from prison were often immediately re-arrested by the Gestapo and confined in a concentration camp.|$|E

5|$|In {{the case}} of Burford I {{was one of the}} members who {{constituted}} the court. I owe it to my own consistency to declare that the court were then apprized of my objections to the issuing of the writ of habeas corpus. I did not then comment at large on the reasons which influenced my opinion, and the cause was this: The gentleman who argued that cause confined himself strictly to those considerations which ought alone to influence the decisions of <b>this</b> <b>court.</b> No popular observations on the necessity of protecting the citizen from executive oppression, no animated address calculated to enlist the passions or prejudices of an audience in defence of his motion, imposed on me the necessity of vindicating my opinion.

5|$|The United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri {{is a trial}} level federal {{district}} court based in St. Louis, Missouri, with jurisdiction over fifty counties in {{the eastern half of}} Missouri. The court is one of ninety-four district-level courts which make up the first tier of the U.S. federal judicial system.

It is organized into three divisions, with court held in St. Louis, Hannibal, and Cape Girardeau.|$|E
5|$|The only {{objection}} is, {{not that}} the Court acted beyond its jurisdiction, but that it erred in its judgment of the law applicable to the case. If, then, we are to give any relief in this case, it is by a revision of {{the opinion of the}} Court, given {{in the course of a}} criminal trial, and thus asserting a right to control its proceedings, and take from them the conclusive effect which the law intended to give them. If this were an application for a habeas corpus, after judgment on an indictment for an offence within the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court, it could hardly be maintained, that <b>this</b> <b>court</b> could revise such a judgment, or the proceedings which led to it, or set it aside, and discharge the prisoner.|$|E
5|$|The rest of Kenilworth Castle's {{interior}} {{is divided into}} three areas: the base court, stretching between Mortimer's Tower and Leicester's gatehouse; the left-hand court, stretching south-west around the outside of the inner court; and the right-hand court, to the north-west of the inner court. The line of trees that cuts across the base court today is a relatively modern mid-19th century addition, and originally <b>this</b> <b>court</b> would have been more open, save for the collegiate chapel that once {{stood in front of the}} stables. Destroyed in 1524, only the chapel's foundations remain. Each of the courts was designed to be used for different purposes: the base court was considered a relatively public area, with the left and right courts used for more private occasions.|$|E

5|$|By the 18th century, Mersea Fort was in ruins. The fishery {{rules were}} {{reinforced}} by fresh legislation in 1758, which created {{a court of}} conservancy to oversea the oyster stocks. Officially, <b>this</b> <b>court</b> was supposed {{to sit at the}} fort, but rather than using the now dilapidated earthworks, it began to meet in Colchester's Moot Hall. Instead, a ceremony began to take place each year at the Mersea Stone, near to the fort, involving local dignitaries and extensive eating and drinking. The fort was recommissioned during the Napoleonic Wars {{at the start of the}} 19th century, and a new gun battery was constructed overlooking the sea, equipped with six 24-pounder (10.9kg) guns. After this the fort was abandoned once again. A sea wall was built along the coast early in the century, cutting through the south-east side of the fort. The legislation on oysters was reformed by Parliament in 1870, which disbanded the previous court structure and severed the historic link with Mersea Fort. A defensive pill-box was constructed at the castle during the Second World War.|$|E
5|$|Early in 1162 Chesney {{was summoned}} to Normandy by the king, along with Roger, the Archbishop of York, Hugh de Puiset, the Bishop of Durham, and Hilary of Chichester, in order to lend their support to the {{election}} of Thomas Becket to the see of Canterbury. In July 1163, Chesney {{was present at the}} royal court held at Woodstock Palace, which included the Welsh prince Rhys ap Gruffydd, the prince of Northern Wales Owain Gwynedd, and King Malcolm IV of Scotland. The two Welsh princes and the Scots' king did homage to Henry II while at <b>this</b> <b>court.</b> In 1163 Chesney was excused from attending a papal council at Tours because of his health, but he attended the royal councils of Clarendon and Northampton in 1164, which dealt with the growing dispute, now known as the Becket controversy, between the king and Becket. At those councils Chesney attempted to persuade Becket to compromise, but was unsuccessful. The king subsequently sent Chesney to northern England as an itinerant justice in 1166.|$|E
5|$|The Fountain Court lies to {{the west}} of the Pitched Stone Court, and is named after a marble {{fountain}} that once stood in the centre of it, featuring a white horse on a black marble base, complete with a flow of running water. The fountain was probably installed somewhat after the initial construction of the court in the 1460s, dating instead to Edward Somerset in the late 16th century; the horse symbolised Edward's prestigious role as Master of the Horse. The Fountain Court was built to provide luxurious accommodation for the family and guests – by the 15th century, it was important to be able to provide private chambers for visitors, and <b>this</b> <b>court</b> could hold up to four distinct groups of visitors in comfort. The Fountain Court as a whole is marked by what Augustus Pugin described as extremely fine, elegant and delicate stonework.|$|E
