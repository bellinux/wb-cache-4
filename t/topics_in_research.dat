50|$|The Nurtured Heart Approach (NHA) is {{a social}} {{emotional}} strategy that instills greatness and transforms negative behaviors into positive behaviors, increases interrelatedness and connectivity among family members, couples, teachers and students and builds “Inner Wealth” more commonly known as character strengths and virtues. The NHA was created and developed by Howard Glasser who was discouraged {{by the lack of}} positive results when applying the techniques he had learned in graduate school. Glasser intuitively created this approach by specifically attending to the energy in relationships noticing that more energy and attention went to negative behavior rather than to positive behavior. Howard Glasser continues to expound on his findings for the last two decades resulting in the first Global Summit with <b>topics</b> <b>in</b> <b>research,</b> policy, foster care, mental health organizations, workplace, education, diverse cultures and religious affiliation and with specific psychiatric disorders. The Nurtured Heart Approach to parenting (NHA; Glasser & Easley, 2008) is summarized and evaluated in terms of its alignment with current theoretical perspectives and empirical evidence in family studies and developmental science. Originally conceived and promoted as a behavior management approach for parents of difficult children (i.e., with behavior disorders), NHA is increasingly offered as a valuable strategy for parents of any children, despite a lack of published empirical support. Parents using NHA are trained to minimize attention to undesired behaviors, provide positive attention and praise for compliance with rules, help children be successful by scaffolding and shaping desired behavior, and establish a set of clear rules and consequences. Many elements of the approach have strong support in the theoretical and empirical literature; however, some of the assumptions are more questionable, such as that negative child behavior can always be attributed to unintentional positive reinforcement by parents responding with negative attention. On balance, NHA appears to promote effective and validated parenting practices, but its effectiveness now needs to be tested empirically (Hektner, J, Brennan, A, & Brotherson, S., 2013).|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Medical Image {{processing}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} challenging <b>topics</b> <b>in</b> <b>research</b> field. In medical field, CT (Computed Tomography) scan imaging and MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) are the most important for image based visual diagnostics, but applying segmentation to these images is very tedious and requires an adjusting approach. The main objective of medical image segmentation is to extract and characterize anatomical structures with respect to some input features or expert knowledge. In this paper we have formulated a simple, general, fast, and user-friendly approach to the problem of medical image segmentation based on texture filter. In this method, the experimental results show that the segmentation results are visually satisfactory of medical image texture segmentation...|$|E
