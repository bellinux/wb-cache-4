40|$|The {{immediate}} haemodynamic {{effects of}} peruvoside, a cardiac glycoside {{obtained from the}} Indian plant <b>Thevetia</b> <b>neriifolia</b> <b>Juss,</b> were studied in six patients with congestive heart failure. The drug {{was found to have}} an immediate and powerful positive inotropic and negative chronotropic effect, like ouabain, on the failing human heart. Oral peruvoside was also effective in the treatment of congestive heart failure when used on a short-term as well as a long-term basis. It therefore seems that peruvoside is a useful cardiac glycoside in the management of congestive heart failure in man as a quick-acting intravenous preparation.

40|$|Abstract: The {{leaves of}} <b>Thevetia</b> <b>neriifolia</b> <b>Juss.,</b> an {{important}} medicinal plant {{was subjected to}} phytochemical screening, pharmacognosy and antimicrobial investigations. Preliminary phytochemical screening of leaves extracts revealed {{the presence of the}} bioactive compounds, such as alkaloids, anthroquinones, flavonoids, phenolic compounds, saponins, steroids and tannins in the leaves. Pharmacognostical studies such as extractive values and fluorescence analysis brought out the standardized data in the quality control of this drug. Hexane, chloroform, ethanol and aqueous extracts of leaves showed significant antimicrobial activity against the tested human pathogens. Hexane and ethanol extracts exhibited maximum activity against the tested human pathogens, while aqueous extracts showed minimum activity against fungal pathogens only. The bioactive compounds responsible for these antimicrobial activities could be isolated and identified to develop a new drug of pharmaceutical interest.

Emulsified oil can easily mix with water and also revealed the same insecticidal activity as {{essential oil}} of plants that could be used in store as well as in the field as an alternative synthetic insecticide. Objectives: The objective of this study is to investigate the efficacy of emulsified petroleum ether extract of Acorus calamus L. rhizome alone and three other combination of plant materials against three stored product pests, viz. Callosobruchus chinensis L., Sitophilus oryzae (L.) and Tribolium castaneum (Herbst) in adult phase in laboratories condition. Materials and method – Petroleum ether extract of different plant parts were emulsified. The emulsified products were A. calamus rhizome alone, A. calamus + Corchorus capsularis L. seed, A. calamus + <b>Thevetia</b> <b>neriifolia</b> <b>Juss.</b> seed and A. calamus + Zingiber cassumunar Roxb. rhizome. The residual film technique method was conducted to determine the LC 50 value of above mentioned plant extract against three stored product pests. Results: Noticeable mortality was noted for all species after 24 and 48 hours of the treatment with the emulsified products, although highest mortality of C. chinensis was observed with A. calamus alone afte...|$|E

The plant bears brown or black nuts, the toxic property {{of which was}} a!-ready known to European scientists, such as Pison and Clusius (2), {{in the second half}} of the sixteenth century. Clusius (1574) described how the native Indians wore the shells of the nuts around their neck, waist, or legs, and used them as ornaments and rattles during dances. In the nineteenth century, additional information became available (3). Guibourt definitely stated that the kernels of the nuts are fatally poisonous, and Madianne (1827) observed that an emulsion of one kernel caused the death of a dog in twenty-five minutes. Decourtilz, as quoted by Huse-mann (4), mentioned a case of poisoning in a young negro. Simi-larly, Balfour and Maclagen (1857) reported two additional cases of intoxification, with ultimate recovery, resulting from eating the nut. Dumontier (1856), cited by DeVry (5), also published an account of the poisoning of a mulatto child, three years of age, who died from eating a seed of Thevetia neriifolia.

Here, evidence obtained in Western Burkina Faso indicated that the distribution of An. gambiae s. s.

Among field-collected anophelines, a higher proportion of specimens containing fructose were found on flowering Mangifera indica (Anacardiaceae), Dolonix regia (Fabaceae), <b>Thevetia</b> <b>neriifolia</b> (Apocynaceae), Senna siamea, and Cassia sieberiana (both Fabaceae) compared to that recorded on other nearby plants, suggesting that some plants are favored for use as a sugar source over others. Y-tube olfactometer assays with newly-emerged An. gambiae s. s. exposed to odors from individual plants and some combinations thereof showed that males use odor cues to guide their preference. The number of sugar-positive males was variable in a no-choice cage assay, consistent with the olfactory response patterns towards corresponding odor stimuli.

40|$|The {{ecological}} {{context in}} which mosquitoes and malaria parasites interact has received little attention, compared to the genetic and molecular aspects of malaria transmission. Plant nectar and fruits are important for the nutritional ecology of malaria vectors, but how the natural diversity of plant-derived sugar sources affects mosquito competence for malaria parasites is unclear. To test this, we infected Anopheles coluzzi, an important African malaria vector, with sympatric field isolates of Plasmodium falciparum, using direct membrane feeding assays. Through a series of experiments, we then {{examined the effects of}} sugar meals from <b>Thevetia</b> <b>neriifolia</b> and Barleria lupilina cuttings that included flowers, and fruit from Lannea microcarpa and Mangifera indica on parasite and mosquito traits that are key for determining the intensity of malaria transmission. We found that the source of plant sugar meal differentially affected infection prevalence and intensity, the development duration of the parasites, as well as the survival and fecundity of the vector. These effects are likely the result of complex interactions between toxic secondary metabolites and the nutritional quality of the plant sugar source, as well as of host resource availability and parasite growth. Using an epidemiological model, we show that plant sugar source can be a significant driver of malaria transmission dynamics, with some plant species exhibiting either transmission-reducing or -enhancing activities...|$|R

The samples were then either sun-dried for 3 days or toasted after soaking and thereafter analyzed for chemical and residual glycoside composition. There were significant (P R) to 11. 04 % in T 4 (TS soaked in fine-grade ethanol and sun-dried). Obtained values for {{nitrogen free extracts}} was between 12. 56 % in T 1 (TS soaked in water and toasted) and 28. 31 % in T 4.

40|$|Helicoverpa armigera HÜbner {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} agricultural crop pests in the world causing heavy crop yield losses. The continued and indiscriminate use of synthetic insecticides in agriculture for their control has received wide public apprehension because of multifarious problems, including insecticide resistance, resurgence of pest species, environmental pollution, and toxic hazards to humans and nontarget organisms. These problems have necessitated the need to explore and develop alternative strategies using eco-friendly and biodegradable plant products. In view of this, the efficacy of <b>Thevetia</b> <b>neriifolia</b> methanol stem extract was evaluated against the early fourth instars of H. armigera as an antifeedant and stomach poison agent. Feeding of larvae with the diet containing 0. 005 %– 5. 0 % extract resulted in 2. 06 %– 37. 35 % antifeedant index; the diet with 5. 0 % extract caused 54. 3 % reduced consumption. The negative impact of extract on larval feeding resulted in 37. 5 %– 77. 7 % starvation, causing adverse effects on the larval weight. Choice between control and experimental diet resulted in feeding preference of larvae for the control diet, leading to 7. 3 %– 42. 9 % reduced consumption of extract-containing diet. The only exception was the diet with 0. 005 % extract, which could not cause any deterrence. The midgut histological architecture of H. armigera larvae fed with 0. 005 %– 0. 05 % extract-containing diet with negligible antifeedant potential showed significant damage, shrinkage, and distortion and vacuolization of gut tissues and peritrophic membrane, causing the disintegration of epithelial, goblet, and regenerative cells; the damage increased with the increase in concentration. These changes in the gut caused negative impact on the digestion and absorption of food and thus nutritional deficiency in the larvae, which could probably affect their growth and development. This study reveal the appreciable stomach poison potential of T. neriifolia stem methanol extract against H. armigera larvae, which can be explored as an eco-friendly pest control strategy...|$|R
