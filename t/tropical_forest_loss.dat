40|$|Tropical rainforests harbor a {{significant}} portion of the world's remaining biodiversity. Having undergone rapid changes in forest cover over the last two decades, a large amount of irreplaceable biodiversity has been lost. The establishment of protected areas has been a key strategy to hinder the loss of tropical forests and biodiversity. However, the effectiveness of designating protected areas has been called into question, particularly in regions such as tropical Africa where widespread conditions of poverty, rapid population growth and political instability are evident. Quantitative measurements of park effectiveness for forest conservation are urgently needed, however accurate inferences concerning park effectiveness across broad regions is difficult. Whilst remote sensing techniques have been proposed as a practical solution, the intensity of data processing has made it untenable until recently. Here, I use remote-sensing methods to analyze high-resolution satellite imagery of <b>tropical</b> <b>forest</b> <b>loss</b> (as a proxy for tropical deforestation) within and outside 224 parks across 23 countries in Africa. I compare the extent of <b>tropical</b> <b>forest</b> <b>loss</b> inside parks to outside of them to show that the majority of African parks in the Subtropical and Tropical Moist Broadleaf forest biome are effective in curbing forest loss within park boundaries. However, certain parks were more effective in forest conservation than others. Whilst smaller parks were less effective at preventing forest loss inside park boundaries than larger parks, older parks were less effective than younger parks. Furthermore, parks of varying IUCN management categories exhibited negligible differences in forest loss between one another. Lastly, significant geographical variations in park effectiveness existed: West African parks exhibited the most forest loss within park boundaries and Central African parks exhibited the least. My results demonstrate the complexity of factors which influence a park's ability to curb forest loss within its boundaries. Furthermore, this study is the first bioregional-wide assessment of park effectiveness using remote sensing. These results supplement scarce literature on tropical deforestation in Africa and demonstrate the potential of using remote satellite imagery for measuring the relative impact of park establishment on forest conservation in this region...|$|E

In particular, the study found that deforestation resulting from agriculture and industrial expansion - driven in part by population growth - was not as a big a problem as the forest loss resulting from the inadequate or non-active management of land.

40|$|AbstractOne of {{the main}} causes of <b>tropical</b> <b>forest</b> <b>loss</b> is {{conversion}} to agriculture, which is constantly increasing as a dominant land cover in the tropics. The loss of forests greatly affects biodiversity and ecosystem services. This paper assesses the economic return from increasing tree cover in agricultural landscapes in two tropical locations, West Java, Indonesia and eastern Bangladesh. Agroforestry systems are compared with subsistence seasonal food-crop-based agricultural systems. Data were collected through rapid rural appraisal, field observation, focus groups and semi-structured interviews of farm households. The inclusion of agroforestry tree crops in seasonal agriculture improved the systems’ overall economic performance (net present value), even when it reduced understorey crop production. However, seasonal agriculture has higher income per unit of land area used for crop cultivation compared with the tree establishment and development phase of agroforestry farms. Thus, there is a trade-off between short-term loss of agricultural income and longer-term economic gain from planting trees in farmland. For resource-poor farmers to implement this change, institutional support is needed to improve their knowledge and skills with this unfamiliar form of land management, sufficient capital for the initial investment, {{and an increase in}} the security of land tenure...|$|E

Restoring sustainable ecological processes like pollination is a more feasible goal. We investigated how flower cover, planting design, and landscape forest cover influenced bird pollinator visits to Inga edulis trees in young restoration sites in Costa Rica. I. edulis trees were located in island plantings, where seedlings had been planted in patches, or in plantation plantings, where seedlings were planted to cover the restoration area. Sites were located in landscapes with scant (10 – 21 %) or moderate (35 – 76 %) forest cover. Trees with greater flower cover received more visits from pollinating birds; neither planting design nor landscape forest cover influenced the number of pollinator visits. Resident hummingbirds and a migratory bird species were the most frequent bird pollinators. Pollination {{in the early years}} following planting may not be as affected by details of restoration design as other ecological processes like seed dispersal. Future work to assess the quality of various pollinator species will be important in assessing this idea...|$|E

40|$|Worldwide {{concern for}} {{continuing}} <b>loss</b> of montane <b>forest</b> {{cover in the}} tropics usually focuses on adverse ecological consequences. Less recognized, but equally important to inhabitants of these affected regions, is an increasing susceptibility to rainfall-induced debris flows and their associated impacts. The same high rainfall rates that sustain <b>tropical</b> <b>forest</b> cover can often serve as the triggering mechanism for debris flows. The natural rate of debris flow occurrence on steep slopes subject to episodic, intense rainfall {{is dependent on the}} stabilizing effect of <b>tropical</b> <b>forests.</b> Either <b>loss</b> or significant reduction in forest cover can weaken this natural defense. Information from postdisaster observations and research on the November 1988 storm event in southern Thailand provides a case study illustrating the potential impacts of increased debris flow susceptibility resulting from conversion of forest cover to rubber tree crops. Development resulting in the <b>loss</b> of <b>tropical</b> <b>forest</b> cover may be accompanied by local increase in population, property development, and infrastructure. Consequently, the potentially disastrous consequences of increased debris flow occurrence are amplified by the greater vulnerability of local populations. Preserving the <b>tropical</b> <b>forest</b> cover is an obvious and often difficult means of retaining this natural protection. Effective policy should capitalize on the values of <b>tropical</b> <b>forests</b> as part of the strategy for retaining adequate forest cover. Policy should also seek to avoid creating pressures that foster forest removal or their conversion to other types of land cover in steep terrain. Areas where <b>tropical</b> <b>forests</b> were converted to other cover types can be restored to secondary forests to avoid a permanent state of increased debris flow susceptibility. Restoration of secondary <b>tropical</b> <b>forests</b> can successfully re-establish the forest characteristics that limit debris flow occurrence. Experience in Central America and the Caribbean demonstrates that successful restoration is possible but requires a significant commitment of both time and resources. In addition to the cost and technical difficulties involved, the increased susceptibility to debris flow occurrence persists through many years until successful restoration is achieved. Both retention of existing <b>tropical</b> <b>forests</b> and restoration of <b>forest</b> cover where <b>loss</b> has occurred are often justified by the reduced risk of debris flow impacts to vulnerable populations and infrastructure. © 2012 Springer-Verlag (outside the USA) ...|$|R
40|$|<b>Tropical</b> dry <b>forests</b> {{experience}} the highest deforestation rates on Earth, with major {{implications for the}} biodiversity of these ecosystems, {{as well as for}} its human occupants. Global remote sensing based forest cover data (2000 − 2012) point to the rapid <b>loss</b> of <b>tropical</b> dry <b>forest</b> in South America and Africa, also, if not foremost, inside formally protected areas. Here, we significantly extend the baseline of <b>tropical</b> dry <b>forest</b> <b>loss</b> inside a protected area in Ghana using a generalizable change detection technique. The forest cover change detection is based on the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) derived from historical Landsat data (1984 – 2015). Field measurements were carried out in dry semi-deciduous forest and in the adjacent savanna and woodland. Estimates of the canopy area index and above ground woody biomass were related to NDVI derived from Landsat 8 data. The change detection indicated significant NDVI decrease in a large area initially covered by <b>tropical</b> dry <b>forest,</b> associated with deforestation. The peak in deforestation was found to have occurred between 1990 and 2002, hereafter, the conservation status of the area was improved. A combination of remote sensing data corroborated by secondary data sources provides evidence for the almost complete clearance of a <b>tropical</b> dry <b>forest</b> inside a strictly protected area, attributable to logging and land clearing for arable farming. The NDVI change detection also revealed NDVI increase in the adjacent woodlands from 2002 to 2015, demonstrating woody encroachment. Historical fire data from the MODIS burned area product indicate that the deforested area experienced a high frequency of anthropogenic burning since 2004, which may have caused further degradation and largely prevents forest regeneration.

LANDSAT multispectral scanner (MSS) imagery from 1973 and 1988 were used to estimate net forest removal (29 % of forest area), regrowth (7 % of forest area, including possible artifactual errors), and forest edges in Mabira Forest in southeastern Uganda during the 15 -year period. Of the forest remaining, the percentage that was heavily disturbed increased from 18 % to 42 %. This change in forest density was observable with the MSS imagery. The total forest edge-to-area ratio (including edges interior to the forest boundary) increased by 29 % over the period. Although four distinct types of closed tropical forest, based on structure or dominance, could be recognizedonthe ground, the types could not be distinguished by differences in spectral reflectance in the four MSS bands. Closed tropical forest could be readily distinguished from exotic conifer plantations, banana plantations, and other non-forest vegetation types.

In this study, we focused on the role of the owner’s cultural background as migrants (from the island of Java) or non-migrants (local residents) for homegarden characteristics, such as size, management diversification, and crop species richness, and their effect on arthropod communities in Jambi province, Indonesia. Vane traps, pitfall traps and sweep netting were used to survey the arthropod communities, in particular bees and wasps, in 24 homegardens. Our results show that the native Jambi locals used a smaller number of management practices and had smaller homegardens than the Javanese transmigrants, whereas crop species richness did not differ. Management diversification and crop species richness were positively related to arthropod abundance as well as species richness of bees and wasps, presumably due to the enhanced homegarden heterogeneity. Our findings suggest that the cultural practices of migrant versus non-migrant land-use managers, which is usually neglected in agroecology, can be a major determinant of management practices shaping community structure and services of beneficial arthropods...|$|E

The results showed that the habitat changes due to human activities had changed not only to the moth diversity but also to their structure within communities. The number of moth species decreased significantly as well as the number of lower taxa (family) in the disturbed forest (secondary forest, Agathis forest, and transition area) within ranges: 20 - 50 and 10 - 20 %.

40|$|From its advent in 2005 within {{global climate}} change negotiations, {{reducing}} carbon emissions from deforestation and other forest-related activities (so-called REDD+) has been experimented with in developing country contexts {{for over a decade}} now, with a wide array of expectations coming to be associated with it. Three consecutive conceptualizations are identifiable: carbon-centered, where REDD+ is primarily a climate mitigation strategy; co-benefits-centered, where REDD+ becomes a triple win solution for climate, biodiversity and communities; and landscape-centered, where REDD+ activities are embedded in integrated sustainable land-use approaches. In assessing such evolving expectations against existing REDD+ experiences, a mixed picture emerges. Some expectations, specifically relating to forest carbon financing, are not being adequately met, while others, notably the delivery of co-benefits, hold out more promise. Yet this also highlights a potential paradox facing REDD+. While there is growing recognition that co-benefit generation is key, and that piece-meal, forest-carbon focused REDD+ interventions are unlikely to address the complex causes of <b>tropical</b> <b>forest</b> <b>loss,</b> forest carbon is still being foregrounded in measuring and reporting on REDD+ performance, and in generating results-based payments (even as these aspects remain challenging). This implies, however, that the future of REDD+ may lie not in one conceptualization coming to dominate, but rather in co-existence of heterogeneous practices. REDD+ may end up as a patchwork of projects and practices with different foci and financing mechanisms.

The primary narrative {{raised in the}} literature is that REDD+ will be of limited utility for reducing forest carbon loss in Southeast Asia, while the level of finance committed falls short of profits from alternative land-use activities in the region, including large-scale timber and oil palm operations. Here we assess the financial costs and carbon benefits of various REDD+ strategies deployed in the region. We find the cost of reducing emissions ranges from $ 9 to $ 75 per tonne of avoided carbon emissions. The strategies focused on reducing forest degradation and promoting forest regrowth are the most cost-effective ways of reducing emissions and used in over 60 % of REDD+ projects. By comparing the financial costs and carbon benefits of {{a broader range of}} strategies than previously assessed, we highlight the variation between different strategies and draw attention to opportunities where REDD+ can achieve maximum carbon benefits cost-effectively. These findings have broad policy implications for Southeast Asia. Until carbon finance escalates, emissions reductions can be maximized from reforestation, reduced-impact logging and investing in improved management of protected areas. Targeting cost-efficient opportunities for REDD+ is important to improve the efficiency of national REDD+ policy, which in-turn fosters greater financial and political support for the scheme. 11 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Rapid human-induced {{conversion}} and degradation of natural habitats has severely altered patterns of species occupancy and population viability. Primates are highly vulnerable to <b>tropical</b> <b>forest</b> <b>loss</b> and degradation {{because they are}} highly arboreal, forest-dependent, and often highly sensitive to changes in forest structure. Here we quantify the effects of anthropogenic habitat modification on primate community structure using a global meta-analysis based on 72 studies to understand the variation in effect sizes between biogeographic regions, types of human disturbance, trophic levels of primate species, and sampling design protocols. We examined response ratios for 637 comparisons between disturbed forests and adjacent ‘pseudo-control’ forests {{with a history of}} little or no impact. This revealed an overall decrease of 30 % (95 % CI: 17 – 43 %) in biodiversity metrics in response to habitat disturbance, which was particularly detrimental to primate assemblages in Madagascar and Southeast Asia. This effect was more severe in areas converted to agriculture (77 %; 95 % CI: 59 – 88 %), while land use intensification led to far more detrimental effects than the initial degradation of forests, calling for the identification of habitat degradation thresholds. Negative effects of forest degradation were further exacerbated by ~ 30 % under scenarios of persistent hunting pressure, emphasizing possible synergistic interactions between environmental stressors. Given that overall primate diversity was depressed in degraded habitats, our results emphasize the importance of retaining connectivity across remnants of undisturbed primary forest within human-modified landscapes to maintain full complements of primate species, and ensure their long-term persistence...|$|E
40|$|In an {{interval}} of just 1 - 2 decades, {{the nature of}} <b>tropical</b> <b>forest</b> destruction has changed. Rather than being dominated by rural farmers, tropical deforestation now is substantially driven by major industries and economic globalization, with timber operations, oil and gas development, large-scale farming and exotic-tree plantations being the most frequent causes of <b>forest</b> <b>loss.</b> Although instigating serious challenges, such changes are also creating important new opportunities for forest conservation. Here we argue that, by increasingly targeting strategic corporations and trade groups with public-pressure campaigns, conservation interests could have a much stronger influence {{on the fate of}} <b>tropical</b> <b>forests...</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Tropical</b> <b>forest</b> {{clearing}} {{threatens the}} sustainability of critically important global ecosystems services, including climate regulation and biodiversity. Indonesia {{is home to the}} world’s third largest <b>tropical</b> <b>forest</b> and second highest rate of deforestation; as such, it {{plays an important role in}} both increasing greenhouse gas emissions and loss of biodiversity. In this study, a method is implemented for quantifying Indonesian primary <b>forest</b> <b>loss</b> by landform, including wetlands. A hybrid approach is performed for quantifying the extent and change of primary forest as intact and degraded types using a per-pixel supervised classification mapping followed by a GIS-based fragmentation analysis. The method was prototyped in Sumatra, and later employed for the entirety of Indonesia, and can be replicated across the tropics in support of REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation) initiatives. Mapping of Indonesia’s wetlands was performed using cloud-free Landsat image mosaics, ALOS-PALSAR imagery and topographic indices derived from the SRTM. Results quantify an increasing rate of primary <b>forest</b> <b>loss</b> over Indonesia from 2000 to 2012.

40|$|<b>Tropical</b> <b>forests</b> do {{far more}} than sustain biodiversity; they are homes to {{indigenous}} peoples, pharmacopeias of natural products, and provide vital ecosystem services, such as flood amelioration and soil conservation.

I highlight these benefits, then assess the pattern and pace of <b>tropical</b> <b>forest</b> destruction in the Americas, Asia, and Africa. Asia emerges as the most immediate concern, because it has less surviving forest than the other two regions and higher relative rates of deforestation and logging.
