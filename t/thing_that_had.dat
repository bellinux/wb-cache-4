25|$|Her Imperial Majesty Empress Elisabeth of Austria visited Summerhill House in February 1879. The {{preparations}} were a well kept secret; {{the first}} <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>had</b> to be sorted is where would she stay. Meath hunted the best hounds and Summerhill was centrally located, so Summerhill was chosen. When {{she was on}} one hunt in Dunshaughlin, as they came to Maynooth, they came across two men repairing a demesne wall of the Catholic seminary. As the deer they were hunting jumped into {{the land of the}} college, Her Imperial Majesty followed without knowing where she was going and nearly jumped on the President of the college, Professor William Walsh, who later became His Grace The Most Reverend Dr. William Walsh, Lord Primate of Ireland and Lord Archbishop of Dublin.|$|E

[...] She agreed with the assessment that her dismissal originated from ABC and not Shonda Rhimes herself, stating: [...] "it definitely seemed like [...] hands were tied." [...] Rhimes also said: [...] "We didn't have a controversy with Dr. Hahn. The press created a whole <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>had</b> {{nothing to do with}} reality." ...|$|E

500|$|The Shield was {{presented}} to Arsenal by Lord Alexander of Tunis, the Minister of Defence. Gate receipts for the match totalled £6,589. In his assessment of the game, The Manchester Guardians football correspondent John Woodcock wrote: [...] "The football {{was not the only}} <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>had</b> been of a high order. The sportsmanship and spirit in which it was played had been in every way as fine." [...] Arsenal ended the season 12th in the First Division, and reached the fourth round of the FA Cup. Blackpool finished six positions higher in the league, but progressed no further than the fifth round of the cup competition.|$|E
500|$|Jacques Parizeau, {{who had not}} {{prepared}} a concession speech, rejected one prepared by Jean-François Lisée and spoke without notes. Noting that 60% of French-speakers had voted yes, he stated that he would address French-speaking Québécois as [...] ("we"), {{and that they had}} spoken clearly in favour of the [...] "Yes." [...] He then stated that the only <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>had</b> stopped the [...] "Yes" [...] side was [...] "money and ethnic votes" [...] and that the next referendum would be successful with only a few percentage more of French speakers onside. The remarks, widely lambasted in the Canadian and international press as ethnocentric, sparked surprise and anger in the [...] "Yes" [...] camp, as the movement had {{gone to great lengths to}} disown ethnic nationalism.|$|E
500|$|Graham found {{writing for}} two Doctors easy, as Smith's Doctor had a {{constant}} [...] "internal dialogue" [...] {{and was always}} finishing his own sentences. He wanted each character to be different {{and did not want}} all of them to become evil, and the Doctor would help them discover their humanity. Graham wanted Jennifer to be the antagonist as he liked the idea of the quietest character becoming the most evil. The original script explained that she has a perfect memory, and so her Ganger was able to remember every terrible <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>had</b> happened to the Flesh. Several other sequences were cut from the final version of [...] "The Almost People". In the original script, the Doctor quizzes the Flesh Doctor about the events of The Mind of Evil (1971) and mentions former companions Jo Grant, Sarah Jane Smith, Romana, Rose Tyler, Martha Jones, and Donna Noble. There was also a montage of happy memories of the Doctor's life stored in the Flesh Doctor, which included flashbacks of previous episodes and serials of the show as well as events that had not transpired onscreen. Also cut was the TARDIS providing the Doctor with another sonic screwdriver after he had given it to the Flesh Doctor, in a similar fashion to [...] "The Eleventh Hour".|$|E

500|$|Rollason began feeling unwell in 1996 {{during an}} eight-week {{assignment}} to the US, {{where she was}} covering that year's Olympic and Paralympic Games. She {{was diagnosed with cancer}} of the colon in August 1997, which she was told had also spread to her liver. She was initially given three months to live, but confounded medical opinion by fighting the disease long after that. She underwent treatment with chemotherapy, but also used a combination of holistic therapies and diet to treat her condition. The cancer later metastasised to her lungs. Rollason continued to work throughout her illness, despite sessions of chemotherapy that left her feeling weak, and cited her work as the <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>had</b> kept her going throughout her treatment. [...] "I stay working because I love it, and because I feel best on the days when I'm busy. I'd far rather work than hang around the house – even though there are days when I can hardly get out of bed." [...] She presented sports bulletins for BBC News, wrote a weekly column about her illness for the Sunday Mirror Magazine and worked on a book about her experience that she hoped would help others diagnosed with the disease. She cited the determination of the many disabled athletes she had got to know through her work as having given her the strength of mind to fight her illness. In October 1998, the BBC aired a special edition of its QED documentary series titled Hope for Helen, which followed her as she underwent a course of treatment. The film earned her much support from the public for her courage. in December 1998, colleagues paid tribute to an emotional-looking Rollason during the BBC's Sports Review of the Year, a compliment that produced mixed feelings for the presenter. She later wrote of the incident, [...] "I felt a mixture of horror, embarrassment and incredible warmth towards my colleagues that they should think of doing this".|$|E
2500|$|A {{story has}} often been told, {{probably}} apocryphally, that {{the solution to the}} problem eventually occurred to Bradley while he was in a sailing-boat on the River Thames. [...] He noticed that when the boat turned about, a small flag {{at the top of the}} mast (a telltale) changed its direction, even though the wind had not changed; [...] the only <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>had</b> changed was the direction and speed of the boat. Bradley worked out the consequences of supposing that the direction and speed of the earth in its orbit, combined with a consistent speed of light from the star, might cause the apparent changes of stellar position that he observed. [...] He found that this fitted the observations well, and also gave an estimate for the speed of light, and showed that the stellar parallax, if any, with extremes in June and December, was far too small to measure at the precision available to Bradley. [...] (The smallness of any parallax, compared with expectations, also showed that the stars must be many times more distant from the Earth than anybody had previously believed.) ...|$|E
