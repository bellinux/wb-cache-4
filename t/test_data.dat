5|$|<b>Test</b> <b>data</b> {{from the}} earlier Lockheed X-7 {{unmanned}} ramjet/rocket program proved invaluable for aerodynamic research since the XF-104 would share the general design of the X-7's wing and tail. Experience gained from the Douglas X-3 Stiletto was also used in the design phase of the XF-104. Over 400 surplus instrumented artillery rockets were launched to test various airfoils and tail designs; from which the camera film and telemetry were recovered by parachute.|$|E
5|$|A key {{development}} of the testing program was a miss-distance indicator system, which independently measured {{the distance between the}} Zeus and the target at the instant the computers initiated the detonation of the warhead. There were concerns that if the Zeus' own radars were used for this ranging measure, any systematic error in ranging would also be present in the <b>test</b> <b>data,</b> and thus would be hidden. The solution was the use of a separate UHF-frequency transmitter in the warhead reentry vehicle, and a receiver in the Zeus. The received signal was retransmitted to the ground, where its Doppler shift was examined to extract the range information. These instruments eventually demonstrated that the Zeus' own tracking information was accurate. For visual tracking, a small conventional warhead was used, which provided a flash that could be seen on long exposure photographs of the interceptions.|$|E

5|$|For testing purposes, a {{new engine}} {{consisting}} of six Armstrong Siddeley Viper jet engines blowing across the outer rim of an impeller was designed {{under the name}} PV-704, PV stood for Private Venture. The PV-704 was a stop-gap design built into a bunker-like building behind the Avro Experimental Test facility. It was intended to test various Project 1794 concepts and provide the USAF with <b>test</b> <b>data</b> to show {{the viability of the}} concept. The original plan to initially test the Viper Engine Rig was to have continued into free flight testing. Unfortunately, testing was anything but smooth; the test model suffered from hazardous oil leaks, resulting in three fires. It eventually got to the point that staff were afraid of the machine, even when safely ensconced in a booth constructed of bullet-proof glass and quarter-inch-thick steel. A final, disastrous and nearly lethal engine test in 1956 which involved a Viper jet engine running wild, convinced Frost that a less dangerous test vehicle was necessary.|$|E
5|$|The {{atmospheric}} {{results were}} supplemented by the underground <b>test</b> <b>data</b> accumulated in the 1960s at the Nevada Test Site, {{as it was}} hoped that powerful explosions conducted in confined space might result in improved yields and heavier isotopes. Apart from traditional uranium charges, combinations of uranium with americium and thorium have been tried, as well as a mixed plutonium-neptunium charge, but they were less successful in terms of yield and was attributed to stronger losses of heavy isotopes due to enhanced fission rates in heavy-element charges. Product isolation was problematic as the explosions were spreading debris through melting and vaporizing the surrounding rocks at depths of 300–600 meters. Drilling to such depths to extract the products was both slow and inefficient in terms of collected volumes.|$|E

This created a series of disputes between Von Braun's team at ABMA and NASA, as the former preferred simply making the abort system as foolproof as possible so as to guarantee that the astronaut would be bailed out of a malfunctioning launch vehicle, while the latter favored maximum booster reliability to minimize the chance of aborts happening at all.|$|E

40|$|The {{literature}} {{has shown that}} surveillance data for common sexually transmitted infections (STIs) does not adequately measure disease occurrence or effectiveness of control measures {{because the number of}} notifications is strongly influenced by the amount of testing. This thesis explores how laboratory <b>testing</b> <b>data</b> could be used to improve the surveillance of STIs in the Northern Territory (NT), which has very high levels of STIs, particularly in the Aboriginal population. Over the past 15 years, innovations using <b>testing</b> <b>data</b> to improve STI surveillance systems have occurred in several countries, and more recently in two Australian states, with differing but promising success, but most of them lacked sustainability. I therefore examined the theoretical and practical aspects of enhancing an STI surveillance system using laboratory <b>testing</b> <b>data,</b> and conducted three projects to test the feasibility and effectiveness of this approach in the NT. The first project used <b>testing</b> <b>data</b> to investigate the sharp decrease in gonococcal cultures performed in the NT, illustrating the data’s utility in monitoring testing activities at the jurisdiction level. The second project used <b>testing</b> <b>data</b> to calculate <b>testing</b> rates and test positivity rates to assist in the interpretation of time trends in the gonorrhoea notification rate at the district level. The third project used <b>testing</b> and notification <b>data</b> {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} a sexual health program (that included population screening for STIs) in a group of remote communities. The benefits of using laboratory <b>testing</b> <b>data</b> to enhance STI surveillance have been demonstrated in several countries and two Australian states. The thesis has demonstrated the feasibility of accessing and analysing such data in the NT and the benefits for STI control in a high-prevalence population. I therefore conclude by proposing a best practice model for how such an enhanced surveillance system could, and should, be implemented in the NT...|$|R
