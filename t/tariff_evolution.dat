30|$|Conclusion This {{simulation}} {{gives an}} estimate of the economical pressure sustained by the French ICUs during the last 6 years. Productivity gains are necessary to cope the <b>tariff</b> <b>evolution</b> and may require reduction of costs, increase of activity and pricing optimization.|$|E
40|$|Farmers {{continue}} to show great differences in irrigation water use, {{even for a}} given location and crop. Irrigation advisory services have narrowed the gap between scientific knowledge and on-farm scheduling, but their success has been limited. The performance of sprinkler irrigation is greatly affected by factors such as wind speed, whose short-time variability requires tactical adjustments of the irrigation schedule. Mounting energy costs often require the consideration of interday and intraday <b>tariff</b> <b>evolution.</b> Opportunities have arisen that allow these challenges to be addressed through irrigation controllers guided by irrigation and crop simulation models. Remote control systems are often installed in collective pressurized irrigation networks. Agrometeorological information networks are available in regions worldwide. Water users’ associations use specialized databases for water management. Different configurations of irrigation controllers based on simulation models can develop, continuously update, and execute irrigation schedules aiming at maximizing irrigation adequacy and water productivity. Bottlenecks requiring action {{in the fields of}} research, development, and innovation are analyzed, with the goal of establishing agendas leading to the implementation and commercial deployment of advanced controllers for solid-set irrigation...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper has}} two main purposes. The {{first is to}} present, to analyze and to suggest road {{infrastructure}} investment and financing policies in Brazil. The second objective is to analyze toll road concessions, with emphasis on toll tariffs. For {{the last eight years}} federal road investment (at constant prices) has increased significantly. From 2003 to 2010, investments have climbed from R$ 1, 3 billion to R$ 10, 3 billion, representing an increase of 700 %. Private investments were basically flat during the 2002 - 2007 period, with an average annual investment of R$ 1, 8 billion. From 2007 on, due to road concessions, such a pattern has changed as private investment rose to reach a two-fold increase by 2010 (R$ 3, 6 billion). Given the Brazilian road system, we calculate investment per kilometer, both for public roads and the conceded ones. Although the public and private investments per kilometer have increased, {{for the last eight years}} private investments were higher than public investments. From 2003 to 2010, investments per kilometer in conceded roads have gone from R$ 152 mil/km to R$ 239 mil/km, a 57 % increase. For the same period, investments in federal roads rose 641 %, reaching R$ 178 mil/km by 2010. This paper also presents a transport infrastructure investment plan for the next 15 years, according to which Brazil should invest about 3, 4 % of its GDP in order to catch up with developing countries. It means to invest R$ 125 billion per year (much more than the R$ 23, 4 billion invested through 2010). From 2006 to 2010, road infrastructure accounts for 55, 2 % of total transport investments. At such a pace, for the next five years Brazil would invest about R$ 69 billion per year in road infrastructure. We also calculate toll tariff for Brazilian concessions. Firstly, we obtain a Federal Average Toll Tariff from the tariffs defined by the Federal Concessions Programme that took place throughout 1995 - 1997 and 2008 - 2009. Moreover, we compare toll <b>tariff</b> <b>evolution</b> during the 1995 - 2011 period with inflation rates measured by the Brazilian CPI. We conclude that toll prices for all the federal concessions have risen faster than prices measured by CPI, representing a burden on road users. Besides, we calculate State Average Tariff, which covers seven states that have implemented road concessions. Finally, we present the Brazilian Average Tariff, which takes into account toll tariff charged at federal and state conceded roads...|$|E

40|$|This {{analysis}} {{focuses on}} factors determining {{the transition of}} international trade in the Czech economy. Even though the Czech economy was exposed to several structural shocks during 1993 – 2002 and grew at a very low rate, its external trade flows sustained an annual growth at around 10 %. The restructuring {{in the pattern of}} specialisation with the EU- 15 was exceptionally intensive and our results confirm that its progress {{can be explained by the}} variables used in the theories of open economies. The undergoing changes were profound and painful, but their positive final outcome is undisputable. In the econometric part of this study we quantify the determining factors of Czech exports and imports during 1993 – 2002 when the trade flows have undergone intensive structural and qualitative changes facilitating the trade creation. Our findings lend significance to the variables of aggregate demand and the real exchange rate, in addition to liberalisation of <b>tariffs,</b> <b>evolution</b> of unit prices of exports and imports, changes in quality, diversion in factor usage and economies of scale.

40|$|AbstractThe duopoly {{competition}} model {{presented in}} this paper tries to explain why a two-part tariff exists in the telecommunication industry. The investigation of competition and evolution between linear and two-part tariffs shows how the growth of the market and the sequence of action may affect equilibrium. The two pricing patterns are assumed to be virtual participants to constitute a <b>tariff</b> competition and <b>evolution</b> model, and by calculation, we can obtain metaphase equilibrium and evolution equilibrium. The conclusion shows that optimized Pareto equilibrium should be carried out by combining linear pricing and buffet pricing, this case being presented as a three-part tariff when many sub-markets coexist...|$|R
