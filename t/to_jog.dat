On June 13, {{the day of the}} Stephen Foster Handicap, American Pharoah was paraded on the track between races. A crowd of 30,000 people showed up to see him as he was hand-walked for about 45 minutes in front of the grandstand and in the paddock. Zayat, Baffert and Espinoza were also given their permanent keepsake Kentucky Derby and Triple Crown trophies in a ceremony that evening. American Pharoah's popularity was so high that his win made the cover of Sports Illustrated, he was photographed for Vogue, and during the NBA Playoffs, the coach of the Golden State Warriors, Steve Kerr, suggested that American Pharoah was the only athlete better than LeBron James.|$|E

According to Rathbun, one night the incarcerated executives were ordered <b>to</b> <b>jog</b> to a building 400 yards away and back. As they were herded back to their office-prison, he broke away and hid in bushes until the group had disappeared from sight. He retrieved his motorcycle, hid in the brush and drove out through the Gold Base gates when they were opened to let a car in.

5|$|Kanons story {{revolves}} around {{a group of}} five girls whose lives {{are connected to the}} same boy. Yuichi Aizawa is a second-year high school student who had visited the city where the story takes place seven years prior to Kanons beginning. The story opens on Wednesday January 6, 1999 when Yuichi arrives in the city and is very detached from it and its inhabitants. Prior to his return, it is decided that he is to stay with his first cousin, Nayuki Minase, and her mother, Akiko. After his long absence, Yuichi has forgotten almost everything except minor details of what happened seven years before and is in need of being reminded of what he left behind. Nayuki initially tries repeatedly <b>to</b> <b>jog</b> his memory, but is unsuccessful. Throughout the story, as he learns about the supernatural undertones of the city, Yuichi is reminded of the events of seven years ago.|$|E
5|$|The vampires include: the Fool (voiced by Ron Funches), the Empress Eyes (voiced by Rebecca Romijn), the Hierophant (voiced by Paul Williams), the Moon (voiced by Beau Billingslea), and the Vampire King himself (voiced by Billy Brown). The vampires are {{surprised}} {{that they are}} alive again, but quickly disagree {{on what to do}} next and go off on their separate ways. Witnessing this, Jake warns Finn and Marceline. Upon realizing the Vampire King is alive again, Marceline flashes back to her previous battle with him. In order to preserve the vampire race, the Vampire King sacrificed himself to bite Marceline, making her the last vampire. Marceline manages to track down and confront the resurrected Vampire King, killing the Fool and reabsorbing his power of flight. However, before she can battle the still weak Vampire King, he warns her that the Empress is headed for the Ice Kingdom. Fearing {{for the safety of the}} Ice King (voiced by Tom Kenny), Marceline gives chase. The Empress arrives at the Ice Kingdom and uses her powers to hypnotize the Ice King, ordering him to bring her the blood of Finn. Marceline attempts to attack the Empress right as the Ice King returns with a captured Finn. Finn escapes, and the Empress orders Ice King to capture them. In an attempt <b>to</b> <b>jog</b> the Ice King's memory, Marceline tells him that she was motivated to start hunting vampires when she killed one trying to attack a human family. However, it's revealed that the Ice King was never hypnotized by the Empress, but merely acting as he always does around women. Marceline then attacks the Empress, but the Empress quickly gains the upper hand until she is paralyzed by a special gun Bubblegum developed. Marceline kills the Empress and reabsorbs her power of invisibility. She then apologizes to her friends for trying to fight the vampires alone and tells them they will hunt the remaining vampires together.|$|E

40|$|Striped bedding-veins are veins {{that lie}} subparallel to bedding {{and have an}} {{internal}} layering or lineation at a small angle to the veinsâ long axis. They form during bedding-parallel slip {{and can be used}} as shear sense indicators. Solid inclusion trails produce the visible internal layering or lineation and track the opening direction of the veins. Elongate quartz crystals however can be oriented at an angle of up to 80 Â° to the opening direction, are non-tracking, and contain almost no information on the shear sense. The striped bedding-veins can be separated into three types according to the geometry of their internal segmentation. Veins of type B opened parallel <b>to</b> <b>jogs</b> oriented at a low angle to bedding, veins of type J opened parallel <b>to</b> <b>jogs</b> oriented at a high angle to bedding and veins of type O opened orthogonal <b>to</b> bedding and <b>jogs.</b> Striped bedding-veins of types B and J contain crackâseal inclusion bands and displacement parallel inclusion trails. Striped bedding-veins of type O feature only crackâseal inclusion bands. The example of striped bedding-veins presented in this paper from the Orobic Alps of Italy belongs to type B. The lineation in the veins and the orientation of the inclusion bands and inclusion trails, as well as the orientation of steps in the vein wall, can be used to determine the sense of shear and the direction and amount of vein opening or bedding-parallel slip...|$|R

500|$|Although Lindwall {{was able}} <b>to</b> <b>jog</b> between the wickets, {{he did not}} take the field in the second innings and the 12th man Neil Harvey {{replaced}} him. This gave Australia a marked fielding advantageâFingleton described Harvey as [...] "by far the most brilliant fieldsman of both sides". Yardley was sceptical as to whether Lindwall was sufficiently injured to be forced from the field, but he did not formally object to Harveyâs presence on the field. Journalist, former Australian Test cricketer and Lindwall mentor Bill O'Reilly, said that as Lindwall demonstrated his mobility during his innings, he was in no way [...] "incapacitated" [...] and that the English captain [...] "must be condemned for carrying his concepts of sportsmanship too far" [...] when no substitute was justified. O'Reilly decried the benefit Australia derived through the substitution, agreeing with Fingleton that Harvey was the tourists' best fielder by far.

500|$|Before the American {{settlement}} of the Chicago area, the lake shoreline fluctuated {{from year to year}} as storm waves eroded parts of the shore and built up the shore elsewhere. By 1803, when American troops started the construction of Fort Dearborn, a baymouth bar blocked the mouth of the river causing it <b>to</b> <b>jog</b> southwards and enter Lake Michigan at about the level of present-day Madison Street. When surveyed in 1821 the Lake Michigan shoreline north of the river ran approximately along what is now North St Clair Street, just to the east of what is now Michigan Avenue. In 1834, after a number of failed attempts to cut through the sandbar {{at the mouth of the}} river, a [...] pier was built to protect a channel cut through the bar. Silt and sand accumulated north of this pier, creating usable land that was later nicknamed [...] "The Sands". Squatters and a vice district encroached on the district, causing angst among the property owners. In 1857, Chicago Mayor John Wentworth evicted these trespassers from the land.|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 49 - 51) The {{present study}} attempted {{to determine if}} rope skipping for 10 minutes was equivalent <b>to</b> <b>jogging</b> for 30 minutes, with respect to several physiological parameters. These parameters were heart rate, oxygen uptake, and caloric cost. Twenty-eight subjects were used in this investigation, 12 men and 16 women. Subjects were divided into either group I or group II. Group I contained 20 subjects and was divided into smaller subgroups, group IA (rope skipping) and group IB (jogging). Subjects who participated in group I were used in a four-week longitudinal study {{to determine the effects}} rope skipping and jogging had on heart rate and oxygen uptake. Each subject was measured for heart rate and oxygen uptake during pre and post maximal treadmill tests.

The game was officially {{unveiled}} by both Mario creator and producer Shigeru Miyamoto and co-director Chihiro Fujioka at the 1995 V-Jump Festival event in Japan. Miyamoto led teams at Nintendo and Square, who spent over a year developing the graphics. The story takes place in a newly rendered Mushroom Kingdom based on the Super Mario Bros. series. Square reported that the game was about 70% complete in October 1995. The developers created the interior elements such as columns, stairways, and exterior elements with advanced computer modeling techniques. Special lighting effects were used to create shadows and reflections that were meant to improve the 3D elements. With guidance from Miyamoto, Square developed the game, combining role-playing aspects of previous Square games like Final Fantasy VI with the platforming elements of Nintendo's games. Square's Final Fantasy series was the model for the battle sequences, while the tradition of Super Mario Bros. games demanded a lot of action. Mario's ability <b>to</b> <b>jog</b> in eight directions and jump up or down in threeâquarter perspective gave him a (comparatively) large range of motion.
