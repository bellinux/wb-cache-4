5|$|After {{her return}} to Japan, Hōshō was {{transferred}} to the Third Fleet, unofficially assigned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>training</b> fleet (later called the Mobile Force Training Force), and officially assigned in October. She conducted flight training in the Inland Sea for aircraft that flew in from shore bases, since no aircraft were based on board Hōshō. On 15 January 1943, the 50th Air Flotilla was created for carrier aircrew training and both Hōshō and Ryūhō were assigned to the new unit. The two ships provided carrier landing training and served as target ships for torpedo training. In January 1944, Hōshō was reassigned to the 12th Air Fleet, then to the Combined Fleet, but continued to perform the same mission of training fleet carrier pilots in the Inland Sea. In this role, Hōshō shuttled back and forth between Kure and the Western Inland Sea, spending equal amounts of time at each location.|$|E
5|$|Black Prince {{was again}} {{refitted}} in 1874–75, gaining a poop deck, and rejoined the Channel Fleet as flagship of Rear Admiral Sir John Dalrymple-Hay, second-in-command of the fleet. In 1878 Captain H.R.H. Duke of Edinburgh took command {{and the ship}} crossed the Atlantic {{to participate in the}} installation of a new Governor General of Canada. Upon her return Black Prince was placed in reserve at Devonport, and, reclassified as an armoured cruiser, she was reactivated periodically to take part in annual fleet exercises. Black Prince was hulked in 1896 as a harbour training ship, stationed at Queenstown, and was renamed Emerald in 1903. In 1910 the ship was moved to Plymouth and renamed Impregnable III when she was assigned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>training</b> school HMS Impregnable before she was sold for scrap on 21 February 1923.|$|E

In mid-1911, she was transferred <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Training</b> and Experimental Ships Unit, where she participated in training exercises in the Baltic. Brandenburg again temporarily returned to the III Squadron for the fleet maneuvers in August and September, and on 16 October she was again decommissioned.

5|$|During {{his tenure}} as {{principal}} of Comilla Victoria College, Khan developed {{a special interest in}} grassroots actions. Between 1954 and 1955, he took a break to work as director of the Village Agricultural and Industrial Development (V-AID) Programme. However, he was not satisfied with the development approach adopted in the programme that was limited <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>training</b> of villagers. In 1958, he went to Michigan State University to acquire education and training in rural development. Returning in 1959, he established the Pakistan Academy for Rural Development (PARD) at Comilla on 27 May 1959 and was appointed as its founding director. He also laid foundations for the Comilla Cooperative Pilot Project in 1959. In 1963, he received a Ramon Magsaysay Award from the Government of the Philippines for his services in rural development. Khan became Vice-chairman of the board of Governors of PARD in 1964, and in the same year, was awarded an honorary Doctorate of law by Michigan State University. In 1969, he delivered a series of lectures at Woodrow Wilson School, Princeton University, based on his experience with rural cooperatives. During the visit, he established collaborative links with Arthur Lewis.|$|E
5|$|Following {{her return}} from Cape Town, Schwalbe {{returned}} to supporting operations to pacify the coastal area in southern German East Africa {{carried out by}} Wissmann. During this period, several artillery pieces were captured, {{one of which was}} taken aboard Schwalbe before eventually being given <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Training</b> Inspection for the colonial troops. By mid-May, the uprising had finally been suppressed. Schwalbe thereafter conducted the normal peacetime routine of cruising the coast to show the German flag. Hirschberg contracted malaria and became severely ill, prompting his return to Germany on 24 June to recover; KK Rüdiger arrived on 13 July to take over command of the ship. On 9 October, Rüdiger presided over a ceremony to dedicate a memorial in Tanga to the naval personnel who had been killed in the Abushiri revolt. Meanwhile, on 1 July, Wituland had been ceded to Britain as part of the Heligoland–Zanzibar Treaty; this development upset the Sultan of Wituland, who ordered the killing of several Europeans in the colony, mostly Germans. The British launched a punitive expedition, and Schwalbe remained in the area as an observer until the end of October.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} the war in late 1918, Germany {{was forced}} to sign the Treaty of Versailles, which {{significantly}} reduced Germany's naval strength. The new Reichsmarine was limited to six old pre-dreadnought battleships, six light cruisers, twelve destroyers, and twelve torpedo boats. All other vessels, to include Nautilus, were to either be sold for scrap or demilitarized. As a result, the ship was stricken from the naval register on 21 March 1919 in Kiel. From 1921, she was used as a storage hulk in Bremen, before being renamed Hulk I on 1 January 1923. She was renamed again, as Hulk A on 1 April 1928 and moved to Bremerhaven, where she was assigned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Training</b> Inspectorate. She remained there for just four months, before being sold for 180,000marks and broken up in Copenhagen.|$|E
