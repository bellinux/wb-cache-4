The proposed system integration considering Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) assisted Geographic Information System (GIS) enables to monitor and control underground mining applications from surface office. Based on the capabilities of WSNs, ZigBee network is adapted for near real-time monitoring, ventilation system control and emergency communication in underground mine. ZigBee nodes were developed to sense environmental attributes such as temperature, humidity and gases concentration; switching ON and OFF ventilation fans; and texting emergency messages. A trigger action plan for monitored attributes above normal and <b>threshold</b> <b>value</b> limits is <b>programmed</b> in the surface GIS management server. It is designed to turn the auxiliary fans on remotely or automatically in orange condition and sending evacuation messages for underground miners in unsafe (red) condition. Multi-users operation and 3 D visualisations are other successful achievements of the proposed system for the underground monitoring and communication. ! 2015 Published by Elsevier B.

30|$|Because {{exposure}} and thresholding of CHPs can have both independent and interacting effects on HP accuracy (Song et al. 2014), these two processes {{should be examined}} together. A uniform basis for comparison of CHP {{exposure and}} thresholding effects was achieved by using two parameters, exposure manipulation and thresholding manipulation. Exposure manipulation was the extent of exposure deviating from the reference exposure measured under an unobscured overcast sky. Thresholding manipulation was transformed from the grey-scale <b>threshold</b> <b>value</b> using the regression model established by Song et al. (2014), in which the relationship between exposure manipulation (X) and the optimal <b>threshold</b> <b>value</b> (Y) is Y[*]=[*] 260.542 /(1 [*]+[*]e(−X+ 1.422)/ 1.160). This model determines the optimal <b>threshold</b> <b>values</b> for CHPs exposed with specific exposure manipulations. If a CHP is analysed with a <b>threshold</b> <b>value</b> which is the optimal <b>threshold</b> <b>value</b> for CHPs acquired with exposure manipulation of S stop, this CHP is analysed with thresholding manipulation of S stop. For example, the optimal <b>threshold</b> <b>value</b> for CHPs acquired with exposure manipulation of +[*] 3 stop is 202. When a CHP is analysed with a <b>threshold</b> <b>value</b> of 202, its thresholding manipulation is +[*] 3 stop. The ETM extent can be quantified by subtracting the thresholding manipulation from the exposure manipulation. When the ETM extent of a CHP is 0 stop, that means this CHP is analysed with its optimal <b>threshold</b> <b>value</b> and it can provide a correct estimate for HP. Positive ETM extents indicate that CHPs are overexposed or analysed with <b>threshold</b> <b>values</b> that are too low, so that gap fraction is overestimated. Negative ETM extents underestimate gap fraction, {{as a result of}} underexposing CHPs or analysing CHPs with <b>threshold</b> <b>values</b> that are too high.|$|R
