I came from the University of the Basque Country in San Sebastian. I have done my thesis for the electromechanics department. The objective of this project has been to design and develop a <b>tightening</b> <b>system</b> for bent sheet metal parts, {{because one of the}} subjects in the research group EMAP is the dimensional accuracy control of this kind of pieces. Different kind of bent parts have been proposed. These pieces are being studied by EMAP in cooperation with sheet metal processing companies. The bent parts have to be measured accurately and therefore the product has to be positioned and fixed as good as possible. When designing a tightening or fixing system we have to be sure that this system will be as flexible as possible and can tight more than one piece in the same system. It also has to be as easy as possible to use, to get a good positioning and to have a short change-over time. And at last, the system has to be as cheap as possible. It is also interesting to be able to measure pieces in series to spend less time measuring the pieces. The following steps have been taken to find the most interesting fixing system for the different bent plates. 1. - A market study on different tightening methods and tools. 2. - Designing different kind of fixing methods. 3. - Developing the best fixing system 4. - Evaluating the system (resistance calculations, choosing material,...|$|E
40|$|Embedment is a {{key feature}} of timber joints envisioned as the {{ultimate}} solution in avoiding the devastating full collapse of timber structures in seismic countries. The Japanese traditional timber post-and-beam structural system utilizes moment-resisting joints based on embedment. Despite the joint's advantages having the ductile and energy-absorptive behavior continuously to the post-elastic phases, a primary shortcoming {{needs to be resolved}} - specifically of having the low and unreliable initial stiffness due to the gap formation between the contacting members. Further, large-dimensioned timber most suitable for the embedment-type joint is scarce and the lower quality of available timbers is making the modern applications difficult. A new timber joint capable of sustaining future seismic impacts is being pursued using various approaches. As a result of the optimization to satisfy the manifold studies, two traditional elements, namely Kusabi wedge and side-penetrating Nageshi beam, are combined and tightened by the penetrating steel bolt. Its <b>tightening</b> <b>system</b> eliminates the gap formation in the joint, and heightens its performance over the traditional embedment-type joints. Additional features, such as the damage-inducing and fast seismic-retrofitting ability, are also integrated. This new proposal for the Kusabi-Nageshi (K-N) timber joint system aims to provide a new alternative to the joints used in seismic countries...|$|E
40|$|The main {{objectives}} {{of this study}} are to investigate the effects of three types of predamage and postdamage on the cracking behaviors of carbon fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) -strengthened reinforced concrete RC beams and to develop a rational methodology for predicting the average stabilized crack spacing. The predamage is induced by either sustained loading only or by the combination of sustained loading and corrosion. The predamage involved a sustained loading with an anchor <b>tightening</b> <b>system,</b> an electrochemical process to accelerate the migration of chlorides from an external electrolyte into the tested beams, and a wetting-drying cycle process with a controlled current to accelerate the corrosion of the reinforcing steel bars in the tested beams. The postdamage was induced by wetting-drying cycles. A loading test was conducted to determine the cracking behaviors of stabilized flexural cracks in the CFRP-strengthened beams with or without damage. The crack patterns, crack spacings, and test beam widths were recorded and compared, and the related mechanism was discussed. It was found that after CFRP strengthening, the effect of predamage or postdamage on the crack spacing and width is not as distinct as in the unstrengthened cases. The sustained loading predamaged beam showed insignificant differences in crack spacing and width compared to beams without predamage. Subsequently, a model capable of evaluating the crack behaviors of CFRP-strengthened beams with or without damage was developed. The analytical approach is based on equilibrium and compatibility equations to elucidate the average stresses of concrete and the CFRP laminate of a CFRP-strengthened beam element...|$|E

40|$|Tightening {{systems are}} used in several industries, {{including}} assembly in the auto- motive industry and installation of computer hardware. Both the company mak- ing the tools and the customers {{need to know the}} performance of the <b>tightening</b> <b>system</b> to ensure that the screw joints tighten as desired. This can be done using a test joint system. High demands on safety as well as fast assembly speeds, puts high demands on the test equipment. The problem with the existing test joints is that they are hard to do repeatable tests on. The most common test joints are constructed us- ing mechanic or hydraulic systems. The mechanical systems have problems with wear of screws, changes in lubrication etc., while the hydraulic systems some- times are too slow. This master’s thesis is a study of whether {{it would be possible to}} construct a test joint using an electric motor. The electric motor together with a controller should simulate a screw joint so that the tool would perceive it as a real one. All investigation has been performed by system modeling and simulations in MATLAB. Four different control structures have been evaluated: a PID controller, one combined controller which uses feedforward from reference as well as distur- bance, one which is based on the same structure as the second but with an added inner current loop and the last one is an LQ controller. The conclusion is that it is possible to make a test joint using an electric motor and that the LQ controller seems to be the best choice. To prove the result, a few more aspects could be investigated more closely. One is to add a dynamic model of the tool, now only the reference to the tool is used. Another is to implement it on hardware. ...|$|E

Residents interviewed indicated that dramatic changes driven by market competition, timber industry changes, increased regulation, and rural restructuring have occurred in both the landscape and community. The changes that have transpired as a result have redefined the relationship between the community and the landscape, moving away from local dependence on timber harvests to a relationship oriented around tourism and other ecosystem services. In doing so the community has transitioned from one with a logging community identity to one that has begrudgingly transitioned to a retirement and vacation community. Resilience thinking, a framework for assessing a social-ecological system’s ability to adapt and confront forces of change, indicates that the social-ecological system in the MRV is still in the midst of redefining the systems thresholds and key feedbacks. As a result of low institutional capacity the system is vulnerable to continued drivers of change from outside the local system. Using a modified version of Ostrom’s (2009) framework for the analysis of social-ecological systems, this study recommends policymakers and policy entrepreneurs take three key steps to facilitate enhanced system resilience: 1) ensure transboundary management strategies are put in place that transcend landownership classifications; 2) <b>tighten</b> <b>system</b> feedbacks to include more local influence; 3) develop local multilayered institutions organized vertically and horizontally...|$|R

40|$|Web server {{security}} {{is one of}} the most important security research problems today. In any network, most users communicate with a principal using web portals. Examples of a principal are large organizations, home businesses, government portals, personal web pages, search engines, online transaction systems and so on. Unlike other systems such as corporate data servers, mail servers, internal databases, etc which can be accessed only via corporate LAN or secure remote connection, web servers are always directly exposed to the internet. They are accessible to anyone in the world and hence probability of attacks is very high. Web sever intrusion can result in loss of important data, revenue loss, but more importantly in severe embarrassment of a reputed organization. There has been extensive research in this area and many security-related <b>tightening</b> <b>systems</b> available in the market. But internet hackers have always found a way to get around them. Most of the existing systems look for signatures in the web server requests to identify malicious attempts based on signatures already known to them. The limitation of this approach is that attack signatures can be changed in such a way to escape detection. In addition, new types of attacks cannot be detected as their signatures are not known. Another approach is to look for anomalies of requests instead. Advantage of this approach is that it is not influenced by attack signatures. It just distinguishes between normal and abnormal usage of existing web service, and so it is not vulnerable to altered signatures or new signatures. These systems are known as anomaly based systems. In this paper, we explore the implementation and evaluation of such a system. 1...|$|R
