2500|$|After the {{conclusion}} of his third season in the ABA, the dissatisfied Strom contacted NBA Commissioner Walter Kennedy to discuss returning to the NBA. [...] Encouraged {{with the support of}} Wayne Embry and Pat Williams, general managers of the Milwaukee Bucks and Chicago Bulls respectively, Strom met with Kennedy during the 1972 ABA Playoffs. Kennedy informed Strom that John Nucatola, supervisor of officials, manages the staffing of officials, but Strom received a vote of confidence {{to come back to the}} NBA in the form of a handshake from the commissioner. Strom met with Nucatola and discussed salary and benefits. Strom was told by Nucatola that he would be getting a $25,000 salary and was guaranteed a job in the NBA for the start of the 1972–73 NBA season through a handshake agreement although no contract was signed. Strom was told a contract would be available to sign upon the completion of his twelve-game ABA playoff officiating schedule. Strom called the league to ask why he was not scheduled to officiate after his guaranteed schedule of games and was told by Norm Drucker, then supervisor of officials for the ABA, [...] "You know the reason.

40|$|The Rātana Church; where Christianity, Politics and Māori Culture come {{together}} The Rātana Church is a Māori-Christian church, consisting of approximately 40, 000 members, {{most of them}} Māori, the indigenous people of New Zealand. They are te Iwi Mōrehu, the surviving non-tribal tribe of T. W. Rātana. According to the Church, T. W. Rātana was visited by the Holy Spirit in 1918, and chosen to be His mouthpiece of earth. He healed many people, and attracted a large following, based on non-tribal Christianity. The world view of the Church is dualistic; divided into the spiritual and the physical. The Church combines Christian spirituality {{with the emphasis on}} the material welfare of the Māori people. I have examined in what way the Rātana Church is both a Christian church, and a Māori movement. This is an empirical case study, describing the Rātana Church in light of the historical as well as anthropological context that it was born from. I have analysed the Rātana Church in contrast with ‘traditional Māori spirituality and culture’. The extent of identification with traditional Māori elements among the Mōrehu, the adherents of the Church, varies not only from person to person, but also according to the context. The members of the Rātana Church may appear to be stuck ‘betwixt and between’; not fully Māori, but certainly not Pākeha (white), both a creolised Māori culture and a syncretistic form of Christianity. <b>They</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> “It’s <b>not</b> a Māori Church; it’s a Christian Church, with Māori people, open for everyone. ” I have tried to show that it is a Māori-Christian Church, in the ethnicity of its members, the Māori cultural practices, and most importantly in the Māori identity of the Mōrehu. It is my understanding that the Rātana Church is a form of collectivism based on Christianity, with political roots, ethnic membership and cultural practice; religion, politics and culture coming together...|$|R

I asked how the vessel could go? <b>They</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>they</b> could <b>not</b> tell; but that there was cloth put upon the masts by {{the help of the}} ropes I saw, and then the vessel went on; and the white men had some spell or magic they put in the water when they liked, in order to stop the vessel. I was {{exceedingly}} amazed at this account, and really thought they were spirits. I there-fore wished much to be from amongst them, for I expected they would sacrifice me; but my wishes were vain—for we were so quartered that it was impossible for any of us to make our escape. [...] Accounts like these raised many questions as some slaves grew philosophical with their journey. Smallwood points the challenges for slaves were physical and metaphysical. The physical would be obvious as the challenge to overcome capacity, lack of ship room, and food. The metaphysical was unique as the open sea would challenge African slaves vision of the ocean as habitable.At essence, the journey on the ocean would prove to be an African's biggest fear that would keep them in awe. Combining this with the lack of knowledge of the sea, Africans would be entering a world of anxiety never seen before. Yet, Europeans were also fearful of the sea, but not to the extent of Africans. One of these dilemmas came with the sense of time. Africans used seasonal weather to predict time and days. The moon was a sense of time, but used like in other cultures. On the sea, Africans used the moon to best count the days, but the sea did not provide seasonal changes for them to know how long they were at sea.Counting the days on a ship was not the main priority however. Surviving the voyage was the main horror. No one escaped diseases as the close quarters infected everyone including the crew. Death was so common that ships were called tumbeiros or floating tombs. What shocked Africans the most was how death was handled in the ships. Smallwood says the traditions for an African death was delicate and community based. On ships, bodies would be thrown into the sea. Because the sea represented bad omens, bodies in the sea represented a form of purgatory and the ship a form of hell. In the end, the Africans who made the journey would have survived disease, malnutrition, confined space, close death, and the trauma of the ship.|$|R

I told him we could meet at a souk market near my neighborhood city plaza in Qatif.He started to drive me home. We were 15 minutes from my house. I told him that I was afraid and that he should speed up. We were about to turn the corner to my house when they carstopped right in front of our car. Two people got out of their car and stood on either side of our car. The man on my side had a knife. They tried to open our door. I told the individual with me not to open the door, but he did.

Kelly on his hardest {{and most}} {{emotional}} song he ever recorded:"I gotta say ‘Shut Up.’ It’s actually the last song off ‘Black Panties.’ The reason I say ‘Shut Up’ {{is because it}} was during a real serious {{time in my life}} as far as my vocals were concerned. I had a real big abscess, or something like that, on my vocal chords, and after doing a show, I collapsed and ended up in the hospital and doing surgery to get it off. After being in the hospital for two days — I was actually in there for six days — but after two days I started hearing rumors and getting texts and hearing people on the radio saying I’m done and this that and the other — although the doctor did tell me that there was a chance I {{would not be able to}} sing as strong or something would be a little different.""I was really in the dark. I didn’t know what was going on, but <b>they</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>not</b> to go in the studio for another month or two weeks or something like that. That’s like telling me to hold my breath for two weeks, and I couldn’t do that. So I got out the hospital six days later, and went right to the studio and started writing this song called ‘Shut Up.’ I was bleeding, I was crying, I was emotional. I was pissed because you give all these people all of this music for all of these years and you work your butt off to be somebody and to be a legend, and the minute it all looks like it’s going down, they just count you out. I was really hurt by that. So all my emotions went into that song." ...|$|E
