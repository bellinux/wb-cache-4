5|$|The priory buildings, {{including}} the church, were extended {{during the late}} 12th and early 13thcenturies. It {{has been estimated that}} <b>the</b> <b>original</b> <b>community</b> would have consisted of 12canons and the prior; this increased to around 26members in the later part of the 12thcentury, {{making it one of the}} largest houses in the Augustinian order. By the end of the century the church had been lengthened, a new and larger chapter house had been built (I* on the plan), and a large chapel had been added to the east end of the church (N). In about 1200 the west front of the church was enlarged (M), a bell tower was built and guest quarters were constructed. It is possible that the chapel at the east end was built to accommodate the holy cross of Norton, a relic which was reputed to have miraculous healing powers. A fire in 1236 destroyed the timber-built kitchen (Q) and damaged the west range of the monastic buildings and the roof of the church. The kitchen was rebuilt and the other damage was rapidly repaired.|$|E

25|$|A decade later, Dubourg was {{instrumental}} in the transfer from New York City of the widow and recent convert Elizabeth Seton, who had been unsuccessful in her efforts to run a school, in part to care for her family. With his encouragement, she and other women drawn to the vision of caring for the poor in a religious way of life came to found the first American congregation of Sisters in 1809. The Sulpicians served as their religious superiors until 1850, when <b>the</b> <b>original</b> <b>community</b> located there chose to merge with another religious institute of Sisters. In 1829, Sulpician Fr. James Joubert worked with Mary Lange, a Haitian immigrant, to establish the first community of black sisters in the United States, the Oblate Sisters of Providence.|$|E

Due to intermarriage in <b>the</b> <b>original</b> <b>community</b> of English settlers of the 1690s, and the recessive nature of genetic deafness, Chilmark had a high 4% rate of genetic deafness. MVSL was used even by hearing residents whenever a deaf person was present.|$|E

2500|$|Over {{long time}} scales, {{there is a}} {{tendency}} for species composition in pristine systems to remain in a stable state. [...] This has been found for both invertebrate and fish species. [...] On shorter time scales, however, flow variability and unusual precipitation patterns decrease habitat stability and can all lead to declines in persistence levels. [...] The ability to maintain this persistence over long time scales is related to the ability of lotic systems to return to <b>the</b> <b>original</b> <b>community</b> configuration relatively quickly after a disturbance (Townsend et al. 1987). [...] This is one example of temporal succession, a site-specific change in a community involving changes in species composition over time. [...] Another form of temporal succession might occur when a new habitat is opened up for colonization. [...] In these cases, an entirely new community that is well adapted to the conditions found in this new area can establish itself.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1880s, {{the arrival}} of the Southern Pacific and Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railroads, {{connecting}} Southern California to San Francisco and Salt Lake triggered a land boom, with speculators such as John W. North flooding the area now known as the Inland Empire. [...] North and others saw the area, with its hot, dry climate and ready access to water as an ideal center for citrus production. [...] The city of Redlands was soon established by Frank E. Brown, a civil engineer, and E. G. Judson, a New York stock broker, to provide a center (along with North's nearby settlement at Riverside) for the burgeoning citrus industry. They named their city “Redlands” after the color of the adobe soil. So large had the area grown by 1888 that it was decided to incorporate. [...] "A red-letter day in the Annals of Redlands," [...] pronounced Scipio Craig, editor of The Citrograph newspaper, of the November 26 incorporation. <b>The</b> <b>original</b> <b>community</b> of Lugonia was absorbed at this time. The newspaper was first published in July 1887 by The Citrograph Printing Company, which remains in 2017 as both Redlands' oldest business and the longest-operating printing company in California.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the sixteenth}} century, the Bawoyo dynasty, which {{belongs to the}} mighty Brotherhood of Blacksmiths of the Buvandji, led by Njimbe, and based on an army of warriors, is imposed on the local people {{on the coast of}} Loango. According to several sources, such as the English {{explorer}} Andrew Battel, present in the region around 1610, the Dutchman Olfert Dapper, as well as the English trader R.E. Dennett, Njimbe would be the founder of the Kingdom of Loango and his first sovereign with a Reign that would have lasted about sixty years. Initially, the province of the Kingdom of Kongo (Kongo Dia Nthotila - Kongo of the King), the Kingdom of Loango, in the company of the two provinces of Ngoyo and Kakongo, was freed in the sixteenth century and occupied a vast territory ranging from the region of Setté Cama to Gabon, to the current Cabinda to the south, from the Massif of Mayombe to the east to the confines of the Anziku Kingdom and the Atlantic Ocean to the west, where the capital Bwali was located. A proverb clearly illustrates <b>the</b> <b>original</b> <b>community</b> of the three secessionist provinces, as well as the religious role of the king of Ngoyo. This is: [...] "Makongo Nuni, Mangoyo Nthomi, Maloangu nkasi" [...] which literally means [...] "the Makongo is the husband, the Mangoyo the priest (keeper and officiating of the Tchibila Shrine of the god Bunzi) and the Malwangu the woman".|$|E
