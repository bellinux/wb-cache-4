25|$|An {{example of}} a {{successful}} application of the CCU method {{can be found at}} Exact Software (ES). ES is a manufacturer of accounting and enterprise resource planning software based in the Netherlands. ES has combined Product Data Management (PDM), Customer Relationship Management (CRM) and Software Configuration Management (SCM) {{in order to maintain the}} configuration at the customer site in a better and less complex way. ES has a module in its CRM software that contains all contracts of each customer. This is linked to their PDM system. Every contract corresponds to files that can be downloaded for a new version or update of a previous version. In the delivery phase this means that the customers are able to obtain all the products through an online connection. So ES sells contracts (licenses) and stores them into their CRM system, the delivery of the actual products can be done by the customers themselves completely automated requiring little effort. The PDM system is on its turn linked to <b>the</b> <b>SCM</b> system which keeps track of the configurations the customers are using. In the delivery phase this means that ES is able to automatically determine the customer needs whenever a customer does a request.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to analyze the {{preservation}} of the sternocleidomastoid muscle (M. SCM) after modified radical neck dissection (MRND). To evaluate postoperative functional outcome and life quality, clinical data of patients after neck dissection level I-V were analyzed and compared: 20 patients with preservation of <b>the</b> M. <b>SCM</b> to 20 patients without preservation of <b>the</b> M. <b>SCM.</b> Matched-Pairs-design was performed previously to gain homogenization within the compared study groups. For assessment of the postoperative sternocleidomastoid function to evaluate its degree of atrophy, electromyography (EMG) was recorded. Patients with preservation of <b>the</b> M. <b>SCM</b> showed a significant higher range of head-neck-motion in active inclination to the opposite non-operation-site, passive inclination and passive rotation to the operation-site. Compared to patients without neck dissection as control group, patients without preservation of <b>the</b> M. <b>SCM</b> showed significant limitation in head inclination and rotation. Patients with preservation of <b>the</b> M. <b>SCM</b> showed significant limitation only in head rotation. Shoulder mobility showing limitation in arm abduction and anteversion at the operation-site was significantly found in patients without preservation of <b>the</b> M. <b>SCM</b> (95 %) compared to patients with preservation of <b>the</b> M. <b>SCM</b> (20 %). In 45 % of the patients with preservation of <b>the</b> M. <b>SCM,</b> <b>the</b> EMG recorded no signal in the sternocleidomastoid muscle, presumably due to ischemic atrophy of the muscle. Among these patients were those accordant patients with preservation of <b>the</b> M. <b>SCM</b> and limitation of shoulder mobility. 55 % of the patients with preservation of <b>the</b> M. <b>SCM</b> showed recorded signals of <b>the</b> M. <b>SCM</b> in <b>the</b> EMG. These patients also performed a significant higher range of head rotation at the non-operation site compared to those 45 % of the patients without EMG recorded signals in <b>the</b> preservated M. <b>SCM.</b> <b>The</b> evaluation of the general and head-neck specific life quality demonstrated no significant advantage of preservating <b>the</b> M. <b>SCM.</b> As a conclusion the preservation of <b>the</b> M. <b>SCM</b> after neck dissection demonstrates an almost unlimited range of motion of the head, neck and shoulder, particularly when there is no postoperative muscle atrophy.

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that {{stormwater}} control measures (SCMs) are less effective at retaining phosphorus (P) than nitrogen. We compared P retention between two urban/suburban SCMs and their adjacent free-flowing stream reaches at the Baltimore Long-Term Ecological Study (LTER) site, and examined changes in P retention in SCMs across flow conditions. Results show that, when compared with free-flowing stream reaches, <b>the</b> <b>SCMs</b> had significantly lower dissolved oxygen (%DO) and higher P concentrations, as well as lower mean areal retention rates and retention efficiencies of particulate P (PP). In all <b>the</b> <b>SCMs,</b> concentrations of total dissolved phosphorus (TDP) consistently exhibited inverse correlations with %DO that was lower during summer base flows. Particulate phosphorus (PP) concentrations peaked during spring high flow period in both streams and in-line pond/SCMs, but they were also higher during summer base flows in suburban/urban SCMs. Meanwhile, PP areal retention rates and retention efficiencies of <b>the</b> <b>SCMs</b> changed from positive (indicating retention) during high flows to negative (indicating release) during low flows, while such changes across flow were not observed in free-flowing stream reaches. We attribute the changing roles of SCMs from a PP sink to a PP source to changes in SCM hydrologic mass balances, physical sedimentation and biogeochemical mobilization across flows. This study demonstrates that in suburban/urban SCMs, P retained during high flow events can be released during low flows. Cultivation of macrophytes and/or frequent sediment dredging may provide potential solutions to retaining both P and nitrogen in urban SCMs...|$|R

40|$|The role of {{convective}} {{processes in}} moistening the atmosphere during suppressed periods of the suppressed {{phase of a}} Madden-Julian oscillation is investigated in cloud-resolving model (CRM) simulations, {{and the impact of}} moistening on the subsequent evolution of convection is assessed as part of a Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment Cloud System Study (GCSS) intercomparison project. The ability of single-column model (SCM) versions of a number of state-of-the-art climate and numerical weather prediction models to capture these convective processes is also evaluated. During the suppressed periods, the CRMs are found to simulate a maximum moistening around 3 km, which is associated with a predominance of shallow convection. All SCMs produce adequate amounts of shallow convection during the suppressed periods, comparable to that seen in CRMs, but <b>the</b> relatively drier <b>SCMs</b> have higher precipitation rates than <b>the</b> relatively wetter <b>SCMs</b> and CRMs. <b>The</b> relatively drier <b>SCMs</b> dry, rather than moisten, the lower troposphere below the melting level. During the transition periods, convective processes act to moisten the atmosphere above the level at which mean advection changes from moistening to drying, despite an overall drying effect for <b>the</b> column. <b>The</b> <b>SCMs</b> capture some essence of this moistening at upper levels. A gradual transition from shallow to deep convection is simulated by the CRMs and <b>the</b> wetter <b>SCMs</b> during <b>the</b> transition periods, but the onset of deep convection is delayed in <b>the</b> drier <b>SCMs.</b> This results in lower precipitation rates for these <b>SCMs</b> during <b>the</b> active periods, although much better agreement exists between the models at this time...|$|R
