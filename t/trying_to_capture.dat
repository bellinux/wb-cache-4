5|$|Ginko {{receives}} a letter requesting his presence from Tanyu, a woman infected with a Mushi that demands her {{to write about}} Mushi to expel it. On the way, he meets Koro, a Mushishi who is <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>capture</b> a rainbow-like Mushi. They go {{to the house of}} Tanyu, where her nanny, Tama, says that a white-haired woman told them about the Tokoyami. When Tanyu tried to write about it, she was afflicted by paralysis and gangrene. Ginko then asks to read about the Tokoyami; while he is reading, the Tokoyami from the writings leave them and return to Tanyu, further exacerbating her condition.|$|E
5|$|Like Trollope before him, Pope Hennessy took {{rooms at}} The Shannon Hotel, {{near the river}} and set about <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>capture</b> {{the essence of the}} town which had {{inspired}} Trollope's first novel, The Macdermots of Ballycloran. He proved to be a very popular figure in the town, evidenced {{by the fact that he}} was asked to adjudicate at a local beauty pageant and the horse fair. Pope Hennessy gives particular mention to the Corcoran family, the proprietors of The Shannon Hotel in the 1960s and 1970s, for their help in the production of his work. They sold the hotel in 1977.|$|E
5|$|Donaggio had no {{interest}} in making soundtracks for films at the time, but was introduced to Nicolas Roeg who decided to try him out and asked him to write something for the beginning of the film. Roeg was enthusiastic about the result but the London-based producers were resistant to hiring someone who had no background in films. The film's financiers were pleased with Donaggio's work and overruled the producers. As well as composing the score, Donaggio performed a substantial portion of it himself. The piano pieces were performed by Donaggio, {{despite the fact that he}} was not very accomplished at playing the piano. The piano pieces are usually associated with Christine in the film, and Roeg wanted them to have an innocent sound reminiscent of a little girl learning to play the piano. Donaggio claims that since he was not very good at playing the piano, the pieces had an unsure style to them, perfect for the effect they were <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>capture.</b>|$|E
50|$|As {{part of the}} Groot Desseyn plan, the Dutch West India Company, {{which had}} been founded in 1621, <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>capture</b> Luanda after they had {{captured}} Salvador da Bahia, the capital of Brazil. Under the leadership of Piet Hein, a Dutch fleet <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>capture</b> Luanda in 1624, but failed, because Filips van Zuylen had <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>capture</b> the city {{a few months earlier}} as well, leading the Portuguese to build reinforcements.|$|R

5|$|On 17 September, {{his lunch}} was {{interrupted}} when the British 1st Airborne Division {{dropped into the}} town launching Operation Market Garden, the Allied attempt to capture the bridges on the lower Rhine, Maas and Waal. Model initially thought they were <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>capture</b> him and his staff, but the soon-apparent scale of the assault quickly convinced him otherwise. When he perceived what the Allies' real objective was, he ordered the II SS Panzer Corps into action. The corps, containing the 9th SS Panzer and 10th SS Panzer Divisions refitting after Normandy, had been overlooked by Allied intelligence. Whilst still seriously understrength, it was composed of veterans and was a deadly threat to lightly equipped paratroopers. 9th SS Panzer took on the British at Arnhem, while the 10th moved south to defend the bridge at Nijmegen.|$|E
5|$|Rochester was besieged for {{the third}} time in 1264 during the Second Barons' War (1264–1267). The castle's royal constable, Roger de Leybourne, held Rochester in support of Henry III. Rebel armies led by Simon de Montfort and Gilbert de Clare entered the city and set about <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>capture</b> the castle. Again the castle's {{defenders}} resisted, though this time with a different outcome. After a week, the rebel armies raised the siege in the face of relief from Henry himself. Although the garrison did not surrender, the castle suffered extensive damage that was not repaired until the following century. The castle saw military action for the last time in 1381 when it was captured and ransacked during the Peasants' Revolt. As Rochester Castle fell out of use its materials were reused elsewhere and custodianship relinquished by the Crown. The castle and its grounds were opened to the public in the 1870s as a park. At various points during the 19th and 20thcenturies repairs were carried out. The castle is protected as a GradeI listed building and Scheduled Monument. Today the ruins are in the guardianship of English Heritage and open to the public.|$|E

Speculation about his life and death continues among historians.|$|E
25|$|Regarding the New Catalina schooner, {{captured}} on February 9, 1817: while <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>capture</b> the ship, Almeida confronted the Spanish war brig Fernando VII, despite a clear inferiority in firepower. However, {{in the night}} it was recaptured by the Spanish privateer brig Campedor. Almeida then attacked the Campedor, which eventually withdrew itself. After recovering the New Catalina, Almeida set her ablaze because she was in bad shape after the fight.|$|E
25|$|The {{offensive}} {{began on}} 24 March 2016, near the Makhmur {{area of the}} Nineveh Province. Thousands of Iraqi troops had been deployed there in the previous weeks, setting up bases alongside Kurdish and US forces. While advancing westward toward the oil town of Qayyarah, Iraqi troops {{were reported to have}} recaptured several villages from ISIL, among them Al-Nasr, Garmandi, Kudila and Khurburdan, though it was later revealed that ISIL was still occupying Al-Nasr and the government forces were <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>capture</b> it.|$|E

25|$|In 1410, {{the truce}} expired without the parties having {{been able to}} reach an {{agreement}} on an extension. As a result, the hostilities at sea were resumed. When the winter of 1410–1411 turned out to be so severe that travel across the Zuiderzee was made impossible by ice-drift, the Frisians decided to try {{to make use of the}} situation by <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>capture</b> Staveren (which could not now be resupplied from Holland). In the night of 4 March 1411 some Frisians crossed the frozen moat, climbed the city walls and managed to open the gates to their army. In this way the last Hollandic stronghold in Friesland was retaken.|$|E
25|$|After Magersfontein, Methuen {{remained}} in the Kimberley–Boshof area <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>capture</b> Boer General Christiaan de Wet. Methuen was himself captured by the Boers at Tweebosch on 7 March 1902. He had been wounded in the battle when he broke his leg after his horse fell on him. Boer General Koos de la Rey released him due to the severity of his injuries, providing his personal cart to take Methuen to hospital in Klerksdorp. The two allegedly became lifelong friends {{as a result of}} this action. Following the end of hostilities in early June 1902, he left Cape Town with other invalids and convalescents on board the SS Assaye, arriving in Southampton the following month, still walking with crutches.|$|E
25|$|After the Kauwukah and Rushdi trench systems {{had been}} captured, the 60th (London) Division then turned north at 16:30, with orders to {{establish}} a strong bridgehead across the Wadi es Sheria, {{to the north of}} Sheria. They were to cover the water supply and occupy a line from Barrata to north of the railway. They marched north, towards the strong central point of the Ottoman line, to launch their attack. By 18:00, they were advancing with the 10th (Irish) Division on the railway east of Kh Kauwukah on their left, and the 74th (Yeomanry) Division on their right. The Yeomanry Mounted Division continued the line from the 74th (Yeomanry) Division to the 53rd (Welsh) Division, which had been <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>capture</b> Tel el Khuweilfe during the day.|$|E

25|$|In May 1836, Lovejoy {{decided to}} move with his family across the Mississippi River to Alton, Illinois, where he founded the Alton Observer and served as pastor at Upper Alton Presbyterian Church (now College Avenue Presbyterian Church). Before he could move the press, an angry mob broke into the Observer office and vandalized it. Only Alderman Bryan Mullanphy {{attempted}} to stop the crime, and no policemen or city officials intervened. Lovejoy packed {{what remained of the}} office for shipment to Alton. However, it sat on the riverbank, unguarded, overnight and was destroyed and thrown into the Mississippi River. Although Illinois was a free state, Alton, Illinois was a center for slave catchers <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>capture</b> escaped slaves and for pro-slavery forces. Many escaped slaves crossed the Mississippi River from Missouri, a slave state. Alton had been settled by pro-slavery southerners who thought Alton should not become a haven for escaped slaves.|$|E
25|$|On 22 April, the Surreys, Buffs, West Kents and Argylls dug in, using shallow gullies and {{depressions}} {{wherever they}} could find them in the open ground, {{in preparation for the}} attack. At 8:00 pm the artillery fire of 400 guns, which would last all night, signalled that the battle for Longstop Hill had begun. At 11:30 am the next morning the Surreys and the Argyles advanced but German machine guns and mortars began to inflict casualties on the start line. The 962nd Regiment repulsed the attacks of the West Kents and the Buffs <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>capture</b> Djebel Rhar. This delay had made it impossible for the Argyles to capture the main hills during the hours of darkness. Soon after dawn, Howlett, seeing that his original plan had been too ambitious, went forward and made another plan for the Argyles and the Surreys, supported by the North Irish Horse, to seize the Djebel Ahmera (the western half of Longstop).|$|E
25|$|On {{attempting}} its entrance {{he discovered}} three ships {{up the river}} and {{at the point of}} the land two companies of infantry, who brought their artillery to bear upon him. So he gave up <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>capture</b> the entrance and made for St. Augustine. The three Spanish vessels which took the southerly course in pursuit of the remaining French ship continued the chase all night. Menéndez had ordered them to rejoin him {{at the mouth of the}} St. Johns in the morning, and, if unable to do so, to return to St. Augustine. A storm arose and they were obliged to cast anchor off the coast, the vessels being so small they dared not to take to the sea. One of the three broke away, and while in this peril a French ship was sighted, but it did not attack them, although it hove to within a league of their own ship.|$|E

25|$|Sidestepping Burnside's {{forces that}} {{protected}} Cincinnati {{to the south}} he traveled through such northern communities as Harrison, New Baltimore, Colerain, Springdale, Glendale and Sharonville. Morgan and his men ran into great resistance when <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>capture</b> Camp Dennison. He would eventually retreat and regroup with the other column of his men in Montgomery and went around Camp Dennison through Wards Corner. Morgan continued east to the Ohio River where, just north of modern Ravenswood, West Virginia, there was a ford at Buffington Island {{that would allow him}} to cross over into that state. Burnside correctly guessed Morgan's intentions. Federal columns under Edward H. Hobson and Henry M. Judah and river gunboats swiftly converged to contest any river crossing. Burnside also sent a militia regiment from Marietta, Ohio, to hold the ford until the Federal forces could arrive. Morgan arrived on the evening of July 18, but decided not to attack the militia in the gathering darkness. It proved to be a mistake.|$|E
25|$|The North {{initially}} {{sought a}} quick victory by <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>capture</b> the Confederate capital at Richmond, Virginia, {{not far from}} the U.S. capital at Washington, D.C. The South hoped to win by getting Britain and France to intervene, or else by exhausting the North's willingness to fight. The Confederates under General Robert E. Lee skillfully and tenaciously defended their capital until the very end, while the North struggled to find any general to match. As the fighting between the two capitals stalled, the North found more success in campaigns elsewhere, using rivers, railroads, and the seas to help move and supply their larger forces, putting a stranglehold on the South — the Anaconda Plan. The war spilled across the continent, and even to the high seas. After four years of appallingly bloody conflict, with more casualties than all other U.S. wars combined, the North's larger population and industrial might slowly ground the South down. The resources and economy of the South were ruined, while the North's factories and economy prospered filling government wartime contracts.|$|E
25|$|The next {{objective}} was {{the town of}} Kotelnikovo, an important rail junction where German mobile troops were beginning to arrive. The division rested and replenished its supplies on November 24. On the night of November 25 the division moved westwards in the right flank of the 51st Army. The division was to cover the main forces of the army from the northwest in the attack on Kotelnikovo. Unknown to the Soviet commanders, on this same day the German high command began reorganizing their forces and bringing in armored units for an eventual relief operation towards Stalingrad that would be based from this town. After an advance of 45km {{on the morning of}} November 27, with support of 35 tanks from 85th Tank Brigade but no rifle forces whatsoever, the 81st reached the western and northwestern approaches to Kotelnikovo. The division attacked {{into the heart of the}} town, <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>capture</b> it off the march, and succeeded in routing several Romanian units but then ran into lead elements of 6th Panzer Division's 114th Motorized Infantry Regiment, just unloading after a long journey from France. The panzer troops, along with a unit of Cossack volunteers known as Group Pannwitz, defeated the 81st and drove it westward 10 - 12km into marshland along the Semichnaia River valley near Poklebin.|$|E
