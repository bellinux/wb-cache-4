5|$|The game {{originated}} from the team's wish {{to develop a}} large-scale role-playing game for the DS. Many of the main staff had worked on previous Megami Tensei titles in some capacity, including producer and designer Kazuma Kaneko, director Eiji Ishida, writer Shogo Isogai, and composer Shoji Meguro. The setting in Antarctica was chosen to appeal to an overseas audience. Alongside the new setting, the game featured multiple science fiction elements new to the series, taking inspiration from films such as Damnation Alley and The <b>Thing.</b> <b>For</b> <b>the</b> music, Meguro used grander musical styles than his previous works, incorporating choir music using a special synthesizer. Reception of the game was generally positive for its story and gameplay, but many disliked its first-person navigation. An enhanced port for the Nintendo 3DS, Shin Megami Tensei: Strange Journey Redux, will be released in Japan in 2017, and worldwide in 2018.|$|E

25|$|In {{the first}} couple of decades there was no {{traditional}} marriage in the kibbutz. If a man and woman wanted to get married, they went to the housing office and requested a room together. Not having traditional marriage was seen as a way to dissolve the patriarchy and give women their own standing without depending on a man (economically or socially) and was also viewed as a positive <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> community as a whole, as communal life was the main aspect of the kibbutz.|$|E
25|$|The first {{televised}} {{match was}} between Marc Mero and Leif Cassidy. Mero {{began with a}} quick assault on Cassidy before getting distracted by Sable. Cassidy regrouped and applied the figure four leglock on Mero and also argued with Sable, who was in Mero's corner. Mero tried to do quick attacks on Cassidy but Cassidy managed {{to be on the}} offensive. Sable continued to distract him throughout the match and Cassidy was frustrated of her interferences. He ran before her before Mero hit Cassidy a Wild <b>Thing</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> win.|$|E
25|$|To {{preserve}} the dramatic opening sequences of his films, Lucas wanted the screen credits {{to come at}} the end of the films. While this practice has become more common over the years, this was a highly unusual choice at the time. The Writers and Directors Guilds of America had no problem allowing it on Star Wars, back in 1977, because the writer-director credit (George Lucas) matched the company name, but when Lucas did the same <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> sequel it became an issue because Lucas had his last name on the start of the film (Lucasfilm), while the director and the writers had theirs on the end. They fined him over $250,000 and attempted to pull Empire out of theaters. The DGA also attacked Kershner; to protect his director, Lucas paid all the fines to the guilds. Due to the controversy, he left the Directors and Writers Guilds, and the Motion Picture Association.|$|E

25|$|There {{is nothing}} solid {{left in the}} Players' Protective Association. There has been no {{activity}} {{on the part of}} the present officials, and there will be none. The organization has been allowed to die because the members have seen nothing in it to interest them. Some are not pleased with the officers; others object to the paying of dues, while others still believe that they can do better by themselves than by acting in concert with all the other players; and so the Players' Protective Association gradually is being allowed to die out. One hears but little of it now, and in a year from now will hear less. It would have been a good <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> players if they had been true to its principles and the officials had been active in carrying out all its aims and laws. However, there was failure on all sides, and the result is that the organization gradually is fading out of existence.|$|E
25|$|At {{the later}} conventions, in Adelaide in 1897, in Sydney later {{the same year}} and in Melbourne in early 1898, there were changes to the earlier draft. In Adelaide, {{the name of the}} court was changed from Supreme Court of Australia to High Court of Australia. Many people also opposed the new court {{completely}} replacing the Privy Council: many large businesses, particularly those which were subsidiaries of British companies or regularly traded with the United Kingdom, preferred for business reasons to keep the colonies under the unified jurisdiction of the British courts, and petitioned the conventions to that effect. Other arguments posited against removing Privy Council appeals were that Australian judges were of a poorer quality than English ones, and that without the Council's oversight, the law in the colonies risked becoming different from English law. Some politicians, such as Sir George Dibbs, supported the petitioners, but others, including Alfred Deakin, supported the design of the court as it was. Inglis Clark took the view that the possibility of divergence was a good <b>thing,</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> law could adapt appropriately to Australian circumstances. Despite the debate, the portions of the draft dealing with the court remained largely unchanged, as the delegates focused on different matters.|$|E
500|$|Additional debates {{among the}} {{candidates}} were held, which also drew attention. Former Governor Howard Dean described the debates as a [...] "good <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> state" [...] and Time magazine's Denver Nicks called them a [...] "breath of fresh air" [...] and [...] "pure entertainment". There was a final debate on October 29 {{with just the}} top three candidates: Shumlin, Milne and Feliciano.|$|E

500|$|With word of {{the episode}} out, {{backlash}} began. The studio received at least one bomb threat and Driscoll received a telephone call informing him {{he was going to}} Hell. DeGeneres was followed by car to the studio on at least one occasion by a [...] "suspicious man". Some within the entertainment industry assumed that the coming out was simply a ratings stunt, to which DeGeneres responded, [...] "I did it selfishly for myself and because I {{thought it was a great}} <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> show, which desperately needed a point of view." ...|$|E
500|$|There {{were also}} {{disagreements}} within the NSDAP {{leadership on the}} spiritual implications of cultivating a 'Germanic history' in their ideological program.

500|$|Some of the Senate Ethics Committee {{members were}} {{concerned}} that letting the senators off lightly would harm their own reputations. Nevertheless, the existing Senate rules did not specifically proscribe the actions taken by DeConcini, Riegle, Glenn, and McCain. Vice-chair Rudman defended the committee's actions, saying: [...] "Given the news media frenzy surrounding , the easiest <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> committee to do {{would have been to}} find them guilty of something and recommend sanctions. ... The politically difficult thing, the one requiring backbone, was what we did — to review all the evidence and reach a predictably unpopular conclusion based only on fact." ...|$|E

Though she personally believed that Marlene is a fundamentally [...] "good" [...] person, Dandridge felt that the ambiguous morality of the characters is a significant contributor to the interest in their humanity. Dandridge also appreciated the use of motion capture, comparing it to theater productions.|$|E
500|$|During his lifetime, Agagianian was {{considered}} the Catholic Church's leading expert on communism and the Soviet Union. Norman St John-Stevas wrote 1955 that Agagianian is [...] "uncommitted" [...] in the Cold War. In a January 1958 diplomatic report Marcus Cheke, UK Ambassador to the Holy See, wrote that Agagianian [...] "believes that the best <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Western powers {{to do is to}} hang on, avoid war (and the more strongly armed and united they are, the less danger there is of Russia venturing on a war) and to wait for a transformation inside Russia, which he thinks will happen sooner or later."

500|$|The {{foundation}} of the Glyndebourne Festival in 1934 was another good <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> LSO, as its players made up nearly {{the entirety of the}} festival orchestra. An important additional source of income for the orchestra was the film industry. In March 1935 the LSO recorded Arthur Bliss's incidental music for Alexander Korda's film Things to Come. According to the LSO's website the recording took 14 full orchestral sessions and [...] "started a veritable revolution in film production history.... For the first time, music for the cinema, previously regarded as a lowly art form, captured the attention of classical music scholars and enthusiasts, music critics and the film and music public. The LSO had begun its long historic journey as the premier film orchestra." ...|$|E
500|$|Recording {{began with}} a demo session at a small church in Woodstock, which was not {{intended}} to produce any official releases. During its course Morrison worked on leftover material from his previous two albums (Astral Weeks and Moondance), recorded songs that he had not performed in the studio before ("Crazy Face" [...] and [...] "Give Me a Kiss"), as well as two instrumentals. Limited recording equipment was used, operated by drummer Dahaud Shaar, who was intending to open a recording studio in Woodstock at the time. Shaar remembered: [...] "I found an old church and we would just load in. I'd set up a pair of mikes and we would just run down some tracks with the tapes running. They became like a working <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> album." ...|$|E
500|$|In July 1940, Edward was {{appointed}} Governor of the Bahamas. [...] Edward reportedly told an acquaintance, [...] "After {{the war is}} over and Hitler will crush the Americans... we'll take over...

[...] He was reported as saying that [...] "it would be a tragic <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> world if Hitler was overthrown". Comments like these reinforced the belief that the Duke and Duchess held Nazi sympathies and the effect of the abdication crisis of 1936 was to force off the throne a man with extreme political opinions. Claims that Edward would have been a threat or that he was removed by a political conspiracy to dethrone him remain speculative and [...] "persist largely because since 1936 the contemporary public considerations have lost most of their force and so seem, wrongly, to provide insufficient explanation for the King's departure".|$|E
