The new House of Commons had more Conservative than Whig members, but the depth of the Tory schism enabled Russell to continue <b>to</b> <b>govern.</b> <b>The</b> Conservatives were led by Bentinck in the Commons and Stanley in the Lords.|$|E

5|$|Throughout {{the period}} of {{absolute}} monarchy, from 1782 to 1932, the Grand Palace was both the country's administrative and religious centre.

The palace's high whitewashed castellated walls and extensive forts and guard posts mirrored those of the walls of Bangkok itself, and thus the Grand Palace was envisioned as a city within a city. For this reason a special set of Palace Laws were created <b>to</b> <b>govern</b> <b>the</b> inhabitants and to establish hierarchy and order.|$|E

The chronicle's account could be evidence that, by about 1096, Lǫgmaðr faced a faction formed around his younger brother; and that, when this faction was unable to topple Lǫgmaðr by itself, it approached Ua Briain for assistance in placing Óláfr upon the throne.|$|E
