25|$|At the {{temperatures}} and densities in stellar cores {{the rates of}} fusion reactions are notoriously slow. For example, at solar core temperature (T ≈ 15MK) and density (160g/cm3), the energy release rate is only 276μW/cm3—about {{a quarter of the}} volumetric rate at which a resting human body generates heat. Thus, reproduction of stellar core conditions in a lab for nuclear fusion power production is completely impractical. Because nuclear reaction rates depend on density as well as temperature and most fusion schemes operate at relatively low densities, <b>those</b> <b>methods</b> are strongly dependent on higher temperatures. The fusion rate as a function of temperature (exp(−E/kT)), leads to the need to achieve temperatures in terrestrial reactors 10–100 times higher temperatures than in stellar interiors: T ≈ 0.1–1.0×109 K.|$|E

2500|$|Description: The methods {{described}} in this paper were opposite to and more complicated than other methods used by contemporary investigators. However, Foot and Strobell found <b>those</b> <b>methods</b> to be insufficient for their studies, possibly because they imbedded only a single row of eggs in each block and use less fixing and hardening.
