The essay is a postcolonial feminist search for the past, attempting at translating it to the present, and pondering on who the author, with this {{new knowledge}}, her self actually is. Or want to be. It is a reflection over what parts of her past that has been <b>hidden</b> <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> why it was concealed, and what those acts, by other people – contributing <b>to</b> <b>hiding</b> <b>her</b> past - means to her, today, for her academic research on large scale hydropower exploitations in Sápmi, Sweden...|$|R

5|$|The {{attitude}} toward the Chinese language was contradictory. In Teishi's court, Chinese had been flaunted and considered a symbol of imperial rule and superiority. Yet, in Shōshi's salon {{there was a great}} deal of hostility towards the language—perhaps owing to political expedience during a period when Chinese began to be rejected in favor of Japanese—even though Shōshi herself was a student of the language. The hostility may have affected Murasaki and her opinion of the court, and forced her <b>to</b> <b>hide</b> <b>her</b> knowledge of Chinese. Unlike Shōnagon, who was both ostentatious and flirtatious, as well as outspoken about her knowledge of Chinese, Murasaki seems to have been humble, an attitude which possibly impressed Michinaga. Although Murasaki used Chinese and incorporated it in her writing, she publicly rejected the language, a commendable attitude during a period of burgeoning Japanese culture.|$|E
