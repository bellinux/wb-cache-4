5|$|Thomas Grainger was the {{engineer}} for {{the line and}} James Bray the contractor. Two sighting towers were erected and 20 shafts sunk along the tunnel's line. Men excavated rock from the shaft faces until <b>the</b> <b>shafts</b> were connected and the tunnel was completed in 1848. Thousands of navvies lived locally in temporary bothies with their families, and worked in dangerous and wet conditions to facilitate the grand opening in 1849.|$|E
5|$|After {{the station}} was closed it was almost {{immediately}} modified. The western headwalls of both platform tunnels were rebuilt to allow a step plate junction to be installed, providing access from the eastbound and westbound tunnels to a new siding located between Down Street and Hyde Park Corner. The siding is mainly used to reverse westbound trains, but {{could also be used}} for servicing trains. The siding tunnel is accessible at its western end through a small foot tunnel constructed from Hyde Park Corner station. The lifts were removed and <b>the</b> <b>shafts</b> adapted to provide additional tunnel ventilation.|$|E
5|$|The double finial minaret {{was built}} in 1509 by Qansah al-Ghuri. Sitting on a square base, the first shaft is octagonal, and four sides have a {{decorative}} keel arch, separated from the adjacent sides with two columns. The second shaft, is a 12 - sided polygon separated from the first by a fretted balconies supported by muqarnas is decorated with blue faience. A balcony separates the third level from the second shaft. The third level {{is made up of}} two rectangular shafts with horseshoe arches on each side of both shafts. Atop each of these two shafts rests a finial atop two identical onion shaped bulbs, with a balcony separating the finials from <b>the</b> <b>shafts.</b>|$|E
50|$|The dating of {{this ritual}} event {{is based upon}} ceramic {{comparative}} analysis, two radiocarbon samples from within <b>the</b> <b>shaft</b> and two radiocarbon samples from the area around <b>the</b> <b>shaft</b> which was excavated to accommodate <b>the</b> <b>shaft</b> and then refilled. Dos Arroyos Orange-Polychromes associated with <b>the</b> <b>shaft</b> and other Manik ceramic complex (Tikal) material fix a date of approximately AD 250-550. In addition, a few Teotihuacan sherds were found in <b>the</b> <b>shaft.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 2016, a rules {{clarification}} {{was made}} by the NCAA Men’s Lacrosse Rules Committee. Questions have arisen regarding the alteration of <b>the</b> <b>shaft</b> circumference. <b>The</b> circumference of <b>the</b> <b>shaft</b> cannot exceed 3 1/2". To be clear, added tape to <b>the</b> <b>shaft</b> must not make <b>the</b> <b>shaft</b> exceed this circumference measurement.|$|R
50|$|The {{shear stress}} in <b>the</b> <b>shaft</b> may be {{resolved}} into principal stresses via Mohr's circle. If <b>the</b> <b>shaft</b> is loaded only in torsion, {{then one of}} the principal stresses will be in tension and the other in compression. These stresses are oriented at a 45-degree helical angle around <b>the</b> <b>shaft.</b> If <b>the</b> <b>shaft</b> is made of brittle material, then <b>the</b> <b>shaft</b> will fail by a crack initiating at the surface and propagating through to the core of <b>the</b> <b>shaft,</b> fracturing in a 45-degree angle helical shape. This is often demonstrated by twisting a piece of blackboard chalk between one's fingers.|$|R
5|$|The west façade of {{the castle}} has square towers {{flanking}} the central bay, with others at the south west and north west, all topped with octagonal, machicolated turrets. The north and south façades are relatively simple. The east façade has a central projection in the centre rising a storey above the parapet, to form a tower. The tower's south angle is splayed to accommodate the main staircase and only the corbels of its parapet survive. The screen closing off the east entrance has a three-bay cusped arcade {{on the ground floor}} and three ogee arches on <b>the</b> <b>shafts</b> above.|$|E
5|$|Dinheirosaurus is {{not known}} well from non-vertebral material, {{currently}} only consisting of partial ribs and a fragment of a pelvis. One of the ribs attached to the cervicals, and is quite fragmentary. It is elongated, although {{that might be a}} feature of distortion. Also undescribed by Bonaparte & Mateus are a set of thoratic ribs. Two ribs are from {{the left side of the}} animal. They are T-shaped in cross section, and display plesiomorphic features, although their incomplete state makes their identification uncertain. Multiple right ribs are preserved, including both <b>the</b> <b>shafts</b> and heads. They are similar to the left ribs, which also show that they lack pneumtization. Other appendicular (non-vertebral) material includes a very incomplete and fragmentary shaft of the pubis, and over one hundred gastroliths. The pubis displays practically no anatomical features, and the gastroliths were not described in detail by Mannion et al. in 2012.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the nine}} {{underground}} tests that were carried between 1962 and 1969, {{the last one}} was {{the most powerful and}} had the highest yield of transuranium elements. Milligrams of einsteinium that would normally take a year of irradiation in a high-power reactor, were produced within a microsecond. However, the major practical problem of the entire proposal was collecting the radioactive debris dispersed by the powerful blast. Aircraft filters adsorbed only about 4 of the total amount, and collection of tons of corals at Enewetak Atoll increased this fraction by only two orders of magnitude. Extraction of about 500 kilograms of underground rocks 60 days after the Hutch explosion recovered only about 1 of the total charge. The amount of transuranium elements in this 500-kg batch was only 30 times higher than in a 0.4 kg rock picked up 7 days after the test which demonstrated the highly non-linear dependence of the transuranium elements yield on the amount of retrieved radioactive rock. Shafts were drilled at the site before the test in order to accelerate sample collection after explosion, so that explosion would expel radioactive material from the epicenter through <b>the</b> <b>shafts</b> and to collecting volumes near the surface. This method was tried in two tests and instantly provided hundreds kilograms of material, but with actinide concentration 3 times lower than in samples obtained after drilling. Whereas such method could have been efficient in scientific studies of short-lived isotopes, it could not improve the overall collection efficiency of the produced actinides.|$|E

40|$|An {{actuator}} mechanism is described, having a frame with a rotatable <b>shaft</b> supported in <b>the</b> frame, a positioning mechanism coupled to <b>the</b> <b>shaft</b> for rotating <b>the</b> <b>shaft</b> in two rotary positions, disposed approximately 180 degrees apart, {{and a pair}} of plungers coupled to <b>the</b> <b>shaft.</b> Each plunger is responsive to a control signal for applying bi-directional rotation to <b>the</b> <b>shaft...</b>|$|R
5|$|Apart from {{stimulating}} {{the development of}} urban areas, temples and religious buildings featured a number of unique aesthetic and structural features. The Temple of the Saintly Mother (圣母殿) and the Hall of Sacrifice of the Jin Temple (晋祠), located in a southeastern suburb of Taiyuan City, Shanxi province, are extant examples of early Song architecture. The Temple of the Saintly Mother is the main building of the Jin Temple, first built in the period between 1023 and 1032 and renovated in 1102. It has a double-eaved roof with nine ridges, and two dragon-heads with wide-open jaws biting {{the ends of the}} main ridge. The roof is supported by massive dougong brackets corresponding to drawings in Yingzao Fashi. The eaves of the Temple of the Saintly Mother curve upward slightly at each end, a characteristic of Song architecture. The columns of the façade, decorated with dragons that coil around <b>the</b> <b>shafts,</b> become progressively taller with increasing distance to either side of the central pair. The building has a porch around it, the sole example of such a structure; another unique feature of the site is a cross-shaped bridge that leads to the Goddess Temple.|$|E
5|$|Strand {{station was}} built {{on the site of the}} Royal Strand Theatre, which had closed on 13 May 1905 and been demolished. Construction of the station began on 21 October 1905, to a design by the UERL's {{architect}} Leslie Green in the UERL house style of a two-storey steel-framed building faced with red glazed terracotta blocks, with wide semi-circular windows on the upper floor. The station building is L-shaped, with two façades separated by the building on the corner of Strand and Surrey Street. The Strand façade is narrow with a single semi-circular window above the entrance. The façade in Surrey Street is wider with a separate entrance and exit and a shop unit. In anticipation of a revival of the extension to Waterloo and the City route, the station was built with three circular lift shafts able to accommodate six trapezium-shaped lifts. Only one of <b>the</b> <b>shafts</b> was fitted out, with two lifts. The other two shafts rose from the lower concourse to the basement of the station, but could have been extended upwards into the space of the shop unit when required. A fourth smaller-diameter shaft accommodated an emergency spiral stair.|$|E
5|$|The {{neck of the}} emu is {{pale blue}} and shows through its sparse {{feathers}}. They have grey-brown plumage of shaggy appearance; <b>the</b> <b>shafts</b> and {{the tips of the}} feathers are black. Solar radiation is absorbed by the tips, and the inner plumage insulates the skin. This prevents the birds from overheating, allowing them to be active during the heat of the day. A unique feature of the emu feather is the double rachis emerging from a single shaft. Both of the rachis have the same length, and the texture is variable; the area near the skin is rather furry, but the more distant ends resemble grass. The sexes are similar in appearance, although the male's penis can become visible when he urinates and defecates. The plumage varies in colour due to environmental factors, giving the bird a natural camouflage. Feathers of emus in more arid areas with red soils have a rufous tint while birds residing in damp conditions are generally darker in hue. The juvenile plumage develops at about three months and is blackish finely barred with brown, with the head and neck being especially dark. The facial feathers gradually thin to expose the bluish skin. The adult plumage has developed by about fifteen months.|$|E

5|$|Various {{distinguishing}} {{traits of}} the lower jaw have been established. The longitudinal groove on the outer surface of the dentary is wide. The third tooth socket of the dentary is not enlarged. Seen from above, the dentary is straight without an expanded jaw tip. The interdental plates, reinforcing the teeth from behind, {{of the lower}} jaw are tall. Benson also concluded it would be most parsimonious {{to assume that the}} Stonesfield Slate material represents a single species. If so, several additional distinctive traits can be observed {{in other parts of the}} skeleton. The low vertical ridge on the outer side of the ilium, above the hip joint, shows parallel vertical grooves. The bony skirts between <b>the</b> <b>shafts</b> of the ischia are thick and touch each other forming an almost flat surface. There is a boss present on the lower outer side of the ischium shaft with a rough surface. The underside of the second sacral vertebra has an angular longitudinal keel. A ridge on the upper side of the third metatarsal connected to a groove in the side of the second metatarsal. The middle of the front edge of the scapula forms a thin crest.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the nine}} {{underground}} tests, which were carried between 1962 and 1969 and codenamed Anacostia (5.2 kilotons, 1962), Kennebec (<5 kilotons, 1963), Par (38, kilotons, 1964), Barbel (<20 kilotons, 1964), Tweed (<20 kilotons, 1965), Cyclamen (13 kilotons, 1966), Kankakee (20-200 kilotons, 1966), Vulcan (25 kilotons, 1966) and Hutch (20-200 kilotons, 1969), {{the last one}} was most powerful and had the highest yield of transuranium elements. In the dependence on the atomic mass number, the yield showed a saw-tooth behavior with the lower values for odd isotopes, due to their higher fission rates. The major practical problem of the entire proposal was however collecting the radioactive debris dispersed by the powerful blast. Aircraft filters adsorbed only about 4 of the total amount and collection of tons of corals at Enewetak Atoll increased this fraction by only two orders of magnitude. Extraction of about 500 kilograms of underground rocks 60 days after the Hutch explosion recovered only about 10−7 of the total charge. The amount of transuranium elements in this 500-kg batch was only 30 times higher than in a 0.4 kg rock picked up 7 days after the test.

25|$|The {{two most}} common {{factory-installed}} locking differentials use either a computer-controlled multi-plate clutch or viscous coupling unit to join <b>the</b> <b>shafts,</b> while other differentials {{more commonly used}} on off-road vehicles generally use manually operated locking devices. In the multi-plate clutch the vehicle's computer senses slippage and locks <b>the</b> <b>shafts,</b> causing a small jolt when it activates, which can disturb the driver or cause additional traction loss. In the viscous coupling differentials the shear stress of high shaft speed differences causes a dilatant fluid in the differential to become solid, linking the two shafts. This design suffers from fluid degradation with age and from exponential locking behavior. Some designs use gearing to create a small rotational difference that hastens torque transfer.|$|E
