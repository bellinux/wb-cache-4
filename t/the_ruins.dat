5|$|The first European {{visitor to}} publish {{an account of}} Quiriguá was English {{architect}} and artist Frederick Catherwood, who reached <b>the</b> <b>ruins</b> in 1840.

The elder Payés had recently died and passed the land to his sons and, since neither Meiney nor Payés' sons had visited the land containing <b>the</b> <b>ruins,</b> they invited John Lloyd Stephens and Catherwood to join them on their {{first trip to the}} site. Stephens had other duties to attend to, but Catherwood was able to accompany the Payés brothers to Quiriguá.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>ruins</b> of Iximche {{were first}} {{described}} by a Guatemalan historian in the late 17th century.

In 1980, during the Guatemalan Civil War, a meeting took place at <b>the</b> <b>ruins</b> between guerillas and Maya leaders {{that resulted in the}} guerillas stating that they would defend indigenous rights.

40|$|This diploma thesis {{deals with}} risk processes. It {{describes}} a classical risk process and mentions <b>the</b> <b>ruin</b> probability.

Afterwards, a risk process with random income is studied and a convolution formula for such a process is derived. In an example, the classical risk process is taken as a specic type of the risk process with random income. For such a process, <b>the</b> <b>ruin</b> probability computed by the convolution formula for classical risk process is compared to <b>the</b> <b>ruin</b> probability computed by the convolution formula for the risk process with random income.
