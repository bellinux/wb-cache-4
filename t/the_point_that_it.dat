5|$|Reversible/irreversible pulpitis is a {{distinct}} concept from whether the tooth is restorable or unrestorable, e.g. a tooth may only have reversible pulpitis, but has been structurally weakened by decay or trauma to <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is impossible to restore the tooth in the long term.|$|E
5|$|In {{the ninth}} century, Hrabanus Maurus and Ratramnus also defended Augustine's view of non{{metabolic}} real presence. During {{the high and}} late Middle Ages, the metabolic view became increasingly dominant {{to the exclusion of}} the nonmetabolic view, to <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was considered the only orthodox option. The doctrine of transubstantiation was developed in the high Middle Ages to explain the change of the elements into Christ's body and blood. Transubstantiation is the belief that the Eucharistic elements are transformed into Christ's body and blood in a way only perceivable by the intellect, not by the senses.|$|E
5|$|Initial {{funding for}} the {{development}} of Escape from Woomera came from the Australian government's arts funding organisation, the Australia Council for the Arts. The Australia Council gave the developers AUD $25,000, intended to get the game developed to <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> could secure funding from other sources. While a playable section of the game was developed, the developers never received additional funding. The playable demo, which was built as a modification of the video game Half-Life, was made available for download on the game's website.|$|E

5|$|For centuries, {{tracheotomy}} {{was considered}} the only reliable method for intubation of the trachea. However, because {{only a minority of}} patients survived the operation, physicians undertook tracheotomy only as a last resort, on patients who were nearly dead. It was not until the late 19th century however that advances in understanding of anatomy and physiology, as well an appreciation of the germ theory of disease, had improved the outcome of this operation to <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> could be considered an acceptable treatment option. Also at that time, advances in endoscopic instrumentation had improved {{to such a degree that}} direct laryngoscopy had become a viable means to secure the airway by the non-surgical orotracheal route. By the mid-20th century, the tracheotomy as well as endoscopy and non-surgical tracheal intubation had evolved from rarely employed procedures to becoming essential components of the practices of anesthesiology, critical care medicine, emergency medicine, and laryngology.|$|E
5|$|Simulations suggest that, {{while the}} disk had a {{relatively}} high mass at any given moment, over time a substantial fraction (several tenths of a percent) {{of the mass of}} Jupiter captured from the Solar nebula was processed through it. However, the disk mass of only 2% that of Jupiter is required to explain the existing satellites. Thus there may have been several generations of Galilean-mass satellites in Jupiter's early history. Each generation of moons would have spiraled into Jupiter, due to drag from the disk, with new moons then forming from the new debris captured from the Solar nebula. By the time the present (possibly fifth) generation formed, the disk had thinned out to <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> no longer greatly interfered with the moons' orbits. The current Galilean moons were still affected, falling into and being partially protected by an orbital resonance which still exists for Io, Europa, and Ganymede. Ganymede's larger mass means that it would have migrated inward at a faster rate than Europa or Io.|$|E

40|$|Deduction by a {{computer}} studied {{so far has been}} cen-tered around symbolic reasoning with formulas. Re-cently, attention has been directed to reasoning with diagrams as well, in order to augment the deficiency of reasoning with symbols only. In this paper, we pro-pose a hybrid reasoning system with diagrams and sen-tences, called JVenn, having perspicuity of diagrams and strictness of symbols complementarily. JVenn is unique particularly in <b>the</b> <b>points</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> has <b>the</b> strategy for proving a chain of syllogisms, allows for an inter-play between diagrams and symbols, and guides reason-ing with the beauty measure for diagrams. ...|$|R
