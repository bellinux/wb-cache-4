25|$|In October 1886 {{her oldest}} sister, Marie, entered the same Carmelite monastery, adding to Thérèse's grief. The warm {{atmosphere}} at Les Buissonnets, so necessary to her, was disappearing.

500|$|When she {{returned}} in 2004, Nina {{was no longer}} shy and vulnerable. She had taken control {{of her life and}} became more assured. Goodrem welcomed her character's development and said Nina came back strong and confident. She also said: [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> to grow up. If she didn't come back a little bit older and wiser, then she wouldn't have learnt and grown from what's gone on in the year that she's been missing." ...|$|E
500|$|Following pleas from Brown {{to resurrect}} Nick, John Altman {{returned}} to the serial again in December 2008, in a storyline that saw Nick attempt to con Dot again, this time aided by a previously unheard of daughter, Dotty (Molly Conlin). [...] Altman explained: [...] "Nick needed something, because I think if he didn’t have little Dotty, for him to walk through that door, she would just have treated him as a complete outcast." [...] As the storyline progressed, {{it was revealed that}} Nick and Dotty had intentions to kill Dot for her inheritance; they concocted a plan to make her <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> developed dementia then overdose her with sleeping pills, which fails when Dotty has a change of heart and Nick flees once again after causing an explosion and being disowned by Dot.|$|E

500|$|Walton {{said that}} [...] "Jill is {{attracted}} to powerful men" [...] {{but is a}} [...] "bossy little lady" [...] who isn't going to [...] "buckle under" [...] to them. She romanced many of Katherine's husbands, including Rex Sterling (Quinn Redeker). Walton said that their romance was [...] "great" [...] but [...] "he only {{fell in love with}} her because the real Katherine had been spirited away and a fake Katherine was in her place". Walton described Jill's romance Sean Bridges (David Lee Russek), who was a young web designer, as a [...] "boy toy". Jill is known for infidelity, Nekeeta Borden of Zap2it noted that she has slept with Katherine's husbands and had an affair with Jack Abbott (Peter Bergman) while she was married to his own father, John Abbott (Jerry Doulgas). Former head writer Kay Alden called her affair with Jack [...] "massive" [...] and it was [...] "devastating to both of them" [...] when it broke up her marriage to John. Lydna Hirsch of Sun Sentinel noted that after the affair, John threw Jack out of the house and divorced Jill; he forgave them years later but it took [...] "Jack being paralyzed and Jill dealing with the death of her son Philip to get him to come around". Several years later, Walton said that John was one of the character's [...] "best matches" [...] because [...] "Jill had a real love and respect for him – I just don't <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> the physical passion for him so she got restless." [...] Of her relationship with ex-con Larry Warton (Shark Fralick), Walton said: [...] "Larry Warton was hilarious; he was really, really fun. I loved doing that, because that was almost all comedy, all the time." ...|$|E

2500|$|There {{was also}} mental illness in Charles's family. His ancestor, Queen Joanna, {{was said to}} have become insane early in life, and became known as [...] "Joanna the Mad".

2500|$|The fourth {{recurring}} theme {{is a piece}} of news concerning the castaways arriving from the outside world that causes discord among them. Then, a second piece of news arrives that says the first was incorrect. An exception to the latter part of this statement is the episode [...] "The Postman Cometh", where Gilligan and the Skipper hear over the radio that Mary Ann's boyfriend eloped and the three single men try to cheer her up by wooing her; Mary Ann actually lied about having a boyfriend, and she created a romance with [...] "a real creep" [...] so that the others would <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> someone waiting for her back home.|$|E

2500|$|Years {{of alcohol}} abuse {{alongside}} copious amounts of medications, initially for arthritic pain and later insomnia, took {{their toll on}} Piaf's health. A series of car accidents only exacerbated her addictions and she eventually underwent a series of surgeries for a stomach ulcer in 1959. Coupled with a deteriorating liver {{and the need for}} a blood transfusion, by 1962 she had lost a significant amount of weight, reaching a low of 30kg (66 pounds). Drifting {{in and out of consciousness}} for several months, she died of liver cancer at age 47 at her villa in Plascassier (Grasse), on the French Riviera, on 10 October 1963, the day before filmmaker and friend Jean Cocteau died. Her last words were [...] "Every damn thing you do in this life, you have to pay for." [...] It is said that Sarapo drove her body back to Paris secretly so that fans would <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> died in her hometown. She is buried in Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris next to her daughter Marcelle, where her grave is among the most visited. Buried in the same grave are her father, Louis-Alphonse Gassion, and Théo (Lamboukas) Sarapo. The name inscribed at the foot of the tombstone is Famille Gassion-Piaf. Her name is engraved on the side as Madame Lamboukas dite Édith Piaf.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{the story}} of a {{frustrated}} passion for Baron von Bleichröder has gained traction in newspapers and history books, at least one book described an entirely different story. [...] In Secrets of Dethroned Royalty by Princess Catherine Radziwill (1920), it is explained that Sophie, required by her family's financial circumstances to live in the university town of Heidelberg instead of the metropolis of Weimar, had fallen deeply in love with a young man (identified only as [...] "Count T.") of excellent but poor family. [...] The two young people planned to elope and to conceal their plans, the princess pretended to carry on a romance instead with one of her sweetheart's friends, Baron von Bleichröder, [...] "who consented with alacrity to play the part ... for he was flattered by the request to appear before the world as a suitor for the hand of a Princess of Weimar." [...] However, Prince William and Princess Gerta intended on another match (presumably more prosperous) for their daughter, and they persuaded Count T to leave Heidelberg. [...] Count T secretly arranged to continue to exchange love letters with Sophie using Bleichröder as intermediary. [...] However after the passage of time the Count, living in another city, found an heiress to his liking, and married her. [...] Apparently he had not bothered to notify Sophie of these changes in his feelings and she discovered these developments only by reading of his marriage in a newspaper; she was so distraught that she killed herself that night. [...] It was widely but erroneously believed that she was driven to suicide by the presumed opposition of her parents to Bleichröder, who, for his part, did not attempt to correct that impression [...] "with evident satisfaction [...] the prestige he derived from his position as the man for whose sake a Royal Princess had shot herself. [...] This awful catastrophe ... was for the Hebrew banker's son, merely a triumph of vanity, and he was glad to allow the world to <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> died for him." [...] This version has not received any currency, although a different story, to the effect that the Princess had previously been carrying on a doomed romance with a Lt. Edler Herr von Putlitz, has circulated. [...] The romance was doomed because although von Putlitz came from a family as aristocratic as that of the Princess, he was just as poor as her father. However, Lt. von Putlitz had died (possibly by suicide) in 1908.|$|E

They've gone down to see an old lady, Lady St. Dunstans, who never comes to London now and who, you know--she's tremendously old--was papa's godmother. It's not very lively for Grace, but Grace is such a dear she'll do {{anything}} for mamma.
