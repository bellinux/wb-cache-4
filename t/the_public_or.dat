5|$|In some jurisdictions, asexuals have legal protections. While Brazil bans since 1999 {{whatever}} pathologization or attempted {{treatment of}} sexual orientation by mental health professionals through the national ethical code, the U.S. state of New York has labeled asexuals as a protected class. However, asexuality does not typically {{attract the attention of}} <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>or</b> major scrutiny; therefore, it has not been the subject of legislation as much as other sexual orientations have.|$|E

5|$|Charitable trusts in English law are {{a form of}} {{express trust}} {{dedicated}} to charitable goals. There {{are a variety of}} advantages to charitable trust status, including exception from most forms of tax and freedom for the trustees not found in other types of English trust. To be a valid charitable trust, the organisation must demonstrate both a charitable purpose and a public benefit. Applicable charitable purposes are normally divided into categories for public benefit including the relief of poverty, the promotion of education, the advancement of health and saving of lives, promotion of religion and all other types of trust recognised by the law. There is also a requirement that the trust's purposes benefit <b>the</b> <b>public</b> (<b>or</b> some section of the public), and not simply a group of private individuals.|$|E
5|$|Derogatory {{treatment}} {{must also}} have occurred in circumstances where the author {{has the right to}} be protected from it. The right to object to such treatment does not exist simply to protect damage, mutilation or the author's reputation. For literary, dramatic or musical works, the author is protected from derogatory treatment if the treatment is published commercially, performed in public or communicated to the public; he is also protected when a film or sound recording including the derogatory treatment is publicly issued. If the work is an artistic one, the author can sue when the derogatory treatment is commercially published or publicly exhibited, or when someone publicly shows a film or sound recording of the treatment. For films, the author is protected when the derogatory treatment is shown or communicated to <b>the</b> <b>public,</b> <b>or</b> when copies of it are issued to the public.|$|E

5|$|Human Rights Watch, {{in their}} 2008 report on Saudi Arabian {{criminal}} justice system, {{noted that the}} criminal procedure code introduced in 2002 lacked some basic protections but, as mentioned above, had been ignored by judges in any case. Those arrested are often not informed {{of the crime of}} which they are accused or given access to a lawyer and are subject to abusive treatment and torture if they do not confess. At trial, there is a presumption of guilt and the accused is often unable to examine witnesses and evidence or present a legal defense. Most trials are held in secret, that is, without <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>or</b> press. The physical punishments imposed by Saudi courts, such as beheading, stoning, amputation and lashing, and the number of executions have also been strongly criticized.|$|E
5|$|Presidential {{elections}} in Singapore, {{in which the}} President of Singapore is directly elected by popular vote, were introduced through amendments to the Constitution of Singapore in 1991. Potential candidates for office have to fulfil stringent qualifications {{set out in the}} Constitution. Certificates of eligibility are issued by the Presidential Elections Committee (PEC). In particular, the PEC must assess that they are persons of integrity, good character and reputation; and if they have not previously held certain key government appointments or were the chief executives of profitable companies with shareholders' equity of an average of S$500 million for the most recent three years in that office, they must demonstrate to the PEC that they held a position of comparable seniority and responsibility in <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>or</b> private sector that has given them experience and ability in administering and managing financial affairs. The general strictness of the required qualifications led to the walkovers in 3 out of 5 of the presidential elections, as presidents S. R. Nathan and Halimah Yacob were the sole candidates to receive a certificate of eligibility from the PEC in their respective years in the 1999, 2005 and 2017 elections. The stringent criteria, the transparency of the PEC's decision-making process and the practice of political parties endorsing candidates have drawn criticism.|$|E
5|$|Through Steamworks, Steam {{provides}} a means of server browsing for multiplayer games that use the Steam Community features, allowing users to create lobbies with friends or members of common groups. Steamworks also provides Valve Anti-Cheat (VAC), Valve's proprietary anti-cheat system; game servers automatically detect and report users who are using cheats in online, multiplayer games. In August 2012, Valve added new featuresincluding dedicated hub pages for games that highlight the best user-created content, top forum posts, and screenshotsto the Community area. In December 2012, a feature called Game Guides, where users can upload text and images detailing games and game strategies {{in the same manner}} as GameFAQs was added. Starting in beta in December 2014 and publicly released in January 2015, the Steam client allows players to broadcast video streams to <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>or</b> Steam friends while playing video games.|$|E

5|$|During {{its annual}} session in 2000, the WMO/ESCAP Panel on North Indian Tropical Cyclones agreed in {{principle}} to start assigning names to cyclonic storms that developed within the North Indian Ocean. As a result of this, the panel requested that each member country submit a list of ten names to a rapporteur {{by the end of}} 2000. At the 2001 session, the rapporteur reported that of the eight countries involved, only India had refused to submit a list of names, as it had some reservations about assigning names to tropical cyclones. The panel then studied the names and felt that some of the names would not be appealing to <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>or</b> the media and thus requested that members submit new lists of names. During 2002 the rapporteur reported {{that there had been a}} poor response by member countries in resubmitting their lists of names. Over the next year, each country except India submitted a fresh list. By the 2004 session, India had still not submitted its list despite promising to do so. However, the rapporteur presented the lists of names that would be used with a gap left for India's names. The rapporteur also recommended that the naming lists be used on an experimental basis during the season, starting in May or June 2004. The naming lists were then completed in May 2004, after India submitted their names. However, the lists were not used until September 2004, when the first tropical cyclone was named Onil by the India Meteorological Department (IMD).|$|E
