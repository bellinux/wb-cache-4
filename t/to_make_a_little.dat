5|$|In {{the present}} day, during {{a night out}} with Dr. Whale (David Anders), Mary Margaret (Goodwin) tries <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> {{conversation}} with him; however, he is busy ogling Ruby (Meghan Ory), prompting Mary Margaret to leave the cafe by herself. As she walks back to her apartment, she notices Emma Swan (Jennifer Morrison) in her car reading a newspaper and searching {{for a place to}} stay. Mary Margaret offers Emma a spare room at her apartment. The following day, Mary Margaret notices Henry (Jared S. Gilmore) looking at the comatose John Doe (Dallas) while they are setting up decorations at the hospital. Henry believes that John Doe is Prince Charming and Mary Margaret is Snow White. Henry asks her to read to Charming from the storybook, convinced that it will wake him up. Emma persuades Mary Margaret to go along with Henry's wishes so that they can prove the stories aren't real. At the hospital, Mary Margaret reads the stories to the patient, until his hand grabs hers, shocking Mary Margaret. She tells Dr. Whale that Charming might be waking up, but the doctor does not believe her. After she leaves, Dr. Whale calls Regina (Parrilla), as he had been instructed to do should there be a change in John Doe's state, revealing that he had been lying to Mary Margaret.|$|E
25|$|Since German {{universities}} do {{not offer}} accommodation or meals, {{students are expected to}} organize and pay for board and lodging themselves. Inexpensive places in dormitories are available from Studentenwerk, a statutory non-profit organization for student affairs. However, there are only enough places for a fraction of students. Studentenwerk also runs canteens and cafés on campus, which are similarly affordable. Other common housing options include renting a private room or apartment as well as living together with one or more roommates to form a Wohngemeinschaft (often abbreviated WG). Furthermore, many university students continue to live with their parents. One third to one half of the students works <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> extra money, often resulting in a longer stay at university.|$|E

25|$|<b>To</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> {{extra money}} beyond what his pension and {{scripting}} earnings brought in, Barks started doing oil paintings {{to sell at}} the local art shows where he and Garé exhibited. Subjects included humorous depictions {{of life on the}} farm and portraits of Native American princesses. These skillfully rendered paintings encouraged fan Glenn Bray to ask Barks if he could commission a painting of the ducks ("A Tall Ship and a Star to Steer Her By", taken from the cover of Walt Disney's Comics and Stories #108 by Barks). This prompted Barks to contact George Sherman at Disney's Publications Department to request permission to produce and sell oil paintings of scenes from his stories. In July 1971 Barks was granted a royalty-free license by Disney. When word spread that Barks was taking commissions from those interested in purchasing an oil of the ducks, much to his astonishment the response quickly outstripped what he reasonably could produce in the next few years.|$|E
500|$|Dan the Automator {{criticized the}} release, stating [...] "That wasn't a Dr. Octagon record. Dr. Octagon is me, Kool Keith, and Q-Bert. The label didn't have {{the legal right}} to use the name, but I didn't want to get {{involved}} in a legal battle...Keith's my man, just trying <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit of money." [...] KutMasta Kurt stated that Thornton was reluctant to perform songs from the album, because the lyrics did not fit the music. John Lindland, who coproduced the final album under the name One-Watt Sun, stated in defense of the album, [...] "People say it's a fake. We don't have that feeling. We think that those are great tracks. It wasn't about remixing anything. They were our ideas, and Keith went on grooves that we sent to LA." [...] In response to Fanatik J's criticism of the album, One Watt Sun referred to him as being disgruntled {{as a result of the}} label discarding his music. According to Lindland, [...] "If we were him, we'd have [...] beef too".|$|E
500|$|Thematically, {{although}} the series focused heavily on alien abduction lore, {{the decision was}} made early on to allow the plots of individual episodes to branch out into different territories in order to prevent the overarching plot from running out of momentum, which led to standalone episodes such as [...] "Squeeze" [...] being developed. The variety of storylines which the series has shown has led director Daniel Sackheim to note that [...] "The X-Files has sort of found its own style in that it doesn't have a confined style to it", adding that the series' [...] "fluid" [...] approach has meant that [...] "everybody who comes on the show attempt <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> scary movie". To this end, several episodes feature varying plots, with alien-influenced storylines varying between [...] "Ice", a [...] "briskly-paced" [...] episode set in a single location, and the character-driven [...] "Conduit", which served to fill in background on the characters. Elsewhere, plots focused on soul transference or reincarnation, with the episodes [...] "Shadows", [...] "Born Again" [...] and [...] "Lazarus" [...] sharing similar storylines. The [...] "tired" [...] plot of [...] "Ghost in the Machine" [...] featured a malevolent artificial intelligence; while [...] "Shapes" [...] introduced the first of what would become several Native American-themed episodes.|$|E

2500|$|The site added {{advertising}} {{over the}} course of late 2004, placed above and to the left and right of material, and, in 2005, in the site's RSS feed as well. Editor Cory Doctorow noted that [...] "John [...] said it's going to be harder <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> money to pay your bandwidth bills than it will be {{to make a lot of}} money and have a real source of income from this." [...] The advertising income during the first quarter was already $27,000, and , Boing Boing still [...] "makes a nice living for its founders and a handful of contract employees," [...] but it is no longer a member of Battelle's blog network Federated Media Publishing, Inc.|$|E

2500|$|The {{platforms}} {{were separated}} by about [...] and those closer to the Globe's equator were wider so {{there was always a}} gap of about [...] between the platform and the surface of the globe. Although the staircase and platforms allowed closer examination of individual sections, the structure prevented an appreciation of the globe as a single unit, and later there were plans for its removal. Some ventilation was provided by a system housed at the North Pole, which had the advantage of being quite featureless and located {{at the top of the}} globe, but the heat generated from the gas lighting and the mass of visitors meant the attraction was still uncomfortably hot; Henry Morley remarked that [...] "the heat reflected on all sides from the concave surfaces rises <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> Sahara of the North Pole Station", and Punch commented that the temperature was [...] "equal to that of any baker's oven." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hitchcock {{returned}} to the UK for an extended visit in late 1943 and early 1944. While there he made two short films in French for the British Ministry of Information: Bon Voyage and Aventure Malgache. The two British propaganda films made for the Free French were the only films that Hitchcock made in the French language, and they [...] "feature typical Hitchcockian touches". On his motivation for making the films, Hitchcock stated: [...] "I felt the need <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> contribution to the war effort, and I was both overweight and over-age for military service. I knew that if I did nothing, I'd regret {{it for the rest}} of my life." [...] From late June to late July 1945, Hitchcock served as [...] "treatment advisor" [...] on a Holocaust documentary which used footage provided by the Allied Forces. It was produced by Sidney Bernstein of the British Ministry of Information, and was assembled in London. Bernstein brought his future 1948–49 production partner Hitchcock on board as a consultant for the film editing process for the British Ministry of Information and the American Office of War Information.|$|E

Then he went to William the hatter's, and bade him <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> nice <b>little</b> velvet cap with a bell {{at the top of}} it. Then he went to Thomas the shoemaker's, and bade him <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> fine <b>little</b> pair of shoes. So they all did as he told them, and after these things were made he took them home with him. He laid them on a warm spot on the hearth where the boggart used to come to sleep at night.
