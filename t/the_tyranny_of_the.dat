40|$|Abstract <b>The</b> {{dominant}} conception <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{manager is}} <b>of</b> a morally neutral technician {{engaged in a}} world of purely rational problem solving. This is the conception advanced by business schools, by management consultants and, in large measure, by managers themselves. It is also that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> critical sociology <b>of</b> management, in which managers are cast as morally disabled technical problem solvers not because they choose to be so but because, in the bureaucratic business corporation, they have no choice. In both its mainstream and its critical forms, this conception of management is closely tied to <b>the</b> rationalizing characteristics <b>of</b> bureaucratic organization, but what of management in post-bureaucracy? This article explores <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> <b>the</b> business manager in the flexible network organizations that are characteristic of early 21 st-century business, and their implications for management education.

40|$|<b>The</b> Writer <b>of</b> {{this thesis}} {{is trying to}} explain as clearly as {{possible}} <b>the</b> idea <b>of</b> fighting against <b>tyranny</b> as seen in Shelley's masterpiece Prometheus Unbound. <b>The</b> Writer <b>of</b> <b>the</b> thesis wants to present the topic on <b>the</b> fight against <b>tyranny</b> {{because it is a}} way among others to cast aside <b>tyranny.</b> <b>The</b> interesting thing is that <b>the</b> way <b>of</b> fighting against <b>tyranny</b> in <b>the</b> lyrical drama does not require a bloodshed in its movement. To discuss this topic, <b>the</b> writer <b>of</b> <b>the</b> thesis, in his analysis, will divide into two parts, <b>the</b> <b>tyranny</b> <b>of</b> Jupiter, <b>the</b> fight <b>of</b> Prometheus against Jupiter. Such discussion is presented to explain <b>the</b> idea <b>of</b> fighting against <b>tyranny</b> in this play. Prometheus Unbound is taken from its origin in the Greek mythology, Prometheus Bound. It should be known that Shelley writes Prometheus Unbound because he clearly refuses the reconciliation reached by the oppressor, Zeus, and the oppressed, Prometheus in Aeschylus' Prometheus Bound. Prometheus Unbound does not give any suggestion <b>of</b> compromise because <b>the</b> whole story is about the confrontation between Jupiter and Prome-theus. On <b>the</b> discussion <b>of</b> Jupiter's <b>tyranny,</b> <b>the</b> writer <b>of</b> <b>the</b> thesis will analyse <b>the</b> origin <b>of</b> Jupiter's tyranny; it includes the cause and <b>the</b> effects <b>of</b> Jupiter's <b>tyranny.</b> On <b>the</b> discussion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fight against <b>tyranny,</b> <b>the</b> writer <b>of</b> <b>the</b> thesis will analyse how Prometheus's fight against Jupiter...|$|R

He preached a radical difference between the God of the Old Testament, the Demiurge, and the highest God, who had sent Jesus to the earth to free mankind from <b>the</b> <b>tyranny</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Jewish Law. Like the Gnostics, Marcion argued that Jesus was essentially a divine spirit appearing to men {{in the shape of a}} human form, and not someone in a true physical body.

25|$|Rather than {{previous}} liberal conceptions viewing society as populated by selfish individuals, Green viewed society as an organic whole {{in which all}} individuals {{have a duty to}} promote the common good. His ideas spread rapidly and were developed by other thinkers such as Leonard Trelawny Hobhouse and John A. Hobson. In a few years, this New Liberalism had become the essential social and political programme of the Liberal Party in Britain, and it would encircle much of the world in the 20th century. In addition to examining negative and positive liberty, liberals have tried to understand the proper relationship between liberty and democracy. As they struggled to expand suffrage rights, liberals increasingly understood that people left out of the democratic decision-making process were liable to <b>the</b> <b>tyranny</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> majority, a concept explained in Mill's On Liberty and in Democracy in America (1835) by Alexis de Tocqueville.

Abstract This paper analyses <b>the</b> liberation <b>of</b> information {{in general and}} some of its relationships with information access.

It holds a position in favor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> worldwide community <b>of</b> <b>the</b> commons [...] and the cognitariat [...] against <b>the</b> forces <b>of</b> private apropriation of information and knowledge commons and <b>the</b> movement <b>of</b> commons enclosures <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cognitive capitalism. It analyses <b>the</b> main mechanisms <b>of</b> how until nowadays information has been an object of opression against society, depriving it precisely of its access. Among these mechanisisms it can be found mainly the private intelectual apropriation and control of information and knowledge (the so called fallacious "intellectual property") and its diverse laws such as copyright and patents. It proposes alternative strategies and policies that seek to guarantee people [...] including the working class people [...] freedom and rights so they can achieve a free, free of charge, unhampered, democratic and socially egalitarian access to the information and knowledge that has been generated as a communal good towards the social and public welfare...|$|R

As early as 1898, he rejected his family's Jeffersonian Democratic tradition. His thoughts on liberty, collected in The Spirit of Liberty (1952), began by recalling the political philosophies of Thomas Jefferson and Alexander Hamilton. Jefferson believed that each individual {{has a right to}} freedom, and that government, though necessary, threatens that freedom. In contrast, Hamilton argued that freedom depends on government: too much freedom leads to anarchy and <b>the</b> <b>tyranny</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mob. Hand, who believed, following Thomas Hobbes, that the rule of law is the only alternative to the rule of brutality, leaned towards Hamilton. Since the freedom granted to the American pioneers was no longer feasible, he accepted that individual liberty should be moderated by society's norms. He nevertheless saw the liberty to create and to choose as vital to peoples' humanity and entitled to legal protection. He assumed the goal of human beings to be the [...] "good life", defined as each individual chooses.|$|E
