30|$|A recent {{clinical}} report evaluated morbidity {{associated with}} iliac crest harvesting [11]. At 1  week after harvesting, 28 and 72  % {{of the subjects}} felt severe pain and moderate pain, respectively. At 1  month after harvesting, 22 and 67  % of the subjects felt moderate pain and mild pain, respectively. The scars after harvesting were also evaluated, based on the patient satisfaction score, revealing that 22  % of the subjects felt bad about their condition [11]. Furthermore, Joshi et al. [12] reported that approximately 56  % of patients who underwent conventional iliac crest harvesting had postoperative gait disturbance for more than 2  weeks. Because gait disturbance {{is associated with the}} degree of invasiveness, a short incision can minimize the risk of complications [6]. To our knowledge, few articles have reported harvesting techniques using a <b>trephine</b> <b>bur</b> [4, 6, 13]. Burstein et al. [6] reported that the <b>trephine</b> <b>bur</b> technique can reduce incision length compared with conventional methods (2 vs. 5  cm). As a result, the use of the <b>trephine</b> <b>bur</b> technique permitted earlier ambulation and discharge from hospital [4, 6, 13]. Missiuna et al. [14] reported the morbidity associated with iliac crest harvesting using a <b>trephine</b> <b>bur.</b> They found that 69 and 100  % of the subjects were completely without pain at 1 and 8  weeks, respectively, after harvesting. Furthermore, none of the subjects reported any unpleasant signs and symptoms related to the residual scar. In another study, the use of a trephine to procure corticocancellous bone cores from the anterior iliac crest was found to carry a high risk of peritoneal perforation [15]. In our case, the <b>trephine</b> <b>bur</b> was used only for cutting of the cortical bone, and the cancellous bone was gently harvested with hand curettes. Consequently, there were no surgical complications.|$|E
30|$|After {{a healing}} period of 6  months, the biopsy was {{performed}} in ten patients with additional consent (Group 1, n =  5, Group 2, n =  5). During the uncovering surgery, drilling with the <b>trephine</b> <b>bur</b> (Dentium Co., Suwon, Korea) {{was performed on the}} sinus graft site of the alveolar crest.

30|$|The scapula of a cow was {{purchased}} {{from a local}} grocery, and discs (diameter 8  mm, thickness 1  mm) were prepared by <b>trephine</b> <b>bur.</b> Discs treated with 4 HR were used as the experimental group. Untreated discs were used as the control. X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), antibacterial test, endotoxin test, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were performed on the discs.

40|$|Objectives: This study {{evaluated}} key {{parameters of}} the in vitro osteogenesis induced by osteoblastic cells obtained from sites submitted to sinus grafting with anorganic bovine bone (ABB) in comparison with cells derived from bone sites of the same patients. Materials and methods: In three patients, the augmentation of maxillary sinus was carried out using ABB (Bio-Oss (R)). After at least 6 months, during the surgical intervention for titanium implants placement, biopsies were taken from these areas using <b>trephine</b> <b>burs</b> (grafted group). Bone fragments, of the same patients, from sites that had not received graft were also obtained with <b>trephine</b> <b>burs</b> and used as a control group. Osteoblastic cells were obtained from grafted and control groups by enzymatic digestion and cultured under standard osteogenic condition until subconfluence. First passaged {{cells were cultured in}} 24 -well culture plates. Cell adhesion was evaluated at 24 h. For proliferation and viability assay, cells were cultured for 1, 3, 7, and 10 days. Total protein content and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity were measured at 3, 7, 10, 14, 17, and 21 days. Cultures were stained with Alizarin red S at 21 days, for detection of mineralized matrix. Data were compared by Student`s t-test. Results: Cell adhesion and viability were not affected by cell source (P> 0. 05). Total protein content was greater (P< 0. 05) for grafted group. Cell proliferation, ALP activity, and bone-like nodule formation were all greater (P< 0. 05) for the control group. Conclusions: Taken together, these results indicate that the in vivo long-term contact of cells with ABB downregulates the expression of osteoblast phenotype and consequently the in vitro osteogenesis...|$|R
30|$|Although the {{drilling}} depth by <b>trephine</b> <b>burs</b> was around 6  mm underneath the 2  mm thick cortical bone, {{the height of}} harvested columnar bone samples was approximately 4 – 5  mm. Therefore, bone formation at the interface of the sinus membrane and grafted bone was not evaluated in this study. However, this result might indicate the new bone generated from the residual bone such as alveolar ridge, septal wall and maxillary tuberosity due to location of the hydroxyapatite residues and the blanching morphology of the newly formed bone from this original bone. However, there is a repot of possibility of bone formation along the sinus membrane(Sohn et al. 2011), thus, further investigations are required to confirm the mechanisms of bone formation in the grafted sinus.|$|R
30|$|Bone {{specimens}} {{for further}} histomorphometric examinations were {{gained from the}} 8 patients who received implants in Seoul National University Bundang Hospital (control n =[*] 4, experimental n =[*] 4) using <b>trephine</b> <b>burs</b> during the implant placements. The acquired specimens were decalcified using 10 % formic acid for 3  weeks, embedded in paraffin, and sagittal sections were obtained and then stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) for histologic examinations. Because of a small sample size, histologic, radiographic, and clinical evaluations were focused. To determine the relative amount of bone formation, the new bone formation ratio was measured using the analySIS LS starter program. The new bone formation was observed around the material {{in each of the}} 4 patient samples of each selected group, and the mean values of the areas were calculated. Statistical difference between bone formation of the two groups were calculated using Mann-Whitney U test.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to present the use of {{autogenous}} bone graft for regenerative management of infrabony and furcation osseous defects. A <b>trephine</b> <b>bur</b> (Auto Chip Maker ®) was used to obtain autograft from the anterior mandibular region. It is considered as the "gold standard" bone graft, but the difficulty in harvesting it and the increased chairside time have reduced its popularity.

30|$|A {{total of}} 10 {{patients}} (4 males, 6 females; 58.5 [*]±[*] 8.6  years) {{participated in this}} clinical research. Alveolar ridge augmentations were performed in edentulous (4 maxillary posterior, 5 mandibular posterior, and 1 mandibular anterior) regions. Anorganic bovine bone (ABB; Bio-Oss®, Geistlich Pharma AG, Wolhusen, Switzerland) {{was used as the}} bone graft material in the control group (n =[*] 5)) while hydroxyapatite-based alloplastic bony substitute with rhBMP- 2 (HA+rhBMP- 2; NOVOSIS®-Dent, CGBio Inc., Seongnam, Korea) was used in the experimental group (n =[*] 5). In order to evaluate relative changes in bone volume and resorption rate of the bone graft material, CBCT radiographs were taken immediately and at 4  months after the bone graft in all subjects. Among the 10 patients, 8 received dental implants in Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, while the others received in local clinics. Bone specimens for further histomorphometric examinations were gained from these 8 patients using <b>trephine</b> <b>burs</b> during the implant placements. Clinical, radiographic, and histomorphometric evaluations were focused because of the small sample size.|$|R
40|$|Background: Recently, tissue {{engineering}} {{has been introduced}} as a regenerative treatmentfor bone defects. There is some evidence showing bone regeneration frommesenchymal stem cells (MSC) loaded on hydroxyapatite β-tricalcium phosphate (HA/TCP) as a scaffold in large defects. This study aimed to comparethe {{quality and quantity of}} regenerated bone using Bio-Oss, HA/TCP andMSC loaded HA/TCP scaffolds. Methods: Mesenchymal stem cells were aspirated from iliac crest bone marrow afterextracting the first, second and third premolars and the first molar in fivemature hybrid dogs. The cells were cultured and their osteogenic differentiation potential was evaluated after the third cell passage using Alizarin redstaining in experimental conditions. The HA/TCP scaffold (3 x 3 x 3 mm) was loaded with undifferentiated mesenchymal stem cells. Bilateral bonedefects were then prepared in the jaws using <b>trephine</b> <b>burs.</b> The defects wererandomly filled with HA/TCP, Bio-Oss, or HA/TCP + MSCs. One defectserved as a control and was left as an empty cavity. All defects except thecontrol defect were covered with an absorbable membrane. Histological andhistomorphometric evaluations were conducted after 6 weeks and data weresubjected to analysis of variance (ANOVA) (p 0. 05). Conclusion: An MSC-loaded HA/TCP scaffold is a more effective alternative than BioOSS or HA/TCP in inducing bone regeneration...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: Implant removal can be {{required}} {{in case of}} malpositions, biological or mechanical failures. This procedure, performed with <b>trephine</b> <b>burs,</b> piezosurgery or counter-torque ratchets, often results in bone defects requiring corrections with advanced regenerative techniques. Few case reports describe implant removal after weakening the bone-implant interface by applying a localized heating to the fixture: however, this procedure must be standardized to obtain a predictable result, avoiding extensive bone damage. Aim of this preliminary study {{is to create a}} high-fidelity numerical model of the bone-implant system, to be validated by in vitro and in vivo tests, for predicting the most appropriate parameters necessary for a minimally invasive implant removal using heating. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A 3 -D virtual advanced numerical model was created using ANSYS CFX, in order to simulate the behavior of a bone-implant system under thermal variations. Various parameters can be adjusted to set the model: heating modalities (temperature and/or heat flux, time and source) and system characteristics (implant geometry and material, type of bone). In vitro tests were performed using titanium implants (Premium, Sweden & Martina, Italy - 3. 85 x 8. 5, 10 and 13 mm). Implants were inserted in bovine bone (stabilized at 37 ± 0. 5 °C), and then heated using an endodontic heat carrier (System B, Sybron Endo, USA). Bone temperatures were recorded using thermocouples at different depths (1 mm, middle and apex of implant) and at different distances from the implant [0. 5 mm (T 1), 1 mm (T 2), 1. 5 mm (T 3) and 2 mm (T 4) ]. Non parametric data were analyzed using Friedman and Wilcoxon tests. RESULTS: The heat carrier, set at 100 °C, was placed in contact with the inner part of the implants for 140 sec. The threshold temperature of 47 °C was reached in T 1 after 65. 2 ± 11. 7 sec, in T 2 after 89. 3 ± 29. 1 sec, in T 3 after 110. 9 ± 29. 6 sec, in T 4 the temperature of 47 °C was never reached within 140 sec. Differences between T 1, T 2, T 3 and T 4 resulted statistically significant (p< 0. 05). Implant length and distance from heat source are factors influencing temperature variations. CONCLUSIONS: From the results of this preliminary study, it seems possible to produce a controlled thermally-induced injury to the bone-implant interface, allowing for a minimally invasive implant removal. Various parameters (implant geometry and material, bone characteristics) must be considered to set temperature and heating duration. In vivo histologic studies are necessary to analyze quality and quantity of bone-implant interface modifications after heat-induced injury, before starting any clinical application...|$|R
30|$|Fifty-four rats {{were used}} in this study.

30|$|The present {{case report}} {{demonstrates}} a minimally invasive harvesting technique of PCBM from the iliac crest. The following important points {{need to be}} considered: (1) to avoid LFCN injury, a skin incision should be made parallel to and below the iliac crest by beginning at least 2  cm superior and lateral to the ASIS and (2) {{to minimize the risk}} of postoperative complications, the <b>trephine</b> <b>bur</b> should only be used for cutting of the cortical bone, and cancellous bone should be softly harvested with hand curettes after a short incision.|$|E
30|$|Six {{months after}} grafting, another CBCT {{examination}} {{was carried out}} for implant planning. In the sequence, following the previously described antiseptic and anesthetic procedures, two implants with a sand-blasted and acid etching surface were installed {{in each of the}} grafted sinuses, i.e., 40 implants in total (32 —Neoporous, Neodent, Curitiba, Paraná, Brazil; 8 —SLA, Straumann, Basel, Switzerland). A 10 -mm-long cylindrical bone biopsy was harvested using a 2 -mm internal diameter <b>trephine</b> <b>bur</b> during preparation for the most anterior implant site (i.e., two biopsies were retrieved from each patient). Six months later, the prosthetic rehabilitation of the patient was performed.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} {{clinical}} study was to test {{whether or not the}} addition of recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein- 2 (rhBMP- 2) to a xenogenic bone substitute mineral (Bio-Oss) will improve guided bone regeneration therapy regarding bone volume, density and maturation. In 11 partially edentulous patients, 34 Brånemark implants were placed at two different sites in the same jaw (five maxillae, six mandibles) requiring lateral ridge augmentation. The bone defects were randomly assigned to test and control treatments: the test and the control defects were both augmented with the xenogenic bone substitute and a resorbable collagen membrane (Bio-Gide). At the test sites, the xenogenic bone substitute mineral was coated with rhBMP- 2 in a lyophilization process. Following implant insertion (baseline), the peri-implant bone defect height was measured from the implant shoulder to the first implant-bone contact. After an average healing period of 6 months (SD 0. 17, range 5. 7 - 6. 2), the residual defects were again measured and <b>trephine</b> <b>burs</b> were used to take 22 bone biopsies from the augmented regions. The healing period was uneventful except for one implant site that showed a wound dehiscence, which spontaneously closed after 4 weeks. Later at reentry, all implants were stable. At baseline, the mean defect height was 7. 0 mm (SD 2. 67, range 3 - 12 mm) at test and 5. 8 mm (SD 1. 81, range 3 - 8 mm) at control sites. At reentry, the mean defect height decreased to 0. 2 mm (SD 0. 35, range 0 - 1 mm) at test sites (corresponding to 96 % vertical defect fill) and to 0. 4 mm (SD 0. 66, range 0 - 2 mm) at the control site (vertical defect fill of 91 %). Reduction in defect height from baseline to reentry for both test and control sites was statistically significant (Wilcoxon P< 0. 01). Histomorphometric analysis showed an average area density of 37 % (SD 11. 2, range 23 - 51 %) newly formed bone at test sites and 30 % (SD 8. 9, range 18 - 43 %) at control sites. The fraction of mineralized bone identified as mature lamellar bone amounted to 76 % (SD 14. 4, range 47. 8 - 94 %) at test compared to 56 % (SD 18. 3, range 31. 6 - 91. 4 %) at control sites (paired t-test P< 0. 05). At BMP-treated sites 57 % (SD 16. 2, range 29 - 81 %) and at control sites 30 % (SD 22. 6, range 0 - 66 %) of the surface of the bone substitute particles were in direct contact with newly formed bone (paired t-test P< 0. 05). It is concluded that the combination of the xenogenic bone substitute mineral with rhBMP- 2 can enhance the maturation process of bone regeneration and can increase the graft to bone contact in humans. rhBMP- 2 has the potential to predictably improve and accelerate guided bone regeneration therapy...|$|R

30|$|Iliac {{particulate}} cancellous {{bone and}} marrow (PCBM) {{is still the}} most predictable autogenous graft material for vertical ridge reconstruction because of its high cell content as well as osteoinductive and osteoconductive properties. However, postoperative meralgia paresthetica, gait disturbance, pain, and bleeding have been reported following conventional harvesting from the anterior iliac crest. We present a case of minimally invasive harvesting of iliac PCBM. A short incision was made, and the iliac crest was exposed after elevation of the periosteal membrane. Only the iliac cortical bone was removed using a <b>trephine</b> <b>bur</b> to avoid perforation. PCBM was harvested with hand curettes and grafted into the vertical ridge defect. Because of the small surgical field, gait disturbance was resolved within 1  day without other postoperative complications.

40|$|Nowadays, {{there are}} many {{techniques}} to compensate bone atrophies of the posterior maxilla {{in order to obtain}} an implant-supported rehabilitation. OBJECTIVE: This case series describes the Ebanist technique: a sinus lift procedure to be used in case of extremely resorbed bone crests (≤ 3 mm) allowing simultaneous implant placement. METHODS: With a dedicated cylindrical <b>trephine</b> <b>bur,</b> it is possible to harvest a cylinder of bone from a fresh mineralized frozen homologous bone block graft and to simultaneously create a trapdoor on the recipient site. The trapdoor cortical bone is detached from the sinus membrane and removed. Dental implant is placed into the graft before the grafting procedure since the cylindrical block, once inserted in the recipient area, is not able to oppose sufficient resistance to the torque needed for implant placement. RESULTS: Second-stage surgery and following prosthetic rehabilitation were performed after 5 months. In all cases, implant stability was manually checked and no pathological symptoms or signs were recovered at any follow-up visit.

40|$|Background. Direct metal laser {{sintering}} (DMLS) is an additive manufacturing technique {{that allows the}} fabrication of dental implants layer by layer through the laser fusion of titanium microparticles. The surface of DMLS implants {{is characterized by a}} high open porosity with interconnected pores of different sizes; therefore, {{it has the potential to}} enhance and accelerate bone healing. To date, however, there are no histologic/histomorphometric studies in the literature evaluating the interface between bone and DMLS implants in the long-term. Purpose. To evaluate the interface between bone and DMLS implants retrieved after 5 years of functional loading. Methods. Two fractured DMLS implants were retrieved from the human jaws, using a 5 [*]mm <b>trephine</b> <b>bur.</b> Both the implants were clinically stable and functioned regularly before fracture.

The present histologic/histomorphometric study showed that DMLS implants were well integrated in bone, after 5 years of loading, with the peri-implant bone undergoing continuous remodeling at the interface...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This {{experimental}} {{pilot study}} was undertaken to evaluate healing of titanium implants transplanted {{with the surrounding}} bone into recipient osseous sites in the rabbit mandible. One short implant was inserted in the horizontal portion of the mandible in each of 10 New Zealand rabbits. Subsequently, and during the same session, the implant with 1. 5 – 2. 0 mm of bone circumferentially was removed using a <b>trephine</b> <b>bur</b> and immediately transplanted in a through-and-through hole prepared in the contralateral aspect of the mandible. Three months following the transplantation, the animals were sacrificed and the mandibles processed for histological evaluation. The healing pattern was assessed in relation to (1) bone bridging at the interface between the bone core and the surrounding recipient osseous tissue, (2) differences in bone density between the transplanted bone cylinder and the bone {{at the margins of}} the recipient site, and (3) bone-to-implant contact (BIC) at the interface. The transplanted graft–implant cores were integrated within the recipient sites in five out of the 10 specimens while the remaining five bone–implant cores showed fibrous encapsulation.

40|$|ABSTRACT PURPOSE: To {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} locally applied simvastatin plus biphasic calcium phosphate (BoneCeramic(r)) or collagen sponge on bone formation in critical-sized bone defects. METHODS: Thirty defects of 5 mm in diameter were created bilaterally with a <b>trephine</b> <b>bur</b> in the calvariae of fifteen Wistar rats. The defects were divided into five groups: group 1 - control, no treatment; group 2 (BoneCeramic(r)); group 3 (BoneCeramic(r) + 0. 1 mg simvastatin); group 4 (collagen sponge); and group 5 (collagen sponge + 0. 1 mg simvastatin). After eight weeks the animals were euthanized and their calvariae were histologically processed. Hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections were subjected to histological and histomorphometrical analyses. The area of newly formed bone was calculated and compared between groups. RESULTS: The greater amount of a bone-like tissue was formed around the carrier in group 3 (BoneCeramic(r) + 0. 1 mg simvastatin) followed by group 2 (BoneCeramic(r)), and almost no bone was formed in the other groups. Group 3 was significantly different compared to group 2, and both groups were significantly different {{compared to the other}} groups. CONCLUSION: Simvastatin combined with BoneCeramic(r) induced significantly greater amounts of newly formed bone and has great potential for the healing of bone defects...|$|E

30|$|Porous {{hydroxyapatite}} {{is a major}} {{bone substitute}} (Yoshikawa et al. 2009; Yuasa et al. 2004). Its high pore rate (72 – 78  %) and large interpore distance markedly reduce its mechanical strength (Moller et al. 2014; Liu 1996). However, greater porosity facilitates intraparticulate cell migration from adjacent tissues (Phipps et al. 2012; Fassina et al. 2010). Bone conductivity of hydroxyapatite also induces bone formation in the particles (Campana et al. 2014). Hydroxyapatite particles {{can be used to}} maintain the lifted sinus space and promote mineralization and maturation of new bone; however histological and radiographic findings of bone regeneration clinically induced by porous hydroxyapatite alloplast have not been frequently reported (Kolerman et al. 2012). Difficulty in the surgical procedure can be a major reason why only a few number of this kind of works have been reported, wherein just a single drilling in the jaw with a <b>trephine</b> <b>bur</b> is allowed to retrieve the bone-with- HA sample, simultaneously preparing the direction and cavity diameter for the implant at once. And it is often that mishandling with the drill bit would not be recovered, resulting in missing of the primary stabilization of implants. Furthermore, it might not always be easy to obtain patients’ understanding of the unusual methodology of the implant surgery and eligible to proceed with it for benefit to patients.|$|E
40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{this study}} was to histologically {{evaluate}} the healing following implantation of a collagen/hydroxyapatite/chondroitin sulphate graft (Biostite) in human post-extraction defects. Methods: After tooth removal and socket degranulation, Biostite was implanted to fill the defect. Flaps were mobilized and sutured to ensure complete coverage of the graft. Hard tissue biopsies were harvested with a 2 mm-diameter <b>trephine</b> <b>bur</b> after 3 and 6 months post-implantation. Results: Healing progressed uneventfully, no esfoliation or infective complication were recorded. 3 -month histologic observations demonstrated new bone formation around Biostite particles. The newly formed bone was represented by immature bone trabeculae undergoing mineralization, with an osteoblastic layer lining the osteoid matrix. CD 68 -positive multinucleated cells with features similar to osteoclasts were present along the surface of graft particles. At 6 months, the newly formed bone was more mature, well-vascularized, although some areas were still undergoing mineralization. Osteoclastic-mediated resorption was also observed. Particles of biomaterial were still evident and appeared integrated with surrounding bone. Biostite appeared well-tolerated, in no cases inflammatory infiltrate was observed around the implanted particles. Conclusions: This study indicates that bone regeneration in post-extraction defects can be favorably supported by the implantation of a collagen/hydroxyapatite/chondroitin sulphate graft.

40|$|Although {{the search}} for the ideal bone {{substitute}} {{has been the focus of}} a large number of studies, autogenous bone is still the gold standard for the filling of defects caused by pathologies and traumas, and mainly, for alveolar ridge reconstruction, allowing the titanium implants installation. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the dynamics of autogenous bone graft incorporation process to surgically created defects in rat calvaria, using epifluorescence microscopy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Five adult male rats weighing 200 - 300 g were used. The animals received two 5 -mm-diameter bone defects bilaterally in each parietal bone with a <b>trephine</b> <b>bur</b> under general anesthesia. Two groups of defects were formed: a control group (n= 5), in which the defects were filled with blood clot, and a graft group (n= 5), in which the defects were filled with autogenous bone block, removed from the contralateral defect. The fluorochromes calcein and alizarin were applied at the 7 th and 30 th postoperative days, respectively. The animals were killed at 35 days. RESULTS: The mineralization process was more intense in the graft group (32. 09 %) and occurred mainly between 7 and 30 days, the period labeled by calcein (24. 66 %). CONCLUSIONS: The fluorochromes showed to be appropriate to label mineralization areas. The interfacial areas between fluorochrome labels are important sources of information about the bone regeneration dynamics...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: The aim of {{this study}} was to develop a computer-guided minimally-invasive {{protocol}} for the surgical application of an orthodontic traction during the forced eruption of an impacted canine. METHODS: 3 Diagnosys® software was used to evaluate impacted canines position and to plan the surgical access, taking into account soft and hard tissues thickness, orthodontic traction path and presence of possible obstacles. Geomagic® software was used for reverse engineering and RhinocerosTM software was employed as three-dimensional modeller in preparing individualized surgical guides. Surgical access was gained flapless through the use of a mucosal punch for soft tissues, followed by a <b>trephine</b> <b>bur</b> with a pre-adjusted stop for bone path creation. A diamond bur mounted on SONICflex® 2003 /L handpiece was used to prepare a 2 -mm-deep calibrated hole into the canine enamel where a titanium screw connected with a stainless steel ligature was screwed. In-vitro pull-out tests, radiological and SEM analysis were realized in order to investigate screw stability and position. RESULTS: In two out of ten samples the screw was removed after the application of a 1 -kg pull-out force. Radiological and SEM analysis demonstrated that all the screws were inserted into the enamel without affecting dentine integrity. CONCLUSIONS: This computer-guided minimally-invasive technique allowed a precise and reliable positioning of screws utilized during the orthodontic traction of impacted canines...|$|E
