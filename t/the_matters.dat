5|$|The Court of Appeal held {{further that}} as the {{discretion}} conferred by section 8 of the ISA involved national security, {{the issue of whether}} detention was necessary should be left solely to executive discretion.

40|$|Abstract. According to the QCD, <b>the</b> hadronic <b>matter</b> {{can have}} various phases with matter density and temper-ature. In general, {{when there is}} phase {{transition}} in a matter, {{it is known that}} a symmetry in <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> changes. In case of <b>the</b> hadronic <b>matter,</b> <b>the</b> chiral symmetry in <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> is expected to be restored when <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> density (or temperature) increases. The actual order parameter with respect to the chiral symmetry in <b>the</b> hadronic <b>matter</b> is known as the quark condensate from the QCD, but the pion decay constant, corresponding to the radius of the chiral circle, plays the role of the order parameter in an effective field theoretical approach to the QCD. In this paper, by using the skyrmion model which is an effective theory to the QCD, we construct <b>the</b> skyrmion <b>matter</b> as a model of <b>the</b> hadronic <b>matter</b> (nuclear <b>matter)</b> and calculate <b>the</b> pion decay constant in <b>the</b> <b>matter.</b> Because of presence of <b>the</b> <b>matter,</b> <b>the</b> pion decay constant is split into the two components, the temporal component and the spatial component. We discuss the phase transition in <b>the</b> skyrmion <b>matter</b> and behavior of the two components of the decay constant for massless pion with density of <b>the</b> skyrmion <b>matter...</b>|$|R
5|$|Equality {{in matters}} of public employment: Article 16 of the {{constitution}} lays down that the State cannot discriminate against anyone in <b>the</b> <b>matters</b> of employment. All citizens can apply for government jobs. There are some exceptions. The Parliament may enact a law stating that certain jobs can be filled only by applicants who are domiciled in the area. This may be meant for posts that require knowledge of the locality and language of the area. The State may also reserve posts for members of backward classes, scheduled castes or scheduled tribes which are not adequately represented in the services under the State {{to bring up the}} weaker sections of the society. Also, there a law may be passed that requires that the holder of an office of any religious institution shall also be a person professing that particular religion. According to the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, 2003, this right shall not be conferred to Overseas citizens of India.|$|E

5|$|These {{powers were}} {{generally}} devolved {{to the prime}} minister and ministers. <b>The</b> <b>matters</b> are political by nature and call for political judgment rather than judicial control. Thus, Parliament is the most appropriate forum for debate and the best qualified to control the executive. However, in practice, parliamentary accountability of ministers is not entirely effective. The prerogative powers that the government officials exercise on behalf of the Crown, coupled with a weak system of checks and balances between the Parliament and the executive, can lead to an abuse of those powers which may be detrimental to the people. The possibility of such abuse, coupled with the way administrative law and judicial review evolved since the 1960s– a period of judicial activism– led courts in the United Kingdom to take an increasing interest {{in the manner in which}} prerogative powers had been exercised.|$|E
5|$|Re Lim Chor Pee, {{ex parte}} Law Society of Singapore (1985) {{is another example}} of a case where a {{mandatory}} order was granted by the High Court. The appellant, Lim Chor Pee, who was an advocate and solicitor, had been convicted of several income tax offences and had been found to have tampered with a witness. On 16 July 1982, the Attorney-General wrote to the President of the Law Society of Singapore, providing information on the appellant's conviction and other records. Following a report by the Society's Inquiry Committee that a formal inquiry into the appellant's conduct was necessary, a Disciplinary Committee was appointed. The appellant successfully applied to the Disciplinary Committee to delete certain paragraphs of the statement of case which had been formulated against him by the Council of the Law Society, on the ground that the facts in those paragraphs did not appear in the Inquiry Committee's report. Consequently, three of the six charges against the appellant and a major portion of one other charge did not require investigation by the Disciplinary Committee. Dissatisfied with this decision, the Law Society applied to the High Court for an order of mandamus to direct the Disciplinary Committee to hear and investigate all the six charges against the appellant. The High Court granted the application, holding that under the Legal Profession Act, the Inquiry Committee's only function was to consider <b>the</b> <b>matters</b> before it and decide whether or not there should be a formal investigation by a Disciplinary Committee. It was the duty of the Council of the Law Society to draw up the charges, and the duty of the Disciplinary Committee to hear and investigate the charges properly before the Committee in the statement of case. Thus, the appellant could not object that some of the charges against him were based on facts not mentioned in the Inquiry Committee's report. The decision was affirmed by the Court of Appeal.|$|E

40|$|It is {{supposed}} that while neutrino passing through <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> a resonance enhancement of neutrino oscillations in <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> appears.

It leads, for example, to changing of the effective mass of neutrino by the value of 0. 87 · 10 ^- 2 eV from the very small value of the energy polarization of <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> caused by neutrino which is equal to 5 · 10 ^- 12 eV. After removing this disadvantage (i. e., taking into account this law) we have obtained a solution of this equation.
