Hewett knew of Montezuma Castle from his work inventorying the Southwest for the GLO and Lacey, and he knew that it was not only archaeologically significant but also imperiled by aggressive pot hunting (sometimes using dynamite <b>to</b> <b>knock</b> <b>down</b> <b>walls</b> so that rooms within could be excavated). Hewett lent his support to the creation of this national monument, which came into being in 1907.|$|R

5000|$|Bangle's {{successor}} {{as chief}} designer Adrian van Hooydonk has shepherded succeeding generations of BMW nameplates into the evolutionary phase of design while also reincorporating traditional BMW cues such as L-styled taillights {{and a strong}} family resemblance; for instance {{the contrast between the}} E60 and F10 iterations of the 5 Series. According to van Hooydonk, [...] "BMW design has a tendency to periodically muscle in with big, bold, design statements - <b>to</b> <b>knock</b> <b>down</b> <b>walls</b> - and in the follow-up model, its stylists can move about a bit more in the clean air made possible by its predecessor". Some have criticized van Hooydonk's designs as too bland and conservative and lacking the Avant-garde styling of Bangle designs.|$|R

5000|$|Police {{initially}} {{attempted to}} force Dorner {{out of the}} cabin by using tear gas and demanding over loudspeakers that he surrender. When Dorner did not respond, police used a demolition vehicle <b>to</b> <b>knock</b> <b>down</b> most <b>walls</b> of the building. They then shot pyrotechnic tear gas canisters into the cabin, {{which resulted in the}} cabin catching fire. Such devices are nicknamed [...] "burners", as the heat generated by the pyrotechnic reaction often causes fires. Shortly thereafter, a single gunshot was heard from the cabin. As the fire continued, ammunition was exploding from within the cabin, making it dangerous for officials to try to put out the fire. Law enforcement experts differ on whether using pyrotechnic devices to end the standoff, instead of waiting Dorner out, was justified.|$|R

[...] Joe O'Sullivan from This Is Fake DIY commented that [...] "the verse / chorus trade off between Coco and Robyn works very well, the contrast in their voices utilised to great effect as Robyn's impassioned singing is offset from Coco's by disinterested then snarling turns of We're going <b>to</b> <b>knock</b> <b>down</b> the <b>walls,</b> <b>knock</b> <b>down</b> the <b>walls</b> {{as the end of}} the chorus approaches." [...] Ian Gittins from Virgin Media described [...] "Caesar" [...] as [...] "fantastic sub-Gaga electro-brat-pop and, most importantly, big fun."

25|$|Porter, enraged by Butler's timorousness, went to U. S. Grant {{and demanded}} that Butler be removed. Grant agreed, and placed Major General Alfred H. Terry {{in charge of a}} second assault on the fort. The second assault began on January 13, 1865, with unopposed {{landings}} and bombardment of the fort by the fleet. Porter imposed new methods of bombardment this time: each ship was assigned a specific target, with intent to destroy the enemy's guns rather than <b>to</b> <b>knock</b> <b>down</b> the <b>walls.</b> They were also to continue firing after the men ashore started their assault; the ships would shift their aim to points ahead of the advancing troops. The bombardment continued for two more days, while Terry got his men into position. On the 15th, frontal assaults on opposite faces by Terry's soldiers on the land side and 2000 sailors and marines on the beach vanquished the fort. This was the last significant naval operation of the war.|$|R

Scania has the ambition to half the used energy per produced unit to the year 2020, with the base line year of 2010. There are a number of projects aiming to help fulfil this goal and one of them are this thesis work.  A common solution to save space when hiring new employees is <b>to</b> <b>knock</b> <b>down</b> the <b>walls</b> in cell offices and create open plan offices where more people than before can share the space.

5000|$|Based on {{the earlier}} Kelly tool, the Halligan is a {{multipurpose}} tool for prying, twisting, punching, or striking. It {{consists of a}} claw (or fork), a blade (wedge or adze), and a tapered pick, which is especially useful in quickly breaching many types of locked doors. Either the adze end or fork end of the tool {{can be used to}} break through the latch of a swinging door by forcing the tool between the door and doorjamb and prying the two apart, striking it with a sledgehammer or a flat-head axe. The firefighter holding the Halligan can use a [...] "baseball bat swing" [...] to sink the pick into the door frame near the door handle and then force the door by applying pressure to the adze. Another option is to use the Halligan to pry the door off the top hinges. The pick and adze, only when properly used provide protectionto the arms, hands, and body of the holder during forcible entry operation. The Halligan can be used <b>to</b> <b>knock</b> <b>down</b> a <b>wall</b> in a house to get to another area. The halligan {{can be used to make}} a purchase point on a car hood to cut the battery. The point can be used to break glass on a car or building for access or ventilationThe pick can be placed into the shackle (or eye) of a padlock or hasp and twisted or pried to break it free. It can also be driven into a roof to provide a foothold for firefighters engaged in vertical ventilation. Using a K-tool and the adze end, a lock cylinder can easily be pulled. The fork end is routinely used to shut off gas meter valves. The Halligan can also be used for vehicle extrication among other things. The tool can be used to pry open the hood of a car when it is jammed from an accident. The Halligan can be used as a step to get up on a window that is at head level. The Halligan can be tied to a rope and act as an anchor in the window frame, for improvised bailout.|$|R
5000|$|In spring 1825, the Ottomans came to besiege the Greeks again. The Ottoman {{commander}} Reşid Mehmed Pasha {{was informed}} [...] "Either Missolonghi falls or your head" [...] as the Sultan {{would not tolerate}} a third failed siege. It was a common practice in the Ottoman empire for those generals who failed the Sultan {{to pay the price}} of their failure with their lives. The location of Missolonghi was on a long spit of land surrounded by a lagoon full of islands, giving it a strong defensive position. Three islands, Marmaris, Klisova and Aitoliko controlled the entrance to the lagoon. Much of the ground on the eastern landward side was marshy and on the eastern side was a wide open plain. The town's was surrounded by earthen walls, but their defences had been strengthened as a military engineer from Chios, Michael Kokkinis who had built a series of 17 bastions containing 48 guns and 4 mortars, forming triangular projections so the defender could bring interlocking fire on any attacker. Kokkinis named the bastions after heroes for liberty, naming them after Benjamin Franklin, William of Orange, Tadeusz Kościuszko, Lord Byron, Karl von Normann-Ehrenfels, Markos Botsaris, Skanderbeg, Lord Sheffield, and so on. The defenders were some 3, 000 men, most Greek, but a few were Italian, Swiss and German philhellenes. The Greeks were nominally led by a committee of three, but the dominant personality was a Souliot captain Nótis Bótsaris. The Ottoman forces were 20, 000, of which 8, 000 were professional soldiers, the rest Albanian irregulars while some 4, 000 were Greeks enslaved to work on building the Ottoman entrenchments, which thus left the Greek defenders the bitter feeling of having to kill their own countrymen unwillingly working for the Ottomans. Reshid promptly put his Greek slaves to work building a series of trenches around Missolonghi that gradually brought his men closer to the town, reaching up to 100 yards of Missolonghi. Reshid {{was at the end of}} long and tenuous supply lines and simply did not have enough cannonballs <b>to</b> <b>knock</b> <b>down</b> the <b>walls</b> of Missolonghi. Whatever a breach was made, attempts to storm it were beaten off with ferocious counter-attacks while all the citizens of Missolonghi, men and women worked together to fill the breaches in during the night.|$|R

50|$|The {{rules of}} this game are {{slightly}} more complicated than the European version. Each bowler will roll the ball twice in each frame regardless {{of the number of}} pins <b>knocked</b> <b>down</b> on each roll. When a bowler’s turn is completed, the next bowler will not receive a “Full House” to bowl at: rather, the next bowler must attempt <b>to</b> <b>knock</b> <b>down</b> the pins that were left by the previous bowler. For example, if the first bowler is only able <b>to</b> <b>knock</b> <b>down</b> seven pins, the second bowler must attempt <b>to</b> <b>knock</b> <b>down</b> the remaining two pins. Should the second bowler be unsuccessful in <b>knocking</b> <b>down</b> both of these pins in the allotted two rolls, the third bowler will attempt <b>to</b> <b>knock</b> <b>down</b> the remaining pins. This will continue until the remaining pins are <b>knocked</b> <b>down</b> or {{until the end of the}} frame. Once all pins are <b>knocked</b> <b>down,</b> the “12-pin”/”Redhead” is left standing alone (see below), or the end of the frame is reached, all nine pins (a Full House) will be reset.|$|R
