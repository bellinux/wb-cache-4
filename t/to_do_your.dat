500|$|Both teams {{valued the}} competition, despite some {{commentators}} being dismissive of the match's importance. CSKA captain Sergei Ignashevich underlined his team's determined mood: [...] "We know their players {{are very strong}} because they won the Champions League. But we are not thinking about individuals. We will only worry about ourselves and not them." [...] Likewise Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard was equally determined to be successful: [...] "This {{is the opportunity to}} win another trophy. When you play against good teams you have <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>your</b> best. I am not thinking about the past and that we won the Champions League." ...|$|E
500|$|According to co-creator Miles Millar, [...] "unlike most shows, which pick up in January and you've {{got four}} weeks [...] <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>your</b> casting", Millar and co-creator Al Gough had five months {{to cast their}} lead characters. In October 2000, the two {{producers}} began their search for the three lead roles, and had casting directors in ten different cities. The following {{is a list of}} all the characters that are, or at one time were, a main character in the show. During its first season, Smallville had eight regular characters. Six characters from the original cast left the show, with eight new characters coming in over the course of nine seasons.|$|E
500|$|In 2011, a woman {{residing}} in Sheboygan, Wisconsin became unresponsive {{due to an}} asthma attack. Unable to wait for an ambulance, her daughter and a friend performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) on her, which they learned from Grey's Anatomy. Despite this, Resident Karen Zink, M.D., deemed the show's portrayal of interns inaccurate, adding: [...] "None of [...] have bags under their eyes. They all leave the hospital dressed cute, with their hair done and makeup on. That is {{so far away from}} the reality of interns. You are just dragging your butt, trying to stay alive. You don't have time <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>your</b> hair. You don't have time to put on makeup. Every surgical intern has bags under their eyes." [...] The series placed at No. 66 on Entertainment Weekly [...] "New TV Classics" [...] list, and was declared the third highest rated show for the first ten years of the Internet Movie Database (2002–2012).|$|E

500|$|Early on, Young {{established}} himself {{as one of the}} harder-throwing pitchers in the game. Bill James wrote that Zimmer often put a piece of beefsteak inside his baseball glove to protect his catching hand from Young's fastball. In the absence of radar guns, however, it is impossible to say just how hard Young actually threw. Young continued to perform at a high level during the 1890 season. On {{the last day of the}} season, Young won both games of a doubleheader. In the first weeks of Young's career, Cap Anson, the player-manager of the Chicago Colts spotted Young's ability. Anson told Spiders' manager Gus Schmelz, [...] "He's too green <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>your</b> club much good, but I believe if I taught him what I know, I might make a pitcher out of him in a couple of years. He's not worth it now, but I'm willing to give you $1,000 ($ today) for him." [...] Schmelz replied, [...] "Cap, you can keep your thousand and we'll keep the rube." ...|$|E
500|$|Less than an {{hour before}} the {{independence}} ceremony a Belgian officer arrived to request that Lumumba depart for parliament. Kasongo was disturbed by what Lumumba planned to say and told Kanza as he left, [...] "I'm counting on you <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>your</b> best to tone down that speech." [...] As Lumumba dressed, Kanza and one of the secretaries, André Mandi, read through as much of the speech as they could, replacing some individual words with less inflammatory language and crossing out several full paragraphs deemed too difficult to temper. Lumumba then left in a motorcade for his official residence to rendezvous {{with the rest of his}} government. Kanza and Mandi followed in the second car, making additional revisions to the speech. These were so extensive that both feared Lumumba would be unable to clearly read his remarks. Upon their arrival at the residence, Kanza and Mandi briefly explained their alterations to Lumumba. Greatly pleased with the result, Lumumba stated that he would read some parts of the speech verbatim, then improvise to respond to the atmosphere in the room as he saw fit. He made his own alterations to the script during the speeches given by Baudouin and Kasa-Vubu.|$|E
500|$|Recording {{took place}} at Guerilla Beach and Larrabee West in Los Angeles, and at Sarm West and Olympic Studios in London. According to Blatt, their {{collaboration}} with Orbit allowed All Saints to explore more experimental genres than those of their previous releases, while Nichols viewed Orbit's production in the new arrangement completely different, and better than that of his own on the original. The [...] "Black Coffee" [...] sessions were more frustrating for group member Natalie Appleton who saw the song {{as an opportunity for}} fellow member Nicole Appleton and herself to sing lead vocals for a change because it was not written by Lewis. In the Appletons' 2002 autobiography Together, Natalie wrote that Lewis was [...] "staking her claim" [...] by arriving early for the first session because Blatt sang lead vocals on [...] "Pure Shores" [...] and not her. Per Natalie's suggestion, management eventually let her cut a lead vocal, but she was nervous during the recording and believed they were placating her. [...] "Without support, it is hard <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>your</b> best," [...] Natalie recalled in Together, adding that she felt [...] "used and slacked off".|$|E

500|$|Tender Mercies {{includes}} no original film score, and {{the musical}} soundtrack {{is limited to}} the performances of country songs and the domestic guitar playing that occur as part of the story. A score was composed for the movie, but Beresford had it removed because he felt it was [...] "too sweet" [...] and sounded phony {{in the context of the}} film, although he acknowledged it as [...] "very skillful". Duvall sang his own songs, a right he insisted be part of his contract. He commented, [...] "What's the point if you're not going <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>your</b> own ? They're just going to dub somebody else? I mean, there's no point to that." [...] The film's financial backers were initially concerned about whether he could sing well enough for the role. Those concerns were allayed after Duvall produced a tape of himself singing a cappella [...] "On the Wings of a Dove", a Bob Ferguson country song featured in the film. Duvall collaborated with Beresford in deciding on the unusual staging of the emotional scene in which Mac sings it after reflecting on the reunion with his daughter. The song is performed with Mac looking out a window with his back to the camera, his face unseen. Horton Foote thought the choice made the scene more moving and called it [...] "an extraordinary moment" [...] in the film. Duvall wrote two of Mac's other songs, [...] "Fool's Waltz" [...] and [...] "I've Decided to Leave Here Forever". Several leading country singers, including Willie Nelson, George Jones and Merle Haggard, were believed to have inspired Mac and Duvall's portrayal of him, but Duvall insisted the character was not based on anyone in particular. Another country star, Waylon Jennings, complimented his performance, saying he had [...] "done the impossible." ...|$|E

Duvall {{was said to have}} written the music, but the actor said he wrote only a few [...] "background, secondary songs." [...] Duvall did do his own singing, insisting it be added to his contract that he sing the songs himself; Duvall said, [...] "What's the point if you're not going <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>your</b> own ?

2500|$|The school motto Quantum Potes Tantum Aude ("Dare All You Can, for God and Man") was {{introduced}} by the rector-headmaster, Fr Thomas Gartlan SJ, in 1906. Quantum Potes Tantum Aude is now formally translated from Latin as [...] "As {{much as you can}} do, so much dare to do", seen to best reflect the Latin, replacing the former [...] "Dare <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>your</b> Best". The motto is taken from a song of Saint Thomas Aquinas (12271274) entitled Lauda Sion Salvatorem ('Praise, O Sion, Praise Thy Saviour'). The next line after Quantum Potes Tantum Aude is Quia Maior Omni Laude, which, together, translates to [...] "As much as you can do, so much dare to do, because He is above all praise".|$|E
