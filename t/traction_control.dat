5|$|Passenger safety {{was a key}} design aspect for the Ford engineers. Anti-lock brakes were {{standard}} on all models; electronic brakeforce distribution was also {{standard on}} most variants. The addition of <b>traction</b> <b>control</b> for higher trim levels helped to prevent loss of traction. On top of this, dual front airbags were a standard fitment across the range; side-impact airbags were equipped on higher luxury levels such as the Fairmont. In a crash safety assessment conducted by ANCAP, the BA model scored 27.27 {{out of a possible}} 37 points, giving a rating of four out of five stars.|$|E
5|$|Safety {{played a}} {{substantial}} {{role in the}} development of the VX model. Bosch 5.3 anti-lock brakes were made standard on all variants, a first for an Australian manufactured car; and <b>traction</b> <b>control</b> was made available on vehicles equipped with manual transmission. Extensive research was undertaken to reduce the effects from a side-impact collision through modification of the B-pillars. The risk presented by a side-impact collision in a VX fitted without side airbags is reduced by 50percent when compared to a similarly specified VT model.|$|E
5|$|Standard gear {{includes}} climate control, Blaupunkt sound, cruise control, full trip computer, rear park assist, <b>traction</b> <b>control</b> system, Electronic Stability Control, power {{mirrors and}} windows. The oil, voltage and temperature gauges are now digital. The interior offers {{a choice of}} light urban beige, white or black for the colours. The carpets remain dark as in the Holden Calais V-Series. The Senator Signature also offers a number of options such as a roof mounted DVD player, front park assist, rain sensing wipers and door entry lamps. Satellite navigation will become available as an option in the near future.|$|E
50|$|The {{entire range}} is now {{equipped}} with {{new generation of}} electronics, including a new IMU, racing ABS and anti-wheelie. Switchable riding modes and <b>traction</b> <b>controls,</b> similar to the old version, have been ported over onto the new platform.|$|R
50|$|Initial {{specifications}} for the locomotives (manufacturer's code SDA1) were for a 120 km/h dual cab, Co-Co locomotive, {{with a mass}} of 134 t, powered by a MTU Friedrichshafen 20V4000R43L engine, with AC <b>traction</b> <b>controlled</b> by IGBT based converters (sourced from Zhuzhou CSR Times Electric), and a Wabtec braking system.|$|R

5|$|The VT heralded the fitment of {{semi-trailing}} arm independent {{rear suspension}} as standard across the range, a significant selling point over the rival Falcon, along with increased electronics such as <b>Traction</b> <b>Control.</b> However, in terms of suspension, the original Opel design was simplified by removing the toe control links that was standard equipment on the European Omega since 1987. Consequently, this afflicted the VT with excessive tyre wear due to distortions to the suspension camber angle and toe under heavy load, such as heavy towing or when travelling over undulated surfaces.|$|E
5|$|The {{braking system}} is {{conventional}} hydraulic (Power assisted) with disk brakes {{at the front}} and drum brakes at the rear. Anti-lock Braking System and <b>Traction</b> <b>Control</b> System is fitted. The hand/parking brake is cable operated, acting on the rear wheels. The hydraulic fluid reservoir is under the front bonnet/hood. As there is no manifold vacuum, there is an electric vacuum pump located under the rear loading platform. There are interlocks on the braking system so that the starting up process can only be initiated when the brake pedal is pressed.|$|E
5|$|Kubica {{dropped to}} 13th as his <b>traction</b> <b>control</b> fault worsened, and a train of cars {{that wanted to}} pass {{developed}} behind him. Kovalainen's performance was much better than at the previous round in Melbourne, and he attempted to pass Jarno Trulli for eighth. The top five again remained the same after {{the second round of}} stops. However, Hamilton's short first stop necessitated a relatively early second stop, allowing Räikkönen to reduce the gap and Alonso to extend his lead to 18 seconds. Nico Rosberg, running in sixth place after the stops, was forced to retire with hydraulic problems on lap 43. David Coulthard also retired after problems with his brake pedal, the same problem that he experienced in the Friday practice session.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} a thorough analysis of potential-based and non-potential-based cohesive zone models (CZMs) {{under conditions of}} mixed-mode separation and mixedmode over-closure. Problems are identified with the well established potential-based Xu Needleman (XN) model {{and a number of}} new potential-based and non-potential-based models are proposed. It is demonstrated that derivation of traction separation relationships from a potential function can result in non-physical repulsive normal tractions and instantaneous negative incremental energy dissipation under displacement controlled monotonic mixed-mode separation when the work of tangential separation exceeds the work of normal separation. A modified potential-based (MP) model is proposed so that the zone in which repulsive normal tractions occur can be controlled. The MP model also provides an additional benefit of correct penalisation of mixed-mode over-closure, in contrast to the XN model. In order to fully eliminate the problem of repulsive normal tractions a non-potential-based CZM (NP 1) is also proposed. This model is shown to provide physically realistic behaviour under conditions of displacement controlled mixedmode separation and over-closure. Noting that the form of the traction separation equations differ for mode I and mode II separation for the XN, MP and NP 1 models, an additional non-potential-based model (NP 2) is proposed so that near mode-independent behaviour can be achieved in displacement controlled separation, while correctly penalising over-closure. Following from the NP 2 model, a non-potential-based model in which coupling is based on the separation magnitude is considered (SMC model). In the final part of the paper the performance of each model under <b>traction</b> <b>controlled</b> mixed-mode separation is investigated by numerically inverting the traction separation equations. Separation paths for the XN model reveal a strong bias toward mode I separation while the NP 1 model exhibits a bias towards mode II separation. Interestingly, the NP 2 model exhibits a high degree of mode sensitivity under <b>traction</b> <b>controlled</b> conditions, in contrast to its near mode independence under displacement controlled conditions. It is demonstrated that incorrect weighting of the coupling terms in non-potential models can lead to the existence of a singularity under <b>traction</b> <b>controlled</b> conditions. Finally, it is demonstrated that the potential-based models fail to capture a gradual change from mode II to mode I work of separation, as reported experimentally for <b>traction</b> <b>controlled</b> interface separation. In a follow-on Part II companion paper a number of case studies are simulated, demonstrating that the theoretical findings of the present paper have significant implications for the finite element prediction of interface debonding...|$|R

5|$|Liverpool Data Research Associates (LDRA) {{were called}} in to {{investigate}} allegations of cheating using banned driving aids, such as <b>traction</b> <b>control</b> and launch control, both prohibited {{at the start of}} the year. The top three cars of Michael Schumacher, Nicola Larini and Mika Häkkinen were investigated and their teams were asked to surrender their systems' source code to the company. Larini's team, Ferrari, complied in light of allegations that they were cheating, but Schumacher and Häkkinen's teams, Benetton and McLaren refused, claiming copyright reasons. After being fined $100,000 by the FIA, both teams complied eight days after the race. LDRA discovered that McLaren were running a programme that permitted automatic gearshifts but the car was declared legal.|$|E
5|$|The Fairmont model {{opened up}} the luxury sector for the BA range. Externally, the Fairmont could be {{distinguished}} from the other BA models with its 16-inch alloy wheels and grey mesh grille with chrome surround. Some of the standard features included <b>traction</b> <b>control</b> and dual-zone climate control air conditioning, an analogue clock on the top centre console stack, wood grain highlights, and velour upholstery. Automatic headlights, which turn off or on depending on surrounding environmental conditions, were now standard on the Fairmont model. In addition to this, the Fairmont also received illuminated footwells. The basic mechanical setup carried over from the XT, although buyers could opt for the Barra 220 V8 engine.|$|E
5|$|After the Belgian Grand Prix on 2 September, {{the teams}} {{conducted}} mid-season testing at various European race circuits between 4–7 September {{to prepare for}} the Italian Grand Prix at the Autodromo Nazionale Monza. Ferrari, Williams, BAR, Jordan and Minardi tested at the Mugello Circuit. Rubens Barrichello for Ferrari set the fastest times on the first and second days. The second day of testing was disrupted on six occasions after BAR test driver Takuma Sato went off the circuit, suffered an electronic control unit failure and had a malfunctioning anti-stall system. BAR driver Olivier Panis and Minardi driver Alex Yoong both had problems with their clutch and gearboxes. On the final day Michael Schumacher set the fastest lap of 1 minute and 24.226 seconds, four-tenths ahead of Panis. Ferrari test driver Luca Badoer spent three days at his team's private test track the Fiorano Circuit where he did practice starts as well as testing of launch control and <b>traction</b> <b>control.</b>|$|E

50|$|The 46 class {{featured}} six MV 272 {{traction motors}} fed current switched by electropneumatic power contactors. The MV 272 motor had six poles and was lap-wound. The driver's <b>traction</b> <b>controls</b> included the accelerating, reversing and regenerating handles. Nineteen starting and five field weakening resistances were available with the traction motors connected in series, series-parallel and parallel (for {{a total of}} seventy five manually selected power settings, e.g. OFF, starting resistors 1-19, all resistors cut out in 20, field weakening resistors cut in from 21 to 25). Series-parallel comprised two parallel circuits, each of three motors in series, whereas parallel is three parallel circuits of two motors in series. The removable reversing handle controlled the direction of travel and motor connection. Parallel was available only in the forward direction.|$|R

5|$|While the two Ferraris were delayed behind Hamilton, Alonso {{was pulling}} {{away at the}} front, setting fastest laps on laps seven and fifteen. On lap 12, Robert Kubica was {{the first man to}} pit for fuel and fresh tyres, however he {{reported}} <b>traction</b> <b>control</b> problems four laps later and lost places. Alonso had extended his lead over Hamilton to 15 seconds by the first round of pitstops. He had experienced radio problems before refuelling, but these were fixed during the stop. The Renaults were circulating in eighth and tenth by the pit stops, with Fisichella ahead of Kovalainen. Button {{was one of the few}} drivers who started on the slower harder tyre and was dropping down the field, as Takuma Sato passed the Briton. All of the front runners were on the same tyre strategy, with Räikkönen being the first front runner to pit. He found himself behind Fisichella as he exited. A short pit stop by Hamilton enabled him to come out of the pits ahead of the Renault, leaving a car between himself and Räikkönen during the pit window. Heidfeld's late stop on lap 22 helped him stay ahead of Massa. The top five positions remained unchanged, however Hamilton's different strategy enabled him to escape Räikkönen and close in on leader Alonso at a second per lap. Despite pitting on lap 20, he set the fastest lap of the race on lap 22 in 1:36.701.|$|E
25|$|In 1987, Mercedes-Benz, BMW and Toyota {{introduced}} {{their first}} <b>traction</b> <b>control</b> systems. <b>Traction</b> <b>control</b> works by applying individual wheel braking and throttle to keep traction while accelerating but, unlike the ESC, {{it is not}} designed to aid in steering.|$|E

25|$|ESC {{incorporates}} {{yaw rate}} control into the {{anti-lock braking system}} (ABS). Yaw is a rotation around the vertical axis; i.e. spinning left or right. Anti-lock brakes enable ESC to brake individual wheels. Many ESC systems also incorporate a <b>traction</b> <b>control</b> system (TCS or ASR), which senses drive-wheel slip under acceleration and individually brakes the slipping wheel or wheels and/or reduces excess engine power until control is regained. However, ESC serves a different purpose from that of ABS or <b>Traction</b> <b>Control.</b>|$|E
50|$|Washboarding or {{corrugation}} is {{the occurrence}} of periodic, transverse ripples in the surface of gravel and dirt roads. Washboarding occurs in dry, granular road material with repeated traffic, traveling at speeds above 5 mi/h km/h.
