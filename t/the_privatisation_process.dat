5|$|In 1986, Sessional Paper Number 1 was {{published}} by the Government of Kenya, outlining the country's need for economic development and growth. The document stressed the government opinion that the airline {{would be better off}} privately owned, thus resulting in the first privatisation attempt. The government named Philip Ndegwa as Chairman of the Board in 1991, with specific orders to make the airline a privately owned company. In 1992, the Public Enterprise Reform paper {{was published}}, giving Kenya Airways priority among national companies in Kenya to be privatised. Ndegwa was succeeded by Isaac Omolo Okero. In , Brian Davies, was appointed as the new managing director of the company. Davies had been previously hired to carry out a study of viability on privatisation, working for British Airways' Speedwing consulting arm. Swissair was the first company to provide Kenya Airways with privatisation advice. In the fiscal year 1993 to 1994, the airline produced its first profit since the start of commercialisation. In 1994, the International Finance Corporation was appointed to provide assistance in <b>the</b> <b>privatisation</b> <b>process,</b> which effectively began in 1995. A large aviation industry partner was sought to acquire 40% of the shares, with another 40% reserved for private investors and the government keeping the remaining stake. The government would absorb almost million in debts and would convert another million it provided in loans into equity; after reorganisation, the company would have a debt of approximate million. British Airways, KLM, Lufthansa and South African Airways were among the airlines expressing interest in taking a stake in Kenya Airways.|$|E

Officials have announced plans to sell 35 public corporations over three years, including power companies, Pakistan State Oil, Pakistan International Airlines and Pakistan Steel Mills. These enterprises currently lose taxpayers some 500billion rupees ($4.7billion) a year, while delivering poor service. Inefficiencies in energy cause frequent blackouts, and the supply problem is exacerbated by government subsidies that have cost a further 1.5trillion rupees over five years. <b>The</b> <b>privatisation</b> <b>process</b> will be led by a 15-member privatisation commission headed by Mohammad Zubair, formerly IBM's chief financial officer for the Middle East and Africa.

Another consortium led by Alitalia, American Airlines, KLM and Varig had earlier pulled out from the process. Paradoxically, {{one of the first}} actions taken by the new Peronist government was to privatise the carrier, after airily opposing to the privatisation propositions of its predecessor. The sale of the airline followed the divestiture of the government shareholding in the national telephone company, which took place earlier that month during the Carlos Menem presidency's privatisation wave, intended to divest the participation of the State in a number of enterprises {{in order to reduce the}} debt to foreign banks from US$40billion to billion. Aimed at favouring <b>the</b> <b>privatisation</b> <b>process,</b> the government absorbed a million debt the company took between 1981 and 1982 for capitalisation purposes. Despite the carrier being regarded as overstaffed and bureaucratic, it was debt-free at that time, having an average profitability of million a year; it actually had million in revenues for the year prior to the privatisation. The privatisation contract, which specified the buyer should pay million in cash and million in external debt bonds, was ratified by the Supreme Court. Furthermore, a clause enabled the buyer to indebt Aerolíneas Argentinas for the buyout process; this was reflected in the airline's 1991 balance, which included debts worth millions for its own acquisition. It was not until 2009 that this privatisation process would be ruled as illegal.|$|E

40|$|Since the mid- 1980 s, {{there has}} been a global {{movement}} away from state ownership towards private ownership of companies. An important aspect of this trend has been <b>the</b> <b>privatisation</b> of State-owned enterprises with the goal of improving their in general unsatisfactory performance. Initially, the prevailing view was in favour of a fast <b>privatisation</b> <b>process</b> as <b>the</b> only realistic way to combat the problems related to a lack of adequate corporate governance. It was also widely believed that market institutions could be built after the private ownership was created. Recently, reflecting on <b>the</b> disappointing <b>privatisation</b> results in some of the transition economies, policymakers have realised the need to strengthen market institutions prior to privatisation. This insight was further supported by growing evidence from the developed countries that privatisation alone has been insufficient to stimulate performance improvement. This research contributes to the recent debate on privatisation and its prerequisite restructuring. The focus is on developing countries, in particular Libya. From the mid- 1980 s until early 2000, Libya‟s industries were faced with US import and export restrictions as well as UN-imposed sanctions. Libya was therefore in an isolated position without much foreign competition for its enterprises. Currently, it is turning from a socialist- to a market-oriented economy which is open to foreign competition. This means that privatisation in Libya includes the need for creating an environment conducive {{to the development of the}} private sector. This process provides an opportunity to study how privatisation, competition, and regulation are related. The main objective of the research is: to gain insight into <b>the</b> <b>privatisation</b> <b>processes</b> in <b>the</b> context of developing countries by studying privatisation in Libya...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. While {{output and}} {{employment}} in the overextended and overmanned state sector decrease, it is crucial {{for the success of}} transition that private entrepreneurship builds up, increasing produc-tion and employment, in a process somewhat paralleling the dual development Harris-Lewis-Todaro model, where the state sector plays the role of the traditional sector endowed with an almost unlimited reserve of labour. The way this takes place depends to a great extent not only on the specific features of <b>the</b> <b>privatisation</b> <b>processes</b> pursued, but also on the overall institutional and social conditions affecting the development, and the nature, of private entrepreneurship. In particular, under condi-tions of insufficient construction of the institutional framework of the market, and lack of prevention and punishment of fraudulent behaviour and self-dealing, the development of entrepreneurship can be derailed into unproductive and destructive forms, according to Baumol’s distinction, with dire economic and social consequences. The different outcomes of the transition process may also be explained through the different preconditions affecting the severity of the specific impediments encountered in development of entrepreneurship. Some policy suggestions for speeding up this development, both in quantitative and qualitative terms, conclude the paper. Key words: employment institutions, entrepreneurship, transition 1...|$|R
40|$|Objective: The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to analyse, evaluate and compare the individual methods of Czechoslovak and Czech <b>privatisation</b> in <b>the</b> years 1991 - 2005 based on long-term economic indicators. Research Design & Methods: The empirical research focuses on a sample of 60 companies privatised between 1991 and 2005 which were selected from the list of 3500 large-scale privatised firms in the Czech Republic by the National Property Fund of the Czech Republic and divided into three groups. Findings: The expenditures associated with <b>the</b> large-scale <b>privatisation</b> were covered by the revenues from the sales of property. Based on data analyses, it may be inferred that the best results have been reported by companies sold directly to foreign investors, while lower for voucher privatisation and direct sales to specific domestic investors. Implications & Recommendations: <b>The</b> <b>privatisation</b> <b>processes</b> aimed at selecting such owners that would have the capacity required to timely complete the subsequent restructuring process and to set up such procedures that would secure continued operation of the enterprises. The revenues from the sold property is a secondary criterion subordinated to the primary objective. Contribution & Value Added: The originality of this work lies in studying the main steps undertaken as part of <b>the</b> so-called large-scale <b>privatisation,</b> after nearly a quarter of a century, and its measurable impacts on the domestic economic environment Article type: research pape...|$|R
