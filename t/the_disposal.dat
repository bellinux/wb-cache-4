5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Disposals</b> Commission's {{activities}} peaked during 1946 and 1947. Sales generally went {{smoothly and}} {{in accordance with}} the principles set by the Government and did not significantly disrupt normal commerce. While the Commission generally operated efficiently, some mistakes occurred such as clothing and scrap metal being sold well beneath their market value. The volume of sales dropped rapidly after 1947 and <b>the</b> <b>Disposals</b> Commission was disbanded in July 1949. By this time the commission had sold £135,189,000 worth of equipment.|$|R

5|$|Preparations for <b>the</b> <b>disposal</b> of {{equipment}} {{began in the}} second half of 1944 when the War Cabinet directed the military to survey all stocks and indicate any surpluses. General Thomas Blamey, the Commander-in-Chief of the Army, hindered these preparations as he believed they were premature and that the Army's stocks needed to be maintained until Japan was defeated. This position was opposed by the acting Minister for the Army, and the RAAF and RAN made some attempts to identify their surpluses, but was successful in delaying <b>the</b> <b>Disposal</b> Commission's work until July 1945. As a result, relatively little military equipment was sold between September 1944 and June 1945.|$|E

5|$|In 1917–18 the 12-pounder AA gun {{mounted on}} the aft {{superstructure}} {{was moved to the}} roof of the forward 9.2-inch gun turret and a fire-control system was installed with a director mounted on a platform fitted to the foremast.

40|$|In the Republic of Slovenia {{there are}} five larger sites {{polluted}} with heavy metals. The largest one is <b>the</b> waste <b>disposal</b> site of <b>the</b> lead and zinc mine {{in the northern part}} of the country, and the second one is the waste and tailings <b>disposal</b> site of <b>the</b> world second largest mercury mine. Both mines are now closed. The other three sites are smaller from those described above and they are: <b>the</b> tailings <b>disposal</b> site of <b>the</b> uranium mine, <b>the</b> waste <b>disposal</b> site of <b>the</b> ironworks and <b>the</b> waste <b>disposal</b> site of <b>the</b> aluminum processing plant. The article will present up-to-date data on the quantities of disposed wastes as well as measurements of some parameters connected with harmful effects on the environment and human health. Hazardous heavy metals from mines are monitored in the soil, flowing waters, groundwater and in the air. In some cases they are also monitored in some vegetables and human tissues and organs. The results of blood analysis for the content of heavy metals for mine workers and general population will be presented for two mining towns. On the largest sites, i. e. <b>the</b> waste <b>disposal</b> site of <b>the</b> lead and zinc mine and <b>the</b> waste <b>disposal</b> site of <b>the</b> mercury mine, some remediation activities are being in progress. The results will be presented in graphs and tables...|$|R

5|$|Nuclear {{reactors}} produce mostly, {{among the}} berkelium isotopes, berkelium-249. During the storage {{and before the}} fuel disposal, most of it beta decays to californium-249. The latter has a half-life of 351 years, which is relatively long {{when compared to the}} other isotopes produced in the reactor, and is therefore undesirable in <b>the</b> <b>disposal</b> products.|$|E

5|$|Americium is {{produced}} mostly artificially in small quantities, for research purposes. A tonne of {{spent nuclear fuel}} contains about 100grams of various americium isotopes, mostly 241Am and 243Am. Their prolonged radioactivity is undesirable for <b>the</b> <b>disposal,</b> and therefore americium, together with other long-lived actinides, must be neutralized. The associated procedure may involve several steps, where americium is first separated and then converted by neutron bombardment in special reactors to short-lived nuclides. This procedure is well known as nuclear transmutation, {{but it is still}} being developed for americium. The transuranic elements from americium to fermium occurred naturally in the natural nuclear fission reactor at Oklo, but no longer do so.|$|E
5|$|Americium often enters {{landfills}} from discarded smoke detectors. The rules {{associated with}} <b>the</b> <b>disposal</b> of smoke detectors are relaxed in most jurisdictions. In 1994, 17-year-old David Hahn extracted the americium from about 100 smoke detectors {{in an attempt}} to build a breeder nuclear reactor. There have been a few cases of exposure to americium, the worst case being that of chemical operations technician Harold McCluskey, who at the age of 64 was exposed to 500 times the occupational standard for americium-241 {{as a result of an}} explosion in his lab. McCluskey died at the age of 75 of unrelated pre-existing disease.|$|E
