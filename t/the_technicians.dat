5|$|To reduce {{rolling and}} {{increase}} stability for aircraft operations, a gyrostabilizer {{produced by the}} American Sperry Gyroscope Company was installed.

5|$|Owing to the 1960s {{setting of}} The Secret Service, Derek Meddings and <b>the</b> <b>technicians</b> {{of the special}} effects {{department}} received few commissions for scale models of vehicles that appeared futuristic. This left Unwin's vintage Ford Model T, Gabriel, as their main project, in addition to rendering vehicles and settings common to the decade in miniature and producing the optical enlargement and miniaturisation effects for the character of Harding. Wag Evans manufactured a full-size and two miniature versions (the last of differing scales) of Gabriel, fitting the larger car with belt-driven electric motors, a folding roof, upholstered interior, and a remote control mechanism.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>technicians</b> {{start the}} washing process immediately, since delay can cause {{fermentation}} of the sugary coating surrounding the bean and ruination {{of the coffee}} flavour. The beans are first thrown into a deep tank. The best cherries sink {{to the bottom and}} pass through a machine that removes their skin. <b>The</b> <b>technicians</b> remove any floating cherries and process them {{in the same way as}} the others for the cooperative to sell on the domestic market for less than specialty-coffee price. The beans are fed through one of the cooperative's three de-skinning and selection machines to remove their skins and most of the sugary coating before running the individual beans through a vibrating colander. The colander separates the very highest quality Grade A beans from those labeled Grade B; the two grades are sent separately down the hill in a water chute with a 1 percent gradient. This process allows for further separation of beans based on quality, with around 15 tanks available at the bottom for capture of the different types. The beans are kept submerged, two days for the best and 15–20 hours for the lesser beans, which causes a small amount of fermentation to convert the remainder of the sugar without significantly impairing the flavour.|$|E
40|$|The role of <b>the</b> Senior Clinical <b>Technician</b> is {{multifaceted}} {{and includes}} the efficient running of skills laboratories, while maintaining and servicing serviceable equipment. The role of <b>the</b> <b>technician</b> has developed {{with the advancement}} of iStan and METI products allowing for support of national trends, flexibility in curriculum development {{and the introduction of}} new skills for <b>the</b> <b>technician.</b> <b>The</b> integration of iStan into simulation laboratories and the facilitation of simulated practice has had a two-fold impact upon the team. First, by a reduction in facilitator manpower and secondly, by providing a development opportunity to <b>the</b> <b>technician.</b> These changes have resulted in heightened job satisfaction for <b>the</b> <b>technician</b> through observing <b>the</b> change in the nature of student learning and the benefits they are gaining from simulated practice...|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>technician</b> {{traditionally}} {{used their}} mouth {{to provide the}} precise pressures required to seal it to the cell. In addition to controlling <b>the</b> pressure, <b>the</b> <b>technician</b> must also position the pipette at precisely the correct distance from the cell so that the membrane will seal with it. Using a micromanipulator, the pipette is moved towards the cell until <b>the</b> <b>technician</b> sees {{a change in the}} electrical resistance between the fluid inside of the pipette and the surrounding fluid (see animation). This typically requires 3-12 months of training before a technician is able to reliably record from cells. <b>The</b> <b>technician</b> is essentially performing a balancing act trying to watch and manipulate several systems simultaneously (motion, pressure, and electrical signals). Unless each portion of the process is performed accurately and with the right timing, the seal will not be formed properly and <b>the</b> <b>technician</b> will have to replace the pipette and start over.|$|R
50|$|Traditional {{computer}} {{support was}} delivered either {{by a person}} physically attending the premises where a computer was located or over <b>the</b> telephone with <b>technicians</b> on one end talking customers {{through a series of}} information gathering which was then relayed to <b>the</b> <b>technician</b> so that <b>the</b> <b>technician</b> could propose a solution which they would then talk the customer through implementing.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>technicians</b> {{then move}} the beans to the {{technical}} centre in nearby Kizi. Certain machines, {{housed in a}} warehouse {{up the side of}} the hill, remove the parchment skins from the beans. Employees take the beans into the adjacent laboratory for the final quality control process – hand sorting – which is carried out by several experienced women. The beans are bagged and labeled according to their quality, and stored in the compound's warehouse to await sale.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>technicians</b> {{wash the}} beans {{several times to}} remove {{the remains of the}} skin and coating and put them out on shaded racks to dry. Cooperative {{employees}} turn the beans regularly as technicians spot and remove bad beans. A longer drying process of up to two weeks in the sun follows (with provision for quick covering in the event of rain), again with constant turning. This last process reduces the water content of the bean from 40 percent to 12 percent.|$|E
5|$|When the {{air-cooled}} X-10 Graphite Reactor at Oak Ridge went critical on 4 November 1943, Fermi {{was on hand}} just in {{case something}} went wrong. <b>The</b> <b>technicians</b> woke him early {{so that he could}} see it happen. Getting X-10 operational was another milestone in the plutonium project. It provided data on reactor design, training for DuPont staff in reactor operation, and produced the first small quantities of reactor-bred plutonium. Fermi became an American citizen in July 1944, the earliest date the law allowed.|$|E

5|$|From 1962-70, {{he worked}} as a {{technician}} at the Chester Beatty cancer research laboratory in Fulham, looking after animals used in experimentation. Most of <b>the</b> <b>technicians</b> were socialists, and Livingstone helped found a branch of the Association of Scientific, Technical and Managerial Staffs to fight redundancies imposed by company bosses. Livingstone's leftist views solidified upon the election of Labour Prime Minister Harold Wilson in 1964. With a friend from Chester Beatty, Livingstone toured West Africa in 1966, visiting Algeria, Niger, Nigeria, Lagos, Ghana and Togo. Interested in the region's wildlife, Livingstone rescued an infant ostrich from being eaten, donating it to Lagos children's zoo. Returning home, he took part in several protest marches {{as a part of the}} anti-Vietnam War movement, becoming increasingly interested in politics and briefly subscribing to the publication of a libertarian socialist group, Solidarity.|$|E
5|$|Hearing {{the shark}} has been lured into the pipe, Michael and Kay {{go down to}} repair the {{underwater}} tunnel, so <b>the</b> <b>technicians</b> can restore air pressure and drain the water. Calvin orders the pump {{to be shut down}} to suffocate the shark, but this act instead allows her to break free from the pipe and attack Michael and Kay, but they are saved by the dolphins. They make their way back to the control room, but the shark appears {{in front of the window}} and smashes through the glass, flooding the room and killing a technician. Michael notices FitzRoyce's corpse still in the shark's throat with a grenade, and uses a bent pole to pull its pin, triggering the grenade's explosion and killing the shark. In the aftermath, Mike and Kay celebrate with the dolphins, who survived their brush with the shark.|$|E
5|$|The main {{harvesting}} {{season for}} coffee in Rwanda is during the major rainy season, running from March {{to the end}} of May. At harvest time, farmers spend most of the day picking cherries by hand. In the evening, they carry them in traditional baskets woven from banana leaves to the washing station, which may be several hours away. Technicians hand-sort the beans to pick out the best cherries, those with a deep red colour, and return the remainder to the grower to be sold on to markets outside the Maraba process at a lower price. <b>The</b> <b>technicians</b> pay the grower US$0.10 per kilogram. This money accumulates, and the association pays it each fortnight into farmers' bank accounts.|$|E
50|$|After obtaining {{technical}} school education, an associate degree, or work training, <b>the</b> <b>technician</b> {{may take a}} certification exam. Exam preparation may also be provided by some employers. Examinations are offered by two certifying bodies. The first is <b>the</b> Pharmacy <b>Technician</b> Certification Exam (PTCE), which is offered by <b>the</b> Pharmacy <b>Technician</b> Certification Board (PTCB). The second is the Exam for the Certification of Pharmacy Technician (ExCPT) offered by the National Healthcare Association (NHA). Upon successful completion of the examination, the candidate is granted certification. <b>The</b> <b>technician</b> must then complete continuing education to maintain certification.|$|R
50|$|Next <b>the</b> <b>technician</b> {{performs}} a finished crankshaft grinding procedure. The finished crankshaft grinding {{is a more}} precise grind which reaches the correct OEM specifications. Before <b>the</b> <b>technician</b> starts <b>the</b> crankshaft grinding they should see what crankshaft bearings are available and start from there.

As such, a framework was developed called PARIS (PDA-based Augmented Reality Integrating Speech) that executes entirely on a commercially available PDA equipped with a small camera and wireless support. Real-time computer visionbased techniques are employed for automatically localizing <b>the</b> <b>technician</b> within <b>the</b> plant. Once localized, PARIS offers <b>the</b> <b>technician</b> a seamless multimodal user interface juxtaposing a VRML augmented reality view of the industrial equipment in the immediate vicinity and initiates a context-sensitive VoiceXML speech dialog concerning the equipment.

5|$|As the {{deadline}} of noon approached, set {{the previous day}} {{for the release of}} the Arab prisoners, the police became convinced that the gunmen did not have the capability to carry out their threat of blowing up the embassy, and persuaded Oan to agree to a new deadline of 14:00. The police allowed {{the deadline}} to pass, to no immediate response from the gunmen. During the afternoon, Oan altered his demands, requesting that the British media broadcast a statement of the group's grievances and for ambassadors of three Arab countries to negotiate the group's safe passage out of the UK once the statement had been broadcast. At approximately 20:00, Oan became agitated by noises coming from the Ethiopian Embassy next door. The noise came from technicians who were drilling holes in the wall to implant listening devices, but PC Trevor Lock, when asked to identify the sound, attributed it to mice. COBRA decided to create ambient noise to cover the sound created by <b>the</b> <b>technicians</b> and instructed British Gas to commence drilling in an adjacent road, supposedly to repair a gas main. The drilling was aborted after it agitated the gunmen, and instead British Airports Authority, owner of London Heathrow Airport, was told to instruct approaching aircraft to fly over the embassy at low altitude.|$|E
5|$|Six {{visual effects}} {{companies}} worked in The Rise of Cobra, {{the most prominent}} being Digital Domain, which handled the Paris action sequences and the opening convoy sequence. For the Eiffel Tower destruction, special software was written for depicting how the crumbling metal works. To create the digital Eiffel Tower, <b>the</b> <b>technicians</b> {{had access to the}} original building plans, and built a digital model so complex that it could not fit in a single computer file. For the nanomites, designers used two proprietary software applications for their depiction—one made by Digital Domain, and another by Prime Focus VFX, which also created tools to generate 3D cloud and sky environments for the aerial scenes. Many scenarios were almost fully developed by computer-generated imagery, such as the landing platform of the Pit, the Cobra ice caverns, and the final underwater battle. As for the sound effects themselves, only one is considered popular and isn't instantly recognizable. When the pulse cannon fires upon the main submarine during the polar assault, the sound of a program de-resolution from the 1982 cult movie classic TRON can be heard.|$|E
5|$|The Army sent Fitch to the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos Laboratory in New Mexico. By mid-1944, about a {{third of}} <b>the</b> <b>technicians</b> at Los Alamos were from the SED. While there, he met many of the greats of physics {{including}} Niels Bohr, James Chadwick, Enrico Fermi, Isidor Isaac Rabi, Bruno Rossi, Emilio Segrè, Edward Teller and Richard C. Tolman, in some cases attending courses on physics taught by them. He worked in the group headed by Ernest Titterton, a member of the British Mission, and became well-acquainted with the techniques of experimental physics. He participated in the drop testing of mock atomic bombs that was conducted at Wendover Army Air Field and the Salton Sea Naval Auxiliary Air Station, and worked at the Trinity site, where he witnessed the Trinity nuclear test on July 16, 1945. He was discharged from the Army in 1946, but continued to work at Los Alamos as a civilian for another year in order to earn some money. He would briefly return to Los Alamos in 1948.|$|E
