5|$|Shortly {{before the}} game, Maryland head coach Ralph Friedgen placed partial-game {{suspensions}} on seven players who violated the team's pre-bowl curfew. <b>The</b> <b>suspended</b> players were linebackers Moise Fokou, Trey Covington, Antwine Perez, and Derek Drummond, cornerback Jamari McCollough, the quarterback's preferred third-down wide receiver Danny Oquendo, and leading running back Da'Rel Scott. All except Drummond were regular starters. Consequently, {{a much younger}} line-up started for Maryland, including, according to Friedgen, some who {{probably would not have}} seen playing time otherwise.|$|E

5|$|A 1–0 {{victory against}} Coventry City meant Arsenal were five points behind Sheffield Wednesday, who lay in third spot. Arsenal {{continued}} their strong finish {{to the season}} by scoring seven goals {{in the space of}} three days – three away to Norwich City and four at home to Crystal Palace. The team, without <b>the</b> <b>suspended</b> Wright for the trip to Sheffield United came away from Bramall Lane with a point. Arsenal beat Liverpool 4–0 on 21 April 1992, which marked the opposition's biggest defeat in nine years. A draw at Chelsea ended Arsenal's chances of finishing in a UEFA Cup place. Arsenal ended the league campaign with a 5–1 win against Southampton at home. Wright overtook Tottenham striker Gary Lineker as the league's top goalscorer by scoring three on the day which took his total to 29 (24 of those scored for Arsenal) – one more than Lineker.|$|E

5|$|Al-Jamri is {{most notable}} {{for his role}} during the 1990s {{uprising}} in Bahrain.

5|$|Before the kickoff, seven Maryland players, {{including}} six starters, received partial-game suspensions {{for violating the}} team's curfew. Maryland took a quick lead within the first two minutes of play, but repeated errors allowed Nevada to remain competitive and the lead changed hands five times. In the second quarter, Nevada's dual-threat quarterback, Colin Kaepernick, was hobbled by an ankle injury that altered the complexion of the game. Nevertheless, Kaepernick remained in the game for almost its entirety {{and was able to}} scramble for a touchdown. Halfway through the third quarter, Maryland's leading running back, Da'Rel Scott, made his first appearance of the game.

Atlético de Kolkata head coach, Antonio Lopez Habas, meanwhile decided to bench the team's marquee player, Luis García, and instead started Arnal in central midfield.

5|$|During the floods, {{flow through}} the narrow Wallula Gap was {{restricted}} such that water pooled in a temporary lake, Lake Lewis, which formed in the lowlands of the Columbia Plateau. Lake Lewis backflooded up the Yakima, Walla Walla, Touchet and Tucannon River valleys. This flooding lasted {{for a period of}} 4–7 days. In the relatively calm arms of the lake, the slack waters were thick with suspended materials eroded from the scablands above. Some of <b>the</b> <b>suspended</b> materials settled out, creating thick Touchet Formation layers, or rhythmites, which are found throughout these valleys. The larger clasts settled out first, followed by the finer ones. This resulted in layers with graded bedding, or bedding in which the larger particles are at the bottom and the smaller ones are at the top.|$|E
5|$|In April 1190 Baldwin left England with Richard on the Third Crusade. Leading the English advance guard, Baldwin left Marseilles {{ahead of}} Richard {{together}} with Hubert Walter and Ranulf de Glanvill. The group sailed directly to Syria on 5 August 1190. Baldwin delegated {{the administration of}} his spiritualities and temporalities to Gilbert Glanvill, the Bishop of Rochester, but entrusted any archiepiscopal authority to Richard FitzNeal, the Bishop of London. The custom of giving the archiepiscopal authority to London had originated in Archbishop Lanfranc's time. Baldwin continued to conduct some ecclesiastical business however, dealing with <b>the</b> <b>suspended</b> Hugh Nonant, the Bishop of Coventry. Baldwin had suspended Nonant in March 1190 for holding secular office as sheriff, but Baldwin wrote to FitzNeal after his departure that Nonant had agreed to relinquish his secular offices.|$|E

5|$|Regular {{football}} {{improved his}} confidence {{and with it}} his effectiveness. Under Lee Clark, he started regularly but was often substituted; under Gary Rowett, who replaced Clark in late October, he played every minute of Birmingham's league fixtures, usually partnering Stephen Gleeson in a 4–2–3–1 formation, until injuring a knee in mid-February. He missed the 4–3 defeat at Brighton & Hove Albion, in which the local newspaper attributed Birmingham's defensive frailties to his absence. On his return, away at Ipswich Town, his presence achieved more in attack than defence, twice– with a header {{and then with a}} volley– restoring Birmingham to only one goal behind before Ipswich secured a 4–2 win in stoppage time. Rowett signed Nottingham Forest midfielder Robert Tesche on loan on 2 March. Initially he played alongside Davis in place of <b>the</b> <b>suspended</b> Gleeson, and then as part of a three-man midfield, but when Rowett reverted to 4–2–3–1, it was Davis who missed out.|$|E
5|$|A two-man {{committee}} was created {{with the aim}} of working with the Eagle and Washington clubs to resolve the debate over how many players to field in official games. Duncan F. Curry and William F. Ladd were chosen as the committee members, but Ladd withdrew and Adams was named as a substitute. His partner on the committee, Curry, had led the opposition to nine-man teams. Adams and Curry also differed on another issue: the length of games. At the time, a baseball game lasted until one of the teams had 21 runs; that team was awarded the victory. A change in how games were won was deemed necessary after <b>the</b> <b>suspended</b> game in 1854. Adams favored nine-inning games, while Curry wanted contests to last seven innings. A convention was scheduled for early 1857, and Adams joined a three-man committee tasked with encouraging local clubs to send delegates. At the convention, which consisted of one session each in January and February, Adams was voted president. The Knickerbockers had voted among themselves to back seven-inning games, but the other teams backed a motion for nine-inning contests, which passed.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} month of the 2010–11 season, Jovanovski was chosen to serve in place of <b>the</b> <b>suspended</b> Shane Doan as team captain from October 21 to 25, 2010. Over a week later, he {{recorded}} his first career NHL hat-trick in a 4–3 win against the Nashville Predators on November 3. He scored all three goals against goaltender Pekka Rinne, becoming the first Coyotes defenceman to score a hat-trick in team history. On December 26, he became the 256th player in NHL history to play 1,000 career games, reaching the feat against the Dallas Stars. Jovanovski struggled with injuries throughout the season, missing time on six different occasions. His most serious injury was an orbital bone fracture after his face collided with an opposing player's helmet in a game against the Atlanta Thrashers on February 17, 2011. After missing 20 games with the injury, he returned in April for the last three games of the regular season and the playoffs. In Jovanovski's limited time in the season, he recorded 14 points over 50 games. The Coyotes ranked sixth in the West, drawing the Red Wings in the first round for the second consecutive year. Jovanovski recorded one assist in the post-season as the Coyotes were eliminated in four games.|$|E

5|$|It {{was a brief}} stint back in {{the playing}} squad, with Barton banned for six matches, with a further {{suspended}} six-match ban, for his assault on Dabo. After serving his ban, he played 75minutes in a reserve match and {{said he wanted to}} transform his image to become a role model, before he returned to action in the Tyne–Wear derby on 25 October. He was booed by Sunderland fans and had missiles thrown at him as he warmed up, as Newcastle lost 2–1. Without him, Newcastle had not recorded a league victory since the second match of the season, but Barton scored a penalty in his second match back to lift the club out of the relegation zone. <b>The</b> <b>suspended</b> six-match ban was nearly brought into action when Barton appeared to flick Aston Villa striker Gabriel Agbonlahor in the club's next match, but the FA decided not to punish Barton. However, further allegations that Barton had made a racist remark to Agbonlahor were cause enough for the FA to reconsider this decision. The remarks remain unfounded and 'professional lip-readers' claimed he said nothing racist. In Newcastle's 2–2 draw with Wigan on 15 November 2008, Barton was injured after a tackle from Lee Cattermole. It was later confirmed that Barton would be out for two months with a medial ligament injury. Returning to the first team at the end of January, he played only twice before again breaking his metatarsal, during a 2–1 defeat to his old club Manchester City.|$|E
5|$|Mackin {{was born}} in Chester, Cheshire {{and grew up in}} nearby Blacon. He played for Blacon Youth Club in their under-12 team and in the 1997–98 season was named League Player of the Year. He played for {{hometown}} club Chester City as a schoolboy before moving to Wrexham on the same basis at the age of 15. He progressed through their youth system and captained them in an FA Youth Cup match against Watford. He helped the youth team win a league championship, which resulted in him being given a squad number with the first team. He made his first-team debut at the age of 18 after starting in a 1–1 draw away to Wycombe Wanderers on 1 May 2004, the final match of 2003–04. His first appearance of 2004–05 came as a 50th-minute substitute in a 2–2 away draw with Hull City in the League Cup on 24 August 2004, which Wrexham won 3–1 in a penalty shoot-out. Mackin made his first league appearance of the season in a 5–1 defeat away to Luton Town as a 63rd-minute substitute on 6 November 2005 and his first start came on 11 December in a 3–0 away defeat against Milton Keynes Dons (MK Dons) as a replacement for <b>the</b> <b>suspended</b> Darren Ferguson. He suffered from a sore thigh in January 2005 and made his return as an 88th-minute substitute in a 0–0 home draw with MK Dons on 26 February. He fouled Steve Jenkins inside the penalty area during stoppage time away to Swindon Town on 19 March, which led to Sam Parkin scoring a penalty kick, the final goal in a 4–2 defeat for Wrexham. He finished the season with 11 appearances and signed his first professional contract on 11 July 2005.|$|E
5|$|Merson came {{in place}} of John Jensen in Arsenal's {{starting}} XI, while for Milan Zvonimir Boban replaced <b>the</b> <b>suspended</b> Simone, and Christian Panucci was chosen to stand in for Paolo Maldini. Graham deployed a 4–1–4–1 formation, with Schwarz acting as the lone defensive midfielder and Hartson positioned the furthest forward. Watched by a crowd of 23,953, Milan eased to a 2–0 win {{and in the process}} ended Arsenal's 15-match unbeaten run in Europe. The home side's first goal came minutes before half-time, when Daniele Massaro's defensive-splitting pass found Boban, who scored, despite Schwarz's attempts to hold him back by tugging his shirt. The Croatian forward nearly scored a second, but for Seaman's quick intervention. Up until then, Arsenal had briefly threatened; from a long ball in the 19th minute, Hartson managed to turn Franco Baresi, but scuffed his shot wide. Milan found it easy to contain the opposition, given Desailly and Savićević influenced the tempo of the match. The latter came close to doubling Milan's lead when he broke forward and hit a shot goalwards, only for Seaman to divert the ball round the post. In the second half, Wright thought he had equalised for Arsenal when he tapped the ball in, but the referee disallowed the goal as there was infringement in the build-up. Milan continued to attack and extended their lead soon after; from Savićević's corner, Massaro jumped higher than his marker Lee Dixon and headed the ball into the Arsenal goal. Dixon, who required treatment early in the second half, was substituted for Martin Keown right away as he struggled to play on.|$|E
