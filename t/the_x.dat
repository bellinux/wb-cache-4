5|$|Option C is {{a concept}} in which the current X Division Champion may voluntarily vacate the {{championship}} {{in exchange for a}} World Heavyweight Championship match at that year's Destination X event. It began in June 2012 when then-champion Austin Aries said that he was not satisfied with being just <b>the</b> <b>X</b> Division Champion, which led to then-General Manager Hulk Hogan offering him a match for the World Heavyweight Championship, but only if he first vacated <b>the</b> <b>X</b> Division Championship. Aries agreed to Hogan's terms, on the condition that <b>the</b> <b>X</b> Division Champion be given the same opportunity in future years. Aries would then relinquish <b>the</b> <b>X</b> Division Championship and successfully defeated Bobby Roode for the World title.|$|E

In the noncompetitive situation, with two free 4 's, recognition between <b>the</b> <b>X's</b> remained high despite the modifications, and primary X nondisjunction was low. In the competitive situation, with the compound 4, distributive nondisjunction of <b>the</b> <b>X's</b> increased approximately two orders of magnitude, and trivalent formation was indicated.

5|$|The {{syndrome}} is strongly {{believed to be}} inherited in an X-linked recessive manner. When a female carries a mutated gene {{on one of her}} two copies of <b>the</b> <b>X</b> chromosome, there is a 50% chance of passing the mutation on to her children. Much like her, a daughter inheriting this mutation will be a carrier, but will not herself have the associated disease. However, a son who inherits the mutation will have the disease; this is because males have only one copy of <b>the</b> <b>X</b> chromosome and therefore could only express the disease mutation.|$|E
5|$|Another {{possibility}} is that a gene for aposematism might be recessive and located on <b>the</b> <b>X</b> chromosome.

Well-fed predators might also ignore aposematic morphs, preferring other prey species.|$|E
