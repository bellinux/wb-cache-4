5000|$|Longevity, as {{demonstrated}} in early automotive applications of the Knight engine. Prior to the advent of leaded gasolines, poppet-valve engines typically required grinding of the valves and valve seats after 20,000 to 30,000 miles (32,000 to 48,000 km) of service. Sleeve valves did not suffer from the wear and recession caused by the repetitive impact of the poppet valve against its seat. Sleeve valves were also subjected to less intense heat build-up than poppet valves, owing to their greater area of contact with other metal surfaces. In the Knight engine, carbon build-up actually helped to improve <b>the</b> <b>sealing</b> of <b>the</b> <b>sleeves,</b> the engines being said to [...] "improve with use", in contrast to poppet valve engines, which lose compression and power as valves, valve stems and guides wear. Due to the continuous motion of the sleeve (Burt-McCollum type), the high wear points linked to poor lubrication in the TDC/BDC (bottom dead centre) of piston travel within the cylinder are suppressed, so rings and cylinders lasted much longer.|$|R
5000|$|A [...] "cartridge seal" [...] is a {{prepackaged}} seal that {{is common}} in more complex applications and were originally designed for installation in equipment where a component type seal was difficult due to the equipment design. Examples of this are horizontally split and vertical pumps. In 1975 the A W Chesterton Company designed <b>the</b> first cartridge <b>seal</b> that fit pumps with varying stuffing box bore sizes and gland bolt patterns. To accomplish this <b>the</b> <b>seal</b> utilized internal centering of the stationary parts and slotted bolt holes. This [...] "generic" [...] cartridge seal could be manufactured in higher production quantities resulting in a cartridge seal {{that could be used}} in all applications and pumps types. Cassette seals, patent no. 6,685,191 introduced by Gold Seals, Inc., utilize a replaceable inner [...] "cassette" [...] mounted in the cartridge end plate or gland, while modular cartridge seal systems makes it possible to replace only the parts subject to wear, such as sliding faces, secondary seals and springs, while keeping <b>the</b> <b>seal's</b> hardware (gland, <b>sleeve,</b> bolts).Cartridge <b>seals</b> can suffer from clogging due to the bigger space occupied inside the stuffing box, leading to dense or charged fluids not moving enough to centrifugate the solid particles.|$|R

Based on the {{performance}} of Vane hydraulic damp O-ring seal,simulation about <b>the</b> O-ring <b>seal</b> was applied by nonlinear finite element analysis method. <b>The</b> factors influencing <b>sealing</b> performance are considered, such as initial compressibility, <b>sealing</b> materials.

The finite element analysis method can be effectively used to solve nonlinear material and sealing failure problem for <b>the</b> <b>seal</b> design, optimization and performance analysis, which provide a new approach and theoretical guidance to <b>the</b> rubber <b>seal</b> research. <b>The</b> <b>seal</b> material and compression ratio are both great influence on <b>the</b> <b>sealing</b> performance, which should be based on working conditions to select <b>the</b> appropriate <b>sealing</b> materials...|$|R
