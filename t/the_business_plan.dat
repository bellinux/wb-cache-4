5|$|Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) celebrates his winning of the Vice President {{position}} on a golf outing with Jim Halpert (John Krasinski), Robert California (James Spader), and Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate). After playing, Robert tells Jim that he dislikes <b>the</b> <b>business</b> <b>plan</b> for the Sabre store, citing the poor quality of the products; he only approved it because Jo Bennett wanted it, but he plans to sandbag it at a high-level meeting, and Jim is stunned when Robert strongly hints {{he is going to}} fire Dwight over it. Jim makes several attempts to stop Dwight from attending the meeting with Robert, but Dwight is heedless and continually insults Jim, who finally decides to leave Dwight to his fate. However, a guilt-inducing phone call to Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) makes Jim decide he has to keep parsing Dwight's insults until he directly tells him {{that he is going to}} lose his job. Dwight ignores the news, thinking Jim is jealous of him, so Jim resorts to wrestling with Dwight outside the conference room. In the meantime, Nellie has Todd Packer (David Koechner) stand in as VP in Dwight's absence. When Dwight makes it into the conference room, he hears Robert planning to fire the VP, so he sneaks out of the conference room and lets Packer take the fall in front of those present. Dwight then silently extends a hand to Jim, and they head back to Scranton with Stanley Hudson (Leslie David Baker), who has reverted to his old grumpy self over the thought of leaving Florida.|$|E
5|$|The series {{production}} of the T-26, equipped with new higher turrets with observation window, began in August 1931. Such turrets {{proved to be more}} suitable for mass production. The {{production of the}} T-26 encountered many problems: a lot of armoured hulls and turrets supplied by the Izhora Factory were of low quality (with cracks) and were 10mm thick instead of the planned 13mm. Poor production standards were the reason behind the frequent failures of tank engines, gear boxes, springs in suspension, tracks and rubber-covered road wheels of early T-26s. Thirty-five of the 100 T-26s produced by the Bolshevik Factory in 1931 had hulls and turrets made from mild steel. Later, it was planned to replace these hulls with ones built of armour plate as well as to mount engines of better quality. <b>The</b> <b>business</b> <b>plan</b> for 1932 called for 3,000 T-26s. For this, the tank workshop of the Bolshevik Factory was reorganised into the Factory No. 174 named after K.E. Voroshilov in February 1932. The director of the tank factory became K. Sirken and the chief engineer was S. Ginzburg. The problems with organizing the complicated new technological processes, poor production planning of parts suppliers, a great shortage of qualified engineers and technicians as well as of necessary equipment still resulted in many of the tanks being flawed, and they were not accepted by army representatives. On 26 October 1932, the Trust of Special Machine Industry, consisting of four factories, was established {{to solve the problem of}} tank production in the USSR. The planned production of T-26s for 1932 was decreased significantly and special attention was given to increasing the quality of the tanks. A production run of the new model single-turreted T-26 armed with the 45mm gun was launched in mid-1933.|$|E

40|$|Abstract It is {{valuable}} in large organization with multiple hierarchical levels {{that the general}} goals are communicated {{at all levels of}} the organization. Organizations usually have an overall <b>business</b> <b>plan,</b> which should serve as a guide and indicate the organization’s direction. Middle managers have an important part in communicating <b>the</b> overall <b>business</b> <b>plan</b> since they are a link between upper management and employees.   The purpose of this study was to examine how middle managers, in their role as a link between upper management and employees, communicate <b>the</b> overall <b>business</b> <b>plan.</b> <b>The</b> study was conducted at the County council in Värmland, which represents a large hierarchical organization. <b>The</b> overall <b>business</b> <b>plan</b> was landstingplanen. <b>The</b> theoretical framework used was primarily theories and previous research in organizational communication, communicative leadership and communication and structure. Eight middle managers were selected through a variety selection. The eight respondents were interviewed to examine in what way they are communicating and establishing the County council's overall <b>business</b> <b>plan.</b>   <b>The</b> results showed that <b>the</b> overall <b>business</b> <b>plan</b> is established and communicated in the different levels of the organization since it is broken down in two steps. <b>The</b> overall <b>business</b> <b>plan</b> functions as a support and gives guidance in how to accomplish the goals that are conveyed. The balanced scorecard that is a part of <b>the</b> overall <b>business</b> <b>plan</b> fills an important role in what middle management choose to priorities and communicate to their employees. However, the results indicated that the general formulation in <b>the</b> overall <b>business</b> <b>plan</b> resulted in a relatively free interpretation among the middle managers. Furthermore, the results showed that the attitudes against the County council’s vision among the respondents were fairly negative. The results also indicated that the middle managers are operating from a communicative leadership in communicating <b>the</b> overall <b>business</b> <b>plan</b> to their employees, but for this to be realized there must be a communicative empowerment.  The results also showed that discrepancy between the upper management and the employees was perceived as large, which may obstruct the middle managers to establish <b>the</b> overall <b>business</b> <b>plan...</b>|$|R
