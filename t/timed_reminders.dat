40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we discuss our work on plan {{management}} in the Autominder cognitive orthotic system. Autominder is being designed {{as part of an}} initiative on the development of robotic assistants for the elderly. Autominder stores and updates user plans, tracks their execution via input from robot sensors, and provides carefully chosen and <b>timed</b> <b>reminders</b> of the activities to be performed. It will eventually also learn the typical behavior of the user with regard to the execution of these plans. A central component of Autominder is its Plan Manager (PM), which is responsible for the temporal reasoning involved in updating plans and tracking their execution. The PM models plan update problems as disjunctive temporal problems (DTPs) and uses the Epilitis DTPsolving system to handle them. We describe the plan representations and algorithms used by the Plan Manager, and briefly discuss its connections {{with the rest of the}} system. ...|$|E
40|$|In today’s society, {{the most}} common {{way for people to}} search for job {{opportunities}} is by using the internet on their personal electronic device, whether it be a laptop, desktop, tablet, or mobile phone. There are hundreds of websites and mobile applications catering to all kinds of career services in a plethora of fields. One specific sector of employment that is rather unique is the creative field. Creative positions are posted on their own websites like Behance, AIGA, Coroflot, etc. Since these niche websites exist, there are also hundreds of articles discussing how creative individuals approach the job searching process. Each industry has a different protocol {{when it comes to the}} hiring process; that which creatives, in my personal opinion, go through a rather intensive process in order to get that desired job. Not only does it require an interview, but a designed resume and cover letter, a portfolio, and an impress piece (among other things). While creatives search and apply for these jobs, they are most likely finishing up their collegiate career or working full-time. It can be difficult and tedious to keep up with each application and remembering the status of each job applied, especially trying to remember which website you found XYZ job posted on. It is up to the individual to create their own method for keeping track, whether it be an Excel spreadsheet, text document, or using their Email history and labeling folders for each company. Regardless, these methods can fail due to the individual simply not keeping up and checking in frequently. This can result to not becoming employed by a date when the user wants to ideally be employed by and losing opportunity. I searched to see if there was a universally available system currently accessible to the public to prevent that from happening; there was not. The objective of this thesis was to establish the systematic function of a mobile application and website pairing that will act as a guide/tool to aid graduating creatives and individuals already working in the creative field. This tool would have made the job search process easier by organizing all job postings of interest in one location (similar to a Pinterest-type of database), keeping track of all job applications, and automatically sending appropriately <b>timed</b> <b>reminders</b> via push notifications to the user while prompting the user’s actions through Q 2 ̆ 6 A/informative directions, rather than simply demanding an action through directions...|$|E

40|$|Introduction Drug-related {{problems}} (DRPs) {{are a major}} {{burden on}} healthcare systems. Once detected, the resolution of these DRPs {{has the potential to}} reduce healthcare costs and improve patient outcomes. Community pharmacists are ideally placed to detect and prevent DRPs, with the resolution of a DRP being termed a clinical intervention. Aims Utilising an electronic documentation system, the aim of this project was to determine the number and nature of DRPs detected and clinical interventions performed by Australian community pharmacists. The project also aimed to identify the pharmacy and pharmacist factors that influenced the frequency with which clinical interventions were both performed and documented. Methods An electronic documentation system was designed and integrated into the existing dispensing software of 186 pharmacies in three States of Australia (NSW, Victoria and Tasmania) to allow pharmacists to record details about the clinical interventions they performed in order to prevent or resolve DRPs. Participating pharmacies were randomly allocated to three groups: Group One had documentation software; Group Two had documentation software plus a <b>timed</b> <b>reminder</b> to document interventions; and Group Three had documentation software, <b>timed</b> <b>reminder</b> and an electronic decision support prompt. Pharmacists were trained {{in the use of the}} software system and also completed several surveys gathering information about demographics, professional attitude, personality traits and clinical knowledge. Pharmacists classified DRPs, entered recommendations they made, and estimated the clinical significance of the intervention. An observational sub-study, which included 24 pharmacies without any documentation software, was also completed to determine current practice. Results Over 12 weeks, 531 participating pharmacists dispensed 2, 013, 923 prescriptions for 483, 147 patients and documented 6, 230 interventions, resulting in a median intervention rate of 2. 4 interventions in 1000 prescriptions or 0. 24...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{main purpose}} of this paper was to develop an online {{examination}} system suitable for both Academic and Non-Academic examinations. Prior to start the design and development of the system three online examination systems were analyzed to make the newly developed system more flexible and user friendly in the context of Bangladesh. Three Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs) and one E-R diagram have been developed to represent the whole system. Different features of the online examination system are discussed in this paper. The features include user’s registration, examination instruction, valid time of examination, <b>time</b> <b>reminder,</b> submission of the answer script, and release of the examination results. The system enables the admin or super admin to create a test from a question bank that comprises different subject areas. Testing of the system is done with ten users with a test that included 20 questions from four subject areas such as Bangla, English, General Knowledge, and Science and Technology.

40|$|This study {{examined}} {{the amount of time}} spent on pretest and operational items that are answered correctly and incorrectly by different ability examinees when taking a computerized adaptive test (CAT). Consistent with other research, the results indicate that higher ability examinees spend more time than lower ability examinees on all items, regardless of whether the items are tailored to their ability level (operational items) or not (pretest items). It was expected, based on the literature, that examinees would spend more time on test questions they answered incorrectly than correctly. This was the case for most of the items, but not the ones near the end of the CAT, suggesting that examinees may not have sufficient time or motivation to devote to these items. ^ Seven testing fairness issues related to a CAT were addressed along with recommendations. Five test-taking strategies derived from the results were provided to help ensure testing fairness. The presence of pretesting was found either to benefit or hinder examinees depending on their ability levels due to disproportionate amounts of time and effort used by these examinees with different ability levels on these items. Generally, examinees with lower ability levels have more time remaining after they finish the test than do examinees with higher ability levels. ^ A design feature for a CAT that uses a time management wizard, <b>time</b> <b>reminder,</b> and pacing guidance to help examines to move through a test was proposed for future development. Finally, several recommendations to ensure testing fairness were provided for the future examiners’ manual. ...|$|R

Multi-level approaches which engage multiple school stakeholders have been recommended but few studies have documented their effects.

Parents and teachers were distributed a brief screening questionnaire as a first step for recruitment to a longitudinal study, with two cohorts recruited in consecutive years (cohort 1 2011, cohort 2 2012). For cohort 2, additional engagement strategies included the use of pre-notification postcards, improved study materials, and recruitment progress graphs provided to school staff. Chi-square and t-tests were used to examine cohort differences. Compared to cohort 1, a higher proportion of cohort 2 parents responded to the survey (76 % versus 69 %; p < 0. 001), consented to participate (71 % versus 56 %; p < 0. 001), agreed to teacher participation (90 % versus 82 %; p < 0. 001) and agreed to follow-up contact (91 % versus 80 %; p < 0. 001). Fewer cohort 2 parents required reminders (52 % versus 63 %; p < 0. 001), and cohort 2 parents responded more promptly than cohort 1 parents (mean difference: 19. 4 days, 95 % CI: 18. 0 to 20. 9, p < 0. 001).

40|$|Background: Successful {{recruitment}} and retention of participants into research studies is critical for optimising internal and external validity. Research into diet and lifestyle of young women is important due to the physiological transitions experienced at this life stage. This paper aims to evaluate data related to {{recruitment and}} retention across three research studies with young women, and present practical advice related to recruiting and retaining young women in order to optimise study quality within nutrition research. Methods: Recruitment and retention strategies used in three nutrition studies that targeted young women (18 to 35 years) were critiqued. A randomised controlled trial (RCT), a crossover validation study and a cross-sectional survey were conducted at the University of Newcastle, Australia between 2010 and 2013 Successful recruitment was defined as maximum recruitment relative to time. Retention was assessed as maximum participants remaining enrolled at study completion. Results: Recruitment approaches included notice boards, web and social network sites (Facebook and Twitter), with social media most successful in recruitment. The online survey had the highest recruitment in the shortest time-frame (751 participants in one month). Email, phone and text message were used in study one (RCT) and study two (crossover validation) and assisted in low attrition rates, with 93 % and 75. 7 % completing the RCT and crossover validation study respectively. Of {{those who did not}} complete the RCT, reported reasons were: being too busy; and having an unrelated illness. Conclusion: Recruiting young women into nutrition research is challenging. Use of social media enhances recruitment, while Email, phone and text message contact improves retention within interventions. Further research comparing strategies to optimise {{recruitment and retention}} in young women, including flexible testing <b>times,</b> <b>reminders</b> and incentives is warranted...|$|R

30|$|The first {{question}} asks about the students’ belief on the helpfulness of the C-DA in improving their reading abilities. Forty-two participants out of 46 (i.e., 91 %) {{thought that the}} testing format was beneficial in improving their reading abilities, while 4 students held a negative view. The reason why the four students thought the procedure was not helpful is mainly {{because they could not}} read the questions first in the procedure, which they thought hindered their pace in completing the task. One student wrote that “To read more is the most important in improving reading abilities [regardless of what kind of format it is].” 4 For those who were positive towards the C-DA format, the reasons can be classified into five categories—increase of reading pace and better concentration, usefulness of mediations, vocabulary learning, convenience for reading, and others. The first two categories dominate students’ reflections, accounting for 93 % of all the reasons. Forty-eight percent (20 / 42) of the students reported that the C-DA format, especially the <b>time</b> <b>reminder</b> showing how much time left for each item, can help them better concentrate on the test and increase their reading pace. Forty-five percent (19 / 42) of the students thought that the mediations are useful facilitators, which, as they further explained, guided them to locate the key information in the original passage where the correct answer can be found, helped them find out the reasons why they made mistakes, motivated them to think actively during the process, and gave them chances to try again. One student wrote that “When I was prompted that I was wrong, I did it again and found some details I missed in the first try. I got it right then. This kind of experience gave me a happy feeling of gains.” Another student explained that “The mediations and the explanations of the correct answer can assist me to clarify my misunderstandings of the text immediately and guide me to think on the right track, through which I think I won’t make the same mistakes next time.” For the other reasons, students indicated that this kind of format was interesting, convenient for reading, and useful for vocabulary learning.|$|R

However, memories reactivated by reminder are once again vulnerable, in a time-dependent manner, to amnestic treatment. To determine whether the metabolic events following a reminder recapitulate those following initial training we examined the temporal dynamics of amnesia induced by the protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin and the glycosylation inhibitor 2 -deoxygalactose. The effects of both were transient and dependent on <b>time</b> of <b>reminder</b> post-training and <b>time</b> of injection relative to reminder, and differed from those following initial training. 2 -[C- 14]-deoxyglucose uptake increased in two brain regions, the intermediate medial hyperstriatum ventrale (IMHV) and lobus parolfactorius (LPO) following reminder as it did following training, but the increase was bilateral rather than confined to the left hemisphere and was more marked in LPO than IMHV. C-fos expression after reminder was increased only in the LPO, the chick brain region associated with a late phase of memory processing and recall. Thus although, like initial consolidation, memory processing after reminder is sensitive to inhibitors of protein synthesis and glycosylation, the temporal and pharmacological dynamics indicate differences between these two processes...|$|R
