He stood with his heels almost {{together}} and the toes of his left foot pointing toward extra cover, which left him open-chested when facing the bowler. A noticeable flourish in his backlift enabled him to follow the swinging delivery and play it late if necessary. His first movement was back and across the crease to cover the stumps from the view of the bowler, putting him in position to play the hook, leg glance, sweep and his favourite square cut shot.|$|E

25|$|The compás is {{fundamental}} to flamenco. Compás is most often translated as rhythm but it demands far more precise interpretation than any other Western style of music. If there is no guitarist available, the compás is rendered through hand clapping (palmas) or by hitting a table with <b>the</b> <b>knuckles.</b> The guitarist uses techniques like strumming (rasgueado) or tapping the soundboard (golpe). Changes of chords emphasize the most important downbeats.|$|E
25|$|An ASL prefix, (touching the chin), is {{used with}} number signs to {{indicate}} 'years old'. The prefix completely assimilates {{with the initial}} handshape of the number. For instance, 'fourteen' is signed with a B hand that bends several times at <b>the</b> <b>knuckles.</b> The chin-touch prefix in 'fourteen years old' is thus also made with a B hand. For 'three years old', however, the prefix is made with a 3 hand.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{investigated}} the brittle fracture mechanism of a grade E cast steel knuckle {{that is one}} of the key components of the coupler for railway wagon by using scanning electronic microscope, optical microscope, energy dispersive spectroscopy as well as mechanical property testing methods. It is found that large amounts of developed coarse dendrites and shrinkage porosity existed in <b>the</b> <b>knuckle's</b> microstructure, <b>the</b> plasticity and impact toughness of <b>the</b> <b>knuckle</b> entity are very bad and far below that of the Keel block represented this <b>knuckle.</b> Apparently, <b>the</b> shrinkage porosity resulted in <b>the</b> <b>knuckle</b> unsound metallic matrix and poor mechanical properties. The fracture morphology mainly shows the characteristic of cleavage, quasi-cleavage fracture as well as a little ductile fracture, so the failure of <b>the</b> <b>knuckle</b> can be attributed to brittle fracture distinctly. Moreover, a welding repair area with high hardness is also found in the fracture region, which might initiate micro-cracks on the surface of <b>the</b> <b>knuckle.</b> As a result, it can be inferred that under an impact load that did not exceed material fracture limit, the micro-cracks initiated from weld repair zone propagated rapidly into the inner matrix by continuously fracturing the dendrites along shrinkage porosity regions until <b>the</b> <b>knuckle</b> failed instantly...|$|R

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>knuckles</b> of {{the four}} fingers of one's hand and the spaces between them {{can be used to}} {{remember}} the lengths of the months. By making a fist, each month will be listed as one proceeds across the hand. All months landing on a knuckle are 31 days long and those landing between them are not. When the knuckle of the index finger is reached (July), go back to the first knuckle (or over to the first knuckle on the other fist, held next to the first) and continue with August. This physical mnemonic has been taught to primary school students for many decades.|$|E
25|$|One of {{a number}} of {{different}} grips is illustrated to the right. Essentially {{the only difference is that}} the middle and index fingers are split and come down on each side of the seam. This causes more drag on the ball as it leaves the hand, slowing down the delivery. Slower balls are also bowled by using the off break grip and finger action used by off spinners. A slower delivery may also be achieved – less commonly – by using a leg spin grip and wrist action or by supporting the upper aspect of the ball with only one finger or with <b>the</b> <b>knuckles.</b>|$|E
25|$|Also {{known as}} a Janney coupler and the buckeye coupler, <b>the</b> <b>knuckle</b> coupler is <b>the</b> {{derivative}} of a coupling device that links and connects rolling railway cars such as passenger, refrigerator, freight, and stock cars together on railroad track. <b>The</b> <b>knuckle</b> coupler have a bifurcated drawhead and a revolving hook, which, when brought in contact with another coupler, automatically interlocks with its mate. <b>Knuckle</b> couplers replaced <b>the</b> much more dangerous link-and-pin couplers and {{became the basis for}} standard coupler design {{for the rest of the}} 19th century. <b>The</b> <b>knuckle</b> coupler was invented and patented by Eli H. Janney in 1873.|$|R
50|$|Locomotives {{and some}} freight cars of the Indian Railways are {{fitted with a}} 'transition coupler' that {{incorporates}} a screw coupling within a <b>knuckle</b> coupler: <b>the</b> <b>knuckle</b> coupler remains in position and does not swing away when not in use. The screw coupling is mounted on a hinge {{on the opposite side}} of <b>the</b> <b>knuckle</b> coupler. Most Indian freight cars use <b>the</b> <b>knuckle</b> coupler alone, without buffers, whereas passenger coaches almost exclusively use screw couplers and buffers. Exceptions are the new LHB coaches imported from Europe, and a few other makes of carriages converted to use knuckle couplers.|$|R

25|$|Bulimia nervosa, {{also known}} as simply bulimia, is an eating {{disorder}} characterized by binge eating followed by purging. Binge eating refers to eating {{a large amount of}} food in a short amount of time. Purging refers to the attempts {{to get rid of the}} food consumed. This may be done by vomiting or taking laxatives. Other efforts to lose weight may include the use of diuretics, stimulants, water fasting, or excessive exercise. Most people with bulimia are at a normal weight. The forcing of vomiting may result in thickened skin on <b>the</b> <b>knuckles</b> and breakdown of the teeth. Bulimia is frequently associated with other mental disorders such as depression, anxiety, and problems with drugs or alcohol. There is also a higher risk of suicide and self-harm.|$|E
25|$|In March 2009, EA {{launched}} a Facebook app, called The Godfather II: Crime Rings to help promote the game.

Players were randomly placed {{into one of the}} five families from the game (Corleone, Rosato, Granados, Mangano and Almeida) upon joining the app. In early April, EA sent out brass knuckles to game journalists to promote the game. However, brass knuckles are illegal to own in several states. Realizing their mistake, EA requested everyone who received <b>the</b> <b>knuckles</b> return them. On April 9, EA opened a space for The Godfather II on the PlayStation 3's online service PlayStation Home. The space offered users five poker tables for No Limit Texas hold 'em, with promotional videos and concept art available for viewing.|$|E

Griswold, however, was paid more and given more editorial control of the magazine than Poe. Shortly after, Poe began presenting a series of lectures called [...] "The Poets and Poetry of America", {{the first of which}} was given in Philadelphia on November 25, 1843. Poe openly attacked Griswold in front of his large audience and continued to do so in similar lectures. Graham said that during these lectures, Poe [...] "gave Mr. Griswold some raps over <b>the</b> <b>knuckles</b> of force sufficient to be remembered". In a letter dated January 16, 1845, Poe tried to reconcile with Griswold, promising him that his lecture now omitted all that Griswold found objectionable.|$|E
