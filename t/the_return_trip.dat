5|$|On <b>the</b> <b>return</b> <b>trip</b> to Australia, the touring team {{stopped to}} play three Tests against South Africa, the first {{between the two}} nations. Australia won the series two Tests to nil, but Darling's own form was poor. In {{successive}} innings, Darling made 0, 14, 6, 4 and 1. After the tour, he returned to Stonehenge and took a two-year break from first-class cricket. In his absence, Monty Noble captained the Australian team against the touring English in 190304.|$|E

5|$|Sōryūs {{second wave}} {{consisted}} of nine A6M Zeros and seventeen D3As. The former attacked Naval Air Station Kaneohe Bay, losing one Zero to American anti-aircraft guns. On <b>the</b> <b>return</b> <b>trip,</b> the Zero pilots {{claimed to have}} shot down two American aircraft while losing two of their own. The D3As attacked various ships in Pearl Harbor, {{but it is not}} possible to identify which aircraft attacked which ship. Two of them were shot down during the attack.|$|E
5|$|The {{band had}} also {{incurred}} heavy legal {{expenses for the}} Penis Envy prosecution; this, combined with exhaustion and the pressures of living and operating together, finally took its toll. On 7 July 1984, the band played a benefit gig at Aberdare, Wales, for striking miners, and on <b>the</b> <b>return</b> <b>trip</b> guitarist N. A. Palmer announced {{that he intended to}} leave the group. This confirmed Crass's previous intention to quit in 1984, and the band split up.|$|E
5|$|After the arrest, Nhung and Nghĩa {{sat with}} the {{brothers}} in the APC, and the convoy departed for Tân Sơn Nhứt. Before the convoy had departed for the church, Minh {{was reported to have}} gestured to Nhung with two fingers. This was taken to be an order to kill both brothers. The convoy stopped at a railroad crossing on <b>the</b> <b>return</b> <b>trip,</b> where by all accounts the brothers were assassinated. An investigation by Đôn determined that Nghĩa had shot the brothers at point-blank range with a semi-automatic firearm and that Nhung sprayed them with bullets before repeatedly stabbing the bodies with a knife.|$|E

5|$|As the Dorniers passed Sheerness, the {{anti-aircraft}} defences opened fire {{to protect the}} naval yard at Chatham, Kent. Along the south bank of the Thames Estuary 15 gun positions fired six 4.5in of 3.7in heavy shells. The German bombers opened up a little, to spread out. The cloud over the target ruined the German bomb run, and some bombers began <b>the</b> <b>return</b> <b>trip</b> with their loads still on board. While crossing the coast over Deal, Kent, three attacked the Royal Marines barracks there. They continued back across the Channel, having made no contact with enemy fighters.|$|E
5|$|As {{the group}} left Plateros at 22:30 to trek back towards American lines, Pajota and his guerrillas {{continually}} sought out local villagers {{to provide additional}} carabao carts to transport the weakened prisoners. The majority of the prisoners {{had little or no}} clothing and shoes, and it became increasingly difficult for them to walk. When the group reached Balincarin, they had accumulated nearly 50carts. Despite the convenience of using the carts, the carabao traveled at a sluggish pace, only , which greatly reduced the speed of <b>the</b> <b>return</b> <b>trip.</b> By the time the group reached American lines, 106carts were being used.|$|E
5|$|Captain Kikunori Kijima—Gotō's {{chief of}} staff and {{commander}} of the bombardment force during <b>the</b> <b>return</b> <b>trip</b> to the Shortland Islands after Gotō's death in battle—claimed that his force had sunk two American cruisers and one destroyer. Furutakas captain—who survived the sinking of his ship—blamed the loss of his cruiser on bad air reconnaissance and poor leadership from the 8th fleet staff under Admiral Mikawa. Although Gotō's bombardment mission failed, Jojima's reinforcement convoy was successful in delivering the crucial men and equipment to Guadalcanal. Aoba journeyed to Kure, Japan, for repairs that were completed on February 15, 1943. Kinugasa was sunk one month later during the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal.|$|E
50|$|Both cabooses {{were used}} {{on a regular basis}} and one caboose was always at the rear of loaded ore trains from Eagle Mountain to Ferrum and just behind the {{locomotives}} on <b>the</b> <b>return</b> <b>trips</b> to Eagle Mountain. When the railroad reduced operations from two to one round trip ore train per day, KS 1905 become the only caboose used and KS 1918 was stored at Ferrum, where it was severely vandalized.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} {{there are}} significant numbers of historic buildings and reinforced concrete high rises built in the Republican period. Statues and other monuments dot the island. Each construction has its own particular story that often relates to important events {{in the history of}} the island. For instance, some of the cobblestones that surround the Havana docks were brought in from Sweden, on <b>the</b> <b>return</b> <b>trips</b> of ships smuggling sugar into Britain during World War I.|$|R
50|$|There are two regular boat trips from Real to Polillo. The {{first trip}} usually leaves at 7:30 AM {{as the bus}} {{passengers}} coming from Lucena and Manila try to catch it up. The next boat leaves at 10:00 AM. The boats are outrigger types powered with a surplus truck engine. <b>The</b> <b>return</b> <b>trips</b> from Polillo are at 5:00 AM and 1:00 PM. The trip from Ungos Port to Polillo usually takes three hours.|$|R
5|$|Franklin's brigade {{departed}} on {{the same}} road it used to enter Wytheville, the road that leads to Tazewell Courthouse (Jeffersonville). It was a good decision to leave, because the Confederate army had already begun an attempt to block their return home. One of the two main roads available for <b>the</b> <b>return</b> <b>trip</b> was occupied by troops {{under the command of}} Colonel John McCausland, and the other road was blocked by the command of Brigadier-General John S. Williams. Two cavalry units were in pursuit, including Major May's cavalry that had harassed the brigade as it approached Wytheville.|$|E
5|$|In 1827, at its peak, {{the canal}} {{transport}}ed 332,000 tons. The {{main purpose of}} the canal was still to transport coal to Givors, from where it could be taken to other towns on the river Rhone. On <b>the</b> <b>return</b> <b>trip,</b> boats carried some of the merchandise of the Midi including iron, oak wood and other things needed by the factories of the Loire department. By 1831, the population of Givors had risen to 9,210. There were many factories making window panes, bottles and glasses, and the port had a busy trade in coal shipment. Ten large glass works had been established at Rive-de-Gier that also transported their products by the canal.|$|E
5|$|Low on supplies, Scott {{and his men}} {{ended their}} campaign. On <b>the</b> <b>return</b> <b>trip,</b> two men drowned in the White River; these were the only deaths among Scott's men.

Scott sent 12 men ahead with the {{official}} report for Arthur St. Clair's review; {{the rest of the}} men arrived at Fort Steuben (present-day Clarksville, Indiana) on June 15. The next day, they recrossed the Ohio River and received their discharge papers at Louisville, Kentucky.|$|E
5000|$|After {{her return}} in 1947, P&O had Mooltan {{completely}} reconditioned before returning her to commercial use.

5|$|On 18 October, Kronprinz was {{slightly}} grounded, though {{the damage was}} not serious enough to necessitate withdrawal for repairs. By 20 October, the fighting on the islands was winding down; Moon, Ösel, and Dagö were in German possession. The previous day, the Admiralstab had ordered the cessation of naval actions {{and the return of}} the dreadnoughts to the High Seas Fleet as soon as possible. On the 26th, Kronprinz was more seriously grounded on <b>the</b> <b>return</b> <b>trip</b> to Kiel. She managed to reach Kiel on 2 November, and subsequently Wilhelmshaven. Repairs were effected from 24 November to 8 January.|$|E
5|$|On April 19, 1944, {{the second}} {{production}} Lockheed Constellation, piloted by Howard Hughes and TWA president Jack Frye, flew from Burbank, California, to Washington, D.C. in 6 hours and 57 minutes (2300mi– 330.9mph). On <b>the</b> <b>return</b> <b>trip,</b> the airliner stopped at Wright Field to give Orville Wright his last airplane flight, more than 40 {{years after his}} historic first flight. He may even have briefly handled the controls. He commented that the wingspan of the Constellation was longer than the distance of his first flight.|$|E
5|$|On the {{previous}} day, the three airmen from the squadron had scouted the target area south of Tchepone in a two engine CIA aircraft piloted by a civilian employee. The pilot {{had failed to}} load enough fuel on the reconnaissance aircraft and had to refuel at a Laotian base on <b>the</b> <b>return</b> <b>trip</b> to Udorn. Since United States armed forces personnel were never officially acknowledged as being in Laos, the United States Ambassador to Laos became enraged that U.S. personnel had been spotted in uniform at the remote refueling field in Laos.|$|E

40|$|Large {{automotive}} supply chains typically involve manufacturers pulling {{materials from}} their suppliers along the chain, usually by using round-trip truckload routes. <b>The</b> <b>return</b> <b>trips</b> on these routes {{are used to}} return empty containers back to the suppliers. The mismatch {{between the amount of}} materials and empty containers results in underutilization of <b>the</b> <b>return</b> <b>trips.</b> A supplier can utilize this unused capacity by identifying a subset of promising customer routes that can be combined with its existing supplier routes to save overall costs of the system. Such an integration also leads to other supply chain coordination benefits such as the potential of using crossdocks, more frequent milkruns and ensuing reductions in inventories. We undertake such an integrated study of the inbound logistics from suppliers and the outbound logistics to customers at Robert Bosch LLC, a leading automotive parts manufacturer. We identify the opportunity for significant cost savings by using a mixed-integer programming model that matches opposite flows from and to the customers and suppliers. We consider the problem from a supply chain coordination perspective, where Bosch makes all the transportation arrangements for its customers and suppliers based on the centralized optimum solution, and outline its additional benefits.

50|$|A {{fall in the}} South Wales {{coal trade}} in the 1930s saw many of the class re-allocated {{to other parts of}} the system. Due to the {{stability}} of the design, many drivers would typically operate the 56xx class down the Welsh valleys in reverse (bunker first). The placement of the trailing wheels helped the engine enter the curves better than if operated in the other direction. Typically, during operation, when pulling a heavy load the tanks were operated bunker first, and then smokebox first on <b>the</b> <b>return</b> <b>trips</b> up <b>the</b> valleys.|$|R
5|$|One week later, Hertha began a seven-month {{training}} cruise (15 August 1913 – 12 March 1914). The voyage took Lindemann to Dartmouth in England, Vilagarcía de Arousa in Spain, Faial Island in the Azores {{and as far}} as Halifax in Nova Scotia. <b>The</b> <b>return</b> <b>trip</b> {{then went}} via Vera Cruz in Mexico, Havana in Cuba, Port-au-Prince in Haiti, Kingston in Jamaica, Port of Spain in Trinidad and then to the Canary Islands, Madeira, and the Spanish mainland, arriving back in Germany in the middle of March 1914, first in Brunsbüttel and two days later in Kiel.

5|$|The {{operation}} {{began on}} 12 October, when Moltke, Bayern, and the Königs began firing on the Russian shore batteries at Tagga Bay. Simultaneously, the Kaisers engaged the batteries on the Sworbe peninsula; the {{objective was to}} secure the channel between Moon and Dagö islands, which would block the only escape route of the Russian ships in the gulf. Both Grosser Kurfürst and Bayern struck mines while maneuvering into their bombardment positions; damage to the former was minimal, and the ship remained in action. However, Bayern was severely damaged, and temporary repairs proved ineffective. The ship had to be withdrawn to Kiel for repairs; <b>the</b> <b>return</b> <b>trip</b> took 19 days.|$|E
