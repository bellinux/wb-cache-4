5|$|Maybe mid-year; {{safe to say}} {{towards the}} end {{but not at the}} end, maybe like eight months or {{something}} like that. Best thing about it is we’re going <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> whenever we want <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> There is no deadline right now, we don’t have any dates set, we don’t have the studio, we’re going to do the record ourselves. So we will literally go in and record it and it will be probably be done before we sign a contract.|$|E

5|$|At sunset, {{the group}} {{discusses}} Randall's fate, and Dale's arguments {{have failed to}} sway the group, and he storms out. Rick, Shane, and Daryl return to the barn and Rick prepares to shoot Randall when Carl runs in and urges his father <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> Rick is horrified and stops the execution, much to Shane's annoyance.|$|E

5|$|I {{knew the}} ramp in Vikersund can jump pretty darn far. It was an {{incredible}} flight and {{it was important that}} I was able <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> During the flight, I thought 'it's now or never'.|$|E
5|$|In the episode, Michael (Steve Carell) {{decides to}} propose to Holly (Amy Ryan), and runs into trouble {{thinking}} of how <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> well with his expensive diamond ring.

5|$|After moving in, Moon began a {{prescribed}} course of Heminevrin (clomethiazole, a sedative) to alleviate his alcohol withdrawal symptoms. He {{wanted to get}} sober, but due to his fear of psychiatric hospitals he wanted <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> at home. Clomethiazole is discouraged for unsupervised detoxification because of its addictive potential, its tendency to induce tolerance, and its risk of death when mixed with alcohol. The pills were prescribed by Geoffrey Dymond, a physician who was unaware of Moon's lifestyle. Dymond prescribed a bottle of 100 pills, instructing him to take one pill when he felt a craving for alcohol {{but not more than}} three pills per day.|$|E
5|$|At the Simpson residence, Marge disapproves of {{the plan}}, but decides <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> for Apu's sake. While {{the plan is}} under way Homer decides {{to stay in the}} Springfield Retirement Castle with his father, posing as {{resident}} Cornelius Talmidge. Homer enjoys his stay at the home immensely, until the real Cornelius returns, at which point he flees. He returns home and gets into bed with Marge. Mrs. Nahasapeemapetilon enters to say goodbye, but is shocked to see Marge in bed with another man, and Apu on the floor. Tired of the whole charade, Marge forces Apu to tell his mother the truth, who declares that the arranged marriage will proceed as planned.|$|E
5|$|Chazz Palminteri as U.S. Customs Special Agent Dave Kujan. Singer {{had always}} wanted the actor for the film, {{but he was always}} unavailable. The role was offered to Christopher Walken and Robert De Niro, both of whom turned it down. The filmmakers even had Al Pacino come in and read for the part, but he decided not <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> because he had just played a cop in Heat. Palminteri became available, but only for a week. When he signed on, this persuaded the film's {{financial}} backers to support the film fully because he was a sufficiently high-profile star, thanks to the recent release of A Bronx Tale and Bullets Over Broadway.|$|E

5|$|Due to its poor performance, Friedman {{believed}} that the Federal Reserve Board should be abolished. Friedman was deeply critical about Federal Reserve policies, even during the so-called 'Volcker shock' that was labelled 'monetarist.' He further {{believed that}} if the money supply was to be centrally controlled (as by the Federal Reserve System) that the preferable way <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> would be with a mechanical system that would keep the quantity of money increasing at a steady rate.|$|E
5|$|Göring {{had never}} {{believed}} in Sea Lion, while Hitler had never believed Adler could achieve victory without Sea Lion. Both went their own ways. Hitler {{needed someone to}} keep up the pressure on Britain, and Göring was willing <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> On 19 September, Hitler ordered that no further barges were to be added to Sea Lion ports, but those under assembly were to continue. But the damage being done by RAF Bomber Command now meant sustaining the army in readiness was becoming a strain. The invasion forces were broken up and moved East on the understanding it could be reassembled with only three weeks notice.|$|E
5|$|He {{was next}} {{drafted by the}} Toronto Blue Jays 19th overall {{in the first round}} of the 1989 draft, out of Fresno State University. He was one of three Fresno State University alum drafted in the first round that year, the others being Steve Hosey (14th overall) and Tom Goodwin (22nd overall). It was the first time since the 1979 draft that one school had three {{different}} players selected in the first round. The last school <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> was the University of Michigan. The Toronto Blue Jays gave Zosky a $185,000 ($ today) signing bonus.|$|E

5|$|Nagarjuna's {{younger son}} Akkineni Akhil was rumoured {{to be making}} a cameo {{appearance}} following Nageswara Rao's request. Sources close to the film's unit initially denied those reports. Samantha later tweeted that Akhil appeared for shooting his portions in the film. When his health conditions worsened, Nageswara Rao asked Nagarjuna to bring the dubbing equipment to dub for his role fifteen days before his surgery as he did not want any other artist <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> if his voice worsened. He completed those activities just before he died on 22 January 2014. Only an appearance in a song remained incomplete.|$|E
5|$|Oil-fired {{propulsion}} {{had many}} advantages for naval architects and officers at sea alike. It reduced smoke, making ships less visible. It could be fed into boilers automatically, rather than needing a complement of stokers <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> by hand. Oil has roughly twice the thermal content of coal. This {{meant that the}} boilers themselves could be smaller; and for the same volume of fuel, an oil-fired ship would have much greater range.|$|E
5|$|On September 16, 2007, Thome {{joined the}} 500 home run club by hitting a walk-off home run against Los Angeles Angels pitcher Dustin Moseley.

Several family members including his father were on hand to witness the accomplishment, which occurred at a game during which the White Sox distributed free Thome bobbleheads to fans. Thome celebrated by pointing upward in homage to his late mother as he rounded the bases.|$|E
