It was re-released as a Player's Choice title in North America, indicating that it has sold a minimum of one million copies <b>there.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> United States, A Link to the Pasts Game Boy Advance version alone sold 1.4 million copies and earned $41 million by August 2006.

5|$|According {{to another}} legend, {{there was once}} a sea where the Dnieper River now flows. When Saint Andrew came to Kiev and erected a cross on the place where the Saint Andrew's Church now stands, the sea went away. The only part that {{remained}} of the sea is under the mountain on which Kiev sits today. When the church was built <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 18th century, a spring opened under the altar. The church has no bells, because, according to the legend, when the first bell strikes, the water can revive again and flood the left bank of Kiev.|$|E
5|$|Admission to {{the school}} is through the eleven-plus examination, taken in year 6. Pupils must obtain a minimum score before their {{application}} will be considered and places will be awarded based on whether the child is in public care, whether {{he lives in the}} catchment area and attends a partnered primary school, and whether they have siblings attending the school or parents working <b>there.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> event of a tie, places will be allocated based on proximity {{to the school}}. The school has a maximum annual intake of 116 at the start of year 7 (aged 11); pupils are arranged into forms of no more than 30, where registration takes place. Their form tutors provide access to pastoral support, overseen by their Key Stage Manager. In 2013 the lower school had approximately 577 pupils on roll. The school uniform consists of a black blazer with the school badge embroidered on the breast pocket and a red braid on each pocket. Charcoal or black trousers are worn along with a white shirt and school tie.|$|E

5|$|After being educated by a governess, Allen joined Summer Fields School in Oxford in 1912. He {{began to}} play cricket seriously at school; by his second year, he reached the school second team, from where he progressed to the first team then the captaincy.

The family had planned to send Allen to Haileybury, but Wells persuaded Allen senior to send his son to Eton instead, although it was a considerable financial burden on the family.

5|$|After {{more than}} five years at Wells, Wheelwright {{received}} an invitation from the church and town of Hampton, then under the jurisdiction of Massachusetts, to join the Reverend Timothy Dalton as a pastor of the church there. Without apparent hesitation he went <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> spring of 1647 and entered into a written agreement with a committee of the church and town. He was installed as the minister on 12 April 1647 by some accounts, or 24 June 1647 by another. The job afforded the 55-year-old Wheelwright with a larger salary than the parish at Wells did, an important consideration given the large size of his family. No longer in a frontier setting, he was now within reach of professional brethren and laymen of culture and social refinement, more aligned with his educational background.|$|E

5|$|By the 7th century Reculver {{had become}} a landed estate of the Anglo-Saxon kings of Kent. The site of the Roman fort was given over for the {{establishment}} of a monastery dedicated to St Mary in 669AD, and King Eadberht II of Kent was buried <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 760s. During the Middle Ages Reculver was a thriving township with a weekly market and a yearly fair, and it was a member of the Cinque Port of Sandwich. The settlement declined as the Wantsum Channel silted up, and coastal erosion claimed many buildings constructed on the soft sandy cliffs. The village was largely abandoned in the late 18th century, and most of the church was demolished in the early 19th century. Protecting the ruins and the rest of Reculver from erosion is an ongoing challenge.|$|E

5|$|By {{the middle}} of the 18th century, law {{enforcement}} in the counties of Croatia included county pandurs or hussars who patrolled roads and pursued criminals. In 1740, the term was applied to frontier guard duty infantry deployed in the Croatian Military Frontier (Banal Frontier), specifically its Karlovac and Varaždin Generalcies. The role of the pandurs as security guards was extended to Dalmatia after the establishment of Austrian rule <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early 19th century. The term has dropped from official use for law enforcement officials, but it is still used colloquially in Croatia and the Western Balkans in a manner akin to the English word cop. The unit raised and led by Trenck is also referred to more specifically as Trenck's Pandurs, and less frequently in Croatia than elsewhere, as Croatian Pandurs.|$|E
5|$|By the {{outbreak}} of World War I in 1914, Bayer was facing competition in all its major markets from local ASA producers {{as well as other}} German drug firms (particularly Heyden and Hoechst). The British market was immediately closed to the German companies, but British manufacturing could not meet the demand—especially with phenol supplies, necessary for ASA synthesis, largely being used for explosives manufacture. On 5 February 1915, Bayer's UK trademarks were voided, so that any company could use the term aspirin. The Australian market was taken over by Aspro, after the makers of Nicholas-Aspirin lost a short-lived exclusive right to the aspirin name <b>there.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> United States, Bayer was still under German control—though the war disrupted the links between the American Bayer plant and the German Bayer headquarters—but phenol shortage threatened to reduce aspirin production to a trickle, and imports across the Atlantic Ocean were blocked by the Royal Navy.|$|E
