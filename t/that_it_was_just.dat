5|$|Disraeli {{refused to}} cast {{blame for the}} defeat, which he {{understood}} {{was likely to be}} final for him. He wrote to Lady Bradford <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> as much work to end a government as to form one, without any of the fun. Queen Victoria was bitter at his departure as Prime Minister. Among the honours he arranged before resigning as Prime Minister on 21 April 1880 was one for his private secretary, Montagu Corry, who became Baron Rowton.|$|E
5|$|Finally, the Acurad system {{employed}} a patented double shot piston design. The {{idea was to}} use a second piston (located within the primary piston) to apply pressure after the shot had partially solidified {{around the perimeter of}} the casting cavity and shot sleeve. While the system was not very effective, it did lead the manufacturer of the Acurad machines, Ube Industries, to discover <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> as effective to apply sufficient pressure at the right time later in the cycle with the primary piston; this is indirect squeeze casting.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Maggie's baby monitor {{receives}} transmissions {{from the}} cellular tower. Rather than report this to Omnitouch, Marge becomes obsessed with eavesdropping on private calls. Eventually Bart and Milhouse play a prank on Marge by making her think that an escaped convict {{was attempting to}} break into the house. When Milhouse opens the front door and tries to tell Marge <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> a prank, Marge smashes the baby monitor on Milhouse's head and knocks him out and Bart rebukes that it was a fair punishment for eavesdropping, to which Marge reluctantly agrees.|$|E

5|$|Set in summer, Alice's Adventures in Wonderland {{opens with}} Alice on the {{riverbank}} with her elder sister. She falls down a rabbit hole into Wonderland after following the White Rabbit. Meeting many characters and changing her size several times, she eventually finds herself at {{the trial of the}} Knave of Hearts as a witness. Ordered to leave by the King and Queen of Hearts, Alice argues with them, eventually claiming that they are just a pack of cards. As they swarm her, Alice awakens {{on the riverbank}} and realizes <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> a dream.|$|E
5|$|Donna {{arrives at}} Holby City Hospital {{as a staff}} nurse on the general surgery ward, making a poor first {{impression}} by being disorganised and insolent. Mistakenly believing that living with her superior will ensure her an easy time at work, Donna invites herself {{to move in with}} nurse Lisa Fox (Luisa Bradshaw-White). The two have a strained relationship: within weeks, Donna is evicted for falling behind on her rent, and when she is later allowed to move back in, she lets bailiffs take Lisa's possessions after failing to keep up her own loan repayments. Forced to run a shift in charge of the hospital's Acute Assessment Unit as recompense, Donna struggles to manage and learns a new respect for Lisa. During this period, Donna has a friendship with midwife Mickie Hendrie (Kelly Adams). Mickie is questioning her sexuality, and the two have sex while drunk. Mickie is disappointed when Donna states <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> a one-night stand, but they are able to reconcile their friendship. When the general surgery ward is downsized, Donna is forced to reapply for her job. Although she gives a good interview and impresses Lisa, other candidates have more experience, so she is unable to retain her position and has to work as a bank nurse.|$|E
5|$|On 7 April, Kagame {{warned the}} {{committee}} and UNAMIR that he would resume the civil war if the killing did not stop. The next day, the Rwandan government forces attacked the national parliament building from several directions, but the RPF troops stationed there successfully fought back; Kagame began an attack from the north on three fronts, seeking to link up quickly with the troops isolated in Kigali. An interim government was set up but Kagame {{refused to talk to}} it, believing <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> a cover for Bagosora's rule. Over the next few days, the RPF advanced steadily south, capturing Gabiro and large areas of countryside to the north and east of Kigali. They avoided attacking Kigali or Byumba at this stage, but conducted manoeuvres designed to encircle the cities and cut off supply routes. The RPF allowed Tutsi refugees from Uganda to settle behind the front line in the RPF-controlled areas.|$|E

5|$|On 7 April, as the {{genocide}} started, RPF commander Paul Kagame warned {{the interim government}} and UNAMIR that he would resume the civil war if the killing did not stop. The next day FAR forces attacked the national parliament building from several directions, but RPF troops stationed there successfully fought back. The RPF then began an attack from the north on three fronts, seeking to link up quickly with the isolated troops in Kigali. Kagame {{refused to talk to}} the interim government, believing <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> a cover for Bagosora's rule, and not committed to ending {{the genocide}}. Over the next few days, the RPF advanced steadily south, capturing Gabiro and large areas of the countryside to the north and east of Kigali. They avoided attacking Kigali or Byumba, but conducted manoeuvres designed to encircle the cities and cut off supply routes. The RPF also allowed Tutsi refugees from Uganda to settle behind the front line in the RPF controlled areas.|$|E
25|$|Reasons for the Douglas Branch service {{reduction}} {{were due}} to its low ridership, badly deteriorated infrastructure and funding problems, while many residents in the communities it runs through had claimed <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> another attempt by the CTA to eliminate transit service on the West Side.|$|E
25|$|Northwest Harbor, {{located at}} Northwest Landing, was the town's first harbor. The harbor {{turned out to}} be too shallow for large ships, so it was moved two miles (3km) West, to Sag Harbor, which derived its name from the fact <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> north of the {{settlement}} of Sagaponack, New York in Southampton.|$|E

25|$|Most of {{the reports}} in the media tended to be {{critical}} of Patriarch Kirill and laughing at the claims that the dust was harmful, saying <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> sand {{and it would have been}} far more efficient to just hire a maid to vacuum it up. The Patriarch himself then said he thought it to be inappropriate to forgive Shevchenko.|$|E

25|$|A year later, Perry {{denied the}} last of Overland's {{significant}} pretrial motions. The criminalists had used MiniFiler, a new product to type Lazarus' DNA, and he argued it was sufficiently different from previous technology that she was entitled to a Frye hearing, to determine whether its results were of sufficient scientific validity to be admissible. Perry ruled <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> another form of the PCR method commonly used to test DNA samples.|$|E
25|$|In {{search of}} a trademark, the Northern Pacific {{considered}} and rejected many designs. Edwin Harrison McHenry, the Chief Engineer, was struck with a geometric design, a Taijitu in the Korean flag he saw while visiting the Korean exhibit at the Chicago World's Fair in 1893. The idea came to him <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> the symbol for the long-sought-for trademark. With a slight modification, and rendered in red and black, the symbol became the railroad's trademark.|$|E
25|$|George P. Wilbur, who {{was cast}} as Michael Myers for this film, wore hockey pads under the costume {{to make himself}} look more {{physically}} imposing. During filming, {{the cast and crew}} {{made it a point to}} take it easy on Danielle Harris, as she was only a young child at the time, and made sure that she was not scared too badly and knew that none of it was real; to this end, Wilbur regularly removed the mask in front of her in order to remind her <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> a movie and he was not going to hurt her.|$|E

25|$|Charles of Lorraine, Duke of Mayenne, {{then became}} {{the leader of}} the Catholic League.

In July 1589, in the royal camp at Saint-Cloud, a monk named Jacques Clément gained an audience with the King and drove a long knife into his spleen. Clément was executed on the spot, taking with him the information of who, if anyone, had hired him. On his deathbed, Henry III called for Henry of Navarre and begged him, in the name of Statecraft, to become a Catholic, citing the brutal warfare that would ensue if he refused. In keeping with Salic Law, he named Henry as his heir.|$|E
25|$|JR and Babe lead {{separate}} {{lives for}} a while. However, on November 2, 2007, as they later bond over old times while talking {{at the bar}} The Comeback, their connection draws them together once more. Babe sees a more mature side to JR, and after she offers him a ride home, the two cannot stop the pull that is apparent between them. With the sexual tension intensifying, and JR saying that he misses kissing her, the two make love {{for the first time}} since their divorce. Despite this reunion of sorts, Babe tells JR <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> a one-time deal and says that she is not in love with him anymore. JR is left devastated, and even after Babe apologizes for hurting him in this way, he sulks in despair and begins drinking again.|$|E
