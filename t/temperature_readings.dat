5|$|In 2016 it was {{proposed}} that large theropods like Tyrannosaurus had teeth covered in lips like modern day lizards, {{rather than having}} bare teeth like crocodiles. This {{was based on the}} presence of enamel, which according to this theory, may have to remain hydrated, an issue not faced by aquatic species like crocodilians or toothless species like birds, which have lipless mouths and toothless beaks. Based on comparisons of bone texture of Daspletosaurus with crocodilians, a 2017 theory suggests that Tyrannosaurus and other tyrannosaurids may not have had lips at all and instead had large, flat scales that left no room for lips. The skull of Daspletosaurus also suggests that tyrannosaurids including Tyrannosaurus had integumentary sensory organs similar to crocodilians likely used in touch, <b>temperature</b> <b>readings,</b> prey detection and precise control of jaw movements.|$|E
5|$|Periods of rain {{impacted}} the British Isles {{early in}} the morning of 10 January, progressing from west to east. Wet and windy weather was seen across the region during the day, with a wintry mix of precipitation falling across northern sections of Britain. Within the area of wintry mix, the wind combined with the ongoing snowfall led to blizzards across most of Scotland. Precipitation became more showery in nature during the evening hours. Thunderstorms were observed despite the near-freezing <b>temperature</b> <b>readings.</b> Wind and waves associated with this storm were too much for the tanker MV Braer, which had become lodged on rocks in the Shetland Islands nearly a week beforehand. The tanker broke up and her remaining cargo of 84,500tons of light crude oil spilled into the ocean surrounding the islands. The rough conditions caused by this storm led to the rapid breakup of visible oil slicks.|$|E
5|$|Temperature: The species {{appears to}} require the cool, mild {{temperatures}} and relatively constant conditions provided by the waterfalls and the mist they generate. Water volume and flow rates within the Chittenango Creek watershed influence {{the size of the}} waterfall as well as the mist-zone and the actual temperature at the site. Active Novisuccinea chittenangoensis are generally found at temperatures from 12 to 20°C. During warmer periods, snails retreat to cool areas provided by the moist rock and moss, or aestivate in the vegetation. During cold winter temperatures, it is believed that the snails at the Falls retreat into cracks or fissures in the rocks and remain inactive. Various <b>temperature</b> <b>readings</b> were gathered during the summers of 1980-1982. In the spray zone, the rock surface temperatures averaged 16°C, the moss averaged 14°C, and the combined temperatures of the substrate, water, and vegetation averaged 16°C. Seasonal and daily temperature variation has been monitored for 2 years using data loggers that record temperature every hour, but this data has not yet been analyzed (Breisch, unpublished data).|$|E

25|$|In August, TEPCO began {{considering}} {{changing the}} core injection method for the no. 3 reactor {{as it was}} requiring a much larger quantity of water to cool and the temperatures remained relatively high compared to the nos. 1 and 2 reactors which required far less water. TEPCO has hypothesized {{that this may be}} because some fuel is still present above the core support plate inside the pressure vessel of the no. 3 reactor in addition to the fuel that has fallen {{to the bottom of the}} pressure vessel. The fuel on the bottom would be easily cooled by the existing method, but as the pressure vessel is leaking, any fuel located on the support plate was likely only being cooled due to the steam generated by the cooling of the melted fuel at the bottom. TEPCO began considering utilizing the reactor's core spray system pipes as an additional path of water injection and then reduce the amount of water through the existing feedwater piping system. A team of workers were sent inside the reactor building to inspect the core spray system pipes and it was found that the piping was undamaged. Hoses were then run from the temporary injection pumps located outside the building and connected to the core spray system piping. On 1 September, TEPCO began injecting water using the new route. The new injection method has been considerably effective in lowering the temperature of the reactor to below 100 degrees Celsius. As of 27 September, most of the no. 3 reactor's <b>temperature</b> <b>readings</b> are between 70–80 degrees Celsius. Later, TEPCO began utilizing the same method in the no. 2 reactor; it has not had as significant effect on the no. 2 reactor as it did on the no. 3.|$|E

2500|$|Publicity has {{surrounded}} {{claims of}} a global warming hiatus during the period 1998–2013. [...] The exceptionally warm El Niño year of 1998 was an outlier from the continuing temperature trend, and so subsequent annual temperatures gave {{the appearance of a}} hiatus: by January 2006, it appeared to some that global warming had stopped or paused. A 2009 study showed that decades without warming were not exceptional, and in 2011 a study showed that if allowances were made for known variability, the rising temperature trend continued unabated. There was increased public interest in 2013 in the run-up to publication of the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report, and despite concerns that a 15-year period was too short to determine a meaningful trend, the IPCC included a section on a hiatus, which it defined as a much smaller increasing linear trend over the 15 years from 1998 to 2012, than over the 60 years from 1951 to 2012. Various studies examined possible causes of the short-term slowdown. Even though the overall climate system has continued to accumulate energy due to Earth's positive energy budget, the available <b>temperature</b> <b>readings</b> at the Earth's surface indicate slower rates of increase in surface warming than in the prior decade.

40|$|The {{extrusion}} {{process is}} complex, involving {{interaction between the}} process variables and the material’s high temperature properties and is typically conducted at relatively high temperatures because the lower flow stress of the material permits larger section reductions to be achieved. This lowers the power requirements and processing times. Temperature is, perhaps, the most important parameter in extrusion. The flow stress is reduced if the temperature is increased and deformation is, therefore, easier, {{but at the same}} time, the maximum extrusion speed is reduced because localised temperatures must be well below any incipient melting temperature. The present investigation focuses on the evolution of the temperature in the billet from upsetting and {{until the end of the}} extrusion cycle is reached. The extrusion pressure and the temperature rise are predicted and the pressure–displacement trace and the events which take place in the deformed material during the extrusion process are also simulated. The simulation is compared with data obtained from an experimental extrusion press. All simulations are performed with the implicit finite element code FORGE 2. A comparison with experiments is made to validate the predicted <b>temperatures</b> <b>readings</b> from FORGE 2 to ensure that the numerical discretisation provides a true simulation of the process. It was found that the extrusion parameters (friction, heat transfer, etc.) are significantly influenced by the temperature gradients produced in the billet during transfer to the container, and after upsetting in the container. These parameters are thus clearly extremely sensitive input data when attempting to simulate the extrusion process...|$|R
