5|$|At {{the early}} stages of development, Minagawa {{revealed}} that numerous ideas and features were planned for the game, but were dropped from the final stages due to certain constraints and hardware limitations. Some of these included <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>for</b> a second player to join in the gameplay, enabling a two-player mode. Another idea that was given a considerable amount of thought was the ability to recruit non-player characters to join in the mob hunts. Due to the technical limitations of the console and multiple number of characters joining the fray, the development phase took longer than expected, causing delays.|$|E
5|$|Cheyenne {{prototype}} #6 (s/n 66-8831) began conducting weapons {{testing at}} Yuma Proving Ground, Arizona, demonstrating <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>for</b> the gunner and pilot to accurately fire on separate targets {{on each side}} on the helicopter. Towards the end of 1970, the Army funded work on TOW missile guidance and night sighting systems. Prototypes #6 and #9 were also tested and evaluated at Yuma Proving Ground from 30 January to 23 December 1971, to determine if stability and control systems were sufficient. Deficiencies were identified in lateral directional stability, uncommanded motion during maneuvering, high vibration, and poor directional control during sidewards flying.|$|E

40|$|The d 2 dwarfing gene in {{pearl millet}} [Pennisetum glaucum] carries a yield penalty {{due to an}} {{associated}} reduction in individual grain mass. This reduction, however, varies with genetic background, indicating {{that it may be}} possible to select against poor grain filling in d 2 dwarf backgrounds, given an effective measure of grain filling. This study was conducted to assess genetic variability <b>for</b> grain-filling <b>ability</b> (GFA; in contrast to simply grain size), and its relationship to grain yield, in dwarf pearl millet restorer (R) lines. The GFA of an individual R line was defined as the least squares estimate of its effect on individual grain mass in the analysis of variance, following a linear covariance adjustment for grain number. The study was based on 93 dwarf hybrids involving 31 d 2 dwarf R-lines, evaluated over 3 years. Half of the variation in individual grain mass in the 93 hybrids was related to variation in grain number. Covariance adjustment in individual grain mass for grain number resulted in highly significant differences among hybrids and R lines in GFA. <b>The</b> R-line combining <b>ability</b> <b>for</b> GFA accounted for 26 % of the variation in <b>the</b> R-line combining <b>ability</b> <b>for</b> yield, compared to 46 % <b>for</b> <b>the</b> combining <b>ability</b> <b>for</b> grain number, and just 8 % <b>for</b> <b>the</b> combining <b>ability</b> of individual grain mass. <b>The</b> combining <b>ability</b> <b>for</b> GFA was independent of <b>the</b> combining <b>ability</b> <b>for</b> various pre-flowering effects, including grain number, but was related to <b>the</b> combining <b>ability</b> <b>for</b> individual grain mass and harvest index. Improvement in individual grain mass achieved through selection for GFA should translate directly into yield improvement, whereas improvement by direct selection for individual grain mass is less-likely to do so...|$|R

5|$|In 1969, Austrian {{paleontologist}} Georg Haas {{concluded that}} despite the large size of ankylosaur skulls, the associated musculature was relatively weak. He also thought jaw movement was limited to up and down movements. Extrapolating from this, Haas suggested that ankylosaurs ate relatively soft non-abrasive vegetation. Later research on Euoplocephalus indicates that forward and sideways jaw movement was possible in these animals, the skull being able to withstand considerable forces. A 2016 study of the dental occlusion (contact between the teeth) of ankylosaur specimens found that <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>for</b> backwards (palinal) jaw movement evolved independently in different ankylosaur linages, including Late Cretaceous North American ankylosaurids like Ankylosaurus and Euoplocephalus.|$|E

Schafer noted that in Psychonauts, they attempted to bring together a lot of assets, including characters and environments, but {{were not able to}} successfully integrate them on their first attempt and had to start over on the development of some. In several cases for Psychonauts, changes made in gameplay required them to return and redesign levels to account for the new features. The company decided at the start to use the scrum development approach for Brütal Legend, which they found worked well with their company's culture, allowing them to quickly arrive at playable targets at every milestone. For example, the team was able to bring about their terrain engine, renderer, and a playable Eddie Riggs within a month of development, and by the third month, <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>for</b> Eddie to drive about the terrain, running over hordes of enemies.|$|E
5|$|Although a third Super Smash Bros. {{game had}} been {{announced}} long before E3 2006, Nintendo unveiled its first {{information in the}} form of a trailer on May 10, 2006, and the game was named Super Smash Bros.

A second third-party character, Sonic the Hedgehog, from Nintendo's former rival Sega was also confirmed as a playable character on October 10, 2007. Super Smash Bros. Brawl was released in Japan on January 31, 2008, in North America on March 9, 2008, in Australia on June 26, 2008, and Europe on June 27, 2008.
