5|$|The {{portions}} of Queens Chapel Road south of Ager Road {{and north of}} Hamilton Street were originally designated MD 210 and MD 500, respectively. The portion of modern Queens Chapel Road from south of Ager Road to Hamilton Street originally did not exist.

The highway had a <b>T</b> <b>intersection</b> with Ager Road and continued east to another <b>T</b> <b>intersection</b> where the road turned north while Hamilton Street continued east into Hyattsville. Ager Road, Hamilton Street, and the portion of Queens Chapel Road connecting them were part of MD 209, which was renumbered {{as an extension of}} MD 410 by 1946; MD 210 was renumbered as an extension of MD 500 at the same time.|$|E

In the 2000s, plans were made to improve the intersections at both termini of Route 83. The intersection with Route 47 saw realignment and the installation of a traffic light, along with improvements to Route 47, that cost $6.7 million and was completed in July 2007. In 2006, reconstruction of the Yintersection of US 9 and Route 83 to a <b>T</b> <b>intersection</b> and a new traffic light was planned following a school bus accident.

40|$|Motorcycles are overrepresented in {{road traffic}} crashes and {{particularly}} vulnerable at signalized intersections. The {{objective of this}} study is to identify causal factors affecting the motorcycle crashes at both four-legged and <b>T</b> signalized <b>intersections.</b> Treating the data in time-series cross-section panels, this study explores different Hierarchical Poisson models and found that the model allowing autoregressive lag 1 dependent specification in the error term is the most suitable. Results show that the number of lanes at the four-legged signalized intersections significantly increases motorcycle crashes largely because of the higher exposure resulting from higher motorcycle accumulation at the stop line. Furthermore, the presence of a wide median and an uncontrolled left-turn lane at major roadways of four-legged intersections exacerbate this potential hazard. For <b>T</b> signalized <b>intersections,</b> the presence of exclusive right-turn lane at both major and minor roadways and an uncontrolled left-turn lane at major roadways of <b>T</b> <b>intersections</b> increases motorcycle crashes. Motorcycle crashes increase on high-speed roadways because they are more vulnerable and less likely to react in time during conflicts. The presence of red light cameras reduces motorcycle crashes significantly for both four-legged and <b>T</b> <b>intersections.</b> With the red-light camera, motorcycles are less exposed to conflicts because it is observed that they are more disciplined in queuing at the stop line and less likely to jump start at the start of green...|$|R

5|$|SR 865's modern bridges {{across the}} South River and North River and their {{approaches}} were constructed in 1955 and 1956. These bridges were upstream {{from the old}} bridges. SR 865's bridge across Mill Creek and its approaches were constructed in 1956 and 1957. By 1958, Port Republic Road consisted of SR 659 from Harrisonburg to Goods Mill Road, SR 675 south from there to Battlefield Road, SR 679 from there to SR 865 (Pineville Road), SR 865 through Port Republic, and SR 629 from SR 865 {{just south of the}} South River to beyond US 340 (East Side Highway). The county highways were all paved except for SR 675, which was gravel. Port Republic Road's interchange with I-81 was completed when the Interstate was completed between interchanges with US 11 on either side of Harrisonburg in 1961. By 1974, SR 659 was extended southeast so that all of Port Republic Road was one route number. Port Republic Road was relocated at its intersection with SR 680 (Oak Ridge Road) in 1971. The intersection had formerly been a <b>T</b> <b>intersection</b> that required a turn to remain on Port Republic Road. SR 659 was reconstructed from SR 689 (Spaders Church Road) to just south of I-81 by 1978.

40|$|A lane-based signal platoon {{progression}} {{model has}} been developed for estimating performance measures {{as a function of}} signal offsets, geometric design and flow conditions. This is part of a lane-based network model that involves the blockage of upstream intersection lanes by downstream queues (backward spread of congestion) and a capacity constraint applied to oversaturated upstream intersections. The model takes into account midblock lane changes that apply to signal platoon patterns. This is particularly important in evaluating closely-spaced intersections with high demand flows where vehicles have limited opportunities for lane changes between intersections. The modelling of signal platoon patterns is further enhanced by assigning two types of movements negotiating the network to special movement classes. These are the through movements at external approaches which become turning movements at downstream internal approaches, and the dogleg movements at staggered <b>T</b> <b>intersections.</b> These movements can be assigned to separate lanes and separate signal phases, and their second-by-second platoon patterns can be tracked through the network separately. This improves the quality of signal platoon modelling and is expected to produce better results in assessing signal coordination quality and optimising signal offsets. The use of special movement classes also helps to estimate unequal lane use cases at external approaches of a paired intersection system, a factor which also affects signal platoon patterns. A staggered T-intersection example is presented to demonstrate important aspects of modelling signal platoon patterns by approach lane use and movement class...|$|R

The paper characterizes weak preservation of preimages, of intersections, and preservation of both preimages and intersections by a functor T via the existence of transformations from T to either F or P. Moreover, we define for arbitrary T-coalgebras A a next-time operator ○A with associated modal operators ✷ and ✸ and relate their properties to weak limit preservation properties of T.
