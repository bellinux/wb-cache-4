5|$|Folk-stories <b>told</b> <b>in</b> {{the nineteenth}} century about elves are still <b>told</b> <b>in</b> modern Denmark and Sweden, but now feature ethnic {{minorities}} in place of elves in an essentially racist discourse. In an ethnically fairly homogeneous medieval countryside, supernatural beings provided the Other through which everyday people created their identities; in cosmopolitan industrial contexts, ethnic minorities or immigrants are used in storytelling to similar effect.|$|E

5|$|Continuation Bond author Raymond Benson sees Vivienne Michel as {{the best}} {{realised}} female characterisation undertaken by Fleming, partly because the story is <b>told</b> <b>in</b> the first person narrative.

Its module code is DL1, which is used to designate it as the first part of the Dragonlance adventure series.|$|E

5|$|Bach had {{composed}} his Christmas Oratorio, {{based on}} the gospels of Luke and Matthew, in 1734, a work in six parts to be performed on six occasions during Christmas tide. He had composed an Easter Oratorio already in 1725. The Ascension Oratorio appeared thus in the same liturgical year as the Christmas Oratorio. The text for the Ascension Oratorio, a compilation of several biblical sources, free poetry and chorales, was presumably written by Picander who had written the libretti for the St Matthew Passion and the Christmas Oratorio, among others. It follows {{the story of the}} Ascension as <b>told</b> <b>in</b> Luke, Mark and the Acts of the Apostles.|$|E
