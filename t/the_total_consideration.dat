From <b>the</b> <b>total</b> <b>consideration</b> on experimental results obtained in these tests, some conclusions can be drawn as follows. The strain concentration factor depends on mainly the elastic stress concentration factor, the stress level and the notch radius.

The safety limit of this method {{is shown in the}} relationship between the radius of notch root and the critical strains in case of several elastic stress concentration factors. The experimental values multiplied the strain concentration factor by the stress concentration factor in the steel becomes nearly the 2 nd power of the elastic stress concentration factor (K_t^ 2) when the applied stress reaches the yield stress at a notch root, and the experimental values bocomes smaller than K_t^ 2 with an increase of the applied stress. But, in the aluminum alloy the experimental values become nearly equal to K_t^ 2 in the applied stress region of 160 ∿ 250 MPa.

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{stock of}} aging office buildings {{will see a}} significant growth in retrofitting projects in Australian capital cities. Stakeholders of refitting works will also need {{to take on the}} sustainability challenge and realize tangible outcomes through project delivery. Traditionally, decision making for aged buildings, when facing the alternatives, is typically economically driven and on ad hoc basis. This leads to the tendency to either delay refitting {{for as long as possible}} thus causing building conditions to deteriorate, or simply demolish and rebuild with unjust financial burden. The technologies involved are often limited to typical strip-clean and repartition with dry walls and office cubicles. Changing business operational patterns, the efficiency of office space, and the demand on improved workplace environment, will need more innovative and intelligent approaches to refurbishing office buildings. For example, such projects may need to respond to political, social, environmental and financial implications. There is a need for <b>the</b> <b>total</b> <b>consideration</b> of buildings structural assessment, modeling of operating and maintenance costs, new architectural and engineering designs that maximise the utility of the existing structure and resulting productivity improvement, specific construction management procedures including procurement methods, work flow and scheduling and occupational health and safety.

This paper introduces examples of Australian research projects which provided a more holistic approach to the decision making of refurbishing office space, using appropriate building technologies and products, assessment of residual service life, floor space optimisation and project procurement in order to bring about sustainable outcomes. The paper also discusses a specific case study on critical factors that influence key building components for these projects and issues for integrated decision support when dealing with the refurbishment, and indeed the “re-life”, of office buildings...|$|E
