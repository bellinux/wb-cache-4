5|$|In {{preparation}} for the offensive, in May 1942, U.S. Major General Alexander Vandegrift was ordered to move his 1st Marine Division from the U.S. to New Zealand. Other Allied land, naval, and air force units were sent to establish bases in Fiji, Samoa, and New Caledonia.

At first, the Allied offensive was planned just for Tulagi and <b>the</b> <b>Santa</b> <b>Cruz</b> Islands, omitting Guadalcanal.

5|$|During October 20, 2006 the Fiji Meteorological Service and the United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center {{started to}} monitor a {{tropical}} depression, that had developed within the South Pacific Convergence Zone {{to the north}} of Temotu Province in the Solomon Islands. The system was located within an area of low to moderate vertical wind shear and had a good outflow in its northern and eastern quadrants. Over the next day conditions surrounding the system rapidly became favourable for further development, with convection starting to wrap into a well defined low level circulation centre. As a result, the depression rapidly developed further and was named Xavier by the FMS during October 22, after it had become a category 1 tropical cyclone on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale. After the system was named the JTWC initiated advisories on the system and designated it as Tropical Cyclone 01P, while it was located over <b>the</b> <b>Santa</b> <b>Cruz</b> Islands. Throughout October 22, Xavier's rapid intensification continued with it developing an eye feature and becoming a category 3 severe tropical cyclone. During that day the system performed a small cyclonic loop over Temotu Province and passed near or over <b>the</b> <b>Santa</b> <b>Cruz</b> Island of Tikopia.|$|E

On 15 November 1942, following the Japanese defeat and the sinking of Hiei and Kirishima during the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal, the Third Battleship Division returned to Truk, where it remained {{for the rest of}} 1942.|$|E

5|$|Saguaro National Park {{lies within}} the {{watershed}} of the north-flowing Santa Cruz River, {{which is generally}} dry.

The creek is a tributary of Pantano Wash, which crosses Tucson from southeast to northwest to meet Tanque Verde Wash. The two washes form the Rillito River, another dry wash, an east–west tributary of <b>the</b> <b>Santa</b> <b>Cruz</b> River. The washes in both districts are usually dry but are subject at times to flash floods. Smaller riparian zones are found near springs and tinajas in the RMD.
