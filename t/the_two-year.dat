50|$|Just {{how much}} mercury was shipped from Sulphur Bank {{is a matter}} of some estimation.

Roadwork began in the fall on <b>the</b> <b>two-year</b> project, and in September 2007 it was finished; complete with four concrete lanes and a center grassy median. Again, intersection improvements were also made, this time adding dual left turn lanes to both east–west approaches at Illinois 83 and Buffalo Grove Road.|$|E

5|$|Berhtwald's {{period as}} {{archbishop}} {{coincided with the}} end of Wilfrid's long struggle to regain the Bishopric of York, and <b>the</b> <b>two-year</b> delay between Theodore's death and Berhtwald's election may have been due to efforts to select Wilfrid for Canterbury. After his election, Berhtwald went to Gaul for consecration and then presided over two councils that attempted to settle the Wilfrid issue, finally succeeding at the second council in 705. Berhtwald also was the recipient of the first surviving letter close in Western Europe.|$|E

5|$|From his {{earliest}} involvement in politics, Cleveland {{aligned with the}} Democratic Party. He had a decided aversion to Republicans John Fremont and Abraham Lincoln, and {{the heads of the}} Rogers law firm were solid Democrats. In 1865, he ran for District Attorney, losing narrowly to his friend and roommate, Lyman K. Bass, the Republican nominee. In 1870, with the help of friend Oscar Folsom, Cleveland secured the Democratic nomination for Sheriff of Erie County, New York. He won the election by a 303-vote margin and took office on January 1, 1871 at age 33. While this new career took him away from the practice of law, it was rewarding in other ways: the fees were said to yield up to $40,000 (US$ today) over <b>the</b> <b>two-year</b> term.|$|E
