500|$|Following {{a period}} of {{political}} disillusion, spent mainly in law school and practicing business law, Satin launched a new political newsletter and wrote a book, Radical Middle (2004). [...] Both projects criticized political partisanship and sought to promote mutual learning and innovative policy syntheses across social and cultural divides. [...] In an interview, Satin contrasts the old radical slogan [...] "Dare to struggle, dare to win" [...] with his radical-middle version, [...] "Dare to synthesize, dare <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> in".|$|E
500|$|In a {{day where}} {{half of the}} week's top-10 teams were defeated, USC escaped {{becoming}} the sixth in a messy, mistake-prone 27–24 victory in a wet, windy game in Seattle. [...] Although USC had a 460–190 edge in total yards, their errors helped the Huskies significantly: They committed threeturnovers and 16penalties—their most in more than twoseasons—for 161yards, missed a field goal and had a punt blocked. [...] A disappointed Pete Carroll noted [...] "We just couldn't do more things wrong in the game [...] I thought Washington was there for it. They were there <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>it.</b> <b>All</b> they needed was onemore chance." ...|$|E
500|$|Speaking {{about the}} {{conception}} of the album, Aguilera told MTV News that [...] "it is a new beginning, a re-introduction {{of myself as a}} new artist in a way, because for the first time people are really seeing and getting to know who I really am". She also revealed, [...] "Coming off of the height of being a part of such a big pop-craze phenomenon, that imagery of that cookie-cutter sweetheart, without it being me, I just had <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> down and get it away from me. And that is why I actually named the album Stripped, because it is about being emotionally stripped down and pretty bare to open my soul and heart". [...] "Walk Away" [...] was written by Aguilera, Scott Storch and Matt Morris, with production handled by Storch.|$|E

[...] "He'll be for laying by business soon, I'll warrant, and be wanting you <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> and pay him so much by th' 'ear. We shall see you living on th' hill before another twelvemont's over." ...|$|R

500|$|Captain America: Civil War was {{the first}} film to use IMAX's digital 2D cameras, made in {{partnership}} with Arri, which was a customized version of the Arri Alexa 65. According to Joe Russo, approximately fifteen minutes of the film, the sequence where the two factions fight at Leipzig/Halle Airport, which was described as having [...] "incredible scale to it" [...] and referred to by the directors as the [...] "splash panel", were shot with the cameras. Opaloch noted that there were discussions late in pre-production to shoot the entire film with the Alexa 65 cameras. However, because of how close {{it was to the}} start of shooting as well as the idea being [...] "such a large-scale undertaking", it was decided to only use them for the airport sequence, with the rest of film being shot on Arri Alexa XT digital cameras. For the airport sequence, Opaloch rigged the Alexa 65s to a Technocrane, a Steadicam, a dolly as well as a drone for flyover shots, which had its own dedicated team operating it. Because of the amount of resolution the Aleax 65s offered, Opaloch chose to use medium close-ups instead of close-ups, and for his wide shots, hold the shot a bit longer, [...] "maybe with a slight camera move that allows the viewer <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> in." ...|$|E
500|$|The album {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 73, based on 21 reviews, which indicates [...] "generally favorable reviews". Dan Martin of NME gave the record {{a very positive}} review, calling a [...] "defining statement" [...] with the band's [...] "most stylistically hatstand-but-indisputably-best songs yet." [...] He wrote, [...] "We're not saying it's as good as genre watermarks American Idiot or The Black Parade. We're just saying it comes close," [...] closing with calling it a [...] "staggering achievement." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic rated the album {{four out of five}} stars and compared it to labelmate Panic! at the Disco's effort earlier in the year, Pretty. Odd. He wrote that [...] "Fall Out Boy capture the Zeitgeist of {{the latter half of the}} 2000s better than any band: there's so much going on in Folie à Deux, you either choose <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> seriously or take none of it. Fall Out Boy make as much sense when heard either way." [...] Scott Heisel wrote for Alternative Press, commending the band for its [...] "creativity, ingenuity and willingness to try just about anything." [...] He compared the meaning of the term folie à deux ("a madness shared by two") to the two very distinct feelings expressed in the different sides of the record, calling the album a good representation of the band's career.|$|E

60|$|Her hand {{hung over}} the side of her chair nearest to him. He looked at it eagerly, but made no {{movement}} <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>it.</b> During <b>all</b> their long comradeship he had never so much as ventured to hold her fingers. This was David Courtlaw, whose ways, too, had never been very different from the ways of other men as regards her sex.|$|R
60|$|Knitting {{his brows}} and {{clenching}} his teeth, Ujarak resolved <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> at <b>all</b> hazards. Bringing the cruel lash to bear with extreme violence, {{he sent the}} dogs howling out upon the glassy surface. At first they slipped and sprawled a good deal, but soon gathered themselves well together. They were accustomed to such work, and the friction of the sledge being reduced, they skimmed along with ease.|$|R

6000|$|... "Yes, I {{am ready}} to do that," [...] {{returned}} the important one promptly; and here, drawing forth the knife once more, he held it out towards them. But instead of coming forward <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> they <b>all</b> recoiled some steps, showing considerable alarm. And then they all began protesting {{that they were not}} complaining of him, that they were satisfied with their choice, and could not have put the matter in abler hands.|$|R

60|$|But Genghis Khan had spies {{in every}} part of the country, and he was soon {{informed}} where Khatun was concealed.

60|$|But Lee had no {{mind for}} the scenery, though her eyes were lifted to the meadow's wall, down which the ranger was {{expected}} to ride. It looked frightfully steep, and whenever she thought of him descending that trail, worn and perhaps ill, her heart ached with anxiety.

[...] "You make my head giddy," [...] she said. [...] "I'm such a poor stupid girl--I feel out of myself, like, when a gentleman like you sets me thinking of new things.

6000|$|... "It is not {{surprising}} that you did not like <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>it.</b> <b>All</b> children, while they are too young to be reasonable, and all animals, such as horses and cows, when they are sick, are very unwilling to take their medicine, and we often have to force it down. You will, perhaps, refuse to take yours a good many times yet before you are old enough to see that it is a great deal easier to take it willingly than it is to have it forced down." ...|$|E
