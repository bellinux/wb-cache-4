40|$|In Germany the aim {{to provide}} {{young people with}} {{sufficient}} <b>training</b> <b>places</b> meets with great approval. The realisation of this aim is, however, in danger at present. The number of companies providing training {{and the number of}} <b>training</b> <b>places</b> available have fallen considerably {{in the last ten years}} in western Germany. In contrast the number of school-leavers has been increasing again since the mid-nineties. In order to ensure an adequate supply of <b>training</b> <b>places,</b> education policy requires projections as to the future demand for <b>training</b> <b>places.</b> Such prognoses, however, have to struggle with a dilemma. For as the following article shows, demand does not develop independently of supply. In order to be able to forecast exactly the future demand for <b>training</b> <b>places,</b> it would therefore actually be necessary to know how the supply of <b>training</b> <b>places</b> will develop. Demand projections are usually based on demarcations of the demand obtained by adding together the number of newly concluded training contracts (realised demand) and the number of applicants for <b>training</b> <b>places</b> registered at the employment office but not placed by the record date. Latent demand is not taken into account in this. If there is a drop in the supply of <b>training</b> <b>places,</b> however, this latent demand grows more strongly than the number of applicants who have not been <b>placed</b> in <b>training,</b> and helps to even out the statistical reference day results. As a consequence this means that demand figures which are recorded in times when there is a lack of <b>training</b> <b>places</b> and used as the basis for the demand forecast underestimate the actual demand if a more substantial supply of <b>training</b> <b>places</b> is made available in the forecast period. Furthermore this means that when there is a lack of <b>training</b> <b>places,</b> a declining demand rate can be expected as a result of the development of the supply of <b>training</b> <b>places</b> alone. Declining demand rates must therefore not simply be interpreted as a decrease in young people's interest. On the contrary, under the present circumstances these rates are more an indication of a reduced interest on the part of the companies in training within the dual system of vocational training.

30|$|The {{results of}} this {{analysis}} demonstrate a clear link between the development of demand and supply in VET only before 1990.

These empirical findings confirm the view of Busemeyer (2009) that the economy in the observed period reacted positively to political appeals to provide for young people.|$|R

30|$|In {{the dual}} system two issues {{need to be}} explained: First, the {{long-term}} decrease and the short-term stagnation of the supply for <b>training</b> <b>places.</b> Second, the inability of corporatist governance to supply <b>training</b> <b>places</b> according to demand and {{to solve the problems}} of transition from general education to vocational education in the past decade. To avoid explaining both issues by categories of actions taken by management and/or trade unions—which is often done in the daily policy debates—one needs to focus on the structural socioeconomic conditions underlying the actions of both firms and corporatist representatives.|$|R

50|$|The army's Yamasaki Training Area, placed {{after the}} Satsuma Rebellion, blocked traffic and the {{development}} of Kumamoto City.

In 1907, Kumamoto Light railway company started, which later changed to Kumamoto Electric Railway Company and then to streetcars. Public organizations were invited, such as the 5th Higher Middle School in 1887 which changed to the 5th High School in 1894, Tobacco Monopoly Bureau in 1911.
