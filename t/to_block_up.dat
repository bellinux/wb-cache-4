5|$|In 1370 the French made a {{successful}} attack on Portsmouth, commencing a new sequence of raids along the English coast. In due course first Edward, then Richard II, responded by improving the defences {{in the south}} of England. Part of this involved improving the condition of Southampton Castle, where, owing in part to the theft of building materials, including stone and lead, by the citizens of the town, the defences were in a poor condition. Henry Yevele, who oversaw the improvements to the castle, probably also constructed the Arcades along the western walls in 1380: this involved adopting the 1360 proposal <b>to</b> <b>block</b> <b>up</b> the properties along the western quay to form a solid wall, and adding three towers and gunports. Sir John Sondes and John Polymond were appointed by the king in 1386 to further improve the town walls, working with Sir John Arundel, the castle governor – Polymond and Arundel Towers were probably named after these men around this time.|$|E
25|$|Although the British {{intelligence}} {{doubted that}} the French invasion would take place, the counter-invasion orders of 1797 were reintroduced. The number of sloops and gun brigs in the Channel Islands were increased. In the southern counties cattle were driven inland, and main roads were blocked. Nelson, who {{recently returned from}} the Baltic, received detailed instructions of the admiralty to be employed in the defence of the mouths of the Thames and Medway, and {{all parts of the}} coast of Sussex, Essex and Kent. He was also required <b>to</b> <b>block</b> <b>up</b> or destroy, if practicable, the French vessels and craft in the ports wherein they may be assembled. All the intelligence pointed to Boulogne as the main port in which the French invasion craft were gathering, so Lord Nelson set course to there.|$|E
25|$|Butler and Stringham left {{immediately}} after the battle, the former to Washington and the latter accompanying the prisoners to New York. Critics argued that each was trying to gather credit for the victory to himself. The pair contended, however, {{that they were trying}} to persuade the administration to abandon the original plan <b>to</b> <b>block</b> <b>up</b> Hatteras Inlet. In Federal hands it was no longer useful to the Confederacy, and in fact now allowed Union forces to pursue raiders into the sounds. Although they and their supporters continued to press the case for several weeks, it seems to have been unnecessary. The War and Navy Departments had already decided to retain possession of the inlet, which would be used as the entry point of an amphibious expedition against the North Carolina mainland early the next year. This campaign, known as Burnside's North Carolina Expedition for its senior Army commander Ambrose E. Burnside, completely removed the sounds as sources of commerce-raiding activity.|$|E

500|$|Reece Thompson plays Hal Hefner, a shy fifteen-year-old {{student at}} Plainsboro High School, New Jersey with a {{pronounced}} stutter. Beginning in late 2004, Rocket Sciences producers traveled to several American and Canadian cities {{looking for an}} actor to play the lead role of Hal. At one point, Carter Jenkins was set to play Hal, but NBC blocked this as he was contracted for further episodes of Surface. HBO Films told the producers {{after six months of}} searching for a Hal that it would abandon the project if a lead actor was not found in two weeks, at which point a desperate Jeffrey Blitz watched all of the unsolicited audition tapes that he had been sent and [...] "knew immediately we had a promising candidate" [...] when he saw Thompson's tape. Although a casting call was originally posted for a teenage boy aged 13–18 who had a stutter and could also act, Thompson had previously been taught how to stutter. However Blitz wanted Hal to stutter in a different style, knowing he was going <b>to</b> <b>block</b> <b>up</b> on a particular word and looking for ways to work round it. Before filming, Thompson was taught this specific style by a speech pathologist.|$|E

60|$|For a {{long time}} it had been thought that Cervera would try {{to escape from the}} harbor, in which he could not be reached because of the strong forts that {{protected}} the entrance.

This heroic work was undertaken by Lieutenant Hobson with a crew of seven daring men, but the plan failed, for the Merrimac, instead of sinking where intended, swung {{to one side of the}} main channel.|$|E
60|$|The secret passage {{was next}} investigated; {{it was found}} that the opening was about half-way down the rock, and that the assailants must have climbed up by a path that a goat could scarce traverse.

60|$|The {{next day}} was the longest in Silas's memory; {{it seemed as if}} it would never be done.

So distressing did this become, that he was at last obliged <b>to</b> <b>block</b> <b>up</b> the spy-hole from his own side; and when he was thus secured from observation he spent a considerable portion of his time in contrite tears and prayer.|$|E
60|$|When, at length, Caesar {{arrived at}} Brundusium, {{he found that}} Pompey had sent {{a part of his}} army across the Adriatic into Greece, and was waiting for the {{transports}} to return that he might go over himself with the remainder. In the mean time, he had fortified himself strongly in the city. Caesar immediately laid siege to the place, and he commenced some works <b>to</b> <b>block</b> <b>up</b> the mouth of the harbor. He built piers on each side, extending out as far into the sea as the depth of the water would allow them to be built. He then constructed a series of rafts, which he anchored on the deep water, in a line extending from one pier to the other. He built towers upon these rafts, and garrisoned them with soldiers, in hopes by this means to prevent all egress from the fort. He thought that, when this work was completed, Pompey would be entirely shut in, beyond all possibility of escape.|$|E

5000|$|In the {{milieu of}} levering methods, {{there are those}} that lift the block incrementally, as in {{repeatedly}} prying up alternating sides of the block and inserting a wooden or stone shims to gradually move the stone up one course; {{and there are other}} methods that use a larger lever <b>to</b> move the <b>block</b> <b>up</b> one course in one lifting procedure. Since the discussion of construction techniques <b>to</b> lift the <b>blocks</b> attempts <b>to</b> resolve a gap in the archaeological and historical record with a plausible functional explanation, the following examples by Isler, Keable, and Hussey-Pailos [...] list experimentally tested methods. Isler's method (1985, 1987) is an incremental method and, in the Nova experiment (1992), used wooden shims or cribbing. Isler [...] was able <b>to</b> lift a <b>block</b> <b>up</b> one tier in approximately one hour and 30 minutes. Peter Hodges’s and Julian Keable’s method is similar to Isler's method and instead used small manufactured concrete blocks as shims, wooden pallets, and a pit where their experimental tests were performed. Keable was able to perform his method in approximately 2 minutes. Scott Hussey-Pailos's (2005) method [...] uses a simple levering device <b>to</b> lift a <b>block</b> <b>up</b> a course in one movement. This method was tested with materials of less strength than historical analogs (tested with materials weaker than those available in ancient Egypt), a factor of safety of 2, and lifted a 2500-pound <b>block</b> <b>up</b> one course in under a minute. This method is presented as a levering device to work complementary with Mark Lehner's idea of a combined ramp and levering techniques.|$|R

6000|$|He {{was a quiet}} man, {{dressed in}} dark clothes, with a large limp straw hat; with {{something}} almost military in his moustache and whiskers, but with a quite unmilitary stoop and very dreamy eyes. He was gazing with a rather gloomy interest at the cluster, one might almost say the tangle, of small shipping which grew thicker as our little pleasure boat crawled up into Yarmouth Harbour. A boat entering this harbour, as every one knows, does not enter {{in front of the}} town like a foreigner, but creeps round at the back like a traitor taking the town in the rear. The passage of the river seems almost too narrow for traffic, and in consequence the bigger ships look colossal. As we passed under a timber ship from Norway, which seemed <b>to</b> <b>block</b> <b>up</b> the heavens like a cathedral, the man in a straw hat pointed to an odd wooden figurehead carved like a woman, and said, like one continuing a conversation, [...] "Now, why have they left off having them. They didn't do any one any harm?" ...|$|E
60|$|In this manner, he journeyed onward {{three days}} and two nights, and came, on the third evening, {{to the mouth of}} a cave, which, at first sight, {{reminded}} him of Elijah's cave at Horeb, though perhaps it more resembled Abraham's sepulchral cave at Machpelah. It entered into the heart of a rocky hill. There was so dense a veil of tangled foliage about it, that none but a sworn lover of gloomy recesses would have discovered the low arch of its entrance, or have dared to step within its vaulted chamber, where the burning eyes of a panther might encounter him. If Nature meant this remote and dismal cavern for the use of man, it could only be to bury in its gloom the victims of a pestilence, and then <b>to</b> <b>block</b> <b>up</b> its mouth with stones, and avoid the spot forever after. There was nothing bright nor cheerful near it, except a bubbling fountain, some twenty paces off, at which Richard Digby hardly threw away a glance. But he thrust his head into the cave, shivered, and congratulated himself.|$|E
6000|$|Lee now {{proceeded}} with his plan of defences. A strong redoubt, capable of holding three hundred men, was commenced at Horen's Hook, commanding the pass at Hell Gate, so as <b>to</b> <b>block</b> <b>up</b> from the enemy's ships the passage between {{the mainland and}} Long Island. A regiment was stationed on the island, making fascines, and preparing other materials for constructing the works for an intrenched camp, which Lee hoped would render {{it impossible for the}} enemy to get a footing there. [...] "What to do with this city," [...] writes he, [...] "I own, puzzles me. It is so encircled with deep navigable water, that whoever commands the sea must command the town. To-morrow I shall begin to dismantle that part of the fort next to the town, to prevent its being converted into a citadel. I shall barrier the principal streets, and, at least, if I cannot make it a continental garrison, it shall be a disputable field of battle." [...] Batteries were to be erected on an eminence behind Trinity Church, to keep the enemy's ships at so great a distance as not to injure the town.|$|E
6000|$|Expresses {{were sent}} off to hurry up the militia ordered out by Lord Fairfax.
