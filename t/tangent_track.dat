40|$|AbstractWith {{a closed}} shroud {{on the top}} of their blades, the {{so-called}} integral shrouded blisks gained more and more applications in turbine engines. 5 -axis electrical discharge machining (EDM) is regarded as the most effective approach for integral shrouded blisks machining. The tool electrode is shaped and reduced according to the profile of the flow channels to get enough space for electrode feeding. The key of EDM of integral shrouded blisks is to search an interference-free and optimized electrode feeding path. In this paper, a new electrode feeding path searching method called <b>tangent</b> <b>tracking</b> was proposed. Based on the dynamic programming methodology, the electrode feeding path searching process is decomposed into a number of electrode attitude optimization subproblems. Each subproblem can be further divided into two phases: pre-optimization and re-optimization. The purpose of electrode attitude pre-optimization is to make the tangent vector of the electrode centre curve coincide with that of the flow channel centre curve at the flow channels outlet section. If the electrode interferes with the blisk in the pre-optimization, the re-optimization needs to be conducted in order to find an interference-free attitude {{in the vicinity of the}} pre-optimized result. The <b>tangent</b> <b>tracking</b> method is validated by an integral shrouded blisk machining experiment...|$|R
40|$|The rail is a {{structural}} component of track {{that serves as}} the running surface, guiding element, load carrier and distributor. The wear of rail is of great interest since it is known to be an important degradation mode that can limit the performance of rail, reduce its life span and significantly increase the life cycle cost of track if not well managed. It is therefore pertinent to study the wear behaviour of rail under increased loading condition and adopted grinding strategy. In this paper, the analysis of rail profile measurement data collected between 2008 and 2013 has been carried out. This is used to evaluate the wear characteristics of curves with different radii on the Swedish iron ore line to provide engineering insight for improving maintenance for better rail performance. The result shows that the average natural wear rate on sharp curves is about 2 times the wear rate on the mild curves and 5 times the wear rate on the <b>tangent</b> <b>tracks.</b> In addition, the typical total wear on sharp curves after 6 years is over 250 mm 2 which is about 1 ½ and 2 ½ times the wear on mild curves and <b>tangent</b> <b>tracks</b> respectivelyGodkänd; 2015; 20150807 (stefam...|$|R

At {{the time the}} 'Uptop' depot on Veta Pass, rising over [...] in {{elevation}}, boasted the highest elevation for a narrow-gauge railroad. The railroad reached Alamosa by 1878. From Alamosa, a line was pushed south through Antonito eventually reaching Santa Fe, New Mexico (the Chili Line) and west as far as Creede, Colorado.

A line was also constructed in 1902 as a standard-gauge line, perhaps in anticipation of possible standard gauging of the entire line, south from Durango, Colorado to Farmington, New Mexico. Originally hauling mainly agricultural products and serving as a deterrent to the Santa Fe building up from the south, the line was converted to narrow gauge in 1923, and later delivered pipe and other construction materials to the local oil and natural gas industry into the 1960s.|$|R
40|$|Because thermal {{expansions}} are constrained within continuous {{welded rail}} track, the track can buckle, and does so mainly in the horizontal plane. In this paper, a parametric finite element model of railway track is presented, and its sensitivity to the variations of the main parameters that characterise the scenario has been investigated and discussed. Comparison with existing literature shows good agreement. It is found that curved tracks suffer from thermal buckling more than <b>tangent</b> <b>tracks</b> do. To simulate a track misalignment defect, a new methodology has been utilised that does not introduce, as is usual, geometrical discontinuities near the same defect, because it takes into account – in a natural way – the bending stiffness of the whole railway track in the horizontal plane. To contribute {{to a better understanding}} of the safe utilisation of raw experimental data obtained from in situ tests, a deep analysis of the effects on the thermal track buckling response produced by each parameter characterising the sleeper–ballast lateral resistance curve is presented and discussed. It is found that for current ballasted railway tracks, the minimum buckling temperature depends only on the limit lateral resistance, whereas a high value of the initial stiffness can lead to overestimation of the maximum buckling temperature, also taking into account the ‘natural’ decrease in the maximum buckling temperature due to an increase in the railway-traffic-induced defect amplitude...|$|R

40|$|A {{mathematical}} {{dynamic model}} of railway conventional truck is presented with 12 {{degrees of freedom}} equations of motion. The presented dynamic system consists of conventional truck attached with two single wheelsets in which equipped with lateral, longitudinal and vertical linear stiffness and damping primary and secondary suspensions. This investigated model governs lateral displacement, vertical displacement, roll yaw angles of each of wheelset and the lateral displacement, vertical displacement, roll and yaw angle of conventional truck. Kalker's linear theory has been adopted to evaluate the creep forces which are introduced on rail wheels due to rail wheel contact. The railway truck mathematical equations of motion are solved using fourth order Rung-Kutta method which requires that differential equations to {{be transformed into a}} set of first order differential equations. The transformed state space equations are simulated with computer aided simulation to represent the dynamic behavior and time solution of dynamics of conventional truck moving on <b>tangent</b> <b>tracks.</b> Influences of the geometric parameters of the rail wheel such as wheel conicity and nominal rolling radius on the dynamic stability of the system are investigated. It is concluded that the geometric parameters of the rail wheel have different effects on the hunting instability and on the change of the critical hunting velocity of the system. In addition critical hunting velocity of rail trucks is proportional inversely with the square roots of wheel conicity but high critical hunting velocity obtained by increasing the nominal rolling radius of the rail wheel...|$|R
40|$|Heavier {{trains and}} higher speeds have {{increased}} the need for high-quality tracks and vehicles {{in order to fulfill}} safety and environmental requests. The phenomena involved in dynamic train/track interaction lead to noise radiation, induce ground-borne vibrations and degrade the track structure and the railcar wheels. Increased axle-loads and higher train speeds also accentuate the influence on the dynamic train/track interaction of imperfections appearing in the track structure and on the wheel tread. A special type of track imperfection is the so-called rail corrugation, which is a periodic vertical irregularity on the railhead. The present thesis is concerned with the vertical dynamic interaction between the moving train and the track, and, in particular, with the modelling of corrugation growth on <b>tangent</b> <b>tracks.</b> Models of increasing complexity are developed, in-field measurements are performed, and realistic track parameters are sought for. The influence of different imperfections, such as rail corrugation, a hung sleeper or a wheelflat, on the wheel/rail contact force and on the track response is investigated. Physical explanations of the calculated interaction behaviour are given. The importance of including both of the two wheelsets in the bogie model is demonstrated and clarified. By use of factorial design methods, the influences of changes in some track parameters on the wheel/rail contact force when a wheelset passes a track having a random railhead irregularity are studied. The calculated results are compared to experimental results from full-scale measurements. A new ballast/subgrade model is suggested where measured frequency response functions together with an optimization routine are used to find the best values of the track parameters. The corrugation growth model {{is based on the assumption}} that, on <b>tangent</b> <b>tracks,</b> the damage mechanism is wear from longitudinal slip due to driven, or braked, wheels. Setting out from an initial random railhead irregularity distribution, the corrugation growth is calculated as a function of the wave number of the irregularity. The results clearly show that, for a fixed train speed, the amplitude of irregularities of certain wavelengths will grow while the amplitudes of other irregularities will be smoothened. Comparisons between different corrugation models are carried out. The distribution of the wear within the contact area and also the shift of contact point is found to be important for the corrugation growth. The track models used for the calculations are linear non-proportionally damped beam structures which are longitudinally rigid. Finite elements are employed and, in order to save computational time, the equations of motion for the track model are decoupled by use of complex-valued modal analysis. The vehicle is modelled as a discrete system of masses, springs and viscous dampers, which may be non-linear. Vertically, the wheel/rail contact is assumed to be Hertzian. The longitudinal contact is treated by use of a heuristic model for stationary rolling contact mechanics. The friction force influences the vertical dynamics of the track by applying a bending moment to the rail. Also, the longitudinal creepage depends on the rotation of the cross section of the rail and the angular velocity of the wheel. The friction law used is verified against the so-called exact theory for elastic stationary rolling contact. The system of equations governing the motion of the track, the motion of the vehicle, and the vertical and longitudinal wheel/rail contact is solved by use of a time stepping routine. The wear is taken as proportional to the frictional power and is assigned, at each time step, to the centroid of the wear distribution in the contact patch...|$|R
40|$|Published {{studies in}} regard to coupler systems have been mainly focused on the {{manufacturing}} process or coupler strength issues. With the ever increasing of tonnage and length of heavy haul trains, lateral in-train forces generated by longitudinal in-train forces and coupler rotations have become a more and more significant safety issue for heavy haul train operations. Derailments caused by excessive lateral in-train forces are frequently reported. This article studies two typical coupler systems used on heavy haul locomotives. Their structures and stabilizing mechanism are analyzed before the corresponding models are developed. Coupler systems models are featured by two distinct stabilizing mechanism models and draft gear models with hysteresis considered. A model set which consists of four locomotives and three coupler systems is developed to study the rotational behavior of different coupler systems and their implications for locomotive dynamics. Simulated results indicate that when the locomotives are equipped with the type B coupler system, locomotives can meet the dynamics standard on tangent tracks; while the dynamics performance on curved tracks is very poor. The maximum longitudinal in-train force for locomotives equipped with the type B coupler system is 2000 kN. Simulations revealed a distinct trend for the type A coupler system. Locomotive dynamics are poorer for the type A case when locomotives are running on <b>tangent</b> <b>tracks,</b> while the dynamics are better for the type A case when locomotives are running on curved tracks.

40|$|Abstract—Our goal is {{to develop}} {{statistical}} models for the shape change of a configuration of “landmark ” points (key points of interest) over time and to use these models for filtering and tracking to automatically extract landmarks, synthesis, and change detection. The term “shape activity ” was introduced in recent work to denote a particular stochastic model for the dynamics of landmark shapes (dynamics after global translation, scale, and rotation effects are normalized for). In that work, only models for stationary shape sequences were proposed. But most “activities ” {{of a set of}} landmarks, e. g., running, jumping, or crawling, have large shape changes with respect to initial shape and hence are nonstationary. The key contribution of this work is a novel approach to define a generative model for both 2 D and 3 D nonstationary landmark shape sequences. Greatly improved performance using the proposed models is demonstrated for sequentially filtering noise-corrupted landmark configurations to compute Minimum Mean Procrustes Square Error (MMPSE) estimates of the true shape and for tracking human activity videos, i. e., for using the filtering to predict the locations of the landmarks (body parts) and using this prediction for faster and more accurate landmarks extraction from the current image.
