Under such conditions, the inhibition of the bacterial growth occurs solely in the confluence area of the substances. The neutralization of amoxicillin through penicillinase respectively after 4, 6, and 24 h of incubation makes possible an appraisal of the bactericidal action of the association.

The lowest specific contact resistivity obtained was based on a <b>triple</b> <b>layer</b> Al/Ti/Al contact, measured at 5. 0 x 10 (- 6) Omega cm(2). Analogously, for the <b>triple</b> <b>layer</b> contacts comprised of Al/Ni/Al, the lowest specific contact resistivity was measured at 4. 9 x 10 (- 4) Omega cm(2). In all cases {{it was found that the}} multiple layer structures remained rectifying even after annealing.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) scans point to enhanced formation of silicides for <b>triple</b> <b>layer</b> contacts based on Al/Ti (Ti 3 SiC 2) and Al/Ni (NiSi,) when compared to multiple layer contacts. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) and wavelength dispersive analysis (WDA) measurements indicate that a multiple layer metallisation improves the morphology of the contact with respect to the Al spreading, which is known to be problematic during a high temperature anneal.

In this thesis, coupling effects between switchable ferroelectric and non-switchable piezoelectric semiconductor spontaneous polarizations are addressed. Also discussed is a dielectric continuum model approach for studying LCC effects in double layer piezoelectric semiconductor-ferroelectric and <b>triple</b> <b>layer</b> piezoelectric semiconductor-ferroelectric-piezoelectric semiconductor heterostructures. The dielectric continuum model augments the effects of electric field driven switchable polarization due to LCC with depletion layer formation in semiconductor heterostructures. ^ Electrical investigations were used to study a reference single layer (BaTiO 3), a double layer (BaTiO 3 -ZnO), and a <b>triple</b> <b>layer</b> (ZnO-BaTiO 3 -ZnO) heterostructure grown by pulsed laser deposition. The coupling between the non-switchable spontaneous polarization of ZnO and the electrically switchable spontaneous polarization of BaTiO 3 causes strong asymmetric polarization hysteresis behavior. The n-type ZnO layer within double and <b>triple</b> <b>layered</b> heterostructures reveals hysteresis-dependent capacitance variations upon formation of depletion layers at the ZnO/BaTiO 3 interfaces. Model analysis show very good agreement between the generated data and the experimental results. The dielectric continuum model approach allows for the derivation of the amount and orientation of the spontaneous polarization of the piezoelectric constituents, and can be generalized towards multiple layer piezoelectric semiconductor-ferroelectric heterostructures. ^ Based on experimental results the polarization coupled ZnO-BaTiO 3 -ZnO heterostructures is identified as a two-terminal unipolar ferroelectric bi-junction transistor which can be utilized in memory storage devices.

40|$|The Masaya Caldera Complex {{has been}} the site of three highly {{explosive}} basaltic eruptions within the last six thousand years. A Plinian eruption ca. 2 ka ago formed the widespread deposits of the Masaya <b>Triple</b> <b>Layer.</b> We distinguish two facies within the Masaya <b>Triple</b> <b>Layer</b> from each other: La Concepción facies {{to the south and}} Managua facies to the northwest. These two facies were previously treated as two separated deposits (La Concepción Tephra and the Masaya <b>Triple</b> <b>Layer</b> of Pérez and Freundt, 2006) because of their distinct regional distribution and internal architectures. However, chemical compositions of bulk rock, matrix and inclusion glasses and mineral phases demonstrate that they are the product of a single basaltic magma batch. Additionally, a marker bed containing fluidal-shaped vesicular lapilli allowed us to make a plausible correlation between the two facies, also supported by consistent lateral changes in lithologic structure and composition, thickness and grain size. We distinguish 10 main subunits of the Masaya <b>Triple</b> <b>Layer</b> (I to X), with bulk volumes ranging between 0. 02 and 0. 22 km 3, adding up to 0. 86 km 3 (0. 4 km 3 DRE) for the entire deposit. Distal deposits identified in two cores drilled offshore Nicaragua, at a distance of ∼ 170 km from the Masaya Caldera Complex, increase the total tephra volume to 3. 4 km 3 or ∼ 1. 8 km 3 DRE of erupted basaltic magma. Isopleth data of five major fallout subunits indicate mass discharges of 106 to 108 kg/s and eruption columns of 21 to 32 km height, affected by wind speeds of < 2 m/s to ∼ 20 m/s which increased {{during the course of the}} multi-episodic eruption. Magmatic Plinian events alternated with phreatoplinian eruptions and phreatomagmatic explosions generating surges that typically preceded breaks in activity.

For each run set, four 1 -inch diameter permeation cells (three cells with 10 mL 2 -BE as challenge and one air blank (1)) were used with 10 mL deionized water as the collection solvent in a water bath shaken at 72. 3 ï¿½ 0. 58 revolution/minute (4. 82 ï¿½ 0. 04 cm/second) at 35. 0 ï¿½ 0. 5 ï¿½C. 0. 1 mL aliquots were sampled at 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 135, 240, 360, and 480 minutes. Capillary column gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC- MS) utilized mass to charge ratios 2 -BE at m/z= 57 and 87, and 4 -bromophenol (4 -BP) internal standard at m/z= 174 (1). The retention times for 2 -BE and 4 -BP were 4. 8 min and 7. 9 min. SBRT were found between 5 to 10 minutes for single, between 10 to 20 minutes for double, and between 30 to 40 minutes for <b>triple</b> <b>layers,</b> though thus not statistically different at p≤ 0. 050. Single gloving had a rating of ‘poor,’ while double and triple gloving were ‘good,’ based on Kimberly Clark Professional permeation breakthrough time criteria. The other statistically different comparison was for the mass/area permeation at 30 minutes for the <b>triple</b> <b>layer</b> relative to a single layer. The average SSPR were 41. 20 ï¿½ 8. 81 μg/cm 2 /min for single gloving, 48. 48 ï¿½ 55. 57 μg/cm 2 /min for double gloving, and 5. 39 ï¿½ 4. 64 μg/cm 2 /min for triple gloving. Both single and double gloving had a rating of good, and triple gloving had a rating of very good based on Ansell permeation rate criteria for Chemical Resistant Gloves. Thus, multiple layers did tend to prolong SBRT, but only <b>triple</b> <b>layers</b> definitely lowered the SSPR...|$|R
40|$|Aim: The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the microleakage in Class II box {{preparations}} with the gingival margin above and below the cemento-enamel junction (CEJ) restored with Silorane composite and methacrylate composite using two different <b>layering</b> <b>techniques.</b> Materials and Methods: Standardized box preparations (mesial box 1 mm above the CEJ and distal box 1 mm below the CEJ) were prepared in 60 upper premolars. The teeth were randomly divided into four groups containing 15 samples each; Group I: Restored with a Silorane composite using an oblique <b>layering</b> <b>technique,</b> Group II: Restored with Silorane composite using a vertical <b>layering</b> <b>technique,</b> Group III: Restored with methacrylate composite using the oblique <b>layering</b> <b>technique,</b> and Group IV: Restored with methacrylate composite using the vertical <b>layering</b> <b>technique.</b> The samples were stored in distilled water, followed by thermocycling and immersed in 2 % methylene blue. The samples were sectioned and evaluated for microleakage at the gingival margin. Statistical Analysis: Kruskal-Wallis, Fischer exact test, Wilicoxon test, and Mann-Whitney U test. Results: Silorane composite had significantly lesser microleakage. No significant difference in microleakage was observed above and below the CEJ for Silorane-based composite. Conclusion: Silorane composite resin showed lesser microleakage compared to methacrylate composite resin. Clinical Significance: The Silorane-based composites improve the marginal adaptation due to their reduced shrinkage, thereby decreasing the residual stress at the adhesive-tooth interface...|$|R
40|$|The {{electrical}} {{double layer}} at infinite flat solid surface was discussed {{with respect to}} the <b>triple</b> <b>layer</b> model. Charge density at the outer Helmholtz plane is assumed to be zero usually. However, the assumption causes the position of the outer Helmholtz plane to be obscure. The charge density was calculated and the condition that the charge density is negligible was discussed. Comment: Unfortunately, the previous version has a crucial misconcept. It is correcte...|$|R
