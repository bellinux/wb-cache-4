5|$|Clinton {{was inaugurated}} as the 42nd President of the United States on January 20, 1993. Less {{than a month}} after taking office, he signed <b>the</b> <b>Family</b> <b>and</b> <b>Medical</b> Leave Act of 1993, which {{required}} large employers to allow employees to take unpaid leave for pregnancy or a serious medical condition. This action had bipartisan support, and was popular with the public.|$|E
25|$|In {{what was}} to be a forerunner of <b>the</b> <b>Family</b> <b>and</b> <b>Medical</b> Leave Act of 1993, then teacher Ackerman {{successfully}} sued the Board in a landmark case which established the right of either parent to receive unpaid leave for child care. A quarter of a century later, now a Congressman, Ackerman in the House-Senate Conference Committee, signed the report of <b>the</b> <b>Family</b> <b>and</b> <b>Medical</b> Leave Act which became the law of the land.|$|E

50|$|In {{addition}} to <b>the</b> <b>Family</b> Leave <b>and</b> <b>Medical</b> Act, {{there are many}} other federal and state statutes that allow employees legal time off from work. Massachusetts enacted the Small Necessities Leave Act in 1998 which expanded upon the rights guaranteed by the FMLA.|$|R
3000|$|... 7 This {{contrasts}} starkly {{with the}} results for other state family leave laws (most of which extend rights to unpaid leave beyond those in <b>the</b> 1993 <b>Family</b> <b>and</b> <b>Medical</b> Leave Act, where the estimated effects are much larger for college-educated and married women than for their less advantaged counterparts (Han et al. (2009)).|$|R
25|$|Obama {{has said}} that he {{supports}} same sex couples adopting children. Obama extended <b>the</b> <b>Family</b> <b>and</b> <b>Medical</b> Leave Act of 1993 to cover employees taking unpaid leave to care for the children of same-sex partners.|$|E
25|$|Women in the {{workforce}} have tripled and as their numbers increase it has been hard for both mothers and fathers {{to be able to}} take care of their own newborn child or a sick family member. <b>The</b> <b>Family</b> <b>and</b> <b>Medical</b> Leave Act of 1993 has allowed for workers to have up to 12 weeks a year to leave work.|$|E
25|$|The CWA {{opposed the}} 1988 Act for Better Child Care (H.R. 3660), {{which would have}} {{provided}} government-sponsored child care for families in which both parents are working. The CWA also testified against <b>the</b> <b>Family</b> <b>and</b> <b>Medical</b> Leave Act {{on the premise that}} it was biased against those who could not afford to take leave.|$|E

5000|$|Information about {{different}} types of leave, including holidays, paid time off (PTO), sick time, personal leave, military leave, bereavement, and voting leave. If the employer is covered by <b>the</b> U.S. <b>Family</b> <b>and</b> <b>Medical</b> Leave Act of 1993 - generally 50 or more employees - a handbook usually contains information about FMLA and often includes specific policies for parental <b>and</b> <b>medical</b> leave.|$|R
5000|$|The {{hospitals}} {{involved in}} the programme receive weekly visits from [...] "Giggle Doctors". The Giggle Doctors use their skills to involve each patient as much as possible, ensuring {{that the child is}} not only a spectator but can participate in the magic and the activities. The Giggle Doctors also involve <b>the</b> <b>families</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>medical</b> staff in these sessions.|$|R
25|$|Some {{new mothers}} (and fathers) in the US will take unpaid time off, allowed by <b>the</b> <b>Family</b> <b>and</b> <b>Medical</b> Leave Act. The FMLA entitles {{eligible}} employees of covered employers to take unpaid, job-protected leave for specified {{family and medical}} reasons with continuation of group health insurance coverage under the same terms and conditions as if the employee had not taken leave.|$|E
25|$|A {{majority}} opinion in Chittister v. Department of Community & Economic Development, 226 F.3d 223 (3d Cir. 2000). This case concerned an employee's claim of wrongful termination under <b>the</b> <b>Family</b> <b>and</b> <b>Medical</b> Leave Act {{against the state}} of Pennsylvania. States are free to maintain sovereign immunity under the U.S. Constitution. Since Pennsylvania had maintained its immunity to such suits, Alito affirmed the lower court's dismissal of the employee’s claims.|$|E
25|$|Altmire gained {{national}} attention with {{his effort to}} guarantee enlistment bonuses of combat-wounded veterans and was the principal author {{of the law that}} expands <b>the</b> <b>Family</b> <b>and</b> <b>Medical</b> Leave Act to cover military guard and reserve families. He also personally intervened with President George W. Bush's administration and successfully forced a 2007 policy change allowing Vietnam-era Gold Star families access to White House tours after a constituent was denied.|$|E
50|$|Chittister v. Department of Community & Economic Development was a U.S. {{legal case}} about whether {{states may be}} {{subjected}} to money damages for failing to comply with <b>the</b> <b>family</b> care provision in <b>the</b> federal <b>Family</b> <b>and</b> <b>Medical</b> Leave Act (FMLA). A decision by the lower {{circuit court of appeals}} in favor of the state was overturned by the Supreme Court of the United States.|$|R
50|$|The statute {{states that}} PFL {{must be taken}} {{concurrently}} with leave under <b>the</b> federal <b>Family</b> <b>and</b> <b>Medical</b> Leave Act (FMLA) <b>and</b> <b>the</b> California <b>Family</b> Rights Act (CFRA), both of which provide for twelve weeks of unpaid leave in a twelve-month period. In other words, the FMLA and CFRA offer job protection for up to twelve weeks of family leave whereas PFL offers compensation {{for up to six}} weeks.|$|R

25|$|Some of {{the goals}} and {{institutions}} that Clinton advocates for in the book include: <b>the</b> <b>Family</b> <b>and</b> <b>Medical</b> Leave Act of 1993, the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, Community Policing, the Brady Bill, Amber Alerts, immunizations, State Children's Health Insurance Program, financial regulation, expanded Child Tax Credits, Minimum Wage increases, Universal health care, personal responsibility, uniforms in schools, Goals 2000 academic framework, music warning labels, sexual abstinence, Plan B contraception, family planning, and marriage.|$|E
25|$|If {{government}} support for workplace family-friendly policies or childcare subsidies was stronger, more solutions could be attempted. For example, child care subsidies {{by the government}} actually result in less childcare and work disruptions and could impact low-income families as well by making childcare more affordable. However, {{government support}} is not {{at the level of}} other developed countries. Legislation such as <b>the</b> <b>Family</b> <b>and</b> <b>Medical</b> Leave Act had little impact on gender inequality in care work and was strongly opposed by businesses.|$|E

5000|$|Fuse {{publicly}} criticized Tom {{for supporting}} legislation to repeal <b>the</b> state’s <b>Family</b> <b>and</b> <b>Medical</b> Leave Act [...] and co-sponsoring {{a bill to}} undercut the minimum wage by instituting a temporary [...] "training wage" [...] for new workers. In an effort to attract attention to the “training wage,” Fuse organized a press conference during which House Democrats Mike Sells, Timm Ormsby, Sherry Appleton, and Laurie Jinkins introduced legislation to establish a “training wage” for freshmen legislators.|$|R

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Family</b> <b>and</b> <b>Medical</b> Leave Act of 1993 {{requires}} {{employers to}} provide job-protected unpaid leave for certain {{family and medical}} reasons. Legitimate reasons include pregnancy, childbirth, adoption, foster care placement, and care for an ill family member. However, this legislation is limited: coverage is only extended for twelve weeks and for employees who have worked for at least twelve months at the same job. Short-term medical illness and routine medical checkups were not covered until the FMLA, and family members other than parents, spouses, and children are not covered. Some states have extended the definition of family on their own, and therefore extended the coverage of FMLA.|$|E
500|$|The Baird {{nomination}} was emblematic of other difficulties Clinton had {{during the transition}} period and his early days in office, including most prominently the dropping of a promised middle-class tax cut and resistance to his proposal to allow gays in the military. [...] Stephanopoulos later wrote that [...] "We should have never let the Baird nomination get {{as far as it}} did, but our systems failed us at every crucial step." [...] And the timing of the announcement of the Wood withdrawal detracted attention from the signing of <b>the</b> <b>Family</b> <b>and</b> <b>Medical</b> Leave Act of 1993, the first legislative achievement of the Clinton administration. While a Gallup Poll showed that only 22percent of the public said that Clinton's difficulties in naming someone for Attorney General decreased their confidence in his ability to lead the country, overall, Clinton experienced the highest disapproval ratings at the start of any presidency since such polling began. [...] His [...] "presidential honeymoon" [...] period was thus extremely brief.|$|E
