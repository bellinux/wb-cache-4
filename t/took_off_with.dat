5|$|At 03:49 on {{the morning}} of August 9, 1945, Bockscar, flown by Sweeney's crew, carried Fat Man, with Kokura as the primary target and Nagasaki the {{secondary}} target. The mission plan for the second attack was nearly identical to that of the Hiroshima mission, with two B-29s flying an hour ahead as weather scouts and two additional B-29s in Sweeney's flight for instrumentation and photographic support of the mission. Sweeney <b>took</b> <b>off</b> <b>with</b> his weapon already armed but with the electrical safety plugs still engaged.|$|E

Two F-106 fighter aircraft scrambled from nearby McChord Air Force Base followed behind the airliner, one above it and one below, out of Cooper's view. A Lockheed T-33 trainer, diverted from an unrelated Air National Guard mission, also shadowed the 727 before running low on fuel and turning back near the Oregon–California state line.|$|E

Pipelines and {{refineries}} were built throughout much of Southeast Texas, leading to substantial industrialization, particularly around Houston and the Galveston Bay. The first offshore oilfield in the state opened in 1917 at Black Duck Bay on the Goose Creek field, although serious offshore exploration did not begin until the 1930s.|$|E

5|$|In June 1998 {{the brother}} of the Sultan of Brunei, Prince Jefri Bolkiah, was sued by his former {{business}} partners in a case that was settled out of court. During the case the Manoukians claimed that Prince Jefri kept 40 prostitutes at a time at the Dorchester. In 1999, the hotel hosted the first ever Pride of Britain Awards. In March 2002, a robbery took place {{in the lobby of the}} hotel when thieves wearing ski masks smashed the jewellery cabinets with a sledgehammer and <b>took</b> <b>off</b> <b>with</b> jewels. The Dorchester celebrated its 80th anniversary in 2011. To mark the event, the charity 'Trees for Cities' planted eighty 'future great trees' around the capital.|$|E
5|$|On 15 April 1941, Galland <b>took</b> <b>off</b> <b>with</b> {{lobster and}} {{champagne}} to celebrate General Theo Osterkamp's birthday at Le Touquet, France. He made a detour with his wingman towards England, looking for RAF aircraft. Off the cliffs of Dover, {{he spotted a}} group of Spitfires. Galland attacked and claimed two confirmed and one unconfirmed shot down. The actual result was the destruction of one Spitfire; {{the other two were}} damaged in force landings with both pilots wounded. During the combat, Galland's undercarriage had dropped causing one of the RAF pilots (Flight Lieutenant Paddy Finucane) to claim Galland's aircraft as destroyed, but Galland landed without incident at Le Touquet and presented Osterkamp with his gifts. Galland's success that day represented his 60th and 61st aerial victory.|$|E
5|$|On 15 July 1942, Finucane <b>took</b> <b>off</b> <b>with</b> {{his flight}} for a mission over France. His Spitfire was damaged by ground-fire. Finucane {{attempted}} to {{fly back to}} England across the English Channel but was forced to ditch into the sea and subsequently vanished. After his death, Finucane's brother Raymond served in No. 101 Squadron RAF and survived the war. Brendan's nephew was the Northern Ireland solicitor Pat Finucane, who during The Troubles, defended both sides in legal cases, winning human rights actions brought action the British government, he would be murdered by Loyalist paramilitaries acting in collusion with the British government intelligence service MI5 in 1989.|$|E

5|$|At 08:00, two {{formations}} 18 Bf 109s of I and III./JG 77, led by Major Siegfried Freytag, <b>took</b> <b>off</b> <b>with</b> their pathfinders. At {{the same}} time 23 Bf 109s of II./JG 77 took off. Around the Bocholt area they formed up {{with the other two}} Gruppen. Heading south and still north of Antwerp, JG 77 passed Woensdrecht airfield. It was home to No. 132 Wing RAF and its five Spitfire squadrons; No. 331 Squadron RAF, No. 332 Squadron RAF (Norwegian), No. 66 Squadron RAF and No. 127 Squadron RAF, and No. 322 Squadron RAF (Dutch). Some pilots from II./JG 77 either mistakenly believed it to be Antwerp, or thought the opportunity was too good to pass up. Two German fighters were claimed shot down, and one pilot captured. However, none of the JG 77 casualties fit this description.|$|E
5|$|On 13 March 1943, in {{preparation}} for the Battle of Kursk, Hitler visited the Eastern Front at Smolensk. Originally the plan was for certain officers to shoot Hitler collectively at a signal given in the officers' mess during lunch. However, that plan was cast aside. Instead a second plan devised by General Henning von Tresckow's Nazi resistance group was carried out. Upon leaving, staff officer Heinz Brandt, who was traveling in Hitler's entourage, agreed to take a box containing two bottles of cognac to Colonel Helmuth Stieff who was stationed at Hitler's headquarters. The package was given to Brandt by Tresckow. The cognac bottles were actually a bomb placed into a casing, with a timer fuse. The plane <b>took</b> <b>off</b> <b>with</b> both Hitler and Brandt on board, but it arrived safely at the Wolf's Lair field headquarters in East Prussia. The bomb most likely failed to detonate because the extremely low temperatures in the unheated luggage compartment of the plane prevented the fuse from operating properly.|$|E
5|$|Owing to his keen {{interest}} in the type he followed, with interest, the exploits of Kommando Nowotny, the all jet fighter unit. Although it had low serviceability rates, its aircraft achieved considerable success. To see how new aircraft performed in action, Galland often visited the front line airfields close {{to the scene of}} the fighting. On 8 November 1944, he was present when ace Walter Nowotny <b>took</b> <b>off</b> <b>with</b> a force of Me 262s in an overcast to engage a USAAF raid. Galland listened to it over the radio waves. Nowotny claimed a bomber but his Me 262 was damaged. He was then jumped by USAAF fighters and crashed close to the airfield. Galland heard the firing but did not see the event. It did not dissuade him from believing in the capabilities of the aircraft as a fighter.|$|E

5|$|The royal army under Devon and Pembroke intercepted the {{northern}} rebelson their way south {{to meet up}} with Warwick and Clarenceby Banbury in Oxfordshire. It is not clear what happened after this. According to Warkworth, Devon and Pembroke quarrelled over billeting arrangements, and Devon <b>took</b> <b>off</b> <b>with</b> the majority of the archers. The next day, on 26 July 1469, Pembroke met the rebels at the Battle of Edgecote, but without artillery support he was thoroughly defeated. When Devon finally arrived, he was either unable to engage his troops, or too late to make a difference. The French chronicler Jean de Waurin, however, gives a different account. According to Waurin, Devon left the field of battle once he heard news that Clarence was arriving with reinforcements. In either case, Pembroke was captured and executed on Warwick's order. Devon managed to escape, but was later captured by a mob at Bridgwater in Somerset, and executed on 17 August.|$|E
5|$|Lieutenant Commander Eugene Esmonde, {{acting as}} Squadron Leader, No. 825 Squadron FAA <b>took</b> <b>off</b> <b>with</b> his Fairey Swordfish {{formation}} at 12:25 {{to attack the}} ships. No. 411 and 64 Squadron were to escort the FAA but arrived over Manston 15 minutes late and missed the rendezvous. The only unit to keep to mission orders was Squadron Leader Brian Kingcome's No. 72 Squadron. Unaware of the Swordfish squadron's location, they ran into each other by fortunate accident. Owing to low cloud cover, they dropped to between 50 and 100 feet. The heavy German fighter cover {{put an end to}} the protection the Spitfire's could provide as the RAF fighters now had to look after themselves. The Spitfires and Swordfish were engaged by Fw 190s of 8 staffel and 9 staffel./JG 26 led by Gruppenkommandeur (Group Commander) Gerhard Schöpfel of III./JG 26. The Fw 190s were just relieving fighters of JG 2. Frail and slow, the Swordfish forced German pilots to lower their undercarriages to prevent overshooting the biplanes. In the event all six Swordfish were shot down. The Spitfires destroyed three Fw 190s in return. Several Swordfish managed to fire off their torpedoes but none found their mark. Lieutenant Commander Esmonde was shot down and killed by an Fw 190. He was awarded the Victoria Cross. Only five of the original eighteen Swordfish crew survived. No. 41 Squadron RAF claimed three Bf 109s (most likely from JG 1) destroyed and one damaged off the Belgian coast. No. 72 Squadron claimed three Fw 190s destroyed and four damaged in the battles around 13:00. No. 410 Squadron claimed two Bf 109s destroyed and two damaged in the same dogfights. The German ships consumed very little ammunition, as the action had been carried out largely by the Luftwaffe.|$|E
5|$|On 6 August 2007, Sunderland celebrated 10 {{years at}} the Stadium of Light with a draw against Juventus, and {{prepared}} for the oncoming season by spending nearly £40million on new players for the squad, whilst also breaking the British transfer record for a goalkeeper with the £9million transfer of Craig Gordon. Sunderland's season <b>took</b> <b>off</b> <b>with</b> a victory at home against Tottenham, as Michael Chopra scored in the last minute. After a derby victory over Middlesbrough, and with teams below failing to win, Sunderland secured their Premier League status for the 2008–09 season. On 25 October 2008, Sunderland defeated rivals Newcastle United 2–1 at the Stadium of Light, their first home win over them since 1980, {{and the first time}} they had ever defeated them at that ground. on 4 December 2008, Keane left Sunderland after a run of defeats in the Premier League. First-team coach Ricky Sbragia took over as caretaker manager, and on 27 December 2008 Sbragia took the job on a permanent basis, signing an 18-month contract. Despite promising early results, the team continued to struggle and narrowly avoided relegation from the Premiership {{on the last day of}} the season, after which Sbragia resigned from his post.|$|E

5|$|On {{the morning}} of 9 August 1945, a second B-29 (Bockscar), piloted by the 393d Bombardment Squadron's commander, Major Charles W. Sweeney, lifted off with Fat Man on board. This time, Ashworth served as weaponeer and Kokura was the primary target. Sweeney <b>took</b> <b>off</b> <b>with</b> the weapon already armed but with the {{electrical}} safety plugs still engaged. When they reached Kokura, they found cloud cover had obscured the city, prohibiting the visual attack required by orders. After three runs over the city, and with fuel running low, they headed for the secondary target, Nagasaki. Ashworth decided that a radar approach would be used if the target was obscured, but a last-minute break in the clouds over Nagasaki allowed a visual approach as ordered. The Fat Man was dropped over the city's industrial valley midway between the Mitsubishi Steel and Arms Works {{in the south and}} the Mitsubishi-Urakami Ordnance Works in the north. The resulting explosion had a blast yield equivalent to 21 kilotons of TNT, roughly the same as the Trinity blast, but was confined to the Urakami Valley, and a major portion of the city was protected by the intervening hills, resulting in the destruction of about 44% of the city. The bombing also crippled the city's industrial production extensively and killed 23,200–28,200 Japanese industrial workers and 150 Japanese soldiers. Overall, an estimated 35,000–40,000 people were killed and 60,000 injured.|$|E

The following day, she increased the altitude by a further 261m, reaching 8,399m (27,556ft), setting the new altitude world record with an autogyro. She improved by 350m (+4.3%) the preceding record established by Andrew Keech in 2004.|$|E
