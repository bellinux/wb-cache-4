They are so {{respected}} in their cultures that they occasionally hold funerals for beached whales, a <b>throwback</b> <b>to</b> Vietnam's ancient sea-based Austro-Asiatic culture. The god of the seas, according to Chinese folklore, was a large whale with human limbs.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, DiCaprio {{starred in}} Body of Lies, a spy film {{based on the}} novel of the same name by David Ignatius, set in context of the Middle East and the War on Terror, telling the story of three men battling a {{terrorist}} organization, and each other. Directed by Ridley Scott, DiCaprio dyed his hair brown and wore brown contacts for the role, which he chose to pursue because he considered it a <b>throwback</b> <b>to</b> political films of the 1970s such as The Parallax View (1974) and Three Days of the Condor (1975). The film received mixed reviews from critics, and at a budget of US$67.5 million, became a moderate box office success, grossing US$115 million worldwide.|$|E
5|$|Writer and series creator Chris Carter {{decided that}} {{rather than trying to}} present a typical Bigfoot-like creature, he would present the Jersey Devil as a missing link. Carter was {{inspired}} to write the episode by an essay by E. O. Wilson regarding ants and a story he wrote that posed whether mankind was hellbent on its own extinction. The concept of mankind being carnivores and eating its own tail evolved into the idea of using an evolutionary mutation that was a <b>throwback</b> <b>to</b> the Neanderthal. A Greg Cannom werewolf outfit from a previous project was used for the costume of the creature.|$|E
5000|$|In an April 2008 interview, Martin {{said of her}} aesthetic, [...] "I {{like really}} {{feminine}} silhouettes and form-fitting <b>throwbacks</b> <b>to,</b> like, the vintage pinup girls, but I like raw edges..." ...|$|R
2500|$|The TimeSplitters {{series is}} often {{compared}} to GoldenEye 007 {{because of its}} many <b>throwbacks</b> <b>to</b> that game and similar developers. [...] For example, both TimeSplitters 2 and GoldenEye start off on a Siberian dam.|$|R
5000|$|Following the monologue, {{the main}} {{segments}} are {{a mix of}} interviews and performances—examples of the latter include musical impressions, lip-syncing contests, games of Pictionary and egg Russian roulette.

5|$|Forgoing the {{downloadable}} content {{model used}} in previous Guitar Hero games, Guitar Hero Live adds songs {{to the game}} via Guitar Hero TV (GHTV), an online game mode offered free of charge in Guitar Hero Live. Instead of playing the immersive first-person view that the main career mode presents, songs on GHTV are played over the music video or footage of the band playing at a concert. Songs on GHTV are normally offered in a curated rotation, similar to a music video channel, allowing the player to drop in and out, but the player can use collected in-game rewards or use microtransactions to play any available song outside of this rotation. FreeStyleGames found that this approach, {{in contrast to the}} traditional downloadable content model, made it easier to secure licensing rights with artists to use their songs, as well as a <b>throwback</b> <b>to</b> the heyday of music video channels like MTV.|$|E
5|$|Rommel was {{an ambitious}} {{man who took}} {{advantage}} of his proximity to Hitler and willingly accepted the propaganda campaigns designed for him by Goebbels. He sought {{to level the playing}} field for non-nobles, and also supported militarism and a strong German Empire, while treating people only according to their merits. He did not display hatred to people of noble descent, and in fact was a <b>throwback</b> <b>to</b> the medieval knight in his personal traits, appearing well-versed in the ancient customs of chivalry, which helped to attract admiration from the British who saw in him a romantic archetype. Rommel classed himself as a traditionalist regarding military ethics and a modernist regarding warfare techniques. Certain authors remark that he also sought military glory and personal recognition, most of all from Hitler on whom, according to Watson, Rommel projected his idea of the German people's will.|$|E
5|$|Zappas was notably {{inspired}} by Panagiotis Soutsos and resolved to revive this ancient tradition {{through his own}} efforts and resources. In early 1856, he sent a letter through diplomatic channels to King Otto of Greece, offering to fund {{the revival of the}} Olympic Games, and to provide cash prizes to the victors. However, this initiative was not without opposition. There was wide belief among some Greek politicians that athletic games were a <b>throwback</b> <b>to</b> ancient times, unsuited to the modern era. Alexandros Rizos Rangavis, the Greek foreign minister and head of the conservative anti-athletics lobby in Athens, suggested an industrial and agricultural exposition instead of an athletics event. For months there was no official answer from the Greek state. In July 1856, an article in the Greek press by Panagiotis Soutsos made Zappas's proposal widely known to the public and triggered a series of events. King Otto agreed to the organization of athletics competitions at four-year intervals, with Zappa's full sponsorship, to coincide with industrial and agricultural expositions. As a result, Zappas provided the Greek government with the necessary financial resources to establish an Olympic Trust Fund.|$|E
5000|$|Myrddraal are Trolloc offspring, but are <b>throwbacks</b> <b>to</b> human origin (<b>throwbacks</b> <b>to</b> {{the animal}} {{side of their}} genetic {{heritage}} never survive). They are tall and pale, muscular and serpent-quick, {{but they have no}} eyes, which does not impair their vision in the slightest. Despite having no eyes they are said to have the vision of eagles in both light and darkness. Myrddraal are most often seen leading groups ("fists") of Trollocs, and sometimes [...] "link" [...] with them to achieve even greater control. However, this comes at a cost—dealing a Myrddraal a killing blow will instantly kill any Trollocs linked to it, even though the Myrddraal itself will not die [...] "until the setting sun".|$|R

25|$|The Holocaust was {{not simply}} a <b>throwback</b> <b>to</b> medieval torture or archaic barbarism, but a {{thoroughly}} modern expression of bureaucratic organization, industrial management, scientific achievement, and technological sophistication. The entire apparatus of the German bureaucracy was marshaled {{in the service of the}} extermination process.|$|E
25|$|The Funstar (stylised as FUNStar) is a pick-up {{concept car}} {{based on the}} Mk3 Fabia.

25|$|Shindo's 1974 film My Way was a <b>throwback</b> <b>to</b> {{films of}} his early career and was an {{exposure}} of the Japanese government's mistreatment of the country's migratory workers.

25|$|The given name(s) {{normally}} {{comes before}} the surname. However, in {{a list of}} people sorted alphabetically by surname, the surname usually comes first. Hence some people may also use this order in spoken language (e.g. introducing themselves as Kowalski Jan instead of Jan Kowalski), but this is generally considered incorrect or a <b>throwback</b> <b>to</b> the Communist era when this order was sometimes heard in official situations. In many formal situations, the given name is omitted altogether.|$|E
50|$|The song is {{a tribute}} to dancing to old rock 'n' roll heard on the radio. Befitting the subject matter, the song itself is written in an old-fashioned style, with a memorable {{saxophone}} melody starting the song.

50|$|The genre {{experienced}} a mainstream revival in the 1990s {{with the success}} of Scream, which both mocked and paid homage to traditional slasher conventions. Slasher films often prove popular and spawn sequels, prequels and remakes that continue to the present day. Adam Green's Hatchet and Ryan Nicholson's Gutterballs bill themselves as <b>throwbacks</b> <b>to</b> the slasher films of the 1980s.|$|R
50|$|The {{appearance}} of oddly-colored Kees in otherwise wolf-gray litters has caused {{research into the}} early history of Keeshond coat colors. Because of this, some breeders wonder whether the Keeshond should be bred for colors other than grey. There are many bloodlines carrying the colored gene, and rather than examples of mixed breeding, colors are legitimate <b>throwbacks</b> <b>to</b> an earlier era of the breed.|$|R
25|$|In {{response}} to the punk fashion of the mid-late 1970s, there was a <b>throwback</b> <b>to</b> the late 1950s Ivy League style.

Popular preppy clothing for men included Oxford shirts, sweaters, turtlenecks, polo shirts with popped collars, khaki slacks, argyle socks, dress pants, Hush Puppies Oxford shoes, brogues, suspenders, seersucker or striped linen suits, corduroy, and cable knit sweaters that were often worn tied around the shoulders.|$|E

In a <b>throwback</b> <b>to</b> the ongoing theme of the original shorts, the character is ultimately killed due to human error.|$|E

25|$|Traditionally, the soundboards of both {{northern}} and Italian virginals were pierced with a rose, sometimes {{two or three}} in early days. The rose had no acoustic function, and was purely decorative. Although these were a <b>throwback</b> <b>to</b> the rose in the medieval lute, they were never carved integrally {{as part of the}} soundboard. In Italian instruments they were usually constructed by combining multiple layers of pierced parchment, so that the final result looked like a gothic rose window, or an inverted wedding cake. In Flemish instruments, the rose was usually cast from lead and gilded, and usually incorporated the maker's initials.|$|E
