50|$|Operating out of {{bases in}} Tajikistan and Taliban-controlled areas of {{northern}} Afghanistan, <b>the</b> <b>IMU</b> launched {{a series of}} raids into southern Kyrgyzstan in 1999 and 2000. <b>The</b> <b>IMU</b> suffered heavy casualties in 2001-2002 during the American-led invasion of Afghanistan. Namangani was killed, while Yuldeshev and many of <b>the</b> <b>IMU's</b> remaining fighters escaped with remnants of the Taliban to Waziristan, in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas of Pakistan. Since then, <b>the</b> <b>IMU</b> has focused on fighting Pakistani forces in the Tribal Areas, and NATO and Afghan forces in northern Afghanistan.|$|R
50|$|It is {{estimated}} in 2000 that <b>the</b> <b>IMU</b> was approximately 2000 strong, {{and in the}} spring they contributed around 600 fighters to the Taliban's offensive against Massoud, participating in the successful siege of Taloqan, where they fought alongside Bin Laden's 055 Brigade. <b>The</b> <b>IMU</b> also provided <b>the</b> Taliban with a useful degree of deniability - under pressure from China to expel Uighur militants the Taliban simply sent them north to <b>the</b> <b>IMU's</b> camps.|$|R
50|$|In August 2000 <b>the</b> <b>IMU</b> also kidnapped four U.S. mountain-climbers in the Kara-Su Valley of Kyrgyzstan, {{holding them}} hostage until they escaped on 12 August. In response, the United States {{classified}} <b>the</b> <b>IMU</b> as a Foreign Terrorist Organization.|$|R
5000|$|These militant groups, {{which the}} {{international}} community often deem as terrorist groups, use drugs to finance their campaigns. As Abdurahim Kakharov, a deputy interior minister of Tajikistan said in 2000 [...] "terrorism, organized crime and the illegal drug trade are one interrelated problem.” The Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU), classified as a terrorist organization by the Clinton administration in 2000, is deeply involved with drug trafficking. Although <b>the</b> <b>IMU,</b> whose power was at its peak in the late 1990s, claimed {{to fight against the}} region’s civil government {{in the name of the}} caliphate, it also appeared to be highly motivated by the drug trade. <b>The</b> <b>IMU</b> had alliances with the Taliban government and al-Qaeda in Afghanistan along with members of Tajik government from fighting together in the Tajik civil war. This allowed <b>the</b> <b>IMU</b> to easily transport drugs from Afghanistan and Tajikistan. Before the U.S military dismantled it in 2001, <b>the</b> <b>IMU</b> frequently made small incursions in Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan around August, after the harvest of heroin. Arguably, <b>the</b> <b>IMU</b> used incursions to create instability in the states and distract law enforcement to more easily transport the new heroin harvests. The UNODC estimates that <b>the</b> <b>IMU</b> brought in 60 percent of the heroin traffic in <b>the</b> region. <b>The</b> <b>IMU’s</b> deep involvement in the drug trade indicates that it may have focused more on criminal activities than political and religious aims.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>IMU</b> {{is alleged}} by the {{magazine}} Eurasia Critic {{to be involved}} in organized criminal activities such as controlling and facilitating drug smuggling. <b>The</b> <b>IMU</b> is alleged by the United States of America to receive funding from the Taliban and Al-Qaeda.|$|R
30|$|The {{footstep}} length {{may also}} be estimated from <b>the</b> <b>IMU</b> data.

If <b>the</b> <b>IMU</b> is handheld, this method cannot be used, but the footstep length can be inferred from <b>the</b> <b>IMU</b> data also by other methods, see for example [6, 7]. A PDR system can greatly improve the positioning locally as the position estimate may be updated at every footstep, but because the errors accumulate over time, PDR is often combined with other sensors that can, at least occasionally, provide absolute position information.|$|R

It is unknown if <b>the</b> <b>IMU</b> directly worked with the Taliban or had any ties to them, given that the Taliban were ethnic Pashtuns who were pitted against the non-Pashtun ethnicities of Afghanistan. In 2001 <b>the</b> <b>IMU</b> was largely destroyed while fighting alongside the Taliban against the United States-led coalition forces in Afghanistan. An unknown number of their fighters escaped with remnants of the Taliban to Waziristan in Pakistan where they created a follow-up organization. <b>The</b> <b>IMU's</b> longterm leader Tahir Yuldashev was killed {{as a result of}} an August 27, 2009, U.S. predator airstrike in South Waziristan.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (<b>IMU),</b> one of <b>the</b> three key Islamic groups active in Central Asia. <b>The</b> <b>IMU</b> is a militant and extremist Islamic organization, {{one that has}} been listed by the US State Department as a terrorist organization. It has been linked to terrorist activity and to the attempted overthrow of Uzbek President Islam Karimov. This paper discusses the roots and causes of Islamic radicalism in general; clarifies the terms "Salafism" and "Wahhabism"; and examines violence as culture. In discussing the emergence of radical Islam (Islamism) in Uzbekistan, the author covers Salafism in Central Asia; the early Salafi ideologists; specific teachers and their disciples; and Uzbek militants abroad, in such places as Tajikistan, Afghanistan, and Pakistan. In describing the rise of <b>the</b> <b>IMU,</b> <b>the</b> paper presents <b>the</b> <b>IMU's</b> early activities; <b>the</b> February 1999 terrorist bombings in Tashkent; terrorist networks in Central Asia; the conviction {{of the leaders of the}} Erk political party for terrorist acts; and regional and clan rivalries. In discussing trans-border violence, the paper covers the fighting in Tajikistan in 1999; the hostage taking in Kyrgyzstan in 1999; and <b>the</b> <b>IMU's</b> adventures in Tajikistan and Afghanistan in 1999 - 2000. The author goes on to discuss the ideology of <b>the</b> <b>IMU,</b> first reviewing <b>the</b> roots of radical Islamic organizations in the Ferghana Valley and then examining "Lessons of Jihad," which is reportedly a document of <b>the</b> <b>IMU</b> that discusses <b>the</b> stages and objectives of jihad. The author then discusses <b>the</b> <b>IMU</b> after September 11, 2001, including its possible connections to the Taliban and to the Al Qaeda network. This analysis of <b>the</b> <b>IMU</b> concludes with a number of empirical and theoretical insights into the nature of organized extremism in Central Asia: that Islamic militancy is likely to persist in Central Asia; how no single theory is satisfactory to explain the phenomenon; how external factors play a role in Islamist mobilization in the region; how organized crime and political extremism are essential components for these groups; how Uzbek President Karimov's repression of ordinary Muslims is counterproductive in the struggle against Islamists; and finally, that printed materials are not of primary importance in the recruitment of members of supporters...|$|R
50|$|Many of <b>the</b> {{retreating}} <b>IMU</b> {{members were}} sheltered {{by the local}} militant commander Baitullah Mehsud, and when Mehsud turned against the Pakistani state and formed the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) in 2007, <b>the</b> <b>IMU</b> cooperated closely with him. The alliance {{between the two groups}} continued after Hakimullah Mehsud succeeded Baitullah as TTP leader in 2009, <b>the</b> <b>IMU</b> and <b>the</b> Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan carried out joint attacks on the Pakistani State and eventually formed a combined unit called Ansar al-Aseer, with the goal of freeing militant Islamist prisoners held in Pakistani prisons. Close ties were also formed with the militant Haqqani Network following the August 2009 killing of Yuldashev in a US drone strike, as <b>the</b> <b>IMU's</b> new leadership relocated the group to the Haqqani strongholds of Mir Ali and Miranshah in North Waziristan.|$|R

40|$|Re-defining <b>the</b> <b>IMU</b> <b>The</b> Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan is {{considered}} by governments around the world – most notably the United States – to be a terrorist organization associated with al-Qaeda.
