50|$|In {{the second}} version, the {{analogue}} of the bucket is a queue {{in the flow}} of traffic. This queue is used to directly control that flow: Packets are entered into the queue as they arrive, equivalent to the water being added to the bucket. These packets are then removed from the queue (first come, first served), usually at a fixed rate, e.g. for onward <b>transmission,</b> <b>equivalent</b> to water leaking from the bucket. As a result, {{the rate at which the}} queue is serviced directly controls the onward transmission rate of the traffic. Thus it imposes conformance rather than checking it, and where the queue is serviced at a fixed rate (and where the packets are all the same length), the resulting traffic stream is necessarily devoid of burstiness or jitter. So in this version, the traffic itself is the analogue of the water passing through the bucket. It is not clear how this version of applying the analogy might be used to the check the rates of discrete events. This version is referred to here as the leaky bucket as a queue.|$|E
5000|$|The {{description}} {{in terms of}} the continuous state leaky bucket algorithm is given by the ITU-T as follows: “The virtual scheduling algorithm updates a Theoretical Arrival Time (TAT), which is the 'nominal' arrival time of the cell assuming cells are sent equally spaced at an emission interval of T corresponding to the cell rate Λ 1/T when the source is active. If the actual arrival time of a cell is not 'too early' relative to the TAT and tolerance τ associated to the cell rate, i.e. if the actual arrival time is after its theoretical arrive time minus the limit value (ta > TAT - τ), then the cell is conforming; otherwise, the cell is nonconforming" [...] If the cell is nonconforming then TAT is left unchanged. If the cell is conforming, and arrived before its TAT (equivalent to the bucket not being empty but being less than the limit value), then the next cell's TAT is simply TAT + T. However, if a cell arrives after its TAT, then the TAT for the next cell is calculated from this cell's arrival time, not its TAT. This prevents credit building up when there is a gap in the <b>transmission</b> (<b>equivalent</b> to the bucket becoming less than empty).|$|E

40|$|Meta-foils are {{all-metal}} free-standing electromagnetic metamaterials {{based on}} interconnected S-string architecture. They provide a versatile applications' platform. Lacking any substrate or embedding matrix, they feature arrays of parallel upright S-strings with each string longitudinally shifted by half an S compared to its neighbour to form capacitance-inductance loops. Geometric parameters include length a, width b, thickness t, and height h of an S, {{the gap between}} adjacent S-strings d, and the periodicity p of the interconnecting lines. Equidistant strings at p= 1 form a 1 SE meta-foil. Grouped in pairs of gap d, exhibiting a gap dp between pairs, they are named 2 SP. Geometric parameters a, b, t, h, d, dp, pS(E or P) and materials' properties like electric conductivity, Young's modulus, thermal expansion coefficient, and heat capacity determine the electromagnetic, mechanical, and thermal properties of meta-foils including the spectral dependence of resonance frequencies, refractive index, transmission, reflection, and bending. We show how the frequency and transmission of left-handed pass-bands depend on a, p, and dp, the pSP geometry exhibiting higher resonance frequency and <b>transmission.</b> <b>Equivalent</b> circuit considerations serve to explain physical reasons.

40|$|In this paper, we {{show how}} light {{absorption}} in a plasmonic grating nanosurface {{can be calculated}} {{by means of a}} simple, analytical model based on a <b>transmission</b> line <b>equivalent</b> circuit. The nanosurface is a one-dimensional grating etched into a silver metal film covered by a silicon slab. The transmission line model is specified for both transverse electric and transverse magnetic polarizations of the incident light, and it incorporates the effect of the plasmonic modes diffracted by the ridges of the grating. Under the assumption that the adjacent ridges are weakly interacting in terms of diffracted waves, we show that the approximate, closed form expression for the reflection coefficient at the air-silicon interface can be used to evaluate light absorption of the solar cell. The weak-coupling assumption is valid if the grating structure is not closely packed and the excitation direction is close to normal incidence. Also, we show the utility of the circuit theory for understanding how the peaks in the absorption coefficient are related to the resonances of the <b>equivalent</b> <b>transmission</b> model and how this can help in designing more efficient structures...|$|R
