40|$|Psalm {{studies at}} the end of the twentieth century bear witness of a major {{paradigm}} shift. Recent research no longer treats the Book of Psalms as a loosely assembled hymnbook with no overarching organization, but rather as a book that got its present shape through careful editing. In recent years an increasing interest in the arrangement of the Book of Psalms has produced a substantial volume of literature, and there is a remarkable consensus that the purposeful arrangement of psalms within the final collection seems <b>to</b> <b>have</b> given <b>it</b> <b>both</b> a function and a message greater than the sum of its parts. One of the main strands of research has treated the Book of Psalms at a macro-structural level, paying attention to the large contours and overall theme(s) of the book, and although it is an intricate task, some significant progress has been made. One influential theory is that the Book of Psalms has a final wisdom frame, as well as a royal covenantal frame; discussion concerns how these two relate to each other. Even though much work has been done in defending either a wisdom theme or a royal/messianic theme, no one <b>has</b> yet attempted <b>to</b> evaluate these themes from a thematic approach. The aim of this study is hence to advance the discussion by looking at images of God conveyed by the psalms at a macro-structural level. Do the conveyed images of God correspond to either frame or does the Book of Psalms describe God differently...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper offers}} an {{explanation}} of the resilience of IS-LM models, which are still alive more than sixty years after the birth of the first prototype despite growing criticism within the profession. To this end two significant episodes of their evolution are examined in some detail: the genesis of the prototype of the 'first generation' of IS-LM models (Hicks 1937), and a recent example of what is here called the 'second generation' of IS-LM models (McCallum and Nelson 1997). The resilience of IS-LM models is mainly related to their adaptability to a changing perception of the economic environment within which they are applied.

40|$|Abstract Background HSP 90 {{proteins}} {{are essential}} molecular chaperones involved in signal transduction, cell cycle control, stress management, and folding, degradation, and transport of proteins. HSP 90 proteins {{have been found}} in a variety of organisms suggesting that they are ancient and conserved. In this study we investigate the nuclear genomes of 32 species across all kingdoms of organisms, and all sequences available in GenBank, and address the diversity, evolution, gene structure, conservation and nomenclature of the HSP 90 family of genes across all organisms. Results Twelve new genes and a new type HSP 90 C 2 were identified. The chromosomal location, exon splicing, and prediction of whether they are functional copies were documented, as well as the amino acid length and molecular mass of their polypeptides. The conserved regions across all protein sequences, and signature sequences in each subfamily were determined, and a standardized nomenclature system for this gene family is presented. The proeukaryote HSP 90 homologue, HTPG, exists in most Bacteria species but not in Archaea, and it evolved into three lineages (Groups A, B and C) via two gene duplication events. None of the organellar-localized HSP 90 s were derived from endosymbionts of early eukaryotes. Mitochondrial TRAP and endoplasmic reticulum HSP 90 B separately originated from the ancestors of HTPG Group A in Firmicutes-like organisms very early {{in the formation of the}} eukaryotic cell. TRAP is monophyletic and present in all Animalia and some Protista species, while HSP 90 B is paraphyletic and present in all eukaryotes with the exception of some Fungi species, which appear <b>to</b> <b>have</b> lost <b>it.</b> <b>Both</b> HSP 90 C (chloroplast HSP 90 C 1 and location-undetermined SP 90 C 2) and cytosolic HSP 90 A are monophyletic, and originated from HSP 90 B by independent gene duplications. HSP 90 C exists only in Plantae, and was duplicated into HSP 90 C 1 and HSP 90 C 2 isoforms in higher plants. HSP 90 A occurs across all eukaryotes, and duplicated into HSP 90 AA and HSP 90 AB in vertebrates. Diplomonadida was identified as the most basal organism in the eukaryote lineage. Conclusion The present study presents the first comparative genomic study and evolutionary analysis of the HSP 90 family of genes across all kingdoms of organisms. HSP 90 family members underwent multiple duplications and also subsequent losses during their evolution. This study established an overall framework of information for the family of genes, which may facilitate and stimulate the study of this gene family across all organisms. </p...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} politics of children’s music education in {{the first decades of}} the German Democratic Republic. The East German state famously attempted to co-opt music education for propagandistic purposes by mandating songs with patriotic texts. However, as I show, most pedagogues believed that these songs were worthless as political education: children, they argued, learned not through the logic of texts, but through the immediacy of their bodies and their emotions. These educators believed music to be an especially effective site for children’s political education, as music played to children’s strongest suit: their unconscious mind and their emotions. Many pedagogues, composers, and musicologists thus adapted Weimar-era methods that used mostly non-texted music to instill what they held to be socialist values of collectivism, diligence, open-mindedness, and critical thought. I trace the fates of four of these pedagogical practices—solfège, the Orff Schulwerk, lessons in listening, and newly-composed “Brechtian” children’s operas—demonstrating how educators sought to graft the new demands of the socialist society onto inherited German musical and pedagogical traditions. 	I argue that this marriage of old ideas and new aims was often fraught, as pedagogues and even state officials proved reluctant to interrogate fully the possible political uses of an art form which, in the Romantic tradition of Hoffmann and Hanslick, was held to be autonomous and stubbornly intractable to worldly purposes. Accordingly, music education in German socialism proceeded from a vision of aesthetic education that privileged the freedom of the individual—an ideal that proved loyal less to the beliefs of Soviet communism than to the fundamental ideologies of German liberalism. More generally, the dissertation shows how even the most fervently socialist didactic ideals and practices often broke down on the issue of music. Children’s music pedagogy represents, then, a moment in which developing human bodies and beliefs can be held up against the “real existing socialism” that the GDR claimed <b>to</b> <b>have</b> achieved: <b>it</b> exposes <b>both</b> the ideological underpinnings of German socialism and the halting practical steps that educators took to build it...|$|R

Theoretical considerations as revealed by literature indicate that the process is a complicated process. In this study, this is proven by the different types such as information theory which {{is concerned with the}} transmission aspects of communication process. The impact that information theory has had on the study of communication is analogous to the tremendous influence that quantitative techniques have had on management decision-making. Interpersonal communication emphasises transference of information from one person <b>to</b> another. <b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>both</b> verbal and non-verbal forms. In verbal communication there is direct contact between parties involved. In non-verbal communication body postures are used as a means of communication. Written communication involves transmitting information through written word. Business communication within organisations is also influenced by other factors related to the diversity of workforce. Intercultural communication covers a wide variety of attitudes, perceptions and values. Language also {{plays an important role in}} communication as illustrated by the communicative, explanatory, regulatory and interrogative functions. The differences between American and British English illustrate the complexity of the process. The situation is more complex in South African organisations as there are eleven official languages. Of these only English and Afrikaans are used in workplaces as business languages. The population census conducted in 1996 indicated that about 43 % of South Africans are functionally, illiterate and this number can be as high as 52 % amongst blacks. As a result the majority of South Africans have poor understanding of these languages as a result of historical problems. In this study business communication is studies in a South African organisation, Mintek, to establish the effectiveness of communication in that organisation. Questionnaires are used to test the opinions of the employees. The results are tabulated and interpreted. Relevant literature is brought in when discussing the results, recommendations are made aiming at improving communication within Mintek...|$|R
40|$|Bibliography: pages 79 - 84. This essay {{examines}} how the Cape government thought and felt about certain prominent Muslims, exiled from present day Indonesia to that colony, {{in the period}} 1652 <b>to</b> 1806. <b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>both</b> descriptive and analytic functions. Descriptively, it seeks {{to find out what}} these thoughts and feelings were. Analytically, it seeks to explain why they came about. The essay contends that {{the way in which the}} exiles were perceived can only be understood by locating them in the wider Cape social, economic and political context. Accordingly, it describes elements of this context such as the Dutch colonial rationale, the Cape social structure, its culture and pertinent legal practices. Against this background, it then describes these perceptions. The description is general and specific. It examines perceptions of exiles in general by a study of the social class to which they belonged, namely the free blacks. It particularly focuses on the demography, the legal status and the economic position of this class. The final chapter of the essay is ties empirical backbone, being a specific and detailed examination of what the Cape government thought and felt about prominent individual exiles. As far as possible, it elicits all the evidence concerning these exiles, pertinent to the topic at hand, that is available in the prevailing historical literature. This essay's central thesis is that the exiles were peripheral to the concerns of the Cape government. Perceptions of individual exiles were nuanced and encompassed various attitudes, but at the core the exiles were not seen as important to their vital interests. The class to which the exiles belonged, the free blacks, were always at the demographic, legal, and economic margins of Cape society. The essay contends that the reason the exiles were peripheral in government perceptions was because of the general marginality of Muslims in the Cape context. They lacked numbers, and their role as a religious constituency was undermined by a society that subsumed such a constituency under various other concerns. The thesis is a departure from other studies on Cape Muslim history which this essay contends, tend to emphasise the "differentness" and centrality of the Muslim contribution...|$|R

The purpose of this Bachelor thesis {{is to examine the}} participation of women in study circles in an industrial town. The research questions for my thesis are the following: 1. How did the participation of study circles look like in the industrial town of Deje between the years 1950 - 1970 ? 2. In which study circles did women participate in during the research period and how can it be understood in relation to the surrounding industrial town? My research includes qualitative studies of literature, protocols, attendance lists and documents concerning ABF’s work that´s archived in Archives centre in Karlstad. My research has also consisted of quantitative studies as interpretive methods have been used in the survey. I have been looking into ABF’s documentation concerning the activity in Deje to see which study circles the people in Deje participated in and compared them to how the choose what they studied. The theory that I have chosen for this thesis is Yvonne Hirdman´s theory about “Gender contract”. The subject I researched in changed a lot during these 20 years that was researched. During the 1950 s, the women was a minority when it came to study circles. Most people who studied consisted in majority of men and there was just a few women in some of the circles. The study circles changed during the 1960 s when women started to study more than earlier. It created more circles that there were only women in and men had since before a lot circles where it rarely appeared women in. This did not create more equal circles during these years, instead it created more study circles that were sex-segregated. It was also during the 1960 s more study circles that was related to work and especially to the paper and mass factory that was in Deje during this time.
