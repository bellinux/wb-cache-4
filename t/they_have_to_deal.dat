500|$|The New York Times {{film critic}} Bosley Crowther noted {{the film was}} a subtle satire on Beatlemania and the Beatles themselves. The Beatles are portrayed as likeable young lads who are {{constantly}} amazed at the attention they receive and who want {{nothing more than a}} little peace and quiet; however, <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> with screaming crowds, journalists who ask nonsensical questions, and authority figures who constantly look down upon them. In fact their biggest problem is McCartney's elderly, but [...] "clean" [...] grandfather, played by Wilfrid Brambell. The New Yorker critic Brendan Gill wrote: [...] "Though I don't pretend to understand what makes these four rather odd-looking boys so fascinating to so many scores of millions of people, I admit that I feel a certain mindless joy stealing over me as they caper about uttering sounds." ...|$|E

Although he was considered a [...] "progressive" [...] or a Moderate Republican within the legislature, Caldwell recalled years later that he really had [...] "no ideology, no issue when I first ran. I just thought a two-party system was a good idea. I don't recall any of us [...] having an agenda. ...

That's something that <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> with and they dealt with it and they did the best they can do with they system. This is just how it is.

[...] "Playing a perennial power like the University of Texas, December 27 in the Holiday Bowl, which, by the way, is wonderfully hosted by that committee. This is a great, step forward. This is exactly what we wanted to do. We are very pleased to be mentioned in the same breath as a program like Texas." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{having served}} his suspension, Rypien {{struggled}} {{to remain in}} the Canucks' line-up and was made a regular healthy scratch. In late-November 2010, the Canucks allowed him another personal leave of absence. At this time, it began to be widely speculated in the media that Rypien was suffering from mental health issues. While the Canucks organization withheld any details regarding Rypien's situation, general manager Mike Gillis stated publicly that [...] "when you come to know somebody and realize they're a really good person…You don't only support them when they're {{at the top of their}} game…you support them when they're not feeling good about things or have other issues <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> with." [...] On March 8, 2011, Rypien returned from his leave and was assigned to the Moose. The NHL waived the two-week limit allowed for a conditioning stint, allowing the Canucks to leave him with the Moose for the remainder of the season and avoid his salary cap hit. Rypien completed his final season as a Canuck with one assist over nine games, while also recording two assists in 11 AHL games. He also helped the Moose to the second round of the playoffs, recording one goal in seven post-season games, before they were eliminated by the Hamilton Bulldogs.|$|E
