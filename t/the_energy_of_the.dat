5|$|In {{physical}} systems, Noether's theorem {{provides an}} equivalence between conservation laws and symmetries of the system. However, for cellular automata this theorem {{does not directly}} apply, because instead of being governed by <b>the</b> <b>energy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> system {{the behavior of the}} automaton is encoded into its rules, and the automaton is guaranteed to obey certain symmetries (translation invariance in both space and time) regardless of any conservation laws it might obey. Nevertheless, the conserved quantities of certain reversible systems behave similarly to energy in some respects. For instance, if different regions of the automaton have different average values of some conserved quantity, the automaton's rules may cause this quantity to dissipate, so that the distribution of the quantity is more uniform in later states. Using these conserved quantities as a stand-in for <b>the</b> <b>energy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> system can allow it to be analyzed using methods from classical physics.|$|E
5|$|Similar to {{photoluminescence}} mapping, <b>the</b> <b>energy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> excitation {{light can}} be scanned in Raman measurements, thus producing Raman maps. Those maps also contain oval-shaped features uniquely identifying (n,m) indices. Contrary to PL, Raman mapping detects not only semiconducting but also metallic tubes, {{and it is}} less sensitive to nanotube bundling than PL. However, requirement of a tunable laser and a dedicated spectrometer is a strong technical impediment.|$|E
5|$|A {{study of}} short-finned pilot whales off the {{southwest}} coast of Tenerife in the Canary Islands {{has found the}} members of a pod maintained contact with each other through call repertoires unique to their pod. A later study found, when foraging at around 800 m deep, short-finned pilot whales make tonal calls. The number and length of the calls seem to decrease with depth despite being farther away from conspecifics at the surface. As such, the surrounding water pressure affects <b>the</b> <b>energy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> calls, but it does not appear to affect the frequency levels.|$|E
30|$|<b>The</b> {{comparative}} analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dielectric permittivity and conductivity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> direct current indicates that <b>the</b> activation <b>energy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> conductivity {{is higher than}} <b>the</b> activation <b>energy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> permittivity. Indeed, we obtain ΔEε[*]=[*] 3.23  meV (Fig.  5) for <b>the</b> activation <b>energy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dielectric permittivity and ΔEσ[*]=[*] 91.4  meV (Fig.  6) for <b>the</b> activation <b>energy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> low-frequency conductivity.|$|R
50|$|A {{reaction}} with {{a positive}} Q value is exothermic, i.e. has a net release <b>of</b> <b>energy,</b> since <b>the</b> kinetic <b>energy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> final state is greater than <b>the</b> kinetic <b>energy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> initial state.A reaction with a negative Q value is endothermic, i.e. requires a net <b>energy</b> input, since <b>the</b> kinetic <b>energy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> final state is less than <b>the</b> kinetic <b>energy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> initial state.|$|R
25|$|Thus <b>the</b> {{specific}} <b>energy</b> gain <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rocket in {{any small}} time interval is <b>the</b> <b>energy</b> gain <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rocket including the remaining fuel, divided by its mass, where <b>the</b> <b>energy</b> gain {{is equal to}} <b>the</b> <b>energy</b> produced by <b>the</b> fuel minus <b>the</b> <b>energy</b> gain <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reaction mass. The larger <b>the</b> speed <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rocket, <b>the</b> smaller <b>the</b> <b>energy</b> gain <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reaction mass; if the rocket speed is more than half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> exhaust speed the reaction mass even loses energy on being expelled, to <b>the</b> benefit <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>energy</b> gain <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rocket; the larger <b>the</b> speed <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rocket, <b>the</b> larger <b>the</b> <b>energy</b> loss <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reaction mass.|$|R
5|$|After {{graduating from}} Cornell, O'Neill {{accepted}} {{a position as}} an instructor at Princeton University. There he started his research into high-energy particle physics. In 1956, his second year of teaching, he published a two-page article that theorized that the particles produced by a particle accelerator could be stored {{for a few seconds}} in a storage ring. The stored particles could then be directed to collide with another particle beam. This would increase <b>the</b> <b>energy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> particle collision over the previous method, which directed the beam at a fixed target. His ideas were not immediately accepted by the physics community.|$|E
5|$|After {{several months}} of work, Fermi's group had {{tentatively}} determined that lighter elements would disperse <b>the</b> <b>energy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> captured neutron by emitting a proton or alpha particle and heavier elements would generally accomplish the same by emitting a gamma ray. This latter behavior would later result in the beta decay of a neutron into a proton, thus moving the resulting isotope one place up the periodic table. When Fermi's team bombarded uranium, they observed this behavior as well, which strongly suggested that the resulting isotope had an atomic number of 93. Fermi was initially reluctant to publicize such a claim, but after his team observed several unknown half-lives in the uranium bombardment products that did not match those of any known isotope, he published a paper entitled Possible Production of Elements of Atomic Number Higher than 92 in June 1934. In it he proposed the name ausonium (atomic symbol Ao) for element 93, after the Greek name Ausonia (Italy).|$|E
5|$|Before his death, Dr. Butterfly drains <b>the</b> <b>energy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{students}} at Kazuki's school to heal and revive Victor, a being superior to humans and homunculi. Victor is confronted by Kazuki, but Victor {{is not interested}} in fighting and leaves. During the battle, however, Kazuki's kakugane is revealed to be the same type as the Victor's—a black kakugane created by the Alchemist Army as a prototype to the philosopher's stone. The black kakugane absorbs human life forces; to prevent this from happening, Kazuki's death is ordered by the Alchemist Army. Captain Bravo tries to kill Kazuki, but Tokiko finds him alive. A team is commissioned to confirm Kazuki's death, but Kazuki, Tokiko and Gouta Nakamura (an Alchemist Warrior and former protégé of Tokiko's) fight their way past the members of the Re-Extermination Squad. Later, Kazuki's death is postponed because, as the Alchemists' leader explains, their top priority is to defeat Victor.|$|E

5|$|Cerium has a {{variable}} electronic structure. <b>The</b> <b>energy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 4f electron is {{nearly the same}} as that of the outer 5d and 6s electrons that are delocalized in the metallic state, and only a small amount of energy is required to change the relative occupancy of these electronic levels. This gives rise to dual valence states. For example, a volume change of about 10% occurs when cerium is subjected to high pressures or low temperatures. It appears that the valence changes from about 3 to 4 when it is cooled or compressed.|$|E

5|$|Despite his improvements, Alexios did {{not have}} enough {{manpower}} to recover the lost territories in Asia Minor. Having been impressed by the abilities of the Norman cavalry at Dyrrhachium, he sent ambassadors west to ask for reinforcements from Europe. This mission was deftly accomplished– at the Council of Piacenza in 1095, Pope Urban II was impressed by Alexios's appeal for help, which spoke of the suffering of the Christians of the east and hinted at a possible union of the eastern and western churches. Pope Urban was concerned with increasing restlessness of the martial nobility in Western Europe, who, currently deprived of major enemies, were causing chaos throughout the countryside. Alexios's appeal offered a means not only to redirect <b>the</b> <b>energy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> knights to benefit the Church, but also to consolidate the authority of the Pope over all Christendom and to gain the east for the See of Rome.|$|E
5|$|Electrons can {{transfer}} between different orbitals by the emission or absorption of photons with an energy {{that matches the}} difference in potential. Other methods of orbital transfer include collisions with particles, such as electrons, and the Auger effect. To escape the atom, <b>the</b> <b>energy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> electron must be increased above its binding energy to the atom. This occurs, for example, with the photoelectric effect, where an incident photon exceeding the atom's ionization energy is absorbed by the electron.|$|E
5|$|For TypeII supernovae, the {{collapse}} is eventually halted by short-range repulsive neutron-neutron interactions, {{mediated by the}} strong force, {{as well as by}} degeneracy pressure of neutrons, at a density comparable to that of an atomic nucleus. When {{the collapse}} stops, the infalling matter rebounds, producing a shock wave that propagates outward. The energy from this shock dissociates heavy elements within the core. This reduces <b>the</b> <b>energy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shock, which can stall the explosion within the outer core.|$|E

5|$|If a bound {{electron}} {{is in an}} excited state, an interacting photon with the proper energy can cause stimulated emission of a photon with a matching energy level. For this to occur, the electron must drop to a lower energy state that has an energy difference matching <b>the</b> <b>energy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> interacting photon. The emitted photon and the interacting photon then move off in parallel and with matching phases. That is, the wave patterns of the two photons are synchronized. This physical property is used to make lasers, which can emit a coherent beam of light energy in a narrow frequency band.|$|E
