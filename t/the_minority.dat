It was under this communal representation that Tamil national awareness changed to national consciousness—a less passive state. They formed a Tamil political party called the All Ceylon Tamil Congress (ACTC). In the years leading to Sri Lankan independence, political tension began to develop between the majority Sinhalese and minority Tamil communities as the ACTC, citing the possibility of the majority Sinhalese adopting a dominant posture, pushed for “fifty-fifty” representation in parliament. This policy would allot half the seats in parliament to the Sinhalese majority and half to <b>the</b> <b>minority</b> communities: Ceylon Tamils, Indian Tamils, Muslims and others.|$|E

More minority candidates are getting elected, but the votes of <b>the</b> <b>minorities</b> are getting split, and therefore there is no net gain to the {{two major parties}}. In fact, there is evidence to say that parties that are taking a more nationalistic approach are doing better than the parties that are projecting a more inclusive image. Appealing to <b>the</b> <b>minorities</b> has alien-ated <b>the</b> majority, Sinhalese, so the major parties are moving towards more radical extrem-ist nationalistic platforms.
