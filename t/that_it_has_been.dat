5|$|Warning calls {{given by}} birds {{such as the}} Eurasian jay are {{similarly}} honest signals, benefiting both predator and prey: the predator is informed <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> detected and might as well save time and energy by giving up the chase, while the prey is protected from attack.|$|E

5|$|Around {{the turn}} of the millennium, the Arabic {{astronomer}} and polymath Ibn al-Haytham (Alhacen) presented a development of Ptolemy's geocentric epicyclic models in terms of nested spheres. Despite the similarity of this concept to that of Ptolemy's Planetary Hypotheses, al-Haytham's presentation differs in sufficient detail <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> argued that it reflects an independent development of the concept. In chapters 15–16 of his Book of Optics, Ibn al-Haytham also said that the celestial spheres do not consist of solid matter.|$|E

Louis hears his mother's screams and climbs out of bed, but a dark, shadowy figure with red eyes corners him. Louis barely escapes through the dog door where he runs into Mulder, informing him of the creature's whereabouts in the house.|$|E

Balinor is then imprisoned by his insane brother Palance Buckhannah, who has taken control of Callahorn's rule. His advisor, Stenmin, has driven Palance insane with drugs, making him his pawn. With help from Menion, Balinor escapes and confronts both Palance and Stenmin. Practically cornered, Stenmin stabs Palance as a distraction and flees.|$|E
5|$|Body piercing, {{a form of}} body modification, is the {{practice}} of puncturing or cutting {{a part of the}} human body, creating an opening in which jewelry may be worn. The word piercing can refer to the act or practice of body piercing, or to an opening in the body created by this act or practice. Although the history of body piercing is obscured by popular misinformation and by a lack of scholarly reference, ample evidence exists to document <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> practiced in various forms by both sexes since ancient times throughout the world.|$|E

He praised her for spreading the message of Raëlism internationally while publicizing the cloning. In the Raëlian hierarchy, she is one level below Raël {{and serves as a}} spokesperson for the movement. As a leader, she has attempted to rehabilitate the swastika, one of the group's symbols. She maintains that it is valuable as an ancient symbol of peace, and <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> unfairly associated with Nazi Germany.|$|E
5|$|In {{recognition}} of his work successfully organising the Games Kent Hughes was made a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1957. An award presented by the Victorian Olympic Council to the athlete it considers to have given the most outstanding performance at a Games is named in his honour and Kent Hughes's significance to the modern Olympic movement is such <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> suggested that an oil portrait of Kent Hughes be commissioned {{and placed in the}} Olympic Museum in Lausanne.|$|E

5|$|Increased Sabbat {{activity}} {{coincides with}} {{the disappearance of the}} Malkavian chief, Alistair Grout. At Grout's mansion, the fledgling sees Nines leaving and discovers Grout's remains in the mansion with vampire hunter Grunfeld Bach, who denies involvement in Grout's death. Learning about Nines' presence at the mansion, LaCroix tells the other chiefs to approve Nines' execution. The fledgling is sent to the Museum of Natural History to recover the sarcophagus, but finds <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> stolen. Jack later suggests to the fledgling that LaCroix wants the sarcophagus to drink the blood of the ancient within, gaining its power.|$|E
5|$|Mammals signal by {{a variety}} of means. Many give visual anti-predator signals, as when deer and gazelle stot, {{honestly}} indicating their fit condition and their ability to escape, or when white-tailed deer and other prey mammals flag with conspicuous tail markings when alarmed, informing the predator <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> detected. Many mammals make use of scent-marking, sometimes possibly to help defend territory, but probably with a range of functions both within and between species. Microbats and toothed whales including oceanic dolphins vocalize both socially and in echolocation.|$|E
5|$|Scully {{discovers that}} two worms put {{together}} will kill each other. When the investigators place {{one of the}} worms into the infected dog, it recovers.

He and Mulder restrain the hysterical Da Silva and place the last worm inside her. When they are rescued, Da Silva is quarantined {{and the others are}} released. Although Mulder wants to return to the site, he is told <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> destroyed by the government.|$|E

The other three occasions, in 1882, 1946, and 1987, involved flurries but no accumulation.|$|E
5|$|The Ballroom, {{the last}} of the palace's three largest rooms, (illustrated below) was {{designed}} by Robillon in 1760. To create this oval room the architect combined five smaller rooms. The ormolu Rococo ornament takes the form of heavy gilding to the walls and ceiling, of such richness <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> compared with that of François de Cuvilliés' Amalienburg at Schloss Nymphenburg. The walls and doors are mirrored and the painted and gilded, coffered ceiling is supported by golden caryatids.|$|E
5|$|The {{excavated}} grave-goods of the Anglo-Saxon cemetery at Gipeswic, {{including those}} found in burials under small barrows, were not particularly wealthy or elaborate.

One exception was a furnished grave <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> suggested could have been that of a visitor from the Rhineland.|$|E

500|$|Runestone U 270 was {{discovered}} in Smedby (...) near Vallentuna and depicted by Johan Hadorph and assistant, for Johan Peringskiöld, during the national search for historic monuments in 1667–84. Richard Dybeck noted in 1867 {{that he had seen}} the runestone intact three years previously, but <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> used {{for the construction of a}} basement in 1866. Dybeck sued the guilty farmer, and the prosecution was completed by the Royal Swedish Academy of Letters, History and Antiquities. The documentation from the court case shows <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> standing at the homestead and <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> blown up three times into small pieces that could be used for the construction of the basement. Reconstruction of the runestone was deemed impossible. The stone was [...] tall and [...] wide, and it was raised in memory of a father who appears to have travelled to Greece.|$|R

Two New York Islanders and Detroit Red Wings have also won the award. Players from the seven different Canadian teams have won this trophy on 12 of the 28 occasions <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> awarded. Three members each from the Edmonton Oilers, and Calgary Flames, two members from the Vancouver Canucks, as well as one each from the Montreal Canadiens, Ottawa Senators, Toronto Maple Leafs, and the Winnipeg Jets have all won the award.|$|E
5|$|Gay men {{and lesbians}} came {{together}} to work in grassroots political organizations responding to organized resistance in 1977. A coalition of conservatives named Save Our Children staged a campaign to repeal a civil rights ordinance in Dade County, Florida. Save Our Children was successful enough to influence similar repeals in several American cities in 1978. However, the same year a campaign in California called the Briggs Initiative, designed to force the dismissal of homosexual public school employees, was defeated. Reaction {{to the influence of}} Save Our Children and the Briggs Initiative in the gay community was so significant <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> called the second Stonewall for many activists, marking their initiation into political participation.|$|E
5|$|In 1985, Canadian {{historian}} William H. McNeill gave {{a series}} of three lectures on polyethnicity in ancient and modern cultures at the University of Toronto. The main thesis throughout the lectures was the argument <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> the cultural norm for societies to be composed of different ethnic groups. McNeill argues that the ideal of homogeneous societies may have grown between 1750 and 1920 in Western Europe due to a growth in the belief in a single nationalistic base for the political organization of society. McNeill believes that World War I was the point in time when the desire for homogeneous nations began to weaken.|$|E
