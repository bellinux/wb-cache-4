5|$|The {{traditional}} focuses {{of sociology}} include social stratification, social class, social mobility, religion, secularization, law, sexuality and deviance.

5|$|In 2003, predating Booth's attempt, WMATA {{released}} a professionally designed graphic that displayed the Silver Line on an unofficial map that resembled the current version, but with thin lines. <b>The</b> <b>interplay</b> between Metro's unofficial proposal {{and those of}} other designers received attention in a number of press outlets. A poster displaying a map of similar design has been hanging in DC Councilman Jack Evans' office for a number of years, but received scant attention until 2008.

5|$|In 2015 {{the legacy}} of the crew was brought to the {{forefront}} again when Ryan Goslings new movie 'Lost River' included Bill Aken's (aka Zane Ashton) 1961 hit record of 'He Was A Mean Dragon' as part of the film score. The record featured the early gathering of 'First Call' musician's including Ray Pohlman, Al Casey, Earl Palmer, etc. backing up their youngest member of the group.

50|$|Most known {{substrates}} of p97/CDC48 are modified with ubiquitin {{chains and}} degraded by the 26S proteasome. Accordingly, many p97/CDC48 coenzymes and adaptors have domains that can recognize ubiquitin.

5|$|Innis {{examined}} {{the rise and}} fall of ancient empires as a way of tracing the effects of communications media. He looked at media that led to the growth of an empire; those that sustained it during its periods of success, and then, the communications changes that hastened an empire's collapse. He tried to show that media 'biases' toward time or space affected the complex interrelationships needed to sustain an empire. These interrelationships included the partnership between the knowledge (and ideas) necessary to create and maintain an empire, and the power (or force) required to expand and defend it. For Innis, <b>the</b> <b>interplay</b> between knowledge and power was always a crucial factor in understanding empire.|$|E
5|$|Lastly, Tai Loong had argued, {{even if the}} KD II was {{a fishing}} vessel under the statute, <b>the</b> <b>interplay</b> between two {{sections}} of the SFPA and its implementing regulations rendered them unconstitutionally vague, {{making it impossible for}} it to easily determine whether the statute applied to the KD II. It argued that this failure of the government to thus provide adequate notice that the law would be enforced against such vessels was a violation of their right to due process.|$|E
5|$|Over the {{instrumental}} passage, the tabla rhythm switches to a 10-beat jhaptal cycle. A musical dialogue ensues in 5/4 time, first between the dilruba and sitar, then between a Western string section and sitar. <b>The</b> <b>interplay</b> between these lead instruments adheres to the call-and-response tradition of Indian classical music, known as jawab-sawal. The passage resolves in melodic unison as the instruments together state a rhythmic cadence, or tihai, {{to close the}} middle segment. After this, the drone is again prominent as the rhythm returns to 16-beat tintal for the final verse and chorus. On the finished recording, the tonal and spiritual tension is relieved by the inclusion of muted canned laughter.|$|E
40|$|<b>The</b> <b>interplaying</b> roles among <b>the</b> user groups must be adequately-mapped {{to fulfil}} the design needs of E-government applications. In {{previous}} studies, {{the design of}} citizen-centric e-government and its theoretical understanding is still limited {{in relation to the}} requireme nt of engaging malleable features for supporting all relevant users’ roles in governing bodies. Operationalising IS theories to improve the design of e-government application has been a much sought-after objective. Yet, {{there is a lack of}} actionable guidance on how to develop e-government application that exhibits high levels of users’ engagement through malleable features. Under a participatory good governance perspective, the paper reports a qualitative study and identifies requirement of malleable provisions to support <b>the</b> <b>interplaying</b> roles among users in a case demonstration of extensional service delivery in government.

5|$|Rodin was a naturalist, less {{concerned}} with monumental expression than with character and emotion. Departing with centuries of tradition, {{he turned away from}} the idealism of the Greeks, and the decorative beauty of the Baroque and neo-Baroque movements. His sculpture emphasized the individual and the concreteness of flesh, and suggested emotion through detailed, textured surfaces, and <b>the</b> <b>interplay</b> of light and shadow. To a greater degree than his contemporaries, Rodin believed that an individual's character was revealed by his physical features.|$|E
5|$|Rumours {{garnered}} widespread critical acclaim. Praise {{centred on}} its production quality and harmonies, which frequently relied on <b>the</b> <b>interplay</b> among three vocalists. The record has inspired {{the work of}} musical acts in different genres. Often considered Fleetwood Mac's best release, it has featured in several publications' lists of the best albums of the 1970s and the best albums of all time. In 2004, Rumours was remastered and reissued {{with the addition of}} an extra track and a bonus CD of outtakes from the recording sessions. A three-CD reissue of the album was released by Warner Bros. on 29 January 2013. The set included outtakes of songs and concert tracks the band played while on tour in 1977.|$|E

Finally new classes of examples of paracontact manifolds are presented. 1...|$|R
