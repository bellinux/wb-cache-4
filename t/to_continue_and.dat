5|$|AC/DC {{underwent}} several line-up changes before releasing {{their first}} album, High Voltage, in 1975.

Within months of recording the album Highway to Hell, lead singer and co-songwriter Bon Scott died on 19 February 1980 {{after a night of}} heavy alcohol consumption. The group considered disbanding, but buoyed by support from Scott's parents, decided <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> <b>and</b> set about finding a new vocalist. Ex-Geordie singer Brian Johnson was auditioned and selected to replace Scott. Later that year, the band released the new album, Back in Black, which was made as a tribute to Bon Scott.

5|$|After the War of the Oranges, Portugal {{adopted a}} double policy.

On the other hand, not wanting to breach the Treaty of Windsor (1386) with Portugal's oldest ally, Britain, he allowed for such trade <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> <b>and</b> {{maintained}} secret diplomatic relations with them.

5|$|Another {{issue of}} {{controversy}} was {{the scale of}} its actual scientific return, particularly following {{the loss of the}} Spektr science module. Astronauts, managers and various members of the press all complained that the benefits of the program were outweighed by the risks associated with it, especially considering {{the fact that most of}} the US science experiments had been contained within the holed module. As such, a large amount of American research was inaccessible, reducing the science that could be performed. The safety issues caused NASA to reconsider the future of the program at various times. The agency eventually decided <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> <b>and</b> came under fire from various areas of the press regarding that decision.|$|E
5|$|During {{his time}} at Michigan, Walker was paid by the White Sewing Machine Company of Cleveland to play for their semi-professional ball club in August 1881. Walker's {{presence}} was controversial when the team arrived for a game in Louisville, Kentucky, {{the first place to}} have a major issue with his race. As the team arrived in the early morning of the game, Walker was turned away from the Saint Cloud Hotel. More issues arose during game time: members of the Louisville Eclipse protested Walker's participation; Cleveland relented and held him out of the lineup. After one inning, his substitute claimed his hands were too badly bruised <b>to</b> <b>continue,</b> <b>and</b> Walker hesitantly walked on to the field for warm-ups. Louisville again protested and refused to resume play until Cleveland's third baseman volunteered to go behind the plate.|$|E

5|$|In {{his next}} title defense, Hughes fought Gil Castillo at , {{defeating}} the former Middleweight contender via TKO. Hughes started the match {{with a big}} slam {{and then began to}} attack from Castillo's guard with elbows and punches. Hughes easily avoided any submission attempts and looked far stronger than Castillo. As he passed to half guard, Castillo was bleeding above his left eye. The challenger's only offense was a weak triangle choke that went nowhere. The round ended with Hughes on top, ground-and-pounding his opponent. Between rounds doctors ruled that the resulting cut was too severe <b>to</b> <b>continue,</b> <b>and</b> Hughes was declared the winner due to stoppage.|$|E

He died aged 63 from chronic nephritis on 14 September 1923 at Caulfield in Melbourne, {{survived by his wife}} and two daughters.

Cotto's performance was described as a result of hand speed and accuracy. During the fight Bailey received punches in his face that opened cuts over and under both of his eyes. As a result of the cuts Bailey was examined by the ringside physician. Following this Bailey expressed that he didn't want <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> <b>and</b> the referee stopped the fight at 1:39 of the sixth round.

5|$|On the August 19 {{episode of}} Impact!, the TNA World Heavyweight Championship was vacated after Rob Van Dam was injured by The Monster Abyss and Hardy was entered into an eight-man tournament for the championship, {{defeating}} Rob Terry {{in his first}} round match.

After that and a second five-minute extra time period also ended in draws, it was ruled that Angle was unable <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> <b>and</b> the match ended in a no contest.

5|$|Since its {{founding}} Nea Salamina sought to develop friendly {{relations with the}} Turkish Cypriots in Famagusta, and Turkish Cypriots (including Siekkeris, Nita and Moustafa) played during the early 1950s. When the team joined the CFA, it played against Turkish teams (including Demir Sports, Gençlik Gücü and the Mağusa Türk Gücü) in the second division. When Turkish Cypriot clubs began withdrawing from CFA tournaments of CFA in late 1955, the club tried to convince them <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> <b>and</b> Turkish players remained welcome in Nea Salamina.
