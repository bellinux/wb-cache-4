500|$|The Soviet Union had a {{non-industrial}} {{railway network}} of , of which [...] were electrified. As {{the quality of}} rail transport continued to deteriorate, {{in part because of}} the Russian Civil War, some within the Soviet leadership claimed that the railways were not sustainable if congestions continued to increase. Those who advocated for an enlargement of rail transport felt that increased investment and the lengthening of already established rail tracks could solve the ongoing congestion crisis. The majority agreed on increasing investments, but there was no clear consensus on how these investments were to be used. There were even some who believed in <b>the</b> <b>recapitalisation</b> of the railways. Gosplan economists in the meantime advocated for the rationalisation of the railways, coupled with tariffs based on actual cost, which would reduce traffic demand and provide funds for investment. The leadership was unable to reach a conclusion and the rail system continued to deteriorate. In 1931, in a Central Committee (CC) resolution, it was decided that increased investments coupled with the introduction of newer trains could solve the crisis. This resolution was never carried out, and yet again, the system continued to deteriorate.|$|E

50|$|Through <b>the</b> Bank <b>Recapitalisation</b> Fund, <b>the</b> {{government}} {{bought a}} combination of ordinary shares and preference shares in affected banks. The amount and proportion of the stake taken in any one bank was negotiated with the individual bank.

The long-term government plan was to offset the cost of this program by receiving dividends from these shares, and in the long run, to sell the shares after a market recovery. This plan covered the possibility of underwriting new issues of shares by any participating bank. The plan has been characterised as, in effect, partial nationalisation.|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. Development and Management) [...] North-West University, Vaal Triangle Campus, 2007. The taxi {{industry}} in South Africa {{has had a}} chequered history by being informally organised and with activities fraught with problems of violence, accidents, deaths, unroadworthy vehicles, taxi evasion and unbecoming driver conduct. Government exists, and, through the policy-making process, to regulate affairs of constituents for purpose of promoting human welfare. Such is the premise for Govemment intervention in developing <b>the</b> Taxi <b>Recapitalisation</b> Policy. For <b>the</b> {{purpose of this study}} the hypothesis was constructed that the attempt and process by Govemment to develop a policy of <b>recapitalisation</b> of <b>the</b> taxi industry was flawed and was likely to generate further resistance and violence. In pursuance for search of answers for the hypothesis, use was made of literature study to trace the historical development of the taxi {{industry in}} South Africa, and to analyse the intricacies in the process of the art of policy making. These were further developed by an empirical study that confirmed models in public policy, among others; > The apparent chaos in organisation of the taxi industry had become dysfunctional to human welfare that required Government intervention through policy-making; > The process of regulation was a function of interaction of official and unofficial participants namely: The Department of Transport, Commissions of Inquiries, taxi owners, taxi associations as interest and pressure groups drivers, commuters, banks and insurance companies; and > The consultation process between transport authorities and the taxi industry had not been inclusive enough and consequently failed as an effective tool to bring taxi stakeholders to clear comprehension of <b>the</b> taxi <b>recapitalisation</b> policy. <b>The</b> study concludes with recommendations for Government action, and for further research.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the application of}} the new European rules for burden-sharing and bail-in in the banking sector, in view of their ability to accommodate broader policy goals of aggregate financial stability. It finds that the Treaty principles and the new discipline of state aid and the restructuring of banks provide a solid framework for combating moral hazard and removing incentives that encourage excessive risk-taking by bankers. However, {{the application of the}} new rules may have become excessively attentive to the case-by-case evaluation of individual institutions, while perhaps losing sight of the aggregate policy needs of the banking system. Indeed, in this first phase of the banking union, while large segments of the EU banking sector still require a substantial restructuring and <b>recapitalisation,</b> <b>the</b> market {{may not be able to}} provide all the needed resources in the current environment of depressed profitability and low growth. Thus, a systemic market failure may be making the problem impossible to fix without resorting to temporary public support. But the risk of large write-offs of capital instruments due to burden-sharing and bail-in may represent an insurmountable obstacle to such public support as it may set in motion an investors’ flight. The paper concludes by showing that existing rules do contain the flexibility required to accommodate aggregate policy requirements in the general interest, and outlines a public support scheme for <b>the</b> precautionary <b>recapitalisation</b> of solvent banks that would be compliant with EU law...|$|R

500|$|Nevertheless, in June 2012, Spain {{became a}} prime {{concern for the}} Euro-zone when {{interest}} on Spain's 10-year bonds reached the 7% level and it faced difficulty in accessing bond markets. This led the Eurogroup on 9 June 2012 to grant Spain a financial support package of up to €100 billion. The funds will not go directly to Spanish banks, but be transferred to a government-owned Spanish fund responsible to conduct <b>the</b> needed bank <b>recapitalisations</b> (FROB), and thus it will be counted for as additional sovereign debt in Spain's national account. An economic forecast in June 2012 highlighted the need for <b>the</b> arranged bank <b>recapitalisation</b> support package, as the outlook promised a negative growth rate of 1.7%, unemployment rising to 25%, and a continued declining trend for housing prices. In September 2012 the ECB removed {{some of the pressure}} from Spain on financial markets, when it announced its [...] "unlimited bond-buying plan", to be initiated if Spain would sign a new sovereign bailout package with EFSF/ESM. Strictly speaking, Spain was not hit by a sovereign debt-crisis in 2012, as the financial support package that they received from the ESM was earmarked for a bank recapitalization fund and did not include financial support for the government itself.|$|R

However, as Stefano Micossi explains in this Commentary, the text that has come out of the frantic late-night negotiations in the Ecofin Council seems to leave unwelcome uncertainty as to the real scope of the new rules in the different national jurisdictions, while the lack of depositor preference in the bail-in pecking order may result in destabilisation. The proposed system appears not only highly intrusive but it also places a considerable burden of aid to the failing institution on the member state, raising doubts about its ability to “break the vicious circle between banks and sovereigns”...|$|R
