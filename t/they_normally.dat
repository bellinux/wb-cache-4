5|$|Azotobacter {{species are}} free-living, nitrogen-fixing bacteria; in {{contrast}} to Rhizobium species, <b>they</b> <b>normally</b> fix molecular nitrogen from the atmosphere without symbiotic relations with plants, although some Azotobacter species are associated with plants. Nitrogen fixation is inhibited {{in the presence of}} available nitrogen sources, such as ammonium ions and nitrates.|$|E
5|$|North American river otters live {{an average}} of 21 years of age in captivity, but they can reach 25 years of age. However, <b>they</b> <b>normally</b> live about 8 to 9 years in the wild, but are capable of living up to 13 years of age.|$|E
5|$|Sound {{movement}} {{through the atmosphere}} is affected by wind shear, which can bend the wave front, causing sounds to be heard where <b>they</b> <b>normally</b> would not, or vice versa. Strong vertical wind shear within the troposphere also inhibits tropical cyclone development, but helps to organize individual thunderstorms into living longer life cycles that can then produce severe weather. The thermal wind concept explains how differences in wind speed with height are dependent on horizontal temperature differences, and explains {{the existence of the}} jet stream.|$|E

5|$|Stallions must be {{registered}} New Foresters, {{and are not}} allowed to run free all year round on the Forest. <b>They</b> <b>normally</b> are turned out only for a limited period in the spring and summer, when they gather several groups of mares and youngstock into larger herds and defend them against other stallions. A small number (usually fewer than 50) are turned out, generally between May and August. This ensures that foals are born neither too early (before the spring grass is coming through), nor too late (as the colder weather is setting in and the grazing and browsing on the Forest is dying back) in the following year.|$|E
5|$|The closest {{relatives}} of mantises are the termites and cockroaches (Blattodea), {{which are all}} within the superorder Dictyoptera. Mantises are sometimes confused with stick insects (Phasmatodea), other elongated insects such as grasshoppers (Orthoptera), or other insects with raptorial forelegs such as mantisflies (Mantispidae). Mantises are mostly ambush predators, but a few ground-dwelling species are found actively pursuing their prey. <b>They</b> <b>normally</b> live for about a year. In cooler climates, the adults lay eggs in autumn, then die. The eggs are protected by their hard capsules and hatch in the spring. Females sometimes practice sexual cannibalism, eating their mates after copulation.|$|E
5|$|Giraffe groups {{tend to be}} sex-segregated {{although}} mixed-sex groups made {{of adult}} females and young males are known to occur. Particularity stable giraffe groups are those made of mothers and their young, which can last weeks or months. Social cohesion in these groups is maintained by the bonds formed between calves. Female association appears {{to be based on}} space-use and individuals may be matrilineally related. In general, females are more selective than males in who they associate with in regards to individuals of the same sex. Young males also form groups and will engage in playfights. However, as they get older males become more solitary but may also associate in pairs or with female groups. Giraffes are not territorial, but they have home ranges. Male giraffes occasionally wander far from areas that <b>they</b> <b>normally</b> frequent.|$|E

5|$|P. rebeli live in {{different}} habitats; therefore, {{they do not}} parasitize the same Myrmica ant species. Through observation and experimentation, researchers found that if P. rebeli try to parasitize a different Myrmica ant species than the one <b>they</b> <b>normally</b> do, the Myrmica ants will identify the P. rebeli larvae as intruders and will kill 100% of the P. rebeli larvae. The differences between the P. rebeli are that they synthesize different hydrocarbons, which allow them to mimic different species of Myrmica ants. This explains why they have no success in being mistaken for another species of Myrmica ant and the ensuing 100% mortality rate when the other Myrmica ant species is not fooled.|$|E
5|$|Several minutes later, {{the main}} body of the raid reached the {{southern}} shore of Førde Fjord travelling north. To their surprise, the Allied planes passed directly over the German ships and came under intense attack from anti-aircraft guns, though no aircraft were hit. In response, Milson wheeled his force to the right in an attempt to attack the ships from east to west as planned. The steep walls of the fjord protected Z33 from attack from this direction, however. As a result, Milson led the force west to near the mouth of the fjord and ordered the Beaufighters to attack in relays from west to east. This required the aircraft to fly into the face of alerted German defences and then escape over steep mountains. The narrow confines of the fjord also meant that the Beaufighters had to attack individually from a single direction and would not be able to swamp the German defences as <b>they</b> <b>normally</b> sought to do.|$|E
5|$|Six to 12 larval stages occur. During {{the first}} two stages, the larvae live off {{surrounding}} fungal tissue, until they reach the inner wood. Up to the fourth stage, they eat through the final summer wood along the tracheids, and finally towards the heartwood. After the seventh stage, they usually reach their maximum size. While penetrating further, <b>they</b> <b>normally</b> turn either up or down, but they turn back if they meet a foreign borehole, encounter bubbles of resin, or dry out. The larvae only live off the fungal mycelium, which they digest through a secretion. They pupate several centimeters under the bark. Before this, female larvae sequester a secretion containing fungal oidia, which adult females incorporate in their mycetangia above their ovipositors. The adults eat through the bark, but, depending on the weather, they remain in the hatch hole {{for up to three}} weeks before they leave the wood in warm and sunny weather.|$|E

5|$|Studies {{have sought}} to find the precise {{function}} of Mups in pheromone communication. Mup proteins {{have been shown to}} promote puberty and accelerate the estrus cycle in female mice, inducing the Vandenbergh and Whitten effects. However, in both cases the Mups had to be presented to the female dissolved in male urine, indicating that the protein requires some urinary context to function. In 2007 Mups normally found in male mouse urine were made in transgenic bacteria, and therefore created devoid of the chemicals <b>they</b> <b>normally</b> bind. These Mups were shown to be sufficient to promote aggressive behaviour in males, {{even in the absence of}} urine. In addition, Mups made in bacteria were found to activate olfactory sensory neurons in the vomeronasal organ (VNO), a subsystem of the nose known to detect pheromones via specific sensory receptors, of mice and rats. Together, this demonstrated that Mup proteins can act as pheromones themselves, independent of their ligands.|$|E
5|$|The pair {{defends the}} chosen nest site against other peregrines, and often against ravens, herons, and gulls, and if ground-nesting, also such mammals as foxes, wolverines, felids, bears, wolves, and {{mountain}} lions. Both nests and (less frequently) adults are predated by larger-bodied raptorial birds like eagles, large owls, or gyrfalcons. The most serious predators of peregrine nests in North America and Europe are the {{great horned owl}} and the Eurasian eagle owl. When reintroductions have been attempted for peregrines, the most serious impediments were these two owls routinely picking off nestlings, fledglings and adults by night. Peregrines defending their nests have managed to kill raptors as large as golden eagles and bald eagles (both of which <b>they</b> <b>normally</b> avoid as potential predators) that have come {{too close to the}} nest by ambushing them in a full stoop. In one instance, when a snowy owl killed a newly fledged peregrine, the larger owl was in turn killed by a stooping peregrine parent.|$|E
5|$|The revolt {{started in}} Nablus with the Palestinian general strike in April 1936. The strike spread {{to a number}} of cities {{throughout}} Palestine, including Tulkarm where al-Hajj Muhammad helped organize the campaign. By the summer of that year, several Palestinian Arab rebel bands had sprung up, including the forces of al-Hajj Muhammad. The latter used existing social networks and the complex web of local clan politics to build alliances both with the middle classes of the major towns, particularly the well-educated activists, and the rural clan elders to build a solid base of resistance against the British. In order to avoid detection, al-Hajj Muhammad refrained from commanding a large unit of troops. Instead, he raised small, semi-permanent bands of volunteers called fasa'il (sing. fasl) as he moved from one area to another. <b>They</b> <b>normally</b> launched nighttime attacks against specific targets.|$|E
50|$|Spotting {{in weight}} or {{resistance}} training, is {{the act of}} supporting another person during a particular exercise, {{with an emphasis on}} allowing the participant to lift or push more than <b>they</b> could <b>normally</b> do safely. Correct spotting involves knowing when to intervene and assist with a lift, and encouraging a training partner to push beyond the point in which <b>they</b> would <b>normally</b> 'rack' the weight (return it to its stationary position).|$|R

5|$|Salt {{is mostly}} sodium chloride, the ionic {{compound}} with the formula NaCl, representing equal proportions of sodium and chlorine. Sea {{salt and freshly}} mined salt (much of which is sea salt from prehistoric seas) also contain small amounts of trace elements (which in these small amounts are generally good for plant and animal health). Mined salt is often refined {{in the production of}} table salt; it is dissolved in water, purified via precipitation of other minerals out of solution, and re-evaporated. During this same refining process it is often also iodized. Salt crystals are translucent and cubic in shape; <b>they</b> <b>normally</b> appear white but impurities may give them a blue or purple tinge. The molar mass of salt is 58.443 g/mol, its melting point is 801°C (1,474°F) and its boiling point 1,465°C (2,669°F). Its density is 2.17 grams per cubic centimetre and it is readily soluble in water. When dissolved in water it separates into Na+ and Cl− ions, and the solubility is 359 grams per litre. From cold solutions, salt crystallises as the dihydrate NaCl·2H2O. Solutions of sodium chloride have very different properties from those of pure water; the freezing point is −21.12°C (−6.02°F) for 23.31wt% of salt, and the boiling point of saturated salt solution is around 108.7°C (227.7°F).|$|E
