5|$|The {{launch of}} Halo 3 {{coincided with the}} release of various games, action figures, and {{collectible}} toys. WizKids developed a Clix collectible miniatures game entitled Halo ActionClix which was released on September 18, 2007. <b>The</b> <b>tabletop</b> game features miniature figures from the Halo universe, including characters and vehicles. Halo ActionClix figures were occasionally bundled with the game in promotional packs, and Gamestation stores in the United Kingdom offered a Master Chief figurine to the first 1000 pre-orders of the Halo 3 Legendary Edition.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> Concrete <b>Tabletop</b> Redux - <b>The</b> next day, the {{concrete}} forms {{are removed from}} <b>the</b> <b>tabletops.</b> Deen's and Matt's tabletops come off beautifully, and they both pass. Cory's does not come off beautifully at all, his rough edges earning him a failure. Simon's tabletop ends up weighing 300 pounds, meaning that he and Joey have to get help from Matt and Silent Keith to lift it, and its excessive weight combined with Simon's failure to read the instructions results in a failure. Angela passes, further distancing Matt from his goal of getting Angela to be named Canada's Worst Handyman.|$|R

25|$|The {{evolving}} and specializing outdoor games finally led to indoor versions {{that could}} be played on a table, such as billiards, or {{on the floor of}} a pub, like bowling and shuffleboard. <b>The</b> <b>tabletop</b> versions of these games became the ancestors of modern pinball.|$|E
25|$|Benchtop {{table saws}} {{are the least}} {{expensive}} and least capable {{of the three major}} types; however, they can offer adequate capacity and precision for many tasks. The universal motor is not as durable or as quiet as an induction motor, but it offers more power relative to its size and weight. The top of a benchtop table saw is narrower than those of the contractors and cabinet saws, so the width of stock that can be ripped is reduced. Another restriction results from the top being smaller from the front of <b>the</b> <b>tabletop</b> to the rear. This results in a shorter rip fence, which makes it harder to make a clean, straight cut when ripping. Also, there is less distance from the front edge of <b>the</b> <b>tabletop</b> to the blade, which makes cross cutting stock using a mitre more difficult (the mitre and/or stock may not be fully supported by {{the table in front of}} the blade). Benchtop saws are the smallest type of table saw and have the least mass, potentially resulting in increased vibration during a cut.|$|E
25|$|Although {{supportive}} of the project, the publisher expressed concerns that the demo lacked a grand scale in keeping with MicroProse's hit strategy game Civilization. The Civilopedia feature of Civilization also inspired an addition of the in-game encyclopedia, called the UFOpaedia. All that and the UFO theme was suggested by MicroProse UK head of development Pete Moreland. Julian Gollop's personal inspirations included several traditional games, in particular, the board wargame Sniper! and <b>the</b> <b>tabletop</b> role-playing game Traveller.|$|E

25|$|The game {{features}} {{four different}} playable races from the Warhammer game, and the units available to each race are taken straight from <b>the</b> <b>tabletop</b> wargame. All the races are visually distinctive, {{and have their}} own unique units, {{although there is a}} lot of crossover between factions and each type of unit will usually have an equivalent unit in another race. Within each race there are also 3 different factions, which are available to be used in multiplayer games. However beyond cosmetic differences, and the selection of troops there is minimal difference between the 3 factions.|$|E
25|$|Interventionalists {{require a}} {{floating}} tabletop to allow fast and precise movements during angiography. Cardiac and vascular surgeons, in general, have less complex positioning needs, {{but based on}} their interventional experience in angiography {{may be used to}} having fully motorized movements of the table and <b>the</b> <b>tabletop.</b> For positioning patients on non breakable tabletops, positioning aids are available, i.e. inflatable cushions. Truly floating tabletops are not available with conventional OR tables. As a compromise, floatable angiography tables specifically made for surgery with vertical and lateral tilt are recommended. To further accommodate typical surgical needs, side rails for mounting surgical equipment like retractors or limb holders should be available for the table.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> Shepard <b>tabletop</b> illusion, {{consisting}} of different perspective embeddings of two identical parallelograms as tabletops, affords a profound {{difference in their}} perceived surface shapes. My analysis reveals three further paradoxical aspects of this illusion, {{in addition to its}} susceptibility to the ‘inverse perspective illusion’ of the implied orthographic perspective of the table images. These novel aspects of the illusion are: a paradoxical slant of <b>the</b> <b>tabletops,</b> a paradoxical lack of perceived depth, and a paradoxical distortion of the length of the rear legs. The construction of the illusion resembles scenes found in ancient Chinese scroll paintings, and an analysis of the source of the third effect shows that the interpretation in terms of surfaces can account for the difference in treatment of the filled-in versus open forms in the Chinese painting from more than 1000 years ago...|$|R

500|$|Nintendo DS {{games that}} use the device's top and bottom screens as one {{continuous}} screen are harder to control because of {{a gap in the}} middle, sometimes called a visual [...] "dead zone"; objects in this area are not visible. The developers of Metroid Prime Pinball, a game which takes advantage of both screens, resolved this problem by placing a second set of pinball flippers {{at the bottom of the}} upper screen to give players a reference to work with. The tabletops in the game use pre-rendered artwork for graphical effects, including Samus's Morph Ball, which uses renderings of images at several different angles to provide a smooth animation. To simulate the appearance of a real pinball game from a player's point of view, <b>the</b> <b>tabletop</b> in Metroid Prime Pinball was tipped back. The game offers players the ability to nudge the table, a technique used in pinball games to influence the ball's movement. This is achieved by touching the Nintendo DS's bottom touchscreen with a finger and pushing it in the direction that the player wants to nudge <b>the</b> <b>tabletop.</b> The game's soundtrack was composed by Kenji Yamamoto and Masaru Tajima, with audio effects from the Metroid Prime series are borrowed by the game to provide a [...] "CD-like" [...] music experience. The voice of the Power Suit was provided by Lorelei King.|$|E
500|$|A {{standalone}} retail disc {{release of}} Undead Nightmare followed in late November 2010. The release compiles the Undead Nightmare campaign with two smaller Red Dead Redemption download packs: [...] "Legends and Killers" [...] and [...] "Liars and Cheats". [...] "Legends and Killers" [...] adds more multiplayer features, such as challenges and maps. [...] "Liars and Cheats" [...] adds multiplayer versions of <b>the</b> <b>tabletop</b> bar games {{featured in the}} game's single-player campaign. Since the base game and its expansion share the same multiplayer, Official Xbox Magazine described the standalone Undead Nightmare as {{the same as the}} original game save for having swapped its single-player campaign for a new one.|$|E
500|$|The {{creation}} of roguelike games came from hobbyist programmers and computer hackers, attempting to create {{games for the}} nascent computer field in the early 1980s, particularly influenced by the 1975 text adventure game Colossal Cave Adventure (often simply titled Adventure), and from the high fantasy setting of <b>the</b> <b>tabletop</b> game Dungeons & Dragons. Some elements of the roguelike genre were present in dungeon crawlers written for the PLATO system. This includes pedit5 (1975) {{believed to be the}} first dungeon crawl game, and featured random monster encounters, though only used a single fixed dungeon level. pedit5 inspired similar PLATO-based dungeon crawlers dnd (1975), orthanc (1978), Moria (1978), and [...] avatar (1979). It is unclear if these PLATO games inspired the roguelike genre as there is no evidence that the early roguelike creators had access to these games. The core roguelike games were developed independently of each other, many of the developers not learning about their respective projects until several years after the genre took off.|$|E

500|$|For combat, {{multiple}} references were used. These included [...] for {{the cover}} system and tactical combat; F.E.A.R. {{for the design of}} AI; BioShock for the interlinking of weapon and obstacle types; the Call of Duty series for the regenerating health system; and Resident Evil 4 for multiple aspects including the inventory system, game economy and contextual actions. Regenerating health ended up being divisive among the fanbase during the game's run-up to release, despite it being seen as a necessary inclusion in the modern gaming market. Combat was intended to be easy-to-understand and visceral, with enemy types ranging from normal humans to augmented humans to robots, all mixed and matched for different combat situations. For stealth gameplay, the team used Metal Gear Solid as reference for the AI and alert systems, and [...] for the general organic feel of stealth. They had similar precepts to combat, wanting to make this style's rules and rewards clear to players. Interactive hacking was one of the earliest things the team had decided upon, alongside not including quick time events. The Hacking mechanics were inspired by <b>the</b> <b>tabletop</b> role-playing game Shadowrun. They were designed to invoke tension, and require a survey of both the surroundings and the security system {{while at the same time}} providing rewards. Social interactions followed similar patterns, becoming an extension to the general gameplay, with a similar risk-reward system.|$|E
500|$|Hironobu Sakaguchi had {{intended}} to make a role-playing game (RPG) for a long time, but his employer Square refused to give him permission as it expected low sales of such a product. However, when the RPG Dragon Quest was released and {{proved to be a}} hit in Japan, the company reconsidered its stance on the genre and approved Sakaguchi's vision of an RPG inspired by [...] and [...] Only three of his colleagues volunteered to join this project headed by him because he was thought of as a [...] "rough boss" [...] in spite of his unsuccessful creations. Eventually, Final Fantasy was developed by a team of seven core staff members within Square referred to as the [...] "A-Team". Sakaguchi convinced fellow game designers Koichi Ishii and Akitoshi Kawazu to join the project. Kawazu was mainly responsible for the battle system and sequences, which he based heavily on <b>the</b> <b>tabletop</b> game Dungeons & Dragons and the RPG Wizardry. For example, enemies' weaknesses to elements such as fire and ice had not been included in Japanese RPGs up until that point. Kawazu had grown fond of such aspects of Western RPGs and decided to incorporate them into Final Fantasy. He also advocated the player's option to freely choose their own party member classes {{at the beginning of the}} game as he feels [...] "the fun in an RPG begins when you create a character".|$|E
