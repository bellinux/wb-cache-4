5|$|Eliot {{began writing}} The Dry Salvages {{at the end}} of 1940 during air-raids on London, and managed to finish the poem quickly. The poem {{included}} many personal images connecting to Eliot's childhood, and emphasised the image of water and sailing as a metaphor for humanity. According to the poem, there is a connection to all of mankind within each man. If we just accept drifting upon the sea, then we will end up broken upon rocks. We are restrained by time, but the Annunciation gave mankind hope that {{it will be able to}} escape. This hope is not part of the present. What we must do is understand the patterns found within the past in order <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is meaning to be found. This meaning allows one to experience eternity through moments of revelation.|$|E
5|$|The central {{image of}} The Dry Salvages is {{water and the}} sea. The images {{are similar to the}} Odyssey but {{represent}} internal aspects. Humanity loses itself to technology and theories like evolution that separate mankind philosophically from the past. According to Eliot, within each man there is a connection to all of mankind. If we just accept drifting upon the sea, then we will end up broken upon rocks. We are restrained by time, but the Annunciation gave mankind hope that {{he will be able to}} escape. This hope is not part of the present. What we must do is understand the patterns found within the past <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is meaning to be found. This meaning allows one to experience eternity through moments of revelation. Through Christ, we are able to overcome time unless we do not know him. Our corruption can be overcome and that we are able to join the eternal.|$|E

500|$|Flagg’s {{character}} has its detractors. In his essay [...] "The Glass-Eyed Dragon", author L. Sprague de Camp criticizes Flagg in Eyes of the Dragon, {{saying that he}} is one of the least-believable characters in the book and too evil to be credible. According to de Camp, absolute evil is hard to envision; whereas Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin believed they were improving the world, Flagg only enjoys causing destruction and chaos. De Camp notes that Flagg fails <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is no advantage to his actions.|$|E
500|$|In a May 8, 2008 {{report on}} the recent actions of Anonymous against Scientology, CNN {{reporter}} Kareen Wynter commented: [...] "Legal experts say the church may be facing its biggest challenge yet – trying to protect its image, in a loosely policed medium seen by millions of people. In a July 2008 interview with Entertainment Weekly, Alan Moore {{had this to say}} about the use of the Guy Fawkes motif, adopted from his comic V for Vendetta: [...] "I was also quite heartened the other day when watching the news <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> were demonstrations outside the Scientology headquarters over here, and that they suddenly flashed to a clip showing all these demonstrators wearing V for Vendetta [...] masks. That pleased me. That gave me a warm little glow." ...|$|E
500|$|Ruth's {{marriage}} to David {{is central to}} her character. Finch explained that it took Ruth a while <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> were good qualities in David, as his initial behaviour towards her was unpleasant. Finch called David [...] "a sexist pig" [...] and said he resented Ruth's presence almost immediately. However, Ruth had noticed his ruggedness and she was attracted {{to the way he}} helped the sickly animals. After David noticed his brother flirting with Ruth, he realised that he loved her and told her about his feelings. Despite getting off to a bad start, Ruth and David began dating and were married towards the end of 1988. Finch thought Ruth and David had [...] "a really believable partnership" [...] and were well-suited, saying [...] "They are both very capable of becoming highly emotional if something riles them but thankfully they tend to react to different things. So, often one will be able to calm, soothe and support the other through most crises. Or at least provide some kind of balance to a problem." [...] The actress added that Ruth and David are the best of friends.|$|E

500|$|In a twist from expectation, Eliot's poem {{suggests}} that old men {{should go out}} and explore. He warns that people should trade wisdom for pointless experience and argues that men should explore human experience itself. This concept is hinted of in The Waste Land and draws from the ideas within Dante's Convivio. Dante argues that old men are supposed to return to God and describes the process in a way similar to the travels of Odysseus. Unlike Homer's hero, Dante argues that men should not travel in the material world but in the spiritual world. Both Dante and Eliot put forth a similar view to St. Augustine when they focus on internal travels. Through these travels, mankind is able to have faith in salvation and able <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is more to the world than darkness. Eliot explains within the poem {{that we are all}} interconnected through time and that we must realize this. Only through this realization is mankind able to understand the truth of the universe. This, in turn, would allow humanity to break free from the burden of time. As Russel Kirk explains: [...] "That end, for those who apprehend a reality superior to 'birth, copulation, and death'—a reality transcending the rhythms of physical nature—is to know God and enjoy Him forever." ...|$|E
500|$|There {{was little}} advance {{excitement}} about the pending Warriors-Knicks game that Friday. Only five games {{remained in the}} regular season, with the Warriors (46–29) in second place—eleven games behind the Boston Celtics—and the Knicks in last place. Chamberlain {{had spent the night}} before the game in New York City, partying all night with a female companion before dropping her off at her home at 6am With no sleep and suffering from a hangover, he boarded the train to Philadelphia at 8am, met several friends at the Philadelphia train station, and had a long lunch with them, thus almost missing the team bus to Hershey. The other players were similarly bored. Warriors player York Larese said: [...] "The biggest thrill in my life was <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that.</b> <b>There</b> was nothing exciting about the Knicks playing the Warriors in Hershey. Chocolate was more exciting." [...] The game was played at Hershey Sports Arena, an old drafty gym originally built for ice hockey. The league occasionally played games in remote towns to attract new fans. This was the Warriors' third [...] "home" [...] game of the season in Hershey, which was [...] from Philadelphia. [...] The Warriors' Tom Meschery called the arena [...] "god-forsaken place ... The town of Hershey was built around a huge chocolate factory; everything there became permeated with the smell of chocolate. It was practically impossible to stay indoors; people felt sick. I was just dreaming to leave the place as fast as I could." ...|$|E

Ziegler expects to do more acting. She told Hunger magazine in 2016: [...] "I don’t want <b>to</b> always be <b>seen</b> as a reality TV person.

2500|$|Coinage of {{the term}} [...] "smog" [...] is {{generally}} attributed to Dr. Henry Antoine Des Voeux in his 1905 paper, [...] "Fog and Smoke" [...] for {{a meeting of the}} Public Health Congress. The July 26, 1905 edition of the London newspaper Daily Graphic quoted Des Voeux, [...] "He said it required no science <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was something produced in great cities which was not found in the country, and that was smoky fog, or what was known as 'smog'." [...] The following day the newspaper stated that [...] "Dr. Des Voeux did a public service in coining a new word for the London fog."

5000|$|The Italian {{government}} decided on 22 April 2008 to give Alitalia an emergency loan of €300m ($475m) {{in an attempt}} to stave off the airline's collapse. The outgoing administration of Romano Prodi agreed the lifeline with new Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, who was elected in office in April 2008. Alitalia must prevent its capital from sinking below the threshold set by European rules. If Alitalia cannot meet this obligation, including safety guarantees, Italian aviation authorities could revoke Alitalia's license. The chairman of Italy's civil aviation agency ENAC, Vito Riggio, said [...] "they have <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>there's</b> continuity, among other things, for safety," [...] and [...] "They have to guarantee they have (financial) coverage for at least a year." [...] Riggio told a talk show on state radio that ENAC could either revoke Alitalia's license or give it a provisional one if the airline cannot save itself financially. He did not give a time frame for any decision.|$|R
