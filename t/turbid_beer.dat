40|$|A {{spoilage}} organism {{isolated from}} <b>turbid</b> <b>beer</b> is described. The bacterium was gram negative, catalase negative, strictly anaerobic, and rod shaped, having flagella only {{on one side}} of the cell. The main metabolic product was propionic acid. In addition acetic, succinic, and lactic acids and acetoin were formed. Malonate inhibited the production of propionic acid by the strain studied and by both Pectinatus and Propionibacterium strains. The guanine-plus-cytosine content of deoxyribonucleic acid was 36 mol%. Differences between this strain and Pectinatus strains were 2 to 5 percentage points. Immunofluorescent staining and gel diffusion precipitin tests revealed that the antigenic structure differed from those of Pectinatus strains. The isolated organism can, despite some differences, be regarded as belonging to the genus Pectinatus...|$|E
40|$|In this study, the {{indigenous}} alcoholic beverages {{in a rural}} village of Cameroon were investigated. The technique for producing alcoholic beverages in the village was observed, and the concentrations of ethanol, glucose and lactic acid and the pH values {{during the course of}} production were measured using portable devices at the field site. Eight different kinds of alcoholic beverage (palm wine, palm spirits, raffia wine, cassava spirits, maize <b>turbid</b> <b>beer,</b> maize spirits, plantain wine and plantain spirits) were produced and consumed in the village. Of these beverages, palm wine, made from palm sap, was the most important alcoholic beverage in a villager's daily life. In addition, starch-based alcoholic beverages were distilled rather than drunk directly. As germinated maize, which has a relatively low amylase activity, was used as an amylase source in production, starch-based alcoholic beverages might need to be distilled to enhance the ethanol concentration. During the course of production, the pH was reduced using local techniques, which proved to be effective in preventing bacterial contamination...|$|E
40|$|A {{representative}} sampling of beers and laboratory worts were measured spectrophotometrically. The {{applicability of the}} Bouguer-Lambert-Beer law to beers and worts without visible turbidity, the independence of cell position for measurement of bright beers, {{the adequacy of the}} SRM/EBC color indices to accurately characterize the color of beer and wort, the verity of Linner’s observation of linear with wavelength log Absorbance spectra, and the dimensionality of beer spectra are examined. It was concluded that SRM/EBC color does not accurately characterize the color of beer, that the Bouguer-Lambert-Beer law does apply to beers free from visible turbidity, that the cell position does not materially affect the measurement of non-turbid beers (but does so for <b>turbid</b> <b>beers),</b> and that Linner’s observation also applies reasonably (but not perfectly) well to beers and worts. It is tentatively concluded that beer spectra ar...|$|R
40|$|In this study, the {{production}} techniques of indigenous alcoholic beverages {{in a rural}} village in Tanzania were investigated. In the village, three different kinds of alcoholic beverages were produced: a maize <b>turbid</b> <b>beer</b> (komoni), a straw beer (kimpumu) and a hybrid straw beer (kiambule). In the course of {{the production}} of these three alcoholic beverages, two different kinds of porridge, a fermented porridge (nyambo) as a source of yeasts and a sweet porridge (kikonde) as a source of saccharides, were produced. These porridges were mixed {{at the end of the}} production process. The pH value of fermented porridge was kept below 4 during its preparation. This was effective in preventing contamination of the porridge by harmful bacteria and in stabilizing the growth of the yeasts. Sweet porridge was heated in the range of 50 – 70 [*]°C and this enhanced the saccharification of the starch in the raw materials. The starting materials of these alcoholic beverages were finger millet and maize. Germinated finger millet, which has a high amylase activity compared with other cereals, was used as an amylase source in each of the alcoholic beverage production processes. Various techniques to enhance and stabilize the quality of the indigenous alcoholic beverages are described...|$|E
40|$|Postharvest losses (PHL) destroy 20 - 60 % of {{the food}} {{production}} in East Africa, exacerbating already severe regional food insecurity. Fermenting perishable foods such as fruits may reduce PHL while providing nutritional enrichment, improving shelf-life and food quality, and addressing seasonality in food supply. Fermented banana products have been refined and diversified in Uganda over generations to make the greatest use of available food resources, but still parts of the raw material are being lost during processing. This study aimed at exploring existing traditional methods and efficiency of fermentation of Musa (AAA-EAHB) 'Mbidde' in southwestern Uganda. The study gathered information through participatory explorations (working with brewers) on banana juice (lightly fermented beer with < 1 % alcohol content [n= 20 brewers]), tonto (<b>turbid</b> <b>beer</b> with ~ 4 % alcohol [n= 20]), and amarwa (smoky spirit with ~ 40 % alcohol [n= 20]). Brewers mentioned several losses of material during harvest and processing. Harvesting bananas requires felling the plant causing ripe fruit damage, particularly during harvest for processing banana juice (loss from fresh bananas= 6. 4 %± 8. 8 %) or amarwa (loss= 9. 3 %± 9. 5 %). Second, losses occur when brewers squeeze juice from the raw banana pulp using stems of Imperata cylindrica, which is then discarded or fed to animals together with the adherent fruit pulp (losses from raw banana juice= 50. 6 %± 0. 2 %; from tonto 39. 2 %± 21. 4 % and amarwa 47. 6 %± 12. 5 %). Other causes of PHL during processing are excessive peeling for tonto processing (loss of banana flesh= 18. 6 %± 5. 8 %) and losses of intermediate products during distillation of amarwa (loss= 75. 9 %± 1. 3 %). Total losses of banana products during processing were rare and caused by sabotage (mostly by children), mistakes in the brewing process (e. g. addition of too much water), using bananas of wrong ripening stage, and equipment failure (e. g., burst or leaking drums in distillation equipment). Other non-PHL challenges include Banana Xanthomonas Wilt (BXW) and bad weather (up to 50 % losses in the field). Despite the general efficiency of traditional fermentation practices, significant portions of fruit are still lost. Reduction in PHL can complement, both culturally and nutritionally, the role that fermented banana products play in Ugandan food systems and contribute to regional food security. Collaborative mechanisms for PHL reduction should target the cited sources of PHL...|$|E
