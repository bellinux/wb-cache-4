5|$|As {{with the}} {{automated}} mill, Evans's ideas were harshly criticized by other engineers—most notably {{some of the}} Philadelphia engineering community including the influential Benjamin Latrobe. As it happened, Cornish engineer Richard Trevithick had simultaneously developed similar ideas in favor of high-pressure engines and begun <b>to</b> <b>experiment</b> <b>with</b> them in developing the first locomotives, but neither knew of the other's work.|$|E

5|$|Despite the Supreme Court's {{desire to}} resolve {{conflicts}} between circuit courts, legal scholars disagree about whether circuit splits are detrimental or beneficial. Some argue that circuit splits are harmful because they create confusion and encourage forum shopping, while other {{scholars argue that}} variation among circuits allows local courts <b>to</b> <b>experiment</b> <b>with</b> new laws that reflect the values of local residents. Scholars have also observed that regional variations in {{different areas of the}} United States have provided certain circuits with a particular specialization or expertise in some subjects of the law.|$|E
5|$|During the 1980s, a Thrud {{comic strip}} {{was a regular}} and popular feature in the roleplay and wargame {{magazine}} White Dwarf with Thrud's grotesque and comic antics forming a memorable part of the magazine's golden age. In 2002, continued interest in the character from role-playing enthusiasts {{and a desire to}} be free <b>to</b> <b>experiment</b> <b>with</b> a new artistic style prompted Critchlow to self-publish a series of award-winning full-length Thrud the Barbarian comics.|$|E
5|$|During {{the filming}} and {{promotion}} of Daft Punk's Electroma, the duo {{went to great lengths}} to avoid showing their faces. While on the set of the film, the duo chose to be interviewed with their backs turned. As reported on October 2006, the band went as far as to wear black cloth over their heads during a televised interview. During this interview they noted that the use of cloth bags in particular had been a spontaneous decision, reflecting their willingness <b>to</b> <b>experiment</b> <b>with</b> their perceived image in the media.|$|E

5|$|It {{also led}} to the birth and {{diffusion}} of small independent record labels, often an extension of record shops and independent recording studios, which sometimes produced both punk and metal releases. Indie labels are considered important to the movement's evolution, because they removed the intrusion of corporate business which had hindered rock music in the late 1970s, giving local bands the chance <b>to</b> <b>experiment</b> <b>with</b> more extreme forms of music.|$|E

SpaceX subsequently switched its focus to developing a powered descent landing system.|$|E
5|$|The Imagists {{rejected}} the sentiment and discursiveness typical of much Romantic and Victorian poetry, {{in contrast to}} their contemporaries, the Georgian poets, who were generally content to work within that tradition. Imagism called {{for a return to}} what were seen as more Classical values, such as directness of presentation and economy of language, as well as a willingness <b>to</b> <b>experiment</b> <b>with</b> non-traditional verse forms.

5|$|Throughout the {{expedition}} Nansen continued <b>to</b> <b>experiment</b> <b>with</b> equipment and techniques, altering {{the designs of}} skis and sledges and investigating types of clothing, tents and cooking apparatus, thereby revolutionising methods of Arctic travel. In the era of polar exploration which followed his return, explorers routinely sought Nansen's advice as to methods and equipment—although sometimes they chose not to follow it, usually to their cost. According to Huntford, the South Pole heroes Amundsen, Scott, and Ernest Shackleton were all Nansen's acolytes.|$|E
5|$|While Australian artists embraced {{modernism and}} {{addressed}} the city, Rix Nicholas focussed on representing a pastoral ideal. In France in the 1920s, Rix Nicholas had entertained Roy de Maistre, {{one of the}} first Australians <b>to</b> <b>experiment</b> <b>with</b> abstractionism, and enthusiastically asked him to share more about his 'colour-music theory'; however when modernism confronted Australian art in the 1920s and 1930s, Rix Nicholas sided against it.|$|E
5|$|After {{the success}} of No Doubt's {{breakthrough}} album Tragic Kingdom (1995), the band wrote more than 20 songs for a new album, influenced by artists such as The Cure. Having toured extensively {{for two and a}} half years since the release of Tragic Kingdom, they initially had trouble producing material and decided <b>to</b> <b>experiment</b> <b>with</b> new sounds. Many of the songs were written in a rented house in Hollywood Hills, Los Angeles, where bassist Tony Kanal was living. During early production in mid-1998 the band worked on seven tracks in Los Angeles with Matthew Wilder, who had produced Tragic Kingdom, but had creative differences with him. They planned on going to New York City to work with producer Michael Beinhorn, who had produced for alternative rock acts such as Red Hot Chili Peppers, Hole, and Soundgarden.|$|E

5|$|Alongside his {{stand-alone}} illustrations, in July 1926 Hergé began {{production of}} a comic strip for Le Boy-Scout Belge, Les Aventures de Totor (The Adventures of Totor), which continued intermittent publication until 1929. Revolving around the adventures of a Boy Scout patrol leader, the comic initially featured written captions underneath the scenes, but Hergé began <b>to</b> <b>experiment</b> <b>with</b> other forms of conveying information, including speech bubbles. Illustrations were also published in Le Blé qui lève (The Wheat That Grows) and other publications of the Catholic Association of Belgian Young People, and Hergé produced a book jacket for Weverbergh's novel, The Soul of the Sea. Being young and inexperienced, still learning his craft, Hergé sought guidance from an older cartoonist, Pierre Ickx, and together they founded the short-lived Atelier de la Fleur de Lys (AFL), an organisation for Christian cartoonists.|$|E
5|$|Born to a music-loving family, Ravel {{attended}} France's premier music college, the Paris Conservatoire; he was {{not well}} regarded by its conservative establishment, whose biased treatment of him caused a scandal. After leaving the Conservatoire, Ravel found his own way as a composer, developing a style of great clarity, incorporating elements of baroque, neoclassicism and, in his later works, jazz. He liked <b>to</b> <b>experiment</b> <b>with</b> musical form, as in his best-known work, Boléro (1928), in which repetition {{takes the place of}} development. He made some orchestral arrangements of other composers' music, of which his 1922 version of Mussorgsky's Pictures at an Exhibition is the best known.|$|E
5|$|C. Rudhraiya, whose former {{name was}} Aarumugam, was {{introduced}} to Kamal Haasan by writer and director Ananthu. The three shared {{an interest in the}} works of Robert Bresson, Jean-Luc Godard, Roman Polanski, and Roberto Rossellini. Godard and Bresson were part of the French New Wave, which focused on films based on social ideas, some of which were iconoclastic in nature. Rudhraiya, Haasan, and Ananthu wanted <b>to</b> <b>experiment</b> <b>with</b> their ideas in Tamil. This was Rudhraiya's first film as director; quite radical in his approach, he wanted to change the conventions of Tamil cinema at that time. K. Rajeshwar was writing a script dealing with women's liberation at that time, and it was decided that his script would be used for the film; the result was Aval Appadithan. The initial script by Rajeshwar consisted of two pages.|$|E

5|$|Derek Meddings {{and a team}} of 28 {{technicians}} {{completed the}} special effects shots for the film in six months. Their main assignments included the Zero-X launches, re-shot, widescreen launch sequences for the Thunderbird machines, the car chase between Lady Penelope and Parker in FAB1 and the Hood, scenes at The Swinging Star, the Mars shots involving the MEV and the mysterious Rock Snakes, and the ultimate destruction of Zero-X in the climax. Over 300 effects shot were completed with scale models. The team made use of the extra space afforded to them by the new special effects building <b>to</b> <b>experiment</b> <b>with</b> floor-level shots and other more creative camera angles.|$|E
5|$|During a {{thorough}} study, the national BSA staff interviewed participants, parents, and leaders. They distributed questionnaires to program participants, reviewed the White Stag literature, and observed {{the program in}} action. They also conducted a statistical analysis of troops taking part in White Stag and compared them to non-participating units. In December 1965, Chief Scout Executive Joseph Brunton received the White Stag Report. It stated that offering leadership development to youth was a unique opportunity for Scouting to provide a practical benefit to youth and would add substantial support to Scouting's character development goals. It recommended that Wood Badge should be used <b>to</b> <b>experiment</b> <b>with</b> the leadership development principles of White Stag. The program had until this time taught the adults the same Scoutcraft skills a boy was required to learn to become a First Class Scout along with concepts of the patrol method.|$|E
5|$|During his {{apprenticeship}} {{and early}} career Wright concentrated on portraiture. By 1762, {{he was an}} accomplished portrait artist, and his 1764 group portrait James Shuttleworth, his Wife and Daughter is acknowledged as his first true masterpiece. Benedict Nicolson suggests that Wright {{was influenced by the}} work of Thomas Frye; in particular by the 18 bust-length mezzotints which Frye completed just before his death in 1762. It was perhaps Frye's candlelight images that tempted Wright <b>to</b> <b>experiment</b> <b>with</b> subject pieces. Wright's first attempt, A Girl reading a Letter by candlelight with a Young Man looking over her shoulder from 1762 or 1763, is a trial in the genre, and is fetching though uncomplicated.|$|E
