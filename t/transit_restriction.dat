Not only foreign transporters {{will be forced}} to adjust to this measure, also domestic carriers will have to adapt transport equipment and delivery schedules to the new situation. Since commodities occupy a high share in total road <b>transit,</b> <b>restrictions</b> in the granting of transit permits could lead to a shift from road to rail without causing serious disruptions for the division of labour in the international economy.

40|$|Timely {{arrival of}} a Carrier Battle Group (CVBG) at an {{assigned}} location is extremely important for successful execution of tactical, strategic or logistic operations. Weather conditions, tasking requirements, battle group defense and <b>transit</b> <b>restrictions</b> all impact on the CVBG's rate of advance while in transit to its newly assigned station. If these variables are not carefully considered and accounted for, then the CVBG, in all likelihood, will arrive late at its destination. This paper develops a mathematical model, which incorporates these transit variables, to assist the Battle Group Commander in successfully planning flight operations which will meet both CVBG defensive and routine tasking requirements and as well as arrive at its destination on time. This model {{through the use of}} elastic constraints will provide the commander with maximum flexibility and allow him to determine any inconsistencies between desired tasking and transit requirements[URL]...|$|R
40|$|Magister Legum - LLMThe {{problems}} {{connected with}} transit of goods {{also have been}} mostly neglected in the respective literature so far: In most books about {{the law of the}} WTO, Article V of GATT 1994 has been left out completely or reference is only made to the text of the article. In the following, this thesis will thus examine (i) what <b>transit</b> <b>restrictions</b> exist for the transport of Ugandan goods from and to the international market through Kenya (see Chapter 2 below); (ii) whether these measures adopted in Kenya are in compliance with the relevant law of the EAC (see Chapter 3 below) and of the WTO (see Chapter 4 below); and (iii) if there is a conflict in jurisdiction in this respect (see Chapter 5 below). In addition, it will then shortly show the current status of the current negotiations of the WTO Trade Facilitation Committee and the possible implications of the Revised Draft Negotiation Text (see Chapter 6 below...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{provides}} an overview of the situation of public transit in the Federal Republic of Germany as well as its integration into considerations of transportation policy. It is the goal of transportation policy to effect a shift of parts of urban automobile traffic to public <b>transit.</b> Beyond <b>restrictions</b> on private vehicle travel this requires an improvement of the service quality of public transit. Research and development in public transit serve this goal. The emphasis of research is in the following areas: organization of public transit, expansion of fixed-guideway transit systems in major cities, use of demand-responsive operation modes with low travel demand, improvement of transit network and schedule structure, acceleration and stabilization of transit vehicle progression, improvement of comfort levels for access and transport, differentiation of fares and simplification of fare structure, improvement of passenger information and assistance and rationalization of service provision. ...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the relationships between car parking, public transport, travel behaviors, and health outcomes for adults (n = 1, 188) traveling to a worksite. Public transport was used for 12. 1 % of the work-related commute. Those who had higher levels of walking, no worksite car park access, lived proximal to a public transport stop, had limited automobile availability, traveled to the main business district, perceived public transport as accessible, or did not have company car access {{were more likely to}} use public transportation. Accordingly, proximal residential <b>transit</b> stops and <b>restrictions</b> for company car accessibility and parking at the worksite are needed. adults; car parking; public transport; physical activity; global positioning systems...|$|R
40|$|The {{isolation}} of a somatic cell mutant (Mev- 1) with a block {{in one of}} the mevalonate-biosynthesizing enzymes (3 -hydroxy- 3 -methylglutaryl-coenzyme A synthase, EC 4. 1. 3. 5) has afforded us the opportunity to test and to extend the hypothesis that a product of mevalonate biosynthesis other than cholesterol is required for cellular proliferation. We present evidence here that both DNA synthesis and protein synthesis are inhibited in this mutant by mevalonate starvation, although RNA synthesis appears to be unaffected. The loss of DNA synthesis and the loss of protein synthesis in this mutant appear to be due to independent processes. DNA synthesis is reversibly inhibited by mevalonate starvation at a unique point in the cell cycle. Resumption of DNA synthesis after readdition of mevalonate exhibits a long lag; the peak of S-phase DNA synthesis occurs approximately 17 hr after mevalonate readdition, suggesting that mevalonate starvation puts cells into a quiescent (G 0) state owing to their failure to <b>transit</b> a <b>restriction</b> point. The loss of DNA biosynthesis in the Mev- 1 cell is well correlated with the rate of turnover of mevalonate label of certain terpenylated polypeptides...|$|R
30|$|Empirical {{findings}} have documented that individuals employ {{a wide variety}} of strategies when faced with restrictions imposed by transport policies (e.g., decreased <b>transit</b> services, gasoline <b>restrictions)</b> [1 â€“ 3], strategies that range from simple modal shifts to more complex adaptations involving trip consolidation (i.e., chaining), activity re-scheduling and destination substitution. Conventional travel demand models do not reflect (and hence predict) these complex responses, however, because of several theoretical shortcomings. In addition, estimation of the likely impacts of various activity system policies (e.g., flexitime, extended hours of service facilities) is beyond the realm of the present models, which means that separate understandings have to be built on various episodes affecting travel behaviour and made into concrete variables for the transport modelling process.|$|R
40|$|D-type cyclin/cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) {{complexes}} regulate <b>transit</b> {{through the}} <b>restriction</b> {{point of the}} cell cycle, and thus are required for the initiation of DNA synthesis. Transgenic mice which overexpress cyclin D 1 in the heart were produced to determine if D-type cyclin deregulation would alter myocardial development. Cyclin D 1 overexpression resulted in a concomitant increase in CDK 4 levels in the adult myocardium, as well as modest increases in proliferating cell nuclear antigen and CDK 2 levels. Flow cytometric and morphologic analyses of dispersed cell preparations indicated that the adult transgenic cardiomyocytes had abnormal patterns of multinucleation. Histochemical analyses confirmed a marked increase in number of cardiomyocyte nuclei in sections prepared from the transgenic mice as compared with those from control animals. Tritiated thymidine incorporation analyses revealed sustained cardiomyocyte DNA synthesis in adult transgenic hearts...|$|R
5000|$|Coronation Drive {{developed}} {{as the major}} transport route for the western suburbs along with Milton Road. A landslide caused by flood waters in 1974 closed Coronation Drive due to cracking and subsidance. The flood caused the redirection of Coronation Drive so that traffic inbound to Brisbane City turned left at the Sylvan Road intersection, and then right down Land Street. In 2004 Coronation Drive was completely redeveloped into its current day form, with the redirection removed and widening to allow 6 lanes of traffic. Former Lord Mayor Jim Soorley inaugurated a series of [...] "tidal flow" [...] traffic lights in both directions, {{as well as a}} dedicated bus lane, in order to ease congestion along the road. Upon the election of Campbell Newman, the bus lanes were changed to T3 Transit Lanes with three occupants required. In March 2007 the T3 <b>transit</b> lane <b>restrictions</b> were removed after Campbell Newman requested the change based on analysis showing that only 5% of vehicles actually use the T3 lane. The Labor opposition did not block the change.In September 2008, the Council announced a decision to scrap the Tidal Flow System after conceding it as a failure. This decision was influenced by the construction of the Hale Street Bridge and also the maintenance cost of the system, amounting to $600,000 each year, with a further $7 million in repairs. Instead, 3 permanent lanes will be inbound to the city and 2 lanes outbound. Statistics show that more traffic travels inbound than outbound at both morning and afternoon peak hours. One of the inbound lanes will be made into a T2 lane once the Hale Street Bridge project is well developed.|$|R
40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that {{wild-type}} human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) protein can functionally replace the human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV- 16) E 6 protein, which cooperates with the viral E 7 protein in the immortalization of primary keratinocytes. In the current study, we made the surprising finding that catalytically inactive hTERT (hTERT-D 868 A), elongation-defective hTERT (hTERT-HA), and telomere recruitment-defective hTERT (hTERT N+T) also cooperate with E 7 in mediating bypass of the senescence blockade and effecting cell immortalization. This suggests that hTERT has activities independent of its telomere maintenance functions that mediate <b>transit</b> across this <b>restriction</b> point. Since hTERT has been shown to have a role in gene activation, we performed microarray studies and discovered that E 6, hTERT and mutant hTERT proteins altered the expression of highly overlapping sets of cellular genes. Most important, the E 6 and hTERT proteins induced mRNA and protein levels of Bmi 1, the core subunit of the Polycomb Group (PcG) complex 1. We show further that Bmi 1 substitutes for E 6 or hTERT in cell immortalization. Finally, tissue array studies demonstrated that expression of Bmi 1 increased with the severity of cervical dysplasia, suggesting a potential role in the progression of cervical cancer. Together, these data demonstrate that hTERT has extra-telomeric activities that facilitate cell immortalization and that its induction of Bmi 1 is one potential mechanism for mediating this activity...|$|R
