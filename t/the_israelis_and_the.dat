25|$|The truce was {{designed}} to last 28 days and an arms embargo was declared with the intention that neither side would make any gains from the truce. Neither side respected the truce; both found ways around the restrictions placed on them. Both <b>the</b> <b>Israelis</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Arabs used this time to improve their positions, a direct violation {{of the terms of}} the ceasefire.|$|E
25|$|The first {{peacekeeping}} mission {{was launched in}} 1948. This mission, the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization (UNTSO), {{was sent to the}} newly created State of Israel, where a conflict between <b>the</b> <b>Israelis</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Arab states over the creation of Israel had just reached a ceasefire. The UNTSO remains in operation to this day, although the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict has certainly not abated. Almost a year later, the United Nations Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan (UNMOGIP) was authorized to monitor relations between the two nations, which were split off from each other following the United Kingdom's decolonization of the Indian subcontinent.|$|E
25|$|On 5 June 1967 the Six-Day War {{began after}} an Israeli strike wiped out Egypt's Air Force. The Egyptian army {{commander}} in Cairo transmitted to General Riad that the Israeli strike had failed, and that Israel's Air Force was almost wiped out. Based {{on the information}} from Cairo, Riad ordered the Jordanian army to take offensive positions and attack Israeli targets around Jerusalem. Jordanian Hawker Hunters made sorties but were destroyed by Israel {{when they went to}} refuel; Syria's and Iraq's air forces followed. Israel's air superiority {{on the first day of}} war proved decisive. Two Israeli jets attempted to assassinate Hussein; one was shot down by anti-aircraft artillery, and the other shot directly at Hussein's office in the royal palace. Hussein was not there, the CIA director in Amman Jack O'Connell relayed a message threatening <b>the</b> <b>Israelis,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> attempts stopped. The Jordanians had prepared a war strategy, but the Egyptian commander preferred to build his strategy based on information from Egypt.|$|E

Spitzer claimed that Rogge was using a Munich ceremony organised by <b>the</b> <b>Israelis</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> London Jewish community on August 6 as an excuse not to hold the moment of silence. Spitzer said, “Jacques Rogge is {{using it as a}} hideaway. If the Israeli embassy and London Jewish community were not organizing it, he would not have any memorial to go to." ...|$|E
2500|$|Clayton Swisher wrote a {{rebuttal}} to Clinton and Ross's accounts {{about the}} causes for {{the breakdown of the}} Camp David Summit in his 2004 book, The Truth About Camp David. Swisher, the Director of Programs at the Middle East Institute, concluded that <b>the</b> <b>Israelis</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Americans were at least as guilty as the Palestinians for the collapse. M.J. Rosenberg praised the book: [...] "Clayton Swisher's 'The Truth About Camp David,' based on interviews with [...] Martin Indyk, Dennis Ross and [...] Miller himself provides a comprehensive and acute account – the best we're likely to see – on the [...] Miller describes." ...|$|E

2500|$|In his book, The Oslo Syndrome, Harvard Medical School {{professor}} of psychiatry and historian Kenneth Levin summarized {{the failure of the}} 2000 Camp David Summit in this manner: [...] "espite the dimensions of the Israeli offer and intense pressure from President Clinton, Arafat demurred. [...] He apparently was indeed unwilling, no matter what the Israeli concessions, to sign an agreement that declared itself final and forswore any further Palestinian claims." [...] Levin argues that both <b>the</b> <b>Israelis</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Americans were naive in expecting that Arafat would agree to give up the idea of a literal [...] "right of return" [...] for all Palestinians into Israel proper no matter how many 1948 refugees or how much monetary compensation Israel offered to allow.|$|E
2500|$|Cain {{supports}} Israel, {{and believes}} that the US should aid Israel in defending itself. [...] After President Obama said that {{the starting point of}} negotiations for peace between <b>the</b> <b>Israelis</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Palestinians should be based on the 1967 borders with mutually agreed-upon land swaps, Cain said: I was shocked at the president's position, and I was equally shocked that he would unilaterally suggest that Israel would move the borders back which they acquired 44 years ago. [...] This president threw Israel under the bus, there is no way around it. It demonstrates once again the arrogant disregard of this president for the opinion of the American people who like the relationship we have with Israel, and for Israel having the right to make its own decisions.|$|E
2500|$|The {{fact that}} Obama never {{mentioned}} the word [...] "terrorism" [...] or [...] "terror" [...] was positively interpreted {{by many in}} the Muslim street, given that many of them see a 'war on terror' interchangeably as a 'war on Islam'. American conservatives also picked up on this and argued that it weakened Obama's overall message. House Republican leader John Boehner also commented after the speech that Obama [...] "seemed to place equal blame on <b>the</b> <b>Israelis</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Palestinians.... I have concerns about that because Hamas is a terrorist organisation". As well, he said, [...] "here he continues to say he will sit down with the Iranians without any preconditions, I just think that that puts us in a position where America looks weak in the eyes of their rulers." ...|$|E

What we know about the Indians in Canada. They are blessed. But that blessing is being {{destroyed}} by your immigrants that are going over there. Especially the Jews, they said. The Second World War was started by the Jews and the Third World War, whatever it is, is between Israel and the Arab countries. I was there as well.

2500|$|Israeli {{officials}} said the British informed them Friday {{that they would be}} withdrawing the monitoring team but did not provide a date. U.S. {{officials said}} <b>the</b> <b>Israelis</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Palestinians were notified as the three British guards on duty at the time departed. Stuart Tuttle, a spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv, said that [...] "The withdrawal decision was made on the ground and not in coordination with the Israelis". Senior U.S. {{officials said the}}y {{had no choice but to}} abandon the facility, even though they realized it might undermine the Palestinian Authority, and that they did not make public their concerns because they believed publicity would have made the U.S. and British personnel the targets of attacks. A senior administration official said: [...] "That is the price we pay. Our first responsibility is the safety of American and British monitors". State Department spokesman J. Adam Ereli denied any coordination with Israel and said: [...] "Such accusations are baseless and ignore the facts, quite frankly".|$|E
2500|$|Some libertarians {{have argued}} for the Palestinian right of return largely from a private {{property}} rights perspective. In [...] "Property Rights and the 'Right of Return'" [...] professor Richard Ebeling writes: [...] "If a settlement is reached between <b>the</b> <b>Israelis</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Palestinians, justice would suggest that all legitimate property {{should be returned to}} their rightful owners and that residence by those owners on their property should be once again permitted." [...] Attorney Stephen Halbrook in [...] "The Alienation of a Homeland: How Palestine Became Israel" [...] writes: [...] "Palestinian Arabs have the rights {{to return to their homes}} and estates taken over by Israelis, to receive just compensation for loss of life and property, and to exercise national self-determination." [...] In [...] "War Guilt in the Middle East" [...] Murray Rothbard details Israel's [...] "aggression against Middle East Arabs," [...] confiscatory policies and its [...] "refusal to let these refugees return and reclaim the property taken from them." ...|$|E
