The breadfruit tastes like Yorkshire pudding or mashed potato; with meat {{it is the}} best of vegetables; with sugar, milk, butter or molasses, it is a delicious pudding with a special flavour; Radau hopes <b>that</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>it</b> will one day be found in European markets. As for the sago palm, one tree yields 1,800 cakes, enough to feed a man for a year.|$|E
5|$|Catherine {{states that}} Northanger Abbey looks exactly as she {{imagined}} {{it and she}} becomes intrigued by Mrs. Tilney's death. Due to her overactive imagination, Catherine starts to believe that General Tilney murdered his wife. Henry catches her in his mother's chamber and becomes offended when he realises what she has been thinking. Catherine apologises and Henry tells her <b>that</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>it</b> is possible to read too many novels. Catherine receives a letter from James, in which he reveals that his engagement to Isabella has been called off, because she allowed Frederick to seduce her. Eleanor explains to Catherine that her brother {{has no intention of}} marrying Isabella. Catherine gets a letter from Isabella, asking her to apologise to James for her, but Catherine states that she will do no such thing.|$|E

Lewis wrote back, appearing to support the younger Krieg's views, although he did point out that the views of the author {{may not be the best}} guidance, and <b>that</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>it</b> would not matter what order they were read in.|$|E

25|$|Those Protestants who {{do believe}} in the {{importance}} of a future rebuilt temple (viz., some dispensationalists) hold that the importance of the sacrificial system shifts to a Memorial of the Cross, given the text of Ezekiel Chapters 39 and following (in addition to Millennial references to the Temple in other Old Testament passages); since Ezekiel explains at length the construction and nature of the Millennial temple, in which Jews will once again hold the priesthood; some others hold <b>that</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>it</b> was not completely eliminated with Jesus' sacrifice for sin, but is a ceremonial object lesson for confession and forgiveness (somewhat like water baptism and Communion are today); and that such animal sacrifices would still be appropriate for ritual cleansing and for acts of celebration and thanksgiving toward God. Some dispensationalists believe this will be the case with the Second Coming when Jesus reigns over earth from the city of New Jerusalem.|$|E

The original draft was grimmer, including details about the previous death of Gwyneth's younger brother, but in subsequent drafts the story became more of a [...] "romp". Gatiss stated that the name [...] "Gelth" [...] simply popped into his head. Gatiss was encouraged to personify the Gelth, which he originally questioned because he felt that monsters whispering [...] "Doctor" [...] was a cliché; producer Phil Collinson remarked <b>that</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>it</b> was a cliché because it worked well. The Rift was added into the plot to simplify the Gelth's origins.|$|E
500|$|Houston stated {{he had not}} lobbied the Treasury for the coin, and Perkins, before {{promising}} {{to find out more}} information, speculated <b>that</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>it</b> was because the coins were to be issued far from the continental United States. [...] Houston told the committee that the coin was [...] "something that may be kept by those who attend the celebration as a memorial of it and will be available to foreigners who come there, as well as our own people who celebrate the occasion". [...] Kvale stated he would vote for the bill. Mississippi's Bill G. Lowrey noted that as he had said before, he would not vote for any coin bill; Perkins agreed that Lowrey had made his position clear. Perkins issued a report on February 1, 1928, recounting the history behind the proposed coin and indicating his committee's support.|$|E
500|$|Evan {{decides to}} build the ark alone, gaining media {{attention}} and public ridicule as hundreds of animals assemble in pairs. Meanwhile, God appears to Joan as a waiter at a diner, where he listens {{to her as she}} expresses concern that Evan is losing his sanity and allowing himself to become a laughing stock, though claiming that [...] "God told him to do it." [...] Sympathetic toward Evan, God tells Joan <b>that</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>it</b> is only opportunity for them, and explains that he does not give things but only the opportunity by which to obtain things, citing togetherness of families as one of these things. Seeing God's meaning, Joan finally returns to Evan with new-found faith and continues helping him finish the ark together in order to prepare for the flood. On September 22, the day of the flood, Evan's staffers arrive in support as well and Eugene shows him research he performed on Long. It is revealed that, many years ago, Long conquered Prestige Crest and later commissioned a dam, then destroyed the remaining land to have many of the lots and houses built. Long cut corners in building the dam, and will most likely {{do the same thing with}} his Public Land Act bill.|$|E

500|$|According to Procopius (The Vandalic War, I.11), {{the army}} {{consisted}} of 10,000 infantry, partly {{drawn from the}} field army (comitatenses) and partly from among the foederati, as well as 5,000 cavalry. There were also some 1,500–2,000 of Belisarius' own retainers (bucellarii), an elite corps (it is unclear if their number {{is included in the}} 5,000 cavalry mentioned as a total figure by Procopius). In addition, there were two additional bodies of allied troops, both mounted archers, 600 Huns and 400 Heruls. The army was led by an array of experienced officers, among whom the eunuch Solomon was chosen as Belisarius' chief of staff (domesticus) and the former praetorian prefect Archelaus was placed in charge of the army's provisioning. The whole force was transported on 500 vessels manned by 30,000 sailors under admiral Calonymus of Alexandria, guarded by ninety-two dromon warships. The traditional view, as expressed by J.B. Bury, is that the expeditionary force was remarkably small for the task, especially given the military reputation of the Vandals, and <b>that</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>it</b> reflects the limit of the fleet's carrying capacity, or perhaps it was an intentional move to limit the impact of any defeat. Ian Hughes however comments that even in comparison with the armies of the early Roman Empire, Belisarius' army was a [...] "large, well-balanced force capable of overcoming the Vandals and may have contained a higher proportion of high quality, reliable troops than the armies stationed in the east".|$|E
500|$|During early previews of the song, Corner spoke most on Gambino's guest appearance, {{describing}} the collaboration as [...] "unlikely on paper" [...] {{but then in}} reality [...] "it results in one of Leona's most natural collaborations to date". Commenting on the song as a whole, Corner said [...] "Trouble" [...] was a powerful comeback, [...] "It's big, it's emotional and it's what we've come to expect from the Hackney belle – but we wouldn't want it any other way." [...] Gordon Smart, showbiz editor for The Sun added that although [...] "it {{was a long time}} coming, [...] 'Trouble' will definitely make people interested in a full album" [...] mainly down the new sound, image and Gambino's guest rap which will [...] "help shake off Lewis' safe image." [...] Lewis Corner from Digital Spy also picked up on the change of direction and commented that people would be [...] "shocked," [...] but then added that [...] "when [...] "it results in an emotive anthem like this, we hope she unleashes it more often." [...] The Guardians Michael Cragg called [...] "Trouble" [...] a return to the [...] "safer" [...] templates of her first two albums, but praised the song's production calling it [...] "a vaguely trip-hop beat buffeted by soaring strings and a troubled lyric in the chorus." [...] Like previous reviews, Cragg also praised Gambino stating that he [...] "manages to stamp his own personality on the song" [...] despite appearing {{near the end of the}} song and <b>that</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>it</b> was Lewis' best chance at [...] "regaining her footing in America".|$|E
500|$|Dissenting, Justice Scalia {{would have}} held that {{although}} Abramski made a false statement by claiming {{that he was the}} buyer/transferee, since Alvarez was lawfully able to buy the gun, the statement is not [...] "with respect to any fact material to the lawfulness of the sale," [...] which is the requirement in §922(a)(6). Additionally, the dissent criticized the government's use of the [...] "agency law" [...] principle to determine that Abramski was a third party’s common-law agent for Alvarez. Instead, the dissent believed that common English should be used to interpret statutes, and therefore, under the statue, Abramski was the [...] "person" [...] buying the gun, not Alvarez. Furthermore, the dissent did not think that the statute is [...] "rendered meaningless" [...] simply because one can buy a gun on behalf of another, just like it is not rendered meaningless when one gifts a gun. The dissent also wondered why the majority wouldn't agree that this is yet another loophole to a statute that has so many loopholes, and argued <b>that</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>it</b> was congress' intent to only limit the actual person at the counter. The dissent also stated that even if the majority had the proper interpretation of the statute, the ambiguity should be resolved in favor of lenity. Regarding the Section 924 charges, the dissent explained that the statute clearly lists what the dealer is required to maintain on record, and that {{the answer to the question}} of whether he is the actual buyer is not on the list. The dissent stated that the majority's interpretation ultimately carried the text too far. [...] "f the bureaucrats responsible for creating Form 4473 decided to ask about the buyer’s favorite color, a false response would be a federal crime." [...] Justice Scalia concluded with the statement: ...|$|E

50|$|An {{example of}} {{welfarist}} thought is Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall's meat manifesto. Point three of eight is:Think about {{the animals that}} the meat you eat comes from.

2500|$|Myers further {{stated that}} [...] "several {{faculty members and}} deans {{suggested}} <b>that</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>it</b> was time to stop playing ranking roulette and {{opt out of the}} survey." [...] Myers next argued that at the NEAIR (North East Association for Institutional Research) 33rd Annual Conference in 2006, a talk given by U.S. News, [...] "indicated that if a school stops sending data, the default assumption will be that it performs one standard deviation below the mean on numerous factors for which U.S. News can't find published data. Again, making up the numbers it can't get. The message is clear. Unless we are willing to be badly misrepresented, we had better send the information the magazine wants." ...|$|E
2500|$|Not {{long after}} the {{conclusion}} of The Reader, a former editor, Norman Lockyer, decided {{to create a new}} scientific journal titled Nature, taking its name from a line by William Wordsworth: [...] "To the solid ground of nature trusts the Mind that builds for aye". First owned and published by Alexander Macmillan, Nature was similar to its predecessors in its attempt to [...] "provide cultivated readers with an accessible forum for reading about advances in scientific knowledge." [...] Janet Browne has proposed that [...] "far more than any other science journal of the period, Nature was conceived, born, and raised to serve polemic purpose." [...] Many of the early editions of Nature consisted of articles written by members of a group that called itself the X Club, a group of scientists known for having liberal, progressive, and somewhat controversial scientific beliefs relative to the time period. Initiated by Thomas Henry Huxley, the group consisted of such important scientists as Joseph Dalton Hooker, Herbert Spencer, and John Tyndall, along with another five scientists and mathematicians; these scientists were all avid supporters of Darwin's theory of evolution as common descent, a theory which, during {{the latter half of the}} 19th century, received a great deal of criticism among more conservative groups of scientists. Perhaps it was in part its scientific liberality that made Nature a longer-lasting success than its predecessors. John Maddox, editor of Nature from 1966 to 1973 as well as from 1980 to 1995, suggested at a celebratory dinner for the journal's centennial edition <b>that</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>it</b> was the journalistic qualities of Nature that drew readers in; [...] "journalism" [...] Maddox states, [...] "is a way of creating a sense of community among people who would otherwise be isolated from each other. This is what Lockyer's journal did from the start." [...] In addition, Maddox mentions that the financial backing of the journal in its first years by the Macmillan family also allowed the journal to flourish and develop more freely than scientific journals before it.|$|E
