5|$|Kinne {{was arrested}} at her home for the murder around 11 p.m. on May 31, the same night as Patricia Jones's funeral. The same day, the Jackson County Sheriff {{requested}} <b>that</b> <b>prosecutors</b> consider a second charge of murder, this one {{for the death of}} James Kinne. Kinne's lawyers, Alex Peebles and Martha Sperry Hickman, filed a writ of habeas corpus with the court the next morning, and a hearing that afternoon resulted in her release on $20,000 bond while she awaited a preliminary hearing originally scheduled for June 16.|$|E
5|$|NC1 was {{the first}} to be sentenced, on 28 February 1990, after {{pleading}} guilty to having sex with someone under the age of consent. He was given six months' custody in a detention centre, the maximum possible sentence for a youth charged with that offence. Kerry Carrington and Andrew Johnson, writing in The Australian Feminist Law Journal, said it was likely <b>that</b> <b>prosecutors</b> did not charge NC1 with rape, as a conviction on such a charge would have been unlikely {{due to a lack of}} evidence; Leigh's complaints about the incident as reported by witnesses were hearsay and therefore inadmissible in court. On 11 May the sentence was reduced on appeal to 100 hours' community service. In reducing his sentence the judge stated the evidence obliged him to find that the sex was consensual, and that it was better for NC1 to do something positive for the community rather than possibly being led further astray in custody. A number of sources state the judge reached the conclusion that the sex had been consensual because of the inadequate way the evidence was presented to the court.|$|E

25|$|In June 2003, {{prosecutors}} in Hamilton County, Ohio, attempted to revive criminal charges of pandering obscene material against Flynt {{and his brother}} Jimmy Flynt, charging that they had violated the 1999 agreement.

25|$|In November 2016, Crawford's {{conviction}} {{was overturned}} by the Louisiana Supreme Court, {{who found that}} additional pathology reports indicated his son died from pneumonia, and <b>that</b> <b>Prosecutor</b> Cox may have discriminated against black jurors during jury selection.

25|$|In 2007, federal {{prosecutors}} sought {{to have his}} probation revoked for failure to file his 2005 tax return. U.S. Magistrate Judge Deborah Robinson refused, saying <b>that</b> <b>prosecutors</b> had not proved that the failure was willful, even if Barry was aware he had missed the deadline. According to Judge Robinson, sentencing Barry to jail without proving that he willfully failed to file his taxes would contradict precedent set by the United States Supreme Court.|$|E
25|$|On February 22, Associate Deputy Attorney General Steven Reich {{conducted}} a briefing for congressional staffers {{involved in the}} investigation.

25|$|Justice White {{went on to}} argue, {{on public}} policy grounds, that the Court's holding would {{negatively}} impact the justice system. His concern was <b>that</b> <b>prosecutors</b> would cease to seek joint trials in cases of interlocking confessions, while judges would not admit codefendant's confessions as a prophylactic measure, even where no harmful error would likely result. This would overburden the state, inconvenience police and witnesses, cause delays in the trial system, and possibly lead to inconsistent verdicts, he continued.|$|E
25|$|Los Angeles County Judge Robert J. Perry was {{assigned}} to the case. He said that he would not allow cameras in the courtroom. A hearing was held on February 19, 2010 to address two issues. The judge did not reduce Mehserle's bail, as requested by the defense. The judge also rejected a motion by the defense to remove Alameda County prosecutors from the case. Rains had argued <b>that</b> <b>prosecutors</b> and detectives acted inappropriately when they interviewed Mehserle earlier in the case. Another hearing was set for March 26.|$|E
25|$|Blagojevich {{was indicted}} {{by a federal}} grand jury in April 2009. Most of the charges related to {{attempts}} to sell the Senate seat vacated by then-President-elect Barack Obama. On August 17, 2010, he was convicted on one of the 24 federal charges, a charge of lying to the FBI, and the jury was hung on 23 other counts. The defense did not call a single witness, claiming <b>that</b> <b>prosecutors</b> did not prove their case. Because the jury could not agree on the remaining charges, a mistrial was ordered for those counts. Within fifteen minutes after the mistrial was declared, the prosecution team announced that they would definitely pursue a retrial on the twenty-three mistrial counts. A post-verdict court date was set for August 23, 2010.|$|E

5000|$|Christian and {{political}} leaders came out with strong criticisms of the representation. Pastor Silas Malafaia said in a video posted on his website <b>that</b> the <b>prosecutor</b> is the same person who accepted and filed a homophobia complaint against him: [...] "I'm suspicious <b>that</b> this <b>prosecutor</b> has nothing to do. I think the Attorney General has {{to get a job}} for this citizen". Malafaia also recalled that the Constitution is presented as being elaborated [...] "under the protection of God", and <b>that</b> the <b>prosecutor</b> should also propose the change of the name of states such as Santa Catarina ("St. Catherine"), São Paulo ("St. Paul") and Espírito Santo ("Holy Ghost"), in addition to national Catholic holidays.|$|R

25|$|On December 30, the New York Post {{reported}} that several sanitation workers confessed that cleanup was intentionally slowed down {{to protest the}} aforementioned budget cuts. On January 3, 2011, WCBS-TV reported <b>that</b> <b>prosecutors</b> had obtained a video of two sanitation trucks driving down 155th Street in Whitestone, Queens after the blizzard with their plows raised {{so as not to}} remove the snow. Allegations were also made that sanitation workers slept on the job, hung out at a doughnut shop for 11 straight hours while on the job, and drank beer for six or seven hours while on the job. Claims were also made that supervisors encouraged such work stoppages. However, a month later, the New York Times {{reported that}} the allegations of a slowdown remained unsubstantiated and that Councilman Daniel Halloran, who had originally reported the confessions, had not named his sources.|$|E
25|$|In June 2007, two {{men were}} convicted of eight counts {{stemming}} from sending millions of e-mail spam messages that included hardcore pornographic images. Jeffrey A. Kilbride, 41, of Venice, California was sentenced to six years in prison, and James R. Schaffer, 41, of Paradise Valley, Arizona, was sentenced to 63 months. In addition, the two were fined $100,000, ordered to pay $77,500 in restitution to AOL, and ordered to forfeit more than $1.1 million, the amount of illegal proceeds from their spamming operation. The charges included conspiracy, fraud, money laundering, and transportation of obscene materials. The trial, which began on June 5, {{was the first to}} include charges under the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003, according to a release from the Department of Justice. The specific law <b>that</b> <b>prosecutors</b> used under the CAN-Spam Act was designed {{to crack down on the}} transmission of pornography in spam.|$|E
25|$|The Silverman {{trial was}} unusual in many aspects, namely the rare {{combination}} of a mother/son team {{and the fact that}} no body was ever recovered. Nonetheless, the jury was unanimous in voting to convict them not only of murder but of 117 other charges including robbery, burglary, conspiracy, grand larceny, illegal weapons possession, forgery and eavesdropping on their first poll on the subject. The judge also took the unusual step of ordering Kimes not to speak to the media even after the jury had been sequestered {{as a result of her}} passing a note to New York Times reporter David Rhode in court. The judge threatened to have Kimes handcuffed during further court appearances if she persisted and restricted her telephone access to calls to her lawyers. The judge contended that Kimes was attempting to influence the jury as they may have seen or heard any such interviews, and that there would be no cross-examination as there would be in court. Kimes had earlier chosen to not take the stand in her own defense after the judge ruled <b>that</b> <b>prosecutors</b> could question her about the previous conviction on slavery charges.|$|E
