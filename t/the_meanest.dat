Only a Brahmins could be an acharya (teacher) of sastravidya, Kshatriya and vaishya should learn from the Acharya, while a shudra could not take a teacher, left to “fight of his own in danger”.|$|E
25|$|English Shepherds {{are often}} larger than Border Collie, but {{the quickest way}} to tell the two apart is to put them on stock. Border Collies tend to herd with a {{distinctive}} strong eye contact and a crouching stance, while English Shepherds have an upright, loose-eyed herding style. English Shepherds can work all types of stock—from <b>the</b> <b>meanest</b> bull to baby chickens. Compared to others, they are prized above specialty herding breeds for being as gentle as possible or as tough as necessary with the stock.|$|E

For example, {{consider}} several lots, each containing several items. The items from each lot are sampled for a measure of some variable and <b>the</b> <b>means</b> of <b>the</b> measurements from each lot are computed. <b>The</b> <b>mean</b> of <b>the</b> measures from each lot constitutes <b>the</b> subsample <b>mean.</b> <b>The</b> <b>mean</b> of these subsample <b>means</b> is then <b>the</b> grand <b>mean.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The non-Newtonian averages (of functions) {{were used}} to {{construct}} a family of means (of two positive numbers).

50|$|Effects coding is {{used when}} {{one does not}} have a {{particular}} comparison or control group and does not have any planned orthogonal contrasts. The intercept is <b>the</b> grand <b>mean</b> (<b>the</b> <b>mean</b> of all <b>the</b> conditions).

500|$|In the 1640s, {{constitutional}} issues arose concerning {{the power of}} the magistrates and assistants. In a case involving an escaped pig, the assistants ruled in favor of a merchant who had allegedly taken a widow's errant animal. She appealed to the general court, which ruled in her favor. The assistants then asserted their right to veto the general court's decision, sparking the controversy. Winthrop argued that the assistants, as experienced magistrates, must be able to check the democratic institution of the general court, because [...] "a democracy is, amongst most civil nations, accounted <b>the</b> <b>meanest</b> and worst of all forms of government." ...|$|E

Among Soviet leaders, the Ukrainian-born Leonid Brezhnev was especially partial to borscht, which his wife continued to personally cook for him even after they had moved into the Kremlin.|$|E

The last character to be cast, initial responses to her were positive, though they soured during season one as the pregnancy storyline continued. Songs performed by Agron as Quinn have been released as singles, available for download, and also feature on the show's soundtrack albums. The role saw Agron nominated for the Teen Choice Award for [...] "Breakout Female Star" [...] in 2009, and a Screen Actors Guild award that same year. She was initially described by Agron as Rachel's enemy, and [...] "terrible, <b>the</b> <b>meanest</b> girl".|$|E
500|$|Many {{people in}} the {{community}} wrote of how much they enjoyed their experience and, in particular, the light-hearted atmosphere. One participant, a man named John Codman, joined the community at the age of 27 in 1843. He wrote, [...] "It was for <b>the</b> <b>meanest</b> a life above humdrum, and for the greatest something far, infinitely far beyond. They looked into the gates of life and saw beyond charming visions, and hopes springing up for all". The idealism of the community sometimes was not met, however. Because the community was officially secular, a variety of religions were represented, though not always amicably. When Isaac Hecker and, later, Sophia Ripley converted to Catholicism, a Protestant Brook Farmer complained, [...] "We are beginning to see wooden crosses around and pictures of saints... and I suspect that rosaries are rattling under aprons." ...|$|E
500|$|Dutch brickmakers {{emigrated to}} New Netherland, where they built kilns for firing bricks locally. In New Amsterdam, brick {{was used for}} the {{director}} general's house, the counting house, the city tavern and other important buildings. Houses were gable-ended, often with stepped designs, and the bricks ranged in color from yellow or red to blue or black. An account of New York published in 1685 said, [...] "The town is broad, built with Dutch brick, consisting of above five hundred houses, <b>the</b> <b>meanest</b> not valued under an hundred pounds." [...] A New Englander who visited New York in 1704, forty years after the Dutch had yielded the town to the British, admired the appearance of the glazed brickwork of the houses of [...] "diverse coullers and laid in Checkers". In 1845 there was still a one-story Dutch brick house built in 1696 in Flatbush, Brooklyn. The date and the owner's initials were formed by blue and red glazed bricks.|$|E

500|$|Anne's gout {{rendered}} her lame {{for much}} of her later life. Around the court, she was carried in a sedan chair, or used a wheelchair. Around her estates, she used a one-horse chaise, which she drove herself [...] "furiously like Jehu and a mighty hunter like Nimrod". She gained weight {{as a result of}} her sedentary lifestyle; in Sarah's words, [...] "she grew exceeding gross and corpulent. There was something of majesty in her look, but mixed with a gloominess of soul". Sir John Clerk, 1st Baronet, described her in 1706 [...] "under a fit of the gout and in extreme pain and agony, and on this occasion everything about her was much in the same disorder as about <b>the</b> <b>meanest</b> of her subjects. Her face, which was red and spotted, was rendered something frightful by her negligent dress, and the foot affected was tied up with a poultice and some nasty bandages. I was much affected by this sight...".|$|E
500|$|The commissioners {{argued that}} {{buildings}} based on Kempthorne's plans would be {{symbolic of the}} recent changes to the provision of poor relief; one assistant commissioner expressed the view {{that they would be}} something [...] "the pauper would feel it was utterly impossible to contend against", and [...] "give confidence to the Poor Law Guardians". [...] Another assistant commissioner claimed the new design was intended as a [...] "terror to the able-bodied population", but the architect George Gilbert Scott was critical of what he called [...] "a set of ready-made designs of <b>the</b> <b>meanest</b> possible character". [...] Some critics of the new Poor Law noted the similarities between Kempthorne's plans and model prisons, and doubted that they were merely coincidental. [...] Augustus Pugin compared Kempthorne's hexagonal plan with the [...] "antient poor hoyse", in what Professor Felix Driver calls a [...] "romantic, conservative critique" [...] of the [...] "degeneration of English moral and aesthetic values".|$|E

500|$|Brook Farm was {{initially}} based {{mostly on the}} ideals of Transcendentalism; its founders believed that by pooling labor they could sustain the community and still have time for literary and scientific pursuits. The experiment meant {{to serve as an}} example {{for the rest of the}} world, established on the principles of [...] "industry without drudgery, and true equality without its vulgarity". Many in the community wrote of how much they enjoyed their experience. One participant, a man named John Codman, joined the community at the age of 27 in 1843. He wrote, [...] "It was for <b>the</b> <b>meanest</b> a life above humdrum, and for the greatest something far, infinitely far beyond. They looked into the gates of life and saw beyond charming visions, and hopes springing up for all". In their free time, the members of Brook Farm enjoyed music, dancing, card games, drama, costume parties, sledding, and skating. Hawthorne, eventually elected treasurer of the community, did not enjoy his experience. He wrote to his wife-to-be Sophia Peabody, [...] "labor is the curse of the world, and nobody can meddle with it without becoming proportionately brutified".|$|E

Immediately {{upon arrival}} in Germany, Brundage became {{headline}} news {{when he and}} the AOC dismissed swimmer Eleanor Holm Jarrett, a gold medalist in 1932 and expected to repeat, for activities on shipboard. Rumors and accounts of the married swimmer's pursuits on board vary, but include statements that she was at an [...] "all-night party" [...] with playwright Charles MacArthur, who was traveling without his wife, actress Helen Hayes. Brundage discussed the matter with fellow AOC members, then met with Jarrett. Although the AOC attempted to send her home, Jarrett, after pleading in vain for reinstatement, remained in Berlin as a journalist, [...] "to the AOC's horror". In later years, she claimed that Brundage had kicked her off the team because he had propositioned her, and she had turned him down. According to Guttmann, [...] "Brundage has appeared, ever since , {{in the guise of}} a killjoy."
