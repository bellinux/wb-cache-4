5|$|Newly {{discovered}} planets, particularly {{ones that}} are potentially habitable, have enabled SETI and METI programs to refocus projects for communication with extraterrestrial intelligence. In 2009 A Message From Earth (AMFE) was sent toward the Gliese 581 planetary system, which contains two potentially habitable planets, the confirmed Gliese 581d and the more habitable but unconfirmed Gliese 581g. In the SETILive project, which began in 2012, human volunteers analyze data from the Allen Telescope Array to search for possible alien signals that computers might miss because of <b>terrestrial</b> <b>radio</b> interference. The data for the study is obtained by observing Kepler target stars with the radio telescope.|$|E
5|$|The show {{features}} Edwards and his co-hosts Keith Alexander, Bill Rolen, Winston Smith, and Eddie Miller, {{as well as}} producer Art Frith. Former staffers include Geoff Melton, Jess Bonds {{and co-founder}} Austin Farley. Its guests have included author Jerome Corsi, Minuteman Project leader Jim Gilchrist, former Constitution Party presidential candidate Michael Peroutka, actor Sonny Landham, British National Party leader Nick Griffin, Vermont secessionist Thomas Naylor, and paleoconservative activist Pat Buchanan. It is carried by at least three licensed <b>terrestrial</b> <b>radio</b> stations in the United States and on network feeds on the Galaxy 19 communications satellite.|$|E
25|$|Satellite radio (also called SDARS by the FCC) uses two {{proprietary}} standards instead of DAB-S, which requires users to change equipment when switching from one provider to the other, and prevents other competitors from offering new choices as stations {{can do on}} <b>terrestrial</b> <b>radio.</b> Had the FCC picked DAB-T for <b>terrestrial</b> <b>radio,</b> no separate satellite receiver would have been needed at all, and the only difference from DAB receivers {{in the rest of}} the world would be the need to tune S band instead of L band.|$|E

25|$|The show's ratings {{started off}} strong on <b>terrestrial</b> <b>radio.</b> In May 2006, Opie and Anthony managed {{to gain a}} 4.2% market share in the 18–34 {{demographic}} in New York City, about one-third of what Stern drew in the same market and demographic prior to his departure for Sirius. In Philadelphia and Boston, the show attracted shares of 7.7% and 6.7% in the same demographic, respectively, although their share of total listening audience was lower. In July 2006, Citadel Broadcasting announced it would simulcast the show on nine <b>terrestrial</b> <b>radio</b> stations nationwide, {{increasing the number of}} affiliates to 20. In September 2006, the number of stations rose to 24.|$|E
25|$|Most commonly, the {{location}} is determined using GPS and the transmission mechanism is SMS, GPRS, or a satellite or <b>terrestrial</b> <b>radio</b> from {{the vehicle to}} a radio receiver. A single antenna unit covering all the needed frequency bands can be employed. GSM and EVDO {{are the most common}} services applied, because of the low data rate needed for AVL, and the low cost and near-ubiquitous nature of these public networks. The low bandwidth requirements also allow for satellite technology to receive telemetry data at a moderately higher cost, but across a global coverage area and into very remote locations not covered well by <b>terrestrial</b> <b>radio</b> or public carriers.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we present {{the concept of}} {{cognitive}} satellite <b>terrestrial</b> <b>radios</b> (CSTR) for hybrid satellite-terrestrial systems (HSTS). The cognitive radio (CR) technology is being motivated by the radio regulatory bodies for efficient utilization of the radio spectrum. The future satellite ground terminals therefore need to integrate and co-exist with the spectrally crowded terrestrial wireless systems and hence we propose the idea of CSTR. The key issues are addressed and the concepts of developing CR based satellite ground terminals in HSTS for dynamic spectrum access on the ground are presented. Furthermore, the concept of 3 D-Spatial reuse of the spectrum is also presented using the CSTR considering low elevated satellite ground stations. Two particular HSTS applications to illustrate the CSTR concept, a) the hybrid satellite-UWB (ultra wideband) communication system for personal area networks (PAN) with short range on ground communications, and b) the hybrid satellite-WRAN (wireless regional area networks) for long range on ground communications are presented. In both the applications the satellite uplink and the <b>terrestrial</b> <b>radios</b> adopt the CR functionalities. The key enabling technologies and their integrated architecture for the CSTR are also presented. © 2010 IEEE...|$|R
25|$|The Howard Stern Show is an American {{talk radio}} show hosted by Howard Stern. It gained wide {{recognition}} {{when it was}} nationally syndicated on <b>terrestrial</b> <b>radio</b> from 1986 to 2005. The show has been exclusive to Sirius XM Radio, a subscription-based satellite radio service, since 2006. Other prominent staff members include co-host and news anchor Robin Quivers, writer Fred Norris, and executive producer Gary Dell'Abate.|$|E
25|$|Other {{options for}} {{determining}} actual location, {{for example in}} environments where GPS illumination is poor, are dead reckoning, i.e. inertial navigation, or active RFID systems or cooperative RTLS systems. These systems may be applied in combination in some cases. In addition, <b>terrestrial</b> <b>radio</b> positioning systems using a low frequency switched packet radio network have also been used {{as an alternative to}} GPS based systems.|$|E
25|$|Since its inception, The Jim Rome Show {{has always}} been offered on <b>terrestrial</b> <b>radio,</b> {{and has not been}} offered on {{satellite}} radio. The show is, however, offered on streaming and podcast through the official web site. On May 6, 2003, Rome made a return to TV with Rome Is Burning (later Jim Rome Is Burning) on ESPN, and occasionally hinted about switching the radio program to satellite, or abandoning the radio program altogether, in favor of television full-time.|$|E

50|$|SNAP {{terminals}} provide reliable {{satellite communication}} access {{and take advantage}} of commercial equipment to expedite the fielding process. They provide access to the tactical and strategic networks for mission command, call for fire, Medevac and information exchange. SNAPs are a key communications component for units, providing secure beyond-line-of-sight communications at the company level and below. SNAPs are designed to provide satellite communications to small units at remote forward operating bases where they are unable to use <b>terrestrial</b> <b>radios</b> due to issues with terrain or distance.|$|R

On July 11, 2006, Rome announced that he signed a multi-year deal with Premiere Radio Networks to keep the show on <b>terrestrial</b> <b>radio.</b> In addition, he stated that the show may be simulcast on satellite radio in the future. Clear Channel provides content exclusively to XM Satellite Radio, including the entire Fox Sports Radio network.|$|E
25|$|When Leykis's show {{went off}} the air in 2009, {{he was in the}} middle of a five-year {{contract}} with CBS.
