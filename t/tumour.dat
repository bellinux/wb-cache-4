5|$|As the {{radiation}} sources can be precisely positioned at the <b>tumour</b> treatment site, brachytherapy enables a high {{dose of radiation}} {{to be applied to}} a small area. Furthermore, because {{the radiation}} sources are placed in or next to the target <b>tumour,</b> the sources maintain their position in relation to the <b>tumour</b> when the patient moves or if there is any movement of the <b>tumour</b> within the body. Therefore, the radiation sources remain accurately targeted. This enables clinicians to achieve a high level of dose conformity – i.e. ensuring the whole of the <b>tumour</b> receives an optimal level of radiation. It also reduces the risk of damage to healthy tissue, organs or structures around the <b>tumour,</b> thus enhancing the chance of cure and preservation of organ function.|$|E

40|$|Testicular <b>tumours</b> in {{dogs are}} of Sertoli cell, Leydig cell or {{germinal}} origin and mixed <b>tumours</b> are also frequently observed. The cellular components of mixed <b>tumours</b> are usually identified by histological examination but sometimes this is difficult. In this study, {{a panel of}} specific antibodies was used to identify the different cell types in testicular <b>tumours</b> by immunohistochemistry. Leydig cells were identified using an antibody against the LH receptor and an antibody against the steroidogenic enzyme 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3 beta-HSD), {{both of which are}} characteristic of Leydig cells in testes. Sertoli cells were identified using an antibody against the intermediate filament vimentin. Seminoma cells did not stain with any of these antibodies. Vimentin was used only in histologically complex cases. Eighty-six <b>tumours,</b> diagnosed histologically as 29 Sertoli cell <b>tumours,</b> 25 Leydig cell <b>tumours,</b> 19 seminomas and 13 mixed <b>tumours,</b> were studied. Feminization was observed in 17 dogs. Leydig cell <b>tumours</b> stained positively with the antibodies against the LH receptor and 3 beta-HSD, whereas seminomas and Sertoli cell <b>tumours</b> were negative (unstained). The antibody against vimentin stained both Sertoli and Leydig cells, and <b>tumours</b> arising from these cells, but not seminomas. Immunohistochemistry revealed that three <b>tumours</b> identified histologically as Sertoli cell <b>tumours</b> were actually Leydig cell <b>tumours.</b> In 14 dogs the histological diagnosis appeared to be incomplete, as mixed <b>tumours</b> instead of pure types of <b>tumours</b> were identified in 11 dogs, and in three dogs mixed <b>tumours</b> appeared to be pure types. Hence, the histological diagnosis was insufficient in approximately 20 % of dogs. Furthermore, immunohistochemical analysis of testis <b>tumours</b> revealed that feminization occurred in dogs with Sertoli cell <b>tumours</b> or Leydig cell <b>tumours</b> and their combinations, but not in dogs with a seminoma. In conclusion, incubation with antibodies against LH receptor and 3 beta-HSD proved to be a consistently reliable method for identification of Leydig cell <b>tumours</b> in dogs. Vimentin can be used to discriminate between Sertoli cell <b>tumours</b> and seminomas. Overall, this panel of antibodies can be very useful for determination of the identity of testicular <b>tumours</b> in which histological characterization is complicated and the pathogenesis of feminization is not clea...|$|R

5|$|To {{accurately}} {{plan the}} brachytherapy procedure, a thorough clinical examination is performed {{to understand the}} characteristics of the <b>tumour.</b> In addition, a range of imaging modalities can be used to visualise the shape and size of the <b>tumour</b> and its relation to surrounding tissues and organs. These include x-ray radiography, ultrasound, computed axial tomography (CT or CAT) scans and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The data from many of these sources can be used to create a 3D visualisation of the <b>tumour</b> and the surrounding tissues.|$|E

5|$|Brachytherapy {{contrasts}} with unsealed source radiotherapy, {{in which a}} therapeutic radionuclide (radioisotope) is injected into the body to chemically localize to the tissue requiring destruction. It also contrasts to EBRT, in which high-energy x-rays (or occasionally gamma-rays from a radioisotope like cobalt-60) are directed at the <b>tumour</b> from outside the body. Brachytherapy instead involves the precise placement of short-range radiation-sources (radioisotopes) directly {{at the site of}} the cancerous <b>tumour.</b> These are enclosed in a protective capsule or wire, which allows the ionizing radiation to escape to treat and kill surrounding tissue but prevents the charge of radioisotope from moving or dissolving in body fluids. The capsule may be removed later, or (with some radioisotopes) it may be allowed to remain in place. A feature of brachytherapy is that the irradiation affects only a very localized area around the radiation sources. Exposure to radiation of healthy tissues farther away from the sources is therefore reduced. In addition, if the patient moves or if there is any movement of the <b>tumour</b> within the body during treatment, the radiation sources retain their correct position in relation to the <b>tumour.</b> These characteristics of brachytherapy provide advantages over EBRT – the <b>tumour</b> can be treated with very high doses of localised radiation whilst reducing the probability of unnecessary damage to surrounding healthy tissues.|$|E

40|$|The {{diagnostic}} and prognostic {{value of the}} DNA ploidy level (nuclear DNA content) was studied {{in a series of}} 847 <b>tumours</b> of the nervous system.

The DNA ploidy level determination was carried out by means of the computer-assisted microscope analysis (digital cell image analysis) of Feulgen-stained nuclei. The results show that the DNA ploidy level does not contribute significant diagnostic information when <b>tumours</b> are analyzed individually. Indeed, some <b>tumours</b> which are definitely benign like certain schwannomas and meningiomas can exhibit very high levels of aneuploidy, while some highly malignant <b>tumours</b> like certain glioblastomas and neuroblastomas can be diploid.
