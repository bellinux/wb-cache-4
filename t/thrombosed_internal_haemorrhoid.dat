40|$|Abstract BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: Symptomatic <b>internal</b> <b>haemorrhoids</b> are a {{very common}} finding used {{to be treated with}} {{conservative}} technique. Among these approaches, rubber band ligation (RBL) and endoscopic injective sclerosis (EIS) can be considered the best conservative outpatient treatments. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare RBL to EIS regarding effectiveness and complications in the treatment of symptomatic <b>internal</b> <b>haemorrhoids.</b> PATIENTS AND METHODS: Seventy-two adult patients with symptomatic <b>internal</b> <b>haemorrhoids</b> were randomised into two equal groups; the first treated with RBL and the second with EIS. All groups were comparable for age, sex, pre-operative symptoms and working activities. Pre and post-procedure data were recorded and analysed. RESULTS: Bleeding was observed in 11...|$|R

40|$|Haemorrhoids {{are one of}} {{the most}} common anal {{disorders}} encountered in primary care. Haemorrhoids are defined as the symptomatic enlargement and distal displacement of the normal anal cushions. 1 These cushions are usually found in three main locations: left lateral, right anterior, and right posterior (3, 7 and 11 o'clock positions). 2 These vascular cushions participate in the drainage of the anal canal. It has also been suggested that these cushions intensify the action of the anal sphincter mechanism, thereby contributing to continence. There are two types of haemorrhoids: internal and external. <b>Internal</b> <b>haemorrhoids</b> arise above the dentate line, are viscerally innervated and therefore painless. External haemorrhoids can be painful because they originate below the dentate line and have a somatic innervation. 3 <b>Internal</b> <b>haemorrhoids</b> are further subdivided according to the degree of prolapsed. peer-reviewe...|$|R

40|$|The varicosities of {{the veins}} of the anal canal {{are known as}} haemorrhoids. Within the normal anal canal there exist specialized, highly vascuiarised cushion forming {{discrete}} masses of thick sub-mucosa containing blood vessels, smooth muscles, elastic and connective tissue. They {{are located in the}} left lateral, right anterior and right posterior quadrants of the anal canal to aid in anal continence. The term haemarrhoids should be restricted to clinical situation in which these cushions are abnormal and when it slides downwards associated with gravity, straining and irregular bowel habits.

40|$|Haemorrhoids is a {{very common}} {{condition}} that a physician would encounter in day to day practice. However, haemorrhoids in children is not as common.

40|$|AbstractAs {{survival}} {{among patients}} with renal failure improves, vascular access becomes more difficult, {{and preservation of}} functioning access increases in importance. Subclavian vein thrombosis associated with a distal arteriovenous fistula can result in massive and debilitating swelling of the affected extremity. We describe a novel crossover bypass grafting procedure to the contralateral internal jugular vein in a patient with a <b>thrombosed</b> <b>internal</b> jugular and subclavian vein. This procedure resulted in preservation of the functioning arteriovenous fistula and resolution of the symptoms. Unlike previously described crossover procedures to the contralateral basilic or axillary veins, this bypass graft has {{the added benefit of}} not obviating future fistula creation in that extremity.

40|$|The role of sigmoidoscopic {{examination}} in the diagnosis, evaluation, {{and treatment}} of minor lower gastrointestinal bleeding was investigated. A hundred patients with minor rectal bleeding were examined by rigid sigmoidoscopy under general anaesthesia between January 1989 and July 1996.   Patients who had bleeding secondary to infections, anal fissure, or haemorrhoids were excluded from study. Patients were reviewed retrospectively according to their diagnosis and endoscopic and histopathological findings. Twenty nine of these patients were girls and 71 boys; their ages ranged between 8 month and 14 years (mean 7. 2 years). Endoscopic pathological findings were established in 60 patients; 32 had rectal polyps, 16 non-specific proctitis, four solitary rectal ulcers, three <b>internal</b> <b>haemorrhoids,</b> two ulcerative colitis, two Hirschsprung's enterocolitis, and one haemangioma.   It is concluded that sigmoidoscopic examination should be performed for the diagnosis, prognosis, and choice of treatment in patients with minor rectal bleeding and the diagnosis should be confirmed histopathologically. ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackgroundHaemorrhoidal {{disease is}} a common disorder. Surgical {{treatment}} is indicated in cases of advanced disease. However, postoperative pain, operative time, and technical difficulties have prompted the search for new procedures and improve the existing ones. A modification is proposed to the technique of PPH (Procedure for Prolapse and Haemorrhoids) stapled haemorrhoidectomy that facilitates and standardises the procedure without altering its benefits. ObjectiveTo describe the postoperative results and short-term evolution of patients with internal haemorrhoidal disease, who underwent stapled mucosectomy with PPH with a modified technique. Materials and methodsThis is a retrospective review of 35 patients who underwent stapled haemorrhoidectomy with a modified technique by the same surgical team. ResultsTwenty-five patients were men (71 %) and 10 women (29 %). Sixteen patients had grade III <b>internal</b> <b>haemorrhoid</b> disease (46 %) and 19 grade IV (54 %). The mean operative time was 31 min. Six patients had acute urinary retention. There were no cases of severe pain, bleeding, haematoma, stenosis, incontinence, thrombosis, or re-operation. The median hospital stay was 1 day. ConclusionsThe proposed modification of PPH haemorrhoidectomy is performed with greater technical ease without increased morbidity, preserving {{the advantages of the}} original technique...|$|R
40|$|There {{has been}} {{periodic}} dispute regarding {{the cause of}} coccydynia and its appropriate treatment. Among the causes that have been proposed are local conditions of the coccyx and sacro-coccygealjoints, median lumbar disc protrusions (Richards 1954) and small tumours of the glomus coccygeus (Klem 1948, Reuther 1938). The patient to be described presents an additional possible cause which merits consideration. A further aspect is that whereas many authors have drawn attention to {{the frequency with which}} cauda equina tumours present with backache and sciatic pain (Toumey, Poppen and Hurley 1950), no reference {{can be found in the}} recent literature to such tumours causing coccygeal pain only. CASE REPORT A European man of thirty-eight had suffered from coccydynia since 1950. Pain was first felt just beyond the tip of the coccyx while he was working under a motor car. Three years later the coccyx was excised in part, with relief of pain for several months. When he was first seen by us in 1954 the sole complaint was that of coccygeal pain. Examination showed a healed and non-tender scar of the previous operation. He also had a small <b>internal</b> <b>haemorrhoid</b> which was treated by injection. Radiographs showed that th...|$|R

40|$|Background and objectives: Rubber band {{ligation}} (BL) is {{the most}} widely used technique for treatment of symptomatic <b>internal</b> <b>haemorrhoids</b> (IH) that are refractory to conservative treatment. The aim {{of this study is to}} assess the efficacy of colonoscopic BL as therapy for symptomatic IH. Methods: Patients seen at our center with symptomatic IH who underwent BL between January 2006 and December 2011 were included in this prospective study. The clinical and colonoscopic details were entered in uniform structured data forms. Results: Two hundred and eighteen consecutive patients with symptomatic IH were enrolled in the study. The presentations were rectal bleeding in 150 (69 %) and prolapse in remaining 68 (31 %) patients. Twenty-four patients (11 %) had chronic liver disease (child B-C). Same operator treated all the patients. The severity of the IH was classified by using Goligher grading system. The mean age of patients was 48. 3 + 15 years with range of 22 - 85 years. The mean follow up was 3 months (range 1 month - 36 months). In 209 patients (96 %) there was at least 1 grade reduction in hemorrhoids as well the symptoms were controlled. Two patients required surgery and another 7 patients required repeat session of banding. After banding session 32 (15 %) patients had perianal pain and 13 (6 %) had mild bleeding. Conclusions: Colonoscopic BL is a safe, and effective outpatient therapeutic procedure for symptomatic internal hemorrhoids. Furthermore, the BL is safe and effective in patients of coagulopathy associated with chronic liver disease...|$|R

40|$|Lemierre's {{syndrome}} is an anaerobic sepsis occurring after oropharyngeal infection in healthy teenagers and young adults. We report two cases of adolescent girls suffering from Lemierre's syndrome studied with cervical color Doppler ultrasonography (CDUS), cervicothoracic helical CT, and high-resolution CT (HRCT) scanning. In both patients, HRCT allowed a good depiction of multiple cavitated pulmonary nodules {{of various sizes}} suggestive of this entity {{and was able to}} detect small or peripheral nodules. CDUS helped to pinpoint the extent of <b>thromboses</b> of the <b>internal</b> jugular vein demonstrated by CT.

40|$|PURPOSE: The {{differentiation}} between tumor and bland thromboses is {{important as the}} management differs. Retrospectively, we aim to evaluate the utility of FDG PET in detecting and differentiating tumor from bland thromboses and if FDG PET provides additional value to contrast-enhanced CT for tumor thrombus detection. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-four sites of venous thromboembolism, detected on PET/CT, were retrospectively reviewed. Classification of type of thrombosis was based on histology and radiological follow-up. We evaluated the presence of contrast-enhanced CT findings that were suggestive of tumor thrombosis; sign of invasion, neovascularity, and enhancement. Metabolic activity by means of SUV(max) was measured by drawing ROI {{at the site of}} thrombosis. Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare the mean SUV(max) between <b>thromboses</b> and <b>internal</b> references. We used ROC analysis to identify the optimal cutoff value of SUV(max) for detection of tumor thrombosis. RESULTS: Twenty-four sites of venous thromboembolism were identified in 15 patients. All tumor thromboses demonstrated at least 1 positive sign on contrast-enhanced CT, whereas 33 % of bland thromboses had the same finding. The difference between tumor and bland thrombus SUV(max) was statistically significant (P < 0. 005). On ROC analysis, a cutoff of SUV(max) 2. 25 (sensitivity, 78 %; specificity, 100 %) was suggested to differentiate tumor from bland thrombosis. CONCLUSION: PET/CT is able to differentiate tumor from bland thrombosis, with an optimal cutoff value of SUV(max) 2. 25. The metabolic information increases the diagnostic accuracy of tumor thrombus and is a useful adjunct to the described features on contrast-enhanced CT. postprin...|$|R
40|$|Objective:To {{investigate}} whether heparin reversal after carotid endarterectomy reduces {{the incidence of}} haemorrhagic complications. Design:A randomised prospective trial. Methods:Sixty-four patients randomised to reversal of heparin or no reversal, of whom 31 received protamine titrated to the residual circulating heparin at closure of arteriotomy. Measurements included serial activated clotting times (ACTs), wound drainage, neck swelling using duplex Doppler imaging to measure the depth from skin to carotid bifurcation, and the recording of all complications. Results:Wound drainage volumes were significantly reduced by protamine reversal (68. 5 ml compared to 35 ml, p< 0. 001), but neck swelling was not (72 mm compared to 70 mm, p= 0. 77). Two patients who were not reversed developed neck haematomas requiring evacuation. More importantly, two patients receiving protamine, <b>thrombosed</b> the operated <b>internal</b> carotid artery (ICA) postoperatively and died despite urgent thrombectomy. A further patient who was not randomised in this study but who received protamine also developed ICA thrombosis within the same 3 month period. Conclusions:Reversing heparin with protamine reduces postoperative wound drainage after carotid surgery but may predispose to ICA thrombosis and stroke. This {{is in keeping with}} a previous retrospective study published during our trial. ...|$|R
