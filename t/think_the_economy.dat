40|$|Political trust {{has never}} {{returned}} to Great Society era levels. Conventional wisdom suggests that chronically poor performance explains why. Over the last twenty five years, however, performance has often been at least very good. We show that one key to understanding the persistence of lower levels of political trust is that Americans have become more apt to use less favorable criteria when asked to evaluate government. When more people identify international problems as most important, trust increases. Hence the steep decline in concern about international issues after the 1960 s has set a lower baseline than before. In addition, we show {{that the effect of}} economic performance on political trust is asymmetric. Since fewer people <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> is important during good times than bad, even the often strong economies of the past thirty years increased trust less than the poor economies diminished it.

40|$|In {{this paper}} (which {{summarizes}} {{a book in}} progress), I argue that the failure of conventional economics to incorporate the theory of innovative enterprise into its analysis of the operation and performance of <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> has profound consequences that go far beyond {{the ways in which}} academic economists <b>think</b> about <b>the</b> <b>economy.</b> Sociologists and political scientists are constantly making arguments about society and politics that are influenced by their understanding of economics.

Meanwhile, every year, members of the economics profession teach millions of college students who represent the (supposedly) informed citizens of the next generation that an un-innovative state of economic affairs, known quite ludicrously as “perfect ” competition, is {{the best of all possible}} worlds. The result is the perpetuation of a body of thought that is not only hazardous to our mental health but also dangerous to our material wealth.

40|$|When it {{is spoken}} about the {{economic}} i. e. business cycles that could be met meet in the macroeconomics literature, then we <b>think</b> about <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> in <b>the</b> short run, i. e. economic fluctuations. Modern economies are subject to significant short-run variations in aggregate output and employment, so such fluctuations are periodic problem for economists and politicians. The understanding {{of the causes of}} aggregate fluctuations is the main goal of macroeconomics. From economic theory it is known that the macroeconomic variables move simultaneously. This means, if the real GDP increases (expansion) in <b>the</b> national <b>economy,</b> then in <b>the</b> same time increases the employment, investment, standard of living. But if the real GDP declines (recession), then in the same time reduces the employment, investment, standard of living.

Regarding economic policy, the analysis of economics stability has taken more relevance {{in the aftermath of the}} recent financial crisis. The crisis highlighted <b>the</b> need to <b>think</b> of <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> as a complex network where an idiosyncratic shock may precede aggregate consequences, such as the recent problem in arising from the financial sector and its effect on <b>the</b> <b>economy.</b> Chapter 1 introduces a two-period multi-sector economy with Input-Output linkages and a banking sector. This model is useful to assess the relevance of the economic structure on aggregate volatility. The main finding is that single financial shocks to banks do not average out and could lead to aggregate fluctuations. In particular, aggregate volatility does not go in a single direction when we increase the number of links bank-to-sector (concentration), enhance the number of links shared by two or more banks (integration) or redistribute the links (diversification). In Chapter 2, I use a detailed benchmark data of the U. K. input-output accounts spanning from 1997 to 2010, I apply the model of intersectoral linkages by Acemoglu et al.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{proposes a}} tâtonnement story for Walrasian systems that {{explains}} price determination in perfectly competitive markets {{with respect to}} the behavior of individual agents whose objective is improvement in their levels of utility. Agent-level, price-adjustment rules consistent with the story lead to uniqueness and global stability of competitive equilibria under well-known, but highly restrictive, conditions. In spite of the latter restrictiveness, it is argued that this is still sufficient to establish the usefulness and explanatory viability of the Walrasian system, as well as its consistency with methodological individualism. Key Words: Methodological individualism; Walrasian systems; the Walrasian tâtonnement. The Walrasian model articulates a vision that underlies the way in which many of today’s economists <b>think</b> about <b>the</b> <b>economy.</b> In one of its more common forms, the fully developed Walrasian or general-equilibrium model consists of a dynamic mathematical system whose equations characterize, at each moment, the behavior of consumers, the behavior of firms, and the operation of markets. Consumer and firm behaviors emerge from, respectively, utility maximization subject to budget constraints, and profit maximization subject to technological production possibilities. For each vector of equilibrium and nonequilibrium price values announced by an auctioneer, the unique solutions of the relevant demand-side and supply-side equations of the model at a moment on the model’s time-clock (assuming such solutions exist) represent the result of the simultaneous interaction o...|$|R
