5|$|Twenty-one {{species from}} several orders of slime molds (myxomycetes) have been {{isolated}} from <b>the</b> <b>bark</b> of Banksia menziesii. Over half (13) {{were from the}} order Stemonitales, and Echinosteliales and Liceales were also common. The abundance {{of the first two}} orders {{may be due to the}} acidity of <b>the</b> <b>bark.</b> Another order, the Physarales, was unusually rare—other studies have demonstrated that the order is typically abundant on <b>the</b> <b>bark</b> of various species of tree around the world.|$|E
5|$|At least 120 drugs {{come from}} plant sources, {{many of them}} from <b>the</b> <b>bark</b> of trees. Quinine {{originates}} from the cinchona tree (Cinchona) and {{was for a long}} time the remedy of choice for the treatment of malaria. Aspirin was synthesised to replace the sodium salicylate derived from <b>the</b> <b>bark</b> of willow trees (Salix) which had unpleasant side effects. The anti-cancer drug Paclitaxel is derived from taxol, a substance found in <b>the</b> <b>bark</b> of the Pacific yew (Taxus brevifolia). Other tree based drugs come from the paw-paw (Carica papaya), the cassia (Cassia spp.), the cocoa tree (Theobroma cacao), the tree of life (Camptotheca acuminata) and the downy birch (Betula pubescens).|$|E

5|$|In {{the case}} of {{angiosperms}} and gymnosperms, the outermost layer of the trunk is <b>the</b> <b>bark</b> and is mostly composed of dead cells. It provides a thick, waterproof covering to the living inner tissue. It protects the trunk against the elements, disease, animal attack and fire. It is perforated by {{a large number of}} fine breathing pores called lenticels, through which oxygen diffuses. Bark is continually replaced by a living layer of cells called the cork cambium. The London plane (Platanus × acerifolia) periodically sheds its bark in large flakes. Similarly, <b>the</b> <b>bark</b> of the silver birch (Betula pendula) peels off in strips. As the tree's girth expands, newer layers of bark are larger in circumference, and the older layers develop fissures in many species. In some trees such as the pine (Pinus species) <b>the</b> <b>bark</b> exudes sticky resin which deters attackers whereas in rubber trees (Hevea brasiliensis) it is a milky latex that oozes out. The quinine bark tree (Cinchona officinalis) contains bitter substances to make <b>the</b> <b>bark</b> unpalatable. Large tree-like plants with lignified trunks in the Pteridophyta, Arecales, Cycadophyta and Poales such as the tree ferns, palms, cycads and bamboos have no true bark, but they do have an outer protective covering of some form.|$|E

50|$|Male Australian {{sea lions}} were {{observed}} producing three different call types: a barking call, a bleating call and a female-like call. The predominant call type produced by males {{of all ages}} was <b>the</b> <b>barking</b> call. <b>The</b> <b>barking</b> call of Australian sea lions was similar in structure to <b>the</b> <b>barking</b> calls described in some other species of otariid {{in that it was}} a short sound produced repetitively in a series. Mature Australian sea lion males were found to emit <b>the</b> <b>barking</b> call in almost all social interactions, despite the existence of at least three call types in their vocal repertoire, plus a guttural threat and growl.|$|R

5|$|French chemist Pierre Joseph Pelletier and French {{pharmacist}} Joseph Bienaimé Caventou {{separated in}} 1820 the alkaloids cinchonine and quinine from powdered fever tree bark, {{allowing for the}} creation of standardized doses of the active ingredients. Prior to 1820, <b>the</b> <b>bark</b> was simply dried, ground to a fine powder and mixed into a liquid (commonly wine) for drinking.|$|E
5|$|Kauri gum {{formed when}} resin from kauri trees leaked out through {{fractures}} or cracks in <b>the</b> <b>bark,</b> hardening with {{the exposure to}} air.

Other lumps formed as branches forked or trees were damaged, which released the resin.|$|E

25|$|Anglo-Chinese School (Primary) is the {{original}} primary school of the ACS family, located at <b>the</b> <b>Barker</b> Road campus adjacent to <b>the</b> ACS (<b>Barker</b> Road) block. It opened in 1887 with the secondary school at Coleman Street, {{and moved to a}} newly upgraded Coleman Street campus in 1961, leaving <b>the</b> <b>Barker</b> Road campus to be used for secondary and pre-university classes. At the end of 1984, the junior school moved to 25 Peck Hay Road, while the primary school continued lessons at Canning Rise until 1994. It merged with <b>the</b> <b>Barker</b> Road school in that year, but in December 1998 relocated temporarily to 9 Ah Hood Road while waiting for the completion of <b>the</b> <b>Barker</b> Road campus rebuilding project. The school moved back to Barker Road on 4 December 2002.|$|R
5|$|The press {{surrounding}} <b>the</b> <b>Barker</b> case led to {{the first}} calls about the Boy in the Box. Frank Guthrum, who discovered the boy, {{had decided not to}} call the police until he listened to reports of <b>the</b> <b>Barker</b> case on his car radio.|$|R
5|$|On September17, a {{hurricane}} {{was observed in}} the mid-Atlantic by <b>the</b> <b>bark</b> Phantom. Later that day, the Phantom sank, though all of the crew survived. They described {{the system as a}} 'perfect hurricane' with a lull around midnight on September17 before the wind changed direction and blew with even greater force than before. The hurricane continued travelling on a northwest track and between September22 and the night of September23 it was encountered by the Hudson, the City of Washington and <b>the</b> <b>bark</b> Lanark. The system weakened to a tropical storm early on September24 and dissipated later that day about 610mi (980km) east of Cape Race, Newfoundland. Until reanalysis, this storm was considered two separate systems, including in the 1995 study by Partagas and Diaz. However, they stated that further information could indicate a single storm.|$|E
5|$|The Eurasian {{treecreeper}} is insectivorous {{and climbs}} up tree trunks like a mouse, {{to search for}} insects which it picks from crevices in <b>the</b> <b>bark</b> with its fine curved bill. It then flies {{to the base of}} another tree with a distinctive erratic flight. This bird is solitary in winter, but may form communal roosts in cold weather.|$|E

On 4December 2002, the two schools, ACS Oldham Hall, the Methodist Church in Singapore and <b>the</b> <b>Barker</b> Road Methodist Church moved back to the newly built campus at <b>Barker</b> Road. <b>The</b> Deputy Prime Minister of Singapore, Dr. Tony Tan, opened the new school on July 15, 2003.|$|R

5|$|The tree {{may also}} be {{attacked}} by the horse chestnut scale insect (Pulvinaria regalis) which sucks sap from the trunk and branches, but does not cause serious damage to the tree. Sometimes squirrels will strip <b>the</b> <b>bark</b> off branches, girdling the stem; as a result whole branches may die, leaving brown, wilted leaves.|$|E
5|$|This {{storm is}} known {{from a single}} ship report.

5|$|With the {{exception}} of A.laevigatum, all species have a thin separating layer, the cortex, between the hymenium and the tomentum.

As this cortex is missing on A.laevigatum, its fruit body lies flat on <b>the</b> <b>bark.</b>|$|E

5|$|In {{some species}} of cicada, the males remain in one {{location}} and call to attract females. Sometimes several males aggregate and call in chorus. In other species, the males move {{from place to}} place, usually with quieter calls while searching for females. The Tettigarctidae differ from other cicadas in producing vibrations in the substrate rather than audible sounds. After mating, the female cuts slits into <b>the</b> <b>bark</b> of a twig where she deposits her eggs.|$|E
5|$|Insects, {{including}} beetles, moths, wasps and flies, use <b>the</b> <b>bark,</b> {{leaves and}} flowers {{of the tree}} in various ways. Some feed or hide camouflaged in the skirt of dead leaves, a favourite dry place for weta to hide in winter. Many of the insect companions of C.australis have followed it into the domesticated surroundings of parks and home gardens. If the leaves are left to decay, the soil underneath cabbage trees becomes a black humus that supports a rich array of amphipods, earthworms and millipedes.|$|E
