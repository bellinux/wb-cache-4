5|$|A {{tropical}} depression first formed on August20 {{in the central}} Caribbean Sea from a broad area of low pressure, based on weather reports from weather stations and ships in the vicinity. Moving steadily to the west-northwest towards the western Caribbean, the disturbance slowly intensified, attaining tropical storm strength by 1200UTC the next day. Prior to the Atlantic hurricane reanalysis project, however, the system was analyzed to be an open trough up until August22. The tropical storm began to move more towards <b>the</b> <b>west</b> <b>in</b> the Gulf of Mexico after clipping the Guanahacabibes Peninsula—the westernmost region of Cuba—late on August22.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{emerged from}} the African coast late on July 10. The wave entered the Bahamas on July 21 and organized into Tropical Depression Six while 70miles (110km) east of Eleuthera. Initially the storm was predicted to execute a clockwise loop and drift to <b>the</b> <b>west</b> <b>in</b> response to a high pressure system. Several models indicated {{the possibility of the}} storm to drift westward into central Florida. Soon after the depression formed, it strengthened into Tropical Storm Franklin.|$|E
5|$|According to the {{historian}} A.D. Lee, {{there is little}} evidence to support this view and compelling reasons to reject it. Firstly, the late army clearly was not, and did not become, ineffective. The regular army in the West remained a formidable force until the political disintegration of <b>the</b> <b>West</b> <b>in</b> mid-5th century and continued to win most of its major encounters with barbarian forces e.g. the defeat of Radagaisus in 405. In any case, the Eastern empire did not collapse, even though its army probably contained at least the same proportion of barbarians as the West, if not greater. An analysis of the ethnicity of Roman army officers named in the sources shows that in the period 350–99, 23% were probably barbarian-born. The same figure for period 449–76 officers, virtually all Easterners (as the Western army had largely dissolved) was 31%. In the Notitia, 55 Eastern regiments carry barbarian names, compared with 25 in the Western army.|$|E

5|$|After {{becoming}} a tropical storm, Edouard quickly strengthened {{due to the}} establishment of an upper-level anticyclone over the storm. The storm moved to <b>the</b> <b>west</b> <b>in</b> response to a strong subtropical ridge to its north, and Edouard strengthened into a hurricane on August 23. Due to very favorable conditions, the hurricane rapidly strengthened on August 24 and August 25 to peak as a 145mph (230km/h) Category4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Scale. A weakness in the subtropical ridge allowed for a motion more to the west-northwest, and the hurricane passed about 250mi (400km) north of the Lesser Antilles on August 28. For three days during this time, Edouard maintained Category4 intensity, though weakened late on August 28 due to an eyewall replacement cycle and vertical shear.|$|E
5|$|Afternoon is a {{time when}} the sun is {{descending}} from its daytime peak. During the afternoon, the sun moves from roughly the center of the sky to deep in <b>the</b> <b>west.</b> <b>In</b> late afternoon, sunlight is particularly bright and glaring, because the sun is at a low angle in the sky. The standard working time in most industrialized countries goes from the morning to the late afternoon or evening—archetypally, 9 am to 5 pm—so the latter part of this time takes place in the afternoon. Schools usually let out during the afternoon as well.|$|E
5|$|Akhmatova {{was widely}} honoured in the USSR and <b>the</b> <b>West.</b> <b>In</b> 1962 she was visited by Robert Frost; Isaiah Berlin tried {{to visit her}} again, but she refused him, worried that her son might be re-arrested due to family {{association}} with the ideologically suspect western philosopher. She inspired and advised a large circle of key young Soviet writers. Her dacha in Komarovo was frequented by such poets as Yevgeny Rein and Joseph Brodsky, whom she mentored.
