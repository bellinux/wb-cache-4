He received the Medal of Honor, the U.S. military's highest award for valor, along with 32 additional U.S. medals. He served with CompanyB, 1stBattalion, 15th Infantry Regiment, 3rd Infantry Division. Major General John P. Lucas {{is reported to have}} once visited the set of one of Murphy's films and, while he greeted actors and crew, was forced to salute Murphy – Murphy had the Medal of Honor and Lucas did not – and then had his handshake refused by Murphy, who instead returned the salute and then simply walked away. [...] Murphy later commented that [...] "...too damn many good men died at Anzio and Nettuno because of <b>that</b> <b>son</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>bitch.</b> I'm damned if I'll shake hands with him." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{election}} of Marxist candidate Salvador Allende as President of Chile in September 1970 led Nixon to order that Allende {{not be allowed}} to take office. Edward Korry, US Ambassador to Chile, told Nixon that he saw no alternative to Allende. According to the ambassador, Nixon said, [...] "That son of a bitch, that son a bitch...Not you, Mr. Ambassador. It's <b>that</b> <b>son</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>bitch</b> Allende. We're going to smash him." [...] Nixon pursued a vigorous campaign of covert resistance to Allende, intended to first prevent Allende from taking office, called Track I, and then when that failed, to provide a [...] "military solution", called Track II. As part of Track II, CIA operatives approached senior Chilean military leaders, using false flag operatives, and encouraged a coup d'état, providing both finances ($50,000) and weapons (submachine guns). With US encouragement, coup plotters first assassinated Army leader, General René Schneider, as he opposed military interference in the political process.|$|E
2500|$|Pierpont {{writes that}} John Garfield was first {{choice for the}} role, but [...] "made {{impossible}} demands." [...] It was Kazan's decision {{to fall back on}} the far less experienced (and technically too young for the role) Brando. In a letter dated August 29, 1947, Williams confided to his agent Audrey Wood: [...] "It had not occurred to me before what an excellent value would come through casting a very young actor in this part. It humanizes the character of Stanley in that it becomes the brutality and callousness of youth rather than a vicious old man... A new value came out of Brando's reading which was by far the best reading I have ever heard." [...] Brando based his portrayal of Kowalski on the boxer Rocky Graziano, whom he had studied at a local gymnasium. Graziano did not know who Brando was, but attended the production with tickets provided by the young man. He said, [...] "The curtain went up and on the stage is <b>that</b> <b>son</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>bitch</b> from the gym, and he's playing me." ...|$|E

5000|$|Carrizo {{was named}} President of the Society of Argentine Bibliophiles, {{and of the}} Argentine Chess Federation. [...] The {{accomplished}} chess player counted among his friends Grand Master Bobby Fischer. Fischer visited Argentina often, and Carrizo's home hosted numerous matches between the two, {{as well as with}} other noted players such as Tigran Petrosian and Miguel Quinteros; during one such match, which Fischer and Quinteros played for money, the unpredictable Fischer repeatedly slammed the Japanese forest glass coffee table, prompting Carrizo to urge Quinteros to lower the stakes, [...] "lest <b>that</b> <b>son</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>bitch</b> break my table!" ...|$|E
5000|$|Moreover, {{the mixing}} of the album in mono was the chief {{priority}} of Dylan and his producers. Stereo was almost an afterthought. Producer Steve Berkowitz, who supervised the reissue of The Original Mono Recordings was told by Bob Johnston about {{the mixing of}} Blonde on Blonde: [...] "We mixed that mono probably {{for three or four}} days, then I said, 'Oh shit, man, we gotta do stereo.' So me and a coupla guys put our hands on the board, we mixed <b>that</b> <b>son</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>bitch</b> in about four hours!... So my point is, {{it took a long time}} to do the mono, and then it was, 'Oh, yeah, we gotta do stereo'." ...|$|E

Anyway, the day I brought Kazan, Father John was yelling, 'I'm going to stop Spellman.' He was cursing—'McCormack, <b>that</b> <b>son</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> bitch'—and shouting.".|$|R

50|$|Tromp was a vain man, {{having an}} {{extremely}} high opinion of himself, {{which he never}} hesitated in sharing with others. He felt <b>that,</b> <b>son</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> famous father, he had a natural right {{to the position of}} naval hero. During his life he posed as a sitter for at least 22 paintings, a record for the 17th century, many by top artists such as Ferdinand Bol.

Also featured is a German Ace, that the player first encounters during the Battle of Britain, throwing insults at the squadron. He appears again in the final mission of the game, 1945 Berlin leading the Nowotny Squadron also known as Jagdgeschwader 7, a squadron of elite German aces flying the experimental jet planes Germany was trying to create. He is identified when he proclaims, [...] "I hear the famous Angels of Dunkirk are here, lets introduce them to the Devils of Berlin," [...] to which Frank, surprised, responds with, [...] "It's <b>that</b> <b>son</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>bitch</b> from London!"

2500|$|Early in his run, Backlund and Peter Maivia {{formed a}} {{successful}} tag team and challenged for the WWWF World Tag Team Championship, then held by The Yukon Lumberjacks.

At the end of the evening, the final vignette depicted Austin breaking into Pillman's home, prompting Pillman to pull a gun on Austin, and the feed being [...] "interrupted" [...] in the ensuing chaos, with Vince McMahon (serving as a commentator) stating that he had been informed of [...] "a couple explosions".

5000|$|Crawford's heavy {{drinking}} increased {{during the filming}} of Highway Patrol, eventually resulting in several arrests and stops for {{driving under the influence}} of alcohol (DUI), which eventually gained him a suspended driving license. [...] While representing the California Highway Patrol as [...] "Chief Mathews", Crawford was known with considerable embarrassment by the CHP as [...] "Old 502" [...] due to his habit of driving {{under the influence of alcohol}} ("Code 502" [...] was the CHP police radio code for drunken driving). According to the show's creator, Guy Daniels, [...] "We got all the dialogue in by noon, or else we wouldn't get it done at all. He Crawford would bribe people to bring him booze on the set." [...] The show used their CHP technical advisor, Officer Frank Runyon, to keep the actor sober: [...] "I was told to keep <b>that</b> <b>son</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>bitch</b> away from a bottle. I think his license was suspended. Some scenes had to be shot on private roads so that Brod could drive." [...] Eventually the drinking strained the show's relationship with the CHP as well as Crawford's relationship with ZIV.|$|E
5000|$|Miller also records how [...] "a {{strong sense}} of community" [...] {{including}} ritual peyote use led {{to a variety of}} social experiments being conducted including the abolishing of private property and also the institution of a rule to prevent [...] "coupling," [...] which banned anyone from sleeping with the same partner for more than two consecutive nights, although this had disastrous consequences after a venereal disease spread amongst the community. Despite the ban on coupling (considered [...] "bourgoise decadence"), traditional feelings of resentment came back when they tried to work out who had slept with whom in order to treat the disease: We made up a chart with who slept with who, just go down and put a little [...] "X" [...] on it, {{and it turned out that}} I think we had to treat everybody. But the funny thing was, people would look at the chart and say [...] "Joe, you bastard, you cheated on me with that bitch?"

5000|$|In the 1989 Holly Farms 400, Dale Earnhardt {{entered the}} race only 35 points behind Rusty Wallace for the NASCAR Cup Series {{championship}} with four races left. The race was originally scheduled for October 1, but rain caused a two-week postponement. Earnhardt got the pole position because inclement weather had washed out the qualifying runs. This {{is the only}} Cup race at North Wilkesboro to start without qualifiers. Earnhardt dominated the race, leading 343 laps. On the final restart on Lap 398, Earnhardt led Ricky Rudd, Geoff Bodine, Terry Labonte, and Mark Martin. Rudd was in pursuit of Earnhardt on the last lap going into the first turn. He went low, and Earnhardt tried to keep a tight line through the corner to hold the lead. They made contact and both cars went spinning, as Geoff Bodine went around to gap the win by leading only the last lap in the race. The last-lap contact also produced {{some of the most}} memorable broadcasting quotes in NASCAR history. After the race, Dick Berggren askedEarnhardt, [...] "How will this affect your championship? You've got three more to go." [...] Earnhardt responded, [...] "What do ya think? They oughta fine <b>that</b> <b>son</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>bitch</b> and make him sit {{out the rest of the}} year, I dunno."

5000|$|Milius {{later said}} he did not like the film and wished Don Siegel had {{directed}} it, as originally intended:Of all the films I had anything to do with, I like it least. They changed {{a lot of things in}} a cheap and distasteful manner. The whole ending is wrong, it wasn't mine at all. All movies had a motorcycle or car chase at the time — except Westerns. They have a scene where this black girl's pimp forces Drano down her throat. In the script, they merely went into the morgue and Harry said, [...] "I don't feel bad for <b>that</b> <b>son</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>bitch,</b> 'cause two weeks ago one of his girls was in here and he'd poured Drano down her throat." [...] I think it's better to hear about it than to see it later; also, it goes right back to the character again: you understand Harry's feelings about it. All the stuff they put in about the Japanese girl: they put in a scene where the star gets to fuck some girl, and it's pretty hard to get it out. My Dirty Harry scripts never had Harry knowing any girls too well other than hookers, because he was a lonely guy who lived alone and didn't like to associate with people. He could never be close enough to a woman to have any sort of affair. A bitter, lonely man who liked his work ...|$|E
