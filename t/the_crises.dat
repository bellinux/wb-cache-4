5|$|Following {{the rapid}} {{expansion}} {{that had been}} required to provide effective coverage in response to <b>the</b> <b>crises</b> caused by the initial Japanese movements {{a review of the}} makeshift organisation was undertaken. In October 1942, the NGAWW Company was officially formed as part of New Guinea Force Signals to consolidate the Army, RAAF and Coastwatcher stations. Meanwhile, efforts were made to standardise equipment across the network and to implement common procedures. The company subsequently came under command of New Guinea Force Signals and its headquarters was established at 9-mile near Port Moresby. Captain Thomas Warren was in command of the company at this time. The establishment of the company at this time included a headquarters, a Moresby area section, a sub-area section, and a spotting station. Sub-area sections were raised as required and at various times were located at Milne Bay, Dobodura, Wau, Bena Bena, Bulolo, Nadzab, Gusap, Hollandia and Aitape. By the end of 1942 the company was maintaining 61 operational stations and had a strength of 180 men. In mid-1943, Warren was transferred to Milne Force and he handed over command temporarily to Captain Gordon King.|$|E

40|$|European {{financial}} crisis poses {{a serious challenge}} to the fundamental structure of the European Union, political and financial institutions, {{as well as the}} values that bind European together. Different factors have been suggested as the causes of <b>the</b> <b>crisis</b> notably <b>the</b> failure of national government and economic policies. Responding to <b>the</b> <b>crisis,</b> numerous attemps have been proposed to accelerate the recovery, but <b>the</b> <b>crisis</b> still hit Eurozone and brought serious consequences politically and economically. In one side, <b>the</b> <b>crisis</b> severely damages some EU member economy but on the other side, <b>the</b> <b>crisis</b> advantages <b>the</b> other members. Such an inequality not only leads to <b>the</b> <b>crisis</b> but also exacerbate <b>the</b> <b>crisis.</b> Having said that, this paper will demonstrate that marxian conceptual model of inequality or constructed economic imbalance provides a better explanation regarding the causes of <b>the</b> <b>crisis.</b> Using marxist theoretical framework, this article will further show that introduction of Euro, the accumulation of profit and capital as well as the current European financial system built upon the spirit of capitalism and neoliberalism as the key factors contributing to <b>the</b> <b>crisis</b> and creating inequality...|$|R
25|$|Following the Keynesian {{consensus}} (that {{lasted until}} the 1970s) the traditional {{view was that}} federal deficit spending associated with the war brought full-employment output while monetary policy was just aiding the process.

25|$|During his presidency, and {{continuing}} {{to a lesser extent}} today, there has been much criticism of Roosevelt, some of it intense.

25|$|Added to this, <b>the</b> <b>crises</b> of the Catholic church (especially the {{controversy}} over the French Avignon Papacy and the Great Schism) along with the catastrophic effects of the Black Death were to lead to a re-evaluation of medieval values, resultant {{in the development of a}} humanist culture, stimulated by the works of Petrarch and Boccaccio. This prompted a revisitation and study of the classical antiquity, leading to the Renaissance.|$|E

40|$|How have governments, {{politics}} and administrations responded to <b>the</b> fiscal <b>crisis?</b> In this brief article, a first preliminary analysis is made how Great Britain, Germany and The Netherlands managed <b>the</b> <b>crisis.</b> <b>The</b> <b>crisis</b> {{consisted of three}} stages: First, <b>the</b> financial <b>crisis</b> causing governments to save and support banks; second, <b>the</b> economic <b>crisis,</b> causing governments to take economic recovery measures and third, <b>the</b> fiscal <b>crisis</b> of state debts and budget deficits, causing governments to take fiscal cut-back measures.

40|$|We {{examine the}} {{reaction}} of world equity markets to <b>the</b> 1997 Asian <b>Crisis.</b> Correlations across <b>the</b> markets increased dramatically during <b>the</b> economic <b>crisis</b> but only during {{a relatively short period}} around <b>the</b> <b>crisis.</b> After <b>the</b> <b>crisis,</b> <b>the</b> benefits of international diversification improved substantially but did not return to the levels existing before <b>the</b> <b>crisis.</b> We then examine whether the market reactions to <b>the</b> <b>crisis</b> can be explained by economic fundamentals. We find that virtually all of the variation in returns across markets can be explained by these factors. The reaction of markets to <b>the</b> Asian <b>Crisis</b> was rational. © 2009 Elsevier B. V.

25|$|Worldwide, the Great Depression had {{the most}} {{profound}} impact in the German Reich and the United States. In both countries the pressure to reform {{and the perception of}} the economic crisis were strikingly similar. When Hitler came to power he was faced with exactly the same task that faced Roosevelt, overcoming mass unemployment and the global Depression. The political responses to <b>the</b> <b>crises</b> were essentially different: while American democracy remained strong, Germany replaced democracy with fascism, a Nazi dictatorship.|$|E
25|$|The {{frequency}} of crises was especially high for developing economies {{in this era}} – from 1973 to 1997 emerging economies suffered 57 BoP crises and 21 twin crises. Typically but not always the panic among foreign creditors and investors that preceded <b>the</b> <b>crises</b> in this period was usually triggered by concerns over excess borrowing by the private sector, rather than by a government deficit. For advanced economies, there were 30 BoP crises and 6 banking crises.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{whether the}} documented analyst optimism has decreased after <b>the</b> financial <b>crisis</b> of 2008. Prior research reports overestimation bias on average in analysts' earnings forecasts. After <b>the</b> financial <b>crisis,</b> <b>the</b> U. S. financial industry has undergone changes {{that could affect}} analysts' incentives to bias their earnings forecasts. Furthermore, recent studies propose {{that there is a}} demand for more conservative sell-side analysis, which could be exaggerated after <b>the</b> <b>crisis.</b> First, I examine the proportion of optimistic earnings forecasts of all forecasts before <b>the</b> financial <b>crisis</b> and after <b>the</b> <b>crisis.</b> Second, I conduct a regression analysis to capture the effect of <b>the</b> <b>crisis</b> to forecast errors, separate from other possible reasons. The data covers all U. S. companies with available earnings forecast data from the first quarter of 2004 to the last quarter of 2011, excluding the quarters during <b>the</b> financial <b>crisis.</b> <b>The</b> sample is pessimistic on average. 39 % of earnings forecasts were optimistic during the time span, excluding the quarters during <b>the</b> <b>crisis.</b> However, this study finds evidence that <b>the</b> financial <b>crisis</b> has contributed to further decrease in analysts' optimism in earnings forecasts. The proportion of optimistic forecasts is smaller after <b>the</b> <b>crisis</b> than before <b>the</b> <b>crisis.</b> Furthermore, <b>the</b> regression tests show that analysts are less optimistic after <b>the</b> <b>crisis,</b> independently from other possible reasons. The findings thus suggest that analysts are generally less optimistic after <b>the</b> financial <b>crisis.</b> Moreover, forecast errors are larger than before <b>the</b> <b>crisis.</b> However, this study does not examine the reasons behind the decrease in optimism...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{relation}} between firm performance preceding <b>the</b> Financial <b>Crisis</b> and their CEO compensation after <b>the</b> <b>Crisis.</b> We find {{a significant decrease in}} CEO compensation for firms that had bad performance prior to <b>the</b> <b>Crisis,</b> compared to those who performed well before <b>the</b> <b>Crisis.</b> This result remains after controlling for firm size, accounting performance, and year and industry fixed effects. The decrease in compensation seems to be derived from the drop in equity-based compensation. We conclude that boards are effective and considered the performance of the firm prior to <b>the</b> <b>Crisis</b> when they considered setting the compensation following the shock of <b>the</b> <b>Crisis...</b>|$|R

25|$|Another {{essential}} {{characteristic of}} a modern economy: the continuous accumulation and effective preservation of capital presented a problem (productive employment of capital) that for the Dutch capitalist was solved by {{a broad array of}} investment options, mediated by the Beurs, and later the merchant banks. Eventually, these financial structures proved unable to withstand <b>the</b> <b>crises</b> of the Revolutionary and Napoleonic era, but the determining criterion here is that they were at least present during the period in question.|$|E
25|$|In 2005, Ben Bernanke {{addressed}} {{the implications of}} the USA's high and rising current account (trade) deficit, resulting from USA imports exceeding its exports. Between 1996 and 2006, the USA current account deficit increased to a record of nearly 6% of GDP. Financing the trade deficit required the USA to borrow large sums from abroad, much of it from countries running trade surpluses, mainly the emerging economies in Asia and oil-exporting nations. A significant portion of this borrowing was directed by large financial institutions into mortgage-backed securities and their derivatives, a factor that contributed to the housing bubble and <b>the</b> <b>crises</b> that followed. The trade deficit peaked in 2006 along with housing prices.|$|E
40|$|Sun, Titman, and Twite (2014) {{find that}} risky capital {{structure}} characteristics, {{such as high}} leverage, a high share of debt due {{in the near future}} and a high share of variable-rate debt, significantly reduce the cumulative total returns of US REITs over the 2007 - 2009 financial crisis. In this paper we show that preparing ahead of <b>the</b> <b>crisis</b> significantly improved <b>the</b> cumulative return over <b>the</b> <b>crisis</b> period even after controlling for the levels of the relevant capital structure characteristics at the start of <b>the</b> <b>crisis.</b> Specifically, we document that REITs which reduced leverage and increased maturity prior to <b>the</b> <b>crisis</b> fared better during <b>the</b> <b>crisis.</b> For instance, a one standard deviation reduction in leverage generated a five percent higher cumulative return during <b>the</b> <b>crisis.</b> We further find that US REITs with the highest capital structure risk (high leverage and short maturities) were more likely to prepare for <b>the</b> <b>crisis</b> ahead by reducing leverage and extending maturity. This effect is especially large for REITs with strong governance. We also document that none of our findings hold for European REITs. This suggests that since European firms did not experience or observe the levels of market excess that occurred in the US before <b>the</b> <b>crisis,</b> whether or not they prepared for <b>the</b> <b>crisis</b> had no impact on their returns during <b>the</b> <b>crisis...</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} <b>the</b> global financial <b>crisis</b> on Nigerian listed firms' dividend policies. Our findings indicate that firms adjust their dividend policies {{in a manner consistent}} with the need to preserve financial flexibility and mitigate going concern risks during <b>the</b> <b>crisis</b> period. Specifically, highly leveraged firms and firms with low cash flows are more likely to omit dividend payments during <b>the</b> <b>crisis.</b> Moreover, <b>the</b> negative effects of foreign ownership on dividend payments during the pre-crisis are muted during <b>the</b> <b>crisis.</b> This suggests that the tax-induced clientele effect became irrelevant as cash dividends became the first order of business for foreign investors during <b>the</b> <b>crisis.</b> In <b>the</b> same vein, prevailing investor demand for cash dividends exerts a positive influence on firms' probability to increase dividends during <b>the</b> <b>crisis,</b> implying that markets attach a high valuation to firms that are able to pay during <b>the</b> <b>crisis</b> period. We also find support for past dividends as a reference point for current dividend decisions in both <b>the</b> <b>crisis</b> and non-crisis periods, although the relation is weakened during <b>the</b> <b>crisis.</b> This implies that some managers strive to maintain stable dividends during <b>the</b> <b>crisis</b> period. Nevertheless, their ability to do so weakens during this period...|$|R

25|$|The rolling blackouts {{brought on}} by <b>the</b> <b>crises</b> at the nuclear power plants in Fukushima had a {{profound}} effect on the rail networks around Tokyo starting on 14 March. Major railways began running trains at 10–20minute intervals, rather than the usual 3–5minute intervals, operating some lines only at rush hour and completely shutting down others; notably, the Tōkaidō Main Line, Yokosuka Line, Sōbu Main Line and Chūō-Sōbu Line were all stopped for the day. This led to near-paralysis within the capital, with long lines at train stations and many people unable to come to work or get home. Railway operators gradually increased capacity over the next few days, until running at approximately 80% capacity by 17 March and relieving the worst of the passenger congestion.|$|E
25|$|Callaghan's time as Prime Minister was {{dominated}} by the troubles in running a Government with a minority in the House of Commons: {{he was forced to}} make deals with minor parties to survive – including the Lib–Lab pact, and he had been forced to accept a referendum on devolution in Scotland as well as one in Wales (the former went in favour but did not reach the required majority, and the latter went heavily against). He also became prime minister at a time when Britain was suffering from double-digit percentage inflation and rising unemployment. He responded to the economic crises by adopting deflationary policies to reduce inflation, and cutting public expenditure – a precursor to the monetarist economic policies that the next government, a Conservative one led by Margaret Thatcher, would pursue to ease <b>the</b> <b>crises.</b>|$|E
25|$|Throughout 1942 {{and into}} early 1943, a complex series of {{overlapping}} crises placed enormous, widespread stress on Bengal's economy, particularly on its more vulnerable segments. Distressing {{military and political}} events and subsequent government and market responses created escalating price shocks that overlapped with supply shocks caused by natural disasters and plant disease later in the year. As Bengal's food needs rose from increased military presence and an influx of refugees from Burma, its ability to obtain rice and other foodgrains from outside the province was restricted by interprovincial trade barriers. The outlook of the typical Bengali, particularly in the countryside, deteriorated into a general belief in the inevitability of famine and devastating inflation, a lack {{of faith in the}} government's ability to overcome <b>the</b> <b>crises,</b> and a mood of isolation and panic.

Many nationalist leaders and activists of the Muslim League were dismayed with the suspension of the constitutionally obliged NFC Program while nationalists. His critics and Muslim League leaders observed that with the suspension of NFC Award Program, Suhrawardy tried to give more financial allocations, aids, grants, and opportunity to East-Pakistan than West Pakistan, including West Pakistan's four provinces. During the last days of his Prime ministerial years, Suhrawardy tried to remove the economic disparity between the Eastern and Western wings of the country but to no avail.

25|$|The reverberations of the Great Depression hit Greece in 1932. The Bank of Greece {{tried to}} adopt deflationary {{policies}} {{to stave off}} <b>the</b> <b>crises</b> {{that were going on}} in other countries, but these largely failed. For a brief period the drachma was pegged to the U.S. dollar, but this was unsustainable given the country's large trade deficit and the only long-term effects of this were Greece's foreign exchange reserves being almost totally wiped out in 1932. Remittances from abroad declined sharply and the value of the drachma began to plummet from 77 drachmas to the dollar in March 1931 to 111 drachmas to the dollar in April, 1931. This was especially harmful to Greece as the country relied on imports from the UK, France and the Middle East for many necessities. Greece went off the gold standard in April, 1932 and declared a moratorium on all interest payments. The country also adopted protectionist policies such as import quotas, which a number of European countries did during the time period.|$|E
25|$|In Rome, state cult to {{a living}} emperor {{acknowledged}} his rule as divinely approved and constitutional. As princeps (first citizen) he must respect traditional Republican mores; given virtually monarchic powers, he must restrain them. He {{was not a}} living divus but father of his country (pater patriae), its pontifex maximus (greatest priest) and at least notionally, its leading Republican. When he died, his ascent to heaven, or his descent to join the dii manes was decided by {{a vote in the}} Senate. As a divus, he could receive much the same honours as any other state deity – libations of wine, garlands, incense, hymns and sacrificial oxen at games and festivals. What he did in return for these favours is unknown, but literary hints and the later adoption of divus as a title for Christian Saints suggest him as a heavenly intercessor. In Rome, official cult to a living emperor was directed to his genius; a small number refused this honour and {{there is no evidence of}} any emperor receiving more than that. In <b>the</b> <b>crises</b> leading up to the Dominate, Imperial titles and honours multiplied, reaching a peak under Diocletian. Emperors before him had attempted to guarantee traditional cults as the core of Roman identity and well-being; refusal of cult undermined the state and was treasonous.|$|E
