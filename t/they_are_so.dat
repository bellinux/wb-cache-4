5|$|A brewer by trade, Lassell {{began making}} mirrors for his amateur {{telescope}} in 1820. When John Herschel received news of Neptune's discovery, {{he wrote to}} Lassell suggesting he search for possible moons. Lassell did so and discovered Triton eight days later. Lassell also claimed to have discovered rings. Although Neptune was later confirmed to have rings, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>so</b> faint and dark that {{it is doubtful that}} he actually saw them.|$|E
5|$|In Vietnam and Ghana, {{among other}} places, whales hold {{a sense of}} divinity. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>so</b> {{respected}} in their cultures that they occasionally hold funerals for beached whales, a throwback to Vietnam's ancient sea-based Austro-Asiatic culture. The god of the seas, according to Chinese folklore, was a large whale with human limbs.|$|E
5|$|Neptunium {{is found}} {{in at least three}} allotropes. Some claims of a fourth allotrope have been made, but <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>so</b> far not proven. This {{multiplicity}} of allotropes is common among the actinides. The crystal structures of neptunium, protactinium, uranium, and plutonium do not have clear analogs among the lanthanides and are more {{similar to those of the}} 3dtransition metals.|$|E
60|$|Then why did God {{take such}} trouble for them? Why did God care for them, and help them, and work wonders for them? Why? Exactly because <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>so</b> bad. He that hath ears to hear let him hear, and {{understand}} by this example of all examples what manner of God our God <b>is.</b> Just because <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>so</b> bad, His goodness yearned over {{them all the}} more, and longed to make them good. Just because <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>so</b> unclean and brutish His holiness longed all the more to cleanse them. Because <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>so</b> stupid and ignorant, His wisdom longed to make them wise. Because <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>so</b> miserable, His pity yearned over them, as a father over a child fallen into danger. Because <b>they</b> <b>were</b> sick, <b>they</b> had all the more need of a physician. Because <b>they</b> <b>were</b> lost, there {{was all the more}} reason for seeking and saving them. Because <b>they</b> <b>were</b> utterly weak, God desired all the more to put His strength into them, that His strength might be made perfect in weakness.|$|R
60|$|Even had <b>they</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> disposed, neither Bob nor Ralph {{could have}} joined the farmer {{in the pursuit of}} the men, because by the time they arrived at the {{carriage}} <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>so</b> nearly exhausted {{that it would have been}} a matter of impossibility for them to run fifty yards further, whatever the inducement.|$|R
60|$|Both {{the other}} {{brothers}} were quite satisfied, and praised him too, and as <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>so</b> fond {{of each other}} they all three remained at home and plied their trades: and as <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>so</b> experienced and skilful they earned {{a great deal of}} money. So they lived happily together till <b>they</b> <b>were</b> quite old, and when one was taken ill and died the two others <b>were</b> <b>so</b> deeply grieved that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> also taken ill and died too. And so, because <b>they</b> had all <b>been</b> <b>so</b> clever, and so fond of each other, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> all laid in one grave.|$|R
5|$|Outside of breed-specific shows, the Saddlebred is also {{promoted}} as suitable for competitive trail riding, endurance riding, dressage, combined driving, eventing, and show jumping. Some Saddlebreds are also suitable for fox hunting, cutting and roping. Because <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>so</b> closely affiliated with their traditional show ring competition, {{they are sometimes}} mistaken for warmbloods or Thoroughbred crosses when participating in other equine events. They are also suitable family horses used for trail and pleasure riding and ranch work.|$|E
5|$|Single-sensed souls, however, called nigoda, and element-bodied souls pervade all {{tiers of}} this universe. Nigodas are souls {{at the bottom}} end of the existential hierarchy. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>so</b> tiny and undifferentiated, that they lack even {{individual}} bodies, living in colonies. According to Jain texts, this infinity of nigodas {{can also be found}} in plant tissues, root vegetables and animal bodies. Depending on its karma, a soul transmigrates and reincarnates within the scope of this cosmology of destinies. The four main destinies are further divided into sub-categories and still smaller sub–sub categories. In all, Jain texts speak of a cycle of 8.4 million birth destinies in which souls find themselves again and again as they cycle within samsara.|$|E
5|$|The {{range of}} Naja nigricollis is {{currently}} expanding from the southeastern regions of Nigeria {{to the more}} desert and arid conditions in {{the central part of}} the nation. They also live in coastal scrubs and dry grasslands. Like other cobra species, they may find abandoned termite mounds or rodent holes to hide or cool off. However, tree trunks seem to be their favourite hiding places. They are excellent tree climbers, thus can be arboreal at times. Because <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>so</b> common across Africa, they are encountered in villages or small towns where they may come in direct contact with people.|$|E
50|$|<b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>so</b> {{named because}} from a {{distance}} <b>they</b> <b>were</b> thought to resemble a Native American's head dress.|$|R

5|$|Cerebellar abiotrophy (CA or CCA). Recessive disorder, {{homozygous}} {{horses are}} affected, carriers show no signs. An affected foal is usually born without clinical signs, {{but at some}} stage, usually after six weeks of age, develops severe incoordination, a head tremor, wide-legged stance and other symptoms related {{to the death of}} the purkinje cells in the cerebellum. Such foals are frequently diagnosed only after they have crashed into a fence or fallen over backwards, and often are misdiagnosed as suffering from a head injury caused by an accident. Severity varies, with some foals having fast onset of severe coordination problems, others showing milder signs. Mildly affected horses can live a full lifespan, but most are euthanized before adulthood because <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>so</b> accident-prone as to be dangerous. As of 2008, there is a genetic test that uses DNA markers associated with CA to detect both carriers and affected animals. Clinical signs are distinguishable from other neurological conditions, and a diagnosis of CA can be verified by examining the brain after euthanasia.|$|E
5|$|Deshastha Brahmins {{fall under}} the Pancha Dravida Brahmin {{classification}} of the Brahmin community in India. Other Brahmin sub-castes {{in the region are}} Karhade Brahmin, Devrukhe, Konkanastha and Goud Saraswat Brahmin, but these sub-castes only have a regional significance. Goud Saraswat Brahmins {{fall under the}} Pancha Gauda Brahmin classification, i.e. North Indian Brahmins. The Vedas are the world's oldest texts that are still used in worship and they are the oldest literature of India. Four Vedas exist of which the Rig Veda is the oldest. They were handed down from one generation of Brahmins to the next verbally and memorised by each generation. They were written down sometime around 400 BC. Other Vedas include the Yajur Veda, the Atharva Veda and the Sama Veda. Two different versions of the Yajur Veda exist, the White (Shukla in Sanskrit) and the black or (Krishna in Sanskrit). The Shukla Yajur Veda has a two different branches (Shakha in Sanskrit) called the Kanva and the Madhyandin. Deshastha Brahmins are further classified in two major sub-sects, the Deshashatha Rigvedi and the Deshastha Yajurvedi, based on the Veda they follow. The Yajurvedis are further classified into two groups called the Madhyandins and the Kanavas. The Madhyandins follow the Madhyandin branch of the Shukla Yajur Veda. The word Madhyandin is a fusion of two words Madhya and din which mean middle and day respectively. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>so</b> called because they perform Sandhya Vandana at noon.|$|E
5|$|The ears {{of river}} {{dolphins}} have specific adaptations to their aquatic environment. In humans, {{the middle ear}} works as an impedance equalizer between the outside air's low impedance and the cochlear fluid's high impedance. In river dolphins, and other cetaceans, there is no great difference between the outer and inner environments. Instead of sound passing through the outer ear to the middle ear, river dolphins receive sound through the throat, from which it passes through a low-impedance fat-filled cavity to the inner ear. The ear is acoustically isolated from the skull by air-filled sinus pockets, which allows for greater directional hearing underwater. Dolphins send out high frequency clicks from an organ known as a melon. This melon consists of fat, and the skull of any such creature containing a melon will have a large depression. This allows river dolphins to produce biosonar for orientation. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>so</b> dependent on echolocation that they can survive {{even if they are}} blind. Beyond locating an object, echolocation also provides the animal with an idea on the object's shape and size, though how exactly this works is not yet understood. The small hairs on the rostrum of the Amazon river dolphin are believed to function as a tactile sense, possibly to compensate for their poor eyesight.|$|E

25|$|Christian Scriptures record {{nothing about}} the Biblical Magi after {{reporting}} their going back to their own countries. Two separate traditions have surfaced claiming that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>so</b> moved by their encounter with Jesus that they either became Christians {{on their own or}} were quick to convert fully upon later encountering an Apostle of Jesus. The traditions claim that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>so</b> strong in their beliefs that they willingly embraced martyrdom.|$|R

25|$|For this viewpoint, {{one should}} {{consider}} how the archetypical scattering experiment is performed. The initial particles are prepared in well defined states where <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>so</b> far apart that they don't interact. They are somehow made to interact, and the final particles are registered when <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>so</b> far apart that they have ceased to interact. The idea {{is to look for}} states in the Heisenberg picture that in the distant past had the appearance of free particle states. This will be the in states. Likewise, an out state will be a state that in the distant future has the appearance of a free particle state.|$|E
