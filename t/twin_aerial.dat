40|$|The year 2000 was the 100 th {{anniversary of}} the {{transmission}} of the first voice over radio. On December 23, 1900, Prof. Reginald Aubrey Fessenden (Figure 1) - {{after a number of}} unsuccessful tries-transmitted “words without wires ” over a distance of 1600 m, between <b>twin</b> <b>aerial</b> systems employing 15 m masts, located on Cobb Island, Maryland. The quality of the received wireless-telephony transmission was reported to be perfectly intelligible, but the speech was accompanied by an extremely loud, disagreeable noise, due to the irregularity of the spark. Spark? Yes. Fessenden had not yet developed a method to generate continuous waves. The sender was a spark transmitter, operating at 10, 000 sparks/second, with an asbestos-covered carbon microphone inserted in the antenna lead. In spite of the primitive apparatus used, the poor quality of the transmission, and the short distance, intelligible speech had been transmitted by electromagnetic waves {{for the first time in}} the history of wireless. Who was Fessenden? The purpose of this paper is to touch upon his life’s history, and to give some detail of his accomplishments. However, the paper begins with a brief account of the birth of radio, so that the reader can appreciate Fessenden’s place in history...|$|E

25|$|Designed by Aedas, {{also the}} {{architect}} of the project, the line uses a continuous circulating <b>twin</b> cable <b>aerial</b> ropeway system, technically described as a bi-cable gondola lift. The Leitner Group was the contractor for the cable car system. Between the Tung Chung and Ngong Ping Terminals, the 5.7km cableway changes direction twice at the two angle stations, one on the south shore of Chek Lap Kok; the other west of Nei Lak Shan within the Lantau North Country Park. Whilst the gondola cabins are temporarily detached from the cables at each angle station, there are no passenger loading or unloading facilities at these points.|$|R

5000|$|The Crusader 101 had the {{additional}} benefit of size. It measured {{about three feet}} in length - or just under one meter - which allowed for some elaborate detail hitherto unseen in a toy car. The trunk had storage space for a spare tire, jack and lug wrench {{which could be used}} to actually change a wheel. <b>Twin</b> radio <b>aerials</b> on either rear fender could be raised or lowered by hand. Not only were the sun visors adjustable, the turn signal lever, steering wheel and gear selector could be moved as well. A male driver figure was included with the car - in a relaxed pose at the wheel and was just as detailed as the car itself. He was unpainted beige plastic.

50|$|In 1933, Fairey, having {{established}} a {{proven track record}} {{in the design and}} construction of naval aircraft, commenced development upon an entirely new three-seat naval aircraft intended for the <b>twin</b> roles of <b>aerial</b> reconnaissance and torpedo bomber. Receiving the internal designation of T.S.R. I, standing for Torpedo-Spotter-Reconnaissance I, the proposed design adopted a biplane configuration and a single 645 hp Bristol Pegasus IIM radial engine as its powerplant. The company chose to initially pursue development of the project as a self-financed private venture while both customers and applicable requirements for the type were sought. Development of the T.S.R. I was in parallel to Fairey's activities upon Air Ministry Specification S.9/30, for which the company was at one point developing a separate but broadly similar aircraft, powered by a Rolls-Royce Kestrel engine instead as well as employing a differing fin and rudder configuration.|$|R
50|$|Compared to the {{preceding}} , the new boats had a hull extended by 3 inches in both length and beam. The wheelhouse was fully enclosed with sliding doors {{on either side}} and there were bulwarks above the fenders fore and aft and, from the second boat, the forward cabin was increased in size. As with the previous year's , the boats were powered by commercial diesel engines rather than the RNLI designed units used previously. In this case, two 60 bhp Gardner 5LW five cylinder diesels were fitted with the exhaust being taken up the mast as on the later 46 ft 9in boats. As built, the boats had line aerials rigged from the forward mast to a pole mast aft of the rear cabin. During their careers, this rig was replaced by <b>twin</b> pole <b>aerials</b> and the aft mast was removed. Radar was fitted on a bracket {{on the port side}} of the rear cabin roof (some had it fitted to the wheelhouse roof). From 1973, the boats were modified to become self-righting by, in most cases, the fitting of an air bag on the starboard side of the rear cabin roof, adjacent to the radar. This gave a once only self-righting ability which was successfully deployed when 's The Baltic Exchange capsized on service in 1983. Six boats were rebuilt with larger forward and aft superstructures (akin to the 48 ft 6in Oakley and Solent classes) which made them inherently self-righting. In these boats the masts were removed and the exhaust outlets were {{on the side of the}} hull. The engines in these six were uprated to 70 bhp and these modified boats were the longest lasting of the type, all but one serving into the 1990s.|$|R
40|$|The {{design of}} new helicopters, {{as well as}} the {{prediction}} of the changes in the dynamic behavior as a consequence of structural modification will benefit of the availability of numerical tools capable to predict the vibration level characterizing the structure due to main rotor-fuselage interaction. These tools are of great importance to gather information concerning the fatigue-life of the structure, that in turn would allow a rough estimate of consequent maintenance costs. Furthermore, they would help in the process of identifying design solutions aimed to the reduction of interior noise, that is a crucial aspect for the widely-requested passenger comfort enhancement. In this paper, the capabilities of the ROTAERO simulation tool, developed at the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering of the University of Rome "La Sapienza," to predict both the trim conditions and the vibration levels, characterizing a flying helicopter, are explored. A general modular solution algorithm is developed for the trim analysis of helicopters, in order to evaluate the stationary solution of equilibrium equations for rotorcraft, and for the vibratory loads. These last characteristics are evaluated {{with the aid of a}} finite element model of the fuselage forced by vibratory hub loads, that are predicted through the aeroelastic analysis of the main rotor treated as isolated. The developed numerical procedure seeks the solution following an iterative solution scheme that includes the modeling of the different subsystem such as the main and the tail rotor, the fuselage, and the aerodynamic surfaces. A Bo- 105 helicopter is used as a numerical benchmark, whereas a Bergen Industrial <b>Twin</b> Unmanned <b>Aerial</b> Vehicle helicopter was used as a flying laboratory for the evaluation of the fuselage vibrations. A comparison between the numerical simulations, and the experimental findings, corresponding to flight tests with different advancing ratios, are reported for an overall assessment of the ROTAERO code...|$|R
5000|$|After {{five years}} {{production}} of the 37ft boat, the RNLI decided to extend the water ballast self-righting principal to a larger boat suitable for slipway launching and lying afloat. In 1962 a prototype boat was built, 48-01 Earl and Countess Howe (ON 968) and in appearance it resembled an extended [...] with a long tapering superstructure running forward from an aft cockpit which was covered, but open to the stern. The boat's water ballast system used 2 tons of water compared to 1 tons in the smaller boats. Power came from two 110 bhp Gardner 6LX six cylinder diesel engines, the redesigned and uprated version of the engine fitted to the last ten 52ft [...] class boats. Displacing 29 tons and built {{at a cost of}} £40,000, [...] was the first RNLI lifeboat to be built with radar installed and went on station at [...] in February 1963. It was four years before further examples were built, by which time a major redesign of the superstructure had resulted in the Mk. II version. In this an enclosed wheelhouse was positioned amidships, accessed by sliding doors on either side at the forward end. Behind the wheelhouse was an aft cabin which could accommodate a loaded stretcher. Initially, radio aerials were rigged between the foremast and a bipod mast {{at the back of the}} aft cabin, on the roof of which the radar scanner was mounted on a pylon. Later, the masts were removed and <b>twin</b> pole <b>aerials</b> fitted to the aft cabin just behind the wheelhouse with a small tripod mast fitted to the wheelhouse roof. [...] went on station at [...] in March 1967, followed by [...] which took up duties at [...] in July 1967.|$|R
