30|$|We have {{proposed}} a method to obtain 62.5 % of k-space data at odd <b>time</b> <b>frames</b> and estimate the sampling trajectory at even <b>time</b> <b>frames.</b> In ECG-gated cardiac MRI, k-space data for each cardiac phase (odd and even <b>time</b> <b>frames)</b> are obtained by collecting k-space data across several heart beats. Since even and odd <b>time</b> <b>frames</b> from a prospective gating are synthesized ones, they are not obtained in sequential order. Thus, the proposed algorithm may seem infeasible. However, {{it should be noted}} that when we do not fill k-space for even time points, we use the time to acquire more k-space data of the odd time points. Therefore, the number of heart bits (acquisition time) required for sampling of k-spaces of odd time points reduces. The acquisition time of even <b>time</b> <b>frames,</b> which is done afterwards, is reduced in the same way. Thus, the proposed method decreases the total time required for data acquisition. Details are presented in Additional file 1.|$|R

The presented theory of <b>timed</b> <b>frames</b> captures the basic algebraic properties of timed transition systems for the relative time case.

The algorithm makes use of temporal continuity and a non-uniform elastic material model to provide improved estimates of heart motion between <b>time</b> <b>frames.</b> Temporal continuity is enforced by two methods. First, a prediction motion field is calculated using an assumption of constant particle velocity between <b>time</b> <b>frames.</b> Second, incremental motion fields are used as initializations for the estimation of motion fields between distant <b>time</b> <b>frames.</b> The prediction fields augment the algorithm's ability to estimate motion between noisy adjacent <b>time</b> <b>frames,</b> and the concatenated incremental motion fields improve estimation for large deformations.
