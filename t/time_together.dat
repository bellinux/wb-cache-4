40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Family Studies and Human ServicesJared R. AndersonThe {{present study}} tests the {{reciprocal}} relationships between marital attitudes, <b>time</b> spent <b>together,</b> and marital satisfaction {{in a sample}} of newlyweds (N = 1220). Using cognitive dissonance theory and the investment model, this study tests two sets of theoretically derived unidirectional pathways to provide empirical evidence for longitudinal associations between these three constructs. Two separate models were tested, one for husbands, and one for wives. For both husbands and wives, results of the panel models indicated significant autoregressive paths among all three variables from T 1 to T 2, T 2 to T 3, and T 1 to T 3. Among husbands, significant cross-lagged paths emerged between T 1 marital satisfaction and T 2 marital attitudes, T 1 marital satisfaction and T 2 <b>time</b> spent <b>together,</b> T 1 <b>time</b> spent <b>together</b> and T 2 marital satisfaction, T 2 <b>time</b> spent <b>together</b> and T 3 marital satisfaction, and T 2 <b>time</b> spent <b>together</b> and T 3 marital attitudes. For wives, cross-lagged paths between T 1 marital satisfaction and T 2 <b>time</b> spent <b>together,</b> T 1 <b>time</b> spent <b>together</b> and T 2 marital satisfaction, and T 2 <b>time</b> spent <b>together</b> and T 3 marital satisfaction were found to be significant. Bootstrap test for indirect effects resulted in no significant mediating effects in the models. The results of these models are discussed and implications for future research and intervention are given...|$|R
