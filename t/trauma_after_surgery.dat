Recently, several authors investigated the phenomenon of immunoageing, indicating differences in the ageing immune system.

Methods: Blood was collected from young patients ( 70 y, n = 21) with proximal femur fractures (OF) upon clinical admission and within 6 hours <b>after</b> <b>surgery,</b> and two healthy age matched control groups (YH & OH). Serum TRAIL- and cytokine concentrations were analyzed via cytometric bead array, Fas-Ligand and TNF-Receptor-I via ELISA. CD 15 + magnetic bead-isolated neutrophils (PMN) were TUNEL stained. Results: IL- 6 was significantly increased only in OF <b>after</b> <b>trauma</b> and <b>surgery</b> whereas YF patient exhibited a marked decrease of TNF <b>after</b> <b>trauma.</b> Interestingly, a significant increase of GM-CSF serum levels was observed in YF only, whereas OF exhibited a decrease of systemic IFN-γ concentrations <b>after</b> <b>trauma</b> and <b>after</b> <b>surgery.</b> The healthy controls, old and young, had more or less similar inflammation levels...|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY: When {{the cornea}} {{of the eye}} dissolves, most {{commonly}} secondary to infection or trauma, the ventral wall of the anterior chamber of the eye is no longer supported and thus bulges forward, enlarging the anterior chamber volume.

Acorneal melt is a complete breakdown of the cornealstructure, which can be initiated by a variety of conditions most commonly related to infections, prior surgery, systemic or localized autoimmune diseases, or trauma. When a corneal melt occurs, it results in an enlarged anterior chamber of the eye and it has a uniqueCTmorphology,which {{does not appear to have}} been previously described, to our knowledge.

40|$|Abstract. Hyphema (blood in the {{anterior}} chamber) can occur after blunt or lacerating <b>trauma,</b> <b>after</b> intraocular <b>surgery,</b> spontaneously (e. g., in {{conditions such as}} rubeosis iridis, juvenile xanthogranuloma, iris melanoma, myotonic dystrophy, keratouveitis (e. g., herpes zoster), leukemia, hemophilia, von Willebrand disease, and {{in association with the}} use of substances that alter platelet or thrombin function (e. g., ethanol, aspirin, warfarin). The purpose of this review is to consider the management of hyphemas that occur <b>after</b> closed globe <b>trauma.</b> Complications of traumatic hyphema include increased intraocular pressure, peripheral anterior synechiae, optic atrophy, corneal bloodstaining, secondary hemorrhage, and accommodative impairment. The reported incidence of secondary anterior chamber hemorrhage, that is, rebleeding, in the setting of traumatic hyphema ranges from 0 % to 38 %. The risk of secondary hemorrhage may be higher in African-Americans than in whites. Secondary hemorrhage is generally thought to convey a worse visual prognosis, although the outcome may depend more directly {{on the size of the}} hyphema and the severity of associated ocular injuries. Some issues involved in managing a patient with hyphema are: use of various medications (e. g., cycloplegics, systemic or topical steroids, antifibrinolytic agents, analgesics, and antiglaucoma medications); the patient’s activity level; use of a patch and shield; outpatient vs. inpatient management; and medical vs...|$|R
