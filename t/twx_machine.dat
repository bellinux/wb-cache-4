This {{involved}} transmitting the message via paper tape to the InfoMaster Computer (dial code 6111) and specifying the destination addresses for the single text. In this way, a single message could be sent to multiple distant Telex and <b>TWX</b> <b>machines</b> as well as delivering the same message to non-Telex and non-TWX subscribers via Western Union Mailgram.|$|R
