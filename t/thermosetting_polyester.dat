The vibration properties are the amplitude, natural frequency, dynamic elastic moduli (young modulus in x, y directions and shear modulus in 1, 2 plane) and damping factor. The natural frequency of a system {{is a function of}} its elastic properties, dimensions, and mass. The woven roving glass fiber has been especially engineered for polymer reinforcement; but the unsaturated <b>thermosetting</b> <b>polyester</b> is widely used, offering a good balance of vibration properties at moderate or ambient temperatures, and also at relatively low cost. The mismatch between matrix and fiber yarns gives a predominant role for the fiber's mechanics where the matrix is the area where most damage mechanisms develop.

40|$|A {{series of}} ladder {{polymers}} have been synthesised from polycondensation reactions between phenazinium based monomers such as safranine O and acridine yellow G and benzoquinone type monomers. The same polymeric products were obtained {{regardless of whether}} the polymerisations were carried out in polyphosphoric acid, in organic solvent, or in the absence of solvent in the solid phase. However, the degree of completed ladder structure contained within the polymer was found to vary with different synthesis techniques. In general the ladder polymer prepared in PPA was superior in terms of intrinsic viscosity (molecular weight) and thermal stability in comparison to the same polymer prepared in organic solvent or in the solid phase. The polymer solubilities were poor in organic solvents and attempts to increase their solubilities with the introduction of bulky side-groups into the polymer structure was successful only in producing soluble single-strand polymers. The electrical conductivities (o) of the polymers lay in semi-conducting range with a clear trend showing that: 0 PPA > 0 DMAc/S. P. > 0 single-strand > 0 two-stagepolymers. The electrical conductivity was found to be stable for at least 30 days at incubation temperatures as high as 250 ° C. Temperature dependent conductivity studies show that plots of o versus T 1 / 4 are not perfectly linear, although correlation coefficients for plots against ' 11 / 4 and T 1 [beta] show that the data tends to favour Mott's three-dimensional conduction model.

40|$|Previous {{theoretical}} and experimental work {{has shown that}} surface tension gradients in liquid layers create surface defects and inhibit the levelling of an uneven surface. In coatings deposited from <b>thermosetting</b> <b>polyester</b> powders, which are studied here, small amounts of a low molecular-weight acrylate are incorporated {{to act as a}} "flow agent. " We find that this additive lowers the surface tension of the polymer melt and has a minor effect on the melt viscosity. A slower rate of levelling results from the decreased surface tension. We provide experimental evidence that lateral gradients in the surface tension of the polymer melt, resulting from the non-uniform distribution of the flow agent, inhibit the levelling of the surface. Specifically, the surface roughness of a powder coating is up to three times greater when a steep surface tension gradient is purposely created through powder blending. Surface tension gradients might also be responsible for the greater surface roughness (observed with atomic force microscopy on lateral length scales of 100 mum) that is found in coatings that contain flow agent.

The variables analyzed were: efficiency for barring the X-radiation, apparent density and mechanical properties. The effect, obtained from the experimental design, due to ratio of resin to barite in the apparent density was 0. 036.

Proposed mechanisms of polymer stabilisation involve significant changes to the HALS chemical structure; however, reports of the characterisation of these modified chemical species are limited. To better understand the fate of HALS and determine their in situ modifications, desorption electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry (DESI-MS) was employed to characterise ten commercially available HALS present in polyester-based coil coatings. TINUVIN® 770, 292, 144, 123, 152, and NOR 371; HOSTAVIN® 3052, 3055, 3050, and 3058 were separately formulated with a pigmented, <b>thermosetting</b> <b>polyester</b> resin, cured on metal at 262 °C and analysed directly by DESI-MS.

For HALS containing N-substituted piperidines (i. e., N–CH 3, N–C(O) CH 3, and N–OR) a secondary piperidine (N–H) analogue was detected in all cases. The formation of these intermediates can be explained either through hydrogen abstraction based mechanisms or direct N–OR homolysis with the former dominant under normal service temperatures (ca. 25 – 80 °C), and the latter potentially becoming competitive under the high temperatures associated with curing (ca. 230 – 260 °C) ...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The curing {{of an open}} mold {{composite}} {{consisting of}} three laminated thermoset layers is simulated using a one-dimensional finite element model (FEM). This curing simulation addresses the reaction kinetics {{of each of the}} <b>thermoset</b> <b>polyester</b> resins as well as the thermal transport across the composite to calculate a time-dependent cure of each layer. Curing of each of the resins is modeled as an autocatalytic reaction based on the isothermal reaction exotherms at several temperatures. These reaction models depend sensitively on processing parameters. In particular, the models are specific to each polyester formulation, pre-promoter, and concentration of methyl ethyl ketone peroxide initiator. A nonlinear, transient, one-dimensional FEM coupling the reaction exotherm with the thermal properties of the composite is being implemented in Abaqus. The measured temperature profiles of the composite layers during cure are semi-quantitatively reproduced by the model providing the degree of cure for each composite layer. Using the calculated degree of cure, the time evolution of the modulus of each layer can be estimated. While this simulation serves as a useful guide to the relationship between process parameters and laminate properties, it is not sufficiently accurate to provide process control for parameter optimization...|$|R

Double layer woven fibre mats were used. Talc was used as at different weight percentages (5 %, 10 % and 15 %) to investigate its effects on different properties of composites. It was observed that flexural strength and modulus increased {{with an increase in}} talc content. Thermal stabilities of composites were also improved.

40|$|This project {{aimed to}} study the {{feasibility}} of making a thermoset sandwich injection moulding from a novel thermoset co-injection moulding system. Two <b>thermoset</b> <b>polyesters,</b> BMC and a powder coating, were used for all experiments. Flow and cure of those materials in a newly designed manifold system were studied and some thermoset sandwich injection mouldings have been produced. Despite producing novel co-injection mouldings using two thermoset materials together, {{the results showed that}} the existing system was not applicable for large-scale production of sandwich parts and needed some improvements. The experiments on the moulding materials and single injection of each material gave temperature windows and settings for the co-injection moulding. The results from all experiments indicated that temperature and the time of applying heat to a thermoset material were very important to its flow ability and formation. Especially when producing a sandwich moulding, adequate heat and time was necessary for the skin material to form a sufficient layer to cover the core material. Investigation of the sandwich moulding cross-sections showed that applying more core injection delay time could help to increase the skin thickness. Surface assessmenitn dicated that the surface quality was also improved when the skin layer was thicker. However, core break-through at the position opposite to the mould gate was found in all sandwich mouldings showing that the type of mould gate was also important. A central sprue gated mould used in these experiments was found to be not suitable for producing a sandwich component using this machine configuration. A new manifold design was proposed and was compared to the existing manifold designed by using a simulation software package from Moldflow. Thermoset single injection moulding simulation was used to help to understand the flow and cure of a thermoset material in both manifold designs. It was shown that the new manifold system design was an improvement on the existing one.
