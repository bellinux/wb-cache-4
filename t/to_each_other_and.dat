5|$|Abelisaurid hindlimbs {{were more}} typical of ceratosaurs, with the astragalus and {{calcaneum}} (upper ankle bones) fused <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>and</b> to the tibia, forming a tibiotarsus. The tibia was shorter than the femur, giving the hindlimb stocky proportions. There were three functional digits on the foot (the second, third, and fourth), while the first digit, or hallux, did not contact the ground.|$|E

Fortune easily charms the crowd and hands out dollar bills to his customers. This embarrasses the unpopular Mr. Burns, who asks Homer to help him be loved by all.|$|E

5|$|Several {{subspecies}} of the goldcrest {{have been}} described. In continental Eurasia, {{there are nine}} generally accepted and very similar subspecies, differing only in details such as plumage shade. At the genetic level, the two Central Asian forms, R. r. sikkimensis and R. r. himalayensis, are very close <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> <b>and</b> have differentiated only in the recent past, but they diverged from the western subspecies around 2.8mya.|$|E
5|$|The two {{strands of}} DNA run in {{opposite}} directions <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>and</b> are thus antiparallel. Attached to each sugar {{is one of four}} types of nucleobases (informally, bases). It is the sequence of these four nucleobases along the backbone that encodes biological information. RNA strands are created using DNA strands as a template in a process called transcription. Under the genetic code, these RNA strands are translated to specify the sequence of amino acids within proteins in a process called translation.|$|E

5|$|Chavrusa {{learning}} {{tends to}} be loud and animated, as the study partners read the Talmudic text and the commentaries aloud <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>and</b> then analyze, question, debate, and defend their points of view {{to arrive at a}} mutual understanding of the text. In the heat of discussion, they may wave their hands or even shout at each other. Depending {{on the size of the}} yeshiva, dozens or even hundreds of chavrusas can be heard discussing and debating each other's opinions. One of the skills of chavrusa learning is the ability to block out all other discussions in the study hall and focus on one's study partner alone.|$|E
5|$|Cleopatra's Arrival in Cilicia (also {{known as}} The Triumph of Cleopatra) is based loosely on Plutarch's Life of Antony and Shakespeare's Antony and Cleopatra, {{in which the}} Queen of Egypt travels to Tarsus in Cilicia aboard a grand ship to cement an {{alliance}} with the Roman general Mark Antony. While superficially similar to The Coral Finder, Cleopatra is {{more closely related to}} the style of Regnault, with its intentionally cramped and crowded composition. The individual figures are out of proportion <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>and</b> the ship, while many figures are tightly positioned within a small section of the painting. As well as from Regnault, the work borrows elements from Titian, Rubens and classical sculpture.|$|E
5|$|Helena and Christian {{were devoted}} <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> <b>and</b> led a quiet life in {{comparison}} to Helena's sisters. Following their marriage, they took up residence at Cumberland Lodge in Windsor Great Park, the traditional residence of the Ranger of Windsor Great Park, the honorary position bestowed on Christian by the Queen. When staying in London, they lived at the Belgian Suite in Buckingham Palace. The couple had six children: Christian Victor in 1867, Albert in 1869, and Princesses Helena Victoria and Marie Louise in 1870 and 1872 respectively. Their last two sons died early; Harald died eight days after his birth in 1876, and an unnamed son was stillborn in 1877. Princess Louise, Helena's sister, commissioned the French sculptor Jules Dalou to sculpt a memorial to Helena's dead infants.|$|E

5|$|Ibotenic {{acid and}} {{muscimol}} are structurally related <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>and</b> to two major neurotransmitters {{of the central}} nervous system: glutamic acid and GABA respectively. Ibotenic acid and muscimol act like these neurotransmitters, muscimol being a potent GABAA agonist, while ibotenic acid is an agonist of NMDA glutamate receptors and certain metabotropic glutamate receptors which {{are involved in the}} control of neuronal activity. It is these interactions which are thought to cause the psychoactive effects found in intoxication. Muscimol is the agent responsible {{for the majority of the}} psychoactivity.|$|E
5|$|In 1735, Euler {{presented}} {{a solution to}} the problem known as the Seven Bridges of Königsberg. The city of Königsberg, Prussia was set on the Pregel River, and included two large islands that were connected <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>and</b> the mainland by seven bridges. The problem is to decide whether it is possible to follow a path that crosses each bridge exactly once and returns to the starting point. It is not possible: there is no Eulerian circuit. This solution is considered to be the first theorem of graph theory, specifically of planar graph theory.|$|E
5|$|In Chicago's bid, {{the games}} {{would have been}} held from July 22 to August 7, with the Paralympics held between August 12 and 28. The bid plan {{emphasized}} use of Chicago Park District parks to host the games, but other existing facilities such as Soldier Field and McCormick Place would have hosted events. The bid included a plan for North Side, Downtown Loop and South Side celebration locations that would have had high-definition LED screens for unticketed visitors. The bid noted {{that there was a}} very high concentration of event locations and training facilities close <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>and</b> that the majority of event sites were clustered together. Thus, the vast majority of athletes would have been close to their competitions.|$|E

5|$|Keynes's {{optimism}} {{was also}} cultural, in two senses: {{he was of}} the last generation raised by an empire still {{at the height of}} its power, and was also of the last generation who felt entitled to govern by culture, rather than by expertise. According to Skidelsky, the sense of cultural unity current in Britain from the 19th century to the end of World War I provided a framework with which the well-educated could set various spheres of knowledge in relation <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>and</b> to life, enabling them to confidently draw from different fields when addressing practical problems.|$|E
5|$|Like {{many species}} of spider, a P. schultzi lays a {{continuous}} dragline of silk as it moves, {{and from time to}} time anchors the dragline to a surface with a spot of sticky silk. This allows the spider to return to the surface if the animal is dislodged. A spider about to jump first lays a sticky silk anchor, and then lays out a dragline as it flies. Unlike those of most jumping spiders, P. schultzi′s draglines stick <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>and,</b> when a P. schultzi has laid a few lines across a gap, it uses these as walkways and reinforces them with additional silk as it moves.|$|E

5|$|Marcelo Weksler {{and colleagues}} removed {{most of the}} species then placed in Oryzomys from the genus in 2006, {{retaining}} only the marsh rice rat and related species, including O.gorgasi.

Voss and Weksler examined the two and concluded that they represented the same species on the basis of direct comparisons and a phylogenetic analysis. The resultant tree placed O.curasoae and O.gorgasi sister <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>and</b> closer to O.couesi than to the marsh rice rat. Accordingly, they placed O.curasoae as a junior synonym of the earlier described O.gorgasi.|$|E
