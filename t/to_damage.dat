The flooding damaged several houses and killed two people. Winds were generally light, although strong enough <b>to</b> <b>damage</b> a few electrical poles and small buildings.

5|$|Concentrated {{hydrochloric}} acid (fuming {{hydrochloric acid}}) forms acidic mists. Both the mist and the solution have a corrosive effect on human tissue, {{with the potential}} <b>to</b> <b>damage</b> respiratory organs, eyes, skin, and intestines irreversibly. Upon mixing hydrochloric acid with common oxidizing chemicals, such as sodium hypochlorite (bleach, NaClO) or potassium permanganate (KMnO4), the toxic gas chlorine is produced.|$|E
5|$|Drilling at low speed: The {{pilot hole}} is {{expanded}} by using progressively wider drills (typically {{between three and}} seven successive drilling steps, depending on implant width and length). Care is taken not <b>to</b> <b>damage</b> the osteoblast or bone cells by overheating. A cooling saline or water spray keeps the temperature low.|$|E
5|$|Eukaryotic cells {{exposed to}} DNA {{damaging}} agents also activate important defensive pathways by inducing multiple proteins involved in DNA repair, cell cycle checkpoint control, protein trafficking and degradation. Such genome wide transcriptional response is very complex and tightly regulated, thus allowing coordinated global response <b>to</b> <b>damage.</b> Exposure of yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to DNA damaging agents results in overlapping but distinct transcriptional profiles. Similarities to environmental shock response {{indicates that a}} general global stress response pathway exist {{at the level of}} transcriptional activation. In contrast, different human cell types respond <b>to</b> <b>damage</b> differently indicating an absence of a common global response. The probable explanation for this difference between yeast and human cells may be in the heterogeneity of mammalian cells. In an animal different types of cells are distributed among different organs that have evolved different sensitivities to DNA damage.|$|E

5|$|If possible, {{the use of}} {{wood and}} {{cellulose}} derivatives should be avoided entirely. Many varnishes and paints are well known emitters of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), {{some of which may}} be acidic, and thus have the potential <b>to</b> <b>damage</b> calcium carbonate specimens. Because of this, these coatings should also be avoided; water-based varnishes and paints are considered less harmful, and should be preferred.|$|E
5|$|In a {{small number}} of people, {{brachytherapy}} may cause long-term side effects due <b>to</b> <b>damage</b> or disruption of adjacent tissues or organs. Long-term side effects are usually mild or moderate in nature.

40|$|According to the Court of Justice, a {{party to}} an anticompetitive {{agreement}} that infringes Article 81 E. C. may, {{if he is not}} significantly responsible for the breach of E. C. Law, claim damages from the other party. This article critically reviews the reasons for recognising the right <b>to</b> <b>damages</b> {{as a matter of law}} and policy and then attempts to identify situations where a plaintiff may assert a right <b>to</b> <b>damages.</b> Moreover, the right <b>to</b> <b>damages</b> creates a set of as yet unspecified obligations on potential defendants. While dominant undertakings have special obligations towards those they contract with, the existence of and justification for imposing similar duties on undertakings on the basis of Article 81 is less easy to explain. This article raises a number of doctrinal and policy reasons to suggest that parties to a contract in breach of Article 81 should not have a right <b>to</b> <b>damages...</b>|$|R
