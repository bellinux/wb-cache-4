30|$|Since m<n, {{the vector}} sn× 1 cannot be uniquely {{recovered}} by observing the measurement vector xm× 1; however, among the {{infinite number of}} solutions to (1), <b>the</b> <b>sparsest</b> solution may be unique. For instance, if no 2 k columns of Am×n are linearly dependent, the null-space of Am×n does not include any 2 k-sparse vector (at most 2 k non-zero elements) and therefore, the measurement vectors (xm×n) of different k-sparse vectors are different. Thus, if sn× 1 is <b>sparse</b> enough (k-sparse), <b>the</b> <b>sparsest</b> solution of (1) is unique and coincides with sn× 1; i.e., perfect recovery.

The system operator employs Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs) for detecting such attacks, while attackers devise attacks that are unobservable by such PMU networks.

The game is the first Metroid game to let the player choose a difficulty level at the start of the game; each of three levels varies in the amount of damage caused by enemies.

5|$|The main ovals are the {{dominant}} {{part of the}} Jovian aurorae. They have stable shapes and locations, but their intensities are strongly modulated by the solar wind pressure—the stronger solar wind, the weaker the aurorae. As mentioned above, the main ovals are maintained by the strong influx of electrons accelerated by the electric potential drops between the magnetodisk plasma and the Jovian ionosphere. These electrons carry field aligned currents, which maintain the plasma's co-rotation in the magnetodisk. The potential drops develop because <b>the</b> <b>sparse</b> plasma outside the equatorial sheet can only carry a current of a limited strength without those currents. The precipitating electrons have energy in the range 10–100keV and penetrate deep into the atmosphere of Jupiter, where they ionize and excite molecular hydrogen causing ultraviolet emission.
