Mnstigias migrates vertically repeatedly at night, periodically visiting the nutrient-rich chemocline at about 15 m where, together with that <b>taken</b> <b>up</b> at ambient concentrations, the animals may <b>take</b> <b>up</b> enough ammonium to satisfy the total daily nitrogen requirement of their symbiotic algae. These observations are consistent With the hypothesis that repeated vertical migration by Mnstigias is a behavioral adaptation in the animal that facilitates nutrient acquisition by its algal symbionts.
