40|$|I used a {{conceptual}} model proposed by Schlosser (1987) <b>to</b> compare <b>channelized</b> and unchannelized {{reaches of the}} South Sulphur River, Texas. This model suggests that fish assemblage structure can be predicted based {{on the level of}} habitat heteroge neity, especially with regard to the level of pool development. Based on Schlosser?s model, I hypothesized that habitat heterogeneity would be greater in the unchannelized (as compared <b>to</b> <b>channelized)</b> reach of the South Sulphur River, which would therefore have more stable fish assemblages. Fish assemblages in this reach would have similar total fish density and higher species richness, in addition to lower density and higher biomass of larger-bodied fish (primarily piscivores and omnivores), as well as lower density and biomass of juveniles and adults of small-bodied species (primarily invertivores) as compared <b>to</b> the <b>channelized</b> reach. Habitat characteristics conformed to my predictions, but fish assemblage attributes were opposite those hypothesized. Schlosser?s study focused on biotic processes more than the abiotic effects of a highly variable, stochastic environment. I propose that abiotic processes, particularly extreme fluctuations in flow regimes, are likely to be the most influential factors affecting fish assemblages in the South Sulphur River. Streams in this region are naturally subject to extreme variations in streamflow, but unchannelized sites may have been more directly influenced by water release or retention from the relatively recent construction of Cooper Dam located just upstream, whereas channelized sites, located much further downstream, were probably less affected. Most fish species present in the South Sulphur River are considered habitat generalists, have evolved to cope with extreme changes in environmental conditions, and are able to populate a variety of available habitats. Therefore, future management of this stream should reflect the needs of the few remaining fluvial specialists in this system, such as the intolerant freckled madtom and mimic shiner...|$|R

40|$|Ageing drivers {{experience}} {{a higher risk}} of intersection crashes because of their decrease in driving efficiency, including the decline in cognitive ability, head and neck flexibility, and visual acuity. Although several studies have been conducted to examine the factors associated with ageing driver crashes at intersections, little research has been conducted to examine the differences in the factors related to ageing drivers&# 039; turning paths and intersection geometric features. This study aims to improve the safety of ageing drivers at intersections by identifying the maneuvers that are risky for them and tracking their turning movements at selected intersections. We find that ageing drivers experience more crashes at intersections than younger drivers, especially crashes involving turning movements. Furthermore, ageing drivers experience more crashes at unchannelized intersections compared <b>to</b> <b>channelized</b> intersections. In addition, this study finds that ageing drivers exhibit greater and more inconsistent offsets during turning movements compared to those of younger drivers at both channelized and unchannelized intersections. Ageing drivers also tend to make relatively sharper or tighter turns than younger drivers. Hence, transportation engineers and road safety professionals should consider appropriate countermeasures to reduce the risks of crashes involving ageing drivers at intersections...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The Santo Onofre Group {{registers}} {{the filling}} of a Tonian, intracontinental paleo-rift that developed {{along the northern}} and central Espinhaço regions. This paper examines this unit in the central Espinhaço region with stratigraphic analysis and U-Pb geochronology, reviewing and dividing into the Canatiba and Rio Peixe Bravo Formations, which include the Barrinha Member. The Canatiba Formation mainly comprises carbon-rich mudstones that were deposited through low-density turbidity flows that alternated with sediment settling under anoxic conditions. The Rio Peixe Bravo Formation consists of a succession of sandstones and minor mudstones, which were deposited through low- to high-density turbidity flows. The Barrinha Member mainly consists of conglomerates and is related <b>to</b> <b>channelized</b> debris flows. Detrital zircon grains show maximum depositional ages of 930 ± 33 Ma and around 865 Ma for the Canatiba and Rio Peixe Bravo Formations, respectively. We interpret the Santo Onofre rifting to be relative younger than that for the Sítio Novo Group {{and to be a}} precursor stage of the glacial and post-glacial rift-to-passive margin-related sequences of the Macaúbas Group. The lithostratigraphic term “Macaúbas Supergroup” would be of better use to accommodate the unconformity-bounded Tonian sequences that were related to the Rodinia breakup in the Congo-São Francisco paleocontinent...|$|R

50|$|By the 1920s, most of {{the prairie}} had been {{purchased}} by Camp Ranch, Inc. In 1927, Camp Ranch, Inc. built a canal system to divert water coming into Alachua Lake in the Paynes Prairie Basin from Newnans Lake to Orange Lake through the River Styx. The diversion of the water meant a loss of 50% of the surface water supply to Paynes Prairie. That same year, the state of Florida built U.S. 441 through the basin. In 1937, Camp Ranch began construction on the Sweetwater Branch Canal. It was designed <b>to</b> <b>channelize</b> the flow from Sweetwater Branch directly into Alachua sink instead of allowing it to settle in Lake Alachua. The subsequent urbanization of Gainesville increased the amount of stormwater directed into Sweetwater Branch and also pollutants.
