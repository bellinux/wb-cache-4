5|$|In 2004, {{just two}} years before the release of the VE Commodore, Holden {{unveiled}} the Torana TT36 concept car at the Australian International Motor Show in Sydney. The TT36 served as a preview of the VE and allowed Holden to gauge public reaction to its styling. Much of the Torana's styling drew on the essence of the VE's design. Some production-ready components even carried over from the TT36 including <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> <b>wheel,</b> the window and rear-view mirror switch cluster and the handbrake lever.|$|E
5|$|Both {{tracks and}} wheels {{were used for}} {{steering}}. The steering system was set up so that shallow turns used only the wheels, but brakes would {{be applied to the}} tracks the farther <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> was turned. The drive sprocket had rollers rather than the more common teeth. The rear suspension consisted of six double roadwheels, overlapping and interleaved in the usual Schachtellaufwerk system used for German half-track vehicles, mounted on swing arms sprung by torsion bars. An idler wheel, mounted {{at the rear of the}} vehicle, was used to control track tension. The front wheels had leaf springs and shock absorbers.|$|E

The steering system was set up so that gentle turns used just the steerable front wheels, but brakes would {{be applied to the}} tracks the farther <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> was turned. The drive sprocket had the track-saving but more complicated rollers rather than the more common teeth. The rear suspension consisted of five double roadwheels, overlapping and interleaved in the Schachtellaufwerk layout, mounted on swing arms sprung by torsion bars. An idler wheel, mounted {{at the rear of the}} vehicle, was used to control track tension. The front axle had transversely mounted leaf springs and shock absorbers - the only ones on the vehicle.|$|E

5|$|David {{begins by}} sending poison pen letters to Nick's wife Leanne Battersby (Jane Danson), which state that Nick {{is having an}} affair. Nick realises David is behind the letters. Price told Kilkelly (Digital Spy) his {{character}} panics and becomes annoyed. Nick is arrogant to his actions and believes David will just forgive him because they are related. He then tells David that they should discuss the affair with Kylie and move on. Price explained that David is worried that Kylie will feel betrayed he knew all along and does not want her to leave him. He decides he must stop Nick and grabs <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> and causes a car crash. Price believed David {{was not trying to}} murder Nick, just prevent him from contacting Kylie.|$|E
5|$|Markway becomes {{alarmed at}} Eleanor's {{obsession}} with Hill House {{in spite of}} the dangers it poses for her. Despite Eleanor's pleas to stay, Markway insists that she leave at once and asks Luke to accompany her home. Before he can join her in the car, Eleanor drives off and speeds down the road toward the front gates. She soon feels <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> move by itself and the car advances erratically. At first she struggles to regain control but then surrenders to the unseen force. Suddenly Grace appears from behind a tree and steps in front of the car. Eleanor crashes into the tree and is killed. Luke observes it seemed that Eleanor deliberately aimed the car at the tree, but Markway asserts that something was in the car with her. He notes that the tree that claimed Eleanor's life is the same one that killed the first Mrs. Crain. Theo remarks that Eleanor got what she wanted—to remain with the house.|$|E
5|$|Spottiswoode {{tried to}} {{innovate}} {{in the action}} scenes. Since the director felt that after the tank chase in GoldenEye he could not use a bigger vehicle, a scene with Bond and Wai Lin on a BMW motorcycle was created. Another innovation was the remote-controlled car, which had no visible driver – an effect achieved by adapting a BMW 750i to put <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> on the back seat. The car chase sequence with the 750i took three weeks to film, with Brent Cross car park being used to simulate Hamburg – although the final leap was filmed on location. A stunt involving setting fire to three vehicles produced more smoke than anticipated, causing {{a member of the}} public to call the fire brigade. The upwards camera angle filming the HALO jump created the illusion of having the stuntman opening its parachute close to the water.|$|E

50|$|Prior to Nintendo's own Wii <b>Wheel,</b> several {{third-party}} <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> accessories {{had been}} introduced for the Wii Remote. One released by Ubisoft, <b>the</b> Wii <b>Steering</b> <b>Wheel,</b> was developed by Thrustmaster. It is bundled with certain games, such as Monster 4x4 World Circuit and GT Pro Series. The accessory, which is only for aesthetic/ergonomic enhancement, is meant for driving-style gameplay in which the Wii Remote would be held lengthwise in a two-handed gamepad orientation, <b>steering</b> <b>the</b> subject by tilting the controller. <b>The</b> Wii <b>Steering</b> <b>Wheel</b> is also sold separately. Since <b>the</b> Wii <b>Steering</b> <b>Wheel</b> was revealed, other similarly designed <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> accessories have been produced, including the Wii Racing Wheel by Intec.|$|R

5|$|The guide-wheel, which {{protrudes}} {{just ahead of}} the front wheels, is {{the most important part of}} the bus when travelling on the O-Bahn. It is connected directly to the steering mechanism, and steers the bus by running along the raised edge of the track. While it is not strictly necessary for drivers to hold <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> when travelling on the O-Bahn because of the guide-wheel, safety procedures require the driver to be alert to their circumstances at all times. A rumble strip before stations is a reminder that they need to resume control. The guide-wheel is the most delicate part of the system and is designed to snap off upon sharp impact; before the O-Bahn was in place, a number of buses were fitted with guide-wheels for their ordinary routes to test their durability. Drivers were forced to be more cautious on their normal trips after numerous guide-wheel-to-kerb impacts.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fall}} of 1973, Atari began work on a driving game, an idea founder Nolan Bushnell had wanted to do since the company was {{initially}} founded in June 1972 before it was shelved in favor of Pong. The design work itself was handled by Cyan Engineering, which had recently become a semi-independent research and development subsidiary of Atari and had previously handled the prototype design of Gotcha. Larry Emmons developed the circuits to control the car itself in the game, creating the feel of braking, acceleration, and movement. Emmons also used integrated circuit-based memory—specifically, mask ROM (read-only memory)— in his circuit design to store graphical data such as the tracks, rather than the diode arrays that previous arcade games used. This {{is believed to be}} the first use of integrated circuit-based memory in an arcade game, and ROMs thereafter became the standard for arcade and console video games. The mechanical designs for the game, including <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> <b>wheel,</b> pedal, and gear shift controllers, were developed by Eigen Systems, located in the same building as Cyan and founded by ex-coworkers of the Cyan founders Emmons and Steven Mayer. At one point, the game's design included a small printer that would print high scores when achieved, but this was removed prior to the final design.|$|E

25|$|Despite this, the Aura {{has a few}} criticisms. The Aura's {{interior}} {{has been}} criticized for using cheap materials. Also, <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> {{has been criticized for}} being too big for some drivers and that rear headroom was tight when equipped with the optional sunroof. The Aura was also criticized for being noisy over bumps and its lack of a rear armrest and head restraint, and that the push button controls on <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> cannot be operated while holding the wheel. Robert Cumberford of Autombile magazine claimed that the Aura is a good car watered down by GM's cost cutting department.|$|E
25|$|Interiors were mildly revised {{with minor}} {{changes to the}} {{instrument}} panel including the movement of the heating/air conditioning controls to the left of <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> <b>wheel,</b> which was new this year. Headrests, previously optional, were now standard equipment due to a federal safety mandate. The 1969 LeSabre and other Buicks also received a new steering column mounted ignition switch (relocated from the instrument panel) that also locked <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> when the transmission was in Park. The ignition/locking steering column appeared on all 1969 General Motors cars one year ahead of the federal mandate requiring all cars to be so equipped.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the consequences on the physical workload of new solutions in the forklift cab environment for the driver by quantifying the physical workload on the neck, shoulders, arms and wrists as an effect of steering systems. Twelve male subjects conducted identical test cycles with three types of steering: normal, tilted and miniature. The physical load on the drivers was evaluated using goniometry, inclinometry and electromyography. No major differences were detected when comparing the normal to <b>the</b> tilted <b>steering</b> <b>wheel.</b> <b>The</b> miniature <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> showed, in comparison to <b>the</b> normal <b>steering</b> <b>wheel,</b> lower velocity for the right and left wrists, lower elevation and lower velocity for the left upper arm, a reduction in load on the right trapezius muscle, respectively, and most noticeably a 6 -fold increase in the "static" load and a 10 -fold decrease in the time for rest/recovery for the left wrist extensor muscles. <b>The</b> tilted <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> did not have any significant effect on the workload. However, the effects of <b>the</b> miniature <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> indicate an increased risk for over exertion resulting in disorders of the wrist and forearm for the left side. Relevance to industry: When introducing new techniques or changes in technical systems, it is essential to evaluate the effects on the human workload with objective measurements...|$|R
