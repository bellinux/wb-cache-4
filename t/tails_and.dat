40|$|This {{study has}} been carried out, {{measuring}} the wool length and calculating its coefficient of variation of the shoulder, thigh <b>and</b> the <b>tail</b> in each of 14 lambs in docking time and in each of 3 sheeps of 12 months of age, and comparing {{the correlations between the}} wool length of the <b>tail</b> <b>and</b> that of the shoulder and also between the wool length of the <b>tail</b> <b>and</b> that of the thigh and the correlations between the variation of the wool length of the <b>tail</b> <b>and</b> the of the shoulder and also between the variation of the wool length of the <b>tail</b> <b>and</b> that of the thigh on both ages of the sheeps, with the object of determining whether the wool length and its variation in the fleece of adult sheep may be predicted by the observation of the wool length and its variation of the tail in the early age of the Corriedale sheep. The results obtained were as follows; 1. A tendency was found that the wool length of the tail was greater than those of the shoulder and the thigh in docking time of the Corriedale sheep. 2. Positive and high degree of correlations were found to exist between the wool length of the <b>tail</b> <b>and</b> that of the shoulder and also between the wool length of the <b>tail</b> <b>and</b> that of the thigh in lamb's dacking time and it was very likely that the similar correlations between the wool length of the <b>tail</b> <b>and</b> that of the shoulder and also between the wool length of the <b>tail</b> <b>and</b> that of the thigh in the sheeps of 12 months of age might exist. 3. Positive correlations were found to exist between the variation of the wool length of the <b>tail</b> <b>and</b> that of the shoulder and also between the variation of the wool length of the <b>tail</b> <b>and</b> that of the thigh in lamb's docking time, but {{it was found that the}} correlations were lower than those of the wool length. It was suggested that positive and low correlations might exist between the variation of the wool length of the <b>tail</b> <b>and</b> that of the shoulder and also between the variation of the wool length of the <b>tail</b> <b>and</b> that of the thigh in 12 months of age of sheep. 4. It is expected that the wool length and its variation in the fleece of adult sheep may be predicted. and a selection of the sheeps which may be greater in the wool length and may also show the least variations in the wool length, may be possible by the observation of the wool length and its vatiation in the early age of the Corriedale sheep...|$|R

25|$|Several {{muscles in}} the {{posterior}} of ankylosaurids (dorsalis caudae, ilio-caudalis, coccygeo-femoralis brevis, coccygeo-femoralis longus, ilio-tibialis, and ischio caudalis) were used for motion of the <b>tail</b> <b>and</b> <b>tail</b> club. Ankylosaurids tend to have horizontal rather than an obliquely vertical orientation of zygapophyseal articulations in the free caudal vertebrae of the tail. This arrangement is most effective for side-to-side rather than vertical mobility. The absence of musculature to elevate the <b>tail,</b> <b>and</b> this orientation of zygapophyses suggest that the <b>tail</b> <b>and</b> its club swept parallel to and slightly above the ground.|$|R
