5|$|On 22 October, Gosiewski was {{defeated}} by Swedish forces in the Battle of Filipów and turned to Lithuania. Also on 22 October, besieged Dorpat surrendered to Alexis, while the Russian siege of Swedish-held Riga was lifted. John II Casimir meanwhile took Bromberg (Bydgoszcz) and Konitz in Royal Prussia, and from 15 November 1656 until February 1657 stayed in Danzig, where a Swedish siege had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>lifted</b> due to Dutch intervention, just 55 kilometers away from Charles X Gustav's quarters in Elbing.|$|E

The type of aircraft used would have depended on when exactly the battleships would have been commissioned, but in all probability they {{would have used}} either the Kingfisher or the Seahawk.

40|$|The Fong-Swan theorem {{shows that}} if ϕ is any {{irreducible}} Brauer {{character of a}} finite solvable group G, then there necessarily exists an ordinary irreducible character χ of G that restricts to ϕ. In this case we say that χ <b>is</b> a <b>lift</b> of ϕ. If N G and χ ∈ Irr(G) <b>is</b> a <b>lift,</b> it <b>is</b> also known that the constituents of χN need not <b>be</b> <b>lifts.</b> In this paper we give a sufficient condition for the constituents of χN <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>lifts</b> if G <b>is</b> assumed <b>to</b> have odd order. This condition depends on the local structure of G, {{and in particular the}} Navarro vertices. We also give sufficient conditions for the constituents of ψG <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>lifts</b> if N G and ψ ∈ Irr(N) <b>is</b> a <b>lift.</b> Finally, we will use these results to prove the existence and uniqueness of lifts that behave well with respect to normal subgroups...|$|R

5|$|Alexios was {{replaced}} as commander by John Tarchaneiotes, first cousin of Andronikos II, and {{disappeared from the}} scene for 30 years. His successors proved greatly inferior, and by 1323, Byzantine possessions in Asia had been greatly reduced. At that point, Patriarch Jesaias urged Andronikos to recall the aged general. A desperate Andronikos agreed and pardoned Alexios in 1324. Alexios was tasked with relieving the isolated exclave of Philadelphia, which had been long under siege {{and was ready to}} fall. He was given no army, but, according to the Byzantine chroniclers, the mere news of Alexios's approach, and the respect in which the Turks held him, was enough for the siege <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>lifted.</b> Alexios was appointed governor of the city, a position he retained until 1327.|$|E
5|$|The I-5 was {{involved}} in tests of the Zveno project where a Tupolev TB-3 heavy bomber carried three I-5s as parasite fighters. One I-5 was carried was on each wing and a third over the fuselage. Ramps were used to get the wing-mounted aircraft to their places, but the fuselage-mounted aircraft had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>lifted</b> by hand. This was so cumbersome that they were generally used solely as an extra powerplant for the TB-3 later in the program. The aircraft used in these trials used the longer landing gear with smaller tires originally used in the prototypes.|$|E
5|$|The Israeli forces {{amounted}} {{to less than}} a brigade of armor, an infantry brigade, a paratroop battalion, an engineering battalion and five battalions of artillery. The units were divided into four task forces. The largest of these was to cross the Allenby Bridge and reach Karameh from the south; a second one was to cross the Damiyah Bridge, and reach Karameh from the north, thus completing a pincer move. Meanwhile, paratroopers were <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>lifted</b> by helicopters into the town while the fourth force would make a diversionary attack at King Abdullah Bridge to draw the Jordanian forces from Karameh and to cover the main attack.|$|E

5|$|The {{number of}} {{positions}} available to women in the ADF has increased over time. Although servicewomen were initially barred from combat positions, these restrictions began <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>lifted</b> in 1990. In 2010 approximately 92% of employment categories and 84% of positions in the ADF were available to females as well as males. In September 2011 Minister for Defence Stephen Smith announced that the Cabinet had decided to remove all restrictions on women serving in combat positions, and that this change would come into effect within five years. This decision {{was supported by the}} CDF and the chiefs of the services. Women became able to apply for all positions other than special forces roles in the Army on 1 January 2013. This remaining restriction was removed during 2016.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of Hitler's release from prison, {{politics}} in Germany had become less combative and the economy had improved, limiting Hitler's opportunities for political agitation. As {{a result of the}} failed Beer Hall Putsch, the NSDAP and its affiliated organisations were banned in Bavaria. In a meeting with the Prime Minister of Bavaria Heinrich Held on 4 January 1925, Hitler agreed to respect the state's authority and promised that he would seek political power only through the democratic process. The meeting {{paved the way for the}} ban on the NSDAP <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>lifted</b> on 16 February. However, after an inflammatory speech he gave on 27 February, Hitler was barred from public speaking by the Bavarian authorities, a ban that remained in place until 1927. To advance his political ambitions in spite of the ban, Hitler appointed Gregor Strasser, Otto Strasser and Joseph Goebbels to organise and grow the NSDAP in northern Germany. Gregor Strasser steered a more independent political course, emphasising the socialist elements of the party's programme.|$|E
5|$|Erosion can be {{the result}} of {{material}} movement by the wind. There are two main effects. First, wind causes small particles <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>lifted</b> and therefore moved to another region. This is called deflation. Second, these suspended particles may impact on solid objects causing erosion by abrasion (ecological succession). Wind erosion generally occurs in areas with little or no vegetation, often in areas where there is insufficient rainfall to support vegetation. An example is the formation of sand dunes, on a beach or in a desert. Loess is a homogeneous, typically nonstratified, porous, friable, slightly coherent, often calcareous, fine-grained, silty, pale yellow or buff, windblown (Aeolian) sediment. It generally occurs as a widespread blanket deposit that covers areas of hundreds of square kilometers and tens of meters thick. Loess often stands in either steep or vertical faces. Loess tends to develop into highly rich soils. Under appropriate climatic conditions, areas with loess are among the most agriculturally productive in the world. Loess deposits are geologically unstable by nature, and will erode very readily. Therefore, windbreaks (such as big trees and bushes) are often planted by farmers to reduce the wind erosion of loess.|$|E

5|$|In March 2005 Sihanouk accused Thailand, Laos, and Vietnam of {{encroaching}} into Cambodian territory, through unilateral border demarcation exercises without Cambodian participation. Two months later, Sihanouk {{formed the}} Supreme National Council on Border Affairs (SNCBA), which he headed, {{to address these}} concerns. While the SRP and Chea Sim expressed support for Sihanouk {{for the formation of}} the SNCBA, Hun Sen decided to form a separate body, National Authority on Border Affairs (NABA), to deal with border concerns, with SNCBA to serve only as an advisory body. After Hun Sen signed a border treaty with Vietnam in October 2005, Sihanouk dissolved the SNCBA. In August 2007 the Cambodian Action Committee for Justice and Equity, a US-based human rights NGO, called for Sihanouk's State immunity <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>lifted,</b> so as to allow him to testify in the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia (ECCC). Sihanouk responded to the call by inviting the ECCC public affairs officer, Peter Foster, for a discussion session on his personal experience under the Khmer Rouge regime. Both Hun Sen and FUNCINPEC criticized the suggestion, with the latter accusing the NGO of being disrespectful. The ECCC subsequently rejected Sihanouk's invitation.|$|E
5|$|On 11 May 2010 the FIFA Emergency Committee {{suspended}} the Salvadoran Football Federation (FESFUT) {{on account of}} government interference. This decision by FIFA {{was based on the}} fact that the statutes ratified by the FESFUT general assembly in August 2009 had not been formally entered in the country's official register, and that the government had failed to acknowledge the authority of the Normalisation Committee set up to represent FESFUT. Consequently, FIFA considered that it was not possible for FESFUT to organise the general assembly in line with the action plan that had been drawn up, and suspended FESFUT. For the suspension <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>lifted,</b> Salvadoran authorities needed to recognize the legitimacy of the Normalisation Committee of the Salvadoran Football Association. The suspension was lifted by May 28. By FIFA lifting the suspension, La Selecta was once again allowed to participate in international tournaments at both club and national levels. El Salvador's under-21 team qualified for the 2010 Central American and Caribbean Games (CAC) tournament in Mayagüez, Puerto Rico. However, CONCACAF decided to suspend football at the 2010 CAC shortly thereafter. El Salvador was also able to participate in the qualifying tournament for the 2012 Summer Olympics.|$|E
5|$|The {{wild parsnip}} {{from which the}} modern {{cultivated}} varieties were derived is a plant of dry rough grassland and waste places, particularly on chalk and limestone soils. Parsnips are biennials, but are normally grown as annuals. Sandy and loamy soils are preferable to silt, clay, and stony ground; the latter produces short, forked roots. Parsnip seed significantly deteriorates in viability if stored for long. Seeds are usually planted in early spring, {{as soon as the}} ground can be worked to a fine tilth, in the position where the plants are to grow. The growing plants are thinned and kept weed-free. Harvesting begins in late fall after the first frost, and continues through winter. The rows can be covered with straw to enable the crop <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>lifted</b> during frosty weather. Low soil temperatures cause some of the starches stored in the roots to be converted into sugars, giving them a sweeter taste.|$|E

5|$|The first {{successful}} flight of Zveno-1, using a Tupolev TB-1 mothership and two Tupolev I-4 fighters mounted {{on top of}} the wings, took place on 3 December 1931. An error in the sequence of opening the latches by the bomber crew resulted in one of the fighters prematurely separating, but the TB-1 with an I-4 attached to one of the wings remained in controlled flight and the second fighter was soon uneventfully deployed. After latch control was fully moved into the fighters, the normal launch procedure consisted of pilots opening the tail lock and then pulling on the control stick to open the front locks and separate from the bomber. As predicted, the presence of docked fighters had a minimal impact on performance of the mothership, and Zveno-2 Tupolev TB-3 carrying three Polikarpov I-5 fighters handled the same as an ordinary bomber. To mount the aircraft on the wings, they were pushed up special ramps but the centerline aircraft had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>lifted</b> {{on top of the}} fuselage by hand. This was so cumbersome that the centerline I-5 became a permanent fixture on top of the Zveno-2 TB-3 and never started in the air. At one point, the centerline I-5, still with a pilot at the controls to operate the engine, had the wings and the tail surfaces removed and was used purely as fifth powerplant for the bomber mothership.|$|E
