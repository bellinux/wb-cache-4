5|$|In a flashforward at the prison, Hajj {{brings out}} Reza's brother Hossein Shirazi (Farshad Farahat), and harms him if Reza does not {{cooperate}} in providing information about Bibi. The game returns to Reza and Babak, who {{arrive at the}} rebellion hideout. Reza meets with Abbas, who is convinced {{that one of the}} revolution leaders betrayed and stabbed him, and tasks Reza with discovering the culprit. As he is investigating, Reza is approached by some of the leaders and accused of stabbing Abbas. A brief argument ensues, but is shortly ended as police begin to ambush the hideout. Abbas hurriedly demands an answer from Reza regarding the betrayer, and Reza is forced to decide which of the revolution leaders stabbed Abbas. In a flashforward, Hajj reveals to Reza that he chose <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>person,</b> but they were killed shortly thereafter.|$|E
5|$|Melissa calls Scully {{and tells}} her she is coming over. After {{receiving}} {{a call from}} someone who immediately hangs up, Scully leaves her apartment and tells Melissa that she'll head to her home instead. As she leaves, Skinner pulls up in his car, telling her they need to speak in private. Melissa shows up soon afterwards and is mistakenly shot by Luis Cardinal, who is hiding there with Alex Krycek. Realizing they shot <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>person,</b> the two flee. Meanwhile, after taking Skinner to Mulder's apartment, Scully holds him at gunpoint, believing he is the traitor the Well-Manicured Man spoke of. Skinner tells Scully {{that he is in}} possession of the digital tape. Just then, someone steps outside the door. This distracts Scully enough for Skinner to pull his gun on her.|$|E
5|$|When Terese {{goes through}} a rough patch in her {{marriage}} to Brad (Kip Gamblin), Paul arranges her former boss, Ezra Hanley (Steve Nation), to come to Erinsborough, {{with the intention of}} breaking up the Willis' marriage. However, Ezra tries to force himself on Terese and is fired from Lassiter's. When he tries to sue Paul and Terese, Paul pays Gary Canning (Damien Richardson) to attack Ezra. When Gary confesses to the police, Paul gives him more money to keep quiet about their arrangement. Paul hires Naomi to organise the Erinsborough Festival, two weeks of events celebrating the suburb. Hilary Robinson returns and convinces Paul to reinstate some of the community services. Paul tries to stop Daniel and Amber's wedding by sending Amber away on a photography trip and planning for her flight to be cancelled, so she will not make the wedding. He also asks Des Clarke (Paul Keane) to talk to Daniel about the dangers of marrying <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>person.</b> Imogen Willis (Ariel Kaplan) forces Paul to bring Amber back, but he realises Imogen loves Daniel and tells Amber. Daniel fails to appear for the wedding after he goes looking for Imogen. Paul realises Nina Tucker (Delta Goodrem) is in town and with help from Lou and Karl, he convinces her to sing at the festival's closing concert.|$|E
50|$|The two protagonists {{come close}} to marrying <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>persons</b> in a double wedding, which collapses as a farce when Margarita arrives drunk, and Nacho kisses her in the church during the ceremony, though both were {{supposed}} to marry others. The two brothers have a duel over this.|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} prove themselves, the Stooges {{have to teach}} the ladies jujitsu and do acrobatic tricks. When the real Japanese arrive, the Stooges fight them, but they keep turning the lights on and off, leading them to fight <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>persons.</b> At <b>the</b> end, the Stooges come out victorious.|$|R
5000|$|... 8. Justice {{was based}} on {{complete}} reparation of <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> to <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>wronged.</b> There were 4 crimes against the whole people: Treason, failing to fight, desertion and homosexuality. These were capital offenses.|$|R
25|$|On {{the same}} day, Abdul Karim Tunda {{was thought to}} be arrested in Mombasa, Kenya on suspicions of {{involvement}} in the train bombings. but it was <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>person.</b> He was one of India's most wanted men and also a suspected organiser for the banned Islamic terrorist group Lashkar-e-Taiba. He was arrested in 2013 near the Nepal border.|$|E
25|$|The {{fundamental}} {{theme of}} the opera is the individual terrorist action committed by anyone who believes {{that he or she}} is eliminating an evil by eliminating a person, in most cases <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>person.</b> The work describes three encounters of the Girondin sympathizer Charlotte Corday with Jean-Paul Marat, leading figure of the radical Jacobin faction, two attempts and finally the assassination itself.|$|E
25|$|Whilst in England the Court of Chivalry (which last met in 1954) {{is a civil}} court, in Scotland the Lyon Court meets {{often and}} has {{criminal}} jurisdiction. Lord Lyon is empowered to have assumed coats of arms, and whatever they are affixed to, destroyed. As an example, when Leith Town Hall, now used as a police station, was renovated during the 1990s, several of the coats of arms decorating the Council Chamber {{were found to be}} attributed to <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>person.</b> The police were given special permission to retain the display, on condition that the tourist guides pointed out the historical anomalies.|$|E
6000|$|... 'It is curious, and {{not very}} creditable to our chemists,' Merton said, 'that love philtres were once as common as seidlitz powders, while now we have lost that secret. <b>The</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>persons</b> might drink love philtres, {{as in the case}} of Tristram and Iseult. Or an unskilled rural {{practitioner}} might send out <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> drug, as in the instance of Lucretius, who went mad in consequence.' ...|$|R
25|$|Torts {{and crimes}} at common law {{originate}} in the Germanic system of compensatory fines for wrongs (OE unriht), with no clear distinction between crimes and other wrongs. In Anglo-Saxon law, most wrongs required payment in money or in kind (bōt, literally 'remedy') to <b>the</b> <b>wronged</b> <b>person</b> or their clan. Wīte (literally 'blame, fault') was paid to the king or holder of a court for disturbances of public order.|$|R
6000|$|... "But, sir, father perhaps mightn't choose it." [...] The {{obedience}} {{of women}} to men--to those men to whom they are legally bound--is, I think, the most remarkable trait in human nature. Nothing equals it but the instinctive loyalty of a dog. Of course we hear of gray mares, and of garments worn by <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>persons.</b> Xanthippe doubtless did live, and the character {{from time to time}} is repeated; but the rule, I think, is as I have said.|$|R
25|$|The {{prosecution}} showed video {{evidence from}} {{a post office}} in the city center, where Elgaas was seen paying for the massive amount of giros. Included in this pile, was one {{for a woman who}} had reported AUF to the police in 1995, after she had attempted to leave the organisation nine times. Elgass had stated that he did not 'advance' for people {{who did not want to}} be members of the party. When questioned about the woman, he said that it could happen that they 'advanced' for <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>person.</b> The police had also found Elgsaas' mother's name on two of the giros. Elgsaas explained that he experienced pressure from the leader of AUF, Trond Giske, and the general secretary, Rita Ottervik, to continue with the 'advancements'.|$|E
25|$|Canine {{identification}} of a suspect can help police with their inquiries, and evidence of identification is accepted in some courts. The most approved method of identification is for the hound to jump up, and place its paws on the subject’s chest. In {{the case of a}} lost person or a known fugitive identification will not be significant, {{and in the case of}} a potentially violent, possibly armed, fugitive a bloodhound handler will not want his dog to approach the quarry for fear of injury to the bloodhound. Many bloodhounds reaching the end of a trail will show no interest in the person they have been trailing, and are difficult to train to identify. Leon Whitney recommended a method of initial training in which identification was the first thing learned, based on giving the young hound a scent-article from someone who walks a very short distance out of sight into a barn, where he stands with a piece of liver, while another person, also smelling of liver, stands nearby. The hound is led along the 'trail', and if it shows an inclination to go to <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>person</b> it is chastised, but gets the liver if it goes to the right one. When the hound goes to the right person almost infallibly, the number of people is increased, making the choice more difficult, and eventually the brief walks are extended into full trails.|$|E
500|$|Furious that <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>person</b> was murdered, the Syndicate {{demands that}} the Smoking Man produce the tape. The Smoking Man {{promises}} to do so the following day. Meanwhile, Mulder and Scully visit Klemper, who says that the photo was taken at a former mining facility in West Virginia. After the agents leave, Klemper calls the Well-Manicured Man and informs him that Mulder is alive. The news causes the Syndicate to further mistrust the Smoking Man. Meanwhile, at the hospital, Albert Hosteen visits Melissa while a suited man loiters nearby.|$|E
50|$|Eater of Hearts (The Tower 7, p. 383) is a {{reference}} to Ammit, a female figure from Egyptian mythology who was the personification of divine retribution for all <b>the</b> <b>wrongs</b> a <b>person</b> had done {{in his or her}} life.|$|R

2500|$|As a {{psychological}} concept and virtue, {{the benefits of}} forgiveness have been explored in religious thought, {{the social sciences and}} medicine. Forgiveness may be considered simply in terms of the person who forgives including forgiving themselves, in terms of the person forgiven or in terms {{of the relationship between the}} forgiver and the person forgiven. In most contexts, forgiveness is granted without any expectation of restorative justice, and without any response on the part of the offender (for example, one may forgive a person who is [...] or dead). In practical terms, it may be necessary for the offender to offer some form of acknowledgment, an , or even just ask for forgiveness, in order for <b>the</b> <b>wronged</b> <b>person</b> to believe himself able to forgive.|$|R
500|$|Connelly's {{portrayal}} of Sarah polarized critics and received strong criticism from some reviewers. Critic Kirk Honeycutt referred to Connelly as [...] "a bland and minimally talented young actress" [...] Writing for The Miami News, Jon Marlowe stated, [...] "Connelly is simply <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>person</b> {{for the right}} job. She has a squeaky voice that begins to grate on you; when she cries, {{you can see the}} onions in her eyes." [...] Contrary to these negative views, an anonymous review in St. Petersburg Times praised her acting saying, [...] "Connelly makes the entire experience seem real. She acts so naturally around the puppets that you begin to believe in their life-like qualities." ...|$|E
500|$|Publishers Weekly {{noted that}} themes such as family, {{friendship}} and responsibility are also {{taught in the}} warrior code, the set of rules that the Clans must follow. Holmes has {{said that one of}} her favorite things about writing the series is being able to add in themes that apply to us all such as family, loss, honor, bravery, death, loyalty, and following rules. Other themes include [...] "death and spirituality and family and relationships". She also added in human themes such as [...] "starting at a new school (Rusty joining ThunderClan), falling in love with <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>person</b> (Graystripe and Silverstream) and being bullied by someone who should look after you (Tigerclaw bullying Ravenpaw)". To a reviewer for Kirkus Reviews, the human theme of fitting in was easily found and applauded when Rusty succeeds.|$|E
500|$|Whether {{or not a}} work is {{attributed}} to <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>person</b> depends on, according to Clark v Associated Newspapers, [...] "the single meaning which... the work conveys to the notional reasonable reader". There {{is no need to}} prove that the false attribution caused any harm to the actual author, and the right has been interpreted to cover situations as diverse as a newspaper parody of Alan Clark's diaries, an interview with Dorothy Squires and a replica painting that contained the signature of the original author. The right is closely linked to passing off, defamation and other non-statutory causes of action, which may be used to supplement a claim for infringing the right to object to false attribution. David Vaver, writing in the International Journal of Law and Information Technology, goes as {{far as to say that}} the right to object to false attribution is merely [...] "passing off, writ large". Cornish, Llewelyn and Aplin also note a strong overlap between the rights against false attribution and against derogatory treatment.|$|E
60|$|This dreadful day at last passed, {{followed}} by as dreadful a night, {{and then another}} day equally gloomy, equally silent, equally panic-stricken. Even insurrection {{would have been a}} relief amid the horrible and wearing suspense. On the third day the government made some wild arrests of <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>persons,</b> and then came out a fresh proclamation from the Revolutionary Committee, directing the Romans to make no move until the advanced guard of Garibaldi had appeared upon Monte Mario. About this time the routed troops of the pope arrived in confusion from Viterbo, and of course extenuated their discomfiture by exaggerating the strength of their opponents. According to them, they had encountered not less than ten thousand men, who now; having joined the still greater force of Garibaldi, were in full march on the city.|$|R

In Anglo-Saxon law, most wrongs required payment in money or in kind (bōt, literally 'remedy') to <b>the</b> <b>wronged</b> <b>person</b> or their clan. Wīte (literally 'blame, fault') was paid to the king or holder of a court for disturbances of public order.Weregild, which was a murder fine based on a victim's worth, was intended to prevent blood feuds. Some wrongs in later law codes were botleas 'without remedy' (e.g. theft, open murder, arson, treason against one's lord), that is, unable to be compensated, and those convicted of a botleas crime were at the king's mercy. Items or creatures which caused death were also destroyed as deodands. Assessing intention was a matter for the court, but Alfred the Great's Doom book did distinguish unintentional injuries from intentional ones, whereas culpability depended on status, age, and gender.|$|R
500|$|By 2003, she {{was being}} {{recognised}} around the world from countries like Portugal and Japan. She said of her private life: [...] "I don't really have a private life. I've found it difficult as an athlete, to maintain a relationship. It's not {{one of my best}} points but I've got family and friends who compensate for that. When I was younger I went out and had a lot of fun, and there were moments when people criticised me for that, and you know what, I'm young, I'm going to do that, and anyone who is going to get on me for that ... I really didn't care." [...] She does not like to go clubbing for two reasons: First, she gets recognised by too many people. [...] Second, everyone wants to comment on her height. In response to getting a hug from Yao Ming at the 2008 Summer Olympics during the closing ceremonies, internet rumours started that Jackson and the married Ming were romantically involved. [...] These rumours were incorrect. [...] Jackson said of them: [...] "When we came across this Yao Ming thing it was like, 'Oh...My...God! When I tell you we were in hysterics...because anybody who knows me knows that would be the last thing on my mind. A 7 foot 8 Chinese man? That's just not my thing. I really respect him as a player. And people who know me know I can be wild and over-the-top. I'm affectionate and that night I guess I was affectionate with <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>person.</b> I guess the Chinese people don't do that stuff very often, so the cultural [...] was a big thing. But I don't care. You have to laugh about things or you'll be crying, which I would probably have been doing anyway [...] I made the most of my last night at the Olympics and had a great time." [...] She partied a fair amount in her early 20s. By 2010, she was not able to stay out at night clubs until 5:30am any more because she lacked the stamina.|$|E
2500|$|There {{can also}} be an element of {{political}} or ideological bias {{on all sides of}} scientific debates. Sometimes, research may be characterized as [...] "bad science," [...] research that may be well-intended but is actually incorrect, obsolete, incomplete, or over-simplified expositions of scientific ideas.

60|$|Had the {{situation}} of Doctor Heaton been more pleasant than it was, {{it is probable that}} the step taken by himself, his wife, and Bridget, would never have been thought of. But it was highly unpleasant. He was poor, and dependent altogether on his practice for a support. Now, it was in Doctor Woolston's power to be of great service to the young couple, by introducing the son-in-law to his own patients, but this he could not think of doing with a depletionist; and John, as Anne affectionately styled her husband, was left to starve on his system of depletion. Such was the state of things when Bob appeared in Bristol, to announce to the young wife not only the existence but the deserted and lone condition of her husband. The honest fellow knew there was something clandestine about the marriage, and he used proper precautions not to betray his presence to <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>persons.</b> By means of a little management he saw Bridget privately, and told his story. As Bob had been present at the wedding, and was known to stand high in Mark's favour, he was believed, quite as a matter of course, and questioned in a thousand ways, until the poor fellow had not really another syllable to communicate.|$|R
50|$|Once {{they are}} {{satisfied}} {{that they have}} a culprit, the detective has the option of accusing them directly, or waiting until enough clues are found to prove their hunch. If they are <b>wrong,</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> they have accused will not speak to them {{for the remainder of the}} game. A denial does not always mean <b>the</b> detective is <b>wrong,</b> only that more proof is required for the murderer to confess.|$|R
2500|$|Johnston {{lived alone}} and {{had lived in}} that house for about 17 years. Her house was in a crime-ridden {{neighborhood}} in west Atlanta. People in the neighborhood speculated {{that the police had}} <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>person,</b> but police denied that they had the wrong house. Neighbors and family said that Johnston kept a [...] "rusty revolver" [...] for self-defense; another elderly woman in her neighborhood had recently been raped, and drug dealing was common. In the year before her death, Johnston had installed extra locks and burglar bars.|$|E
2500|$|From this, Breyer {{concluded}} that the [...] "intense community pressure" [...] involved in capital cases {{increases the likelihood of}} convicting <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>person.</b> Breyer was also concerned the search for a death-qualified jury might cause bias. Breyer further questioned the reliability of forensic testimony, citing problems with hair analysis. Breyer cited one study concluding that 4% of those sentenced to death are actually innocent. Regardless of the actual innocence of the accused, Breyer cited research identifying prejudicial error in 68% of capital cases. Breyer then included editorials by former Virginia Attorney General Mark Earley rejecting the death penalty.|$|E

60|$|God did {{not wish}} them, or us, to give up Christmas mirth. The apostles {{did not wish}} it. The great men, true {{followers}} of the apostles, who shaped our Prayer-book for us, and sealed it with their life-blood, did not wish it. They did not wish farmers, labourers, servants, masters, to give {{up one of the}} old Christmas customs; but to remember who made Christmas, and its blessings; in short, to rejoice in The Lord. Our forefathers had been thanking <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>persons</b> for Christmas. Henceforward we were to thank the right person, The Lord, and rejoice in Him. Our forefathers had been rejoicing in the sun, and moon, and earth; in wise and valiant kings who had lived ages before; in their own strength, and industry, and cunning. Now they were to rejoice in Him who made sun, and moon, and earth; in Him who sent wise and valiant kings and leaders; in Him who gives all strength, and industry, and cunning; by whose inspiration comes all knowledge of agriculture, and manufacture, and all the arts which raise men above the beasts that perish. So their Christmas joys were to go on, year by year while the world lasted: but they were to go on rightly, and not wrongly. Men were to rejoice in The Lord, and then His blessing would be on them, and the thanks and praise which they offered Him, He would return with interest, in fresh blessings for the coming year.|$|R
