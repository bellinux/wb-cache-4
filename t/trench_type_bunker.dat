40|$|Although a {{substantial}} literature exists on vessel-accident oil spills, {{little attention has}} been given to bunker spills from non-oil-cargo vessels. This paper investigates determinants of the bunker spillage from non-oil-cargo vessel accidents. The amount of vessel-accident bunker spillage is posited to be a function of vessel <b>type,</b> hull <b>type,</b> <b>bunker</b> fuel <b>type,</b> visibility at time of accident, type of vessel accident, and vessel operation phase. The function is estimated utilizing tobit regression and detailed data of individual non-oil-cargo vessel accidents that were investigated by the U. S. Coast Guard during the 8 -year time period 2001 - 2008. The results suggest that a greater quantity of vessel-accident bunker fuel will be spilled when the vessel is abandoned, if the accident occurred at night, and when the vessel is adrift. Freight ships and offshore supply vessels spill more bunker fuel than passenger vessels in accidents. As expected, the size of a bunker spill from non-oil-cargo vessel accidents is smaller than the size of an oil-cargo spill from a tank barge accident.

There are several papers that show the advantages of the CLPSM compared to the other types of RET. Also the required design changes have been widely studied. Manufacturing of CLPSM requires quartz etching additionally to the COG mask process. Contrary to CLPSM, the required characteristics of the quartz etching process for altPSM are well specified. However, the required quality of the etching process for the CLPSM has not been sufficiently evaluated yet. In this paper, the impact of imperfections of the mask manufacturing process, like the effect of quartz sidewall profile, etch depth deviation and quartz trenching during quartz dry etching on mask imaging performance is investigated. Simulations were performed using Solid-CTM to investigate these effects for both mesa and <b>trench</b> <b>type</b> CLPSM for different pitches.
