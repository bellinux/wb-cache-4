40|$|Green {{manuring}} puts humus {{into the}} soil {{and that makes it}} an important farm practice, because humus is absolutely essential for the best growth of crops. Humus may be added in another way, by applying barnyard manure, but that method alone will not keep the soil from losing fertility from year to year. Even though it is saved with the utmost care, the manure produced on the farm will not return to the soil all the fertility removed by the crops. Circular No. 9, 2 ̆ 2 Farm Manures, 2 ̆ 2 Iowa Agricultural Experiment Station, shows furthermore, that there are certain unavoidable losses in the storing of manure and that they may involve not only the valuable mineral constituents, but also the organic matter. As agriculture is now generally practiced in Iowa and elsewhere, the soil is being gradually worn out. It is clear, therefore, that some other means must be employed to keep up the humus content of soils and this may be accomplished by <b>turning</b> <b>under</b> green <b>manure</b> crops...|$|R
40|$|Green <b>manuring</b> means <b>turning</b> <b>under</b> {{suitable}} {{crops to}} enrich the soil. Such crops may be <b>turned</b> <b>under</b> green or when ripe. Green manuring adds organic matter and, directly or indirectly, nitrogen to the soil. Leguminous crops are most desirable for green manuring, since they add to the soil nitrogen gathered from the air {{in addition to the}} organic matter which they carry. Besides the nitrogen in the legumes <b>turned</b> <b>under,</b> an additional supply of nitrogen is fixed in the soil by the action of bacteria, using the carbon in the organic matter as a source of energy. <b>Turning</b> <b>under</b> an entire crop is advised only when the soil is poor and for the purpose of starting a rotation. <b>Turning</b> <b>under</b> catch crops or winter-grown green crops is an economical and successful method of supplying nitrogen.

40|$|Intensifying {{livestock}} production {{to meet the}} demands of a growing global population coincides with increases in both the administration of veterinary antibiotics and manure inputs to soils. These trends have the potential to increase antibiotic resistance in soil microbial communities. The effect of maintaining increased antibiotic resistance on soil microbial communities and the ecosystem processes they regulate is unknown. We compare soil microbial communities from paired reference and dairy manure-exposed sites across the US. Given that manure exposure has been shown to elicit increased antibiotic resistance in soil microbial communities, we expect that manure-exposed sites will exhibit 1) compositionally different soil microbial communities, with shifts toward taxa known to exhibit resistance; 2) greater abundance of antibiotic resistance genes; and 3) corresponding maintenance of antibiotic resistance would lead to decreased microbial efficiency. We found that bacterial and fungal communities differed between reference and manure-exposed sites. Additionally, β-lactam resistance gene ampC was 5. 2 -fold greater <b>under</b> <b>manure</b> exposure, potentially due to the use of cephalosporin antibiotics in dairy herds. Finally, ampC abundance was positively correlated with indicators of microbial stress, and microbial mass-specific respiration, which increased 2. 1 -fold <b>under</b> <b>manure</b> exposure. These findings demonstrate that the maintenance of antibiotic resistance associated with manure inputs alters soil microbial communities and ecosystem function...|$|R

40|$|A field {{experiment}} {{was conducted at}} the Federal University of Agriculture, Abeokuta, South West Nigeria, to {{determine the influence of}} Bradyrhizobium and mycorrhiza on growth, yield and phosphorus use efficiency of soybean (Glycine max L.) <b>under</b> <b>manure</b> application. The treatments consisted of three factors, Bradyrhizobium (with or without), Phosphorus source (Single super phosphate) and poultry manure (0, 5, 10 ton/ha). The variety of soybean worked on was TX 1448 - 2 E. The influence of these treatments on plant height shows, poultry manure of 0, 5 and 10 ton/ha had no significant difference at 4 – 12 week after planting (WAP) but at 14 WAP plots which received 0 ton/ha had highest values. Also, for Phosphorus source, they shows no differences at 6 WAP while at 4, 8, 10, 12 and 14 WAP plants that received mycorrhiza shows a greater influence on the plant height. Plot with Bradyrhizobium show no differences at 4 and 14 WAP. The application of mycorrhiza as a P source had great influence on soybean production <b>under</b> <b>manure</b> application. Also, the use of poultry manure had an influence on soybean at 5 - 10 ton/ha. Similarly, on Phosphorus use efficiency, the application of the treatments shows significant differences at 6 WAP where plots that received mycorrhiza with 10 ton/ha of poultry manure showed higher values at p < 0. 05. However, {{there were no significant differences}} on the treatments at 8 WAP, but plots that received Bradyrhizobium, mycorrhiza with 10 tons of poultry manure showed higher values at p< 0. 05...|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} tillage system and {{fertilization}} regimes on weed flora in quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa Willd.) {{were evaluated by}} means of two field experiments in 2011 and 2012. The experiments were {{laid out in a}} split-plot design with two main plots (conventional and minimum tillage) and four sub-plots (fertilization regimes). The results indicated that weed biomass and density in quinoa were influenced by the different fertilization and tillage treatments. Moreover, seed yield in conventional was 5 %– 13 % higher than that of minimum tillage, probably due to the lower weed density and biomass. Concerning fertilization treatments, total weed density and biomass increased <b>under</b> <b>manure</b> application and inorganic fertilization. Tillage effects on weeds were species specific. The density of perennial weeds such as purple nutsedge (Cyperus rotundus L.) and the density of small-seeded weeds such as redroot pigweed (Amaranthus retroflexus L.) and common purslane (Portulaca oleracea L.) were significantly lower under the conventional tillage than under the minimum tillage system. © 2015 Taylor & Francis...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{designed}} to fill a gap in the literature on attentional focus and sports performance. Specifically, in contrast to most previous studies in which an external focus was directed at an implement, we used a gymnastics skill that did not involve the use of an implement. Furthermore, while most studies used only outcome measures of performance, we also assessed movement quality. Twelve-year-old gymnasts performed a maximum vertical jump with a 180 -degree turn while airborne, with their hands crossing in front of their chest during the <b>turn</b> <b>under</b> three different focus conditions. Under the external focus condition, participants were asked to focus on the direction in which a tape marker, which was attached to their chest, was pointing after the <b>turn.</b> <b>Under</b> the internal focus condition, they were asked to focus on the direction in which their hands were pointing after the <b>turn.</b> <b>Under</b> the control condition, no focus instructions were given. The external focus condition resulted in both superior movement form and greater jump height than did the other two conditions, which produced comparable results. The present findings show that, similar to other tasks, the performance of form-based skills can be enhanced relatively easily by appropriate external focus instructions...|$|R
