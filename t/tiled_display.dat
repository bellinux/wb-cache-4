50|$|Stallion is a 328 {{megapixel}} <b>tiled</b> <b>display</b> system, {{with over}} 150 times {{the resolution of}} a standard HD display, it is among the highest pixel count displays in the world. The cluster provides users {{with the ability to}} display high-resolution visualizations on a large 16x5 <b>tiled</b> <b>display</b> of 30-inch Dell monitors. This configuration allows for an exploration of visualizations at an extremely high level of detail and quality compared to a typical moderate pixel count projector. The cluster allows users access to over 82GB of graphics memory, and 240 processing cores. This configuration enables the processing of datasets of a massive scale, and the interactive visualization of substantial geometries. A 36TB shared file system is available to enable the storage of tera-scale size datasets.|$|E
50|$|A render farm is {{different}} from a render wall, which is a networked, <b>tiled</b> <b>display</b> used for real-time rendering. The rendering of images is a highly parallelizable activity, as frames and sometimes tiles can be calculated independently of the others, with the main communication between processors being the upload of the initial source material, such as models and textures, and the download of the finished images.|$|E

50|$|DisplayPort 1.3 {{added support}} for 5K at 60 Hz over a single cable, whereas DisplayPort 1.2 was only capable of 5K at 30 Hz. Early 5K 60 Hz {{displays}} {{such as the}} Dell UltraSharp UP2715K and HP DreamColor Z27q that lacked DisplayPort 1.3 support required two DisplayPort 1.2 connections to operate at 60 Hz, in a <b>tiled</b> <b>display</b> mode similar to early 4K displays using DP MST.|$|E
5000|$|The {{latest version}} 1.3 (announced on 23 September 2013) adds {{enhanced}} support for <b>tiled</b> <b>display</b> topologies; it allows better identification of multiple video streams, and reports bezel size and locations. [...] As of December 2013, many current 4K displays use a tiled topology, but lack a standard way {{to report to}} the video source which tile is left and which is right. These early 4K displays, for manufacturing reasons, typically use two 1920×2160 panels laminated together and are currently generally treated as multiple-monitor setups. DisplayID 1.3 also allows 8K display discovery, and has applications in stereo 3D, where multiple video streams are used.|$|E

40|$|We {{present the}} Scalable Adaptive Graphics Environment (SAGE), a {{graphics}} streaming architecture for supporting collaborative scientific visualization environments with potentially hundreds of megapixels of contiguous display resolution. In collaborative scientific visualization {{it is crucial}} to share high resolution visualizations as well as high definition video among groups of collaborators at local or remote sites. Our network-centered architecture allows collaborators to simultaneously run multiple visualization applications on local or remote clusters and share the visualizations by streaming the pixels of each application over ultra high speed networks to large <b>tiled</b> <b>displays.</b> This streaming architecture is designed such that the output of arbitrary M by N pixel rendering cluster nodes can be streamed to X by Y pixel display screens allowing for userdefinable layouts on the display. This dynamic pixel routing capability of our architecture allows users to freely move and resize each application’s imagery over the <b>tiled</b> <b>displays</b> in runtime, tightly synchronizing the multiple visualization streams to form a single stream. Experimental results show that our architecture can support visualization at multi-ten-megapixel resolution with reasonable frame rates using gigabit networks...|$|R

40|$|Ultra-high-resolution <b>tiled</b> <b>display</b> {{walls are}} {{typically}} {{driven by a}} cluster of computers. Each computer may drive one or more displays. Synchronization between the computers is necessary to ensure that animated imagery displayed on the wall appears seamless. Most <b>tiled</b> <b>display</b> middleware systems are designed around the assumption that only a single application instance is running in the <b>tiled</b> <b>display</b> at a time, therefore synchronization can be achieved with a simple solution such as a networked barrier. When a <b>tiled</b> <b>display</b> has to support multiple applications at the same time, the simple networked barrier approach does not scale. In this paper we propose and experimentally validate two synchronization algorithms to achieve low-latency inter-tile synchronization for multiple applications with independently varying frame-rates. The Two-Phase algorithm is more generally applicable to various high-resolution <b>tiled</b> <b>display</b> systems. The One-Phase algorithm provides superior results but requires the support for NTP, and is more CPU-intensive...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{highlights}} the technical challenges {{of creating an}} application that combines a multithreaded scene graph system for rendering with a software environment for management of <b>tiled</b> <b>display</b> environments. Scene graph systems simplify and streamline graphics applications by providing data management and rendering services. Software for <b>tiled</b> <b>display</b> environ-ments simplifies use of multiple displays by performing such tasks as opening windows on displays, gathering and processing input device events, and orchestrating the execution of application rendering code. We explore technical issues {{in the context of}} an application that integrates both software tools, and formulate suggestions for the future development of such systems. 1. BACKGROUND A <b>tiled</b> <b>display</b> environment is a single logical display composed of one more physical display devices. We use the term <b>tiled</b> <b>display</b> environment, or <b>tiled</b> <b>display,</b> to refer to surround-style systems, like the CAVE [1], and high-resolution projector arrays, such as the Powerwall [2]. In this discussion, we use the term host environment to refer to the software that performs <b>tiled</b> <b>display</b> device management. During our work, we explored the use of two such host environments, CAVELib 1 and the Virtual Display Library (VDL) [3]. In this study, we discuss both systems in general terms, and present a case study using VDL. CAVELib and VDL share a similar design that make it easy to write reasonably portable applications that use multiple dis...|$|E

Without compromising display resolution, a scalable solution for building <b>tiled</b> <b>display</b> walls is proposed. Herein, each display node is solely equipped with an Internet protocol (IP) connection. As display nodes are independently free running, synchronization is required at the display refresh level and regarding the content. In this paper, {{we focus on the}} aspect of network forwarding delay estimation, which ultimately determines the accuracy of display phase synchronization of a <b>tiled</b> <b>display</b> wall following the Reverse Genlock paradigm as proposed by the authors earlier. We show that in both switched and shared medium networks, forwarding delay may be estimated with microsecond accuracy...|$|E

These resources encompass both hardware and software, and include: Stallion, {{among the highest}} resolution <b>tiled</b> <b>displays</b> in the world; Longhorn, the largest hardware accelerated, remote, interactive visualization cluster; and the Longhorn Visualization Portal, an internet gateway to the Longhorn cluster and an easy-to-use interface for scientific visualization.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we present the multi-display {{environment}} Deskotheque, which combines personal and <b>tiled</b> projected <b>displays</b> into a continuous teamspace. Its main distinguishing factor is a fine-grained spatial (i. e., both geometric and topological) {{model of the}} display layout. Using this model, Deskotheque allows seamless mouse pointer navigation and application window sharing across the multi-display environment. Geometric compensation of casually aligned multi-projector displays supports {{a wide range of}} display configurations. Mouse pointer redirection and window migration are tightly integrated into the windowing system, while geometric compensation of projected imagery is accomplished by a 3 D compositing window manager. Thus, Deskotheque provides sharing of unmodified desktop application windows across display and workstation boundaries without compromising hardware-accelerated rendering of 2 D or 3 D content on projected <b>tiled</b> <b>displays</b> with geometric compensation...|$|R

They define experiments to measure synchronization mismatch perception between individual tiles. Besides helping construction of low cost tile systems by using a distributed synchronization mechanism for bezeled displays, this work can further benefit the standardization of subjective experiments when multiple panels are used [5].|$|R
30|$|As an {{extension}} of the desktop <b>display</b> environment, <b>tiled</b> <b>displays</b> are still an emerging technology for constructing custom-made visualization environments capable of displaying high-resolution images and visualizing complex data. Tiled display technologies offer a wide range of opportunities for exploring scalable large displays for high-resolution scientific visualization. A high-resolution display wall can show the details much more clearly than a low-resolution display of the same physical size that could be critical in decision making and scientific discovery. These next-generation tiled-display walls are increasingly becoming affordable for building visualization display environments.|$|R

40|$|Implementation of stereo tiled {{displays}} is {{a rather}} demanding task. In this article we want to share the lessons we have learned during the design and construction of the ICWall <b>tiled</b> <b>display.</b> This large display, used in a classroom setting, is a high-resolution stereo <b>tiled</b> <b>display</b> (2 × 8 tiles), built from low-cost commodity components. The overall image is produced by an array of projectors. When building such a system, a key challenge is to align the projector images. We describe our automated approach for alignment/calibration of the left- and right-eye stereo images. We provide measurements that show accuracy of this procedure. We explain and compare two calibration approaches; a single-pass and a two-pass rendering method to align the tiled images. We explain how to provide seamless image on the <b>tiled</b> <b>display</b> and which issues have to be solved. We also discuss the depth perception issues on the ICWall for the large audiences. Another important aspect, is {{the architecture of the}} software used for PC-cluster-based rendering.

40|$|We {{propose a}} {{conceptual}} model towards a context-based attentive interaction. Our focus {{is to improve}} the interaction between the user and the application of large <b>tiled</b> <b>display</b> by introducing user context and user attention. Interaction in our proposed system adapts user’s visual attention region with the user’s changing context based on head movement to achieve an immersive interaction with the tile display. Our experiment uses computer vision to track the user’s presence and projects the most attentive regions in a <b>tiled</b> <b>display</b> in high resolution. User {{will be able to see}} other regions in higher resolution according to the head movement. At the same time, user attention is captured and modeled to learn the attentive regions to be displayed for other users. This paper will show the experimental result of the effectiveness of the perceptual interaction in a large <b>tiled</b> <b>display</b> environment...|$|E
30|$|This can be {{observed}} by comparing the DSIS scores for Figures 10 (a)– 10 (c) to those from Figures 10 (d)– 10 (f), respectively. In general, people prefer a <b>tiled</b> <b>display</b> with smaller or no bezels. Our results show that a <b>tiled</b> <b>display</b> system which has bezels can allow a more lax synchronization among tiles compared to one without bezels. The results in terms of lower distortion visibility for the bezels case corresponds well with that from standard spatial vernier acuity threshold elevation as gap width increases.|$|E

The display geometry is changed by tilting {{one of the}} projectors on its side. Camera-based geometric registration has the enitre display back in seamless operation in less than one minute. Computer graphics and high-resolution digital imagery are becoming increasingly pervasive in communities not traditionally associated with graphics. Commodity graphics cards and digital cameras, along with powerful software allow organizations such as libraries, museums, and small businesses to produce expressive and realistic computer generated imagery, far surpassing the capabilities of current desktop monitors. What remains elusive to these groups is access to affordable {{and easy to use}} large format display technology. We present a practical system for deploying flexible projectorbased <b>tiled</b> <b>displays.</b> Our framework integrates robust selfcalibrating real-time geometric correction with recent advances in PC-cluster distributed rendering to provide an entirely commoditybased display system that is simple to deploy and operate. The display geometry is easy to configure and reconfigure, accommodates casually tiled projectors and arbitrary display surfaces, and can be operational in a matter of minutes. In addition, the display is transparent to existing OpenGL applications, requiring no custom APIs or re-compilation of existing OpenGL executables. In short, we present a practical and relatively inexpensive system for building flexible <b>tiled</b> <b>displays...</b>|$|R
40|$|New display {{principles}} aim at supreme image quality. The temporal {{aspects of}} these devices sometimes remain underexposed in the literature, and the paper presents an overview of new artifacts and possible remedies with signal processing. We discuss typical artifacts due to the unfavourable properties of emerging television displays. We introduce a processing model that eliminates or at least reduces the various artifacts that result from temporal imperfections of CRTs with alternative scanning, liquid crystal <b>displays</b> (LCDs), <b>tiled</b> <b>displays,</b> plasma display panels (PDPs), and colour sequential displays. We conclude that knowledge of the motion in the scene, i. e. motion estimation, is essential to at least partially repair the often unfavourable temporal behaviour of these displays. Such repair is realistic, as these displays have appeared on the market at the moment motion vector estimation has come to maturity for consumer applications...|$|R
30|$|The {{aforementioned}} 3 D {{interaction techniques}} that utilise direct touch are all limited by display size. When the display exceeds a certain size threshold, touch input starts to become cumbersome. The user {{is required to}} cover a large area with physical movements {{and parts of the}} display area are out of arm’s reach. This is the case with large <b>tiled</b> <b>displays,</b> or those using projectors. In addition, physically approaching the display limits the user’s activity to a very small area while in collaborative systems the interacting user obstructs the view {{for the rest of the}} group.|$|R

Software {{to drive them}} needs to scale too if arbitrarily large displays are to be built. Chromium is a popular software API used to construct such displays. Chromium transparently renders any OpenGL application to a <b>tiled</b> <b>display</b> by partitioning and sending individual OpenGL primitives to each client per frame. Visualization applications often deal with massive geometric data with millions of primitives. Transmitting them every frame results in huge network requirements that adversely affects the scalability of the system. In this paper, we present Garuda, a client-server based display wall framework that uses off-the-shelf hardware and a standard network. Garuda is scalable to large tile configurations and massive environments. It can transparently render any application built using the Open Scene Graph (OSG) API to a <b>tiled</b> <b>display</b> without any modificatio...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—New {{scalable}} {{display system}} in a ubiquitous Grid networking (uGrid) called scale-free display system is proposed. <b>Tiled</b> <b>display</b> system which can visualize large high-resolution images has been becoming famous. However, the more display size grow large, the more hard to establish the system. Also, a study of widely distributed computing or uGrid has been growing. In this paper, we propose scale-free display system under distributed computing network and optical broad band network. In proposed system, computing resources are widely distributed in the network, so distances from each computing resource to the <b>tiled</b> <b>display</b> are different. Thus, to synchronize all frames of image, computing resources which have almost same delay to the <b>tiled</b> <b>display</b> have to be selected in case that the system starts. For this reason, we consider the method to select the computing resources. Also we examine the characteristic of delay in power-law network {{under the assumption that}} the proposed system will be applied to power-law network. I...|$|E
40|$|We {{address the}} problem of {{calibrating}} the colors of a multiple projector <b>tiled</b> <b>display.</b> Differences in the characteristics of the projectors lead to varying color and intensity among the tiles of the display. These differences do generally not only arise between two different projectors, but also between different spatial locations on the projected surface of one single projector. In this paper, we present two algorithms for calibrating the colors of a <b>tiled</b> <b>display.</b> The first method is an automatic procedure to make the luminance uniform over the projected surface of one single beamer, using a common digital camera as a luminance measuring device. The second method aims at uniformizing the colors of multiple projectors by computing the set of color commonly displayable by all the beamers (the common gamut). We show how to find an optimal color gamut displayable by all the projectors in linear time, and derive the color conversion from one color gamut to the common gamut. We successfully tested the method on a <b>tiled</b> <b>display</b> made of 48 projectors with large chrominance shifts...|$|E

To color balance the display, each projector must be characterized and mapped to a common gamut. Projectors with three imaging elements and three filters can be characterized by a simple extension to the monitor calibration model. However, projectors with a single micro-mirror array and a color wheel may include a “white printer ” to increase the system luminance. This makes the characterization more complex.
