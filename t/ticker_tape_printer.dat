50|$|The {{machines}} {{printed a}} series of ticker symbols (usually shortened forms of a company's name), followed by brief information {{about the price of}} that company's stock; the thin strip of paper on which they were printed was called <b>ticker</b> <b>tape.</b> The word <b>ticker</b> comes from the distinct tapping (or ticking) noise the machines made while printing. Pulses on the telegraph line made a letter wheel turn step by step until the correct symbol was reached and then printed. A typical 32-symbol letter wheel had to turn on average 15 steps until the next letter could be printed resulting in a very slow printing speed of one character per second. In 1883, ticker transmitter keyboards resembled the keyboard of a piano with black keys indicating letters and the white keys indicating numbers and fractions, corresponding to two rotating type wheels in the connected <b>ticker</b> <b>tape</b> <b>printers.</b>|$|R

25|$|<b>Ticker</b> <b>tape</b> is a {{means of}} {{transmitting}} stock price information over telegraph lines. It consists of a paper strip which ran through a machine called a stock ticker, which printed abbreviated company symbols followed by price and volume information. <b>Ticker</b> <b>tape</b> was invented in 1867 by Edward A.

5000|$|In New York City, <b>ticker</b> <b>tape</b> parades are {{reserved}} for special occasions. Soon after the first such parade in 1886, city officials realized the utility of such events and began to hold them on triumphal occasions, such as the return of Theodore Roosevelt from his African safari, Gertrude Ederle swimming the English Channel, and Charles Lindbergh's trans-Atlantic flight. The first individual to be honored with a <b>ticker</b> <b>tape</b> parade was Admiral George Dewey, hero {{of the battle of}} Manila Bay, in 1899, when two million people came out to New York City. Following World War II, several <b>ticker</b> <b>tape</b> parades were given in honor of victorious generals and admirals, including General Dwight D. Eisenhower and Admiral Chester Nimitz. Two of the longest and largest <b>ticker</b> <b>tape</b> parades were given for World War II and Korean War General Douglas MacArthur in 1951, after he was relieved of duty by President Harry S. Truman, and for astronaut John Glenn in 1962.|$|R

40|$|A {{fundamental}} {{question in the}} field of synesthesia is whether it is associated with other cognitive phenomena. The current study examined synesthesia’s connections with phenomenal traits of mirror-touch and <b>ticker</b> <b>tape</b> experiences, as well as the representation of the three phenomena in the population, across gender and domain of work/study. Mirror-touch is the automatic, involuntary experience of tactile sensation on one&# 39;s own body when others are being touched. For example, seeing another person’s arm being stroked can evoke physical touch sensation on one’s own arm. <b>Ticker</b> <b>tape</b> is the automatic visualization of spoken words or thoughts, such as a teleprompter. For example, when spoken to, a ticker taper might see mentally the spoken words displayed {{in front of his face}} or as coming out of the speaker’s mouth. To explore synesthesia’s associations with these phenomena, a diverse group (n= 3, 743) was systematically recruited from eight universities and one public museum in France to complete an online screening. Of the 1, 017 eligible respondents, synesthetes (across all subtypes) reported higher rates of mirror-touch and <b>ticker</b> <b>tape</b> than non-synesthetes, suggesting that synesthesia is associated with these phenomenal traits. However effect size was small and we could not rule out that response bias influenced these associations. Mirror-touch and <b>ticker</b> <b>tape</b> were independent. No differences were found across gender or domain of work and study in prevalence of synesthesia, mirror-touch or <b>ticker</b> <b>tape.</b> The prevalence of <b>ticker</b> <b>tape,</b> unknown so far, was estimated at about 7 %, an intermediate rate between estimates of grapheme-color (2 to 4 %) and sequence-space synesthesia (9 to 14 %). Within synesthesia, grapheme-personification, also called ordinal-linguistic personification was the most common subtype and was estimated around 12 %. Co-occurences of the different types of synesthesia were higher than chance, though at the level of small effect sizes...|$|R
