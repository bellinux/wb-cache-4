5|$|Prominent French-speaking {{writers were}} Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1712–1778) and Germaine de Staël (1766–1817). More recent authors include Charles Ferdinand Ramuz (1878–1947), whose novels {{describe}} {{the lives of}} peasants and mountain dwellers, set in a harsh environment and Blaise Cendrars (born Frédéric Sauser, 1887–1961). Also Italian and Romansh-speaking authors contributed but in more modest way given <b>their</b> <b>small</b> number.|$|E

5|$|Pudús have various {{methods of}} obtaining the foliage they need. <b>Their</b> <b>small</b> stature and {{cautious}} nature create obstacles in attaining food. They stop often while searching for food {{to stand on}} their hind legs and smell the wind, detecting food scents. Females and fawns peel bark from saplings using their teeth, but mature males may use their spikelike antlers. The deer may use their front legs to press down on saplings until they snap or become low enough to the ground so they can reach the leaves. Forced to stand on their hind legs due to <b>their</b> <b>small</b> size, the deer climb branches and tree stumps to reach higher foliage. They bend bamboo shoots horizontally in order to walk on them and eat from higher branches.|$|E
5|$|Quarter Ponies {{are often}} used in western riding {{activities}} as mounts for children because of <b>their</b> <b>small</b> size, and calm, even temperament. Larger ponies {{are more suitable for}} adult riders and sometimes used for rodeo events such as steer wrestling.|$|E
5|$|Residents of Moore Park, {{opposed to}} the notion of {{widening}} <b>their</b> <b>small</b> residential street, approached city council in September 1948 to request the new extension connect to Mount Pleasant Road instead. A petition of residents followed, and city council accepted the recommendations. Bylaw 17489, passed February 7, 1949, formally approved the project. Despite the loss of ten houses, this plan was carried out.|$|E

5|$|The Celtic peoples {{established}} {{a number of}} settlement centers, {{beginning in the early}} 4th century BC, mostly in southern Poland, which was at the outer edge of their expansion. Through their highly developed economy and crafts, they exerted lasting cultural influence disproportional to <b>their</b> <b>small</b> numbers in the region.|$|E
5|$|The largest {{island is}} Lewis and Harris which extends to 2,179square kilometres, {{and there are}} a further 200 islands which are greater than 40hectares in area. Of the remainder, several such as Staffa and the Flannan Isles are well known despite <b>their</b> <b>small</b> size.|$|E
5|$|The plot {{follows the}} {{conflicts}} of the Varner family after ambitious drifter Ben Quick (Newman) arrives in <b>their</b> <b>small</b> Mississippi town. Will Varner (Orson Welles), the family's patriarch, has {{doubts about his}} son, Jody (Anthony Franciosa), and sees Ben as a better choice to inherit his position. Will therefore tries to push Ben and his daughter Clara (Joanne Woodward) into marriage.|$|E

5|$|The pygmy {{right whale}} is easily {{confused}} with minke whales because of their similar characteristics, such as <b>their</b> <b>small</b> size, dark gray tops, light gray bottoms, and light eye-patches.|$|E
5|$|The {{regiment}} saw {{light duty}} around Lexington, Kentucky, {{during the summer}} of 1863. In September, Burnside launched his effort to capture eastern Tennessee from Confederate hands. The 21st marched for Knoxville, Tennessee, on September 12, 1863. During the Knoxville Campaign, the 21st saw minor action, acting primarily in support of artillery due to <b>their</b> <b>small</b> numbers.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, John Maynard Smith, a noted {{biologist}} with {{a strong}} background in aeronautics, {{has pointed out that}} bumblebees would not be expected to sustain flight, as they would need to generate too much power given their tiny wing area. However, in aerodynamics experiments with other insects, he found that viscosity at the scale of small insects meant even <b>their</b> <b>small</b> wings can move a very large volume of air relative to their size, and this reduces the power required to sustain flight by an order of magnitude.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the motivations}} of those Australian's that volunteered {{to fight in}} Russia can only be guessed at, it seems {{unlikely}} to have been political. Regardless, they confirmed a reputation for audacity and courage, winning the only two Victoria Crosses of the land campaign, despite <b>their</b> <b>small</b> numbers. Yet Australian involvement was barely noticed at home {{at the time and}} made little difference to the outcome of the war. Total casualties included 10 killed and 40 wounded, with most deaths being from disease during operations in Mesopotamia.|$|E
5|$|Arctic terns {{sometimes}} dip down to {{the surface}} of the water to catch prey close to the surface. They may also chase insects in the air when breeding. It is also thought that Arctic terns may, in spite of <b>their</b> <b>small</b> size, occasionally engage in kleptoparasitism by swooping at birds so as to startle them into releasing their catches. Several species are targeted—conspecifics, other terns (like the common tern), and some auk and grebe species.|$|E
5|$|At first sight, frogs seem rather defenceless {{because of}} <b>their</b> <b>small</b> size, slow movement, thin skin, {{and lack of}} {{defensive}} structures, such as spines, claws or teeth. Many use camouflage to avoid detection, the skin often being spotted or streaked in neutral colours that allow a stationary frog to merge into its surroundings. Some can make prodigious leaps, often into water, that help them to evade potential attackers, while many have other defensive adaptations and strategies.|$|E

5|$|Bred {{primarily}} as hunting dogs, {{their goal is}} to find the bird, send it into the air and then to retrieve it on command after the hunter has shot the quarry. The Russian Spaniel is suited for hunting in marshland, fields, woodland, for birds as well as rabbits and other small game. The breed is also popular in their native Russia as <b>their</b> <b>small</b> size makes them suitable to be kept in busy cities, and easily transported to hunting sites.|$|E
5|$|Brighton's origins {{lie in the}} Saxon {{fishing and}} {{agricultural}} village of Bristelmestune. The English Channel formed its southern limit, but on all other sides was farmland divided into open fields called laines. These were further subdivided into furlongs—wide parallel strips—and paul-pieces, which were much narrower strips. Despite <b>their</b> <b>small</b> size, neighbouring paul-pieces often had different owners. Wide paths (leakways) ran at right-angles to the furlongs, separating them. This ancient land-use pattern, which survived until the 18th century despite its unsuitability for contemporary farming methods, significantly influenced the pattern of urban development in 18th- and 19th-century Brighton.|$|E
5|$|Cultured mysids {{are thought}} to provide an ideal food source for many marine organisms. They are often fed to cephalopods, fish larvae, and {{commercial}} farmed shrimp due to <b>their</b> <b>small</b> size and low cost. Their high protein and fat content also makes them a good alternative to live enriched Artemia when feeding juveniles (especially those {{that are difficult to}} maintain such as young seahorses) and other small fauna.|$|E
