5|$|Anatomically, {{the human}} {{cerebellum}} has {{the appearance of}} a separate structure attached {{to the bottom of the}} brain, tucked underneath the cerebral hemispheres. Its cortical surface is covered with finely spaced parallel grooves, in striking contrast <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>broad</b> irregular convolutions of the cerebral cortex. These parallel grooves conceal the fact that the cerebellar cortex is actually a continuous thin layer of tissue tightly folded in the style of an accordion. Within this thin layer are several types of neurons with a highly regular arrangement, the most important being Purkinje cells and granule cells. This complex neural organization gives rise to a massive signal-processing capability, but almost all of the output from the cerebellar cortex passes through a set of small deep nuclei lying in the white matter interior of the cerebellum.|$|E
5|$|Article 9 of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore, {{specifically}} Article 9(1), {{guarantees the}} right to life and {{the right to}} personal liberty. The Court of Appeal has called {{the right to life}} the most basic of human rights, but has yet to fully define the term in the Constitution. Contrary <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>broad</b> position taken in jurisdictions such as Malaysia and the United States, the High Court of Singapore has said that personal liberty only refers to freedom from unlawful incarceration or detention.|$|E
5|$|South of the loggia is the Dutch Tea Garden, {{which was}} laid out by C.E.Mallows in about 1905. The garden {{contains}} the Tea House which was designed by John Douglas. This has a cruciform plan and is a half-timbered building on a sandstone plinth. The roof is of red tiles, and sweeps upwards to a small spire surmounted by a weathercock. It is listed at GradeII. In {{the centre of the}} garden is a statue of Mercury and in front of the Tea House are two stone Talbots. To the north of the Tea House, on the path leading <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Broad</b> Walk, is a pair of wrought iron gates made in 1913 for the 2ndDuke. The gates and their overthrow are listed at GradeII.|$|E

5|$|The {{mail pouch}} was a {{separate}} component to the saddle {{that made the}} Pony Express unique. Standard mail pouches for horses were never employed because of their size and shape, as it was time consuming detaching and attaching it from one saddle to the other, causing undue delay in changing mounts. With many stops to make, the delayed time at each station would accumulate to appreciable proportions. To get around this difficulty, a mochila, or covering of leather, was thrown over the saddle. The saddle horn and cantle projected through holes which were specially cut to size in the mochila. Attached <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>broad</b> leather skirt of the mochila were four cantinas, or box-shaped hard leather compartments, where letters were carried on the journey.|$|E
5|$|The {{taxonomy}} of the roughtail stingray {{is not fully}} resolved, with the disjunct northwestern Atlantic, southwestern Atlantic, and eastern Atlantic populations differing in life history and perhaps representing a complex of different species. Lisa Rosenberger's 2001 phylogenetic analysis of 14 Dasyatis species, based on morphology, found that the roughtail stingray is the sister species <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>broad</b> stingray (D. lata), and that they form a clade with the southern stingray (D. americana) and the longtail stingray (D. longa). The close relationship between the roughtail and southern stingrays was upheld by a genetic analysis published by Leticia de Almeida Leao Vaz and colleagues in 2006. The roughtail and broad stingrays {{are found in the}} Atlantic and Pacific Oceans respectively, and therefore likely diverged before or with the formation of the Isthmus of Panama (c. 3 Ma).|$|E

25|$|Pius XI was {{the first}} pope to {{directly}} address the Christian ecumenical movement. Like Benedict XV {{he was interested in}} achieving reunion with the Eastern Orthodox (failing that, he determined to give special attention to the Eastern Catholic churches). He also allowed the dialogue between Roman Catholics and Anglicans which had been planned during Benedict XV's pontificate to take place at Mechelen. However, these enterprises were firmly aimed at actually reuniting with the Roman Catholic Church other Christians who basically agreed with Catholic doctrine, bringing them back under papal authority. <b>To</b> <b>the</b> <b>broad</b> pan-Protestant ecumenical movement he took a more negative attitude.|$|E
25|$|Portuguese architecture, {{like all}} aspects of Portuguese culture, is marked by {{the history of the}} country and the several people that have settled and {{influenced}} the current Portuguese territory.

Among the main local manifestations of Portuguese architecture are the Manueline, the exuberant Portuguese version of late Gothic; and the Pombaline style, a mix of late Baroque and Neoclassicism that developed after the Great Lisbon earthquake of 1755.|$|E

25|$|Sustainable {{transport}} refers <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>broad</b> {{subject of}} transport that is sustainable in the senses of social, environmental and climate impacts {{and the ability}} to, in the global scope, supply the source energy indefinitely. Components for evaluating sustainability include the particular vehicles used for road, water or air transport; the source of energy; and the infrastructure used to accommodate the transport (roads, railways, airways, waterways, canals and terminals). Another component for evaluation is pipelines for transporting liquid or gas materials. Transport operations and logistics as well as transit-oriented development are also involved in evaluation. Transportation sustainability is largely being measured by transportation system effectiveness and efficiency {{as well as the}} environmental and climate impacts of the system.|$|E
25|$|Gender inequality, however, is not {{increasing}} or decreasing in a collinear fashion among these predominantly Muslim states. In Afghanistan, for example, gender inequality, {{as measured by}} the index, improved by 2% from 2005 to 2008 but then declined by 2% from 2008 to 2011. In Iraq, the GII score jumped by 9% from 2005 to 2008 but then leveled off in 2011. Turkey, Indonesia, Tunisia, and Pakistan have seen consistent improves to gender equality since 2005. Due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>broad,</b> general nature of the indicators, the minimal and narrow data used to compile the three categories which compose the indicator, and innumerable political and socio-economic issues which may increase or decrease gender inequality, nothing definitive can be said about the level of gender inequality or its growth trend in many predominantly Muslim nations.|$|E
