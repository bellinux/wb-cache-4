5|$|M.regularis {{is found}} in the {{south-western}} coastal regions, inhabiting eucalypt woodland and open forests. They nest underground and do not build mounds. Workers are active during the day and night, foraging on trees in search for prey and sweet substances such as sap and nectar. The larvae are strictly carnivorous and only eat insects that workers capture. Nuptial flight occurs around February to April, with queens shedding their wings inside the nest and mating near to <b>their</b> <b>parent</b> nest. Queens tend to look for food for their young before they hatch, taking as long as eight months to develop. Certain frog species are known to dwell inside M.regularis colonies.|$|E
50|$|Children who {{are able}} to {{communicate}} with <b>their</b> <b>parents</b> are less likely to experience psychological and behavioral problems. Through having contact with <b>their</b> <b>parents,</b> they are able to {{have a better understanding of}} <b>their</b> <b>parent’s</b> situation, and are less likely to commit crime that will land them in the same situation. Although having a relationship with incarcerated parents are important for the child, it is also understood that this can have an adverse impact on the child. Children who are in contact with <b>their</b> <b>parents</b> will experience an emotional roller coaster. At times children are angry at the fact that they could not be with <b>their</b> <b>parents,</b> causing them to act out or become emotionally withdrawn. Parent contact gives children a sense of hope in reuniting with <b>their</b> <b>parents.</b> This contact also allows for an smoother transition back into the child’s life once the parent is released.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to explore how young adults change their images for <b>their</b> <b>parents</b> and reasons behind these changes. Semi-structured {{interviews}} were conducted for 19 young adults. Data were qualitatively analyzed in a grounded theory approach. The results showed that there are two ways for young adults to change their images for <b>their</b> <b>parents.</b> One way is “improvements of images”, that improves young adults' images for <b>their</b> <b>parents</b> and rests <b>their</b> gaze on good involvement from <b>their</b> <b>parents.</b> Another way is “parents as human being”. This means that young adults come to see <b>their</b> <b>parents</b> as human being, and understand parents also have faults. The two ways are influenced by “ Factors of changes” that involve “parents' balance”, “orientation to societies”, and “sympathy for their parents”. Through two way, young adults come to accept <b>their</b> <b>parents</b> and have “whole parents' images”...|$|R
40|$|A {{number of}} studies, internationally, have {{established}} a relationship between family structures and environment with juvenile delinquency (Harper and McLanahan, 1998; Larson, Swyers and Larson, 1995; Anderson, 2002). Not many {{studies have been conducted}} in Malaysia to link juvenile delinquency with the context of juveniles’ families, especially of <b>their</b> <b>parents</b> or people assuming the role of <b>their</b> <b>parents.</b> This paper is an early attempt at understanding the experiences of juveniles with <b>their</b> <b>parents</b> in order to explore the relationship between their experiences and their involvement in crime or juvenile behaviour. For this purpose, a qualitative research approach was adopted by conducting in-depth interviews with seven (7) male juvenile offenders from a rehabilitation centre in Penang and five (5) female juvenile offenders from a rehabilitation centre in Kedah, Malaysia. The interviews provide an insight into the male and female juveniles’ personal feelings about their experiences and relationships with <b>their</b> <b>parents</b> or persons whom they identify as people have parental guardianship over them. The study finds that adolescents who are involved in delinquencies expressed much unhappiness with <b>their</b> <b>parents</b> due to reasons such as <b>their</b> <b>parents</b> having divorced, not receiving love from <b>their</b> <b>parents,</b> feeling uncared by <b>their</b> <b>parents</b> and families, having strained relationships with their family and experiencing violence from <b>their</b> <b>parents</b> and/ or family. The narratives of the juveniles are hoped to be able to inform us about specific areas to explore further in understanding the criming and delinquent behaviour of juveniles...|$|R

5|$|Organisms inherit {{their genes}} from <b>their</b> <b>parents.</b> Asexual organisms simply inherit a {{complete}} copy of <b>their</b> <b>parent's</b> genome. Sexual organisms have {{two copies of}} each chromosome because they inherit one complete set from each parent.|$|R
5|$|Barriers to {{reproduction}} {{between two}} diverging sexual populations {{are required for}} the populations to become new species. Gene flow may slow this process by spreading the new genetic variants also to the other populations. Depending on how far two species have diverged since their most recent common ancestor, it may still be {{possible for them to}} produce offspring, as with horses and donkeys mating to produce mules. Such hybrids are generally infertile. In this case, closely related species may regularly interbreed, but hybrids will be selected against and the species will remain distinct. However, viable hybrids are occasionally formed and these new species can either have properties intermediate between <b>their</b> <b>parent</b> species, or possess a totally new phenotype. The importance of hybridisation in producing new species of animals is unclear, although cases have been seen in many types of animals, with the gray tree frog being a particularly well-studied example.|$|E
5|$|Cell {{division}} {{is essential for}} an organism to grow, but, when a cell divides, it must replicate the DNA in its genome so that the two daughter cells have the same genetic information as <b>their</b> <b>parent.</b> The double-stranded structure of DNA provides a simple mechanism for DNA replication. Here, the two strands are separated and then each strand's complementary DNA sequence is recreated by an enzyme called DNA polymerase. This enzyme makes the complementary strand by finding the correct base through complementary base pairing and bonding it onto the original strand. As DNA polymerases can only extend a DNA strand in a 5′ to 3′ direction, different mechanisms are used to copy the antiparallel strands of the double helix. In this way, the base on the old strand dictates which base appears on the new strand, and the cell ends up with a perfect copy of its DNA.|$|E
5|$|Every {{road that}} is {{maintained}} by DelDOT, including Interstate, U.S., and state routes, is assigned a maintenance road number (also {{known as a}} reference number). The maintenance road numbers are only unique in a specific county and some roads can be designated with multiple road numbers. For example, Bryants Corner Road in Kent County is designated as Road 205, Road 103, and Road 219. Suffixed maintenance road numbers exist near <b>their</b> <b>parent</b> roads, often for a short alignment. For example, Woodland Ferry Road in Sussex County is designated Road 78, while Old Sailor Road, a short road branching off from it near Laurel, is designated as Road 78A.

Link wields a sword and shield, {{which can be}} used to defeat enemies and deflects their attacks. Other combat items from past Zelda games return, such as the bow, the fire rod, bombs, and more. However, unlike previous games, the methods for obtaining and using these items is different. Rather than finding them in dungeons, they are rented or purchased from a merchant, named Ravio. Should Link fall in battle, his rented items will be returned to Ravio. They also do not require ammunition, instead their use is limited by the replenishing energy gauge.
