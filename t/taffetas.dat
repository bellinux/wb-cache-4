Schiaparelli's Spring 1940 collection featured [...] "trench" [...] brown and camouflage print <b>taffetas.</b> Soon {{after the fall of}} Paris on 14 June 1940, Schiaparelli sailed to New York for a lecture tour; apart from a few months in Paris in early 1941, she remained in New York City {{until the end of the}} war. On her return she found that fashions had changed, with Christian Dior's [...] "New Look" [...] marking a rejection of pre-war fashion. The house of Schiaparelli struggled in the austerity of the post-war period, and Elsa finally closed the couture house down in December 1954, the same year that her great rival Chanel returned to the business.|$|E

2500|$|In 1932, The Guardian {{reported}} on a trend for frocks based around designs by the French Impressionists, adding: [...] "There {{is no reason why}} they should look any more ridiculous than the Empress Eugénie hats that every other woman was wearing a few months ago". [...] In 1933, The Times reported that milliners were drawing on both the 18th century and the Second French Empire for inspiration, singling out Suzanne Talbot as showing styles similar to Empress Eugénie's riding hats and designs with trims turned up sharply on one side. A wide variety of materials were being used, including <b>taffetas,</b> straw and grosgrain. A year later, the Eugénie hat was still being adapted as part of new season's millinery designs, but now showing more of women's hairstyles: [...] "Hats are halo-like or sailor-like, but with considerable flatness. The idea is now to show the hair and the Eugenie hats, which are tipped forward over the nose, indicate that more and more hair is expected {{at the back of the}} head".|$|E
60|$|One {{evening in}} coming up some steps Princess Anne {{entangled}} her foot in her pink <b>taffetas</b> petticoat, nearly fell, and tore a large rent, besides breaking {{the thread of}} the festoons of seed pearls which bordered it, and scattering them on the floor.|$|E

60|$|What else {{he wished}} was never known, for {{at that moment}} round the block of cane came a big man in biscuit-coloured <b>taffetas</b> {{followed}} by two negroes in cotton drawers who were armed with cutlasses. He was not ten yards away, but his approach over the soft, yielding marl had been unheard.|$|E
60|$|He was {{beginning}} to torture his mind with conjecture, when the door opened, and to Don Diego's increasing mystification he beheld his best suit of clothes step into the cabin. It was a singularly elegant and characteristically Spanish suit of black <b>taffetas</b> with silver lace {{that had been made}} for him a year ago in Cadiz, and he knew each detail of it so well that it was impossible he could now be mistaken.|$|E

Now, upon the second {{sign of his}} assault, I betook me to my former manner of defence; he, on the other side, {{abandoned}} his body to the same danger as before, and follows me still with blows; but I, being loath to take the deadly advantage that lay before me of his left side, made a kind of stramazoun, ran {{him up to the}} hilt through the doublet, through the shirt, and yet missed the skin. He, making a reverse blow, falls upon my embossed girdle,--I had thrown off the hangers a little before,--strikes off a skirt of a thick-laced satin doublet I had, lined with four <b>taffetas,</b> cuts off two panes embroidered with pearl, rends through the drawings-out of tissue, enters the linings, and spiks the flesh.|$|E

5000|$|On November 4, 1782, <b>taffeta</b> {{was used}} by Joseph Montgolfier of France to {{construct}} a small, cube-shaped balloon. This {{was the beginning of}} many experiments using <b>taffeta</b> balloons by the Montgolfier brothers, and led to the first known human flight in a lighter-than-air craft.|$|R

60|$|He checked. Out of {{the church}} at that moment, grand air and all, sauntered Peter Blood. With him came a tough, long-legged French sea-wolf named Yberville, who, though still young, had already won fame as a {{privateer}} commander before {{the loss of his}} own ship had driven him to take service under Blood. The Captain advanced towards that disputing group, leaning lightly upon his long ebony cane, his face shaded by a broad-plumed hat. There was in his appearance nothing of the buccaneer. He had much more the air of a lounger in the Mall or the Alameda--the latter rather, since his elegant suit of violet <b>taffetas</b> with gold-embroidered button-holes was in the Spanish fashion. But the long, stout, serviceable rapier, thrust up behind by the left hand resting lightly on the pummel, corrected the impression. That and those steely eyes of his announced the adventurer.|$|E
60|$|To inspect them, {{drawn up}} there on the mole, came Governor Steed, a short, stout, red-faced gentleman, in blue <b>taffetas</b> {{burdened}} by a prodigious amount of gold lace, who limped a little and leaned heavily upon a stout ebony cane. After him, in the uniform of a colonel of the Barbados Militia, rolled a tall, corpulent man who towered head and shoulders above the Governor, with malevolence plainly written on his enormous yellowish countenance. At his side, and contrasting oddly with his grossness, moving with an easy stripling grace, came a slight young lady in a modish riding-gown. The broad brim of a grey hat with scarlet sweep of ostrich plume shaded an oval face upon which the climate of the Tropic of Cancer had made no impression, so delicately fair was its complexion. Ringlets of red-brown hair hung to her shoulders. Frankness looked out from her hazel eyes which were set wide; commiseration repressed now the mischievousness that normally inhabited her fresh young mouth.|$|E
6000|$|... "Is {{she never}} coming?" [...] was again the call; and Lady Archfield muttering, [...] "Was there ever such an {{impatient}} poppet?" [...] released Anne, who was instantly pounced upon by young Mrs. Archfield. Linking her arm into {{that of her}} visitor, and thrusting Lucy into the background, the little heiress proceeded to her own wainscotted bedroom, bare according to modern views, but very luxurious according {{to those of the}} seventeenth century, and with the toilette apparatus, scanty indeed, but of solid silver, and with a lavish amount of perfumery. Her 'own woman' was in waiting to display and refold the whole wedding wardrobe, brocade, satin, <b>taffetas,</b> cambric, Valenciennes, and point d'Alencon. Anne had to admire each in detail, and then to give full meed to the whole casket of jewels, numerous and dazzling as befitted a constellation of heirlooms upon one small head. They were beautiful, but it was wearisome to repeat 'Vastly pretty!' 'How exquisite!' 'That becomes you very well,' almost mechanically, when Lucy was standing about all the time, longing to exchange the girlish confidences that were burning to come forth. 'Young Madam,' as every one called her in those times when Christian names were at a discount, seemed to be jealous of attention to any one else, and the instant she saw the guest attempt to converse with her sister-in-law peremptorily interrupted, almost as if affronted.|$|E
50|$|The {{silk and}} <b>taffeta</b> fabrics {{produced}} by this technique {{have a variety}} of names, including chiné, Pompadour <b>taffeta</b> (after Madame de Pompadour) and chiné à la branche. Chiné velvet was also possible, although the technique was very difficult and expensive and only made in a few places in France in the eighteenth century.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Taffeta</b> ( [...] ; archaically spelled taffety) is a crisp, smooth, plain {{woven fabric}} made from silk or {{cuprammonium}} rayons. The word is Persian in origin and means [...] "twisted woven". It {{is considered to}} be a [...] "high-end" [...] fabric, suitable for use in ball gowns, wedding dresses, and in interior decoration for curtains or wallcoverings. It is also widely used in the manufacture of corsets and corsetry: it yields a more starched-like type of cloth that holds its shape better than many other fabrics. An extremely thin, crisp type of <b>taffeta</b> is called paper <b>taffeta.</b>|$|R
