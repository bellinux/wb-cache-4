Freezing and thawing damage {{is one of}} the major problems of concrete dams in cold climate. Cracking and splitting are the most common results of {{freezing and}} thawing deterioration in concrete dam. The cracking problem owing to freezing and thawing was investigated by making sue of finite element methods. The interpretation of the mechanism of failure was also given. In order to compute the <b>thermal</b> <b>stress</b> fields of concrete dam caused by freezing and thawing, the temperature changes versus seasons is determined according to measured data. The temperature fields of concrete dam versus seasons are simulated by using finite element method. Basing on the computational results of the temperature fields of concrete dam, the <b>thermal</b> <b>stress</b> fields are calculated numerically. The researches show that the first principal stress of concrete dam at downstream surface can exceed the tensile strength of concrete material.

The sand passed through the pump one time and is discarded. The wear of flow paths and bearings is presented along with variation in pump performance and vibration as the pump wears. The pump was operated at its Best Efficiency Point (BEP) which is 1150 GPM (30100 BPD) at 3600 RPM with a specific speed of 1600. The hydraulic performance of the pump decreased 6. 3 % due to wear occurring in the secondary flow paths. Specifically, the bearings and seals were severely worn with bearing orbits up to 50 mils peak to peak. At the end, the bearings had worn more than the seals resulting in the seals carrying the rotordynamic loads of the rotor.

In this paper, an exact and complete fundamental solution is derived for the problem of a penny-shaped crack in magneto-electro-thermo-elastic material under prescribed thermal flux on the crack faces. The problem is analyzed {{within the framework of}} the theory of linear magneto-electro-thermo-elasticity. Electro-magneto-thermo-elasticity includes the effective elastic, piezoelectric, piezomagnetic, dielectric permittivity, magnetic permeability and electromagnetic coupling moduli, as well as the effective thermal expansion coefficients and the associated pyroelectric and pyromagnetic constants. The coupling features of transversely isotropic magneto-electro-thermo-elastic solids are governed by a system of partial differential equations with respect to the elastic displacements, the electric potential and the magnetic potential and temperature field. The heat conduction equation and equilibrium equations for an infinite magneto-electro-thermo-elastic media are solved by means of Hankel integral transform. The intensity factors of <b>thermal</b> <b>stress,</b> electric displacement and magnetic in-duction are derived explicitly for impermeable and permeable cracks. Due to its explicitness, the solution is remarkable and should be of great interest in the magneto-electro-thermo-elastic material analysis and design.
