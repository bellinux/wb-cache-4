5|$|Historian Wilhelm Levison, {{writing in}} 1946, was sceptical about the {{authenticity}} of this charter. In particular, {{he felt that the}} two separate addresses were incongruous and suggested that the first address, occurring before <b>the</b> <b>preamble,</b> may have been inserted by someone familiar with Bede to echo Eadbald's future conversion (see below). A more recent and more positive appraisal by John Morris argues that the charter and its witness list are authentic because it incorporates titles and phraseology that had fallen out of use by 800.|$|E
5|$|After the {{collapse}} of the Austro-Hungarian monarchy in 1918 and the proclamation of the First Austrian Republic, diplomatic relations with the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics were established on 25 February 1924. The first Soviet Plenipotentiary in Vienna was Yan Antonovich Berzin. Diplomatic relations were broken in March 1938 after the German invasion of Austria and its incorporation into Nazi Germany. After the Second World War, the USSR and Austria re-established diplomatic relations at the level of political representation, which in 1953 was converted into embassies. <b>The</b> <b>preamble</b> of the Austrian State Treaty, signed on 15 May 1955 by the USSR, United States, United Kingdom, France and Austria, established that the treaty formed the basis of Soviet relations with Austria. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, relations continued between the Russian Federation and the Austrian state.|$|E

5|$|Jefferson's most {{immediate}} sources were two documents written in June 1776: his own draft of <b>the</b> <b>preamble</b> of the Constitution of Virginia, and George Mason's {{draft of the}} Virginia Declaration of Rights. Ideas and phrases from both of these documents appear in the Declaration of Independence. They were, in turn, directly influenced by the 1689 English Declaration of Rights, which formally ended the reign of King JamesII. During the American Revolution, Jefferson and other Americans looked to the English Declaration of Rights {{as a model of}} how to end the reign of an unjust king. The Scottish Declaration of Arbroath (1320) and the Dutch Act of Abjuration (1581) have also been offered as models for Jefferson's Declaration, but these models are now accepted by few scholars.|$|E
5|$|King Charles I {{attempted}} to enclose and sell {{two thirds of}} the Chase, as part of a wider attempt to raise revenue for the Crown from the sale of Royal forests. The attempts to enclose the lands, used as commons, resulted in riots, part of a pattern of disturbances that ran across the disafforested royal lands. In 1633, the Court of Exchequer Chamber of Charles I decreed the rights of the public to {{two thirds of the}} lands on the Malvern Hills, and rights of Sir Cornelius Vermuyden and his descendants, and the Crown, to one third (quoted in <b>the</b> <b>preamble</b> to the Malvern Hills Act of 1884). By that time, Malvern had become an established community and the major settlement in the Malvern Chase.|$|E
40|$|Those who {{question}} the permissibility of official acknowledgements of God {{might be surprised}} to learn that <b>the</b> <b>preambles</b> of forty-five of the fifty state constitutions expressly invoke God. The practice is common in both liberal and conservative states and is equally prevalent in all regions of the country. Virtually all of those preambles give thanks to God, and many also seek God 2 ̆ 7 s blessing n the state 2 ̆ 7 s endeavors. Yet there has been no detailed assessment of <b>the</b> <b>preambles</b> 2 ̆ 7 history or significance. This paper seeks to remedy that gap. <b>The</b> <b>preambles</b> complicate <b>the</b> claim that official acknowledgements of God are incompatible with our legal culture. But the history of their adoption also does not offer clear support for those who support a robust inter-relationship between religion and civil government. Reference to God in state preambles were outliers for the first half-century after the ratification of the federal Constitution and did not become common until the 1840 s, when the effects of the Second Great Awakening-and its commitment to the idea that religion was the province of the community and the state-influenced the process of state constitution-making. Most of <b>the</b> <b>preambles</b> are thus <b>the</b> product of a movement that sought to create, rather than to continue or restore, a tradition of collective acknowledgement of God in state constitutions. The complex history of <b>the</b> <b>preambles</b> reveals <b>the</b> difficulty of relying on them to assert any strong normative claims about the proper relationship between religion and civil government. On the other hand, the history of <b>the</b> <b>preambles</b> does not provide obvious support to those who treat the original meaning as dispositive today, because there is no unambiguous and unbroken tradition, dating to the framing, of a dominant practice of references to God in state <b>preambles.</b> On <b>the</b> other hand, those who accept the possibility of dynamic constitutional meaning cannot readily ignore the near-uniform practice of referring to God in <b>the</b> <b>preambles.</b> At <b>the</b> same time, the character and function of a constitutional preamble-to state the polity 2 ̆ 7 s aspirations and inspirations without creating any operative law-might be sufficiently distinctive to limit <b>the</b> <b>preambles</b> 2 ̆ 7 relevance for other forms of official endorsement of religious messages...|$|R

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>preambles</b> {{are used}} in the Czech legal system during the last twenty years rather rarely. Nonetheless, constitutions in the Czechoslovak history as in the Czech history are {{traditionally}} introduced by <b>the</b> <b>preambles.</b> As <b>the</b> Czech constitutional system inclines to consist of more constitutional legal acts at the supreme level of the interior legal system, we can found two constitutional <b>preambles</b> in <b>the</b> recent Czech constitutional system. Both top constitutional acts-the Constitution and the Charter of Fundamental Rights and Basic Freedoms are preceded by their own <b>preamble.</b> <b>The</b> <b>preambles</b> differ as they are focused on different part of constitutional issues. Despite of this obvious fact they are built-up on some features, which are common to both of them. <b>The</b> <b>preambles</b> are characterized by a modest form-their purpose is to explain, why the new chapter of the legal development is opened, and to offer us a common starting line. Nonetheless, they also keep to us a freedom of movement in the new legal period. Their main goal is to connect the people, not to divide, if the constitutional act, which is introduced by them, should be an expression of the common national will. ...|$|R
5|$|The Directive Principles of State Policy, {{embodied}} in Part IV of the Constitution, are directions {{given to the}} state to guide {{the establishment of an}} economic and social democracy, as proposed by <b>the</b> <b>Preamble.</b> They set forth the humanitarian and socialist instructions that were the aim of social revolution envisaged in India by the Constituent Assembly. The state is expected to keep these principles in mind while framing laws and policies, even though they are non-justiciable in nature. The Directive Principles may be classified under the following categories: ideals that the state ought to strive towards achieving; directions for the exercise of legislative and executive power; and rights of the citizens which the State must aim towards securing.|$|E

Powers were granted to restore the river using either the old channel or the new one, although it is not clear exactly what was meant by this.

5|$|Articles 41–43 mandate the State to {{endeavour}} to secure to all citizens the right to work, a living wage, social security, maternity relief, and a decent standard of living.

Article 39A requires the State to provide free legal aid to ensure that opportunities for securing justice are available to all citizens irrespective of economic or other disabilities. Article 43A mandates the State to work towards securing the participation of workers in the management of industries. The State, under Article 46, is also mandated to promote the interests of and work for the economic uplift of the scheduled castes and scheduled tribes and protect them from discrimination and exploitation. Several enactments, including two Constitutional amendments, have been passed to give effect to this provision.|$|E

5|$|Most Indonesians {{lived in}} fear and uncertainty, {{particularly}} {{a significant proportion of}} the population who supported the Dutch or who remained under Dutch control. The popular revolutionary cry 'Freedom or Death' was often interpreted to justify killings under claimed Republican authority. Traders were often in particularly difficult positions. On the one hand, they were pressured by Republicans to boycott all sales to the Dutch; on the other hand, Dutch police could be merciless in their efforts to stamp out smugglers on which the Republican economy depended. In some areas, the term kedaulatan rakyat ('exercising the sovereignty of the people') – which is mentioned in <b>the</b> <b>preamble</b> of the Constitution and used by pemuda to demand pro-active policies from leaders – came to be used not only in the demanding of free goods, but also to justify extortion and robbery.
