40|$|AbstractExperimental and {{analytical}} investigation is conducted {{to explore the}} effects of stitching on plain (without hole) and open-hole compressive and tensile strength of uniweave T 300 /QY 9512 laminates under different environmental conditions (20 °C/dry and wet, 150 °C/dry and wet). Strength performance of stitched composite laminates is also studied using finite element analysis (FEA) model and compared with the experimental results to validate the model. It is found that under similar environmental conditions, the open-hole compressive strength of stitched laminate is decreased and open-hole tensile strength increased as compared <b>to</b> the <b>unstitched</b> laminates. Predicted tensile and compressive strengths {{are found to be}} in a good agreement with the test results and the relative error in all cases is less than 15 %...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Foam core {{sandwich}} composites {{with various}} facings composed of glass, carbon woven, carbon/Kevlar hybrid, and Kevlar fabrics were fabricated by using RTM process, {{as well as}} the through-thickness stitched sandwich samples with glass fabrics; and impact performance was studied at three energy levels. This article proposes that the damage extent of foam core sandwich construction may be char-acterized by the average damage angle, penetration depth, and maximal cracking width. The results show that the foam core samples with Kevlar facing are optimal for the peak load at load–time plots and the lowest impact damage extent at the same energy level. Compared <b>to</b> the <b>unstitched</b> samples, the average damage angle of stitched samples increases by 48 %, the maximal cracking width and penetration depth of stitched samples decrease by 67 % and 4 % at 25 J impact energy level.

50|$|The {{stitching}} of laminates in the through thickness direction with a {{high strength}} thread has proven a simple, low-cost method for producing 3-D composites. The stitching process basically involves sewing high tensile strength yarn (e.g. glass, carbon or Kevlar®), through an uncured prepreg laminate or dry fabric plies using an industrial sewing machine. Studies report an improvement to in-plane mechanical properties due to stitching, whereas others find unchanged or degraded properties.The data assembled for stitched laminates reveal that the tension, compression, flexure, shear and open-hole strengths are improved or degraded up to 20% by stitching relative <b>to</b> those of <b>unstitched</b> laminates.|$|R

The skins of parchment of which it consisted are said <b>to</b> have been <b>unstitched</b> and wrapped round the trunk and limbs of the corpse of Anne Adcock, and so buried by her grandson, John Adcock, a man of eccentric character, in December, 1776. For the most part, of course, the information contained in this volume is for ever lost, but transcripts exist at Lincoln for the years 1604, 1606 to 1609 and 1618; and at Leicester for 1581, 1612, 1613, 1617, 1621, 1625 to 1629, 1632 to 1634, 1636 to 1638, 1661 to 1663, 1670, 1672, 1674 to 1683, 1685, 1687, 1688, 1690, 1691, and 1694 to 1700.|$|R
40|$|A {{methodology}} {{is desired}} {{that will allow}} a designer to select appropriate amounts of through-thickness reinforcement needed to meet design requirements. The goal {{is to use a}} relatively simple analysis to minimize the amount of testing that needs to be performed, and to make test results from simple configurations applicable to more general structures. Using this methodology one should be able to optimize the selection of stitching materials, the weight of the yarn, and the stitching density. The analysis approach is to treat substructure disbond as a crack propagation problem. In this approach, the stitches have little influence until a delamination begins to grow. Once the delamination reaches, or extends beyond a stitch, the stitch serves to reduce the strain-energy-release-rate (G) at the crack tip for a given applied load. The reduced G can then be compared <b>to</b> the <b>unstitched</b> materials toughness <b>to</b> predict the load required to further extend the crack. The current model treats the stitch as a simple spring which responds to displacements in the vertical (through-thickness) direction. In concept, this approach is similar to that proposed by other authors. Test results indicate that the model should be refined to include the shearing stiffness of the stitch. The strain-energy-release-rate calculations are performed using a code which uses interconnected higher-order plates to model built-up composite cross-sections. When plates are stacked vertically, the interfacial tractions between the plates can be computed. The plate differential equations are solved in closed-form. The code, called SUBLAM, was developed as part of this section in one dimension. Because of this limitation, rows of stitches are treated as a two-dimensional sheet. The spring stiffness of a row of stitches can be estimated from the stitch material, weight, and density. As a practical and conservative approach, we can assume that the stitch is bonded until a crack passes the stitch location. After the crack passes, it is fully bonded. A series of tests were performed to exercise this methodology and incorporated an attached flange such that the sudden change in thickness initiated a delamination. The analysis was used to estimate the materials' critical G from that of the unstitched specimens. With this data, a prediction was made for the load required to delaminate the stitched specimens. Using the methodology, design charts have been created for simplified geometries. These charts give stitch force, along with G(sub 1) and G(sub 2) as as function of the stitch spring stiffness. Using the charts, {{it should be possible to}} determine the stitch spring stiffness and strength required to reduce the G to a desired level. From these parameters, the actual stitching material, weight, and density can be computed...|$|R
40|$|The {{compression}} {{strength of a}} stitched and a toughened matrix graphite/epoxy composite was determined and compared <b>to</b> a baseline <b>unstitched</b> untoughened composite. Two different layups {{with a variety of}} test lengths were tested under both ambient and hot/wet conditions. No significant difference in strength was seen for the different materials when the gage lengths of the specimens were long enough to lead to a buckling failure. For shorter specimens, a 30 % reduction in strength from the baseline was seen due to stitching for both a 48 -ply quasi-isotropic and a (0 / 45 / 0 /- 45 / 90 /- 45 / 0 / 45 / 0) s laminate. Analysis of the results suggested that the decrease in strength was due to increased fiber misalignment due to the stitches. An observed increasing strength with decreasing gage length, which was seen for all materials, was explained with a size effect model. The model assumed a random distribution of flaws (misaligned fibers). The toughened material showed a small increase in strength over the baseline material for both laminates presumably due to the compensating effects of a more compliant matrix and straighter fibers in the toughened material. The hot/wet strength of the stitched and baseline material fell 30 % below their ambient strengths for shorter, non-buckling specimen, while the strength of the toughened matrix material only fell 20 %. Video images of the failing specimen were recorded and showed local failures prior to global collapse of the specimen. These images support the theory of a random distribution of flaws controlling composite failure. Failed specimen appearance however, seems to be a misleading indication of the cause of failure...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} and optimisation of automated fabric preforming processes {{is critical for}} the adoption of composite materials for low cost, high volume applications. This thesis presents {{the development of a}} numerical material model to simulate the forming of 2 D fabric plies into complex 3 D shapes. The material model has been used to evaluate the feasibility of using matched-tool forming and double diaphragm forming, to manufacture low cost fabric preforms suitable for liquid moulding processes. The research has focused on two main aspects: (I) fabric characterisation and modelling and (II) process simulation and optimisation. The forming behaviour of woven fabrics and non-crimp fabrics (NCF) has been investigated to understand the deformation mechanisms and the cause of defects, in order to seek feasible solutions for defect reduction. A non-orthogonal constitutive relation has been developed to capture the nonlinear material behaviour, which was implemented in an explicit finite element model and used to refine the forming process. Results from the material model indicate that pillar stitched NCFs are not as compliant as woven fabrics of the same areal mass. The likelihood of defects is therefore higher for the NCF and the shear behaviour is axisymmetric due to the influence of the stitch yarn. The NCF material exhibits two types of wrinkling during matched tool forming; out-of-plane wrinkling at the ply level (macro-scale wrinkling) induced by excessive shear, and in-plane wrinkling at the bundle level (meso-scale wrinkling) caused by fibre compression. Stitch rupture can also occur at high shear angles, which can lead to further localised wrinkling. Fabric bridging is the dominant defect in large curvature regions when using double diaphragm forming (DDF), and wrinkling was found to be generally lower than in matched-tool forming. The model has been used to successfully identify the cause of all of these defects in NCF preforms manufactured by DDF, and has been used to optimise preform geometry and process parameters to mitigate these problems. Darts were added to preforms to alleviate fabric bridging and improve surface conformity, using the tensile stress in the yarns to identify suitable positions and orientations, minimising the effect on the mechanical performance of the component. An optimisation methodology has been developed for placing local inter-ply stitches on multi-ply preforms, by coupling the FE analysis with a genetic algorithm. The stitches enable multiple plies to be joined together to aid robotic handling and the optimisation routine ensures that the placement of the stitches does not adversely affect the formability of the preform. Results indicate that whilst the inter-ply stitches affect the shear distribution at a global level, the formability of a multi-ply preform can be improved compared <b>to</b> the <b>unstitched</b> counterpart by optimising the pattern of through-thickness stitches. A two-step optimisation method was also developed to optimise the boundary conditions for a matched tool forming scenario. Spring-loaded clamps were used to provide in-plane tension in the fabric plies during forming, rather than using a blank holder to induce tension through friction, providing an opportunity to reduce preform size and therefore waste. The optimisation algorithm was used to determine the location and size of the clamps around the blank perimeter and the stiffness of the attached springs. It was shown that this method can effectively homogenise the global shear angle distribution, reducing the peak shear angle compared to using a segmented blank holder...|$|R
