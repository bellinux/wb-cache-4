2500|$|The [...] "correlatives" [...] are a {{paradigm}} of pro-forms, {{used to ask}} and answer the questions what, where, when, why, who, whose, how, how much, and what kind. They are constructed from set elements so that correlatives with similar meanings have similar forms: There are nine endings corresponding to the nine wh- questions, and five initial elements that perform the functions of asking, answering, denying, being inclusive, and being indefinite about these nine questions. For example, the words kiam (when) and kiu (who, which), with the initial ki- of questions, ask about time and individuals, whereas the words tiam (then) and tiu (this/that one), with the same endings but the initial ti- of demonstratives, answer <b>those</b> <b>questions,</b> and the words neniam (never) and neniu (no-one) deny <b>those</b> <b>questions.</b> Thus by learning these 14 elements the speaker acquires {{a paradigm}} of 45 adverbs and pronouns.|$|E
