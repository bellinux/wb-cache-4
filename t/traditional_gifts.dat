50|$|In the Tzeltal tradition, a girl is {{kidnapped by}} the groom, {{possibly}} {{in concert with}} his friends. She is generally taken to the mountains and raped.

50|$|Emin Gjiku is a traditional, {{preserved}} house {{which is}} protected by the state.

50|$|The Saunders Family Rose Window {{is located}} in the student lounge on the fifth floor of Trevorrow Hall.

5000|$|In {{the mean}} time George II's brother Stephen made some overtures to Spain, who {{reciprocated}} by calling Stephen king and {{giving him the}} <b>traditional</b> <b>gifts</b> (albeit in less frequency than to George II), but he later changed allegiances and raided Spanish held territory. In 1815 Stephen, styling himself [...] "King Regent … of the Shore", and 33 other Miskito notables gave their [...] "consent, assent, and declaration to, for, and of" [...] George Frederic Augustus I as their [...] "Sovereign King". His coronation in Belize on January 16, 1816, in a deliberate move to secure British support, {{marked the end of}} the regency. Meanwhile, Spain lost rule over New Granada in 1819 and over Central America in 1821, when the First Mexican Empire was proclaimed.|$|E
50|$|The {{names of}} some anniversaries provide {{guidance}} for appropriate or <b>traditional</b> <b>gifts</b> for the spouses {{to give each}} other; {{if there is a}} party these can be brought by the guests or influence the theme or decoration. These gifts vary in different countries, but some years have well-established connections now common to most nations: 5th Wood, 10th Tin, 15th Crystal, 20th China, 25th Silver, 30th Pearl, 40th Ruby, 50th Gold, 60th Diamond, 70th Platinum. In English speaking countries the first, wooden, gift was cut on the day of celebration and then presented to the wife as a finished article before the next two quarter days had passed. The tradition may have originated in medieval Germany where, if a married couple lived to celebrate the 25th anniversary of their wedding, the wife was presented by her friends and neighbors with a silver wreath to congratulate them for the good fortune that had prolonged the lives of the couple. Over time the number of symbols expanded and the German tradition came to assign gifts that had direct connections with each stage of married life. The symbols have changed over time. For example, in the United Kingdom, diamond was a well known symbol for the 75th anniversary, but this changed to the now more common 60th anniversary after the Diamond Anniversary of Queen Victoria. The current monarch Queen Elizabeth II's 60th year on the throne was widely marked as her Diamond Jubilee and commemorated in 2012.|$|E

5000|$|Owing to {{the timing}} of the plant's blossoms, cassia wine is the {{traditional}} choice for the [...] "reunion wine" [...] drunk on the Mid-Autumn or Mooncake Festival.
