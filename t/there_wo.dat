Retrospective nalysis of maternal and neonatal record of 21 triplet pregnances delivered fron January 208 to June 2011 at San Pietro FBF Hospital of Rome, a tertiary medical center. The incidence of triplet pregnancies {{was one in}} 690 births. Among the 21 triplet pregnancies, only one was conceived spontaneously and 20 {{were the result of}} assisted reproductive techniques. Mean maternal age was 34. 4 ± 5 years. There was one case of selective foetcide of a foetus with an encephalocele. Preterm delivery occurred in all the remaining 20 pregnacies. Other frequent complications were premature rupture of membranes (40 %) and cervical incompetence (35 %). <b>There</b> <b>wos</b> no maternal mortality in any of the studied pregnacies. The mean length of maternal hospitalization was 15 ± 5. 9 days. The mean gestational age was 31. 8 weeks, with a mean birth weight of 1590 ± 590 grams. The neonatal mortality was 5 %. The incidence of congenital anomalies was 16. 7 %. Respiratotory distress syndrome occurred in 53 % of cases and 75. 6 % of newborns required intensive care. Other common neonatal complications were jaundice (66. 7 %), anaemia (28. 9 %), patent ductus arteriosus (24. 4 %), apnea of prematurity (17. 8 %), sepsis (13. 3 %), neurological complications (11. 1 %) and bronchopoulmonary dysplasia (11. 1 %). The mean length of newborns hospitalization was 33. 6 ± 23. 3 days. There {{was no significant difference in}} neonatal mortality and morbidity based on birth order. The series of triplet pregnancies demonstrated an excellent survival rate and a relatively low major morbidity, despite the 100 % incidence of prematurity. Although perinatl outcomes in triplet gestations have improved in recent years, hiher-order multiple pregnancies continued to be associated with great medical problems for both mothers and infants.

Gundry's theory is that the author of Matthew wanted to remove the woes for later use against the Pharisees in Matthew 23, however he wanted to keep the same eightfold structure and thus needed to create four new sayings. He sees this verse as essentially just a rephrasing of Matthew 5:3, this same wording is also found at Psalm 37:11.

I afterwards learned that she did go, but I may as well announce without delay that he and I did not accompany her. It was while the church-bell was murmuring in the distance that the author of Beltraffio led me forth for the ramble he had spoken of in his note. I will not attempt to say where we went, or to describe what we saw. We kept to the fields and copses and commons, and breathed the same sweet air as the nibbling donkeys and the browsing sheep, whose woolliness seemed to me, in those early days of my acquaintance with English objects, but a part of the general texture of the small, dense landscape, which looked as if the harvest were gathered by the shears. Everything was full of expression for Mark Ambient's visitor,--from the big, bandy-legged geese, whose whiteness was a [...] "note," [...] amid all the tones of green, as they wandered beside a neat little oval pool, the foreground of a thatched and whitewashed inn, with a grassy approach and a pictorial sign,--from these humble wayside animals to the crests of high woods which let a gable or a pinnacle peep here and there, and looked, even at a distance, like trees of good company, conscious of an individual profile. I admired the hedgerows, I plucked the faint-hued heather, and I was forever stopping to say how charming I thought the thread-like footpaths across the fields, which wandered, in a diagonal of finer grain, from one smooth stile to another. Mark Ambient was abundantly good-natured, and was as much entertained with my observations as I was with the literary allusions of the landscape. We sat and smoked upon stiles, broaching paradoxes in the decent English air; we took short cuts across a park or two, where the bracken was deep and my companion nodded to the old woman at the gate; we skirted rank covers, which rustled here and <b>there</b> as <b>wo</b> passed, and we stretched ourselves at last on a heathery hillside, where, if the sun was not too hot, neither was the earth too cold, and where the country lay beneath us in a rich blue mist.

According to LOT theory there is a projection plane on which the image of the ball follows a path (the optic trajectory) with a direction defined by the ratio #/#.
