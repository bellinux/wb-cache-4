40|$|A <b>touch</b> {{sensitive}} <b>screen</b> <b>displays</b> {{the information}} on the screen and also receives the input by sensing a user's touch on the same screen. This mechanism facilitates system interaction directly through the screen without needing a mouse or keyboard. This method has the advantage to make the system compact by removing keyboard, mouse and similar interactive device. However there are certain difficulties to implement a <b>touch</b> <b>screen</b> interface. The <b>display</b> <b>screens</b> of portable devices are becoming smaller thereby leaving lesser space for display of data, menu or <b>touch</b> <b>screen</b> interaction. Besides some <b>screens</b> need to <b>display</b> so much of information that they hardly can afford any space to <b>display</b> <b>touch</b> <b>screen</b> buttons.

30|$|Secure <b>touch</b> <b>screen</b> and <b>display</b> {{controller}} reconfiguration. When a user {{intends to}} type in an IME soft keyboard, some reconfiguration {{should be done}} for the STIE initialization. We reconfigure Interrupt Security Register(ICDISR), Priority Mask Register (ICCPMR) and Enable Set Register (ICDISER) to make the touch input as a secure interrupt and mask all non-secure intterupt. In CPU Interface Control Register (ICCICR), FIQEn, EnableS are set to 1 to enable FIQ interrupt. FIQ bit in Secure Configuration Register (SCR) is also set to 1 to ensure FIQ interrupt routing to TrustZone monitor mode. Besides, <b>touch</b> <b>screen</b> and <b>display</b> controller are set to be secure peripherals with TZPC. As a proof-of-concept prototype, we only implement single-touch in the separate touch driver and leave multi-touch as a future work.|$|R

40|$|The {{demand for}} {{transparent}} conductors {{is expected to}} grow rapidly as electronic devices, such as <b>touch</b> <b>screens,</b> <b>displays,</b> solid state lighting and photovoltaics become ubiquitous in our lives. Doped metal oxides, especially indium tin oxide, are the commonly used materials for transparent conductors. As there are some drawbacks to this class of materials, exploration of alternative materials has been conducted. There is an interest in films of carbon nanomaterials such as, carbon nanotubes and graphene as they exhibit outstanding properties. This article reviews the synthesis and assembly of these films and their post-treatment. These processes determine the film performance and understanding of this platform will be useful for future work to improve the film performance...|$|R
