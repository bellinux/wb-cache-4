5|$|Lo Pui Sang v. Mamata Kapildev Dave (2008) took {{a narrow}} {{approach}} to the reading of personal liberty in Article 9(1). The High Court of Singapore held <b>that</b> <b>personal</b> liberty only refers to freedom from unlawful incarceration or detention, and does not include a liberty to contract. Although it was suggested this {{had always been the}} understanding of the term, no authority was cited.|$|E
5|$|After {{enduring}} {{seven months}} of rehabilitation for his injury, Killebrew remained in pain but rebounded to have his best season in 1969. On July 5, Killebrew set a career-high with six RBIs {{in a game against}} the Oakland Athletics. <b>That</b> <b>personal</b> best lasted barely two months: on September 7 he hit a three-run home run and a grand slam for seven RBIs, all in the first two innings, to defeat the Athletics again. Killebrew led the best offense in the league and rookie manager Billy Martin's Twins won the new American League West division as a result.|$|E
5|$|Article 9 of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore, {{specifically}} Article 9(1), {{guarantees the}} right to life and {{the right to}} personal liberty.

Contrary to the broad position taken in jurisdictions such as Malaysia and the United States, the High Court of Singapore has said <b>that</b> <b>personal</b> liberty only refers to freedom from unlawful incarceration or detention.|$|E

5|$|Several {{commentators}} have noted <b>that</b> <b>personal</b> identity {{is a strong}} theme in the book, and that it addresses issues of racism through the treatment of non-magical, non-human and non-living characters. Some commentators regard the diary as a warning against uncritical acceptance of information from sources whose motives and reliability cannot be checked. Institutional authority is portrayed as self-serving and incompetent. The book is also known to have some connections to the sixth novel of the series, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince.|$|E
5|$|The 1994 {{national}} {{convention of the}} Progress Party of Norway was held from 15 April to 17 April at the hotel Bolkesjø Turisthotell in Bolkesjø, Telemark. It was originally set {{up to be a}} normal convention with 157 delegates in a non-election year, but because of mounting antagonism between a traditionalist and a libertarian faction, it became clear some months before the conventions <b>that</b> <b>personal</b> positions could be at stake. The party leader seat, held by Carl I. Hagen since 1978, was up for re-election. The deputy leaders Ellen Wibe and Hans J. Røsjorde was not up for election until 1995, but there were talks about forming a motion of no confidence against Wibe. The political disagreements roughly corresponded to a cleavage between two factions.|$|E

25|$|In a {{study done}} by social {{psychologist}} Shawn Burn, it was found <b>that</b> <b>personal</b> contact with individuals within a neighborhood {{is the most effective}} way to increase recycling within a community. In his study, he had 10 block leaders talk to their neighbors and persuade them to recycle. A comparison group was sent fliers promoting recycling. It was found that the neighbors that were personally contacted by their block leaders recycled much more than the group without personal contact. As a result of this study, Shawn Burn believes <b>that</b> <b>personal</b> contact within a small group of people is an important factor in encouraging recycling. Another study done by Stuart Oskamp examines the effect of neighbors and friends on recycling. It was found in his studies that people who had friends and neighbors that recycled were much more likely to also recycle than those who didn't have friends and neighbors that recycled.|$|E
