5|$|Among the {{earliest}} cases of rumination {{was that of}} a physician in the nineteenth century, Charles-Édouard Brown-Séquard, who acquired the condition as the result of experiments upon himself. As a way of evaluating and testing the acid response of the stomach to various foods, the doctor would swallow sponges tied to a string, then intentionally regurgitate them <b>to</b> <b>analyze</b> <b>the</b> contents. As a result of these experiments, the doctor eventually regurgitated his meals habitually by reflex.|$|E
