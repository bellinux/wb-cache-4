40|$|Abstract Background False {{negative}} and indeterminate Interferon Gamma Release Assay (IGRA) results are a well documented problem. Cigarette smoking {{is known to}} {{increase the risk of}} tuberculosis (TB) and to impair Interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) responses to antigenic challenge, but the impact of smoking on IGRA performance is not known. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effect of smoking on IGRA performance in TB patients in a low and high TB prevalence setting respectively. Methods Patients with confirmed TB from Denmark (DK, n[*]=[*] 34; 20 smokers) and <b>Tanzania</b> (<b>TZ,</b> n[*]=[*] 172; 23 smokers) were tested with the QuantiFERON-TB Gold In tube (QFT). Median IFN-γ level in smokers and non smokers were compared and smoking was analysed as a risk factor for false {{negative and}} indeterminate QFT results. Results Smokers from both DK and TZ had lower IFN-γ antigen responses (median 0. 9 vs. 4. 2 IU/ml, p[*]=[*] 0. 04 and 0. 4 vs. 1. 6, p[*] Conclusions Cigarette smoking was associated with false negative and indeterminate IGRA results in both a high and a low TB endemic setting independent of HIV status. </p...|$|R
40|$|Few {{studies have}} been {{conducted}} on injury mortality in <b>Tanzania</b> (<b>TZ).</b> This qualitative study {{was part of a larger}} project focusing on risk and protective factors for violent death in Dar es Salaam (DSM), TZ (Outwater, 2009). The rates of homicide death of adult women and children were discovered to be much lower than the world average. Male risk was found to be greater in DSM than the world average but lower than in South Africa or estimates for the African region. Of all homicide victims, 77 % were men between the ages of 20 and 45, although this group is only 15 % of the population in DSM. Homicide victims in DSM were killed as a result of individual assault as victims of thieves or by community mobs as alleged thieves. These data, earlier reported (Outwater et al., 2008), provide the context for this transcultural nursing study examining care in the aftermath of those homicide deaths. In 2005, a Tanzanian’s life expectancy at birth was 46 years and 90 % of the population was living on less than $ 2 /day (Population Reference Bureau, 2006). Secondary school enrollment for females was 5. 0 % and for males 6. 0...|$|R
40|$|Many water-related {{illnesses}} show {{an increase}} during the wet season. This is often due to fecal contamination from runoff, yet, {{it is unknown}} whether seasonal changes in water availability may {{also play a role}} in increased illness via changes in the type of primary water source used by households. Very {{little is known about the}} dynamic aspects of access to water and changes in source type across seasons, particularly in semi-arid regions with annual water scarcity. The research questions in this study were: (1) To what degree do households in Uganda (UG) and <b>Tanzania</b> (<b>TZ)</b> change primary water source type between wet and dry seasons?; and (2) How might seasonal changes relate to water quality and health? Using spatial survey data from 92 households each in UG and TZ this study found that, from wet to dry season, 26 % (UG) and 9 % (TZ) of households switched from a source with higher risk of contamination to a source with lower risk. By comparison, only 20 % (UG) and 0 % (TZ) of households switched from a source with lower risk of contamination to a source with higher risk of contamination. This research suggests that one pathway through which water-related disease prevalence may differ across seasons is the use of water sources with higher risk contamination, and that households with access to sources with lower risks of contamination sometimes choose to use more contaminated sources...|$|R
40|$|Mycobacterium {{tuberculosis}} (Mtb) and helminth infections elicit antagonistic immune effector {{functions and}} are co-endemic in several {{regions of the}} world. We therefore hypothesized that helminth infection may influence Mtb-specific T-cell immune responses. We evaluated the cytokine profile of Mtb-specific T cells in 72 individuals with pulmonary TB disease recruited from two Sub-Saharan regions with high and moderate helminth burden i. e. 55 from <b>Tanzania</b> (<b>TZ)</b> and 17 from South Africa (SA), respectively. We showed that Mtb-specific CD 4 T-cell functional profile of TB patients from Tanzania are primarily composed of polyfunctional Th 1 and Th 2 cells, associated with increased expression of Gata- 3 and reduced expression of T-bet in memory CD 4 T cells. In contrast, the cytokine profile of Mtb-specific CD 4 T cells of TB patients from SA was dominated by single IFN-γ and dual IFN-γ/TNF-α and associated with TB-induced systemic inflammation and elevated serum levels of type I IFNs. Of note, the proportion of patients with Mtb-specific CD 8 T cells was significantly reduced in Mtb/helminth co-infected patients from TZ. It {{is likely that the}} underlying helminth infection and possibly genetic and other unknown environmental factors may have caused the induction of mixed Th 1 /Th 2 Mtb-specific CD 4 T cell responses in patients from TZ. Taken together, these results indicate that the generation of Mtb-specific CD 4 and CD 8 T cell responses may be substantially influenced by environmental factors in vivo. These observations may have major impact in the identification of immune biomarkers of disease status and correlates of protection...|$|R

40|$|Sweet potato varieties, <b>Tanzania</b> (<b>Tz),</b> Nasport (Nsp) and Spk 004 (Spk), {{identified}} as potential {{raw material for}} baby food formulation, were characterised for proximate composition, mineral content and physicochemical characteristics. The interaction of sweet potato flour and proteins (soya and fish) were investigated. Starch was the most abundant nutrient in sweet potato (58 to 79 g/ 100 g flour dry weight). Resistant starch ranged between 17 and 29 %; these values were lower in sun-dried samples compared with freeze-dried ones and were reduced significantly on boiling. The in vitro starch digestibility was high, particularly in the sun-dried samples (80 - 85 %), indicating sweet potato carbohydrates may be utilised efficiently. Lipids (1. 1 - 2. 3 g/ 100 g) and proteins (2. 7 - 5. 0 g/ 100 g dry weight) were low. Aspartic acid and glycine were the most abundant amino acids, cysteine and methionine were limiting. The orange-fleshed varieties Nsp and Spk contained high levels of beta-carotene (provitamin A), which were reduced in sun-dried and oven-dried samples. The main elements were K, Na, Mg and Ca {{with an average of}} 1190, 408, 698 and 576 mg/kg, dry weight respectively and moderate iron (37 mg/kg) and Zn (40 mg/kg). The in vitro digestion method showed that Ca, Mn, Mg and Zn in sweet potato are moderately bioavailable (55, 51, 45 and 65 % respectively). Polyphenols identified in sweet potato were caffeoylquinic acids, p-coumaroylquinic acids, feruloyquinic acids, dicaffeoylquinic acids and caffeoylferuloylquinic acids. Caffeoylferuloylquinic acids have not been reported before in sweet potato. Small deformation rheology indicated that sweet potato flour had lower elastic modulus, G' values compared with extracted starch. A mixture of sweet potato and soya (5 % sp: 15 soya) and that of soya and fish (10 %: 10 %) w/w in water had lower G' and G" values than a mixture of sweet potato and fish (10 % sp: 10 % fish), which could be useful in making soft products. A sweet potato-based infant food using the Microdiet program was developed with nutritional and rheological characteristics similar to commercial baby foods. Lipid oxidation increased on storage of the dried product for 16 weeks at 22 °C, particularly in product containing fish but reduced in the presence of antioxidants (350, 500 mg vitamin C, 350, 500 mg vitamin E and 100 mg citric acid/ Kg). Products containing sweet potato and soya (recipe B) were more stable in the absence of antioxidants...|$|R
