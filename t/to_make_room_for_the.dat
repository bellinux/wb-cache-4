5|$|In 2014, Manchester City Council {{dismantled}} {{the memorial}} and reconstructed {{it at the}} opposite end of St Peter's Square next to Manchester Town Hall <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>room</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> expanded Metrolink tram network. It is a grade II* listed structure and in 2015, Historic England recognised Manchester Cenotaph as part of a national collection of Lutyens' war memorials.|$|E
5|$|The AM-1Q was {{developed}} for electronic countermeasures (ECM) duties. The fuselage fuel tank was removed <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>room</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> ECM operator and his equipment in a windowless compartment. The aircraft carried several radio and radar receivers, transmitters and a signal analyzer. The operator could also drop bundles of chaff through a chute to block radar signals.|$|E

5|$|A {{rangefinder}} {{was installed}} on the bridge and her fore and aft holds were refitted as magazines. Half-inch (12.7mm) steel plating was added to protect her steering gear and her interior cabin bulkheads and glass ventilators were removed to reduce damage from splinters. Her furniture was removed <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>room</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> mess decks needed to feed large numbers of troops and sailors and an operating room and sickbay were installed amidships.|$|E
5|$|Another {{variant of}} the Panzer IV was the Panzerbefehlswagen IV (Pz.Bef.Wg.IV) command tank. This {{conversion}} entailed the installation of additional radio sets, mounting racks, transformers, junction boxes, wiring, antennas and an auxiliary electrical generator. <b>To</b> <b>make</b> <b>room</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> new equipment, ammunition stowage was reduced from 87 to 72 rounds. The vehicle could coordinate with nearby armor, infantry or even aircraft. Seventeen Panzerbefehlswagen were built on Ausf. J chassis in August and September 1944, while another 88 were based on refurbished chassis.|$|E
5|$|Males attract mates by {{constructing}} specially-shaped tunnels {{in which}} they sing. Mating {{takes place in the}} male's burrow; the male may widen a tunnel <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>room</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> female to mount, though in some species mating is tail-to-tail. Females lay their eggs either in their normal burrows or in specially-dug brood chambers which are sealed when complete {{in the case of the}} genus Neoscapteriscus or not sealed in the case of genera Gryllotalpa and Neocurtilla.|$|E

The first part aired on June 1 in the UK, with an estimated 195,000 viewers tuning in. The second part aired on June 8 to an estimated 246,000 viewers.|$|E
5|$|Cecil {{was drawn}} to {{resemble}} David Hyde Pierce, but still look similar to Bob. According to director Pete Michels, {{it was difficult to}} draw Bob and Cecil standing together because their feet are both so big. There was a scene featuring Hans Moleman and his house, which was cut, but his house can still briefly be seen in the scene where Cecil throws Bart off a cliff. The sequence was cut in order <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>room</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> explanation of why Bob was sent back to prison. Ken Keeler has said that it is his favorite deleted scene.|$|E
5|$|Following the Apollo 1 fire in January 1967, NASA {{conducted}} a safety {{review of the}} Apollo program. In response to this review, McDonnell proposed the Universal Lunar Rescue Vehicle, a repackaged version of the Lunar Surface Rescue Spacecraft with an enlarged capsule <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>room</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> three astronauts who were being rescued. It was intended to rescue an Apollo crew at almost any point whilst {{they were at the}} Moon, should an anomaly occur. Some ULRV designs included five seats, with two astronauts piloting it to the Moon. The proposal was considered, but rejected due to lack of funds.|$|E

5|$|From 1982, A, B, C, D, and E {{tickets were}} {{discontinued}} {{in favor of}} a pay-one-price admission system for Disneyland, allowing visitors to experience the park's attractions, including the DRR, as many times as desired. In June 1985, the new Videopolis Station, consisting of a covered platform with no station building, was built in the Fantasyland section for the DRR. That same year, the DRR's track on the northern edge of its route was expanded outwards in order <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>room</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> new Videopolis stage. With the Mickey's Toontown expansion of the park, Mickey's Toontown Depot, a cartoon-themed depot building, replaced Videopolis Station in 1993.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, the MTA filed {{to change}} the {{location}} of Entrance 1, moving it onto from the sidewalk, away from its original proposed location inside 301 East 69th Street. This was because designs for entrances inside the building failed to both satisfy the building's residents as well as meet the MTA's engineering requirements. With the New York City Department of Transportation planning a bike lane along {{the east side of}} Second Avenue after construction is finished, the MTA could widen the sidewalk <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>room</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> entrances without ultimately disrupting traffic flow.|$|E
5|$|In April 2002, Specht Properties was {{selected}} as the developer of the project after scoring higher with the council appointed committee formed to rate each of three developer's proposals, with Gerding/Edlen Development and Trammell Crow Company losing out to Specht. Construction on the complex began in June 2003 when an old grain store at the site was demolished <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>room</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> center. A total of eight buildings were torn down to make room the complex as part of a redevelopment of a brownfield site.|$|E

5|$|In response, {{the study}} {{suggested}} that a third lane be constructed along the Sagtikos from the Southern State Parkway to the Long Island Expressway. The bridges over the Sagtikos at Campus Road and Crooked Hill Road (CR13) {{would have to be}} reconstructed <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>room</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> added lane, and the interchange with Pine Aire Drive (exitS3) would be completely rebuilt. A new interchange would also be constructed on the parkway between Pine Aire Drive and Campus Road, creating a junction with CR100. The project would cost $4billion (2011USD) and be built in phases for 15–20 years.|$|E
5|$|On September 1, 2005, {{the park}} officially {{announced}} Goliath, a $20,000,000 steel Hyper Coaster. By {{the end of}} the 2005 season, the rides Great Gasp and Looping Starship were closed and removed from the park <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>room</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> new roller coaster. Foundations for Goliath's supports began to be poured in September 2005. In early October, track began to arrive at the park; erection of the supports and track began soon after. In November and December, construction on the lift hill was complete. In March 2006, Goliath's trains were delivered to the park. After construction on the track and testing was complete, the roller coaster opened to the public on April 1, 2006.|$|E
5|$|Prior to Endeavour docking, the Russian {{resupply}} spacecraft Progress M1-4, {{which came}} to the station in mid-November, was undocked <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>room</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> space shuttle.

It docked manually again with the station on 26 December by Gidzenko, after Endeavour left. The automatic docking system for this Progress spacecraft had failed on the first docking in November. The crew spent much of the following week unloading the Progress spacecraft.|$|E

5|$|Stanton and Pike {{stopped to}} rest, and Reed {{returned}} alone to the group, arriving {{four days after}} the party's departure. Without the guide they had been promised, the group had to decide whether to turn back and rejoin the traditional trail, follow the tracks left by the Harlan-Young Party through the difficult terrain of Weber Canyon, or forge their own trail in the direction that Hastings had recommended. At Reed's urging, the group chose the new Hastings route. Their progress slowed to about {{a mile and a half}} (2.4km) a day, and all the able-bodied men were required to clear brush, fell trees, and heave rocks <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>room</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> wagons.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} assigned labour quotas {{for each}} district to native commissioners across the territory {{who in turn}} called on local chiefs and headmen to provide workers. The tribal leaders decided who was required at the kraal and who would report to the district native commissioner for work. This system, known locally as the chibaro, cibbalo, isibalo or chipara—according to Charles van Onselen, synonymous etymologically with concepts ranging from contract labour to slavery—had been relatively widespread during Company rule (1890–1923), but {{had fallen out of}} use by the 1930s. Some tribal communities were resettled <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>room</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> airstrips.|$|E
5|$|Wallingford Castle was {{probably}} built by Robert D'Oyly between 1067 and 1071. Robert had married Wigod's daughter Ealdgyth, and ultimately inherited {{many of his}} father-in-law's lands. The wooden castle {{was built in the}} north-east corner of the town, taking advantage of the old Anglo-Saxon ramparts, with the motte close to the river overlooking the ford, and required substantial demolition work <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>room</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> new motte-and-bailey structure. Unusually, it appears that the castle was constructed on top of high-status Anglo-Saxon housing, probably belonging to former housecarls. The motte today is 60 metres (197 feet) across and 13 metres (43 feet) high. Robert endowed a sixteen-strong college of priests within the castle, which he named St Nicholas College.|$|E
