5|$|Amin's {{short-lived}} {{presidency was}} marked by controversies from beginning to end. He came to power by ordering {{the death of his}} predecessor Nur Muhammad Taraki. The revolt against communist rule which had begun under Taraki worsened under Amin, and was a problem that his government was unable to solve. The Soviet Union, which alleged that Amin was an agent of the CIA, intervened in Afghanistan while invoking the Twenty-Year Treaty of Friendship between Afghanistan and the Soviet Union. Amin was assassinated by the Soviets in December 1979 as part of Operation Storm-333, having ruled for slightly longer <b>than</b> <b>three</b> <b>months.</b>|$|E

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this research was}} the characterization of the humic fractions isolated from vermicomposting, originating from cattle manure and treated with Eisenea foetida or Lumbricus rubellus, during 3 and 6 months. Elemental analysis and Infrared and UV-vis spectroscopy were used for their characterizations. The results obtained shown that both humic acids are very similar, but six-month humic acid shown lower percentage of organic material <b>than</b> <b>three</b> <b>month</b> humic acid. The spectroscopy analysis shown that the humic acid studied can be compared with other humic acids reported in the literature. By comparing both vermicomposts, the one produced in <b>three</b> <b>months</b> presents a great potential as fertilizer and it is more economical than the vermicompost produced during a six month period...|$|R

5|$|By {{now it was}} mid-August, more <b>than</b> <b>three</b> <b>months</b> since Shackleton {{had left}} Elephant Island. Shackleton begged the Chilean Government to lend him Yelcho, a small steam tug that had {{assisted}} Emma during the previous attempt. The Government agreed, and on 25 August Yelcho, captained by Luis Pardo, set out for Elephant Island. This time, as Shackleton records, providence favoured them. The seas were open, and the ship was able to approach close to the island, in thick fog. At 11:40 am on 30 August the fog lifted, the camp was spotted and, within an hour, all the Elephant Island party were safely aboard, bound for Punta Arenas.|$|E
40|$|Cholesterol {{biosensor}} was fabricated by co-immobilizing cholesterol esterase {{and cholesterol}} oxidase in polyvinyl formal membrane and by mounting over the sensing part of oxygen electrode. The immobilized enzymes membrane {{was characterized by}} atomic force microscopy. The biosensor showed the linearity for 100 - 450 mg dl- 1 cholesterol acetate. The minimum detection limit of the cholesterol was 50 mg dl- 1. The effects of temperature, pH and the stability of immobilized enzymes were also studied. A good correlation was found among cholesterol values obtained by colorimetric, Enzo-kit and auto analyzer method. The shelf-life of the biosensor was more <b>than</b> <b>three</b> <b>month</b> at 4 ºC and enzyme membrane can be re-used 20 times without any significant loss in enzyme activity...|$|R

The rebel barons concluded that peace with John was impossible, and turned to Philip II's son, the future Louis VIII, for help, offering him the English throne. The war soon settled into a stalemate.

5|$|During {{the late}} 1960s, Tyson Foods was devising {{new methods to}} broaden their market, {{including}} introducing smaller consumer packaging and landing military contracts.

5|$|Even Worse was {{released}} April 12, 1988, and, {{at the time}} of its release, was Yankovic's best selling album. Even Worse peaked at number 27 on the Billboard 200 on July 2, 1988. The album spent a total of 26 weeks on the chart. On July 18, 1988—less <b>than</b> <b>three</b> <b>months</b> after its release—the album was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). On January 27, 1994, the album was certified Platinum by the RIAA. At the time of its certification, it was Yankovic's first Platinum record and, until 1992, it was his best-selling album.|$|E
40|$|Because acute {{myocardial}} infarction may affect plasma lipid concentrations it is commonly recommended that assessment of these concentrations should be delayed until about <b>three</b> <b>months</b> after the acute event. A study was therefore conducted of fasting plasma lipid concentrations in 58 patients with acute {{myocardial infarction}}. Measurements were made during their stay in hospital (days 1, 2, and 9) and <b>three</b> <b>months</b> later. Triglyceride concentrations remained unchanged throughout. Values of total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein, and high density lipoprotein all fell significantly between {{the first two days}} and day 9. Total cholesterol and low density lipoprotein also showed significant falls between days 1 and 2. Nevertheless, fasting plasma lipid concentrations showed no significant difference {{at any time during the}} first 48 hours from values measured <b>three</b> <b>months</b> later. After the infarction 26 patients changed to eating less fat or less energy, or both. More patients had hypercholesterolaemia in the first 48 hours <b>than</b> at <b>three</b> <b>months.</b> These results suggest that lipid state may be assessed as accurately, and possibly more accurately, during the first 48 hours after {{acute myocardial infarction}} <b>than</b> at <b>three</b> <b>months...</b>|$|R

5|$|Oral {{antibiotics}} {{are recommended}} for no longer <b>than</b> <b>three</b> <b>months</b> as antibiotic courses exceeding this duration {{are associated with}} the development of antibiotic resistance and show no clear benefit over shorter courses. Furthermore, if long-term oral antibiotics beyond three months are thought to be necessary, it is recommended that benzoyl peroxide and/or a retinoid be used {{at the same time to}} limit the risk of P. acnes developing antibiotic resistance. Dapsone is not a first-line topical antibiotic due to higher cost and lack of clear superiority over other antibiotics. Topical dapsone is not recommended for use with benzoyl peroxide due to yellow-orange skin discoloration with this combination.|$|E
