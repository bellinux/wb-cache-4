5|$|Another {{game from}} the book is Civil War, a text-based {{computer}} game that puts the player against <b>the</b> <b>computer</b> <b>in</b> a simulation of the American Civil War. Civil War originated on multi-user mainframe computers in 1968, and simulates fourteen major battles of the conflict, with the human player as the South and the computer as the North. The player can control four direct variables which interact to determine a battle's outcome: how much of their {{money to spend on}} food, salaries, and ammunition, and which of four offensive or four defensive strategies to use. The side with the fewest casualties wins a battle, and if the player wins eight or more battles they win the game. After appearing in 101 BASIC Computer Games, Civil War was later {{one of a number of}} text-based games available on early 1980s pay-to-play systems.|$|E
5|$|The {{firewall}} scans for Internet-enabled {{applications and}} creates access rules {{based on a}} knowledge base maintained by Symantec during installation. In PC Magazine testing, the installation took 24 minutes to complete on a 750MHz Pentium III with 92 Internet-enabled applications. Using the firewall, users can determine whether to accept cookies, Java applets, and ActiveX controls on a global or per-site basis. A new feature, Intrusion Detection with AutoBlock, can detect port scans and block further intrusion attempts. The program provides notifications for intrusion attempts, stating the severity level and providing access to threat details. Alternatively, the firewall can put <b>the</b> <b>computer</b> <b>in</b> stealth, essentially hiding the system. Users can configure the security level, affecting the number of notifications. Testing conducted by PC Magazine using Shields Up and Symantec's Security Check found that the firewall successfully stealthed all ports, hiding the computer from view. A leak test was conducted to see the firewall's ability to detect outbound connections. Each attempt was detected and the suite offered to block the attempts.|$|E

5|$|Grand Prix – This mode has {{the player}} race against 7 (or 6) teams, which are {{controlled}} by <b>the</b> <b>computer,</b> <b>in</b> a series of predetermined courses. The player can choose to race using 3 different engine size classes: 50cc, 100cc and 150cc. A fourth unlockable class, Mirror Mode, allows the player to race through a mirrored version of the tracks using the 150cc engine size. Since all karts go faster when using higher engine sizes, the 4 classes serve as difficulty levels. There are 16 tracks, divided into 4 cups: Mushroom, Flower, Star and Special. A 5th cup has the player race in every track called the All-Cup Tour. The tour always starts with Luigi Circuit and ends with Rainbow Road, but the remaining tracks show up in random order. Every race is three laps long except for Baby Park and Wario Colosseum, which have 7 and 2, respectively. After all the human players cross the finish line, {{the positions of the}} computer-controlled teams are immediately locked in and they are given points based on those eight positions, ranging from 0 to 10. At the end of the cup, there will be an award ceremony for the 3 teams, where they will get a trophy ranging from bronze to gold. No matter which position they earned after each race, everyone will move on because of these new rules.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—If cluster C 1 {{consists}} of computers with a faster mean speed than <b>the</b> <b>computers</b> <b>in</b> cluster C 2, does this imply that cluster C 1 is more productive than cluster C 2 ? What if <b>the</b> <b>computers</b> <b>in</b> cluster C 1 {{have the same}} mean speed as <b>the</b> <b>computers</b> <b>in</b> cluster C 2 : is <b>the</b> one with <b>computers</b> that have a higher variance in speed more productive? Simulation experiments are performed to explore the above questions within a formal framework for measuring {{the performance of a}} cluster. Simulation results show that both mean speed and variance in speed (when mean speeds are equal) are typically correlated with the performance of a cluster, but not always; these statements are quantified statistically for our simulation environments. In addition, simulation results also show that: (1) If the mean speed of <b>computers</b> <b>in</b> cluster C 1 is faster by at least a threshold amount than the mean speed of <b>computers</b> <b>in</b> cluster C 2, then C 1 is more productive than C 2. (2) If <b>the</b> <b>computers</b> <b>in</b> clusters C 1 and C 2 have the same mean speed, then C 1 is more productive than C 2 when the variance <b>in</b> speed of <b>computers</b> <b>in</b> cluster C 1 is higher by at least a threshold amount than the variance <b>in</b> speed of <b>computers</b> <b>in</b> cluster C 2.

X features network transparency, which means an X program running on a computer somewhere on a network (such as the Internet) can display its user interface on an X server running on some other computer on the network. The X server is typically the provider of graphics resources and keyboard/mouse events to X clients, meaning that the X server is usually running on <b>the</b> <b>computer</b> <b>in</b> front of a human user, while the X client applications run anywhere on the network and communicate with the user's computer to request the rendering of graphics content and receive events from input devices including keyboards and mice.|$|E

In order to achieve the effect of time freezing around Lana just as she is about to get shot and fall to the ground, Kristin Kreuk had to lean against a structural support and hold her body still while filming. Beck and his team had to digitally remove the support from Kreuk, as well as the lower half of her body. They inserted a computer-generated lower half, as well as some hair trailing behind her in order to show that she was in the process of running when time stopped. As time returned to normal, what the audience sees is a completely computer-generated body fall out of frame, as only Lana’s lower half is in frame when time returns to normal.|$|E
25|$|The clocks at CERN and LNGS {{had to be}} in sync, and {{for this}} the {{researchers}} used high-quality GPS receivers, backed up with atomic clocks, at both places. This system timestamped both the proton pulse and the detected neutrinos to a claimed accuracy of 2.3nanoseconds. But the timestamp could not be read like a clock. At CERN, the GPS signal came only to a receiver at a central control room, and had to be routed with cables and electronics to <b>the</b> <b>computer</b> <b>in</b> the neutrino-beam control room which recorded the proton pulse measurement (Fig.3). The delay of this equipment was 10,085nanoseconds and this value had {{to be added to the}} time stamp. The data from the transducer arrived at the computer with a 580nanoseconds delay, and this value had to be subtracted from the time stamp. To get all the corrections right, physicists had to measure exact lengths of the cables and the latencies of the electronic devices. On the detector side, neutrinos were detected by the charge they induced, not by the light they generated, and this involved cables and electronics as part of the timing chain. Fig.4 shows the corrections applied on the OPERA detector side.|$|E

Without network externality this form of communication would have been impossible. Through P2P sharing the world as a culture are able to learn and teach each other through public forums. In Sugata Mitra’s Ted talk, “The child-driven education” he placed a computer in a third world town and left it there to see what would happen. To his amazement children were able to quickly figure out how to use the computer and educate themselves on its inner workings. This example is a benefit to society for several reasons. The first is the relationship between Sugata Mitra and the P2P network which led him to place <b>the</b> <b>computer</b> <b>in</b> a third world town, along with the ability to present his findings on a public forum. Secondly, it is those who consumed his ted talk and benefited from the knowledge that those in third world countries just need a chance to learn and they will take it. This experiment as a whole brings the culture of the world together and connects us with those we thought impossible due to the P2P network and network externality that led individuals to the Ted talk.|$|E
