Critics argue that the sales tax rate defined in the legislation would not be revenue neutral (that is, it would collect less for the government than the current tax system), and thus would increase the budget deficit, unless government spending were equally reduced.|$|E

This dissertation assessed and measured changes in <b>the</b> <b>poverty</b> <b>levels</b> in Egypt between 1974 / 75 and 1995 / 96 and investigated the sources of those changes in order to determine whether they resulted from economic growth or changes in the distribution of consumption expenditure among households and individuals. Another objective {{of the study was to}} examine the sensitivity of the results obtained to the choice of the analysis unit (individuals vs. households), the choice of <b>the</b> <b>poverty</b> measure, which concept of poverty is used (relative vs. absolute), and <b>the</b> choice of <b>poverty</b> lines. In this study, we estimated parameterized Lorenz curves for households' and individuals' grouped data. Poverty indexes were derived from the estimated Lorenz curves, and changes in <b>the</b> <b>poverty</b> <b>levels</b> were decomposed to their growth and distributional components. The study used three poverty measures (head-count, poverty-gap and severity of poverty) and applied multiple poverty lines to both individuals' and households' data. Two concepts of setting poverty lines were applied [...] -relative and absolute. The Gini inequality index was also calculated for each data set.

The {{purpose of this}} study was to examine the association between breastfeeding and <b>the</b> Federal <b>Poverty</b> <b>Level</b> in <b>the</b> United States. Data from 5, 397 women in the National Survey of Family Growth 2011 – 2013 survey were included in this study.

5|$|States that {{rejected}} the Medicaid expansion could maintain their Medicaid eligibility thresholds, which {{in many states}} were significantly below 133% of the poverty line. Many states did not make Medicaid available to childless adults at any income level. Because subsidies on exchange insurance plans were not available to those below the poverty line, such individuals had no new options. For example, in Kansas, where only able-bodied adults with children and with an income below 32% of the poverty line were eligible for Medicaid, those with incomes from 32% to 100% of <b>the</b> <b>poverty</b> <b>level</b> ($6,250 to $19,530 {{for a family of}} three) were ineligible for both Medicaid and federal subsidies to buy insurance.
