50|$|The BNC was {{the first}} text corpus of its size to be made widely available.

This arrangement may have been facilitated by the originality of the concept and the prominence associated with the project. However, it was a challenge to keep the identity of contributors hidden without discrediting the value of their work. Any distinct allusion to the identity of contributors was largely removed; the alternative solution of substituting the identity of a contributor with a different name was discussed, but not considered feasible.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we {{revisit the}} 2009 - 2012 episode in which Ofgem imposed a {{non-discrimination}} clause on large retailers in the UK energy market. <b>The</b> <b>Standard</b> <b>Licence</b> Condition 25 A (SLC 25 A) {{was introduced to}} prevent suppliers from charging their incumbent customers higher prices than their out-of-area customers. The SLC 25 A included a “sunset clause”, to allow the condition to lapse three years after its implementation. Several IO economists protested that the prohibition of spatial price discrimination would eventually lead to competition weakening. At {{the end of the}} three-year period, Ofgem decided not to renew SLC 25 A for any period. To further our understanding of Ofgem’s motives and its opponents’ arguments, we build a model where two local monopolists compete on a third market. We determine conditions where the obligation to set the same price {{in and out of the}} local market can result in a better or a worse situation for consumers. We show that even when the ban on price discrimination weakens competition, the average consumer can be better off...|$|E

40|$|The Green Drop Certification Programme, {{launched}} in 2008 alongside the Blue Drop Certification Programme, aims {{to provide the}} Department of Water Affairs with a national overview of how municipalities and their individual wastewater treatment works (WWTW) are complying with licence conditions set by the National Water Act (NWA) (No. 36 of 1998; DWAF 1998) and the Water Services Act (No. 108 of 1997; DWAF 1998). By publishing the results of each municipality’s performance, the programme aims to ensure continuous improvement in the wastewater treatment sector through public pressure. The programme has been identified by this project as a necessary linking tool between the NWA and the Water Services Act to ensure protection and sustainable use of South Africa’s natural water resources. It does this through assisting municipalities to improve their wastewater treatment operations which in theory will lead to discharged effluent that is compliant with discharge licence conditions. These discharge licences form part of the NWA’s enforcement tool of Source Directed Controls (SDC) which help a water resource meet the ecological goals set for {{it as part of}} Resource Directed Measures (RDM). The link between meeting the required SDC and achieving the RDM goals has never been empirically tested. This project aimed to determine the present ecological condition of the Uie River, a tributary of the Sundays River which the Sundays River Valley Municipality (SRVM) discharges its domestic effluent into. It then determined whether the SRVM’s WWTW was complying with <b>the</b> General <b>Standard</b> <b>licence</b> conditions and what the impact of the effluent on the river was through the analysis of monthly biomonitoring, water chemistry and habitat data. Lastly, the project examined the effectiveness of the Green Drop Certification Programme in bringing about change in the SRVM’s wastewater treatment sector, which previously achieved a Green Drop score of 5. 6 percent. It wanted to examine the underlying assumption that a WWTW which improves its Green Drop score will be discharging a better quality effluent that will help a water resource meets the RDM goals set for it. The Kirkwood WWTW did not have a discharge licence at the time of assessment and was thus assessed under <b>the</b> General <b>Standard</b> <b>licence</b> conditions. It was found that the Kirkwood WWTW was not complying with <b>the</b> General <b>Standard</b> discharge <b>licence</b> conditions in the Uie River. This was having a negative impact on the river health, mainly through high concentrations of Total Inorganic Nitrogen (TIN-N), orthophosphate and turbidity. The SRVM should see an improvement in its Green Drop score for the Kirkwood WWTW. However, the municipality showed no implementation of necessary programmes. Implementation of these programmes would help the SRVM meet <b>the</b> General <b>Standard</b> <b>licence</b> conditions (part of SDC) which would help the Uie River meet the RDM goals set for it...|$|R

Households Below Average Income, 1994 / 95 – 2014 / 15 (HBAI) uses household disposable incomes, after adjusting for the household size and composition, {{as a proxy for}} material living standards. More precisely, it is a proxy for the level of consumption of goods and services that people could attain given the disposable income of the household in which they live. In order to allow comparisons of <b>the</b> living <b>standards</b> of different types of households, income is adjusted to take into account variations in the size and composition of the households in a process known as equivalisation. A key assumption made in HBAI is that all individuals in the household benefit equally from the combined income of the household. This enables the total equivalised income of the household {{to be used as a}} proxy for <b>the</b> <b>standard</b> of living of each household member. The main source of data used in this study is the Family Resources Survey (FRS) (held at the UK Data Archive under GN 33283), which is a continuous cross-sectional survey. Further information, along with the latest publication, can be found on the Department for Work and Pensions' HBAI collection web page. An earlier HBAI study, Institute for Fiscal Studies Households Below Average Income Dataset, 1961 - 1991, is held at the Archive under SN 3300.

European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC) In 2005, the European Union (EU) made a legal obligation for member states to collect additional statistics on income and living conditions (EU-SILC). In addition to this the EU-SILC data cover poverty and social exclusion. These statistics are used to help plan and monitor European social policy by comparing poverty indicators and changes over time across the EU. The EU-SILC requirement was integrated into the General Household Survey (GHS) /General Lifestyle Survey (GLF) in 2005. Since the closure of the GLF in 2012 the cross-sectional element of EU-SILC has been collected via the FRS. The FRS also provides the first wave of the EU-SILC longitudinal element, which is carried out by the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Please refer to study documentation for further details. The purpose of this survey is to provide the Department of Social Security with up-to-date detailed data for policy monitoring and evaluation, benefit expenditure forecasting, and other analyses such as Households Below Average Income.

40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. The Community Life Survey was first commissioned by the Cabinet Office in 2012 - 2013. It is a household survey conducted in England, tracking the latest trends and developments across areas key to encouraging social action and empowering communities, including: volunteering and charitable giving; views about the local area; community cohesion and belonging; community empowerment and participation; influencing local decisions and affairs; and subjective well-being. The objectives of the survey are to: provide robust, nationally representative data on behaviours and attitudes within communities to inform and direct policy and action in these areas; to provide data of value to all users, including public bodies, external stakeholders and the public; and underpin further research and debate on building stronger communities To date, the survey has been conducted by face-to-face interview, with the resulting data forming Official Statistics. However, {{as part of the}} drive for cost savings and to align with digital advances, from 2013 - 2014 an investigation into the viability of switching to online data collection has been ongoing. From this date, the Community Life Survey has been conducted online. Further information may be found on the gov. uk Community Life Survey website. The Community Life Survey incorporates a small number of priority measures from the Citizenship Survey, which ran from 2001 - 2011, conducted by the Department for Communities and Local Government. These measures were incorporated in the Community Life Survey so that trends in these issues could continue to be tracked over time. (The full Citizenship Survey series is held at the UK Data Archive under GNs 33347 and 33474.) The 2013 - 14 survey covers May 2013 to April 2014 and forms 'Official Statistics', meaning that it meets <b>the</b> high <b>standards</b> of quality set out by the Code of Practice for Official Statistics. End User Licence and Special Licence data Users should note that there are two versions of each Community Life Survey dataset.
