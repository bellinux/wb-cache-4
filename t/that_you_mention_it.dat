She stated that for her, saying [...] "goodbye" [...] is sufficient because it expresses the same well-wishing farewell sentiment. Leil Lowndes {{wrote in her}} 2009book How to Instantly Connect with Anyone that if someone says [...] "have a nice day", the recipient should refrain from sarcastically responding [...] "Thanks, but I have other plans" [...] or [...] "Gee, I was planning on having a miserable one, but now <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>mention</b> <b>it,</b> I think I'll have a nice one." [...] Lowndes suggested that the response merely be [...] "You, too." ...|$|E

6000|$|His {{permitting}} {{a servant}} {{to be an}} obstacle in his way, when he wished to speak to his wife, was a concession so entirely unbecoming in {{the master of the}} house, and so strangely contrary to his customary sense of what was due to himself, that Iris called him back in astonishment. She looked at her maid, who at once understood her, and withdrew. [...] "What can you possibly be thinking of?" [...] she said to her husband, when they were alone.

Well, {{all we can do}} is to hope that the fellow has not thought of our taking such a precaution, and that my messenger will arrive unmolested. Still, I acknowledge that the idea makes me anxious, and I fear that we shall not get through without serious trouble. There are so many disbanded soldiers, and other knaves, in the forests that de Tulle would have no difficulty in hiring any number of them, and carrying his scheme out without the assistance or knowledge of his own tenants. The heavy taxation necessary to keep up the expenses of the court has driven numbers of people to despair, and many hitherto law-abiding folk are being forced to leave their holdings, and to take to unlawful courses.|$|E

5000|$|Following {{the release}} of the 2017 film Logan, Liev Schreiber {{confirmed}} via twitter that he had personally been invited back by Hugh Jackman for the project during the movie's development. Writer Scott Frank revealed that early versions of the script included the character, but that the element was removed from the final screenplay. Elaborating on the character's role, he stated [...] "There was a moment when we were thinking about, as I recall, Jim Mangold had an idea where when they were on the run, and they go to the gambling town, there may have been at that point they were going to see Sabretooth for help. He was {{going to be there for}} help. Now <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>mention</b> <b>it!</b> I wouldn't swear to it, but we thought that would have been an interesting thing to do. And then for whatever reason we didn't do it." [...] Director James Mangold explained the decision to cut certain characters from the screenplay, stating [...] "There were times early on in the story where I played with the idea of Hugh coming along, and I don't want to give away anything, but I played with there being an underground railroad where there were a couple of other mutants that he met on the journey. It always seemed to detract from the loneliness of the story though and became a kind of cameo." [...] Schreiber later elaborated [...] "There was an invitation early on from Hugh (and director James Mangold) and I would have loved to work on it. It was very difficult given Ray Donovan’s schedule, and I think they went a different direction as well with story." ...|$|E

Dr Nowak examined Amber, performed a rapid strep test, which was positive, and informed her that she had a streptococcal pharyngitis. “Try not to kiss any boys this week, ” Dr Nowak said with a smile. “Actually, now <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>mention</b> <b>it,</b> ” Amber said, “that’s something I wanted to ask you about. My boyfriend and I have been together {{for more than a year}} now, and we’ve been talking seriously about marriage. ” “That’s great! I’m glad to hear things are going well, ” Dr Nowak said. “Well, that’s not all: we feel we’re ready to start having sex, and I need to ask you to write me a prescription for birth control pills. ” Dr Nowak paused for a moment, then explained, “You know, Amber, I appreciate you sharing this with me, but I imagine you know how I feel about premarital sex. As your doctor, friend, and fellow Christian, I think this is an unwise decision, and I can’t in good conscience help you do something I think is wrong. ” “But doctor, we’ve both thought about it, and we love each other, so why put it off any longer?” “As a physician, ” Dr Nowak replied, “I’m committed to doing what’s in my patients’ best interest. And I believe, based on the Scriptures we both read and on our common understanding of God’s nature and purposes for us, that sex is the consummation of a spiritual union between husband and wife. Sex is created by God to be enjoyed in the context of marriage, and saving it for that moment makes it all the more special. I realize that’s difficult, and it’s not what our culture at large believes. But if we call ourselves Christians, we need to carry our beliefs into every aspect of our identity? including something as personal as our sexuality. ...|$|E
