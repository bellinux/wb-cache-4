500|$|... "Office Olympics" [...] {{was written}} by Michael Schur. This episode was the first episode of the series {{directed}} by Paul Feig. Producer Greg Daniels said {{the idea for the}} actual Office Olympics stemmed from The King of the Hill Office Olympics, which were created and ran by Daniel's former assistant Tim Croston and the show's two production assistants at the time: Tony Gennaro and Seranie Manoogian. The games were held in the King of the Hill offices, where Daniel served as executive producer. Daniels later elaborated on the types of games they played, stating [...] "Like, who’s going to get off the elevator first and races in chairs. <b>The</b> <b>funny</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> then it became a TV episode and it has now gone full circle and I hear offices are doing it all over." [...] After the episode aired, other [...] "Office Olympics" [...] were organized in actual offices across the country. The Chicago Tribune organized an interview with a majority of The Office cast members who—in character—explained the rules to the various games. The Yogurt Lid Medals reappear in the third season finale, [...] "The Job": Receiving the lid and a note from Pam is the catalyst for Jim's decision between Pam and Karen.|$|E
500|$|In 2011, {{staff writer}} Al Jean {{commented on the}} episode: [...] "The idea of it to parody EC Comics was really {{original}} and kind of shocking for a cartoon on network television. [...] Jim Brooks said, 'We better have a disclaimer {{at the beginning of}} this Halloween show,' so Marge came out and warned people that they were going to see something scary. And <b>the</b> <b>funny</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> it's now very tame by our Halloween standards and by network animation standards." [...] According to M. Keith Booker, author of Drawn to Television, the warning only made the episode more attractive to children. The entire segment was a parody of the opening of the 1931 film Frankenstein. While similar [...] "warnings" [...] were used to open the second and third [...] "Treehouse" [...] episodes, these quickly became a burden to write and there was no warning for the fourth episode. Instead, it had Marge ask Bart to warn people how frightening the show was during his introduction paying homage to Night Gallery. The tradition was revived for [...] "Treehouse of Horror V"; after that, they were permanently dropped and the writers did not make any attempts at reviving them. In the opening segment of the episode, and the four subsequent episodes, the camera zooms through a cemetery where tombstones with humorous epitaphs can be seen. These messages include the names of canceled shows from the previous television season and celebrities such as Walt Disney and Jim Morrison. They were last used in [...] "Treehouse of Horror V", which included a solitary tombstone with the words [...] "Amusing Tombstones" [...] to signal this. The tombstone gags were easy for the writers in the first episode, but like Marge's warnings, they eventually got more difficult to write, so they were abandoned. Of the series, [...] "Treehouse of Horror" [...] was the only one that included a treehouse as a setting. [...] "Treehouse of Horror" [...] was the first time that an alternate version of the theme that airs over the end credits was used. Originally it was supposed to use a theremin (an early electronic musical instrument), but one could not be found that could hit all the necessary notes.|$|E

500|$|The {{licensing}} arm of Paramount {{took the}} step of significantly expanding retail distribution beyond specialty stores (Hot Topic, Spencer's) to big chains (Target, J.C. Penney), which involved carefully stripping T-shirts of racy slogans {{from the television}} show. Licensing industry observers credited Comedy Central with carving out a profitable niche in an industry dominated by powerful partnerships that link fast-food chains and Hollywood movie studios, which was particularly tough for South Park, as no fast-food chains wanted to ally themselves with the show's racy content. Eventually, J.C. Penney ended the tie-ins with the show in April 1999 {{as a result of}} customer complaints. On July 7, 1999, Parker and Stone appeared on Late Night with Conan O'Brien to promote the film's release. During the interview, Parker and Stone showed a clip of the film in which a caricature of O'Brien, played by Brett Spiner, hands over Terrence and Phillip to the US government and jumps to his death from the set of Late Night. Upon seeing the clip, a bemused O'Brien responded that his interns saw the film and thought it was [...] "really funny", but were annoyed that the Late Night set was portrayed as {{on the top floor of}} the GE Building, when it was really on the sixth floor. The film also suffered negative publicity before release. It was initially reported that on the day of the Columbine High School massacre, a friend of the killers (Chris Morris) was seen wearing a black T-shirt depicting characters from South Park. Both Parker and Stone come from Colorado, and Stone went to Heritage High School, not far from Columbine High. He proceeded to take three days off from work following the shootings. [...] "Nothing seemed funny after that," [...] he said. South Park was, at the time, generally waning in popularity: ratings dropped nearly 40 percent with the premiere of the series' third season and, according to Entertainment Weekly, [...] "it [...] the pop-culture behemoth it was last year [...]" [...] In response to the decline, Parker commented, [...] "Suddenly we suck and we're not cool anymore. <b>The</b> <b>funny</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is,</b> last year we were saying the same things and we were hip, fresh, and cute. Now they're telling us we're pushing 30, we're failures, and we're sellouts." ...|$|E

Luke and Noah's portrayers, Hansis and Silbermann, spoke with magazine The Advocate about the attention the storyline has generated. [...] "The fan response has been really great to both the individual characters and where we're taking the relationship," [...] Silbermann stated. [...] "Noah and Luke were voted top couple in a Soap Opera Digest poll. <b>The</b> <b>funny</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is,</b> a lot of people want them to be happy, but a lot want them to suffer heartache and tragedy [...] because that's what couples on daytime TV do. It's a good sign, actually."

2500|$|Songs to Remember {{received}} a favourable reception from the UK music press on its release. Melody Maker stated that [...] "Green's determination to stamp his brandmark into the nation's consciousness is {{reflected by the}} album's pompous title... Yet <b>the</b> <b>funny</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> those dubious proclamations just aren't needed because the arrogance embodied in the title is emphatically based on vinyl reality... Some people may find Green's sugary vocals and Adam Kidron's lush production {{just a little too}} refined; listening to Scritti can be a bit like having honey tipped down your ears, but that seems like a perfect design for mainstream invasion. If justice prevailed Songs to Remember would be number one across the globe... You'd have to go back a long way to find a better pop record than this – back to the Sixties probably." [...] NME noted that six of the album's nine tracks had already appeared in some form on the singles, and wryly described Songs to Remember as [...] "Scritti Politti's greatest hits... It's by no means a disturbing record to listen to, which is why it could appeal to the timid, but Green's lyrical preoccupations – language, definitions, the way one's preconceptions determine and control perception – would intrigue the curious... Songs to Remember is witty, ingenious, likeable and probably in the public interest." [...] Smash Hits felt that [...] "the two years it took to make may have blunted its impact somewhat" [...] but [...] "there's more than enough in Songs to Remember to establish Scritti Politti as the acceptable face of intellectual pop." ...|$|E

6000|$|Sunday {{last the}} Alameda returned. Your mother was off bright and early with Palema, {{for it is}} a very curious thing, but is {{certainly}} the case, that she was very impatient to get news of a young person by the name of Austin. Mr. Gurr lent a horse for the Captain--it was a pretty big horse, but our handsome Captain, as you know, is a very big Captain indeed. Now, do you remember Misifolo--a tall, thin Hovea boy that came shortly before you left? He had been riding up this same horse of Gurr's just the day before, and the horse threw him off at Motootua corner, and cut his hip. So Misifolo called out to the Captain as he rode by that that was a very bad horse, that it ran away and threw people off, and that he had best be careful; and <b>the</b> <b>funny</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is,</b> that the Captain did not like it at all. The foal might as well have tried to run away with Vailima as that horse with Captain Morse, which is poetry, as you see, into the bargain; but the Captain was not at all in that way of thinking, and was never really happy until he had got his foot on ground again. It was just then that the horse began to be happy too, so they parted in one mind. But the horse is still wondering what kind of piece of artillery he had brought up to Vailima last Sunday morning. So far it was all right. The Captain was got safe off the wicked horse, but how was he to get back again to Apia and the Alameda? ...|$|E
