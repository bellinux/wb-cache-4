25|$|There {{were two}} reasons for this shift in {{preferred}} subject. The first was that Mexican society denigrated colonial culture—the indigenous past was seen as more truly Mexican. <b>The</b> <b>other</b> <b>factor</b> was a worldwide movement among artists to confront society, which began around 1830. In Mexico, this anti-establishment sentiment was directed at the Academy of San Carlos and its European focus.|$|E

25|$|A {{key factor}} was the disinterest of the parents, whose main {{motivation}} for sending {{their children to}} the Scoletas appears to have been that they were looked after for a few hours and given a meal every day, rather than an interest in preserving Romansh. <b>The</b> <b>other</b> <b>factor</b> was that after entering primary school, the children received a few hours a week of Romansh instruction at best. As a result, the last Scoletas were closed in the 1960s with the exception of Präz, where the Scoleta remained open until 1979.|$|E
25|$|The Third Reform Act of 1885 widened {{the number}} of males {{eligible}} to vote to 60% of the population. Males paying an annual rental of £10, or holding land valued at £10 or over, were now eligible to vote. <b>The</b> <b>other</b> <b>factor</b> was the reorganization of constituency boundaries, and a candidate who for years had been returned unopposed suddenly found part of his electorate was from an area outside of his influence. Thus the national power of the landed aristocrats and gentry was slowly diminished. The ruling class was slowly ceasing to rule. In 1888 the creation of local elected authorities {{in the form of}} county councils eroded their immediate local power too. The final blow, the reform of the House of Lords in 1911, proved to be {{the beginning of the end}} for the country house lifestyle which had been enjoyed in a similar way for generations of the upper classes.|$|E
25|$|The {{treaty was}} part of the greater Indian Removal policy, {{originally}} proposed by President Thomas Jefferson, by which the Five Civilized Tribes were to allow for white settlement in the south by ceding their territory and relocating west of the Mississippi River. It was one of several removal treaties signed by the Muscogee, Choctaw, Chickasaw, and Cherokee in the 1830s relocating them to the new territories in present-day Oklahoma and Arkansas. The Chickasaw were essentially doomed to removal with the others, when, in 1806 Jefferson promised the southern states that the Federal Government would encourage the migration of all Indians to land west of the Mississippi. <b>The</b> <b>other</b> <b>factor</b> underlying the removal of the Indians was land speculation, one of the primary sources of money for the landed aristocracy of the South {{since the early days of}} the Virginia colony. The trio of Andrew Jackson, John Coffee and James Jackson (unrelated), were each land speculators, militiamen and politicians who worked the cessions of huge tracts of Indians lands, the defeat of Indian resistance and eventually the complete removal of the Chickasaw, as well as the rest of the Five Civilized Tribes, to make way for white settlers –often at great personal profit.|$|E

500|$|In his {{analysis}} of the four cases of fallen civilizations, he notes that two (Easter Island and Sumer) failed due to depletion of natural resources—"their ecologies were unable to regenerate." [...] The other two failed in their heartlands, [...] "where ecological demand was highest," [...] but left remnant populations that survived. He asks the question: [...] "Why, if civilizations so often destroy themselves, has the overall experiment of civilization done so well." [...] For the answer, he says, we must look to natural regeneration and human migration (Wright, 102). [...] While some ancient civilizations were depleting their ecologies and failing, others were rising. Large expanses of the planet were unsettled. <b>The</b> <b>other</b> <b>factor,</b> evident in both Egypt and China, was that due to abundant resources (e.g., topsoil), farming methods (ones that worked with, rather than against, natural cycles), and settlement patterns, these civilizations had greater longevity (103-104).|$|E

According to the same index series, even [...] "dedicated short bias" [...] funds had a return of −6.08% during September 2008.

2500|$|Information {{theory was}} a fashionable {{scientific}} {{approach in the}} mid '50s. However, pioneer Claude Shannon wrote in 1956 that this trendiness was dangerous. He said, [...] "Our fellow scientists in many different fields, attracted by the fanfare and by the new avenues opened to scientific analysis, are using these ideas in their own problems...It will be all too easy for our somewhat artificial prosperity to collapse overnight when it is realized {{that the use of}} a few exciting words like information, entropy, redundancy, do not solve all our problems." [...] During the next decade, a combination of factors shut down the application of information theory to natural language processing (NLP) problemsin particular machine translation. One factor was the 1957 publication of Noam Chomsky's Syntactic Structures, which stated, [...] "probabilistic models give no insight into the basic problems of syntactic structure". This accorded well with the philosophy of the artificial intelligence research of the time, which promoted rule-based approaches. <b>The</b> <b>other</b> <b>factor</b> was the 1966 ALPAC report, which recommended that the government should stop funding research into machine translation. ALPAC chairman John Pierce later said that the field was filled with [...] "mad inventors or untrustworthy engineers". He said that the underlying linguistic problems must be solved before attempts at NLP could be reasonably made. These elements essentially halted research in the field.|$|E
