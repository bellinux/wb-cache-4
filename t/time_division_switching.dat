40|$|Time Division Multiplexing is {{a method}} of {{transmitting}} and receiving independent signals over a common signal path by means of synchronized switches {{at each end of}} the transmission line so that each signal appears on the line only a fraction of time in an alternating pattern. This form of signal multiplexing was developed in telecommunications for telegraphy systems in the late 1800 s, but found its most common application in digital telephony in the second half of the 20 th century.

40|$|Telecommunication {{networks}} of <b>time</b> <b>division</b> <b>switches,</b> interconnected by digital transmission {{are being put}} into place. At each switch, each incoming bit stream is brought into its own buffer. Then the clock in the switch reads each buffer to re-establish phase. Care {{must be taken to}} keep frequency differences between various clocks from becoming too large. Based on empirically defined data transmission requirements, one major network has determined that fractional frequency inequality between switches should be no worse than 1. 7 X 10 to the minus 9 power. A network needs near frequency equality between its own switches, and also between its switches and other networks with which it interfaces. As a practical matter, the best way to achieve needed frequency equality is for each network to have master clock with an accuracy which is at least as good as 1 X 10 to the minus 10 power. The relationship between the master and the secondary clock is discussed. The questions of master clock accuracy and precision and the free-running capability of the secondary clocks are examined...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 101 - 103). In {{order for}} an electronic telephone switching system to perform its functions without loss of credits and earnings from customers, accurate reliability should be predicted before system release. A methodology for making this prediction is developed {{within the context}} of a particular system (<b>Time</b> <b>Division</b> <b>Switching</b> System). A bottom-up approach was used for system reliability prediction with step-by-step methods from component or circuit pack level to board, block, subsystem, and system level. For important component or circuit pack level reliability, a suitable model selection method of failure occurrences is recommended along with its parameter estimation method using statistical analysis. For expensive board level reliability, a weak link identification method and a reliability improving method are recommended. For inexpensive block level reliability, its components or circuit packs reliability were calculated from a model that included part stress analysis. For software reliability prediction, a suitable model selection method of failure occurrences is recommended, along with maximum likelihood parameter estimation. An objective failure intensity set-up method based on system test cost and system operation cost is recommended along with a prediction method of additional testing time required before system release. It was verified that a <b>Time</b> <b>Division</b> <b>Switching</b> system satisfied the reliability recommended by the International Telegraph and Telephone Consult Committee. In addition, the percentages of hardware reliability and software reliability were predicted along with each subsystem reliability, unavailability, number of failures, down time, mean time to first failure, and failure intensity.

40|$|This paper proposes {{switchable}} radial stub resonator for isolation {{improvement of}} Single Pole Double Throw (SPDT) discrete <b>switch</b> for <b>Time</b> <b>Division</b> Duplex (TDD) <b>switching</b> of wireless communications. A commercialized discrete PIN diode {{is used to}} switch the radial stub resonator between bandstop to allpass response where an analytical modeling of the switchable resonator is presented and analyzed. In this analysis, correlation between inner radial and angle radial stub with the characteristic impedance and attenuation pole is determined. Isolation improvement is analyzed with two-port network of single shunt PIN diode with switchable radial stub resonator where {{it is found that}} an additional isolation can be obtained with the switchable radial stub resonator. In measurement result, the SPDT switch with switchable radial stub resonator has shown more than 30 dB of transmit-receive (Tx-Rx) isolation at centre frequency of 3. 5 GHz giving better isolation compared to conventional SPDT switch design. The potential application of this SPDT switch is TDD switching for WiMAX and LTE communication system...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{considers}} the transmitter design for wireless information and energy transfer (WIET) in a multiple-input single-output (MISO) interference channel (IFC). The design {{problem is to}} maximize the system throughput (i. e., the weighted sum rate) subject to individual energy harvesting constraints and power constraints. Different from the conventional IFCs without energy harvesting, the cross-link signals in the considered scenario play two opposite roles in information detection (ID) and energy harvesting (EH). It is observed that the ideal scheme, where the receivers can simultaneously perform ID and EH from the received signal, may not always achieve the best tradeoff between information transfer and energy harvesting, but simple practical schemes based on time splitting may perform better. We therefore propose two practical time splitting schemes, namely <b>time</b> <b>division</b> mode <b>switching</b> (TDMS) and <b>time</b> <b>division</b> multiple access (TDMA), {{in addition to a}} power splitting (PS) scheme which separates the received signal into two parts for ID and EH, respectively. In the two-user scenario, we show that beamforming is optimal to all the schemes. Moreover, the design problems associated with the TDMS and TDMA schemes admit semi-analytical solutions. In the general K-user scenario, a successive convex approximation method is proposed to handle the WIET problems associated with the ideal scheme and the PS scheme, which are known to be NP-hard in general. The K-user TDMS and TDMA schemes are shown efficiently solvable as convex problems. Simulation results show that stronger cross-link channel powers actually improve the information sum rate under energy harvesting constraints. Moreover, none of the schemes under consideration can dominate another in terms of the sum rate performance. Comment: 13 pages, 10 pt, two columns, 11 figures, submitted to IEEE Trans.

40|$|The general time-space-time {{switching}} {{problem in}} telecommunications requires {{the use of}} multichannel time slot interchangers. In this paper, we propose two multichannel time slot sorters which sort N <b>time</b> <b>division</b> multiplexed (TDM) optical inputs, arranged as N frames with N time slots per frame using O(N log N) optical switch elements. The TDM optical inputs are sorted in place without expanding the space-time fabric into a space <b>division</b> <b>switch.</b> The hardware components used are 2 Θ 2 optical switches (LiNbO 3 directional couplers) and optical delay lines connected in a feed forward fashion. Two space-time variants of the spatial odd-even merge algorithm are used to design the sorters. By maintaining the number of shift-exchange operations invariant at each stage, the proposed sorters use fewer switches than previously proposed sorters using switches with feedback line delays, (the K-switch in [21]), and other sorters using switches with feed forward line delays [22, 23]...|$|R

40|$|In {{computer}} networks messages are transmitted through switches {{in order to}} reach destinations. Cross point switches are the simplest technique which requires one-to-one connection between input and output. The limitation of a cross bar switch technology is that if numbers of lines are large then cross point increases in huge amount consequently increasing the dimension of the <b>switch.</b> Space <b>division</b> <b>switches</b> are used to route the calls, which implies betterment over the cross bar technology. Actually it is built up of several smaller rectangular crossbars. This takes the advantage over the crossbar switches that less cross points are needed in the space <b>division</b> <b>switches.</b> The limitations of space <b>division</b> <b>switches</b> are that if more the number of cross points then there is increase the outgoing reaching probabilities of messages but the cost and overheads is also high with lesser cross points the congestion increases. In this paper we considered the architecture of a three crossbar space-division switch and assumed a Markov chain model for the transitional analysis of message flow. With the help of simulation study it is concluded that the impact of reaching probabilities for the different values of parameters must be kept in mind while designing this switch by designers...|$|R
