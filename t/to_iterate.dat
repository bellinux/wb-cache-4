Introduction. We consider Markov operators corresponding <b>to</b> <b>Iterated</b> Function Systems defined on a Polish space. The starting point for our consideration is the paper of Lasota and Yorke [4], where the similar results were proved for locally compact spaces. The results of Lasota and Yorke {{are based on the}} Prokhorov condition which allows to construct a stationary distribution. In this paper the existence of a stationary distribution is proved {{due to the fact that}} the space of all distributions with a suitable metric is a complete metric space.

40|$|This paper makes a {{foundational}} {{contribution to}} the discussions on {{the very nature of}} belief change operations. Belief revision and belief update are investigated within an abstract framework of epistemic states and (qualitative or quantitative) conditionals. Moreover, we distinguish between background knowledge and contextual information in order to analyse belief change more appropriately. The rich epistemic representation framework allows us to make a clear conceptual distinction between revision and update on the one side, while revealing structural similarities on the other side. We propose generic postulates for revision and update that also apply <b>to</b> <b>iterated</b> change. Furthermore, we complete the unifying picture by introducing universal inference operations as a proper counterpart in nonmonotonic reasoning <b>to</b> <b>iterated</b> belief change...|$|R

6000|$|Dr. Johnson {{does not}} appear {{sufficiently}} attentive to the true character and nature of pastoral poetry. No doubt it is natural for a young poet to initiate himself by pastorals; for what youthful heart does not glow at the descriptions of rural nature, and scenes that accord with its own innocency and cheerfulness; but although pastorals do not, {{in the sense of}} Dr. Johnson, imitate real life, nor require any great insight into human passions and characters, yet there are many things necessary in this species of composition, more than Dr. Johnson seems to require. The chief thing is an eye for picturesque and rural scenery, and an intimate acquaintance with those minute and particular appearances of nature, which alone can give a lively and original colour to the painting of pastoral poetry. To copy the common descriptions of spring or summer, morning or evening, or <b>to</b> <b>iterate</b> from Virgil the same complaints of the same shepherds, is not surely to write pastoral poetry.
