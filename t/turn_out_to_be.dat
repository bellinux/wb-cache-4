5|$|In Washington, sea otters {{are found}} almost {{exclusively}} on the outer coasts. They can swim as close as six feet off shore along the Olympic coast. Reported sightings of sea otters in the San Juan Islands and Puget Sound almost always <b>turn</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> North American river otters, which are commonly seen along the seashore. However, biologists have confirmed isolated sightings of sea otters in these areas since the mid-1990s.|$|E
5|$|One of {{his most}} lasting {{legacies}} may <b>turn</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> his {{creation of a new}} annual tournament called the Laver Cup which pits Europe against the rest of the world.

5|$|The Yankees would however receive {{one notable}} moment of glory against the Red Sox during this era. On April 24, 1917 Yankee pitcher George Mogridge threw a no-hitter at Fenway Park, {{the first in}} the ball park's history and first in Yankee history. It would also <b>turn</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the Yankees' only no-hitter where they allowed a run as they would win the game, 2â€“1.|$|E

5|$|Adders are {{not usually}} aggressive, tending to be rather timid and biting only when cornered or alarmed. People are {{generally}} bitten only after stepping on them or attempting to pick them up. They will usually disappear into the undergrowth at a hint of any danger, but will return once all is quiet, often to the same spot. Occasionally, individual snakes will reveal their presence with a loud and sustained hissing, hoping to warn off potential aggressors. Often, these <b>turn</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> pregnant females. When the adder is threatened, the front {{part of the body}} is drawn into an S-shape to prepare for a strike.|$|E
5|$|In 1958, the British Empire and Commonwealth Games {{were held}} in Cardiff. The event was (to date) the biggest {{sporting}} event ever held in Wales; however, {{it would not have}} been possible without the financial support given by the WRU and the Cardiff Athletic Club. Both the opening and closing ceremonies took place at Cardiff Arms Park, plus all the track and field events, on what had been the greyhound track. It would <b>turn</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the last time that South Africa would participate in the Games until 1994. South Africa withdrew from the Commonwealth Games in 1961.|$|E

5|$|In general, {{the term}} duality {{refers to a}} {{situation}} where two seemingly different physical systems <b>turn</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> equivalent in a nontrivial way. If two theories are related by a duality, it means that one theory can be transformed in some way so that it ends up looking just like the other theory. The two theories are then said to be dual to one another under the transformation. Put differently, the two theories are mathematically different descriptions of the same phenomena.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of the success, the Massachusetts {{provisional}} government agreed to organize an expedition on a larger scale against Quebec, the capital of New France, and gave its command to Phips. Originally intending to coordinate with a simultaneous overland attack on Montreal launched from Albany, New York, the expedition's departure was delayed in the vain hope that needed munitions would arrive from England. The expedition, counting 34 ships and more than 2,000 soldiers, finally sailed on August 20. It was short on ammunition, had no pilots familiar with the Saint Lawrence River, and carried what would <b>turn</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> inadequate provisions.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Lois urges Peter {{to watch}} {{relationship}} videos with her, but the videos <b>turn</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> pornography hosted by Dr. Amanda Rebecca, who strips after asking {{the women to}} leave the room. Peter becomes addicted to the videos, much to Lois's chagrin. She gets herself {{on the end of}} one of the tapes in black lingerie and entices Peter. While kissing, Peter rewinds the tape, playing the part of Lois taking her robe off over and over.|$|E

5|$|Mutations in germ-line DNA (i.e., DNA of {{the sperm}} or egg, which {{manifest}} in the offspring). These occur spontaneously, or are triggered by environmental radiation or mutagenic chemicals. A recently discovered mechanism, {{which is likely to}} be more important than the others combined, is infections with viruses, which integrate their DNA into their hosts. Organisms do not want to mutate: mutation just happens. Most of the mutations are harmful or lethal to the offspring, but a very small minority <b>turn</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> advantageous, as novel proteins get produced that serve new functions.|$|E
5|$|The mirror {{symmetry}} {{relationship is}} a particular example of what physicists call a duality. In general, the term duality refers to a situation where two seemingly different physical theories <b>turn</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> equivalent in a nontrivial way. If one theory can be transformed so it looks just like another theory, the two {{are said to be}} dual under that transformation. Put differently, the two theories are mathematically different descriptions of the same phenomena. Such dualities {{play an important role in}} modern physics, especially in string theory.|$|E
5|$|The {{status of}} the period 7 {{congener}} of the noble gases, oganesson (Og), is not knownâ€”it {{may or may not}} be a noble gas. It was originally predicted to be a noble gas but may instead be a fairly reactive solid with an anomalously low first ionisation potential, due to relativistic effects. On the other hand, if relativistic effects peak in period 7 at element 112, copernicium (as is thought to be the case), oganesson may <b>turn</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a noble gas after all, albeit more reactive than either xenon or radon. Regardless, oganesson is predicted to be a nonmetal, and probably the only one in period 7.|$|E
50|$|The design also <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> unsatisfactory. The {{network of}} {{corridors}} was so labyrinthine {{that even the}} warders got lost; and the ventilation system allowed sound to carry, so that prisoners could communicate between cells. The annual running costs <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> an unsupportable Â£16,000.|$|R

5|$|Written by Edward Young, this is {{a horror}} story set in an {{isolated}} house. It would feature a group of university staff, one who was a cripple, trapped in the house during winter. One of the characters would <b>turn</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a murderer. The story took its name and theme from the poem Night-Thoughts by Edward Young, namesake of the story's writer. It was later adapted by Young for Big Finish in February 2006. The adaptation featured the Seventh Doctor and Ace, as well as Big Finish-original companion Hex.|$|E
5|$|All of the {{discovered}} {{alkali metals}} occur in nature as their compounds: {{in order of}} abundance, sodium is the most abundant, followed by potassium, lithium, rubidium, caesium, and finally francium, which is very rare due to its extremely high radioactivity; francium occurs only in the minutest traces in nature as an intermediate step in some obscure side branches of the natural decay chains. Experiments have been conducted to attempt the synthesis of ununennium (Uue), {{which is likely to}} be the next member of the group, but they have all met with failure. However, ununennium may not be an alkali metal due to relativistic effects, which are predicted to have a large influence on the chemical properties of superheavy elements; even if it does <b>turn</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> an alkali metal, it is predicted to have some differences in physical and chemical properties from its lighter homologues.|$|E
5|$|Allosauridae {{is one of}} four {{families}} in Carnosauria; the other three are Neovenatoridae, Carcharodontosauridae and Sinraptoridae. Allosauridae has at times been proposed as ancestral to the Tyrannosauridae (which would make it paraphyletic), one recent example being Gregory S. Paul's Predatory Dinosaurs of the World, but this has been rejected, with tyrannosaurids identified as members of a separate branch of theropods, the Coelurosauria. Allosauridae is the smallest of the carnosaur families, with only Saurophaganax and a currently unnamed French allosauroid accepted as possible valid genera besides Allosaurus in the most recent review. Another genus, Epanterias, is a potential valid member, but it and Saurophaganax may <b>turn</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> large examples of Allosaurus. Recent reviews have kept the genus Saurophaganax and included Epanterias with Allosaurus.|$|E
