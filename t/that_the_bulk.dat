5|$|Initially, the Brabant Revolution {{was also}} able to {{continue}} unthreatened {{because of the lack}} of external opposition. Soon after the revolution started, Joseph II had fallen ill. Following its defeats at the hands of the patriot army in the initial campaign, the only Austrian force in the region, taking refuge in Luxembourg, could not challenge the rebels alone. The ongoing conflict with the Ottoman Empire also meant <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>bulk</b> of Austria's own army could not be spared to put down the rebellion.|$|E
5|$|The 1224 carucage was a tax levied {{only on the}} clergy, and the {{revenues}} from it did not appear in that year's Pipe Roll. It {{is likely that the}} clergy who owed the carucage also collected the tax. Records indicate <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>bulk</b> of the money raised was paid into the Wardrobe, the king's personal treasury, rather than the Exchequer. The 1224 assessment was based on ploughteams, and was imposed to pay for the restitution of the lost lands in France.|$|E
5|$|Chief of the OKH, General Franz Halder, Fedor von Bock, the {{commander}} of Army Group Center, and almost all the German generals involved in Operation Barbarossa argued vehemently in favor of continuing the all-out drive toward Moscow. Besides the psychological importance of capturing the Soviet capital, the generals pointed out that Moscow was a major center of arms production, {{the center of the}} Soviet communications system and an important transport hub. Intelligence reports indicated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>bulk</b> of the Red Army was deployed near Moscow under Semyon Timoshenko for the defense of the capital. Panzer commander Heinz Guderian was sent to Hitler by Bock and Halder to argue their case for continuing the assault against Moscow but Hitler issued an order through Guderian (bypassing Bock and Halder) to send Army Group Center's tanks to the north and south, temporarily halting the drive to Moscow. Convinced by Hitler's argument, Guderian returned to his commanding officers as a convert to the Führer's plan, which earned him their disdain.|$|E

5|$|Realizing {{the danger}} of his position, Mack decided {{to go on the}} offensive. On 8 October he {{commanded}} the army to concentrate around Günzburg and hoped to strike at Napoleon's lines of communication. Mack instructed Kienmayer to draw Napoleon further east towards Munich and Augsburg. Napoleon did not seriously consider the possibility that Mack would cross the Danube and move away from his central base, but he did realize that seizing the bridges at Günzburg would yield a large strategic advantage. To accomplish this objective, Napoleon sent Ney's Corps to Günzburg, completely unaware <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>bulk</b> of the Austrian army was heading to the same destination. On 8 October, however, the campaign witnessed its first serious battle at Wertingen between Auffenburg's troops and those of Murat and Lannes.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of the Lippe was a cavalry action {{fought on}} 2 September 1595 {{on the banks}} of the Lippe river, in Germany, between a corps of Spanish cavalry led by Juan de Córdoba and a corps of Dutch cavalry, {{supported}} by English troops, led by Philip of Nassau. The Dutch statholder Maurice of Nassau, taking advantage of the fact <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>bulk</b> of the Spanish army was busied in operations in France, besieged the town of Groenlo in Gelderland, but the elderly governor of the citadel of Antwerp, Cristóbal de Mondragón, organized a relief army and forced Maurice to lift the siege. Mondragón next moved to Wesel, positioning his troops on the southern bank of the Lippe river to cover Rheinberg from a Dutch attack. Maurice aimed then, relying on his superior army, to entice Mondragón into a pitched battle, planning to use an ambush to draw the Spanish army into a trap. However, the plan was discovered by the Spanish commander, who organized a counter-ambush.|$|E
5|$|The {{rotation}} and amplitude of Haumea's light curve were argued to place strong constraints on its composition. If Haumea were in hydrostatic equilibrium {{and had a}} low density like Pluto, with a thick mantle of ice over a small rocky core, its rapid rotation would have elongated it {{to a greater extent}} than the fluctuations in its brightness allow. Such considerations constrained its density to a range of 2.6–3.3 g/cm3. By comparison, the Moon, which is rocky, has a density of 3.3 g/cm3, whereas Pluto, which is typical of icy objects in the Kuiper belt, has a density of 1.86 g/cm3. Haumea's possible high density covered the values for silicate minerals such as olivine and pyroxene, which make up many of the rocky objects in the Solar System. This also suggested <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>bulk</b> of Haumea was rock covered with a relatively thin layer of ice. A thick ice mantle more typical of Kuiper belt objects may have been blasted off during the impact that formed the Haumean collisional family.|$|E

Based on the computed excess chemical potentials of the purely repulsive methane-sized WCA solute with respect to <b>that</b> in <b>the</b> <b>bulk,</b> <b>the</b> extrapolated values of cosine value of contact angle are calculated(ccHydrophobicity), {{which can be used}} to quantify the hydrophobicity of amino acid side chains with complete wetting behaviors.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{mobility}} of organic molecules under nanoscale confinement differs greatly from <b>that</b> in <b>the</b> <b>bulk.</b> In {{this study we}} show <b>that</b> <b>the</b> conventional free volume dependent mobility relationship explained by the free volume theory of diffusion breaks down for diffusion of linear alkane molecules in organosilicate films with connected nanoporosity. Alkane mobility under such nanoscale confinement was observed to decrease with chain length and was lower than <b>that</b> reported in <b>the</b> <b>bulk.</b> While <b>the</b> activation energy for diffusion was similar to <b>that</b> in <b>the</b> <b>bulk,</b> it was found to decrease with chain length exactly opposite to the trend observed in <b>the</b> <b>bulk.</b> This suggests an increasing molecular free volume with chain length. The effects of molecular polarity and pore size on diffusion were also demonstrated. Molecular mobility {{was found to be}} suppressed with increasing molecular polarity and decreasing pore size...|$|R
50|$|As {{catalysis}} is {{a surface}} process, one particular challenge in catalytic studies is resolving the typically weak spectroscopic signal of the catalytically active surface against <b>that</b> of <b>the</b> inactive <b>bulk</b> structure. Moving from the micro to the nano scale increases {{the surface to}} volume ratio of the particles, maximizing the signal of the surface relative to <b>that</b> of <b>the</b> <b>bulk.</b>|$|R
5|$|When Tillman {{entered the}} Senate in 1895, he {{was opposed to}} {{expansion}} of the United States Navy, fearing the expenditure would cause the issuance of bonds by the president, which he felt would only enrich the wealthy. Tillman sat on the Senate Committee on Naval Affairs, and soon {{came to understand that}} South Carolina could benefit from naval appropriations steered towards her. A flow of federal funds to his home state resulted, beginning in 1900, followed by the establishment, in 1909, of the Charleston Naval Shipyard. Once Democrats took control of the Senate {{for the first time in}} Tillman's tenure, in 1913, he became chairman of the committee and allied with others from the southeast (such as Navy Secretary Josephus Daniels, a North Carolinian) to see <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>bulk</b> of naval appropriations would be spent there. He also served as chairman of the Committee on Revolutionary Claims (57th through 59th Congresses) and on the Committee on Five Civilized Tribes of Indians (61st and 62nd Congresses). Strokes in 1908 and 1910 decreased his influence and ability in the Senate; his seniority entitled him to become Senate Appropriations Committee chairman in 1913, but his health did not permit it.|$|E
5|$|On April 13, 2013, during at the 2013's Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, Pusha T {{announced}} that he would be going to Paris later this week, just to put on some final touches on the album, afterwards he would announce a release date. In June 2013, Pusha T had been set to turn in the album to Def Jam for mastering, however, Kanye West presented Pusha with some additional beats. This resulted in Pusha going back to the studio to continue the recording. In early stages in the recording process, he began working on the album with Kanye West, Symbolyc One, The Neptunes, Bangladesh, and Ryan Leslie. Since then, he has confirmed that he was working with The-Dream, Just Blaze, No I.D., Nottz, Don Cannon, Nashiem Myrick, Carlos Brody (of The Hitmen), DJ Mano, Swizz Beatz, Rico Beats, Travi$ Scott, Hudson Mohawke, Young Chop, and Sham, amongst others on the album's production. On August 4, 2013 he {{announced that}} the song he wants to be the album's intro is produced by Joaquin Phoenix. On August 22, 2013, Pusha T appeared on MTV's RapFix and told Sway Calloway <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>bulk</b> of the album's production would be handled by Kanye West, while confirming production by Pharrell, Swizz Beatz, The-Dream, Nottz, and Don Cannon to be featured on the album.|$|E
