5|$|As head of state, Hitler became supreme {{commander}} of the armed forces. The traditional loyalty oath of servicemen was altered to affirm loyalty <b>to</b> <b>Hitler</b> personally, by name, {{rather than to the}} office of supreme commander or the state. On 19 August, the merger of the presidency with the chancellorship was approved by 88 percent of the electorate voting in a plebiscite.|$|E
5|$|As {{second in}} command of the SS and then Reichsführer-SS, Himmler was in regular contact with Hitler to arrange for SS men as bodyguards; Himmler was not {{involved}} with Nazi Party policy-making decisions in the years leading up to the seizure of power. From the late 1930s, the SS was independent of the control of other state agencies or government departments, and he reported only <b>to</b> <b>Hitler.</b>|$|E
5|$|For {{his part}} in the campaign, Kesselring was awarded the Knight's Cross with oak leaves, swords and {{diamonds}} by Hitler at the Wolfsschanze near Rastenburg, East Prussia on 19 July 1944. The next day, Hitler {{was the target of}} the 20 July plot. Informed of this event that evening by Göring, Kesselring, like many other senior commanders, sent a telegram <b>to</b> <b>Hitler</b> reaffirming his loyalty.|$|E
50|$|The {{plot was}} now fully prepared. On 7 July 1944 General Stieff was <b>to</b> kill <b>Hitler</b> at {{a display of}} new uniforms at Klessheim castle near Salzburg. However, Stieff felt unable <b>to</b> kill <b>Hitler.</b> Stauffenberg now decided to do both: <b>to</b> assassinate <b>Hitler,</b> {{wherever}} he was, and to manage the plot in Berlin.|$|R

5000|$|By {{being one}} of the first historians <b>to</b> present <b>Hitler</b> as an {{ordinary}} human being rather than as a [...] "madman", Taylor helped to open the door <b>to</b> seeing <b>Hitler</b> as a human being, albeit one who held morally repellent beliefs, offering possibilities to explain his actions.|$|R
5|$|Hitler {{intentionally}} played top {{party members}} off {{against one another}} and the NSDAP against the civil service. In this way, he fostered distrust, competition, and infighting among his subordinates to consolidate and maximise his own power. He typically did not give written orders; instead he communicated them verbally or had them conveyed through Bormann. Falling out of favour with Bormann meant that access <b>to</b> <b>Hitler</b> was cut off. Bormann {{proved to be a}} master of intricate political infighting. Along with his ability to control access <b>to</b> <b>Hitler,</b> this enabled him to curtail the power of Joseph Goebbels, Göring, Himmler, Alfred Rosenberg, Robert Ley, Hans Frank, Speer, and other high-ranking officials, many of whom became his enemies. This ruthless and continuous intriguing for power, influence, and Hitler's favour came to characterise {{the inner workings of the}} Third Reich.|$|E
5|$|Hitler {{promoted}} and practised the Führerprinzip. The principle required absolute obedience of all subordinates {{to their}} superiors; thus Hitler viewed the government structure as a pyramid, with himself—the infallible leader—at the apex. Accordingly, Himmler placed {{himself in a}} position of subservience <b>to</b> <b>Hitler,</b> and was unconditionally obedient to him. However, he—like other top Nazi officials—had aspirations to one day succeed Hitler as leader of the Reich. Himmler considered Speer to be an especially dangerous rival, both in the Reich administration and as a potential successor <b>to</b> <b>Hitler.</b> Speer refused to accept Himmler's offer of the high rank of SS-Oberst-Gruppenführer, as he felt to do so would put him in Himmler's debt and obligate him to allow Himmler a say in armaments production.|$|E
5|$|In September 2007, the {{historian}} Wolfram Pobanz {{declared that the}} copy of the giant globe with a bullet hole in the Berlin museum is not Hitler's, but another one that {{is thought to have}} belonged to Joachim von Ribbentrop, the Nazi foreign minister, and with no clue as to where the Globe that belonged <b>to</b> <b>Hitler</b> is today.|$|E

25|$|From the {{earliest}} days of the Nazi takeover in Germany, the Vatican was taking diplomatic action to attempt to defend the Jews of Germany. In the spring of 1933, Pope Pius XI urged Mussolini <b>to</b> ask <b>Hitler</b> <b>to</b> restrain the anti-Semitic actions taking place in Germany. Mussolini urged Pius <b>to</b> excommunicate <b>Hitler,</b> as he thought it would render him less powerful in Catholic Austria and reduce the danger to Italy and wider Europe. The Vatican refused to comply and thereafter Mussolini began <b>to</b> work with <b>Hitler,</b> adopting his anti-Semitic and race theories. In 1936, with the Church in Germany facing clear persecution, Italy and Germany agreed to the Berlin-Rome Axis.|$|R
5|$|Martin Bormann (17 June 1900– 2 May 1945) was a {{prominent}} official in Nazi Germany {{as head of the}} Nazi Party Chancellery. He gained immense power within the Third Reich by using his position as Adolf Hitler's private secretary to control the flow of information and access <b>to</b> <b>Hitler.</b>|$|E
5|$|By 1 March, the {{withdrawal}} was complete. His forces were mostly intact, but the fighting had been fierce: his Shield and Sword counter-attacks alone had cost him some 10,000–12,000 men. These counter-attacks usually failed to recover ground, {{but they kept}} the Red Army off-balance and won Model time to pull his units back. They also allowed him to say <b>to</b> <b>Hitler</b> that he was pursuing an aggressive approach, even as the front moved steadily to the west.|$|E
5|$|Copies of the {{developed}} film or summaries prepared by Moyzisch were promptly passed on to senior German leaders. Ribbentrop showed the initial set of photographs <b>to</b> <b>Hitler</b> immediately upon receipt. Hitler entered a conference with some Cicero materials in December 1943 and declared that the invasion in the west would come in spring 1944. He concluded, though, that there would also be attacks in other locations, such as Norway or the Balkans.|$|E
50|$|He is {{best known}} for portraying Adolf Hitler in the film {{adaption}} of Er ist wieder da. The film featured scenes of Masucci pretending <b>to</b> be <b>Hitler</b> unscripted as well as scripted scenes. Masucci said many people said they were happy <b>to</b> see <b>Hitler.</b> The film has been compared to Borat.|$|R

5000|$|The Plot <b>to</b> Assassinate <b>Hitler</b> (1955) - Generaloberst Ludwig Beck ...|$|R
5|$|Following the July 20 Plot, Model was {{the first}} senior {{commander}} to reaffirm his loyalty <b>to</b> <b>Hitler.</b> However, he also {{refused to give up}} General Hans Speidel, his chief of staff at Army Group B who was heavily implicated in the plot, to the Gestapo. Model was well aware of Speidel's political leanings, as were his predecessors at Army Group B, Erwin Rommel and Günther von Kluge. Like them, he shielded Speidel for as long as possible, while ignoring such treasonous talk as might take place.|$|E
5|$|Hitler's {{leadership}} style {{was to give}} contradictory orders to subordinates and to place them into positions where their duties and responsibilities overlapped with those of others. In this way, Hitler fostered distrust, competition, and infighting among his subordinates to consolidate and maximise his own power. His cabinet never met after 1938, and he discouraged his ministers from meeting independently. Hitler typically did not issue written orders, but gave them orally at meetings or in phone conversations; he also had Bormann convey orders. Bormann used his position to control {{the flow of information}} and access <b>to</b> <b>Hitler,</b> earning him enemies, including Himmler.|$|E
5|$|However, {{despite the}} general superiority of its armored vehicles, by 29 August 1944, {{as the last}} {{surviving}} German troops of Fifth Panzer Army and Seventh Army began retreating towards Germany, the twin cataclysms of the Falaise Pocket and the Seine crossing had cost the Wehrmacht dearly. Of the 2,300 tanks and assault guns it had committed to Normandy (including around 750 Panzer IVs), over 2,200 had been lost. Field Marshal Walter Model reported <b>to</b> <b>Hitler</b> that his panzer divisions had remaining, on average, five or six tanks each.|$|E

5|$|Involvement in the Spanish Civil War {{had drawn}} Mussolini closer <b>to</b> <b>Hitler,</b> helping to get Mussolini's {{agreement}} for Hitler's plans for union (Anschluss) with Austria. The authoritarian Catholic, anti-Nazi Vaterländische Front government of autonomous Austria had been successfully opposing {{the rise of}} Fascism, and following the assassination of Austria's authoritarian chancellor, Engelbert Dollfuss in 1934, had already successfully invoked Italian military assistance {{in case of a}} German invasion. Hitler's need to prevent an Italian invasion was settled with the Rome-Berlin Axis, partway into the Spanish Civil War.|$|E
5|$|Some {{historian}}s opine that Hitler {{would have}} assumed Stefanie was of Jewish origin. American historian Graeme Donald believes Hitler would have inferred {{that she was}} Jewish, but saw no problems with this at the time. This view is supported by German historian Anton Joachimsthaler, who stated in a BBC interview that Hitler must have assumed she was Jewish because of her Jewish surname. British singer-songwriter, author, journalist and paranormal researcher Paul Roland wrote in his book Nazi Women that it didn't make the slightest difference <b>to</b> <b>Hitler</b> whether she was Jewish or not.|$|E
5|$|The charred {{remains were}} {{found by the}} Soviets. By 11 May, Hitler's dentist, Hugo Blaschke, dental {{assistant}} Käthe Heusermann and dental technician Fritz Echtmann confirmed that the dental remains belonged <b>to</b> <b>Hitler</b> and Braun. The Soviets secretly buried the remains at the SMERSH compound in Magdeburg, East Germany, along with the bodies of Joseph and Magda Goebbels and their six children. On 4 April 1970, a Soviet KGB team with detailed burial charts secretly exhumed five wooden boxes of remains. The remains were thoroughly burned and crushed, after which the ashes were thrown into the Biederitz river, {{a tributary of the}} nearby Elbe.|$|E

5|$|A {{report by}} Rundstedt <b>to</b> <b>Hitler</b> in October 1943 {{regarding}} the weak defences in France {{led to the}} appointment of Rommel to oversee the construction of further fortifications along the expected invasion-front, which stretched from the Netherlands to Cherbourg. Rommel was given command of the newly re-formed Army Group B, which included the 7th Army, the 15th Army, and the forces guarding the Netherlands. Nazi Germany's tangled command structure {{made it difficult for}} Rommel to achieve his task. He was not allowed to give orders to the Organisation Todt, which was commanded by armaments minister Albert Speer, so in some places he had to assign soldiers to do construction work.|$|E
5|$|Antisemitic {{legislation}} passed in 1933 {{led to the}} removal all of Jewish teachers, professors and officials from the education system. Most teachers were required {{to belong to the}} Nationalsozialistischer Lehrerbund (National Socialist Teachers League; NSLB) and university professors were required to join the National Socialist German Lecturers. Teachers had to take an oath of loyalty and obedience <b>to</b> <b>Hitler</b> and those who failed to show sufficient conformity to party ideals were often reported by students or fellow teachers and dismissed. Lack of funding for salaries led to many teachers leaving the profession and the average class size increased from 37 in 1927 to 43 in 1938 due to the resulting teacher shortage.|$|E
5|$|As Nazi Germany was {{collapsing}} {{towards the}} end of the war, Braun swore loyalty <b>to</b> <b>Hitler</b> and went to Berlin to be by his side in the heavily reinforced Führerbunker beneath the Reich Chancellery. As Red Army troops fought their way into the neighbourhood on 29 April 1945, she married Hitler during a brief civil ceremony; she was 33 and he was 56. Less than 40 hours later, they committed suicide together in a sitting room of the bunker, she by biting into a capsule of cyanide, and he by a gunshot to the head. The German public was unaware of Braun's relationship with Hitler until after their deaths.|$|E
