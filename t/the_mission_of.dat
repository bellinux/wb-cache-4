5|$|A {{third period}} of mission {{foundations}} began in 1748 {{with the establishment}} of San Ignacio de Velasco, which was not declared a part of the World Heritage Site. The church is nonetheless a largely faithful 20th-century reconstruction – as opposed to renovation (a key criterion for inclusion in the World Heritage Site group) – of the second Jesuit templo built in 1761. In 1754 the Jesuits founded <b>the</b> <b>mission</b> <b>of</b> Santiago de Chiquitos. This church also is a reconstruction, dating from the early 20th century and likewise {{is not part of the}} World Heritage Site group. In 1755 <b>the</b> <b>mission</b> <b>of</b> Santa Ana de Velasco was founded by the Jesuit Julian Knogler; it is the most authentic of the six World Heritage Site missions dating from the colonial period. The last mission in the Chiquitania to be established was founded by the Jesuits Fr. Antonio Gaspar and Fr. José Chueca as Santo Corazón in 1760. However, nothing of the original settlement remains in the modern village.|$|E
5|$|After World War II, the 20 {{years of}} {{foundational}} {{work by the}} bomber mafia resulted in {{the separation of the}} United States Air Force from the Army to become an independent military arm.

The following month saw the last KC-135 depart and after 41 years, Loring AFB officially closed on 30 September 1994.|$|E

Here he was informed that he and other senior officers were being assigned to Camp Benning, Georgia to form the first faculty of the Infantry School that was being established there.

5|$|For the Americans, Laos {{became almost}} {{exclusively}} an air war, one which saw {{a reversal of}} the role it played in the conflict in neighboring South Vietnam. In Laos, the Air Force applied conventional air power in the support of an unconventional ground war. <b>The</b> <b>mission</b> <b>of</b> the U.S. Air Force was to seal off the southern Mekong River Valley, thus providing a buffer for Thailand; insulating the Vientiane government from direct communist threat; draining PAVN manpower and resources; and interdiction of the approaches to the Ho Chi Minh trail.|$|E

On December7, Japanese aircraft, which {{included}} Attack Hikōtai 704 G4Ms and 110th Sentai (Wing) Ki-67s, conducted a simultaneous attack from {{high and low}} altitudes which destroyed three B-29s and damaged another 23. Japanese losses were heavy, however, with six out of eight Ki-67s of the 110th Sentai lost during this attack, the first carried out by this unit. The largest attack on Saipan occurred {{on the night of}} December25/26 when 25 Japanese aircraft again attacked from high and low altitudes and destroyed one B-29, damaged three beyond repair and caused minor damage to a further eleven. Also on 26December, the Air Training Army was redesignated the 6thAir Army but retained <b>the</b> <b>mission</b> <b>of</b> conducting attacks on the Marianas.|$|E

5|$|Indians {{confirmed}} in 1746 that French traders periodically arrived by sea {{to trade with}} tribes in the lower Trinity River region. Eight years later, the Spanish learned of rumors that the French had opened a trading post {{at the mouth of}} the Trinity River. In September 1754, the governor, Jacinto de Barrios y Jáuregui sent soldiers to investigate, and they captured five Frenchmen who had been living at an Indian village. To dissuade the French from returning, Spain built the presidio of San Agustín de Ahumada and <b>the</b> <b>mission</b> <b>of</b> Nuestra Señora de la Luz de Orcoquisac near the mouth of the Trinity at Galveston Bay. Conditions were awful at the new location, and both the presidio and the mission were closed in 1770.|$|E
5|$|Initially {{established}} in 1691, <b>the</b> <b>mission</b> <b>of</b> San Xavier {{was the first}} of the missions listed in the World Heritage Site. In 1696, due to the incursion of Paulistas from Brazil in the east, the mission was relocated toward the San Miguel River. In 1698, it was relocated closer to Santa Cruz, but in 1708 was moved away to protect the Indians from the Spaniards. The original inhabitants of San Xavier were the Piñoca tribe. The church was built between 1749 and 1752 by the Swiss Jesuit and architect Fr. Martin Schmid. The school and church, as well as other characteristics of residential architecture, are still visible today in the village. San Xavier was restored by Hans Roth between 1987 and 1993.|$|E
5|$|Mitchell's design aims were {{to create}} a well-balanced, {{high-performance}} bomber interceptor and fighter aircraft capable of fully exploiting {{the power of the}} Merlin engine, while being relatively easy to fly. At the time, with France as an ally, and Germany thought to be the most likely future opponent, no enemy fighters were expected to appear over Great Britain, enemy bombers would be required to fly to the UK over the North Sea and no single-engined fighter at the time had the range to accompany the bombers and successfully return to its own friendly airfields; to carry out <b>the</b> <b>mission</b> <b>of</b> home defence, the design was intended to climb quickly to meet enemy bombers.|$|E
