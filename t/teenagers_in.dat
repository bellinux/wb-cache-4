5|$|Lucas {{planned to}} spend another five weeks in Europe, and hoped that Huyck and Katz would agree to finish the {{screenplay}} {{by the time he}} returned, but they were about to start on their own film, Messiah of Evil (1972), so Lucas hired Richard Walter, a colleague from the USC School of Cinematic Arts for the job. Walter was flattered, but initially tried to sell Lucas on a different screenplay called Barry and the Persuasions, a story of East Coast <b>teenagers</b> <b>in</b> the late 1950s. Lucas held firm—his was a story about West Coast <b>teenagers</b> <b>in</b> the early 1960s. Walter was paid the $10,000, and he began to expand the Lucas/Huyck/Katz treatment into a screenplay.|$|E

5|$|After the Second World War, {{there was}} a large {{increase}} in the number of gangs in Sophiatown. Part of the reason for this was that there were about 20000 African <b>teenagers</b> <b>in</b> the city who were not at school and did not have jobs. Township youths were unable to find jobs easily. Employers were reluctant to employ teenagers as they did not have any work experience, and many of them were not able to read or write. They also considered them to be undisciplined and weak.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{airing of}} the pilot, The N joined with {{marketing}} agency Mr. Youth LLC {{to promote the}} show amongst <b>teenagers</b> <b>in</b> Manhattan.

He adds that tourism has increased since the broadcast of pictures taken inside the Cathedral.|$|E
5|$|EastEnders: E20 {{originally}} aired {{as part of}} {{the main}} show's 25th anniversary celebrations. It was devised in a bid to develop and nurture new talent, including writers, actors, composers and remixers, and target a younger audience, as well as to attempt to drive more people onto the Internet. The series was the idea of executive producers Diederick Santer, who wanted a show where regular EastEnders characters would be in the background, and John Yorke, who wanted to improve the portrayal of <b>teenagers</b> <b>in</b> EastEnders and to get younger people writing for it.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, KFC International {{launched}} the Krusher (Krushem in some markets) line of frozen beverages. The product {{was an attempt}} to introduce a between-meals snack to KFC, and was marketed towards <b>teenagers.</b> <b>In</b> April 2010, the Double Down sandwich was launched. Criticised as an unhealthy product, it featured two pieces of fried chicken in lieu of a conventional bread bun. It {{has proved to be a}} success for the company, with 15 million Double Downs sold worldwide between March 2011 and March 2013. In September 2012, the Chicken Little sandwich returned in the US.|$|E

5|$|In 2015, acne was {{estimated}} to affect 633 million people globally, making it the 8th most common disease worldwide. Acne commonly occurs in adolescence and affects an estimated 80–90% of <b>teenagers</b> <b>in</b> the Western world. Lower rates are reported in some rural societies. Children and adults may also be affected before and after puberty. Although acne becomes less common in adulthood, it persists in nearly half of affected people into their twenties and thirties and a smaller group continue to have difficulties into their forties.|$|E
5|$|Labor {{was always}} in short supply. The most common {{solution}} was indentured servitude of young whites. These were <b>teenagers</b> <b>in</b> Britain or Germany whose parents arranged for them to work for families in the colonies until age 21, {{in exchange for their}} ocean passage. The great majority became farmers or farm wives. By the mid-eighteenth century, African American slaves comprised 12% of the population of New York. Most were house servants in Manhattan, or farmworkers on Dutch estates.|$|E

5|$|The Jena Six {{were six}} black <b>teenagers</b> <b>in</b> Jena, Louisiana, {{convicted in the}} 2006 beating of Justin Barker, a white student at the local Jena High School, which they also attended. Barker was injured on December 4, 2006, {{by the members of}} the Jena Six, and {{received}} treatment at an emergency room. While the case was pending, it was often cited by some media commentators as an example of racial injustice in the United States. Some commentators believed that the defendants had been charged initially with too-serious offenses and had been treated unfairly.|$|E
5|$|Durant was {{selected}} as the second overall pick in the 2007 NBA draft by the Seattle SuperSonics. In his first regular season game, the 19-year-old Durant registered 18 points, 5 rebounds, and 3 steals against the Denver Nuggets. On November 16, he made the first game-winning shot of his career in a game against the Atlanta Hawks. At the conclusion of the season, he was named the NBA Rookie of the Year behind averages of 20.3 points, 4.4 rebounds, and 2.4 assists per game. He joined Carmelo Anthony and LeBron James as the only <b>teenagers</b> <b>in</b> league history to average at least 20 points per game over an entire season.|$|E
5|$|Lynch {{conceived}} South of Nowhere {{from the}} idea of a teenager's coming out after hearing that his friend's son had come out to his parents. Lynch pitched the premise to The N and was commissioned to write the pilot. After the casting process was complete, the episode was filmed in October 2004, but when the show was picked up for a full season, Lynch decided to recast many of the characters and the pilot was shot again in July 2005 with the new cast. The premiere of the episode was promoted with branded MetroCards that were handed out to <b>teenagers</b> <b>in</b> Manhattan. Generally, critics reviewed the pilot positively, particularly commending its treatment of current social issues; however, some critics found the show's introduction of these issues to be forced and inauthentic.|$|E
