500|$|McCartney {{said about}} the line [...] "I'd love to <b>turn</b> <b>you</b> on", which concludes both verse sections: [...] "This was the time of Tim Leary's 'Turn on, tune in, drop out' and we wrote, 'I'd love to <b>turn</b> <b>you</b> on.' John and I gave each other a knowing look: 'Uh-huh, it's a drug song. You know that, don't you?'" [...] George Martin commented that he had always {{suspected}} that the line [...] "found my way upstairs and had a smoke" [...] was a drug reference, recalling how the Beatles would [...] "disappear and have a little puff", presumably of marijuana, but {{not in front of}} him. [...] "When [...] was doing his TV programme on Pepper", McCartney recalled later, [...] "he asked me, 'Do you know what caused Pepper?' I said, 'In one word, George, drugs. Pot.' And George said, 'No, no. But you weren't on it all the time.' 'Yes, we were.' Sgt. Pepper was a drug album." ...|$|E

6000|$|First, Thou must abhor his <b>turning</b> <b>thee</b> {{out of the}} way; yea, and thine own consenting thereto: {{because this}} is to reject the counsel of God {{for the sake of}} the counsel of a Worldly-wiseman. The Lord says, [...] "Strive to enter in at the strait gate" [...] (Luke 13:24), the gate to which I send thee; for [...] "strait is the gate which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it" [...] (Matt. 7:14). From this little wicket-gate, and from the way thereto, hath this wicked man <b>turned</b> <b>thee,</b> to the {{bringing}} of thee almost to destruction; hate, therefore, his <b>turning</b> <b>thee</b> out of the way, and abhor thyself for hearkening to him.|$|R
500|$|A reputed drug {{reference}} {{in the line}} [...] "I'd love to <b>turn</b> <b>you</b> on" [...] resulted in the song initially being banned from broadcast by the BBC. Since its release on Sgt. Pepper, [...] "A Day in the Life" [...] has been issued as a B-side and also on various compilation albums. Jeff Beck, Barry Gibb and Phish are among the artists who have covered the song. Since 2008, McCartney has included the song in his live performances. It was ranked the 28th greatest song of all time by Rolling Stone. In another list, the magazine ranked it as the greatest Beatles song.|$|E
500|$|The song became {{controversial}} for its supposed {{references to}} drugs. The BBC {{announced that it}} would not broadcast [...] "A Day in the Life" [...] due to the line [...] "I'd love to <b>turn</b> <b>you</b> on", which, according to the corporation, advocated drug use. Other lyrics allegedly referring to drugs include [...] "found my way upstairs and had a smoke / somebody spoke and I went into a dream". A spokesman for the BBC stated: [...] "We have listened to this song over and over again. And we have decided that it appears to go just a little too far, and could encourage a permissive attitude to drug-taking." [...] The ban was eventually lifted on 13 March 1972.|$|E
500|$|As a {{link between}} {{the end of the second}} verse, where Lennon sings [...] "I'd love to <b>turn</b> <b>you</b> on", and the start of McCartney's middle-eight, the band {{included}} a 24-bar bridge. At first, the Beatles were not sure how to fill this link section. At the conclusion of the session on 19 January, the transition consisted of a simple repeated piano chord and the voice of assistant Mal Evans counting out the bars. Evans' voice was treated with gradually increasing amounts of echo. The 24-bar bridge ended with the sound of an alarm clock triggered by Evans. Although the original intent was to edit out the ringing alarm clock when the section was filled in, it complemented McCartney's piece – which begins with the line [...] "Woke up, fell out of bed" [...] – so the decision was made to keep the sound.|$|E

500|$|O'Ree's {{breakthrough}} came {{several years}} after another black player, Herb Carnegie was denied the same opportunity. [...] In 1938–39, playing junior hockey with the Ontario Hockey Association's Toronto Rangers, during a practice Carnegie was pulled aside by his coach and told [...] "See that man sitting in the blues? [...] That's Conn Smythe, owner of the Toronto Maple Leafs. [...] He says he'd take you tomorrow if he could <b>turn</b> <b>you</b> white." [...] Stung by the comments, Carnegie resolved to excel at the game. He was offered a tryout with the Rangers in 1950, then a spot on their lowest minor league team. [...] "They {{told me that if}} I signed with the Rangers and went to New Haven, I would make international headlines. [...] I told them my family couldn't eat headlines. [...] That was probably when the Rangers decided to forget about me." ...|$|E
500|$|His {{hallmark}} was his raw {{voice and}} ability to convey strong emotion. Richie Unterberger of Allmusic noted his [...] "hoarse, gritty vocals, brassy arrangements, an emotional way with both party tunes and aching ballads." [...] In the book Rock and Roll: An Introduction, authors Michael Campbell and James Brody suggested that [...] "Redding's singing calls to mind a fervent black preacher. Especially in up-tempo numbers, his singing is more than impassioned speech but less than singing with precise pitch." [...] According to the book, [...] "Redding finds a rough midpoint between impassioned oratory and conventional singing. His delivery overflows with emotion" [...] in his song [...] "I Can't <b>Turn</b> <b>You</b> Loose". Booker T. Jones described Redding's singing as energetic and emotional, but said that his vocal range was limited, reaching neither low nor high notes. Peter Buckley, in The Rough Guide to Rock, describes his [...] "gruff voice, which combined Sam Cooke's phrasing with a brawnier delivery" [...] and later suggested he [...] "could testify like a hell-bent preacher, croon like a tender lover or get down and dirty with a bluesy yawp".|$|E
500|$|Alex Timbers {{developed}} {{the concept and}} directed the play, while Kyle Jarrow wrote the accompanying book, music, and lyrics. [...] Timbers and Jarrow were classmates together at Yale University. [...] The script for the play is published by Samuel French, Inc. [...] Jarrow was motivated to write the script {{by what he saw}} as a shift in religious teachings – from an old model involving hell and retribution, to a new system of thought promising money or peace. [...] Jarrow commented on Timbers' idea of using children to tell a story about Scientology: [...] "I did a lot of work on cults in college, and what I learned is that they sort of <b>turn</b> <b>you</b> into a child by appealing to that part of you that wants {{to be taken care of}} and given answers. [...] And so it all began to make sense to me." [...] He said Scientology would be [...] "an especially interesting topic for a theater piece" [...] because of its criticism of psychiatry, relative newness compared to Buddhism, Islam, Judaism, and Christianity, and practice of requiring [...] "that the follower take courses which cost significant amounts of money." ...|$|E

500|$|The song, {{spanning}} {{three minutes}} and 21 seconds, {{begins with a}} one-measure opening guitar riff that alludes to the E major-pentatonic scale. Corgan uses this riff (along with variations on it) to emphasize certain parts and to indicate shifts in the song. After the riff is played four times, {{the rest of the}} band enters backed with feedback-driven guitars. Ned Raggett of Allmusic commented on the song's ability to [...] "alternate between calmer, almost Cure-like sections and the louder crunches, [...] soon-to-be-trademark guitar style taking My Bloody Valentine's own hypnotic riffing to more accessible results." [...] The chorus, consisting of multiple guitar tracks playing barre chords, {{is an example of the}} band's tendency to overdub several rhythm guitar tracks. While the song does not include a standard guitar solo, a short melodic guitar part appears during the bridge. Corgan explained: [...] "The little guitar break over the C chord is actually a forwards sample that we laid in backwards. Then there's a weird vocal effect that moves across the speakers, a 'yan-yan-yan-yan' thing, which was generated by using a Roland Space Echo to regenerate on the last word of the vocal line, 'I wanna <b>turn</b> <b>you</b> on.'" ...|$|E
500|$|One of {{the most}} notable story lines for Martha was her secret life as a pole dancer and {{subsequent}} road into alcoholism. This {{was a result of}} her abortion and failed relationships with Jack and Ash Nader (Ben Geurens) along with her new relationship with Cameron [...] "Cam" [...] Reynolds (Ashley Lyons), who was leading her astray. The story line began playing out from the 2006 [...] "cliffhanger" [...] episode, when Ash reveals that he is married with children and leading a double life. Gordon branded Martha as ignorant to the situation she has got herself into: [...] "I think she is so naive, she wants to believe that she's found a great guy and she keeps giving him second chances. She wants to make it work." [...] Martha fails to cope with the situation, as Gordon describes: [...] "It's this whole emotional roller-coaster that, if you don't deal with your life, can be terrible." [...] Their relationship falls apart after Martha aborts Ash's child, causing Martha to begin her transition into a party girl. Gordon commented that [...] "I think everyone in this show begins as a scruffy bum and gradually they <b>turn</b> <b>you</b> into a glamour puss." ...|$|E
500|$|Concerns {{that some}} of the lyrics in Sgt. Pepper refer to {{recreational}} drug use led to the BBC banning several songs from British radio, such as [...] "A Day in the Life" [...] because of the phrase [...] "I'd love to <b>turn</b> <b>you</b> on", with the BBC claiming that it could [...] "encourage a permissive attitude towards drug-taking." [...] Although Lennon and McCartney denied any drug-related interpretation of the song at the time, McCartney later suggested that the line was deliberately written to ambiguously refer to either illicit drugs or sexual activity. The meaning of [...] "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds" [...] became the subject of speculation, as many believed that the song's title was code for the hallucinogenic drug LSD. The BBC banned the track on those grounds. They also banned [...] "Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!" [...] because of the lyric, which mentions [...] "Henry the Horse", a phrase that contains two common slang terms for heroin. Fans speculated that Henry the Horse was a drug dealer and [...] "Fixing a Hole" [...] was a reference to heroin use. Others noted lyrics such as [...] "I get high" [...] from [...] "With a Little Help from My Friends", [...] "take some tea" [...] – slang for cannabis use – from [...] "Lovely Rita" [...] and [...] "digging the weeds" [...] from [...] "When I'm Sixty-Four".|$|E

A fart joke in 3-D may not be three times as wacky, but the high spirits of Despicable Me 2 are irresistible fun." [...] A.A. Dowd of The A.V. Club gave the film a 'C' grade, saying [...] "What's missing—and this was the crucial component of part one—is a little sour to undercut the sweet. Like its protagonist, a bad guy gone boringly good, Despicable Me 2 has no edge. It's fatally nice and insufficiently naughty." [...] Laremy Legel of Film.com gave the film a 6.3 out of 10, saying [...] "Despicable Me 2 is fun, especially near the culmination. Structural issues aside, it's impossible not to like these characters, all of them, rendered with love, always entertaining even when the story around them doesn't make much sense." ...|$|E
