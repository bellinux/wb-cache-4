2500|$|The Holocaust hit the Hasidim, easily {{identifiable}} and almost unable to disguise themselves among the larger populace due to cultural insularity, particularly hard. Hundreds of leaders perished with their flock, while {{the flight of}} many notable ones as their followers were being exterminated – especially Aharon Rokeach of Belz and Joel Teitelbaum of Satmar – elicited bitter recrimination. In the immediate post-war years, the entire movement seemed <b>to</b> <b>teeter</b> on the precipice of oblivion. In Israel, the United States, and Western Europe, the survivors' children were at best becoming Modern Orthodox. While a century earlier the Haskalah depicted it as a medieval, malicious power, now it was so weakened that the popular cultural image was sentimental and romantic, what Joseph Dan termed [...] "Frumkinian Hasidism" [...] for it began with the short stories of Michael Levi Rodkinson (Frumkin). Martin Buber was the major contributor to this trend, portraying the sect {{as a model of}} a healthy folk consciousness. [...] "Frumkinian" [...] style was very influential, later inspiring the so-called [...] "Neo-Hasidism", and also utterly ahistorical.|$|E

5000|$|By {{the time}} that the rail line from Weed to Klamath Falls (passing near Teeter's Landing) was completed, the {{transfer}} station at Teeter's Landing had popularly become known as [...] "Ady". The railroad used the dike closing the east end of the buttes as a portion of the roadbed and since the east end of Wild Horse Butte was closest <b>to</b> <b>Teeters</b> Landing, the [...] "whistle stop" [...] for Ady was established there. The present day Ady canal takes its name from the same source.|$|R
50|$|Then in 1906, the Weed Lumber Company laid {{twenty miles}} of rails from Weed to Grass Lake {{northwest}} of Mt. Shasta (this section {{has since been}} abandoned). Grass Lake then replaced Bartle as the favored transfer point where northbound travelers and freight changed from rail to overland stage. The new route ran forty miles north <b>to</b> <b>Teeter’s</b> Landing on the Klamath River south of Midland where the riverboat Klamath was met for the remaining ten miles north along the Klamath River and into Lake Ewauna and Klamath Falls. By cutting sixty miles from the trip, this route replaced the McCloud Railroad/Bartle Fast Freight Road.|$|R

25|$|In 1939 Willis L. Teeter—who {{also worked}} for A, at its Mooresville, North Carolina store—and his brother Paul, who was also working for A {{borrowed}} $1,700 <b>to</b> open <b>Teeter's</b> Food Mart on Main Street in Mooresville, North Carolina. A was closing their doors and agreed to lease the location <b>to</b> the <b>Teeter</b> brothers. The first Teeter Food Mart opened on July 15, 1939. Teeter's was a family-run operation as Teeter was the manager, Paul (Bill), his brother was the produce manager and Teeter's wife, Sylvia, also worked at the store. Paul's wife, Mildred, also joined the staff as bookkeeper as the Teeter stores expanded. The Teeter brothers believed in exceptional customer service, even having home delivery service. Because of their foresight of providing great customer service and only the best products, they saw sales rise quickly. Teeter based all he would do on the Golden Rule—treat others as you would have them treat you.|$|R

50|$|Following the election, with Labour {{appearing}} <b>to</b> <b>teeter</b> on {{the edge}} of the electoral abyss in Scotland, the Independent Labour Party increasingly moved apart from Labour, ultimately dissociating from the party in March 1932. The ILP had dominated the Labour movement in Scotland since 1918, dominating community based activism, and essentially forming the Labour party in Scotland. This had ultimately served to undermine the organizational growth of the Labour party in Scotland.|$|E
5000|$|Due to her aesthetics, both {{in fashion}} and musically, Rickman has been {{regarded}} as being hard to classify. She does not feel that “singer songwriter” is a label that fits her. A term she prefers is “post-prince charming” or “the Disney princess who’s been through some shit.” For example, her song Pretty Little Head has been called “disconcerting,” “borderline childlike,” “subliminal peculiarity,” and “the feel of a nursery rhyme that’s just starting <b>to</b> <b>teeter</b> off the rails.” ...|$|E

The drivers are forced to deal with a series of physical and mental obstacles, including a stretch of extremely rough road called [...] "the washboard", a construction barricade that forces them <b>to</b> <b>teeter</b> around a rotten platform above a precipice, and a boulder blocking the road. Jo finds that his nerves are not what they used to be, and the others confront Jo about his increasing cowardice. Finally, Luigi and Bimba's truck explodes without warning, killing them both.|$|E
50|$|The company {{announced}} a trading halt on 4 August 2010, {{in the wake}} of a loss of A$20 per ounce of gold produced in the June quarter, despite cutting costs and boosting production at the Wiluna mine.

50|$|In {{the final}} tournament, Russia was drawn into group B with Cameroon, Sweden, and Brazil.

In their first two games Russia lost 2-0 to Brazil and 3-1 <b>to</b> Sweden. <b>Teetering</b> on elimination, Russia defeated Cameroon 6-1 with Oleg Salenko scoring record five goals in a single match. Russia was eliminated from the tournament with three points from one win and two losses. Sadyrin was later sacked following what was a poor performance.|$|R

5000|$|During {{the service}} in the Christ the Saviour Cathedral, which was {{broadcast}} live by Russia's state TV channels, after Kathisma XVII had been chanted and Metropolitan Kirill set about doing the incensing round the coffin, he appeared <b>to</b> <b>teeter</b> and, being propped up by two bishops, was ushered into the sanctuary and was absent for about an hour. Reuters reported: [...] "Kirill was helped away by aides at one point and a Kremlin official said he had apparently fainted. The metropolitan later rejoined the funeral."

50|$|Meanwhile, as {{time goes}} on, her {{supposed}} connection to J.B. has disastrous consequences for the stock market. Stockbroker E.F. Hulgar (Andrew Tombes) asks her for inside information about steel from Mr. Ball. The only Ball the confused Mary knows is John Jr., so she consults him. He jokingly tells her it is going down and she passes it along to Hulgar. As a result, everybody begins selling, just as J.B. starts buying, causing J.B.'s company <b>to</b> <b>teeter</b> {{on the brink of}} bankruptcy. When Mary, John, and J.B. finally get together and figure out what is going on, John comes up with a bright solution - getting Mary to tell Hulgar that J.B. has cornered the market. Prices shoot up, rescuing the beleaguered financier.|$|E
5000|$|Like its doppelganger in Supper at Emmaus, {{the basket}} seems <b>to</b> <b>teeter</b> {{on the edge}} of the picture-space, in danger of falling out of the {{painting}} and into the viewer's space instead. In the Supper this is a dramatic device, part of the way in which Caravaggio creates the tension of the scene; here, trompe l'oeil seems to be almost the whole purpose of the painting, if we subtract the possible didactic element. But the single element that no doubt attracted its original owner, and still catches attention today, is the extraordinary quasi-photographic realism of the observation which underlies the illusionism. Basket of Fruit can be compared with the same artist's Still Life with Fruit (c. 1603), a painting which John Spike identifies as [...] "the source of all subsequent Roman still-life paintings." ...|$|E
5000|$|Charlottetown {{was first}} renovated in the 1980s, {{when it was}} {{converted}} into an outlet center (though several traditional stores were retained) and renamed [...] "Outlet Square". Ivey's converted its store to an outlet store before closing altogether. Eventually, the former Ivey's {{was taken over by}} Burlington Coat Factory. The mall was renovated a second time in 1989 and renamed [...] "Midtown Square," [...] and two parking garages were added. Unfortunately, neither of the renovations resuscitated the rapidly dying mall. The Colonial Stores was converted to a Big Star Markets, and later <b>to</b> Harris <b>Teeter</b> before closing in 1988.|$|R

50|$|Kroger also swapped all ten of its Greensboro, North Carolina-area {{stores in}} 1999 to Matthews, North Carolina-based Harris Teeter, for 11 of that company's stores {{in central and}} western Virginia. Kroger still {{maintains}} a North Carolina presence in the Raleigh-Durham area. In the Raleigh-Durham area, Kroger closed its North Raleigh store in the Wakefield Commons shopping center on July 9, 2011, because the location failed to meet sales expectations. After the closure, Kroger will operate 16 stores in the Triangle. Kroger had a store in Greenville from the 1980s until 2010 when it sold it <b>to</b> Harris <b>Teeter.</b> A store in Wilson opened in 2002 but closed two years later.|$|R
5000|$|Michael O'Neill and Gareth Reeves devote five {{pages of}} their book Auden, MacNeice, Spender: The Thirties Poetry (1992) to a {{discussion}} of [...] "Epilogue: For W. H. Auden". O'Neill and Reeves write that this poem [...] "does all the things expected of a thirties poem so comprehensively as <b>to</b> <b>teeter</b> on the verge of self-caricature - which is itself characteristic of the poetry of the period. But by the end it has transcended itself with great authority. At its core is private suffering, buried and yet painfully exposed. It uses all the tonal stops and tricks of diction at MacNeice's command." [...] O'Neill and Reeves conclude that this poem [...] "addresses an issue of paramount importance to MacNeice and his contemporaries: how to write poetry in an age that demands so much, while remaining true to the self and to poetry, to the poetic self." ...|$|E
50|$|Sherman {{devised a}} game show he {{intended}} to call I Know a Secret. Television producer Mark Goodson used Sherman's idea {{and turned it into}} I've Got a Secret, which ran on CBS from 1952 to 1967. Rather than paying him for the concept, Mark Goodson-Bill Todman Productions made Sherman the show's producer. Sherman was reported to be warm and kindhearted to all who worked for him. However, differences occurred between Sherman and anyone who {{was in a position to}} try to restrain his creativity. As producer of I've Got a Secret, which was broadcast live, he showed a fondness for large-scale stunts that had the potential <b>to</b> <b>teeter</b> on the brink of disaster. He once released 100 rabbits onstage as an Easter surprise for the Madison Square Boys Club, whose members were seated in the studio. The boys were invited to come up onstage to collect their prize. Although the resultant melee made a good story, it did not necessarily make for good TV.|$|E
