5|$|A sand sheet is a near-level, firm {{expanse of}} {{partially}} consolidated particles in a layer that varies {{from a few}} centimeters to a few meters thick. The structure of the sheet consists of thin horizontal layers of coarse silt and very fine to medium grain sand, separated by layers of coarse sand and pea-gravel which are a single grain thick. These larger particles anchor the other particles in place and may also be packed together on the surface so as to form a miniature desert pavement. Small ripples form on the sand sheet when the wind exceeds 24 km/h (15 mph). They form perpendicular to the wind direction and gradually move across the surface as the wind continues to blow. The distance between their crests corresponds to {{the average length of}} jumps made by particles during saltation. <b>The</b> <b>ripples</b> are ephemeral and a change in wind direction causes them to reorganise.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work is to investigate <b>the</b> <b>ripple</b> factor of half-wave rectifier circuits. <b>The</b> <b>ripple</b> factor {{is one of the}} important characteristics necessary when designing a power electronic converter. <b>The</b> <b>ripple</b> factor measures how much deviation the converter output parameter has, such as the output current, from its nominal designed value. In this paper <b>the</b> <b>ripple</b> factor of <b>the</b> output current of half-wave rectifiers is investigated. More specifically, <b>the</b> <b>ripple</b> factor of output current from more practical half-wave rectifiers that include inductive load with or without a freewheeling diode are analyzed and then compared to that of the basic half-wave rectifier consisting only of a resistive load. Derivation of the equations for <b>the</b> <b>ripple</b> factor for <b>the</b> three half-wave rectifier circuits is first presented.

25|$|From {{a signal}} {{processing}} point of view, the Gibbs phenomenon is the step response of a low-pass filter, and the oscillations are called ringing or ringing artifacts. Truncating the Fourier transform of a signal {{on the real}} line, or the Fourier series of a periodic signal (equivalently, a signal on the circle) corresponds to filtering out the higher frequencies by an ideal (brick-wall) low-pass/high-cut filter. This can be represented as convolution of the original signal with the impulse response of the filter (also known as the kernel), which is the sinc function. Thus the Gibbs phenomenon {{can be seen as}} the result of convolving a Heaviside step function (if periodicity is not required) or a square wave (if periodic) with a sinc function: the oscillations in the sinc function cause <b>the</b> <b>ripples</b> in the output.|$|E
40|$|The topography, morphology, {{structure}} and residual stress {{state at the}} surface of a rail with severe longitudinal ripples was characterized using a combination of spectrometry, microscopy, scattering and diffraction methods. The investigations reveal that white etching layers develop at <b>the</b> <b>ripple</b> hills, while <b>the</b> <b>ripple</b> valleys contain a severely plastic deformed layer. While the structure in <b>the</b> <b>ripple</b> valleys remains pearlite, the structure of the white etching layers on top of <b>the</b> <b>ripple</b> hills is nanocrystalline martensite containing cementite particles of a few nanometer size. The microhardness of the white etching layers on top of <b>the</b> <b>ripple</b> hills is about three times higher than the microhardness in <b>the</b> <b>ripple</b> valleys. <b>The</b> microhardness throughout the white etching layer is not homogeneous due to the non-uniform amount of carbon in solute solution and also due to differences in the amount {{and the size of the}} fine carbide particles. The whole running surface is under biaxial compressive residual stresses. In <b>the</b> <b>ripple</b> valleys <b>the</b> direction of the principal residual stresses nearly coincides with the longitudinal and the transverse direction on the rail. On <b>the</b> <b>ripple</b> hills <b>the</b> compressive residual stresses due to the martensite formation are significantly higher and the stress state is nearly homogeneous.

500|$|The crew {{moved to}} Warner Bros. Studios' Stage 16 {{to shoot the}} T. rex attack on the LSX powered SUVs. Shooting proved {{frustrating}} because of water soaking the foam rubber skin of the animatronic dinosaur, which caused the animatronic T. rex to shake and quiver from the extra weight when the foam absorbed the water. This forced Stan Winston's crew to dry the model with shammys between takes. On the set, Malcolm distracting the dinosaur with a flare was included at Jeff Goldblum's suggestion, as he felt a heroic action was better than going by the script, where like Gennaro, Malcolm would get scared and run away. <b>The</b> <b>ripples</b> in the glass of water caused by the T. rexs footsteps were inspired by Spielberg listening to Earth, Wind and Fire in his car, and the vibrations the bass rhythm caused. Lantieri was unsure of how to create the shot until the night before filming, when he put {{a glass of water}} on a guitar he was playing, which achieved the concentric circles in the water Spielberg wanted. The next morning, guitar strings were put inside the car and a man on the floor plucked the strings to achieve the effect. Back at Universal, the crew filmed scenes with the Dilophosaurus on Stage 27. Finally, the shoot finished on Stage 12, with the climactic chases with the raptors in the Park's computer rooms and Visitor's Center. Spielberg changed the climax to bring back the T. rex, abandoning the original ending in which Grant uses a platform machine to maneuver a raptor into a fossil tyrannosaur's jaws. The scene which already had the juxtaposition of live dinosaurs in a museum filled with fossils, while also destroying the bones, now also had an ending where the T. rex saved the protagonists, and afterwards did what Spielberg described as a [...] "King Kong roar" [...] while an ironic banner reading [...] "When Dinosaurs Ruled the Earth" [...] flew. The film wrapped twelve days ahead of schedule on November 30, and within days, editor Michael Kahn had a rough cut ready, allowing Spielberg to go ahead with filming Schindler's List.|$|E
