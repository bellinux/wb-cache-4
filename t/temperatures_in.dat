5|$|Adelaide has a Mediterranean climate with St Kilda being {{slightly}} hotter and drier {{than the}} Adelaide average. Summer daytime temperatures {{can be expected}} to exceed 40°C on 4days of the year. Conversely, nighttime <b>temperatures</b> <b>in</b> winter are expected to drop below 0°C on 1 day, although generally the season is mild with moderate rainfall.|$|E
5|$|All such {{episodes of}} severe drought {{correlate}} with El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events. El Niño-related droughts {{have also been}} implicated in periodic declines in Indian agricultural output. Nevertheless, ENSO events that have coincided with abnormally high sea surfaces <b>temperatures</b> <b>in</b> the Indian Ocean—in one instance during 1997 and 1998 by up to —have resulted in increased oceanic evaporation, resulting in unusually wet weather across India. Such anomalies have occurred during a sustained warm spell {{that began in the}} 1990s. A contrasting phenomenon is that, instead of the usual high pressure air mass over the southern Indian Ocean, an ENSO-related oceanic low pressure convergence centre forms; it then continually pulls dry air from Central Asia, desiccating India during what should have been the humid summer monsoon season. This reversed air flow causes India's droughts. The extent that an ENSO event raises sea surface <b>temperatures</b> <b>in</b> the central Pacific Ocean influences the extent of drought.|$|E
5|$|Before {{technology}} in wineries could stabilize temperatures, the low <b>temperatures</b> <b>in</b> winter {{of the northern}} German regions would halt fermentation and leave the resulting wines with natural sugars and a low alcohol content. According to local tradition, in the Mosel region the wine would then be bottled in tall, tapered, and green hock bottles. Similar bottles, although brown, are used for Riesling produced in the Rhine region.|$|E

40|$|In room–corridor {{building}} geometry, {{the corridor}} smoke temperature {{is of great}} importance to fire protection engineering as indoor fires occur. Theoretical analysis {{and a set of}} reduced-scale model experiments were performed, and a virtual fire model was proposed, to investigate the correlations between the maximum smoke <b>temperature</b> <b>in</b> corridors and the smoke <b>temperature</b> <b>in</b> rooms. The results show that the dimensionless virtual fire heat release rate (HRR) is characterized by quadratic-polynomial of the dimensionless smoke <b>temperature</b> <b>in</b> fire rooms. The dimensionless distance from a virtual fire source to the corridor ceiling varies linearly with the dimensionless smoke <b>temperature</b> <b>in</b> a room. Results of multiple regression indicate that, at the impingement area of virtual fire, the dimensionless maximum smoke <b>temperature</b> <b>in</b> corridors is only related to the dimensionless virtual fire HRR; in the non-impingement area of a virtual fire, the dimensionless maximum smoke <b>temperature</b> <b>in</b> corridors {{is a function of the}} dimensionless virtual fire HRR and dimensionless longitude distance. The viscosity and conduction exhibit an insignificant impact on the maximum <b>temperature</b> <b>in</b> the corridor. Through replacing the parameters of virtual fire with the dimensionless smoke <b>temperature</b> <b>in</b> fire rooms, the correlations between dimensionless maximum <b>temperature</b> <b>in</b> corridors and the dimensionless smoke <b>temperature</b> <b>in</b> fire rooms were proposed...|$|R

30|$|Figure  6 b {{shows the}} effect of {{injection}} <b>temperature</b> <b>in</b> annuli and AT on the profiles of <b>temperature</b> <b>in</b> annuli and AT.

Secondly, the increase <b>in</b> <b>temperature</b> near wellhead <b>in</b> annuli and AT gradually becomes smaller with the increase <b>in</b> injection <b>temperature</b> <b>in</b> annuli and AT, respectively.
