A mediator was called in, and a new contract reached on June 11, 1926.

Kelly was anxious to learn what had happened in Iraq, while Gilligan, who had discussed a very early draft of the dossier with Kelly, wished to ask him about it in light of the failure to find any weapons of mass destruction. They agreed <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>on</b> an unattributable basis, which allowed the BBC to report what was said but not to identify the source. Kelly told Gilligan of his concerns over the 45-minute claim and allegedly ascribed its inclusion in the dossier to Alastair Campbell, the director of communications for Tony Blair.|$|E
25|$|Under severe {{pressure}} from successive governments, from approximately 1977 RTÉ extended Section 31 to censor all Sinn Féin members, {{not merely the}} Sinn Féin spokespersons specified in the Section 31 Order. This extension of the Order {{came to a head}} In the early 1990s. Sinn Féin member Larry O'Toole was not permitted <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>on</b> RTÉ about a strike in Gateaux, a cake factory in Finglas north Dublin, where O'Toole worked. He was informed in writing by RTÉ that his Sinn Féin membership was the reason for the censorship. O'Toole challenged what he contended was RTÉ self-censorship in the High Court. After the court found in O'Toole's favour in August 1992, RTÉ appealed the ruling that liberalised its Section 31 regime. Consequently, RTÉ were accused of appealing to be censored. RTÉ then lost in the Supreme Court in March 1993.|$|E
25|$|In the 1990s, Chomsky embraced {{political}} activism {{to a greater}} degree than before. Retaining his commitment to the cause of East Timorese independence, in 1995 he visited Australia <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>on</b> the issue {{at the behest of the}} East Timorese Relief Association and the National Council for East Timorese Resistance. The lectures that he gave on the subject would be published as Powers and Prospects in 1996. As a result of the international publicity generated by Chomsky, his biographer Wolfgang Sperlich opined that he did more to aid the cause of East Timorese independence than anyone but the investigative journalist John Pilger. After East Timor's independence from Indonesia was achieved in 1999, the Australian-led International Force for East Timor arrived as a peacekeeping force; Chomsky was critical of this, believing that it was designed to secure Australian access to East Timor's oil and gas reserves under the Timor Gap Treaty.|$|E

2500|$|Darwin paid a {{visit to}} his brother Erasmus's lady friend the {{literary}} Whig Miss Harriet Martineau who had strong views on egalitarianism and whose writings had popularised the ideas of Thomas Malthus. Around this time, she was writing her Society in America which included discussion of the geological [...] "process of world making" [...] that she had seen on her visit to the Niagara Falls. He sat there for almost an hour. [...] "She was very agreeable and managed <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>on</b> a most wonderful number of subjects, considering the limited time. I was astonished to find how little ugly she is, but as it appears to me, she is overwhelmed with her own projects, her own thoughts and own abilities. Erasmus palliated all this, by maintaining one ought not to look at her as a woman."

Pierre de Bénouville said, [...] "Mitterrand created a true spy {{network in the}} POW camps which gave us information, often decisive, {{about what was going}} on behind the German borders." [...] On 10 July Mitterrand and Piatzook (a militant communist) interrupted a public meeting in the Salle Wagram in Paris. The meeting was about allowing French POWs to go home if they were replaced by young French men forced to go and work in Germany (in French this was called [...] "la relève"). When André Masson began to talk about [...] "la trahison des gaullistes" [...] (the Gaullist treason), Mitterrand stood up in the audience and shouted him down, saying Masson had no right <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>on</b> behalf of POWs and calling la relève a [...] "con" [...] (i.e., something stupid).

2500|$|The {{most famous}} {{confrontation}} {{took place at}} a meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science in Oxford on Saturday 30 June 1860. While there was no formal debate organised on the issue, Professor John William Draper of New York University was <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>on</b> Darwin and social progress at a routine [...] "Botany and Zoology" [...] meeting. The new museum hall was crowded with clergy, undergraduates, Oxford dons and gentlewomen anticipating that Samuel Wilberforce, the Bishop of Oxford, would speak to repeat the savage trouncing he had given in 1847 to the Vestiges published anonymously by Robert Chambers. Owen lodged with Wilberforce the night before, but Wilberforce would have been well prepared as he had just reviewed the Origin for the Tory Quarterly for a fee of £60. Huxley was not going to wait for the meeting, but met Chambers who accused him of [...] "deserting them" [...] and changed his mind. Darwin was taking treatment at Dr. Lane's new hydropathic establishment at Sudbrooke Park, Petersham, near Richmond in Surrey.|$|E

Instead he forced him into a match against the {{returning}} Kurt Angle to determine a number one contender. When that match was interrupted by the returning Rob Van Dam another match was signed, Angle versus Van Dam versus Sabu, for the number one contendership (Angle then became too injured to compete and was pulled from the match). Sabu beat Rob Van Dam in their ladder match to win a shot at Big Show at SummerSlam, a match which he ended up losing. After SummerSlam, he became a main eventer at ECW, {{with the majority of}} the matches being Extreme Rules. He also started to form tag teams with the likes of Rob Van Dam and The Sandman to face Test, The Big Show, Paul Heyman and his ally Matt Striker.|$|E

2500|$|Both leaders, Massoud and Haq, were {{recognized}} for being fiercely independent from foreign, especially Pakistani, influence. Both, {{two of the}} most successful anti-Soviet resistance leaders, were rejecting the Pakistani claim of hegemony over the Afghan mujahideen. Abdul Haq was quoted as saying during the anti-Soviet period: [...] "How is that we Afghans, who never lost a war, must take military instructions from the Pakistanis, who never won one?" [...] Massoud during the Soviet period said to the Pakistani Foreign Minister who had asked him {{to send a message to}} the Russians through the Pakistanis who were conducting talks [...] "on behalf of our Afghan brethren": [...] "Why should I send a message? Why are you talking on our behalf? Don't we have leaders here <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>on</b> our behalf?" [...] Khan replied [...] "This is how it has been and how it will be. Do you have a message?" [...] Massoud told the foreign minister that [...] "nobody who talks on our behalf will have any kind of result." [...] Consequently, neither Massoud nor Abdul Haq were consulted before and neither participated in the Battle of Jalalabad (1989) in which the ISI tried but failed to install Gulbuddin Hekmatyar as the post-communist leader of Afghanistan.|$|E

I much doubt whether it will be equality in practice.The Darwins shared Martineau's Unitarian background and Whig politics, but their father Robert was concerned that, as a potential daughter-in-law, the writer was too extreme in her politics. [...] Charles noted that his father was upset by a piece read in the Westminster Review calling for the radicals to break with the Whigs and give working men the vote [...] "before he knew it was not hers , and wasted a good deal of indignation, and even now can hardly believe it is not hers". In early December 1836 Charles Darwin called on Martineau and may have discussed the social and natural worlds she was writing about in her book Society in America, including the [...] "grandeur and beauty" [...] of the [...] "process of world making" [...] she had seen at Niagara Falls.
