500|$|Meanwhile, at Entumbane, the ZIPRA fighters overran the ZANLA camp, killing {{many and}} forcing {{the rest to}} flee. Sporadic {{fighting}} between ZANLA and ZIPRA guerrillas spread into Bulawayo itself, continuing {{through the night and}} into the morning. About 700 ZIPRA combatants continued to attack C Company's position at the Alamo, putting it under constant machine gun and mortar fire. Pocketed, Dyck responded in kind. About 02:00 on 12 February, a ZIPRA guerrilla with an RPD machine gun took up a position in a house to the Alamo's south-east and [...] "became a nuisance", as the major put it; he and Sergeant Vini Hlatshwayo went out with an RPG-7 rocket launcher and fired at <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house,</b> bringing it down on the gunner and killing him.|$|E
500|$|The {{west and}} east sides match each other. Most houses have two storeys, but some rise to three; {{all have a}} {{basement}} and a three-window range with sash windows. [...] The entrances are in the rear elevation and are paired under single doorcases with cornices, architraves and fanlights. [...] The windows are topped by similar architraves. At the front, facing the garden, the hipped roofs of the main sections have prominent eaves, and the roofs of the tower sections have similar treatment. Number 1, at the southwest corner, has ground-floor rustication carried round on to its south-facing wall, and its windows are different. Similarly, number 48—the end house at the southeast corner—has a hipped-roofed south-facing wing with a hipped roof, in which the entrance {{is set in a}} doorcase flanked by antae. [...] <b>The</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> is chamfered and has a blank two-window range. Several houses in {{the east side of the}} crescent have dormer windows in their attic space.|$|E
500|$|On Wednesday, March 3, 1993, in Rancho Viejo, Texas, an {{affluent}} community {{just north of}} Brownsville, Fischer woke up early {{to get ready for}} school. Just before 7:00a.m., he went to the garage and reversed his mother's car into the circular driveway at his home at 3 Cortez Avenue. He then walked toward <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> and grabbed a garden hose to spray water on the car's windows, which were covered in dust. As he sprayed the car, someone came from behind and shot him twice at point-blank range with what would later be identified as a [...]38 Super pistol. One of the shots penetrated his chest and the others his brain. Fischer's mother looked out the window to see what had happened, thinking the noise came from one of the house's palm tree branches falling on the roof, or that the car had backfired. She did not see the car, and thought that perhaps her son had gone to a convenience store to pick up something, but Fischer's brother Eric told her he could see the car parked on the driveway.|$|E

50|$|The cheek bulges, and {{the wide}} and deep {{depression}} below them, suggest a muscular arrangement associated with <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mouth, whereby {{it is possible for}} such an animal to pull <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mouth forwards as is characteristic of mammals, while in true reptiles <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mouth are fixed and very close to <b>the</b> articulation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lower jaw. This is a significant arrangement, because even with a secondary palate an animal {{would not be able to}} suck unless <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mouth can be brought forward, allowing the mouth as a whole to close properly around <b>the</b> teat <b>of</b> a milk gland.|$|R
2500|$|Louisa was [...] {{long and}} weighed 10 tons on its {{carriage}}. Six men were sent ahead to widen {{some parts of}} the road that were too narrow while about 100 people, helped by 18 horses from Lynton, hauled the boat up the 1 in 4 (25%) Countisbury Hill. The carriage had to be repaired at one point when a wheel came off. At {{the top of the hill}} they took refreshments at the Blue Ball Inn then most of the people including the women and children turned back, leaving just 20 men to control the boat as it descended another 1 in 4 hill down into Porlock. More horses were obtained to bring the team up to about 20 (although four died during the journey). At Porlock the road was too narrow because of a wall but the owner let the men take down <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> so that they could pass. Lower down a road had been washed away by the sea so a detour was necessary. The lifeboat finally reached the sea at 06:30 on 13 January.|$|E

50|$|It is a {{pyramidal}} roof on {{towers of}} square plan.
