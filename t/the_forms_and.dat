He rented a car, dropped Murray off at the university, and {{departed}} for Connecticut. At 11:30 that night, Fred Murray called his daughter Maura to remind her to obtain accident forms from the Registry of Motor Vehicles. They agreed to talk again Monday night to discuss <b>the</b> <b>forms</b> <b>and</b> fill out the insurance claim via phone.|$|E

Nina forges her mother's signature on <b>the</b> <b>forms</b> <b>and</b> gets a regular singing gig at Lou Carpenter's pub. Nina leaves for a tour of Asia, but when she gets back she hears another singer singing one of her songs on the radio. Nina is told that she signed the rights to her music away, but Lou {{points out that the}} contract is not valid as Nina forged a signature on it. Nina sleeps with Jack for the first time, but when Taj tells her that Jack cheated on her with Edwina Valdez, their relationship ends. Nina starts getting closer to Connor and, to make Jack jealous, kisses Connor at the Lassiter's Ball.|$|E
5|$|Van Eyck's {{earlier work}} often shows churches and cathedrals in older Romanesque style, {{sometimes}} {{to represent the}} Temple in Jerusalem as an appropriate historical setting, with decoration drawn exclusively from the Old Testament. That is clearly not the case here – the Christ Child occupies the same space as a large rood cross depicting him being crucified. The church in this panel is contemporary Gothic – a choice perhaps intended to associate Mary with the Ecclesia Triumphans – while her pose and oversized scale are indebted to <b>the</b> <b>forms</b> <b>and</b> conventions of Byzantine art and the International Gothic. Van Eyck details the architecture with a precision not seen before in northern European painting.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>form</b> <b>and</b> {{structure}} of <b>the</b> doctorate in design involves challenges and questions. This includes shaping a common vocabulary, not {{to agree on}} every issue, but to understand one another. The issues include <b>the</b> <b>form</b> <b>and</b> {{structure of}} <b>the</b> doctorate itself, <b>the</b> <b>form</b> <b>and</b> structure of doctoral programs, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> <b>and</b> structure of research. This paper identifies eight kinds of doctorates. It examines supervision, advising and administrative support for doctoral students and doctoral programs. It considers the varieties of research we undertake and calls for the higher level study of research methodology. Systematic inquiry will produce a rich overview of questions and issues. This will shape a context for robust solutions. My co-chairman David Durling asked me to prepare a short paper for the conference on <b>the</b> issues of <b>form</b> <b>and</b> structure. This paper attempts a reasonable [...] but not comprehensive [...] examination of the central questions we must address in developing robust <b>forms</b> <b>and</b> structures for doctoral education in design...|$|R

But the natural law of many aspects of life is knowable apart from special revelation by {{examining}} <b>the</b> <b>forms</b> <b>and</b> purposes of those aspects. It is in this sense that Aquinas considered homosexuality unnatural, since it involves a kind of partner other than the kind to which the purpose of sexuality points. He considered it comparable to heterosexual sex for pleasure (rather than reproduction).|$|E
25|$|Most modern arch bridges {{are made}} from {{reinforced}} concrete. This type of bridge is suitable where a temporary centring may be erected to support the forms, reinforcing steel, and uncured concrete. When the concrete is sufficiently set <b>the</b> <b>forms</b> <b>and</b> falseworks are then removed. It is also possible to construct a reinforced concrete arch from precast concrete, where the arch is built in two halves which are then leaned against each other.|$|E

25|$|Brunelleschi, {{and others}} like him, {{developed}} {{a passion for the}} highly refined style of Roman architecture, in which <b>the</b> <b>forms</b> <b>and</b> decorations followed rules of placement and proportion that had long been neglected. They sought to rediscover and apply these rules. It was a time of architectural theorising and experimentation. Brunelleschi built two large churches in Florence demonstrating how the new style could be applied, San Lorenzo's and Santo Spirito. They are essays in the Classical, with rows of cylindrical columns, Corinthian capitals, entablatures, semi-circular arches and apsidal chapels.|$|E

25|$|The obvious {{distinguishing}} features of Classical Roman architecture were adopted by Renaissance architects. However, <b>the</b> <b>forms</b> <b>and</b> purposes of buildings had changed over time, as had {{the structure of}} cities. Among the earliest buildings of the reborn Classicism were churches of a type that the Romans had never constructed. Neither were there models {{for the type of}} large city dwellings required by wealthy merchants of the 15th century. Conversely, there was no call for enormous sporting fixtures and public bath houses such as the Romans had built. The ancient orders were analysed and reconstructed to serve new purposes.|$|E

25|$|Rammed earth {{walls are}} formed {{in place by}} {{pounding}} damp sub-soil (containing sand, clay and sometimes gravel) into movable, reusable forms with manual or machine-powered tampers. In traditional rammed earth, a mixture of around 70% aggregate (gravel,sand) and 30% clay is optimal. Pigmentation may be added in the mix to achieve the desired color. Around 5-10inches of mixed damp sub-soil are placed inside <b>the</b> <b>forms</b> <b>and</b> pounded to total compaction and the process is repeated until the desired height is achieved. What is left after the forms are removed is a wall that is structural and can last over 1000 years.|$|E
25|$|Jung {{was fond}} of {{comparing}} {{the form of the}} archetype to the axial system of a crystal, which preforms the crystalline structure of the mother liquid, although it has no material existence of its own. This first appears according to the specific way in which the ions and molecules aggregate. The archetype in itself is empty and purely formal: a possibility of representation which is given a priori. The representations themselves are not inherited, only <b>the</b> <b>forms,</b> <b>and</b> in that respect they correspond to the instincts. The existence of the instincts can no more be proved than the existence of the archetypes, so long as they do not manifest themselves concretely.|$|E
25|$|Isaac {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{prolific}} composers of the time, producing an extraordinarily diverse output, including almost all <b>the</b> <b>forms</b> <b>and</b> styles current at the time; only Lassus, at the end of the 16th century, had a wider overall range. Music composed by Isaac included masses, motets, songs in French, German, and Italian, as well as instrumental music. His best known work may be the lied Innsbruck, ich muss dich lassen, of which he made at least two versions. It is possible, however, that the melody itself is not by Isaac, and only the setting is original. The same melody was later used as the theme for the Lutheran chorale O Welt, ich muss dich lassen, which was the basis of works by Johann Sebastian Bach, including his St Matthew Passion and Johannes Brahms.|$|E

25|$|Signal Troops is an {{integral}} part of the Armed Forces. Its condition and functioning largely influences efficiency of command, the timeliness of combat equipment and weapons. In its development, the Signal Troops has come a long and difficult process that is inextricably linked with the history of the Armed Forces, the changes in <b>the</b> <b>forms</b> <b>and</b> methods of their use and the improvement of military art. From simple audio and visual means of communication for the transmission of signals and commands on the battlefield to widely branched multi-channel, advanced automated systems that can provide a link of virtually unlimited range of both stationary and moving objects on the ground, in the water, under the water and in the air, this is the historical path of development and improvement of military communications. Communication on the battlefield is one of the main types of operational support.|$|E
25|$|A {{new wave}} {{came from the}} West when Japan was {{introduced}} to European and American poetry. This poetry belonged to a very different tradition and was regarded by Japanese poets as a form without any boundaries. Shintai-shi (New form poetry) or Jiyu-shi (Freestyle poetry) emerged at this time. They still relied on a traditional pattern of 5-7 syllable patterns, but were strongly influenced by <b>the</b> <b>forms</b> <b>and</b> motifs of Western poetry. Later, in the Taishō period (1912 to 1926), some poets began to write their poetry in a much looser metric. In contrast with this development, kanshi slowly went out of fashion and was seldom written. As a result, Japanese men of letters lost the traditional background of Chinese literary knowledge. Originally the word shi meant poetry, especially Chinese poetry, but today it means mainly modern-style poetry in Japanese. Shi {{is also known as}} kindai-shi (modern poetry). Since World War II, poets and critics have used the name gendai-shi (contemporary poetry). This includes the poets Kusano Shinpei, Tanikawa Shuntarō and Ishigaki Rin.|$|E
25|$|This {{thesis of}} {{negative}} capability {{is a key}} component in Unger's theory of false necessity and formative context. The theory of false necessity claims that our social worlds are the artifact of our own human endeavors. There is no pre-set institutional arrangement that our societies adhere to, {{and there is no}} necessary historical mold of development that they will follow. Rather we are free to choose and develop <b>the</b> <b>forms</b> <b>and</b> the paths that our societies will take through a process of conflicts and resolutions. However, there are groups of institutional arrangements that work together to bring out certain institutional forms, liberal democracy, for example. These forms are the basis of a social structure, and which Unger calls formative contexts. In order to explain how we move from one formative context to another without the conventional social theory constraints of historical necessity (e.g. feudalism to capitalism), and to do so while remaining true to the key insight of individual human empowerment and anti-necessitarian social thought, Unger recognized that there are an infinite number of ways of resisting social and institutional constraints, which can lead to an infinite number of outcomes. This variety of forms of resistance and empowerment (i.e. negative capability) make change possible.|$|E

Under Rayleigh-Gans condition, in particular, speckle dimension mirrors the average dimension of the scattering objects, while, in general, the statistical properties of near field speckles generated by a sample depend on the light scattering distribution.|$|R
