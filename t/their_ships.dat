5|$|Calafia meets Radiaro, a Moslem warrior who convinces {{her that}} she should join him in retaking Constantinople from the Christian armies holding it. Calafia, in turn, convinces her people to take <b>their</b> <b>ships,</b> weapons, armor, riding beasts, and 500 griffins, and sail with her to Constantinople to fight the Christians, though she has no concept {{of what it means}} to be Moslem or Christian. Her {{subjects}} arm themselves with weapons and armor made of gold, as there is no other metal in California. They fill <b>their</b> <b>ships</b> with supplies and hasten to sea.|$|E
5|$|Afterwards, a round barrow {{was built}} over the ashes, and in {{the centre of the}} mound they erected a staff of birch wood, where they carved the names of the dead {{chieftain}} and his king. Then they departed in <b>their</b> <b>ships.</b>|$|E
5|$|Flotilla is a {{three-dimensional}} simultaneous turn-based strategy space combat video game {{set in a}} randomly generated galaxy. The player and computer-controlled opponents issue orders to <b>their</b> <b>ships,</b> which are carried in a simultaneous and real-time fashion {{over a period of}} 30 seconds. The game then freezes, and the player and opponents issue new orders to <b>their</b> <b>ships,</b> which are again performed for 30 seconds. This process repeats until one party is defeated. Orders are separated into three groups: attack move, flank move and focus fire. An attack move orders the ships to move and fire simultaneously; a flank move increases the ship's speed but deactivates weapons until the ship stops moving; and focus fire increases fire rate but significantly reduces the ship's speed.|$|E
5000|$|Things {{get worse}} when the ship's [...] "hyperdriver" [...] {{starts to go}} into meltdown, {{threatening}} to create a black-hole. <b>Their</b> <b>ship's</b> Enforcer Drone won't let them leave, making things even more complicated. The humans manage to destroy the Enforcer Drone with dynamite and help the grateful [...] "invaders" [...] return to space. As an unintentional gift the Martians jettison <b>their</b> <b>ship's</b> sewage tank while flying over Wrenchmuller's field to lighten the load on <b>their</b> <b>ship</b> {{so that they can}} reach gravitational escape velocity.|$|R
50|$|When {{the player}} loses a life, a ghost version of <b>their</b> <b>ship</b> will be {{floating}} {{around at the}} spot where it was destroyed. When the player respawns and picks up the ghost, they will recover all the power-ups <b>their</b> <b>ship</b> had in its previous life.|$|R
5|$|Arriving in 1986, {{the crew}} finds <b>their</b> <b>ship's</b> power drained. Hiding <b>their</b> <b>ship</b> in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park using its {{cloaking}} device, the crew split up to accomplish several tasks: Admiral James T. Kirk and Spock attempt to locate humpback whales, while Montgomery Scott, Leonard McCoy, and Hikaru Sulu construct a tank {{to hold the}} whales they need {{for a return to}} the 23rd century. Uhura and Pavel Chekov are tasked to find a nuclear reactor, whose energy leakage will enable <b>their</b> <b>ship's</b> power to be restored.|$|R
5|$|From Naupactus, Sulpicius sailed east to Corinth and Sicyon, {{conducting}} raids there. Philip, {{with his}} cavalry caught the Romans ashore {{and was able}} to drive them back to <b>their</b> <b>ships,</b> with the Romans returning to Naupactus.|$|E
5|$|Much of the {{displacement}} of a dreadnought was {{taken up by the}} steel plating of the armour. Designers spent much time and effort to provide the best possible protection for <b>their</b> <b>ships</b> against the various weapons they would be faced with. Only so much weight could be devoted to protection, without compromising speed, firepower or seakeeping.|$|E
5|$|The first European dogs seen {{were those}} that {{accompanied}} Spanish explorers Álvaro de Mendaña de Neira and Pedro Fernandes de Queirós in 1595. While {{they were on}} Hiva Oa, the Marquesans attempted to steal {{one of the small}} dogs on <b>their</b> <b>ships.</b> Anthropologist Katharine Luomala noted that nothing suggested that these dogs were left by the Spanish.|$|E

5|$|Around 1,400 {{men of the}} Belgian {{fishing fleet}} had left for Britain after the Belgian surrender. Three Belgian {{trawlers}} even {{took part in the}} evacuation of the British Expeditionary Forces from Dunkirk, rescuing 4,300 British soldiers between them. <b>Their</b> <b>ships</b> and crews were put at the disposal of the Royal Navy, for coastal patrols and launching barrage balloons. From October 1940, many joined the RNSB.|$|E
5|$|Carnival Cruise Lines and Royal Caribbean Cruises, the world's {{two largest}} cuise operators, {{diverted}} <b>their</b> <b>ships</b> {{away from the}} damaged cruise port of Puerto Costa Maya. Their plans originally expected diversions until at least 2009, but the central government was quick to fund rebuilding of the destroyed concrete piers. By June 2008 they were rebuilt to accommodate even larger ships than before, and ships scheduled stops there for September 2008.|$|E
5|$|Despite Dean's {{significant}} damage, it did {{not have}} severe effects on infrastructure, and the non-agricultural sectors of most affected nations recovered quickly. Most cruise lines diverted <b>their</b> <b>ships</b> away from the Western Caribbean in anticipation of Hurricane Dean's passage, though by August 27 all were back on schedule, except those with damaged ports in Belize and the Yucatán. The Lesser Antilles and the Greater Antilles were especially quick to resume servicing cruise lines, as their ports opened within days.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the end of}} the war in November 1918, Von der Tann, {{along with}} most of the High Seas Fleet, was interned at Scapa Flow pending a {{decision}} by the Allies as to the fate of the fleet. The ship met her end in 1919 when German caretaker crews scuttled <b>their</b> <b>ships</b> to prevent their division among Allied navies. The wreck was raised in 1930, and scrapped at Rosyth from 1931 to 1934.|$|E
5|$|Having assumed this {{formation}} {{upon the}} giving of a prearranged signal, the Allied ships moved suddenly outwards from this position {{at a second}} signal, rowing into the Persian ships and catching them off guard. Their superior seamanship negated, the Persians came off worst from the encounter with 30 of <b>their</b> <b>ships</b> captured or sunk. During the battle a Greek ship, captained by Antidorus of Lemnos, defected to the Allies. Nightfall then ended the battle, with the Allies having fared better than they possibly expected to.|$|E
5|$|Having {{escaped to}} the east, Villaret made what sail his {{battered}} fleet could muster {{to return to}} France, and dispatched his frigates {{in search of the}} convoy. Villaret was also hoping for reinforcements; eight ships of the line, commanded by Admiral Pierre-François Cornic, were patrolling near the Ushant headland. Behind him to the west, the British took the whole night to secure <b>their</b> <b>ships</b> and prizes, not setting out to return to Britain until 05:00 on 2 June.|$|E

5|$|In May 1861, Britain and France {{declared}} the South to be belligerents by international law, and <b>their</b> <b>ships</b> {{were entitled to}} {{the same rights as}} U.S.-flagged vessels to remain 24 hours in neutral ports. Nevertheless, Seward was pleased that both nations would not meet with Confederate commissioners or recognize the South as a nation. Britain did not challenge the Union blockade of Confederate ports, and Seward wrote that if Britain continued to avoid interfering in the war, he would not be overly sensitive to what wording they used to describe their policies.|$|E
5|$|In the American Civil War, {{camouflage}} paint was applied {{by both sides}} during the Union blockade of 1861–1865. Blockade runners aiding the Confederates sometimes painted <b>their</b> <b>ships</b> all in mist-gray, to hide themselves in coastal fog. One Union blockade crew may have painted their rowboat white, and its oars, and wore white clothing for a night reconnaissance patrol up an enemy-held river.|$|E
5|$|International {{regulations}} for the maritime industry are promulgated by {{agencies of the}} United Nations, particularly the International Maritime Organization and International Labour Organization. Flag states adopt these {{regulations for}} <b>their</b> <b>ships</b> by ratifying individual treaties. One common criticism against flag of convenience countries is that they allow shipowners to avoid these regulations by not ratifying important treaties or by failing to enforce them.|$|E

50|$|While {{the criminals}} {{work on the}} ship, a TerraPol police cruiser arrives, having {{detected}} a still-active transponder on <b>their</b> <b>ship,</b> and contacts Max to inform them of their presence. Max denies that the fugitives are on board, even though he checks the crew's identity to confirm they are indeed escaped convicts. When the police demand permission to land, Max destroys <b>their</b> <b>ship</b> with a laser.|$|R
5|$|It {{is clear}} that the demoralised and tired Greeks were no match for the Persians, and were {{completely}} routed in the battle which ensued at Ephesus. Many were killed, including the Eretrian general, Eualcides. The Ionians who escaped the battle made for their own cities, while the remaining Athenians and Eretrians managed to return to <b>their</b> <b>ships</b> and sailed back to Greece.|$|E
5|$|Low, Harris and <b>their</b> <b>ships</b> {{left the}} Azores for the Carolinas. On 10 June 1723, they {{suffered}} a resounding defeat {{in a battle}} with , a heavily armed man of war. Greyhound had been dispatched {{under the command of}} Peter Solgard to hunt down Low and his fleet. Low fled in the Fancy with a skeleton crew and £150,000 in gold on board and headed back to the Azores, leaving Harris and the Ranger behind.|$|E
5|$|Most New Zealand place-names {{are derived}} from Māori and British sources. Both groups used names to commemorate notable people, events, places from their homeland, and <b>their</b> <b>ships,</b> or to {{describe}} the surrounding area. The Māori {{did not have a}} collective name for New Zealand before European arrival, but post-colonisation the name Aotearoa (commonly translated as 'long white cloud') was used to refer to the whole country. Dutch cartographers named the islands Nova Zeelandia and British explorer James Cook subsequently anglicised the name to New Zealand.|$|E
50|$|When {{designing}} enemies, {{the player}} can manipulate projectile patterns, sound effects, movement patterns, hit boxes, {{and more in}} the Ship Editor portion of the Blast Works Editor. The player also has the option of fully customizing the ship that they play as. For example, the ship builder lets the player view <b>their</b> <b>ship</b> from many different angles, allowing them to add new pieces, such as wings or weapons, simply by adding shapes to <b>their</b> <b>ship.</b> The basic shapes can be combined to create even more complex constructs, {{and there are a}} few moving shapes the player can add to give <b>their</b> <b>ship</b> a bit more life. The player is also given full control over the size, shape, and color of any object they create. This ranges from <b>their</b> main <b>ship</b> to buildings created for custom levels and even enemy craft.|$|R
