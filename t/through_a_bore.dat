40|$|Surgeons are {{switching}} to the four-bundled hamstring graft, composed of double-looped semitendinosus and gracilis tendons (DLSTG), {{to replace the}} torn anterior cruciate ligament. Mechanically, the DLSTG is superior; it is twice as strong and stiffer than a patella tendon graft, and the four bundles share load and mimic {{the function of the}} anteromedial and posterolateral bands of the native anterior cruciate ligament. Morbidity from tendon removal is minimal and by 3 months soreness disappears and isometric knee flexion strength returns to normal. It is safe for the patient to undergo aggressive rehabilitation without a brace and to return to sports activities at 4 months when the knee is reconstructed with a DLSTG graft. This report describes the rationale and technique for implanting the DLSTG in a femoral tunnel using rigid fixation instead of a compliant suture bridge. Fixation is achieved by looping the tendons over a post (Bone Mulch Screw) inside the femoral tunnel. The strength, stiffness, and biologic bond of the graft is enhanced by compaction of bone into the femoral tunnel <b>through</b> <b>a</b> <b>bore</b> in the Bone Mulch Screw.

50|$|He {{erected a}} plant at the {{location}} of the sulfur deposits, and, by sending down superheated water <b>through</b> <b>a</b> <b>boring</b> of 1,000 feet, he melted the sulfur. The melted sulfur then ascended to the surface <b>through</b> <b>an</b> inner tube in the boring, and was pumped into bins several feet high, in which it solidified, and the blocks were later broken up and loaded directly onto rail cars. The result of the invention was a reduction of the importation of sulphur into the United States to less than one-tenth of its former proportions, and a corresponding increase in home production. The first sulfur was extracted in 1894. High water and energy consumption, as well as the presence of toxic hydrogen sulfide, were problems which had to be solved.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} the analytical {{model of the}} radial bearing of the finite length with the two-layer porous insert obtained {{on the basis of}} the dimensionless equations of movement of a viscous incompressible lubricant in an operating clearance and in porous layers of a bearing sleeve and continuity equations as well. We are analyzing the case when permeability of porous layers on the border of section of a two-layer insert accepts one value. The lubricant moves in a circumferential direction <b>through</b> <b>a</b> <b>bore</b> in a bearing body and the subsequent filtration occurs through insert pores. Permeability anisotropy of porous layers is taken into consideration in radial and circumferential directions. As a result of the given task, we have obtained the field of speeds and pressure in porous layers and in the lubricant layer. Analytical dependences for components of a vector of supporting force and the friction moment have been found, and we have also defined the loading factor and friction factor. Moreover, in our calculations we have revealed and used the parameter characterizing specificity of lubrication feeding in a circumferential direction. It is proved that the rational mode of operation is reached by a design of a two-layer porous insert given when the resistance factor increases more intensively and from the parameter ψ, and from a relative eccentricity ɛ in comparison with the bearing having a single-layer insert. Hence, anisotropy of permeability of porous layers in a circumferential and radial direction has a defined possibility of practical application of this new model...|$|E
