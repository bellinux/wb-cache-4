500|$|The next day, July 13, Howe {{attempted}} to open {{negotiations with the}} Americans. He {{sent a letter to}} Washington delivered by Lieutenant Philip Brown, who arrived under a flag of truce. The letter was addressed [...] "George Washington, Esq." [...] Brown was met by Joseph Reed, who had hurried to the waterfront on Washington's orders, accompanied by Henry Knox and Samuel Webb. Washington asked his officers whether it should be received or not, as it did not recognize his rank as general, and they unanimously said no. Reed told Brown that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> the army with that address. On July 16, Howe tried again, this time with the address [...] "George Washington, Esq., etc., etc.", but it was again declined. The next day, Howe sent Captain Nisbet Balfour to ask if Washington would meet with Howe's adjutant face to face, and a meeting was scheduled for July 20. Howe's adjutant was Colonel James Patterson. Patterson told Washington that Howe had come with powers to grant pardons, but Washington said, [...] "Those who have committed no fault want no pardon." [...] Patterson departed soon after. Washington's performance during the meeting was praised in parts of the colonies.|$|E
500|$|In 1835, Clifford {{was elected}} to the Massachusetts legislature, where he sat on a {{committee}} that revised the state's statutes. [...] In 1836 he served as an aide to Governor Edward Everett, a position he held until Everett lost the 1839 election. [...] Everett rewarded Clifford for his service by naming him district attorney for the southern district of the state in 1839, a post he held for ten years. [...] He was concurrently elected state senator representing Bristol County in 1845. [...] In 1849 he was appointed state attorney general by Governor George N. Briggs. [...] He was the only major appointed Whig official retained by Democrat George S. Boutwell after he took office in 1851. [...] Boutwell explained in his memoirs that Clifford [...] "was a good officer and an upright man, but he lacked the quality which enables a man to reach conclusions. [...] This peculiarity made him useful to me. He would investigate a subject, give me the authorities and precedents, and leave the conclusions to me. Next, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> the administration party whom I wished to appoint. Mr. [...] Hallett was the candidate most generally supported. He was full of prejudices and he was not well instructed as a lawyer. In these respects Clifford was his opposite." ...|$|E

500|$|In early August 1886, Dunlap {{was sold}} to the Detroit Wolverines for $4,700, the most {{expensive}} purchase price at the time. [...] In addition to the sum paid to the Maroons to grant the release, the Detroit team signed a contract to pay Dunlap $4,500 a season for two seasons, with an advance of $1,500 {{on the first day}} of November 1886 and 1887, respectively. [...] The mid-season sale led to concerns about the Maroons: [...] "The transfer of Dunlap to Detroit is a small thing in itself, but its bearing on the entire base ball world is so great as to almost revolutionize the present order of things. [...] He was the king pin of the St. Louis Club and his sale makes a certainty of the dissolution of the Maroons." [...] The Detroit management was praised for their [...] "pluck and enterprise" [...] in making the bold [...] "business stroke." [...] The Sporting News wrote at the time:"Dunlap has joined the Detroits and now that team will fly the League pennant just as sure as time flies and the world grows. [...] From the day the old St. Louis Union team went out of existence Dunlap has been anything but a favorite in St. Louis. [...] Still <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> the world but was willing to concede that he was the greatest second baseman America has ever known." ...|$|E

The album is named for the intermittent weak contractions which some pregnant women experience. Daymond reflected on the recording process [...] "Because it was self-produced as well, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> the producer's chair to tie the whole thing together. We've had to do that ourselves. We're a very close band but it was even more of a bonding experience in the recording studio, where we had to motivate each other to do our best and I think it's paid off".|$|E

2500|$|The {{revival of}} {{interest}} in the recorder in the twentieth century was stimulated by Arnold Dolmetsch, who began making copies of surviving early recorders in 1919. Shortly after founding the Haslemere Festival in 1925, he put his son Carl (then aged 15) in charge of recorder development. In addition to the descant (soprano), treble (alto), tenor, and bass sizes of recorders (usually tuned at A = 415 Hz) he produced for the needs of the Festival low alto recorders in E for Bach's cantata Gottes Zeit ist die allerbeste Zeit, BWV 106, sixth flutes for concertos by Woodcock and other eighteenth-century English composers, and voice flutes. The latter were used to play parts written for transverse flutes since, before 1930, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> the Haslemere circle who had mastered the embouchure of the Baroque one-keyed flute [...]|$|E

[...] He added that, [...] "I remember that in the first half of that Test match at Christchurch, Roger Gould had a kick charged down and I went to pick it up one-handed...and knocked on. In a Test match! Then, in the second half, we got the ball and ran it from our own line. Gould gave me the ball and <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> front of me except Allan Hewson, the All Black full-back. I tried to change hands and dropped the ball.

2500|$|Apart {{from the}} Bible and the {{traditional}} Law, which were usually the only subjects of study of the Jewish youth of that time, Samuel was instructed, probably in his early youth, in other sciences. It is likely that he accompanied his father on the latter's journey to Palestine (Yet. B. M. iv. 9c; Yer. Pes. v. 32a); for after his teacher Levi ben Sisi had gone to Palestine <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> Babylon with whom he could have studied. According to an account in the Talmud (B. M. 85b), which Rapoport declares to be a later addition ("'Erek Millin," [...] pp.10, 222), but which may have some basis in fact, Samuel {{is said to have}} cured R. Judah ha-Nasi I of an affliction of the eyes. Although Samuel was at that time too young to study directly under R. Judah, he studied under the pupils of the patriarch, especially with Hanina bar Hama (comp. Hoffmann, l.c. pp.71–73; Fessler, [...] "Mar Samuel, der Bedeutendste Amora," [...] p.14, note 1).|$|E

2500|$|American {{photographer}} Attila von Szalay {{was among}} the first to try recording what he believed to be voices of the dead as a way to augment his investigations in photographing ghosts. He began his attempts in 1941 using a 78 rpm record, but it wasn't until 1956, after switching to a reel-to-reel tape recorder, that he believed he was successful. Working with Raymond Bayless, von Szalay conducted a number of recording sessions with a custom-made apparatus, consisting of a microphone in an insulated cabinet connected to an external recording device and speaker. Szalay reported finding many sounds on the tape that could not be heard on the speaker at the time of recording, some of which were recorded when <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>in</b> the cabinet. He believed these sounds to be the voices of discarnate spirits. Among the first recordings believed to be spirit voices were such messages as [...] "This is G!", [...] "Hot dog, Art!", and [...] "Merry Christmas and Happy New Year to you all". [...] Von Szalay and Raymond Bayless' work was published by the Journal of the American Society for Psychical Research in 1959. Bayless later went on to co-author the 1979 book, Phone Calls From the Dead.|$|E
