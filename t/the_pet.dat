5|$|Thirty-eight {{species are}} {{threatened}} with extinction {{as a result}} of human activities. Antbirds are not targeted by either hunters or <b>the</b> <b>pet</b> trade.

5|$|Common names {{include the}} musky caiman, the dwarf caiman, Cuvier's caiman and the smooth-fronted caiman, {{although}} {{the last of}} these {{is also used to}} refer to the closely related Paleosuchus trigonatus.

5|$|Human {{activity}} {{is arguably the}} main reason for the population decline of the Puerto Rican amazon. Early settlers of Puerto Rico, such as the Taíno, hunted it for food consumption but managed to maintain a healthy ecological balance. Later, habitat destruction, capture of immature individuals for <b>the</b> <b>pet</b> industry, hunting and predation contributed to the sharp population decline. The clearing of mature forests for agricultural development is {{the main reason for}} the decline of population.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, Nestle Purina voluntarily {{recalled}} some of {{its products}} after a widespread contamination was discovered in <b>the</b> <b>pet</b> food industry, due to ingredients from China. The company has been recognized for sustainability practices in its manufacturing and sponsors many pet-related charities and events. It markets its pet food through crowd-sourced competitions, sponsorship, mobile apps, and television advertising.|$|E
40|$|The {{solid state}} {{polymerization}} (SSP) of PET/PC reactive extrusion blends - {{with and without}} cobalt catalyst - at different polymer ratios was studied. Thermal and rheological evaluations were performed. DSC results showed changes in <b>the</b> <b>PET's</b> Tg, Tch, Tm and Xc [...] The melt flow rate (MFR) decreased for <b>PET</b> and <b>the</b> blends. The intrinsic viscosity increased. The variation in calorimetric and rheological properties might be attributed to <b>the</b> <b>PET's</b> chain extension reactions - esterification and transesterification. These reactions led {{to an increase in}} <b>the</b> <b>PET's</b> molar mass, consequently shifting <b>the</b> <b>PET's</b> Tg to lower temperature and PET's crystallization, besides reducing the blend miscibility and flowability...|$|R
50|$|Depending on <b>the</b> <b>pet's</b> unique condition, {{there are}} several {{treatment}} options, including surgery, chemotherapy and radiation therapy.

Some of the toys released by Hasbro under this line include {{black and white}} pets and Rainbow pets, and they also brought back the Teensies LPS.|$|R
5|$|In ancient times, Pugs were bred to be companions for ruling {{families}} in China. <b>The</b> <b>pet</b> Pugs were highly valued by Chinese Emperors, and the royal dogs {{were kept in}} luxury and guarded by soldiers.

5|$|Many {{species of}} poison dart frogs have {{recently}} experienced habitat loss, chytrid diseases, and collection for <b>the</b> <b>pet</b> trade.

5|$|The Sunda slow loris {{is greatly}} {{threatened}} by <b>the</b> <b>pet</b> trade, and is sold as an exotic pet throughout southeast Asia. The slow lorises {{are the most}} commonly traded protected primates in southeast Asia. When sold as a pet it often will have its teeth pulled out to prevent injury to the owner. This may cause dental infections which have up to a 90% death rate. Once it has lost its teeth, reintroduction to the wild is impossible. Due to a very high mortality rate in captivity due to stress, improper nutrition and infection, <b>the</b> <b>pet</b> trade is inflated by replacements. With a greater purchasing power, the increasing human populations in the species' range could have an even more serious impact.|$|E
5|$|Tori Michel of About Entertainment gave {{praise to}} a DVD set {{containing}} five episodes {{of the first}} season. She wrote that despite the intended demographic, older children in {{elementary and middle school}} would find the writing humorous, while girls would find <b>the</b> <b>pet</b> characters entertaining the most. The Dove Foundation member Donna Rolfe gave the same set a full five stars.|$|E
5|$|Western artists often infused Euro-American {{characteristics}} in their {{depictions of the}} dogs of Polynesia and possibly many actually depicted <b>the</b> <b>pet</b> dogs kept on European ships rather than native breeds. This resulted in few accurate depictions of the dogs surviving. A few works likely depicting the aboriginal dog breed done by Parkinson, Webber, Alexander Buchan and John Frederick Miller were compiled by American anthropologist Katharine Luomala including the two images above.|$|E

5|$|As an {{arboreal}} lizard, V. salvadorii {{can hang}} onto branches with its rear legs and occasionally use its tail as a prehensile grip. The primary {{use of the}} tail, however, is to counterbalance its weight when leaping from one branch to another. The tail may {{also be used for}} defense, as captive specimens have attempted to whip their keepers with their tails. This species is occasionally seen in <b>the</b> <b>pet</b> trade, but has earned a reputation of being aggressive and unpredictable. Although they are known to rest and bask in trees, they sleep on the ground or submerged in water.|$|E
5|$|Cuvier's dwarf caiman (Paleosuchus palpebrosus) {{is a small}} crocodilian from {{northern}} and central South America in the alligator family. It is found in Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana, Paraguay, Peru, Surinam and Venezuela. It lives in riverine forests, flooded forests near lakes, and near fast-flowing rivers and streams. It can traverse dry land to reach temporary pools and tolerates colder water than other species of alligator. Other common names for this species include the musky caiman, the dwarf caiman, Cuvier's caiman and the smooth-fronted caiman. It is sometimes kept in captivity as a pet and may {{be referred to as}} the wedge head caiman by <b>the</b> <b>pet</b> trade.|$|E

5|$|Given Hasbro's {{framework}} for Littlest Pet Shop, the developers Cahills pitched their {{adaptation of the}} property. Hasbro originally felt discouraged over having the show set at <b>the</b> <b>pet</b> store, finding the exchange of animals they thought would come from that disconcerting. The Cahills saw the studio's definition of such stores as antiquated, convincing them that most modern locations provide grooming and day care services as opposed to merely selling pets. Production followed quickly, much to their surprise.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, Nestlé Purina Petcare {{formed a}} {{partnership}} with the Canine Health Foundation to advance veterinary research. The following year the company donated 80 tons of pet food to pets affected by Hurricane Charley in Florida and donated $100,000 to local animal shelters. Nestlé Purina Petcare grew from about 11 percent of Nestlé's revenues in 2001, to one-third by 2005. By 2006 it was the largest market-share holder in <b>the</b> <b>pet</b> food industry with 32 percent of the market.|$|E
5|$|Many {{crocodilians}} are {{hunted for}} their skins, {{but this is}} not the case with the Cuvier's dwarf caiman. This may be because the ventral skin in this species is too heavily armoured to make it easy to tan. Some individuals are killed by indigenous peoples for food and others, particularly in Guyana, are collected for <b>the</b> <b>pet</b> trade; but there is no evidence that populations are dwindling as a result. There are some threats to this species from habitat destruction, including the mining of gold, but these are not thought to be of great significance. The estimated total population is over one million individuals.|$|E
