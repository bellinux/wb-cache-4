25|$|Maintainability: Maintainability {{includes}} {{the notion of}} adaptability, portability and <b>transferability</b> (from one development team to another). Measuring and monitoring maintainability is a must for mission-critical applications where change is driven by tight time-to-market schedules {{and where it is}} important for IT to remain responsive to business-driven changes. It is also essential to keep maintenance costs under control.|$|E
25|$|Based on {{evidence}} from previous attempts, {{there is a}} likely lack of <b>transferability</b> of one type of GM crop from one region to another. For example, modified crops that have proven successful in Asia from the Green Revolution have failed when tried in regions of Africa. More research must be done regarding the specific requirements of growing a specific crop in a specific region.|$|E
25|$|In early June 2008, the White House {{signaled}} {{the president might}} be willing to sign {{a modified version of the}} Webb bill, along with the war funding bill, if <b>transferability</b> between spouses and dependents was added onto the new GI Bill. This would make the benefits more valuable to career military personal that would like to pay for their spouse or child's education. On June 19, this provision was added to the war funding bill. With the added <b>transferability</b> provisions for continued military service, McCain said he now supported the bill, because it encouraged additional service beyond three years, mitigating his earlier concerns. McCain, who had not voted in the Senate since April 8, was campaigning in Ohio on June 26 and was not present for the final senate vote on the bill, which passed 92–6 (The only other senator not voting was Ted Kennedy, who was recovering after surgery to remove a brain tumor). Bush signed the war funding bill, along with the veterans education benefits, into law on June 30, 2008.|$|E
25|$|Maintainability {{includes}} {{concepts of}} modularity, understandability, changeability, testability, reusability, and <b>transferability</b> from one development team to another. These {{do not take}} the form of critical issues at the code level. Rather, poor maintainability is typically the result of thousands of minor violations with best practices in documentation, complexity avoidance strategy, and basic programming practices that make the difference between clean and easy-to-read code vs. unorganized and difficult-to-read code.|$|E
25|$|Entitlements vary {{state by}} state and {{according}} to the use, source, legal form, level of devolution, security and <b>transferability</b> among others. There has been a move across all states in recent years to move from older forms of water entitlement to more secure and transferable entitlements. Key parts of this move has been the separation of water entitlements from ties to particular parcels of land and the specification of entitlements with specific volumes and reliability.|$|E
25|$|Similar {{statutory}} regimes were {{in place}} in France and {{in the majority of}} the U.S. states by 1860. By the final quarter of the nineteenth century, most European countries had adopted the principle of limited liability. The development of limited liability facilitated the move to large-scale industrial enterprise, by removing the threat that an individual's total wealth would be confiscated if invested in an unsuccessful company. Large sums of personal financial capital became available, and the <b>transferability</b> of shares permitted a degree of business continuity not possible in other forms of enterprise.|$|E

2500|$|Measure 49, {{passed in}} 2007, {{virtually}} replaces Measure 37. It eliminated nearly every Measure 37 provision {{designed to allow}} pre-regulation use of one's own property, {{as well as all}} compensation provisions. [...] It also addresses questions about <b>transferability,</b> and offered to fast-track some smaller Measure 37 claims under post 2007 land use regulations.|$|E
2500|$|Another type of {{fractional}} ownership, {{not part}} of a securitized business plan is Tenancy in Common, which is grounded in the real property laws of most, if not all states. The main difference is there is no right of survivorship to the sponsor or other owners if one or more of owners were to pass away. Where there are similarities with the equal sharing of operational expenses, rental income and access, the striking difference is free <b>transferability</b> of the owner's interest in the property without regard to the other owners in the property.|$|E
2500|$|Milan Metro is {{the rapid}} transit system serving {{the city and}} {{surrounding}} municipalities, that with 19 metro lines, 14 sub-urban lines and 5 city metro lines, with the metro city lines having a length of more than [...] {{and is one of}} the largest in Europe. The recently opened M5 line is undergoing further expansion and the construction of the M4 line is underway. The Milan suburban railway service comprises 12 lines and connects the metropolitan area with the city centre through the Milan Passerby underground railway. Commonly referred to as [...] "Il Passante", it has a train running every 6 minutes (and in the city functions as a subway line with full <b>transferability</b> to the Milan Metro).|$|E
2500|$|Performance {{appraisal}} (PA) systems, and {{the premises}} of which they were based, that have been formed and regarded as effective in the United States {{may not have the}} <b>transferability</b> for effectual utilization in other countries or cultures, and vice versa. [...] Performance [...] "appraisal is thought to be deeply rooted in the norms, values, and beliefs of a society". [...] "Appraisal reflects attitudes towards motivation and performance (self) and relationships (e.g. peers, subordinates, supervisors, organization), all of which vary from one country to the next". [...] Therefore, appraisal should be in conjunction with cultural norms, values, and beliefs in order to be operative. [...] The deep-seated norms, values and beliefs in different cultures affect employee motivation and perception of organizational equity and justice. [...] In effect, a PA system created and considered effectual in one country may not be an appropriate assessment in another cultural region.|$|E
2500|$|A {{variety of}} {{companies}} may be incorporated under the Companies Act 2006. The {{people interested in}} starting the enterprise - the prospective directors, employees and shareholders - may choose, firstly, an unlimited or a limited company. [...] "Unlimited" [...] will mean the incorporators will be liable for all losses and debts under the general principles of private law. The option of a limited company leads to a second choice. A company can be [...] "limited by guarantee", meaning that if the company owes more debts than it can pay, the guarantors' liability {{will be limited to}} the extent of the money they elect to guarantee. Or a company may choose to be [...] "limited by shares", meaning capital investors' liability is limited to the amount they subscribe for in share capital. A third choice is whether a company limited by shares will be public or private. Both kinds of companies must display (partly as a warning) the endings [...] "plc" [...] or [...] "Ltd" [...] following the company name. Most new businesses will opt for a private company limited by shares, while unlimited companies and companies limited by guarantee are typically chosen by either charities, risky ventures or mutual funds wanting to signal they will not leave debts unpaid. Charitable ventures also have the option to become a community interest company. Public companies are the predominant business vehicle in the UK economy. While far less numerous than private companies, they employ the overwhelming mass of British workers and turn over the greatest share of wealth. Public companies can offer shares to the public, must have a minimum capital of £50,000, must allow free <b>transferability</b> of its shares, and typically (as most big public companies will be listed) will follow requirements of the London Stock Exchange or a similar securities market. Businesses may also elect to incorporate under the European Company Statute as a Societas Europaea. An [...] "SE" [...] will be treated in every European Union member state {{as if it were a}} public company formed in accordance with the law of that state, and may opt in or out of employee involvement.|$|E
60|$|It is {{difficult}} to believe that any large number of people really accepted this headlong painting of the map of Africa in European colours as a permanent new settlement of the worlds affairs, but it is the duty of the historian to record that it was so accepted. There was but a shallow historical background to the European mind in the nineteenth century, and no habit of penetrating criticism. The quite temporary advantages that the mechanical revolution in the west had given the Europeans over the rest of the old world were regarded by people, blankly ignorant of such events as the great Mongol conquests, as evidences of a permanent and assured European leadership of mankind. They had no sense of the <b>transferability</b> of science and its fruits. They did not realize that Chinamen and Indians could carry on the work of research as ably as Frenchmen or Englishmen. They believed that there was some innate intellectual drive in the west, and some innate indolence and conservatism in the east, that assured the Europeans a world predominance for ever.|$|E
