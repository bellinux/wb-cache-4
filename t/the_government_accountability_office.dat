5|$|The {{mayor and}} council set local taxes and a budget, {{which must be}} {{approved}} by Congress. <b>The</b> <b>Government</b> <b>Accountability</b> <b>Office</b> and other analysts have estimated that the city's high percentage of tax-exempt property and the Congressional prohibition of commuter taxes create a structural deficit in the District's local budget of anywhere between $470million and over $1billion per year.

5|$|Some reports {{suggested}} that the Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicle program to replace the M113 family of vehicles was being favored over the GCV program.

In April 2013, the Congressional Budget Office said the AMPV {{would be a better}} buy because analysts had asserted that the vehicles the GCV was slated to replace should not be first. The GCV would replace 61 M2 Bradley IFVs per armored combat brigade, making up 18 percent of the 346 armored combat vehicles in each armored brigade. A 24 September 2013 Congressional Research Service report {{suggested that}} given budgetary constraints, the GCV program may be unrealistic, and that one potential discussion could focus on a decision by the Army to replace the GCV with the AMPV as their number one ground combat vehicle acquisition priority.|$|E
