40|$|Strong and {{effective}} systems <b>of</b> <b>governance</b> {{are required to}} steer energy finance towards the fulfilment of policy goals around energy security, energy poverty and sustainability. This article assesses and explains the nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> contemporary <b>governance</b> <b>of</b> energy finance. It first provides a typology and analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> different <b>governance</b> dimensions associated with: (i) <b>the</b> public <b>governance</b> <b>of</b> public finance; (ii) <b>the</b> public <b>governance</b> <b>of</b> private finance; and (iii) <b>the</b> private <b>governance</b> <b>of</b> private finance. It then identifies and seeks to account for key cross-cutting trends in these patterns <b>of</b> <b>governance.</b> Overall, while it finds evidence of significant activity {{in each of these}} areas, there remains a substantial imbalance towards governance for energy finance over <b>governance</b> <b>of</b> energy finance. This has important implications for constructing effective solutions to the multiple challenges that energy policy currently faces...|$|R

5|$|With the {{creation}} of a national Sejm in 1493, which took over the powers of taxation and the pospolite ruszenie previously granted to sejmiks at Nieszawa, the importance of regional governance somewhat diminished.

5|$|In the 16th {{century the}} Reformation brought {{about changes in}} <b>the</b> <b>governance</b> <b>of</b> the cathedrals as {{discussed}} below. Some existent buildings became cathedrals at this time. Several of the buildings were structurally damaged or left incomplete because of the Dissolution of the Monasteries, 1537–40. Many of the large abbey churches, particularly those outside the towns, were robbed, burnt out and abandoned. The late 16th and early 17th centuries saw repairs to the fabric of many cathedrals and some new building and stained glass {{as well as many}} new fittings.|$|E
5|$|On December 16, 1902, Sebree {{was granted}} {{a leave of absence}} to return to the United States and care for his wife who had been badly hurt in a fall. In his place, Lieutenant Commander Henry Minett, Sebree's {{executive}} officer, was made acting commandant of the station and therefore acting governor of the territory. He was also given command of the Wheeling. Captain Edmund Beardsley Underwood was selected as Sebree's replacement, but that decision was not made official immediately, and Underwood remained in Washington to consult with Sebree and President Roosevelt on <b>the</b> <b>governance</b> <b>of</b> the territory. Underwood's selection was not announced until May 1903.|$|E

Along with the previously mentioned fear of increases in taxation or decreases in services, he argued that those living in the ACT would have felt that they already had a voice in <b>the</b> <b>governance</b> <b>of</b> the territory, through federal electoral representation. Canberra also had a high proportion of public servants who felt that they were already a part of the government, and knew how to work with the system.|$|E

5|$|Rather than {{repeating the}} devolved {{arrangements}} of previous treaties, Edward chose to permanently colonise North Wales instead. The remaining royal family of Llwelyn and Dafydd was crushed and their lands divided amongst major English nobles. <b>The</b> <b>governance</b> <b>of</b> Wales was reformed, and the arrangements {{set out in}} the Statute of Rhuddlan, enacted on 3March 1284. Wales was divided into counties and shires, emulating how England was governed, with three new shires created in the north-west: Caernarfon, Merioneth and Anglesey.|$|E
5|$|Swimming {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{organised}} sports for people with disabilities, and was contested at the first Summer Paralympics in 1960. Both the rules for the sport and approval of classifications were the responsibility of the Fédération International de Natation Amateur (FINA) until 1992, when the International Paralympic Committee took over <b>the</b> <b>governance</b> <b>of</b> classification. As of 2012, people with visual, physical and intellectual disabilities are eligible to compete in the sport. The classification system was originally based on medical criteria, but has since moved to one largely based on functional disability to make para-swimming more competitive. The sport is moving towards an evidence-based classification system.|$|E
