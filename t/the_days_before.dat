5|$|According to Kotaku, a remastered {{version of}} Day of the Tentacle {{was in the}} works at LucasArts Singapore before the sale of LucasArts to Disney in 2012.

5|$|In <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>before</b> the {{beginning}} of the race, there was controversy over the first stage. On arriving at the start, the teams discovered that the route used a variety of road surfaces, crossed sandy sections and included several ramps. As a result, the race organisers decided to neutralise the stage: the teams therefore competed only for the stage victory and for the team classification, not for the general classification.|$|E

The porter would expect his money; I could not pay him; here was scandal in the house; and I knew right well the cause of scandal would have to pack.

5|$|As plans {{moved forward}} the {{decision}} was made not just to play the game but make it an event celebrating New York hockey history. For the game the Crunch played their intrastate rivals the Binghamton Senators. <b>The</b> <b>days</b> <b>before</b> the game local youth hockey teams played on the ice, and then the day after there was a pond hockey tournament played on the rink featuring 16 local teams. The fairgrounds also featured VIP tents, fan zones, bands, and ice sculpting for the celebration, as well as appearances by former players for New York's various professional teams.|$|E
5|$|As {{the case}} {{expanded}} beyond his jurisdiction, Curto recused {{himself from the}} trial {{and was replaced by}} Javier Beltramone, who released García from prison. Litoral Gas demanded Beltramone's recusal for expressing an opinion about the case to the press. The appeal court agreed in a 2–1 vote to remove Beltramone, and the case was transferred to Patricia Bilotta. García had claimed that he was following instructions received in <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>before</b> the explosion, so Bilotta summoned the technical officers of Litoral Gas to clarify that point. Litoral Gas said that García had not received any instructions prior to the explosion.|$|E
5|$|During <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>before</b> the storm's {{arrival in}} Florida, the Weather Bureau issued 40tropical cyclone-related advisories. Extensive {{preparations}} {{that resulted in}} a low loss of life and property were attributed to the warnings. In southern Florida, residents boarded up homes and businesses, and sought shelter in large structures. Hurricane parties took place in bars and hotel rooms, while some residents sat in hotel lobbies, listening to radio broadcasts. In Miami, stores sold out of various essentials—including bread and butter—as people prepared for the storm.|$|E

5|$|Governor David Paterson's {{selection}} process {{began with a}} number of prominent names and high-ranking New York Democrats, including Andrew Cuomo, Fran Drescher and Caroline Kennedy, vying for the spot. Gillibrand quietly campaigned for the position, meeting secretly with Paterson on at least one occasion. She said that she made an effort to underscore her successful House elections in a largely conservative district, adding that she could be a good complement to Chuck Schumer. Gillibrand was presumed a likely choice in <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>before</b> the official announcement. On January 23, 2009, Paterson held a press conference to announce Gillibrand as his choice.|$|E
5|$|In <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>before</b> {{and after}} the first {{demonstration}} of a nuclear weapon, the Trinity test in July 1945, his fellow Hungarian Leo Szilard circulated the Szilard petition, which argued that a demonstration to the Japanese of the new weapon should occur prior to actual use on Japan, and with that hopefully the weapons would never be used on people. In response to Szilard's petition, Teller consulted his friend Robert Oppenheimer. Teller believed that Oppenheimer was a natural leader and could help him with such a formidable political problem. Oppenheimer reassured Teller that the nation's fate {{should be left to}} the sensible politicians in Washington. Bolstered by Oppenheimer's influence, he decided to not sign the petition.|$|E
5|$|In <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>before</b> {{the start}} of the special session, it became clear that a major battle was brewing between the {{moderate}} segregationists and the extreme segregationists. Delegates from Northern Virginia openly opposed the Stanley plan as well as calls for even more radical legislation. Although most moderate segregationists had joined with the extremists in initially supporting the Gray Commission plan and the call for a constitutional convention, the moderates largely did not support interposition. The moderate segregationists also joined with many (such as leading educators, urban leaders from Northern Virginia, former state superintendent of public schools Dabney Lancaster, several General Assembly delegates, and Gray Commission vice chairman Harry B. Davis) who felt that the tuition voucher proposal would undermine public education.|$|E

5|$|On May 11, a {{grand jury}} was {{assembled}} in McLennan County and quickly returned an indictment against Washington; the trial was scheduled for May 15. The Times-Herald of Waco published a notice on May 12 requesting that residents let the justice system determine Washington's fate. Fleming traveled to Robinson on May 13 to ask residents to remain calm; his address was well received. Washington was assigned several inexperienced lawyers. His lawyers prepared no defense, and noted that he appeared placid in <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>before</b> the trial.|$|E
5|$|On the day decreed, Le Gris and Carrouges {{travelled}} through Paris to the Abbey of Saint-Martin-des-Champs in the city's Northern suburbs. The abbey's field {{had been}} converted from a jousting ground to a wooden arena especially for the combat, surrounded by banks for the spectators and a royal box. Attending the duel {{was not only the}} King and his uncles John, Duke of Berry, Philip the Bold and Louis II, Duke of Bourbon and his brother the Duke of Orléans, but thousands of ordinary Parisians, Normans and visiting French. Thousands of people had flooded into the city in <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>before</b> the combat to see the spectacle but all had been warned not to physically aid the combatants on pain of death, nor call out during the fight on pain of losing a hand.|$|E

5|$|The Netzarim junction, {{where the}} {{shooting}} took place, is {{known locally as}} the al-Shohada (martyrs') junction. It lies on Saladin Road, a few kilometres south of Gaza City. The source of conflict at the junction was the nearby Netzarim settlement, where 60 Israeli families lived until Israel's withdrawal from Gaza in 2005. A military escort accompanied the settlers whenever they left or arrived at the settlement, and an Israeli military outpost, Magen-3, guarded the approach. The area had been the scene of violent incidents in <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>before</b> the shooting.|$|E
5|$|The authorship of seventy-three of The Federalist essays {{is fairly}} certain. Twelve of these essays are disputed over by some scholars, though the modern {{consensus}} is that Madison wrote essays Nos. 49–58, with Nos. 18–20 being products of a collaboration between him and Hamilton; No. 64 was by John Jay. The first open designation of which essay belonged to whom was provided by Hamilton, who in <b>the</b> <b>days</b> <b>before</b> his ultimately fatal gun duel with Aaron Burr provided his lawyer with a list detailing the author of each number. This list credited Hamilton with a full sixty-three of the essays (three of those being jointly written with Madison), almost three-quarters of the whole, and {{was used as the}} basis for an 1810 printing that was the first to make specific attribution for the essays.|$|E

He remained a prisoner of the Germans, under house arrest, {{for the rest of the}} war.
