5|$|Although congressional Republicans {{had opposed}} Clinton's Deficit Reduction Act of 1993, a key {{aspect of the}} 1994 Contract with America was {{the promise of a}} {{balanced}} federal budget. After the end of the government shutdown, Gingrich and other Republican leaders acknowledged that Congress would not be able <b>to</b> <b>draft</b> <b>a</b> balanced budget in 1996. Instead, they opted to approve some small reductions that were already approved by the White House and to wait until the next election season.|$|E
5|$|English chemist John Newlands {{produced}} {{a series of}} papers from 1863 to 1866 noting that when the elements were listed in order of increasing atomic weight, similar {{physical and chemical properties}} recurred at intervals of eight; he likened such periodicity to the octaves of music. This so termed Law of Octaves, however, was ridiculed by Newlands' contemporaries, and the Chemical Society refused to publish his work. Newlands was nonetheless able <b>to</b> <b>draft</b> <b>a</b> table of the elements and used it to predict the existence of missing elements, such as germanium. The Chemical Society only acknowledged the significance of his discoveries five years after they credited Mendeleev.|$|E

5|$|From 1786 to 1787, {{an armed}} uprising, known as Shays' Rebellion led by Revolutionary War veteran Daniel Shays wrought havoc {{throughout}} Massachusetts and ultimately attempted {{to seize the}} Federal armory.

On February 6, 1788, Massachusetts became the sixth state to ratify the United States Constitution.|$|E
5|$|In 1746 Beverley was {{commissioned}} by Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron, to represent him in an expedition with Peter Jefferson (father of Thomas Jefferson) through western Virginia to mark the Fairfax Line of the Northern Neck Proprietary, supervising the work of Jefferson and the other surveyors. The following year, {{he and the other}} participants in the Fairfax Line expedition reconvened at Jefferson's Tuckahoe plantation <b>to</b> <b>draft</b> <b>a</b> map (which became known as the Fry-Jefferson Map) of the Northern Neck Proprietary.|$|E
5|$|In 1776, the Sejm {{commissioned}} former chancellor Andrzej Zamoyski <b>to</b> <b>draft</b> <b>a</b> {{new legal}} code. By 1780, {{he and his}} collaborators had produced the Zamoyski Code (Zbiór praw sądowych). It would have strengthened royal power, made all officials answerable to the Sejm, placed the clergy and their finances under state supervision, and deprived landless szlachta of many of their legal immunities. The Code would also have improved the situation of non-noblestownspeople and peasants. Zamoyski's progressive legal code, containing elements of constitutional reform, met with opposition from native conservative szlachta and foreign powers; the 1780 Sejm did not adopt it.|$|E

5|$|Liliʻuokalani {{ascended to}} the throne on January 29, 1891, nine days after her brother's death. During her reign, she {{attempted}} <b>to</b> <b>draft</b> <b>a</b> new constitution which would restore {{the power of the}} monarchy and the voting rights of the economically disenfranchised. Threatened by her attempts to abrogate the Bayonet Constitution, pro-American elements in Hawaii overthrew the monarchy on January 17, 1893. The overthrow was bolstered by the landing of US Marines under John L. Stevens to protect American interests, which rendered the monarchy unable to protect itself.|$|E
5|$|Only {{the barest}} {{outlines}} of Theramenes' life outside {{the public sphere}} have been preserved in the historical record. His father, Hagnon had {{played a significant role}} in Athenian public life in the decades before Theramenes' appearance on the scene. He had commanded the group of Greek colonists who founded Amphipolis in 437–6 BC, had served as a general on several occasions before and during the Peloponnesian War, and was one of the signers of the Peace of Nicias. Hagnon's career overlapped with his son's when he served as one of the ten commissioners appointed by the government of the 400 <b>to</b> <b>draft</b> <b>a</b> new constitution in 411 BC.|$|E
5|$|The 1964 General Assembly also passed {{legislation}} <b>to</b> <b>draft</b> <b>a</b> new state constitution. Thirty-eight citizens {{were chosen to}} draft the new document, {{which was based on}} national models. County leaders opposed the document because of perceived threats to the independence of local governments and an apparent consolidation of power in Frankfort. Despite Breathitt's strong support, the proposed constitution was defeated by Kentucky voters by an overwhelming margin of 510,099 to 140,210.|$|E

5|$|The Commission on Constitutional Revision {{presented}} {{its report}} and recommendations to Governor Godwin and the General Assembly in January 1969, {{and continued to}} work with them <b>to</b> <b>draft</b> <b>a</b> final consensus version. The proposed Constitution was overwhelmingly approved by the voters of Virginia (who by then included African-American men and women, following passage of federal civil rights legislation in the mid-1960s) and took effect on July 1, 1971.|$|E
5|$|The Stanley {{plan had}} the support of the more extreme segregationists in Virginia as well. The first week of July, the Defenders {{promoted}} a plan that would withdraw the legal basis for lawsuits against school districts, permit state takeovers of school districts which integrated, and deny state funds to school districts which integrated. The Defenders opposed any pupil assignment plan as too moderate a response. Accommodating this extremist sentiment, the pupil assignment plan approved at the July 2 meeting was fairly weak. After the meeting, Gray independently asked Mays <b>to</b> <b>draft</b> <b>a</b> stronger pupil assignment proposal.|$|E
5|$|Accepting {{the offer}} on January 19, 2009, Ryan {{immediately}} began {{to carry out a}} plan of action that he had outlined for the franchise's future. He planned to remove the players from distractions {{on and off the field}} and allow them get to know one another to build team chemistry. Thus, training camp was moved to the campus of SUNY Cortland, where the team would be relatively secluded from the media and any other distractions. Ryan and general manager Mike Tannenbaum were also determined <b>to</b> <b>draft</b> <b>a</b> quarterback who could lead and be the face of the franchise. As a result, the team traded up to select Mark Sanchez of USC in the first round with the fifth overall pick in the 2009 NFL Draft.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} 1940, Hitler asked Himmler <b>to</b> <b>draft</b> <b>a</b> {{new plan}} for the {{elimination}} of the Jews of Europe, and Himmler passed along the task to Heydrich. His draft proposed the deportation of the Jews to the Soviet Union via Poland. The later Generalplan Ost (General Plan for the East), prepared by Professor Konrad Meyer and others, called for deporting the entire population of occupied Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union to Siberia, either for use as slave labour or to be murdered after the Soviet defeat. After the Axis failure in the Battle of Moscow and the entry of the United States into the war in December 1941, Hitler resolved that the Jews of Europe were to be exterminated immediately rather than after the war, which now had no end in sight. Since transporting masses of people into a combat zone would be impossible, Heydrich decided that the Jews would be killed in extermination camps set up in occupied areas of Poland. The total number of Jews murdered during the resulting Holocaust is estimated at 5.5 to 6 million people.|$|E
5|$|At {{the meeting}} in September, representatives of the Rock Island Independents, the Muncie Flyers, the Decatur Staleys, the Racine Cardinals, the Massillon Tigers, the Chicago Cardinals, the Rochester Jeffersons, and the Hammond Pros. The {{following}} was achieved during the September 17 meeting: the name of American Professional Football Association was chosen; officers of the league were elected with Jim Thorpe as president; a membership fee of $100 was set; a committee <b>to</b> <b>draft</b> <b>a</b> constitution was named; {{the secretary of the}} league was to receive a list of all players used during the season by January 1, 1921; and the trophy that would be awarded to the league champions. Even though the Panhandles were not at the meetings, they were still a charter member of the APFA.|$|E
5|$|During the 1950s, {{agitation}} grew in Alaska for {{the territory}} {{to become a}} state. Alaskans could not vote in presidential elections and had a territorial legislature with limited powers. Efforts to lobby federal legislators for an Alaska statehood bill met with limited success, so prominent territorial officials decided <b>to</b> <b>draft</b> <b>a</b> state constitution to prove Alaska's readiness to become a state. On November 8, 1955, 55 elected delegates gathered at the University of Alaska to begin drafting a state constitution. The resulting debates lasted {{more than two months}} and caused a sensation in Fairbanks. Debates of the constitutional convention were broadcast on Fairbanks radio, and the Fairbanks Daily News-Miner dedicated daily reports to the progress of the convention. On February 5, 1956, the delegates signed the constitution in front of 1,000 people who crowded into the University of Alaska gymnasium. The building where deliberations took place was subsequently named Constitution Hall.|$|E
