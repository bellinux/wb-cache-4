40|$|This paper {{describes}} the heteroepitaxial growth of single-crystalline 3 C-SiC (cubic silicon carbide) thin films on Si (100) wafers by atmospheric pressure {{chemical vapor deposition}} (APCVD) at 1350 oC for micro/ nanoelectromechanical system (M/NEMS) applications, in which hexamethyldisilane (HMDS, Si 2 (CH 3) 6) {{was used as a}} safe organosilane single-source precursor. The HMDS flow rate was 0. 5 sccm and the H 2 carrier gas flow rate was 2. 5 slm. The HMDS flow rate was important in obtaing a mirror-like crystalline surface. The growth rate of the 3 C-SiC film in this work was 4. 3 μm/h. A 3 C-SiC epitaxial film grown on the Si (100) substrate was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), reflection high energy electron diffraction (RHEED), atomic force microscopy (AFM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Raman scattering, respectively. These results show that the main chemical components of the grown film were single-crystalline 3 C-SiC layers.

40|$|We {{quantify}} {{and explain}} the effects of both anti-phase boundaries and <b>twin</b> <b>defects</b> in as-transformed τ-MnAl by carrying out micromagnetic simulations based closely {{on the results of}} microstructural characterization. We demonstrate that magnetic domain walls nucleate readily at anti-phase boundaries and are strongly pinned by them, due to anti-ferromagnetic coupling. Likewise, twin boundaries reduce the external field required to nucleate domain walls and provide strong pinning potentials, with the pinning strength dependent on the twinning angle. The relative strengths of the known <b>twin</b> <b>defect</b> types are quantified based on the anisotropy angles across their boundaries. Samples that have undergone heat treatment are imaged using electron back-scatter diffraction. The precise crystallographic orientation is mapped spatially and converted into a number of realistic finite element models, which are used to compute the effects of large concentrations of twin domains in a realistic morphology. This is shown to {{have a negative effect on}} the remanence coercivity and squareness. The maximum energy product (BH) _max is therefore significantly lower than the theoretical limit of the material and much lower than MnAl permanent magnets that have been further processed to remove <b>twin</b> <b>defects.</b> The knowledge gained in this study will allow the optimization of processing routes in order to develop permanent magnets with enhanced magnetic properties.

By first principles calculations we show that the local atomic structural configuration of the twin boundary does not change the nature of the superexchange interactions between the two Fe sublattices across the twin grain boundary.

40|$|Abstract. The {{structural}} and morphological modifications {{induced by the}} carbonization stage upon 3 C-SiC heteroepitaxial films grown on (111) and (100) oriented silicon substrates have been investigated.

The (111) heteroepitaxial films coalesce more rapidly and present a lower dependence on the carbonization conditions than (100) films. By comparing the evolution of the interfacial defects (voids) density with existing models, we show that this is related to the initial mechanisms occurring during the carbonization stage. The <b>twin</b> <b>defects</b> densities on (111), (100) and (211) films are also investigated {{and the role of the}} only carbonization stage on their formation is studied...|$|R

Device-quality Ge virtual substrates have been demonstrated and the best virtual substrates obtained in this work have a TDD below 107 cm- 2 with surface roughness of 0. 15 nm. The Ge p-type field effect transistor (pFET) device performance and p+/n diode junction leakage dependence on the layer quality are presented. The challenges of Ge growth in 10 - 20 nm wide nanochannels for making Ge FinFETs, such as surface migration and twin formation, have also been investigated. Successful Ge selective growth in nanochannels is realized at a low temperature and a laser treatment is used to reduce the grown-in <b>twin</b> <b>defects.</b> The selective growth of InP in STI trenches on both miscut and standard Si (001) substrates has been studied {{in terms of the}} nucleation and defect formation. A thin Ge buffer layer is used as the intermediate layer between the InP and the Si substrates to alleviate the large lattice mismatch and to facilitate the InP nucleation. The formation of <b>twin</b> <b>defects</b> at the STI sidewalls has been investigated and eventually avoided by optimizing the growth conditions as well as the STI sidewall tapering angles. To ultimately implement InP growth on standard Si (001) substrates, a surface engineering method has been employed to create local atomic steps to suppress antiphase boundaries. The properly controlled Si recess and the Ge buffer layer thickness give high-quality InP materials in submicron trenches. Together with the TD necking effect, high-quality InP virtual substrates have been successfully demonstrated by using Si (001) substrates, which enables the fabrication of InGaAs high-mobility devices on Si (001) substrates. nrpages: 179 status: publishe...|$|R

It is {{shown that the}} paramagnetic extrapolations of spin-polarized results are essential to correctly reproduce pyrolusite as the ground state of Mn 02. While many other structures {{are found to be}} near degenerate in energy with pyrolusite, no thermal disorder exists in the system up to several thousand degrees as the strong correlation of the Mn-vacancy order along the lines of face sharing octahedra removes any low-energy excitations from the system. Mn-vacancies compensated by protons, ubiquitously present in commercial Mn 02 have a dramatic effect on phase stability and induce the formation of ramsdellite Mn 02 and <b>twinning</b> <b>defects.</b> We believe these proton compensated Mn vacancies to be the source of the structural complexity of synthetic Mn 02 produced either electrochemically or chemically. It is shown that protons are always covalently bonded to an oxygen atom in Mn 02. In ramsdeHite, the proton prefers the pyramidal oxygen to the planar coordinated oxygen atom. In both pyrolusite and manganite, the protons may appear to be at an octahedral center in experiments as the activation barrier for hopping between the two stable sites {{on each side of the}} octahedral position is only about 25 meV. Introduction of die Wolff disorder and <b>twinning</b> <b>defects</b> is found to have a large adverse effect on the diffusivity of protons in [gamma]-Mn 02. Protonation also increase barriers to proton migration due to Jahn-Teller distortion and H-H interactions. Results indicate that direct H-H interactions are not that significant compared to oxygen mediated indirect interactions, observed in manganite. Experimental and calculated ramsdellite discharge curves deviate significantly at the early stages of the reduction process. We believe that a significant source of this discrepancy is the presence of proton compensated Mn vacancies in real Mn 02, which create local sites with higher discharge potential. Calculations also suggest that the ordered phase, observed in experiments at mid-reduction (groutellite, MnOOHo. 5), may be due to lattice remaining coherent during intercalation. by Dinesh Balachandran.
