5|$|Cyclone Bola {{remained}} near Vanuatu {{for about}} a week, during which it reached its peak intensity while executing a cyclonic loop. The most affected locations were Epi island, <b>the</b> <b>Shepherd</b> Islands, and the islands in Malampa Province, and throughout the country the cyclone affected more than 15,000people and 3,000houses. In a five-day period the cyclone dropped about 450mm (17.7in) of rainfall. Two bridges on Malakula were destroyed, and several other bridges were flooded or damaged. The passage of the cyclone also left several buildings, roads, and crop fields damaged.|$|E

5|$|In May 1975, during {{restoration}} work, {{the monks}} of Saint Catherine's Monastery discovered a room beneath the St. George Chapel which contained many parchment fragments. Kurt Aland {{and his team}} from the Institute for New Testament Textual Research were the first scholars who exclusively were invited to analyse, examine and photograph these new fragments of the New Testament in 1982. Among these fragments were twelve complete leaves from the Sinaiticus, 11 leaves of the Pentateuch and 1 leaf of <b>the</b> <b>Shepherd</b> of Hermas. Together with these leaves 67 Greek Manuscripts of New Testament have been found (uncials 0278 – 0296 and some minuscules).|$|E
5|$|In {{the last}} two books of the work (Books XXXVI and XXXVII), Pliny {{describes}} many different minerals and gemstones, building on works by Theophrastus and other authors. The topic concentrates on the most valuable gemstones, and he criticises the obsession with luxury products such as engraved gems and hardstone carvings. He provides a thorough discussion of the properties of fluorspar, noting that it is carved into vases and other decorative objects. The account of magnetism includes the myth of Magnes <b>the</b> <b>shepherd.</b>|$|E
5|$|Mayfair {{was mainly}} open fields until {{development}} started in <b>the</b> <b>Shepherd</b> Market area around 1686-8 {{to accommodate the}} May Fair that had moved from Haymarket in St James's because of overcrowding.

5|$|There {{has been}} a {{settlement}} at Faversham since pre-Roman times, next to the ancient sea port on Faversham Creek, and archaeological evidence has shown a Roman theatre was based in the town. It was inhabited by the Saxons and mentioned in the Domesday book as Favreshant. The town was favoured by King Stephen who established Faversham Abbey, which survived until the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1538. Subsequently, the town became an important seaport and established itself as a centre for brewing, and <b>the</b> <b>Shepherd</b> Neame Brewery, founded in 1698, remains a significant major employer.|$|E

5|$|Banai is {{believed}} to the daughter of Indra, {{the king of the}} gods. Banai was found by Dhangar shepherd, when she was abandoned on earth by an angry Indra. When Banai grew up, it was predicted that she would get her match at Jejuri. There, she felt in love with God Khandoba. Khandoba also fell in her love. Khandoba accepted a self-exile for 12 years by intentionally losing a game of chess(Saripat) to his wife Mhalsa. He took disguise of shepherd and started serving Banai's father. One day, Khandoba killed all the sheep and goats of Banai' father and promised to make them alive again if he was married to Banai. The reluctant Banai was married to Khandoba, <b>the</b> <b>shepherd</b> in disguise at Naldurg. Khandoba revealed his real form to Banai on their way back to Jejuri.|$|E
5|$|Florindo {{opens with}} {{celebrations}} to mark Apollo's {{victory over the}} dragon Python. Apollo boasts that he is more proficient with the bow than Cupid. This offends the latter, who mischievously wounds Apollo with a drugged arrow which causes him {{to fall in love}} with Daphne. She, however, has pledged her love for Florindo, who is at the centre of a complex tangle of infatuations: he is secretly loved by Alfirena and more openly by the scheming shepherdess Lycoris, who in turn is the object of <b>the</b> <b>shepherd</b> Damon's desires. The various would-be lovers are consoled or advised by Damon's friend Thyrsis, and by the ageing nymph Galathea, who has herself not quite given up on love, though her advances to Thyrsis are rejected. Daphne and Florindo prepare to marry, but Apollo remains hopeful and continues his suit. Lycoris is prepared to await the outcome of events, but Damon, Galathea and Alfirena are in despair, as the opera ends with another spectacular celebration in honour of Apollo.|$|E
5|$|Kent is {{the centre}} of hop-growing in England, being centred on nearby Canterbury and Faversham has been the home of several breweries. <b>The</b> <b>Shepherd</b> Neame Brewery was officially founded in 1698, though brewing {{activities}} in Faversham pre-date this. The brewery {{claims to be the}} oldest in Britain and continues to be family-owned. The Rigden brewery was founded in the early 18th century by Edward Rigden. It subsequently merged with the Canterbury-based George Beer in 1922 to become George Beer & Rigden before being purchased by the Maidstone based Fremlin's. Whitbread bought out Fremlin's in 1967, and closed the Faversham brewery in 1990. The site is now a Tesco superstore. Shepherd Neame remains a significant regional brewer despite a decline in consumption of traditional bitter beer, producing around 230,000 barrels a year. It now also makes India Pale Ale under licence. Lieutenant-General Sir Philip Neame, recipient of the Victoria Cross, was born in Faversham and a memorial to him was placed in the town centre in 2014.|$|E

5|$|The 1970s and 1980s saw a {{proliferation}} of recordings, many of live performances. Plácido Domingo first recorded Cavaradossi in 1973, and continued to do so at regular intervals until 1994. In 1976 he was joined by his son, Plácido Domingo Jr., who sang <b>the</b> <b>shepherd</b> boy's song in a British recording with the New Philharmonia Orchestra. More recent commended recordings have included Antonio Pappano's 2000 Royal Opera House version with Angela Gheorghiu, Roberto Alagna and Ruggero Raimondi. Recordings of Tosca in languages other than Italian are rare but not unknown; over the years versions in French, German, Spanish, Hungarian and Russian have been issued. An admired English language version was released in 1995 in which David Parry led the Philharmonia Orchestra and a largely British cast. Since the late 1990s numerous video recordings of the opera have been issued on DVD and Blu-ray disc (BD). These include recent productions and remastered versions of historic performances.|$|E

5|$|The {{first record}} of Auriga's stars was in Mesopotamia as a {{constellation}} called GAM, representing a scimitar or crook. However, {{this may have}} represented just Capella (Alpha Aurigae) or the modern constellation as a whole; this figure was alternatively called Gamlum or MUL.GAM in the MUL.APIN. The crook of Auriga stood for a goat-herd or shepherd. It was formed {{from most of the}} stars of the modern constellation; all of the bright stars were included except for Elnath, traditionally assigned to both Taurus and Auriga. Later, Bedouin astronomers created constellations that were groups of animals, where each star represented one animal. The stars of Auriga comprised a herd of goats, an association also present in Greek mythology. The association with goats carried into the Greek astronomical tradition, though it later became associated with a charioteer along with <b>the</b> <b>shepherd.</b>|$|E
50|$|Several Support Services {{are offered}} through <b>the</b> <b>Shepherds</b> of Good Hope for the {{underprivileged}} of Ottawa.

50|$|The {{first part}} (for Christmas Day) {{describes}} the Birth of Jesus, the second (for December 26) the annunciation to <b>the</b> <b>shepherds,</b> <b>the</b> third (for December 27) the adoration of <b>the</b> <b>shepherds,</b> <b>the</b> fourth (for New Year's Day) the circumcision and naming of Jesus, the fifth (for the first Sunday after New Year) {{the journey of}} the Magi, and the sixth (for Epiphany) the adoration of the Magi.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the Board of Management is the Team of Volunteers who {{critical to the success}} of <b>the</b> <b>Shepherds</b> of Good Hope. In 2008, 64,000 hours of work were contributed by over 400 volunteers for <b>the</b> <b>Shepherds</b> of Good Hope. Each individual is asked to provide one 4 hour shift per week for 6 months. Additionally, clients of <b>the</b> <b>Shepherds</b> of Good Hope put in over 7000 hours of volunteering around the shelter. This client-based service encourages clients to develop skills that could lead to future job skills. Volunteer tasks are performed around the premises and include working in the Clothing Room, Drop-In Centre, Soup Kitchen, shelters and residences, and Women Stabilization Program as well as helping to put together Christmas Hampers. Clients of <b>the</b> <b>Shepherds</b> of Good Hope are also encouraged to help out in the Soup Kitchen and shelter. Certain volunteers offer their services in their specialization to <b>the</b> <b>Shepherds.</b> These include barbers, cooks, beauticians, musicians, and yoga instructors.|$|R
5|$|The {{portion of}} the codex held by the British Library {{consists}} of 346½ folios, 694 pages (38.1cm x 34.5cm), constituting {{over half of the}} original work. Of these folios, 199 belong to the Old Testament, including the apocrypha (deuterocanonical), and 147½ belong to the New Testament, along with two other books, the Epistle of Barnabas and part of <b>The</b> <b>Shepherd</b> of Hermas. The apocryphal books present in the surviving part of the Septuagint are 2 Esdras, Tobit, Judith, 1 and 4 Maccabees, Wisdom, and Sirach. The books of the New Testament are arranged in this order: the four Gospels, the epistles of Paul (Hebrews follows 2 Thess.), the Acts of the Apostles, the General Epistles, and the Book of Revelation. The fact that some parts of the codex are preserved in good condition while others are in very poor condition implies they were separated and stored in several places.|$|E
5|$|The λ {{ring was}} one of two rings {{discovered}} by Voyager 2 in 1986. It is a narrow, faint ring located just inside the ε ring, between it and <b>the</b> <b>shepherd</b> moon Cordelia. This moon clears a dark lane just inside the λ ring. When viewed in back-scattered light, the λ ring is extremely narrow—about 1–2km—and has the equivalent optical depth 0.1–0.2km at the wavelength 2.2μm. The normal optical depth is 0.1–0.2. The optical depth of the λ ring shows strong wavelength dependence, which is atypical for the Uranian ring system. The equivalent depth is as high as 0.36km in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum, which explains why λ ring was initially detected only in UV stellar occultations by Voyager 2. The detection during a stellar occultation at the wavelength 2.2μm was only announced in 1996.|$|E
5|$|Following this, the Cliffords began {{spending}} more time at their other castles, particularly Skipton Castle in Yorkshire. Brougham descended through several generations of Cliffords, intermittently serving as a residence. However, by 1592, {{it was in a}} state of disrepair, as George Clifford, 3rd Earl of Cumberland was {{spending more}} time in southern England due to his role as Queen's Champion. The castle was briefly restored in the early 17th century, to such an extent, that King James I of England was entertained there in 1617. In 1643, Lady Anne Clifford inherited the estates, including the castles of Brougham, Appleby, and Brough, and set about restoring them. Brougham Castle was kept in good condition for a short time, after Lady Anne's death in 1676; however, Thomas Tufton, 6th Earl of Thanet, who had inherited the Clifford estates, sold the furnishings in 1714. The empty shell was left to decay, as it was too costly to maintain. As a ruin, Brougham Castle inspired a painting by J. M. W. Turner, and was mentioned at the start of William Wordsworth's poem The Prelude, as well as becoming the subject of Wordsworth's Song at the Feast of Brougham Castle upon the Restoration of Lord Clifford, <b>the</b> <b>Shepherd,</b> to the Estates and Honours of his Ancestors. The castle was left to the Ministry of Works, in the 1930s, and is today maintained by its successor, English Heritage.|$|E
