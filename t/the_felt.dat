40|$|It is {{important}} to understand the different types of house museums and their purposes before we offer information about our own house museum. There are three basic types of house museums: Documentary, Representative, Decorative. Each type has its purpose and distinct interpretive thrust. Having very little information about <b>the</b> <b>Felts</b> family, it is impossible to present our museum as <b>the</b> documentary <b>Felts</b> House. A much more realistic interpretive goal is as a representative 1815 Log House. We have used what little bits of information we have about <b>the</b> <b>Felts</b> family, and <b>the</b> rest of our interpretation is taken from the letters, journals, inventories, objects, or other documents from their neighbors.

5|$|Using {{a similar}} strategy, S. D. Malone and S. Bor {{analyzed}} the known intensities for the 1872 shock, then compared intensity patterns {{for a number}} of instrumentally recorded earthquakes that also occurred in the Pacific Northwest. A factor that was taken into consideration was that for earthquakes that have either circular or slightly elliptical isoseismal maps, the epicenter is usually close {{to the center of the}} pattern, but that for shocks where instrumental information are also available, the epicenter is sometimes not where it would have been assumed to be, had only the intensity information (and no instrumental information) been available. An isoseismal map of the 1949 Olympia earthquake was presented as an example of a distorted or convoluted pattern that was attributed to local geological conditions that either attenuated or amplified the seismic waves, and it was emphasized that not taking into account these local features could lead to a misinterpretation of <b>the</b> <b>felt</b> intensities and to a misplaced epicenter.|$|E

25|$|During the 1840s, <b>the</b> <b>felt</b> hat {{industry}} {{went into}} depression; the recession affected Denton, with wages {{in the area}} falling by 35% and only 12 hat manufacturers remaining in Denton. The depression was partially due to changes in fashion away from felt towards silk hats. The revitalisation of <b>the</b> <b>felt</b> hat industry came in the 1850s, once again on a whim of fashion but also {{the increased use of}} machinery led to reduced production costs. The resurgence was demonstrated by the doubling of the number of hat manufacturers in the town between 1861 and 1872. At its peak in the Edwardian period, Denton's felt hat industry was the largest felt hat manufacturing centre in Britain. There were 36 firms directly involved in <b>the</b> <b>felt</b> hat making industry. In 1907 the majority of the 16,428,000 felt hats made in England (worth £2,068,000) were made in Denton and Stockport. In 1921, the working population of Denton was 9,653 with about 41% of those people in occupations related to the hatting industry. The last hat factory in Denton closed in 1980.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>felting</b> {{propensity}} of different animal fibers, particularly alpaca and wool, has been examined. <b>The</b> Aachen <b>felting</b> test method was employed. 1 g {{of each type}} of fiber was soaked in 50 ml of wetting solution and agitated in a dyeing machine to make <b>felt</b> balls. <b>The</b> diameter of each ball was measured in nine directions and the ball density was calculated in g/cm 3; the higher the density value of the ball, the higher the feltability of the fibers. The effects of fiber diameter and fiber length on <b>the</b> <b>felting</b> {{propensity of}} these fibers were investigated. The results show that <b>the</b> alpaca fibers <b>felt</b> to a higher degree than wool fibers, and short and fine cashmere fibers have lower felting propensity than wool fibers at a similar diameter range. There is a higher tendency of felting for bleached and dyed alpaca fibers than for untreated fibers. Fiber length has a remarkable influence on the propensity of fiber felting. Cotton and nylon fibers were also tested for felting propensity to verify the mechanism responsible for <b>the</b> different fiber <b>felting</b> behavior. <br /...|$|R

25|$|Although <b>the</b> <b>felt</b> hat {{industry}} in Denton and Haughton was prosperous and {{an integral part}} of the town, working conditions in the factories were not risk free.

Inadequate ventilation in some parts of the hat making process led to other sorts of dangers; solvents were also used and on 14 January 1901 there was an explosion at the factory of Joseph Wilson & Sons in Denton, killing 13 people and injuring many more. The explosion was of vapour from methylated spirits used in the dying process.|$|E
