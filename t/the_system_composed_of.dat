The fortress, although the ramparts are reminiscent of Moorish castles, was built by the Christian king of Castile, Sancho IV {{in the thirteenth century}} replacing a much smaller fortress which had been built earlier by the Muslim rulers of Andalucía. The Muslim structure is thought to have been built on top a much early Roman fortification. The castle was part of a defence system built to protect the city of Seville from the Portuguese. This defence system was called the Banda Gallega or The Galician Band. <b>The</b> <b>system</b> <b>composed</b> <b>of</b> three lines of defence, which mostly utilized older Moorish fortresses.

50|$|When {{a pair of}} {{electrodes}} are {{immersed in}} the growth medium, <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>composed</b> <b>of</b> electrodes and electrolyte can be modeled with the electrical circuit of Fig. 1, where Rm and Cm are the resistance and capacitance of the bulk medium, while Ri and Ci are the resistance and capacitance of the electrode-electrolyte interface. However, when frequency of the sinusoidal test signal applied to the electrodes is relatively low (lower than 1 MHz) the bulk capacitance Cm can be neglected and the system can be modeled with a simpler circuit consisting only of a resistance Rs and a capacitance Cs in series. The resistance Rs accounts for the electrical conductivity of the bulk medium while the capacitance Cs {{is due to the}} capacitive double-layer at the electrode-electrolyte interface. During the growth phase, bacterial metabolism transforms uncharged or weakly charged compounds of the bulk medium in highly charged compounds that change the electrical properties of the medium. This results in a decrease of resistance Rs and an increase of capacitance Cs.|$|E
