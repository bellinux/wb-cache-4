5|$|Every {{game that}} has been {{produced}} in the WWE 2K series is developed by Yuke's and Visual Concepts, and published by 2K Sports. From 1999 – 2013 the publisher was THQ.

Before the release of WWE SmackDown! vs. Raw, the only communication possible in season mode was through subtitles. Voice over, however, was included in season mode {{with the release of}} WWE SmackDown! vs. RAW. WWE superstars record a script, which is then assigned to <b>the</b> <b>voice</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> corresponding superstar in the game. With the exception of WWE SmackDown! Here Comes the Pain, pre-recorded commentary by WWE commentators has been included in each game since the release of WWF SmackDown! Just Bring It.|$|E
5|$|Ferb was {{originally}} {{going to be}} voiced by actor Mitchel Musso.

Sangster himself is a British actor and was among several cast members hired that hailed from England. Marsh himself {{had lived in the}} country for seven years and developed a fondness for the culture and people.|$|E

Production of the long-lived VOTT continued into the 1990s.|$|E
