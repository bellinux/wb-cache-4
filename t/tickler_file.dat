5000|$|A <b>tickler</b> <b>file</b> or 43 Folders System is a {{collection}} of date-labeled file folders organized in a way that allows time-sensitive documents to be filed according to the future date on which each document needs action. Documents within the folders of a <b>tickler</b> <b>file</b> can be to-do lists, pending bills, unpaid invoices, travel tickets, hotel reservations, meeting information, birthday reminders, coupons, claim tickets, call-back notes, follow-up reminders, maintenance reminders, or any other papers that require future action. Each day, the folder having the current date is retrieved from the <b>tickler</b> <b>file</b> so that any documents within it may be acted on. Essentially, a <b>tickler</b> <b>file</b> provides a way to send a reminder to oneself in the future - [...] "tickling" [...] one's memory.|$|E

50|$|More {{recently}} {{the concept was}} re-introduced to popular culture through various self-help books as Pam Young and Peggy Jones' 1977 book Sidetracked Home Executives: From Pig-Pen to Paradise, FlyLady Marla Ciley, Chris Crouch's book Getting Organized, David Allen's 2002 book Getting Things Done, and Merlin Mann's website 43 Folders, whose name comes from one popular method for maintaining a <b>tickler</b> <b>file.</b>|$|E

5000|$|In larger {{institutional}} uses, a <b>tickler</b> <b>file</b> {{would be}} chronological, with one section {{for each year}} or day, sometimes encompassing {{more than a century}} in as much detail as appropriate (especially for dates far in the future). A more common technique is to have index cards with forty-three dividers or a system with forty-three folders or two accordion files. The forty-three divisions come from the sum of two numbers, thirty-one and twelve, corresponding to the maximum thirty-one days in a Gregorian or Julian month and the twelve months in a year.|$|E
50|$|Because of {{its overall}} design, the Franklin Planner system {{lends itself to}} use as a <b>tickler</b> <b>file,</b> as well as a {{long-range}} planner. Most annual versions of the page inserts for the Franklin system include yearly calendars for at least five years; future monthly calendars for at least three years; and then the current year's pages and associated monthly calendars for planning. When used as a total package, the system provides a means of tracking minute details; storage of signed agreements (especially if pages are archived in the archival binders); and tracking of business and personal expenses for taxes.|$|E
40|$|An {{effective}} office {{organization for}} screening and follow-up of hypertensives can be simple. The physician must first adopt {{a policy of}} regularly taking blood pressures of patients who attend for any reason. Notations {{on the outside of}} the chart are a visible record and reminder. A <b>tickler</b> <b>file</b> with 12 monthly divisions provides an efficient follow-up system. There are no ethical barriers to instituting this approach...|$|E
