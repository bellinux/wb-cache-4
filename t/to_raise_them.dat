5|$|As they {{evolved from}} lunged fish, {{amphibians}} {{had to make}} certain adaptations for living on land, including {{the need to develop}} new means of locomotion. In the water, the sideways thrusts of their tails had propelled them forward, but on land, quite different mechanisms were required. Their vertebral columns, limbs, limb girdles and musculature needed to be strong enough <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>them</b> off the ground for locomotion and feeding. Terrestrial adults discarded their lateral line systems and adapted their sensory systems to receive stimuli via the medium of the air. They needed to develop new methods to regulate their body heat to cope with fluctuations in ambient temperature. They developed behaviours suitable for reproduction in a terrestrial environment. Their skins were exposed to harmful ultraviolet rays that had previously been absorbed by the water. The skin changed to become more protective and prevent excessive water loss.|$|E
5|$|The Doctor's Carriage is a 1910 American silent short drama {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. The plot is a melodrama that features Marie Eline in the starring role. The film begins with Max, an old musician who has two daughters, {{one of whom is}} blind. Max becomes ill and dies and without a mother <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>them,</b> the younger daughter cares for her older sister, but they are homeless and poor. The little girl begs a doctor to restore her sister's vision and he proposes to her. The film was released on September 9, 1910 and was met with praise from reviewers. The film saw a wide national release and was also shown in Canada, Britain and Australia. The film is presumed lost.|$|E
25|$|The Mauryas firstly {{looked at}} forests as resources. For them, the most {{important}} forest product was the elephant. Military might in those times depended not only upon horses and men but also battle-elephants; these {{played a role in}} the defeat of Seleucus, one of Alexander's former generals. The Mauryas sought to preserve supplies of elephants since it was cheaper and took less time to catch, tame and train wild elephants than <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>them.</b> Kautilya's Arthashastra contains not only maxims on ancient statecraft, but also unambiguously specifies the responsibilities of officials such as the Protector of the Elephant Forests.|$|E

25|$|In 1983, the {{majority}} of Japanese national students within Greater New York City attended U.S. schools. To have education in the Japanese language and Japanese literature, they attend the weekend classes offered by the Japanese Weekend School of New York. The parents who select the weekend school and local school combination often wish {{to raise their children}} as international and connected to foreign cultures, while parents choosing the Japanese day schools wish <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>them</b> as typical Japanese children.

25|$|In mid June 1940, however, {{following}} the lightning {{advance of the}} Germans through France and the subsequent Dunkirk evacuation, the British War Office put out a call for volunteers to carry out raids along the coasts of the occupied territories and Durnford-Slater was able to convince his commanding officer to recommend him for the special force that was being raised to do this. Shortly afterwards {{he was given a}} brevet promotion to lieutenant colonel and given orders to begin raising and recruiting No. 3 Commando. Although designated No. 3 Commando, No.1 and No. 2 did not exist at the time—the intention being <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>them</b> as airborne units later—and as such Durnford-Slater's unit was the first commando unit raised during the war and Durnford-Slater is considered to be the first British commando of the war.|$|E
25|$|To {{cope with}} the {{shortage}} of qualified teachers, the State Education Commission decreed in 1985 that senior-middle-school teachers should be graduates with two years' training in professional institutes and that primary-school teachers should be graduates of secondary schools. To improve teacher quality, the commission established full-time and part-time (the latter preferred because it was less costly) in-service training programs. Primary-school and preschool in-service teacher training programs devoted 84 {{percent of the time}} to subject teaching, 6 percent to pedagogy and psychology, and 10 percent to teaching methods. In-service training for primary-school teachers was designed <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>them</b> to a level of approximately two years' postsecondary study, with the goal of qualifying most primary-school teachers by 1990. Secondary-school in-service teacher training was based on a unified model, tailored to meet local conditions, and offered on a spare-time basis. Ninety-five percent of its curricula was devoted to subject teaching, 2 to 3 percent to pedagogy and psychology, and 2 to 3 percent to teaching methods. There was no similar large-scale in-service effort for technical and vocational teachers, most of whom worked for enterprises and local authorities.|$|E

500|$|The first in-game {{year will}} usually consist of kobold thieves and goblin snatchers trying to {{infiltrate}} the fortress. Thieves try to steal valuables while snatchers try to kidnap dwarven children <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>them</b> as future soldiers. Goblin and kobold civilizations near the fortress {{will always be}} hostile {{and a source of}} frequent attacks. Wildlife is usually harmless, but depending on the fortress location, more fierce elephants, bears, unicorns, giant spiders and wolves may be a threat. Wealthier and more populated fortresses will get ambushes and sieges from neighboring goblin (or other enemy) civilization. A thriving fortress will attract certain mega-beasts like hydras, titans or dragons, and randomly generated creatures called [...] "Forgotten Beasts". These unique creatures have randomized physical qualities and abilities, thus making them have the potential to be very powerful. Undead attack mainly in evil biomes or if the player embarks with a Necromancer Tower being near the site. Undead are harder to kill, and often reanimate once they are defeated with their body parts being separate units to fight.|$|E

500|$|Throughout the series, Homer and Lisa's {{relationship}} is problematic, as Homer often struggles to understand Lisa, who {{in many ways}} is a little girl but who is also smarter than him. Karma Waltonen and Denise Du Vernay analyzed [...] "Make Room for Lisa" [...] in their book The Simpsons in the classroom: Embiggening the Learning Experience with the Wisdom of Springfield. They wrote that in the episode, Homer and Lisa's {{relationship is}} badly damaged after Homer allows Lisa's room to {{be turned into a}} cell phone tower. When the two enter sensory-deprivation tanks, Lisa has several hallucinations, including one in which she becomes Homer. This experience shows Lisa how she appears from Homer's point of view, and makes her realize that her treatment of Homer is hurtful, as he often participates in activities with her that he does not enjoy. The episode ends with Homer and Lisa watching a demolition derby, which Lisa enjoys because she is spending time with Homer.

500|$|Their {{grandmother}} preferred <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>them</b> simply, {{and they}} made their own clothes. A new governess from Switzerland, Madame Gelieux, was appointed, giving the children lessons in French; as was common for royal and aristocratic children of the time, Louise became fluent and literate in the language, while neglecting her own native German. She received religious instruction from a clergyman of the Lutheran Church. Complementary to her lessons was an emphasis on charitable acts, and Louise would often accompany her governess when visiting the houses {{of the poor and}} needy. Louise was encouraged to give out as much as was in her means, although she often got into trouble with her grandmother for donating too much for charity. From the age of ten until her marriage at 17, Louise spent most of her time in the presence of her grandmother and governess, both well-educated and refined. When only nine years old, Louise was present when the poet Friedrich Schiller read from the first act of [...] "Don Carlos" [...] for the entertainment of the assembled court, thus sparking her love for German as a literary language, especially works of Schiller. Louise loved history and poetry, and not only enjoyed reading Schiller, but also came to like the works of Goethe, Paul, Herder and Shakespeare, as well as ancient Greek tragedies.|$|E
500|$|Despite his setback, {{relations}} between Ibn al-Ash'ath and al-Hajjaj were friendly initially, and al-Hajjaj's son married one of Ibn al-Ash'ath's sisters. Gradually, however, {{the two men}} became estranged. The sources attribute this to Ibn al-Ash'ath's overweening pride {{as one of the}} foremost of the ashrāf, the tribal nobility, and his aspirations to leadership: al-Mas'udi records that he adopted the title of Nāṣir al-muʾminīn ("Helper of the Faithful"), an implicit challenge to the Umayyads, who were implied to be false believers. In addition, he claimed to be the Qaḥṭānī, a messianic figure in South Arab (Yamani) tribal tradition who was expected <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> <b>them</b> to domination. Ibn al-Ash'ath's pretensions irked al-Hajjaj, whose hostile remarks—such as [...] "Look how he walks! How I should like to cut off his head!"—were conveyed to Ibn al-Ash'ath and served to deepen their hostility to outright mutual hatred. According to L. Veccia Vaglieri, however, these reports are more indicative of the Arabic sources' tendency to [...] "explain historical events by incidents relating to persons", rather than the actual relationship between the two men, especially given the fact that Ibn al-Ash'ath faithfully served al-Hajjaj in a number of posts, culminating in his appointment to lead the [...] "Peacock Army". Nevertheless, it is clear that al-Hajjaj quickly became unpopular among the Iraqis in general through a series of measures that, according to Hugh N. Kennedy, [...] " [...] almost to have goaded the Iraqis into rebellion", such as the introduction of Syrian troops—the mainstay of the Umayyad dynasty—into Iraq, the use of Iraqi troops in the arduous and unrewarding campaigns against the Kharijites, and the reduction of the Iraqi troops' pay to a level below that of the Syrian troops.|$|E

2500|$|Girls with {{congenital}} adrenal hyperplasia (an {{autosomal recessive}} condition {{which results in}} high androgen levels during fetal development) have more masculinized sex role identities {{and are more likely}} to have a homosexual sexual orientation as adults than controls.
