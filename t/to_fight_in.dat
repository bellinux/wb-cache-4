He showed his intent to conquer {{the entirety of the}} Persian Empire by throwing a spear into Asian soil and saying he accepted Asia as a gift from the gods. This also showed Alexander's eagerness <b>to</b> <b>fight,</b> <b>in</b> contrast to his father's preference for diplomacy.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the motivations}} of those Australian's that volunteered <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> <b>in</b> Russia {{can only be}} guessed at, it seems {{unlikely}} to have been political. Regardless, they confirmed a reputation for audacity and courage, winning the only two Victoria Crosses of the land campaign, despite their small numbers. Yet Australian involvement was barely noticed at home {{at the time and}} made little difference to the outcome of the war. Total casualties included 10 killed and 40 wounded, with most deaths being from disease during operations in Mesopotamia.|$|E
5|$|An Army report {{released}} in 2001 blamed {{the breakdown of}} the 65th on the following factors: a shortage of officers and noncommissioned officers, a rotation policy that removed combat-experienced leaders and soldiers, tactics that led to high casualties, an ammunition shortage, communication problems between largely white, English-speaking officers and Spanish-speaking Puerto Rican enlisted men, and declining morale. The report also found bias in the prosecution of the Puerto Ricans, citing instances of continental soldiers who were not charged after refusing <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> <b>in</b> similar circumstances, before and after Jackson Heights.|$|E

5|$|An {{additional}} consideration for Napoleon {{was that a}} French victory might cause French speaking sympathisers in Belgium to launch a friendly revolution.

5|$|Around 60,000 former Czar's army troopers {{remained}} {{stationed in}} Finland in January 1918. The soldiers were demoralized and war-weary, and the home-sick, former serfs were thirsty for farmland set free by the revolutions. The {{majority of the}} troops returned to Russia {{by the end of}} March 1918. In total 7,000 to 10,000 Red Russian warmen supported the Finnish Reds, but around 4,000, in separate smaller units of 100–1,000 soldiers, could be persuaded <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> <b>in</b> the front line.|$|E

5|$|Because of {{the smoke}} the commanders of the second line of Polish {{outposts}} {{could not see the}} approaching Russians and did not open fire. Contrary to the battle plan, the second line did not send reinforcements to the first. This was particularly important in the case of Forts 54 and 56, as they had to face the enemy alone, without the support of Forts 21, 22 and 23 behind them. The most important positions in the suburb of Wola received only token reinforcements from the main reserve and were forced <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> <b>in</b> isolation.|$|E

5|$|Director Mitsuo Fukuda {{stated that}} {{initially}} {{the story of}} Gundam SEED was written from Kira's point of view. Kira's personality and thought process were derived from what Fukuda considered to be Japanese people's thoughts. He said that his story was about his forced wish <b>to</b> <b>fight,</b> <b>in</b> contrast to Shinn Asuka who was not reluctant <b>to</b> <b>fight</b> <b>in</b> Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny. In retrospective, Fukuda emphasized a contrast between both Kira's and Shinn's characters to the point both were the opposite of each other regarding their opinions; Kira's development was easier to script. Fukuda said that as both Kira's and Shinn's characters as were similar, they were easy to voice. An official guidebook to the series made an official count {{of the number of}} times Kira cried in Gundam SEED by the time the book was released. He was said to have cried over ten times, and thus a comical message of support was made towards him.|$|E
