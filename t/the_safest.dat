40|$|The flight {{envelope}} {{can be viewed}} as a set within the state space of an aircraft. For various safety considerations an aircraft is required to remain within its prescribed {{flight envelope}}. <b>The</b> <b>safe</b> set is <b>the</b> largest controlled invariant set within the flight envelope. Thus, if an aircraft is to remain within its envelope it must stay within <b>the</b> <b>safe</b> set. When an aircraft is impaired, e. g., a jammed elevator or an engine loss, <b>the</b> <b>safe</b> set shrinks as would be expected. In this paper we consider strategies to prevent the aircraft from departing <b>the</b> <b>safe</b> set- <b>the</b> envelope protection problem- and strategies to restore the aircraft to a desired trim point within <b>the</b> <b>safe</b> set should it find itself outside <b>the</b> <b>safe</b> set- <b>the</b> envelope restoration problem. Note that an aircraft may be driven outside of <b>the</b> <b>safe</b> set by a disturbance, a loss-of-control incident, or by a component failure in which <b>the</b> <b>safe</b> set shrinks. <b>The</b> problems of envelope protection and restoration are substantially different. Envelope protection requires avoiding close proximity to certain critical boundary segments of <b>the</b> <b>safe</b> set. Restoration is more straightforward involving steering the aircraft to a target trim condition along trajectories that minimize the excursion from the flight envelope. Precise formulations of both problems will be given and alternative solutions will be compared. Examples are given using a model derived from the the longitudina...|$|R

5|$|During {{the race}} to develop an oral polio vaccine several large scale human trials were undertaken. By 1958, the National Institutes of Health had {{determined}} that OPV produced using the Sabin strains were <b>the</b> <b>safest.</b> Between 1957 and 1960, however, Hilary Koprowski continued to administer his vaccine around the world. In Africa, the vaccines were administered to roughly one {{million people in the}} Belgian territories (now the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Rwanda and Burundi). The results of these human trials have been controversial, and unfounded accusations in the 1990s arose that the vaccine had created the conditions necessary for transmission of SIV from chimpanzees to humans, causing HIV/AIDS. These hypotheses have, however, have been conclusively refuted. By 2004, cases of poliomyelitis in Africa had been reduced to just a small number of isolated regions in the western portion of the continent, with sporadic cases elsewhere. Recent local opposition to vaccination campaigns have evolved due to lack of adequate information, often relating to fears that the vaccine might induce sterility. The disease has since resurged in Nigeria and in several other African nations without necessary information, which epidemiologists believe is due to refusals by certain local populations to allow their children to receive the polio vaccine.|$|E
