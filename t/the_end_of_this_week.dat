2500|$|These {{meals and}} {{meetings}} are an opportunity {{both for the}} prefrosh {{to get to know}} the feel of the different houses and for the upperclassmen to meet and rate the prefrosh so both can see where they might belong. [...] Many Houses also show house-made videos to the prefrosh, which yield the prefrosh additional information about the various personalities of the Houses. [...] At <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>week,</b> the frosh rate each of the 8 Houses on a scale of 1 to 20. Based on this, and the opinions of the Houses' existing members, the prefrosh are placed into a House which will be their home physically and socially for the next few years. The InterHouse Committee attempts to ensure a certain level of secrecy regarding the exact process, so that the confidentiality of both the freshmen, and those involved with their final housing assignments, is maintained. [...] Also, the selection process is constrained: [...] there are only a limited number of openings in each House, and it is impossible to simultaneously meet the preferences of all of the Freshmen and Houses.|$|E

He named it after his old ship, and passed several days on it. On describing its appearance, and its bearings from the place where they then were, Mark had no doubt it was the island that was visible from the peak near them, and at which he had been gazing that very afternoon, for fully an hour with longing eyes. On describing its form to Bob, the latter coincided in this opinion, which was in fact the true one.|$|E

60|$|My dear Brown--I {{ought to}} be off at <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>week,</b> as the cold winds begin to blow towards evening;--but I will wait till I have your answer to this. I am to be introduced, before I set out, to a Dr. Clark, a {{physician}} settled at Rome, who promises to befriend me in every way there. The sale of my book is very slow, though {{it has been very}} highly rated. One of the causes, I understand from different quarters, of the unpopularity of this new book, is the offence the ladies take at me. On thinking that matter over, I am certain that I have said nothing in a spirit to displease any woman I would care to please; but still {{there is a tendency to}} class women in my books with roses and sweetmeats,--they never see themselves dominant. I will say no more, but, waiting in anxiety for your answer, doff my hat, and make a purse as long as I can.|$|E
60|$|By <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>week</b> {{the town}} had already settled down to the routine of the siege. General Joubert, with the chivalry which had always {{distinguished}} him, had permitted the garrison to send out the non-combatants to a place called Intombi Camp (promptly named Funkersdorp by the facetious) where they were safe from the shells, though the burden of their support still fell of course upon the much-tried commissariat. The hale and male of the townsfolk refused {{for the most part}} to avoid the common danger, and clung tenaciously to their shot-torn village. Fortunately the river has worn down its banks until it runs through a deep channel, in the sides of which it was found to be possible to hollow out caves which were practically bomb-proof. Here for some months the townsfolk led a troglodytic existence, returning to their homes upon that much appreciated seventh day of rest which was granted to them by their Sabbatarian besiegers.|$|E

60|$|Washington, June 14, 1864. DEAREST MOTHER. I am {{not feeling}} very well these days--the doctors {{have told me}} not to come inside the {{hospitals}} for the present. I send there by a friend every day; I send things and aid to some cases I know, and hear from there also, but I do not go myself at present. It is probable that the hospital poison has affected my system, and I find it worse than I calculated. I have spells of faintness and very bad feeling in my head, fullness and pain--and besides sore throat. My boarding place, 502 Pennsylvania av., is a miserable place, very bad air. But I shall feel better soon, I know--the doctors say it will pass over--they have long told me I was going in too strong. Some days I think it has all gone and I feel well again, but in a few hours I have a spell again. Mother, I have not heard anything of the 51st. I sent George's letter to Han. I have written to George since. I shall write again to him in a day or two. If Mary comes home, tell her I sent her my love. If I don't feel better before <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>week</b> or beginning of next, I may come home for a week or fortnight for a change. The rumor is very strong here that Grant is over the James river on south side--but it is not in the papers. We are having quite cool weather here. Mother, I want to see you and Jeff so much. I have been working a little at copying, but have stopt it lately.|$|E
