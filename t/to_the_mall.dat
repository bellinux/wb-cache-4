5|$|Brian takes Stewie <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mall,</b> {{only to get}} a rude brush-off {{from the}} Santa who works there when he leaves for the night. As a result, Stewie vows to kill Santa for blowing him off and forces Brian {{to take him to}} the North Pole. Attempting to trick Stewie, he brings him to a Santa's Village {{amusement}} park. Soon discovering the charade, Stewie threatens to shoot Brian if he does not take him to the real North Pole.|$|E
5|$|Candace {{discovers the}} boy's circus and has {{set out to}} tell their mother, Linda, when Jeremy, a boy who has romantic {{feelings}} for her, stops by {{to give her a}} basket of plants. Unfortunately they include some wild parsnips, which give Candace an allergic reaction: to hide her hives and deep, scratchy voice she dons a sweatsuit and a paper bag before going <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mall</b> to tell Linda about the boys' plans, and then sings E.V.I.L. B.O.Y.S. where Linda, Vivian Garcia-Shapiro, and Jeremy's mom are.|$|E
5|$|Merle Hay Plaza was {{enclosed}} in 1972 and became Merle Hay Mall. Two years later, as Valley West Mall and Southridge Mall were under construction, Merle Hay Mall completed a major westward expansion that doubled {{the size of}} the mall. Two additional anchors, Montgomery Ward (which also moved from downtown) and Younkers Store for Homes, were added <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mall</b> as part of that expansion. By 2000, Merle Hay Mall attracted an average of 35,000 shoppers per day.|$|E

2500|$|Rideau Centre, Ottawa, Ontario: Prior to its {{construction}} in 19811982, Ottawa's [...] "Rideau Centre" [...] project had {{been subject to}} many years of planning. [...] Prior <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mall's</b> opening, Eaton's attempted <b>to</b> rename <b>the</b> <b>mall</b> <b>the</b> [...] "Rideau Eaton Centre", but the chain was forced to back down due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> local outcry generated by the [...] "eleventh hour" [...] proposed name change. [...] Nonetheless, Eaton's added an [...] "E" [...] <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mall's</b> logo (although <b>the</b> letter has long since been removed).|$|R
50|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, Four Seasons Town Centre further renovated its {{interior}} {{with a dramatic}} redesign by Thompson, Ventulett, Stainback & Associates. This renovation added a large fountain and amphitheater <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mall's</b> center court. A number of permanent vendor spaces and kiosks were added <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mall's</b> large corridors, as well as living room-like soft seating areas.|$|R
5|$|Michael Scott (Steve Carell) {{initially}} makes {{light of}} the exposure incident. After being shamed by how offended the other employees are by his antics, he attempts to reassert his sensitivity to women by holding a seminar on women's issues. He closes the meeting by offering to take the women <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mall</b> at Steamtown. Before leaving, he receives a call from Jan Levinson (Melora Hardin), who asks {{to meet with him}} to have sex. Michael balks at the proposal, and only becomes more uncomfortable when she offers to pay him for the sex.|$|E
5|$|The 20-year-old newlywed {{was last}} seen at the Sawgrass Mills Mall where she worked at a {{sporting}} goods store. When she did not return home her husband went <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mall</b> and found her car, a 1985 Ford Tempo, with the tires slashed. It is believed that Chandler, after scoping out the victim {{over a couple of}} days, slashed the tires and showed up {{in the guise of a}} good samaritan and offered to help. Three hours after she was reported missing, her body was found under a residential mailbox, in a local neighborhood, by two men returning from a fishing trip.|$|E
5|$|At night, Ellie catches Riley {{attempting}} {{to sneak out}} of the school, and demands to accompany her. Riley reluctantly agrees, and the two make their way <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mall,</b> where they meet Riley's friend Winston. As Winston teaches Ellie how to ride a horse, Riley steals his radio, and discovers that an attack by the Fireflies—a rebel group opposing the quarantine zone authorities—has occurred nearby. Ellie and Riley {{make their way to}} the attack, and find that the Fireflies are wounded and outnumbered. To help, Ellie and Riley throw smoke grenades at the military, allowing the Fireflies to retreat safely. They are spotted by the military, and escape into a nearby alley, where they narrowly avoid being bitten by an Infected—zombie-like creatures infected by a mutated strain of the Cordyceps fungus.|$|E

5|$|Brian and Stewie go <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mall</b> so {{they can}} meet Santa, but Peter is asking Santa for gifts (he asks for a game of Uno, a Magna Doodle, a pet chink (a mix of a {{chinchilla}} and a mink) and a Charles in Charge lunchbox.) When the mall Santa leaves for the night and Brian demands that he let Stewie sit in his lap, Santa mentions he will be at Applebee's. Stewie says that Santa leaving before he {{got a chance to}} sit in his lap felt like a bigger betrayal than the betrayal of Gary Busey by reality; this takes us to Busey looking himself in the mirror asking his reflection, {{in the form of a}} crazed clown, how he is doing.|$|E
5|$|Construction on the Blue Line, {{which was}} {{initially}} {{known as the}} Hiawatha Line, began in 2001. The line opened in two phases in 2004, beginning with a 12-station stretch from the Warehouse District / Hennepin Avenue station through the Fort Snelling station in June. In December, five more stations were opened, continuing service south of Fort Snelling <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mall</b> of America station. Two additional Blue Line stations opened in late 2009: a new northern terminus at Target Field and the American Boulevard station in Bloomington. Construction on the Green Line, which was initially designated as the Central Corridor, began in 2010. The line opened in its entirety in June 2014.|$|E
5|$|Metro is {{a public}} {{transportation}} network consisting of light rail and bus rapid transit services covering the Minneapolis–Saint Paul metropolitan area. The light rail portion of the network, managed by Metro Transit, has 37 light rail stations in operation across two lines: the Blue Line, running from downtown Minneapolis <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mall</b> of America in Bloomington, Minnesota, and the Green Line, connecting downtown Minneapolis with downtown Saint Paul. In 2016, the Blue and Green lines respectively provided approximately 10.3 million and 12.7 million rides {{for a total of}} 23 million rides across both lines. By ridership, it is the ninth-largest light rail system in the United States.|$|E

5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>mall</b> also {{benefited from}} being <b>the</b> closest <b>mall</b> <b>to</b> rapidly growing Fort Bend County, {{which did not}} have its own mall during much of Westwood's existence, and whose own prosperous {{residents}} were critical <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mall's</b> survival.|$|R
5|$|Phineas and Ferb {{set out to}} {{convince}} the members of Love Händel - lead singer Danny, bassist Bobbi Fabulous, and drummer Swampy - to reform. Danny alone agrees immediately, with a song; the other two need convincing, through song as well. At the same time, Isabella and the Fireside Girls are starting the stage building. Lawrence, at the same time, tries to cater a small dinner and hires a singing telegram; unfortunately, the dinner catches fire, and Lawrence's hastily planned evening goes up in smoke. Phineas and Ferb arrive and assure Lawrence that all is well, explaining that the band has agreed to reform. Meanwhile, Candace continues keeping Linda {{away from the house}} by taking her <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mall</b> to try on some dresses.|$|E
5|$|The {{full-time}} side at {{the west}} end of the mezzanine has three street stairs. One leads to the northeast corner of Queens Boulevard and 59th Avenue, the closest <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mall.</b> The other two staircases are through a long passageway to both southern corners of Queens Boulevard and Woodhaven Boulevard, acting as a pedestrian underpass outside of fare control. These staircases date back to the station's original opening. There is an entrance to the southeast corner of Woodhaven and Queens Boulevards that, {{as a result of the}} construction of the Long Island Expressway in the mid-1950s, leads only to two entrance ramps to the expressway, with no continuous sidewalk leading to the entrance.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, York, Pennsylvania-based {{department}} store chain The Bon-Ton acquired the AM's chain, converting all outlets to The Bon-Ton. Later that year, on December 14, 17-year-old Cynthia Wiggins of Buffalo {{was struck by}} a dump truck while trying to get to her first day of work in the mall's food court from a NFTA Metro bus stop on Walden Avenue. The incident sparked allegations from Buffalo's African-American community that Pyramid did not want people from Buffalo's predominantly minority East Side to have easy access <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mall.</b> In settling a wrongful death claim against Walden Galleria and NFTA Metro and to prevent a boycott of the mall, the bus stop was soon moved to a point inside the mall, where it remains today. Bonwit Teller closed off its upper level in 1996 as part of the chain's restructuring, with Old Navy soon opening in the store's former upper level. By the end of the year, Bonwit Teller had closed the rest of its store as well, with the lower level becoming the area's first Bed Bath & Beyond store in 1997. Also in 1996, sporting apparel retailer Finish Line opened what was then one of its largest stores, in the space vacated by Filene's Basement two years previous.|$|E
50|$|On January 5, 2012, Macy's Inc. {{announced}} that <b>the</b> <b>mall's</b> Bloomingdale's store would close in March 2012. Bloomingdale's closed on March 14, 2012, {{and the building}} it occupied was demolished in 2013 prior <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mall's</b> closure.|$|R
5000|$|However, The Macerich Company {{acquired}} <b>the</b> <b>mall</b> in January 2008, therefore returning <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mall's</b> original name, [...] "The Shops at North Bridge." [...] It is Macerich's first mall in Illinois, in {{an effort}} to acquire high-end retail malls.|$|R
5000|$|Prior <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mall's</b> closing, {{there were}} plans to create [...] "Mall TV" [...] to provide {{original}} programming for mall patrons. In addition, several firms {{were brought in}} to provide entertainment for mall patrons such as live radio broadcasting, stage plays, town hall meetings, fashion shows, and others. These events brought small numbers and some attention - but not enough <b>to</b> sustain <b>the</b> <b>mall.</b>|$|R
25|$|Work was {{completed}} on an extension <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mall</b> Shopping Centre facing St George's Square, {{the largest of}} the new units to was taken by TK Maxx. Planning applications for a much larger extension <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mall</b> Arndale Shopping Centre (In the Northern Gateway area – Bute Street, Silver Street and Guildford Street) and also for a new centre in Power Court (close to St Mary's Church) have been submitted. On the edge of Luton at Putteridge Bury a high-technology office park, Butterfield Green, is under construction. The former Vauxhall site is also to be re-developed as a mixed use site called Napier Park. It will feature housing, retail and entertainment use, including a new casino.|$|E
25|$|In May 1999, {{the mall}} began a $50 million {{renovation}} program, {{which included a}} new glass entrance at Flatbush Avenue, and upgrades <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mall</b> interior. Around 2002, the mall's owners planned to construct an addition <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mall,</b> on the parking lot {{on the east side}} of 55th Street. As originally planned, it would have added 100,000 square feet <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mall,</b> with a home improvement store, a multiplex theater replacing the original mall theater, and indoor parking space. A new complex on the site had been planned going back to 1997. In mid-2003, the parking lot was closed in preparation for the addition. In 2005, Lowe's signed on to occupy the home improvement store. The expansion faced community backlash due to fears of increased traffic in the area. The developers, Vornado Realty Trust (the successors to Alexander's), and the New York City Department of City Planning were also accused of conspiring to keep the local community in the dark about the progress of the addition. The community opposition led the developers to downsize the expansion to the single Lowe's store. Construction began in 2009, and the Lowe's was opened on July 23, 2010.|$|E
25|$|The mall {{is managed}} by the Triple Five Group (which in turn is owned by Canada's Ghermezian family, along with the West Edmonton Mall). Eighty percent of {{visitors}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mall</b> of America are from Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa, the Dakotas, Illinois, Ohio, and Canada.|$|E
50|$|At {{opposite}} ends of <b>the</b> <b>mall</b> are two department stores, Macy's (formerly Hecht's) and Nordstrom. The three-story Macy's connects <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mall's</b> top two floors, while Nordstrom connects to all four mall floors (including Nordstrom Rack on the first floor).|$|R
50|$|The {{terminal}} {{does not}} have a terminal building since it is a minor terminal. It only contains bus shelters and passengers require a short walk <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mall's</b> nearest entrance.|$|R
50|$|Long-term {{competition}} from the River Oaks Center in Calumet City, Illinois and Southlake Mall in Hobart, Indiana drew business away from Woodmar and led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mall's</b> decline. By 2004, {{fewer than a dozen}} stores remained open. In February 2006, the decision was made <b>to</b> demolish <b>the</b> <b>mall</b> except for <b>the</b> Carson's store. The Hammond Redevelopment Commission announced plans in June 2016 for a $12 million sports complex to be built on the site of <b>the</b> former <b>mall.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{city has}} one big bus {{terminal}} next <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mall</b> Plaza Norte. This bus station {{is the point}} of departure and arrival point for national and international destinations. Other bus stations serve private bus companies around the city. In addition, informal bus stations are located in the south, center and north of the city.|$|E
25|$|To {{the east}} {{and south of the}} mall is the Mill Basin Inlet, which {{separates}} the mall from the neighborhood of the same name. A marina called the Kings Plaza Marina is located along the perimeter of the parking garage. The original purpose of the marina was to allow shoppers to travel <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mall</b> by boat.|$|E
25|$|Eastward {{expansion}} {{focuses on}} {{bus rapid transit}} from downtown Atlanta along I-20 and extension of heavy rail transit from Indian Creek station, south along I-285 to I-20, then east along the I-20 corridor <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mall</b> at Stonecrest. The current Green Line would also be extended east from its current terminus at Edgewood/Candler Park station to Mall at Stonecrest.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>mall</b> {{opened in}} November 2000. An annex (building 2) was added in October 2002. Annex 3 (building 3), added 99,439 square meters <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mall's</b> gross floor area. The newest annex (Building 4) opened in October 2007 with an {{additional}} 16,700 square meters of floor area.|$|R
50|$|Originally {{opened in}} 1976, <b>the</b> <b>mall</b> was {{purchased}} by Simon Property Group in 2003 when it acquired The Kravco Company. Although a majority stake in <b>the</b> <b>mall</b> has since been sold <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Pennsylvania Real Estate Investment Trust, Simon continues <b>to</b> manage <b>the</b> <b>mall.</b> In 1995, <b>the</b> <b>mall</b> went under its first major renovation. The spiral ramp connecting the two levels was removed {{to make way for}} a glass elevator, fountains were removed, and renovations <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mall's</b> interior and exterior appearance were made. A 110000 sq ft lifestyle center addition was added in October 2007, housing such stores as Apple, Coach, Sephora and Barnes & Noble.|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mall's</b> special theaters, it {{also has}} six regular two-tiered movie theaters similar <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ones found in almost every SM Supermall. Two new digital theaters were opened at {{the north side of}} <b>the</b> entertainment <b>mall,</b> for a total of eight theaters.|$|R
