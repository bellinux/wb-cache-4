With this system, we have successfully measured the methylation levels at the promoter region of the androgen receptor gene in 106 copies of genomic DNA extracted from PC 3 and TSU-PR 1 cancer cell lines.

40|$|Forty-eight {{randomly}} selected age-related human biological functions were analyzed {{in order to}} establish whether or not their (linear) regressions were modified by age-related standard errors. Possible reasons for this are advanced. Statistically significant multiple regressions were obtained in 25 %, and 21 % of the functions yielded statistically significant changes in the correlations between data and age when partial correlation coefficients were calculated. The conclusion is that age-related data need to be subjected to the above tests in order to minimize confounding factors. AGE-RELATED biological functions are often calledbiomarkers. In many instances, they vary linearly with age, either positively or negatively, {{so that they can be}} represented with linear regressions. The latter frequently accompany plots of age-related average values together with the appropriate variances or standard errors (SEs).

40|$|BACKGROUND: A {{think tank}} {{sponsored}} by the Collegium Internationale Neuropsychopharmacologium (CINP) debated the status and prospects of biological markers for psychiatric disorders, focusing on schizophrenia and major depressive disorder. METHODS: Discussions covered markers defining and predicting specific disorders or domains of dysfunction, as well as predicting and monitoring medication efficacy. Deliberations included clinically useful and viable biomarkers, why suitable markers are not available, {{and the need for}} tightly-controlled sample collection. RESULTS: Different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>biomarkers,</b> appropriate sensitivity, specificity, and broad-based exploitability were discussed. Whilst a number of candidates are in the discovery phases, all will require replication in larger, real-life cohorts. Clinical cost-effectiveness also needs to be established. CONCLUSIONS: Since a single measure is unlikely to suffice, multi-modal strategies look more promising, although they bring greater technical and implementation complexities. Identifying reproducible, robust biomarkers will probably require pre-competitive consortia to provide the resources needed to identify, validate, and develop the relevant clinical tests...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Studies aimed toward glycan {{biomarker}} discovery {{have focused}} on glycan characterization by the global profiling of released glycans. Site-specific glycosylation analysis is less developed but may provide new <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>biomarkers</b> with higher sensitivity and specificity. Quantitation of peptide-conjugated glycans directly facilitates the differential analysis of distinct glycoforms associated with specific proteins at distinct sites. We have developed a method using MRM to monitor protein glycosylation normalized to absolute protein concentrations to examine quantitative changes in glycosylation at a site-specific level. This new approach provides information regarding both the absolute amount of protein and the site-specific glycosylation profile and will thus be useful to determine if altered glycosylation profiles in serum/plasma are due {{to a change in}} protein glycosylation or a change in protein concentration. The remarkable sensitivity and selectivity of MRM enable the detection of low abundance IgG glycopeptides, even when IgG was digested directly in serum with no cleanup prior to the liquid chromatography.

30|$|Biomarkers {{have been}} defined as an {{important}} factor in diagnosing the early phase of diseases, monitoring the severities of the disease and sensitivities to therapies, or even predicting the prognosis of patients with lung diseases. An increasing number <b>of</b> <b>biomarkers</b> are being discovered and identified from preclinical research, while a few can be used clinically. For example, network biomarkers and dynamic network <b>biomarkers,</b> a new <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>biomarkers</b> with protein-protein interactions, can be monitored and evaluated at different stages and time points during the development of diseases [5]. Recent study combined genome-wide association with forced expiratory volume in 1 second and the ratio of forced expiratory volume in 1 second to forced vital capacity and identified 16 new regions showing association with pulmonary function [6]. Those biomarkers were selected from 48, 201 individuals of European ancestry with follow up of the top associations in up to an additional 46, 411 individuals. However, there is further need to better understand those biomarkers associated with molecular mechanisms involving pulmonary function and validate selected targets preventing lung dysfunction. Biomarker identification and validation in pulmonary diseases like COPD stand in the frontline of translational medicine in combination with clinical informatics, targeted proteomics, bioinformatics, systems medicine, or mathematical science [7, 8].

This situation has prompted us to shift from symptom-based diagnosis to data-driven diagnosis, aiming to redefine psychiatric disorders as disorders of neural circuitry. Promising candidates for data-driven diagnosis include resting-state functional connectivity MRI (rs-fcMRI) -based biomarkers. Although biomarkers have been developed {{with the aim of}} diagnosing patients and predicting the efficacy of therapy, the focus has shifted to the identification <b>of</b> <b>biomarkers</b> that represent therapeutic targets, which would allow for more personalized treatment approaches. This <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>biomarker</b> (i. e., theranostic biomarker) is expected to elucidate the disease mechanism of psychiatric conditions and to offer an individualized neural circuit-based therapeutic target based on the neural cause of a condition. To this end, researchers have developed rs-fcMRI-based biomarkers and investigated a causal relationship between potential biomarkers and disease-specific behavior using functional MRI (fMRI) -based neurofeedback on functional connectivity. In this review, we introduce recent approach for creating a theranostic biomarker, which consists mainly of two parts: (i) developing an rs-fcMRI-based biomarker that can predict diagnosis and/or symptoms with high accuracy, and (ii) the introduction of a proof-of-concept study investigating the relationship between normalizing the biomarker and symptom changes using fMRI-based neurofeedback.

40|$|Biomarkers are {{molecular}} {{targets of}} which analysis allows diagnosing {{the presence of}} disease, predicting outcome and/or response to treatment. Recently, the rising interest in the epigenetics field {{has led to the}} identification <b>of</b> a new <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>biomarker,</b> DNA methylation, which has great potential for many clinical applications. DNA methylation is the addition of a methyl group to carbon 5 of the cytosine within the dinucleotide CpG. Dense clusters of CpG dinucleotides, termed CpG islands, are often present in gene promoters and as a result, research often focuses on hypermethylation of these regions, as this often leads to transcriptional silencing and thus has biological relevance. However, every methylated cytosine can be an ideal biomarker for (early) detection or prognosis of disease, {{as long as it is}} related with clinical features (e. g. tumor stage) or survival of the patient. As an example, we illustrate how unbiased and genome-wide DNA methylation assessment, using massively parallel sequencing of MBD (methyl-CpG-binding domain) -enriched DNA fragments, can lead to the identification of putative prognostic DNA methylation biomarkers in neuroblastoma. We also present a high-throughput methylation-specific PCR (MSP) platform, which can be used to validate the identified markers on large patient cohorts.
