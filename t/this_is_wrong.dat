5|$|Felton (Daniel Baldwin) visits Harry Prentice (Wilford Brimley), {{the elderly}} and bed-ridden father of his friend Chuckie (Michael Chaban). Ill and miserable, the hard-bitten Harry has decided he wants to die and has hired a suicide doctor. Felton {{believes}} <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>wrong</b> and convinces Chuckie to call it off, much to Harry's anger. A few days later, however, Harry wears Chuckie down and convinces his son to shoot him {{to death with a}} handgun. When Lewis (Clark Johnson) and Crosetti (Jon Polito) investigate, Chuckie claims Harry shot himself, which Lewis does not believe. Felton talks to Chuckie at the police station and Chuckie admits to the assisted suicide, but Felton tells him to stick to the original suicide story. Lewis realizes what happened and confronts Felton, who admits what Chuckie did and suggests {{it was the right thing}} to do, but Lewis adamantly disagrees. Since the bullet evidence is inconclusive, Felton asks Lewis to let Chuckie secretly wash his hands so no gunpowder residue will be found in tests. Lewis initially refuses, but he eventually reluctantly agrees, allowing Chuckie to get away with the shooting.|$|E
25|$|A claim can be {{made that}} the {{difference}} between the two cases is that in the second, you intend someone's death to save the five, and <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>wrong,</b> whereas, in the first, you have no such intention. This solution is essentially an application of the doctrine of double effect, which says that you may take action which has bad side effects, but deliberately intending harm (even for good causes) is wrong.|$|E
25|$|While {{both were}} good friends, Rabbi Dovber and Rabbi Aharon {{disagreed}} about the emphasis on, and correct method of, emotional expression in Chassidic prayer. According to Rabbi Dovber, the greatest service a Jew can perform in worship is to totally nullify himself before The Creator. Therefore, maintained Rabbi Dovber, a person's meditation can {{appear to be}} cold and emotionless on the exterior, where the prayer causes the person praying to feel oneself one with The Creator. To that end, Rabbi Dovber prayed with great D'veikus (cleaving), rather than with Hispaylus (excitement), where the one praying gets excited over the Creator but remains, in his own feeling and understanding, a separate entity and existence. Rabbi Dovber prayed while perfectly still, hardly moving. His outward countenance remained completely unaffected. It {{is important to note}} this mode of davening was something personal to him, as he was able to conceal his emotions, rather than something he recommended for everyone. When the Rebbe DovBer noticed that his chassidim (followers) thought that they should be devoid of any emotional appearance, he wrote a public letter stating that <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>wrong.</b> His disagreement with Rabbi Aharon was rather that he felt that there must be an understanding of Godliness and a cleaving, in other words that one's emotional feeling be a lasting one, not one that would evaporate after a short time.|$|E

500|$|Casting Crowns' lead vocalist, Mark Hall, {{commented on}} the lyrical content of the song, stating that: [...] "For believers, in context with our other songs, the {{messages}} are that God wants to use you, He wants you to grow and He wants {{you to have a}} purpose". Hall elaborated that: [...] "There are a trilogy of songs and messages that go together on the album. , “Glorious Day,” and “To Know You.” [...] reminds me to be more intentional about what I do. I {{may not be able to}} get on a plane and fly to China and give out Bibles and preach the gospel, but how can I witness to my co-workers and my friends and my family." [...] The portion of the chorus that says [...] "like voices in the wilderness we're crying out" [...] is a reference to John the Baptist; Hall said that one of his favorite characters in the New Testament was John the Baptist, and commented that [...] "he [...] was so black and white. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>wrong,</b> and this is right. And he was speaking into a grey world, saying black and white things, and it cost him his life". He elaborated on that, commenting that: [...] "Until the whole world hears are the lines and the things that John the Baptist said into a culture that did not want to hear it. And we've got to be in a place in our walk with Jesus that he's filled us to where we step into something that's unpopular and we can speak the truth, but that we can also speak it in love. We've got to live in such a way that I have the purpose that John had".|$|E

To save time and resources, it was designed in concert with the 38 cm Belagerungshaubitze M 16 and used the same carriage and firing platform as the larger weapon. The gun used the forward trunnion mounts on the carriage, while the howitzer used the rear ones.

The representative at the Norwegian Commerce office {{did not have the}} right to perform marriages and he was not in Moscow on 10 September. The couple might have had a civil marriage in Kharkov, though there has never been any documentation for it. Historian Hans Fredrik Dahl believe some kind of marriage took place in Kharkov that day, but that he is unsure whether it happened in formally correct ways or was an informal ceremony. The same day as the marriage allegedly took place, Maria got a special passport for employees of Nansen Action. It was issued to [...] "Mary Quisling".|$|E

My advice to ministers is clear: that there is no science in homoeopathy. The most it can have is a placebo effect – it is then a political decision whether they spend money on it or not." [...] His predecessor, John Beddington, referring to his views on homeopathy being [...] "fundamentally ignored" [...] by the Government, said: [...] "The only one [...] I could think of was homoeopathy, which is mad. It has no underpinning of scientific basis. In fact, all the science points {{to the fact that it}} is not at all sensible. The clear evidence is saying <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>wrong,</b> but homoeopathy is still used on the NHS." ...|$|E
2500|$|I am {{told that}} the more you rehearse, the better you play. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>wrong.</b> We often try to reduce the {{unforeseen}} to a controllable level, to prevent a sudden impulse that escapes our ability to control, yet also responds to an obscure desire.

2500|$|By the 16th century most {{visitors}} who left accounts argue against {{the notion that}} the pyramids were originally granaries constructed by the patriarch Joseph, if they mention it at all. [...] Many of the visitors inspected the ruins rather closely, often entering the great Pyramid, rather than simply viewing them from a distance. [...] The French traveler Greffin Affagart (Seigneur de Courteilles) visited the Pyramids in 1533 and noted that [...] "some call [...] the granaries of Pharaoh, but <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>wrong</b> because they are not hollow on the inside, rather they are sepulchers of some kings of Egypt." [...] The French explorer and naturalist Pierre Belon of Mans, a careful observer, records in 1546 that the great Pyramid [...] "was the sepulcher of the King of Egypt." [...] Another French explorer André Thevet, who visited three years later writes: [...] "The Jews have told me many times that they find in their Chronicles that these Pyramids were the support of the granaries of Pharaoh: that is not likely ... they are sepulchers of kings as appears from Herodotus ... since I saw in one pyramid a great stone of marble carved {{in the manner of a}} sepulcher." [...] Finally, in the 17th century, John Greaves, Professor of Astronomy at Oxford, published the first truly scientific work on the Pyramids, Pyramidographia (1646). He cites many of the ancient authors mentioned above, and dismisses the erroneous etymologies yielding notions of “receptacles and granaries,” and calls attention to the obvious fact “that this figure is most improper for such a purpose, a Pyramid being the least capacious of any regular mathematical body, the straitness and fewness of the rooms within (the rest of the building being one solid and intire fabric of stone) do utterly over-throw this conjecture.” [...] No longer could the notion be held credibly, though for over a millennium it had reigned supreme among European travelers.|$|E
2500|$|On an {{occasion}} in 628, Wang was attending a feast held by Emperor Taizong, when a beautiful concubine of Emperor Taizong's, who was originally a concubine of Li Yuan the Prince of Lujiang {{and who was}} taken into Emperor Taizong's palace after Li Yuan was executed, was attending to Emperor Taizong. [...] Emperor Taizong stated, [...] "The Prince of Lujiang was despicable. [...] He killed her husband and seized her. [...] How could he survive long after this barbarous act!" [...] Wang instead responded, [...] "Does Your Imperial Majesty believe that the Prince of Lujiang was correct in seizing this woman?" [...] Emperor Taizong responded, [...] "Why do you ask me whether it is correct to kill a woman's husband and seize her?" [...] Wang responded, [...] "I had once read from the writings of Guan Zhong, which stated, 'When Duke Huan of Qi visited the land of Guo , he asked the seniors of Guo, [...] "Why was Guo destroyed?" [...] The seniors stated, [...] "The lord of Guo knew right from wrong." [...] Duke Huan responded, [...] "If you are correct, then he was an intelligent ruler. [...] Why was he destroyed?" [...] The seniors responded, [...] "The lord of Guo knew what was right but could not do it. [...] He also knew what was wrong but could not stop doing it. [...] That was why he was destroyed."' [...] Now, this woman is still by your side. [...] I believe it is that Your Imperial Majesty in fact believes that this is right. [...] If you believe that <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>wrong,</b> {{you are the one}} who knows what is wrong and could not stop doing it." [...] Although Emperor Taizong could not send away the woman, he was nevertheless humbled by Wang's words and respected him for his words. [...] On another occasion, there was an incident where Emperor Taizong had the official Zu Xiaosun (祖孝孫) teach his ladies in waiting music, and when the ladies in waiting could not learn it well, rebuked Zu. [...] Wang and Wen Yanbo spoke against the rebuke, stating that it was not appropriate for Emperor Taizong to have had an important official become a music teacher for ladies in waiting in the first place. [...] Emperor Taizong became angry and rebuked Wen and Wang. [...] Wen bowed and begged for forgiveness, but Wang refused to do so, stating to Emperor Taizong that the rebuke to him and Wen was not warranted as they were reporting what was true. [...] Emperor Taizong was surprised, but the next day indicated to the high-level officials that he was rash and improper in rebuking Wang and Wen.|$|E
