5|$|At 16:29, the Japanese dive bombers began <b>their</b> <b>attacks.</b> Although several {{attempted}} {{to set up}} to attack the Saratoga, they quickly shifted back to the nearer carrier, Enterprise. Thus, Enterprise {{was the target of}} almost the entire Japanese air attack. Several Wildcats followed the Vals into their attack dives, despite the intense anti-aircraft artillery fire from Enterprise and her screening warships, {{in a desperate attempt to}} disrupt <b>their</b> <b>attacks.</b> As many as four Wildcats were shot down by U.S. anti-aircraft fire, as well as several Vals.|$|E

5|$|At the East Gate, the {{situation}} also became serious, {{for a larger}} Byzantine force {{had been assigned to}} this sector. Rafay was unable to withstand <b>their</b> <b>attacks.</b> The timely arrival of Khalid with his reserve of 400 veteran cavalry and his subsequent attack on the Roman flank, marked the turning point in the sally at the Eastern Gate.|$|E

5|$|Local {{people have}} {{reported}} {{their belief that}} some elephants were drunk during <b>their</b> <b>attacks,</b> although officials have disputed this explanation. Purportedly drunk elephants attacked an Indian village a second time in December 2002, killing six people, {{which led to the}} killing of about 200 elephants by locals.|$|E
5|$|On the {{following}} day, General Dong's forces staged <b>their</b> <b>attacks</b> from two main directions, from Thanh Hoi and Tich Tuong-Nhu Le, moving along Route 68 and National Highway 1 respectively. The North Vietnamese 2nd Army Corps, {{on the other}} hand, assaulted South Vietnamese positions in Phu Loc and Phu Gia.|$|E

50|$|On 2 February, the 31st Engineer Battalion, Philippine Army {{was sent}} to decisively clear the bamboo thicket of the {{remaining}} Japanese troops. Shortly after <b>their</b> <b>attack</b> had begun, the Engineers met stiff resistance and <b>their</b> <b>attack</b> stalled. Once again, {{the men of the}} 41st were called on, and sent to aid in the attack. The advance of the Filipinos then continued, and by dusk, they had finally reached the thicket. The next morning, they resumed <b>their</b> <b>attack</b> only to find that they had cleared the area of all remaining Japanese, effectively ending the threat to Trail 2.|$|R

5|$|Since it {{soon became}} obvious that the Japanese force had no air cover, the U.S. {{aircraft}} were able to set up for <b>their</b> <b>attacks</b> without fear of opposition from Japanese aircraft. U.S. bomber and torpedo aircraft arriving over the Yamato group—after their two-hour flight from Okinawa—were thus able to circle the Japanese ship formation just out of anti-aircraft range in order to methodically set up <b>their</b> <b>attacks</b> on the warships below. The first wave of U.S. carrier planes were spotted by a Japanese lookout on the bridge at 12:32. Two minutes later, Yamato opened fire with her 460mm main batteries. The Japanese ships stopped zigzagging and increased speed to , beginning evasive maneuvers, and opened fire with their anti-aircraft guns. Yamato carried almost 150 anti-aircraft guns, including her massive 460mm guns.|$|E

5|$|Whether a Native American tribe was {{friendly}} or warlike {{was critical to}} the fates of European explorers and settlers in that land. Friendly tribes taught newcomers how to grow indigenous crops, prepare foods, and hunt wild game.

5|$|A {{total of}} 10 U.S. {{aircraft}} {{were shot down}} by anti-aircraft fire from the Japanese ships; some of the aircrews were rescued by seaplane or submarine. In total, the U.S. lost 12 men. Some of the Japanese survivors reported that U.S. fighter aircraft machine-gunned Japanese survivors floating in the water. Japanese survivors also reported that U.S. aircraft temporarily halted <b>their</b> <b>attacks</b> on the Japanese destroyers {{during the time that}} the destroyers were busy picking up survivors from the water.|$|E
5|$|After the North Korean {{infiltration}} on September 7 was repelled, the North Korean {{attack on}} Haman {{ground to a}} halt. The North Koreans, racked by logistical and manpower shortages, focused more heavily on <b>their</b> <b>attacks</b> against 24th Infantry positions on Battle Mountain, as well as 35th Infantry positions at the Nam River. 24th Infantry troops at Haman encountered only probing attacks until September 18.|$|E
5|$|All of the Lancasters had {{completed}} <b>their</b> <b>attacks</b> by 11:07am GMT, and the 21 bombers began the return journey to Yagodnik. The Force A aircraft {{which had not}} been able to bomb brought their Tallboys back. This flight proved uneventful, and all 27 Lancasters landed at Yagodnik in the evening. The Film Unit aircraft flew directly from Kaafjord to the United Kingdom, and arrived at its home station after a fifteen-and-a-half hour flight; this was the longest operational Lancaster mission of World War II.|$|E

5|$|Although outnumbered ten-to-one by the Pakistani troops, the Sikhs {{repelled}} <b>their</b> <b>attacks</b> multiple times. With their ammunition running out, Singh {{ordered his}} men to join the main company, knowing that reinforcement was impossible under Pakistani shelling. With the help of another soldier, he brought two injured men along, though he himself was wounded. Under the heavy Pakistani fire, Singh moved from position to position, boosting the morale of his men and intermittently throwing grenades. Despite being wounded twice, he refused evacuation and continued to hold {{the first line of}} trenches.|$|E
5|$|As {{the militia}} fell back, {{the three men}} who had set out in search of their horses {{returned}} and they too {{were killed by the}} Native American forces. The natives continued to assault the barn and cabin; <b>their</b> <b>attacks</b> did not cease and during the battle about 25 horses were killed. Finally, the native forces withdrew, leaving nine of their own dead behind. The June 25 battle was the last of the Black Hawk War on Illinois soil. Dement's company lost five men with another three were wounded, many horses were killed as well.|$|E
5|$|At 16:02, {{still waiting}} for a {{definitive}} report on {{the location of the}} Japanese fleet carriers, the U.S. carriers' radar detected the first incoming wave of Japanese strike aircraft. Fifty-three F4F-4 Wildcat fighters from the two U.S. carriers were directed by radar control towards the attackers. However, communication problems, limitations of the aircraft identification capabilities of the radar, primitive control procedures, and effective screening of the Japanese dive bombers by their escorting Zeros, prevented all {{but a few of the}} U.S. fighters from engaging the Vals before they began <b>their</b> <b>attacks</b> on the U.S. carriers. Just before the Japanese dive bombers began <b>their</b> <b>attacks,</b> Enterprise and Saratoga cleared their decks for the impending action by launching the aircraft that they had been holding ready in case the Japanese fleet carriers were sighted. These aircraft were told to fly north and attack anything they could find, or else to circle outside the battle zone, until it was safe to return.|$|E
50|$|Sir Edward further {{argued that}} the alleged {{massacre}} of U-27s crew could be grouped with the Imperial German Navys sinking of SS Arabic, <b>their</b> <b>attack</b> on a stranded British submarine in neutral Dutch territorial waters, and <b>their</b> <b>attack</b> on the steamship Ruel. In conclusion, Grey suggested that all four incidents be placed before a tribunal chaired by the United States Navy.|$|R

5|$|Bombing of Normandy began {{around midnight}} {{with more than}} 2,200 British, Canadian, and American bombers attacking targets along the coast and further inland. The coastal bombing attack was largely {{ineffective}} at Omaha, because low cloud cover made the assigned targets difficult to see. Concerned about inflicting casualties on their own troops, many bombers delayed <b>their</b> <b>attacks</b> too long and failed to hit the beach defences. The Germans had 570 aircraft stationed in Normandy and the Low Countries on D-Day, and another 964 in Germany.|$|E
5|$|In the afternoon, {{there was}} {{fighting}} both west (Hill's Corps renewing <b>their</b> <b>attacks</b> on the I Corps) and north (Ewell's Corps attacking the I and XI Corps) of Gettysburg.
