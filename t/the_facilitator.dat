5|$|In the break, {{a number}} of Central Europeans, {{including}} Vuilleumier and Bruno Trojani, asked for top speed. This was protested by the Scandinavian and United States jumpers, and a 40-minute discussion broke out. At one point, one of the facilitators at the in-run received a telephone call confirming top speed. <b>The</b> <b>facilitator</b> was skeptical, and chose to call back to the judges, who could confirm {{that they had not}} given such a go-ahead. In the end, the judges chose to allow higher speeds, with a compromise of 5.0meters more distance. However, <b>the</b> <b>facilitator</b> only moved the rope 4.5meters. This made the Swiss furious, and they used their knives to cut the rope. They then accused the participants who were opposed to full speed of being cowards.|$|E

25|$|Endowments are {{transferred}} with special tools called forcibles. A forcible is cast {{of a rare}} material called blood metal into the rune corresponding to the endowment to be transferred. Files and other tools refine the rune. The finished forcible resembles more than anything a small branding iron. The method of creating forcibles, and the supervision of their creation, {{is part of the}} duties of a special class of magician called a facilitator. When the forcible is ready, <b>the</b> <b>facilitator</b> invokes its power, which causes the instrument to glow. <b>The</b> <b>facilitator</b> touches the forcible to the dedicate, who experiences a brief burst of excruciating pain. The instrument glows more brightly, and leaves trails of light when moved through the air. An expert facilitator can tell whether the endowment worked properly by examining the forcible and the light trails. If satisfied, he touches the instrument to the recipient, who receives the attribute and is marked with the rune. The dedicate experiences the corresponding loss of that attribute. The forcible is expended by this process and may not be reused.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the {{effectiveness}} of the professional development offered to <b>the</b> <b>facilitators</b> of <b>the</b> Certificate in Psychosocial Support programme offered by the Institute of Distance Education, University of Swaziland. It also explores the effect this has on the learners being supported. The study was qualitative using open ended questionnaires and focus group discussions to gather data from <b>the</b> <b>facilitators</b> and <b>the</b> mentor supervisor and her assistant. Data was analysed through content analysis applying the Harland and Kinder (2014) model of professional development outcomes. The results show that the professional development offered to <b>facilitators</b> of <b>the</b> Certificate in Psychosocial Support of the UNISWA once every semester has positive results. <b>The</b> <b>facilitators</b> generally agreed that through the professional development they acquire knowledge and skill in handling face-to-face sessions, using modules and other learning materials, motivating learners, psychosocial support principles, approaches and child protection; the delivery model and application of content rather than spoon feeding. These gains are largely to do with the pedagogical approach selected for <b>the</b> programme. <b>The</b> <b>facilitators</b> also acquired new learning/ teaching materials in readiness for a new semester. Each session provided an opportunity for facilitators to interact with the modules coordinators and among themselves. <b>The</b> <b>facilitators</b> were unhappy with the lack of preparation by some module coordinators. The study recommends that IDE reviews the performance of module coordinators and replace those who are no longer performing. IDE should also devise creative ways of offering the professional development so that it continues to be educative and motivating to <b>the</b> <b>facilitators...</b>|$|R

25|$|Pre-session Strategy {{refers to}} the leader’s ability to {{understand}} the importance of small talk just prior to group discussion. <b>The</b> <b>facilitator</b> must cordially greet the group members and begin small talk {{while at the same time}} avoid the topics and issues that will be discussed during the sessions. This will allow the group leader to observe the kind of interactions and understand which participant has what qualities. Recording is beneficial for the leader via tape recording and note taking. Note taking is useful as they can be utilized even if the tape recorder stops working. Someone other than the group leader or <b>the</b> <b>facilitator</b> should take detailed and in depth notes of the discussion. Beginning of the Discussion includes the usual pattern of discussion which is welcome, overview and topic, ground rules and first question. The overview must provide an explanation of the purpose and importance of the topic of discussion. Ground rules must be stated explicitly. Some of the examples are, minimizing or eliminating side conversations, one person talks at a time, no criticizing what others have to say and treating everyone’s opinion with respect and dignity. The initial conversation should include an “ice breaker” in order to make the members more comfortable and open.|$|E
25|$|A further {{characteristic}} {{of the role of}} <b>the</b> <b>facilitator</b> in the social constructivist viewpoint, is that the instructor and the learners are equally involved in learning from each other as well (Holt and Willard-Holt 2000). This means that the learning experience is both subjective and objective and requires that the instructor's culture, values and background become {{an essential part of the}} interplay between learners and tasks in the shaping of meaning. Learners compare their version of the truth with that of the instructor and fellow learners to get to a new, socially tested version of truth (Kukla 2000). The task or problem is thus the interface between the instructor and the learner (McMahon 1997). This creates a dynamic interaction between task, instructor and learner. This entails that learners and instructors should develop an awareness of each other's viewpoints and then look to their own beliefs, standards and values, thus being both subjective and objective at the same time (Savery 1994).|$|E

25|$|Negotiated {{performance}} appraisal: The negotiated {{performance appraisal}} (NPA) is an emerging approach for improving communication between supervisors and subordinates and for increasing employee productivity, {{and may also}} be adapted to an alternate mediation model for supervisor-subordinate conflicts. A facilitator meets separately with the supervisor and with the subordinate to prepare three lists. What employees do well, where the employee has improved in recently, and areas where the employee still needs to improve. Because the subordinate will present his or her lists first during the joint session, this reduces defensive behaviors. Furthermore, the subordinate comes to the joint session not only prepared to share areas of needed improvement, but also brings concrete ideas as to how these improvements can be made. The NPA also focuses very strongly on what employees are doing well, and involves a minimum of twenty minutes of praise when discussing what the employee does well. The role of <b>the</b> <b>facilitator</b> {{is that of a}} coach in the pre-caucuses, and in the joint sessions the supervisor and subordinate mostly speak to each other with little facilitator interference.|$|E

For example, one student explained, “They kept me going. If I had trouble they’d always help me a lot. They’d say, “You should try another thing.” [Once] I tried using a tire as a gear [laughs], I tried pulling it up with a tire!” <b>The</b> students described <b>facilitator</b> behaviors like making encouraging statements, being funny, and communicating that they wanted to students to persevere.

The third theme concerned the facilitators’ choices to participate in Studio STEM and the reasons why they were motivated to develop the program (4 % of responses). The fact that Studio STEM was developed communicated caring to one student: “Well first of all, they wouldn’t even have this program if they didn’t care.” Another student thought that they cared because they chose to be facilitators in Studio STEM and to educate students.|$|R

2500|$|The Floortime/DIR (Developmental, Individual Differences based, Relationship based [...] ) {{approach}} is a developmental intervention to autism developed by Stanley Greenspan and Serena Weider.

When addressed through a combination of sensory support and DIR/Floortime techniques, <b>the</b> <b>facilitator</b> is playfully obstructive to redirect the child to play and relate to their therapist. The primary goal of Floortime is to improve the child's cognitive, language, and social abilities.

2500|$|Son-Rise is a home-based {{program that}} {{emphasizes}} on implementing a color- and sensory-free playroom. Before implementing the home-based program, an institute trains the parents how {{to accept their}} child without judgment {{through a series of}} dialogue sessions. Like Floortime, parents join their child's ritualistic behavior for relationship-building. To gain the child's [...] "willing engagement", <b>the</b> <b>facilitator</b> continues to join them only this time through parallel play. Proponents claim that children will become non-autistic after parents accept them for who they are and engage them in play. The program was started by the parents of Raun Kaufman, who is claimed to have gone from being autistic to normal via the treatment in the early 1970s. No independent study has tested the efficacy of the program, but a 2003 study found that involvement with the program led to more drawbacks than benefits for the involved families over time, and a 2006 study found that the program is not always implemented as it is typically described in the literature, which suggests {{it will be difficult to}} evaluate its efficacy.|$|E
5000|$|The {{overwhelming}} majority of evidence from studies conducted on the efficacy of this technique has revealed that the likely explanation for any [...] "positive" [...] results—that is, anything indicating that facilitated communication has worked—can {{be attributed to the}} facilitators themselves. Be it <b>the</b> <b>facilitator</b> attributing their own beliefs and views onto the individual, or the creating a pseudo-personality for the disabled individual based on their previous encounters with them, it is clear that <b>the</b> <b>facilitator</b> is really the one doing all the communicating. Further examination into this technique has discovered various examples in which the disabled individual using facilitated communication could correctly respond to simple questions only when <b>the</b> <b>facilitator</b> was in the room to hear the questions. This included asking <b>the</b> <b>facilitator</b> to leave and then proceeding to show the disabled individual a picture of an animal. Next, <b>the</b> <b>facilitator</b> would return to the room and be asked to help the individual answer the question: [...] "what animal did I just show you?" [...] In all of these cases, the questions were answered incorrectly. However, when asked questions while <b>the</b> <b>facilitator</b> was in the room, the correct response would be made. Shockingly, this technique has also led to a series of false sexual abuse cases in which <b>the</b> <b>facilitator</b> would indicate that the disabled individual revealed that they had been sexually abused. Unsurprisingly, these cases were later dismissed upon the discovery that these false accusations were actually a result of <b>the</b> <b>facilitator</b> fabricating these stories.|$|E
5000|$|The Ball Exercise: Immediately after introductions, <b>the</b> <b>facilitator</b> {{arranges}} {{the group}} {{in a circle and}} asks each person to throw the ball to a person {{on the other side of}} the circle while stating their name. When every person in the group has thrown the ball at least once, <b>the</b> <b>facilitator</b> announces that [...] "we are going to do it again but this time we'll time it" [...] and announces the rules. 1) Each person must touch the ball in the same order as the first round. 2) Each person must touch the ball with at least one hand. 3) Time stops when the ball is returned to <b>the</b> <b>facilitator.</b> (For further complication, <b>the</b> <b>facilitator</b> will sometimes introduce three balls in succession to the process.) Regardless of their performance, <b>the</b> <b>facilitator</b> expresses disappointment with the group's performance and urges them to do it again faster. When asked for clarification, <b>the</b> <b>facilitator</b> only reiterates the rules. An effective team will creatively redesign their process to meet the requirements of the rules. After several iterations, <b>the</b> <b>facilitator</b> will call a halt and use the exercise to draw out morals which will be relevant later in the day such as [...] "Challenge assumptions", [...] "Don't be satisfied with the first answer", [...] "Be creative", etc.|$|E
