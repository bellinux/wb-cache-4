The actual operational data of electric taxis in Shenzhen, China, is analyzed, and, in allusion to the unbalanced time availability of the charging station equipment, the electric <b>taxis</b> charging <b>guidance</b> system is proposed basing on the charging station information and vehicle information.

40|$|This report {{summarizes}} the software products and system architectures developed by Lockheed Martin {{in support of}} the Low Visibility Landing and Surface Operations (LVLASO) program at NASA Langley Research Center. It presents an overview of the technical aspects, capabilities, and system integration issues associated with an integrated display system (IDS) that collects, processes and presents information to an aircraft flight crew during all phases of landing, roll-out, turn-off, inbound taxi, outbound taxi and takeoff. Communications hardware, drivers, and software provide continuous real-time data at varying rates and from many different sources to the display programs for presentation on a head-down display (HDD) and/or a head-up display (HUD). An electronic moving map of the airport surface is implemented on the HDD which includes the taxi route assigned by air traffic control, a text messaging system, and surface traffic and runway status information. Typical HUD symbology for navigation and control of the aircraft is augmented to provide aircraft deceleration guidance after touchdown to a pilot selected exit and <b>taxi</b> <b>guidance</b> along the route assigned by ATC. HUD displays include scene-linked symbolic runways, runway exits and taxiways that are conformal with the actual locations on the airport surface. Display formats, system architectures, and the various IDS programs are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The German Aerospace Center (DLR) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) {{have been}} {{independently}} developing and testing their own concepts and tools for airport surface traffic management. Although these concepts and tools {{have been tested}} individually for European and US airports, {{they have never been}} compared or analyzed side-by-side. This paper presents the collaborative research devoted to the evaluation and analysis of two different surface management concepts. Hamburg Airport was used as a common test bed airport for the study. First, two independent simulations using the same traffic scenario were conducted: one by the DLR team using the Controller Assistance for Departure Optimization (CADEO) and the Taxi Routing for Aircraft 58; Creation and Controlling (TRACC) in a real-time simulation environment, and one by the NASA team based on the Spot and Runway Departure Advisor (SARDA) in a fast-time simulation environment. A set of common performance metrics was defined. The simulation results showed that both approaches produced operational benefits in efficiency, such as reducing taxi times, while maintaining runway throughput. Both approaches generated the gate pushback schedule to meet the runway schedule, such that the runway utilization was maximized. The conflict-free <b>taxi</b> <b>guidance</b> by TRACC helped avoid taxi conflicts and reduced taxiing stops, but the taxi benefit needed be assessed together with runway throughput to analyze the overall performance objective...|$|R
40|$|Abstract According to Sheridan and Verplank’s {{classification}} of levels of automation, taxiing on an airport {{still has a}} very low automation level. Key element for increased automation in <b>taxi</b> <b>guidance</b> is a precise and reliable navigation capability. As a Ground Based Augmentation System (GBAS) can fulfill the stringent requirements for a precision approach, it {{can play an important}} role in providing the required navigation performance during taxiing as well GBAS is a safety critical system designed to meet the requirements for both precision approach and landing, and departure operations in various visibility conditions. Consequently, the capabilities and availability of such a system give the motivation for developing new applications intended to support higher level surface operations within a local airport environment. One future application for instance, could be the use of Terminal Area Path (TAP) technique to provide routing information. TAP is the RTCA concept to enable advanced or complex procedures with GBAS. This incorporates the support of complex (i. e. laterally and vertically guided) approach, missed approach as well as departure procedures. TAP’s are incorporated in the latest RTCA LAAS ICD DO- 246 D and will be broadcasted by the GBAS ground station through the VHF data broadcast message type 4. These messages will be processed in the aircraft’s GBAS avionics system and the guidance information will be computed there. This eliminates the need for an on-board database to support these operations. The idea is to use these TAPs also for transmitting information which allows aircraft performing taxi operations. In contrast to Final Approach Segment (FAS) data blocks, TAPs will have variable lengths depending on the type of defined legs. Normally TAPs define initial fix (IF), track to fix (TF), and radius to fix (RF) legs, compatible with [1]. A TAP consists of an IF leg followed by one or more legs of other leg types. Similar to the path definition for an approach, these legs can also define a route on ground. Such a set of IF, TF, and RF are able to define a taxi route and could be transmitted via VHF broadcast on ground. Taxi trials with DLR’s A 320 research aircraft ATRA and the GBAS ground station at airport Braunschweig-Wolfsburg showed that over the whole maneuvering area the VHF signal level was adequate for transmitting such a “Ground-TAP”. These tests were performed with an antenna on the aircraft in a height of 8 ft, which is lower than the actual required coverage minimum defined in ICAO Annex 10. Together with a re-defined voice communication structure and a list of predefined routes the use of GBAS for taxi routing functionalities of an A-SMGCS is feasible. Due to the independency from an on-board database the combination of such a message broadcast and the GNSS based positioning can be the key enabler for a future auto taxiing functionality...|$|R
40|$|The future flight {{guidance}} on airports contains increasingly {{the implementation of}} planning tools for an efficient traffic control. This document describes an investigation which functionality has to be realised on the aircraft to provide a safe, weather-independent and efficient taxi procedure in accordance to the planning data. This functionality was investigated with a prototype of a <b>taxi</b> assistance and <b>guidance</b> system. The tests with line-pilots for which an own testing facility was built show {{on the one hand}} that a weather-independent and safe aircraft guidance on the ground is possible in accordance with given planning data, {{and on the other hand}} that the integration and realisation of the human-machine interface was solved properly.

40|$|In December 2008 Institute of Flight Guidance of the German Aerospace Center (DLR) {{installed}} a Ground Based Augmentation System (GBAS) manufactured by Thales Air Systems at the research airport Braunschweig-Wolfsburg in Germany. Since then, the Institute of Flight Guidance and other users have conducted many comprehensive experiments with this ground station throughout the GBAS research area. The ground station {{is part of}} the DLR air traffic validation center. It is not certified for official operations but is designed and developed according to all applicable specifications. In this setup, different flight inspection techniques were investigated with the station and new operational procedures were tested. Different aircraft were used for flight inspection as well as for operational procedure trials. This includes an Airbus A 320 research aircraft, a King Air 350 flight inspection aircraft as well as a Boeing 737 standard airliner or a Do- 128 research aircraft of the Technical University of Braunschweig. For a novel approach of verifying the contents of the GBAS message broadcast and the VHF coverage of the ground station, a helicopter (Bo- 105) was used for flight tests. Over the years, different upgrades of the GBAS ground stations were realized. This includes hardware upgrades as well as software upgrades. In terms of hardware, different GPS receivers were used as well different processor boards. The software was upgraded to not only support straight-in "ILS-look-alike"� Category I operations but also Terminal Area Paths (TAP), a functionality that allows curved path segments. In addition, prototypic software was installed to support Category II/III, so called GBAS Approach Service Type D (GAST-D) operations. Furthermore the TAP functionality will be used to transmit "Ground-TAPs"� to provide a highly accurate <b>guidance</b> for <b>taxi</b> operations during low visibility operations. Through Ground-TAPs <b>taxi</b> <b>guidance</b> is possible especially for pilots who are unfamiliar with the given airport or during adverse weather conditions. Different trials are planned to verify this idea in 2014. In this paper, a short overview about the different upgrades of the ground station as well as the operational GBAS research with the ground station will be given. This includes steep and segmented steep approaches based on GBAS and curved approaches as well as taxi operations using the TAP functionality. In addition, different performance reports of the station regarding position accuracy and VHF availability will be presented. Furthermore, the results of the helicopter flight trials regarding the VHF coverage with the low cost instrumentation will be shown and discussed in this work. To reduce integration costs, the VHF receiving equipment was integrated into a crate that was hooked as sling load to the helicopter's cargo hook. A VHF antenna was fitted onto the crate and the receiver equipment was battery powered inside the crate. With this setup, the VHF reception in the terminal area of the research airport was investigated. The VHF coverage was tested along the defined approach paths as well as symmetrically around the VHF Data Broadcast (VDB) antenna of the ground station...|$|R
40|$|Experiments {{and flight}} tests {{have shown that}} a Head-Up Display (HUD) and a head-down, {{electronic}} moving map (EMM) can be enhanced with Synthetic Vision for airport surface operations. While great success in ground operations was demonstrated with a HUD, the research noted that two major HUD limitations during ground operations were their monochrome form and limited, fixed field of regard. A potential solution to these limitations found with HUDs may be emerging Head Worn Displays (HWDs). HWDs are small, lightweight full color display devices that may be worn without significant encumbrance to the user. By coupling the HWD with a head tracker, unlimited field-of-regard may be realized for commercial aviation applications. In the proposed paper, the results of two ground simulation experiments conducted at NASA Langley are summarized. The experiments evaluated the efficacy of head-worn display applications of Synthetic Vision and Enhanced Vision technology to enhance transport aircraft surface operations. The two studies tested a combined six display concepts: (1) paper charts with existing cockpit displays, (2) baseline consisting of existing cockpit displays including a Class III electronic flight bag display of the airport surface; (3) an advanced baseline that also included displayed traffic and routing information, (4) {{a modified version of}} a HUD and EMM display demonstrated in previous research; (5) an unlimited field-of-regard, full color, head-tracked HWD with a conformal 3 -D synthetic vision surface view; and (6) a fully integrated HWD concept. The fully integrated HWD concept is a head-tracked, color, unlimited field-of-regard concept that provides a 3 -D conformal synthetic view of the airport surface integrated with advanced taxi route clearance, <b>taxi</b> precision <b>guidance,</b> and data-link capability. The results of the experiments showed that the fully integrated HWD provided greater path performance compared to using paper charts alone. Further, when comparing the HWD with the HUD concept, there were no differences in path performance. In addition, the HWD and HUD concepts were rated via paired-comparisons the same in terms of situational awareness and workload. However, there were over twice as many taxi incursion events with the HUD than the HWD...|$|R
