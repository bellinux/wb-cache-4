5|$|In this {{relatively}} liberal environment Jan accompanied the servants in their work, {{listening to their}} stories, learning {{the ways of the}} countryside, and trying to help as best he could. As his knowledge and confidence increased Jan began <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>into</b> the countryside by himself, exploring the hills and valleys which surrounded him. Later, as an older boy, his chief responsibility was as a herd — first of the pigs and poultry in the farmyard, and later of the cattle out on the veld. The same laws of custom which had preordained Jan's role as a farmer also had their beneficial aspect; Boer farmers customarily allotted their sons a share of the natural increase of the beasts under their care. As time passed Jan gradually built up a respectable holding of livestock.|$|E
25|$|During {{her early}} period she {{reported}} night time visitations by an apparition of Hor-Ra. He slowly dictated to her, over a twelve-month period, {{the story of}} her previous life. The story took up around seventy pages of cursive hieroglyphic text. It described the life of a young woman in ancient Egypt, called Bentreshyt, who had reincarnated in the person of Dorothy Eady. Bentreshyt ("Harp of Joy") is described in this text as being of humble origin, her mother a vegetable seller and her father a soldier during the reign of Seti I (c.1290 BC to 1279 BC). When she was three, her mother died, and she was placed in the temple of Kom el-Sultan because her father couldn't afford her. There, she was brought up to be a priestess. When she was twelve years old the High Priest asked her if she wished <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>into</b> the world or stay and become a consecrated virgin. In the absence of full understanding and without a practical alternative, she took the vows.|$|E
500|$|The album's first song, [...] "I Worship You" [...] was {{described}} as [...] "falling somewhere between adult contemporary and rock", and utilizes acoustic guitars and synthesizers. [...] "Here Am I" [...] relates the story {{of people who are}} not being reached by Christians, and [...] "challenges the listener <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>into</b> the world and stand up for their King". [...] "On My Way to You" [...] is a worship song, requesting [...] "wisdom, purity, and humility in our pursuit of holiness". [...] "How Great is Your Love" [...] incorporates both string and electronic instruments; Millard's vocals in the song utilize [...] "effect–laden delays". [...] "I Can Only Imagine" [...] is a ballad, opening with just piano before building to include drums and guitar. Lyrically, it asks what it will be like in Heaven, standing before God.|$|E

I have often thought since of how they must have {{regarded}} me, the newcomer being welcomed into their company standing at bar with them, and not standing for a single round of drinks.|$|R
2500|$|Another mine, which {{exploded}} on 13 February, made a 15-metre breach {{in the southwest}} wall of the citadel. [...] Captain Moulinay rushed to the threatened point with his company, halted an enemy attack, and threw the assailants back to their forward trenches. [...] The body of a French legionnaire was thrown onto the enemy parapets {{by the force of}} the explosion, and on the following night Corporal Beulin of the Legion took a party of three soldiers <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>into</b> no-man's-land and recover it.|$|E
2500|$|The company’s {{agent at}} Victoria, Edward E. Blackwood, seeing Clallam in distress, began a frantic {{effort to find}} a tug {{to go out to}} her. [...] All the Canadian {{seagoing}} tugs were absent from port, and the little harbor tugs refused <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>into</b> the gale. [...] The little Canadian steamer Iroquois was docked at Sidney, on Vancouver Island. [...] Blackwood was able to get word to the Iroquois’ master that Clallam was missing and he agreed to take his vessel out into the storm to search for her. Waves broke clear over the bridge on Iroquois. [...] Unable to find Clallam, Iroquois returned to port at midnight, or 11:00 p.m. [...] (Iroquois herself was in very serious danger during the storm, and in fact was sunk herself in similar circumstances during a storm in the Gulf Islands on April 10, 1911, with 14 people drowned.) [...] Over in Port Townsend, the dispatcher of the Puget Sound Tug Boat Company sent the tugs Sea Lion (from Seattle) and Richard Holyoke (from Port Townsend) to look for Clallam. [...] Richard Holyoke departed Port Townsend at about 7:30 p.m. Location of Clallam would prove difficult, as contrary to law, she carried no distress signal rockets.|$|E
2500|$|In 2005, he {{made the}} {{modestly}} successful Kingdom of Heaven, a film about the Crusades. The film starred Orlando Bloom, and marked Scott's first collaboration with the composer Harry Gregson-Williams. The Moroccan government sent the Moroccan cavalry as extras for some battle scenes. Unhappy with the theatrical version of Kingdom of Heaven (which he blamed on paying {{too much attention to}} the opinions of preview audiences in addition to relenting when Fox wanted 45 minutes shaved off), Scott supervised a director's cut of the film, the true version of what he wanted, which was released on DVD in 2006. The director's cut of Kingdom of Heaven has been met with critical acclaim, with Empire magazine calling the film an [...] "epic", adding: [...] "The added 45 minutes in the director’s cut are like pieces missing from a beautiful but incomplete puzzle." [...] "This is the one that should have gone out" [...] reflected Scott. Asked if he was against previewing in general in 2006, Scott stated: [...] "It depends who's in the driving seat. If you've got a lunatic doing my job, then you need to preview. But a good director should be experienced enough to judge what he thinks is the correct version <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>into</b> the cinema." ...|$|E
2500|$|Robertson later said, [...] "Eventually, [...] built {{us up to}} {{the point}} where we outgrew his music and had to leave. He shot himself in the foot, really, bless his heart, by {{sharpening}} us into such a crackerjack band that we had <b>to</b> <b>go</b> on <b>out</b> <b>into</b> the world, because we knew what his vision was for himself, and we were all younger and more ambitious musically." ...|$|R
60|$|After {{the door}} had closed, and I knew that I had looked my last on Mrs. Sherwin in this world, I {{remained}} a few minutes alone in the room, until I had steadied my mind sufficiently <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> again <b>into</b> the streets. As I walked down the garden-path to the gate, the servant whom I had seen on my entrance, ran after me, and eagerly entreated that I would wait one moment and speak to her.|$|R
50|$|This is {{a moving}} and suspenseful story about intoxicating first {{love and the}} burning love of a mother for a child.

2500|$|The Bene Gesserit {{become the}} {{consumers}} of Idaho gholas in Heretics of Dune (1984) and Chapterhouse Dune (1985). [...] However, the gholas are repeatedly assassinated after several years, and the Sisterhood suspect the Tleilaxu. Not knowing exactly what purpose Idaho will serve, the Bene Gesserit {{believe that the}} Tleilaxu are using the gholas to control the timing of his release upon the universe, implying some Tleilaxu purpose {{in addition to their}} own. [...] The current ghola survives such an attempt and Miles Teg is able to restore the memories of Duncan Idaho to the ghola, but Duncan can feel that the Tleilaxu planted something else in his mind. When Murbella, an Honored Matre, tries to sexually bond Idaho, he entraps and enslaves her, revealing the Tleilaxu purpose: To conquer the Honored Matres by using a better version of their own sexual techniques. When Murbella tries to bond Duncan, the Tleilaxu's plan comes to fruition, and he becomes aware of the memories of all the other Idaho gholas, though he is also imprinted to her. It is later determined that the Tleilaxu had mixed the cells from almost all of the Idaho gholas to make this one. Idaho and Murbella are confined to a no-ship on Chapterhouse. [...] There, Idaho trains young men <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>into</b> the universe and enslave Honored Matres. [...] Duncan also inherits an awkward prescient vision, wherein he sees an old man and woman staring back at him. Duncan restores the memories of the Miles Teg ghola, and escapes in the no-ship, evading the trap set for him by the strange couple.|$|E
2500|$|Rabbi Johanan {{called his}} {{garments}} [...] "my honor." [...] Rabbi Aha bar Abba said in Rabbi Johanan's name that [...] "And he shall put off his garments, {{and put on}} other garments," [...] teaches that a change of garments {{is an act of}} honor in the Torah. And the School of Rabbi Ishmael taught that the Torah teaches us manners: In the garments in which one cooked a dish for one's master, one should not pour a cup of wine for one's master. Rabbi Hiyya bar Abba said in Rabbi Johanan's name that it is a disgrace for a scholar <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>into</b> the marketplace with patched shoes. The Gemara objected that Rabbi Aha bar Hanina went out that way; Rabbi Aha son of Rav Nachman clarified that the prohibition is of patches upon patches. Rabbi Hiyya bar Abba also said in Rabbi Johanan's name that any scholar who has a grease stain on a garment is worthy of death, for Wisdom says in [...] "All they that hate me ( [...] , mesanne'ai) love (merit) death," [...] and we should read not , mesanne'ai, but , masni'ai (that make me hated, that is, despised). Thus a scholar who has no pride in personal appearance brings contempt upon learning. Ravina taught that this was stated about a thick patch (or others say, a bloodstain). The Gemara harmonized the two opinions by teaching that one referred to an outer garment, the other to an undergarment. Rabbi Hiyya bar Abba also said in Rabbi Johanan's name that in [...] "As my servant Isaiah walked naked and barefoot," [...] "naked" [...] means in worn-out garments, and [...] "barefoot" [...] means in patched shoes.|$|E

All his life he had thought in millions where the prudent man would have been content with hundreds. An inexhaustible fount of optimism bubbled eternally within him.

5000|$|The diocese should {{appreciate}} {{the magnitude of}} her present opportunity.

He was disappointed at Beckjord's continued lack of evidence and attributed Beckjord's interpretations of rock formations, leaves and shadows as Bigfoot faces or skulls to [...] "the workings of an overzealous imagination." ...|$|R
