5|$|In Belgium, {{the growth}} of the {{religion}} quickly begin to slow down, even to decline, as indicated by <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>no</b> temple has been built since 1968 and that several of them are currently unused {{because of a lack of}} dressed members and/or money.

5|$|In June 1967, the Department of the Interior {{made its}} final {{recommendation}} {{and suggested that}} the dam not be built.

5|$|Although Kwee was {{a staunch}} {{supporter}} of realism in literature, Drama dari Krakatau includes {{a degree of}} mysticism, {{as evidenced by the}} apparent connection between the statue in the cave and the eruption of Krakatoa. Indeed, in many of his writings (both fiction and non-fiction), Kwee exhibited an interest in the occult; this includes writing detailed depictions of Therese Neumann, a fasting girl from Germany; and Omar Khayyám, a Persian Sufi mystic, philosopher and poet. The Indonesian literary critic Jakob Sumardjo finds the mystical elements (and <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>no</b> Hindu-era statues with inscriptions have been found) detract from the overall value of the novel.|$|E

5|$|Because of the {{possible}} single-egg clutch and the bird's large size, it has been proposed that the dodo was K-selected, meaning that it produced a low number of altricial offspring, which required parental care until they matured. Some evidence, including the large size {{and the fact that}} tropical and frugivorous birds have slower growth rates, indicates that the bird may have had a protracted development period. <b>The</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>no</b> juvenile dodos have been found in the Mare aux Songes swamp may indicate that they produced little offspring, that they matured rapidly, that the breeding grounds were far away from the swamp, or that the risk of miring was seasonal.|$|E
5|$|Critics {{also pointed}} out that the index could allow the city to reach lethally high levels of carbon {{monoxide}} without any alert if the levels of other pollutants remained low. However, the department had to contend with <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>no</b> universally accepted standards for recording smog existed at that time, and many of the flaws existed {{for lack of a better}} alternative.

5|$|Furthermore, {{in their}} 1987 sequel The Messianic Legacy, Lincoln, Baigent and Leigh {{suggested}} {{that there was a}} current conflict between the Priory of Sion and the Sovereign Military Order of Malta, which they speculated might have originated from an earlier rivalry between the Knights Templar and Knights Hospitaller during the Crusades. However, for the dramatic structure of The Da Vinci Code, Brown chose the controversial Roman Catholic prelature Opus Dei as the Assassini-like nemesis of the Priory of Sion, despite <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>no</b> author had ever argued that there is a conflict between these two groups.|$|E

5|$|John of Worcester, {{a medieval}} chronicler, stated that Ealdred crowned King Harold II in 1066, {{although}} the Norman chroniclers mention Stigand as the officiating prelate. Given Ealdred's known support of Godwin's family, John of Worcester is probably correct. Stigand's position as archbishop was canonically suspect, and as earl Harold had not allowed Stigand to consecrate {{one of the}} earl's churches, {{it is unlikely that}} Harold would have allowed Stigand to perform the much more important royal coronation. Arguments for Stigand having performed the coronation, however, rely on <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>no</b> other English source names the ecclesiastic who performed the ceremony; all Norman sources name Stigand as the presider. In all events, Ealdred and Harold were close, and Ealdred supported Harold's bid to become king. Ealdred perhaps accompanied Harold when the new king went to York and secured the support of the northern magnates shortly after Harold's consecration.|$|E
5|$|Named to the see of Canterbury in 735, Nothhelm was consecrated {{the same}} year. Pope Gregory III {{sent him a}} pallium in 736. He may have been {{appointed}} by Æthelbald, King of Mercia, whose councilor he was. Whether or not he owed his appointment to Æthelbald, Nothhelm {{was one of a}} number of Mercians who became Archbishop of Canterbury during the 730s and 740s, during a time of expanding Mercian influence. He held a synod in 736 or 737, which drew nine bishops; the meeting adjudicated a dispute over the ownership of a monastery located at Withington. A significant feature of this synod was <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>no</b> king attended, but yet the synod still rendered judgement in the ownership even without secular oversight, which was more usual.|$|E
5|$|In November2011, {{the first}} officially {{designated}} Mediterranean tropical cyclone by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) formed, christened as 01M by the Satellite Analysis Branch {{and given the}} name Rolf by the Free University of Berlin (FU Berlin), despite <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>no</b> agency is officially responsible for monitoring tropical cyclone activity in the Mediterranean. On 4November 2011, a frontal system associated with another low-pressure area monitored by FU Berlin, designated Quinn, spawned a second low-pressure system inland near Marseille, which was subsequently named Rolf by the university. An upper-level trough on the European mainland stalled as it approached the Pyrenees before approaching and interacting with the low known as Rolf. Heavy rainfall consequently fell over regions of southern France and northwestern Italy, resulting in widespread landslides and flooding. On 5November, Rolf slowed while stationed above the Massif Central, maintaining a pressure of 1000mbar (29.53inHg). A stationary front, stationed between Madrid and Lisbon, approached Rolf the same day, with the cold front later encountering and become associated with Rolf, which would continue for several days.|$|E

5|$|Much of the {{material}} written about her was aimed at children, and {{tended to focus on}} her childhood and early career. Much of it was also highly romanticised and not always historically accurate. She has been referenced in several historical novels, most notably in The French Lieutenant's Woman (1969) by John Fowles, who was critical of <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>no</b> British scientist had named a species after her in her lifetime. As her biographer, Shelley Emling, noted, this contrasted with some of the prominent geologists who had used her finds, such as William Buckland and Roderick Murchison, who ended up with multiple fossil species named after them. The only person who did name a species after her during her lifetime was the Swiss-American naturalist, Louis Agassiz. In the early 1840s, he named two fossil fish species after her—Acrodus anningiae, and Belenostomus anningiae—and another after her friend Elizabeth Philpot. Agassiz was grateful for the help the women had given him in examining fossil fish specimens during his visit to Lyme Regis in 1834. After her death, other species, including the ostracod Cytherelloidea anningi, and two genera, the therapsid reptile genus Anningia, and the bivalve mollusc genus Anningella, were named in her honour. In 2012, the plesiosaur genus Anningasaura was named for her, and the species Ichthyosaurus anningae was named for her in 2015.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} men present at the battle is disputed. A major factor in this is <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>no</b> primary sources give the {{number of men}} present at the battle, which leaves modern historians to {{estimate}} {{the number of men}}. Historian Leo de Hartog gives the size of the Rus' army as 30,000, while Richard Gabriel and Hector Hugh Munro claim that the size of the Rus' army was 80,000.* de Hartog, Genghis Khan: Conqueror of the World, 120* Munro, The Rise of the Russian Empire, p. 81. de Hartog also estimates the size of the Mongol army as 20,000, while Gabriel estimates that it was around 23,000 men.* de Hartog, Genghis Khan: Conqueror of the World, p. 118. However, historian John Fennell, an expert on Kievan Rus and early Russian history, and one well-versed in the primary sources, calls many of these figures into doubt, saying the numbers given in the Russian sources (there are no Mongol or Polovtsian sources, at least none that have survived, and other sources from other cultures, if they exist, are rather dubious) are formulaic or exaggerated and the chronicles contradict themselves. The information given in the Novgorod First Chronicle and the Primary Chronicle would imply a total of 11,000 soldiers for the Rus' forces, but Fennel considers even these numbers to be exaggerations. While Russian historians in the Soviet era have traditionally given estimates of around 80,000-100,000, modern Russian historians have taken a revisionist stance with a consensus settling on drastically lower numbers, with the Mongols having a numerical advantage. Russian historian D.G. Khrustalev estimated in 2013 that the Rus' army consisted of 10,000 soldiers (including mercenaries), while the Cumans brought 5,000 cavalry, for a total of 15,000.Khrustalev, p. 416 Carl Sverdrup estimates the army at 8,000, and says 30,000 and 80,000 are enormous exaggerations. The Mongols evidently believed it was a considerable force, given the extreme lengths the Mongols went to dislocate its formations.|$|E
