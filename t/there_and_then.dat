5|$|Check's 1st Battalion was not {{attacked}} until 06:30 on July 24, {{shortly after}} daybreak {{in a heavy}} fog that allowed the North Koreans to approach {{very close to the}} US positions before they were observed. Two US infantry companies {{on either side of the}} road on low ridges held the forward positions. North Korean mortar fire fell on the men <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> T-34 tanks appeared at the bend in the road and opened fire with their main cannons and machine guns as they approached. North Korean infantry followed the tanks. Although the two rifle companies stopped the North Korean infantry, the tanks penetrated their positions and fired into the battalion command post which was behind B Company. This tank fire destroyed several vehicles and killed the medical officer. A company commander knocked out one tank but was injured in the process.|$|E

She made one trip to Dunkirk during the night of 28/29 May and was caught in Dunkirk harbour by German Stukas during the following day. Grenade was hit by two bombs which set her afire and killed 14 sailors and mortally wounded another four men. The ship was cast off from her berth, in case she sank <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> drifted into the harbour channel. The trawler John Cattling towed Grenade over to the west side of the outer harbour where her magazines exploded later that evening.|$|E
