The rope to hang the pot was {{wrapped around the}} edges of the side collar, it is believed that the rope was tied tightly to the pot, allowing the pot to spin in circles, due to the spinning motion, several theories have been made of the use of the pots. It is believed that the smaller hanging pots were used to ferment alcohol, by use of the seeds of <b>touch-me-not</b> <b>balsam</b> (Impatiens noli-tangere), and the larger hanging pots were used to churn butter and make cheese. They were cattle breeders, and as such required salt in order to preserve their meat, however, the Iazyges had no salt mines within their land. According to Dio, the Iazyges received grain from the Romans.|$|E

Many dicotyledons also occur, {{such as water}} mint (Mentha aquatica), gipsywort (Lycopus europaeus), skull-cap (Scutellaria species), <b>touch-me-not</b> <b>balsam</b> (Impatiens noli-tangere), brooklime (Veronica beccabunga) and water forget-me-nots (Myosotis species).|$|E

50|$|Impatiens balfourii is {{a species}} of the genus Impatiens known by the common names Balfour's <b>touch-me-not,</b> Kashmir <b>balsam,</b> and poor man's orchid. It belongs to the family Balsaminaceae.|$|R
50|$|Impatiens sodenii is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} plant in the family Balsaminaceae known by the common names poor man's rhododendron, Oliver's <b>touch-me-not,</b> and shrub <b>balsam.</b> It is native to Kenya and Tanzania. It is widely cultivated as an ornamental plant.|$|R

50|$|In the 19th and 20th centuries, humans transported {{the orange}} jewelweed (I. capensis) to England, France, the Netherlands, Poland, Sweden, Finland, and {{potentially}} {{other areas of}} Northern and Central Europe. For example, it was not recorded from Germany as recently as 1996, but since then a population has naturalized in Hagen at the Ennepe River. The orange jewelweed is quite similar to the <b>touch-me-not</b> <b>balsam</b> (I. noli-tangere), the only Impatiens species native to Central and Northern Europe, and it utilizes similar habitats, but no evidence exists of natural hybrids between them. Small balsam (I. parviflora), originally native to southern Central Asia, is even more extensively naturalized in Europe. More problematic is the Himalayan balsam (I. glandulifera), a densely growing species which displaces smaller plants by denying them sunlight. It is an invasive weed in many places, and tends to dominate riparian vegetation along polluted rivers and nitrogen-rich spots. Thus, it exacerbates ecosystem degradation by forming stands where few other plants can grow, and by rendering riverbanks more prone to erosion, as it has only a shallow root system.|$|E
40|$|The netted carpet Eustroma reticulatum is a {{vulnerable}} British moth, dependent as a larva on <b>touch-me-not</b> <b>balsam</b> Impatiens noli-tangere which is itself rare {{as a native}} plant in the British Isles. We review {{the status of the}} moth in Great Britain: it has been recorded from the Lake District since 1856 and sporadically from North Wales, but has had several periods of very low abundance when it was suspected of being extinct. The results of a survey in 1990 of Lake District sites for this month and a survey in 1991 of potential North Wales sites are presented and compared with Lake District surveys in 1955 and 1980 / 81. Although the moth increased in numbers between 1955 and 1980, the number of sites in which it now occurs has fallen by 56 %â€”to below 1955 levels. The moth is present in one North Wales site. Threats to colonies and management requirements of moth and foodplant are discussed. Trial management is being carried out by the National Trust in the Lake District...|$|E
50|$|Impatiens capensis, {{the orange}} jewelweed, common jewelweed, spotted jewelweed, spotted <b>touch-me-not,</b> or orange <b>balsam,</b> is an annual plant native to North America. It {{is common in}} {{bottomland}} soils, ditches, and along creeks, often growing side-by-side with its less common relative, Yellow Jewelweed (I. pallida).|$|R
