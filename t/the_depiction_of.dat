5|$|The most searing {{criticism}} of the American prison system was reserved for <b>the</b> <b>depiction</b> <b>of</b> Southern chain gangs, with I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang being {{by far the most}} influential.|$|E
5|$|The {{theme of}} {{swimming}} through flames {{is connected to}} <b>the</b> <b>depiction</b> <b>of</b> Guido Guinizelli, a poet who influenced Dante, seeking such a state in Purgatorio XXVI. However, <b>the</b> <b>depiction</b> <b>of</b> swimming was transformed into an image of dancing, an act that appears throughout Yeats's poetry, within purgatorial flames. The critic Dominic Manganiello suggests that, in combining the image of dancing with purgation, Eliot merges Dante's and Yeats's poetic themes.|$|E
25|$|The Catholic {{approach}} to Marian art is quite {{distinct from the}} way other Christians (such as the Protestant and the Eastern Orthodox) treat <b>the</b> <b>depictions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Virgin Mary. From {{the very beginning of}} the Protestant Reformation its leaders expressed their discomfort with <b>the</b> <b>depictions</b> <b>of</b> saints in general. While over time a Protestant tradition <b>of</b> art developed, <b>the</b> <b>depictions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Virgin Mary within it have remained minimal, given that most Protestants reject Marian veneration and view it as a Catholic excess.|$|R

5|$|A god {{standing}} on or {{seated on a}} pattern of scales is a typical scenery for <b>the</b> <b>depiction</b> <b>of</b> a theophany. It is associated with gods who have some connection with mountains but not restricted to any one deity in particular.|$|E
5|$|As {{with all}} of his Brushstrokes works, it is in part a satirical {{response}} to the gestural painting of Abstract Expressionism. Like most of Lichtenstein's Ben-Day dots works it is a depiction of mechanical reproduction via painterly technique. In this case, the satire comes from <b>the</b> <b>depiction</b> <b>of</b> the graphical depiction of the spontaneous painting motion in painstaking painterly detail.|$|E
5|$|General life {{themes are}} portrayed on wall panels {{such as the}} way horses were reined, the type of stirrup used, <b>the</b> <b>depiction</b> <b>of</b> dancers, musicians, instrumentalists, and rows of animals such as lions and {{elephants}} (where no two animals are identical). Perhaps no other temple in the country depicts the Ramayana and Mahabharata epics more effectively than the Hoysaleshwara temple at Halebidu.|$|E

5|$|Japanese {{sculpture}} {{experienced a}} renaissance during the Kamakura period, {{led by the}} Kei school. Partially influenced by Song dynasty China, their sculpture is characterised by realism featuring elaborate top knots, jewelry, and wavy drapery. Although predominantly wooden, bronze was also used as a material for the statues. As a novelty, portrait sculptures of prominent monks were created adjacent to <b>the</b> <b>depiction</b> <b>of</b> Buddhist deities.|$|E
5|$|Pterosaurs {{have been}} a staple of popular culture {{for as long as}} their cousins the dinosaurs, though they are usually not {{featured}} as prominently in films, literature or other art. Additionally, while <b>the</b> <b>depiction</b> <b>of</b> dinosaurs in popular media has changed radically in response to advances in paleontology, a mainly outdated picture of pterosaurs has persisted since the mid 20th century.|$|E
5|$|The Hood {{event was}} the {{inspiration}} for the 2006 Turkish action film Valley of the Wolves Iraq.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>depiction</b> <b>of</b> Judith and Holofernes has {{an equally}} gruesome detail. As Judith loads the enemy's head onto a basket carried by her maid and covers {{it with a}} cloth, she looks towards the tent, {{apparently}} distracted by the limbs of the decapitated corpse flailing about.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>depiction</b> <b>of</b> Mars {{in fiction}} has been stimulated by its {{dramatic}} red color and by nineteenth century scientific speculations that its surface conditions might support not just life but intelligent life. Thus originated {{a large number}} of science fiction scenarios, among which is H. G. Wells' The War of the Worlds, published in 1898, in which Martians seek to escape their dying planet by invading Earth.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>depiction</b> <b>of</b> the galero in arms {{can vary}} greatly {{depending}} on the artist's style. The top of the hat may be shown flat or round. Sometimes the brim is shown much narrower; with a domed top it can look like a cappello romano with tassels, but in heraldry it is still called a galero. The tassels may be represented as knotted cords.|$|E

50|$|In Middle Eastern culture, both Arab and Persian, {{the lion}} is {{regarded}} as the symbol of courage, bravery, royalty, and chivalry. <b>The</b> Middle Eastern <b>depiction</b> <b>of</b> lions are derived from earlier Mesopotamian Babylonian and Persian arts. Islamic art commonly manifests its aesthetic elements only in Islamic calligraphy, floral, and geometric decorative patterns, since Islamic tradition forbid <b>the</b> <b>depictions</b> <b>of</b> humans and living creatures (animals) in its arts, both paintings or sculpture. Through Persian arts miniatures and paintings, however, <b>the</b> <b>depictions</b> <b>of</b> humans and animals survives. In Muslim Spain period, the lion court of Alhambra palace displays the lion statues as supporters and waterspout of fountain.|$|R

5|$|The {{traditional}} attribution to Droeshout {{the younger}} {{can also be}} supported on stylistic grounds. A drawing known to be by Droeshout the elder appears to show superior artistic skill than {{the work of his}} nephew, and the clumsy features of <b>the</b> <b>depiction</b> <b>of</b> Shakespeare's body resemble other prints by Droeshout the Younger. The attribution to the younger artist is provisionally accepted by the National Portrait Gallery.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} early van der Weyden {{depictions of the}} Madonna, her head is {{slightly}} too large for her body. Her dress is creased and almost paper-like. However, the description of her lap contains inconsistencies also in Campin's Virgin and Child before a Firescreen; it appears to lack volume and is if she had only one leg. This seems to reflect an early difficulty both with foreshortening and in <b>the</b> <b>depiction</b> <b>of</b> a body under clothing.|$|E
5|$|Britomart Redeems Faire Amoret is an oil {{painting}} on canvas by English artist William Etty, first exhibited in 1833 {{and now in}} Tate Britain. Intended to illustrate the virtues of honour and chastity, it depicts a scene from Edmund Spenser's The Faerie Queene in which the female warrior Britomart slays the evil magician Busirane and frees his captive, the beautiful Amoret. In Spenser's original poem Amoret has been tortured and mutilated {{by the time of}} her rescue, but Etty disliked <b>the</b> <b>depiction</b> <b>of</b> violence and portrayed her as unharmed.|$|E

5|$|Congress {{approved}} {{legislation for}} the coin on March 31, 1936, authorizing 15,000 pieces {{to be struck}} at the three mints then in operation. Melish had hired sculptor Constance Ortmayer to design the coin, but the Commission of Fine Arts refused to recommend the designs. Members objected to <b>the</b> <b>depiction</b> <b>of</b> Stephen Foster on the obverse, finding no connection between Foster, who died in 1864, and the supposed anniversary. Nevertheless, the designs were approved by the Bureau of the Mint, and 5,000 sets from the three mints were issued and sold to Melish's group, the only authorized purchaser.|$|E
5|$|Don't Look Now {{is renowned}} for its {{innovative}} editing style and its use of recurring motifs and themes and for a controversial sex scene that was explicit for its time. The film often employs flashbacks and flashforwards in keeping with <b>the</b> <b>depiction</b> <b>of</b> precognition, but some scenes are intercut or merged to alter the viewer's perception of what is really happening. It adopts an impressionist approach to its imagery, often presaging events with familiar objects, patterns and colours using associative editing techniques.|$|E
5|$|First Class entered {{production}} in August 2010, with principal photography concluding in December and additional filming finishing in April 2011, {{just a few}} weeks before the film's premiere in June 2011. The tight schedule proved a challenge to the six companies responsible for the extensive visual effects, which included computer-generated sets and digital doubles for the actors. Locations included Oxford, the Mojave desert and Georgia, with soundstage work done in both Pinewood Studios and the 20th Century Fox stages in Los Angeles. <b>The</b> <b>depiction</b> <b>of</b> the 1960s drew inspiration from the James Bond films of the period.|$|E
