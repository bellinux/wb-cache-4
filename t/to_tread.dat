5|$|Ideologically, al-Mu'tasim {{followed}} {{the footsteps of}} al-Ma'mun, continuing his predecessor's support for Mu'tazilism, a theological doctrine that attempted <b>to</b> <b>tread</b> a middle way between secular monarchy and the theocratic nature of rulership espoused by the Alids and the various sects of Shi'ism. Mu'tazilis espoused {{the view that the}} Quran was created and hence fell within the authority of a God-guided imām to interpret according to the changing circumstances. While revering Ali, they avoided taking a position on the righteousness of the opposing sides in the conflict between Ali and his opponents. Mu'tazilism was officially adopted by al-Ma'mun in 827, and in 833, shortly before his death, al-Ma'mun made its doctrines compulsory, with the establishment of an inquisition, the miḥna. During his brother's reign, al-Mu'tasim played {{an active role in the}} enforcement of the miḥna in the western provinces, and continued on the same course after his accession: the chief advocate of Mu'tazilism, the head qādī Ahmad ibn Abi Duwad, was perhaps the dominant influence at the caliphal court throughout al-Mu'tasim's reign.|$|E

He inspired many young people <b>to</b> <b>tread</b> the boards and produced pantomimes, adult and children's shows. His wife Mary produced numerous costumes for the shows and, despite sanctions, always managed to come up trumps.|$|E
25|$|Inner tube {{water polo}} is {{a style of}} water polo in which players, {{excluding}} the goalkeeper, are required to float in inner tubes. By floating in an inner tube players expend less energy than traditional water polo players, not having <b>to</b> <b>tread</b> water. This allows casual players to enjoy water polo without undertaking the intense conditioning required for conventional water polo.|$|E

25|$|In an {{era when}} women had <b>to</b> <b>tread</b> {{carefully}} in society's orbit, Seward struck a middle ground. In her work, Seward could be alternately arch and teasing, as in her poem entitled Portrait of Miss Levett, {{on the subject of}} a Lichfield beauty later married to Rev. Richard Levett. She contributed to Boswell's Life of Samuel Johnson (1791) but was not particularly happy with the way her material was treated by Boswell. Her work was widely circulated.|$|E

He then recorded two albums for Atlantic Records, 1981's Coup de Grâce—on which Jack Nitzsche returned as producer—and 1983's Where Angels Fear <b>to</b> <b>Tread.</b> Both sold well in Europe but fared less well in the United States. Coup de Grâce was DeVille's last album ever to enter the Billboard 200, peaking at number 161.|$|E
25|$|As {{an aspect}} of their trade, the Ursari have {{established}} and encouraged various folk beliefs and customs involving the bear; these include displaying bears in the courtyards of village houses {{as a means to}} protect livestock from attack by smaller wild animals, and călcătura ursului ("the bear step") or călcătura lui Moş Martin ("Old Boy Martin's step", based on a common nickname for the animal), which involves allowing bears <b>to</b> <b>tread</b> on a person's back (in the belief that it can ensure the fertility of young people or chase away evil spirits).|$|E

25|$|The type of {{railroad}} tie {{used on the}} predecessors of the first true railway (Liverpool and Manchester Railway) consisted {{of a pair of}} stone blocks laid into the ground, with the chairs holding the rails fixed to those blocks. One advantage of this method of construction was that it allowed horses <b>to</b> <b>tread</b> the middle path without the risk of tripping. In railway use with ever heavier locomotives, it was found that it was hard to maintain the correct gauge. The stone blocks were in any case unsuitable on soft ground, such as at Chat Moss, where timber ties had to be used. Bi-block ties with a tie rod are somewhat similar.|$|E
25|$|Pepe {{incorporates}} {{some elements}} of traditional winemaking, including crushing his organically grown grapes by foot similar to the traditional Port wine tradition of using a large stone vats called lagares <b>to</b> <b>tread</b> on wine grapes. He also shuns {{the use of any}} fining and filtration aids as well as the use of the sulfur dioxide for preserving and protecting the wine oxidation. However, instead of using oak barrels or stainless steel fermentation tanks, Pepe ferments and ages everything in glass (from using glass lined fermentation vessels, to storing the wine in bottles). When the wines are ready to be released, they are decanted off their sediments and repackaged in a new wine bottle.|$|E
25|$|Hertzog {{decided to}} retire {{as leader of}} the HNP in 1977, and gave his {{farewell}} address on 27 May of that year. He officially retired on 28 May 1977, and was followed by Jaap Marais as party leader. During his retirement, Hertzog could devote more time to his numerous business endeavors and his hobby of gardening. In a press interview in 1979 he opined as follows: “In my view our political landscape is developing {{in the direction of a}} large, new conservative party which will consist of different people who are still currently trying <b>to</b> <b>tread</b> their own path. It can be a party consisting of the Treurnicht people in the NP, the Connie Mulder people, the HNP and definitely also conservative English speakers.” This proved to be prophetic, as in 1982 a massive split occurred within the ruling National Party, and the Conservative Party came into being, with Andries Treurnicht as leader.|$|E

25|$|International {{experts have}} also {{weighed in on}} the controversies {{surrounding}} Brazil’s nuclear program. Hans Rühle, a former official from the German defense ministry who also worked with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) wrote an article in 2010 in which he indicated that Brazil {{might be on the}} path toward getting the bomb. He based his argument on the submarine project, which may involve the production of highly enriched uranium, and the fact that Brazil seeks to develop capacity to conduct all phases of the nuclear fuel cycle indigenously. While Rühle affirms that there is no hard proof of a nuclear weapons program in Brazil, he suggests that Brazil’s relations with Iran and defense of the Iranian nuclear program should be seen as a clue of the path Brazil wants <b>to</b> <b>tread.</b> Commenting on Rühle’s article, the Argentine scholars Federico Merke and Florencia Montal said that Brazil might develop the capacity to manufacture a bomb but that it didn’t seem to have the intention to do so.|$|E
25|$|The Tamil people practiced a very {{systematic}} {{method of}} cultivation during the Sangam age. It was known that ploughing, manuring, weeding, irrigation and crop protection {{need to be}} followed in a proper way for the yield to be rich. Tiruvalluvar, in his Tirukkural, emphasizes the need {{for all of these}} steps to be undertaken in a careful manner {{in order to get a}} good yield. A paddy field was also known as Kalam and was ploughed with the help of oxen. Ploughed lands were leveled by the peasants using their feet, followed by the planting of the paddy seeds. Once the seeds grew into saplings, they were transplanted and when the crop was mature, it was harvested. Weeds were removed periodically. Paddy was removed from the harvested stalks by beating on the ground or by getting bullocks <b>to</b> <b>tread</b> on them. Cleared paddy was collected, measured and stored in proper containers. Millets were grown on the Pinpulam or the dry lands and in the Kurinji region. Crop rotation was followed – for instance, cotton and millets were grown simultaneously on the same plot and after that, beans were cultivated on it.|$|E
25|$|After Lazarus {{had checked}} her gun {{and come to}} the {{interrogation}} room, they explained that this was really about some loose ends they were trying to tie up in the Rasmussen case, since her name had come up in the investigation. They claimed they wanted a private setting because while Ruetten was an old boyfriend, she was long married to someone else and did not want her private life to become the subject of office gossip. Stearns and Jaramillo knew they would have <b>to</b> <b>tread</b> carefully since Lazarus herself was well aware of police interview techniques and her rights to silence and legal counsel, which she could invoke at any time. They rambled and digressed from the subject at times, sometimes discussing unrelated police business, but eventually came back to Rasmussen. Lazarus claimed to recall little due to the intervening years, but gradually revealed more and more knowledge—including oblique acknowledgements of her visits to the Ruetten condo—until she accused her colleagues of considering her a suspect, whereupon they allowed that there was DNA evidence connecting her to the crime scene and she was free to go. She left the room and was immediately arrested and charged with the murder.|$|E

25|$|His time as Viceroy {{was marked}} with {{consistent}} calls for self-government, which Chelmsford agreed to, convincing a preoccupied Foreign Office {{to send the}} Secretary of State for India, Edwin Samuel Montagu, to discuss the potential for reform. Together they oversaw {{the implementation of the}} Montagu-Chelmsford reforms, which gave greater authority to local Indian representative bodies and paved the way for a free India. Trying <b>to</b> <b>tread</b> a fine line between reform and maintaining the British hold over India, Chelmsford passed repressive anti-terrorism laws to widespread opposition from Indian reformists. The laws sparked unrest in the Punjab, culminating in the implementation of martial law in the region and the Amritsar Massacre by General Reginald Dyer on 13 April 1919. Initially supportive of Dyer and slow to respond to the massacre, following a ruling condemning Dyers actions, Chelmsford eventually disciplined Dyer. This was however, seen by Indian Nationalists as too little, too late and the Indian National Congress boycotted the first regional elections in 1920. In addition to this, the Third Anglo-Afghan War broke out and Gandhi started his first campaign. On his return to Britain on 15 June 1921, he was elevated to Viscount as 1st Viscount Chelmsford of Chelmsford, County of Essex.|$|E
500|$|The trial {{opened on}} 20 August 1945. Quisling's defence rested on downplaying his unity with Germany and {{stressing}} {{that he had}} fought for total independence, something that seemed completely contrary to the recollections of many Norwegians. From that point on, wrote biographer Dahl, Quisling had <b>to</b> <b>tread</b> a [...] "fine line between truth and falsehood," [...] and emerged from it [...] "an elusive and often pitiful figure." [...] He misrepresented the truth on several occasions and the entirely truthful majority of his statements won him few advocates {{in the country at}} large, where he remained almost universally despised.|$|E
500|$|Leaving school, young William Taswell {{stood on}} Westminster Stairs {{a mile away}} {{and watched as the}} flames crept round the cathedral and the burning {{scaffolding}} ignited the timbered roof beams.

500|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, the Republic of China (Taiwan) Air Force {{started looking for}} a fighter {{aircraft}} to match improvements made in mainland People's Republic of China (PRC)'s air force. In particular, they wanted a platform capable of firing the AIM-7 Sparrow long-range missile. At the time, the US {{was in the process}} of opening up ties with the People's Republic of China after President Nixon's famous visit in 1972. China considered US support of Taiwan against their interests, and the US State Department wanted <b>to</b> <b>tread</b> carefully. They blocked export of all of the AIM-7 capable aircraft, even otherwise outdated early models of the McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II. The State Department suggested the Israeli IAI Kfir instead; however, it was rejected. [...] Taiwan was already producing the F-5E under license, so the Department of Defense asked Northrop to study adding an AIM-7 capable radar to the Tiger II as an alternative. This effort became the first of several F-5G studies.|$|E
500|$|Stylistically, {{the album}} has been {{described}} by Allrovi's Jason Lymangrover as ranging [...] "from Frank Sinatra pop to psychedelic garage rock"; while The Boston Globe James Reed has noted the [...] "spare" [...] sound of [...] "Scalinatella" [...] and the [...] "furious and rocking" [...] pace of [...] "Urlo Negro". Although wanting to remain faithful to the original versions of the songs covered, Patton wished to avoid simply mimicking the original recordings, stating [...] "this is a record of covers, and I believe firmly that you have to make them your own. There is a very fine line <b>to</b> <b>tread.</b> You have to treat a song with respect, yet twist it up, fuck it up and somehow make it a part of your own voice".

500|$|The {{episode was}} the first to feature flashbacks with Sayid, an Arab character. The {{producers}} knew they had <b>to</b> <b>tread</b> carefully with the character due to possible prejudices against Arabs. The actor, Naveen Andrews, said, [...] "we were all pretty nervous, {{in the sense that we}} all felt we owed a real obligation, not just to Iraqis but the entire Arab world about how this character would be played." [...] In an early draft of [...] "Solitary", Rousseau told Sayid that she and her research team were studying time. When ABC saw this draft, they asked the producers to remove this line, explaining that they did not want the show to venture into science fiction during the first season. The character of Sullivan, to whose medical woes Jack tended, was created to make the rest of the survivors think that Rousseau's team was killed by an illness. The idea for Hurley's golf course came from script coordinator Brent Fletcher; it was based on a miniature golf course he created in the offices for the television show Angel.|$|E
