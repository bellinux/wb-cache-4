Objecting, Thing attacks Doom out of anger, but the fight was stopped by Mister Fantastic and the Invisible Woman, who welcomes Victor to their group. When Valeria asks Victor if he has a backup for restoring his memories, he reveals that Kristoff Vernard is his backup. Afterward, Mister Fantastic, Spider-Man, Nathaniel, Valeria, and Victor head to Latveria to meet with Kristoff and request his help. Mister Fantastic sets up a brain <b>transfer</b> <b>machine</b> in order to help restore Victor's memories and knowledge, which is successful. When Kristoff wants to return the throne to him, Doom states that it is not time yet because of a promise he made to Valeria. When Mister Fantastic asks what promise Doom made to Valeria, Victor states that he made a promise to help her defeat Mister Fantastic when she calls for it. Doom decides to hold a symposium on how to finally defeat Reed Richards. The Thing and the evolved Moloids give an invitation to the High Evolutionary. Dragon Man and Alex Power give an invitation to Diablo. Upon receiving an invitation from Spider-Man, Mad Thinker is convinced to take part in the event. Bentley 23 even gives an invitation to his creator, the Wizard, along with two A.I.M. lieutenants. However, it is subsequently revealed that the 'Richards' they have been invited to defeat are actually members of the [...] "Council of Reeds" [...] (alternate versions of Reed who were trapped in this universe by Valeria a while back, possessing Reed's intellect while lacking his conscience). While Spider-Man and Invisible Woman make sandwiches for the kids, Mister Fantastic, Victor, Valeria, and Nathaniel Richards meet with the supervillain geniuses and Uatu the Watcher about what to do with the Council of Reeds.|$|E

50|$|The idea of {{the first}} hand-transfer {{machining}} line, which was operated by 21 men, evolved in 1923. Then, in 1924, the first automated <b>transfer</b> <b>machine</b> was introduced {{for the production of}} gearbox cases, which were moved from station to station by compressed air. A second automated <b>transfer</b> <b>machine,</b> for the production of flywheels, was also set up in 1924. These machines were something Morris Engines Ltd. were justifiably proud of and they encouraged the public to see the process. American engineers judged the production systems to be 20 years ahead of their time.|$|E

A consumer-oriented Steadicam unit designed for small mini DV cameras was added to the Steadicam line. The Steadicam Jr. incorporated an 8-layer non-glare LCD video monitor comparable to the professional Steadicam rigs. The Steadicam line became the company's leading marketable product. Tiffen Filter bought the rights to make the Steadicam when Cinema Products Corporation went out of business in 2000.|$|E

50|$|An {{important}} part of the 4CV's success was due to the new methodologies used in its manufacture, pioneered by Pierre Bézier. Bézier had begun his 42-year tenure at Renault as a tool setter, moving up to tool designer and then becoming head of the Tool Design Office. As Director of Production Engineering in 1949, he designed the transfer lines (or <b>transfer</b> <b>machines)</b> producing most of the mechanical parts for the 4CV. The <b>transfer</b> <b>machines</b> were high-performance work tools designed to machine engine blocks. While imprisoned during World War II, Bézier developed and improved on the automatic machine principle, introduced before the war by General Motors (GM). The new transfer station with multiple workstations and electromagnetic heads (antecedents to robots), enabled different operations on a single part to be consecutively performed by transferring the part from one station to another.|$|R

The center lane in the bridge is reversible; the middle barrier is moved with a barrier <b>transfer</b> <b>machine.</b> The bridge is {{named in honor of}} Theodore Roosevelt, the 26th President of the United States.|$|E
50|$|Rotary {{transfer}} machines {{are commonly used}} for mass-production of metal parts in the automotive industry and for pneumatic and hydraulic fittings. The parts can range from simple to complex, depending on {{the layout of the}} machining tool, which is often custom designed for manufacturing of a single part or family of parts. Rotary arrangement presents a compact arrangement which saves floor space. Annual production capacity of one rotary <b>transfer</b> <b>machine</b> can range from 100'000 units to tens of millions of units.|$|E

A barrier <b>transfer</b> <b>machine</b> is used to move the concrete barrier.

30|$|The {{transferring}} cost of each machine type {{between two}} periods is known. All machine types {{can be moved}} to the machine depot or any location in the cells. Even if a machine is removed from or returned to the cells, this transferring cost is incurred. This cost is paid for several situations: (1) to install a new purchased machine or a machine returned from the machine depot; (2) to uninstall a machine removed from a cell and kept in the machine depot; and (3) to <b>transfer</b> a <b>machine</b> between two different locations. <b>Transferring</b> <b>machine</b> contains uninstallation of a machine from a location and installation of that machine in another location. Installing and uninstalling costs {{are considered to be}} the same. Actually, if a machine is added to a cell, only the installing cost will be imposed. In the same way, if a machine is removed from a cell, only the uninstalling cost will be incurred. Then, if a <b>machine</b> is <b>transferred</b> between two different locations in the cells, both uninstalling and installing costs will be imposed. Thus, {{it is reasonable to assume}} that the unit cost of adding or removing a machine to/from the cells is half of the <b>transferring</b> <b>machine</b> cost.|$|R
