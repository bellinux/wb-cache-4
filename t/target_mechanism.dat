Design of <b>targeting</b> <b>mechanisms</b> has been changing over time and {{it is important to understand}} implementers' experience with such <b>targeting</b> <b>mechanisms</b> since such mechanisms impact equity in access and use of maternal health care services. The case study approach was considered as appropriate method for exploring implementers' and decision-makers' experiences with the two <b>targeting</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> In-depth interviews in order to explore implementer experience with the two <b>targeting</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> A total of 10 in-depth interviews (IDI) and 4 group discussions (GDs) were conducted with implementers at national level, regional, district and health care facility level. A thematic analysis approach was adopted during data analysis. The whole process of screening and identifying poor pregnant women resulted in delay in implementation of the intervention. Individual targeting was perceived to have some form of stigmatization; hence beneficiaries did not like to be termed as poor. Geographical targeting had a few cons as health care providers experienced an increase in workload while staff remained the same and poor quality of information in the claim forms. However geographical targeting increase in the number of women going to higher level of care (district/regional referral hospital), increase in facility revenue and insurance coverage. Interventions which are using <b>targeting</b> <b>mechanisms</b> to reach poor people are useful in increasing access and use of health care services for marginalized communities so long as they are well designed and beneficiaries as well as all implementers and decision makers are involved from the very beginning. Implementation of demand side financing strategies using <b>targeting</b> <b>mechanisms</b> should go together with supply side interventions in order to achieve project objectives...|$|R

A {{new kind of}} ruler <b>target</b> <b>mechanism</b> is designed to read the cross-diameter data. The ruler <b>target</b> <b>mechanism</b> is pushed into the chamber by a driver mechanism. It moves along the axis of the chamber, and the sequence images are collected. The radial displacement of the cross-measurement claw {{can be obtained by}} processing the change of inscribed lines on the ruler target, and the current diameter, volume and conical degree of the chamber can all be acquired by referring to the demarcating annulus size. Measurement precision is analysed based on error propagation theory, with the diameter and volume parameters as examples. According to this principle, the measurement prototype is designed, and experiments are conducted on it. We show that the measurement error of the diameter is no more than 10 [*]µm, and the volume error of the artillery chamber is less than 2 ‰, which satisfies the practical engineering requirement...|$|E
40|$|SummaryWe {{define the}} <b>target,</b> <b>mechanism,</b> and {{structural}} basis of inhibition of bacterial RNA polymerase (RNAP) by the tetramic acid antibiotic streptolydigin (Stl). Stl binds {{to a site}} adjacent to but not overlapping the RNAP active center and stabilizes an RNAP-active-center conformational state with a straight-bridge helix. The results provide direct support for the proposals that alternative straight-bridge-helix and bent-bridge-helix RNAP-active-center conformations exist and that cycling between straight-bridge-helix and bent-bridge-helix RNAP-active-center conformations is required for RNAP function. The results set bounds on models for RNAP function and suggest strategies for design of novel antibacterial agents...|$|E

This paper also reviews available evidence on the various costs associated with targeting, not only administrative but also private, social, psycho-social, incentive-based and political costs. Comparisons are difficult, but all <b>mechanisms</b> generate <b>targeting</b> errors and costs. Given the inevitability of trade-offs, there is no ‘best’ <b>mechanism</b> for <b>targeting</b> social transfers.

40|$|Abstract — Cloud is {{the fastest}} growing {{computing}} platform. Researches have demonstrated that the essential issues of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack and defense is the resource competition between the attackers and defenders. A cloud usually have profound resources and has full control and dynamic allocation capabilities. Therefore, cloud offers us the potential to overcome DDoS Attack. We propose a cloud enabled defense mechanism for internet services against DDoS attacks. We propose a dynamic resource allocation strategy and a shuffling mechanism to compute the optimal reassignment strategy for clients on attacked servers, effectively separating benign clients from attacking clients. The proposed shuffling based moving <b>target</b> <b>mechanism</b> enables effective attack containment using fewer resources than attack dilution strategies using server expansion. Using Amazon EC 2 [1] instances we demonstrate that we can successfully mitigate large scale DDoS attack in {{a small number of}} shuffles...|$|E
40|$|Myocardial {{injury in}} mammals leads to heart failure through {{pathological}} cardiac remodelling that includes hypertrophy, fibrosis and ventricular dilatation. Central {{to this is}} inability of the mammalian cardiomyocyte to self-renew due to entering a quiescent state after birth. Modulation of the cardiomyocyte cell-cycle after injury is therefore a <b>target</b> <b>mechanism</b> to limit damage and potentiate repair and regeneration. Here we show that cardiomyocyte specific over-expression of the nuclear-matrix associated DNA replication protein, CIZ 1, extends their window of proliferation during cardiac development, delaying onset of terminal differentiation without compromising function. CIZ 1 expressing hearts are enlarged, but the cardiomyocytes are smaller with an overall increase in number, correlating with increased DNA replication after birth and retention of an increased proportion of mono-nucleated cardiomyocytes into adulthood. Furthermore, these CIZ 1 induced changes in the heart reduce the impact of myocardial injury, identifying CIZ 1 as a putative therapeutic target for cardiac repair...|$|E
40|$|Reductionist inquiry, which {{involves}} decomposing a mechanism into its parts and operations, {{is only one}} of the tasks of mechanistic research. A second task (which may be undertaken largely simultaneously) is recom-posing it – conceptually reassembling the parts and operations into an or-ganized arrangement that constitutes the mechanism. Other tasks include determining how multiple operations are orchestrated in real time, and in-vestigating how the mechanism interacts with the environment in which it is situated. Accordingly, explaining how a mechanism generates a phenomenon requires integrating research from at least two levels of organization – one involving the parts and their operations and another involving the mecha-nism as a whole. Sometimes additional levels are so salient that they too must be incorporated into the account. Researchers may come to recognize, for example, that the <b>target</b> <b>mechanism</b> is itself part of a larger integrated system (a higher-level mechanism) that confronts its own environment, an...|$|E

40|$|Histone {{modifications}} {{are important}} epigenetic regulators {{and play a}} critical role in develop-ment. The <b>targeting</b> <b>mechanism</b> for histone modifications is complex and still incompletely understood. Here we applied a computational approach to predict genome-scale histone modification targets in humans by the genomic DNA sequences using a set of recent ChIP-seq data. We found that a number of histone modification marks could be predicted with high accuracy. On the other hand, the impact of DNA sequences for each mark is intrinsically different dependent upon the target- and tissue-specificity. Diverse patterns are associated with different repetitive elements. Unexpectedly, we found that non-overlapping, functionally opposite histone modification marks could share similar sequence features. We propose that these marks may target a common set of loci but are mutually exclusive and that the competition may be important for developmental control. Taken together, we show that our computational approach has provided new insights into the <b>targeting</b> <b>mechanism</b> of histone modifications...|$|R

40|$|Advances in target-based drug {{discovery}} strategies have enabled {{drug discovery}} groups in academia and industry to become very effective at generating molecules that are potent and selective against single targets.

Consequently, reductionist target directed drug-discovery approaches are not appropriately tailored towards identifying and optimizing multi-targeted therapeutics or rational drug combinations for complex disease. In this article, we describe the application of emerging high-content phenotypic profiling and analysis tools to support robust evaluation of drug combination performance following dose-ratio matrix screening. We further describe how the incorporation of high-throughput reverse phase protein microarrays with phenotypic screening can provide rational drug combination hypotheses but also confirm the mechanism-of-action of novel drug combinations, to facilitate future preclinical and clinical development strategies...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—We {{introduce}} a cloud-enabled defense mecha-nism for Internet services against network and computational Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks. Our approach performs selective server replication and intelligent client re-assignment, turning victim servers into moving targets for attack isolation. We {{introduce a}} novel system architecture that leverages a “shuffling ” mechanism {{to compute the}} optimal re-assignment strategy for clients on attacked servers, effectively separating benign clients from even sophisticated adversaries that persistently follow the moving targets. We introduce a family of algorithms to optimize the runtime client-to-server re-assignment plans and minimize the number of shuffles to achieve attack mitigation. The proposed shuffling-based moving <b>target</b> <b>mechanism</b> enables effective attack con-tainment using fewer resources than attack dilution strategies using pure server expansion.

40|$|Emotionally {{relevant}} experiences form {{strong and}} long-lasting memories by critically engaging the stress hormone/neurotransmitter noradrenaline, which mediates and modulates {{the consolidation of}} these memories. Noradrenaline acts through adrenergic receptors (ARs), of which β 2 - Adrenergic receptors (βARs) are of particular importance. The differential anatomical and cellular distribution of βAR subtypes in the brain suggests that they play distinct roles in memory processing, although much about their specific contributions and mechanisms of action remains to be understood. Here we show that astrocytic rather than neuronal β 2 ARs in the hippocampus {{play a key role}} in the consolidation of a fear-based contextual memory. These hippocampal β 2 ARs, but not β 1 ARs, are coupled to the training-dependent release of lactate from astrocytes, which is necessary for long- Term memory formation and for underlying molecular changes.
