5|$|The rumored Ho-Chunk {{attack on}} Fort Crawford never came, {{and so in}} October 1826, Colonel Snelling moved the {{garrison}} to Fort Snelling, where he hoped to reduce hostilities between <b>the</b> <b>Dakotas</b> (Sioux) and the Ojibwes (Chippewas). The two Ho-Chunk prisoners were also moved to Fort Snelling. In May 1827, after Dakotas attacked an Ojibwe party near Fort Snelling, Colonel Snelling arrested four of <b>the</b> <b>Dakotas</b> and turned {{them over to the}} Ojibwes, who killed them. This angered some Dakotas, who encouraged the Ho-Chunks to help them strike at the Americans, falsely telling them that the Ho-Chunks prisoners had also been turned over to the Ojibwes for execution.|$|E

5|$|Hill faced further {{problems}} as he {{planned for the}} operation. The American pilots of the Dakota transport aircraft that would transport the battalion were inexperienced and had never conducted a parachute drop before, {{and there was no}} time for any training or exercises. There were also no photos of the airfield or the surrounding areas, and only a single, smallscale map available for navigation. To ensure that the aircraft found the dropzone and delivered the battalion accurately, Hill sat in the cockpit of the leading Dakota and assisted the pilot. <b>The</b> <b>Dakotas</b> were escorted by four American P-38 Lightning fighters, which engaged and drove off two roving German fighters, but as <b>the</b> <b>Dakotas</b> approached the Tunisian border they encountered thick clouds and were forced to turn back, landing at Maison Blanche at 11:00. It was decided that the battalion would conduct the operation the next day, which allowed the paratroopers to rest for a night. 1st Parachute Battalion took off on the morning of 16 November, and enjoyed excellent weather that allowed the transport aircraft to drop the battalion accurately around the airfield at Souk elArba. Most of the paratroopers landed successfully, but one man was killed when his rigging line twisted around his neck middrop, throttling him; one officer broke his leg on landing, and four men were wounded when a Sten gun was accidentally fired. The battalion's secondincommand, Major Alastair Pearson, remained at the airfield with a small detachment that collected the airborne equipment and supervised the burial of the casualty.|$|E
5000|$|Historically, Lower Cretaceous strata in the Rocky Mountain {{region have}} been called <b>the</b> <b>Dakota</b> Formation based on assumed {{correlation}} with the type section of <b>the</b> <b>Dakota</b> of <b>the</b> Great Plains. Witzke and Ludvigson have argued that use of the name [...] "Dakota" [...] must reflect actual, not presumed correlation based on stratigraphy and composition of the sedimentary rock. To {{the west of the}} Rocky Mountains, such as on the Colorado Plateau, this sequence of Upper Cretaceous, predominately sandstone, sedimentary rocks was recommended to be known as <b>the</b> <b>Dakota</b> Group, to dispel any suggestion of direct facies correlation. However, few authors of papers on <b>the</b> <b>Dakota</b> west of <b>the</b> Rocky Mountains, especially on the Colorado Plateau, recognize <b>the</b> <b>Dakota</b> as <b>the</b> <b>Dakota</b> Group, instead using <b>the</b> term <b>Dakota</b> Sandstone, of formation rank. Its subdivisions are recognized as members. Many authors have emphasized the fact that <b>the</b> marine <b>Dakota</b> Sandstone on <b>the</b> Colorado Plateau is intertongued with the marine lower part of the Mancos Shale, resulting in valid lithostratigraphic names such as the Whitewater Arroyo Tongue of the Mancos Shale which is directly overlain by the Twowells Sandstone Tongue of <b>the</b> <b>Dakota</b> Sandstone (references). In the western San Juan Basin, the lowermost part of <b>the</b> <b>Dakota</b> Sandstone, although of marginal marine origin in the eastern San Juan Basin, is a complex of non-marine sandstones.

25|$|Throughout {{the late}} 1850s, treaty {{violations}} by the United States and late or unfair annuity payments by Indian agents caused increasing hunger and hardship among <b>the</b> <b>Dakota.</b> Traders with <b>the</b> <b>Dakota</b> previously had {{demanded that the}} government give the annuity payments directly to them (introducing the possibility of unfair dealing between the agents and the traders {{to the exclusion of}} <b>the</b> <b>Dakota).</b> In mid-1862, <b>the</b> <b>Dakota</b> demanded <b>the</b> annuities directly from their agent, Thomas J.

5|$|In {{the first}} few decades of the 20th century, Minneapolis began to lose its {{dominant}} position in the flour milling industry, after reaching its peak in 1915–1916. The rise of steam power, and later electric power, eroded the advantage that St. Anthony Falls provided in water power. The wheat fields of <b>the</b> <b>Dakotas</b> and Minnesota's Red River Valley began suffering from soil exhaustion due to consecutive wheat crops, leading {{to an increase in}} wheat leaf rust and related crop diseases. The farmers of the southern plains developed a variety of hardy red winter wheat suitable for bread flour, and the Kansas City area gained prominence in milling. Also, due to changes in rail shipping rates, millers in Buffalo, New York were able to ship their flour more competitively.|$|E
5|$|Industrial {{development}} {{and the rise of}} manufacturing caused the population to shift gradually from rural areas to cities during the early 20th century. Nevertheless, farming remained prevalent. Minnesota's economy was hard-hit by the Great Depression, resulting in lower prices for farmers, layoffs among iron miners, and labor unrest. Compounding the adversity, western Minnesota and <b>the</b> <b>Dakotas</b> were hit by drought from 1931 to 1935. New Deal programs provided some economic turnaround. The Civilian Conservation Corps and other programs around the state established some jobs for Indians on their reservations, and the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934 provided the tribes with a mechanism of self-government. This provided natives a greater voice within the state, and promoted more respect for tribal customs because religious ceremonies and native languages were no longer suppressed.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Black Hawk {{learned that}} the Ho-Chunk and Potawatomi tribes were less {{supportive}} than anticipated. As in other tribes, different bands of these tribes often pursued different policies. The Ho-Chunks who lived along the Rock River in Illinois had family ties to the Sauks; they cautiously supported the British Band while trying not to provoke the Americans. Ho-Chunks in Wisconsin were more divided. Some bands, remembering their loss to the Americans in the 1827 Winnebago War, decided to stay clear of the conflict. Other Ho-Chunks with ties to <b>the</b> <b>Dakotas</b> and Menominees, most notably Waukon Decorah and his brothers, were eager {{to fight against the}} British Band.|$|E

Despite the battalion's parachutes only arriving at 16:30 on 14 November, and were packed twelve to a container which meant they had to be removed and individually repacked, the battalion was prepared by 15 November and took off at 07:30. <b>The</b> <b>Dakotas</b> were escorted by four American P-38 Lightning fighters, which engaged and drove off two roving German fighters, but as <b>the</b> <b>Dakotas</b> approached the Tunisian border, they encountered thick clouds and were forced to turn back, landing at Maison Blanche at 11:00. It was decided that the battalion would conduct the operation the next day, which allowed the paratroopers to rest for a night. At the same time, 2nd Battalion of the 509th PIR successfully conducted a drop at Tebessa, capturing its objectives and securing the area; it then passed from the control of 1st Parachute Brigade and remained in the area for some time. 1st Parachute Battalion took off on the morning of 16 November, and encountered excellent weather which allowed the transport aircraft to drop the battalion accurately around the airfield at Souk elArba.

No.1 (Bomber) Squadron, operating the Lincolns, would be detached from the control of No.82 Wing at RAAF Station Amberley, Queensland, and be based at Tengah airfield in the west of Singapore. No.38 (Transport) Squadron, operating Dakotas, would be detached from No.86 Wing at RAAF Station Richmond, New South Wales, and be based at Changi, in Singapore's east.

Return journeys to Japan were often used to evacuate wounded personnel from the theatre. No.30 Communications Unit was redesignated No.30 Transport Unit in November 1951, and re-formed as No.36 (Transport) Squadron in March 1953.
