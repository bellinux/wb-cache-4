5|$|Owers' Corner {{was named}} after Lieutenant Noel Owers, who was given the task of {{surveying}} a new route from Ilolo to Nauro. The project of constructing a jeep track to Nauro was pushed aggressively by the Chief Engineer at New Guinea Force, Brigadier John Main. Lieutenant Colonel Sidney Bleechmore was placed in charge, and was given the 7th and 2/14th Field Companies and {{a section of the}} 2/1st Mechanical Equipment Company. Work commenced on 19 August. Removing the trees allowed the sun <b>to</b> <b>dry</b> <b>out</b> the ground, and by adding drainage, a track was created passable by light vehicles, allowing plant and equipment to be brought up. Owers' Corner was reached in early September.|$|E
5|$|Routine care {{during the}} growing season {{involves}} keeping the rows free of competing weeds, especially when the plants are young. The plants are shallow-rooted and do not need a great deal of water when established. Bulbing usually takes place after 12 to 18 weeks. The bulbs can be gathered when needed to eat fresh, but if they will be kept in storage, they should be harvested after the leaves have died back naturally. In dry weather, they can be left {{on the surface of the}} soil for a few days <b>to</b> <b>dry</b> <b>out</b> properly, then they can be placed in nets, roped into strings, or laid in layers in shallow boxes. They should be stored in a well-ventilated, cool place such as a shed.|$|E

5|$|Camas pocket gophers cause {{significant}} economic losses, so may {{be treated as}} an agricultural pest. Crops damaged include clover, alfalfa and vetch. The gophers may eat these crops or damage the roots while burrowing. This can injure the roots and expose them to air, causing them <b>to</b> <b>dry</b> <b>out.</b> Subterranean activity can also damage the roots of fruit trees. Root crops are particularly susceptible to damage and consumption; potatoes, carrots, parsnips and other crops may be eaten on site or dragged off by the gopher for caching in the burrow. Excavated soil can cover grass and limit lifestock grazing; freshly sprouted grains may be similarly damaged. An estimate of impact from camas pocket gopher activities in the Willamette Valley in 1918 amounted to $1.5million annual losses. Gopher activities can provide a benefit of soil aeration, enhancing water retention after rain or snowmelt. Buried vegetation can also compost, enhancing organic soil content to provide additional benefits.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{the caps}} {{are covered by}} a peridium—an outer {{covering}} layer of tissue. After the fruit body matures and begins <b>to</b> <b>dry</b> <b>out,</b> {{the lower part of}} the peridium starts to rip, usually starting from small longitudinal slits near where the peridium attaches to the top of the stem. However, the pattern of tearing is variable; in some instances, the slits may appear higher up on the peridium, in others, the peridium rips more irregularly. The peridium may also rip in such a way that it appears as if there is a ring at the top of the stem. The torn peridium exposes the internal gleba. The gleba is divided into wavy plates or lamellae, some of which are fused together to form irregular chambers. The gleba is a drab brown to blackish-brown color, and it becomes tough and brittle as it dries out. The flesh is firm when young, white, and will stain light to bright yellow when it is bruised.|$|E
5|$|The puffins are {{energetic}} burrow-engineers and repairers and {{the grassy}} slopes may be undermined by {{a network of}} tunnels. This causes the turf <b>to</b> <b>dry</b> <b>out</b> in summer, vegetation to die and dry soil be whirled away by the wind. Burrows sometimes collapse, and humans may cause this to happen by walking incautiously across nesting slopes. A colony on Grassholm was lost through erosion when there was so little soil left that burrows could not be made. New colonies are very unlikely to start up spontaneously because this gregarious bird will only nest where others are already present. Nevertheless, the Audubon Society had success on Eastern Egg Rock Island in Maine, where, after a gap of ninety years, puffins were reintroduced and started breeding again. By 2011 there were over 120 pairs nesting on the small islet. On the Isle of May {{on the other side}} of the Atlantic, only five pairs of puffins were breeding in 1958 while twenty years later there were 10,000 pairs.|$|E

50|$|In the past, the Velykyi Kuyalnik was navigable and, {{together}} with the Dniester, was used to transport goods to the Black Sea, bypassing the cascades at the Dnieper River. In 2007-2008, illegal sand diggers built a damb {{in the mouth of}} the Velykyi Kuyalnik, so that the river does not empty to the sea anymore. The damb has never been demolished, leading <b>to</b> <b>drying</b> <b>out</b> of the estuary.|$|R
50|$|The {{inflorescence}} is infrafoliar {{and surrounded}} by a 90 cm long, leathery spathe, which curls up on itself after abscission (due <b>to</b> <b>drying</b> <b>out).</b> The inflorescence stalk is 8 - 13 cm long and elliptic in cross-section. The rachis is very short, 8 - 9 cm long and bearing about 30-50 crowded, spirally arranged rachillae. The fruit is oblate, 1.6 x 2.4 cm and dark purplish-black at maturity.|$|R
50|$|The fruit has an {{exceptionally}} sweet, malty flavor. The unripe fruit {{is hard to}} the touch and contains high amounts of saponin, which has astringent properties similar <b>to</b> tannin, <b>drying</b> <b>out</b> the mouth.|$|R
25|$|Climatic factors {{contribute}} to Australia's high incidence of bushfires, particularly during the summer months. Low relative humidity, wind and lack of rain can cause a small fire, either man-made or caused naturally by lightning strikes, to spread rapidly over large distances. Low humidity, {{the heat of the}} sun and lack of water cause vegetation <b>to</b> <b>dry</b> <b>out</b> becoming a perfect fuel for the fire. High winds fan the flames, increasing their intensity and the speed and distance at which they can travel.|$|E
25|$|Conditions at the Queens Sports Club, Bulawayo tend to aid batsmen, with spin {{coming into}} the game {{in a big way}} in the latter stages. The pitch has some grass, though not green enough to leave batsmen anxious. With the {{temperature}} touching 28 degrees, the strip is expected <b>to</b> <b>dry</b> <b>out</b> quickly and flatten into a batting beauty. The seamers' best chance will be with the new ball, and both teams feel keen to make first use of the pitch.|$|E
25|$|Once {{he joined}} the Lakers, Abdul-Jabbar began wearing his {{trademark}} goggles (he briefly ditched them in the 1979–80 season). Years of battling under NBA backboards, and being hit and scratched in the face in the process, had taken their toll on his eyes and he developed corneal erosion syndrome, where the eyes begin <b>to</b> <b>dry</b> <b>out</b> easily and cease to produce moisture. He missed one game in the 1986–87 season due to his eyes drying out and swelling as a result.|$|E

50|$|Diatomaceous earth, {{made from}} fossilized and {{pulverized}} silica shells, {{can be used}} in order to damage the protective cuticle layer of insects that have them, such as ants. When this layer is damaged, the insects become vulnerable <b>to</b> <b>drying</b> <b>out.</b> Unfortunately, the effectiveness of Diatomaceous earth decreases if it is wet. Therefore, it must be used often. This method was used back in the 1930s and 1940s when farmers would run dust over their fields. This would have the very same effect as diatomaceous earth.|$|R
50|$|The first {{priority}} when treating <b>dry</b> rot is <b>to</b> find {{and remove the}} dampness within the building that caused the outbreak, and <b>to</b> promote <b>drying</b> <b>out</b> by taking measures, such as increasing ventilation. Treatment approaches differ after these steps are taken.|$|R
25|$|Standard {{maintenance}} is to rinse {{inside and out}} with clean, fresh water after each day's use, and allow <b>to</b> <b>dry</b> <b>out</b> of direct sunlight before storage. Ultraviolet light degrades the synthetic materials of the skirt and frame. A well-maintained mask should last for several years. The strap is the most stressed component and is often the first part to fail, but can usually be replaced. Inspection of the strap for cracks and tears before use can {{reduce the risk of}} failure during a dive.|$|E
25|$|The leather valve {{along the}} top of the pipe tended <b>to</b> <b>dry</b> <b>out</b> and air could then leak in, but this was mitigated {{slightly}} by the passing trains spraying water on the leather. The harsh environment of the line, which runs adjacent to the sea for much of its length and is often soaked with salt spray, presented difficulties in maintaining the leather flaps provided to seal the vacuum pipes, which had to be kept supple by being greased with tallow; even so, air leaked in, reducing the pressure difference.|$|E
25|$|Macau did {{not develop}} {{as a major}} {{settlement}} until the Portuguese arrived in the 16th century. In 1513, Jorge Álvares became the first Portuguese to land in China. In 1535, Portuguese traders obtained the rights to anchor ships in Macau's harbours and to carry out trading activities, though not the right to stay onshore. Around 1552–1553, they obtained temporary permission to erect storage sheds onshore, in order <b>to</b> <b>dry</b> <b>out</b> goods drenched by sea water; they soon built rudimentary stone houses around the area now called Nam Van.|$|E

25|$|Turkeys {{are usually}} baked or roasted in an oven for several hours, often while the cook prepares the {{remainder}} of the meal. Sometimes, a turkey is brined before roasting to enhance flavor and moisture content. This is necessary because the dark meat requires a higher temperature to denature all of the myoglobin pigment than the white meat (which is very low in myoglobin), so that fully cooking the dark meat tends <b>to</b> <b>dry</b> <b>out</b> the breast. Brining makes it possible to fully cook the dark meat without drying the breast meat. Turkeys are sometimes decorated with turkey frills prior to serving.|$|E
25|$|The chief {{difficulty}} {{experienced in}} the drying of timber is the tendency of its outer layers <b>to</b> <b>dry</b> <b>out</b> more rapidly than the interior ones. If these layers are allowed to dry much below the fibre saturation point while the interior is still saturated, stresses (called drying stresses) are set up because the shrinkage of the outer layers is restricted by the wet interior (Keey et al., 2000). Rupture in the wood tissues occurs, and consequently splits and cracks occur if these stresses across the grain exceed the strength across the grain (fibre to fibre bonding).|$|E
