40|$|BACKGROUND: Reversed {{shoulder}} arthroplasty is {{an accepted}} treatment for glenohumeral arthritis associated to rotator cuff deficiency. For most reversed shoulder prostheses, the baseplate of the glenoid component is uncemented and its primary stability {{is provided by}} a central peg and peripheral screws. Because {{of the importance of}} the primary stability for a good osteo-integration of the baseplate, the optimal fixation of the screws is crucial. In particular, the amplitude of the <b>tightening</b> <b>force</b> of the nonlocking screws is clearly associated to this stability. Since this force is unknown, it is currently not accounted for in experimental or numerical analyses. Thus, the primary goal of this work is to measure this <b>tightening</b> <b>force</b> experimentally. In addition, the tightening torque was also measured, to estimate an optimal surgical value. METHODS: An experimental setup with an instrumented baseplate was developed to measure simultaneously the <b>tightening</b> <b>force,</b> tightening torque and screwing angle, of the nonlocking screws of the Aquealis reversed prosthesis. In addition, the amount of bone volume around each screw was measured with a micro-CT. Measurements were performed on 6 human cadaveric scapulae. FINDINGS: A statistically correlated relationship (p< 0. 05, R= 0. 83) was obtained between the maximal <b>tightening</b> <b>force</b> and the bone volume. The relationship between the tightening torque and the bone volume was not statistically significant. INTERPRETATION: The experimental relationship presented in this paper can be used in numerical analyses to improve the baseplate fixation in the glenoid bone...|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn {{this paper}} we propose a finite element {{approach}} which simulates the mechanical behaviour of beam assemblies that are subject to large deformations and that develop contact-friction interactions. We focus on detecting and modeling contact-friction interactions within the assembly of beams. Contact between beams [...] or between parts of the same beam in the case of self-contact, is detected from intermediate geometries defined within proximity zones associating close parts of beam axes. The discretization of contact-friction interactions is performed on these intermediate geometries by means of contact elements, constituted of pairs of material particles which are predicted to enter into contact. A 3 D finite strain beam model is used to represent the behaviour of each beam. This model describes the kinematics of each beam cross-section using nine degrees of freedom, and is therefore able to represent plane deformations of these cross-sections. Algorithms are proposed to solve the global nonlinear problem using an implicit scheme, under quasi-static assumptions.

The high static friction coefficients, obtained at 100 MPa normal pressure with textures with up to 62. 5 μm pulse separation (processing speed ∼ 0. 67 cm 2 /s), were found to be associated with a significant amount of plastic deformation caused by the high normal pressures.

40|$|In this research, we {{developed}} passive power assistive device Smart Suit Lite (SSL) thatdecreases muscle load and lumbar load of wearers, and constructed its design method. SSL is developed under concepts of KEIROKA technology that decreases physical burden and fatigue. The device is {{compact and lightweight}} because it utilizes only the elastic materials without power-sources or sensors. On the other hand, {{there is a problem}} that it is not able to control the assist force corresponding to the load changes. Therefore, this paper proposes the design method of the device which supplies the optimal assistive force to target motions and desired assist ratio. The effects of SSL are divided into trunk stabilizing effect and muscle assisting effect. For the design of SSL, modeling and analysis of each effects are required. The muscle assisting effect reduces the muscle load by the component of assistive force {{in the same direction as}} the muscle. For the analysis of this effect, the surface shape of the wearer were modeled. A skin segment model was added on the musculoskeletal model, and it is able to simulate the change in length of the skin by moving and rotating the segments in accordance with the motion. By placing the model of elastic material on the segments, itbecomes possible to simulate the assist effect of arbitrary arrangement and properties of the elastic materials. The trunk stabilizing effect reduces the burden of the lumbar spine and increases the support in the lumbar region by tightening around the pelvic. The <b>tightening</b> <b>force</b> of SSL increases according to the posture. The quantitative evaluations of the trunk stabilizing effect were performed by estimating lumbar joint stiffness. It becomes possible to simulate the trunk stabilizing effect when changing the assist force by constructing the model of the relation between <b>tightening</b> <b>force</b> and joint stiffness.
