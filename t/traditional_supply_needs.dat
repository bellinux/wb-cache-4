Our research investigates whether consumers are realising improvements at the retailer level when electronic supply chain management is employed as compared to <b>traditional,</b> manual <b>supply</b> chain management by examining a large retailer. The sample provides data for products replenished using electronic supply chain management and products using <b>traditional</b> <b>supply</b> chain management within the same retailer. Analysis investigates the differences with respect to price and availability to determine if consumer needs have been met. The findings show that electronic supply chain management results in a higher price as compared to <b>traditional</b> <b>supply</b> chain management. consumer needs; electronic commerce; electronic supply chain management; e-SCM; e-commerce; retailing; retail companies; retail prices...|$|R

3000|$|In recent years, {{the design}} and {{implementation}} of agile supply chain strategies have increasingly attracted interest and some companies such as Zara and Gina Tricot have achieved many advantages by employing agile strategy. Agile supply chain includes companies such as suppliers, production centers, and distribution centers, which are legally separate but, in terms of operations, are linked together by forward-flow materials and feedback information. Agile supply chain is focused on improving responsiveness, speed, and flexibility that is able to respond and react quickly and effectively to changing markets ([Lin et al. 2006]). In other words, agility is a term applied to an organization that has created the processes, tools, and training to enable it to respond quickly to customer needs and unforeseen market changes while still controlling costs and quality ([Christopher et al. 2004]). <b>Traditional</b> <b>supply</b> chains have long lead times and are forecast-driven, which makes these supply chains inventory-based, while the agile supply chain with quick response has shorter lead time and is demand-driven and information-based, in contrast with <b>traditional</b> <b>supply</b> chains. Additionally, while the market winning factor in agile supply chain is responsiveness and improved service level, in <b>traditional</b> <b>supply</b> chain, cost has been the market winning factor ([Mason-Jones et al. 2000]). Agile supply chain practices can be identified by four factors ([Harrison et al. 1999]): [...]...|$|R

40|$|Most public {{transport}} subsidies {{in developing countries}} are justified on equity or social grounds. However, {{it is not clear}} how well current subsidies meet these objectives. In this paper we evaluate several {{public transport}} subsidies in the case of Santiago, Chile. This is an interesting case study because direct mean tested monetary transfers have been used in recent years to distribute public transport subsidies rather than use more <b>traditional</b> <b>supply</b> side sectoral subsidies. The results show that using the general welfare system to distribute transport subsidies performs much better than <b>traditional</b> <b>supply</b> side subsidies. The latter are very badly targeted and in some cases quite regressive. Together with some recent evidence from other developing country cities, the results of this paper imply that more effort needs to be placed on the analysis, design and implementation of social subsidies in the transport sector. ...|$|R

40|$|To ensure {{quality of}} {{pharmaceutical}} {{raw materials and}} products {{it is very important}} to monitor specific factors throughout supply chain. In cold chains, temperature is closely controlled and monitored. Fur-thermore, it is critical to retain all associated information artifacts from a reporting, inspection and audit-ing standpoint. Loss in information can translate to significant monitory losses to parties involved. Con-sequently, cost not only includes all <b>traditional</b> <b>supply</b> chain costs, but also contains costs associated with penalties due to information loss/inaccuracy. Therefore, managing pharmaceutical cold chain costs is more challenging than managing <b>traditional</b> <b>supply</b> chain costs. This paper studies a typical cold chain and costs associated with a typical multi-echelon network under stochastic demand and probabilistic in-formation handoff conditions. Dynamic equations are developed for individual nodes. A DOE is also pro-posed to understand sensitivity of key factors on costs. A simulation based optimization approach is adopted for the study. ...|$|R

40|$|Motivated by the {{importance}} of energy storage networks in smart grids, we provide an algorithmic study of the online energy storage management problem in a network setting, the first {{to the best of}} our knowledge. Given online power supplies, either entirely renewable supplies or those in combination with <b>traditional</b> <b>supplies,</b> we want to route power from the supplies to demands using storage units subject to a decay factor. Our goal is to maximize the total utility of satisfied demands less the total production cost of routed power. We model renewable supplies with the zero production cost function and <b>traditional</b> <b>supplies</b> with convex production cost functions. For two natural storage unit settings, private and public, we design poly-logarithmic competitive algorithms in the network flow model using the dual fitting and online primal dual methods for convex problems. Furthermore, we show strong hardness results for more general settings of the problem. Our techniques may be of independent interest in other routing and storage management problems...|$|R
