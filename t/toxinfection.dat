The present study analyzed the frequency of both agents in Psittaciformes in rehabilitation process for wildlife reintroduction. In 89 birds analyzed, 19 % were infected with E. coli and 1, 12 % with Salmonella spp. It was carried out an analysis of the profile of antibiotic resistance in which was observed the efficiency of estreptomicin, tetraciclin, trimetoprim and gentamicin over the samples. The samples of E. coli were submitted to the Congo Red Binding test and to the Hemolisis test and 70, 6 % of positive samples for the first test and 53 % for the second one were observed...|$|E
40|$|A coleta da alface (Lactuca sativa) e da água de manejo foi realizada {{no local}} de cultivo, tanto pelo método de hidroponia (CH) como pelo tradicional no solo (CT) em estabelecimentos hortifrutigranjeiros e restaurante (R) localizados em cidades da região noroeste paulista. As vinte e cinco amostras analisadas foram coletadas em dias alternados, sendo cinco amostras de cada local. As análises foram {{realizadas}} com objetivo de verificar se a origem das toxinfecções alimentares envolvendo pratos que contenham alface é proveniente de microrganismos do local de produção das hortaliças. Os resultados obtidos possibilitaram analisar a ocorrência de contaminação cruzada com outras hortaliças enxaguadas no mesmo tonel e comparar o índice de contaminação dos dois tipos de sistema de cultivo. As análises microbiológicas seguiram as metodologias tradicionais descritas por Silva; Junqueira e Silveira (2001), de acordo com a American Public Health Association. Os resultados das análises mostraram grande variação na contagem dos microrganismos. Nas amostras de alface 92 % (23) apresentaram crescimento de coliformes totais variando entre 0, 4 a ≥ 240 NMP/g dos quais 40 % (10) CT, 32 % (8) CH, 20 % (5) R; 32 % (8) apresentaram coliformes termotolerantes variando entre 0, 9 a 46 NMP/g, sendo 24 % (6) CT e 8 % (2) R; 36 % (9) apresentaram Staphylococcus coagulase positiva, onde 12 % (3) apresentaram crescimento acima dos parâmetros estabelecidos 5 x 103 UFC/g, sendo 4 % (1) CT e 8 % (2) CH. Todas as amostras positivas para coliformes termotolerantes estão dentro dos limites estabelecidos pela ANVISA (BRASL, 2001) de 102 UFC/g. Nenhuma amostra foi positiva para Salmonella spp, atendendo os parâmetros estabelecidos pela ANVISA (BRASIL, 2001) de ausência em 25 g do produto. Os resultados obtidos nas análises da água foram de 95 % (19) apresentando coliformes totais variando [...] . The collect of lettuce (Lactuca sativa) {{and the water}} used to grow it {{was made in the}} local of its cultivation through both hydroponics (CH) and the traditional in the soil (CT) methods in fruit/vegetable/poultry stores and restaurants (R) localized in the cities of the Paulista northwest region. The twenty-five samples analyzed were collected in alternate days, being five samples from each place. The analyses were carried out with the target to check if the origin of food <b>toxinfection</b> involving dishes that have lettuce is from microorganisms of the local where the vegetables are cultivated. The results obtained enabled to analyze the occurrence of contamination crossed with other vegetables rinsed in the same cask. Besides, to compare the rate of contamination of the two kinds of cultivation. The microbiological analyses followed the traditional methodologies written by Silva; Junqueira e Silveira, (2001), according to the American Public Health Association. The results of the analyses showed a great variation on the count of the microorganisms. In the lettuce samples 92 % (23) presented growing of total coliforms varying between 0, 4 to ≥ 240 NMP/g from which 40 % (10) CT, 32 % (8) CH, 20 % (5) R; 32 % (8) presented thermotolerant coliforms varying between 0, 9 to 46 NMPg, being 24 % (6) CT and 8 % (2) R. 36 % (9) presented coagulase-positive Staphylococcus, where 12 % (3) presented growing over the parameters established 5 x 103 UFC/g, being 4 % (1) CT and 8 % (2) CH. All the positive samples for thermotolerant coliforms are inside the limits established by ANVISA (BRASIL, 2001) of 102 UFC/g. No sample was positive for Salmonella spp, attending the parameters established by ANVISA (BRASIL, 2001) of absence in 15 g of the product.

40|$|Seafood {{represents}} {{a very broad}} category of food and is {{a major source of}} protein in the human diet. The increase of its consumption and the epidemiological data confirm the role of seafood (especially shellfish) as a carrier of foodborne <b>toxinfections</b> and has brought the need for a higher monitoring level and an increase of the studies of their microbiological characteristics. Edible Lamellibranch Molluscs (M. E. L) are frequently involved in food poisoning outbreaks of outstanding severity, {{due to the fact that}} they are filter-feeding animals which tend to accumulate any toxic substances or microorganisms already present in their environment. In the context of food security, the main target is to ensure food health by fulfilling specific hygiene requirements and by means of monitoring activities on shellfish conducted on the production chain of mussels and within their own environment. Microbiological eligibility for human consumption (Reg CE 1441 / 2007) is based on only two fecal contamination bacteriological parameters (Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp) and does not provide the identification of other microorganisms which are naturally present within the marine environment and potentially pathogenic such as those belonging to the genus Vibrio. In accordance with the data provided by the Centre of Disease Control (USA), food poisoning linked to the consumption of shellfish is mainly related to (20...|$|R

Methods: We inspected 34 businesses to assess the following aspects: hygiene/sanitation conditions of the work area and equipment, implementation of good food hygiene principles, evaluation of HACCP plans, licensing/authorization, quality control and sampling protocols, as well as systems for ensuring food traceability. In 28 of the businesses, samples (environment, foods, workers) were collected for microbiological analysis. Results: Sanctions were issued for nonconformities in 8 businesses (23. 5 %), and 25 businesses (73. 5 %) received warnings with orders to correct minor nonconformities (inadequate documentation of compliance with current regulations, incorrect implementation of the quality-control protocol) within specified time periods. Microbiological analyses revealed irregularities in 24 / 28 businesses (85. 7 %), and 138 of the 280 samples collected displayed contamination levels exceeding the limits adopted for this study (49. 3 %). In particular, 80 % of the surfaces sampled and 23. 8 % of the hand swabs collected were shown to be contaminated. All food samples collected met the process-hygiene and food-safety standards prescribed by the European Community. Results obtained were statistically significant (p < 0. 05). Conclusions: Our experience of food safety surveillance system indicates that Neapolitan food business operators involved in the production of hand-made ice cream or pastries do not fully understand the importance of the general preventive measures such as Good Hygienic Practices, Good Manufacturing Practice and Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point Codex requirements for providing consumers with safe, high-quality food products...|$|R

It is usually pasteurized and often smoked and dried {{for a short period}} of time. It has high gastronomic and economic value in Portuguese rural regions Nowadays it’s important to deliver safe products due to legal aspects, without losing its quality. It’s then necessary to identify the factors that contribute to that aspect. Scientific knowledge gathered throughout the years has led to the worrying of foodborne diseases caused by specific bacteria leading scientific investigation to understand the behavior of foodborne pathogenic bacteria responsible for food <b>toxinfections,</b> especially in ready-to-eat type foods. The aim of this work was to evaluate the behavior of relevant foodborne and spoilage microbiota in Beira rice morcela (MB) and Monchique rice morcela (MM) in relation to the industrial processing and storage. In order to understand the behavior of foodborne pathogens (Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella spp., Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7, Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens and Clostridium sporogenes) in Beira rice morcela paste, two trials were designed. In the first it was studied the effect of thermal process (72 °C in the thermal center), cooling rate (quick and slow) and storage temperature (4 and 15 °C) in the behavior Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella spp., E. coli O 157 :H 7 and Bacillus cereus, previously grown in normal media and under designated stress conditions (modified media supplemented with 1 % NaCl, 0, 75 mg/L NaNO 2 and 5 % of glycerol). With Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens and Clostridium sporogenes it was also studied the effect of high and low inoculum level. Enterococcus faecium was used in the same conditions to validate the thermal processing efficiency. The second trial, design as complementary to the first, it was evaluated the industrial process and recovery ability of Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella spp. and E. coli O 157 :H 7 survive and outgrown in MM produced under the same conditions as it is in a local industry. Generally, it was observed that the heat treatment used in the industry is enough to ensure a reduction of 5 D in the population of non sporulated pathogens. The designated slow cooling rate (the more similar to that achieved in the industry) revealed to be more effective in the reduction of these pathogens. The sporulated pathogens tested revealed to have a poor ability to outgrowth in the morcela, probably due to the biological state of the spores when the heat treatment was applied. The spoilage microbiota of MM packaged in MAP 60 : 40 was monitored during 49 days of storage in refrigeration temperature and under temperature abuse (15 °C). LAB was the main v specific spoilage microorganism enumerated. Enterococcus spp. and coagulase negative Staphylococcus was also involved. Gram negative bacteria (Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas spp.) associated to spoilage due to its catabolic activities and sensory negative impact decrease during the storage. Aiming to establishment the risk of growth of relevant foodborne pathogens in MB – a ready-to-eat product – a microbial challenge test was designed challenging of Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella spp., E. coli O 157 :H 7, Bacillus cereus and Clostridium perfringens. The challenge test was performed in morcela slices packaged (MAP 60 : 40, vacuum and aerobic) and stored at refrigeration temperature (4 °C) and under conditions of temperature abuse (15 °C) during 35 days. Independently of the storage conditions the outgrowth of Listeria monocytogenes occurred in the early period of storage, resulting in a hazardous product. The hazard associated to the other pathogens challenged was generally only significative if the samples were stored under temperature abuse. The spoilage microbiota of slices of Monchique morcela was very abundant and composed mainly by LAB, but also by Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas spp., that have important negative impact in the sensory characteristics of the product. The aerobic package was always the worst solution. Between vacuum and MAP, only slightly differences were observed Briefly, heat treated blood sausages are products potentially hazardous if highly accurate criteria are not applied to the control of processing and storage. The results of the present work demonstrate that the operations used by the industry, associated to a correct storage results in safe products for the consumer...|$|R
