5|$|Kirchner quickly {{expanded}} <b>the</b> <b>activities</b> <b>and</b> {{scope of}} his office, building a parallel state. This soon started {{a conflict with}} Puricelli. Instead of being fired, Kirchner resigned and accused the governor of reducing the funds for social-welfare. He ran for mayor of Río Gallegos in 1987, and won by the slim margin of 110 votes. Kirchner's friend, Rudy Ulloa Igor, helped him to victory by registering some groups of Chilean immigrants to vote (immigrants were allowed to vote in mayoral elections), and persuading them to vote for Kirchner. Julio de Vido and Carlos Zannini began working with Kirchner at this time. Kirchner used the state-owned media to promote his activities. The Peronist Ricardo del Val was elected governor that year, and the province was impacted by inflation in 1989. Kirchner became the main opponent of del Val, who was impeached and removed from office in 1990 due to the inflation crisis.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Pyrazinamidase is a {{metalloenzyme}} with hydrolyzing activity {{which is}} responsible for conversion of pyrazinamide (anti tuberculosis drug) to active molecule, pyrazinoic acid. The metal-binding site in the enzyme is composed of Asp 49, His 51, His 56 and His 71. Mutations in the pyrazinamidase gene are responsible for resistance to pyrazinamide in Mycobacterium tuberculosis and can alter the binding of metal ions to the metal binding site in the enzyme. Therefore, it is important to study the effect of metal ions on <b>the</b> enzymatic <b>activity</b> <b>and</b> stability of <b>the</b> wild type and mutant pyrazinamidases. Materials and methods: In this study, E. coli BL 21 was transformed by expression vectors carrying wild type and mutant pyrazinamidase genes. The recombinant proteins were expressed and then purified by Ni- agarose column. The purity of the purified proteins was analyzed by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis. Finally, <b>the</b> <b>activity</b> <b>and</b> stability of <b>the</b> purified enzymes were studied in the presence of 1 mM of Ni 2 +, Fe 2 + and Mn 2 +. Results: SDS-PAGE analysis showed that the expressed enzymes were purified. <b>The</b> <b>activity</b> <b>and</b> stability results depicted that Ni 2 + increases <b>the</b> <b>activity</b> <b>and</b> stability of <b>the</b> wild type and mutant (mutant 1 : L 151 S, and mutant 2 (triple) : A 143 T/T 168 A/E 173 K) enzymes. Fe 2 + decreased <b>the</b> <b>activity</b> <b>and</b> stability of mutant 1, but has no significant effect on other enzymes. <b>The</b> <b>activity</b> <b>and</b> stability of <b>the</b> enzymes decreased in the presence of Mn 2 +. Discussion and conclusion: Ni 2 + interact favorably with metal binding site of the wild type enzyme and mutants compared with Fe 2 + and Mn 2 + <b>and</b> then increases <b>the</b> <b>activity</b> <b>and</b> stability of <b>the</b> enzymes...|$|R
