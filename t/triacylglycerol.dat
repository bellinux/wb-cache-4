5|$|MFGM {{may also}} play a role in {{supporting}} cardiovascular health by modulating cholesterol and fat uptake. Clinical trials in adult populations have shown that MFGM could positively affect markers associated with cardiovascular disease including lowering serum cholesterol and <b>triacylglycerol</b> levels as well as blood pressure.|$|E
5|$|MFGM lipid {{components}} such as sphingolipids {{are involved}} in the intestinal uptake of cholesterol. Studies in adult rodents have shown that milk sphingomyelin could lower the intestinal absorption of cholesterol in a dose-dependent manner. Intestinal cholesterol absorption in adult rodents consuming a high fat diet was limited by sphingomyelin supplementation. Milk sphingomyelin and other phospholipids with high affinity for cholesterol could limit the micellar solubility of intestinal cholesterol, thereby limiting the cholesterol uptake by the enterocyte. Dietary sphingolipids have been shown to dose-dependently lower plasma cholesterol and <b>triacylglycerol</b> in adult rodents fed with Western-type diet and protect the liver from fat- and cholesterol-induced steatosis. Dietary sphingolipids also lowers hepatic cholesterol and triglyceride levels in adult rodents partly by modulating hepatic gene expression.|$|E
5|$|Several {{clinical}} {{studies have shown}} that MFGM could positively affect circulating lipids. A single-blind RCT in overweight adults has shown that the effects of milk fat on plasma lipids were modulated by the MFGM content; compared to butter oil (control diet), consumption of whipping cream (MFGM diet) for 8 weeks did not impair the lipoprotein profile. Another double-blind RCT in overweight and obese adults has also shown that MFGM attenuated the negative effects of a high-saturated fats meal by reducing postprandial cholesterol, inflammatory markers and insulin response. A double-blind RCT in normal healthy adults has indicated that one month consumption of buttermilk rich in MFGM led to reduction in serum cholesterol and <b>triacylglycerol</b> levels as well as blood pressure.|$|E

In this condition not only the amount of lipids changes, but also the composition. It was observed that <b>triacylglycerols</b> largely increase in nitrogen depletion while other lipids, mainly polar glycerolipids, free fatty acids and diacylglycerols, slightly decrease. The increase in <b>triacylglycerols</b> in nitrogen depletion is {{much larger than the}} decrease in the other glycerolipids, supporting the hypothesis that the cells actively synthesise new <b>triacylglycerols</b> rather than just transforming the existing lipids into <b>triacylglycerols.</b>|$|R
25|$|VLDL {{molecules}} {{are produced}} by the liver from <b>triacylglycerol</b> and cholesterol which was not used in the synthesis of bile acids. These molecules contain apolipoprotein B100 and apolipoprotein E in their shells, and are degraded by lipoprotein lipase on the blood vessel wall to IDL.|$|E
25|$|Blood vessels cleave {{and absorb}} <b>triacylglycerol</b> from IDL molecules, {{increasing}} {{the concentration of}} cholesterol.

25|$|In {{the blood}} stream, nascent {{chylomicron}} particles interact with HDL particles resulting in HDL donation of apolipoprotein C-II and apolipoprotein E to the nascent chylomicron. The chylomicron {{at this stage}} is then considered mature. Via apolipoprotein C-II, mature chylomicrons activate lipoprotein lipase (LPL), an enzyme on endothelial cells lining the blood vessels. LPL catalyzes the hydrolysis of <b>triacylglycerol</b> (glycerol covalently joined to three fatty acids) that ultimately releases glycerol and fatty acids from the chylomicrons. Glycerol and fatty acids can then be absorbed in peripheral tissues, especially adipose and muscle, for energy and storage.|$|E
40|$|The {{individual}} and combined effects of aflatoxin B 1 (AFB 1) and oxytetracycline (OXT) on the synthesis and secretion of <b>triacylglycerols</b> in isolated rat hepatocytes maintained in suspension during 2. 5 h were studied. Secretion of <b>triacylglycerols</b> was inhibited by both drugs when administered separately. This inhibition {{was accompanied by}} a concomitant elevation of intracellular <b>triacylglycerols</b> only at the highest AFB 1 dose tested. Total synthesis of <b>triacylglycerols</b> was not inhibited by AFB 1 or by OXT. When the two drugs were simultaneously added to the incubation medium, the AFB 1 -induced accumulation of intracellular <b>triacylglycerols</b> was no longer observed; the inhibition of secretion was nevertheless identical to that observed with AFB 1 alone. Finally, total esterification of palmitate was inhibited by 20 % compared to the AFB 1 -treated cells. These data suggest that OXT inhibits lipid accumulation induced by AFB 1 but that this effect is due to an inhibition of total synthesis of <b>triacylglycerols.</b> The mechanism of AFB 1 's effect and of the interaction between both molecules is discussed...|$|R

Enterocytes readily absorb these small molecules from the chymus. Inside of the enterocytes, fatty acids and monoacylglycerides are transformed again into triacylglycerides. Then these lipids (i.e. triacylglycerols, phospholipids, cholesterol, and cholesteryl esters) are assembled with apolipoprotein B-48 into nascent chylomicrons.

40|$|AbstractThe {{sources and}} the catabolic {{pathways}} of cytoplasmic pools of <b>triacylglycerols</b> and cholesteryl esters have been comparatively investigated in cultured fibroblasts from normal subjects and from patients affected with neutral lipid storage disease (NLSD) and Wolman disease (WD). (i) Endogenously biosynthesized <b>triacylglycerols</b> and cholesteryl esters were degraded extra-lysosomaily {{since they were}} catabolized at similar rates in normal and in WD fibroblasts. In NLSD fibroblasts, the degradation of endogenous <b>triacylglycerols</b> was severely deficient, whereas that of endogenous cholesteryl esters was in the normal range, (ii) Reconstituted high density lipoproteins (HDL) containing radiolabelled [3 H]triolein and cholesteryl [14 C]oleate were taken up by cultured fibroblasts and rapidly degraded in a non-lysosomal compartment. In NLSD fibroblasts the degradation of HDL-[3 H]triolein was blocked whereas that of HDL-[14 C]cholesteryl oleate was in the normal range. These data suggest that: (i) the cytoplasmic pools of <b>triacylglycerols</b> and cholesteryl esters originate from HDL uptake and from endogenous biosynthesis as well; (ii) cytoplasmic (non-lysosomal) <b>triacylglycerols</b> and cholesteryl esters are degraded by two separate catabolic pathways...|$|R

40|$|The liver plays a {{key role}} in the {{regulation}} of circulating levels of low density lipoproteins (LDL) because it is both the site for the production of and the major organ for the degradation of this class of lipoproteins. In this study, the effects of feeding polyunsaturated or saturated <b>triacylglycerols</b> on receptor-dependent and receptor-independent hepatic LDL uptake were measured in vivo in the hamster. In control animals, receptor-dependent LDL transport manifested an apparent Km value of 85 mg/dl (plasma LDL-cholesterol concentration) and reached a maximum transport velocity of 131 micrograms of LDL-cholesterol/hr per g, whereas receptor-independent uptake increased as a linear function of plasma LDL levels. Thus, at normal plasma LDL-cholesterol concentrations, the hepatic clearance rate of LDL equaled 120 and 9 microliter/hr per g by receptor-dependent and receptor-independent mechanisms, respectively. As the plasma LDL-cholesterol was increased, the receptor-dependent (but not the receptor-independent) component declined. When cholesterol (0. 12 %) alone or in combination with polyunsaturated <b>triacylglycerols</b> was fed for 30 days, receptor-dependent clearance was reduced to 36 - 42 microliter/hr per g, whereas feeding of cholesterol plus saturated <b>triacylglycerols</b> essentially abolished receptor-dependent LDL uptake (5 microliter/hr per g). When compared to the appropriate kinetic curves, these findings indicated that receptor-mediated LDL transport was suppressed approximately equal to 30 % by cholesterol feeding alone and this was unaffected by the addition of polyunsaturated <b>triacylglycerols</b> to the diet. In contrast, receptor-dependent uptake was suppressed approximately equal to 90 % by the intake of saturated <b>triacylglycerols.</b> As compared to polyunsaturated <b>triacylglycerols,</b> the intake of saturated lipids was also associated with significantly higher plasma LDL-cholesterol concentrations and lower levels of cholesteryl esters in the liver...|$|R
