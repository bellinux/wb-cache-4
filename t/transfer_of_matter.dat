He also produced deliberate hybrids, observed the microscopic structure of pollen grains and how the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>matter</b> from the pollen to the ovary inducing the formation of the embryo. One hundred years after Camerarius, in 1793, Christian Sprengel (1750–1816) broadened the understanding of flowers by describing the role of nectar guides in pollination, the adaptive floral mechanisms used for pollination, and the prevalence of cross-pollination, even though male and female parts are usually together on the same flower.|$|E
25|$|This {{includes}} {{cases in}} which there is contact equilibrium between the system, and several subsystems in its surroundings, including separate connections with subsystems through walls that are permeable to the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>matter</b> and internal energy as heat and allowing friction of passage of the transferred matter, but immovable, and separate connections through adiabatic walls with others, and separate connections through diathermic walls impermeable to matter with yet others. Because there are physically separate connections that are permeable to energy but impermeable to matter, between the system and its surroundings, energy transfers between them can occur with definite heat and work characters. Conceptually essential here is that the internal energy transferred with the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>matter</b> is measured by a variable that is mathematically independent of the variables that measure heat and work.|$|E
25|$|If cross-effects {{that result}} in {{diffusive}} transfer of internal energy were also labeled as heat transfers, they would sometimes violate the rule that pure heat transfer occurs only down a temperature gradient, never up one. They would also contradict the principle that all heat transfer is of {{one and the same}} kind, a principle founded on the idea of heat conduction between closed systems. One might to try to think narrowly of heat flux driven purely by temperature gradient as a conceptual component of diffusive internal energy flux, in the thermodynamic view, the concept resting specifically on careful calculations based on detailed knowledge of the processes and being indirectly assessed. In these circumstances, if perchance it happens that no <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>matter</b> is actualized, and there are no cross-effects, then the thermodynamic concept and the mechanical concept coincide, as if one were dealing with closed systems. But when there is <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>matter,</b> the exact laws by which temperature gradient drives diffusive flux of internal energy, rather than being exactly knowable, mostly need to be assumed, and in many cases are practically unverifiable. Consequently, when there is <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>matter,</b> the calculation of the pure 'heat flux' component of the diffusive flux of internal energy rests on practically unverifiable assumptions. This is a reason to think of heat as a specialized concept that relates primarily and precisely to closed systems, and applicable only in a very restricted way to open systems.|$|E
2500|$|In 1856, German {{physicist}} Rudolf Clausius, {{referring to}} closed systems, in which <b>transfers</b> <b>of</b> <b>matter</b> do not occur, defined the second fundamental theorem (the second law of thermodynamics) in the mechanical theory of heat (thermodynamics): [...] "if two transformations which, without necessitating any other permanent change, can mutually replace one another, be called equivalent, then the {{generations of the}} quantity of heat Q from work at the temperature T, has the equivalence-value:" ...|$|R
50|$|Energy {{transfer}} can {{be considered}} for the special case of systems which are closed to <b>transfers</b> <b>of</b> <b>matter.</b> The portion <b>of</b> the energy which is transferred by conservative forces over a distance is measured as the work the source system does on the receiving system. The portion of the energy which does not do work during the transfer is called heat. Energy can be transferred between systems in a variety of ways. Examples include the transmission of electromagnetic energy via photons, physical collisions which transfer kinetic energy, and the conductive <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> thermal energy.|$|R
50|$|In {{equilibrium}} thermodynamics {{the state}} variables {{do not include}} fluxes because {{in a state of}} thermodynamic equilibrium all fluxes have zero values by postulation. Equilibrium thermodynamic processes may of course involve fluxes but these must have ceased by the time a thermodynamic process or operation is complete bringing a system to its eventual thermodynamic state. Non-equilibrium thermodynamics allows its state variables to include non-zero fluxes, that describe <b>transfers</b> <b>of</b> <b>matter</b> or energy or entropy between a system and its surroundings.|$|R
25|$|In this circumstance, {{it may be}} {{expected}} that {{there may also be}} active other drivers of diffusive flux of internal energy, such as gradient of chemical potential which drives <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>matter,</b> and gradient of electric potential which drives electric current and iontophoresis; such effects usually interact with diffusive flux of internal energy driven by temperature gradient, and such interactions are known as cross-effects.|$|E
25|$|Energy {{can also}} be {{transferred}} from one thermodynamic system to another in association with <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>matter.</b> Born {{points out that in}} general such energy transfer is not resolvable uniquely into work and heat moieties. In general, when there is transfer of energy associated with matter transfer, work and heat transfers can be distinguished only when they pass through walls physically separate from those for matter transfer.|$|E
25|$|The above definition, {{equation}} (1), of {{the absolute}} temperature is due to Kelvin. It refers to systems closed to <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>matter,</b> and has special emphasis on directly experimental procedures. A presentation of thermodynamics by Gibbs starts at a more abstract level and deals with systems open to the transfer of matter; in this development of thermodynamics, the equations (2) and (3) above are actually alternative definitions of temperature.|$|E
50|$|If an {{initially}} isolated physical system, without {{internal walls}} that establish adiabatically isolated subsystems, is left long enough, it will usually reach {{a state of}} thermal equilibrium in itself, in which its temperature will be uniform throughout, but not necessarily a state of thermodynamic equilibrium, {{if there is some}} structural barrier that can prevent some possible processes in the system from reaching equilibrium; glass is an example. Classical thermodynamics in general considers idealized systems that have reached internal equilibrium, and idealized <b>transfers</b> <b>of</b> <b>matter</b> and energy between them.|$|R
25|$|The {{internal}} {{energy of a}} system can be changed by <b>transfers</b> <b>of</b> <b>matter</b> or heat or by doing work. When matter transfer is prevented by impermeable containing walls, the system {{is said to be}} closed. Then the first law of thermodynamics states that the increase in {{internal energy}} is equal to the total heat added plus the work done on the system by its surroundings. If the containing walls pass neither matter nor energy, the system is said to be isolated and its internal energy cannot change. The first law of thermodynamics may be regarded as establishing the existence of the internal energy.|$|R
50|$|The {{walls of}} a closed system allow <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> energy as heat and as work, but not <b>of</b> <b>matter,</b> between it and its surroundings. The {{walls of a}}n open system allow <b>transfer</b> both <b>of</b> <b>matter</b> and <b>of</b> energy. This scheme of {{definition}} of terms is not uniformly used, though it is convenient for some purposes. In particular, some writers use 'closed system' where 'isolated system' is here used.|$|R
25|$|A system {{connected}} to its surroundings only through contact {{by a single}} permeable wall, but otherwise isolated, is an open system. If it is initially {{in a state of}} contact equilibrium with a surrounding subsystem, a thermodynamic process of <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>matter</b> can be made to occur between them if the surrounding subsystem is subjected to some thermodynamic operation, for example, removal of a partition between it and some further surrounding subsystem. The removal of the partition in the surroundings initiates a process of exchange between the system and its contiguous surrounding subsystem.|$|E
25|$|In {{statistical}} mechanics, for {{a closed}} system (no <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>matter),</b> heat is the energy transfer {{associated with a}} disordered, microscopic action on the system, associated with jumps in occupation numbers of the energy levels of the system, without change in {{the values of the}} energy levels themselves. It is possible for macroscopic thermodynamic work to alter the occupation numbers without change in the values of the system energy levels themselves, but what distinguishes transfer as heat is that the transfer is entirely due to disordered, microscopic action, including radiative transfer. A mathematical definition can be formulated for small increments of quasi-static adiabatic work in terms of the statistical distribution of an ensemble of microstates.|$|E
25|$|In {{the case}} of a flowing system of only one {{chemical}} constituent, in the Lagrangian representation, there is no distinction between bulk flow and diffusion of matter. Moreover, the flow of matter is zero into or out of the cell that moves with the local center of mass. In effect, in this description, one is dealing with a system effectively closed to the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>matter.</b> But still one can validly talk of a distinction between bulk flow and diffusive flow of internal energy, the latter driven by a temperature gradient within the flowing material, and being defined with respect to the local center of mass of the bulk flow. In this case of a virtually closed system, because of the zero matter transfer, as noted above, one can safely distinguish between transfer of energy as work, and transfer of internal energy as heat.|$|E
5000|$|The law of {{conservation}} of mass or principle of mass conservation states that for any system closed to all <b>transfers</b> <b>of</b> <b>matter</b> and energy, {{the mass of}} the system must remain constant over time, as system mass cannot change quantity if it is not added or removed. Hence, the quantity of mass is [...] "conserved" [...] over time. The law implies that mass can neither be created nor destroyed, although it may be rearranged in space, or the entities associated with it may be changed in form, as for example when light or physical work is transformed into particles that contribute the same mass to the system as the light or work had contributed. Thus, during any chemical reaction, nuclear reaction, or radioactive decay in an isolated system, the total mass of the reactants or starting materials must be equal to {{the mass of the}} products.|$|R

50|$|In thermodynamics, an {{isentropic}} process is an idealized thermodynamic {{process that is}} both adiabatic and reversible. The work <b>transfers</b> <b>of</b> the system are frictionless, {{and there is no}} <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> heat or <b>matter.</b> Such an idealized process is useful in engineering as a model of and basis of comparison for real processes.|$|R
25|$|Methods {{for study}} of non-equilibrium {{processes}} mostly deal with spatially continuous flow systems. In this case, the open connection between system and surroundings is usually taken to fully surround the system, {{so that there}} are no separate connections impermeable to matter but permeable to heat. Except for the special case mentioned above when there is no actual <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>matter,</b> which can be treated as if for a closed system, in strictly defined thermodynamic terms, it follows that transfer of energy as heat is not defined. In this sense, {{there is no such thing}} as 'heat flow' for a continuous-flow open system. Properly, for closed systems, one speaks of transfer of internal energy as heat, but in general, for open systems, one can speak safely only of transfer of internal energy. A factor here is that there are often cross-effects between distinct transfers, for example that transfer of one substance may cause transfer of another even when the latter has zero chemical potential gradient.|$|E
25|$|A {{thermodynamic}} process {{might be}} initiated by a thermodynamic {{operation in the}} surroundings, that mechanically increases in the controlled volume of the vapor. Some mechanical work will be done within the surroundings by the vapor, but also some of the parent liquid will evaporate and enter the vapor collection which is the contiguous surrounding subsystem. Some internal energy will accompany the vapor that leaves the system, {{but it will not}} make sense to try to uniquely identify part of that internal energy as heat and part of it as work. Consequently, the energy transfer that accompanies the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>matter</b> between the system and its surrounding subsystem cannot be uniquely split into heat and work transfers to or from the open system. The component of total energy transfer that accompanies the transfer of vapor into the surrounding subsystem is customarily called 'latent heat of evaporation', but this use of the word heat is a quirk of customary historical language, not in strict compliance with the thermodynamic definition of transfer of energy as heat. In this example, kinetic energy of bulk flow and potential energy with respect to long-range external forces such as gravity are both considered to be zero. The first law of thermodynamics refers to the change of internal energy of the open system, between its initial and final states of internal equilibrium.|$|E
2500|$|Basing his {{thinking}} on the mechanical approach, Born in 1921, and again in 1949, proposed to revise the definition of heat.

Born's definition was specifically for transfers of energy without <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>matter,</b> and it has been widely followed in textbooks (examples:). [...] Born observes that a <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>matter</b> between two systems is accompanied by a transfer of internal energy that cannot be resolved into heat and work components. There can be pathways to other systems, spatially separate from that of the matter transfer, that allow heat and work transfer independent of and simultaneous with the matter transfer. Energy is conserved in such transfers.|$|E

2500|$|Since {{the revised}} and more {{rigorous}} {{definition of the}} internal energy of a closed system rests upon the possibility of processes by which adiabatic work takes the system from one state to another, this leaves {{a problem for the}} definition of internal energy for an open system, for which adiabatic work is not in general possible.

2500|$|Bailyn also {{distinguishes the}} two {{macroscopic}} approaches as the mechanical and the thermodynamic. The thermodynamic view {{was taken by}} the founders of thermodynamics in the nineteenth century. It regards quantity of energy transferred as heat as a primitive concept coherent with a primitive concept of temperature, measured primarily by calorimetry. A calorimeter is a body in the surroundings of the system, with its own temperature and internal energy; when it is connected to the system by a path for heat transfer, changes in it measure heat transfer. The mechanical view was pioneered by Helmholtz and developed and used in the twentieth century, largely through the influence of Max Born. It regards quantity of heat transferred as heat as a derived concept, defined for closed systems as quantity of heat transferred by mechanisms other than work transfer, the latter being regarded as primitive for thermodynamics, defined by macroscopic mechanics. According to Born, the transfer of internal energy between open systems that accompanies <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>matter</b> [...] "cannot be reduced to mechanics".

40|$|The <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> {{atmospheric}} particulate <b>matter</b> {{through the}} surface marine layer was studied by comparing atmospheric and marine fluxes. Time series {{were obtained from the}} coupling of a coastal atmospheric sampling station (Cap Ferrat, French Riviera) and a marine sampling site (DYFAMED site, central Ligurian Sea). Liquid phase traps were used for measuring total atmospheric fluxes and sediment traps deployed at 200 m depth for measuring marine fluxes. Fluxes of mass, aluminium, and soluble anthropogenic metals (Cd, Pb and Zn) were obtained from both these reservoirs. Physical and biological time series data acquired at the DYFAMED site also were used to describe a three-step seasonal transfer scenario: (i) In summer and autumn, during the period of water stratification, marine fluxes are low and do not account for the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> lithogenic material, as revealed by low Al to mass flux ratios and high proportions of organic carbon at 200 m depth. Atmospheric material accumulates along the thermocline, while a series of physico-chemical processes lead to the formation of small (<= 150 µm) non-biogenic organic aggregates. (ii) In winter, the sinking of dense water that occurs in the Ligurian Sea is responsible for a rapid downward <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> the lithogenic <b>matter</b> accumulated in the surface layer. The fact that soluble trace metals (e. g., cadmium) accumulated in the surface layer are only partially found in sediment traps may indicate that sorption processes play a minor role in the formation of organic aggregates, compared with coagulation processes. (iii) In spring, nutrients brought to surface waters by the winter vertical mixing allow phytoplanktonic blooms, and the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> atmospheric <b>matter</b> is then governed by the temporal variations of biological activity.
