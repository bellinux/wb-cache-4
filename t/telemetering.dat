Through his work with Mitchell, Silberberg and Knupp, Lappen {{became involved in the}} management of <b>Telemeter,</b> a Paramount company that developed a precursor to pay and cable TV. He discusses <b>Telemeter's</b> research and development work including: pay TV; a development contract with the Bank of America for a check sorter; a machine for language translation; the construction of ERMA for the Bank of America. Lappen describes the separation of <b>Telemeter</b> Magnetics which manufactured core memories for computer companies from the pay TV operation. He discusses the growth of <b>Telemeter</b> Magnetics and the addition of disk files, buffers, and line printers to their product line. Lappen describes the decision by Paramount to sell <b>Telemeter</b> Magnetics to Ampex and recalls the decision by Erv Tomash, Bill Drake and Lappen to found DataProducts in 1962. He describes the initial capitalization of DataProducts and Cliff Helms' development of a line printer superior to any on the market. Lappen concludes the interview with an assessment of the innovations made by DataProducts and the challenges associated with forming a high technology company...|$|R
2500|$|While the {{elliptical}} {{sand wall}} was for blocking high sea winds and blown sand, concrete structures were {{integrated into the}} wall and under the ground to protect equipment and personnel from rocket explosions and enemy bombing (a sand-filled dummy warhead, called [...] "the elephant", was normally used). [...] A large gap in the wall allowed easy entry by vehicles (particularly railcars with propellants), and an open tunnel through the ellipse wall at the narrower southern end also allowed entry. Integrated into the ellipse wall next to the tunnel was a massive observation and measuring blockhouse containing the control center. [...] The control center had a double door with a bulletproof glass window from which an observer maintained telephone communication with the <b>Telemetering</b> Building at a remote location from P-7. [...] A receiver in a lighthouse near Koserow provided telemetry from rockets with the Wolman System for Doppler tracking.

5000|$|In {{military}} parlance <b>telemeter</b> has {{the specific}} {{meaning of a}} device for finding the range of a target. It is also {{used with the meaning}} [...] "rangefinder" [...] in other fields such as photography. World War II era <b>telemeters</b> worked optically with two telescopes focused on the same target but a distance apart along a baseline. The range to the target is found by measuring the difference in bearing of the two telescopes and solving the skinny triangle. Solutions can be obtained automatically, using tables or, rarely, manual calculation. The greater the distance to the target, the longer the baseline needs to be for accurate measurement. The baseline required for the <b>telemeters</b> for battleship guns is very large. More modern <b>telemeters</b> use an electronic technology such as lasers or radar.|$|R
40|$|An early-warning {{wireless}} and high-temperature <b>telemeter</b> that continuously {{monitors the}} temperature of a bearing during operation has been designed and developed {{as a part of}} this study. The <b>telemeter</b> detects imminent temperature-induced failure of the bearing nearly five minutes before conventional thermocouple sensors respond to conditional changes, leaving ample time for appropriate actions to avoid complete failure. The <b>telemeter</b> includes a temperature-sensitive capacitor that operates up to 220 °C. In addition, the <b>telemeter</b> 2 ̆ 7 s natural frequency changes with capacitance, which in turn is dependant on temperature. Information transmission between the bearing and a monitoring station is accomplished with a matched interrogator. In-situ operation was accomplished for a harsh environment up to 40, 000 RPM with a transient response of up to 0. 17 °C/s compared to 0. 06 °C/s of a standard thermocouple. ...|$|R

50|$|<b>Telemetering</b> {{information}} over wire had {{its origins}} in the 19th century. One of the first data-transmission circuits was developed in 1845 between the Russian Tsar's Winter Palace and army headquarters. In 1874, French engineers built a system of weather and snow-depth sensors on Mont Blanc that transmitted real-time information to Paris. In 1901 the American inventor C. Michalke patented the selsyn, a circuit for sending synchronized rotation information over a distance. In 1906 a set of seismic stations were built with <b>telemetering</b> to the Pulkovo Observatory in Russia. In 1912, Commonwealth Edison developed a system of telemetry to monitor electrical loads on its power grid. The Panama Canal (completed 1913-1914) used extensive telemetry systems to monitor locks and water levels.|$|E
50|$|Radio {{acoustic}} ranging was {{an early}} step along the path to modern electronic navigation systems, oceanographic <b>telemetering</b> systems, {{and the development of}} marine seismic surveying.

5000|$|The {{test vehicle}} was a 3/10-scale {{model of the}} Miles E.24/43 design except for the {{omission}} of the distinctive annular air intake of the full-scale aircraft. To maintain {{the center of gravity}} (c.g.) it was necessary to include a large balance weight (a!most 1/10 of total all-up weight) in the foremost section of the nose. The layout was further restricted by the need to maintain a constant c.g. position during the consumption of the fuels. This was achieved by placing a small tank ahead of the wing holding one third of the total oxidant (as well as the fuel in the shaped nose tank) and locating the main oxidant tank aft of tile wing. Other large components were placed fore and aft of the wing. In the space below and above the wing centre section were located the air, fuel, oxidant and warm-air pipes, <b>telemetering</b> transmitter, instruments and batteries as well as the autopilot, timing clock, wiring terminal fuses and the connections by which the test vehicle was carried on the parent aircraft. The rear section housed the combustion chamber, radar transponder, smoke-producing fluid, instruments and oscillators for combustion chamber pressure and tailplane angle, servos and dive mechanism for the tailplane which together with the fixed directional fin were fitted to the lower body prior. The single-piece wing was of mahogany with Dural inserts at the leading and trailing edges; it was of biconvex section and of tapered planform with an unswept half-chord line. The Dural inserts formed a convenient dipole-aerial system for the <b>telemetering</b> unit. (A similar arrangement on the tailplane served the radar transponder.) ...|$|E

40|$|Coordinates-based {{distance}} prediction algorithms {{can improve}} the performance of many Internet applications, especially in the peer-to-peer architecture and overlay construction. But some recent researches indicate that the performance gain via distance prediction based on coordinates, rather disappointed, can be significantly worse than the improvement obtained by direct measurement algorithm, and the inaccuracy of coordinates-based distance prediction would degrade the performance of applications evidently. In this paper, we propose a novel distance prediction algorithm base on network topology information, <b>Telemeter,</b> which uses the topology and routing information from CERNET 2 ’s ISP, instead of coordinates mechanism. <b>Telemeter</b> can predict the distance accurately between any pair of nodes from CERNET 2 without any end-to-end measurement overhead. We evaluate the performance of <b>Telemeter</b> from P 2 P-related application's perspective systematically, and compare it with three representative coordinates-based distance prediction algorithms (Triangulated Heuristic, GNP, and IDES). We demonstrate that <b>Telemeter</b> overcomes some drawback shared among coordinates-based distance prediction algorithms, and bridge the significant performance gap between measurement-based algorithm and these algorithms...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Two {{different}} versions of a temperature <b>telemeter</b> were designed and developed for use in tribological environments and their usefulness as a condition-monitoring instrument for bearings is demonstrated. The first version is a battery-powered <b>telemeter</b> and {{it is designed to}} have extremely small size and mass, which are essential for application in rolling element bearings. The second version is a remotely powered design, which has similar features to that of the battery-powered <b>telemeter</b> but provides the advantage of an almost infinite life and even smaller size. The <b>telemeters</b> were installed on the cage of a tapered rolling element bearing and tests were conducted under normal and severe conditions to determine the feasibility of the cage temperature as a condition-monitoring parameter on a bearing. A finite element model of the cage was developed to study and compare with experimental results. The tests conducted indicate that the cage temperature demonstrates a very fast response to tribological changes such as interruption in lubrication supply, speed or torque variation and it is thus a good parameter for determining the temperature condition of a rolling element bearing...|$|R
