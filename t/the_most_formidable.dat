5|$|Edward III (13 November 1312– 21 June 1377) was King of England from 25 January 1327 {{until his}} death; he is noted for his {{military}} success and for restoring royal authority after the disastrous and unorthodox reign of his father, EdwardII. EdwardIII transformed the Kingdom of England {{into one of}} <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>formidable</b> military powers in Europe. His long reign of 50 years was the second longest in medieval England and saw vital developments in legislation and government—in particular {{the evolution of the}} English parliament—as well as the ravages of the Black Death.|$|E
5|$|In 1949, Bickford went 16–11 with a 4.25 {{earned run}} average and made the National League All-Star team. He {{finished}} seventh {{in the league in}} complete games (15) and third in games started (36) behind teammate Warren Spahn and Ken Raffensberger of the Cincinnati Reds. He lost a no-hitter in the ninth inning in one of those games. At season's end Bickford, alongside Spahn and teammate Johnny Sain created one of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>formidable</b> pitching trios in the league for the next several years.|$|E
5|$|Seven other Democratic {{candidates}} for lieutenant governor entered the race, <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>formidable</b> being sitting attorney general John B. Breckinridge. While Combs lost to Ford in the gubernatorial primary, Carroll won the separate primary for lieutenant governor, {{partly on the}} strength of the Eastern Kentucky votes he gained from his association with Combs. Carroll went on to defeat Republican Jim Host in the general election for lieutenant governor. As lieutenant governor, Carroll chaired the Legislative Research Commission and the National Conference of Lieutenant Governors.|$|E
2500|$|The {{rejection}} of Semmelweis's empirical observations is often traced to belief perseverance, the psychological tendency of clinging to discredited beliefs. Also, some historians of science argue that resistance to path-breaking contributions of obscure scientists is common and [...] "constitutes <b>the</b> single <b>most</b> <b>formidable</b> block to scientific advances." ...|$|R
25|$|The Jewish {{race has}} been chosen by me {{as a subject}} of discussion, because, as will be shown, it {{presents}} <b>the</b> gravest and <b>most</b> <b>formidable</b> difficulties for my views.|$|R
50|$|In a Nazi office, Dracula assures Adolf Hitler {{that the}} three vampires suspect nothing. Darla and Anselina had been used as bait so that the Nazis could capture who Dracula {{describes}} as <b>the</b> three <b>most</b> <b>formidable</b> vampires, save for himself. In return, Hitler promises to release Dracula's favoured gypsy tribes.|$|R
5|$|The most {{significant}} threat the Roman Empire faced {{during the reign}} of Domitian arose from the northern provinces of Illyricum, where the Suebi, the Sarmatians and the Dacians continuously harassed Roman settlements along the Danube river. Of these, the Sarmatians and the Dacians posed <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>formidable</b> threat. In approximately 84 or 85 the Dacians, led by King Decebalus, crossed the Danube into the province of Moesia, wreaking havoc and killing the Moesian governor Oppius Sabinus.|$|E
5|$|Another {{improvement}} {{from the}} 12th century onwards {{was the creation}} of shell keeps, involving replacing the wooden keep on the motte with a circular stone wall. Buildings could be built around the inside of the shell, producing a small inner courtyard. Restormel Castle {{is a classic example of}} this development with a perfectly circular wall and a square entrance tower while the later Launceston Castle, although more ovoid than circular, is another good example of the design and one of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>formidable</b> castles of the period. Round castles were unusually popular throughout Cornwall and Devon. Although the circular design held military advantages, these only really mattered in the 13th century onwards; the origins of 12th-century circular design were the circular design of the mottes; indeed, some designs were less than circular in order to accommodate irregular mottes, such as that at Windsor Castle.|$|E
5|$|By the 2nd century AD {{the territories}} of Persia were {{controlled}} by the Arsacid dynasty and known as the Parthian Empire. Due {{in large part to}} their employment of powerful heavy cavalry and mobile horse archers, Parthia was <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>formidable</b> enemy of the Roman Empire in the east. As early as 53 BC, the Roman general Crassus had invaded Parthia, but he was killed and his army was defeated at the Battle of Carrhae. In the years following Carrhae, the Romans were divided in civil war and hence unable to campaign against Parthia. Trajan also campaigned against the Parthians from 114–117 AD and briefly captured their capital Ctesiphon, putting the puppet ruler Parthamaspates on the throne. However, rebellions in Babylonia and the Jewish revolts in Judea made it difficult to maintain the captured province and the territories were abandoned.|$|E
50|$|Cashman was a hard-grinding left winger on <b>the</b> era's <b>most</b> <b>formidable</b> forward {{line with}} superstar centre Phil Esposito and right wing Ken Hodge. His {{role was to}} get into the corners and battle for loose pucks, feeding them to Esposito or Hodge. Cashman was also a {{tenacious}} forechecker and he also served as an enforcer to protect Esposito and Bobby Orr.|$|R
50|$|Led by {{team captain}} & IHL legend Jock Callander and a 40-goal {{explosion}} from right winger Keith Osborne (each in their only {{season with the}} club), head coach Gene Ubriaco's Knights {{would prove to be}} among <b>the</b> league's <b>most</b> <b>formidable</b> sides, amassing franchise single-season records in wins (52), points (111) & goals scored (333) en route to claiming the Atlantic Division championship.|$|R

5|$|Sham, {{who had won}} the Santa Anita Derby, {{was seen}} as <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>formidable</b> {{challenger}} to Secretariat in the Derby because of his finish ahead of Secretariat in the Wood and his Santa Anita victory. Coming off {{the heels of the}} his victory at the Wood, Angle Light was seen as a threat to win. Angle Light was also trained by Lucien Laurin, along with as Secretariat, and thus Secretariat and Angle Light were coupled for betting purposes. Flamingo Stakes winner Our Native finished first or second in seven of his nine starts during the 1973 season, causing him to be named as a contender. Blue Grass Stakes winner My Gallant and Shecky Greene, who won the Fountain of Youth Stakes, were both trained in Chicago by Lou Goldline, which also resulted in their odds being coupled. Goldline said the two horses were similar and would do well at Churchill Downs because they both liked fast tracks. Impecunious, who was victorious in the Arkansas Derby, was initially entered in the race, but withdrew two days before because of a bruised heel. None of the competing horses had been sired by a previous Derby winner.|$|E

50|$|Sonni Ali reigned from 1464 to 1492, {{after the}} death of Sulayman Dama. Like Songhai kings before him, Ali was a Muslim. In the late 1460s, he conquered many of the Songhai's {{neighboring}} states, including what remained of the Mali Empire. Sonni Ali was considered <b>the</b> empire's <b>most</b> <b>formidable</b> military strategist and conqueror. Under his rule Songhai reached a size of over 1,400,000 square kilometers.|$|R
25|$|In {{order to}} contain the serious Zambal uprisings, Salcedo ordered a fort be built in Paynauen. Fort Paynauen was once <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>formidable</b> Spanish {{garrison}} in Central Luzon during the first century of the Spanish regime in the Philippines. Also known as Playa Honda, the fort was constructed {{on the advice of}} Admiral de Monforte.|$|E

60|$|The mob, {{gathered}} in such numbers {{as to be}} for <b>the</b> time being <b>most</b> <b>formidable,</b> indulged in open threats against Americans, and it was believed by the public generally that American interests, {{and the safety of}} citizens of the United States in Havana, demanded the protection of a war-vessel.|$|R
25|$|Barnes left Watford on 9 June 1987 in a £900,000 deal to join Kenny Dalglish's Liverpool, {{after making}} 233 League {{appearances}} for the Hornets and scoring 65 goals. He {{joined at the}} same time as England teammate Peter Beardsley and linked up with new signings John Aldridge and Ray Houghton to form one of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>formidable</b> attacking lines of Liverpool's history, which was completed a year later when Ian Rush re-signed for Liverpool.|$|E
25|$|He {{never felt}} {{disturbed}} when others spoke to him, sought advice or discussed matters. He had visitors ranging from foreign missionaries to local scholars, who had serious discussions {{with him on}} religious matters. His publications were highly rated by scholars. They often wondered how a non-Brahmin could master such profound knowledge of Hinduism. His thirst for knowledge and his ascetic habits ‘made his contemporaries acknowledge him as <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>formidable</b> intellectual in the Durbar,’ formed by the group of ascetics in the New Dispensation after Keshub Chunder Sen’s death.|$|E
25|$|Kesselring {{was given}} {{command of the}} whole of Italy and {{immediately}} ordered the preparation {{of a series of}} defensive lines across Italy, south of Rome. Two lines, the Volturno and the Barbara, were used to delay the Allied advance so as to buy time to prepare <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>formidable</b> defensive positions, which formed the Winter Line – the collective name for the Gustav Line and two associated defensive lines on the west of the Apennine Mountains, the Bernhardt and Hitler lines (the latter had been renamed the Senger Line by 23 May 1944).|$|E
5000|$|In 1590, Hideyoshi {{completed}} {{construction of}} the Osaka Castle, <b>the</b> largest and <b>most</b> <b>formidable</b> in all Japan, to guard the western approaches to Kyoto.

25|$|Milan's figurative art {{flourished in}} the Middle-Ages, and with the Visconti family being major patrons of the arts, the city became an {{important}} centre of Gothic art and architecture (Milan Cathedral being <b>the</b> city's <b>most</b> <b>formidable</b> work of Gothic architecture). Leonardo worked in Milan from 1482 until 1499. He was commissioned to paint the Virgin of the Rocks for the Confraternity of the Immaculate Conception and The Last Supper for the monastery of Santa Maria delle Grazie.|$|R
50|$|Billy (Xavier Samuel) and Lucy (Morgan Griffin) grew up {{together}} {{in a small town}} in Australia, where they form one of <b>the</b> town's <b>most</b> <b>formidable</b> ute driving teams.

25|$|The medieval Bulgarian {{army was}} the primary {{military}} body of the First and the Second Bulgarian Empires. During the first decades after {{the foundation of the}} country, the army consisted of a Bulgar cavalry and a Slavic infantry. The core of the Bulgarian army was the heavy cavalry, which consisted of 12,000–30,000 heavily armed riders. At its height in the 9th and 10th centuries, it was one of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>formidable</b> military forces in Europe and was feared by its enemies. There are several documented cases of Byzantine commanders abandoning an invasion because of a reluctance to confront the Bulgarian army on its home territory.|$|E
25|$|The {{operational}} groups slowly advanced south, capturing Nencheng and Peian on 20 and 21 August. The Kwantung Army formally surrendered on 18 August, and the army's {{operational groups}} slowly moved towards Qiqihar and Harbin. It reached Qiqihar on 21 August, where it linked up with {{troops from the}} 36th Army. The Japanese around the fortified regions were subsequently described by historian David Glantz as <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>formidable</b> faced by Soviet troops during the invasion of Manchuria. The level of resistance and road conditions slowed the army's advance {{to an average of}} 20 kilometers a day, one of the lowest speeds of Soviet forces during the invasion. During the invasion, it advanced a depth of 200 kilometers into Manchuria.|$|E
25|$|The German PzKpfw III and IV {{were the}} only German tanks that could outmatch the SOMUA S35 in battle. The SOMUA S35 was {{generally}} considered to be one of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>formidable</b> tank during the campaign in the west. German tactics proved superior; by using radio to coordinate manoeuvre, the Germans outwitted the French who were limited to rigid, static positioning as in the First World War. The French tanks could not communicate with such fluidity or rapidity. The French missed tactical and operational opportunities and were poorly coordinated. The German tanks also had more crew members, so the commander could concentrate on command tasks but French commanders had to act as gunner and assistant gunner.|$|E

5000|$|Perhaps <b>the</b> shell’s <b>most</b> <b>formidable</b> {{feature is}} <b>the</b> {{programmable}} polymers integrated into its structure. [...] These polymers enable the shell to stretch and contract like human muscle, but with considerably greater force. Hence, the shell increases Hardware's natural strength to superhuman levels. Initially, the shell amplified Curtis’s strength {{so that he}} could lift (press) about 5 tons. However, Hardware's battle with the SYSTEMatic Mark III indicates that Curtis has significantly increased the shell's strength augmentation abilities.|$|R
