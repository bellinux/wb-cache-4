5|$|The Mantoux {{tuberculin}} {{skin test}} {{is often used}} to screen people at high risk for TB. Those who have been previously immunized may have a false-positive <b>test</b> <b>result.</b> The test may be falsely negative in those with sarcoidosis, Hodgkin's lymphoma, malnutrition, and most notably, active tuberculosis. Interferon gamma release assays, on a blood sample, are recommended in those who are positive to the Mantoux test. These are not affected by immunization or most environmental mycobacteria, so they generate fewer false-positive results. However, they are affected by M. szulgai, M. marinum, and M. kansasii. IGRAs may increase sensitivity when used in addition to the skin test, but may be less sensitive than the skin test when used alone.|$|E
5|$|The {{specificity}} of RSTs {{for the presence}} of GAS is at least 95%, with some studies finding close to 100% specificity. Therefore, if the <b>test</b> <b>result</b> is positive, the presence of GAS is highly likely. However, 5% to 20% of individuals carry GAS in their throats without symptomatic infection, so the presence of GAS in an individual with pharyngitis does not prove that this organism is responsible for the infection. The sensitivity of lateral flow RSTs is somewhat lower at 65% to 80%. Therefore, a negative result from such a test cannot be used to rule out GAS pharyngitis, a considerable disadvantage compared with microbial culture, which has a sensitivity of 90% to 95%. However, newer optical immunoassay RSTs have been found to have a much higher sensitivity of 94%.|$|E
5|$|Kidney {{and heart}} {{diseases}} {{have been reported}} in the breed. In an experiment directed by John C. Fyfea, Rebeccah L. Kurzhals, and others, it was concluded that a complex rearrangement in the breed's Glycogen branching enzyme (GBE1) can cause both a perinatal hypoglycemic collapse and a late-juvenile-onset neuromuscular degeneration in glycogen storage disease type IV in the breed. This disorder, while rare, can prove fatal to cats that have it. There are DNA tests available for GSD IV, and it is highly recommended (some cat associations obligate their Norwegian Forest cat breeder members) to carry out the DNA test before using such animals for breeding. PawPeds provide a pedigree database which comes together with health programmes, through publishing each single cat's <b>test</b> <b>result,</b> to provide useful information for breeders to make a well-informed breeding decision. The breed has also been known to suffer from hip dysplasia, which is a rare, partially hereditary disease of the hip joint.|$|E

40|$|Currently, several state Departments of Transportation (DOTs) {{are using}} {{contractor}} <b>test</b> <b>results,</b> {{in conjunction with}} verification <b>test</b> <b>results,</b> for construction and materials acceptance purposes. While the reasons for using contractor <b>test</b> <b>results</b> for construction and materials acceptance purposes are real (essentially shortage of state DOT staff and intensive construction schedules), the practice itself has fundamental pitfalls. This research reveals the conceptual and technical pitfalls of using contractor <b>test</b> <b>results</b> for acceptance and payment purposes; identifies and ranks potential alternatives and improvements {{to the use of}} contractor <b>test</b> <b>results</b> for acceptance and payment purposes; and investigates the potential application of skip-lot sampling as a means for reducing acceptance sampling and testing for highway agencies...|$|R

40|$|This report {{discusses}} {{the most relevant}} issues concerning using student <b>test</b> <b>results</b> in OECD countries. Initially the report {{provides an overview of}} how student <b>test</b> <b>results</b> are reported in OECD countries and how stakeholders in these countries use and perceive of the results. The report then reviews the literature relating to using student <b>test</b> <b>results</b> for accountability and improvement purposes. Two general findings can be drawn from the literature: (1) accountability based on student <b>test</b> <b>results</b> can be a powerful tool for changing teacher and school behaviour, but it often creates unintended strategic behaviour, and (2) no test can be a perfect indicator of student performance. Drawing from these findings the report {{discusses the}} advantages and disadvantages of using student <b>test</b> <b>results</b> for accountability and improvement. The discussion touches upon four themes: (1) assessment design, (2) the use of <b>test</b> <b>results,</b> (3) stakeholder involvement, and (4) implementation...|$|R

Since 2009, all the Volvo models that EuroNCAP have tested have {{received}} five-star safety ratings: Volvo C30, V40, V60, V60 plug-in hybrid, XC60 and V70.

25|$|It is {{possible}} to do a calculation of likelihood ratios for tests with continuous values or more than two outcomes {{which is similar to}} the calculation for dichotomous outcomes.

25|$|Especially in Finland, Vainio's {{positive}} <b>test</b> <b>result</b> {{was a big}} {{scandal and}} provoked public indignation. Although Vainio's positive doping test after the Rotterdam Marathon was unofficial because of the missing B-sample, public pressure forced the Finnish Athletics Association to disqualify all of Vainio's results after Rotterdam and to discharge Antti Lanamäki from his duties. Vainio himself {{did not want to}} provide detailed information about the incident, probably partly because he was himself still investigating the reasons for the positive <b>test</b> <b>result.</b> Finnish mass media demanded an explanation, and one story released to the public alleged that Vainio's training partner, janitor Alpo Nyrönen, had given Vainio a hormone injection by accident, instead of the intended Vitamin B injection. Vainio himself released the explanation about the confusion between anabolic steroids and testosterone only several years after the incident.|$|E
25|$|Immediately {{prior to}} Stage 12, reports began to surface that the then current race leader, Michael Rasmussen {{had been dropped}} by the Danish Cycling Union in the month prior to the Tour {{following}} claims he had missed three out-of-competition doping tests.

50|$|A Y-DNA test {{ranges from}} 10 to 111 markers on the Y chromosome. Most surname {{projects}} suggest at least 25 markers. Test results tell how many repeats a given subject has {{at a particular}} marker; the variations of repeats are known as alleles. For example, at DYS455, the results will normally show 8, 9, 10, 11, or 12 repeats. The specific <b>test</b> <b>results</b> for a given individual {{are referred to as}} a haplotype. When a surname project has enough participants' <b>test</b> <b>results,</b> it can group similar <b>test</b> <b>results</b> together and determine a modal haplotype for each such group of similar <b>test</b> <b>results.</b>|$|R

40|$|This {{case study}} is an {{in-depth}} examination of how Erika (a pseudonym) interpreted and understood her genetic <b>test</b> <b>results</b> for breast cancer susceptibility. Her experience {{is presented in the}} form of a biography, which was built from key passages retrieved from the semi structured interview the author conducted at Erikas home. The interview data showed that Erikas interpretation and understanding of her inconclusive <b>test</b> <b>results</b> were embedded in her own and her familys experiences with breast cancer. Her interpretation of her <b>test</b> <b>results</b> was influenced by perception of risk for future breast cancers for herself and her family, as well as from the continued etiological uncertainty of her current breast cancer. Although unfinished, Erikas experience of receiving inconclusive genetic <b>test</b> <b>results</b> for breast cancer susceptibility provides examples of possible universal themes within the experience of others who receive similar <b>test</b> <b>results...</b>|$|R
