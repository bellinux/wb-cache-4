40|$|Type 1 {{diabetes}} {{is caused by}} the autoimmune destruction of pancreatic beta cells. Here we show that administration of a human monoclonal antibody (b 96 · 11) specific to the 65 -kDa isoform of glutamate decarboxylase (GAD 65) to prediabetic non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice significantly delays the onset of autoimmune diabetes. We found this effect to be epitope-specific, as only b 96 · 11 showed this <b>therapeutic</b> <b>property,</b> while a GAD 65 -specific human monoclonal control antibody (b 78) derived from the same patient, but specific to a different determinant of GAD 65, had no significant effect on the progression of disease. Administration of b 96 · 11 or b 78 to NOD mice was accompanied by the generation of anti-idiotypic antibodies. Importantly, the induced anti-idiotypic antibodies were specific for the immunizing antibody and blocked the binding of GAD 65 by the respective antibody. These findings suggest a potential role for the internal image of the GAD 65 determinant recognized by b 96 · 11 in the anti-idiotypic antibody, supporting an immunomodulatory role for GAD 65 -specific autoantibodies, as originally postulated by Jerne...|$|E

Bolus administration of the aggregating agent ADP dose-dependently reduced the number of circulating free platelets. Intravenous infusions of MAHMA NONOate (3 - 30 nmol/kg/min) dose-dependently inhibited the effect of 0. 3 mumol/kg ADP. MAHMA NONOate was approximately 10 -fold more potent than GSNO. MAHMA NONOate (0. 3 - 10 nmol/kg/min) also reduced systemic artery pressure and was again 10 -fold more potent than GSNO. Thus MAHMA NONOate has both platelet inhibitory and vasodepressor effects in vivo. The dose ranges for these two effects overlapped, although blood pressure was affected at slightly lower doses. The platelet inhibitory effects compared favourably with those of GSNO, even though NONOates generate free radical NO which, in theory, could have been scavenged by haemoglobin. Therefore platelet inhibition may be a useful <b>therapeutic</b> <b>property</b> of NONOates. (C) 2003 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|Aims: The study {{aimed to}} explore the {{antioxidant}} activity of ethanolic leaf extract of Manihot esculenta Crantz leaves (MEC) in wistar rats. Materials and Methods: Ethanolic extract of MEC leaves in the doses of 50 mg/kg, 100 mg/kg, and 200 mg/kg were used in wistar rats of either sex. The oxidative stress was produced by overdose of acetaminophen and estimation of serum concentration of various enzymes such as malonaldehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), reduced glutathione (GSH), and catalase (CAT) were measured by standard biochemical methods. Silymarin (100 mg/kg) {{was used as a}} standard drug for assessment of antioxidant status. Statistical Analysis Used: Results were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance followed by Student's unpaired t-test. Results: When compared with the standard antioxidant silymarin, MEC extract did not exhibit antioxidant activity in terms of MDA level reduction. However, it significantly increased serum levels of the antioxidant enzymes (SOD, GSH, and CAT) exerting a potent antioxidant effect in a graded manner.

40|$|Herbs and {{minerals}} are the integral parts of traditional systems {{of medicine in}} many countries. Herbo-Mineral medicinal preparations called Bhasma are unique to the Ayurvedic and Siddha systems of Indian Traditional Medicine. These preparations have been used since long and are {{claimed to be the}} very effective and potent dosage form. However, there is dearth of scientific analytical studies carried out on these products, and even the existing ones suffer from incomplete analysis. Jasada Bhasma is a unique preparation of zinc belonging to this class. This particular preparation has been successfully used by traditional practitioners for the treatment of diabetes and age-related eye diseases. This work presents a first comprehensive physicochemical characterization of Jasada Bhasma using modern state-of-the-art techniques such as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), inductively coupled plasma (ICP), elemental analysis with energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDAX), dynamic light scattering (DLS), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM).

Unlike certain lower animals such as amphibians, fishes, and birds, in humans, hair cells cannot be regenerated once they are killed or damaged; thus, there are no therapeutic options to cure NIHL. Therefore, {{it is more important}} to protect hair cells from the noise before the damage occurs. In this study, we report the protective effect of Yang Mi Ryung extract (YMRE) against NIHL; this novel <b>therapeutic</b> <b>property</b> of YMRE has not been reported previously. Our data demonstrates that the hearing ability damaged by noise is markedly restored in mice preadministrated with YMRE before noise exposure, to the level of normal control group. Our study also provides the molecular mechanism underlying the protective effect of YMRE against NIHL by showing that YMRE significantly blocks noise-induced apoptotic cell death and reduces reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in cochleae. Moreover, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis demonstrates that YMRE has anti-inflammatory properties, suppressing the mRNA levels of TNFα and IL- 1 β induced by noise exposure. In conclusion, YMRE could be a useful preventive intervention to prevent hearing impairment induced by the exposure to excessive noise...|$|E

40|$|In {{an early}} poem, "Sleep and Poetry," Keats {{presents}} his thought on poetry's healing power, arguing that poetry {{can be both}} therapeutic and transcendent. From the examples Keats affords in "Sleep and Poetry," "The Fall of Hyperion: A Dream" and elsewhere, it can be deduced that the consoling effects of what I call Keats's "therapeutic poetry" arise from the mingling of illusion and disillusionment. This poetry creates an illusive world in which readers can not only temporarily escape from the frets of reality, but also experience an awakening from {{the dream of the}} poem, a moment that lifts the reader's mind to a higher level of tranquil meditation. In many of Keats's poems, innocence and experience as well as illusion and disillusionment overlap in one dream to produce the <b>therapeutic</b> <b>property</b> defined by Keats in "Sleep and Poetry.

40|$|Using TLR {{agonists}} {{in cancer}} treatment can have either beneficial or detrimental effects. Therefore, {{it is important}} to determine their effect on the tumor growth and understand the underlying mechanisms in animal tumor models. In this study, we report a general immunotherapeutic activity of a synthetic bacterial lipoprotein (BLP), a TLR 1 /TLR 2 agonist, on established lung carcinoma, leukemia, and melanoma in mice. Systemic treatment of 3 LL tumor-bearing mice with BLP, but not LPS, led to a dose-dependent tumor regression and a long-lasting protective response against tumor rechallenge. The BLP-mediated tumor remission was neither mediated by a direct tumoricidal activity nor by innate immune cells, because it lacked therapeutic effect in immunodeficient SCID mice. Instead, BLP treatment reduced the suppressive function of Foxp 3 + regulatory T cells (Tregs) and enhanced the cytotoxicity of tumor-specific CTL in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, adoptive cotransfer of BLP-pretreated but not untreated CTL and Tregs from wild-type but not from TLR 2 (-/-) mice was sufficient to restore antitumor immunity in SCID mice by reciprocally modulating Treg and CTL function. These results demonstrate that the TLR 1 /TLR 2 agonist BLP may have a general tumor <b>therapeutic</b> <b>property</b> involving reciprocal downregulation of Treg and upregulation of CTL function.

40|$|The {{tricyclic}} anticonvulsant drugs phenytoin, carbamazepine, and lamotrigine block neuronal voltage-gated Na+ channels, {{and their}} binding sites to domain IV-S 6 in the channel's inner pore overlap {{with those of}} local anesthetic drugs. These anticonvulsants are neutral, {{in contrast to the}} mostly positively charged local anesthetics, but their open/inactivated-state blocking affinities are similar. Using a model of the open pore of the Na+ channel that we developed by homology with the crystal structures of potassium channels, we have docked these three anticonvulsants with residues identified by mutagenesis as important for their binding energy. The three drugs show a common pharmacophore, including an aromatic ring that has an aromatic-aromatic interaction with Tyr- 1771 of NaV 1. 2 and a polar amide or imide that interacts with the aromatic ring of Phe- 1764 by a low-energy amino-aromatic hydrogen bond. The second aromatic ring is nearly at a right angle to the pharmacophore and fills the pore lumen, probably interacting with the other S 6 segments and physically occluding the inner pore to block Na+ permeation. Hydrophobic interactions with this second aromatic ring may contribute an important component to binding for anticonvulsants, which compensates energetically for the absence of positive charge in their structures. Voltage dependence of block, their important <b>therapeutic</b> <b>property,</b> results from their interaction with Phe- 1764, which connects them to the voltage sensors. Their use dependence is modest and this results from being neutral, with a fast drug off-rate after repolarization, allowing a normal action potential rate {{in the presence of the}} drugs...|$|E

40|$|Type 2 {{diabetes}} mellitus {{has been identified}} as a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). An impairment of insulin signaling as well as a desensitization of its receptor has been found in AD brains. Glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) normalises insulin signaling by facilitating insulin release. GIP directly modulates neurotransmitter release, LTP formation, and protects synapses from the detrimental effects of beta-amyloid fragments on LTP formation, and cell proliferation of progenitor cells in the dentate gyrus. Here we investigate the potential <b>therapeutic</b> <b>property</b> of the new long lasting incretin hormone analogue D-Ala 2 GIP on key symptoms found in a mouse model of Alzheimer' disease (APPswe/PS 1 detaE 9). METHODS: D-Ala 2 GIP was injected for 21 days at 25 nmol/kg ip once daily in APP/PS 1 male mice and wild type (WT) littermates aged 6 or 12 months of age. Amyloid plaque load, inflammation biomarkers, synaptic plasticity in the brain (LTP), and memory were measured. RESULTS: D-Ala 2 GIP improved memory in WT mice and rescued the cognitive decline of 12 months old APP/PS 1 mice in two different memory tasks. Furthermore, deterioration of synaptic function in the dentate gyrus and cortex was prevented in 12 months old APP/PS 1 mice. D-Ala 2 GIP facilitated synaptic plasticity in APP/PS 1 and WT mice and reduced the number of amyloid plaques in the cortex of D-Ala 2 GIP injected APP/PS 1 mice. The inflammatory response in microglia was also reduced. CONCLUSION: The results demonstrate that D-Ala 2 GIP has neuroprotective properties on key hallmarks found in AD.

40|$|Mukta shouktic bhasma (MSB) is a {{traditional}} Ayurvedic medicinal preparation. This biomedicine is synthesized through special calcination of mother of pearl as mentioned in the classical Ayurvedic text. Physicochemical characterization of MSB was carried out using modern techniques such as transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray powder diffraction analysis, Fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy, inductively coupled plasma analysis, energy dispersive X-ray analysis, and thermogravimetric analysis. The study showed that the raw material mukta shouktic (mother of pearl) is an organo-mineral matrix containing calcium carbonate in aragonite form. The aragonite form of calcium carbonatetransforms to a stable calcite form {{during the process of}} bhasma formation and forms the main crystalline component of MSB. The heat treatment does result in partial conversion of calcite to calcium oxide, which appears as calcium hydroxide(not more than 2 % w/w) in the final product. The organic content of processed material degraded gradually. Physical evaluation revealed that MSB is a fine grayish white powder having a poor flow property with narrow particle size distribution of 1. 22 to 22. 52 m having a mean particle size of 10. 20 ± 0. 45 m. A clearly identifiable fraction of MSB particles was below 50 nanometer. The presence of nanosized particles in MSB might impart the <b>therapeutic</b> <b>property</b> of this medicine. Trace element analysis of MSB revealed the presence of metals, like arsenic, lead, chromium, cadmium, mercury, and tin under regulatory acceptable limits at the prescribed dose of MSB.

40|$|Quercus cortex (Oak bark) {{has been}} used in European folk {{medicine}} since medieval times for treatment of diarrhea, stomatitis, pharyngitis and skin inflammations. Its antimicrobial activity is a well-known <b>therapeutic</b> <b>property</b> of oak bark, and its novel anti-quorum sensing (QS) ability has also been described recently. In this study, we examined the bioactive compounds of Quercus cortex extract and compared their direct antibacterial and regulatory anti-QS effects against Chromobacterium violaceum CV 026 in a biotest. Evaluation of the original Quercus cortex extract showed weak antibacterial and prominent anti-QS activities that were retained and completely restored when the samples were dried and re-hydrated. The one-step liquid chromatography result indicated that the anti-QS activity might be determined by hydrophobic compounds; however, the subsequent reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography led to dissipation and loss of the activity. The gas chromatography–mass spectrometry gave excellent resolution between a majority of the compounds. Based on this result, 10 of the 35 identified small molecules were selected for further screening. The subsequent investigation indicated several compounds determined both the antibacterial and anti-QS activities of the Quercus cortex extract. Direct antibacterial activity was shown for 1, 2, 3 -benzenetriol and 4 -propyl- 1, 3 -benzenediol, while sub-inhibitory concentrations of these compounds led to anti-QS effects.
