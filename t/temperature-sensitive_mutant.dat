5000|$|FtsZ is {{a protein}} encoded by the ftsZ gene that assembles into a ring {{at the future}} site of the septum of {{bacterial}} cell division. This is a prokaryotic homologue to the eukaryotic protein tubulin. FtsZ has been named after [...] "Filamenting <b>temperature-sensitive</b> <b>mutant</b> Z". The hypothesis was that cell division mutants of E. coli would grow as filaments due to {{the inability of the}} daughter cells to separate from one another.|$|E

Complementation {{analysis of}} the Dales collection of vaccinia virus <b>temperature-sensitive</b> <b>mutants.</b> Virology 305, 240 – 259), however not all complementation groups have previously been assigned to single genes on the viral genome.

40|$|Pathogenicities of 10 <b>temperature-sensitive</b> <b>mutants</b> of Venezuelan {{encephalitis}} virus {{were studied}} using the hamster model of human virulence. The parental strain and {{nine of the}} <b>temperature-sensitive</b> <b>mutants</b> produced lethal infections in hamsters. Strain ts 126 showed reduced hamster virulence. Deaths with the lethal mutants usually occurred 1 to 3 days later than with parental virus. Nine mutants produced lower levels of viremia than parental virus. Attenuation of ts 126 was related to restriction of viral growth in spleen and probably bone marrow and to absence of the usual pathological lesions in hemopoietic tissues and brain, but was functionally unrelated to temperature sensitivity since temperatures of both normal and infected hamsters remained within the permissive range of the mutant. Deaths did not correlate with titers of the 10 mutants in blood at permissive temperatures or with reversions of four <b>temperature-sensitive</b> <b>mutants</b> to non-temperature-sensitive virus in hamsters...|$|R

40|$|Conditional lethal YidC mutants {{have been}} {{isolated}} {{to decipher the}} role of YidC in the assembly of Sec-depend-ent and Sec-independent membrane proteins. We now show that the membrane insertion of the Sec-independ-ent M 13 procoat-lep protein is inhibited {{in a short time}} in a <b>temperature-sensitive</b> <b>mutant</b> when shifted to the nonpermissive temperature. This provides an addi-tional line of evidence that YidC plays a direct role in the insertion of the Sec-independent M 13 procoat pro-tein. However, in the <b>temperature-sensitive</b> <b>mutant,</b> the insertion of the Sec-independent Pf 3 phage coat protein and the Sec-dependent leader peptidase were not strongly inhibited at the restricted temperatures.

40|$|The model {{filamentous}} fungus Neurospora crassa {{has been studied}} for over fifty years and many <b>temperature-sensitive</b> <b>mutants</b> have been generated. While most of these have been mapped genetically, many remain anonymous. The mutation in the N. crassa <b>temperature-sensitive</b> lethal <b>mutant</b> un- 7 was identified by a complementation based approach as being in the open reading frame designated NCU 00651 on linkage group I. Other mutations in this gene have been identified that lead to a temperature-sensitive morphological phenotype called png- 1. The mutations underlying un- 7 result in a serine to phenylalanine change at position 273 and an isoleucine to valine change at position 390, while the mutation in png- 1 was found {{to result in a}} serine to leucine change at position 279 although there were other conservative changes in this allele. The overall morphology of the strain carrying the un- 7 mutation is compared to strains carrying the png- 1 mutation and these mutations are evaluated in the context of other <b>temperature-sensitive</b> <b>mutants</b> in Neurospora...|$|R

40|$|The encephalitogenic {{potential}} of nine <b>temperature-sensitive</b> <b>mutants</b> of measles virus was determined in newborn golden Syrian hamsters. The parental virus produced acute encephalitis without any prior adaptation. Six of the mutants were attenuated, two were virulent, {{and one was}} associated with hydrocephalus with acute onset. The attenuated mutants, blocked before measles virus antigen and ribonucleic acid synthesis at 39 C, were all members of one complementation group. The virulent <b>temperature-sensitive</b> <b>mutants,</b> defective in hemolysin antigen synthesis at 39 C, were members of a second complementation group. The hydrocephalus-inducing mutant was genetically distinct from the other mutants. The mechanism of attenuation most probably does not involve a temperature-induced inhibition of virus replication, but rather appears {{to be related to}} the partial defectiveness of the mutants under permissive conditions...|$|R

40|$|We {{have used}} a set of seven <b>temperature-sensitive</b> <b>mutants</b> in the DNA {{polymerase}} I gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae to investigate the role of DNA polymerase I in various aspects of DNA synthesis in vivo. Previously, we showed that DNA polymerase I is required for mitotic DNA replication. Here we extend our studies to several stages of meiosis and repair of X-ray-induced damage. We find that sporulation is blocked {{in all of the}} DNA polymerase <b>temperature-sensitive</b> <b>mutants</b> and that premeiotic DNA replication does not occur. Commitment to meiotic recombination is only 2 % of wild-type levels. Thus, DNA polymerase I is essential for these steps. However, repair of X-ray-induced single-strand breaks is not defective in the DNA polymerase <b>temperature-sensitive</b> <b>mutants,</b> and DNA polymerase I is therefore not essential for repair of such lesions. These results suggest that DNA polymerase II or III or both, the two other nuclear yeast DNA polymerases for which roles have not yet been established, carry out repair in the absence of DNA polymerase I, but that DNA polymerase II and III cannot compensate for loss of DNA polymerase I in meiotic replication and recombination. These results do not, however, rule out essential roles for DNA polymerase II or III or both in addition to that for DNA polymerase I...|$|R

40|$|The obg gene {{is part of}} the spo 0 B {{sporulation}} operon and {{codes for}} a GTP-binding protein which is essential for growth.

Temperature shift experiments revealed that the mutant was able to continue cell division for 2 to 3 generations at the nonpermissive temperature. Such experiments carried out during sporulation showed that Obg was necessary for the transition from vegetative growth to stage 0 or stage II of sporulation, but sporulation subsequent to these stages was unaffected at the nonpermissive temperature. Spores of the <b>temperature-sensitive</b> <b>mutant</b> germinated normally at the nonpermissive temperature but failed to outgrow.

40|$|<b>Temperature-sensitive</b> <b>mutants</b> {{were derived}} from Saccharomyces cerevisiae Y 5 α by ethyl methane {{sulfonate}} mutagenesis, {{in a search for}} mutants that would produce methionine-rich protein at the nonpermissive temperature. A total of 132 mutant strains were selected which showed adequate growth on minimal medium at 25 °C but little or no growth on the same medium supplemented with a high concentration (2 mg/ml) of l-methionine at 37 °C. Several of these mutants were found to increase the proportion of methionine in their protein to much higher levels than that of the wild-type parent after a temperature shift from 25 to 37 °C. Two strains, 476 and 438, which were temperature sensitive only in the presence of methionine, produced cellular protein with methionine contents as high as 3. 6 and 4. 3 %, respectively, when incubated in the presence of methionine. The former strain contained 2. 5 % methionine even when incubated at 37 °C in the absence of methionine. Wild strain Y 5 α, on the other hand, had 1. 75 % methionine under all conditions tested. Most <b>temperature-sensitive</b> <b>mutants</b> isolated had the same methionine content as the wild strain.
