"Few {{observers}} have shown more sympathy…with {{the religious and}} social practices of the Hindus than Geddes did; yet {{no one could have}} written more scathingly of Mahatma Gandhi’s attempt to conserve the past by reverting <b>to</b> the <b>spinning</b> <b>wheel,</b> at a moment when the fundamental poverty of the masses in India called for the most resourceful application of the machine both to agricultural and industrial life." ...|$|R

50|$|The {{manually}} locking rear differential {{from the}} earlier generations was replaced with a conventional open differential, with Electronic Differential Lock (EDL) (which detects wheelspin via ABS road wheel speed sensors, and applies brakes <b>to</b> one <b>spinning</b> <b>wheel,</b> thus transferring torque via open differential to the opposite wheel which has more traction). EDL works at speeds up to 80 km/h on all quattro models (on non-quattro models: up to 40 km/h.|$|R
50|$|Finally, in Win & Spin, {{the player}} with {{the least amount of}} money at the end gets their total doubled if the person who {{actually}} gets <b>to</b> <b>spin</b> the <b>wheel</b> lands on one of 25 slots on the wheel with the Doubler 'D' symbol.
