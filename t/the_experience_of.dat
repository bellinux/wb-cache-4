5|$|Faulks {{developed}} the novel {{to bring more}} public awareness to <b>the</b> <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> war remembered by WWI veterans. Most critics found this effort successful, commenting on how the novel, like many other WWI novels, thematically focuses {{on the way in}} which <b>the</b> <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> trauma shapes individual psyches. Similarly, because of the parallel narratives WWI and 1970s Britain, the novel explores metahistorical questions about how to document and recover narratives about the past. Because of its genre, themes and writing style, the novel has been favourably compared to a number of other war novels, like Ian McEwan's Atonement and those in Pat Barker's Regeneration Trilogy.|$|E

40|$|Although {{scholarly}} {{interest in}} doctoral education {{has increased dramatically}} {{over the last two}} decades, much of this attention has focused on <b>the</b> <b>experiences</b> <b>of</b> doctoral students who are en-rolled full-time in their programs. This study explored <b>the</b> <b>experiences</b> <b>of</b> 10 part-time doctoral students in different disciplines. Through semi-structured interviews with these students, we found that many of the issues surrounding these part-time doctoral students involved concerns related to balance, support, and fitting the mold of a “traditional ” doctoral student. Importantly, while some of these issues are consistent with <b>the</b> <b>experiences</b> <b>of</b> full-time doctoral students, <b>the</b> <b>experiences</b> <b>of</b> part-time doctoral students are more complicated and required sustained and flexi-ble efforts to adequately address. We conclude by suggesting both institutional and empirical ef-forts to better understand <b>the</b> complicated <b>experiences</b> <b>of</b> part-time doctoral students as well as to develop multi-faceted initiatives to support <b>the</b> <b>experiences</b> <b>of</b> this growing doctoral student popu-lation...|$|R
