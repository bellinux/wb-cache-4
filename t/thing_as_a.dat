5|$|A Scottish crest badge is a heraldic badge worn to show {{allegiance}} {{to an individual}} or membership in a specific Scottish clan. Crest badges are commonly called clan crests, {{but this is a}} misnomer; there is no such <b>thing</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> collective clan crest, just as there is no such <b>thing</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> clan coat of arms.|$|E
5|$|Newton's Third Law is {{a result}} of {{applying}} symmetry to situations where forces {{can be attributed to the}} presence of different objects. The third law means that all forces are interactions between different bodies, and thus that there is no such <b>thing</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> unidirectional force or a force that acts on only one body.|$|E
5|$|The {{concept of}} Lightning Returns battle system {{originated}} while ideas were being discussed for the battle system in Final Fantasy XIII, but technical limitations and problems implementing it in a party-based battle system prevented {{it from being}} used in that game. It reemerged {{when some of the}} development team wanted Lightning to change her appearance during battle, and reducing to one playable character opened up the memory space necessary for such a system to be implemented. In making the system revolve around one character, the developers ended up removing any opportunity for story scenes between party members, which was cited by Abe as its main weakness. The time limit sprang from the story concept of a world with a set time to live. When the feature was first announced, there were some who felt it was too new a <b>thing,</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> time limit was seen as a taboo in role-playing video games. The mechanic originally received negative feedback from test players who were unable to complete the game in time. In response to this, the team made adjustments so that players were given a more comfortable amount of time. Along with sharing design elements with the previous two XIII games, the system also bears similarities to the battle system of Final Fantasy XV, although the developers said that they were not directly inspired by it.|$|E

25|$|Thus an {{embedding}} is {{the same}} <b>thing</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> strong homomorphism which is one-to-one.|$|E
25|$|Another {{application}} is in database theory, where a relational {{model of a}} database {{is essentially the same}} <b>thing</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> relational structure. It turns out that a conjunctive query on a database can be described by another structure in the same signature as the database model. A homomorphism from the relational model to the structure representing the query is the same <b>thing</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> solution to the query. This shows that the conjunctive query problem is also equivalent to the homomorphism problem.|$|E

25|$|Plato also {{compares the}} three {{parts of the}} soul or psyche to a {{societal}} caste system. According to Plato's theory, the three-part soul {{is essentially the same}} <b>thing</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> state's class system because, to function well, each part must contribute so that the whole functions well. Logos keeps the other functions of the soul regulated.|$|E

25|$|A {{significant}} part of his book is {{about the nature of}} genius. Weininger argues {{that there is no such}} <b>thing</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> person who has a genius for, say, mathematics, or music, but there is only the universal genius, in whom everything exists and makes sense. He reasons that such genius is probably present in all people to some degree.|$|E
25|$|The popular {{mind was}} taken with Betty Friedan's The Feminine Mystique. This was {{accompanied}} by other feminist philosophers, such as Alicia Ostriker and Adrienne Rich. These philosophers critiqued basic assumptions and values like objectivity and what {{they believe to be}} masculine approaches to ethics, such as rights-based political theories. They maintained there is no such <b>thing</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> value-neutral inquiry and they sought to analyze the social dimensions of philosophical issues.|$|E
25|$|In other words, once we've {{explained}} {{a perception}} fully {{in terms of}} how it affects us, there is nothing left to explain. In particular, there is no such <b>thing</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> perception which may be considered in and of itself (a quale). Instead, the subject's honest reports of how things seem to them are inherently authoritative on how things seem to them, but not on the matter of how things actually are.|$|E

25|$|A small {{category}} with {{a single}} object is the same <b>thing</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> monoid: the morphisms of a one-object category {{can be thought of}} as elements of the monoid, and composition in the category is thought of as the monoid operation. Functors between one-object categories correspond to monoid homomorphisms. So in a sense, functors between arbitrary categories are a kind of generalization of monoid homomorphisms to categories with more than one object.|$|E
25|$|Newton's {{theories}} {{assumed that}} motion takes place {{against the backdrop}} of a rigid Euclidean reference frame that extends throughout all space and all time. Gravity is mediated by a mysterious force, acting instantaneously across a distance, whose actions are independent of the intervening space. In contrast, Einstein denied that there is any background Euclidean reference frame that extends throughout space. Nor is there any such <b>thing</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> force of gravitation, only the structure of spacetime itself.|$|E
25|$|By {{reporting}} {{ongoing and}} often unfinished scientific work that may otherwise {{have not been}} reported, the journal had a central function of being a scientific news service. At the time of Philosophical Transactions foundation, print was heavily regulated, {{and there was no}} such <b>thing</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> free press. In fact, the first English newspaper, The London Gazette (which was an official organ of Government and therefore seen as sanitised), did not appear until after Philosophical Transactions in the same year.|$|E

25|$|As seen above, in the {{standard}} encoding of graphs as structures the induced substructures are precisely the induced subgraphs. However, a homomorphism between graphs is the same <b>thing</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> homomorphism between the two structures coding the graph. In {{the example of the}} previous section, even though the subgraph H of G is not induced, the identity map id:H→G is a homomorphism. This map is in fact a monomorphism in the category σ-Hom, and therefore H is a subobject of G which is not an induced substructure.|$|E
25|$|London {{is not a}} battlefield. Those innocents {{who were}} murdered...were not victims of war. And the men who killed them were not, as in their vanity they claimed on their ludicrous videos, 'soldiers'. They were deluded, narcissistic inadequates. They were criminals. They were fantasists. We {{need to be very}} clear about this. On the streets of London there is no such <b>thing</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> war on terror. The fight against {{terrorism}} on the streets of Britain is not a war. It is the prevention of crime, the enforcement of our laws and the winning of justice for those damaged by their infringement.|$|E
25|$|The {{difference}} between {{left and right}} actions is in {{the order in which}} a product like gh acts on x. For a left action h acts first and is followed by g, while for a right action g acts first and is followed by h. Because of the formula , one can construct a left action from a right action by composing with the inverse operation of the group. Also, a right action of a group G on X is the same <b>thing</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> left action of its opposite group Gop on X. It is thus sufficient to only consider left actions without any loss of generality.|$|E
