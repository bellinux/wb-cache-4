In 1930 Zenith was in financial trouble due to the recession, and were taken over by one of their dealers, Writer's of South London. The ex-Zenith works rider Joe Wright, riding an OEC with a [...] JAP engine, took back the record on 31 August at 137.23 mph, again at Arpajon, France. But the record was broken twice more in 1930, first to Ernst Jakob Henne riding a supercharged BMW to 137.85 mph at Ingolstadt, Germany. Claude Temple made arrangements to try to win the title back in Cork, Ireland using his supercharged OEC again with Joe Wright on board. Joe Wright had managed to acquire the works [...] supercharged J.A.P-engined Zenith, and he took this to Ireland as a spare machine (visible on the Pathe news when the OEC is <b>tow</b> <b>started).</b> The OEC bike suffered a mechanical failure and was not able to complete the required two runs, so Wright used his Zenith to set a new world record of 150.65 mph. As Zenith were temporarily out of business, and OEC were paying the bills, the fact the Zenith had made the run and not the OEC was conveniently overlooked in much of the publicity of the time, and even in the FIM record books http://thevintagent.blogspot.co.uk/2010/10/oec-zenith-and-stolen-record.html..

Two Melrose deckhands were killed while attempting to rescue a man overboard on 9 July 1917 when the lifeboat they had launched to recover the passenger was drawn into the maneuvering ferry's paddle wheel. Melrose narrowly avoided collision with the freighter K.J.Luckenback in fog on 4 February 1922. Melrose ran aground while maneuvering to avoid collision, and required the assistance of tugs to be refloated. In July 1926, Melrose suffered a mid-bay mechanical breakdown requiring assistance of tugs. The rescue tug accidentally rammed Melrose while passing a <b>tow</b> line.

In October 1996, Royal Venture Cruises wished to charter her under the name Sun Venture for additional cruise service, while in 1997, Premier Cruises expressed interest in purchasing the ship, but withdrew their offer due to her poor condition.

On the evening of the 11th Tempest was signalled that the Italians were aware of a {{submarine}} in her vicinity and that it should be assumed that her patrol had been compromised. On the 13th, Tempest was sighted on the surface by the Spica-class torpedo boat Circe. Tempest crash dived and Circe began depth charging the area, eventually resulting in oil being seen on the surface. Tempest's battery tanks had burst filling the boat with chlorine gas and the vessel was forced to surface, whereupon she was hit by gunfire from the Circe. The crew abandoned the submarine, and 23 of the crew of 62 were picked up some 3 hours later by the warship. The Italians attempted to board the abandoned vessel but were unable to, due to rough seas. Instead, the torpedo boat opened fire, scoring more than a dozen direct hits, but failing to sink the Tempest. Finally the Italians attempted to take the submarine in tow. Two members of the warship’s crew boarded the submarine and prepared the tow.

In the 1913 storm, after fighting for several hours, it safely reached shelter at Whitefish Bay. On September 24, 1915, while on a trip from Toledo, Ohio to Little Current, Ontario, going full speed, "Western Star" went on a shoal to the north of Clapperton Island, Georgian Bay. It filled and settled below the water as far as the Number 4 hatch, and lay at an angle of 40 degrees, the bow holding fast on the rocks. It was abandoned to the underwriters by its owners, the Cadillac Steamship Co. and a contract entered for salvaging her with the Great Lakes <b>Towing</b> Co.

After reading about the events in the paper, Nick becomes convinced that Death is coming after them for evading their fates at the stadium. Hunt and Janet are dubious, but they manage to convince George about what is happening. The group arrives to warn Andy, but he is killed when a tank, propelled by a chain reaction from a faulty wench launches him through a chain link fence.

5000|$|The {{second time}} they {{attempted}} to raise the keel, the same tank was used and the tide was not used for leverage. Ed Huseman positioned the tank over the keel and flooded the tank with water to submerge the tank, and then attached the tank to the keel. The next process was to blow out {{the water in the}} tank with the attached keel, and then the two would float to the surface. Ed Huseman figured out that hooking ten air tanks together, containing [...] of air and attaching a garden hose from the air tanks to the tank's top valve, the air at the top would force the water out through the bottom of the tank. Ed Huseman's ingenious idea worked very well. The air blew the water out of a 30 ft x 8 ft tank in about 30 minutes. The keel and the tank floated up to about 4 ft off the reef, however there were rocks about 5 ft that blocked the exit movement of the keel. They tried to pull the tank and keel out one way, but the towboat, a Cal 39 sail boat with a Perkins 4108 50-hp diesel engine, skippered by Dan Cohen, was too far away to tell Cohen that the keel was still stuck in the rocks, and the tow rope snapped into two pieces. [...] After being in the water for over nine hours that day, the four divers almost gave up. One of the divers, Steve Stiener, said they could move the keel, {{and they were able to}} push the tank with just flipper power. The divers all felt that the tank and keel were going to hit more rocks, however the keel and tank moved out of the rock and reef area, went through a bed of seaweed and into dark deep water, and floated to the water's surface. After the broken tow rope was repaired, Cohen <b>started</b> <b>towing</b> the tank and keel out of the rock and the reef area. The exhausted diving crew, after being in the water for two days, and the sailboats left Catalina Island elated, having achieved a successful salvage operation that no one else had been able to accomplish. The tank and 20-ton keel were then towed 24 miles by the Cal 39 Perkins 4108 50-hp diesel engine across the Catalina Channel to Long Beach Harbor.|$|R
