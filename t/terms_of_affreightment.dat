50|$|The freight market {{consists}} of shipowners, charterers and brokers.

Shipowners contract to carry cargo for an agreed price per tonne while the charter market hires out ships for a certain period. A charter is legally agreed upon in a charter-party in which the <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> the deal are clearly set out.|$|R
50|$|A ship may be let, like a house, to {{a person}} who takes {{possession}} and control of it for a specified term. The person who hires a ship in this way occupies during the specified time the position of ship-owner. The contract under which a ship is so let may be called a charter-party—but it is not, properly speaking, a contract <b>of</b> <b>affreightment,</b> and is mentioned here only to clarify the distinction between a charter-party of this kind, which is sometimes called a demise of the ship, and a charter-party that is a contract <b>of</b> <b>affreightment.</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{general area}} of this {{research}} is shipping law, more specifically the law governing the carriage of goods by sea. The research has been narrowed down to the implications <b>of</b> <b>terms</b> into contracts <b>of</b> <b>affreightment,</b> and then further narrowed down to the concept of deviation. The specific research {{question is whether or not}} the concept of deviation is still relevant to the law governing the carriage of goods by sea in the modern era. While this question has been posed before in the academic literature, it has never been discussed in sufficient depth. The researcher was therefore able to identify gaps in the literature through the literature review which the research has attempted to fill. The thesis on which the research is based is that the principle of deviation is a long standing and very important rule of law which form an integral part of the law and practice governing the carriage of goods by sea. However, a multi-jurisdictional review of both primary sources (i. e. conventions, statutes and cases) and secondary sources (academic literature) in relation to deviation indicates that there are many conceptual, legal and practical problems associated with the principle. Adding to this problem is the concept of quasi deviation in some jurisdictions such as the United States where there continues to be conflicting approaches to the concept even within the various federal circuits. Therefore the hypothesis of this study is based on the need for legal reform. Chapters 1 and 2 provide the background to the study as well as the conceptual framework for the research, including the literature review. The main research aims, objectives and research questions are addressed in Chapters 3, 4 and 5.

500|$|The act {{of hiring}} a ship to carry cargo is called chartering. [...] Tankers are hired by {{four types of}} charter agreements: the voyage charter, the time charter, the bareboat charter, and {{contract}} <b>of</b> <b>affreightment.</b> In a voyage charter the charterer rents the vessel from the loading port to the discharge port. In a time charter the vessel is hired for a set period of time, to perform voyages as the charterer directs. In a bareboat charter the charterer acts as the ship's operator and manager, taking on responsibilities such as providing the crew and maintaining the vessel. Finally, in a contract <b>of</b> <b>affreightment</b> or COA, the charterer specifies a total volume of cargo to be carried in a specific time period and in specific sizes, for example a COA could be specified as [...] of JP-5 in a year's time in [...] shipments.

5000|$|At common law, when {{goods are}} {{carried by sea}} by a “common carrier” (a public carrier), then, if the {{contract}} of carriage does not contain an exception clause relating to seaworthiness, there is an absolute undertaking that the vessel is seaworthy. Liability is “strict”**, meaning the carrier is liable {{even in the absence}} of negligence, as in Liver Alkali v Johnson. This does not mean the vessel need be capable of encountering any peril. The test of seaworthiness may be [...] "that the ship should be in a condition to encounter whatever perils of the sea a ship of that kind, and laden in that way, may be fairly expected to encounter in the voyage to be performed". However, the strict liability at common law is invariably modified in contracts <b>of</b> <b>affreightment.</b> In charter parties the shipowner may negotiate an express clause excluding his liability for unseaworthiness or he may, as it more usual, agree to incorporate the provisions of the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1971 into the charter.|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to critically assess the current status of the legal regime governing the international carriage of goods by sea, with the main focus being on the implied terms which form the foundation of international shipping law in general, and on the doctrine of deviation in particular. This will include a critical review of the rule against unjustified deviation in contracts <b>of</b> <b>affreightment</b> by posing the following questions: (i) Is the rule against unjustified deviation still relevant in the modern context of international carriage of goods by sea? In light of: The development of transport vessels, liberty clauses, different types of charterparties, and held cover clauses? (ii) Should the rule against unjustified deviation be treated any differently from other implied shipping terms? Is the rule against deviation an absolute obligation? Should unjustified deviation amount to fundamental breach of a contract? Should there not be some degree of flexibility in the judicial approach to the law on deviation? (iii) Do we need harmonisation, unification and interpretation of deviation rules? It is hoped that in attempting to answer these questions some light may be shed on this important area of shipping law...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIf {{there were}} no express {{provisions}} in the charter party as to seaworthiness or a ship owner's obligation to exercise reasonable dispatch, there is an implied obligation in common law. At other times, in the absence <b>of</b> an express <b>term,</b> the right to nominate a port does not {{give rise to a}} correlative warranty on the nomination to a safe port. Likewise, a change of circumstances occurring after the conclusion of the contract may be sufficient to discharge the parties from further performance of their contract. In common law, the shipper has an implied obligation to inform the ship owner on the dangerous nature of the shipped goods. Last but not least, whether the owner of the vessel operates a liner service or a under a charter undertakes that his vessel, while performing its obligations under the contract of carriage, will not deviate from the contract of carriage. Based on theoretical and jurisprudential aspects, this article aims to analyze the consequences of the ship owner's breach of the contract, the implications of express liberty clauses, and where appropriate, the Hague-Visby Rules incorporation effect. In conclusion, the obligations have different meanings {{depending on the type of}} the contract <b>of</b> <b>affreightment</b> and the circumstances in which the obligation must be fulfilled or the moment while operating...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} an effort to {{understand}} how the tramp shipping industry works, which is considered to work close to perfect competition model, where the atomicity, homogeneity and information transparency are evident. Many small shipping companies compete for a volatile and unpredictable demand. Despite there are some entry barriers to the market, these can be easily mitigated by the way this market works. Tramp shipping companies co-operate among them in pools, in order to bid for large contracts <b>of</b> <b>affreightment,</b> which otherwise, shipowners could not perform on their own. Tramp shipping pools raise competition concerns, and under the EU Competition Rules, these agreements shall be assessed on case-by-case basis in order to determine whether an agreement may jeopardise competition within common market. To do so, an assessment under Article 101 TFEU is required. Normally, tramp shipping pools created for the right purposes, do not entail competition restrictions. Conversely, those agreements that have a combined market share considerably high or involve hardcore restrictions, are prohibited under Article 101 (1). These agreements have three options: terminate their agreement; demonstrate that economic efficiencies brought by the agreement outweigh restrictions under Article 101 (3); and lastly and most appealing, try to restructure the agreement creating a full-function joint venture in order to fall under a more certain legal framework, the EC Merger Rules...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the application of}} the doctrine of frustration under the English private law of contracts to situations of capture of merchant ships for ransom by pirates operating according to the model which has developed in recent years off the coast of Somalia. The examination is centred on the question whether and how contracts <b>of</b> <b>affreightment</b> (or carriage <b>of</b> goods by sea) (including time and voyage charters as well as bills of lading) which may have been concluded by a captured ship would be terminated in the event of capture pursuant to the doctrine. The thesis analyses the wording of standard carriage contract forms and clauses, as well as the provisions of relevant international conventions and statutes, which could deal with the standing of contracts following a capture. The outcome of the research is that standard contract and clauses often leave the question of the fate of the contract in the event of capture untouched with the result that the doctrine of frustration may apply by default. The contract will only be terminated, however, if an elaborately long detention of the vessel is anticipated, or the prospects of recovery, either against payment of a ransom or through forceful repossession, are very weak. The thesis equally considers {{the application of the}} concept of self-induced frustration by taking several examples of actions or default by one of the parties to the contract of carriage which may have led to or exacerbated the capture scenario. The main findings are that it will usually be difficult to establish self-induced frustration in the event of capture. An analysis is also made of the application of the concepts of actual and constructive total loss under English marine insurance law to a ship that has been captured by pirates according to the same model of operation. The consequences of termination of the contract are not discussed in this thesis. <br/...|$|R
