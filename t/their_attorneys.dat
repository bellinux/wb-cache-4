It was later revealed that the conversation they had between them as well with <b>their</b> <b>attorneys</b> were recorded. Finally it was reported by both the defendants' attorneys {{and some of the}} prison's doctors, that the physical and psychological state of the prisoners held in solitary confinement and white cells was such that they couldn't attend the long trial days and defend themselves appropriately. By the time the Stammheim trial began in early 1975, some of the prisoners had already been in solitary confinement for three years.|$|E

In December, Ultimate Fighting Championship's parent company Zuffa filed a lawsuit against Ubisoft based on the usage of the phrase [...] "ULTIMATE FIGHTING", a term which Zuffa had trademarked, on the back of the game's box. Zuffa claimed that the [...] "use of the ULTIMATE FIGHTING name and mark is identical or confusingly similar to the use of the UFC marks, including the ULTIMATE FIGHTING name". Zuffa wanted Ubisoft to be prevented from using the term in the future as well as having all uses of it destroyed, and sought all of Ubisoft's profits off the game, along with triple the normal fees for trademark violation. Zuffa also wanted Ubisoft to pay for <b>their</b> <b>attorneys,</b> exemplary damages and compensatory damages. Ubisoft did not publicly comment on the issue.|$|E

50|$|When an {{adjuster}} needs a New York State IME {{as quickly}} as possible due to a hearing or another urgent matter, a waiver can be signed by the claimant or <b>their</b> <b>attorney,</b> waiving <b>their</b> rights to 7 business days' notice of the appointment by mail (which is a law of the WCB). A common question from an IME Vendor, to a claimant or <b>their</b> <b>attorney,</b> may be to sign a waiver form. If the claimant signs this and goes to the appointment, this is okay. However, if an attorney's office refuses to sign it and won't let their client sign it, then the exam will have to be rescheduled to a later date to allow more notice time for the claimant. If a claimant attends the exam and <b>their</b> <b>attorney</b> says they'll sign the waiver, but never provides the signed waiver to the IME Vendor, the report that is dictated by the IME doctor will be precluded (meaning it is not valid because the waiver was never actually signed and returned).|$|R

2500|$|To appeal, Lawrence and Garner {{needed to}} have their cases tried in Harris County Criminal Court. <b>Their</b> <b>attorneys</b> {{asked the court to}} dismiss the charges against them on Fourteenth Amendment equal {{protection}} grounds, claiming that the law was unconstitutional since it prohibited sodomy between same-sex couples, but not between heterosexual couples. They also asserted a right to privacy and that the Supreme Court's decision in Bowers v. Hardwick that found no privacy protection for consensual sex between homosexuals was [...] "wrongly decided". On December 22, Judge Sherman Ross denied the defense motions to dismiss. The defendants again pleaded [...] "no contest". Ross fined them $200 each, the amount agreed upon in advance by both sides.|$|E
2500|$|... "The {{situation}} in which these Indians find themselves was developed by white men {{without regard to the}} interests of the Indians. Nor can we ignore the unhappy fact that for eighteen years or more, these wards of the United States, living in forty counties in Oklahoma, have been shamefully exploited by a group of guardians and <b>their</b> <b>attorneys,</b> whose unconscionable deeds are matters of public record state of affairs and of common knowledge. The land and money stolen from the Indians cannot be given back to them. But it is not too late for Federal and State authorities, legislative and executive, to adopt measures to prevent further civil exploitation of these Indians, and to safeguard their interests and promote their welfare. It is common knowledge that grafting on rich Indians has become an almost recognized profession in Eastern Oklahoma, and a considerable class of unscrupulous individuals find their chief means of livelihood and source of wealth in this grafting. So common is it that the term grafter carried little or no opprobrium in Oklahoma." ...|$|E
