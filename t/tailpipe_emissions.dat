5|$|The Brazilian {{subsidiaries}} of Magneti Marelli, Delphi and Bosch {{have developed}} and announced the introduction in 2009 {{of a new}} flex engine generation that {{eliminates the need for}} the secondary gasoline tank by warming the ethanol fuel during starting, and allowing flex vehicles to do a normal cold start at temperatures as low as, the lowest temperature expected anywhere in the Brazilian territory. Another improvement is the reduction of fuel consumption and <b>tailpipe</b> <b>emissions,</b> between 10% to 15% as compared to flex motors sold in 2008. In March 2009 Volkswagen do Brasil launched the Polo E-Flex, the first flex fuel model without an auxiliary tank for cold start. The Flex Start system used by the Polo was developed by Bosch.|$|E
5|$|While {{operating}} in all-electric mode the Volt produces no <b>tailpipe</b> <b>emissions.</b> In this mode {{there is an}} absence of harmful chemical emissions that can negatively impact air quality, allowing for a continuous clean air benefit. There is also a lack of carbon dioxide emissions. However, this benefit is mostly local because, depending on {{the source of the}} electricity used to recharge the batteries, these emissions are shifted to the location of the electricity generation plants. The amount of carbon dioxide emitted depends on the emission intensity of the power source used to charge the vehicle. When the Volt's battery is depleted and the gasoline-powered engine engages, the plug-in emissions are similar to other internal combustion engine vehicles. The amount of total local emissions depends on how much the Volt is driven in all-electric mode and how much in charge-sustaining mode.|$|E

40|$|Faced {{with the}} worst air quality in the United States, California began in the 1960 s to pursue a “technology-forcing ” {{approach}} in establishing motor vehicle <b>tailpipe</b> <b>emission</b> standards. This approach sought to advance vehicle pollution control technology by establishing future <b>tailpipe</b> <b>emission</b> limits even if no technologies existed to meet {{them at the time}} regulators set the standards. The U. S. government later incorporated technology-forcing into the 1970 U. S.

25|$|According to an {{industry}} advocacy group, ethanol as a fuel reduces harmful <b>tailpipe</b> <b>emissions</b> of carbon monoxide, particulate matter, oxides of nitrogen, and other ozone-forming pollutants. Argonne National Laboratory analyzed {{greenhouse gas emissions}} of many different engine and fuel combinations, and found that biodiesel/petrodiesel blend (B20) showed a reduction of 8%, conventional E85 ethanol blend a reduction of 17% and cellulosic ethanol 64%, compared with pure gasoline.|$|E

Oxygenates also help gasoline burn more completely, reducing <b>tailpipe</b> <b>emissions</b> from pre-1984 motor vehicles; dilute or displace gasoline components such as aromatics (e.g., benzene) and sulfur; and optimize oxidation during combustion. Before the introduction of other oxygenates and octane enhancers, most refiners had chosen MTBE primarily for its blending characteristics and low cost.|$|E

25|$|The {{regulation}} of horsepower {{has been suggested}} {{to be due to}} the fitment of turbochargers and superchargers to these tiny engines during the late 1980s to cope with the lack of horsepower and torque. However, the installation of turbochargers and superchargers also had a benefit in that fuel efficiency increased, thereby reducing <b>tailpipe</b> <b>emissions,</b> which are also taxed, while the installation of turbos and superchargers made the vehicles very fast and nimble relative to their size. Engine technology is also shared with sport bikes, which are designed for rider enjoyment, and less so on fuel economy.|$|E
40|$|AbstractTo measure driving-distance-based mass {{emission}} factors for airborne brake wear particulate matter (PM; i. e., brake wear particles) {{related to the}} non-asbestos organic friction of brake assembly materials (pads and lining), and to characterize the components of brake wear particles, a brake wear dynamometer with a constant-volume sampling system was developed. Only {{a limited number of}} studies have investigated brake emissions under urban city driving cycles that correspond to the <b>tailpipe</b> <b>emission</b> test (i. e., JC 08 or JE 05 mode of Japanese <b>tailpipe</b> <b>emission</b> test cycles). The tests were performed using two passenger cars and one middle-class truck. The observed airborne brake wear particle emissions ranged from 0. 04 to 1. 4 mg/km/vehicle for PM 10 (particles up to 10  μm (in size), and from 0. 04 to 1. 2  mg/km/vehicle for PM 2. 5. The proportion of brake wear debris emitted as airborne brake wear particles was 2 – 21 % of the mass of wear. Oxygenated carbonaceous components were included in the airborne PM but not in the original friction material, which indicates that changes in carbon composition occurred during the abrasion process. Furthermore, this study identified the key tracers of brake wear particles (e. g., Fe, Cu, Ba, and Sb) at emission levels comparable to traffic-related atmospheric environments...|$|R

25|$|The final Environmental Improvement Score is {{determined}} through the average (and rounded {{to the nearest}} tenth) of the values for global warming emissions reductions and <b>tailpipe</b> <b>emissions.</b> As an example, the 2011 Lincoln MKZ Hybrid achieved a 46% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared with its sibling gasoline-only model. Because {{this is the largest}} percent reduction achieved among all hybrids the MKZ Hybrid earns a global warming emissions score of 10. As a California certified Partial Zero Emission Vehicle, the MKZ Hybrid earns an EPA air pollution score of 9.0. When both scores are combined, the MKZ Hybrid earns an overall Environmental Improvement Score of 9.5.|$|E
25|$|The use {{of ethanol}} blends in {{conventional}} gasoline vehicles {{is restricted to}} low mixtures, as ethanol is corrosive and can degrade some of the materials in the engine and fuel system. Also, the engine has to be adjusted for a higher compression ratio as compared to a pure gasoline engine {{to take advantage of}} ethanol's higher oxygen content, thus allowing an improvement in fuel efficiency and a reduction of <b>tailpipe</b> <b>emissions.</b> The following table shows the required modifications to gasoline engines to run smoothly and without degrading any materials. This information is based on the modifications made by the Brazilian automotive industry {{at the beginning of the}} ethanol program in that country in the late 1970s, and reflects the experience of Volkswagen do Brasil.|$|E

30|$|While Japanese {{automakers}} offered series produced hybrid {{models as}} of 1997, the first European-produced hybrid was a double-priced Mercedes in 2009 {{as compared to}} Toyota Prius. European carmakers however admitted slowly but surely that diesel technology {{was not to be}} a long-term solution. While diesel technology was expected to lower CO 2 -emission levels, it could not meet future nitrogen oxide emission rules. Volkswagen Group CEO Bernd Pischetsrieder put it this way: ‘Diesel cars will not be abolished. They will however only survive in large cars.’ The high cost of <b>tailpipe</b> <b>emission</b> treatment could only be internalized in more expensive segments of the car market[106].|$|R

500|$|For {{purposes}} of an accurate estimation of emissions, the analysis {{took into consideration}} the differences in operation between plug-in hybrids. Some, like the Chevrolet Volt, can operate in all-electric mode without using gasoline, and others operate in a blended mode like the Toyota Prius PHV, which uses both energy stored in the battery and energy from the gasoline tank to propel the vehicle, but that can deliver substantial all-electric driving in blended mode. In addition, since the all-electric range of plug-in hybrids depends {{on the size of}} the battery pack, the analysis introduced a utility factor as a projection of the share of miles that will be driven using electricity by an average driver, for both, electric only and blended EV modes. Since all-electric cars do not produce <b>tailpipe</b> <b>emissions,</b> the utility factor applies only to plug-in hybrids. The following table shows the overall fuel economy expressed in terms of miles per gallon gasoline equivalent (mpg-e) and the utility factor for the ten MY2014 plug-in hybrids available in the U.S. market, and EPA's best estimate of the [...] <b>tailpipe</b> <b>emissions</b> produced by these PHEVs.|$|E
