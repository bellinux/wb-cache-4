40|$|Abstract. In this paper, the {{relationship}} between the assumptions in the supply-driven and the demand-driven input-output model is discussed. A necessary and sufficient condition is given for the stability of the input coefficients, the output coefficients, and both coefficients. For both models, the effects of a demand pull on the <b>total</b> <b>outputs</b> and on the primary inputs are analytically expressed. Also, the effects of a supply push on the <b>total</b> <b>outputs</b> and on the final outputs are expressed, again for both models. In general, the assumption of fixed input coefficients in the demand-driven model does not hold, but computations are still based on it. A necessary and sufficient condition is given for the correctness of the computed <b>total</b> <b>outputs,</b> both for a demand pull and a supply push. Similar results are obtained for the supply-driven input-output model. ...|$|R

5|$|Clarke {{composed}} no {{large scale}} {{works such as}} symphonies.

Over half of Clarke's compositions remain unpublished and in the personal possession of her heirs, along with most of her writings. However, in the early 2000s more of her works were printed and recorded. Examples of recent publications include two string quartets and Morpheus, published in 2002.|$|E

5|$|The former Eastern Region {{was once}} famed for {{producing}} half the world's <b>total</b> <b>output</b> of palm kernels.

The production of other important cash crops such as cocoa, groundnut and groundnut oil, rubber, cassava, cotton and cotton seed and timber tumbled {{after the civil war}} and the subsequent oil boom years. Consequently, the area called Enugu State as well as the rest of Nigeria, which was once a self-sufficient net exporter in agricultural produce, must import food.|$|E

50|$|It is not {{difficult}} to prove a close positive correlation between the value of net output and the labour hours worked to produce it, since the payments which constitute that value, are themselves earnings which are necessarily proportional to time worked and paid for. Even if it is assumed, that gross profits are not proportional to time worked, by some margin, the total labour-cost involved in the <b>total</b> net <b>output</b> is nevertheless typically {{more than half of the}} value of the <b>total</b> net <b>output</b> or gross value added (in the US, labour compensation is nowadays around 55% of the value of <b>total</b> net <b>output).</b>|$|R
5|$|Trough systems {{convert the}} heat from the sun into electricity. Because of their {{parabolic}} shape, trough collectors can focus the sun at 30-60 times its normal intensity on a receiver pipe located along the focal line of the trough. Synthetic oil circulates through the pipe and captures this heat, reaching temperatures of 390°C (735°F). The hot oil is pumped to a generating station and routed through a heat exchanger to produce steam. Finally, electricity is produced in a conventional steam turbine. The SEGS plants operate on natural gas on cloudy days or after dark, and natural gas provides 25% of the <b>total</b> <b>output.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1843, the Padarn Railway {{became the}} first quarry railway to use steam locomotives, and the {{transport}} of slate by train rather than by ship was made easier when the London and North Western Railway built branches to connect Port Penrhyn and Port Dinorwic to the main line in 1852. The Corris Railway opened as the horse-worked Corris, Machynlleth & River Dovey Tramroad in 1859, connecting the slate quarries around Corris and Aberllefenni with wharves on the estuary of the River Dyfi. The Ffestiniog Railway converted to steam in 1863, and the Talyllyn Railway was opened in 1866 to serve the Bryn Eglwys quarry above the village of Abergynolwyn. Bryn Eglwys grew {{to be one of}} the largest quarries in mid Wales, employing 300 men and producing 30% of the <b>total</b> <b>output</b> of the Corris district. The Cardigan Railway was opened in 1873, partly to carry slate traffic, and enabled the Glogue quarry in Pembrokeshire to grow to employ 80 men.|$|E
5|$|In 1950 Charles Churchill & Co, {{the parent}} company, moved its offices from London to Birmingham and in 1955 {{increased}} its share capital to £1.26M.

Exports were up 26% {{and there were}} hopes of the sector eventually amounting to 40% of <b>total</b> <b>output.</b> Fixed assets had increased significantly: the business had taken over Newcast Foundries Ltd, Halifax-based heavy lathe manufacturer Denhams Engineering Co Ltd and Churchill-Milnes; it had spent £2M of its own resources building extensions and plant improvements to more than double its manufacturing capability compared to that in 1951.

5|$|Initially, diesel {{propulsion}} {{was planned}} for these ships, {{as had been}} used for the three Panzerschiffe. However, {{it was decided to}} use superheated steam propulsion. The main reason was that the required <b>total</b> <b>output</b> for the desired speed was three times that of the Panzerschiffe. In the case of triple-screw ships, this would have meant more than twice the shaft horsepower per shaft of the Panzerschiffe, {{and in the case of}} a quadruple-screw ship, this would have amounted to more than 40,000 horsepower per shaft. This requirement was beyond the diesel technology then available, and devising engines that could meet this demand would take an unforeseeable amount of time. Since high-pressure superheated steam had already proved successful, it was considered the most suitable choice for high power machinery.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the output in-vitro of budesonide from two different nebulizers under simulated breathing conditions. The BimboNeb and Nebula nebulizers were used to nebulize 2 mL of budesonide (500 microg) suspension. Particle size was determined by inertial impaction after a 5 -min nebulization. <b>Total</b> <b>outputs</b> of the drug from both nebulizers were measured using a sinus flow pump to create simulated breathing conditions. Paediatric and adult breathing patterns were used, with drug output measured after 5 and 10 min nebulization. The mass median aerodynamic diameter of budesonide using the BimboNeb (4. 5 microm) was significantly greater than that from the Nebula (3. 4 microm) (P< 0. 01). With the simulated adult breathing pattern, the <b>total</b> drug <b>output</b> after 5 min with the BimboNeb (61. 5 microg) was twice that from the Nebula (30. 7 microg). For the paediatric breathing pattern, <b>total</b> <b>outputs</b> were very similar for both nebulizers. In all cases, nebulizing for 10 min produced greater drug outputs compared with those after 5 min, particularly for the paediatric breathing pattern. The amount of aerosolized drug available for inhalation needs to be assessed for each nebuliser used and the effect of the patient's breathing pattern should also be taken into account. 1558...|$|R
