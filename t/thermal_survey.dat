40|$|High power-density Diesel {{engines are}} {{characterized}} by remarkable thermo-mechanical loads. Therefore, compared to spark ignition engines, designers are forced to increase component strength {{in order to avoid}} failures. 3 D-CFD simulations represent a powerful tool for the evaluation of the engine thermal field and may be used by designers, along with FE analyses, to ensure thermo-mechanical reliability. The present work aims at providing an integrated in-cylinder/CHT methodology for the estimation of a Diesel engine thermal field. On one hand, in-cylinder simulations are fundamental to evaluate not only the integral amount of heat transfer to the combustion chamber walls, but also its point-wise distribution. To this specific aim, an improved heat transfer model based on a modified thermal wall function is adopted to estimate correctly wall heat fluxes due to combustion. On the other hand, a detailed Conjugate Heat Transfer model including both the solid components and the coolant circuit of the engine is needed, accounting for all the thermo-mechanical effects acting simultaneously during actual operations. Such comprehensive CHT methodology is here presented, with particular emphasis on a dedicated framework for the thermal simulation of the piston, to account for the mutual influence of many interplaying phenomena such as oil jet impingement, frictional losses and conduction with the surrounding components. The predictive capabilities of the methodology are demonstrated both in terms of global thermal balance and local engine temperature distribution. In fact, numerical coolant heat rejection and thermal field are compared with experimental data provided by <b>thermal</b> <b>survey</b> and point-wise temperature measurements for two different mid-to-low revving speed operating conditions...|$|E

40|$|New SI engine generations are {{characterized}} by a simultaneous reduction of the engine displacement and an increase of the brake power; such targets are achieved through the adoption of several techniques such as turbocharging, direct fuel injection, variable valve timing and variable port lengths. This design approach, called "downsizing", leads to a marked increase in the thermal loads acting on the engine components, in particular on those facing the combustion chamber. Hence, an accurate evaluation of the thermal field is of primary importance {{in order to avoid}} mechanical failures. Moreover, the correct evaluation of the temperature distribution improves the prediction of pointwise abnormal combustion onset. The paper proposes an evolution of the CFD methodology previously developed by the authors for the prediction of the engine thermal field, which is applied to two different high performance turbocharged DISI engines: the methodology employs both in-cylinder 3 D-CFD combustion simulations and CHT (Conjugate Heat Transfer) simulations of the whole engine, inclusive of both the solid components and the coolant circuit. In-cylinder analyses are used as thermal boundary conditions for the CHT simulations, which are in turn a fundamental benchmark to evaluate the accuracy of the combustion heat flux estimation by means of a combination of global engine <b>thermal</b> <b>survey</b> and local temperature measurements. A preliminary evaluation of some consolidated heat transfer models is carried out to evaluate the accuracy of the predicted gas-to-wall heat fluxes. Then, a modified heat transfer model is proposed, critically motivated and applied to the specific engine conditions under investigations.

40|$|Aerial {{thermography}} {{is one of}} {{the least}} utilized archaeological prospection methods, yet it has great potential for detecting anthropogenic anomalies. Thermal infrared radiation is absorbed and reemitted at varying rates by all objects on and within the ground depending upon their density, composition, and moisture content. If an area containing archaeological features is recorded at the moment when their thermal signatures most strongly contrast with that of the surrounding matrix, they can be visually identified in thermal images. Research conducted in the 1960 s and 1970 s established a few basic rules for conducting <b>thermal</b> <b>survey,</b> but the expense associated with the method deterred most archaeologists from using this technology. Subsequent research was infrequent and almost exclusively appeared in the form of case studies. However, as the current proliferation of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and compact thermal cameras draws renewed attention to aerial thermography as an attractive and exciting form of survey, it is appropriate and necessary to reevaluate our approach. In this thesis I have taken a two-pronged approach. First, I built upon the groundwork of earlier researchers and created an experiment to explore the impact that different environmental and climatic conditions have on {{the success or failure of}} thermal imaging. I constructed a test site designed to mimic a range of archaeological features and imaged it under a variety of conditions to compare and contrast the results. Second, I explored a new method for processing thermal data that I hope will lead to a means of reducing noise and increasing the clarity of thermal images. This step was done as part of a case study so that the effectiveness of the processing method could be evaluated by comparison with the results of other geophysical surveys...|$|E
40|$|As {{a part of}} {{the joint}} {{geophysical}} and geochemical observations of Usu volcano in 2006, the airborne infrared <b>thermal</b> <b>survey</b> was conducted at Usu volcano, Noboribetsu geothermal area and Tarumai volcano. The observation was operated by the helicopter which has a hole on the floor for aerial photo of vertical direction. The portable infrared thermal camera (AVIO TVS- 620) was fixed on the hole to face the ground perpendicularly using the stand designed for this survey. The position and horizontal direction of the camera were measured by GPS. The vertical angle of the camera was determined by two crossing electronic clinometers placed on the stand. The thermal images (one second interval) ware transferred directly from the camera to computer through the USB cable. The number of the pixel of each frame is 320 for horizontal direction and 236 for vertical direction. The instant view of one pixel is 1. 4 mrad. The altitude of the flight was 2300 m so that the temperature at a pixel represents the mean temperature of about 3 m 2 and the each frame corresponds to the area of 1030 m × 730 m. The detective wavelength of the camera is 8 - 14 ìm and the signal attenuation by the atmosphere was ignored in the analysis of the surface temperature. The helicopter kept the constant height during the measurement. The thermally active area was covered by 6, 2 and 3 measurement lines in Usu, Noboribetsu and Tarumai, respectively. The selected thermal images with suitable condition were combined (about 90 frames in Usu volcano) considering the horizontal orientation, vertical angle and the position. The resultant image represents the overall surface temperature distribution at respective field. The surface temperature distribution of Usu volcano shows that the thermally active area is mainly composed from four parts: Nishi-yama crater, Kompira-yama crater, summit area and Showa-shinzan. Nishiyama and Kompira-yama craters were newly formed craters at 2000 eruption activity. The surface temperature distribution of Noboribetsu shows the fumarole activity at Ohyu-numa and Jigoku-dani thermal area and that of Tarumai shows the fumarole activity at A and B craters, respectively.

40|$|Last {{generation}} {{spark ignition}} (SI) engines {{are characterized by}} a simultaneous reduction of the engine displacement and an increase of the brake power; such conflicting targets are achieved through the adoption of several techniques such as turbocharging, direct fuel injection, variable valve timing and variable port lengths. This design approach, referred to as “engine downsizing”, leads to a remarkable increase in the thermal loads acting on the engine components facing the combustion chamber. Hence, an accurate evaluation of the thermal field is of primary importance {{in order to avoid}} thermo-mechanical failures. Moreover, the correct evaluation of the temperature distribution improves the prediction of point-wise abnormal combustion onset. Due to the complexity of the experimental measurement of instantaneous gas-to-wall heat fluxes, 3 D-CFD simulations of the in-cylinder processes are a fundamental tool to evaluate not only the global amount of heat transferred to the combustion chamber walls, but also its point-wise distribution. Several heat transfer models and thermal laws of the wall are available in literature, most of which were developed in the past decades and calibrated against experiments carried out in research laboratories at relatively low-load/low-speed engine operations. In the present paper two widely adopted heat transfer models are proved to be effective at such conditions to predict gas-to-wall heat flux, as demonstrated by their application to the well-known GM pancake engine test case. However, despite such comforting results, they manifest evident shortages when used for highly-charged/highly-downsized current production SI engines, since operated at specific thermal loads and engine speeds very different from the above experiments. In particular, overestimations of the wall heat transfer predicted by such thermal laws of the wall are pointed out thanks to experimental engine thermal surveys and temperature measurements on four current production engines. Therefore an alternative heat transfer model is proposed by the authors and tested on such currently made turbocharged SI engines, operated at different conditions. Compared to the existing models differences are pointed out, especially in terms of law of the wall expression. Experimental engine <b>thermal</b> <b>survey</b> and point-wise temperature measurements are used to validate the numerical heat flux. In particular the increased predictive capabilities of the 3 D-CFD gas-to-wall heat transfer simulations are revealed both in terms of global thermal balance and temperature distribution of the metal for all the investigated engines. In fact model adoption in a combined in-cylinder/CHT (Conjugate Heat Transfer) simulation loop leads to a correct characterization of the thermal status of all the analyzed engines. Finally, alternative model adoption for the investigated current production high specific power DISI turbocharged engines operated at full load and high revving speed is critically motivated adopting the “isothermicity parameter” ζ which represents an indication of the thermal state of the boundary layer, being a characteristic scale of the ratio between gas and wall temperatures...|$|E
40|$|A {{rigorous}} {{methodology for}} mapping thermal and RGB images on three-dimensional (3 -D) models of building façades is presented. The developed method differs from most existing approaches because {{it relies on}} the use of thermal images coupled with 3 -D models derived from terrestrial laser scanning surveying. The primary issue for an accurate texturing is the coregistration of the geometric model of the façade and the thermal images in the same reference system. This task is done by using a procedure standing out from other approaches adopted in current practice, which are mainly based on the independent registration of each image on the basis of homography or space resection techniques. A rigorous photogrammetric orientation of both thermal and RGB images is computed together in a combined bundle adjustment. This solution allows one to have a better control {{of the quality of the}} results, especially to reduce errors and artifacts in areas where more images are mosaicked onto the 3 -D model. Several products can be obtained: 3 -D triangulated textured models or raster products like orthophotos, having the temperature as radiometric value.

40|$|Rising {{demand for}} {{electricity}} {{is a major}} contributory factor to the energy crisis that Sri Lanka is now facing. One potential candidate for energy conservation is the domestic sector. By way of adopting an environment-friendly solution (i. e. a passive solution), there remains a potential to achieve indoor thermal comfort in houses, thus reducing, or sometimes even totally eliminating, the need for active means such as fans. The main objective {{of this study is}} to conserve electricity in the domestic sector of Sri Lanka, by developing a set of guidelines for the achievement of indoor thermal comfort at houses in the low altitudes of Sri Lanka through passive means, which are energy-efficient and environment- friendly. In order to achieve the above objective, the following methodology was adopted in the study. A comprehensive literature survey was conducted to determine the passive concepts and techniques desirable to warm humid climatic conditions prevailing in the low altitudes of Sri Lanka. Then, in order to identify the undesirable features of the building envelope with respect to thermal comfort and the indoor temperatures that occur in reality, a series of <b>thermal</b> and comfort <b>surveys</b> was conducted at several existing buildings, mostly houses. In order to identify the current situation with respect to thermal comfort and their preferences which would be crucial in developing a solution, a pilot questionnaire survey was conducted among a group of adults. A series of computer simulations was carried out using the software DEROB-LTH on a simple model to determine the effect of various features of the buildings envelope on indoor thermal comfort since such simulation software is quite good in predicting the trends.

For all years, evaporation rates were low in spring and fall and highest during the summer. However, the times of highest evaporation rates varied during the 6 yr. Evaporation reached maximum rates in July for three of the years, in June for two of the years, and in August for one of the years. The highest evaporation rate during the 6 -yr study was 0. 46 cm d� 1 during 27 May– 4 June 1986 and 15 – 21 July 1987. Solar radiation and atmospheric radiation input to the lake and long-wave radiation emitted from the lake were by far the largest energy fluxes to and from the lake and had the greatest effect on evaporation rates. Energy advected to and from the lake by precipitation, surface water, and ground water had little effect on evaporation rates.

Remotely sensed <b>thermal</b> infrared <b>surveys</b> provide the potential for a rapid, inexpensive and non-intrusive technique for mineshaft detection. The key parameters of thermal infra-red radiation and the application of remote <b>thermal</b> infra-red <b>surveys</b> to planning are described, using case histories from former mining areas in Lancashire, Yorkshire and Nottinghamshire. Field-measured infrared temperature differences correlated well with different ground conditions caused by changes in vegetation, disturbance, compaction and moisture-drainage regimes. A thermal anomaly over an area of approximately 6 m 2 above a known mineshaft was characterised by traces of methane and increased temperatures of between 0. 5 oC to 1 oC in comparison to the adjacent ground surface. Using thermal infrared images, collected with the Daedalus 1260 Airborne Thematic Mapper, a scheme was developed to classify and map mineshafts with and without any observed visual characteristics. When applied using commercially flown thermal imagery the scheme identified several potential sites of abandoned mineshafts in an area designated for the redevelopment of the Nottingham Business Park, East Midlands.

As a method for qualitatively assessing the thermal efficiency of buildings, infrared thermography cannot be used to obtain estimates of indoor temperatures or allow inferences about the energy consumption behaviour of the occupants. However, front elevation <b>thermal</b> <b>surveys</b> can complement existing datasets like local house condition surveys and Reduced Data SAP assessments, where these datasets include assumptions on house condition based on housing archetypes. This allows for more accurate and individual identification of homes with poor thermal performance which might put the household at risk of fuel poverty.

In the absence of consensus in the fuel poverty literature about the weighting of fuel poverty indices, and {{due to the lack of}} empirical evidence linking infrared thermography classifications to fuel poverty risks, a data-driven fuzzy set approach to multidimensional poverty measurement was used to weight and aggregate the index. This method also overcomes the limitations of defining fuel poverty vulnerability as an absolute and dichotomous condition, by permitting relative degrees of risk. The index performs well in reflecting the known interactions of fuel poverty risk factors, but could not be verified since data on the actual level of fuel poverty in the study area was not available.

Excellent results have been obtained in terms of volcanic prediction during the two recent eruptions of Mt Etna and Stromboli, both occurred in 2002 - 2003. On Etna, thermal images monthly recorded on the summit of the volcano revealed the opening of fissure systems several months in advance. After the onset of the flank eruption, daily thermal mapping allowed us to monitor a complex lava flow field spreading within a forest, below a thick plume of ash and gas. At Stromboli, helicopter-borne <b>thermal</b> <b>surveys</b> allowed us to recognise the opening of fractures along the Sciara del Fuoco, one hour before the large failure that caused severe destruction on the island on 30 December 2002. This was the first time ever that volcanic flank collapse has been monitored with a thermal camera. In addition, we could follow the exceptional explosive event of the 5 th April 2003 at Stromboli from helicopter with a thermal camera recording images immediately before, during and after the huge explosion. We believe that a more extended use of thermal cameras in volcano monitoring, both on the ground and from fixed positions, will significantly improve our understanding of volcanic phenomena and hazard evaluations during volcanic crisis...|$|R
40|$|Thermal {{performance}} {{study is}} one of the critical aspects of the natural ventilated vernacular buildings. Thermal comfort studies of built environment mainly focussed on two different approaches, one is heat balance approach and the other is adaptive approach. <b>Thermal</b> comfort <b>survey</b> has been carried out in 50 houses covering over 100 occupants of cold and cloudy climatic zone of North East India. This comfort study has been done in the form of long term thermal monitoring at outside and inside of a house, comfort survey based on ASHRAE thermal sensation scale for different seasons of the year. Comfort temperatures are calculated based on Humphreys and Auliciems comfort model. Neutral temperatures at which people feels comfortable in this natural ventilate buildings are obtained from the comfort survey. It has been found that the comfort temperature obtained from the Humphreys and Auliciems comfort model differs with the neutral temperatures obtained from comfort surevy. There are four major indicator like outdoor and indoor temperatures, relative humidity and clothing pattern of the peoples has direct impact on the peoples perception and acceptabilty on comfort situtaion. In this study, thermal comfort equations are developed based on these four indicator and validated with the neutral temperature obtained from comfort survey. It has been found that the comfort equation developed with all these four indicators has highest co-relation coefficient and provide the neutral temparture values very close to <b>thermal</b> comfort <b>survey</b> results. However, these equations are valid only for similar kinds of natural ventilated buildings and also for similar kinds of building functioning management of this climatic zones. It is also not appropriate to obtaine a genralized thermal comfort model as the adpation process and the expectation and perceptation of the peoples are region specific and also differs with socio-cultural norms.
