40|$|Abstract: Effects {{of initial}} {{concentration}} of Ag(І), concentration of HNO 3, contact time and adsorption temperature on adsorption capacities {{of a novel}} polystyrene modified ethoxycarbonyl <b>thiourea</b> <b>resin</b> were investigated, and the maximum adsorption capacity of Ag(І) reached 4. 11 mmol·g- 1. The adsorption kinetics was well fitted Boyd’s diffusion equation of liquid film, so the adsorption was controlled by liquid film diffusion. The experimental date fitted Langmuir equation, and the correlation coefficient was close to 1. The positive value of adsorption enthalpy ∆H is indicative of an endothermic process. FT-IR characteristic peaks of ethoxycarbonyl and thiourea groups changed obviously fore-and-aft adsorption, {{which means that the}} corresponding functional groups coordinate with Ag during the adsorption process...|$|E
40|$|The {{catalytic}} activity of different supported bifunctional <b>thioureas</b> on sulfonylpolystyrene <b>resins</b> {{has been studied}} in the nitro-Michael addition of different nucleophiles to trans -β-nitrostyrene derivatives. The activity of the catalysts depends {{on the length of}} the tether linking the chiral thiourea to the polymer. The best results were obtained with the thiourea derived from (L) -valine and 1, 6 -hexanediamine. The catalysts can be used in only 2 mol % loading, and reused for at least four cycles in neat conditions. The ball milling promoted additions also worked very well...|$|R
