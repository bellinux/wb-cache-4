The Von Steins were experienced with {{other types of}} museum conservation work, but had never restored carousel animals. Because of the animals' poor condition, no attempt was made to restore them to their original paintwork; instead, the restorers were allowed to use <b>their</b> <b>judgment</b> on color choices and other decorations. The museum's only requirements were that they use reasonably natural decorative schemes and no high-gloss paint.|$|E
5|$|The ruling {{clears the}} way for the plaintiff-respondents to collect from the roughly $1.75billion bank account, which will be enough to satisfy about 70% of their {{collective}} $2.5billion in judgments. They will not be eligible to collect from a $1billion fund—the Victims of State Sponsored Terrorism Fund—established by Congress in 2015 to pay victims of state-sponsored terrorism. That fund pays 30% of judgments until all applicants have received that amount; remaining funds will not be distributed until all claimants have received 30% of <b>their</b> <b>judgment.</b>|$|E
5|$|The book {{describes}} Bush as largely {{leaving the}} management of the war to Generals George Casey and John Abizaid and deferring to <b>their</b> <b>judgment</b> based on Bush's perception of Lyndon Johnson's micromanagement during the Vietnam War. As the generals' strategy of drawing down U.S. forces and transferring control to the Iraqis begins to fail, the book argues, Bush grows more disillusioned and sought other ideas. The book alleges that, nevertheless, the President delayed serious investigation because of his fear that leaked reports would hurt the Republican Party's chances in the 2006 congressional elections. It states that Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld refused to consider resigning unless the Republicans lost control of either the House of Representatives or the Senate.|$|E

Three age groups of children (144 subjects) heard four stories and were placed in three conditions to investigate whether <b>their</b> <b>judgments</b> could be influenced by asking them to pay attention either to why the protagonist did what she or he did or {{to what happened in}} the story, or given no instructions. As age increased, children's recall of stories and use of a protagonist's intention as a reason behind <b>their</b> <b>judgments</b> increased. Judgment scores followed the same pattern for all ages.

In addition, Cook's statement had not been clear and unambiguous enough to provide legitimate expectation.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 1960s {{there was an}} {{exchange}} between judges and academics in the United Kingdom and United States comparing the process of appeal used in both nations. Although the British judges found the emphasis on written arguments unattractive, they did {{like the idea of}} pre-reading; that the court should read the pleadings of counsel, the case being appealed and the judgment from the lower court before delivering <b>their</b> <b>judgment.</b> After a trial in the Court of Appeal, despite the success of this, the idea was quietly scrapped. The court which Lord Denning presided over from 1962 to 1982 was under no pressure and had no inclination to modernise, with liaisons and management handled by clerks with little knowledge. This changed in 1981 with the appointment of a Registrar, John Adams, an academic and lawyer, who significantly reformed the internal workings of the Court.|$|E
25|$|Goodness, he believed, came {{more from}} {{practice}} and discipline than from innate human nature. He believed {{that one should}} distance oneself from the wicked, stating that such association increases disposition to vice. Anger, while difficult to control, must be mastered in order for one to be rational. Those who take pleasure from the disasters of their neighbors fail to understand that their fortunes {{are tied to the}} society in which they live, and they rob themselves of any joy of their own. Democritus believed that happiness was a property of the soul. He advocated a life of contentment with as little grief as possible, which he said could not be achieved through either idleness or preoccupation with worldly pleasures. Contentment would be gained, he said, through moderation and a measured life; to be content one must set <b>their</b> <b>judgment</b> on the possible and be satisfied with what one has—giving little thought to envy or admiration. Democritus approved of extravagance on occasion, as he held that feasts and celebrations were necessary for joy and relaxation. He considers education to be the noblest of pursuits, but cautioned that learning without sense leads to error.|$|E

Vandenberg questioned whether the Air Force could be effective against targets in Manchuria, while Bradley noted that the Communists were also waging limited war in Korea, having not attacked UN airbases or ports, or their own [...] "privileged sanctuary" [...] in Japan. <b>Their</b> <b>judgment</b> was that it was not worth it to expand the war, although they conceded that they were prepared to do so if the Communists escalated the conflict, or if no willingness to negotiate was forthcoming.

500|$|The {{case was}} {{heard in the}} Divisional Court by Lord Justice Kay and Mr Justice Collins in January 2005. In <b>their</b> <b>judgment,</b> {{they found that the}} {{legislation}} made using the 1911 Act could modify the Act, as indicated by the reference to [...] "any Public Bill" [...] being permitted to use the Parliament Acts (except for a limited number of express exceptions). Furthermore, they ruled that the 1911 Act did not create a method of making delegated legislation, but was instead a redefinition {{of the relationship between the}} House of Commons and the House of Lords. Moreover, there was found to be [...] "no established principle applicable to this case which denies a power of amendment of the earlier statute in the absence of the express conferral of one specifically dealing with amendment". The Parliament Act 1949 was therefore found to have been validly passed using the Parliament Act 1911 and the Hunting Act was consequently also held to be an Act of Parliament.|$|E
500|$|By the mid- to {{late 1990s}} Mehldau was {{regarded}} {{by some as}} one of the leading jazz musicians: critic John Fordham described him as [...] "the next great keyboard star of jazz". The appreciation was not universal: some of the pianist's self-penned liner notes and interview comments, which included philosophical musings and complaints about comparisons with pianist Bill Evans, engendered dislike in some, thereby, in critic Nate Chinen's words, [...] "leaving Mehldau with a lingering reputation for pretentiousness and self-indulgence." [...] Many critics did, though, reassess <b>their</b> <b>judgment</b> of his main influences, which previously had often been given as Evans, an assessment that was perhaps attributable more to race than to music. Another, non-musical, similarity with Evans that was commented on was Mehldau's struggle with an addiction to heroin during the 1990s, up to 1998. Around 1996 he moved to Los Angeles, to try to overcome this drug problem. Mehldau later stated that [...] "Once I stopped using heroin, it was like a rush of creativity that had been held in check came out".|$|E
500|$|The case {{first went}} to the Divisional Court, where Hooper LJ and Cresswell J decided in favour of Bancoult on 11 May 2006. The court found that the [...] "interests of BIOT must be or must {{primarily}} be those whose right of abode and unrestricted right to enter and remain was being in effect removed", and that as Section 9 of the Constitutional Order did not {{serve the interests of}} it or its inhabitants, it was irrational. At the same time, the court was asked to rule on whether an Order in Council could be questioned in judicial review proceedings. It decided that, under Council of Civil Service Unions v Minister for the Civil Service, the decisive element was not the origin of the power (in this case, the Royal Prerogative) but the nature of the power. Accordingly, Orders in Council were subject to judicial review. This decision was appealed to the Court of Appeal of England and Wales, composed of Butler-Sloss, Sedley and Neuberger LJJ, who agreed with the Divisional Court in <b>their</b> <b>judgment</b> issued on 23 May 2007.|$|E

500|$|It {{has been}} argued, however, that privity {{is not even}} a {{distinct}} doctrine, but rather simply part of consideration. Consideration is a rule that there must be a [...] "benefit or detriment" [...] involved in any contract, and that this must initially come from the promisee. It is argued that this rule and the doctrine of privity are two ways of saying the same thing - that to say someone is not a party to the contract is the same as saying that they gave no consideration in the initial agreement. This attitude is found in decisions by the Judiciary of England and Wales - in, Tweddle v Atkinson, Crompton and Blackburn JJ made the decision that they did because the claimant had not provided consideration, and the majority in Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre Co Ltd v Selfridge & Co Ltd based <b>their</b> <b>judgment</b> on a similar point. It is worth noting, however, that [...] Lord Haldane maintained in his judgement in Dunlop that, independent of consideration, it was a rule in English law that [...] "only a person who is party to a contract can sue on it".|$|E
