5|$|Electroporation is {{the rapid}} {{increase}} in bilayer permeability induced by {{the application of a}} large artificial electric field across the membrane. Experimentally, electroporation is used to introduce hydrophilic molecules into cells. It is a particularly useful technique for large highly charged molecules such as DNA, which would never passively diffuse across the hydrophobic bilayer core. Because of this, electroporation {{is one of the key}} methods of <b>transfection</b> as well as bacterial transformation. It has even been proposed that electroporation resulting from lightning strikes could be a mechanism of natural horizontal gene transfer.|$|E
5|$|One major {{advantage}} of genome-scale RNAi screening {{is its ability}} to simultaneously interrogate thousands of genes. With the ability to generate a large amount of data per experiment, genome-scale RNAi screening has led to an explosion data generation rates. Exploiting such large data sets is a fundamental challenge, requiring suitable statistics/bioinformatics methods. The basic process of cell-based RNAi screening includes the choice of an RNAi library, robust and stable cell types, <b>transfection</b> with RNAi agents, treatment/incubation, signal detection, analysis and identification of important genes or therapeutical targets.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} {{possible}} explanations for the high mortality rate of the 1918 influenza pandemic. Some {{research suggests that the}} specific variant of the virus had an unusually aggressive nature. One group of researchers recovered the original virus from the bodies of frozen victims, and found that <b>transfection</b> in animals caused a rapid progressive respiratory failure and death through a cytokine storm (overreaction of the body's immune system). It was then postulated that the strong immune reactions of young adults ravaged the body, whereas the weaker immune systems of children and middle-aged adults resulted in fewer deaths among those groups.|$|E

40|$|Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) is an alphaherpesvirus {{that causes}} two diseases, {{chickenpox}} and zoster. VZV {{open reading frame}} 4 (ORF 4) encodes the immediate-early 4 (IE 4) protein, which is conserved among alphaherpesvirus and has transactivation activity in transient <b>transfections.</b> To determine whether the ORF 4 gene product is essential for viral replication, we used VZV cosmids to remove ORF 4 from the VZV genome. Deleting ORF 4 was incompatible with recovery of infectious virus, whereas <b>transfections</b> done by using repaired cosmids with ORF 4 inserted at a nonnative site yielded virus. To analyze the functional domain of IE 4, we introduced a mutation altering the C-terminal amino acids, KYFKC (K 443 S), {{which was designed to}} disrupt the dimerization of IE 4 protein. <b>Transfections</b> with these mutant cosmids yielded no virus, indicating that this KYFKC motif was essential for IE 4 function...|$|R

5|$|Depending on the {{organism}} and experimental system, the exogenous RNA {{may be a}} long strand designed to be cleaved by dicer, or short RNAs designed to serve as siRNA substrates. In most mammalian cells, shorter RNAs are used because long double-stranded RNA molecules induce the mammalian interferon response, a form of innate immunity that reacts nonspecifically to foreign genetic material. Mouse oocytes and cells from early mouse embryos lack this reaction to exogenous dsRNA {{and are therefore a}} common model system for studying mammalian gene-knockdown effects. Specialized laboratory techniques have also been developed to improve the utility of RNAi in mammalian systems by avoiding the direct introduction of siRNA, for example, by stable <b>transfection</b> with a plasmid encoding the appropriate sequence from which siRNAs can be transcribed, or by more elaborate lentiviral vector systems allowing the inducible activation or deactivation of transcription, known as conditional RNAi.|$|E
5|$|Following Asilomar, new genetic {{engineering}} techniques and applications developed rapidly. DNA sequencing methods improved greatly (pioneered by Frederick Sanger and Walter Gilbert), as did oligonucleotide synthesis and <b>transfection</b> techniques. Researchers learned {{to control the}} expression of transgenes, and were soon racing—in both academic and industrial contexts—to create organisms capable of expressing human genes {{for the production of}} human hormones. However, this was a more daunting task than molecular biologists had expected; developments between 1977 and 1980 showed that, due to the phenomena of split genes and splicing, higher organisms had a much more complex system of gene expression than the bacteria models of earlier studies. The first such race, for synthesizing human insulin, was won by Genentech. This {{marked the beginning of the}} biotech boom (and with it, the era of gene patents), with an unprecedented level of overlap between biology, industry, and law.|$|E
25|$|In this {{technique}} siRNA first must be designed against the target gene. Once the siRNA is configured against the gene {{it has to}} be effectively delivered through a <b>transfection</b> protocol. Delivery is usually done by cationic liposomes, polymer nanoparticles, and lipid conjugation. This method is advantageous because it can deliver siRNA to most types of cells, has high efficiency and reproducibility, and is offered commercially. The most common commercial reagents for <b>transfection</b> of siRNA are Lipofectamine and Neon <b>Transfection.</b> However it is not compatible with all cell types, and has low in vivo efficiency.|$|E
40|$|Gene {{transfer}} and expression in eukaryotes is often limited {{by a number}} of stably maintained gene copies and by epigenetic silencing effects. Silencing may be limited by the use of epigenetic regulatory sequences such as matrix attachment regions (MAR). Here, we show that successive <b>transfections</b> of MAR-containing vectors allow a synergistic increase of transgene expression. This finding is partly explained by an increased entry into the cell nuclei and genomic integration of the DNA, an effect that requires both the MAR element and iterative <b>transfections.</b> Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis often showed single integration events, indicating that DNAs introduced in successive <b>transfections</b> could recombine. High expression was also linked to the cell division cycle, so that nuclear transport of the DNA occurs when homologous recombination is most active. Use of cells deficient in either non-homologous end-joining or homologous recombination suggested that efficient integration and expression may require homologous recombination-based genomic integration of MAR-containing plasmids and the lack of epigenetic silencing events associated with tandem gene copies. We conclude that MAR elements may promote homologous recombination, and that cells and vectors can be engineered {{to take advantage of this}} property to mediate highly efficient gene {{transfer and}} expressio...|$|R

40|$|Fluorescent {{cellular}} biomarkers play {{a prominent}} role in biosciences. Most of the available biomarkers have some drawbacks due to either physical and optical or cytotoxic properties. In view of this, we investigated the potential of green fluorescent nanodiamonds as biomarkers in living cells. Nanodiamonds were functionalized by attaching antibodies that target intracellular structures such as actin filaments and mitochondria. Then, the nanodiamond conjugates were transfected into HeLa cells. <b>Transfections</b> were mediated by 4 (th) -generation dendrimers, cationic liposomes and prolamine sulfate. Using fluorescence microscopy, we confirmed successful <b>transfections</b> of the nanodiamonds into HeLa cells. Nanodiamond fluorescence could be easily differentiated from cellular autofluorescence. Furthermore, nanodiamonds could be targeted selectively to intracellular structures. Therefore, nanodiamonds are a promising tool for intracellular assays...|$|R

25|$|It is well {{established}} that the macromolecular structure of nonviral gene delivery vectors alters their <b>transfection</b> efficacy and cytotoxicity. The cyclized structure has been proven to reduce cytotoxicity and increase circulation time for drug and gene delivery applications. The unique structure of cyclizing chains provides the single chain cyclized polymers a different method of interaction between the polymer and plasmid DNA, and results in a general trend of higher <b>transfection</b> capabilities than branched polymers. Moreover, {{due to the nature}} of the single chain structure, this cyclized polymer can “untie” to a linear chain under reducing conditions. <b>Transfection</b> profiles on astrocytes comparing 25 kDa-PEI, SuperFect® and Lipofectamine®2000 and cyclized polymer showed greater efficiency and cell viability whilst maintaining neural cell viability above 80% four days post transfections.|$|E

The expressed proteins have correct molecular weights. Optimization of light chain over heavy chain expression by these IRES mutants enhances monoclonal antibody expression level and quality in stable <b>transfections.</b> Uses of this set of IRES mutants can be extended to other applications such as synthetic biology, investigating interactions between proteins and its complexes, cell engineering, multi-subunit protein production, gene therapy, and reprogramming of somatic cells into stem cells...|$|R
40|$|Matrix {{attachment}} {{regions are}} DNA sequences found throughout eukaryotic genomes that {{are believed to}} define boundaries interfacing heterochromatin and euchromatin domains, thereby acting as epigenetic regulators. When included in expression vectors, MARs can improve and sustain transgene expression, and a search for more potent novel elements is therefore actively pursued to further improve recombinant protein production. Here we describe the isolation of new MARs from the mouse genome using a modified in silico analysis. One of these MARs {{was found to be}} a powerful activator of transgene expression in stable <b>transfections.</b> Interestingly, this MAR also increased GFP and/or immunoglobulin expression from some but not all expression vectors in transient <b>transfections.</b> This effect was attributed to {{the presence or absence of}} elements on the vector backbone, providing an explanation for earlier discrepancies as to the ability of this class of elements to affect transgene expression under such conditions...|$|R
25|$|When {{microorganisms}} {{are able}} to take up and replicate DNA from their local environment, the process is termed transformation, and cells that are in a physiological state such that they can take up DNA {{are said to be}} competent. In mammalian cell culture, the analogous process of introducing DNA into cells is commonly termed <b>transfection.</b> Both transformation and <b>transfection</b> usually require preparation of the cells through a special growth regime and chemical treatment process that will vary with the specific species and cell types that are used.|$|E

25|$|Non-viral methods present certain {{advantages}} over viral methods, such as large scale production and low host immunogenicity.

40|$|Hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 alpha (HNF 1 alpha) is a {{homeodomain}} {{transcription factor}} that {{is central to}} co-ordinated differentiation {{of a number of}} cell lineages, including hepatocytes in the liver and islet cells in the pancreas.
