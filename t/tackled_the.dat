5|$|According to {{the terms}} of the new alliance, during the late summer, the Christian fleet {{assembled}} at Messina, under the command of Don John of Austria, who arrived on 23 August. By that time, however, Famagusta had fallen, and any effort to save Cyprus was meaningless. Before setting sail for the east, Don John {{had to deal with the}} mutual distrust and hostility among the various contingents, especially between the Venetians and the Genoese. The Spanish admiral <b>tackled</b> <b>the</b> problem by breaking the various contingents up and mingle ships from various states. Doria assumed command of the right wing, Don Juan kept the centre, the Venetian Agostino Barbarigo received the left, and the Spaniard Alvaro de Bazan the reserve. Unaware of Famagusta's fate, the allied fleet left Messina on 16 September, and ten days later arrived at Corfu, where it learned of the Ottoman victory. The Ottoman fleet, commanded by Müezzinzade Ali Pasha, had anchored at Lepanto (Nafpaktos), near the entrance of the Corinthian Gulf.|$|E
5|$|Bethe {{continued}} to do research on supernovae, neutron stars, black holes, and other problems in theoretical astrophysics into his late nineties. In doing this, he collaborated with Gerald E. Brown of Stony Brook University. In 1978, Brown proposed that they collaborate on supernovae. These were reasonably well understood by this time, but the calculations were still a problem. Using techniques honed from decades of working with nuclear physics, and some experience with calculations involving nuclear explosions, Bethe <b>tackled</b> <b>the</b> problems involved in stellar gravitational collapse, {{and the way in}} which various factors affected a supernova explosion. Once again, he was able to reduce the problem to a set of differential equations, and solve them.|$|E
5|$|Bleak then {{returned}} to the patrol and attempted to treat more wounded members, but soon thereafter a Chinese hand grenade bounced off the helmet of the soldier standing next to him and landed nearby. Bleak <b>tackled</b> <b>the</b> soldier over and covered him with his larger frame to protect him from the grenade, but neither was injured in the ensuing blast. The patrol then continued on its mission, and was successful in capturing several Chinese prisoners. However, as it descended Hill 499 to return to UN lines, they were ambushed by another group of Chinese hidden in a trench with an automatic weapon. Three of the other soldiers were wounded in the attack, and as Bleak attempted to run to them, he was hit in the leg. Bleak dressed all four wounds, but one of the men had been hit too critically to move. In spite of continued Chinese fire and his own injury, Bleak picked up the wounded soldier and began to carry him down the hill.|$|E

5|$|Chris Chibnall {{wanted to}} write a story that <b>tackled</b> <b>the</b> issue of loss and {{revolved}} around a missing person case. Executive producer Russell T Davies appreciated the character dynamics and domestic themes in the episode and cited the script as one of his inspirations in continuing the series. Ruth Jones, who is generally better known for her comedic roles, was cast against type in the central guest role of Nikki Bevan. The episode was filmed largely on location in South Wales with the island of Flat Holm featuring prominently. Response to the episode was generally positive. Reviewers generally praised the episode for illuminating the conflicting elements of Gwen's character and providing a central dilemma with no easy answer. Some critics identified ostensible plot holes, though felt that the episode's emotional successes negated these.|$|E
5|$|From 1944, Guest was Leader of the House {{until he}} retired from {{political}} office in 1948. He retained his wartime role as Air Minister and Rhodesia capitalised on her experience to form her own highly efficient Air Force. He also <b>tackled</b> <b>the</b> problem of young airmen returning to civilian life, training aircrews for civilian duty as well as helping young men complete their academic education. He continued as Minister of Defence and Air from 7 June 1946 to 15 September 1948. He chaired the South African Air Transport Council in its deliberations in 1947 regarding air traffic control {{and the establishment of}} control centres at Nairobi, Salisbury and Johannesburg, as well as communications and the future needs of air transport in southern Africa.|$|E
5|$|In 1585, {{war broke}} out between England and Spain. The Anglo-Spanish War {{was not limited to}} Europe—extending to Spanish and English territories in the Americas. In November 1595, Sir Francis Drake, the vice-admiral in command of the Royal Navy fleet that <b>tackled</b> <b>the</b> Spanish Armada, and Sir John Hawkins {{attempted}} an unsuccessful invasion of San Juan. Both Hawkins and Drake died of illness {{in the course of the}} campaign. On June 15, 1598, the English fleet, led by George Clifford, landed in Santurce and held the island for several months. He was forced to abandon the island upon an outbreak of bacillary dysentery among his troops. In 1599, 400 additional soldiers and 46 cannons were sent to the island along with a new governor, Alonso de Mercado, to rebuild the city.|$|E

5|$|In Britain, {{a number}} of {{scientists}} considered whether an atomic bomb was practical. At the University of Liverpool, Chadwick and the Polish refugee scientist Joseph Rotblat <b>tackled</b> <b>the</b> problem, but their calculations were inconclusive. At Cambridge, Nobel Prize in Physics laureates George Paget Thomson and William Lawrence Bragg wanted the government to take urgent action to acquire uranium ore. The main source of this was the Belgian Congo, and they were worried that it could fall into German hands. Unsure {{as to how to}} go about this, they spoke to Sir William Spens, the master of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge. In April 1939, he approached Sir Kenneth Pickthorn, the local Member of Parliament, who took their concerns to the Secretary of the Committee for Imperial Defence, Major General Hastings Ismay. Ismay in turn asked Sir Henry Tizard for an opinion. Like many scientists, Tizard was sceptical of the likelihood of an atomic bomb being developed, reckoning the odds of success at 100,000 to 1.|$|E
5|$|Later on the 16 April, in a {{small-scale}} counter-attack, eight SchlG 10 Fw 190s {{escorted by}} 16 Bf 109s of JG 27 led {{an attack on}} Allied airfields near Souk el Khemis. They destroyed six A-20 Havoc bombers. The next day, 17 April, II./ZG 26 several Bf 110s were shot down by No. 260 Squadron RAF P-40s on offensive operations. In response, the American 97th Bomb Group dispatched seven B-17s covered by 40 P-38s to bomb Palermo airfields. A large air battle developed when 30 Bf 110s and Bf 109s from ZG 26 and JG 27 intercepted. The Bf 110s attacked the bombers while the JG 27 Bf 109s <b>tackled</b> <b>the</b> escorts. The Germans claimed five bombers and one fighter {{for the loss of}} one Bf 109. Actual Allied losses are unknown.|$|E
5|$|The gaseous {{diffusion}} process required suitable pumps that had to meet stringent requirements. Like the diffusers, they had to resist corrosion from the uranium hexafluoride feed. Corrosion would not only damage the pumps, but would contaminate the feed. They could not afford any leakage of uranium hexafluoride, especially if it was already enriched, or leak oil, which would react with the uranium hexafluoride. They had to pump at high rates, and handle a gas twelve times as dense as air. To meet these requirements, the SAM Laboratories chose to use centrifugal pumps. They were aware that the desired compression ratio of 2.3:1 to 3.2:1 was unusually high {{for this type of}} pump. For some purposes, a reciprocating pump would suffice, and these were designed by Henry A. Boorse at the SAM Laboratories, while Ingersoll Rand <b>tackled</b> <b>the</b> centrifugal pumps.|$|E

5|$|The kickoff was {{returned}} to the Tennessee 17-yard line, and Tennessee's offense began work. The Volunteers were aided by a five-yard offsides penalty against Virginia Tech on the first play of the drive, but the Hokies stopped the Tennessee offense for losses or no gain until Manning threw a 14-yard pass on third down, pushing Tennessee to the 34-yard line. After two incomplete passes, Manning scrambled 27 yards for another first down, this time at the Tech 39-yard line. Once there, however, the Virginia Tech defense stiffened and did not allow another first down during the drive. Tennessee kicker John Becksvoort came into the game, seemingly to attempt a 48-yard field goal. The kick {{turned out to be}} a trick play—an attempted pass by the kick holder—but Hokie defender Mike Williams <b>tackled</b> <b>the</b> holder for a loss.|$|E
5|$|The {{process of}} {{breaking}} into and exploring the communist tunnels began on 9 January, {{with the objective}} now switching to the location, clearance and destruction of the tunnel complexes. Whereas standard US Army practice was to seal, blow up or otherwise attempt to render tunnel systems unusable with smoke, tear gas and explosives before quickly moving on, the Australians spent {{the next few days}} laboriously searching and mapping the complexes they found using military engineers. Led by MacGregor, the Australian sappers from 3 Field Troop systematically <b>tackled</b> <b>the</b> tunnels, using telephone line and compasses to plot the subterranean passages. Small-scale contacts between the communists and the Australians continued and MacGregor was later awarded the Military Cross for his leadership.|$|E
5|$|After Cassini {{became the}} first {{director}} of the Paris Observatory in 1671, he <b>tackled</b> <b>the</b> problem of the physical scale of the Solar System. The relative size of the planetary orbits was known from Kepler's third law, so what was needed was the actual size {{of one of the}} planet's orbits. For this purpose, the position of Mars was measured against the background stars from different points on the Earth, thereby measuring the diurnal parallax of the planet. During this year, the planet was moving past the point along its orbit where it was nearest to the Sun (a perihelic opposition), which made this a particularly close approach to the Earth. Cassini and Jean Picard determined the position of Mars from Paris, while the French astronomer Jean Richer made measurements from Cayenne, South America. Although these observations were hampered by the quality of the instruments, the parallax computed by Cassini came within 10% of the correct value. The English astronomer John Flamsteed made comparable measurement attempts and had similar results.|$|E

5|$|Michèle Mouton {{was born}} 23 June 1951 in Grasse, a {{town on the}} French Riviera known for its perfume industry, close to the {{mountain}} stages famously featured in French rallies. Her parents grew roses and jasmine on their large property. After graduating from high school, Mouton began law studies, but would soon drop out and concentrate on a career in rallying. Although Mouton began driving her father's Citroën 2CV when she was 14 years old, she did not turn her interest to rallying until 1972, when her friend Jean Taibi asked her to practise the Tour de Corse with him. Mouton later co-drove {{for him in the}} 1973 Monte Carlo Rally, the first-ever World Rally Championship (WRC) event. After a few more rallies, Mouton's father suggested a switch to driving if she wanted to continue in rallying, and promised to buy her a car and give her one-year to prove herself. Driving an Alpine-Renault A110, she debuted at the Critérium Féminin Paris-Saint-Raphaël and then <b>tackled</b> <b>the</b> Tour de France Automobile. In the Île de Beauté, a complementary event to the Tour de Corse at the end of 1973, Mouton finished eighth overall.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} programme {{moved to the}} University of Exeter in 1982, where the C1 chassis was fitted with fibreglass shells and tested in a wind tunnel. It was recognised {{at an early stage}} that the vehicle would have to be aerodynamic; although it was only ever intended to be small and relatively slow, reducing wind resistance was seen as essential for the vehicle's efficiency. By March 1982 the basic design of the C1 had been established. Sinclair then turned to an established motor design company, Ogle Design of Letchworth, to provide professional styling assistance and production engineering. However, Ogle's approach was not to Sinclair's liking; they <b>tackled</b> <b>the</b> project as one of car design and focused more (and expensively) on the aerodynamics rather than the cycle technology around which the C1 was based. The weight of the vehicle increased to over , far more than Sinclair's desired specification. By March 1983, Sinclair and Wood Rogers had decided to stop the C1 programme. Wood Rogers comments that Ogle were convinced that the C1 would be a flop, telling Sinclair {{that it would not be}} fast enough, that its drivers would get wet when it rained and that the battery was not good enough.|$|E
5|$|Reflecting Holby City origins as a {{spin-off}} from Casualty and the {{closely related}} premises {{of the two}} programmes, the BBC has screened occasional crossover mini-dramas entitled Casualty@Holby City, featuring a number of characters {{from each of the}} two casts. Prior to the commissioning of Casualty@Holby City, the two shows had occasionally crossed-over storylines and cast members before; for instance developing a romance between Holby City Ben Saunders (David Paisley) and Casualty Tony Vincent (Lee Warburton). The first full crossover was spearheaded by Casualty executive producer Mervyn Watson, and Holby City McHale. Logistical difficulties arose from the fact the two series are usually produced 120 miles apart, and work on both shows had to be halted for two weeks to release a number of cast members to appear in the special. A second crossover was commissioned in 2005 as part of the BBC's DoNation season, aiming to raise public awareness of organ donation and help viewers make an informed decision about whether to sign up to the Organ Donor Register. An interactive episode of Casualty@Holby City was one of the headlining shows of the season, allowing viewers to vote by phone to determine the outcome of a fictional organ donation. The third Casualty@Holby City crossover aired in October 2005. The four-part storyline <b>tackled</b> <b>the</b> issue of youth violence, following the events of a turbulent A demonstration at an inner-city school. Based on the success of the 2004 Casualty@Holby City Christmas special, another crossover was ordered for Christmas 2005. Rather than dividing the episodes between the two series' crews as had previously been standard, this crossover operated as an entirely separate production, with Kyle producing and Paul Harrison directing.|$|E
