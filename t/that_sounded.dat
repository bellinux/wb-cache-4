5|$|Echoes, Silence, Patience & Grace is {{the sixth}} studio album by rock band Foo Fighters, {{released}} on September 25, 2007 by RCA Records. The album is noted for {{a blend of}} regular rock and acoustic tracks with shifting dynamics, which emerged from the variety of styles employed on the demos the band produced. It also marks the second time the band worked with producer Gil Norton, whom frontman Dave Grohl brought to fully explore the potential of his compositions and have a record <b>that</b> <b>sounded</b> different from their previous work. Grohl {{tried to focus on}} songs with messages that resonated on the audience, writing reflective lyrics which drew inspiration from the birth of his daughter.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the first}} {{decisions}} Hsu had to make was how to localize Maya's hometown and the mysticism of the Fey clan. She {{came up with the}} idea that the localized versions of the Ace Attorney games take place in Los Angeles in an alternative universe where anti-Japanese laws like the California Alien Land Law of 1913 were not passed, anti-Japanese sentiments were not powerful, and where Japanese culture flourished. This dictated what should be localized and what should be kept Japanese; things relating to the Fey clan and the Kurain channeling technique were kept Japanese, as that was Maya's heritage, while Japanese foods that were not widely known in the West were changed. Despite the setting in the United States in the localized version, the Japanese justice system of the original remained intact in the localization, as changing it would have altered the entire game structure. As the localization team wanted to keep the humor in the Japanese names for the characters, it was decided to make the English names contain the same kinds of double meanings: character name puns were based on their personalities or backgrounds, or were visual gags. A lot of the names were determined with the original Japanese name in mind; for the game's third episode, several Japanese names were used without changes, since they were English puns to begin with. For some other characters, the names had to be altered heavily from the Japanese originals. Due to the dramatic feeling of the last episode, the characters in it were given names <b>that</b> <b>sounded</b> more like real names, while still making use of deeper meanings. Takumi personally approved all the English names; for one of the names, Takumi and the localization team had a discussion for days, as Takumi did not think the English name conveyed the same feeling as the Japanese one.|$|E

500|$|To {{facilitate}} a large range of timbres, organ stops exist at different pitch levels. A stop <b>that</b> <b>sounds</b> at unison pitch when a key is depressed {{is referred to}} as being at 8 (pronounced [...] "eight-foot") pitch. This refers to the length of the lowest-sounding pipe in that rank, which is approximately eight feet. For the same reason, a stop <b>that</b> <b>sounds</b> an octave higher is at 4 pitch, and one <b>that</b> <b>sounds</b> two octaves higher is at 2 pitch. Likewise, a stop <b>that</b> <b>sounds</b> an octave lower than unison pitch is at 16 pitch, and one <b>that</b> <b>sounds</b> two octaves lower is at 32 pitch. Stops of different pitch levels are designed to be played simultaneously.|$|R

40|$|Sounds are audible, {{and sound}} sources are audible. What is the audible {{relation}} between audible sounds and audible sources? Common talk and philosophy suggest three candidates. The first is <b>that</b> <b>sounds</b> audibly are properties instantiated by their sources. I argue <b>that</b> <b>sounds</b> are audible individuals {{and thus are}} not audibly instantiated by audible sources. The second is <b>that</b> <b>sounds</b> audibly are effects of their sources. I argue that auditory experience presents no compelling evidence <b>that</b> <b>sounds</b> audibly are causally related to audible sources. The third is <b>that</b> <b>sounds</b> audibly are related mereologically to their sources. I present and offer a defense of this third candidate. 1 Hearing sounds and hearing sources Sounds are audible. By sounds I mean ordinary squeaks, blips, clatters, jingles, and burbles. Sounds have sources. By sources I mean things like floorboards, electronics, collisions, jiggled keys, and speeches. It is plausible <b>that</b> <b>sound</b> sources also are audible. Spoken language permits saying you hear floorboards, electronics, collisions, jiggled keys, and speeches rather than just their sounds. Audition prompts you to form thoughts about material bodies and happenings. Certai...|$|R
25|$|By 1994 {{there were}} a number of techno {{producers}} in the UK and Europe building on the Detroit sound, but a number of other underground dance music styles were by then vying for attention. Some drew upon the Detroit techno aesthetic, while others fused components of preceding dance music forms. This led to the appearance (in the UK initially) of inventive new music <b>that</b> <b>sounded</b> far-removed from techno. For instance jungle (drum and bass) demonstrated influences ranging from hip-hop, soul, and reggae to techno and house.|$|E
25|$|Hackett's solo career continued, {{releasing}} {{a plethora of}} both electric, classical and acoustic based albums throughout the 1990s to the present day. In 1992 Virgin/Universal released the compilation The Unauthorised Biography, including two previous unreleased recordings co-written with Brian May of Queen. Hacketts first solorelease in the 90s was the low-key and melancholy Guitar Noir in 1993. An dreamy album <b>that</b> <b>sounded</b> darker and different from his last more commercial releases. It was followed up by the bluesy and right forward Blues with a Feeling (1994).|$|E

At noon, two men, who the neighbor believed were gardeners in the compound, gave her and her husband a purse they had found that turned out to be Rasmussen's.

25|$|Since its inception, Chachachá {{music had}} a close {{relationship}} with the dancer's steps. The well-known name Chachachá came into being {{with the help of the}} dancers at the Silver Star Club in Havana. When the dance was coupled to the rhythm of the music, it became evident that the dancer's feet were making a peculiar sound as they grazed the floor on three successive beats. It was like an onomatopoeia <b>that</b> <b>sounded</b> as: Chachachá. From this peculiar sound, a music genre was born which motivated people from around the world to dance at its catchy rhythm.|$|E
25|$|Other {{successful}} cases {{filed by}} Starbucks include the case won in 2006 against the chain Xingbake in Shanghai, China for trademark infringement, because the chain used a green-and-white circular logo {{with a name}} <b>that</b> <b>sounded</b> phonetically similar to the Chinese for Starbucks. Starbucks did not open any stores after first registering its trademark in Russia in 1997 and in 2002 a Russian lawyer successfully filed a request to cancel the trademark. He then registered the name with a Moscow company and asked for $600,000 to sell the trademark to Starbucks, but was ruled against in November 2005.|$|E
25|$|A UCIL {{employee}} {{triggered the}} plant's alarm system at 12:50a.m. as {{the concentration of}} gas {{in and around the}} plant became difficult to tolerate. Activation of the system triggered two siren alarms: one <b>that</b> <b>sounded</b> inside the UCIL plant, and a second directed outward to the public and the city of Bhopal. The two siren systems had been decoupled from one another in 1982, so {{that it was possible to}} leave the factory warning siren on while turning off the public one, and this is exactly what was done: the public siren briefly sounded at 12:50a.m. and was quickly turned off, as per company procedure meant to avoid alarming the public around the factory over tiny leaks. Workers, meanwhile, evacuated the UCIL plant, travelling upwind.|$|E

25|$|One curiosity is the {{association}} of this property with the candy Junior Mints, introduced in 1949 by the Cambridge, Massachusetts-based James O. Welch Company. The name of the product is a pun on Sally Benson's Junior Miss. According to one past official company history, when James Welch developed and launched the product in 1949, he named the candy after his favorite Broadway show. Yet the candy came six years after the play had closed on Broadway. The Junior Miss radio series was being broadcast weekly on CBS at the time Junior Mints were first marketed in 1949. Thus, Welch had cleverly created a product sold at movie theater concession stands and identified with a specific movie and then-current radio series and displaying a name <b>that</b> <b>sounded</b> almost exactly like that property—yet different enough that it avoided any fees for licensing and merchandising.|$|E
25|$|Britain's Great Western Railway {{introduced}} the Automatic Train Control (ATC) system in 1906. This {{system is the}} forerunner of today's Automatic Warning System (AWS) and consists of an electrical system <b>that</b> <b>sounded</b> a bell in the cab as the train approached a signal at clear. Power was fed through a metal ramp to a pickup {{on the underside of}} the locomotive to power the bell. An absence of the electrical voltage on the ramp caused a warning horn to sound in the locomotive's cab. The driver then had a set time to acknowledge the warning and start braking his train accordingly. If the driver did not acknowledge the warning, the brakes would be applied automatically. Where this was implemented, it did away with the need for fog signalling, since the driver could tell the state of the distant signal regardless of his ability to see it.|$|E
25|$|By using tape, I {{could do}} a thirty-five or forty-minute show, then edit {{it down to the}} twenty-six or twenty-seven minutes the program ran. In that way, we could take out jokes, gags, or {{situations}} that didn't play well and finish with only the prime meat of the show; the solid stuff that played big. We could also take out the songs that didn't sound good. It gave us a chance to first try a recording of the songs in the afternoon without an audience, then another one in front of a studio audience. We'd dub the one that came off best into the final transcription. It gave us a chance to ad lib as much as we wanted, knowing that excess ad libbing could be sliced from the final product. If I made a mistake in singing a song or in the script, I could have some fun with it, then retain any of the fun <b>that</b> <b>sounded</b> amusing.|$|E
5000|$|The {{pitch of}} a single bank of reeds is {{traditionally}} defined {{in a similar manner}} to the organ stops of a pipe organ. A bank <b>that</b> <b>sounds</b> at unison pitch when keys are depressed is called 8′ (pronounced [...] "eight-foot") pitch: alluding to the length of the lowest-sounding organ pipe in that rank, which is approximately eight feet. For the same reason, a stop <b>that</b> <b>sounds</b> an octave higher is at 4′ pitch, and one <b>that</b> <b>sounds</b> an octave lower than unison pitch is at 16′ pitch.|$|R
30|$|The {{previously}} described research implies {{that there are}} two important considerations when designing sounds for VEs, namely, <b>that</b> <b>sounds</b> should be informative and enable listeners to imagine the original (or intended) scene naturally and the other being <b>that</b> <b>sound</b> sources should be well localizable by listeners.|$|R
50|$|During {{the memory}} span experiment, each subject is {{presented}} with a sequence of stimuli of the same kind; words depicting objects, numbers, letters <b>that</b> <b>sound</b> similar, and letters <b>that</b> <b>sound</b> dissimilar. After being presented with the stimuli, the subject is asked to recall the sequence of stimuli that they were given in the exact order {{in which it was}} given. In one particular version of the experiment, if the subject recalled a list correctly, the list length increased by one for that type of material, and vice versa if it was recalled incorrectly. The theory is that people have a memory span of about seven items for numbers, the same for letters <b>that</b> <b>sound</b> dissimilar and short words. The memory span is projected to be shorter with letters <b>that</b> <b>sound</b> similar and longer words.|$|R

I knew him as a joker but <b>that</b> <b>sounded</b> too serious, so without thinking much, in my pyjamas, I went to the entrance door of the apartment, opened it and looked around. I have seen guards from the village and they were speaking to somebody that {{was standing in the}} entrance to apartment number one. I have noticed his dark skin and the hat and I listened, still without being afraid or thinking that something is very dangerous for me, and the guards are asking the permission to let the Red Cross enter apartment one and provide some aid to a wounded person and the man, he refuse. They said, 'Why should you be inhumane ?', and the man replied something like either, the Jews or the Israelis 'are not humane either.'
