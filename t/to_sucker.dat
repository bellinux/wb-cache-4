2500|$|In 1912, both Joe and Tony Stecher {{decided to}} join the {{professional}} ranks; and Joe easily defeated Bill Hokief in his first pro match. After a few months, it soon became apparent that Joe, who was taller and heavier than his older brother, was also the clearly superior grappler. However, Tony possessed greater savvy for the business; and so he subsequently became Joe's trainer and co-manager along with Joe Hetmanek (who had previously served as the Dodge postmaster). During this time, he also developed freakishly strong leg muscles as he practiced squeezing 100-pound sacks of grain on the farm until they would ultimately burst. As a result, Stecher soon became renowned for his feared leg scissors submission hold, which subsequently earned him the nickname of [...] "The Scissors King". Nevertheless, Stecher would not gain national awareness until attracting {{the attention of the}} fabled [...] "Farmer" [...] Martin Burns, the former American Heavyweight Champion who was also the mentor to the now-current World Heavyweight Wrestling Champion, Frank Gotch. While touring the area, Burns planned <b>to</b> <b>sucker</b> the area gamblers by offering cash to any local wrestler who could defeat his [...] "strongman", who just happened to be world-class hooker Yussiff Hussane, one of wrestling's feared [...] "Terrible Turks". This was a standard con for Burns' group, and when young Stecher accepted the offer, nobody anticipated that he would pose a legitimate challenge. However, Stecher proceeded to outwrestle the great champion, and when he finally slapped on his patented scissors hold after 45 minutes, a desperate Hussane was disqualified for biting Stecher’s leg.|$|E

50|$|Suckers on some {{ornamental}} {{plants are}} considered undesirable by horticulturists because the plant's energy is diverted <b>to</b> the <b>sucker</b> rather than <b>to</b> crown growth. Horticulturists recommend removing suckers on {{trees and shrubs}} by tearing them away {{as close to the}} base as possible, removing soil if necessary. The buds that give rise <b>to</b> <b>suckers</b> are more completely destroyed through tearing than through cutting. In extreme cases, the root giving rise <b>to</b> the <b>suckers</b> can be separated from the tree entirely, then treated {{in the same way as}} a stump with suckers.|$|R

5000|$|The {{film and}} book include a fictional card game known as tegwar, {{an acronym for}} [...] "the {{exciting}} game without any rules". It is a game designed to separate a sucker from their cash. Henry Wiggen plays this game along with other ballplayers and coaches <b>to</b> <b>sucker</b> passers-by {{in the lobby of}} the team hotel. It is generally believed that Bruce Pearson is too dumb to be able <b>to</b> <b>sucker</b> people, so he is initially excluded; however, Henry begins to include Bruce in the tegwar games as the story progresses.|$|E

50|$|Their arms do {{not possess}} lateral {{membranes}} and have 9 <b>to</b> 27 <b>suckers</b> on the ventral sucker series and 10 <b>to</b> 25 <b>suckers</b> on the dorsal sucker series. The left and right third arms have protective membranes greater in width than the arm width. The hectocotylus develops from {{the left or right}} fourth arm. Another distinguishing characteristic of O. bartramii is the presence of 4 <b>to</b> 7 toothed <b>suckers</b> on the tentacular club, near the nearest carpal suckers of the carpal locking apparatus. This is especially useful in differentiating it from the orangeback flying squid (Sthenoteuthis pteropus).|$|R

50|$|Malling 7 {{rootstock}} {{is slightly}} bigger than an M26 rootstock, and also requires staking {{in the first}} several years to establish a centre leader. This rootstock is moderately susceptible to blight and collar rot. The fruit size that M7 produces is good but not as large as an M26, or M9 rootstock. This root is highly susceptible <b>to</b> <b>suckering</b> and leaning over in its later years of life, which is very annoying and causes issues for the producer.|$|R

50|$|As {{the tree}} grows its trunk tends <b>to</b> <b>sucker</b> around the base, {{particularly}} following {{damage to the}} stem or roots, and it then may grow in a multi-trunked form. Brown bark of mature trees peels off in strips to reveal reddish-brown inner bark. Older specimens often look ragged, as the old needles may cling to stems for up to 5 years.|$|E
40|$|The family Musaceae {{comprises}} of {{four sections}} among which Rhodochlamysis one. The plants {{of this section}} {{are commonly known as}} ornamental banana, which occur wild in north east India. To exploit their ornamental value on a commercial scale, planting material becomes a limiting factor due <b>to</b> poor <b>suckering</b> ability of these plants. Invitro propagation can be tried, but it is not easily affordable by a normal farmer/gardner. Hence, macro propagation was tried to see the practicability in using it for large scale multiplication. Banana has strong apical dominance, which when suppressed will give rise <b>to</b> many side <b>suckers.</b> This principle was used in macro propagation. Musa laterita was used in the present study. It is commonly known as Bronze banana, because of its brightly coloured flower, which is the colour of laterite soil. The roots of this plant are rhizomatous and give rise <b>to</b> <b>suckers</b> at intervals. The composted saw dust was used as initiation medium. Among the three treatments tried, decapitation of rhizome and treatment with 0. 04 % BAPhas shown good results with high number of buds and high per cent of egeneratio...|$|R

Customers may also be added <b>to</b> <b>suckers</b> lists which are then sold to other companies offering similar schemes. When the land banking plot company fails plot investors may also be offered investment recovery or planning services for a fee. Such services typically are fraudulent or fail and lead to a further loss of money for the investor.|$|R
50|$|They {{are large}} shrubs or trees growing to 10-20 m tall with a trunk up to 70 cm diameter. E. coccineum and perhaps others, is also highly prone <b>to</b> <b>suckering</b> and {{unmanaged}} plants often form dense groves of many suckering shoots. The leaves are evergreen, occasionally deciduous in cold areas, 5-12 cm long and 2-4 cm broad. The flowers are produced in dense bunches, brilliant red (rarely white or yellow), tubular, 2.5-4.5 cm long, split into four lobes near the apex which reflex {{to expose the}} stamens and style.|$|R
50|$|This small eremophila is fast-growing but short-lived. It flowers over a {{long period}} and is known <b>to</b> <b>sucker.</b> Propagation is easy from {{cuttings}} but grafting onto Myoporum rootstock will prevent the development of suckers. It grows best in well-drained soil in full sun or partial shade and is very drought and frost tolerant but does not thrive in areas with high humidity.|$|E
50|$|Once Abrus precatorius {{plants have}} grown to {{maturity}} under favourable conditions, their deep roots are extremely difficult to remove, and the plants' aggressive growth, hard-shelled seeds, and ability <b>to</b> <b>sucker,</b> renders an infestation extremely difficult to eradicate and makes {{it very difficult to}} prevent re-infestation. Herbicides such as glyphosate are effective, but need skilled application if they are not to do more harm than good.|$|E
50|$|Specimens planted at the Sir Harold Hillier Gardens in Hampshire, England, in 1977 {{have grown}} very well on heavy clay {{in an open}} location, where they support colonies of the White-letter Hairstreak Satyrium w-album.

50|$|E. longifolia is {{not well}} known in {{horticulture}} although its weeping habit, hardiness and attractive flowers suggest it has potential. It makes a useful informal hedge, complemented by its ability <b>to</b> <b>sucker.</b> It is difficult to propagate from seed and cuttings often do not strike but suckers are readily transplanted. In situations where suckering is undesirable or where the plant is to be grown in heavier soils, it can be propagated by grafting onto Myoporum rootstock.|$|E
50|$|A {{series of}} wooden dams {{had been built}} at the outlet <b>to</b> <b>Sucker</b> Creek {{beginning}} in 1860 to provide water power; but since winter floods would wash out these dams within a few years, in 1921 a concrete dam was built, which not only provided a more reliable power source, but also allowed the lake level to be precisely controlled. The level was allowed to rise several feet to cover the unsightly stumps left over from logging and create a more visually appealing shoreline.|$|E
50|$|Dwarf {{apples are}} {{mentioned}} during the Song Dynasty in China (11th to 13th centuries) Initial propagation was likely by severing a root and causing it <b>to</b> <b>sucker.</b> The dwarfing clones were propagated in gardens for their novelty and not their efficiency. They were often trained to elaborate shapes such as pyramids, trellises and espaliers.In the mid-1800s, horticulturists began {{referring to the}} rootstocks by name. They were called Paradise (or French Paradise) or Doucin (or English Paradise), with the former being more dwarfing than the latter.|$|E
