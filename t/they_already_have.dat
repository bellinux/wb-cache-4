5|$|By {{utilizing}} {{a place called}} the Bloom Palace, players can perform two kinds of Unity ritual; Carnage Unity and Radiant Unity, to strengthen their party. Carnage Unity uses Performa, which are obtained in battle by defeating monsters and performing crowd-pleasing techniques, to create new weapons for each character. Each weapon carries four skills which a party member can inherit by earning experience in battle. These include Command Skills, which allow the party member to perform various attacks and spells, Passive Skills, which offer passive stat boosts and effects, and Session Skills, which are used to chain together Session Attacks. Each character can only hold six skills of each type, but if they inherit a skill <b>they</b> <b>already</b> <b>have,</b> it is stacked on top and becomes more effective. Radiant Unity uses Performa that is born from within each party member, either through plot progression and clearing side stories; or by increasing a character's Star Ranking in battle to grant them Radiant Skills, permanent skills separate from those inherited from weapons. These include passive effects, such as increased health or extended Session Attacks, as well as skills that can be performed in battle.|$|E

25|$|Gibraltar {{is within}} the EU for some purposes, {{including}} free movement of persons. Since joining the EU, individuals from member states can seek employment and reside in Gibraltar {{without the need for}} a work or residence permit. Non EU citizens need both a work and resident permit, and are only likely to get these if <b>they</b> <b>already</b> <b>have</b> a job offer and their employer satisfies the Government that their skills are unique. However, special arrangements can be made for high-net-worth individuals.|$|E
25|$|Therefore, again, {{winning a}} match will always earn a team more rating points than the rating <b>they</b> <b>already</b> <b>had,</b> and losing a match will always earn a team fewer rating points than the rating <b>they</b> <b>already</b> <b>had.</b> Drawing a match will earn the weaker team more points than the rating <b>they</b> <b>already</b> <b>had,</b> and the {{stronger}} team fewer.|$|R
25|$|As {{this formula}} only applies when {{the gap between}} the ratings of the two teams {{at the start of the}} series was less than 40 points, winning a match will always earn a team more rating points than the rating <b>they</b> <b>already</b> <b>had,</b> and losing a match will always earn a team fewer rating points than the rating <b>they</b> <b>already</b> <b>had.</b> Drawing a match will earn the weaker team more rating points than the rating <b>they</b> <b>already</b> <b>had,</b> and the {{stronger}} team fewer.|$|R

25|$|Sam Trenholme {{suggested}} {{a system of}} progressive odds for Way of the Knight. In {{a long series of}} games of Way of the Knight between two players, each time a player wins a game, he gains a handicap point (or the other player loses a handicap point if <b>they</b> <b>already</b> <b>have</b> one). Each handicap point allows a player to improve any one of his own pieces in the starting position before the game starts. If a player has multiple handicap points, he may repeatedly improve the same piece or improve different pieces. A rook that has been improved may still be castled with.|$|E
25|$|Their {{first stop}} is a French-controlled castle. One of the {{soldiers}} tells the knights that <b>they</b> <b>already</b> <b>have</b> a grail, then taunts them with ridiculous insults. After a failed invasion of the castle, with the French soldiers throwing animals at them, the knights try sneaking into the castle in a Trojan Rabbit, but they forget to hide inside it. The rabbit is catapulted at them and crushes one of the knights' servants. Arthur decides the group should break into smaller groups to seek the Grail. A modern-day historian, describing the Arthurian legends, is abruptly killed by a knight on horseback, triggering a police investigation.|$|E
25|$|Fees will {{be charged}} using the {{existing}} FasTrak transponders used for tolling on the Bay Area bridges, and a network of cameras. Drivers {{will be allowed to}} pay by telephone, text message, online, mail or at designated stores. Among others, the study considered to exempt driver with disabilities, low-income drivers, and residents within the toll zones. Also discounts for commercial fleets were considered. Taxi drivers will be exempted and rental cars would be charged a fleet rate. Carpoolers probably would not get a discount because <b>they</b> <b>already</b> <b>have</b> toll-free pass through the Bay Area bridges. The study made the assumption that tolls at the Bay Area bridges will remain the same.|$|E

25|$|This type {{of therapy}} uses {{a blend of}} cognitive, {{behavioral}} and some humanistic training techniques to target the stressors of the client. This usually is used to help clients better cope with their stress or anxiety after stressful events. This is a three-phase process that trains the client to use skills that <b>they</b> <b>already</b> <b>have</b> to better adapt to their current stressors. The first phase is an interview phase that includes psychological testing, client self-monitoring, {{and a variety of}} reading materials. This allows the therapist to individually tailor the training process to the client. Clients learn how to categorize problems into emotion-focused or problem-focused, so that they can better treat their negative situations. This phase ultimately prepares the client to eventually confront and reflect upon their current reactions to stressors, before looking at ways to change their reactions and emotions in relation to their stressors. The focus is conceptualization.|$|E
25|$|The {{day before}} Reese and Bianca's wedding, Kendall refuses {{to attend the}} ceremony. Zach tries to {{convince}} her to change her mind, saying that she is acting childish, but Kendall explains that he and Bianca betrayed her. Bianca receives word that Kendall will not be coming to her wedding and immediately rushes to Kendall's home to insist she attend. Kendall says that she will only come to the wedding as long as Bianca promises to leave for Paris soon afterward and take Reese and baby Gabrielle with her. Bianca reluctantly agrees. Later that night, Reese and Bianca have a wedding rehearsal. Kendall picks up a wine glass and makes a snarky toast to Reese and Bianca but particularly to Reese. Reese becomes upset; she grabs a bottle of wine, a glass, and walks off. Bianca follows her, but Reese wants to be alone. Zach later finds Reese and consoles her. He pulls her into a hug and then kisses her passionately; Reese kisses back. After a few moments, with Ryan having witnessed their kiss, unknown to them, they agree that the kiss never happened and that <b>they</b> <b>already</b> <b>have</b> people they are deeply in love with. Ryan later confronts Zach about the kiss, but Zach says it was nothing and nonchalantly walks away from Ryan.|$|E
500|$|After Scroggie Creek, {{the trail}} {{switches}} from a westerly direction to almost directly north. At this point, mushers enter the gold-mining district surrounding Dawson City. From the Stewart River adjacent to Scroggie, the trail climbs, crossing the Yukon Territory's Black Hills. Fifty miles (80km) from Dawson City and [...] from Scroggie Creek, it crosses the Indian River, and mushers begin the climb to King Solomon's Dome, {{the highest point}} (...) on the trail. The trail ascends more gradually in the Whitehorse–Fairbanks route than in the opposite direction, where mushers have to endure several switchbacks. When mushers start in Whitehorse, <b>they</b> <b>already</b> <b>have</b> gained several thousand feet from the ascent into the Black Hills, including a climb over 3,550-foot (1,082m) Eureka Dome. The main difficulties come during the descent from King Solomon's Dome to Bonanza Creek, {{the epicenter of the}} Klondike Gold Rush. After reaching the creek, mushers thread through an area of mining waste and follow the Klondike River to Dawson City, the halfway point of the race. They are required to rest for 36hours in Dawson City as a halfway-rest.|$|E

The [...] "great and powerful Oz" [...] is actually Herman Smith, a failed politician from Atlantic City, New Jersey, who was transported to Oz when a balloon he was flying to promote his campaign to become the city dogcatcher was lost in a storm. The Scarecrow, Tin Man, and Lion are distraught that they will never receive their respective brain, heart, and courage, but Dorothy makes them realize that <b>they</b> <b>already</b> <b>have</b> had these things all along. Just as it seems as if she {{will never be able to}} get home, Glinda, the Good Witch of the South, appears and implores her to find her way home by searching within and using the magic of the silver slippers by clicking the heels together three times. After thanking Glinda and saying goodbye to her friends, she takes clicks her heels together three times. She is then back near home with Toto in her arms and walks into the apartment.|$|E

2500|$|Insolvent {{companies}}: Banks lent {{to companies}} and individuals that invested in real estate. When {{real estate values}} dropped, many loans went unpaid. The banks could try to collect on the collateral (land), but due to reduced real estate values, this would not pay off the loan. Banks have delayed the decision to collect on the collateral, hoping asset prices would improve. These delays were allowed by national banking regulators. Some banks make even more loans to these companies {{that are used to}} service the debt <b>they</b> <b>already</b> <b>have.</b> This continuing process is known as maintaining an [...] "unrealized loss", and until the assets are completely revalued and/or sold off (and the loss realized), it {{will continue to be a}} deflationary force in the economy.|$|E
2500|$|The {{union of}} two {{disjoint}} well-ordered sets S and T can be well-ordered. [...] The order-type of that union is the ordinal which results from adding the order-types of S and T. [...] If two well-ordered sets are not already disjoint, {{then they can}} be replaced by order-isomorphic disjoint sets, e.g. replace S by {0} × S and T by {1} × T. [...] This way, the well-ordered set S is written [...] "to the left" [...] of the well-ordered set T, meaning one defines an order on S [...] T in which every element of S is smaller than every element of T. The sets S and T themselves keep the ordering <b>they</b> <b>already</b> <b>have.</b> This addition of the order-types is associative and generalizes the addition of natural numbers.|$|E

2500|$|Although this {{profession}} {{is seen as}} a frivolous one, nat-kadaws are in fact very religious. They still follow and uphold the precepts of Buddhism (Five Precepts), while simultaneously interacting closely with these nats. [...] Oftentimes [...] a nat-kadaw can become tormented by a specific nat. Even if <b>they</b> <b>already</b> <b>have</b> a human husband or wife, they decide that they must marry this nat, for only then will they be at peace, and the torment that this nat is causing them will finally cease. The marriage of a nat and a nat-kadaw is done through an extremely elaborate ceremony titled Ley-Bya-Taik. In this ceremony, the nat-kadaw identifies the particular nat {{that they would like to}} marry, and then surrenders to it. In this process mirrors are used to trap the soul (mentioned earlier) that leaves the host. Once this soul has left, the nat takes the place of it. After this transformation is complete, the nat-kadaw dances, embracing their recent marriage with a nat.|$|E
2500|$|For each individual, the {{experience}} of discovering and knowing their genetic make-up will be different.

[...] Though this information maybe painful, it will give them the opportunity to prevent or delay the on-set of that disease through: increased education of the disease, making lifestyle changes, finding preventive therapies or identifying environmental triggers of the disease.

2500|$|The site {{chosen by}} Mrs Rylands {{was in a}} central and fashionable part of the city, but was awkward in shape and {{orientation}} and surrounded by tall warehouses, derelict cottages and narrow streets. The position was criticised for its lack of surrounding space {{and the fact that}} the valuable manuscript collections were to be housed in [...] "that dirty, uncomfortable city... not enough light to read by, and the books <b>they</b> <b>already</b> <b>have</b> are wretchedly kept" [...] (written in 1901 about the Crawford MSS.) [...] Mrs Rylands negotiated Deeds of Agreement with her neighbours to fix the heights of future adjacent buildings. The permissible height of the building was fixed at just over 34 feet, but it was suggested that it could be taller at the centre if there was an open area around the edges, at the height of buildings that had been demolished to make way for the construction. Champneys incorporated this suggestion into his design, setting the two towers of the facade twelve feet back from the boundary and keeping the entrance block low, to allow light into the library. He designed the building in a series of tiered steps with an almost flat roof to give a 'liberal concession' to the neighbours' 'right to light'.|$|E
