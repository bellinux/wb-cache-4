50|$|In 1904, P&LE {{built the}} O'Donovan Bridge for easier {{automobile}} access from Island Avenue <b>to</b> <b>The</b> <b>Bottoms</b> without crossing <b>the</b> railroad tracks. This was replaced in 1931 by the McKees Rocks Bridge, which extended to Ohio River Blvd. but still provided access <b>to</b> <b>The</b> <b>Bottoms</b> via Helen Street exit.|$|R

The ditch washed out in a flood. During the 1920s, various plans were put forth <b>to</b> drain <b>the</b> <b>Bottoms</b> and convert it to farmland. However, residents downstream in Hutchinson, Kansas protested that doing so would create flooding problems for them.|$|R

5|$|A {{downline}} {{used for}} open ocean diving {{is much the}} same as a shotline, but does not reach all the way <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom.</b> An open-ocean downline is weighted at the bottom, and attached to a substantial float at the surface, which may be tethered to the boat. It may be marked at intervals by knots or loops, and may be attached to decompression trapeze system. In some cases a sea anchor may be used to limit wind drift, particularly if attached to a boat with significant windage.|$|E
5|$|A {{new stage}} {{adaptation}} of the show debuted in 2003. Based on Clarke's novel The Moonbather, the play was first performed by the Scunthorpe Little Theatre Club from 7 to 11 October 2003. Using new actors to perform the roles of Compo, Clegg, and Foggy, the play featured the trio as they attempted to get <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> of the disturbance created by a near-naked man in the town. The play was later performed in Eastbourne by Eastbourne Theatres from 15 July 2009 to 8 August 2009 before touring the country through November 2009.|$|E

5|$|Because {{most of the}} {{pipeline}} was built above permafrost, each of the pipes holding up the raised sections of pipeline contained a sealed tube of ammonia.

The ammonia is cooled by the outside air, condenses, and falls back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> of the tube, where the process repeats.|$|E
5|$|Cadet George Washington Street, of Wisconsin, was {{identified}} as the first person ever to score a touchdown for the Naval Academy. The Baltimore Sun stated that William Abrose O'Malley, of Pennsylvania, was the cadet who caught Street's blocked kick and scored the second touchdown. The Sun also covered, in detail, the uniforms the squads wore; Johns Hopkins sported blue, black, and white striped uniforms, while the Naval Academy wore maroon and white uniforms. Both teams also nailed strips of leather <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> of their shoes to help deal with slipping.|$|E

5|$|Contrasting {{with the}} company's usual method for {{designing}} motherboards, the first components that Asus {{placed on the}} device's PCB were the speakers. This was done to ensure the other components did not force speaker placement towards one side, which would harm sound quality. The design saw the implementation of two microphones to ensure the user's hand placement on the device would not muffle sound during videoconferencing, while the headphone jack was moved <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> of the device, preventing the headphone wire from draping across the screen.|$|E

In the pocket were the rules, implements, and teetotum. Its teetotum was an ivory dowel sharpened to a point at the bottom end inserted in an octagonal ivory plate.

U-66 was the first (and ultimately only) U-boat command for the 31-year-old Muhle, {{who had been a}} classmate of von Bothmer when both had joined the Kaiserliche Marine in April 1902. On 9 July, U-66 sank her first ship under her new commander, when she sent the Spanish steamer Iparraguirre <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bottom.</b> The 1,161-ton steamer was headed to Santander from Piteå and Bergen with a cargo of pitwood, when U-66 attacked her west of the Orkney Islands.|$|E
