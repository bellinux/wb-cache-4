As of October 2010, the westbound transit traffic approaching the Ivanja Reka interchange must exit the <b>tolled</b> <b>motorway</b> network, since the existing Zagreb bypass is not tolled, and then re-enter another <b>tolled</b> <b>motorway.</b> There are plans for the outer Zagreb bypass to {{be integrated into the}} <b>tolled</b> <b>motorway</b> network as the ultimate solution for congestion at the Ivanja Reka toll plaza.

25|$|In 1995, {{motorway}} development again {{threatened the}} route, when {{plans for the}} proposed widening of the M6 motorway made no provision for the canal where the two crossed. The Trust had produced several papers which had been submitted to the planning enquiry for the road. The Trust continued {{to negotiate with the}} agencies involved {{in the construction of the}} M6 <b>Toll</b> <b>motorway,</b> even though the cost of providing navigable culverts was likely to be between £2M and £3M, but when agreement was finally reached, the Trust raised £150,000 to pay for a culvert under the A5/A34 roundabout, and the main culvert under the motorway was funded by the government.|$|E
25|$|The idea of {{restoring}} the canal was first developed in 1975, {{as a result}} of legislation requiring planning authorities to produce county structure plans. The West Midlands structure plan included the concept of the restored canal as a linear park, and included a bypass to avoid the section destroyed by opencast mining. Further threats to the route from the proposed Birmingham Northern Relief Road {{led to the formation of}} the Ogley and Hatherton Restoration Society in 1989, after the Inland Waterways Association held a rally at Pelsall to highlight the plight of the canal. The Society later became the Lichfield and Hatherton Canals Restoration Trust, while the relief road became the M6 <b>Toll</b> <b>motorway.</b>|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} the elasticities {{of demand}} in <b>tolled</b> <b>motorways</b> in Spain {{with respect to}} the main variables influencing it. The demand equation is estimated using a panel data set where the cross-section observations correspond to the different Spanish <b>tolled</b> <b>motorways</b> sections, and the temporal dimension ranges {{from the beginning of the}} eighties until the end of the nineties. The results show a high elasticity {{with respect to the}} economic activity level. The average elasticity with respect to petrol price falls around - 0. 3, while toll elasticities clearly vary across motorway sections. These motorway sections are classified into four groups according to the estimated toll elasticity with values that range from - 0. 21 for the most inelastic to - 0. 83 for the most elastic. The main factors that explain such differences are the quality of the alternative road and the length of the section. The long-term effect is about 50 per cent higher than the short term one; however, the period of adjustment is relatively short.

2500|$|The M6 Toll, Britain's first <b>toll</b> <b>motorway,</b> which {{bypasses}} the West Midlands conurbation to {{the east}} and north of Birmingham and Walsall and was built to alleviate congestion through the West Midlands, and opened in December 2003. Before the opening of the <b>toll</b> <b>motorway,</b> this section of the M6 carried 180,000 vehicles per day at its busiest point near Wolverhampton (between the junctions with the M54 and M5 motorways), compared with a design capacity of only 72,000 vehicles. Usage, at about 50,000 vehicles, was lower than expected and traffic levels on the M6 were only slightly reduced as a result. The high toll prices, which were set by the operating company and over which the UK government has no influence until 2054, were blamed for the low usage. Much traffic continues to use the M6 or the continued on the M1 and took the A50 or A52. [...] the road between Junctions 3A and 11A now carries 120,000 motor vehicles every day.|$|E

5|$|Summertime {{and holiday}} queues at Lučko {{mainline}} toll plaza can be considerable, a problem exacerbated during the usual weekend-to-weekend tourist stays at Croatia's coastal resorts. In 2009, {{in an effort}} to address the problem, the Lučko mainline toll plaza was expanded to 15lanes, and a single additional 10-lane toll plaza was built for fast cashless toll collection in Demerje. The Demerje toll plaza is available via a motorway fork accessible to the A1 northbound traffic only. Vehicles using the Demerje toll plaza default to the original motorway route immediately past the Lučko mainline toll plaza, between the plaza and the Lučko interchange. The faster cashless system has raised the nominal capacity of the road from 2,325 to 11,150 vehicles per hour.

Environmental concerns led to a second feasibility study being produced by Atkins in 2009, for a route which connected to the derelict Lord Hayes Branch on the Wyrley and Essington Canal. A short section near the junction with the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal is navigable, and the cost of restoring the rest and building the new route to the Wyrley and Essington was estimated at £44.1million in 2009.|$|E

30|$|European {{governments are}} {{increasingly}} committed to road safety, {{due to the}} impact of road accidents in terms of economic loss and as a public health threat. In addition to regulation, providing better road infrastructure is an essential strategy to promote road safety. This paper investigates the relationships between different types of road quality and their impact on national safety outcomes using an international (European) panel data. Since European countries have different motorway network funding strategies—free motorways funded by the budget and <b>tolled</b> <b>motorways</b> funded by users—we pay special attention to the type of funding chosen and consider whether it has any consequences for safety. Our results suggest that extending the motorway network is associated with a reduction in fatality rates, while the rest of road types {{do not have the same}} positive effects. However, this virtue is only statistically significant for free motorways; <b>tolled</b> <b>motorways</b> do not provide any significant impact, probably due to socially inefficient pricing and investment policies currently in force.|$|R
