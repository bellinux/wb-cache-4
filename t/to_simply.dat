5|$|A {{conceptual}} design for another lake lander was proposed in late 2012 by the Spanish-based private engineering firm SENER and the Centro de Astrobiología in Madrid. The concept probe is called Titan Lake In-situ Sampling Propelled Explorer (TALISE). The major difference {{compared to the}} TiME probe would be that TALISE is envisioned with its own propulsion system and would therefore not be limited <b>to</b> <b>simply</b> drifting on the lake when it splashes down.|$|E

5|$|In April, Austrian forces {{approached}} Mantua {{and started}} their siege. At first, the Austrians were content <b>to</b> <b>simply</b> blockade the fortress, {{but with the}} artillery duels and occasional skirmishes, attrition began taking its toll on the defenders. The defenders were also weakened by diminishing food supplies, and their morale was undermined by lack of payment.|$|E

While his prosthetic makeup was being applied, Giamatti watched episodes of Ultraman and various Japanese Godzilla films.|$|E

5|$|The Emmy Award, often {{referred}} <b>to</b> <b>simply</b> as the Emmy, recognizes excellence {{in the television}} industry, and corresponds to the Academy Award (for film), the Tony Award (for theatre), and the Grammy Award (for music).

Gaga has been nominated three times.|$|E
5|$|The Los Angeles Daily News (originally the Los Angeles Illustrated Daily News), often {{referred}} <b>to</b> <b>simply</b> as the Daily News, was a newspaper published from 1923 to 1954.

5|$|The Virginia Argus and Hampshire Advertiser, often {{referred}} <b>to</b> <b>simply</b> as the Virginia Argus, was a weekly newspaper published between July 1850 and August 1861 in Romney, Virginia (now West Virginia). The paper's circulation of 800 copies was the second-highest in Hampshire County, after the South Branch Intelligencers. The Virginia Argus ceased publication following its closure by the Union Army during the American Civil War, after {{which it was}} not revived.|$|E

5|$|The {{remaining}} men aged 16 – 60 {{were immediately}} {{incorporated into the}} Volkssturm. However, some Volkssturm members, without basic military knowledge and training, escaped into the woods, hoping <b>to</b> <b>simply</b> survive. Refugee trains leaving East Prussia were also extremely crowded, and due to the very low temperatures, children often froze to death during the journey. The last refugee train left Königsberg on January 22, 1945.|$|E
5|$|The second {{characteristic}} {{was that}} Accum did not limit his campaign <b>to</b> <b>simply</b> exposing problems. At {{the end of}} every chapter, he included names of merchants of who had in years prior to 1820 been caught adulterating foodstuffs. In this way, Accum tried to deprive them of business and thereby had an effect on the London economy.|$|E
5|$|After the {{completion}} of his doctorate, Tsakalotos entered into an academic career. His first role was as a {{research associate at the}} University of Kent, from 1989 to 1990. From October 1990 to June 1993, he taught at the university as a lecturer. In 1993, Tsakalotos and his wife moved to Greece, and in October 1994 he began teaching at the Athens University of Economics and Business. In September 2010, he became a full professor of economics at the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, more commonly referred <b>to</b> <b>simply</b> as the University of Athens.|$|E

5|$|Alzheimer's disease (AD), also {{referred}} <b>to</b> <b>simply</b> as Alzheimer's, is a chronic neurodegenerative disease that usually starts slowly and worsens over time. It {{is the cause}} of 60% to 70% of cases of dementia. The most common early symptom is difficulty in remembering recent events (short-term memory loss). As the disease advances, symptoms can include problems with language, disorientation (including easily getting lost), mood swings, loss of motivation, not managing self care, and behavioural issues. As a person's condition declines, they often withdraw from family and society. Gradually, bodily functions are lost, ultimately leading to death. Although the speed of progression can vary, the average life expectancy following diagnosis is three to nine years.|$|E
5|$|Ambulance Driver – Some {{services}} employ {{staff with}} no medical qualification (or just a first aid certificate) {{whose job is}} <b>to</b> <b>simply</b> drive the patients from place to place. In some emergency ambulance contexts this term is a pejorative toward qualified providers implying that they perform no function but driving, {{although it may be}} acceptable for patient transport or community operations. In some areas, these drivers would survey and study the local network of routes for better performance of service, as some road routes may be blocked, and the driver must know another route to the patient or to the hospital. The driver would gather the local weather and traffic status reports before and in-between emergencies. They may also have training in using the radio and knowing where medical supplies are stored in the ambulance.|$|E
5|$|Anderson's efforts helped spark renewed {{interest}} in the trail, and Avery (who led the charge after Perkins’ death in 1932) {{was able to bring}} other states on board. Upon taking over the ATC, Avery adopted the more practical goal of building a simple hiking trail. He and MacKaye clashed over the ATC's response to a major commercial development along the trail's path; MacKaye left the organization, while Avery was willing <b>to</b> <b>simply</b> reroute the trail. Avery reigned as Chairman of the ATC from 1932 to 1952 (he died that same year).|$|E

5|$|Another {{meeting on}} the issue was called on 6 December 1966, {{attended}} by Johnson, McNamara, the deputy Secretary of Defense Cyrus Vance, Walt Rostow of the National Security Agency (NSA) and the Joint Chiefs. Rostow took {{the side of the}} JCS and it appeared that development would start. However, McNamara once again outlined the problems and stated that the simplest way to close the ABM gap was <b>to</b> <b>simply</b> build more ICBMs, rendering the Soviet system impotent and a great waste of money. He then proposed that the money sidelined by Congress for deployment be used for initial deployment studies while the US attempted to negotiate an arms limitation treaty. Johnson agreed with this compromise, and ordered Secretary of State Dean Rusk to open negotiations with the Soviets.|$|E
5|$|E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (also {{referred}} <b>to</b> <b>simply</b> as E.T.) is a 1982 adventure {{video game}} developed {{and published by}} Atari, Inc. for the Atari 2600 video game console. It {{is based on the}} film of the same name, and was designed by Howard Scott Warshaw. The objective of the game is to guide the eponymous character through various screens in a cubic world to collect three pieces of an interplanetary telephone that will allow him to contact his home planet.|$|E
5|$|For finite-dimensional representations, the {{presence}} of semisimplicity means that the Lorentz group {{can be dealt with}} the same way as other semisimple groups using a well-developed theory. In addition, all representations are built from the irreducible ones, since the Lie algebra possesses the complete reducibility property. But, the non-compactness of the Lorentz group, in combination with lack of simple connectedness, cannot be dealt with in all the aspects as in the simple framework that applies <b>to</b> <b>simply</b> connected, compact groups. Non-compactness implies, for a connected simple Lie group, that no nontrivial finite-dimensional unitary representations exist. Lack of simple connectedness gives rise to spin representations of the group. The non-connectedness means that, for representations of the full Lorentz group, time reversal and space inversion has to dealt with separately.|$|E
