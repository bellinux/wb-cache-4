40|$|One of {{the many}} {{challenges}} faced in developing world {{is the issue of}} waste management. Organic fibres forms major percentage of waste produced from agricultural products and should be of great concern. Fibres have been used to reinforce composites concrete to obtain lighter weight, reduce shrinkage effects which serve to reduce environmental waste. Natural fibre is 100 % bio-degradable and recyclable, thereby eliminate pollution, promote biodiversity and conservation of natural resources and thus environmentally friendly. This paper focuses on utilization of some fibres as solid wastes for making economically-friendly and affordable green environment. Three fibres: Jute, Oil palm and Polypropylene fibres were used as complement in concrete and its suitability, durability and influence on the properties of concrete were assessed. The percentages of fibre used were 0. 25 and 0. 5 of cement content by weight. A total of 84 concrete cube specimens were prepared for standard tests which include compression test, slump test and compaction factor test. The compression test was carried out at concrete ages of 7, 14, 21 and 28 days. As the percentage of the fibre increases, the tendency for fibre <b>to</b> <b>ball</b> <b>up</b> becomes higher in water. The test results showed that for Jute and Oil palm fibres, the optimum fibre content was 0. 25 % and for Polypropylene fibre, the optimum fibre content was 0. 5 %. They all yielded increase in strength whe...|$|E
40|$|Transport of a {{water droplet}} on a solid surface can be {{achieved}} by differentially modifying the contact angles at either side of the droplet using capacitive charging of the solid-liquid interface (i. e., electrowetting-on-dielectric) to create a driving force. Improved droplet mobility {{can be achieved by}} modifying the surface topography to enhance the effects of a hydrophobic surface chemistry and so achieve an almost complete roll-up into a superhydrophobic droplet where the contact angle is greater than 150 degrees. When electrowetting is attempted on such a surface, an electrocapillary pressure arises which causes water penetration into the surface features and an irreversible conversion to a state in which the droplet loses its mobility. Irreversibility occurs because the surface tension of the liquid does not allow the liquid to retract from these fixed surface features on removal of the actuating voltage. In this work, we show that this irreversibility can be overcome by attaching the solid surface features to the liquid surface to create a liquid marble. The solid topographic surface features then become a conformable "skin" on the water droplet both enabling it to become highly mobile and providing a reversible liquid marble-on-solid system for electrowetting. In our system, hydrophobic silica particles and hydrophobic grains of lycopodium are used as the skin. In the region corresponding to the solid-marble contact area, the liquid marble {{can be viewed as a}} liquid droplet resting on the attached solid grains (or particles) in a manner similar to a superhydrophobic droplet resting upon posts fixed on a solid substrate. When a marble is placed on a flat solid surface and electrowetting performed it spreads but with the water remaining effectively suspended on the grains as it would if the system were a droplet of water on a surface consisting of solid posts. When the electrowetting voltage is removed, the surface tension of the water droplet causes it <b>to</b> <b>ball</b> <b>up</b> from the surface but carrying with it the conformable skin. A theoretical basis for this electrowetting of a liquid marble is developed using a surface free energy approach...|$|E
