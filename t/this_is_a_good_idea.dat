To be sure, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea,</b> and others notice it. They {{naturally}} imitate Galt-Magnon, and they start building their own cabins. But {{the first man to}} invent a house, according to IP advocates, would have a right to prevent others from building houses on their own land, with their own logs, or to charge them a fee if they do build houses. It is plain that the innovator in these examples becomes a partial owner of the tangible property (e.g., land and logs) of others, due not to first occupation and use of that property (for it is already owned), but due to his coming up with an idea. Clearly, this rule {{flies in the face of}} the first-user homesteading rule, arbitrarily and groundlessly overriding the very homesteading rule that is at the foundation of all property rights.|$|E

50|$|The unicity {{distance}} {{can be increased}} by reducing the plaintext redundancy. One {{way to do this}} is to deploy data compression techniques prior to encryption, for example by removing redundant vowels while retaining readability. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> anyway, as it reduces the amount of data to be encrypted.|$|E
5000|$|Many {{people play}} this game as Splat! In this version, the {{imaginary}} guns are replaced by imaginary custard pies. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> when playing with younger children or in an area {{with a high level}} of or sensitivity to gun crime. Players must yell [...] "Splat!" [...] instead of [...] "Bang!" [...] - otherwise the rules are identical.|$|E
50|$|Y {{turns out}} to be an abelian group, and if X and Y are {{reasonable}} spaces this group is finitely generated. To figure out what this group is, we first isolate a prime p. In an attempt to compute the p-torsion of Y, we look at cohomology: send Y to Hom(H*(Y), H*(X)). <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> because cohomology groups are usually tractable to compute.|$|E

SF writer C. J.

50|$|The game {{is aimed}} towards young {{children}} and has three different modes: Birthday Adventures, Junior Mode and Multiplayer Games. Birthday Adventures is basically Story Mode. While Christopher Robin and Winnie the Pooh take an adventure in the woods, Pooh starts to feel hungry. Christopher Robin tells Pooh to recall happy memories. Pooh thinks that <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> and he therefore does so. Junior Mode is for even younger children and there's no objectives to do, and Multiplayer Games allows you to play some minigames.|$|E
50|$|During another visit, Robert tells Tom and Lola {{that he is}} {{originally}} from Izouard, a small skiing village in the French Alps and shows them plans for escaping the hospital in order to return home. Tom and Lola agree <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> and all three plan to escape the next night. However, when they arrive at his room the following night, Robert has already left and (they later discover) has come to grief while climbing over the hospital wall. Undeterred, Tom and Lola decide to escape anyway, having secured the address of Hélene.|$|E

5000|$|Before {{the trial}} begins, Stephanie returns to Lydie {{and says she}} is going to accept a plea bargain. Lydie states that she thinks <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> and reaches out to shake Stephanie's hand when she notices the cut and asks what happened. Stephanie then tearfully admits the truth to Lydie, that her baby girl was alive when she {{delivered}} her, but was so small, and [...] "her breathing was all wrong", and so in her mind she told her child to die, and she did. Stephanie believes she did kill her baby with her mind. Lydie hugs Stephanie, then thanks her.|$|E
50|$|After a few days, it is {{beginning}} to take its toll on the platoon, especially Pike, who has a nightmare about marching in bare feet, which were all swollen and blistered. The next morning, Mrs Pike confronts Wilson in Mainwaring's office about Pike's feet, and asks him to ask Mainwaring to not let Pike go on any more marches. After she storms off, Pike tells Wilson his plan to avoid a twenty-mile march on Saturday: swap Mainwaring's boots over for a half a size smaller. Wilson thinks <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea,</b> not realising {{that the rest of}} Jones' section have had the same idea.|$|E
50|$|The {{following}} parade, {{the platoon}} meet up to discuss tactics. However, the Verger is snooping around, taking notes {{to deliver to}} Captain Square because he is fed up {{of the way the}} Walmington platoon treat him. The Eastgate platoon will be defending a windmill, and the platoon {{have to find a way}} of planting a dummy bomb in the windmill without being spotted. Jones suggests a tunnel, but that is soon cast aside. Wilson suggests an idea from a Shakespeare play he once saw, where the king dressed his troops up in bushes so they could attack the offending castle. Mainwaring thinks <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea.</b>|$|E

In the background, temples, villas, and palaces Olympia is receiving tribute from visiting monarchs and dignitaries in her palace. Hélios and Lilia, two Christians, are dragged in by a mob demanding they be put to death. The proconsul Nicanor, Olympia's brother, thinks <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea,</b> but Olympia, much struck by Hélios' good looks, declines {{to do so and}} sends everyone else away. Alone with Hélios, she gives him a magic potion and seduces him. An earthquake shakes the ground and the prophet Magnus appears, warning of a forthcoming catastrophe.|$|E
50|$|At the Gordon Inn in Lenox, Massachusetts, bestselling author Robert Street is {{very popular}} and has an ego to match, pretending that {{writing a book about}} flying makes one a pilot; he has never been in a plane. His agent thinks {{it would be a great}} idea for him to go up in an {{airplane}} as a publicity stunt. His girlfriend Grace, whose parents would rather see her marry French flying ace Jules Gaillard, also thinks <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea,</b> as it would impress her father. Jules thinks so too: he challenges Robert to an air race! A mechanician, Sam Robinson, is sent for; but when he arrives, he is too stout to go up in the airplane, so Robert goes alone. The flight is successful: Robert wins the race and lands in one piece. He happily marries Grace.|$|E
5000|$|The next scene shows Professor Ross Collins, Head of Humanities Burton Strauss, and Dean Catherine Kenny {{waiting to}} have a meeting with Sarah. When Sarah comes in, she tells them that {{freshman}} Simon Brick, {{one of the few}} African-American students, has started receiving hateful, racist notes. The all-white administration scrambles to contain the problem and reassure parents that everything is under control. Strauss proposes scheduling a meeting to discuss racism. Ross and Kenny agree that <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea.</b> However, Sarah wants to talk to Simon before holding a campus-wide meeting. She suspects that he would be embarrassed if other students knew about the notes. Two weeks later, senior Greg Sullivan comes to Sarah's office. He has been inspired by the race forum and asks her about forming a student group called [...] "Students for Tolerance". Sarah thinks this is a great idea.|$|E

50|$|At the Suarez home, Hilda cuts her father’s hair as Justin {{stresses}} over {{a blizzard}} approaching {{the city that}} could threaten him getting to see Hairspray tonight. Ignacio tells Hilda that he doesn’t know if <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> (inviting Santos without telling him {{that they are going}} to a musical). Hilda says that he is the one that wants to spend to more time with his son. Later that evening, as Santos, Justin and Hilda hop on the subway to go to the show, Justin stresses even more when suddenly the power starts flickering and tells Hilda that he is mostly upset because his father is going to miss that wonderful experience. So Justin stands up, takes off his coat and puts on his own version of the 2003 Tony Award winner. All eyes in the subway car are on Justin until a man tells him that they have seen enough, which prompts Santos to stand up and tells him that he is going to let his son finish and that he had better clap when it is over.|$|E
50|$|Some libertarian {{critics of}} {{intellectual}} property have argued that allowing property rights in ideas and information creates artificial scarcity and infringes {{on the right to}} own tangible property. Stephan Kinsella uses the following scenario to argue this point:Imagine the time when men lived in caves. One bright guy—let's call him Galt-Magnon—decides to build a log cabin on an open field, near his crops. To be sure, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea,</b> and others notice it. They naturally imitate Galt-Magnon, and they start building their own cabins.

5000|$|According to the European Commission {{proposal}} {{the introduction}} of eurobonds would create new means through which governments finance their debt, by offering safe and liquid investment opportunities. This [...] "could potentially quickly alleviate the current sovereign debt crisis, as the high-yield Member States could benefit from the stronger creditworthiness of the low-yield Member States." [...] The effect would be immediate even if {{the introduction of}} eurobonds takes some time, since changed market expectations adapt instantly, resulting in lower average and marginal funding costs, particularly to those EU member states most hit by the financial crisis. The Commission also believes that eurobonds could make the eurozone financial system more resilient to future adverse shocks and reinforce financial stability. Furthermore, they could reduce the vulnerability of banks in the eurozone to deteriorating credit ratings of individual member states by providing them with a source of more robust collateral. Setting a euro-area wide integrated bond market would offer a safe and liquid investment opportunity for savers and financial institutions that matches its US$ counterpart in terms of size and liquidity, which would also strengthen {{the position of the}} euro as an international reserve currency and foster a more balanced global financial system. On the other hand, the governments of those states that most people would like to take over those debt risks do not think that <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> and see other effects. They do not understand why it should help a group of states that have excessively borrowed and circumvented the EU contracts for many years should now be helped by making it even easier for them to borrow even more via Eurobonds. Germany is one of those sceptical states, together with Austria, Finland and the Netherlands.|$|E
