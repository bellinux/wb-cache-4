[...] In 1970, Joe Walsh adapted the slide-guitar section of [...] "Beck's Bolero" [...] for a James Gang song.

Crewe manager Dario Gradi said: [...] "He <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>he</b> was going to retire because he didn't want to sit on the bench all season—or drop down the divisions." [...] His retirement lasted seven months while he worked for his father's company until he joined Rotherham United in March 2006 following three reserve games.

[...] Despite Yost's hopes, Maulbetsch fell far short of the prior year's performance in 1915. [...] He was several pounds lighter after the illness and surgery, and it was noted that [...] "a few pounds means much to a man of Maulbetsch's weight." [...] In the opening game against Lawrence, Maulbetsch scored three touchdowns, but he was [...] "woefully weak on interference." [...] Playing against Mount Union, Maulbetsch made several big gains, including a 50-yard touchdown run in the third quarter. [...] His difficulties returned in the season's third game against Marietta, as [...] "Maulbetsch was powerless to stop the Marietta forward pass, all of the successful ones being directed toward his side of the line." ...|$|E
500|$|On March 10, 2014, {{a lawsuit}} against Zayat was filed in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. The plaintiff, Howard Rubinsky, was an {{associate}} of the Jelinskys who had also pleaded guilty in the illegal betting operation. His suit alleged breach of contract, claiming that Zayat failed to pay off a $1.65 million line of credit in 2004. Rubinsky said he extended credit to Zayat with Tradewinds Sportsbook so Zayat could bet on horse races via a gambling website set up in Costa Rica. Zayat's lawyer described the suit as [...] "a meritless claim", filed a motion to dismiss in 2015 alleging lack of evidence, and argued that {{the statute of limitations}} of six years had run. Zayat stated in court documents that he had met and loaned money to Rubinsky, but said, [...] "I can say unequivocally that I did not give Mr. Rubinsky any money as payment on any debt ... I agreed to give him money because he <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>he</b> was ill and broke." [...] On June 4, 2015, a federal judge in Newark, New Jersey, dismissed Rubinsky's lawsuit, citing both Rubinsky's difficulty in proving his case and the expired statute of limitations. In a related matter, June 1, 2015, days before American Pharoah was to run in the 2015 Belmont Stakes, the New York Times reported that Rubinsky's lawyer, Joseph Bainton, filed a $10-million libel suit against Zayat for comments to the press, including the characterization of Rubinsky's other lawsuit as [...] "extortion, a fraud and blackmail." [...] That suit was dismissed on August 5, 2015.|$|E
