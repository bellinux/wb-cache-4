500|$|Laming's {{appointment}} was controversial {{as he had}} been director of Hertfordshire county council's social services department in 1990, a department which was strongly criticised for its handling of a child abuse case, and which had the Local Government Ombudsman making a finding of 'maladministration with injustice' against them in 1995. The father of the child in the case said of Laming's appointment, [...] "I don't see how he has the qualifications or experience to be able to lead an investigation into another borough which has been failing to protect a child in exactly the same manner that his own authority failed to protect a child in 1990". Liberal Democrat spokesman Paul Burstow said, [...] "the findings of the ombudsman in the Hertfordshire case must give rise to questions about Lord Laming's appointment to head this inquiry"; and Conservative Party spokesman Liam Fox said, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> maybe should have thought twice about this and maybe, even yet, they will think again". The Department for Health, however, said that they were [...] "fully confident that he is the right person to conduct the inquiry".|$|E

My position for many years has been that just as a motorist must have a license, a gun owner should be required to have one as well.

2500|$|Paul {{does not}} believe the World Trade Center and Pentagon attacks were a {{government}} conspiracy and has explicitly denied being a 9/11 [...] "truther", arguing {{that the issue is}} not a conspiracy but a failure of bureaucracy. He believes the 9/11 Commission Report's main goal was [...] "to protect the government and to protect their ineptness—not [...] to do this so they can use this as an excuse to spread the war [...] Some who did want to spread the war would use it as an opportunity. But, it wasn't something that was deliberately done." [...] He does not <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> would have staged such an attack. When asked whether [...] "9/11 was orchestrated by the government", Paul responded, [...] "Absolutely not." [...] Paul has stated that he is concerned that someone might create a [...] "contrived Gulf of Tonkin-type incident" [...] to justify the invasion of Iran or suspend the democratic process, adding, [...] "Let's hope I'm wrong about this one." ...|$|E
2500|$|Some FEE-based {{analyses}} {{suggest that}} the famine {{was a result of}} policy failure or bungling. Others assert that prioritised distribution and the denial policies reflected the War Cabinet's callous willingness to [...] "supply the Army's needs and let the Indian people starve if necessary" [...] when weighing how to allocate wartime resources. In this view, economic policies were designed to serve externally oriented British military goals at the expense of internally oriented Indian interests, and so the UK government bears moral responsibility for the rural deaths. [...] The policies may have met their intended goals, but only at the cost of harrowing, large-scale dislocations in the domestic economy. Far from being accidental, this argument maintains, these dislocations were fully recognised beforehand as fatal for identifiable Indian groups whose economic activities did not directly, actively, or adequately advance military goals. The analysts split into two broad camps: those who <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> unwittingly caused or was unable to respond to the crisis, and those who think it willfully ignored the plight of starving Indians. The former see the problem as a series of avoidable war-time policy failures and [...] "panicky responses" [...] from a government that was spectacularly inept, overwhelmed and in disarray, the latter as a conscious miscarriage of justice by the [...] "ruling colonial elite" [...] who abandoned the poor of Bengal.|$|E

2500|$|In a video titled [...] "Global Warming Unmasked: The Hidden Agenda", Voris {{claimed that}} [...] "Catholic leaders must {{recognize}} global warming {{for what it}} is. It is a government power grab via population reduction. It is a pseudoscience and hyper-sensationalism. These things {{are being used to}} promote the global warming agenda, just {{as they were in the}} early 20th century eugenics movement... In fact, global warming is the evolution, the natural evolution, of that early eugenics program." [...] Voris said, [...] "Hitler adopted the American eugenic ideals and implemented them throughout his Nazi regime. Hitler did not originate the idea of eugenics and creating a superior Aryan race. It was indeed an American concept. He saw this happening in America, and went 'Ah-ha' and grabbed it and incorporated it into his whole Nazi philosophy." [...] Voris held that governments accepting the concept of global warming might limit availability of energy, cutting off those who [...] "exceed what Washington says is your limit [...] you can either be charged an exorbitant fine or perhaps have your energy supply limited or even cut off. ...If you <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> interfering in private lives to this extent based on junk science and the hysteria surrounding it just isn't possible... think back to the tens of thousands of citizens who were sterilized against their will by the government in state after state after state. ...And remember the only thing that brought the eugenics movement to an end was the horror of the Nazi death camps. If that had not happened, sterilization would just be a normal thing. It was so revolting that finally people said, 'this whole theory is wrong.' Government leaders were quite happy to just roll along exercising power without limit over their citizens." ...|$|E
2500|$|Wade Vroom, an [...] "occasional teacher" [...] at Delta {{alternative}} school, [...] "pinned up brochures {{meant to}} advise gay bar and bath house patrons on safe sex procedures" [...] in a grade seven and eight classroom. Liz Sandals, the minister for education, {{stated that it}} was [...] "totally inappropriate." [...] Sandals also stated, [...] "clearly, from what was described in the media, the materials that were being used are totally inappropriate and are in no way connected to the Ontario health and phys ed curriculum" [...] and [...] "I’m relieved that Toronto District School Board (TDSB) has gotten rid of the material and that the teacher {{is no longer in}} the classroom." [...] He had been [...] "ordered [...] to work from home pending an investigation." [...] Sandals called it a [...] "one off." [...] Sandals stated how this type of material would not be included in the new Ontario curriculum. Lisa MacLeod, the critic for education from the Progressive Conservative Party, stated [...] "parents have not asked for this type of sexually explicit information to be made available to their children. The fact that an Ontario teacher felt comfortable enough to post it speaks to the cozy relationship the Liberal government has with their unions." [...] MacLeod feels that the Toronto District School Board is [...] "clearly out of control when it comes to this." [...] She also stated that [...] "this {{is not the first time}} something like has occurred there - and I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> really has to put their foot down and make it known that that type of material is unacceptable." [...] A spokesman for the school board claimed that the teacher had [...] "good intentions." [...] MacLeod criticized the spokesman and thinks that the school board should fire someone for the material being posted. The AIDS Committee of Toronto, who published one of the brochures, stated that the intended material published by them was for adults. The Toronto Sun asked in an article, [...] "if the teacher now being paid to be at home, or any adult, were to pass out this material in a park, would the police not be called?" [...] and when is the TDSB going to notify police about a brochure teaching children?"safer sucking tips?" [...] A spokesman for the board stated, [...] "At this time, police have not been notified." [...] Toronto Police Service investigated the brochures and decided that no charges would be pressed against Vroom because it [...] "didn't meet Criminal Code criteria to lay charges for exposing children to obscene material or corrupting the morals of children." [...] Vroom was later reinstated after the issue had been [...] "resolved." ...|$|E

Hate their aims as one may, one must admit that their conduct is heroic. Few have quailed in their trials. All preserve a calmness of demeanour that even their judges and executioners cannot but admire. They seem made of iron; they suffer everything, give up everything, dare everything for their faith; they die, as the Christian martyrs died in Rome, unflinching, unrepentant. If they have become as wild beasts, severity has made them so. Their propaganda was at first a peaceful one. It is cruelty that has driven them to use the only weapon at their disposal, assassination.|$|E
6000|$|The Three Hundred have assembled; 'all the Committees are in activity;' Lafayette is dictating despatches for Versailles, when a Deputation of the Centre Grenadiers {{introduces}} {{itself to}} him.

There lives on in their breasts a remainder coal of ambition still unquenched. Or it is only so that I can explain a late astonishing sally of his Honour's. In a long and elaborate judgment he has pared the nails, and indeed removed the fingers, of his only rival, the municipal magistrate. For eighteen months he has seen the lower Court crowded with affairs, the while his own stood unfrequented like an obsolete churchyard. He may have remarked with envy many hundred cases passing through his rival's hands, cases of assault, cases of larceny, ranging {{in the last four}} months from 2s. up to £1 12s.; or he may have viewed with displeasure that despatch of business which was characteristic of the magistrate, Mr. Cooper. An end, at least, has been made of these abuses. Mr. Cooper is henceforth to draw his salary for the minimum of public service; and all larcenies and assaults, however trivial, must go, according to the nationality of those concerned, before the Consular or the Supreme Courts.|$|E

Will they ever be reproduced for other celebrations of the glorious 29th of July?--I think not; the Government which vowed {{that there should be}} no more persecutions of the press, was, on that very 29th, seizing a Legitimist paper, for some real or fancied offence against it: it had seized, and was seizing daily, numbers of persons merely suspected of being disaffected (and you may fancy how liberty is understood, when some of these prisoners, the other day, on coming to trial, were found guilty and sentenced to ONE day's imprisonment, after THIRTY-SIX DAYS' DETENTION ON SUSPICION). I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>Government</b> which follows such a system, cannot be very anxious about any farther revolutionary fêtes, and that the Chamber may reasonably refuse to vote more money for them. Why should men be so mighty proud of having, on a certain day, cut a certain number of their fellow-countrymen's throats? The Guards and the Line employed this time nine years did no more than those who cannonaded the starving Lyonnese, or bayoneted the luckless inhabitants of the Rue Transnounain:--they did but fulfil the soldier's honorable duty:--his superiors bid him kill and he killeth:--perhaps, had he gone to his work with a little more heart, the result would have been different, and then--would the conquering party have been justified in annually rejoicing over the conquered? Would we have thought Charles X. justified in causing fireworks to be blazed, and concerts to be sung, and speeches to be spouted, in commemoration of his victory over his slaughtered countrymen?--I wish for my part they would allow the people to go about their business as on the other 362 days of the year, and leave the Champs Elysées free for the omnibuses to run, and the Tuileries' in quiet, so that the nurse-maids might come as usual, and the newspapers be read for a halfpenny apiece.|$|E
