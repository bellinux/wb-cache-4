5|$|Although a Masonic benefit {{was held}} in his honour to try <b>to</b> <b>recoup</b> some of his {{financial}} losses, the fiasco spelt the end of L'Estrange's aeronautical career.|$|E
5|$|In {{an effort}} <b>to</b> <b>recoup</b> diminished family fortunes, Joseph Chamberlain sent his younger son to {{establish}} a sisal plantation on Andros Island in the Bahamas. Neville Chamberlain spent six years there but the plantation was a failure, and Joseph Chamberlain lost £50,000.|$|E
5|$|Chamberlain {{was born}} in 1869; his father was the {{politician}} and future Cabinet minister, Joseph Chamberlain. He was educated at Rugby School and Mason College (now Birmingham University); at neither institution was he particularly successful. After a period in a firm of chartered accountants, the younger Chamberlain spent {{six years in the}} Bahamas managing a sisal plantation in a failed attempt <b>to</b> <b>recoup</b> the family fortunes.|$|E
50|$|The {{costs of}} using base {{isolation}} for large structures {{have been found}} <b>to</b> be <b>recouped</b> {{in only a few}} years as insurance premiums are reduced so dramatically.|$|R

50|$|Face-Off grossed $600,000 at the {{box office}} by early 1973. Although a {{substantial}} box office income for a Canadian film, the Canadian Film Development Corporation did not expect <b>to</b> fully <b>recoup</b> its investment unless the film earned twice that amount.|$|R
5|$|In {{an attempt}} <b>to</b> <b>recoup</b> losses and pay {{outstanding}} debts, the Senators moved the NHL franchise to St. Louis, {{where it was}} nicknamed the Eagles. However, the team continued to lose money because of its travel expenses, and it was forced to sell players to other teams to meet its financial obligations.|$|E
5|$|Shot on {{location}} at an orphanage and two factories in central Java, Panggilan Darah was a modest commercial {{success in the}} Indies and Singapore. Its soundtrack, which featured nine kroncong songs, received popular acclaim, and the film's acting received critical praise. Despite this success, Oriental was unable <b>to</b> <b>recoup</b> its expenses, and merged into Multi Film soon afterwards. Panggilan Darah, which was screened as late as 1952, may now be lost.|$|E
5|$|The company {{announced}} in November 1945 that its first production would be James Stewart in It's a Wonderful Life, produced {{and directed by}} Capra. In Spring 1946 {{it was announced that}} Liberty would be getting a fifth partner, producer-director Victor Fleming, although that deal never saw fruition. The film was released in November 1946, but was a financial failure. Although it was in the top 7% of that year's films as ranked by box office gross, it was unable <b>to</b> <b>recoup</b> its high production cost of $2.3 million, much less show a profit. After the film's release, Briskin became an outspoken advocate for the policy of longer runs for films, allowing them <b>to</b> <b>recoup</b> the cost of production. Without longer runs, he told The Film Daily, the quality of films would decline, as production costs continued to escalate.|$|E
3000|$|... {{employers}} {{are sensitive to}} the costs of training and are reluctant to accrue a net cost {{at the end of the}} training period unless they have in place measures that will allow that net cost <b>to</b> be <b>recouped</b> over the short- to medium-term; [...]...|$|R
50|$|A toll road, {{also known}} as a turnpike or tollway, is a public or private roadway for which a fee (or toll) is {{assessed}} for passage. It is a form of road pricing typically implemented <b>to</b> help <b>recoup</b> the cost of road construction and maintenance.|$|R
2500|$|In 1930 Franklin {{introduced}} {{a new type of}} engine which ultimately produced , with one of the highest power-to-weight ratios of the time. In 1932, in response to competition amongst luxury car makers, Franklin brought out a twelve-cylinder engine. Air-cooled with 398 cubic inches (6.5 L) it developed 150hp (110kW). The V-12 was designed to be installed in a lightweight chassis, but the car became a [...] behemoth when Franklin engineers were overruled by management sent in from banks to recover bad loans. Although attractive, the Twelve did not have the ride and handling characteristics of its forebears. Unfortunately, this was simply the wrong vehicle to be building after the crash of 1929 and the Great Depression that followed. The cars sold poorly; only 200 were ever produced, and came nowhere near <b>to</b> <b>recouping</b> the company's investment.|$|R
5|$|The {{total cost}} of the picture was {{reported}} variously as $935,000 or $1.5 million. Even the lower figure was an exceptionally large amount for the time. <b>To</b> <b>recoup</b> its costs, MGM kept the film in circulation for many years. The running time of the film in previews was 160 minutes. Major cuts were made afterward, however. The final running time for the film was either 117 or 120 minutes.|$|E
5|$|While a {{critical}} success, Citizen Kane failed <b>to</b> <b>recoup</b> its costs {{at the box}} office. The film faded from view after its release but was subsequently returned to the public's attention when it was praised by such French critics as André Bazin and given an American revival in 1956. The film was released on Blu-ray on September 13, 2011, for a special 70th anniversary edition.|$|E
5|$|Established {{during the}} revival of the Indies film industry, Oriental {{released}} its first film, Kris Mataram, in July 1940. It starred Njoo's wife Fifi Young, and relied on her fame as a stage actress to draw audiences. This was followed by a further three films, which were targeted at low-income audiences and extensively used kroncong music. Their final production was Panggilan Darah in 1941, which was completed after Njoo and Young had migrated to Majestic Film. Oriental was unable <b>to</b> <b>recoup</b> its expenses of renting a Dutch-owned studio, and the company was shut down.|$|E
50|$|In 1930 Franklin Automobile Company {{introduced}} {{a new type of}} engine which ultimately produced , with one of the highest power-to-weight ratios of the time. In 1932, in response to competition amongst luxury car makers, Franklin brought out a twelve-cylinder engine. Air-cooled with 398 cubic inches (6.5 L) it developed 150 hp (110 kW). The V-12 was designed to be installed in a lightweight chassis, but the car became a 6,000 pound behemoth when Franklin engineers were overruled by management sent in from banks to recover bad loans. Although attractive, the V-12 did not have the ride and handling characteristics of its forebears. Unfortunately, this was simply the wrong vehicle to be building after the crash of 1929 and the Great Depression that followed.

50|$|Ronny Drayton is a guitarist {{currently}} {{based in}} the New York City area. He has also been involved recently in efforts to get his son, Donovan Drayton, out of the prison located on Riker's Island. In 2013 he contributed music to a benefit album <b>to</b> help <b>recoup</b> the legal fees involved in this fight.|$|R
50|$|The {{situation}} can {{be allowed to}} continue for what seems like unreasonably long periods, as senior management are often reluctant to admit that they allowed a failed project to go on for so long. In many cases, the actual device itself may eventually work, but not well enough <b>to</b> ever <b>recoup</b> its development costs.|$|R
5|$|Glass {{is badly}} mauled by {{a grizzly bear}} and left close to death. Trapper John Fitzgerald, fearful of another Arikara attack, argues that the group must mercy-kill Glass and keep moving. Henry agrees, but is unable to pull the trigger; instead, he offers money for someone to stay with Glass. When the only volunteers are Hawk and the young Jim Bridger, Fitzgerald agrees to stay for money, <b>to</b> <b>recoup</b> his losses from the {{abandoned}} pelts.|$|E
5|$|Max Havoc: Curse of the Dragon has {{garnered}} press through lawsuits regarding its financing. Guam Economic Development and Commerce Authority (GEDCA) gave a $800,000 {{loan guarantee}} to producer John F. S. Laing, which was forfeited {{as the film}} failed <b>to</b> <b>recoup</b> the investment. GEDCA alleged Laing defrauded them, while he claimed Guam authorities promised him funding he did not receive. This kicked off a lengthy legal battle, ending with a settlement between Laing and GEDCA.|$|E
5|$|Where {{payments}} {{have been}} made by mistake claimants {{may or may not be}} able <b>to</b> <b>recoup</b> their losses. The leading case is Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale v Islington LBC, where Lord Browne-Wilkinson declared that a constructive trust would be created when the recipient of the funds became aware of the mistaken transfer. As such, ignorance of the mistake would not create a fiduciary relationship, therefore not a trust, and the property would be untraceable.|$|E
25|$|<b>To</b> help <b>recoup</b> {{the cost}} of the project and service the debt, once {{operational}} Tornado would take over haulage duties on the Trust’s own Talisman railtours, and be offered for hire to heritage railways and other railtour and charter train operators. Whilst at heritage railways, the Trust would also offer driver experiences at the controls of Tornado.|$|R
50|$|Coleman {{has stated}} that the band's record company forced him (and Walker) to release the album under the Killing Joke name in order <b>to</b> best <b>recoup</b> its {{considerable}} production costs. For example, Coleman claims that £15,000 was spent just in trying to record Ferguson's drums, before he was ejected and entirely replaced by session player Jimmy Copley.|$|R
50|$|An {{expansive}} {{report in}} which auditors {{found that the}} City had missed the opportunity to collect $190 million in street cut fees because of shoddy cost calculations. As {{a result of the}} audit, a series of motions was introduced <b>to</b> better <b>recoup</b> costs from street cuts, retrofit City asphalt production facilities, and pilot new digital pothole-tracking technologies.|$|R
5|$|A reboot of the series, with Bond winning his 00 {{status in}} the pre-credits sequence. Bond is {{instructed}} to investigate the funding of terrorism. He tracks down and kills a bomb-maker and takes his mobile phone. Searching through the phone, Bond discovers a text message which he traces to Alex Dimitrios, {{and then on to}} financer Le Chiffre. Le Chiffre's investments involve short-selling stock in successful companies and then engineering terrorist attacks to sink their share prices. Bond foils Le Chiffre's plan to destroy the prototype Skyfleet airliner, which forces Le Chiffre to set up a high-stakes poker tournament at the Casino Royale <b>to</b> <b>recoup</b> his fortune. Bond is instructed to beat Le Chiffre and is aided by a member of HM Treasury, Vesper Lynd.|$|E
5|$|Clues from Mollaka {{point to}} corrupt Greek {{official}} Alex Dimitrios. Bond finds Dimitrios in the Bahamas and, after seducing his wife Solange, pursues him to Miami. Bond kills Dimitrios and follows his henchman to the airport. He thwarts {{the destruction of}} Skyfleet's airliner, costing Le Chiffre his investment. <b>To</b> <b>recoup</b> the money, Le Chiffre sets up a high-stakes Texas hold 'em tournament at the Casino Royale in Montenegro. MI6 enters Bond in the tournament, believing a defeat will force Le Chiffre to seek asylum with the British government, which they will grant in exchange for information on his clients. On the train to Montenegro, Bond meets Vesper Lynd, a British Treasury agent there to protect the government's $10million buy-in.|$|E
5|$|Coal {{from the}} inland mines in {{southern}} County Durham {{was taken away}} on packhorses, and then horse and carts as the roads were improved. A canal was proposed by George Dixon in 1767 and again by John Rennie in 1815, but both schemes failed. Meanwhile, the port of Stockton-on-Tees, from which the Durham coal was transported onwards by sea, had invested considerably during the early 19th century in straightening the Tees {{in order to improve}} navigation on the river downstream of the town and was subsequently looking for ways to increase trade <b>to</b> <b>recoup</b> those costs.|$|E

Whilst at heritage railways, the Trust would also offer driver experiences at the controls of Tornado.|$|R
5000|$|While bagatelle-derived [...] "marble games" [...] {{have long}} existed previously, Baffle Ball {{was the first}} commercially {{successful}} game of its type, being affordable enough for store and tavern owners <b>to</b> quickly <b>recoup</b> the machine's cost. Over 50,000 machines were made, jump-starting the arcade pinball field; it spawned a home version in 1932 called Baffle Ball Senior.|$|R
25|$|The {{cost for}} the Øresund Connection, {{including}} motorway and railway connections on land, was DKK 30.1 billion (~€4.0 bn) according to the 2000 year price index, {{with the cost of}} the bridge expected in 2003 <b>to</b> be <b>recouped</b> by 2037. In 2006, Sweden began work on the Malmö City Tunnel, a SEK 9.45billion connection with the bridge that was completed in December 2010.|$|R
5|$|Comparing {{the driver}} energy input to the fusion energy output {{produces}} a number known as fusion energy gain factor, labelled Q. A Q value {{of at least}} 1 {{is required for the}} system to produce net energy. Since some energy is needed to run the reactor, in order for there to be net electrical output, Q has to be at least 3. For commercial operation, Q values much higher than this are needed. For ICF, Qs on the order of 25 to 50 are needed <b>to</b> <b>recoup</b> both the electrical generation losses and the large amount of power used to power the driver. In the fall of 1960, theoretical work carried out at LLNL suggested that gains of the required order would be possible with drivers on the order of 1MJ.|$|E
5|$|On 19 December 2009, President Obama {{signed a}} joint House and Senate Defense Appropriation Bill for FY 2010, which {{includes}} $130million {{funding for the}} Marine One program: $100million <b>to</b> <b>recoup</b> technologies developed under the VH-71 Kestrel program, and $30million for the Navy's initial studies on a new VH-XX program. In February 2010, the Navy issued a request for information to the aviation industry. In April 2010, Lockheed Martin announced they would team with Sikorsky in offering the Sikorsky S-92 instead of the VH-71. In June 2010, Boeing announced it was considering a U.S.-built licensed version of the AgustaWestland AW101 for the renewed VXX program {{as well as the}} Bell-Boeing V-22 Osprey and Boeing CH-47 Chinook.|$|E
5|$|The North Korean People's Army {{forces were}} {{organized}} into a mechanized combined arms force of ten divisions, originally numbering some 90,000 well-trained and well-equipped troops in July, {{with hundreds of}} T-34 Tanks. However, defensive actions by U.S. and South Korean forces had delayed the North Koreans significantly in their invasion of South Korea, costing them 58,000 of their troops {{and a large number}} of tanks. In order <b>to</b> <b>recoup</b> these losses, the North Koreans had to rely on less experienced replacements and conscripts, many of whom had been taken from the conquered regions of South Korea.|$|E
5000|$|During 2008, Walz {{repeatedly}} {{spoke out}} against using taxpayer money to bail out financial institutions; in late September he voted against the $700 billion TARP bill, which purchased troubled assets from these institutions. Walz released a statement after passage of the bill, saying, [...] "The bill we voted on today passes the buck when it comes <b>to</b> <b>recouping</b> the losses taxpayers might suffer. I also regret that this bill does not do enough to help average homeowners, or provide sufficient oversight of Wall Street.” In December 2008 he used the same reasoning when he voted against the bill that offered $14 billion in government loans to bail out the country's large automobile manufacturers. In June 2009 Walz introduced a bipartisan resolution calling {{on the federal government}} to [...] "relinquish its temporary ownership interests in the General Motors Corporation and Chrysler Group, LLC, as soon as possible” and stated that the government must not be involved in those companies' management decisions.|$|R
5|$|After the {{original}} series was cancelled, Paramount Studios, which {{had bought the}} series from Desilu, licensed the broadcast syndication rights <b>to</b> help <b>recoup</b> the production losses. Reruns began {{in the fall of}} 1969 and by the late 1970s the series aired in over 150 domestic and 60 international markets. This helped Star Trek develop a cult following greater than its popularity during its original run.|$|R
50|$|Not {{knowing what}} else to do, Town Meeting voted to offer it to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts {{to be used as}} a Governor's Mansion after going to Probate Court to change the terms of the will. The state agreed to pay $160,000, plus $20,000 a year <b>to</b> {{partially}} <b>recoup</b> the taxes that would be lost on it. The year before Katherine died, taxes were $50,000.|$|R
