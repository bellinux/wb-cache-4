5|$|Following the Council of Trent (1563), Pope Pius V (1566–1572) drew up {{the terms}} {{for the office}} of <b>the</b> <b>Superintendent</b> of the Ecclesiastical State, who was to handle the {{temporal}} affairs of the Papal States and the foreign relations of the Holy See. After abortively attempting to divide the duties of <b>the</b> <b>Superintendent</b> between four non-familial cardinals, Pius V acceded to the urgings of the College of Cardinals and his Spanish ambassador, and appointed his grandnephew, Michele Bonelli, as Superintendent, demarcating his duties with a papal bull of March 14, 1566. However, Pius V relentlessly avoided delegating any real autonomous power to Bonelli.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Superintendent</b> of Waterways and Parks (Shuiheng duwei 水衡都尉) {{was also}} known as the Chief Commandant of Waterways and Parks, and was once a {{subordinate}} of the Minister Steward until 115 BC, when he, and other former subordinates of that ministry, became independent officers.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine the Twitter {{communication}} between school districts, <b>superintendents,</b> and <b>the</b> public. Content analysis of the tweets posted by the 100 largest U. S. school districts and those district superintendents was performed to investigate how the districts and <b>the</b> <b>superintendents</b> communicated with <b>the</b> public on Twitter. Next, paired sample f-tests were performed to compare the differences between public sentiment toward the districts and <b>the</b> <b>superintendents.</b> <b>The</b> findings suggest that the districts and their superintendents primarily used Twitter for one-way information broadcasting, leaving Twitter’s two-way communication functionality largely untapped. Further, the public expressed significantly less negative sentiment toward <b>the</b> <b>superintendents</b> than <b>the</b> districts, whereas no statistical difference existed in the public’s positive or neutral sentiment toward the districts and <b>the</b> <b>superintendents.</b> <b>The</b> findings provide novel insights into educational institutions’ and leaders’ Twitter communication. More importantly, the findings offer research-based guidance on districts’ and superintendents’ Twitter communication. Recommendations were provided for districts and leaders to use social media effectively and thus engage the public and garner social support for education...|$|R
