5|$|Arctic terns {{sometimes}} dip down <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{water to}} catch prey {{close to the}} surface. They may also chase insects in the air when breeding. It is also thought that Arctic terns may, {{in spite of their}} small size, occasionally engage in kleptoparasitism by swooping at birds so as to startle them into releasing their catches. Several species are targeted—conspecifics, other terns (like the common tern), and some auk and grebe species.|$|E
5|$|Ariel, a sixteen-year-old mermaid princess, is {{dissatisfied}} with underwater {{life in the}} kingdom of Atlantica, and is curious about the human world. With her best friend Flounder, Ariel collects human artifacts in her grotto, and often goes <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ocean to visit Scuttle, a seagull who offers very inaccurate knowledge of human culture. She ignores the warnings of her father King Triton, the ruler of Atlantica, and Sebastian, a crab who serves as Triton's adviser and court composer, that contact between merpeople and humans is forbidden.|$|E
5000|$|Stone flaming or thermaling is the {{application}} <b>of</b> high temperature <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> stone <b>to</b> {{make it look}} like natural weathering.

30|$|Fortunately, {{the idea}} of {{circular}} sailing routing can also be extended to 3 D. Instead of mapping a plane <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> a sphere, 3 D-CSR maps wireless nodes in a 3 D region <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> a 3 D or 4 D sphere.|$|R
25|$|Two {{specialized}} {{terms are}} useful in describing views of arachnid legs and pedipalps. Prolateral refers <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> a leg that is closest <b>to</b> <b>the</b> anterior end of an arachnid's body. Retrolateral refers <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> a leg that is closest <b>to</b> <b>the</b> posterior end of an arachnid's body.|$|R
5|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} also reduces silica {{which has}} {{to be removed from}} the pig iron. The silica is reacted with calcium oxide (burned limestone) and forms a slag which floats <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> molten pig iron. The direct contact of flue gas with the iron causes contamination with sulfur if it is present in the fuel. Historically, to prevent contamination from sulfur, the best quality iron was produced with charcoal.|$|E
5|$|For an implant {{to become}} {{permanently}} stable, the body must grow bone <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> implant (osseointegration). Based on this biologic process, {{it was thought}} that loading an implant during the osseointegration period would result in movement that would prevent osseointegration, and thus increase implant failure rates. As a result, three to six months of integrating time (depending on various factors) was allowed before placing the teeth on implants (restoring them).|$|E
5|$|Four {{hundred million}} years ago, California lay {{at the bottom of}} a large sea; {{underwater}} volcanoes deposited lava and minerals (including gold) onto the sea floor. By tectonic forces these minerals and rocks came <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sierra Nevada, and eroded. Water carried the exposed gold downstream and deposited it in quiet gravel beds along the sides of old rivers and streams. The forty-niners first focused their efforts on these deposits of gold.|$|E

5|$|Mushrooms {{produce a}} spore prints that is yellow brown (especially in fresh prints) to olive brown. The smooth, {{yellowish}} spores measure 10–14 by 3–5μm, and range in shape from roughly elliptic to cylindric to subfusoid (somewhat spindle-shaped). The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are club-shaped, four-spored, and measure 27.2–35.2 by 9.6–10.4μm. The cellular {{arrangement of the}} cap cuticle is a trichodermium (whereby the outermost hyphae emerge roughly parallel, like hairs, perpendicular <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cap) consisting of erect hyphae with a diameter of 3.2–6.4μm.|$|E
5|$|Nitrogen is {{commonly}} used during sample preparation in chemical analysis. It is used to concentrate and reduce the volume of liquid samples.

5|$|Open {{water is}} {{unrestricted}} water {{such as a}} sea, lake or flooded quarry, where the diver has direct vertical access <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> water {{in contact with the}} atmosphere.

Agaricus deserticola has a positive Schaeffer's reaction, similar to species in section Arvensis in the genus Agaricus.|$|E

5|$|Sponge flies, {{also known}} as spongilla-flies (Neuroptera, Sisyridae), are {{specialist}} predators of freshwater sponges. The female lays her eggs on vegetation overhanging water. The larvae hatch and drop into the water where they seek out sponges to feed on. They use their elongated mouthparts to pierce the sponge and suck the fluids within. The larvae of some species cling <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sponge while others take refuge in the sponge's internal cavities. The fully grown larvae leave the water and spin a cocoon in which to pupate.|$|E
5|$|Superficial or surface anatomy is {{important}} as the study of anatomical landmarks that can be readily seen from the exterior contours of the body.

5|$|Tennessee (Danny McBride) is {{the pilot}} of the Covenant and Maggie Faris' husband. During a space walk to repair the solar {{recharge}} sails of the Covenant, Tennessee inadvertently intercepts a signal from Shaw, which prompts the colonization mission to divert towards the signal's source. While {{the brunt of the}} crew embarks on an excursion <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Engineer home world, Tennessee pilots Covenant in high orbit. Due to an ionic storm, he is unable to have adequate communication with the expedition. To regain communications, Tennessee brings Covenant dangerously close to the storm, which allows Daniels to privately reveal to him that Maggie is dead. Tennessee pilots a cargo lander down <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> planet and extracts Daniels, Lope and David impersonating Walter, assisting with killing an Alien in the process. Aboard Covenant, the crew is alerted to an Alien stowaway, prompting Tennessee to work with Daniels to dispose of it. They lure it to the terraforming bay, where it is ejected into space. Tennessee subsequently returns to cryosleep before Daniels does.|$|E
5|$|The cap {{flesh is}} {{composed}} of two distinct layers: a thin, compact, black-brown and hairy upper layer, and a thick, soft, white to light brown lower layer that is made of thin, thread-like filaments arranged in a roughly parallel fashion. The stem is similarly divided, with a thin, dark and hairy cortical layer covered by hairs, which encircles inner ochre-colored flesh. A drop of potassium hydroxide applied <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mushroom will cause it to instantly stain black.|$|E
