As the song begins, Jay-Z is seen driving a gunmetal grey Aston Martin while Beyoncé sits in the passenger seat. As they drive through the sepia sands of Mexico, clips of the police {{from the beginning of}} the video are cut into the scene.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{strategies that}} operators can employ to profitably provide acceptable and affordable telecommunication services to {{customers in the}} rural areas. The strategies discussed {{include the use of}} low power / low cost infrastructure designed and based on the specifications of the rural areas and the shared access concept using the Global System for Mobile (GSM) <b>phone</b> <b>booth.</b> These strategies are based on infrastructure that is modular, scalable, solar powered, and customizable to the operator’s specifications. The low cost infrastructure is designed to extend telecommunication services to rural areas enabling users in those areas to link up with the operator’s network in the urban areas using their personal phones. These devices (repeaters) can be designed to allow <b>the</b> user’s <b>phones</b> to transmit at minimum power thus giving them longer talk time. With <b>the</b> GSM <b>phone</b> <b>booth,</b> <b>the</b> users don’t need to have personal <b>phones.</b> <b>The</b> GSM <b>phone</b> <b>booths</b> are installed within their streets and the users are supplied with re-loadable cards with which they can access <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>booths</b> to make their calls. These <b>phone</b> <b>booths</b> are also designed to be range extenders powered by solar making them suitable for the more remote areas.

25|$|When a {{practical}} effect cannot be accomplished, the crew turns to Entity FX to create digital imagery {{for a given}} scene. Sometimes this imagery is to substitute action sequences that they cannot do on-site, and other times {{it is used to}} create subtle foreground or background effects. For instance, a matte painting is used to establish the Metropolis background, which is composed of buildings from several modern-day cities in addition to Vancouver; they include Singapore and Hong Kong among others. For the scene where Clark rips his shirt open in <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>booth,</b> revealing the tattoo, visual effects were added to the tattoo illuminating it.
