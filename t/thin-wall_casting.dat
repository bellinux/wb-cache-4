5000|$|The 335 series V8s were {{overhead}} valve pushrod V8 engines that used a short-skirt engine block. This family of engines incorporated elements learned on the 385 big-block series, particularly the poly-angle combustion chambers with canted valves, and <b>thin-wall</b> <b>casting</b> technology. All 335 series V8s all had free breathing, large-port canted valve heads with a rugged engine block. [...] The 335 engines use large main-bearing caps, with four-bolt attachment on some {{versions of the}} engines. All 335 series engines are cast with provisions for four-bolt main bearing caps to be added through modification.|$|E
5000|$|... 1970 {{model year}} saw the {{previous}} 351W V8 engine options {{replaced with a}} new 351 cu in (5.8 L) Cleveland (351C) V8 in either 2V (2-venturi carburetor) or 4V (4-venturi carburetor) versions. Though some early 1970 mustangs, built in 1969, had the 351W. The 351C 4V (M code) engine featured 11.0:1 compression and produced 300 bhp (224 kW; 304 PS) at 5400 rpm. This new performance engine incorporated elements learned from the Ford 385 series engine and the Boss 302, particularly the poly-angle combustion chambers with canted valves and the <b>thin-wall</b> <b>casting</b> technology.|$|E
5000|$|The small-block {{engine that}} was {{identified}} as the Windsor engine {{was introduced in the}} 1962 Ford Fairlane. Displacing 221 cuin L, it was designed to save weight, using <b>thin-wall</b> <b>casting</b> with a block that does not extend below the centerline of the crankshaft. The engine uses a separate aluminum timing chain cover, which differentiates it from the later 335-series Cleveland engines that use an integrated timing cover. All Windsor engines use two-valve-per-cylinder heads, with [...] "2V" [...] and [...] "4V" [...] designations indicating the number of barrels (or venturi) in the carburetor. The valves are in-line and use straight six-bolt valve covers. Coolant is routed into the block by the intake manifold.|$|E
25|$|In September 1961, American {{automotive}} designer Carroll Shelby {{wrote to}} AC asking {{if they would}} build him a car modified to accept a V8 engine. AC agreed, provided a suitable engine could be found. Shelby went to Chevrolet {{to see if they}} would provide him with engines, but not wanting to add competition to the Corvette they said no. However, Ford wanted a car that could compete with the Corvette and they happened to have a brand new engine which could be used in this endeavor: the Windsor 221 in³ (3.6 L) engine – a new lightweight, <b>thin-wall</b> <b>cast</b> small-block V8.

40|$|The {{object of}} investigation: the <b>thin-wall</b> steel <b>casts</b> of the {{responsible}} purpose. The {{purpose of the}} work: the development of technical solutions and creating the technological casting process by the molten models with crystallization under the pressure on its base, ensuring the obtaining of the <b>thin-wall</b> <b>casts</b> with the preset construction strength. The tests of mechanical properties, the fatigue tests, hydrotests, thermographing and modeling have been performed. The increase of density of the cast metal and elimination of the cast defects have been established, the heat-power parameters of the processes for receiving the molten models, sheath forms and casts have been justified. The distribution of the steel temperature in the metal receiver, filling of thin walls resulting from the pressure and steel consumption rate at the mould inlet have been established. The technological processes of receiving the models to be molten, sheath forms and casts allowing to use the casts instead of the roll stock, stamping and welded joints have been developed. The developed technological processes have been introduced in the experimental-industrial scale. The efficiency of the introduction: reduction of the electric power by 20 %, the labour of mechanical treatment by 2 times, the rejection by 30 %Available from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The silicon-based {{aluminum}} {{casting alloy}} and 2 {{different types of}} gate designs were used to investigate experimentally the fabrication feasibility of sound <b>thin-wall</b> case <b>casting</b> by die-casting process. While split type gate design had no defect, tangential type gate design resulted in cracks in the all obtained specimens. Electrolytic Oxide (PEO) coating was performed as a surface treatment process. Before the PEO coating treatments some die cast specimens were heat treated at the temperature of 323 K and N 2 atmosphere for 1 hr to evaluate the effect of heat treatment. The result showed that hardness was improved after PEO coating, however, the effect of heat treatment was not significant...|$|R

The 1970 body {{included}} dual-beam headlights with the previous inner headlights becoming sport lamps and recessed taillights on a black honeycomb rear panel, side scoops behind both doors removed, revised bucket seats, deep dish sports wheel covers, {{as well as new}} side and rear badging and striping were the main visual differences. 1970 saw the previous 351W V8 engine options replaced with a new 351 cu in (5.8 L) Cleveland (351C) V8 in either 2V (for use with 2-venturi carbs) or 4V (for use with 4-venturi carbs) versions. The 351C 4V (M code) engine featured 11.0:1 compression and produced 300 bhp (224 kW; 304 PS) at 5400 rpm.

40|$|The use {{of steel}} {{components}} {{is being challenged}} by lighter nonferrous or cast iron components. The development of techniques for enhancing and ensuring the filability of thin-wall mold cavities is most critical for thinner wall cast steel production. The purpose {{of this research was}} to develop <b>thin-wall</b> <b>casting</b> techniques {{that can be used to}} reliably produce thin-wall castings from traditional gravity poured sand casting processes. The focus of the research was to enhance the filling behavior to prevent misrunds. Experiments were conducted to investigate the influence of various foundry variables on the filling of thin section steel castings. These variables include casting design, heat transfer, gating design, and metal fluidity. Wall thickness and pouring temperature have the greatest effect on casting fill. As wall thickness increases the volume to surface area of the casting increases, which increases the solidification time, allowing the metal to flow further in thicker sect ions. Pouring time is another significant variable affecting casting fill. Increases or decreases of 20 % in the pouring time were found to have a significant effect on the filling of thin-wall production castings. Gating variables, including venting, pouring head height, and mold tilting also significantly affected <b>thin-wall</b> <b>casting</b> fill. Filters offer less turbulent, steadier flow, which is appropriate for thicker castings, but they do not enhance <b>thin-wall</b> <b>casting</b> fill...|$|E
40|$|The {{dimensionless}} Niyama criterion {{was used}} to predict the formation of microporosity in nickel-based superalloy casting, which extended the model application from a simple plate casting to complex thin-wall superalloy casting. The physical characteristics of the superalloy were calculated by JMatPro software. The relation between the volume percentage of microporosity and the dimensionless Niyama values were constructed. Quantitative metallographic measurements of the microporosity of the practical <b>thin-wall</b> <b>casting</b> were carried out. The prediction agreed well with the experiment in general, except for some thick-wall sites in the casting...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{provides}} an overview of alloy and process developments in aluminum and magnesium castings for lightweight automotive applications. Wear-resistant aluminum alloys, creep-resistant and high strength/ductility magnesium alloys have been developed for automotive applications. On the process front, vacuum-assisted die casting and high vacuum die casting technologies have been developed for high-integrity body and chassis applications. <b>Thin-wall</b> and hollow <b>casting</b> components are being produced by low-pressure die casting processes for structural applications. Overcasting technology is gaining traction and has enabled mixed material designs for automotive sub-systems such as engine cradles and instrument panel beams. Simulation tools developed to predict the interfacial interactions of the dissimilar components and the structural integrity of the overcast systems are being validated in the casting trials...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{summarizes}} the melting and casting processes for magnesium alloys. It also reviews {{the historical development of}} magnesium castings and their structural uses {{in the western}} world since 1921 when Dow began producing magnesium pistons. Magnesium casting technology was well developed during and after World War II, both in gravity sand and permanent mold casting as well as high-pressure die casting, for aerospace, defense and automotive applications. In the last 20 years, most of the development has been focused on <b>thin-wall</b> die <b>casting</b> applications in the automotive industry, taking advantages of the excellent castability of modern magnesium alloys. Recently, the continued expansion of magnesium casting applications into automotive, defense, aerospace, electronics and power tools has led to the diversification of casting processes into vacuum die casting, low-pressure die casting, squeeze casting, lost foam casting, ablation casting as well as semi-solid casting. This paper will also review the historical, current and potential structural use of magnesium with a focus on automotive applications. The technical challenges of magnesium structural applications are also discussed. Increasing worldwide energy demand, environment protection and government regulations will stimulate more applications of lightweight magnesium castings in the next few decades. The development of use of Integrated Computational Materials Engineering (ICME) tools will accelerate the applications of magnesium castings in structural applications...|$|R
40|$|A new {{inorganic}} binder {{system has been}} developed to prepare the mold having a high strength for the thin-walled casting. To increase the fracture strength at high temperature, {{a large amount of}} {{inorganic binder}} should be converted into glass phase and the generated glass phase has to be homogeneously coated on the surface of starting particles. In this work, two types of process were employed to investigate the coating and glassification efficiencies of inorganic precursor. In the first process (process I), the green body consisting of starting powder and organic binder was dipped in the inorganic precursor solution. In the second process (process II), the starting powder was coated by inorganic precursor, and then the organic binder was used to form the green body. The mold sample prepared using process II showed the higher strength value than that using process I, owing to the inclement effect on the glassfication efficiency by the loss of inorganic precursor in process I. The prepared real mold was perfectly produced and the casted product showed a clean surface without defects such as dross, nonmetallic inclusions, and crack. Consequently, the new inorganic binder system could be applied for preparing the mold for the <b>thin-wall</b> <b>casting</b> having high mechanical properties...|$|E
40|$|Lost foam casting is a {{relatively}} new process in commercial terms and is widely used to produce defect free castings owing to its advantages like producing complex shape and acceptable surface finish. In the present research, experimental investigations in lost foam casting of aluminium-silicon cast alloy, LM 6, were conducted. The main objective {{of the study was to}} evaluate the effect of different sand sizes and pouring temperatures on the porosity of thin-wall castings. A stepped pattern was used in the study and the focus of the investigations was at the thinnest 3 mm section. A full 2 -level factorial design experimental technique was employed to plan the experiment and subsequently identify the significant factors which affect the casting porosity. The result shows that increasing in the pouring temperature decreases the porosity in the <b>thin-wall</b> section of <b>casting.</b> Finer sand size is more favourable than coarse size for LFC mould making process...|$|R
