2500|$|Within the China {{economic}} success story, western scholars noticed that China's quest of wealth has once more led coastal provinces to quickly enrich, while inland provinces or rural areas stay relatively poor, an inequality which thus leads to internal social tensions and instability. Recent economic growth helped {{to stabilize the}} Chinese society: in times of economic growth, individuals look simply for personal life improvement. Millions of poor farmers and workers work hard and silently in hope of a better lives tomorrow; <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> TVs, computers, cellphones, cars, fridges. To keep them happy and stable, China have to stay largely supplied in raw materials - oil, copper, zinc, cobalt - from abroad.|$|E
2500|$|In November 2007, Irish On-Line {{reported}} that the book would not {{be published in the}} United Kingdom, because it was anticipated not to contain anything [...] "sensational" [...] about Cruise that would make it a blockbuster. [...] An article in the New York Post attributed this to the [...] "scandalous" [...] nature of the book, and what the paper referred to as [...] "UK's celebrity-friendly libel laws.". For similar reasons the book was not published by major booksellers in New Zealand and Australia, though an underground market for the book sprung up on auction site eBay there; the book was also available in some Australian independent bookstores, with buyers having to pay a significant premium on the cover price. [...] Copies of the book sold for over A$60 on eBay Australia, and one eBay seller commented [...] "These things don't happen too often. The book has generated so much attention and the more people are hearing about it, the more that <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> it. The censorship factor has also had a major impact." ...|$|E

[...] Another stated to Giles, [...] "you can't say what you do for a living." [...] For tax and banking purposes, and to establish a legitimate income and credit history, Giles was told she needed to start saying she was a [...] "freelancer". The ACORN employee also suggested that Giles open two accounts at separate banks, depositing no more than $500 each a week to ensure few eyebrows are raised.|$|E

The older system, where the customers {{had to ask}} the shop attendant for products <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy,</b> is still used in some small and more remote shops. The older method was justified by the assumption that desk service would avoid tempting people <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> more than planned.|$|R

60|$|Odd, thought I to myself, decidedly odd. These American husbands, {{they must}} be a {{delicate}} type of humanity. The wonder is their mothers ever reared them. They marry fine girls, the majority of them; two or three sweet children are born to them, and after that {{there appears to be}} no further use for them, as far as this world is concerned. Can nothing be done to strengthen their constitutions? Would a tonic be of any help to them? Not the customary tonic, I don't mean, the sort of tonic merely intended to make gouty old gentlemen feel <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> a hoop, but the sort of tonic for which it was claimed that three drops poured upon a ham sandwich and the thing would begin to squeak.|$|E
60|$|They {{arrived at}} length at the pond. There {{was a little}} village there, upon {{the shore of the}} pond. The reason why there {{happened}} to be a village there, was this: A stream of water, which came down from among the mountains, emptied into the pond here, and, very near where it emptied, it fell over a ledge of rocks, making a waterfall, where the people had built some mills. Now, where there are mills, there must generally be a blacksmith's shop, to mend the iron work when it gets broken, and to repair tools. There is often a tavern, also, for the people who come to the mills; and then there is generally a store or two; for wherever people have to come together, for any business, there {{is a good place to}} open a store, to sell them what <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy.</b> Thus there was a little village about these mills, which was generally called the Mill village.|$|E
5000|$|On 23 April 2014, Sydsvenskan {{acknowledged}} that <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> HD.

They reached a deal in the end of May and the Swedish Competition Authority approved it around two weeks after. While Sydsvenskan has a soft paywall, it is not yet decided if HD will also have one.|$|R
