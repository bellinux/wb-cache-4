5|$|The most {{significant}} {{of the new}} contacts was Busoni. The great pianist and composer became Szigeti's mentor during these formative years, and the two would remain close friends until Busoni's death in 1924. By Szigeti's own admission, before meeting Busoni his life was characterized by a certain laziness and indifference {{brought on by the}} then-typical life of a young prodigy violinist. He had grown accustomed to playing crowd-pleasing salon miniatures and dazzling virtuosic encores without much <b>thought.</b> <b>He</b> <b>knew</b> little of the works of the great masters; he could play them, but not fully understand them. As Szigeti put it, Busoni—particularly through their careful study of Bach's Chaconne—"shook me once and for all out of my adolescent complacency".|$|E
500|$|The writing staff cited The Wizard of Oz as {{a source}} of {{thematic}} influence for Tron: Legacy in writing the script, with Kitsis stating that [...] "They both have very similar DNA, which is Tron really lives on, in a lot of ways, trying to get home. You're put on this world and you want to go home and what is home? That's in a lot of way inspired us." [...] Kitsis also added that they had to include an"emotional spine to take us into the story or else it just becomes a bunch of moves or gags and stuff", eventually deciding on adding a mysterious destiny to Flynn and giving him a legendary aura - [...] "Kevin Flynn to us was Steve Jobs and Bill Gates all wrapped up into one and John Lennon". The writers decided to create the character of Clu as an evil embodiment of [...] "how you look back on your younger self, (...) that guy [...] <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> everything, but he really knew nothing". Bridges liked the idea of the dual perspectives, and contributed with the writers for the characterization of Flynn as a sanguine Zen master by suggesting them to get inspiration from various Buddhist texts. Part of the concepts emerged from a reunion the producers had with scientists from California Institute of Technology and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory to discuss concepts such as isomorphic algorithms and the digitizing of organic matter.|$|E

60|$|We {{was about}} a month out from Sydney when old Thomas took sick. Bill Hicks {{said that it was}} owing to a ha'penny he couldn't account for; but Walter Jones, whose family was always ill, and <b>thought</b> <b>'e</b> <b>knew</b> a lot about it, said that <b>'e</b> <b>knew</b> wot it was, but 'e couldn't {{remember}} the name of it, and that when we got to London and Thomas saw a doctor, we should see as 'ow 'e was right.|$|R
2500|$|... "Gypsy Biker" [...] {{concerns}} the homecoming of a US soldier {{killed in action}} in Iraq, and Springsteen has said that [...] "Livin' in the Future" [...] references extraordinary rendition and illegal wiretapping. [...] "Long Walk Home" [...] is a metaphorical account of the narrator's sense that, in the artist's words, those people living at home [...] "he <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew,</b> whose ideals he had something in common with, are like strangers." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 4 February 1861, {{on orders}} to {{retrieve}} the child at all costs, Bascom went to [...] Apache Pass to seek out Cochise, son-in-law of Mangas Coloradas. Cochise said he didn't have the child but <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> who did and if given ten days could bring him in. [...] Bascom had the Apaches surrounded, informing Cochise they would be held as hostages until the child was returned. Cochise escaped and captured his own hostages to offer in exchange, but Bascom refused. A series of violent retaliatory actions followed from each side before the Chiricahua Apaches eventually declared war.|$|E
2500|$|On 30 October 2014, it was {{reported}} that an updated edition of John Roughan's biography John Key: Portrait of a Prime Minister had a new chapter on the election which mentioned that John Key claimed to have been told the identity of the hacker Rawshark. He did not pass the name on to the author of the biography. Asked by reporters about the comment and whether he given the information to the police, a spokesperson for Key said that while he <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> the identity of the hacker, [...] "he cannot be certain". The spokesperson also said that Key had no involvement in the police inquiry.|$|E
60|$|Then {{he smiled}} bitterly to himself. What manner of man {{was he to}} train a youth to loftiness and honour?--he, a debauched ruler with a {{nickname}} for which, had he any sense of shame, he would have blushed! Again he remembered the lad's disposition towards himself; but these, <b>he</b> <b>thought,</b> <b>he</b> hoped, <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> that <b>he</b> would now be able to overcome.|$|R
60|$|He went on packing, {{and putting}} {{away with the}} {{different}} garments the unpleasant <b>thoughts</b> that <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> should be sure to unpack with them in Rome; but they would then have less poignancy.|$|R
60|$|Bill {{said that}} <b>'e</b> <b>thought</b> <b>'e</b> <b>knew</b> who must ha' been asleep, {{and was just}} going to take a drink, when the conjurer asked 'im to excuse 'im agin. Bill put down the mug in a 'urry, and the conjurer put his 'and to the mug and took out a dead mouse. It would ha' been a 'ard thing to say which was the most upset, Bill Chambers or Smith, the landlord, and Bill, who was in a terrible state, asked why it was {{everything}} seemed to get into his mug.|$|R
2500|$|However, it is manifestly {{obvious from}} a close study of Manetho {{that he did}} not reckon the last month of a king's reign (and his death) {{in the context of a}} year from the pharaoh's {{accession}} date. [...] That was only done in civil dating on a document or monument. [...] Manetho supplied whole regnal years and then gave the month in which the king died (if he <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> it) reckoning from the beginning of that year. For example, the historian (erroneously) thought Hatshepsut must have died in the 9th month of the year because he knew that Thutmose III succeeded on Day 4 of the first month of Summer (the 9th month of the civil calendar), thereby assigning her a reign of 21 years and 9 months.

2500|$|Working with Bing Crosby {{proved to}} be {{problematic}} from the start. Between scenes he barely interacted with leading lady Joan Fontaine, on loan from RKO Radio Pictures, who later recalled, [...] "Crosby wasn't very courteous to me ... There was never the usual costar rapport. I was a star at that time, but he treated me like he'd never heard of me." [...] The singer tended to ignore his director as well. According to Fontaine, [...] "It wasn't that he had anything against Mr. Wilder. He just didn't {{pay much attention to}} him. He told me once that he had some trouble understanding his funny accent." [...] Worst of all, Crosby tended to alter his dialogue, saying it [...] "as he felt it at the moment," [...] and Wilder was known for insisting his lines be delivered exactly as written. [...] "Bing Crosby operated for himself, not for the group or the film," [...] Wilder recalled. [...] "He was a big star, the biggest, and he <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> what was good for him." ...|$|E
60|$|Charley {{said that}} he <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> {{arithmetic}} pretty well;--'at least some of it,' he modestly added.|$|E
6000|$|... "So I did destroy it, Dave, without {{answering}} it," [...] {{returned the}} money-lender's son. [...] "I was as {{surprised to hear}} from him as you would have been. I <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> would <b>know</b> enough to let me alone." ...|$|R
60|$|Joe's face darkened. The {{fuel supply}} {{was the only}} thing of which <b>he</b> had not <b>thought,</b> and <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> there was only such an amount on board as would serve to keep up steam about forty-eight hours.|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Horton <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> would <b>know</b> {{the lady}} again. He puts down her age at about twenty-six, {{describing}} her--to use his own piquant expression--as [...] "a bit of all right." [...] She had {{brown eyes and}} a taking way with her.|$|R
60|$|Dick understood. It was not Jake {{but himself}} who was threatened; and he <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> why.|$|E
60|$|He {{had been}} over that {{district}} many times and <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> about every foot of the ground.|$|E
60|$|But Tony <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> {{the country}} quite {{as well as}} George Mason did, and he felt sure he should find him.|$|E
60|$|He had not {{arrived at}} any {{decision}} so fixed {{as to make}} him comfortable when he went home and dressed for Mrs. Gresham's party. And yet <b>he</b> knew,--he <b>thought</b> that <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> that <b>he</b> would be true to Mary Flood Jones.|$|R
60|$|With the <b>thought</b> that <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> {{how a man}} felt {{receiving}} a reprieve at the eleventh hour, Dick sat on, thinking, forgetful {{that he had not}} hooked the receiver, until Bonbright came in from the secretaries' room to remind him.|$|R
60|$|Presently {{he sought}} to resume the {{interrupted}} thread of his <b>thoughts.</b> <b>He</b> <b>knew</b> that <b>he</b> had been dealing with some very tremendous and urgent problem when Eleanor had appeared. Then he remembered that Eleanor {{at the time of}} her approach had seemed to be a solution rather than an interruption. Well, she had her own life. She was making her own life. Instead of solving his problems she was solving her own. God bless those dear grave children! They were nearer the elemental things than he was. That eastward path led to Victoria--and thence to a very probable death. The lad was in the infantry and going straight into the trenches.|$|R
60|$|In {{the evening}} after dinner Barbara joined {{him in the}} drawing-room, and Cartwright waited with some amusement, for he <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> what she wanted.|$|E

6000|$|Parker {{implied by}} a cunning air that he <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> the reason of that; {{but he said}} nothing. Alice, piqued, would not condescend to make inquiries. So he said, presently, ...|$|E
60|$|James was {{wandering}} {{in the garden}} of Primpton House while Mrs. Jackson thither went her way. Since the termination of his engagement with Mary three days back, the subject had not been broached between him and his parents; but <b>he</b> divined their <b>thoughts.</b> <b>He</b> <b>knew</b> that they awaited the arrival of his uncle, Major Forsyth, to set the matter right. They did not seek to reconcile themselves with the idea that the break was final; it seemed too monstrous a thing to be true. James smiled, with bitter amusement, at their simple trust in the man of the world who was due that day.|$|R
60|$|I {{wonder what}} Myles would have <b>thought</b> had <b>he</b> <b>known</b> that so {{soon as he}} had left the office, Sir James had gone {{straight}} to the Earl and recounted the whole matter to him, with a deal of dry gusto, and that the Earl listened laughing.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes it is," [...] said Grandcourt, enfolding her hand. [...] "I {{will put}} off going. And I will travel at night, so as {{only to be}} away one day." [...] <b>He</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> the reason of what he {{inwardly}} called this bit of temper, and she was particularly fascinating to him at this moment.|$|R
60|$|They went up {{the ladder}} and saw a tug {{steaming}} for the ship with a barge in tow. A few minutes afterwards the passenger Kit <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> crossed the deck.|$|E
6000|$|... "Say, Cap, what's eatin' you?" [...] asked Arthurs. He looked dumfounded. Ken hung to him desperately; he <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> {{what was}} coming. There were hurried {{footsteps}} {{in the corridor}} and excited voices.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Because I saw he <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> me and {{was expecting}} it of me. If I hadn't done it {{he would have}} been hurt. I didn't want to embarrass him before the whole street.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I have {{sometimes}} hoped," [...] said Mrs. Western, [...] "that <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> it all." [...] Lady Grant shook her head. [...] "I {{have sometimes}} <b>thought</b> that <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> it all, and regarded it {{as a matter}} on which nothing need be said between us. Should I have been angry with him had he not told me of Miss Tremenhere?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, no. I'll go now, of course, Mr. Furnival." [...] And then Mr. Crabwitz did go, meditating {{as he went}} {{many things}} to himself. <b>He</b> <b>knew</b> his own value, or <b>thought</b> that <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> it; and might it not be {{possible}} to find some patron who would appreciate his services more justly than did Mr. Furnival? ...|$|R
6000|$|Dick said [...] "fell overboard," [...] but <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> {{something}} else. <b>He</b> <b>knew</b> as well {{as anybody}} that his father did strange things while {{under the influence of the}} melancholy spells which at times haunted him.|$|R
