50|$|In a {{television}} studio, a tally light {{is a small}} signal-lamp on a professional video camera or monitor. It is usually located just above the lens or on the electronic viewfinder (EVF) and communicates, {{for the benefit of}} those {{in front of the camera}} as well as the camera operator, that the camera is 'live' - i.e. its signal is being used for the 'main program' at that moment. Tally (also known as the 'on-air' indication) lights are typically red, although some cameras and video switchers accept a preview <b>tally</b> <b>signal,</b> which is typically green.|$|E
50|$|For {{television}} productions {{with more}} than one camera in a multiple-camera setup, the tally lights are generally illuminated automatically by a vision mixer trigger that is fed to a tally breakout board and then to a special video router designed for <b>tally</b> <b>signals.</b> The video switcher keeps track of which video sources are selected by the technical director and output to the main program bus. A switch automatically closes the appropriate electrical contacts to create a circuit, this lights the tallys located in the camera control units (CCU). If more than one camera is on-air simultaneously (as {{in the case of a}} dissolve), during the duration of the transition the tally lights of both cameras will remain lit until transition completion.|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} use of {{triaxial}} cable is in television {{industry as a}} connecting cable between a camera and its CCU. The outer sheath is commonly used as a protective earth conductor. The core provides both power and signal connections, with the return for the power being provided through the inner screen. Through frequency-division multiplexing, the camera can send audio and video signals along the triax while the CCU can send camera control information, such as exposure settings, intercom, return audio and video (usually that of the program), and <b>tally</b> (a <b>signal</b> alerting the operator that their camera is on the air)and power for the camera.|$|R
