5|$|A planned {{modification}} of the existing route encompasses construction of a directional T interchange to replace the existing <b>trumpet</b> <b>interchange</b> built at Žuta Lokva. The new interchange is only planned to be built once the A7 motorway is completed between the Rijeka bypass and Žuta Lokva. It shall not feature any weaving, similar to the Bosiljevo2 interchange of the A1 and A6 motorways.|$|E
5|$|The Hanlon Expressway {{begins at}} a <b>trumpet</b> <b>interchange</b> with Highway401 and cuts through several farms northward before curving {{slightly}} westward to follow {{along the west}} side of the right-of-way of Hanlon Road. It enters Guelph at Maltby Road, skirting the outskirts of urban development. At the Laird Road interchange, opened in late 2013, the expressway encounters the Hanlon Creek Business Park.|$|E
5|$|After the I-95 interchange, Route 37 widens {{to three}} lanes in each direction. The freeway crosses Jefferson Boulevard and Amtrak's Northeast Corridor {{railroad}} on twin-span bridges and passes {{to the north}} of the Lincoln Park Cemetery before interchanging with US 1 at exits 5A-B. The freeway terminates at a <b>trumpet</b> <b>interchange</b> with US 1, with the two left-hand lanes defaulting onto US 1 north and the right-hand lane serving US 1 south, which connects to T. F. Green Airport.|$|E
50|$|The Vega {{business}} loop of Interstate 40 {{runs along}} Former route 66 between two modified <b>trumpet</b> <b>interchanges</b> at exits 35 and 37.|$|R
50|$|<b>Trumpet</b> <b>interchanges</b> {{have been}} used where one highway terminates at another highway. These involve at least one loop ramp {{connecting}} traffic either entering or leaving the terminating expressway with the far lanes of the continuous highway.|$|R
500|$|The Kansas Turnpike is [...] long. [...] the Kansas Turnpike has 22 {{interchanges}} and two barrier toll plazas. Many of the interchanges {{are designed}} as <b>trumpet</b> <b>interchanges</b> with a connector {{road to the}} crossroad, for easy placement of a single toll plaza on the connector.|$|R
5|$|Damage to the {{crossing}} {{resulted in the}} closure of the QEW until a temporary bridge was erected. To remedy what was becoming a major delay and hazard, the Department of Highways began planning a high-level bridge to cross the shipping channel. To provide better access to the new structure as well as the proposed Chedoke Expressway, construction began on the Freeman Diversion, bypassing the old <b>trumpet</b> <b>interchange</b> and creating a new three-level stack. Work on both proceeded over the next six years.|$|E
5|$|Farther east, {{the road}} {{passes through the}} hamlets of Gardiner and Clintondale, and meets US9W in the hamlet of Highland. Just inside of Gardiner, the highway passes through Minnewaska State Park, a large state park in the Hudson Valley. US44 and NY55 join US9W for roughly a half-mile southward along the western bank of the Hudson River before {{separating}} at a <b>trumpet</b> <b>interchange</b> south of Highland. One mile east of US9W, US44 and NY55 cross the Hudson on the Mid-Hudson Bridge.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, {{construction}} {{began on}} the Quonset Freeway, a relocated Route403 that serves the Quonset Business Park from Route4. The project included the reconstruction and reworking of exit7 off Route4, which was a southbound-only exit serving both Route403 and Route402 when constructed. The exit was converted into a <b>trumpet</b> <b>interchange</b> with new ramps between Route4, Route403 and Route402 and was completed in December 2008, one year ahead of schedule. The project included {{the construction of a}} new northbound exit7 serving Route403 east.|$|E
50|$|<b>Trumpet</b> <b>interchanges</b> {{are named}} as such {{due to their}} {{resemblance}} to trumpets. The bell of a trumpet can be seen where the terminating highway begins to interchange with the continuous highway, and the resemblance to the tubing is seen along the connecting loop ramps.|$|R
50|$|The Tampoi North Interchange {{has been}} {{upgraded}} to a Double U-Turn interchange. Construction began in 2005 and {{was completed in}} 2008. Meanwhile, Skudai North junctions between Route 1 and Route 5 has been upgraded to <b>trumpet</b> <b>interchanges.</b> Construction began in 2005 and was completed on August 2007.|$|R
5000|$|The Kansas Turnpike is 236 mi long. [...] the Kansas Turnpike has 22 {{interchanges}} and two barrier toll plazas. Many of the interchanges {{are designed}} as <b>trumpet</b> <b>interchanges</b> with a connector {{road to the}} crossroad, for easy placement of a single toll plaza on the connector.|$|R
5|$|After re-crossing into Hamburg, NY179 {{continues}} eastward as Mile Strip Road, {{entering a}} large interchange with the New York State Thruway (I-90 exit56), which connects via <b>trumpet</b> <b>interchange.</b> After bending northeast, the route crosses over the Thruway, becoming a two-lane commercial street, passing {{north and south}} of several strip malls until an intersection with County Route204 (CR204; McKinley Parkway). After CR204, NY179 passes north of McKinley Mall, proceeding eastward as a four-lane divided boulevard past several residences before bending northeast, intersecting with CR4 (Abbott Road) in the town of Orchard Park.|$|E
5|$|At {{the eastern}} edge of the island, the highway reaches Swift Creek, another channel {{separating}} Meadow Island from Jones Island. The parkway crosses the waterway and immediately enters a <b>trumpet</b> <b>interchange</b> with the Meadowbrook State Parkway. The right-of-way of the Loop Parkway connects to and from the northbound direction of the Meadowbrook Parkway while two other ramps provide access to the southbound Meadowbrook Parkway. The Loop Parkway handled an average of 30,520 vehicles per day in 2011 according to estimates made by NYSDOT. Traffic along the highway has steadily increased since 2003, when the department recorded a daily average of 24,740 vehicles.|$|E
5|$|A mile (1.6km) {{north of}} NY417, NY16 reaches a bridge over Olean Creek, a {{tributary}} of the Allegheny. On the other side, it becomes a four-lane road with a divider as it approaches NY17, currently concurrent with I-86 pending the entire expressway's upgrade to Interstate Highway standards. A <b>trumpet</b> <b>interchange</b> provides access to I-86 and NY17 in both directions in the vicinity of Baldwin Heights. But NY16 runs parallel to the freeway and remains a four-lane route, although no longer divided, following the Olean valley. At Hinsdale it finally does cross I-86/NY17. Shortly afterwards, in the hamlet of Maplehurst, NY446, the former route of NY408, comes in from the east and terminates.|$|E
50|$|Prior to the December, 1992 {{completion}} of the Blue Route, this area had two discrete <b>trumpet</b> <b>interchanges.</b> There was the Norristown exit off I-276 that went through a toll plaza and connected to West Germantown Pike only. The other, independent, interchange connected the terminus of the Northeast Extension, then Pennsylvania Route 9, to I-276.|$|R
25|$|The A11 {{motorway}} has {{at least}} two traffic lanes and an emergency lane in each direction along its entire length. The Velika Gorica interchange is a cloverleaf interchange. The A11 route is not tolled from Jakuševec up to the Mraclin mainline toll plaza, after which point it is tolled at the Buševec and Lekenik exits, which comprise <b>trumpet</b> <b>interchanges.</b>|$|R
50|$|G4211 {{begins at}} the G42 exit at Tianbao Bridge. The {{expressway}} then turns south through the Liucun Interchange, which connects Jiangsu S005 and G205 National Highway, and begins its concurrence with Jiangsu S105. G4211 is then connected to G2501 via two <b>trumpet</b> <b>interchanges</b> and a connector. From there, the expressway runs parallel to G205, {{as well as the}} Nanjing-Wuhu Railway. The route crosses Jiangsu-Anhui border at an exit to G205 and enters Ma'anshan, Anhui.|$|R
5|$|Beyond the Upper Ottawa Street crossing, {{residential}} {{developments are}} confined to {{the north side of}} the Linc as it curves southward, descending towards the top of the Red Hill Valley. Surrounded by undeveloped land, it meets the northern end of Dartnall Road at a <b>trumpet</b> <b>interchange,</b> with Mt. Albion Conservation Area to the southeast and the Red Hill Creek passing beneath the interchange to traverse the Niagara Escarpment at Albion Falls. The Linc gradually curves back northeast, now surrounded, passing under Pritchard Road. Immediately east of there, the Mud Street interchange branches off as the route curves northward and becomes the Red Hill Valley Parkway, which descends the escarpment towards the QEW.|$|E
5|$|MD 10 {{continues}} {{north from}} MD 177 through {{the east side}} of Glen Burnie as a six-lane freeway. The highway crosses over Marley Creek and has a partial cloverleaf interchange with MD 648 (BaltimoreAnnapolis Boulevard). MD 10 parallels MD 270 (Furnace Branch Road) north then meets the latter highway at a partial cloverleaf interchange. The highway crosses Furnace Branch and has a partial cloverleaf interchange with MD 710 (Ordnance Road), where northbound MD 10 becomes two lanes wide. MD 10 reaches its northern terminus at a <b>trumpet</b> <b>interchange</b> with I-695 (Baltimore Beltway). The sweeping ramp from MD 10 to westbound I-695 merges into a collector-distributor lane that allows access from MD 10 to northbound MD 2 in Brooklyn Park.|$|E
5|$|MD32 heads {{west from}} Odenton along the {{southern}} edge of Fort George G. Meade. The freeway has a dumbbell interchange with MD198 (Laurel Fort Meade Road) just north of Tipton Airport. MD32 curves northwest and has an interchange with Samford Road, which is one of two interchanges that provide access to the NSA. The median of MD32 widens at the interchange as the eastbound ramps enter and exit on the left to a roundabout, from which Samford Road crosses the westbound lanes of MD32. Immediately to the north of a <b>trumpet</b> <b>interchange</b> with Canine Road, which provides access to the NSA, the National Vigilance Park, and the National Cryptologic Museum, the freeway has a cloverleaf interchange with the BaltimoreWashington Parkway.|$|E
5|$|The A3 {{motorway}} {{consists of}} two traffic lanes and an emergency lane in each driving direction along its entire length. As of September 2010, the motorway has 21 interchanges, providing access to numerous towns and cities and the Croatian state road network. Almost all of the existing <b>interchanges</b> are <b>trumpet</b> <b>interchanges,</b> except for Lučko, which is a stack interchange, and Jankomir, Kosnica, Ivanja Reka and Sredanci, which are cloverleaf interchanges. The motorway follows Pan-European Corridor X, and forms junctions with Pan-European Corridors Vb and Vc within Croatia.|$|R
5000|$|Various {{forms of}} parclo {{interchanges}} are {{used on the}} North Luzon Expressway in the Philippines. The configuration of parclo interchanges (particularly those of the [...] "folded diamond" [...] type) allows for the consolidation of toll barriers at points where onramps and offramps run alongside each other. A single large barrier can serve each onramp/offramp pair simultaneously, reducing construction and operation expenses at through junctions. When possible, such as at terminal junctions, <b>trumpet</b> <b>interchanges</b> are preferred since they only require one large toll barrier for all four on/off-ramps.|$|R
5|$|Eleven {{interchanges}} {{were built}} along the turnpike, {{most of which}} were <b>trumpet</b> <b>interchanges</b> where all ramps merge at the toll booths; only the New Stanton, Carlisle and Middlesex interchanges did not follow this design. Lighting was installed approaching interchanges, along with acceleration and deceleration lanes. The road also featured guardrails, consisting of steel panels attached to I-beams. Large exit signs were used, and road signs had cat's-eye reflectors to increase visibility at night; billboards were prohibited. In September 1940, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission ruled that trucks and buses would be allowed to use the highway.|$|R
5|$|Opening of the firstand onlypiece of the Laguna Freeway {{was celebrated}} in Laguna Beach on October 1, 1952, {{connecting}} {{the north end}} of Laguna Canyon with a planned extension of the Santa Ana Freeway at a <b>trumpet</b> <b>interchange</b> and bypassing the old route on Sand Canyon Avenue. There were initially no other interchanges along the route. The state decided not to build the remainder of the freeway in late 1975, and in 1996 the portion south of SR 73 was removed from the Freeway and Expressway System. Widening of the part north of SR 73 to a four-lane expressway was completed in late 2006, moving the road out of the canyon bottom and allowing better access to areas in Laguna Coast Wilderness Park.|$|E
5|$|Route 25 {{begins at}} a <b>trumpet</b> <b>interchange</b> with I-495 and I-195 in Wareham, Massachusetts; the two left lanes of Route 25 west {{mainline}} onto Route 495 north, with the right-hand lane serving I-195 via Exit 1. From I-195, Route 25 east is accessible via Exit 22A; I-195 terminates at the interchange. Interstate 495 also terminates at its junction with Route 25; the two southbound lanes of I-495 default onto Route 25 east. After the interchange with I-195 and I-495, Route 25 begins to {{head in a}} southeastern direction into the town of Wareham as a six-lane freeway. The route passes under Tihonet Road and through Maple Swamp, located at {{the northern end of}} Parker Mills Pond.|$|E
5|$|The Meadowbrook State Parkway {{begins at}} a {{cloverleaf}} interchange with the Ocean Parkway and Bay Parkway on Jones Beach Island {{in the town}} of Hempstead. The parkway briefly proceeds northwest through Jones Beach before turning northward and crossing South Oyster Bay on a six-lane causeway. After crossing the bay, the Meadowbrook reaches exitM10, a <b>trumpet</b> <b>interchange</b> with Loop Parkway. In the middle of exitM10 is a southbound-only toll barrier used to charge for access to Jones Beach. After Loop Parkway, the Meadowbrook heads northwest across another water channel and becomes a divided highway with a large center median. A third bridge over a waterway soon follows, bringing the Meadowbrook Parkway onto the mainland part of Long Island near the Norman J. Levy Park and Preserve.|$|E
50|$|There are {{no traffic}} {{lights on the}} expressways. At an {{interchange}} with another road, an expressway is connected to it via slip roads. This allows traffic to change routes without having to stop or slow down. Due {{to the need to}} conserve space in land-scarce Singapore, there are no cloverleaf interchanges on the entire island. Instead, traffic efficiency and land space are maximized by having traffic lights on terrestrial roads, as well as the usage of interchanges such as stack interchanges. The most common forms of highway-road or highway-highway intersections are single-point urban, diamond, and <b>trumpet</b> <b>interchanges.</b>|$|R
5|$|The A2 {{motorway}} has {{at least}} two traffic lanes and an emergency lane in each direction along its entire length, except in tunnels, where there are emergency bays instead. All of the <b>interchanges</b> are <b>trumpet</b> <b>interchanges,</b> except the Jankomir interchange, which is a cloverleaf interchange. There {{are a number of}} rest areas along the motorway providing various types of services, ranging from simple parking spaces and restrooms to filling stations, restaurants and hotels. As of July 2011, the motorway has seven interchanges providing access to numerous towns and cities and the Croatian state road network. The motorway is operated by the Autocesta Zagreb–Macelj company.|$|R
5|$|The {{cities and}} towns with an {{immediate}} connection to the A5 include Đakovo via the D7 and Čepin via the Ž4105 county road. The A5 motorway consists of two traffic lanes and an emergency lane in each driving direction, with carriageways separated by the median. All existing <b>interchanges</b> are <b>trumpet</b> <b>interchanges,</b> except for Sredanci, which is a cloverleaf. The A5 features a number of rest areas which provide various services including restrooms, filling stations and restaurants. The motorway has four interchanges, providing access to several towns and cities and the Croatian state road network. The motorway is maintained and operated by the state-owned management company Hrvatske autoceste.|$|R
5|$|The Thruway {{continues}} north {{through the}} river valley toward Harriman, where it encounters the Woodbury toll barrier, the southeastern {{end of the}} mainline's major closed ticket system. The barrier {{is located on the}} mainline within exit16 (NY17), a <b>trumpet</b> <b>interchange.</b> Along with the mainline barrier in Harriman, a separate toll plaza exists on the exit16 ramp midway between the Thruway and NY17 exit131 (NY32). Now a completely tolled highway, the Thruway heads northward, roughly paralleling the Hudson River to the river's west as it serves the city of Newburgh, the village of New Paltz, and the city of Kingston, indirectly connecting to the short I-587 in the latter.|$|E
5|$|The older {{route through}} {{downtown}} is a one-way pair on Sixth (southbound) and Seventh (northbound) Streets, entirely overlapping OR 99 to I-5 exit 58, where OR 99 continues with I-5 to the north. The Caveman Bridge, a concrete through arch bridge built in 1927, carries Sixth Street over the Rogue River, while the parallel Seventh Street Bridge is a utilitarian bridge from 1960. The Grants Pass Parkway (Redwood Spur) also crosses the river on a four-lane bridge built in 1990; before that bypass was completed, the spur began downtown on E (southbound) and F (northbound) Streets. Soon after {{the old and}} new routes join, the spur ends at a <b>trumpet</b> <b>interchange</b> with I-5 (exit 55).|$|E
5|$|The turnpike's first exit in {{the city}} is Exit 414, a diamond {{interchange}} with 78th Street. Next, the highway curves slightly to the northeast and intersects the Turner Diagonal at Exit 415, an interchange consisting of a half-cloverleaf for the western ramps and a Y-connection for the eastern ramps that intersects the Turner Diagonal at a <b>trumpet</b> <b>interchange</b> north of the turnpike. East of here, the route has a diamond interchange with 57th Street at Exit 417. Directly east of 57th Street, the turnpike crosses Brenner Heights Creek. After this, the turnpike continues due east to a fully directional interchange with I-635 at Exit 418.|$|E
50|$|In Shanghai Municipality, the G42 is an eight-lane {{expressway}} which concurs with G2 Beijing-Shanghai Expressway for {{its entire}} length, {{and has a}} speed limit of 120 km/h. The expressway begins at Wuning Road Interchange in Shanghai Middle Ring Road, traveling eastbound. Soon after the intersection with the S20 Shanghai Outer Ring Expressway in Jiading District, the expressway becomes a tollway at Jiangqiao toll plaza. In Qingpu District, it intersects with G15 Shenyang-Haikou Expressway via a partial cloverleaf interchange. At Anting Town, the G42 connects with G1501 Shanghai Ring Expressway through a brief connector and two <b>trumpet</b> <b>interchanges,</b> then intersects with the G1501 via an overpass and enters Kunshan, Jiangsu.|$|R
50|$|Like a {{directional}} T interchange, a semi-directional T interchange uses flyover/underpass ramps in {{all directions}} at a three-way interchange. However, in a semi-directional T some of the splits and merges are switched to avoid ramps {{to and from the}} passing lane, eliminating the major disadvantage of the directional T. Semi-directional T interchanges are generally safe and efficient, though being three-level interchanges they do require more land and are costlier than <b>trumpet</b> <b>interchanges.</b> Semi-directional T interchanges are built as two or three-level stacks. Three-level stacks may use an overpass and underpass at a single point. Two-level stacks have a longer bridge or two shorter bridges on the same roadway.|$|R
50|$|The A2 {{motorway}} has {{at least}} two traffic lanes and an emergency lane in each direction along its entire length, except in tunnels, where there are emergency bays instead.
