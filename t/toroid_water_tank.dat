The work includes {{the design and}} estimates for circular R. C. C. <b>water</b> <b>tanks</b> and prestressed concrete <b>water</b> <b>tanks</b> of various diameter. At times the more than one choice available for construction types leads to confusion. The best way is to select the type of construction, depending on the circumstances and type of structure. The aim {{of this paper is}} to design medium diameter R. C. C <b>water</b> <b>tanks</b> as well as pre-stress concrete <b>water</b> <b>tanks</b> variety and then compare the results. Programming in MS EXCEL is done to design the <b>water</b> <b>tanks.</b> The idea is to reach a definite conclusion regarding the superiority of the two techniques over one another. Results reveal that an RCC <b>water</b> <b>tank</b> is cheaper than prestress concrete <b>water</b> <b>tank</b> for smaller diameter but vice versa is true for larger diameter tanks...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: <b>Water</b> <b>tanks</b> are liquid storage {{containers}}. These containers {{are used}} for storing <b>water.</b> <b>Water</b> <b>tanks</b> are traditionally designed by working stress method. As per revised IS 3370 <b>water</b> <b>tank</b> can also be designed by limit state method. In this dissertation <b>water</b> <b>tanks</b> are designed by both working stress method and limit state method. Circular and square <b>water</b> <b>tank</b> are considered. Detailed analysis and design is done. Working drawings are prepared for all conditions. For understanding the financial implications quantities for concrete and steel were calculated. Exact amount of steel required is calculated for each case as per working drawings. It was observed that in case of limit state design cost required is less. Obviously circular <b>water</b> <b>tank</b> is more economical compare to square tank. Index Terms-Water tanks, working stress, limit state. <b>Water</b> <b>tank</b> are liquid storage containers.

40|$|Abstract. The {{present study}} {{examines}} {{the characteristics of}} rectangular and circular tuned liquid dampers, which control wind-induced vibration in tall buildings, according to the natural frequency. The tuned liquid dampers (TLD) were of frequencies: 0. 44 Hz, 0. 55 Hz, 0. 64 Hz and 0. 73 Hz. The tuning feature of TLD <b>water</b> <b>tanks</b> was better in circular <b>water</b> <b>tanks</b> than in rectangular <b>water</b> <b>tanks.</b> Excitation amplitude affected the damping ratio based on energy dissipation capacity. At low excitation (below 5 mm) and low natural frequency (0. 44 Hz), circular <b>water</b> <b>tanks</b> were advantageous over rectangular <b>water</b> <b>tanks.</b> However, at high excitation (over 5 mm) and high natural frequency (over 0. 55 Hz), rectangular <b>water</b> <b>tanks</b> were advantageous over circular <b>water</b> <b>tanks...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{consumption of}} drinking water puts a heavy burden on our future water resources. Therefore the reuse of rain water in households {{can be a good}} option to tackle this problem. On the other hand the rapidly drained rain water leads to problems in the combined sewer systems and watercourses. If the storage in the rain <b>water</b> <b>tanks</b> can be used to flatten the rain water runoff, rain <b>water</b> <b>tanks</b> can have an additional benefit. The effect of rain <b>water</b> <b>tanks</b> on the combined sewer overflow (CSO) emissions is therefore investigated with a reservoir model. Compared with storage in the combined sewer system or at the overflow, storage in rain <b>water</b> <b>tanks</b> will be more efficient in reducing the overflow emissions. However much more storage in rain <b>water</b> <b>tanks</b> must be provided to obtain the same overflow frequency as when downstream storage is used, because the storage in rain <b>water</b> <b>tanks</b> is less frequently available. When all the economical, social and environmental aspects are considered, rain <b>water</b> <b>tanks</b> can certainly be promoted as a good solution. (C) 1999 IAWQ Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

They are used to store water for various purposes like drinking, fire fighting, etc and are vulnerable in resisting earthquake forces due to presence of large mass on a slender staging [...] Further, the supporting structures i. e. the staggings {{have been found to}} be extremely susceptible to earthquake forces, sometimes leading to collapse of <b>water</b> <b>tanks.</b> Bhuj earthquake is an epitome of this hazard. Further, in view of the limitations of IS 1893 -part 2 with respect to the international practice for seismic resistant design of <b>water</b> <b>tanks,</b> IITK-GSDMA has presented certain additional guidelines. This study is mainly focused in understanding the seismic behaviour and vulnerability of elevated reinforced concrete <b>water</b> <b>tanks</b> and supporting structures for various seismic intensities, soil conditions, staging heights etc. with respect to the provisions of IS 1893 Part 2 and guidelines proposed by IITK-GSDMA. Finite element modelling and dynamic analysis of elevated <b>water</b> <b>tanks</b> has been performed using SAP 2000. Since available earthquake data is not adequate, response spectrum analysis has been carried out to understand the seismic behaviour of <b>water</b> <b>tanks.</b> Further, Nonlinear static analysis has been performed to assess the ductility characteristics of the <b>water</b> <b>tank</b> for varying staging heights, for a given capacity of <b>water</b> <b>tank</b> (Empty and Full water level conditions).
