John's sitting area is {{revealed}} to be a lift, which they use to leave the factory. The tech team tracks the video's source and Rigg leads his team to a house, where they find VCRs playing previously recorded images. As Kerry realizes the game took place before they found John, the timer expires and a large safe opens, revealing Daniel bound and breathing into an oxygen mask. Eric enters the house alone and eventually locates the bathroom, where he is attacked by a pig-masked figure. He awakens shackled at the ankle to a pipe; a tape recorder left by Amanda reveals that she is John's accomplice and intends to continue his work after he dies.

5|$|The {{southern}} side of {{the church}} has nine bays, again divided by buttresses. In the third bay from the west is a porch. The other bays each contain a two-light window with trefoil heads. The porch is in two storeys, with angle buttresses and a battlemented parapet with gargoyles. The lower storey contains a doorway with a pointed arch, and the upper storey has a two-light window. <b>The</b> <b>doorway</b> <b>and</b> window are set slightly {{to the west of}} the centre, as the east wall contains a stairway. Inside the porch are stone seats and the remains of two stoups (holy water fonts). The staircase leading to the upper storey is composed of old gravestones. On the outer wall of the upper storey is a sundial. The west end of the church is in Perpendicular style, and has five bays. At its centre is another porch, this one with three storeys. At the west front are diagonal buttresses, and in the bottom storey is a double doorway, over which is a canopied niche containing the weathered image of a saint. In the middle storey is a three-light window, in the top storey a two-light window, and at the summit is a battlemented parapet. There are windows in the north and south faces of the top stage, and on the north side is an octagonal stair turret. Inside the porch are four corbels (supporting brackets) carved with musicians. On each {{side of the}} porch is a four-light window. At the west end of the north aisle is a four-light window, and a five-light window is at the end of the south aisle.|$|E

25|$|There is {{a second}} {{entrance}} with modest dimensions in the east wall. On {{the outside of the}} building the doorway is positioned above some projecting stonework that may have been intended as the bonding to a curtain wall that was never built. The entrance was perhaps originally served by a wooden staircase but when the gatehouse was constructed it gave direct access to the châtelain's residence. <b>The</b> <b>doorway</b> <b>and</b> four of the niches were blocked {{at the beginning of the}} 18th century when the two upper floors of the tower was used as a prison.

500|$|The chapel was {{designed}} by William Smith, and was remodelled in 1887. [...] It {{is dedicated to the}} Holy Trinity. [...] The chapel is built in brick on a stone plinth with stone dressings and a slate roof, and consists of a three-bay nave and an apsidal chancel, with a bell turret. <b>The</b> <b>doorway</b> <b>and</b> the windows are round-headed, and around the top of the chapel is a cornice and a balustrade with square piers capped by swagged ball finials. [...] Inside the chapel the original box pews were replaced by facing pews in college style. [...] At the west end is a raised family pew. [...] On the walls are terracotta panels by George Tinworth. [...] The reredos is in mosaic with an alabaster surround, it was made by Salviati and is loosely based on Giotto's Dormition. [...] To the southwest of the chapel are gates and gate piers. [...] The gate piers date from the 20thcentury, and the gates from about 1750. [...] The piers are in brick on stone plinths and have stepped stone caps with ball finials. The gates are in wrought iron and were made in Milan. [...] They are wide with arched centres and contain Rococo panels depicting Saint Andrew with his cross.|$|E
500|$|Instead, the {{congregation}} raised {{funds for a}} second building, and in 1928–1929 built the six-story Temple House (used for all congregational activities) on the corner opposite the main sanctuary. Designed by Mortimer Freehof and David Levy, the cast stone building's architectural style was [...] "Jewish Deco", a mix of Romanesque Revival and Art Deco decorative forms that was common in Jewish buildings of the period. Romanesque features included the s, while a prominent Art Deco feature was [...] "the figure of Moses and the Tablets of Law, emphasizing {{the corner of the}} roof parapet." [...] <b>The</b> <b>doorway</b> <b>and</b> balcony at the east end of the building had [...] "a distinctly Moorish flavor, featuring symbolic ornament: the Star of David, the Menorah, and the Lion of Judah." [...] The names of major figures from the Tanakh (Hebrew Bible) were inscribed on the Garfield Place facade, and the Biblical verses [...] "SHOW ME THY WAYS O LORD TEACH ME THY PATHS GUIDE ME" [...] (...) on the Eighth Avenue facade. The building was also decorated with bas-reliefs of Jonah being swallowed by a great fish and Babylonian charioteers. It housed a 125-seat chapel, a large ballroom, social halls, class rooms for the religious school, meeting rooms, administrative offices, a library, handball courts, a gymnasium, and a swimming pool.|$|E
500|$|But {{there are}} other {{explanations}} for the missing rations. The inexperienced New Guinea Force staff assumed that the supplies they despatched would arrive, but this {{was far from the}} case with air dropping, the techniques for which had yet to be properly developed. Kienzle picked what he thought were good drop zones, but the air crews sometimes found them restricted or dangerous. The aircraft had to fly low over the drop zone, at about , and slow, at about [...] They had to take the wind into account, as it might cause parachuted packages to miss the drop zone. The load would be placed in <b>the</b> <b>doorway,</b> <b>and</b> three or four men would push it out when the pilot gave the signal. The pilot would fly level or with the nose slightly down, so that cargo would not hit the tail of the aircraft. The pilot would retract the landing gear if it was down, and climb to gain altitude. Multiple passes over the drop zone might be required. Heavy loads were not practical for air dropping missions, since the aircraft had to arrive low and slow over the drop zone, but higher speed was required for greater weight. Nor could an overloaded aircraft climb or dive quickly. The 21st and 22nd Troop Carrier Squadrons were still based in Queensland and not at Port Moresby, so the aircrew were there on short rotations. Their learning process was therefore fitful and slow. Men from various Army and RAAF units assisted the aircrew in the task of pushing stores out of the aircraft.|$|E

500|$|Cave 17 {{comprises}} {{a series}} of three small dwellings located along a row with a shared veranda. The first dwelling has a doorway flanked by broken windows on either side, leading to a middle room. The back room of the middle dwelling has a cell to the right and a half cell to the left. A window is located to left of door to the cell. The cell also has traces of painting. The half cell has a bench. The second dwelling has a middle room, a half cell to the left, and a cell, reached from the right of the half cell. The middle room has a bench. The half cell has a recess in its back wall, along with a bench. A grooved door leads from the half-cell to the cell, which also has a bench. A window in the right cell overlooks in to the middle room. In front of the doorway is a bench. The third and largest of the three dwellings consists of a middle hall. At the back wall of the hall there are two cells and two seat recesses. Along the right and rear walls runs a bench. The right cell as well as the left cell have grooved doorways, a window to the left of <b>the</b> <b>doorway</b> <b>and</b> a bench along each of their rear walls. In front of the hall door is a bench. In front of the broken veranda are holes for fixing wooden pillars. To the left of the veranda are two cisterns. Between cave 17 and cave 18, there are three other cisterns. In the recess of the first cistern, an inscription reads translated: [...] "A meritorious gift of a cistern by Saghaka a goldsmith, son of Kudira of Kalyana." [...] Another inscription in the recess of the second cistern reads translated: [...] "A meritorious gift of a cistern by Lachhinika (wife) of Torika the Na daka [...] Nadabalika, wife of Isimulasami." ...|$|E

2500|$|Seven of {{the houses}} have similar furniture, with the beds and dresser in the same places in each house. The dresser stands against the wall {{opposite}} the door, {{and was the first}} thing seen by anyone entering the dwelling. Each of these houses had the larger bed {{on the right side of}} <b>the</b> <b>doorway</b> <b>and</b> the smaller on the left. Lloyd Laing noted that this pattern accorded with Hebridean custom up to the early 20thcentury suggesting that the husband's bed was the larger and the wife's was the smaller. The discovery of beads and paint-pots in some of the smaller beds may support this interpretation. Additional support may come from the recognition that stone boxes lie to the left of most doorways, forcing the person entering the house to turn to the right-hand, [...] "male", side of the dwelling. At the front of each bed lie the stumps of stone pillars that may have supported a canopy of fur; another link with recent Hebridean style.|$|E
