5|$|In 2015, the Canadian Gaming Association {{commissioned}} {{an opinion}} on the legality of DFS in Canada from former Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario general counsel Don Bourgeois. He determined that DFS would likely be classified as a game of chance under Canadian law, going on to say {{in an interview that}} under the Criminal Code of Canada, games <b>that</b> <b>mix</b> chance- and skill-based elements are considered games of chance. However, Canadian authorities have not yet targeted DFS services; historically, the government has only targeted illegal gambling operations that have a presence within the country. While the service Sport Select offers legal sports wagering games through Canada's lotteries, it is subject to a legal prohibition on wagering on individual sporting events.|$|E
5|$|They {{followed}} {{next with}} Tenure in 2002, the double album Dilapidated Beauty in 2003, and The Road to Ellenside in 2006. In a review for Molinos, {{it was noted}} that The Paperboys consistently write pop songs with melodic hooks, which other prior Irish-rock inspired bands such as The Pogues and Oysterband, and others were not always successful at. Postcards, which has songs that range musically from bluegrass, zydeco, flamenco, Irish traditional, country, to Celtic-new-age-Native, and with songs <b>that</b> <b>mix</b> some of the themes, was described as a satisfying example of how far the versatile scope of The Paperboys' music extends.|$|E

25|$|James Vance, Tulsa World (April 22, 2001) — Stout's {{books are}} mysteries, but they're {{invariably}} {{more about the}} people involved than the mysteries themselves. Hutton, an Academy Award–winning actor (for 1980's Ordinary People), is ideal casting for Archie, and the lesser-known Chaykin is a surprisingly satisfactory choice to flesh out the combination of growls and tics that make up Nero Wolfe. To <b>that</b> <b>mix</b> Hutton and his partners in production have added the concept of repertory casting that will see the same nucleus of performers returning in different roles each week.|$|E
25|$|Goregrind, deathgrind and pornogrind are styles <b>that</b> <b>mix</b> the intensity, speed, and brevity of grindcore {{with the}} {{complexity}} of death metal. They differ from death metal in that guitar solos are often a rarity, shrieked vocals are more prominent as the main vocal (though death growls are still utilized and some deathgrind bands {{make more use of}} the latter vocal style), and songs are generally shorter in length, usually between one and three minutes that keep with grindcore's tradition of short time lengths in songs. All three of these styles differ from grindcore in the more technical approach and less evident hardcore punk influence and aesthetics. Some notable examples of deathgrind are Brujeria, Cattle Decapitation, Cephalic Carnage, Pig Destroyer, Circle of Dead Children, Rotten Sound, Gut and Cock and Ball Torture.|$|E

[...] Of her [...] "Rose's Turn", Gans wrote: [...] "...her rendition of this song may be the highlight of a career already filled with many highlights: She has taken a song that has been delivered incredibly by others and brought it to a new level." [...] Of her performance on the recording of Follies (2011), Steven Suskin wrote in Playbill.com: [...] "This is a fine Sally, the sort of Sally you'd expect to get from an actress like – well, Bernadette Peters.

500|$|The first {{additional}} gait is a four-beat lateral ambling gait {{known as}} the tölt. This {{is known for its}} explosive acceleration and speed; it is also comfortable and ground-covering. There is considerable variation in style within the gait, and thus the tölt is variously compared to similar lateral gaits such as the rack of the Saddlebred, the largo of the Paso Fino, or the running walk of the Tennessee Walking Horse. Like all lateral ambling gaits, the footfall pattern {{is the same as the}} walk (left hind, left front, right hind, right front), but differs from the walk in that it can be performed at a range of speeds, from the speed of a typical fast walk up to the speed of a normal canter. Some Icelandic horses prefer to tölt, while others prefer to trot; correct training can improve weak gaits, but the tölt is a natural gait present from birth. There are two varieties of the tölt that are considered incorrect by breeders. The first is an uneven gait called a [...] "Pig's Pace" [...] or [...] "Piggy-pace" [...] that is closer to a two-beat pace than a four-beat amble. The second is called a Valhopp and is a tölt and canter combination most often seen in untrained young horses or horses <b>that</b> <b>mix</b> their gaits. Both varieties are normally uncomfortable to ride.|$|E
500|$|The {{humor of}} the show comes from the [...] "disparity" [...] between the [...] "cute" [...] {{appearance}} of the characters and their [...] "crude" [...] behavior. However, Parker and Stone said in an early interview that the show's language is realistic. [...] "There are so many shows where little kids are good and sweet, and it's just not real... Don't people remember what they were like in third grade? We were little bastards." [...] Frederic Biddle of The Boston Globe notes how the show [...] "constantly plays on its grade-school aesthetic for shock value, with great success", arguing that at its height, it is [...] "more a profane 'Peanuts' than a downsized 'Beavis and Butt-Head.'" [...] He points, for example, to Kenny, who symbolically represents the voiceless underclass, which is eliminated in each episode. Claire Bickley of the Toronto Sun explains that [...] "The show captures <b>that</b> <b>mix</b> of innocence and viciousness that can co-exist in kids that age", that [...] "the boys are fascinated by bodily functions", and that they [...] "mimic adult behavior and language". For example, Kyle instructs Stan and Wendy to [...] "make sweet love down by the fire", a phrase he learns from Chef. In a light-hearted study of the humor of flatulence, Jim Dawson explains how the rise of adult animation in the 1990s allowed television to indulge in such humor with The Ren & Stimpy Show, The Simpsons, and Beavis and Butt-Head. Beginning with [...] "Cartman Gets an Anal Probe", South Park builds on this tradition.|$|E
500|$|In 1982, owners began blood-typing their horses, and by 1990, {{genetic testing}} found that [...] "compared with other draft breeds and based upon gene marker data, the Creams form a {{distinct}} group within the draft horses." [...] The American Cream Draft {{was found to}} have a genetic relationship with the Belgian breed that was no closer than the ones it had with the Percheron, Suffolk Punch and Haflinger breeds. Registry records dating to the early 20th century show no bloodlines other than draft breeding. [...] As of 2000 there were 222 registered horses, a number that increased to 350 as of 2004. Of these, 40 were [...] "tracking horses"– either purebred American Creams that did not meet color requirements or crossbred horses <b>that</b> <b>mix</b> American Cream and other draft blood, but still meet the physical requirements for the registry. These tracking horses are allowed by certain regulations to be used as breeding stock, with the resulting foals able to be registered as purebred American Creams. Around 30 new horses are registered each year. The Livestock Conservancy considers the breed to be at [...] "critical" [...] status, meaning that the estimated global population of the breed is less than 2,000 and there are less than 200 registrations annually in the US. The Equus Survival Trust also considers the population to be [...] "critical", meaning that there are between 100 and 300 active adult breeding mares in existence today. [...] To help replenish numbers, the ACDHA has developed regulations to permit foals to be registered when produced via methods such as artificial insemination and embryo transfer. Careful use of the appendix registry also allows numbers to increase.|$|E

500|$|Commentators commended {{the first}} half of [...] "Space Race". The A.V. Club {{columnist}} Todd VanDerWerff approved of several aspects of the episode—mainly its animation, character development, and dialogue. In his A grade review, VanDerWerff felt that the producers were playful with the concepts of space. [...] "Archer, of course, takes place in a weird blend of past and present," [...] he professed, [...] "but 'Space Race' goes {{out of its way to}} toss 'future' into the middle of <b>that</b> <b>mix</b> as well. There are so many jokes that come just from the characters hanging out in anti-gravity, for God's sake, including a ping pong paddle strategically covering Pam's breasts." [...] Commenting on the program's animation, The A.V. Club journalist thought that its emphasis on the convergence of various science fiction techniques resulted in aesthetically pleasing visuals. VanDerWerff stated, [...] "Everything about this one gleams, and it makes for an Archer that will almost certainly look great in HD." [...] Furthermore, he adulated the episode's dialogue, avouching that even the characters with very limited screen time were given opportunities to shine with humor. Although Marcos Canales of Screen Invasion opined that [...] "Space Race: Part I" [...] contained far too many one-liners and jokes, he praised the storyline and was keen to the character progression of Lana. [...] "Usually, she’s the best agent ISIS has and can do pretty much anything," [...] explained Canales, [...] "so putting her in a situation where she was not a bad ass gave the character some added depth which is something most animated shows don’t prioritize." [...] Cinema Blend's Jesse Carp—despite criticizing the show's [...] "nonsensical" [...] narrative—declared it to be hilarious.|$|E
500|$|Tom Laskin of Isthmus {{wrote that}} the {{significant}} [...] "sonic tweaking and abundant sampling" [...] of Version 2.0 is discarded as the songs are supported primarily by [...] "bass, drum, and guitar configurations".

[...] He added that, overall, the album is [...] "far less commercially accommodating {{than any of the}} band's previous work. It embraces no particular sound or style. It comes across with ideas and commentary that challenge rather than coerce, and the playing lacks the burnished, artificial quality that's characteristic of so much youth-oriented music these days." [...] Peter Robinson of the NME {{wrote that the}} album was a [...] "departure from the sound Garbage had established on their first two records"; It is [...] "marked by expanding on the musical variety, with stronger melodies, more direct lyrics, and sounds <b>that</b> <b>mix</b> rock with hip hop, electronica, new wave, and girl groups." [...] Sound on Sound described the band's approach to recording guitars as [...] "distinctive", observing the [...] "distorted crunches cheek-by-jowl with delicate acoustics and treated sounds which are almost unrecognizable." [...] Michael Paoletta of Billboard noted that audiences expecting [...] "more of the same [...] are in for a wonderful surprise." [...] The band eschews [...] "disco-infused electronica foundations for more straight-up rock'n'pop". [...] "Modern tales for modern times, sung by the vocally versatile Manson, make for one of the year's best." [...] Q described it as [...] "sharp, seductive music from a band at their peak."

In a DVD review of the first season, David B. Grelck gave the episode a rating of 2.5/5, adding: [...] "While the laughs are a bit dry in this episode, the over the top plot is indicative of zaniness to come." [...] Colin Jacobson at DVD Movie Guide said in a review that [...] "it’s clear that the writers had started to find their groove by the time this episode was produced. From start to finish, 'Crepes' offered a solid experience, as the show began to feature more style and subtlety." [...] Scott Collura at Hollywood Video praised the episode in a review, saying [...] "it {{is one of the best}} of the first season." [...] In 1997, David Bauder from TV Guide named this episode the greatest episode of The Simpsons, and the 17th greatest episode of any television show of all time. In 2006, IGN listed [...] "The Crepes of Wrath" [...] as the best episode of the first season, saying it [...] "features a strong central storyline, with Bart being shipped off to France as an exchange student and being forced to work for two unscrupulous winemakers <b>that</b> <b>mix</b> antifreeze in their wine."
