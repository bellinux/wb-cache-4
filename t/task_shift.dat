40|$|This paper {{reports a}} study that was aimed to {{rehabilitate}} executive functions in CHI patients. When a subject is engaged in two speeded tasks, not simultaneously but with some form of alternation, the response is slower to an item of task A if it was preceded by an item of task B, than when it was preceded by an item of task A. This shift cost is small when subjects can prepare in advance for the new task (endogenous <b>task</b> <b>shift),</b> whereas the cost is much greater when preparation is not possible (exogenous <b>task</b> <b>shift).</b> The groups tested comprised 20 severe closed head injury (CHI) patients (10 who underwent treatment and 10 controls), 8 mild CHI patients, and 18 non-brain damaged (NBD) controls. In the present study, the shift cost was greater for severe CHI patients than for NBD controls. Treatment consisted of five sessions, in which an endogenous <b>task</b> <b>shift</b> paradigm was used. A significant reduction of the endogenous shift cost from assessment to retest was found. The reduction remained stable at the 4 -month follow-up session. These results are not simply due to retesting, as the control patients did not show any improvement at retest. Interestingly, no reduction of exogenous <b>task</b> <b>shift</b> cost was found. The results showed also that the beneficial effect of the treatment generalises to other executive functions...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Uganda has {{a severe}} health worker {{shortage}} {{and a high}} demand for health care services. This study aimed to assess the policy and programmatic implications of <b>task</b> <b>shifting</b> in Uganda. Methods This was a qualitative, descriptive study through 34 key informant interviews and eight (8) focus group discussions, with participants from various levels of the health system. Results Policy makers understood <b>task</b> <b>shifting,</b> but front-line health workers had misconceptions on the meaning and intention(s) of <b>task</b> <b>shifting.</b> Examples were cited of <b>task</b> <b>shifting</b> within the Ugandan health system, some formalized (e. g. psychiatric clinical officers), and some informal ones (e. g. nurses inserting IV lines and initiating treatment). There was apparently high acceptance of <b>task</b> <b>shifting</b> in HIV/AIDS service delivery, with involvement of community health workers (CHW) and PLWHA in care and support of AIDS patients. There was no written policy or guidelines on <b>task</b> <b>shifting,</b> but the policy environment was reportedly conducive with plans to develop a policy and guidelines on <b>task</b> <b>shifting.</b> Factors favouring <b>task</b> <b>shifting</b> included successful examples of <b>task</b> <b>shifting,</b> proper referral channels, the need for services, scarcity of skills and focused initiatives such as home based management of fever. Barriers to <b>task</b> <b>shifting</b> included reluctance to change, protection of professional turf, professional boundaries and regulations, heavy workload and high disease burden, poor planning, lack of a <b>task</b> <b>shifting</b> champion, lack of guidelines, the name <b>task</b> <b>shifting</b> itself, and unemployed health professionals. There were {{both positive and negative}} views on task shifting: the positive ones cast <b>task</b> <b>shifting</b> as one of the solutions to the dual problem of lack of skills and high demand for service, and as something that is already happening; while negative ones saw it as a quick fix intended for the poor, a threat to quality care and likely to compromise the health system. Conclusion There were widespread examples of task in Uganda, and <b>task</b> <b>shifting</b> was mainly attributed to HRH shortages coupled with the high demand for healthcare services. There is need for clear policy and guidelines to regulate <b>task</b> <b>shifting</b> and protect those who undertake delegated tasks. </p...|$|R

40|$|Background: <b>Task</b> <b>shifting</b> {{has been}} {{suggested}} {{to meet the demand}} for initiating and managing more patients on antiretroviral therapy. Although the idea of <b>task</b> <b>shifting</b> is not new, it acquires new relevance in the context of current healthcare delivery. Aim: To appraise current trends in <b>task</b> <b>shifting</b> related to HIV treatment programmes in order to evaluate evidence related to the effectiveness of this strategy in addressing human resource constraints and improving patient outcomes, challenges identified in practice and the acceptability of this strategy to the health professions. Method: Electronic databases were searched for studies published in English between January 2009 and December 2014. Keywords such as ‘task shifting’, ‘HIV treatment’, ‘human resources’ and ‘health professions’ were used. Results: Evidence suggests that <b>task</b> <b>shifting</b> is an effective strategy for addressing human resource constraints in healthcare systems in many countries and provides a cost-effective approach without compromising patient outcomes. Challenges include inadequate supervision support and mentoring, absent regulatory frameworks, a lack of general health system strengthening and the need for monitoring and evaluation. The strategy generally seems to be accepted by the health professions although several arguments against <b>task</b> <b>shifting</b> as a long-term approach have been raised. Conclusion: <b>Task</b> <b>shifting</b> occurs in many settings other than HIV treatment programmes and is viewed as a key strategy for governing human resources for healthcare. It may be an opportune time to review current <b>task</b> <b>shifting</b> recommendations to include a wider range of programmes and incorporate initiatives to address current challenges. </p...|$|R

40|$|Repetition {{effects are}} often helpful in {{revealing}} information about mental structures and processes. Usually, positive effects {{have been observed}} when the stimuli or responses are repeated. However, in <b>task</b> <b>shift</b> studies {{it has also been}} found that response repetitions can produce negative effects if the task shifts. Although several mechanisms have been proposed to account for this interaction between task shifting and response repetition, many details remain open. Therefore, a series of four experiments was conducted to answer two questions. First, are motor responses necessary to produce response-related repetition effects, or is response activation sufficient? Second, does the risk of an accidental re-execution of the last response affect the repetition costs? The results show that response activation alone can produce repetition effects. Furthermore, the risk of accidental response re-execution largely modulates these effects...|$|E

40|$|ART {{coverage}} among HIV-positive population varies, {{depending on}} the countries, between 10 % (e. g. Indonesia) and 65 % (Botswana).

Therefore, streamlining tasks and roles to expand treatment and care and to provide quality and equitable health is an ongoing concern globally. One concept that has been applied to improve the delivery of HIV services is that of <b>task</b> <b>shifting.</b> Defined as the systematic delegation of tasks from doctors to cadre with less training such as nurses or lay workers, <b>task</b> <b>shifting</b> has been used as an effective strategy to address the current healthcare worker shortage in many African countries.

40|$|When {{subjects}} {{switch between}} tasks, performance is slower after a task switch than after a task repetition, even when preparation time is long. We report two experiments {{that support the}} idea that a large part of these residual <b>task</b> <b>shift</b> costs can be due to stimulus-cued retrieval of previous task episodes. We demonstrate that there are two different factors at work: (1) facilitation of response to the current distractor stimulus, appropriate to the previously relevant, competing task (competitor priming), and (2) impaired processing of previously suppressed responses (negative priming). Negative priming was contingent {{on the size of the}} stimulus set, suggesting that distractor suppression comes into effect only if the distractors are highly activated. Importantly, both types of interference interacted with task readiness: Whereas in the nondominant task (picture naming), switch and nonswitch trials were equally affected, the dominant task (word reading) showed priming effects on switch trials only. Thus, the retrieval of previous processing episodes has a selective impact on situations in which task competition is high...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Although {{response}} repetition (RR) effects {{vary considerably}} between conditions and studies, {{little is known}} about the causes. Recently, RR costs on task switch trials have been found to be larger for incongruent stimuli that activate both alternative responses than for neutral ones. Here, we investigated if this modulation can be explained by an amplification of response conflict account (ARC). It assumes that a response shift bias that is responsible for the basic RR costs amplifies the response conflict induced by incongruent stimuli specifically on trials where the response repeats. Consequently, RR costs are increased for incongruent stimuli. Because supporting evidence for this account was restricted to <b>task</b> <b>shift</b> trials, we tested if the ARC account holds also more generally, that is, on task repetition trials. To this end, we applied a rather common alternating runs paradigm and presented neutral and incongruent stimuli. Results show that the congruency effect was larger on RR trials than on RS trials. Because this relation was independent of task transition, it is consistent with the idea that, in order to promote behavioral flexibility in task switching contexts, a general response shift bias is induced by inhibiting the previous response...|$|E

Before the <b>task</b> <b>shifting,</b> six nurses from the clinic were trained on integrated management of adolescent and adult illness, as well as on the principle and guidelines for the anti-retroviral therapy, after which their schedule in the clinic was broadened to include seeing HIV patients presenting for routine refill and follow-up visits.

40|$|Abstract Background Health {{workforce}} needs-based {{shortages and}} skill mix imbalances are significant health workforce challenges. <b>Task</b> <b>shifting,</b> defined as delegating tasks to existing or new cadres with either less training or narrowly tailored training, {{is a potential}} strategy to address these challenges. This study uses an economics perspective to review the skill mix literature to determine its strength of the evidence, identify gaps in the evidence, and to propose a research agenda. Methods Studies primarily from low-income countries published between 2006 and September 2010 were found using Google Scholar and PubMed. Keywords included terms such as skill mix, <b>task</b> <b>shifting,</b> assistant medical officer, assistant clinical officer, assistant nurse, assistant pharmacist, and community health worker. Thirty-one studies were selected to analyze, based {{on the strength of}} evidence. Results First, the studies provide substantial evidence that <b>task</b> <b>shifting</b> is an important policy option to help alleviate workforce shortages and skill mix imbalances. For example, in Mozambique, surgically trained assistant medical officers, who were the key providers in district hospitals, produced similar patient outcomes at a significantly lower cost as compared to physician obstetricians and gynaecologists. Second, although <b>task</b> <b>shifting</b> is promising, it can present its own challenges. For example, a study analyzing <b>task</b> <b>shifting</b> in HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa noted quality and safety concerns, professional and institutional resistance, and the need to sustain motivation and performance. Third, most <b>task</b> <b>shifting</b> studies compare the results of the new cadre with the traditional cadre. Studies also need to compare the new cadre's results to the results from the care that would have been provided [...] if any care at all [...] had <b>task</b> <b>shifting</b> not occurred. Conclusions <b>Task</b> <b>shifting</b> is a promising policy option to increase the productive efficiency of the delivery of health care services, increasing the number of services provided at a given quality and cost. Future studies should examine the development of new professional cadres that evolve with technology and country-specific labour markets. To strengthen the evidence, skill mix changes need to be evaluated with a rigorous research design to estimate the effect on patient health outcomes, quality of care, and costs. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Ever {{since the}} 2006 World Health Report {{advocated}} increased community participation and the systematic {{delegation of tasks}} to less-specialized cadres, {{there has been a}} great deal of debate about the expediency, efficacy and modalities of <b>task</b> <b>shifting.</b> The delegation of tasks from one cadre to another, previously often called substitution, is not a new concept. It has been used in many countries and for many decades, either as a response to emergency needs or as a method to provide adequate care at primary and secondary levels, especially in understaffed rural facilities, to enhance quality and reduce costs. However, rapidly increasing care needs generated by the HIV/AIDS epidemic and accelerating human resource crises in many African countries have given the concept and practice of <b>task</b> <b>shifting</b> new prominence and urgency. Furthermore, the question arises as to whether <b>task</b> <b>shifting</b> and increased community participation can be more than a short-term solution to address the HIV/AIDS crisis and can contribute to a revival of the primary health care approach as an answer to health systems crises. In this commentary we argue that, while <b>task</b> <b>shifting</b> holds great promise, any long-term success of <b>task</b> <b>shifting</b> hinges on serious political and financial commitments. We reason that it requires a comprehensive and integrated reconfiguration of health teams, changed scopes of practice and regulatory frameworks and enhanced training infrastructure, as well as availability of reliable medium- to long-term funding, with time frames of 20 to 30 years instead of three to five years. The concept and practice of community participation needs to be revisited. Most importantly, <b>task</b> <b>shifting</b> strategies require leadership from national governments to ensure an enabling regulatory framework; drive the implementation of relevant policies; guide and support training institutions and ensure adequate resources; and harness the support of the multiple stakeholders. With such leadership and a willingness to learn from those with relevant experience (for example, Brazil, Ethiopia, Malawi, Mozambique and Zambia), <b>task</b> <b>shifting</b> can indeed make a vital contribution to building sustainable, cost-effective and equitable health care systems. Without it, <b>task</b> <b>shifting</b> runs the risk of being yet another unsuccessful health sector reform initiative. </p...|$|R
40|$|Aims: The overall aims were to {{synthesize}} knowledge about which instruments for depression that are evidence based, {{and to develop}} a strategy, based on determinants of practice and theory, to support the use of these instruments in primary care. Background: A correct diagnosis is essential for appropriate management of depression and anxiety, the two most common mental disorders seen in primary care. However, the diagnosis can be difficult. Structured interviews and rating scales (instruments) have been proposed as a support in the consultation, but the evidence for their accuracy is unclear and their use in primary care limited. Methods: Determinants of practice were explored in a focus group study with n = 27 family practitioners (FPs) in Västra Götaland. Systematic text condensation was used to analyse the discussions. A systematic review was conducted in accordance to the PRISMA statement to determine which instruments that were evidence-based. Only studies with low or moderate risk for bias were included in the meta-analyses. The evidence for average sensitivity and specificity was rated with GRADE. The acceptability of the evidence-based instrument, the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI), and of a supporting strategy was explored at three primary care centres (PCCs) in Stockholm. Data collection included a structured questionnaire to patients and interviewers (n = 125 patients), semi structured interviews (n = 24 patients and n = 3 therapists) and focus groups (n = 17 FPs). Qualitative content analysis and descriptive statistics were used in the data analysis. Findings across the participant groups were triangulated with the results from the questionnaires. The main component of the intervention strategy was a <b>task</b> <b>shift,</b> where FPs could refer patients to a therapist for the MINI assessment and the results were fed back to the FP. The analyses were based on the interviews and focus groups, where n = 21 patient interviews were relevant. Factors that influenced the referral process was identified with deductive content analysis guided by the COM-B model. Main Results: Several determinants of practice could influence when, and to what extent Swedish FPs use instruments for depression. These mainly concerned knowledge and attitudes of the individual FP. However, some actors outside primary care could influence the use. The MINI had good diagnostic accuracy for depression. It was appreciated by FP, patients and therapists in primary care. The time for the assessment could be a problem for FPs who want to conduct the MINI. The <b>task</b> <b>shift</b> was appropriate at one of the two PCCs. The inclination to refer was dependent on factors such as FPs’ own knowledge and beliefs that referral gives benefits to the FP and the patient. Conclusions: The MINI can be a useful part of the consultation in primary care and is appreciated by the patients and interviewers. Referral to a therapist for MINI assessment can be feasible, depending on contextual factors...|$|E
40|$|Rationale, {{aims and}} objectives: Recent health care {{reforms in the}} Netherlands {{have led to the}} {{introduction}} of intermediate health care. Intermediate health care combines features of primary care and secondary (hospital) care. It is characterized by a <b>task</b> <b>shift</b> from hospital care to primary care. The initial experiences of medical specialists and general practitioners with intermediate health care are positive. However, the patients' perspectives regarding this reform are unknown. This study aimed to evaluate the level of support from patients with back and/or neck pain for intermediate health care services and to provide insight into their preferences how this care should be organized. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in which members of the patient association for spinal pain in the Netherlands completed electronic questionnaires to measure the level of support and preferred organization of intermediate health care services. Results: Questionnaires were returned by 367 patients (response rate: 51 %). Respondents supported the concept of intermediate health care (numeric rating scale: 7 / 10). Aspects considered important for intermediate health care included knowledge and expertise of staff, multidisciplinary cooperation, patient contact time, reimbursement via health insurance, quality control of care, evidence-based treatments and electronic medical records. Although intermediate care is a health care reform, patients continued to think according to traditional primary and secondary care constitutions. Conclusions: Patients with neck and/or back pain support the introduction of intermediate health care services and have explicit preferences regarding its organization, but may need to be better informed when intermediate care is introduced.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Electromagnetic (EM) -guided bedside {{placement}} of nasoenteral feeding tubes by nurses may improve efficiency and reduce patient discomfort and costs compared with endoscopic placement by gastroenterologists. However, evidence supporting this <b>task</b> <b>shift</b> from gastroenterologists to nurses is limited. We aimed {{to compare the}} effectiveness of EM-guided and endoscopic nasoenteral feeding tube placement. METHODS: We performed a multicenter randomized controlled non-inferiority trial in 154 adult patients who required nasoenteral feeding and were admitted to gastrointestinal surgical wards in five Dutch hospitals. Patients were randomly assigned (1 : 1) to undergo EM-guided or endoscopic nasoenteral feeding tube placement. The primary end point was the need for reinsertion of the feeding tube (e. g., after failed initial placement or owing to tube-related complications) with a prespecified non-inferiority margin of 10 %. RESULTS: Reinsertion was required in 29 (36 %) of the 80 patients in the EM-guided group and 31 (42 %) of the 74 patients in the endoscopy group (absolute risk difference - 6 %, upper limit of one-sided 95 % confidence interval 7 %; P for non-inferiority= 0. 022). No differences were noted in success and complication rates. In the EM-guided group, there was a reduced time to start of feeding (424 vs. 535 min, P= 0. 001). Although the level of discomfort was higher in the EM-guided group (Visual Analog Scale (VAS) 3. 9 vs. 2. 0, P= 0. 009), EM-guided placement received higher recommendation scores (VAS 8. 2 vs. 5. 5, P= 0. 008). CONCLUSIONS: EM-guided bedside {{placement of}} nasoenteral feeding tubes by nurses was non-inferior to endoscopic placement by gastroenterologists in surgical patients and may be considered the preferred technique for nasoenteral feeding tube placement...|$|E
5|$|Malawi {{has adopted}} <b>task</b> <b>shifting</b> {{strategies}} {{to overcome the}} shortage of workers available for HIV/AIDS treatment and care. <b>Task</b> <b>shifting,</b> which {{has been successful in}} many other regions, involves training less specialized health workers to perform health-related tasks that do not require professional training, such as the initiation of antiretroviral therapy. For example, at Thyolo District Hospital, health workers spend one week learning how to initiate antiretroviral therapy in a classroom setting and an additional two weeks practicing their knowledge in a supervised clinical setting; after completing this course, they are legally (under Ministry of Health guidelines) allowed to initiate antiretroviral therapy. Another form of <b>task</b> <b>shifting</b> involves training health-oriented counselors in HIV testing and counseling, which relieves nurses of this additional task.|$|R
40|$|To review systematically, {{qualitative}} literature {{covering the}} implementation of <b>task</b> <b>shifting</b> in sub-Saharan Africa to address the growing interest in interventions of this kind. This review aims to distil the key practical findings to both guide a specific project aiming {{to improve the quality}} of neonatal care in Kenya and to contribute to the broader literature. Task-shifting programmes aim to improve access to healthcare by delegating specific tasks from higher to lower skilled health workers. Evidence suggests that task-shifting programmes in sub-Saharan Africa may improve patient outcomes, but they have also been criticised for providing fragmented, unsustainable services. This systematic review of qualitative literature summarises factors affecting implementation of <b>task</b> <b>shifting</b> and how such interventions in sub-Saharan Africa may have affected health workers' feelings about their own positions and their ability to provide care. Following literature search, a modified Critical Appraisal Skills Program (CASP) framework was used to assess quality. Thereafter, analysis adopted a thematic synthesis approach. A systematic literature search identified qualitative studies examining task -shifting interventions in sub-Saharan Africa. Thematic synthesis was used to identify overarching themes arising from across the studies and infer how task-shifting interventions may impact on the health workers from whom <b>tasks</b> are being <b>shifted.</b> From the 230 studies screened, 13 met the inclusion criteria. Overarching themes identified showed that <b>task</b> <b>shifting</b> has been associated with jurisdictional debates linked to new cadres working beyond their scope of practice, and tension around compensation and career development for those taking on tasks that were being delegated. Based on the qualitative data available, it appears that <b>task</b> <b>shifting</b> may negatively impact the sense of agency and the ability to perform of health workers' from whom <b>tasks</b> are <b>shifted.</b> The potential implications of <b>task</b> <b>shifting</b> on all health workers should be considered prior to implementing task-shifting solutions...|$|R

However, many health officials remain wary about implementing <b>task</b> <b>shifting</b> policies due to concerns that non-physicians will provide care inferior to physicians. To determine if non-physician-provided HIV care does result in equivalent outcomes to physician-provided care, a meta-analysis was performed...|$|R
40|$|Background: The ever {{increasing}} demand for surgical services in sub-Saharan Africa {{is creating a}} need {{to increase the number}} of health workers able to provide surgical care. This calls for the optimisation of all available human resources to provide universal access to essential and emergency surgical services. One way of optimising already scarce human resources for health is by clarifying job descriptions to guide the scope of practice, measuring rewards/benefits for the health workers providing surgical care, and informing education and training for health professionals. This study set out to determine the scope of the mandate to perform surgical procedures in current job descriptions of surgical care health professionals in Uganda. Methods: A document review was conducted of job descriptions for the health professionals responsible for surgical service delivery in the Ugandan Health care system. The job descriptions were extracted and subjected to a qualitative content data analysis approach using a text based RQDA package of the open source R statistical computing software. Results: It was observed that there was no explicit mention of assignment of delivery of surgical services to a particular cadre. Instead the bulk of direct patient related care, including surgical attention, was assigned to the lower cadres, in particular the medical officer. Senior cadres were assigned to perform predominantly advisory and managerial roles in the health care system. In addition, a no cost opportunity to <b>task</b> <b>shift</b> surgical service delivery to the senior clinical officers was identified. Conclusions: There is a need to specifically assign the mandate to provide surgical care tasks, according to degree of complexity, to adequately trained cadres of health workers. Health professionals ’ current job descriptions are not explicit, and therefore do not adequately support proper training, deployment, defined scope of practice, and remuneration for equitable surgical service delivery in Uganda. Such deliberate assignment of mandates will provide a means of increasing surgical service delivery through further optimisation of the available human resources for health...|$|E
40|$|Background: A {{physically}} active lifestyle {{has the potential}} to prevent cognitive decline and dementia, yet the optimal type of physical activity/exercise remains unclear. Dance is of special interest as it complex sensorimotor rhythmic activity with additional cognitive, social and affective dimensions. Objectives: to determine whether dance benefits executive function more than walking, an activity that is simple and functional. Methods: Two-arm randomised controlled trial among community-dwelling older adults. The intervention group received 1 hour of ballroom dancing twice weekly over 8 months (~ 69 sessions) in local community dance studios. The control group received a combination of a home walking program with a pedometer and optional biweekly group-based walking in local community park to facilitate socialisation. Main outcomes: Main outcomes: executive function tests: processing speed and <b>task</b> <b>shift</b> by the Trail Making Tests (TMT), response inhibition by the Stroop Colour-Word Test (SCWT), working memory by the Digit Span Backwards (DSB) test, immediate and delayed verbal recall by the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT) and visuospatial recall by the Brief Visuospatial Memory Test (BVST). Results: One hundred and fifteen adults (69. 5 years, SD 6. 4) completed baseline and delayed baseline (3 weeks apart) before being randomised to either dance (n= 60) or walking (n= 55). Of those randomized, 79 (68 %) completed the follow-up measurements (32 weeks from baseline). In the dance group only, ‘non-completers’ had significant lower baseline scores on all executive function tests than those completed the full program. Intention-to-treat analyses showed no group effect. In a random effects model including participants who completed all measurements, adjusted for baseline score and covariates (age, education, estimated verbal intelligence, community), a between group effect in favour of dance was noted only for BVST total learning (Cohen’s D Effect size 0. 29, p=. 07) and delayed recall (Cohen’s D Effect size= 0. 34, p=. 06) Conclusion: The superior potential of dance over walking on executive functions of cognitively healthy and active older adults was not supported. Dance improved one of the cognitive domains (spatial memory) important for learning dance. Controlled trials targeting inactive older adults and of a higher dose may produce stronger effects, particularly for novice dancers...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Shifting {{the role}} of {{counseling}} to less skilled workers may improve efficiency and coverage of health services, but evidence is needed {{on the impact of}} substitution on quality of care. This research explored the influence of delegating maternal and newborn counseling responsibilities to clinic-based lay nurse aides on the quality of counseling provided as part of a task shifting initiative to expand their role. Methods Nurse-midwives and lay nurse aides in seven public maternities were trained to use job aids to improve counseling in maternal and newborn care. Quality of counseling and maternal knowledge were assessed using direct observation of antenatal consultations and patient exit interviews. Both provider types were interviewed to examine perceptions regarding the <b>task</b> <b>shift.</b> To compare provider performance levels, non-inferiority analyses were conducted where non-inferiority was demonstrated if the lower confidence limit of the performance difference did not exceed a margin of 10 percentage points. Results Mean percent of recommended messages provided by lay nurse aides was non-inferior to counseling by nurse-midwives in adjusted analyses for birth preparedness (β = - 0. 0, 95 % CI: - 9. 0, 9. 1), danger sign recognition (β = 4. 7, 95 % CI: - 5. 1, 14. 6), and clean delivery (β = 1. 4, 95 % CI: - 9. 4, 12. 3). Lay nurse aides demonstrated superior performance for communication on general prenatal care (β = 15. 7, 95 % CI: 7. 0, 24. 4), although non-inferiority was not achieved for newborn care counseling (β = - 7. 3, 95 % CI: - 23. 1, 8. 4). The proportion of women with correct knowledge was significantly higher among those counseled by lay nurse aides as compared to nurse-midwives in general prenatal care (β = 23. 8, 95 % CI: 15. 7, 32. 0), birth preparedness (β = 12. 7, 95 % CI: 5. 2, 20. 1), and danger sign recognition (β = 8. 6, 95 % CI: 3. 3, 13. 9). Both cadres had positive opinions regarding task shifting, although several preferred 'task sharing' over full delegation. Conclusions Lay nurse aides can provide effective antenatal counseling in maternal and newborn care in facility-based settings, provided they receive adequate training and support. Efforts are needed to improve management of human resources to ensure that effective mechanisms for regulating and financing task shifting are sustained. </p...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE OF VIEW: To {{illustrate}} {{and critically}} assess what {{is currently being}} published on the human resources for health dimension of antiretroviral therapy (ART) delivery models. RECENT FINDINGS: The use of human resources for health can {{have an effect on}} two crucial aspects of successful ART programmes, namely the scale-up capacity and the long-term retention in care. <b>Task</b> <b>shifting</b> as the delegation of tasks from higher qualified to lower qualified cadres has become a widespread practice in ART delivery models in low-income countries in recent years. It is increasingly shown to effectively reduce the workload for scarce medical doctors without compromising the quality of care. At the same time, it becomes clear that <b>task</b> <b>shifting</b> can only be successful when accompanied by intensive training, supervision and support from existing health system structures. SUMMARY: Although a number of recent publications have focussed on <b>task</b> <b>shifting</b> in ART delivery models, {{there is a lack of}} accessible information on the link between <b>task</b> <b>shifting</b> and patient outcomes. Current ART delivery models do not focus sufficiently on retention in care as arguably one of the most important issues for the long-term success of ART programmes. There is a need for context-specific re-designing of current ART delivery models in order to increase access to ART and improve long-term retention...|$|R
40|$|AbstractTask {{shifting}} {{in various}} forms has been adopted extensively {{around the world in}} an effort to expand the reach of lifesaving services to the women, newborns, and families who need them. The emerging global literature, as well as Jhpiego’s field experiences, supports the importance of addressing several key components that facilitate effective <b>task</b> <b>shifting</b> in maternal and newborn health care. These components include: (1) policy and regulatory support; (2) definition of roles, functions, and limitations; (3) determination of requisite skills and qualifications; (4) education and training; and (5) service delivery support, including management and supervision, incentives and/or remuneration, material support (e. g. commodities), and referral systems. Jhpiego’s experiences with <b>task</b> <b>shifting</b> also provide illustrations of the complex interplay of these key components at work in the field. <b>Task</b> <b>shifting</b> should be considered {{as a part of the}} larger health system that needs to be designed to equitably meet the needs of mothers, newborns, children, and families...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Shortages {{of human}} {{resources}} for health (HRH) have severely hampered the rollout of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in sub-Saharan Africa. Current rollout models are hospital- and physician-intensive. <b>Task</b> <b>shifting,</b> or delegating <b>tasks</b> performed by physicians to staff with lower-level qualifications, is considered a means of expanding rollout in resource-poor or HRH-limited settings. Methods We conducted a systematic literature review. Medline, the Cochrane library, the Social Science Citation Index, and the South African National Health Research Database were searched with the following terms: task shift*, balance of care, non-physician clinicians, substitute health care worker, community care givers, primary healthcare teams, cadres, and nurs* HIV. We mined bibliographies and corresponded with authors for further results. Grey literature was searched online, and conference proceedings searched for abstracts. Results We found 2960 articles, of which 84 {{were included in the}} core review. 51 reported outcomes, including research from 10 countries in sub-Saharan Africa. The most common intervention studied was the delegation of tasks (especially initiating and monitoring HAART) from doctors to nurses and other non-physician clinicians. Five studies showed increased access to HAART through expanded clinical capacity; two concluded <b>task</b> <b>shifting</b> is cost effective; 9 showed staff equal or better quality of care; studies on non-physician clinician agreement with physician decisions was mixed, with the majority showing good agreement. Conclusions <b>Task</b> <b>shifting</b> is an effective strategy for addressing shortages of HRH in HIV treatment and care. <b>Task</b> <b>shifting</b> offers high-quality, cost-effective care to more patients than a physician-centered model. The main challenges to implementation include adequate and sustainable training, support and pay for staff in new roles, the integration of new members into healthcare teams, and the compliance of regulatory bodies. <b>Task</b> <b>shifting</b> should be considered for careful implementation where HRH shortages threaten rollout programmes. </p...|$|R
