5|$|An {{aboriginal}} Australian fable retold by the Welsh school headmaster William Jenkyn Thomas (1870–1959) <b>tells</b> <b>how</b> {{some animals}} needed a canoe {{to cross the}} ocean. Whale had one but refused to lend it, so Starfish kept him busy, telling him stories and grooming him to remove parasites, while the others stole the canoe. When Whale realized the trick he beat Starfish ragged, which is how Starfish still is today.|$|E

On board is a stray dog who begs scraps of food and affection from the passengers. It finally becomes {{attached}} to a woman on board and follows her around. At Savannah, the dog is thrown into the street by the porters and waiters at the hotel, and is eventually left behind. Stowe compares the dog and the people who care for such stray animals to Christian ideals {{to take care of the}} poor and suffering.|$|E
5|$|Kamadhenu-Surabhi's {{residence}} varies {{depending on}} different scriptures. The Anushasana Parva of the Mahabharata <b>tells</b> <b>how</b> she was given the ownership of Goloka, the cow-heaven located above the three worlds (heaven, earth and netherworld): the daughter of Daksha, Surabhi went to Mount Kailash and worshipped Brahma for 10,000 years. The pleased god conferred goddess-hood on the cow and decreed that all people would worship her and her children – cows. He also gave her a world called Goloka, while her daughters would reside on earth among humans.|$|E
5|$|The Dreamtime {{story of}} the black swans <b>tells</b> <b>how</b> two {{brothers}} were turned into white swans so they could help an attack party during a raid for weapons.

Crows who were enemies of the eaglehawks came {{to the aid of}} the brothers and gave the black swans their own black feathers.

5|$|The Pranatoshini Tantra (18th century) narrates two {{tales of}} Chhinnamasta's birth. One legend, {{attributed}} to the Narada-pancharatra, <b>tells</b> <b>how</b> once, while bathing in Mandakini river, Parvati becomes sexually excited, and turns black. At the same time, her two female attendants Dakini and Varnini (also called Jaya and Vijaya) become extremely hungry and beg for food. Though Parvati initially promises to give them food once they return home, the merciful goddess beheads herself with her nails and gives her blood to satisfy their hunger. Later, they return home after Parvati rejoins her head.|$|E
5|$|The {{account of}} Edwin's {{conversion}} offered by Bede turns on two events. The first, during Edwin's exile, <b>tells</b> <b>how</b> Edwin's life was saved by Paulinus of York. The second, following {{his marriage to}} Æthelburg, was the attempted assassination at York, at Easter 626, by an agent of Cwichelm of Wessex. Edwin's decision to allow the baptism of his daughter Eanfled and his subsequent promise to adopt Christianity if his campaign against Cwichelm proved successful. Apart from these events, the general character of Bede's account is one of an indecisive king, unwilling to take risks, unable {{to decide whether to}} convert or not.|$|E
5|$|An oral legend <b>tells</b> <b>how</b> {{the goddess}} Prachanda-Chandika {{appeared}} {{to aid the}} gods in the god-demon war, when the gods prayed to the Great Goddess Mahashakti. After slaying all demons, the enraged goddess cut off her own head and drank her own blood. The name Prachanda-Chandika also appears as a synonym of Chhinnamasta in her hundred-name hymn in the Shakta Pramoda (19th century). Another oral legend relates her to the Samudra manthan (Churning of the Ocean) episode, where the gods and demons churned the milk ocean to acquire the amrita (the elixir of immortality). Chhinnamasta drank the demons' share of the elixir and then beheaded herself {{to prevent them from}} acquiring it.|$|E

5|$|By mid-July Wiesenthal {{and other}} Jewish {{residents}} had to register to do forced labour. Within six months, in November 1941 the Nazis {{had set up}} the Lwów Ghetto using Jewish forced labour. All Jews {{had to give up}} their homes and move there, a process completed in the following months. Several thousand Jews were murdered in Lvov by Ukrainian nationals and German Einsatzgruppen in June and July 1941. In his autobiographies, Wiesenthal <b>tells</b> <b>how</b> he was arrested on 6 July, but saved from execution by his former foreman, a man named Bodnar, who was now a member of the Ukrainian Auxiliary Police. There are several versions of the story, which may be apocryphal.|$|E
5|$|Il ritorno d'Ulisse in patria (SV 325, The Return of Ulysses to his Homeland) is {{an opera}} {{consisting}} of a prologue and five acts (later revised to three), set by Claudio Monteverdi to a libretto by Giacomo Badoaro. The opera was first performed at the Teatro Santi Giovanni e Paolo in Venice during the 1639–1640 carnival season. The story, taken from {{the second half of}} Homer's Odyssey, <b>tells</b> <b>how</b> constancy and virtue are ultimately rewarded, treachery and deception overcome. After his long journey home from the Trojan Wars Ulisse, king of Ithaca, finally returns to his kingdom where he finds that a trio of villainous suitors are importuning his faithful queen, Penelope. With the assistance of the gods, his son Telemaco and a staunch friend Eumete, Ulisse vanquishes the suitors and recovers his kingdom.|$|E
5|$|In his discourses {{recorded}} in the Vachanamrut, Swaminarayan mentions that humans {{would not be able}} to withstand meeting god in his divine form, hence God takes human form (simultaneously living in his abode) so people can approach, understand and love him in the form of an Avatar. While no detailed statistical information is available, most of the followers of Swaminarayan share a belief that Swaminarayan is the complete manifestation of Narayana or Purushottam Narayana - the Supreme Being and superior to other avatars. A Swaminarayan sectarian legend <b>tells</b> <b>how</b> Narayana from the Nara Narayana pair, was cursed by sage Durvasa to incarnate on the earth as Swaminarayan.|$|E

5|$|That even a dead ala is bad {{is seen in}} {{the legend}} {{explaining}} the origin of the Golubatz fly (Simulium colombaschense), a species of bloodsucking black fly (of the genus Simulium) that can be lethal to livestock. The legend, recorded in the Požarevac District in the 19th century by Vuk Karadžić, <b>tells</b> <b>how</b> a Serbian man, after a chase, caught and wounded an ala, but she broke away and fled into a cave near Golubac (a town in the district), where she died of the wounds. Ever since, her body has bred the Golubatz flies, and in late spring, they fly out of the cave in a big swarm, spreading as far as Šumadija. People walled up the cave’s opening once, but when the time came for the flies to swarm, the wall shattered.|$|E
5|$|The Gododdin, {{known in}} Roman times as the Votadini, held territories {{in what is}} now {{southeast}} Scotland and Northumberland, part of the Hen Ogledd (Old North). The poem <b>tells</b> <b>how</b> a force of 300 (or 363) picked warriors were assembled, some from as far afield as Pictland and Gwynedd. After a year of feasting at Din Eidyn, now Edinburgh, they attacked Catraeth, which is usually identified with Catterick, North Yorkshire. After several days of fighting against overwhelming odds, nearly all the warriors are killed. The poem is similar in ethos to heroic poetry, with the emphasis on the heroes fighting primarily for glory, but is not a narrative.|$|E
