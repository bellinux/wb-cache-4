25|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, the German Army had an {{interest}} in a small helicopter for observation and communications duties that could be folded up compactly enough to be carried in a trailer pulled by a jeep. The Do 32, like several other light helicopters of the time such as the Fairey Ultra-light Helicopter and the Sud-Ouest Djinn, used rotor tip jets to drive the rotor blades. The advantage of tip drive is the absence of <b>torque</b> <b>reaction,</b> making a tail rotor unnecessary, saving weight and simplifying control of the aircraft. Dornier used a small gas turbine to drive a compressor, which fed air out through tubes in the rotors to the tips.|$|E
25|$|It first flew in 1951, and {{although}} 200 units were planned, only 65 were ever built. The Hispano engine was an upright V12 {{in contrast to}} the inverted V12 Daimler-Benz DB 601 & 605 engines used in the Bf 109. Being of compact design, it fitted the airframe of the Bf 109 well, representing it in the German 1957 film Der Stern von Afrika (The Star of Africa) about Luftwaffe ace Hans-Joachim Marseille. In the original design, an asymmetric vertical fin with an airfoiled profile had been introduced starting with the Bf 109F to produce a slight left movement of the tail, which counteracted the left-side <b>torque</b> <b>reaction</b> from the Daimler-Benz engine's counterclockwise rotation. Since this was left unchanged in the Buchón, and the Hispano V12 powered a clockwise-turning propeller instead, the combination of the airfoiled fin and the clockwise-turning propeller created a hard-to-counteract right swing on takeoff, since the fin and the propeller essentially worked in the same direction.|$|E
25|$|Modern {{electric}} locomotives, {{like their}} Diesel-electric counterparts, almost universally use axle-hung traction motors, with one motor for each powered axle. In this arrangement, {{one side of}} the motor housing is supported by plain bearings riding on a ground and polished journal that is integral to the axle. The other side of the housing has a tongue-shaped protuberance that engages a matching slot in the truck (bogie) bolster, its purpose being to act as a <b>torque</b> <b>reaction</b> device, as well as a support. Power transfer from motor to axle is effected by spur gearing, in which a pinion on the motor shaft engages a bull gear on the axle. Both gears are enclosed in a liquid-tight housing containing lubricating oil. The type of service in which the locomotive is used dictates the gear ratio employed. Numerically high ratios are commonly found on freight units, whereas numerically low ratios are typical of passenger engines.|$|E
5000|$|Whereas a {{chain-driven}} bike would [...] "squat" [...] at {{the rear}} under acceleration, a shaft drive machine would do the opposite, causing the seat (and rider) to rise upwards, a phenomenon known as [...] "shaft-jacking". This anti-intuitive sensation can be disconcerting to riders, and parallelogram suspensions seek to neutralize such unwelcome <b>torque</b> <b>reactions.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{engine was}} {{flexibly}} mounted to isolate <b>torque</b> <b>reactions.</b> It was {{fitted with a}} statically and dynamically balanced three bearing crankshaft; big ends fitted with steel-backed white-metal liners; three bearing camshaft with steel-backed white-metal liners; air silencer; and automatic advance and vacuum control of the distributor with over-riding hand adjustment for varying grades of fuel.|$|R
50|$|Straight-twins {{have the}} {{advantage}} of being more compact, relatively simple, and cheaper to make in comparison to V- or flat-twins. They may be prone to vibration, either because of the irregular firing interval present in 180° crank engines or the large uncountered reciprocating mass in 360° crank engines. Inline-twins also suffer further from torsional <b>torque</b> <b>reactions</b> and vibration.|$|R

R.C. or CARC [...] introduced with the Breva 1100 in 2005. The system separates the shaft final drive’s <b>torque</b> <b>reaction</b> from the suspension via floating torque arms and thereby eliminates the abruptness typical of shaft drive systems on acceleration or throttle-release [...] still providing a quiet, reliable and low maintenance drive system. Reviewers have observed excellent braking performance and drive train smoothness attributable to the CARC system.|$|E

50|$|The {{flat-twin}} engine in the 1897 Lanchester 8 hp phaeton had two counter-rotating crankshafts. Each piston {{was attached to}} one crankshaft by a thick connecting rod and to the other crankshaft by two thinner connecting rods, one {{on either side of}} the other piston's thick connecting rod. This allowed both cylinders to have the same axis. It also had the <b>torque</b> <b>reaction</b> of one crankshaft cancel the <b>torque</b> <b>reaction</b> of the other, cancelling <b>torque</b> <b>reaction</b> in the engine. The pistons in the Lanchester engine moved so that one piston was on top while the other was at bottom dead center, creating an uneven firing cycle. Lanchester used this engine design until 1904.|$|E

40|$|Owing to the {{dynamics}} coupling between a free-floating base and a manipulator, the non-stationary {{base of a}} space robot will face the issue of base disturbance due to a manipulator’s motion. The <b>reaction</b> <b>torque</b> acted on the satellite base’s centroid is an important index to measure the satellite base’s disturbance. In this paper, a comprehensive analysis of the <b>reaction</b> <b>torque</b> is made, and a novel way to derive the analytical form of the <b>reaction</b> <b>torque</b> is proposed. In addition, the <b>reaction</b> <b>torque</b> null-space is derived, in which the manipulator’s joint motion is dynamically decoupled from {{the motion of the}} satellite base, and its novel expression demonstrates the equivalence between the <b>reaction</b> <b>torque</b> null-space and the reaction null-space. Furthermore, the <b>reaction</b> <b>torque</b> acted as an optimization index can be utilized to achieve satellite base disturbance minimization in the generalized Jacobian-based end-effector Cartesian path tracking task. Besides, supposing that the redundant degrees of freedom are abundant to achieve reaction torque-based active control, the <b>reaction</b> <b>torque</b> can be used to realize satellite base attitude control, that is, base attitude adjustment or maintenance. Moreover, because reaction torque-based control is a second-order control scheme, joint torque minimization can be regarded as the optimization task in reaction torque-based active or in-active control. A real-time simulation system of a 7 -DOF space robot under Linux/RTAI is developed to verify and test the feasibility and reliability of the proposed ideas. Our extensive empirical results demonstrate that the corresponding analysis about the <b>reaction</b> <b>torque</b> is correct and the proposed methods are feasible...|$|R

40|$|A novel fault {{tolerant}} control scheme, using model-based control and time delay control theories, is proposed for flexible satellites with uncertainties and actuator saturation and the stability {{condition of the}} scheme is analysed. The moment–of-inertia uncertainty, actuator faults uncertainty, space environment disturbances and the actuator saturation are analysed. The computable control torques, including the space environmental <b>torques,</b> <b>reaction</b> wheel dynamics and the known flexible appendage dynamics, are formulated using the model-based control. The unknown flexible satellite dynamics is estimated according to its one-step previous value and employed to update the control command; this greatly reduces the conservativeness and enhances the pointing accuracy.

A graphical vector acceleration diagram shows how linear accelerations can be determined from angular accelera-tions, derived in turn by finite differences from displacement time data.

50|$|<b>Torque</b> <b>Reaction</b> - A variant on the thwackbot is the <b>torque</b> <b>reaction</b> hammer, {{also known}} as axlebots. These robots have two very large wheels with the small body of the robot hanging in between them. A long weapon boom has a {{vertically}} oriented hammer, pick, or axe on the end. On acceleration, the weapon boom swings upward and over {{to the rear of}} the robot to offset the motor torque. When the robot reverses direction, the weapon will swing forcibly back over the top and hopefully impact the opponent. These robots are simple and can put on a flashy, aggressive show, but their attack power is relatively small and, like thwackbots, they can be hard to control. BattleBots 2.0 middleweight champion Spaz was a <b>torque</b> <b>reaction</b> pickaxe robot, whilst Robot Wars Grand Finalist Stinger opted for a disc, later replaced with a bludgeoning mace.|$|E

40|$|Control-moment {{gyroscopes}} (CMGs) are spacecraft attitude-control actuators which {{control the}} spacecraft's orientation and pointing. CMGs operate on electrical power and therefore obey the {{the conservation of}} angular momentum. Single-gimbal CMGs are equipped with a high-speed flywheel which can be gimbaled to impart gyroscopic <b>torques.</b> The net <b>reaction</b> <b>torques</b> are observed by the spacecraft resulting in pure rotation. A CMG based attitude control system (ACS) is favorable compared to a cold gas thruster ACS because of fundamental differences in how the <b>reaction</b> <b>torques</b> are produced. CMGs provide a continuous range of motion while RCS thrusters are limited by the minimum on-off time for the thruster valves. This minimum open-close time leads to a bang-bang response {{as opposed to the}} smoother CMG response. Fur-thermore, CMGs are powered using batteries and can therefore be recharged, while RCS thrusters use propellant which depletes over time. CMG sizing, the act of de...|$|R
