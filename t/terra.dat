5|$|In {{preparation}} for the restoration work, the structural and architectural engineering firm Wiss, Janney, Elstner Associates completed {{an evaluation of the}} building's eastern and southern facades, focusing on its <b>terra</b> cotta portions. By using ultrasonic testing, engineers were able to evaluate the state of the <b>terra</b> cotta without further damaging the pieces. Severely cracked or damaged pieces were partially removed and a report was written from these findings. This report provided recommendations for the masonry facade and <b>terra</b> cotta repair work. Restoration work began in spring 2009 and is scheduled for completion in early 2010. All of the damaged <b>terra</b> cotta elements have been replaced on the south tower and parapet, and scaffolding has been erected on building's eastern facade in {{preparation for}} further restoration work. Fully restoring the building's exterior <b>terra</b> cotta pieces and clay roof tiles {{is the first step in}} a long-range $2million repair plan.|$|E
5|$|In the Land of Departure, <b>Terra</b> and Aqua take an exam {{to achieve}} the Mark of Mastery.

Shortly after the test, Xehanort disappears and a horde of mysterious creatures called the Unversed begin to appear throughout the worlds {{in pursuit of the}} Princesses of Heart. Learning about these developments from Yen Sid, Master Eraqus sends <b>Terra</b> and Aqua to destroy the Unversed and find Xehanort throughout the countless worlds.

When the Returners arrive in the capital, they find Emperor Gestahl claiming to no longer have the will to fight, inviting the Returners to a banquet to negotiate peace. Gestahl asks <b>Terra</b> to deliver a truce to the espers on his behalf, to which she agrees.

On the exterior {{south and east}} (front) elevations is a one-story base of pink granite, with high arched openings; it supports the red brick- and <b>terra</b> cotta-trimmed building shaft. Above the granite base are four stories of white, glazed <b>terra</b> cotta.

5|$|The prequel Birth by Sleep {{introduces}} <b>Terra</b> as {{an apprentice}} Keyblade wielder who trains alongside Aqua and Ventus at the Land of Departure. Early in the game, <b>Terra</b> is denied the rank of Keyblade Master when his mentor, Master Eraqus, detects a strong presence of darkness in his heart. Disheartened, <b>Terra</b> is {{given a chance to}} redeem his failure when dispatched to eliminate an insurgence of dark creatures called the Unversed in neighboring worlds. Periodically, the vagabond Master Xehanort appeals to <b>Terra</b> to channel the power of darkness freely, creating a schism between him and his friends as they grow troubled by his actions. This eventually leads <b>Terra</b> to clash with Eraqus when he finds his master inexplicably attacking Ventus, which ends with Xehanort vanquishing the weakened Eraqus. <b>Terra,</b> realizing the entire conflict was engineered to stimulate his inner darkness, confronts Xehanort at the Keyblade Graveyard and succumbs to rage, allowing Xehanort to take over his body to prolong his own life. Terra's disembodied mind inhabits his discarded armor and becomes the Lingering Will, which remains in the Keyblade Graveyard after defeating Xehanort. The game's secret ending shows Terra's heart continuing to resist Xehanort, who still possesses his body after losing his memories in a final battle against Aqua.|$|E

40|$|A {{previously}} undescribed, rapid growing, non-chromogenic Mycobacterium novel species {{isolated from}} a goat lung lesion in Algeria is reported.

5|$|Early on {{the morning}} of 3February, <b>Terra</b> Nova arrived {{unexpectedly}} in the Bay of Whales.

After landing Scott and his main party there, <b>Terra</b> Nova had taken a party of six men, led by Victor Campbell, eastward to King Edward VII Land. This group intended to explore this then-unknown territory, but had been prevented by sea ice from approaching the shore. The ship was sailing westward along the Barrier edge in search of a possible landing place when it encountered Fram. Scott had previously speculated that Amundsen might make his base in the Weddell Sea area, {{on the opposite side of}} the continent; this proof that the Norwegians would be starting the race for the pole with a 60 nautical mile advantage was an alarming prospect for the British. The two groups behaved civilly towards each other; Campbell and his officers Harry Pennell and George Murray Levick breakfasted aboard Fram, and reciprocated with lunch on the <b>Terra</b> Nova. Amundsen was relieved to learn that <b>Terra</b> Nova had no wireless radio, since that might have imperilled his strategy to be first with the news of a polar victory. He was worried, however, by a remark of Campbell's that implied that Scott's motorised sledges were working well. Nevertheless, he offered the British party a site alongside Framheim as a base for the exploration of King Edward VII Land. Campbell turned the offer down, and sailed for McMurdo Sound to inform Scott of Amundsen's whereabouts.|$|E
