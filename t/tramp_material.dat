40|$|Separation of faeces and non-faecal solids: {{a variety}} of solid {{materials}} may enter the toilet in the community ablution block context (toilet paper, newspaper, plastics, rubber, clothing) (see Figure 2), {{some of which may}} require pre-treatment (shredding) or complete removal from the feed stream to the dryer. Extruder separates faeces from other solids by using a ram to pressurise the mixed solids stream, causing faeces to be extruded through holes in the external casing and <b>tramp</b> <b>material</b> to accumulate against the endplate (see Figures 3 and 4). Extruder forms faeces into a geometry which allows for more energy-efficient drying and combustion (see Figure 4 c). The pellets formed must have sufficient structural integrity to remain intact through the downstream processes. Segregated faeces has more predictable rheological and thermal properties than the mixed solids stream – allows for better design of downstream unit operations. Removal of water from faeces pellets to produce a product suitable for efficient combustion Diversion of humid air to a condenser for water and energy recovery Efficient energy exchange between heated exhaust gases from combustor and wet feed material DESIGN PRINCIPLE...|$|E
40|$|Program {{status and}} accomplishments {{for a project}} to develop alfalfa as a biomass fuel for power {{generation}} are summarized in this report. The main areas of reporting include: (1) alfalfa separation pilot plant testing, (2) design of gasification plant, (3) alfalfa leaf meal feeding trials and analysis, (4) integrated plant design and cost estimate, and (5) site plan construction and environmental permits. The alfalfa separation pilot plant fractionation equipment encountered operating problems from rocks and other <b>tramp</b> <b>materials</b> in the alfalfa bales. An investigation of techniques and equipment to remove the <b>tramp</b> <b>materials</b> resulted {{in the selection of}} a vibrating conveyor system. The Carbona gasification plant design basis and the Westinghouse scope of supply and design basis for the hot gas filter are provided in the report. The alfalfa leaf meal feeding trials showed that this economically critical co-product can be a viable livestock feed ingredient if favorable price, availability, and quality are maintained. The Stone and Webster basis of design for the integrated plant is included, and the basis for development of gas turbine performance runs is also detailed...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} facture and wear of damaged {{shredder}} hammer tips manufactured from cemented tungsten carbide with an ultrafine grain structure and Ni-Ti-Cr as a binder instead of Co, for sugar cane shredding. Optical imaging and {{scanning electron microscopy}} were applied for measurement of fracture and wear regions of damaged shredder hammer tips at macro and microstructural scales. Our results reveal that edge and large scale fractures {{in the form of}} conchoidal fracture were caused by impacts from hard objects such as rocks or <b>tramp</b> metal <b>materials</b> in the shredding process. Minor wear occurred due to abrasive wear of tungsten carbide grains and fatigue-induced cracks in the metal binders. This study shows that fracture was the main failure mode of the trial cemented tungsten carbide used that caused the instant failure of the shredder hammer tips, while minor wear also occurred...|$|R
50|$|After {{considerable}} effort, {{these new}} acquaintances convinced Kinsey {{to take their}} newfound musical chemistry to a more public venue. The trio’s time together ended up as a three song open-mic appearance at a Montrose area bar called Helios (currently known as Avante Garden). Their first appearance inspired a nagging bartender to secure a weekly residency for the group; the growing interest attracted drummer Shane Lauder to start showing up and getting onstage with them. They began to refer to their weekly nights of bluegrass and classic blues and country cover songs as The Medicine Show, later settling on a separate moniker for the band itself, Sideshow <b>Tramps.</b> As original <b>material</b> began to surface in their regular sets, plans for recording got underway. In 2007, an album titled The Medicine Show was given a small release in Houston, documenting the group’s early work.|$|R
40|$|Purpose To improve early {{diagnosis}} {{of prostate cancer}} to aid clinical decision-making. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) is sensitive to water diffusion throughout tissues, which correlates with Gleason score, a histological measure of prostate cancer aggressiveness. In this study the ability of DW-MRI to detect prostate cancer onset and development was evaluated in transgenic adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate (<b>TRAMP)</b> mice. <b>Materials</b> and Methods T 2 -weighted and DW-MRI were acquired using a 7 T MR scanner, 200 [*]mm bore diameter; 10 TRAMP and 6 C 57 BL/ 6 control mice were scanned every 4 weeks from 8 weeks of age until sacrifice at 28 – 30 weeks. After sacrifice, the genitourinary tract was excised and sectioned for histological analysis. Histology slides registered with DW-MR images allowed for validation of DW-MR images and the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) as tools for cancer detection and disease stratification. An automated early assessment tool based on ADC threshold values was developed to aid cancer detection and progression monitoring. Results The ADC differentiated between control prostate ((1. 86 [*]±[*] 0. 20) [*]×[*] 10 − 3 mm 2 /s) and normal TRAMP prostate ((1. 38 [*]±[*] 0. 10) [*]×[*] 10 − 3 mm 2 /s) (P[*]=[*] 0. 0001), between TRAMP prostate and well-differentiated cancer ((0. 93 [*]±[*] 0. 18) [*]×[*] 10 − 3 mm 2 /s) (P[*]=[*] 0. 0006), and between well-differentiated cancer and poorly differentiated cancer ((0. 63 [*]±[*] 0. 06) [*]×[*] 10 − 3 mm 2 /s) (P[*]=[*] 0. 02). Conclusion DW-MRI is a tool for early detection of cancer, and discrimination between cancer stages in the TRAMP model. The incorporation of DW-MRI-based prostate cancer stratification and monitoring could increase the accuracy of preclinical trials using TRAMP mice. J. Magn. Reson.

40|$|The Department of Energy (DOE) has {{declared}} approximately 38. 2 tonnes of weapons-grade plutonium to be excess {{to the needs}} of national security, 14. 3 tonnes of fuel- and reactor-grade plutonium excess to DOE needs, and anticipates an additional 7 tonnes to be declared excess to national security needs. Of this 59. 5 tonnes, DOE anticipates that {approximately} 7. 5 tonnes will be dispositioned as spent fuel at the Geologic Repository and {approximately} 2 tonnes will be declared below the safeguards termination limit and be discard 3 ed as TRU waste at WIPP. The remaining 50 tonnes of excess plutonium exists in many forms and locations around the country, and is under the control of several DOE offices. In addition to the plutonium, the feed stock also contains about 17 tonnes of depleted uranium, about 600 kg of highly enriched uranium, and many kilograms of neptunium and thorium and about 8 to 10 tonnes of <b>tramp</b> impurities. The <b>Materials</b> Disposition Program (MD) will be received materials packaged by these other Programs to disposition in a manor that meets the spent fuel standard. To minimize the cost of characterization of the feedstock and to minimize purification processes, a blending strategy will be followed. The levelization of the impurities, the plutonium isotopics, and the actinide impurities will also provide some benefits in the area of proliferation resistance. The overall strategy will be outlined and the benefits of following a blending instead of a purification program will be discussed...|$|R
