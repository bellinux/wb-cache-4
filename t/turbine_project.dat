25|$|The Viking Wind Farm in the Shetland Islands {{was first}} {{proposed}} as a 600 MW 150 <b>turbine</b> <b>project</b> in 2009. After reduction in scope due to environmental concerns about effects of wildlife and peat bog carbon release during construction, {{as well as}} potential interference with equipment at Scatsta Airport the scheme was approved in 2012 as a 103 turbine scheme of 370 MW. The scheme is expected to achieve high capacity factors due to wind conditions in Shetland, as the Burradale achieves over 50% efficiency.|$|E
25|$|Rhode Island and Massachusetts state {{officials}} picked Deepwater Wind {{to build a}} $1.5-billion, 385-megawatt wind farm in federal waters off Block Island. The 100-turbine project could provide 1.3terawatt-hours (TW·h) of electric power per year – 15percent of all electric power used {{in the state of}} Rhode Island.

25|$|Offsets are {{typically}} achieved through financial support of projects that reduce the emission {{of greenhouse gases}} in the short- or long-term. The most common project type is renewable energy, such as wind farms, biomass energy, or hydroelectric dams. Others include energy efficiency projects, the destruction of industrial pollutants or agricultural byproducts, destruction of landfill methane, and forestry projects. Some {{of the most popular}} carbon offset projects from a corporate perspective are energy efficiency and wind <b>turbine</b> <b>projects.</b>|$|R
50|$|After World War I, {{the three}} {{brothers}} decided {{to expand the}} company and to concentrate on drive technologies. By 1922, Voith had begun building transmission gear assemblies, based on its fluid-dynamics know-how gained from previous <b>turbine</b> <b>projects.</b> This {{turned out to be}} yet another breakthrough, which was achieved with the aid of Hermann Föttinger, and his research on hydrodynamic energy transfers.
