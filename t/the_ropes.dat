5|$|During the {{subsequent}} exchange of strikes, Silva landed a direct right hook on Jackson's face, stunning Jackson and sending him backpedaling towards <b>the</b> <b>ropes.</b> Silva closed {{the distance and}} secured a Muay Thai clinch. From here, Silva landed approximately 5 knee strikes to Jackson's head, causing him to fall into <b>the</b> <b>ropes,</b> unconscious and with blood pouring out of his face. Silva was declared the winner by Knockout at 3:26 of the 2nd round to remain the Pride Middleweight Champion.|$|E
5|$|Managing {{to right}} himself, he became faint from the {{escaping}} gas and lashed himself to <b>the</b> <b>ropes</b> {{to prevent a}} fall. Realising the attempt was now a danger to himself and the balloon, L'Estrange set out the grappling hooks to catch onto something and bring the balloon down. However <b>the</b> <b>ropes</b> had become tangled and the hooks were too short.|$|E
5|$|The fourth {{match was}} for the WWE Tag Team Championship between René Duprée and Kenzo Suzuki and Rob Van Dam and Rey Mysterio. The match began with Van Dam and Duprée gaining the advantage. Mysterio was tagged in the match and {{performed}} a diving headbutt, a tornado DDT and a seated senton on Kenzo. Mysterio performed the 619 on Kenzo and attempted the West Coast Pop but Duprée pulled Mysterio off <b>the</b> <b>ropes.</b> Kenzo pinned Mysterio using <b>the</b> <b>ropes</b> to retain the title.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>rope</b> {{runs through}} <b>the</b> {{protection}} {{to a second}} person called the belayer. The belayer wears a harness that has a belay device attached. <b>The</b> <b>rope</b> threads through <b>the</b> belay device. By altering {{the position of the}} end of <b>the</b> <b>rope,</b> <b>the</b> belayer can vary the amount of tension on <b>the</b> <b>rope.</b> In one position, <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> runs freely through the belay device. In another position, it can easily be held without moving, because the tension on <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> is so great. This is called 'locking off' <b>the</b> <b>rope.</b>|$|R
50|$|A Prusik-Minding-Pulley {{is common}} in <b>rope</b> rescue. <b>The</b> <b>rope</b> to be pulled is passed through a pulley, and a Prusik is tied on the loaded side. When <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> is pulled, <b>the</b> Prusik rides against the pulley, and <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> slides through it; but when <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> is relaxed, <b>the</b> Prusik slides away from the pulley and grabs <b>the</b> <b>rope.</b> Thus, <b>the</b> {{combination}} acts as a ratchet.|$|R
50|$|The Grigri {{works by}} {{pinching}} <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> {{when it is}} moving quickly (like in a fall), making it an assisted braking belay device unlike traditional belay devices such as a Sticht plate or an ATC. Internally, <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> runs along a cam, which allows <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> to pass if moving slowly but when <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> moves quickly <b>the</b> cam will rotate, pinching <b>the</b> <b>rope.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{remaining}} {{boats were}} filled {{much closer to}} capacity and in an increasing rush. No.11 was filled with five people more than its rated capacity. As it was lowered, it was nearly flooded by water being pumped out of the ship. No.13 narrowly avoided the same problem but those aboard were unable to release <b>the</b> <b>ropes</b> from which the boat had been lowered. It drifted astern, directly under No.15 as it was being lowered. <b>The</b> <b>ropes</b> were cut in time and both boats made it away safely.|$|E
5|$|In {{the third}} match Team Guerrero (Eddie Guerrero, Big Show, Rob Van Dam, and John Cena) faced Team Angle (Kurt Angle, Mark Jindrak, Luther Reigns, and United States Champion Carlito) in a 4-on-4 Traditional Survivor Series Elimination Match. Carlito was {{eliminated}} as Cena chased {{him from the}} arena before the match began. Angle eliminated Van Dam after a roll-up using <b>the</b> <b>ropes</b> for leverage. Guerrero eliminated Jindrak after a roll-up, also using <b>the</b> <b>ropes</b> for leverage. Big Show eliminated Reigns after a chokeslam. Big Show eliminated Angle after an FU by Cena and a frog splash by Guerrero, meaning Team Guerrero won the match.|$|E
5|$|The Naturals (Andy Douglas and Chase Stevens) {{defended the}} NWA World Tag Team Championship against America's Most Wanted (Chris Harris and James Storm) in a bout which lasted {{fourteen}} minutes and ten seconds. The Naturals retained the title after Stevens scored the pinfall while using <b>the</b> <b>ropes</b> for leverage.|$|E
50|$|Once <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> {{is around}} <b>the</b> calf's neck, the roper signals {{the horse to}} stop suddenly. <b>The</b> <b>rope</b> {{is tied to the}} saddle horn with a string. When the calf hits the end of <b>the</b> <b>rope,</b> <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> is pulled tight and the string breaks. The {{breaking}} of the string marks the end of <b>the</b> run. <b>The</b> <b>rope</b> usually has a small white flag at the end that makes <b>the</b> moment <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> breaks more easily seen by the timer. The fastest run wins.|$|R
5000|$|Wake 360 front-to-front (wrapped) - While in {{the middle}} of the wake, pull {{yourself}} towards the boat, collecting <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> in one hand. Then, wrap <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> around your back, and hold onto the handle. Let go of <b>the</b> <b>rope,</b> and <b>the</b> friction of <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> straightening will spin you around.|$|R
50|$|At the Town Square, {{teams had}} to {{convince}} eight locals to jump <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> with them. <b>The</b> game would star with one person jumping <b>the</b> <b>rope,</b> then adding another one without stopping <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> until there were eight people jumping simultaneously {{for at least three}} cycles. If teams had to stop <b>the</b> <b>rope,</b> they would have to start again.|$|R
5|$|After that, Finlay faced Rey Mysterio. Both men {{performed}} many offensive maneuvers {{through the}} match, but Mysterio gained the advantage when he kicked Finlay as he hung from <b>the</b> <b>ropes,</b> {{followed by a}} Leg drop, sending Finlay to ringside area and striking his head. In result of an injury, Finlay was stretchered out of the ring, and Mysterio followed. Finlay, however, got up and attacked Mysterio, ending the match in a no contest.|$|E

5|$|Cotto and Judah {{delivered}} an all-action brawl, {{but after}} weathering some difficult early rounds as he figured out Judah's southpaw style and adjusted to his speed, Cotto {{took over the}} bout. In round seven, both fighters went toe-to-toe and in round eight he hurt Judah several times. In round nine, Judah took a knee to gain a breather from Cotto's aggressive style. By the tenth round, Judah was bleeding from a cut over his right eye and was hurt by an uppercut from Cotto that sent him retreating to <b>the</b> <b>ropes,</b> but Judah stayed upright. Early in the eleventh round, Cotto landed a combination that dropped Judah to the canvas. He managed {{to get to his}} feet, but Cotto went after Judah with a relentless attack, turning him sideways along <b>the</b> <b>ropes</b> as he continued to throw punches. That forced the referee to stop the fight.|$|E
5|$|Following the WWF World Heavyweight Championship match, {{the second}} round of the tournament began. Razor Ramon {{attacked}} his opponent, I.R.S., in the aisle before the match. The two brawled outside the ring. Afterwards, while using <b>the</b> <b>ropes</b> for leverage, I.R.S. gained the advantage inside the ring by applying a chinlock. Ramon escaped the hold, kicked Schyster and performed the Razor's Edge for the win.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} match {{of the actual}} event Carlito faced Chris Masters. In the beginning, Carlito had the {{advantage}} over Masters, as he performed a splash and Springboard Back elbow on Masters. Masters, however, gained the advantage and executed a Powerbomb. Carlito performed a Back Cracker. Carlito then pinned Masters while using <b>the</b> <b>ropes</b> for leverage to win the match.|$|E

50|$|The twine {{is first}} {{threaded}} diagonally through <b>the</b> <b>rope.</b> <b>The</b> twine is then wrapped round <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> including <b>the</b> diagonally threaded end. A needle is {{then used to}} thread the two ends through <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> to enclose <b>the</b> wrapping turns. Finally a reef (square) or a string of reef (square) knots is tied. Then this string of reef (square) knots is pulled through <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> to bury <b>the</b> ends.|$|R
40|$|Proper winding of <b>the</b> steel <b>rope</b> around <b>the</b> {{winch drum}} is great importance, mostly for: prolonging the service life of <b>the</b> <b>rope,</b> {{reduction}} of deformations {{of the body}} and the sides of the drum if the winding of <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> is multilayered, increasing of the safety factors, easier unwinding of <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> while lowering <b>the</b> load, even running of the drive unit, etc. The focus of this paper is on the analysis of the friction which occurs in the process of winding and unwinding <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> around <b>the</b> winch drum. Friction force is in its highest intensity when <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> passes from one layer to another, if the winding of <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> is multilayered. As the result of the research, certain mechanisms of winding of <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> from <b>the</b> aspects of the friction force were obtained, and the effects of the forces {{on the sides of the}} drum were analyzed...|$|R
5|$|In {{the first}} match of the tournament, Bam Bam Bigelow got the early {{advantage}} by attacking Razor Ramon from behind. Ramon gained momentum after Bigelow missed a diving headbutt, but Bigelow used {{his strength and}} got Ramon in a torture rack. As Bigelow climbed <b>the</b> <b>ropes,</b> however, Ramon threw {{him back into the}} ring and scored the pinfall.|$|E
5|$|Kevin Nash fought Samoa Joe in {{the seventh}} contest of the night. The match lasted 12 minutes. At two points during the match, Nash {{performed}} his signature Jackknife Powerbomb with Joe kicking out before the three count. This led to Nash hitting Joe in the groin and placing his feet on <b>the</b> <b>ropes</b> for leverage in his winning pin attempt.|$|E
5|$|The fifth contest was a Full Metal Mayhem {{match for}} a future match on Impact! for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. Early in the match, Abyss placed two tables {{side-by-side}} and then stacked two more on top of those at ringside. Mid-way through the match, Hardy grabbed Abyss and placed him on a table {{at the top of}} the entrance ramp, he then ascended to the roof of the entrance ramp and performed a front-flip, landing on Abyss in a move Hardy calls the Swanton Bomb. In the final minutes of the match, Hardy climbed a ladder and retrieved one of the envelopes, however, it was empty which meant the last one held the future championship match. Hardy then tried to move the ladder and retrieve the second envelope. While he was climbing again, Abyss grabbed him and pulled him down, he then threw Hardy against <b>the</b> <b>ropes.</b> When Hardy connected with <b>the</b> <b>ropes,</b> he flipped over them and crashed through the four tables set up earlier in the match. Abyss followed by climbing the ladder and removing the envelope to win the match.|$|E
5000|$|... back splice (also {{called an}} end splice) - A splice where {{the strands of}} the end of <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> are spliced {{directly}} back into the end without forming a loop. It is used to finish off the end of <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> to keep it from fraying. The end of <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> with <b>the</b> splice is about twice the thickness of the rest of <b>the</b> <b>rope.</b> With nylon and other plastic materials, the back splice is often no longer used; <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> strands are simply fused together with heat to prevent fraying.|$|R
50|$|Half knots {{are tied}} {{alternately}} behind {{and in front}} of <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> until <b>the</b> width of the band of twine approaches the diameter of <b>the</b> <b>rope.</b> A reef (square) knot, or better a series of reef (square) knots, completes the whipping. If a needle is available this string of reef (square) knots can be pulled through <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> to bury <b>the</b> ends. Alternatively, a short bight of another rope can be laid first and used to pull <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> ends through. If <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> is a stranded <b>rope,</b> <b>the</b> ends can usually be pulled through without a needle.|$|R

5|$|The first {{featured}} {{match was}} for the WWE United States Championship, where Orlando Jordan defended the title against Heidenreich. As the match began, Jordan was able to perform a dropkick, sending Heidenreich through <b>the</b> <b>ropes</b> to the outside. Heidenreich, however, would gain the advantage after countering Jordan's attack from the top rope into a suplex. Afterwards, Jordan delivered a DDT and pinned Heidenreich to retain the United States title.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} match saw Irwin R. Schyster face Mabel. When Schyster charged at Mabel {{before the}} bell, Mabel used his strength to block Schyster and to then powerslam him. Schyster {{was not able}} to use much offense due to the size of his opponent. He scored the win, however, when he shook <b>the</b> <b>ropes</b> as Mabel was about to attempt a maneuver from the top rope. Mabel fell to the mat, allowing I.R.S. to pin him.|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} match (which {{received}} a pre-match endorsement from Shawn Michaels) saw Adrian Neville challenging Bo Dallas in the first-ever ladder {{match for the}} NXT Championship. In {{the first half of}} the match, Dallas attempted to climb a ladder while he pinned Neville under the ladder, but Neville used his legs to push the ladder over. Near the end of the match, Neville attempted his signature Red Arrow, but Dallas pushed him off <b>the</b> <b>ropes</b> to the apron and the floor. Neville recovered and used <b>the</b> <b>ropes</b> to springboard over a climbing Dallas and leapfrog him on the ladder. In response, Dallas powerbombed Neville onto a ladder in the corner of the ring. Dallas then charged while holding a ladder, but Neville kicked the ladder into Dallas' face and slammed Dallas onto the ladder. Neville climbed to the top rope and dove off with his Red Arrow while Dallas was on the ladder. This incapacitated Dallas long enough for Neville to set up and climb the ladder to retrieve the NXT Championship hanging above the ring. The show ended with Neville celebrating with his new championship.|$|E
50|$|For {{the case}} of the horizon around a black hole, {{observers}} stationary with respect to a distant object will all agree on where the horizon is. While this seems to allow an observer lowered towards the hole on a rope (or rod) to contact the horizon, in practice this cannot be done. The proper distance to the horizon is finite, so <b>the</b> length of <b>rope</b> needed would be finite as well, but if <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> were lowered slowly (so that each point on <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> was approximately at rest in Schwarzschild coordinates), the proper acceleration (G-force) experienced by points on <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> {{closer and closer to the}} horizon would approach infinity, so <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> would be torn apart. If <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> is lowered quickly (perhaps even in freefall), then indeed the observer at the bottom of <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> can touch and even cross the event horizon. But once this happens it is impossible to pull <b>the</b> bottom of <b>rope</b> back out of the event horizon, since if <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> is pulled taut, the forces along <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> increase without bound as they approach the event horizon and at some point <b>the</b> <b>rope</b> must break. Furthermore, the break must occur not at the event horizon, but at a point where the second observer can observe it.|$|R
