5|$|Arriving in <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>wave</b> on Jig, the 56th Infantry Brigade was {{to capture}} Bayeux and a nearby ridge, thus cutting the N13 highway between Caen and Bayeux {{to make it}} {{difficult}} for the Germans to move in reinforcements. <b>The</b> <b>second</b> <b>wave</b> on King, the 151st Infantry Brigade, was tasked with capturing the Caen road and railway, along with setting up positions on high ground between the Aure and Seulles rivers. Other forces involved in the landing included artillery regiments, signals corps, and engineering units.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>second</b> <b>wave</b> of the 1918 {{pandemic}} {{was much}} deadlier than the first. The first wave had resembled typical flu epidemics; those {{most at risk}} were the sick and elderly, while younger, healthier people recovered easily. But in August, when <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>wave</b> began in France, Sierra Leone and the United States, the virus had mutated to a much deadlier form.|$|E
5000|$|One such {{example of}} the need to {{incorporate}} uniquely Indigenous perspectives is in <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>wave's</b> struggle for wage parity with their male counterparts. Celeste Liddle argues that [...] "for example, whilst equal pay is important for all of us, for many years Aboriginal people were historically not paid for their labour at all." [...] Therefore, <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>wave's</b> fight for wage equality (among other issues), was perceived to push the rights of Indigenous women to the periphery.|$|R

5|$|Along {{with the}} {{infantry}} landing in <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>wave,</b> supporting arms began to arrive, meeting the same chaos and destruction as had the rifle companies. Combat engineers, tasked with clearing the exits and marking beaches, landed off-target and without their equipment.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>second</b> <b>wave</b> {{was also}} not {{under the command of}} the Emperor and was made up of a number of armies with their own commanders. Together, this group and the first wave {{numbered}} an estimated 60,000.|$|E
5|$|In 1337 Flemish weavers {{settled and}} {{introduced}} {{the manufacture of}} woollen cloth. More Flemish weavers, fleeing the Huguenot persecutions, settled here in the 17th century. <b>The</b> <b>second</b> <b>wave</b> of settlers wove fustian, a rough cloth made of linen and cotton.

5|$|The {{fact that}} most of those who {{recovered}} from first-wave infections were now immune showed that {{it must have been the}} same strain of flu. This was most dramatically illustrated in Copenhagen, which escaped with a combined mortality rate of just 0.29% (0.02% in the first wave and 0.27% in <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>wave)</b> because of exposure to the less-lethal first wave.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>second</b> <b>wave</b> {{of assault}} troops arrived at 06:35 on 32 LCVPs. Companies A and D of 1st Battalion, 8th Infantry landed on Tare Green and G and H on Uncle Red. They were {{accompanied}} by engineers and demolition teams tasked with removing beach obstacles and clearing the area directly behind the beach of obstacles and mines.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>second</b> <b>wave</b> of {{parachute}} {{troops were}} dropped in two groups {{to the west}} of the cemetery at about midday. The drop zone was within fields of fire of the Partisans {{to the west of}} Drvar, and they suffered many casualties during the drop. Collecting the remainder, Rybka mounted a second attack, but the pressure on his flanks was too heavy, and the assault again failed. Fighting continued throughout the afternoon with both sides taking heavy casualties.|$|E
25|$|However, the Sisters of Mercy, who are {{frequently}} played at deathrock clubs, {{are generally not}} considered to be a deathrock band, as the most prominent example of their sound, Floodland, has more in common with second-wave gothic rock bands (as they were <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>wave's</b> prime influence).|$|R

5|$|After {{the lethal}} second wave struck in late 1918, new cases dropped abruptly– almost to nothing after {{the peak in}} <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>wave.</b> In Philadelphia, for example, 4,597 {{people died in the}} week ending 16 October, but by 11 November, {{influenza}} had almost disappeared from the city. One explanation for the rapid decline of the lethality of the disease is that doctors simply got better at preventing and treating the pneumonia that developed after the victims had contracted the virus, although John Barry stated in his book that researchers have found no evidence to support this.|$|E
5|$|Ivry {{received}} {{the green light}} at 10:00 AM to execute the operation, but by then he had postponed the attack until 2:00 PM. At 1:30 PM, Eitan ordered Ivry to strike, and the Israeli aircraft took off in pairs. The first wave {{was made up of}} 96 F-15s and F-16s. <b>The</b> <b>second</b> <b>wave</b> which attacked the SAM batteries at 3:50 PM was made up of 92 aircraft. When the attack was launched, the Syrians ordered their combat air patrols to return to base and land.|$|E
5|$|On 26 November 1940, the Iron Guard began {{a bloody}} {{retaliation}} against various political figures {{who had served}} under Carol (following a late investigation into the 1938 killing of Corneliu Zelea Codreanu, the movement's founder and early leader, by Carol's authorities). Tătărescu and Constantin Argetoianu were among <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>wave</b> of captured politicians (on 27 November), and were destined for arbitrary execution; they were, however, saved by the intervention of regular police forces, most of whom had grown hostile to the Guardist militias.|$|E

40|$|I {{present an}} {{overview}} of pulse propagation methods used in nonlinear optics, covering both full-field and envelope-and-carrier methods. Both wideband and narrowband cases are discussed. Three basic forms are considered [...] those based on (a) Maxwell's equations, (b) directional fields, and (c) <b>the</b> <b>second</b> order <b>wave</b> equation. While Maxwell's equations simulators are the most general, directional field methods can give significant computational and conceptual advantages. Factorizations of <b>the</b> <b>second</b> order <b>wave</b> equation complete the set by being the simplest to understand. One important conclusion is that that envelope methods based on forward-only directional field propagation has made the traditional envelope methods (such as the SVEA, and extensions) based on <b>the</b> <b>second</b> order <b>wave</b> equation utterly redundant.

5|$|On D-Day, the 1st Special Service Brigade was {{tasked with}} linking {{up with the}} 6th Airborne Division on the eastern flank of Sword and {{securing}} the high ground near La Plein. No. 3 Commando landed at La Breche, west of Ouistreham at 09:05 coming ashore in <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>wave.</b> They were engaged before they hit the beach, {{and three of the}} landing craft that the Commandos were travelling in were hit by high-velocity shells. Casualties were high, with No. 6 Troop suffering at least 20 wounded, but in the end they were lower than had been expected.|$|E
5|$|On the eastern-most beach, Fox Green, {{elements}} of five different companies had become entangled, {{and the situation}} was little improved by the equally disorganized landings of <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>wave.</b> Two more companies of the 3rd Battalion joined the melee, and, having drifted east in the first wave, I/16 finally made their traumatic landing on Fox Green, at 08:00. Two of their six boats were swamped on their detour to the east, and as they came in under fire, {{three of the four}} remaining boats were damaged by artillery or mines, and the fourth was hung up on an obstacle. A captain from this company found himself senior officer, and in charge of the badly out of shape 3rd Battalion.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>second</b> <b>wave</b> arrived over Belgrade about 10:00, {{consisting}} of 57 Junkers Ju 87 dive bombers and 30 Messerschmitt Bf 109E fighters. They {{were met by}} 15 of the remaining fighters from the 6th Fighter Brigade. This time the Yugoslavs claimed two dive bombers forced down, and one Bf 109E shot down. A patrol of Bf 109Es from the Yugoslav 31st Fighter Group based at Kragujevac, acting without orders of their group commander, followed the Germans as they returned to their bases and claimed two dive bombers shot down {{for the loss of}} both Yugoslav aircraft.|$|E

50|$|While postfeminism {{was first}} used in the 1980s to {{describe}} a backlash against second-wave feminism, it is now used as a label {{for a wide range}} of theories that take critical approaches to previous feminist discourses and includes challenges to <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>wave's</b> ideas. It may also be used to invoke the view that feminism is no longer relevant to today's society.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>second</b> <b>wave</b> of exterminations in the Soviet Union {{met with}} armed {{resistance}} in some areas, though {{the chance of}} success was poor. Weapons were typically primitive or home-made. Communications were impossible between ghettos in various cities, {{so there was no}} way to create a unified strategy. Few in the ghetto leadership supported resistance for fear of reprisals on the ghetto residents. Mass break-outs were sometimes attempted, though survival in the forest was nearly impossible due to the lack of food and the fact that escapees were often tracked down and killed.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>second</b> <b>wave,</b> {{scheduled}} for 06:35, consisted of 32 LCVPs carrying four more companies of 8th Infantry, {{as well as}} combat engineers and naval demolition teams that were to clear the beach of obstacles. The third wave, {{scheduled for}} 06:45, consisted of eight LCTs bringing more DD tanks plus armored bulldozers to assist in clearing paths off the beach. It was to be followed at 06:37 by the fourth wave, which had eight Landing Craft Mechanized (LCM) and three LCVPs with detachments of the 237th and 299th Combat Engineer Battalions, assigned to clear the beach between {{the high and low}} water marks.|$|E
5|$|This {{increased}} severity {{has been}} attributed to the circumstances of the First World War. In civilian life, natural selection favours a mild strain. Those who get very ill stay home, and those mildly ill continue with their lives, preferentially spreading the mild strain. In the trenches, natural selection was reversed. Soldiers with a mild strain stayed where they were, while the severely ill were sent on crowded trains to crowded field hospitals, spreading the deadlier virus. <b>The</b> <b>second</b> <b>wave</b> began and the flu quickly spread around the world again. Consequently, during modern pandemics health officials pay attention when the virus reaches places with social upheaval (looking for deadlier strains of the virus).|$|E
