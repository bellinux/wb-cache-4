5|$|A limited fauna {{is known}} from the upper section of the Oldman Formation, and Corythosaurus casuarius as well as C. intermedius are among the taxa.

Other genera are known, but do not persist from the upper section of <b>the</b> <b>formation,</b> <b>and</b> therefore are not contemporaries of Corythosaurus.|$|E

5|$|Planetary {{science is}} the study of the {{assemblage}} of planets, moons, dwarf planets, comets, asteroids, and other bodies orbiting the Sun, as well as extrasolar planets.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>formation</b> <b>and</b> {{evolution}} of the Solar System began 4.6billion {{years ago with the}} gravitational collapse of a small part of a giant molecular cloud.

5|$|After the Axis {{invasion}} of the Soviet Union in June 1941, Ante Pavelić, {{the leader of the}} newly created Axis puppet state the Independent State of Croatia (NDH), offered Adolf Hitler volunteers to serve on the Eastern Front. This offer soon resulted in <b>the</b> <b>formation</b> <b>and</b> deployment of army, air force and naval detachments which, after being trained and equipped by Germany, were committed to fighting the Red Army. The largest element was the 369th Croatian Reinforced Infantry Regiment, which was part of the 100th Jäger Division, but was decimated at Stalingrad in January 1943. The Croatian forces performed creditably on the Eastern Front, and the Germans continued to support the development of NDH forces with the aim of raising several divisions to serve there. Due to the lack of trained leaders and staff, these divisions were raised using a German cadre.|$|E
40|$|The {{analysis}} of the type-sections of <b>the</b> Tor <b>Formation</b> <b>and</b> Carnitza <b>Formation</b> in <b>the</b> neighbourhood of Raibl/Cave del Predil (southern Julian Alps) allows a better definition of the Upper Carnian stratigraphic and sequence stratigraphic setting in this classical area.

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{study has been}} carried out to understand <b>the</b> void <b>formation</b> <b>and</b> breaking in a packed bed using two-dimensional glass models. No experimental data are available in the literature on void initiation and breaking which is essential to understand the aerodynamics of the packed bed reactors such as blast furnace, catalytic reformer and solid drying process. The effect of particle size, density, gas flow rate, bed height and model width on <b>the</b> <b>formation</b> of void <b>and</b> its breaking has been studied in detail. The effect of frictional properties of the particulate material on <b>the</b> void <b>formation</b> <b>and</b> breaking has also been studied using modified Janssen's equation. Pressure and velocity measurements have been taken using manometers and a hot wire anemometer to understand <b>the</b> void <b>formation</b> <b>and</b> breaking phenomena.

5|$|As a defence {{against the}} cold, {{a colony of}} emperor {{penguins}} forms a compact huddle (also known as the turtle formation) {{ranging in size from}} ten to several hundred birds, with each bird leaning forward on a neighbour.

5|$|At 08:13, {{the first}} {{formations}} took off. In total, 64 Fw 190D-9s participated. Before {{the target was}} reached, some 14 D-9s were forced to turn back due to AAA damage or mechanical difficulties. Three Fw 190s were lost to German AAA fire. At 09:10, when the front was reached, Allied heavy AAA units began to engage <b>the</b> <b>formation</b> <b>and</b> another five were shot down. Most of the fire was from British Naval AAA defences defending the Scheldt Estuary. As the formation crossed the Dutch and Belgian border, I./JG 26 and III./JG 54 were intercepted by Spitfires. Five of the Fw 190s were shot down. I./JG 26 destroyed or damaged the few aircraft at the airfield. AAA defences claimed five kills and I./JG 26 reported two Fw 190s lost to Spitfires. Several others were lost over the airfield. Other losses occurred against friendly fire again on the return flight.|$|E
5|$|Dungeon Siege is {{an action}} {{role-playing}} game {{set in a}} pseudo-medieval high fantasy world, presented in 3D with a third-person virtual camera system {{under the control of}} the player, in which the player characters navigate the terrain and fight off hostile creatures. The player chooses the gender and customizes the appearance of the main character of the story prior to the start of the game and typically controls them. The main character is joined by up to seven other characters, which are controlled via artificial intelligence; the player may switch which character they are controlling at any time. The other characters move in relation to the controlled character according to <b>the</b> <b>formation</b> <b>and</b> level of aggression towards enemies chosen by the player. The additional characters can be disbanded from the group and re-recruited.|$|E
