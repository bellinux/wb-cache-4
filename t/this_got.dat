This was an attempt to give a false front of authority to the Lao communist movement by claiming to represent a united non-partisan effort.

25|$|The CIA's prime {{source in}} Lebanon was Bashir Gemayel, {{a member of}} the Christian Maronite sect. The CIA was blinded by the {{uprising}} against the Maronite minority. Israel invaded Lebanon, and, along with the CIA, propped up Gemayel. <b>This</b> <b>got</b> Gemayel's assurance that Americans would be protected in Lebanon. 13 days later he was assassinated. Imad Mughniyah, a Hezbollah assassin would target Americans in retaliation for the Israeli invasion, the Sabra and Shatila massacre, and the US Marines of the Multi-National Force for their role in opposing the PLO in Lebanon. On April 18, 1983, a 2,000lb car bomb exploded {{in the lobby of the}} American embassy in Beirut, killing 63 people including 17 Americans, and 7 CIA officers, including Robert Ames, one of the CIA's best Middle East experts. America's fortunes in Lebanon would only suffer more as America's poorly-directed retaliation for the bombing was interpreted by many as support for the Christian Maronite minority. On October 23, 1983, two bombs (1983 Beirut Bombing) were set off in Beirut, including a 10 ton bomb at a US military barracks that killed 242 people. Both attacks are believed to have been planned by Iran by way of Mughniyah.|$|E
