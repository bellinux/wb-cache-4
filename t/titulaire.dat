2500|$|Henry J. Wood {{performed}} the E minor organ concerto of Ebenezer Prout at the Hall with an orchestra under Joseph Barnby, {{in the late}} 1880s. Although the performance earned him much praise, {{he referred to the}} instrument as 'that terrible box of whistles at St. James's Hall'. [...] This had not seemed to bother Camille Saint-Saëns when he premiered his third Symphony there (in which two sections make extensive use of the organ) in 1886. Saint-Saëns was a fine organist, and was <b>titulaire</b> of Église de la Madeleine in Paris.

2500|$|The first organist was W.T.Best (1826–97) who was {{appointed}} in 1855 and served until 1894.

[...] On 21December 1940 the hall and its organ were damaged in an air-raid. It {{was not possible to}} obtain sufficient money to rebuild the organ until the 1950s. In 1954 Henry Willis &Sons were asked to undertake this project and DrCaleb E.Jarvis (190380) was its consultant. [...] DrJarvis was appointed organist in 1957 and on his death in 1980 he was succeeded by Noel Rawsthorne (born 1929), who had just retired as organist to the Anglican Cathedral. Noel Rawsthorne served as organist to the hall for four years.

2500|$|It was {{the second}} great change that made Notre-Dame-de-Lorette Franck's parish church: his {{appointment}} there as assistant organist in 1847, {{the first of a}} succession of increasingly more important and influential organ posts. [...] Although young Franck had never shone at the Conservatoire as organist in the manner that he had as pianist, he had wanted an organist's position, not least because it provided a steady income. [...] He now had occasion to match his Roman Catholic devotion with learning the skills needed for accompanying public worship, as well as the occasional opportunity [...] to fill in for his superior, Alphonse Gilbat. [...] In this position he won the favorable attention of the church's Abbé Dancel, who in 1851 moved to the new church of Saint-Jean-Saint-François-au-Marais (a small church in Le Marais district), as curé and two years later invited Franck to assume the position of <b>titulaire,</b> or primary organist. [...] Franck's new church possessed a fine new organ (1846) by Aristide Cavaillé-Coll, who had been making a name for himself as an artistically gifted and mechanically innovative creator of magnificent new instruments. [...] "My new organ," [...] Franck said, [...] "it's like an orchestra!" [...] Franck's improvisatory skills were now in much demand, since liturgical practice of the time required the ability to take the plainsong music sung for the Mass or the Office and to develop from it organ music fitting into the service between texts sung or spoken by the choir or clergy. [...] Furthermore, Franck's playing ability and his love of the Cavaillé-Coll instruments led to his collaboration with the builder to demonstrate the latter's instruments, Franck travelling to towns throughout France to show off older instruments or play inaugural concerts on new ones.|$|E

40|$|L’étude de la garde-robe des maréchaux de France au xviiie siècle peut servir de prisme à l’étude des différences de fortune, de mode de vie et de {{distinction}} entre ces grands officiers de la couronne. Les maréchaux de France avaient pour fonction de commander en chef les armées. Au xviiie siècle, jusqu’à l’obtention du maréchalat, leur carrière fut essentiellement militaire. Parmi les quatre-vingt <b>titulaires</b> de cette dignité, nombreux furent ceux qui obtinrent des charges curiales, de gouvernement, des missions, des honneurs et des distinctions. Ils participèrent à nombre de cérémonies au cours du siècle et furent des acteurs de la vie à Versailles ou dans les châteaux royaux. <b>Titulaires</b> d’une dignité unique qui les rapprochait, les écarts de fortune n’en étaient pas moins grands entre un maréchal duc et pair de France et un marin oublié. Il s’agit de proposer une approche générale puis comparée de leur garde-robe, comprenant l’ensemble des vêtements possédés au moment de leur décès. The Dress Code of a Social Elite {{during the}} French Enlightenment. The Marshals of France and their Wardrobes - The {{study of the}} wardrobe of the Marshals of France during the 18 th century {{is likely to be}} an indication of discrepancies in wealth, ways of life and distinctions between the Great officers of the crown. The Marshals of France were commanders-in-chief of the military forces. From the 18 th century to their being granted the title of marshals, their carriers were mainly military ones. A large number of the eighty-four holders of this title were allowed to work in governmental or diplomatic fields. They were honored and conferred distinctions as well. They took part in many ceremonies and were prominent figures of life in Versailles or royal castles. They held a unique title that created a bond between them. However, discrepancies in wealth were nonetheless drastic. For instance, a Marshal, who was also a duke and peer of France, {{had nothing to do with}} a forgotten sailor. A broad approach to the wardrobe they owned when they died, followed by a comparative study of the latter, will be analyzed...|$|R
40|$|Since {{the time}} of Cavaille-Coll, the grand organs of the Cathedral of Notre-Dame and the parish church of Saint-Sulpice, Paris, have enjoyed steady {{international}} recognition and attention. This is due not only to their status as Cavaille-Coll's two largest creations and among his most famous opera {{but also for the}} subsequent tonal and mechanical changes made to them over the years by their <b>titulaires</b> and restorers. Although both instruments were comparable in size and completed within six years of each other, various installation peculiarities and Cavaille-Coll's ever-evolving style produced two rather different instruments whose tonal paths have diverged yet more ever since. The organ in Saint-Sulpice, of which the majority of tonal resources, mechanisms, and chests are still as they were in 1862, has escaped significant invasive overhaul. In contrast, since its completion in 1868, the Notre-Dame organ has undergone radical alteration more than once and now stands as a monument as much to modern technological progress as to its various builders. This oblique divergence between the two organs is largely the result of changes made to the Notre-Dame organ by <b>titulaires</b> Louis Vierne and Pierre Cochereau. However, the modern-day use of these organs also represents important differences between the two. The Notre-Dame organ is now capable of playing literature from all eras of organ music, yet improvisation is the most performed genre on this organ. In contrast, the organ at Saint-Sulpice is better suited to playing French music, yet it is on this organ that the music of German composers such as Bach and Mendelssohn is also regularly played. Social matters are also of interest. "Decorum" and guarded admission were de rigueur at Saint-Sulpice during the tenures of Charles-Marie Widor and Marcel Dupre. Such intense social consciousness was not so strict at Notre-Dame. In contrast, today the Saint-Sulpice organ is a weekly host to numerous tourists, but that of Notre-Dame is virtually inaccessible to the unannounced visitor. Finally, although alterations are necessarily shaped by the personalities involved, other factors such as architecture and even the weather have also played important roles in the daily use of these instruments...|$|R
2500|$|In {{his search}} to master new organ-playing {{techniques}} {{he was both}} challenged and stimulated by his third and last change in organ posts. [...] On 22 January 1858, he became organist and maître de chapelle at the newly consecrated Sainte-Clotilde (from 1896 the Basilique-Sainte-Clotilde), where he remained until his death. [...] Eleven months later, the parish installed a new three-manual Cavaillé-Coll instrument, whereupon he was made <b>titulaire,</b> Théodore Dubois taking over as choirmaster and assistant organist. [...] The impact of this organ on Franck's performance and composition cannot be overestimated; together with his early pianistic experience it shaped his music-making {{for the remainder of}} his life. Norbert Dufourcq described this instrument as [...] "unquestionably the constructor's masterpiece up to this time". [...] Franck himself told the curé of Sainte-Clotilde: [...] "If you only knew how I love this instrument [...] [...] [...] it is so supple beneath my fingers and so obedient to all my thoughts!". [...] To prepare himself for this organ's capabilities (including its thirty-note pedal), Franck purchased a practice pedalboard from Pleyel et Cie for home practice to improve his technique, as well as spending many hours at the organ keyboard. [...] The beauty of its sound and the mechanical facilities provided by the instrument assisted his reputation as improviser and composer, not only for organ music but in other genres as well. [...] Pieces for organ, for choir, and for harmonium began to circulate, among the most notable of which was the Messe à 3 voix (1859). [...] The quality of the movements in this work, composed over a number of years, is uneven, but from it comes one of Franck's most enduring compositions, the communion anthem [...] "Panis Angelicus". [...] More notable still is the set of Six Pièces for organ, written 1860–1862 (although not published until 1868). [...] These compositions (dedicated to fellow organists and pianists, to his old master Benoist, and to Cavaillé-Coll) remain part of modern organ repertory and were, according to Rollin Smith, the first major contribution to French organ literature in over a century, and [...] "the most important organ music written since Mendelssohn's." [...] The group includes two of his best-known organ works, the [...] "Prélude, Fugue, et Variation", op. 18 and the [...] "Grande Pièce Symphonique", op. 17.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{examination}} of the professional origin of the successive presidents of the French Geological Society provides information concerning the respective influence exerted by the main groups of geologists. Through time, {{it is possible to}} note that the clear initial predominance of the "Corps des mines" was followed by a relative decline during the second half century. The academic geologists, who were in extremely small number at the beginning, increased their influence during the second half-century, so that their number became equivalent to that of the mining engineers. Charles Lory, the first provincial university professor to become president was elected in 1883. The proper influence of the French National Museum of Natural History has been increasing because of the progressive withdrawal of the professors belonging to the "Corps des mines". During the third half century, the university professors became clearly predominant, the proportion of provincial professors increasing sensibly after 1950. Another result {{of this study is to}} have emphasized the active role played by the "amateurs" during the first century of the French geological Society, the last one having occupied the chair in 1940 - 1941. L'examen de l'origine professionnelle des présidents successifs de la Société géologique de France procure des informations sur l'influence respective exercée par les principaux corps de géologues. Au cours du temps, on remarque que la nette prédominance initiale du Corps des mines a été suivie d'un déclin relatif durant le second demi-siècle. Les universitaires, extrêmement minoritaires à l'origine, firent pratiquement jeu égal avec les ingénieurs des mines durant le second demi-siècle. Charles Lory, le premier universitaire provincial accéda au fauteuil en 1883. L'influence propre du Muséum national d'Histoire naturelle s'accrut également, notamment en raison de la réduction progressive des <b>titulaires</b> de chaires appartenant au Corps des mines. Durant le troisième demi-siècle, les universitaires devinrent nettement prédominants, la proportion de provinciaux augmentant sensiblement après 1950. Un autre enseignement de cette étude est de souligner le rôle actif joué par les " amateurs " pendant le premier siècle de la Société géologique, le dernier d'entre eux ayant présidé celle-ci en 1940 - 1941...|$|R
40|$|The {{title of}} disposal, and {{especially}} the quasi-usufruct {{is the right to}} dispose of the ownership of another person with the same rights as the owner himself, but provided that you preserve the original purpose and you ensure the identical benefit in value or in kind. It has an immediate credit faculty or a medium or long term credit facility, depending on whether it {{takes the form of a}} quasiusufruct or of a pledge or of a mortgage. Quasi- usufructuary, irregular depositor, pledge chargee or mortgagee are in fact all holders of a title of disposal. They have the right to destroy the good of a third party, to sell it, or to constrain it with legal obligations for their own profit and without becoming owners. Because their right to dispose is distinct from that included in the ownership (art. 544 civ. c). It is independent and can not be identified with a mean of acquiring or with a reduction right of ownership : it's a title comprising the use of the good of a third party (the + abusus;), made up of the allocation of the value of the goods of a third party to the donor or to a good of the donor, and subsidiary to the right of this one. It comprises an accurate legal framework : it follows the establishment and the cancellation rules of the estate rights, subject to the changes imposed by its content (the abusus), by its purpose (notably the intangible goods) or the governing contract (for example the depository agreement which take the effect of the irregular deposit and is distinguished from the consumer loan since it can not transfer the ownership). Le droit réel de disposer, et specialement le quasi-usufruit, est le droit de disposer du bien d'autrui pour son propre compte, comme le propriétaire lui-meme, mais a charge d'en respecter la destination et d'en assurer la restitution à l'identique, en équivalent ou en valeur. Il remplit une fonction de credit immediat ou une fonction de credit a moyen ou long terme, selon qu'il prend la forme d'un quasi-usufruit ou d'un gage ou d'une hypotheque. Quasi-usufruitier, depositaire irregulier, creancier gagiste ou hypothecaire, sont, en effet, tous <b>titulaires</b> d'un droit reel de disposer : ils ont le droit de detruire le bien d'autrui, de l'aliener ou de le grever de droits reels, pour leur profit personnel et sans en devenir proprietaires. Car leur droit de disposer est distinct de celui inclus dans la propriete (v. Art. 544 c. civ.). Il est autonome et ne s'identifie pas a un mode d'acquisition de la propriete d'autrui ou a un diminutif du droit de propriete : c'est un droit reel forme d'une utilite du bien d'autrui (l'abusus), constitue par l'affectation de la valeur du bien d'autrui au disposant ou a un bien du disposant, et soumis au droit de propriete de celui-ci. Il est dote d'un regime juridique precis : il suit les regles de constitution et d'extinction des droits patrimoniaux, sous reserve des adaptations imposees par son contenu (l'abusus), par son objet (notamment les biens incorporels) ou par le contrat qui le porte (par exemple le contrat de depot qui prend alors la configuration du depot irregulier et se distingue du pret de consommation puisqu'il n'est pas translatif de propriete) ...|$|R
