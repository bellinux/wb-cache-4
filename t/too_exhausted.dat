5|$|On {{arrival at}} the Anhalter Station at Berlin, List felt <b>too</b> <b>exhausted</b> to {{continue}} the journey. After a doctor had diagnosed a lung inflammation his health deteriorated quickly, and he died in a Berlin guesthouse {{on the morning of}} 17 May 1919. He was cremated in Leipzig and his ashes laid in an urn and then buried at the Vienna Central Cemetery, Zentralfriedhof. An obituary of List authored by Berlin journalist Philipp Stauff then appeared in the Münchener Beobachter.|$|E
5|$|The {{effect of}} Rupert's actions, {{even after his}} forces disengaged, was to force another delay in the Parliamentarian retreat; Essex spent much of 19 September looking after wounded {{soldiers}} and, when he finally managed to begin moving again, he was confronted with swampland and bog which further delayed him while the Royalists marched across the relatively open chalk downs above the Kennet. These hardships meant that the Royalists arrived at Newbury before Essex, with both armies settling down for the night outside the town, <b>too</b> <b>exhausted</b> to immediately fight.|$|E
5|$|While {{she tried}} to involve herself {{in the arts and}} {{sciences}} and distance herself from society protocols, she continued to feel the burden of her duties. Christmas 1877 provided respite for Alice, as all the family gathered together again, and she doted on her youngest daughters Alix and Marie. She was <b>too</b> <b>exhausted</b> to attend the wedding of her niece, Princess Charlotte of Prussia, in Berlin, in January 1878. In the Autumn of 1878, Queen Victoria paid for the Grand Ducal family to holiday in Eastbourne, where they stayed in a house on the Grand Parade. Alice performed various royal duties on this trip and visited her mother at Osborne before returning to the New Palace at Darmstadt in late 1878.|$|E
50|$|Jeff Chandler played Boynton {{and stayed}} with the role for five years, even after {{becoming}} a movie star. He ultimately resigned because it was <b>too</b> <b>exhausting</b> to juggle a regular radio role with his film commitments.|$|R
50|$|Born as Lina Batschauer, {{she started}} {{competing}} in athletics {{at the age}} of 20. In those years sports such as running were considered far <b>too</b> <b>exhausting</b> for women. This vision was shared by many, including the originator of the modern Olympic movement, Pierre de Coubertin.|$|R
50|$|James Hope is {{a fictional}} {{character}} from the British ITV soap opera Emmerdale. He was played by Alex Carter and first appeared onscreen on 16 February 2006. On 8 February 2010, Carter {{announced that he}} was quitting the show, citing his reason that he found the Emmerdale filming schedule <b>too</b> <b>exhausting.</b>|$|R
5|$|Even {{though the}} {{offensive}} captured {{a portion of}} the targeted area, including the town of Lipik as the first of the larger settlements captured by the HV during the war, the mission objectives were not met before the ceasefire took effect. SAO Western Slavonia retained control of the town of Okučani and its surroundings, including a short section of the Zagreb–Slavonski Brod motorway. The halting of Operation Hurricane-91 due to the ceasefire of 3 January 1992 led to opposing assessments on the possible outcomes of the offensive had there been no ceasefire. Assessments range from claims that the JNA was on the brink of defeat in the area, to estimates that the HV was <b>too</b> <b>exhausted</b> and its ammunition stocks too low to permit a successful conclusion of the offensive. The three HV offensives launched in Western Slavonia in late-1991 led to the displacement of approximately 20,000 Croatian Serb refugees who were later settled in the JNA-held Baranja region in eastern Croatia.|$|E
5|$|The {{expedition}} {{arrived at}} its final destination of Libreville on 21 March, after twenty-seven days. The {{block of ice}} was found to weigh 2,714kg; it had lost only 336kg along the way. Though it was unclear how much time the expedition would take, Klevan had initially estimated a loss of 10%; the end result was approximately 11%. A French representative of the company met the crew in Libreville. A personal friend of President Charles de Gaulle, he presented an offer to drive the ice back to Paris. If the crew accepted, the President himself would have received the crew under the Arc de Triomphe. The men, however, were <b>too</b> <b>exhausted</b> at that point to contemplate such an offer. Instead, arrangement were made for the vehicles to be brought back by freight, while the crew would fly home. The ice was cut up and divided between the citizens of Libreville, for whom this was a rare commodity. Klevan, always conscious of promotional opportunities, brought {{a portion of the}} ice back home with him. This ice was subsequently used in drinks served to journalists at the première of the expedition documentary back home in Oslo.|$|E
25|$|Brahe {{might have}} stayed at Cooper Creek longer, {{but one of}} his men, the {{blacksmith}} Patton, had injured his leg after being thrown from his horse, so they decided to leave for Menindee that morning. Patton was to die from complications six weeks later. Burke and Wills discussed catching up with them, but they were <b>too</b> <b>exhausted</b> and decided to wait.|$|E
50|$|The gang confronts Mahoney but {{finds out}} {{he is the}} {{rightful}} heir to the manor.

25|$|Qin was <b>too</b> <b>exhausted</b> {{to follow}} up its victory. Some time later it sent an army to besiege the Zhao capital but the army was {{destroyed}} when it was attacked from the rear. Zhao survived, {{but there was no}} longer a state that could resist Qin on its own. The other states could have survived if they remained united against Qin, but they did not.|$|E
25|$|As soon as Bakari was sighted, {{a member}} of the rescue team threw her a life preserver, but the waters were too rough, and she was <b>too</b> <b>exhausted</b> to grab it. One of the sailors, Maturaffi Sélémane Libounah, jumped into the water and handed her a {{flotation}} device, after which they were both pulled safely aboard the Sima Com 2, where she was given dry blankets and a hot drink.|$|E
25|$|On {{the morning}} of 26 December, {{elements}} of Golitsyn's 4th Division reached Golymin. They were <b>too</b> <b>exhausted</b> to continue to Makow and Golitsyn also needed to wait for units of Sacken's 3rd Division. In the village he found Dokhturov, who had sent most of his 5th Division towards Makow, but remained at Golymin with a dragoon and an infantry regiment. Golitsyn hoped to rest his men before continuing their retreat.|$|E
50|$|The same year, Bassie & Adriaan {{converted}} another radio-play into a TV-series; it {{was their}} first since The Poltergeist not to be filmed abroad. Adriaan found it <b>too</b> <b>exhausting</b> to play two roles as well as directing the series; Paul van Gorcum (Archibald Chagrijn during The Crying Professor and the museums warden from The Diamond) took {{over the role of}} the Baron.|$|R

He would want to control you entirely. He cannot allow that there is any other mind than his own. And then the real clumsiness of his mind is its lack of self-criticism. No, I {{think it would}} be {{perfectly}} intolerable.' ...|$|R
50|$|Usually {{wearing a}} bow tie and top hat, Timer looks {{somewhat}} {{like a little}} yellow blob with long arms and legs, and a face. Timer also has limited magical powers, such as instant transportation, which he often uses to exit his host body {{from time to time}} if things got <b>too</b> <b>exhausting.</b> A wise-cracker as well as a song-and-dance man, Timer promotes healthy eating and personal hygiene for children, using clever songs and animation.|$|R
25|$|After Yuan Shao's {{defeat at}} Guandu, many cities within his {{territory}} {{north of the}} Yellow River rebelled and switched allegiance to Cao Cao. Despite this, Cao Cao's forces were <b>too</b> <b>exhausted</b> from the strain of battle {{to take advantage of}} the situation. Yuan Shao still retained a presence south of the river at Cangting (倉亭; north of present-day Yanggu County, Shandong), a lone bridgehead down the river east from the battlefields of Guandu.|$|E
25|$|The battle {{wound down}} and was broken off {{due to the}} cold, rainy weather and the {{exhaustion}} of the men but the two armies stayed in position on the battlefield. Bragg finally decided {{to withdraw from the}} field on January 3, 1863 because he feared Rosecrans was being reinforced. Rosecrans's force, including the regulars, were <b>too</b> <b>exhausted</b> to pursue the retreating Confederates, and also were hindered because the Confederates captured or destroyed much of the Union Army's food.|$|E
25|$|In February 1772, the {{agreement}} of partition was signed in Vienna. Early in August, Russian, Prussian and Austrian troops simultaneously invaded the Commonwealth and occupied the provinces agreed upon among themselves. On August 5, 1772, the occupation manifesto was issued, much {{to the consternation of}} a country <b>too</b> <b>exhausted</b> by the endeavors of the Confederation of Bar to offer successful resistance; nevertheless, several battles and sieges took place, as Commonwealth troops refused to lay down their arms (most notably, in Tyniec, Częstochowa and Kraków).|$|E

25|$|When McGowan's men {{finally gave}} way, Cooke's brigades {{collapsed}} {{from east to}} west although Cooke's own brigade was farthest {{from the end of the}} line and withdrew in better order than the other survivors who managed to escape. The Confederates who did not become casualties or prisoners retreated toward the Appomattox River, moving mostly in disorder toward Amelia Court House. The South Side Railroad, the final Confederate supply line to Petersburg, had been permanently severed by the Union Army. Most of Miles's men were <b>too</b> <b>exhausted</b> to pursue the Confederate fugitives. Besides, Miles understood that Sheridan had ordered his men to drive the enemy toward Petersburg, so he turned his division in that direction and allowed them to rest.|$|E
25|$|Smith and Bragg met in Chattanooga on July 31, 1862, and {{devised a}} plan for the campaign: The newly created Army of Kentucky, {{including}} two of Bragg's brigades and approximately 21,000 men, would march north under Kirby Smith's command into Kentucky to dispose of the Union defenders of Cumberland Gap. (Bragg's army was <b>too</b> <b>exhausted</b> from its long journey to begin immediate offensive operations.) Smith would return to join Bragg, and their combined forces would attempt to maneuver into Buell's rear and force a battle to protect his supply lines. Any attempt by Ulysses S. Grant to reinforce Buell from northern Mississippi would be handled by the two small armies of Maj. Gens. Sterling Price and Earl Van Dorn.|$|E
25|$|On {{the morning}} of September 1, Pope ordered Maj. Gen. Edwin V. Sumner of the II Corps, Army of the Potomac, to send a brigade north to reconnoiter; the army's cavalry was <b>too</b> <b>exhausted</b> for the mission. But at the same time, he {{continued}} his movement {{in the direction of}} Washington, sending McDowell's corps to Germantown (on the western border of modern-day Fairfax, Virginia), where it could protect the important intersection of Warrenton Pike and Little River Turnpike that the army needed for the retreat. He also sent two brigades from Maj. Gen. Jesse L. Reno's IX Corps, under the command of Brig. Gen. Isaac Stevens, to block Jackson. Maj. Gen. Philip Kearny's division from the III Corps followed later that afternoon.|$|E

50|$|Ladakh was a wazarat (district) with a {{governor}} called wazir-e-wazarat. It had three tehsils: Leh, Kargil and Skardu. Initially, the Wazir {{used to spend}} four months each at Leh, Kargil and Skardu. But shifting the entire staff so often proved <b>too</b> <b>exhausting</b> and, so, the shifting was eventually limited to Leh and Skardu. The city of Kargil always had a tehsil headquarters. It was a key centre, being equidistant from Srinagar, Leh and Skardu. Zanskar, which was once part of the Kishtwar district was merged into the Kargil tehsil.|$|R
50|$|The {{daughter}} of violinist Ludovicus Adolphus Bouwmeester and pianist Julie Marie Arpeau, Lily Bouwmeester {{was born in}} Amsterdam. As a child, she toured with her parents through Europe, while preparing to become a violinist as well. The touring proved to be <b>too</b> <b>exhausting</b> for Bouwmeester, so she {{moved in with her}} aunt in 1913, the actress Theo Mann-Bouwmeester. She dreamed to become a dancer, but her aunt demanded for her to become an actress and sent her to several auditions. At the age of 14, she debuted in a theatre production of Herman Heijermans.|$|R
25|$|Murat's Reserve Cavalry Corps and Augereau's 7th Corps set out {{towards the}} town {{at first light}} (around 7 am). Lasalle's Cavalry Division {{were the first to}} arrive from the {{south-west}} at about 10am. Golitsyn reinforced his rearguard of two squadrons of cavalry with three squadrons of cuirassiers, and Lasalle's men were driven back to the woods. But at around 2 p.m. Augereau's Corps appeared from the east. Golitsyn gave up his attempt to retreat, as his men were <b>too</b> <b>exhausted</b> to retire without fighting. He sent one regiment of infantry under the command of Prince Shcherbatov into the woods around Kaleczin and posted the rest of his troops in front of Golymin. He put his cavalry and Dokhturov's troops as his reserves, and positioned the rest of his division in front of Golymin.|$|E
25|$|On January 18, Russian forces {{launched}} a massive air and artillery attack; by Chechen estimation, rockets were hitting the palace {{at a rate}} of one per second. Sukhoi Su-25 fighter aircraft dropped two bunker busters into the Palace. The bombs fell through all 11 floors and fell into the reinforced bunker below the building; one landed 20 meters from the HQ of General Maskhadov, miraculously not exploding. Before midnight, the Chechen command left the Palace in three groups, Maskhadov being among the last to leave. These groups retreated to a hospital {{on the south side of}} the Sunzha River, while Russian helicopters flew over the city calling on Chechens to surrender with no effect. According to elements of the Chechen command, Russian snipers had Chechens in full sight but were <b>too</b> <b>exhausted</b> to continue fighting.|$|E
25|$|Advanced Union skirmishers {{continued}} to {{fire at the}} Confederate positions from {{the house on the}} field and other outbuildings {{on the south side of}} the creek. Colonel Hill asked four volunteers to go forward and burn the house. Fire from across the main road stopped them and they dove to the ground. One of them, Private Henry L. Wyatt, had been killed. The others were called back and soon Major Randolph was able to destroy the house with artillery fire. Lieutenant Greble, whose guns had been hidden by the house, {{continued to}} fire and exposed his position. By this time the battle was ending and Peirce ordered all of his force to retire. It was clear that the Confederate position was too strong and his troops were <b>too</b> <b>exhausted</b> to continue a costly and increasingly futile attack.|$|E
