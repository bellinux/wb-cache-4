5|$|Hesse had {{anticipated}} {{some kind of}} attack from the rear and had kept a mobile force in reserve to guard against such an eventuality. It was formed by an English company, and two Spanish companies: a regular company under captain Francisco de Sandoval and a Catalan company of miquelets under Jaume Burguy, numbering 300 men, all of them led by Hesse's brother Heinrich. This reserve immediately responded and engaged the Spanish Bourbons at Middle Hill. Although the Bourbons {{had the advantage of}} height, they were effectively trapped against <b>the</b> <b>precipice</b> of the Rock and only had three rounds of ammunition each, as a result of travelling light; they had not come prepared for a pitched battle.|$|E
5|$|In The Path of the Hobbits, Frodo, Sam and Gollum {{must first}} escape from Osgiliath, {{fighting}} past orcs {{to get to}} the sewers and ensuring that Frodo is not captured by the Nazgûl. However, upon escaping, Gollum decides to betray them and take the Ring back for himself. He tricks Frodo into going on without Sam, but Sam follows them into Shelob's lair. In the lair, Gollum abandons Frodo, and Sam must fight past spiders and orcs, eventually facing Shelob herself, who has attacked Frodo. Sam defeats Shelob, but upon reaching Frodo, he mistakenly believes him to be dead. About to go to Mount Doom on his own, he hides as a group of orcs arrive, and hears them say that Frodo is alive, but unconscious. They take him with them as Sam follows them to the Tower of Cirith Ungol. As Sam is about to enter the Tower, the orcs begin fighting among themselves, and Sam uses the distraction to rescue Frodo. Together, they head to Mount Doom. However, before Frodo can throw the Ring into the lava below, he is attacked by Gollum, who takes the Ring. In the final level, the player controls Frodo as he fights Gollum on the edge of <b>the</b> <b>precipice.</b> Frodo successfully defeats Gollum, knocking him into the lava and destroying the Ring forever.|$|E

25|$|This {{prayer was}} responded {{to by the}} {{congregation}} present. A man was selected, preferably a priest, to take the goat to <b>the</b> <b>precipice</b> in the wilderness; and he was accompanied {{part of the way}} by the most eminent men of Jerusalem. Ten booths had been constructed at intervals along the road leading from Jerusalem to the steep mountain. At each one of these the man leading the goat was formally offered food and drink, which he, however, refused. When he reached the tenth booth those who accompanied him proceeded no further, but watched the ceremony from a distance. When he came to <b>the</b> <b>precipice</b> he divided the scarlet thread into two parts, one of which he tied to the rock and the other to the goat's horns, and then pushed the goat down (Yoma vi. 1–8). The cliff was so high and rugged that before the goat had traversed half the distance to the plain below, its limbs were utterly shattered. Men were stationed at intervals along the way, {{and as soon as the}} goat was thrown down <b>the</b> <b>precipice,</b> they signaled to one another by means of kerchiefs or flags, until the information reached the high priest, whereat he proceeded with the other parts of the ritual.|$|E

25|$|After {{repelling}} the Ethiopian attack, the British force moved onto Magdala {{the following}} day. As the British approached, Tewodros released two hostages on parole to offer terms.

25|$|The Mishnah {{taught that}} they handed the {{scapegoat}} {{over to him}} who was to lead it away. All were permitted to lead it away, but the Priests made it a rule not to permit an ordinary Israelite to lead it away. Rabbi Jose said that Arsela of Sepphoris once led it away, although {{he was not a}} priest. The people went with him from booth to booth, except the last one. The escorts would not go with him up to <b>the</b> <b>precipice,</b> but watched from a distance. The one leading the scapegoat divided the thread of crimson wool, and tied one half to the rock, the other half between the scapegoat horns, and pushed the scapegoat from behind. And it went rolling down and before it had reached half its way down the hill, it was dashed to pieces. He came back and sat down under the last booth until it grew dark. His garments unclean become unclean from the moment that he has gone outside the wall of Jerusalem, although Rabbi Simeon taught that they became unclean from the moment that he pushed it over <b>the</b> <b>precipice.</b>|$|E
25|$|Erste Invasion (First Invasion). As {{the sound}} bombs {{continue}} to detonate, approaching signals of trumpets and trombones can be heard. Lucifer's troops, wearing {{black and red}} battle dress invade the hall, pursued by Michael's trumpeter troops, dressed in light blue and red. As the combatants move to and fro, the Lucifer troops succeed in removing some of the camouflage from <b>the</b> <b>precipice,</b> revealing a chrome bunker wall. The combat moves off to the right, the bass detonations cease, the music flak falls silent, and the melancholy Wednesday segment of Eve's formula in the octophonic music suffuses the space.|$|E

25|$|Pavey Ark {{can also}} be ascended from Stickle Tarn via Easy Gully, North Rake or by the path to Harrison Stickle. Easy Gully is a steep walk on scree between the crags at {{the eastern end of}} <b>the</b> <b>precipice,</b> {{starting}} from the same place as Jack's Rake, and is blocked by large boulders near the top, where tough scrambling is required. North Rake (so named by Wainwright) starts from the path to High Raise at the very eastern end of the cliff and rises west {{over the top of the}} East Buttress. This is a much less exposed and strenuous walking route to the summit.|$|E

25|$|Whymper {{and party}} stayed {{an hour on}} the summit. Then they began their descent. Croz descended first, then Hadow, Hudson and Douglas, Taugwalder senior, Whymper with Taugwalder junior coming last. They climbed down with great care, only one man moving at a time. When they were barely an hour from the summit and were all on the rope, Hadow slipped and fell on Croz, who was in front of him. Croz, who was unprepared, was unable to {{withstand}} the shock; they both fell and pulled down Hudson and Douglas. On hearing Croz's shout, Whymper and Taugwalder clasped the rocks; they stood firm but the rope broke. Whymper saw them slide down the slope, trying with convulsive hands to stop themselves, and then falling from rock to rock and finally disappearing over the edge of <b>the</b> <b>precipice.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{departure}} from Melbourne – {{just one year}} into a three-year deal with the club – {{was the end of}} a tumultuous period for Gleeson, who had been supporting his wife through a successful battle with breast cancer. Gleeson was left emotionally drained and on the lookout for his next professional challenge. For a time he found that challenge elsewhere, working with the Australian Football League's North Melbourne and Hawthorn football clubs as a skills coach during 2012–13. It was an interesting change of scenery and, in many ways, a year of growth for Gleeson. Under masterful coach Alastair Clarkson, Hawthorn was on <b>the</b> <b>precipice</b> of a golden era of premiership success and it was there that Gleeson learned some of the key elements of his current coaching philosophy. He learnt the importance of core sporting-team principles such as empowering players to lead a team's culture and standards.|$|E

500|$|Chamberlin {{was noted}} by colleagues at Utah {{for being a}} lifelong {{champion}} of the scientific method and instilling in his students ideas that natural processes must be used to explain human existence.

[...] His influence continued as his students became teachers, gradually increasing societal understanding of evolution and naturalistic perspectives. His colleague and former student Stephen Durrant stated [...] "by word, and especially by precept, he taught us diligence, inquisitiveness, love of truth, and especially scientific honesty". Durrant compared Chamberlin to noted biologists such as Spencer Fullerton Baird and C. Hart Merriam in the scope of his contributions science.|$|E

At nightfall, Jack follows a sound he heard in the jungle, leading him to stumble upon a cave containing a spring of fresh water, where he finds some debris from the plane, including his father's coffin.
