The {{character}} of the profile is indeed much altered by the accidental nature of the surface decoration; but {{the importance of the}} broad difference between the raised and flat profile will be felt on glancing at the examples 1 to 6 in Plate XII. The three upper examples are the Romanesque types, which occur as parallels with the Byzantine types, 1 to 3 of Plate XI. Their plans would be nearly the same; but instead of resembling flat leaves, they are literally spurs, or claws, as high as they are broad; and the third, from St. Michele of Pavia, appears to be intended to have its resemblance to a claw enforced by the transverse fillet. 1 is from St. Ambrogio, Milan; 2 from Vienne, France. The 4th <b>type,</b> <b>Plate</b> XII., almost like the extremity of a man's foot, is a Byzantine form (perhaps worn on the edges), from the nave of St. Mark's; and the two next show the unity of the two principles, forming the perfect Italian Gothic types,--5, from tomb of Can Signorio della Scala, Verona; 6, from San Stefano, Venice (the base 11 of Plate XI., in perspective). The two other bases, 10 and 12 of Plate XI., are conditions of the same kind, showing the varieties of rise and fall in exquisite modulation; the 10th, a type more frequent at Verona than Venice, in which the spur profile overlaps the roll, instead of rising out of it, and seems to hold it down, {{as if it were a}} ring held by sockets. This is a character found both in early and late work; a kind of band, or fillet, appears to hold, and even compress, the centre of the roll in the base of one of the crypt shafts of St. Peter's, Oxford, which has also spurs at its angles; and long bands flow over the base of the angle shaft of the Ducal Palace of Venice, next the Porta della Carta.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACTObjective: To determine, {{by means}} of {{comparative}} biomechanical tests, whether greater compressive load resistance and flexion is presented by 95 ° angled blade plates or by dynamic condylar screws (DCS), and to correlate the failure type presented during the tests with each <b>type</b> of <b>plate.</b> Methods: Sixty-five porcine femurs were subjected to 1 cm medial wedge osteotomy, in the metaphysis, to simulate an unstable supracondylar femoral fracture. Osteosynthesis was performed on these pieces: 35 were fixed using 95 ° lateral blade plates and 30 with DCS plates. Another variable studied was the failure type presented in each group, {{in an attempt to}} correlate this with the <b>type</b> of <b>plate.</b> Results: There were no statistically significant differences in biomechanical resistance between the two <b>types</b> of <b>plates,</b> or between the failure <b>type</b> and the <b>plate</b> <b>type</b> used for the osteosynthesis. Conclusion: The two <b>types</b> of <b>plate</b> behaved in a similar fashion. However, the angled blade plate proved to be superior to the DCS in the flexion test.
