5|$|Decay {{was not a}} {{critical}} success, but was received with some positivity by video game journalists. Many reviewers felt the game was fun to play <b>through</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> friend, but that its more puzzle-oriented gameplay somewhat detracted from the overall experience. A number of reviews stated that the game simply felt {{little more than an}} extra add-on for the PlayStation 2 version of Half-Life.|$|E
5|$|In September 1918, Eleanor was {{unpacking}} one of Franklin's suitcases {{when she}} discovered a bundle of love letters to him from her social secretary, Lucy Mercer. He had been contemplating leaving Eleanor for Lucy. However, following pressure from his political advisor, Louis Howe, and from his mother, who threatened to disinherit Franklin if he followed <b>through</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> divorce, the couple remained married. Their union {{from that point on}} was more of a political partnership. Disillusioned, Eleanor again became active in public life, and focused increasingly on her social work rather than her role as a wife, as she had for the previous decade.|$|E

5|$|The station depot {{remained}} on its concrete platform when the tracks were torn {{up on the}} old main line. In 1996, workers removed the plaque attached to the Minot monument, but it was soon returned. However, the plaque was stolen shortly afterward {{and has not been}} recovered. The station depot itself was left in decrepit condition, and in 2006, the village of Harriman's building inspector ordered Norfolk Southern Railroad (the successor to Conrail and who owned the right-of-way) to either restore the building or demolish it. Norfolk Southern followed <b>through</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> demolition permit and in May 2006, the station depot was demolished by a front loader. The station remains were taken to a dump in Hillburn, New York.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the 200708 season, she made her senior debut for the New South Wales Breakers in the Australian {{domestic}} one-day league. She was used as a specialist batsman in the top-order, as Leonie Coleman, a wicket-keeper in the Australian squad, also played for New South Wales. She made her debut against South Australia and was unsuccessful to begin with, scoring only 24 runs in her first five innings. After one month at senior level, she broke <b>through</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> match-winning performance in her sixth senior game. After Queensland had made 170, Healy came in with the score at 5/99 after 32 overs, with 18 overs remaining. She raised the run rate, scoring 41 not out from 50 balls, with eight fours, shepherding the tail-enders and guiding her state to a two-wicket win with 17 balls to spare.|$|E
5|$|By 20 December, {{arrangements}} for the delivery of emergency food and water supplies were made and expected to reach Carnarvon later that day. Supplies were also sent to outlying Aboriginal communities affected by the floods. After evacuating on 20 December, residents were {{allowed to return to}} their homes two days later in Carnarvon. However, most were left without power and clean water and required assistance from local agencies. Following the disaster, there were concerns that the Australian government could have prevented at least some of the floods by following <b>through</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> flood mitigation program. Dudley Maslen, the President of The Shire of Carnarvon stated that he did not want to place blame on any agency, though hoped for improvement during the future. More than 100 local government areas and regions were declared natural disaster areas on 21 December, encompassing areas from central Western Australia to the Pilbara coastline.|$|E

5|$|Elizabeth I {{gave the}} chapter and the Vicars Choral a new charter in 1591, {{creating}} a new governing body, consisting of a dean and eight residentiary canons with control over the church estates and authority over its affairs, but no longer entitled to elect the dean (that entitlement thenceforward belonged ultimately to the Crown). The stability brought by the new charter ended {{with the onset of}} the Civil War and the execution of Charles I. Local fighting damaged the cathedral's stonework, furniture and windows. The dean, Walter Raleigh, a nephew of the explorer Sir Walter Raleigh, was placed under house arrest after the fall of Bridgwater to the Parliamentarians in 1645, first in the rectory at Chedzoy and then in the deanery at Wells. His jailer, the shoe maker and city constable, David Barrett, caught him writing a letter to his wife. When he refused to surrender it, Barrett ran him <b>through</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> sword and he died six weeks later, on 10 October 1646. He was buried in an unmarked grave in the choir before the dean's stall. During the Commonwealth of England under Oliver Cromwell no dean was appointed and the cathedral fell into disrepair. The bishop went into retirement and some of the clerics were reduced to performing menial tasks.|$|E
5|$|List {{believed}} that the degradation of modern Western society was {{as a result of}} a conspiracy orchestrated by a secret organisation known as the Great International Party, an idea influenced by anti-semitic conspiracy theories. Adopting a millenarianist perspective, he believed in the imminent defeat of this enemy and the establishment of a better future for the Ario-German race. In April 1915 he welcomed the start of World War I as a conflict that would bring about the defeat of Germany's enemies and the establishment of a golden age for the new Ario-German Empire. Toward the war's end, he {{believed that}} the German war dead would be reincarnated as a generation who would push <b>through</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> national revolution and establish this new, better society. For List, this better future would be intricately connected to the ancient past, reflecting his belief in the cyclical nature of time, something which he had adopted both from a reading of Norse mythology and from Theosophy. Reflecting his monarchist beliefs, he envisioned this future state as being governed by the House of Habsburg, with a revived feudal system of land ownership being introduced through which land would be inherited by a man's eldest son. In List's opinion, this new empire would be highly hierarchical, with non-Aryans being subjugated under the Aryan population and opportunities for education and jobs in public service being restricted to those deemed racially pure. He envisioned this Empire following the Wotanic religion which he promoted.|$|E
5|$|On 9 June, Pembroke left Gaveston at {{the rectory}} at Deddington in Oxfordshire, while he himself left {{to visit his}} wife. When Warwick found out about Gaveston's whereabouts, he {{immediately}} rode out to capture him. The next morning he appeared at the rectory, where he took Gaveston captive and {{brought him back to}} his castle at Warwick. Pembroke, whose honour had been affronted, appealed for justice both to Gaveston's brother-in-law Gloucester and to the University of Oxford, but to no avail. At Warwick, Gaveston was condemned to death for violating the terms of the Ordinances, before an assembly of barons, including Warwick, Lancaster, Hereford and Arundel. On 19 June, he was taken out on the road towards Kenilworth as far as Blacklow Hill, which was on the Earl of Lancaster's land. Here, two Welshmen ran him <b>through</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> sword and beheaded him.|$|E
