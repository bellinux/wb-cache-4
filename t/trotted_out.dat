5|$|The road opener was {{the first}} game ever played in the new home stadium of the UCF Knights. McCoy's 47 passing {{attempts}} tied a Texas single-game record. His 32 completions set a new school record, besting the 30 completed by Vince Young during the 2006 Rose Bowl and by Major Applewhite during two 1999 games. The final non-conference game was against Rice, and McCoy completed 20 of his 29 passing attempts, accumulating 333 yards through the air. For {{the first time in}} the season, he did not throw an interception. McCoy and most of the Longhorn starting players were replaced by backups after the first drive of the second half. True freshman quarterback John Chiles made his first college appearance in the first quarter. He came onto the field beside McCoy and then McCoy <b>trotted</b> <b>out</b> to a slot receiver position. Chiles never looked to pass; he ran up the middle for no gain. He came out of the game after that play and came back in the third quarter as McCoy's replacement. On that drive, Chiles line up in the zone-read offense and led the Longhorns 80 yards to a touchdown, carrying the ball four times for 49 yards. Chiles' strong performance immediately led to media speculation as to how much playing time he will take from McCoy.|$|E

It may be quite interesting, but in this case, it just isn't true.|$|E
25|$|The kick {{sailed through}} the {{uprights}} and the Oklahoma sideline {{thought it was}} good; the kickoff unit <b>trotted</b> <b>out</b> and the Schooner, as was traditional, also trotted slowly onto the Orange Bowl's wet, mushy field. However, the field goal kick was nullified due to an illegal procedure penalty on Oklahoma. A Sooner player did not report his temporary jersey number to the officials, which he was required to do before the ball was snapped.|$|E

25|$|The action {{returned}} to St. Louis on October 22 for game 5. Chicago manager Cap Anson attempted {{to start the}} game with Ned Baldwin in the pitcher's area, but the St. Louis crowd roared its disapproval and the Browns refused to play until Baldwin was removed. Forced to improvise in light of Chicago's lack of an alternate pitcher to John Clarkson, Anson <b>trotted</b> <b>out</b> outfielder Jimmy Ryan to make the start, only to see the hapless conscript knocked {{out of the box}} after the first inning. Shortstop Ned Williamson came in to relieve, showing himself a better pitcher than Williamson but nevertheless taking the loss as his teammates blundered away the game defensively.|$|E
25|$|The draw in Toronto {{extended}} the team's Eastern Conference lead to 11 points, though United had played more games {{than any other}} Eastern Conference team. The team also led the Supporters Shield race by 3 points, but the team below them in the table, Vancouver Whitecaps held 2 games in hand. United closed out June with another U.S. Open Cup match, at Philadelphia. The continued fixture congestion meant coach Olsen continued with his rotation and <b>trotted</b> <b>out</b> a nearly fully second choice lineup, with only one regular, defender Steve Birnbaum. Despite the disparity in lineup strength, United struck first. Shortly after Philadelphia Union striker C.J. Sapong was shown a red card, United exploited the man advantage with Arrieta scoring on a deflected cross from rookie Miguel Aguilar. Though they were down a man, the Union soon dominated much of the ensuing play, and won the game on two second half goals, eliminating D.C. from the 2015 Open Cup competition.|$|E
500|$|The report's visionary {{goal for}} {{preservation}} {{has been both}} lauded and criticized. Author of the book Searching for Yellowstone: Ecology and Wonder in the Last Wilderness, Paul Schullery, wrote of the report: [...] "Scholars return to it for new interpretations and even inspiration regularly, speakers invoke it on all occasions, and it is <b>trotted</b> <b>out</b> to prove almost every perspective in debates about modern park management." [...] On the other hand, Alston Chase, a vocal critic of the National Park Service, disapproved of the limited scope of the Leopold Report, arguing that it had [...] "inadvertently replaced science with nostalgia, subverting the goal it had set out to support". The report's insistence to return parks to the condition that [...] "prevailed when the area was first visited by the white man" [...] has also been criticized for ignoring the Native Americans' historical presence in the area. Historian and author Philip Burnham in particular stated in his 2000 book, Indian Country, God's Country: Native Americans and the National Parks, that although Leopold et al. were more progressive than their predecessors, they [...] "still dismissed native people as passive onlookers".|$|E

500|$|According to Brook, [...] "in every age, {{a heroic}} sage struggles to rescue Benjamin from obscurityâ€”and {{invariably}} fails." [...] Benjamin left no memoir and destroyed his personal papers, by which [...] "the task of future researchers and historians was made exceedingly difficult and laborious". [...] After his death, Benjamin was rarely written about, {{in contrast to}} Davis and other Confederate leaders. [...] Part of {{this was due to}} Benjamin depriving his potential biographers of source material, but even Davis, in his two-volume war memoir, mentions him only twice. Evans suggests that as Davis wrote the books in part to defend and memorialize his place in history, {{it would not have been}} characteristic of him to give much credit to Benjamin. Davis, in the midst of postwar business struggles, may have resented Benjamin's success as a barrister, or may have feared that allegations of involvement in Lincoln's assassination would again be made against the two men. Brook concurs that Benjamin's postwar success, that began as Davis lay in prison and other Confederates struggled for survival, may have soured Southerners towards the former secretary, but that anti-Semitism was also likely a factor. [...] "For the guardians of Confederate memory after Reconstruction, Benjamin became a kind of pet Jew, generally ignored, but then <b>trotted</b> <b>out</b> at opportune moments to defend the segregated South against charges of bigotry." ...|$|E
500|$|Clarkson {{performed}} [...] "Because of You" [...] at the 48th Grammy Awards {{which took}} place on February 8, 2006, at the Staples Center in Los Angeles, California. Donning a red dress and singing from beside a grand piano, her performance in that event garnered positive reviews from critics. Elysa Gardner of USA Today lauded Clarkson's performance and ranked {{it as one of}} the three best performances, writing, [...] "The pre-performance clip of a girlish-looking Clarkson emphasized how little Kelly has matured. The girl most likely to escape the American Idol stigma was in fine, creamy voice, and kept the Mariah-esque riffing to a minimum." [...] Robert Lloyd of the Los Angeles Times considered Clarkson's performance as one of the highlights in the event and described her performance as a [...] "thin-skinned rendition [...] in which her whole being seemed involved." [...] Yahoo! Music praised Clarkson's rendition of the song, calling it [...] "perfectly fine" [...] despite the saying that it was [...] "a little reminiscent of those many mediocre, superficial ballads <b>trotted</b> <b>out</b> on 'Idol.'" [...] In 2016, the performance was listed by Billboard as one of Clarkson's ten [...] "most powerful and undeniable performances." [...] Jason Scott of Billboard commented, [...] "Here, Clarkson serves up her signature power ballad backed by lush orchestration, sending chills through the crowd shortly before picking up two statues: best pop vocal album for Breakaway and best female pop vocal performance for [...] "Since U Been Gone." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1962, Gleason resurrected his {{variety show}} with more splashiness {{and a new}} hook: a fictitious general-interest {{magazine}} called The American Scene Magazine, through which Gleason <b>trotted</b> <b>out</b> his old characters in new scenarios; including two new Honeymooners sketches. He also added another catchphrase to the American vernacular, first uttered in the 1963 film Papa's Delicate Condition: [...] "How sweet it is!" [...] The Jackie Gleason Show: The American Scene Magazine was a hit, and continued for four seasons. Each show began with Gleason delivering a monologue and commenting on the attention-getting outfits of band leader Sammy Spear. Then the [...] "magazine" [...] features would be <b>trotted</b> <b>out,</b> from Hollywood gossip (reported by comedian Barbara Heller) to news flashes (played for laughs with a stock company of second bananas, chorus girls and dwarfs). Comedian Alice Ghostley occasionally appeared as a downtrodden tenement resident, sitting on her front step and listening to boorish boyfriend Gleason for several minutes. After the boyfriend took his leave, the smitten Ghostley would exclaim, [...] "I'm the luckiest girl in the world!" [...] Veteran comics Johnny Morgan, Sid Fields, and Hank Ladd were occasionally seen opposite Gleason in comedy sketches. Helen Curtis played alongside him as a singer and actress, delighting audiences with her 'Madame Plumpadore' sketches with 'Reginald Van Gleason.' ...|$|E
2500|$|At 06:15 on 2 October 1918 a {{long column}} was {{reported}} retreating northwards.

2500|$|Screamo is a {{style of}} {{hardcore}} punk-influenced emo with screaming. Alex Henderson of AllMusic considers screamo a bridge between hardcore punk and emo. The term screamo is a portmanteau of the words [...] "scream" [...] and [...] "emo." [...] Screamo uses typical rock instrumentation, but is notable for its brief compositions, chaotic sounds, harmonized guitars, and screaming vocals. Screamo is characterized [...] "by frequent shifts in tempo and dynamics and by tension-and-release catharses." [...] Some screamo music features chaotic vocals and quiet, melodic guitar lines. Many screamo bands also incorporate ballads. According to AllMusic, screamo is [...] "generally based in the aggressive side of the overarching punk-revival scene." [...] Screamed vocals are used [...] "not consistently, but {{as a kind of}} crescendo element, a sonic weapon to be <b>trotted</b> <b>out</b> when the music and lyrics reach a particular emotional pitch." [...] Emotional singing and harsh screaming are common vocals in screamo.|$|E
2500|$|Lou Rowan was a {{policeman}} and became senior umpire after {{the retirement of}} the much respected Col Egar.

It even queried [...] "was John Snow actually grabbed by a spectator who objected to Snow flattening an Australian batsman?". regardless of [...] John Snow in his autobiography Cricket Rebel devoted a whole chapter to [...] "Bitter Rows with Umpire Rowan" [...] in which he wrote 'I have never come across another umpire so full of his own importance, so stubborn, lacking in humour, unreasonable and utterly unable'. E.W. Swanton was not convinced that the umpires were biased [...] "...the old hobby horse <b>trotted</b> <b>out</b> of the alleged incompetence of Australian umpires.
