At the time of Fujita's sentence, 345 teachers had been punished for refusing to take part in anthem related events, though Fujita is the only man to have been convicted in relation to it. On September 21, 2006, the Tokyo District Court ordered the Tokyo Metropolitan Government to pay compensation <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>teachers</b> who had been subjected to punishment under the directive of the Tokyo Board of Education.
