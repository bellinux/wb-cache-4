5|$|I {{started doing}} {{different}} charity events where I did {{a combination of}} 'Never Too Far' and 'Hero'. We made it into a medley {{and put them in}} the same key and made it work. People responded really well to it. It's been interesting for me, since the events of September11, the way people have been playing 'Hero' and really even talking <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> 'Never Too Far', 'cause that song is also about loss. I figured that it would be a nice thing to do, to put them both out for Christmas. There's also an unreleased track on the B-side, which is called 'There for Me' which kind of has the same sentiment. The proceeds from 'Never Too Far' and 'Hero' and 'There for Me' are going to go to the Heroes Fund, and it's going to benefit police officers' families, relief workers' families.|$|E
25|$|On one of {{the drives}} along the coast, Master (Yogananda) spoke <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> the value of SRF Colonies. He {{referred}} to the forming of groups within a city or a rural area {{in the manner of}} hermitage life, among members who do not desire to become renunciants, or cannot do so because of certain obligations. Such a life would enable each one to be in daily association with those who share the same spiritual goal.|$|E
500|$|In 2014 Smith {{offered her}} {{opinion on the}} sexualization of women in music. [...] "Pop music has always been about the {{mainstream}} and what appeals to the public. I don't feel it's my place to judge." [...] As at points earlier in her life and career, she declined to embrace politicized feminism: [...] "I have {{a son and a}} daughter, people always talk <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> feminism and women's rights, but I have a son too—I believe in human rights." ...|$|E

500|$|The expedition's {{other main}} accomplishments {{included}} the first ascent of Mount Erebus, {{and the discovery}} of the approximate location of the South Magnetic Pole, reached on 16 January 1909 by Edgeworth David, Douglas Mawson, and Alistair Mackay. Shackleton returned to the United Kingdom as a hero, and soon afterwards published his expedition account, Heart of the Antarctic. Emily Shackleton later recorded: [...] "The only comment he made <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> not reaching the Pole was 'a live donkey is better than a dead lion, isn't it?' and I said 'Yes darling, as far as I am concerned'".|$|E
500|$|Nani celebrates with a [...] "mortal" [...] ("Leap of death"), {{similar to}} that of Obafemi Martins and Lomana LuaLua. The celebration derives from Nani's {{background}} in capoeira, which he used to practice as a child. For a while, it was reported that United manager Sir Alex Ferguson had banned Nani's celebration due to fear for his safety. Nani denounced the reports in August 2007, stating it was [...] "not true" [...] and that [...] "Ferguson has never spoken <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> this subject and I am going to continue to celebrate goals in this way. The conversations he has had with me are normal conversations, like he has with all players".|$|E

500|$|Melua's third album, Pictures, was {{released}} in the UK on 1 October 2007 and was announced to be, at least temporarily, {{the last of her}} albums in collaboration with Mike Batt as lead writer and producer. It also features Melua's friend Molly McQueen, the former frontwoman of The Faders, as co-writer of [...] "Perfect Circle". Melua also collaborated with Andrea McEwan on the album, who wrote the lyrics for [...] "What I Miss About You" [...] and [...] "Dirty Dice". The album also featured a cover of [...] "In My Secret Life" [...] by Leonard Cohen and Sharon Robinson. Melua said of the cover, [...] " [...] completely got <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>about</b> how we all have great ideals but in reality we end up conforming, following everyone else." ...|$|E
500|$|During {{his time}} at Oxford, Clinton befriended fellow American Rhodes Scholar Frank Aller. In 1969, Aller {{received}} a draft letter that mandated deployment to the Vietnam War. Aller's 1971 suicide had an influential impact on Clinton. British writer and feminist Sara Maitland said of Clinton, [...] "I remember Bill and Frank Aller taking me to a pub in Walton Street in the summer term of 1969 and talking <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> the Vietnam War. I knew nothing about it, and when Frank began to describe the napalming of civilians I began to cry. Bill said that feeling bad wasn't good enough. That {{was the first time}} I encountered the idea that liberal sensitivities weren't enough and you had to do something about such things". He also developed an interest in rugby union, which he played at Oxford.|$|E
500|$|Friends {{encouraged}} Crittenden to run {{for president}} in the 1848 election. A Nashville newspaper declared its support for him as early as 1846. A Democratic senator from Rhode Island opined that Crittenden could win support from a sizable number of Democrats in addition to the support of his own party. George B. Kinkead desired to have the Kentucky General Assembly nominate Crittenden for president in 1847. None of these overtures swayed Crittenden. [...] "For Heaven's sake don't talk <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> the Presidency," [...] he said, rebuffing one early offer. Clay hoped Crittenden would again support him, but Crittenden concluded that Clay was no longer a viable candidate and threw his support behind Kentuckian Zachary Taylor. This decision caused a rift between the two friends, and they were not reconciled until years later when Clay lay on his deathbed.|$|E

500|$|Shahid Kapoor {{was born}} in New Delhi on 25 February 1981 to actor Pankaj Kapur and actor-dancer Neelima Azeem. His parents {{divorced}} when he was three years old; his father shifted to Mumbai (and married the actress Supriya Pathak) and Kapoor continued living in Delhi {{with his mother and}} maternal grandparents. His grandparents were journalists for the Russian magazine Sputnik, and Kapoor was particularly fond of his grandfather: [...] "He would walk me to school every single day. He would talk <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> dad, with whom he shared a great relationship, and read out his letters to me." [...] His father, who was then a struggling actor in Mumbai, would visit Kapoor only once a year on his birthday. When Kapoor was 10, his mother, who was working as a dancer, moved to Mumbai to work as an actress.|$|E

500|$|Early {{versions}} {{opened with}} the line [...] "Don't talk <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> {{the rights of the}} IRA, UDA." [...] U2's bassist, Adam Clayton, recalls that better judgment led to the removal of such a politically charged line, and that the song's [...] "viewpoint became very humane and non-sectarian...which, is the only responsible position." [...] The chosen opening line, [...] "I can't believe the news today" [...] crystallises the prevailing response, especially among young people, to the violence in Northern Ireland during the 1970s and 1980s. In successive stanzas, the lyrics paraphrase religious text from Matthew [...] ("mother's children; brothers, sisters torn apart") and bring a twist to 1 Corinthians [...] ("we eat and drink while tomorrow they die", instead of [...] "let us eat and drink; for tomorrow we die"). [...] The song finishes with a call for the Irish to stop fighting each other, and [...] "claim the victory Jesus won...on [...] Sunday bloody Sunday." ...|$|E

500|$|On 14 April 1899, Chief Chintanda gave a BSAC {{commissioner}} at Mazoe, Southern Rhodesia {{a statement}} in which, among other things, he asserted that Clark had been claiming to be a Company official and had been collecting tariffs such as hut tax under that pretence {{for at least two}} years. Clark's labour and mining concessions, Chintanda said, had been agreed under the impression that he represented the BSAC. Chintanda furthermore claimed that Clark was a prolific womaniser who had once raped a pregnant woman. [...] "Whenever Clark sees a girl he fancies he takes her as his mistress for a few days, and when tired of her sends her home," [...] Chintanda said. [...] "The fathers and husbands of these girls are constantly complaining <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> Clark's actions, but I can do nothing as Clark is a white man, and professed to be representing the government." [...] The chief asked the Company to send a genuine representative.|$|E
500|$|In 2012, Hawke {{entered the}} horror genre {{for the first}} time, by playing a true crime writer in Scott Derrickson's Sinister, which grossed US$87million at the {{worldwide}} box office—the film {{was the first in}} a series of highly profitable films for Hawke after the start of the new decade. In the week prior to the US opening of Sinister, Hawke explained that he was previously turned off by horror because good acting is not always required for success; however, the producer of Sinister, Jason Blum, who formerly ran a theater company with Hawke, made the offer to the actor based on the character and director."when I was younger, I ran a theater company with this guy, Jason Blum. And he loved horror movies and he went on to create his own little subgenre with [...] "Paranormal Activity." [...] And he kept trying to talk <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> how I should love this whole genre. And I told him: I've never had a script with a really great character and a real filmmaker attached to it that I'd be interested in. So, he brought me into it.|$|E
500|$|After publication, Juster sent {{a copy of}} {{the book}} to the Ford Foundation, with an {{explanation}} of how the projected book on cities had transformed into The Phantom Tollbooth. He never heard back from them, and learned years later that they were delighted by the turn of events. With the book having become an unexpected hit, Juster found himself answering letters from young readers, and a few parents. He found that children understood the wordplay at different ages, and heard from the occasional college student as well. Some students wrote a second time after a gap of years [...] "and they'll talk <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> a whole different book, normally. But now they've got a lot more of the words right. A lot more of the fun kind of crazy references". He learned too that readers were capable of more than he had intended, {{as in the case of}} the letter sent by the Mathemagician to King Azaz. Composed entirely of numbers, some readers assumed it was a code and set about breaking it, only to appeal to Juster for help when they were not successful. The numbers were not intended to have any meaning, and were meant to convey that the Mathemagician's letter could not have been understood by Azaz or his advisers.|$|E

500|$|Morrissey {{deliberately}} used archaic language when composing the voice-over style lyrics for [...] "This Charming Man". His use of {{phrases and}} {{words such as}} 'hillside desolate', 'stitch to wear', 'handsome' and 'charming' are used to convey a more courtly world than the mid-Eighties north of England, and evoke a style that has, {{in the words of}} the music critic Mat Snow [...] "nothing to do with fashion". Morrissey had already used the word 'handsome' in a song title—in [...] "Handsome Devil", the B-side to [...] "Hand in Glove"—and observed in a 1983 interview with Barney Hoskyns that he used the word to [...] "try and revive some involvement with language people no longer use. In the daily scheme of things, people's language is so frighteningly limited, and if you use a word with more than 10 letters it's absolute snobbery." [...] Snow puts forward the case that through the use of the dated word 'charming', Morrissey sought to rebel against the then mainstream gay culture from which he felt alienated. Morrissey told Hoskyns: [...] "I hate this 'festive faggot' thing ... People listen to [...] "This Charming Man" [...] and think no further than what anyone would presume. I hate that angle, and it's surprising that the gay press have harped on more than anyone else. I hate it when people talk <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> sex in a trivial way." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Witch Doctor" [...] {{is based}} on a true story where Tinie met a girl at a show who he took with him on the tour bus and showed what it's like to live his life. [...] "It's OK" [...] and [...] "Lover Not a Fighter" [...] are two songs that feature vocals and {{production}} from Labrinth. [...] "It's OK" [...] is a contrast from the [...] "intro and fun, random bouncy things" [...] according to Okogwu. He added [...] "it's very unorthodox in the sense that people wouldn't have heard or even expect us to make a song like this because it's very slow and ballad-y. It's very reminiscent to me of the Fugees or something because it just sounds different and very soulful as well." [...] He wrote the song in Jamaica and wanted it to feel rustic and urban. Tinie wanted to [...] "push the envelope" [...] with what you're used to hearing from him and Labrinth. [...] "Lover Not a Fighter" [...] is a feel-good, radio-friendly song that incorporates hip hop and electronic music, along with rap rock, and is about good vibes and [...] "doing your thing". [...] "I'm a lover, not a fighter. I've just come to do my thing and enjoy myself so don't try and get on <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> it or try and make me feel bad about everything that's going on in my life", said Tinie to SB.TV.|$|E
500|$|The Nazis firmly {{fought the}} austrofascist regime of {{chancellor}} Engelbert Dollfuss, and orchestrated his assassination. They continued this battle against his successor, Kurt Schuschnigg. Austrofacism was strongly supported by Benito Mussolini, leader of Fascist Italy. Mussolini's {{support for an}} independent Austria {{can be seen in}} a discussion he had with Prince Ernst Rüdiger Starhemberg, an important Austrian nationalist and Heimwehr leader. He said that [...] "an Anschluss with Germany must never be permitted... Austria is necessary to the maintenance of Europe... the day that Austria falls and is swallowed up by Germany will mark the beginning of European chaos." [...] The austrofascist party, Fatherland Front, would echo the sentiments of Mussolini, and continue to struggle for an independent Austria. Nazis in both Germany and Austria intended that the German Reich would quickly annex Austria, the homeland of its leader, Adolf Hitler. They attempted to bribe many low-ranking Heimwehr leaders, and also attempted to bring Starhemberg into their fold, in effect merging the Heimwehr with the Nazi Freikorps. Gregor Strasser, a prominent Nazi figure, was charged with this effort. When Starhemberg, a fervent believer in an independent Austria, rejected his merger proposal, Strasser said [...] "Don't talk <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> Austria. There is no Austria... there was once a living corpse which called itself Austria... that this Austria collapsed in 1918 was a blessing... particularly for the German people, who were thereby given the chance to create a Greater Germany." ...|$|E
