Analysis of Data from the Swedish OMXS 30 index futures market shows clear evidence of futures price asymmetry, where <b>the</b> <b>futures</b> price in general tends {{to be closer to}} the bid than to the ask quote.

30|$|From {{the point}} of view of <b>the</b> <b>Futures</b> Map frame, <b>the</b> {{criteria}} of <b>the</b> preferred <b>futures</b> suggested by Amara [2] are useful when the customers of <b>the</b> <b>Futures</b> Map use <b>the</b> map. But like the geographic map, <b>the</b> <b>Futures</b> Map approach separates <b>the</b> <b>Futures</b> Map and its use. <b>The</b> <b>Futures</b> Map does not make any recommendations to its customers. It just shows what kinds of situations of choice they would meet if they would follow any scenario path of <b>the</b> <b>Futures</b> Map. It takes the preferences of its customers into account just in the selection of those scenario paths that it includes to <b>the</b> <b>Futures</b> Map. Surely, <b>the</b> preferences of the mapper and the customers of <b>the</b> <b>Futures</b> Map define these choices. The preferences of the customers are especially important if the focus of <b>the</b> <b>Futures</b> Map is on the external validity criteria 2, 4 or 6. If it has no specified customers (criterion 5) or if the target is to describe various possible (criterion 1) or weak signals based scenarios (criterion 3), the values and preferences of any particular user are not so important.|$|R

5|$|After {{exploring}} Daybreak Town and defeating several Heartless, {{the player}} is approached by the Foreteller, who tells them that defeating weaker Heartless {{is possible to}} do alone, but they will need others help to defeat more powerful opponents. The Foreteller also describes how many others are collecting light as well, though some may secretly be doing so to gain power instead of fighting the darkness, and the player must decide who to trust. Chirithy then encourages the player to explore other worlds and help rid them of the Heartless {{before it is too}} late. The player then visits the illusion future visions of Disney worlds, where they interact with the locals and help defeat the hordes of Heartless. The player is brought to each world under Chirithy's direction, and together the two search for the origin of the darkness. As the player succeeds in defeating the forces of evil, Chirithy begins to reveal the full extent of his knowledge regarding the war between light and darkness. Chirithy remembers being born in a place of light, with his creator smiling upon him in the beginning. The creator would later vanish, but before doing so he renamed six of his followers and gave five of them a prophecy of <b>the</b> <b>future.</b> The five, later known as the Foretellers, were shocked to discover that <b>the</b> <b>future</b> ended with a great battle in which the light would be defeated and the eternal reign of darkness would begin. To save <b>the</b> <b>future,</b> the Foretellers began to use the hidden powers within the written copy of the prophecy known as the Book of Prophecies (which creates <b>the</b> <b>future</b> worlds that the players travel to). Through this book, the Foretellers projected <b>the</b> <b>future</b> into their era to grow more powerful and save the light from final defeat. The power retrieved from <b>the</b> <b>future</b> is manifested as the Cards the player gathers to grow stronger.|$|E

30|$|Three {{foresight}} {{methods were}} used in <b>the</b> <b>futures</b> clinique: futures wheel, futures image, and futures table. This article {{presents the results of}} <b>the</b> <b>futures</b> wheel session, which was the main method in probing <b>the</b> <b>futures</b> of work in <b>the</b> groups’ scenarios. <b>Futures</b> wheel is a mind map like tool developed by Jerome C. Glenn of the Millennium Project (for more information on the method see Glenn (2009) [17]). <b>The</b> <b>futures</b> wheel was chosen as the main method for this futures clinique, because it enables coming up with new ideas on the theme in a cooperative and flexible manner. <b>The</b> <b>futures</b> image and <b>the</b> <b>futures</b> table were chosen to encapsulate and elaborate the core idea from <b>the</b> <b>futures</b> wheel. <b>The</b> <b>futures</b> wheel consists of two consecutive circles. The use of the circles can be modified according to the needs in each case. Ideas are written on post it pads, which are then placed on the circles of the wheel. In this <b>futures</b> workshops <b>the</b> group work began from the centre of the wheel, where each group member wrote their personal ideas on ideal work in the group’s scenario and presented them to others. This outlined preferred futures of work. Next, the groups discussed what work could be like in <b>the</b> given scenario’s <b>future,</b> in both positive and negative aspects. The ideas were placed on the inner circle of the wheel. This depicted possible futures of work. After finishing the inner circle, the group discussed and came up with possible consequences of the work they had anticipated in previous phases, for instance as concrete products, organisation models, companies etc. These ideas were compiled on the outer circle of <b>the</b> <b>futures</b> wheel.|$|R
