However, the normal thymic uptake of radioiodine has occasionally been observed in young patients. We evaluated the expression of thyroid-related genes and proteins in the human thymus. <b>Thymic</b> <b>tissues</b> were obtained from 22 patients with thyroid cancer patients of all ages. The expression of NIS, thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR), thyroperoxidase (TPO), and thyroglobulin (Tg) was investigated using immunohistochemistry and quantitative RT-PCR. NIS and TSHR were expressed in 18 (81. 8 %) and 19 samples (86. 4 %), respectively, whereas TPO was expressed in five samples (22. 7 %). Three thyroid-related proteins were localized to Hassall’s corpuscles and thymocytes. In contrast, Tg was detected in a single patient (4. 5 %) localized to vascular endothelial cells. The expression of thyroid-related proteins was not increased in young <b>thymic</b> <b>tissues</b> compared to that in old <b>thymic</b> <b>tissues.</b> In conclusion, the expression of NIS and TSHR was detected {{in the majority of}} normal thymus samples, whereas that of TPO was detected less frequently, and that of Tg was detected rarely.

A deep biological characterization of the processes at {{the basis of the}} transformed phenotype could strongly improve our understanding of the morphological and clinical heterogeneity of these diseases. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are non-coding RNAs involved in post-transcriptional regulation and their altered expression accounts for the pathogenesis of several tumors. Objectives: The aim {{of this study was to}} identify the miRNAs that are differentially expressed in tumor vs normal <b>thymic</b> <b>tissues</b> or among the different tumor histotypes and that could impact on the biology of TET. Materials and methods: microRNAs expression profiling was performed by microarray analysis of formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) <b>tissue</b> from 54 <b>thymic</b> tumor samples and 12 normal counterparts, derived from two patient cohorts. Results and conclusion: We identified groups of miRNAs differentially expressed between: (i) TET and normal <b>thymic</b> <b>tissues,</b> (ii) thymomas and thymic carcinomas, (iii) histotype groups.

40|$|The thymus is {{essential}} for T-cell development and is histologically divided into two specialized microenvironments: cortex and medulla. The cortex selects functional T cells and the medulla removes potentially auto-reactive T cells. Both selection events are mainly driven by thymic epithelial cells (TECs). However, ageing causes a loss of TECs, consequently resulting in a reduction of thymic function. Several studies have sought to reconstitute thymus function by regenerating TECs, with limited success. We aim to generate <b>thymic</b> <b>tissues</b> from defined sources that may ultimately be transplanted to improve immune function. Moreover, this study seeks to identify TEC progenitors and define distinct TEC developmental pathways, which will ultimately be helpful in understanding both thymic atrophy and thymic regeneration. We show that induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells can generate functional TECs in vivo. Moreover, our data suggest a serial link between cTEC and mTEC lineage development. Specifically, we find that Aire+ mTEC can develop from progenitors expressing the cTEC marker CD 205, and CD 205 + progenitors acquire the expression of mTEC regulator Receptor Activator of NF-κB (RANK) before losing their cTEC phenotype. Collectively, our data help clarify potential cellular targets for the re-establishment of functional thymus tissue...|$|R
40|$|It {{is unknown}} how the {{contrasting}} events {{of positive and}} negative selection can lead to the distinct biological outcomes of life or death. An increasing body of evidence suggests that the duration of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling plays a role in thymocyte selection. However, it remains unclear what the kinetics of ERK activation are during positive selection in vivo. In this study, we examined the magnitude and duration of ERK signaling in intact murine <b>thymic</b> <b>tissues</b> cultured under conditions of negative or positive selection. We found that negative selection induced a rapid and robust ERK activation that is associated with death, whereas positive selection stimulated a lower intensity and brief ERK activation that quickly declined and then gradually increased and was sustained over several days. The expression pattern of Egr- 1 (early growth response- 1), a downstream ERK effector, correlates with the biphasic kinetics of ERK during positive selection. Id 3 (inhibitor of differentiation/DNA binding 3) also exhibits biphasic kinetics but appeared to be independent of ERK signaling. Furthermore, inhibitors of T cell receptor ligation and ERK activation block maturation of CD 8 single-positive thymocytes even when added after 24 h. These results demonstrate that the in vivo duration of ERK signaling must be sustained to support positive selection...|$|R

Descriptions not previously recorded include the gross anatomy of the thymus in monotremes, the bandicoot (Isoodon macrourus, Isoodon obesulus), the wombat (Lasiorhinus latifrons), and koala (Phascolarctos cinereus), as well as light and electron microscopic features in all species examined. In monotremes, <b>thymic</b> <b>tissue</b> was diffusely spread in the mediastinum and extended over the ventral surface of the pericardium.

In many animals, <b>thymic</b> <b>tissue</b> of deep cervical origin as well as thoracic thymus was mingled with parathyroid tissue.

40|$|It is {{difficult}} to understand the in vivo permeability of thymic blood vessels, but “in vivo cryotechnique ” (IVCT) is useful to capture dynamic blood flow conditions. We injected various concentrations of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) with or without quantum dots into anesthetized mice via left ventricles to examine architectures of thymic blood vessels and their permeability at different time intervals. At 30 sec after HRP (100 mg/ml) injection, enzyme reaction products were weakly detected in interstitium around some thick blood vessels of corticomedullary boundary areas, but within capillaries of cortical areas. At 1 and 3 min, they were more widely detected in interstitium around all thick blood vessels of the boundary areas. At 10 min, they were diffusely detected throughout interstitium of cortical areas, and more densely seen in medullary areas. At 15 min, however, they were uniformly detected throughout interstitium outside blood vessels. At 30 min, phagocytosis of HRP by macrophages was scattered throughout the interstitium, which was accompanied by decrease of HRP reaction intensity in interstitial matrices.
