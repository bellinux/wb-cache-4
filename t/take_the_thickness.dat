In order to improve the capacity of energy absorption, topology of core structure,. e. g. foam, folded plate, square and hexagonal honeycombs, and pyramidal truss is studied. However, very few investigations {{have been carried out}} to study the dynamic mechanical response and energy absorption of sandwich plate with asymmetric face sheet. In this paper, the dynamic mechanical response of sandwich plate with asymmetric face sheet is numerically analyzed using LS-DYNA code. For the sandwich plate with asymmetric face sheet, the thickness of core, the thickness of wall, the cell size and the mass of sandwich plate are fixed in analysis. We <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>thickness</b> ratio δ of the upper face sheet to the lower face sheet to be 2 / 5, 3 / 4, 1, 4 / 3 and 5 / 2, respectively. The maximum deflection and energy absorption of the sandwich plate subjected to blast loading are investigated for different δ. And the performance of the sandwich plate is compared to that of the solid plate with the same mass and the same material. The efficiency of energy absorption and the performance of resistance to blast are also obtained for the five structures under the same mass of TNT charge. The effect of δ on the dynamic response of square honeycomb is discussed. The results can be used for optimizing design of sandwich plate with enough resistance to blast...|$|E

A sound wave is emitted through the material using a piezoelectric transducer. This waveform travels through the host medium at a constant speed and is either partially or fully reflected at an interface.

40|$|AbstractAccording to the metallogenic theory by transmagmatic fluid (TMF), one magmatic {{intrusion}} is a channel of ore-bearing fluids, but not their source. Therefore, {{it is possible}} to use TMF’s ability for injection into and for escaping from the {{magmatic intrusion}} to evaluate its ore-forming potential. As the ore-bearing fluids cannot effectively inject into the magmatic intrusion when the magma fully crystallized, the cooling time and rates viscosity varied can be used to estimate <b>the</b> minimum critical <b>thickness</b> of <b>the</b> intrusion. One dimensional heat transfer model is used to determine the cooling time for three representative dikes of different composition (granite porphyry, quartz diorite and diabase) in the Shihu gold deposit. It also estimated the rates viscosity varied in these time interval. We <b>took</b> <b>the</b> <b>thickness</b> of dike at the intersection of the cooling time – <b>thickness</b> curve and <b>the</b> rates viscosity varied versus <b>thickness</b> curve as <b>the</b> minimum critical <b>thickness.</b> For <b>the</b> ore-bearing fluids effectively injecting into the magma, <b>the</b> minimum critical <b>thicknesses</b> for <b>the</b> three representative dikes are 33. 45  m for granite porphyry, 8. 22  m for quartz diorite and 1. 02  m for diabase, indicating that ore-bearing dikes must be thicker than each value. These results are consistent with the occurrence of ore bodies, and thus they could be applied in practice. Based on the statistical relationship between the length and the width of dikes, these critical thicknesses are used to compute critical areas: 0. 0003 – 0. 0016  km 2 for diabase, 0. 014 – 0. 068  km 2 for quartz diorite and 0. 011 – 0. 034  km 2 for granite porphyry. This implies that ore-bearing minor intrusions have varied areas corresponding to their composition.

40|$|Abstract: Currently, {{straight}} cutting-edge carpenter shapers {{are widely}} used in the production process. The manner of contact between this traditional type of shaper and the workpiece is a piecewise continuous curve. One drawback of shapers of this type is that the noise generated during the cutting process tends to be very loud. In order to overcome this problem, <b>the</b> current paper <b>takes</b> <b>the</b> <b>thickness</b> of <b>the</b> cutter into account and employs the concept of equidistant lines and surfaces {{to develop a new}} carpenter shaper that comprises a helical cutting edge on a cylindrical shank surface. The geometric shape of the blade surface that is mounted in the groove of the cutter shank is ®rst derived. The contact curve of the proposed carpenter shaper with the workpiece is shown to be continuous. In order to establish a geometric model that facilitates the simple production of a carpenter helical shaping cutter, this paper presents a new design approach, which constructs an equidistant and equivalent involute helical surface model and a corresponding planar unwinding torus model. The carpenter shaper thus obtained is proven to be successful in reducing the noise levels of the cutting process. The contact style of the shaper also oVers the additional advantages of higher cutting e¤ciency, lower energy consumption and longer tool-life. A numerical example is presented to illustrate the eVectiveness of the proposed modelling approach. The results indicate that the proposed carpenter helical shaping (CHS) cutter model is accurate, e¤cient and comprehensive.
