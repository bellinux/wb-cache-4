5|$|Sebaceous glands {{are also}} found in hairless areas (glabrous skin) of the eyelids, nose, penis, labia minora, the inner mucosal {{membrane}} of <b>the</b> <b>cheek,</b> and nipples. Some sebaceous glands have unique names. Sebaceous glands on the lip and mucosa of <b>the</b> <b>cheek,</b> and on the genitalia, are known as Fordyce spots, and glands on the eyelids are known as meibomian glands. Sebaceous glands of the breast are also known as Montgomery's glands.|$|E
5|$|Adult {{males have}} large cheek flaps {{to show their}} {{dominance}} to other males. <b>The</b> <b>cheek</b> flaps are made mostly of fatty tissue and are supported by the musculature of the face. Mature males' throat pouches allow them to make loud calls.|$|E
5|$|Campbell's dwarf hamster has cheek pouches, {{which are}} an {{extension}} of the mouth, extending from the mouth {{all the way to the}} rear legs. Food is transferred into these pouches through the diastema. The inside of the pouch contains a large number of folds of dermal papillae. When the pouch is full, it extends and becomes part of the structure of the skin. By 11 days of age, <b>the</b> <b>cheek</b> pouches are fully grown and can carry objects up to the size of a sunflower seed. When <b>the</b> <b>cheek</b> pouches become full, they extend back to the shoulder blades, which restrict movement.|$|E
5000|$|Full-spoon: {{similar to}} the full-cheek, except <b>the</b> <b>cheeks</b> are flat and spoon-like instead of round and cylindrical. <b>The</b> <b>cheeks</b> are {{generally}} shorter than those found on a full-cheek.|$|R

5|$|Marine mammals {{have evolved}} {{a wide variety}} of {{features}} for feeding, which are mainly seen in their dentition. For example, <b>the</b> <b>cheek</b> teeth of pinnipeds and odontocetes are specifically adapted to capture fish and squid. In contrast, baleen whales have evolved baleen plates to filter feed plankton and small fish from the water.|$|E

Veronica Taylor, who provided the English voice of Ash in this episode, said she enjoyed the script and recording Ash's lines.|$|E
5|$|Zygoma implant; a long implant {{that can}} anchor to <b>the</b> <b>cheek</b> bone by {{passing through the}} maxillary sinus to retain a {{complete}} upper denture when bone is absent. While zygomatic implants offer a novel approach to severe bone loss in the upper jaw, {{it has not been}} shown to offer any advantage over bone grafting functionally although it may offer a less invasive option, {{depending on the size of}} the reconstruction required.|$|E
5|$|According to Ehrman, Jesus {{taught that}} a coming kingdom was everyone's proper focus, not {{anything}} in this life. He taught about the Jewish Law, seeking its true meaning, sometimes in opposition to other traditions. Jesus put love {{at the center of}} the Law, and following that Law was an apocalyptic necessity. His ethical teachings called for forgiveness, not judging others, loving enemies, and caring for the poor. Funk and Hoover note that typical of Jesus were paradoxical or surprising turns of phrase, such as advising one, when struck on <b>the</b> <b>cheek,</b> to offer the other cheek to be struck as well (Luke 6:29).|$|E
50|$|The {{temporary}} vasocongestion of <b>the</b> <b>cheeks</b> of <b>the</b> face {{is called}} blushing. It {{may be caused}} by the emotions of anger or embarrassment. The illness of rosacea is a chronic vasocongestion condition of the face that primarily affects <b>the</b> <b>cheeks</b> and nose, but may include other areas such as the eyes and chin.|$|R

5|$|Helmets made {{entirely of}} bronze were also used, {{while some of}} them had large cheek guards, {{probably}} stitched or riveted to the helmet, as well as an upper pierced knot to hold a crest. Small holes all around <b>the</b> <b>cheek</b> guards and the helmet's lower edge were used for the attachment of internal padding. Other types of bronze helmets were also used. During the late Mycenaean period, additional types were also used such as horned helmets made of strips of leather.|$|E
5|$|Midazolam, marketed {{under the}} trade name Versed, among others, is a {{medication}} used for anesthesia, procedural sedation, trouble sleeping, and severe agitation. It works by inducing sleepiness, decreasing anxiety, and causing {{a loss of}} ability to create new memories. It is also useful {{for the treatment of}} seizures. Midazolam can be given by mouth, intravenously, by injection into a muscle, sprayed into the nose, or in <b>the</b> <b>cheek.</b> When given intravenously, it typically begins working within five minutes; when injected into a muscle, it can take fifteen minutes to begin working. Effects last for between one and six hours.|$|E
5|$|Temnospondyls {{and other}} early {{tetrapods}} have rounded otic notches {{in the back}} of the skull that project into <b>the</b> <b>cheek</b> region. In life, the otic notch would have been covered by a membrane called the tympanum, which is seen as a disk-like area in living frogs. The tympanum is involved in hearing, and is similar to the ear drum of more advanced tetrapods. It was traditionally thought that the tympanum developed very early in tetrapod evolution as a hearing organ and progressed to form the ear drum of amniotes. Thus, temnospondyls possessed a hearing system supposedly ancestral to that of living amphibians and reptiles.|$|E

5|$|The artwork for 808s & Heartbreak {{followed}} the minimalist {{style of the}} album. The cover art features a deflated heart-shaped baloon. It was photographed by Kristen Yiengst and designed by Virgil Abloh and Willo Perron, and the deluxe edition's artwork was made by pop artist Kaws. The album's artwork also include photographs of West, taken by Willy Vanderperre, and a photograph of West kissing his mother on <b>the</b> <b>cheek,</b> taken by Danny Clinch. In 2013, Complex named it the best rap album cover {{of the past five}} years.|$|E
5|$|Despite Bowser's demise in {{the first}} level, this does not stop Bowser Jr. from running through the {{remaining}} worlds with Peach in tow, forcing Mario to chase after him before reaching Bowser's castle in world 8. There, Bowser Jr. revives his father's skeleton, creating Dry Bowser, but Mario once again defeats Bowser by dropping him into a deep pit. In the final battle, Bowser Jr. flees once more across a lava chasm to a larger castle, where he throws his father's bones into a cauldron and revives Bowser in his original form. They attack Mario in tandem, but Mario drops the pair into the pit below. In the game's final sequence, Mario rescues Peach, who kisses him on <b>the</b> <b>cheek.</b> Over the end credits, Bowser Jr. is seen dragging his unconscious father across the floor. He looks at the screen, and growls, breaking the fourth wall.|$|E
5|$|Finn and Jake then {{attempt to}} find new homes. Initially {{they are unable to}} find a {{suitable}} home until they stumble upon a cave. They clean up the cave and hold a house-warming party, which Marceline crashes. She explains that the cave also belongs to her. Finn, having had enough starts a fight with Marceline, who grows into a huge demonic bat. After she seemingly kills Jake, Finn goes into a rage and violently punches Marceline, who promptly shape-shifts into her regular form and then kisses Finn on <b>the</b> <b>cheek,</b> making him blush. Jake‚Äîwho was able to use his shape-shifting powers to save himself‚Äîruns over to Finn, and Marceline states that the fight they had was fun and {{that the two of them}} can have their old house back, as a gift. Once Finn and Jake return to their old abode, they are promptly hypnotized by King Worm (voiced by Erik Estrada).|$|E

25|$|In most South European countries, kissing is {{initiated}} by leaning {{to the left}} side and joining <b>the</b> right <b>cheeks</b> and if there's a second kiss, changing to <b>the</b> left <b>cheeks.</b> In some cases (e.g. some parts of Italy) the process is the opposite, you first lean to the right, join <b>the</b> left <b>cheeks</b> and then switch to <b>the</b> right <b>cheeks.</b>|$|R
5|$|Later on the bridge, Data is {{reviewing}} {{the information from}} the probes sent into the nebula. He theorises that life might have evolved differently in the nebula because of the volume of dark matter detected. Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) orders the ship to the nearest planet within the nebula. Data and D'Sora configure further probes, when she kisses him on <b>the</b> <b>cheek</b> and then on the lips, before leaving the room. Data seeks the opinion of his friends, including Picard, Guinan (Whoopi Goldberg), Geordi La Forge (LeVar Burton), Commander William Riker (Jonathan Frakes), Deanna Troi (Marina Sirtis) and Worf (Michael Dorn). Data decides to pursue the relationship and goes to D'Sora's cabin with a bunch of flowers, where he informs her that he created a romantic subroutine for the relationship.|$|E
5|$|Like the {{characteristic}} tusks, <b>the</b> <b>cheek</b> teeth of derived heterodontosaurids were also unique among early ornithischians. Small ridges, or denticles, lined {{the edges of}} ornithischian cheek teeth in order to crop vegetation. These denticles extend {{only a third of}} the way down the tooth crown from the tip in all heterodontosaurids; in other ornithischians, the denticles extend further down towards the root. Basal forms like Abrictosaurus had cheek teeth in both maxilla and dentary that were generally similar to other ornithischians: widely spaced, each having a low crown and a strongly-developed ridge (cingulum) separating the crown from the root. In more derived forms like Lycorhinus and Heterodontosaurus, the teeth were chisel-shaped, with much higher crowns and no cingula, so that there was no difference in width between the crowns and the roots.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Sub-Commander T'Pol ‚Äì who {{has been}} invited to accept a Starfleet {{commission}} ‚Äì takes the opportunity to travel to Vulcan to visit her mother, T'Les. When Commander Tucker mentions {{that he does not}} have a home to go to, T'Pol invites him along. On Vulcan, after a tense homecoming, she learns that her mother has resigned from the Vulcan Science Academy as indirect punishment for T'Pol's actions at the P'Jem sanctuary. One logical way for T'Pol to restore her mother's position is to honor her engagement to Koss, a member of an influential family. Despite Tucker's feelings, who admits to T'Les' observation that he is in love with T'Pol, she consents to marry Koss. Just before the ceremony begins, however, T'Pol quickly kisses Tucker on <b>the</b> <b>cheek.</b>|$|E
