They closed their set accompanied by six stilted clowns.|$|E

The incident was condemned by all the opposition parties. The functioning of the Indian Parliament was log-jammed in December. News reports indicated that Muslim right wing groups in India have received a `lease of life' in <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>protest</b> the conversions.

He was brought out in the spring of 1593 to, before the assembled church dignitaries of the place, make a recantation. This recantation has been preserved by the Jesuit Delrio in Delrio's work in which he published in 1599-1600 in support of the persecution, in which Delrio describes the scene: ...|$|E
40|$|Partizipation und partizipative Methoden werden in den letzten Jahrzehnten vermehrt eingesetzt um Meinungen und Verständnis von Betroffenen zu bestimmten Projekten zu evaluieren, diese mitzubestimmen zu lassen und im Endeffekt so eine höhere Nachhaltigkeit zu erreichen. Denn große Projekte werden vermutlich mehr Verständnis der Betroffenen erzielen, wenn diese mitreden können und somit wird es möglicherweise weniger Proteste und andere Aktionen gegen das Projekt geben. Projekte, die von staatlichen Organisationen errichtet werden sollen und daher von öffentlichem Interesse sind, haben einen anderen Charakter als Planungen privater Interessenten/innen. Wie können öffentliche Interessen gewahrt werden aber auch gleichzeitig private Betroffene an Planungen teilnehmen und mitbestimmen? Und welche Verfahren sind in einem konkreten Projekt ausgeschöpft worden und welche weiteren wären außerdem möglich gewesen? Diesen Fragen soll unter anderem diese Arbeit nachgehen. Participation and {{participative}} {{approaches have}} been of special interest during the last decades in order to Evaluate opinions and the comprehension of people concerned by specific projects; The people concerned may {{take part in the}} decision-making process to achieve higher sustainability this way. It can be assumed that big projects lead to more comprehension by the people concerned if they have a say and participate in the planning process - thus, not <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>protest</b> or to start any other activities as extensively. Projects by state organizations are of public interest. They have other qualities than projects by private organizations. How is it possible to preserve public interests {{on the one hand and}} to provide possibilities for participation on the other hand? Which procedures have been fully made use of within a concrete project? Which other procedures would have been possible? This paper tries to find answers to these questions...|$|E
40|$|Even though {{globalization}} {{is a process}} that covers the entire globe, it is questionablewhether Latin America is in reality going through such a process. If one measures the quality of globalization in terms of the movement of people, merchandise (trade) and capital, some countries within this region such as Argentina are obviously less globalized in the 20 th century than in the 19 th century. But, if {{globalization is}} defined as a movement in the Periphery that follows the main currents prevailing in the Center, the majority of the countries in the region, including Argentina are apparently in the process of globalization. For, such currents as neoliberalism democratization and regionalism which can be seen as examples of predominant tendencies in the Center, are permeating Latin America too. But these tendencies are not harmonious and in some countries they are even conflicting. This paper tries to analyze relations among the three, taking Argentina as an example. The main {{reason for this is that}} Argentina is the country that assimilated these three traits and in particular carried out the neoliberal reforms more thoroughly than any other Latin American countries. But, these kind of neoliberal reforms have been producing high rates of unemployment, labor opposition and several social upheavals. In order to cope with this opposition, the Government sometimes applies policies that tend to threaten democratic institutions, through such measures as sending troops to suppress upheavals and through bypassing the Congress. Yet, at the same time, the labor movement is <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>protest</b> against these neoliberal policies by consolidating regional solidarity among the Mercosur countries, which in turn makes the relations among the three tendencies increasingly complicated...|$|E
