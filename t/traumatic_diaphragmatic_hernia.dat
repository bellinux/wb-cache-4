MethodsBetween January 1999 and December 2002, four male and two female patients presented {{to us with}} <b>diaphragmatic</b> <b>hernias,</b> three with <b>traumatic</b> and three with congenital hernias. The mean age of patients was 58. 6 years (range, 42 - 83 years). Five patients presented with main complaints of postprandial retrosternal/chest discomfort and one patient had an acute gastric outlet obstruction. Dissection was performed laparoscopically to reduce {{the contents of the}} sac and the hernial defect was repaired using prolene sutures and a polypropylene mesh. ResultsLaparoscopic repair of <b>diaphragmatic</b> <b>hernias</b> was completed successfully in all patients. The mean size of the defect was 6. 8 cm (range, 3 - 12 cm) and the mean operative time was 100 minutes (range, 60 - 150 minutes). There were no major intraoperative complications. One patient required placement of a chest tube due to inadvertent opening of the pleura with the hernial sac and one patient had prolonged postoperative gastric ileus.

40|$|Abstract Introduction <b>Traumatic</b> <b>diaphragmatic</b> <b>hernias</b> are {{an unusual}} {{presentation}} of trauma, and are observed in about 10 % of diaphragmatic injuries. The diagnosis is often missed because of non-specific clinical signs, {{and the absence}} of additional intra-abdominal and thoracic injuries. Case presentation We report a case of a 59 -year-old Italian man hospitalized for abdominal pain and vomiting. His medical history included a blunt trauma seven years previously. A chest X-ray showed right diaphragm elevation, and computed tomography revealed that the greater omentum, a portion of the colon and the small intestine had been transposed in the hemithorax through a diaphragm rupture. The patient underwent laparotomy, at which time the colon and small intestine were reduced back into the abdomen and the diaphragm was repaired. Conclusions This was a unusual case of <b>traumatic</b> right-sided <b>diaphragmatic</b> <b>hernia.</b> <b>Diaphragmatic</b> ruptures may be revealed many years after the initial trauma. The suspicion of diaphragmatic rupture in a patient with multiple traumas contributes to early diagnosis. Surgical repair remains the only curative treatment for <b>diaphragmatic</b> <b>hernias.</b> Prosthetic patches may be a good solution when the diaphragmatic defect is severe and too large for primary closure, whereas primary repair remains the gold standard for the closure of small to moderate sized diaphragmatic defects. </p...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Recent {{experience}} with <b>traumatic</b> <b>diaphragmatic</b> <b>hernias</b> at the Massachusetts General Hospital was reviewed to identify pitfalls {{in the diagnosis}} and treatment of this injury. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: <b>Traumatic</b> <b>diaphragmatic</b> disruption is a common injury and a marker of severe trauma. It occurs in 5 % of hospitalized automobile accident victims and 10 % of victims of penetrating chest trauma. Numerous reports describe splenic rupture in 25 % of patients with blunt diaphragmatic rupture, liver lacerations in 25 %, pelvic fracture in 40 %, and thoracic aortic tears in 5 %. Diaphragmatic rupture is a predictor of serious associated injuries which, unfortunately, is itself often occult. METHODS: A chart review of all patients admitted to the Trauma Service with <b>traumatic</b> <b>diaphragmatic</b> <b>hernias</b> was undertaken for the period of January 1982 to June 1992. RESULTS: Data on 68 patients sustaining blunt (n = 25) and penetrating (n = 43) diaphragmatic rupture or laceration were presented. The diagnosis was made preoperatively in only 21 (31 %). Associated injuries were frequent in those injured by either blunt or penetrating trauma. Sixty-six patients underwent repair, 54 (82 %) through a laparotomy alone and 12 (18 %) {{with the addition of a}} thoracotomy. There were five (7. 4 %) deaths that were caused by coagulopathy, hemorrhagic shock, multisystem organ failure, and pulmonary embolism. Complications were twice as frequent in the blunt-trauma group and included abscess, pneumonia, and the sequelae of closed head injuries. CONCLUSIONS: The recognition of diaphragmatic rupture is important because of the frequency and severity of associated injuries. The difficulties in reaching the diagnosis require an aggressive search in patients at risk...|$|R
40|$|<b>Diaphragmatic</b> <b>hernia</b> {{secondary}} to blunt or penetrating trauma is rarely by itself a fatal event. However, if unpercieved, it {{may lead to}} severe complications caused by herniation of abdominal contents to the ethorax. Blunt trauma related to car accidents is the most frequent cause of <b>diaphragmatic</b> <b>hernias.</b> Associated injuries are frequently observed, provoked by severe traumas of great impact. These blunt trauma hernias occur mainly {{on the left side}} due to abdominal anatomy, since the liver is usually located on the right side. When injuries are observed on the right they tend to be more severe, generally related to major trauma of solid organs. Less frequently <b>diaphragmatic</b> <b>hernias</b> may be bilateral. The management of diaphragmatic injury would appear to be a simple matter of suturing the defect. However, peroperative diagnosis can be difficult and even at the time of surgery some diaphragmatic injuries can be overlooked if carefull exploration is not done. Associated injuries tend to divert attention from the diaphragmatic injury. Laparoscopic diagnosis and repair have been described with successfull. Laparotomy or thoracotomy can be employed for surgical repair of <b>traumatic</b> <b>diaphragmatic</b> <b>hernias.</b> Standard (laboratory/imaging) examinations may fail to make the diagnosis. Recently, the laparoscopic approach has proved useful for more precise evaluation of such injuries, very often allowing immediate repair of these lesions...|$|R

40|$|AbstractINTRODUCTIONPost <b>traumatic</b> <b>diaphragmatic</b> <b>hernia</b> is {{very often}} missed {{particularly}} in polytrauma patients. We present {{case of an}} isolated post <b>traumatic</b> <b>diaphragmatic</b> <b>hernia</b> with strangulation, a very rare finding. PRESENTATION OF CASEA 35 year old man presented with features of intestinal obstruction with past history of a seemingly trivial blunt thoracic injury 15 years back. Findings of X-ray abdomen and chest with high leukocyte count raised suspicion of obstructed diaphragmatic hernia which on exploration revealed obstructed diaphragmatic hernia with gangrenous bowel segment. DISCUSSIONBlunt injury of diaphragm is relatively common and is considered as a marker of severe trauma and it can clinically be occult as other violent injuries may mask and disguise its initial clinical presentation 1 resulting in late presentation with obstruction and/or rarely strangulation. An early diagnosis of the condition is prudent to avoid morbidity and mortality associated with late presentations.

40|$|Most <b>traumatic</b> <b>diaphragmatic</b> <b>hernias</b> {{are caused}} by blunt {{abdominal}} or thoracic trauma. 1 However, penetrating injury to the diaphragm is also a cause, albeit infrequent, that usually results in a delayed <b>diaphragmatic</b> <b>hernia,</b> and causes visceral strangulation. 2 A young patient with incarcerated hernia due to remote penetrating diaphragmatic injury is presented. A CT scan could preoperatively suggest the diagnosis, which was confirmed by surgical repair of the diaphragmatic defect. In this report, we stress that a CT scan can provide useful information for preoperative evaluation of diaphragmatic injuries. Case report A 26 -year-old previously healthy man presented at the emergency department after a 2 -day period of persistent left-lower chest discomfort that radiated to the upper abdomen.

40|$|Background: <b>Diaphragmatic</b> <b>hernias</b> are {{relatively}} common after blunt and penetrating trauma. The difficulties in diagnosing <b>traumatic</b> <b>diaphragmatic</b> rupture (TDR) due to coexisting {{problems and the}} silent nature of these injuries {{at the time of}} first admission are the common causes of morbidity and mortality. Materials and Methods: Medical records of 34 patients treated for post <b>traumatic</b> <b>diaphragmatic</b> <b>hernias</b> between August 2003 and June 2007 in Al-Zahra Hospital, were studied and data including age, sex, kind and site of trauma, timing and accompanying injuries were recorded and analyzed retrospectively. Â Â Results: There were 28 (82. 4) men and 6 (17. 6) women, with age range of 1 to 68 years and mean of 32. 2 Â± 9. 1. Rupture of diaphragm was left-sided in 22 (64. 7) and right-sided in 11 (32. 4) and both in 1 (2. 9). Blunt trauma accounted for 22 (64. 7) of patients. Elective operation was done in 7 (20. 6) cases. Diagnosis was established preoperatively in 15 patients (44. 1), and intraoperatively in 13 (38. 2). The diagnosis was missed in 6 (17. 7) patients in first operation. Strangulation of viscera was found in four patients. The longest interval between trauma and diagnosis was about 3 years in one case. Mean duration of hospital stay was 12. 3 days. Multiple associated injuries were observed in 22 patients (66. 7). Postoperative complications were encountered in 9 (26. 5) patients, and the overall mortality was 14. 7.

Details of their clinical presentation, mode of diagnosis, operative findings and postoperative outcome were analysed. ResultsTwenty nine patients underwent surgery for <b>traumatic</b> <b>diaphragmatic</b> <b>hernia.</b> The cause of rupture was blunt trauma in 24 (83 %) patients and penetrating trauma in 5 (17 %) patients.

40|$|<b>Traumatic</b> <b>diaphragmatic</b> <b>hernia</b> {{is defined}} as a {{laceration}} of the diaphragm with an abdominal viscera herniation into the thorax. It is usually asymptomatic, {{with the exception of the}} cases with obstruction, strangulation, necrosis or perforation of the herniaded viscera.

At the latent phase, symptoms are indefinite and the radiological signals, which are suggestive of thoracic affections, are frequent and can induce a diagnosis error, leading to inadequate treatment. This article presents a case of chronic <b>traumatic</b> <b>diaphragmatic</b> <b>hernia</b> which was complicated by a gastricpleuralcutaneous fistula, due to an inadequate thoracic drainage. Considering that this is a chronic affection with an unquestionable surgical indication, due to the complications risk, it is essential to have a detailed diagnostic investigation, which aims at both avoiding an intempestive or inadequate therapeutics behaviour and reducing the affection morbimortality.

40|$|During three years, from January 1975 through December 1977, {{the authors}} saw six cases of <b>traumatic</b> left <b>diaphragmatic</b> <b>hernias,</b> {{all of whom}} survived.

Admitting chest x-ray findings were diagnostic for all acute hernias due to blunt trauma and for all hernias presenting with a delayed interval. Digital exploration of all penetrating lower chest wounds is recommended by some authors if exploratory laparotomy is not contemplated. Our preferred approach for the repair of the hernias includes (1) laparotomy for all acute cases, (2) thoracotomy for delayed cases, and (3) separate abdominal thoracic incisions whenever a combined approach is considered necessary.

METHODS: Retrospective analysis of 34 cases of TDH, studying anatomical location, place and time of diagnosis, complementary tests aiding diagnosis, herniated organs, associated traumatism, morbidity and mortality. RESULTS: Twenty-eight male and six female patients {{with an average age}} of 40. 5 years +/- 20. 5, average SAPS score 38. 8. Average length of stay was 19. 1 +/- 13. 6 days, all suffered from closed traumatism and were put on artificial ventilation. The left-side diaphragm was more frequently affected (94. 1 %) then the right. Diagnosis in 19 cases was made up in the first six hours following the diagnosis of traumatism, in four cases within 12 hours and in the remaining cases between 48 hours and 16 years after traumatism. In 13 patients the diagnosis was established intra-operatively. The stomach was typically one of the herniated organs. The most frequently associated lesions at the thoracic level were pulmonary contusion, haemothorax and pneumothorax, and at the abdominal level, haemoperitoneum and splenic lesion. The rates for complications and mortality were 55. 8 % and 11. 7 % respectively. CONCLUSIONS: TDH mainly occurs on the left side through closed thoraco-abdominal trauma following road traffic accidents. This group of patients, on average younger than others admitted to ICU, presents a longer average hospitalisation period, but has lower rates of mortality and lower SAPS severity scores. The most commonly herniated organ was the stomach and the most frequently encountered lesions were cranial-encephalic, splenic and pleural traumatisms.

40|$|Four {{cases of}} severe osteolysis of bones {{subsequent}} to camel bite are described. The first had osteolysis of the ribs with <b>traumatic</b> <b>diaphragmatic</b> <b>hernia.</b> Two cases had similar appearances of gross osteolysis of the shafts of the radius and ulna, whilst one had osteolysis of the humeral shaft. The {{similarities in the}} radiological appearances especially of the gross osteolysis {{at the site of}} trauma are noted. The complications following mammal bites are discussed...|$|E
40|$|A case of {{traumatic}} rupture of the diaphragm with partial gastric herniation is reported. The initial radiographic presentation was left lower lobe pneumonia. Subsequent strangulation and perforation {{of the stomach}} caused pneumothorax. Serial chest radiographs, computed tomography of the chest and abdomen with oral contrast, and a high index of suspicion were instrumental to the diagnosis. Pneumothorax, though rare, must {{be recognized as a}} morbid, obstructive phase complication of <b>traumatic</b> <b>diaphragmatic</b> <b>hernia</b> requiring immediate surgical intervention...|$|E
40|$|Although diaphragmatic {{injuries}} {{caused by}} blunt or penetrating trauma are rare entities, {{they are the}} most commonly misdiagnosed injuries in trauma patients and occur in approximately 3 – 7 % of all abdominal or thoracic traumas. Acute pancreatitis secondary to late presenting diaphragmatic hernia is very rare. Here we present two separate cases: one with acute bowel obstruction and the other with acute pancreatitis secondary to late onset <b>traumatic</b> <b>diaphragmatic</b> <b>hernia</b> (three and twenty-eight years after chest trauma, resp.) ...|$|E
30|$|Faecopneumothorax {{secondary}} to <b>traumatic</b> <b>diaphragmatic</b> injury (TDI) {{is a rare}} but serious presentation. To date, there have only been 12 case reports in the literature in the past 50  years [1 – 12]. The difficulty in diagnosing or ruling out <b>traumatic</b> <b>diaphragmatic</b> injuries from penetrating trauma can result in missed injuries and delayed diagnoses leading to significant morbidity and mortality. We present a case of tension faecopneumothorax resulting from a delayed diagnosis of <b>diaphragmatic</b> <b>hernia</b> containing colon resulting from stab wounds 2  years prior.|$|R
40|$|Acquired <b>diaphragmatic</b> <b>hernias</b> {{are usually}} {{posttraumatic}} in occurrence. In {{patients who have}} blunt trauma and associated <b>diaphragmatic</b> <b>hernia,</b> the diagnosis may be missed or delayed, often leading to poor treatment outcomes. We present a rare occurrence of tension viscerothorax due to missed <b>traumatic</b> <b>diaphragmatic</b> rupture in a 25 -year-old woman whose condition was complicated by gangrene and perforation of the fundus as well as questionable viability of the anterior wall {{of the body of}} the stomach. The patient had a successful emergency transabdominal suture plication of the diaphragm and gastroplasty and has remained symptomless 3 months postoperatively...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: <b>Traumatic</b> <b>diaphragmatic</b> rupture (TDR) needs early {{diagnosis}} and operation. However, the {{early diagnosis}} is usually difficult, {{especially in the}} patients without <b>diaphragmatic</b> <b>hernia.</b> The objective {{of this study was}} to explore the early diagnosis and treatment of TDR. Methods: Data of 256 patients with TDR treated in our department between 1994 and 2013 were analyzed retrospectively regarding to the diagnostic methods, percentage of preoperative judgment, incidence of <b>diaphragmatic</b> <b>hernia,</b> surgical procedures and outcome, etc. Two groups were set up according to the mechanism of injury (blunt or penetrating). Results: Of 256 patients with a mean age of 32. 4 years (9 e 84), 218 were male. The average ISS was 26. 9 (13 e 66); and shock rate was 62. 9...|$|R
