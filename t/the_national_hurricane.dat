5|$|Initially, forecasters at <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> Center {{predicted}} that Matthew {{would take a}} more eastern track and hit the Florida Panhandle. Because the track shifted westward, <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> Center issued a Tropical Storm Warning from the Florida/Alabama border to Intracoastal City, Louisiana {{on the day before}} landfall.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on July 27 as detected by Meteosat imagery. By July 31 the tropical wave began being classified, using the Dvorak Technique, by satellite analysts at <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> Center, in part due to persistent deep convection. Shortly thereafter the system organized enough that <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> Center began classifying it as Tropical Depression Five, roughly halfway between Cape Verde and the Lesser Antilles. The depression moved westward at 17mph (28km/h), intensifying as it did so, and eventually intensified enough to be upgraded to a tropical storm, which was named Dean by <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> Center.|$|E
5|$|After {{weakening}} to a Category1 hurricane on September30, <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> Center {{noted that}} very cold cloud tops still existed, though IR imagery {{indicated that the}} convection and circulation associated with the storm was becoming asymmetrical. Isaac remained a Category1 hurricane for almost 24hours, at which time the storm began to accelerate east-northeastward. Early on October1, <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> Center noted that minimal deep convection persisted near the center {{and much of it}} was displaced to the north. Mid-level dry air and low-level cold air began entering the western quadrant of the storm, which caused it to begin its extratropical transition. By 0600UTC on October1, Isaac weakened to a tropical storm. <b>The</b> <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> Center noted that further weakening would be slow, due to the large wind field associated with the storm. At 1500UTC on October1, <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> Center issued its final advisory on the storm; Isaac fully transitioned into an extratropical cyclone about three hours later, while located about halfway between Newfoundland and the Azores. The extratropical remnants tracked rapidly east-northeastward and affected the British Isles on October3 and October4, eventually merging with another extratropical low while north of Scotland early on October4.|$|E

5|$|Although <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> Center {{does not}} {{consider}} it retired, the World Meteorological Organization lists Greta in its retired hurricane name list.|$|E
5|$|Fourteen hours {{prior to}} Edith making {{landfall}} in Central America, <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> Center warned citizens about the extreme {{danger of the}} approaching hurricane, {{and asked them to}} prepare for hurricane conditions. While the storm was located in the Gulf of Mexico, <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> Center issued a Hurricane Warning from Cameron to Morgan City, Louisiana eighteen hours before the hurricane made landfall. Edith later struck land in the middle portion of the warning area.|$|E
5|$|In Bermuda, <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> Center {{issued a}} {{hurricane}} watch on August 5. The hurricane watch was later {{changed to a}} hurricane warning the following day. Dean’s approach to the island canceled numerous inbound and outbound flights. In Atlantic Canada, <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> Center issued a hurricane warning for Nova Scotia and Sable Island, while the Canadian forecasters issued a high wind advisory.|$|E
50|$|However, {{there has}} been an {{occasion}} that <b>the</b> United States <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> Center violated <b>the</b> definition and designated Calvin (2011) as a 35-knot remnant low.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> initial <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> Center {{forecasts}} {{predicted that}} Katrina would begin turning northward after landfall, eventually {{to hit the}} Florida Panhandle approximately three to four days later. Katrina, however, continued a westerly and west-southwesterly track, which eventually shifted the forecast track westward to New Orleans.|$|R
25|$|A {{lynchpin}} of <b>the</b> NOAA <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> Research Laboratory's hurricane-research fleet is the Lockheed WP-3D Orion (P-3). It has two barber-pole samplers (named {{for their}} red-and-white stripes) which protrude from the aircraft's front, a tail Doppler weather radar, and other unique-looking instruments {{hanging from the}} wing.|$|R
5|$|Later on September22, <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> Center began {{noting the}} {{possibility}} of increasing wind shear due to a large upper trough. Despite this, the intensity predictions did not forecast weakening within the next three days. Isaac continued to strengthen and reached hurricane status at 1200UTC on September23. However, <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> Center did not operationally upgrade Isaac until 2100UTC on September23, at which time the storm was a Category2 hurricane. Thereafter, Isaac significantly intensified, and on the following day, it reached an initial peak intensity with winds of 120mph (205km/h). <b>The</b> <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> Center then predicted Isaac would become a Category4 hurricane on September25, though this did not materialize.|$|E
5|$|A large {{tropical}} wave {{emerged into}} the Atlantic Ocean {{from the west}} coast of Africa, on September7. The system passed south of Cape Verde on September8, with disorganized showers and thunderstorms. Around that time, <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> Center gave the system a medium chance of tropical cyclogenesis within 48hours. A low pressure area developed along the axis of the tropical wave on September9, which caused convective activity to increase further. The system was assessed with a high chance for tropical cyclone formation on September10. Based on satellite intensity estimates, <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> Center declared the disturbance as Tropical Depression Fourteen at 1200UTC on September10, while located about 885miles (1,425km) west of Cape Verde.|$|E
5|$|At 0000UTC on September20, the {{depression}} made landfall near Punta Cabezas, Nicaragua with winds of 35mph (55km/h) and weakening was immediately forecast. Three hours later, <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> Center issued its final advisory, as {{the lower level}} center became poorly defined because of interaction with the mountains of Central America and deep thunderstorm activity had significantly diminished. <b>The</b> <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> Center noted the possibility of regeneration, if the circulation entered into the Pacific Ocean within a few days. Although {{the depression}} never redeveloped, the remnant tropical wave emerged into the Pacific Ocean {{and contributed to the}} development of Hurricane Juliette on September21.|$|E
5|$|The {{scale was}} {{developed}} in 1971 by civil engineer Herbert Saffir and meteorologist Robert Simpson, {{who at the time}} was director of <b>the</b> U.S. <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> Center (NHC). <b>The</b> scale was introduced to the general public in 1973, and saw widespread use after Neil Frank replaced Simpson {{at the helm of the}} NHC in 1974.|$|R
50|$|Many {{operational}} numerical {{weather prediction}} centers began assimilating QuikSCAT data in early 2002, with preliminary assessments indicating a positive impact. <b>The</b> U.S. <b>National</b> Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) led the way by initiating assimilation of QuikSCAT winds beginning, respectively, on 13 January 2002 and 22 January 2002. QuikSCAT surface winds were an important tool for analysis and forecasting at <b>the</b> U.S. <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> Center since becoming available in near-real time in 2000.|$|R
5|$|Nora formed {{early on}} September 16, 1997, while located 290miles (460km) {{southwest}} of the Mexican port of Acapulco, Guerrero, from the same tropical wave that had earlier created Hurricane Erika. Due to favorable conditions associated with El Niño, the tropical disturbance quickly achieved deep convection and became well-organized. By 6 a.m. UTC, <b>the</b> U.S. <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> Center had designated the disturbance as Tropical Depression Sixteen-E. Half a day later, it had gained enough strength to be named Tropical Storm Nora.|$|R
5|$|By 1500UTC on September 27, <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> Center {{declared}} Bonnie extratropical, {{since it}} was losing tropical characteristics. Bonnie re-acquired tropical characteristics, and <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> Center resumed advisories on the storm by 2100UTC on September 28. However, post-analysis indicated that Bonnie remained tropical during that time period. Bonnie re-strengthened to a strong tropical storm before vertical wind shear weakened it while approaching the Azores. Shortly before becoming extratropical on September 30, Bonnie passed through the Azores as a moderately weak tropical storm. One location in the Azores reported tropical storm force winds. In addition, one man {{was killed by a}} rock fall on the island of São Miguel. No damage was reported in association with Bonnie.|$|E
5|$|By 4 {{days before}} Isabel made landfall, most {{computer}} models predicted Isabel {{to make landfall}} between North Carolina and New Jersey, and <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> Center consistently forecast a landfall on North Carolina. Initially, forecasters predicted a landfall in the northeastern portion of the state, though as the hurricane neared land the predicted landfall position was much closer to where it ultimately was. From three days in advance, the average track forecast error for its landfall was only 36miles (58km), and for 48hours in advance the average track error was 18miles (29km). Strong confidence in Isabel's final landfall prompted <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> Center to issue a hurricane watch for the entire North Carolina coastline about 50hours before Isabel struck land. 38hours before the hurricane made landfall, <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> Center upgraded the watch to a hurricane warning for the landfall area. The Newport Weather Forecast Office issued a flood potential statement two days before landfall, which indicated a threat for flash flooding. The office began preparing for the hurricane one week before landfall, and brought additional staff members to assist with hurricane related duties.|$|E
5|$|Information is sparse for {{earlier years}} due to {{limitations}} in tropical cyclone observation, though as coastlines became more populated, more data became available. <b>The</b> <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> Center recognizes the uncertainty {{in both the}} death tolls and the dates of the events.|$|E
50|$|The Regional Specialized Meteorological Center {{for this}} basin is <b>the</b> United States' <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> Center. Previous forecasters are the Eastern Pacific Hurricane Center and the Joint Hurricane Warning Center. The RSMC {{monitors}} the eastern Pacific and issues reports, watches and warnings about tropical weather systems and cyclones {{as defined by}} the World Meteorological Organization.|$|R
5|$|The 2005 Azores {{subtropical}} {{storm was}} the 19th nameable storm of the record-breaking 2005 Atlantic hurricane season. It was not officially named by <b>the</b> US <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> Center {{as it was}} operationally classified as a non-tropical low. The storm developed in the eastern Atlantic Ocean out of a low-pressure area that gained subtropical characteristics on October4. The storm was short-lived, crossing over the Azores later on October4 before becoming extratropical again on October5. Neither damages nor fatalities were reported during that time. After being absorbed into a cold front, the system {{went on to become}} Hurricane Vince, which affected the Iberian Peninsula.|$|R
500|$|The storm {{continued}} {{to the southwest}} while deep convection persisted near <b>the</b> center. <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> Center forecaster James Franklin remarked, [...] "Confidence at the later ranges [...] was unusually low", due to wide divergences between computer models. Late on October 17, a Hurricane Hunters flight into Wilma recorded winds of , but an unusually low pressure of 989mbar (29.21inHg), which would be more typical of a minimal hurricane. This was due to unusually low pressures across the region, {{which resulted in a}} lesser pressure gradient and thus lighter winds. Convection {{continued to}} develop near the center and became much more symmetrical.|$|R
5|$|On September 9, about 16hours before Florence made landfall, <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> Center {{issued a}} {{hurricane}} watch from Port Arthur, Texas to Pensacola, Florida. Three hours later, the watch was upgraded to a hurricane warning from Pensacola to Cameron, Louisiana, with {{a tropical storm}} warning issued from Pensacola eastward to Apalachicola, Florida. Around the time of Florence moving ashore, <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> Center limited the hurricane warning from Pensacola, Florida to Morgan City, Louisiana. Hours after the hurricane made landfall, the warning {{was replaced by a}} tropical storm warning from Mobile, Alabama to Grand Isle, Louisiana, which was discontinued two hours later.|$|E
5|$|Operationally Erika {{was never}} {{upgraded}} to hurricane status. Based on a persistent eye feature on radar and Doppler weather radar-estimated surface winds of 75mph (120km/h), <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> Center posthumously upgraded Erika to a hurricane.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} storm formed, <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> Center issued a {{tropical}} storm watch from {{the southern end of}} Galveston Island to Morgan City, Louisiana. As a more northward motion occurred, the watch was canceled and replaced with a tropical storm warning from High Island, Texas, to Pascagoula, Mississippi. Shortly before the storm made landfall, the warning was discontinued between High Island and Cameron, Louisiana. <b>The</b> <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> Center briefly issued a hurricane watch from Intracoastal City to Morgan City, but it was discontinued when Tropical Storm Bill failed to strengthen. Prior the storm making landfall, local National Weather Service offices issued flash flood watches and a tornado watch for large portions of the Gulf Coast.|$|E
50|$|Robert David Paulison (born February 27, 1947) is an American former {{fire chief}} {{who served as}} the {{director}} of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). Paulison was appointed by President George W. Bush on September 12, 2005 to replace the embattled Michael D. Brown, who resigned amid controversy over his handling of disaster relief in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. Prior to his appointment, Paulison was perhaps best known nationally for his 2003 advisory regarding household items (including duct tape and plastic sheeting) to have on hand in case of terrorist attack. At <b>the</b> 2009 <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> Conference, he announced he would resign January 21, 2009.|$|R
5000|$|A normal {{hurricane}} reconnaissance {{or research}} mission can last from 9-10 hours, while a surveillance ("fix" [...] mission) mission will typically last 8 hours, often in rotation with WC-130 flights from the Air Force Reserve Command's 53rd Weather Reconnaissance Squadron (53 WRS) at six-hour intervals. Most often, the scientists and crew aboard the aircraft deploy dropsondes with GPS which collect and transmit data as they descend toward the ocean. Once this data is received and QC'd by the crew, it {{is sent to}} <b>the</b> NOAA <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> Center for analysis. Other data is collected and transmitted by request. Personnel on board include pilots, navigators, engineers, technicians, and flight meteorologists (Flight Directors).|$|R
5000|$|The agency issues {{forecasts}} out to {{five days}} in the future, hydrological bulletins including recent rainfall, agricultural bulletins, and run their own regional forecast model based upon the MM5. They also issue warnings for intense storms, strong northerlies in the Gulf of Mexico, snowfall, and excessive rainfall. [...] Surface analyses for the region are drawn by the Tropical Prediction Center which are incorporated onto the Hydrometeorological Prediction Center analysis and then linked to by SMN on their website. [...] They issue their own tropical cyclone reports that describe the impact of storms on Mexico, which are then relayed to <b>the</b> U.S. <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> Center and <b>the</b> World Meteorological Organization.|$|R
5|$|Swells from Erin {{produced}} rip currents {{along the}} North Carolina coastline. Waves {{were expected to}} reach over 6feet (1.8m) in height. Officials at <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> Center cautioned authorities and residents to monitor the rough seas.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> Center {{noted that}} the {{precursor}} disturbance {{had the potential to}} drop heavy rainfall which could result in life-threatening flash flooding or mudslides in Oaxaca and Guerrero. However, no damage reports were received there.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> Center {{stated in}} its {{forecast}} on September3 that Gabrielle had a 10percent chance of affecting the Leeward Islands in three days. On September5, meteorologists forecast the storm to bypass {{north of the}} Virgin Islands and told the press {{that it is too}} early to suggest that the storm might hit the United States four or five days ahead of its current position. As Hurricane Gabrielle moved west-northwest, forecasters at <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> Center advised residents along the East Coast of the United States to monitor the storm because of its large size and strong swells it is producing. When Gabrielle, recurved northwestward, <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> Center forecast the outer edge of the hurricane to graze Bermuda, bringing tropical storm force winds and strong waves to the island. In Bermuda, cruise ships and other water craft were advised of rough seas and many residents rushed to stores to buy emergency supplies.|$|E
5000|$|The storm {{continued}} {{to the southwest}} while deep convection persisted near <b>the</b> center. <b>National</b> <b>Hurricane</b> Center forecaster James Franklin remarked, [...] "Confidence at the later ranges the forecast track was unusually low", due to wide divergences between computer models.
