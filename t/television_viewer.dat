25|$|Structurally, the Australian {{television}} industry was closely modelled on the two-tiered system {{that had been}} in place in Australian radio since the late 1930s. One tier consisted of a network of publicly funded television stations run by the ABC, which was funded by government budget allocation and (until 1972) by fees from <b>television</b> <b>viewer</b> licences. The second tier consisted of the commercial networks and independent stations owned by private operators, whose income came from selling advertising time.|$|E

He remains best remembered for his Decca records; along with Fred Gaisberg and Walter Legge, {{he was one of}} the most influential producers of classical recordings. The Times said of him that [...] "he stood in that great tradition of propagandists from Henry Wood to Leonard Bernstein, who seek to bring their love and knowledge of music to the widest audience." ...|$|E
2500|$|... 60 Minutes {{consists}} of three long-form news stories, without superimposed graphics. There is a commercial break between two stories. Each story is introduced from a set with a backdrop resembling pages from a magazine story on the same topic. The program undertakes its own investigations and follows up on investigations instigated by national newspapers and other sources. [...] Unlike its most famous competitor 20/20 as well as traditional local and national news programs, the 60 Minutes journalists never share the screen with (or speak to) other 60 Minutes journalists on camera at any time. [...] This creates a strong psychological sense of intimacy between the journalist and the <b>television</b> <b>viewer.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Both {{series of}} Are You Afraid of the Dark? {{revolved}} around {{a group of}} teenagers who referred to themselves as [...] "The Midnight Society." [...] Every week, at a secret location in the woods, one member would tell a scary story to the group. The actual story, rather than the telling, was displayed to the <b>television</b> <b>viewer.</b> The story was shown between the group's arrival at the site and their departure. Each storyteller would begin their story by saying [...] "Submitted for {{the approval of the}} Midnight Society, I call this story,”whatever" [...] at which point he or she would toss a handful of [...] "midnight dust" [...] from a leather pouch into a campfire to heighten the flames and produce an eerie white smoke. Creator MacHale wrote the line [...] "submitted for the approval of" [...] as a nod to the show The Twilight Zone, in which creator Rod Serling would, after introducing the episode, say [...] "submitted for your approval." [...] The storyteller would continue by announcing its title (The Tale of...).|$|E
2500|$|In the book, five {{distinct}} [...] "mono-dialogues", a term Loevy himself used {{in personal}} correspondence, {{are used to}} tell the story of the family to an assumed listening partner, who is neither seen nor heard. Each of these mono-dialogues is different, and given by different people in different languages or period-appropriate forms of Hebrew. Loevy captured this in the film, creating a new television vocabulary. The [...] "mono-dialogue" [...] technique eliminated the [...] "fourth wall" [...] taboo of television and film, according to which the audience absolves itself of traditional neutrality and assumes the role of a character in the story. In Loevy's own words, [...] "Television demands text, but the <b>television</b> <b>viewer</b> is used to getting the complete text. Every question has an answer...." [...] In Mr. Mani, the role of respondent is filled by the camera and, by extension, the audience itself. [...] "As soon as the speaker turns to the camera—in other words, to the audience, speaking directly to it in a way that demands an answer, it is as if the speaker stepped out of the screen, almost like in Woody Allen's The Purple Rose of Cairo. The viewer is shaken up. The artificial nature of the situation itself in Mr. Mani screams its presence.". Like the characters in Luigi Pirandello's Six Characters in Search of an Author, the characters cease being the subjects of scrutiny by some external viewer. The external viewer, i.e., the audience, becomes a partner in dialogue with the actors and an active participant in the story.|$|E
