40|$|We {{probe the}} temperature- A nd pressure-dependent {{specific}} volume (v) and dipolar {{dynamics of the}} amorphous phase (in both the supercooled liquid and glass states) of the <b>ternidazole</b> drug (TDZ). Three molecular dynamic processes are identified by means of dielectric spectroscopy, namely the α relaxation, which vitrifies at the glass transition, a Johari-Goldstein β JG relaxation, and an intramolecular process associated with the relaxation motion of the propanol chain of the TDZ molecule. The lineshapes of dielectric spectra characterized by the same relaxation time (isochronal spectra) are virtually identical, within the studied temperature and pressure ranges, so that the time-temperature-pressure superposition principle holds for TDZ. The α and β JG relaxation times fulfil the density-dependent thermodynamic scaling: Master curves result when they are plotted against the thermodynamic quantity Tv γ, with thermodynamic exponent γ approximately equal to 2. These {{results show that the}} dynamics of TDZ, a system characterized by strong hydrogen bonding, is characterized by an isomorphism similar to that of van-der-Waals systems. The low value of γ can be rationalized in terms of the relatively weak density-dependence of the dynamics of hydrogen-bonded systems...|$|E
40|$|A {{confirmatory method}} has been {{developed}} {{to allow for the}} analysis of eleven nitroimidazoles and also chloramphenicol in milk and honey samples. These compounds are classified as A 6 compounds in annex IV of council regulation 2377 / 90 and therefore prohibited for the use in animal husbandry. Milk samples are extracted by acetonitrile with addition of NaCl, while honey samples are first dissolved in water before a similar extraction. Honey extracts undergo a hexane wash to remove impurities. Both milk and honey extracts are evaporated to dryness and reconstituted in initial mobile phase. These are then injected onto an LC-MS/MS system and analysed in less than 9 minutes. The MS/MS is operated in MRM mode with positive and negative electrospray ionisation. The method is validated in accordance with Commission Decision 2002 / 657 /EC and is capable of analysing for metronidazole, dimetridazole, ronidazole, ipronidazole and there hydroxy metabolites MNZ-OH, HMMNI and IPZ-OH. The method is also able to analyse for carnidazole, ornidazole, <b>ternidazole,</b> tinidazole and chloramphenicol. A level of 3 μg L- 1 / μg kg- 1 (RL) for MNZ, DMZ and RNZ has been recommended by the community reference laboratory responsible for this substance group and this method can easily detect all nitroimidazoles at this level. A minimum required performance level of 0. 3 μg L- 1 / μg kg- 1 is in place for chloramphenicol which the method can also easily detect. For nitroimidazoles the decision limits (CC) and detection capabilities (CC) range from 0. 41 to 1. 55 μg L- 1 and 0. 70 to 2. 64 μg L- 1 respectively in milk and from 0. 38 to 1. 16 μg kg- 1 and 0. 66 to 1. 98 μg kg- 1 respectively in honey. For chloramphenicol the values are 0. 07 and 0. 11 μg L- 1 in milk and 0. 08 and 0. 13 μg kg- 1 in honey. Validation criteria of accuracy, precision, repeatability and reproducibility along with measurement uncertainty are calculated for all analytes in both matrices...|$|E

A recommended level (RL) of 3 ppb has been issued by the community reference laboratory (CRL) for MNZ, DMZ and RNZ and this method can easily detect all nitroimidazoles at this level. A (MRPL) of 0. 3 ppb is in place for chloramphenicol which the method can also easily detect. For nitroimidazoles the decision limits (CCα) and detection capabilities (CCβ) range from 0. 41 to 1. 55 ng ml- 1 and 0. 70 to 2. 64 ng ml- 1 respectively in milk and from 0. 38 to 1. 16 ng ml- 1 and 0. 66 to 1. 98 ng g- 1 respectively in honey.
