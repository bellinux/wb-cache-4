500|$|Throughout the song, {{the lyrics}} {{seemingly}} show the evolving {{relationship between the}} couple. Carey sings Anytime you need a friend / I will be here / You'll never be alone again / So don't you fear / Even if you're miles away / I'm by your side / So don't you ever be lonely / Love will make it alright, which hints at a current friendship where more still uncovered emotions are present. Author Chris Nickson explains on the song's switch in relationship, as the lyrics change to If you just believe in me / I will love you endlessly / <b>Take</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> / Take me into your heart / I'll be there forever baby / I won't let go / I'll never let go. The protagonist is {{willing to accept the}} relationship as only a friend, but tells her partner that no matter his feelings for her, she loves him and still wishes to be loved by him, something she will never forget or [...] "let go".|$|E
2500|$|Lyrically, [...] "End of Time" [...] is a {{declaration}} of co-dependence; Knowles professes her everlasting love to her romantic interest. As stated by Spencer Kornhaber of The Atlantic, [...] "At the start, she's stricken by her own emotional vulnerability; by the end, she's empowered by it." [...] The song opens with [...] "spitfire drums" [...] while Knowles sings in an almost distorted fashion, with her vocals layered underneath until a [...] "dramatic explosion". As her vocals continue to build up, Knowles airily chants: [...] "Come <b>take</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand</b> / I won’t let you go / I’ll be your friend / I will love you so deeply / I {{will be the one}} to kiss you at night / I will love you till the end of time." [...] She continues her appeal as she sings to her love interest, [...] "Take you away from here / There's nothing between us but space and time". On the bridge, Knowles belts her vocal lines over a shooting horn sequence; with her multiple-layered vocals, she commands, [...] "Boy come to me", and towards the end, she repeatedly sings, [...] "Say you’ll never let me go". Knowles [...] "finds the strength in two" [...] as she affirms to her romantic interest, [...] "I just wanna be with you / I just wanna live for you / I'd never let you go!".|$|E
2500|$|Lewis Corner of Digital Spy {{rated the}} song with five stars {{out of five}} and wrote, [...] "Add the star's sultry tones and a ludicrously {{addictive}} toe-trotting pre-chorus and it easily {{ranks as one of}} Bey's most colourful and fun cuts to date". In the review of 4, Corner also noted that the [...] "carnival-styled brass sections stand out as the record's quirkier production elements, adding bursts of sass" [...] to the song. Joanne Dorken of MTV UK wrote that the beat, which builds up throughout the song, gives it a [...] "memorable sound" [...] and makes it [...] "insanely catchy". He concluded that [...] "End of Time" [...] is [...] "guaranteed to fill a dance floor". Erika Ramirez of Billboard magazine called [...] "End of Time" [...] an addictive song, adding that it [...] "hits strong from jump with the orchestration". In another review, she further praised The-Dream's production, the drums and said that it should have been released as the lead single from the album. Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph and Craig Jenkins of Prefix Magazine chose the song as a highlight of the album, with the later calling it [...] "a joyfully vibrant collision of Afrobeat and Latin jazz". Jody Rosen of Rolling Stone commented that [...] "End of Time" [...] effectively shows that Fela Kuti was a big inspiration for Knowles' while producing 4. Matthew Perpetua of the same publication commended the song for being one of the most adventurous cuts on 4; he noted that Knowles sings [...] "lovey-dovey lyrics over an ecstatic, beat-heavy arrangement". Spencer Kornhaber of The Antlantic noted that the line [...] "'Come <b>take</b> <b>my</b> <b>hand,</b> I will never let you go,' comes off as a reversal, an assertion of Beyoncé's own irreplaceability".|$|E
