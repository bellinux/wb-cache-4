5|$|Due to its poor performance, Friedman {{believed}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> Reserve Board {{should be}} abolished.

5|$|In 1803 Harrison asked Congress {{to suspend}} the anti-slavery clause of the Northwest Ordinance for ten years.

In 1803 the entire territory's population numbered less than 5,000. That year the legislature—which was appointed by Harrison—passed legislation reintroducing indentured servitude.|$|E

5|$|On 3February, {{the head}} of the State Emergency Service (SES) and then-Premier Joh Bjelke-Petersen toured {{northern}} Queensland to inspect damage. The government of Australia vowed to assist by providing financial and emergency services, also offering to provide aid to banana and sugar cane farmers who suffered losses as a result of Winifred. Two government helicopters were sent shortly thereafter, assessing the severity of damage, evacuating residents, and delivering food. Bjelke-Petersen later expressed anger at the federal government for having increased the threshold for disaster relief before raising loans, and also stated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> Minister for Primary Industry, John Kerin, had no right to accompany him on his visit to northern Queensland, only offering to discuss an offer provided <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> government was willing to provide financial assistance. Approximately 500volunteers for the SES were deployed the same day, reinstating electrical and other essential services, evacuating regional citizens, delivering bread to numerous towns, and sending 700tarpaulins to shield roofless houses. Rescue and relief work was hindered by high traffic on telephone networks, forcing Telecom to cease calls between Townsville and Ingham.|$|E

5|$|The Supreme Court of the United States issued {{almost no}} {{constitutional}} criminal procedure decisions {{for its first}} century of existence. Professor Akhil Amar highlights two reasons for this. First, the Court's decision in Barron v.

Second, the Court lacked general appellate jurisdiction over federal criminal cases until 1891.|$|E
5|$|As the {{disaster}} in New Orleans intensified, critics charged that Bush was misrepresenting his administration's role {{in what they}} saw as a flawed response. Leaders attacked Bush for having appointed apparently incompetent leaders to positions of power at FEMA, notably Michael D.

Bush responded to mounting criticism by accepting full responsibility for the federal government's failures in its handling of the emergency. It has been argued that with Katrina, Bush passed a political tipping point from which he would not recover.|$|E

5|$|By May 1947, {{authorities}} in Vojvodina {{noted that there}} was a dispute between them and the {{authorities in}} Croatia regarding the interpretation of the position of the border along the Danube, and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> authorities, who were asked to mediate in the dispute, supported the position of Croatia. At the same time, Vojvodina requested that Croatia return the territories on the right bank of the Danube that had previously been ceded to it (Varoš-Viza and Mala Siga). While in the Yugoslav framework, the issue received little further attention as its resolution was discouraged by the federal authorities, and because the area involved had limited economic value, was uninhabited and frequently flooded.|$|E
5|$|By mid-1841, {{the federal}} {{government}} faced a projected budget deficit of $11 million. Tyler recognized the need for higher tariffs, but wished {{to stay within the}} 20 percent rate created by the 1833 Compromise Tariff. He also supported a plan to distribute to the states any revenue from the sales of public land, as an emergency measure to manage the states' growing debt, even though this would cut federal revenue. The Whigs supported high protectionist tariffs and national funding of state infrastructure, and so there was enough overlap to forge a compromise. The Distribution Act of 1841 created a distribution program, with a ceiling on tariffs at 20 percent; a second bill increased tariffs to that figure on previously low-tax goods. Despite these measures, by March 1842 it had become clear <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> government was still in dire fiscal straits.|$|E
