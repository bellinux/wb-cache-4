5|$|Fleshy lobe-fins {{supported}} on bones rather than ray-stiffened fins seem <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>an</b> ancestral trait of all bony fishes (Osteichthyes). The lobe-finned {{ancestors of the}} tetrapods evolved them further, while the ancestors of the ray-finned fishes (Actinopterygii) evolved their fins in a different direction. The most primitive group of actinopterygians, the bichirs, still have fleshy frontal fins.|$|E
5|$|Men on a Mission {{continued}} to challenge The Quebecers for the tag team belts. Men on a Mission won the title on March 29, 1994. This is said <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>an</b> unplanned title change, as Mabel accidentally fell on Pierre {{to get the}} pinfall. This title reign lasted only two days, however, as The Quebecers won the titles back in a rematch.|$|E

5|$|Mesa Verdeans used astronomical {{observations}} to plan their farming and religious ceremonies, drawing on both natural {{features in the}} landscape and masonry structures built for this purpose. Several great houses in the region were aligned to the cardinal directions, which positioned windows, doors, and walls along {{the path of the}} sun, whose rays would indicate the passing of seasons. Mesa Verde's Sun Temple is thought <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>an</b> astronomical observatory.|$|E
5|$|Stefanie Rabatsch (née Isak; born 28 December 1887 – died unknown, after 1973) was an Austrian {{woman who}} was alleged by August Kubizek <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>an</b> unrequited love of then-teenage Adolf Hitler. Her Jewish-sounding maiden name has been subject to {{speculation}} in this context. However, {{there is no evidence}} apart from Kubizek that Hitler ever had such an attachment.|$|E
5|$|Structure B7 was a small, well-proportioned {{rectangular}} structure {{south of}} the main Group A plaza, between {{the north end of}} the ballcourt (B1) to the east and Structure B9 to the west. This structure was likely <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>an</b> altar shrine.|$|E

5|$|The small {{satellite}} site of Chak Maman Tok' several kilometers to {{the southwest}} of Motul de San José, appears <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>an</b> important centre {{for the production of}} chert tools, with only a few other centres within the Maya lowlands manufacturing chert on such a scale. Although very small, Chak Maman Tok' probably played a major part within the economy of the Motul de San José polity.|$|E
5|$|According to a 2005 {{profile in}} the book Madcap by biographer and {{journalist}} Tim Willis, Barrett, who had reverted to using his original name of Roger, continued to live in his late mother's semi-detached home in Cambridge, and had returned to painting, creating large abstract canvases. He was also said <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>an</b> avid gardener and his main point of {{contact with the outside}} world was his sister, Rosemary, who lived nearby. He was reclusive, and his physical health declined, as he suffered from stomach ulcers and type 2 diabetes.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the modern}} county of Greater Manchester was not created until 1974, {{the history of}} its {{constituent}} settlements goes back centuries. There is evidence of Iron Age habitation, particularly at Mellor, and Celtic activity in a settlement named Chochion, believed <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>an</b> area of Wigan settled by the Brigantes. Stretford was {{also part of the}} land believed to have been occupied by the Celtic Brigantes tribe, and lay on their border with the Cornovii on the southern side of the River Mersey. The remains of 1st-century forts at Castlefield in Manchester, and Castleshaw Roman fort in Saddleworth, are evidence of Roman occupation. Much of the region was omitted from the Domesday Book of 1086; Redhead states that this was because only a partial survey was taken, rather than sparsity of population.|$|E

Chaoyangopterids in general <b>are</b> now thought <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> similar <b>to</b> azhdarchid pterosaurs, implying that they were probably crane-like terrestrial omnivores and opportunistic carnivores.|$|R

5|$|At {{some point}} in the post-medieval period, the tower was {{deliberately}} damaged to put it beyond military use, a process called slighting. This probably occurred {{towards the end of the}} English Civil War, after the defeat of the Royalist forces in Kent at the Battle of Maidstone. The tower was then owned by Sir John Rayney of Wrotham Place, a Royalist, and would have been an effective lookout tower in any future conflict. There appears <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>an</b> attempt to bring down the whole tower by damaging the stair turret at its base, possibly using gunpowder, which failed due to the spiral staircase's unusually strong design. After this the upper storey of the tower was carefully removed instead, leaving the building roofless.|$|E
5|$|German ornithologist Erwin Stresemann lumped all Australian corvids plus {{other species}} {{as far as}} India into a single species, C. coronoides, as he {{believed}} there was intergradation between all characteristics such as iris colour, colour of feather bases and plumage. This was hotly disputed by Mathews. The official RAOU checklist listed three species (Australian raven, Torresian crow and little crow), with the little raven recognised as a fourth species in 1967 and forest raven in 1970. Streseman described C. difficilis in 1943 from a single specimen, now thought <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>an</b> unusual Australian raven or an Australian raven/Torresian crow hybrid.|$|E
5|$|Group F is to {{the west}} of Group E. Mound F is the main {{structure}} within Group F. It slopes gradually away to the west and was not easily defensible on that side, however it lay outside the strong retaining walls of the fortress and appears <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>an</b> observation platform covering the western pass to the city. A retaining wall supported the mound above the pass and a round earth platform upon the mound may have supported a perishable watchtower.|$|E

5|$|Historically, {{competitive}} devaluations {{have been}} rare as countries have generally preferred {{to maintain a}} high value for their currency. Countries have generally allowed market forces to work, or have participated in systems of managed exchanges rates. An exception occurred when a currency war {{broke out in the}} 1930s when countries abandoned the gold standard during the Great Depression and used currency devaluations in an attempt to stimulate their economies. Since this effectively pushes unemployment overseas, trading partners quickly retaliated with their own devaluations. The period is considered <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>an</b> adverse situation for all concerned, as unpredictable changes in exchange rates reduced overall international trade.|$|E
5|$|In Brazil, Décio Colla, the Mayor of the City of São Francisco de Paula, Rio Grande do Sul, mobilized the {{population}} {{to prepare for the}} end of the world by stocking up on food and supplies. In the city of Corguinho, in the Mato Grosso do Sul, a colony was built for survivors of the expected tragedy. In Alto Paraíso de Goiás, the hotels also made specific reservations for prophetic dates. On 11 October 2012, in the Brazilian city of Teresina, police interrupted what was believed <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>an</b> attempted mass suicide by up to one hundred members of a cult headed by self-proclaimed prophet Luis Pereira dos Santos, who predicted the end of the world on the feast day of Our Lady of Aparecida. Santos was subsequently arrested.|$|E
5|$|In {{some parts}} of Iron Age Scotland, quite unlike almost all of {{recorded}} history {{right up to the}} present day, there does not seem <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>an</b> hierarchical elite. Studies have shown that these stone roundhouses, with massively thick walls must have contained virtually the entire population of islands such as Barra and North Uist. Iron Age settlement patterns in Scotland are not homogenous, but in these places {{there is no sign of}} a privileged class living in large castles or forts, or of an elite priestly caste or of peasants with no access to the kind of accommodation enjoyed by the middle classes.|$|E

5|$|La Blanca {{occupied}} a frontier zone between the northeastern and southeastern Petén regions {{and the site}} {{is dominated by the}} acropolis, an especially well built palace complex. The city appears <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>an</b> administrative centre with comparatively little emphasis upon religious or ceremonial activity. It is likely that La Blanca was a subsidiary of a major Maya city such as Yaxha or Naranjo, given the complete absence of hieroglyphic texts and sculpted monuments, and archaeologists presume that La Blanca served as a frontier post or trading centre.|$|E
5|$|Like most European nations the Scots in {{this period}} began to covert from the bow to {{gunpowder}} firearms. Handguns were present in Scottish armies in small numbers from the fifteenth century and there are increasingly frequent references to handguns and arquebus in records. An account of the Scottish vanguard at Haddon Rig in 1542 suggests that half the troops were missile men and half of those were arquebusiers. Equal proportions of missile to melee troops seems <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>an</b> aim of Scottish commanders {{for most of the}} century, although it was not always possible in the field. The main source of firearms were the French, who seem to have extensively rearmed the Scottish after the English invasions of the Rough Wooing.|$|E
5|$|On August 12, a {{tropical}} wave organized to {{a tropical}} depression about 930miles (1,495km) east-southeast {{of the island}} of Barbados. Operationally, the system was not detected until August 14, and it was believed <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>an</b> {{area of low pressure}} when it moved through the eastern Caribbean. It moved to the west-northwest, and it slowly organized to a minimal tropical storm on August 14. Although Hurricane hunters reported winds of hurricane force in squalls, the system was discounted as an easterly wave. On August 15, Tropical Storm Charlie quickly intensified, attaining maximum sustained winds of 75mph (120km/h) after passing through the Lesser Antilles. The small center of circulation passed between Dominica and Guadeloupe in the early morning hours.|$|E
