50|$|<b>Tirapazamine</b> (SR-4233) is an {{experimental}} anticancer drug that is activated to a toxic radical only {{at very low}} levels of oxygen (hypoxia).

Cells in these regions are resistant to killing by radiotherapy and most anticancer drugs.

40|$|<b>Tirapazamine</b> (SR 4233), a bioreductive drug {{selectively}} toxic towards hypoxic cells, {{is presently}} in phase II clinical trials. Since {{it would not}} be expected that all tumours would respond equally to the drug, we are exploring ways of predicting the response of individual tumours. In this study we have tested whether the comet assay, which measures DNA damage in individual cells, can provide a simple, surrogate end point for cell killing by <b>tirapazamine.</b> We examined the relationship between the cytotoxicity of <b>tirapazamine</b> under hypoxic conditions and tirapazamine-induced DNA strand breaks in murine (SCCVII, EMT 6, RIF- 1) and human (HT 1080, A 549, HT 29) tumour cell lines. These results were compared with the relationship between <b>tirapazamine</b> cytotoxicity and another measure of the ability of cells to metabolise tirapazamine; high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis of <b>tirapazamine</b> loss or formation of the two electron reduction product SR 4317. The correlation between the hypoxic cytotoxic potency of <b>tirapazamine</b> and DNA damage was highly significant (r = 0. 905, P = 0. 013). A similar correlation was observed for hypoxic potency and <b>tirapazamine</b> loss (r = 0. 812, P = 0. 050), while the correlation between hypoxic potency and SR 4317 formation was not significant (r = 0. 634, P = 0. 171).

40|$|Recent {{data have}} shown that the in vitro and in vivo {{cytotoxicity}} of bioreductive drugs could be significantly increased when combined with chemotherapy drugs such as cisplatinum, depending on the timing of administration. The aim {{of this study was to}} define the toxicity (animal lethality) and the activity (growth delay assay, excision assay) of a bioreductive drug, <b>tirapazamine,</b> alone and combined with chemotherapy agents (5 -FU, VP 16, bleo, DTIC and c-DDP) on nude mice bearing xenografted human tumours: a rectal carcinoma (HRT 18) and a melanoma (Na 11 +). Animal lethality was markedly increased when <b>tirapazamine</b> at the lethal dose 10 % was combined with the other drugs. For the HRT 18 tumour the combination of <b>tirapazamine</b> and bleomycin significantly increased the delay of regrowth compared with bleomycin alone (P = 0. 04) and was more cytotoxic than <b>tirapazamine</b> alone (P = 0. 04). For the Na 11 + tumours the combination of <b>tirapazamine</b> with VP 16 significantly increased tumour doubling time compared with the controls (P = 0. 001) or VP 16 alone. The combination of <b>tirapazamine</b> and VP 16 was more cytotoxic than VP 16 alone (P = 0. 0001). When compared with c-DDP or <b>tirapazamine</b> alone, there was a significant decrease in plating efficiency when <b>tirapazamine</b> and c-DDP were given at the same time (P = 0. 04), but not when <b>tirapazamine</b> was given 3 h before c-DDP. In conclusion, <b>tirapazamine</b> was shown to be cytotoxic against clonogenic human tumour cells.

The cells were also treated with or without <b>tirapazamine</b> or KU- 2285 (hypoxic cell sensitiser) under hypoxic conditions and irradiated with or without reaeration of the cell suspensions. A dose-dependent increase of MN frequency was observed by <b>tirapazamine</b> treatment and the hypoxic toxicity ratio was about 130 for SCCVII and 37 for G- 361.

40|$|Previously {{we showed}} that <b>tirapazamine</b> (SR 4233, Win 59075) is {{cytotoxic}} towards hepatocytes under conditions of hypoxia but not in 10 % or 95 % oxygen and that bioreduction by DT-diaphorase or cytochrome P 450 {{is not a major}} pathway. In the present study, we report that <b>tirapazamine</b> is highly cytotoxic to isolated rat hepatocytes maintained under 1 % oxygen and the molecular cytotoxic mechanism has been elucidated. Cytotoxicity was prevented by the cytochrome P 450 2 E 1 inhibitors phenyl imidazole, isoniazid, isopropanol or ethanol, suggesting that cytochrome P 450 2 E 1 catalysed <b>tirapazamine</b> reductive bioactivation. By contrast, dicoumarol, a DT-diaphorase inhibitor, markedly increased tirapazamine-induced cytotoxicity. Cytotoxicity was also inhibited in normal but not DT-diaphorase-inactivated hepatocytes by increasing cellular NADH levels with lactate or ethanol or the mitochondrial respiratory inhibitors. Evidence that oxygen activation contributed to cytotoxicity was that glutathione oxidation occurred well before cytotoxicity ensued and that <b>tirapazamine</b> was more cytotoxic towards catalase- or glutathione reductase-inactivated hepatocytes. Furthermore, polyphenolic antioxidants such as quercetin, caffeic acid or purpurogallin, the radical trap Tempol or the iron chelator desferrioxamine prevented tirapazamine-mediated cytotoxicity. However, the antioxidants diphenylphenylenediamine, butylated hydroxyanisole or butylated hydroxytoluene did not prevent cytotoxicity and malonaldehyde formation was not increased, suggesting that lipid peroxidation was not important.

Results: The mean tumor growth was significantly accelerated in hypoxic control tumors (growth time from 70 to 500 mL, 11. 0 d) comparedwith normoxic control tumor...|$|E
40|$|AQ 4 N is a bioreductive {{drug that}} can {{significantly}} enhance the anti-tumour effect of radiation and cyclophosphamide. The {{aim of this}} study was to examine the ability of AQ 4 N to potentiate the anti-tumour effect of cisplatin and to compare it to the chemopotentiation effect of <b>tirapazamine.</b> In the T 50 / 80 murine tumour model, AQ 4 N (50 – 100  mg/kg) was administered 30  min, 2. 5 or 6  h prior to cisplatin (4  mg/kg or 8  mg/kg); this produced an anti-tumour effect that was approximately 1. 5 to 2 times greater than that achieved by a single 4 or 8  mg/kg dose of cisplatin. <b>Tirapazamine</b> (25  mg/kg) administered 2. 5  h prior to cisplatin (4  mg/kg) resulted in a small increase in anti-tumour efficacy. AQ 4 N was also successful in enhancing the anti-tumour effect of cisplatin in the SCCVII and RIF- 1 murine tumour models. This resulted in an increased cell kill of greater than 3 logs in both models; this was a greater cell kill than that observed for <b>tirapazamine</b> with cisplatin. Combination of cisplatin with AQ 4 N or <b>tirapazamine</b> resulted in no additional bone marrow toxicity compared to cisplatin administered alone. In conclusion, AQ 4 N has the potential to improve the clinical efficacy of cisplatin. © 2001 Cancer Research Campaign [URL]...|$|E
40|$|AbstractTandem mass {{spectrometry}} methods {{were used to}} study the sites of protonation and for identification of 3 -amino- 1, 2, 4 -benzotriazine 1, 4 -dioxide (1, <b>tirapazamine),</b> and its metabolites (3 -amino- 1, 2, 4 -benzotriazine 1 -oxide (3), 3 -amino- 1, 2, 4 -benzotriazine 4 -oxide (4), 3 -amino- 1, 2, 4 -benzotriazine (5), and a related isomer 3 -amino- 1, 2, 4 -benzotriazine 2 -oxide (6). Fragmentation pathways of 3 and 5 indicated the 4 -N-atom as the most likely site of protonation. Among the N-oxides studied, the 4 -oxide (4) showed the highest degree of protonation at the oxygen atom. The differences in collision-induced dissociation of isomeric protonated 1 -, 2 - and 4 -oxides allowed for their identification by LC/MS/MS. Gas phase and liquid phase protonation of <b>tirapazamine</b> occurred exclusively at the oxygen in the 4 -position. A loss of OH radical from these ions (2 +) resulted in ionized 3. Neutralization-reionization {{mass spectrometry}} (NR MS) experiments demonstrated {{the stability of the}} neutral analogue of protonated <b>tirapazamine</b> in the gas phase in the μs time-frame. A significant portion of the neutral <b>tirapazamine</b> radicals (2) dissociated by loss of hydroxyl radical during the NR MS event, which indicates that previously proposed mechanisms for redox-activated DNA damage are reasonable. The activation energy for loss of hydroxyl radical from activated <b>tirapazamine</b> (2) was estimated to be ∼ 14 kcal mol− 1. Stable neutral analogues of [3 + H]+ and [5 + H]+ ions were also generated in the course of NR MS experiments. Structures of these radicals were assigned to the molecules having an extra hydrogen atom at one of the ring N-atoms. Quantum chemical calculations of protonated 1, 3, 4 and 5 and the corresponding neutrals were performed to assist in the interpretation of experimental results and to help identify their structures...|$|E
40|$|Dissertation[ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] Protein-tyrosine {{phosphatase}} 1 B (PTP 1 B) is {{a negative}} regulator in the insulin signaling cascade. A lot of {{research has focused on}} inhibiting PTP 1 B but with no success. Only one drug is currently in phase II clinical trials. We have developed a synthetic protocol to create a library of molecules that target residues outside the active site and covalently bind to the enzyme via close proximity alkylation. These molecules will be analyzed towards inactivation/inhibition capabilities. <b>Tirapazamine</b> is a hypoxia selective anti-cancer drug. New derivatives of <b>Tirapazamine</b> are sought after. We have analyzed and optimized Suzuki-Miyaura and Buchwald-Hartwig couplings reactions towards new derivatives of <b>Tirapazamine.</b> Allyl isothiocyanate (AITC) is a phytochemical that can be found in cruciferous vegetables and has received interest due to beneficial health effects. During our analyses of AITC towards inactivation of PTP 1 B we noticed the surprising absence of the isothiocyanate carbon in 13 C NMR spectra. Calculations show that the absence is due to the facile change of the N-hybridization in the wide range of 120 less than 180 bond angles in AITC...|$|E
40|$|The redox cycle {{triggered}} by one electron reduction of doxorubicin and <b>tirapazamine</b> - both anticancer agents - leads to superoxide production. This superoxide production itself removes one iron atom from the [4 Fe- 4 S] cluster, being an active center of aconitase. In addition, the incurred changes in cell redox equilibrium may affect lipid metabolism. The {{aim of the}} study was to evaluate a concomitant effect of both drugs on hepatic aconitase activity and triglycerides level. In our study, doxorubicin (1. 8 mg/kg b. w.) was administered intraperitoneal (i. p.) six times, once a week, within male Wistar rats, to achieve a cumulative dose of 10. 8 mg/kg b. w. Two hours before every doxorubicin administration, <b>tirapazamine</b> in the dose of either 5 or 10 mg/kg b. w. was also i. p. injected. A week after withdrawing drug administration, the liver was taken for biochemical analysis. Therein, an increase in aconitase activity and a decrease in triglycerides level was seen in all groups exposed to doxorubicin. Our work demonstrated that <b>tirapazamine</b> administration had no influence on both tested parameters, but its higher dose rate normalized aconitase activity affected by doxorubicin...|$|E
40|$|P 450 reductase (NADPH: {{cytochrome}} c (P 450) reductase, EC 1. 6. 2. 4) {{plays an}} important role in the reductive activation of the bioreductive drug <b>tirapazamine</b> (SR 4233). Thus, in a panel of human breast cancer cell lines, expression of P 450 reductase correlated with both the hypoxic toxicity and the metabolism of <b>tirapazamine</b> [Patterson et al (1995) Br J Cancer 72 : 1144 - 1150]. To examine this dependence in more detail, the MDA 231 cell line, which has the lowest activity of P 450 reductase in our breast cell line panel, was transfected with the human P 450 reductase cDNA. Isolated clones expressed a 78 -kDa protein, which was detected with anti-P 450 reductase antibody, and were shown to have up to a 53 -fold increase in activity of the enzyme. Using six stable transfected clones covering the 53 -fold range of activity of P 450 reductase, it was shown that the enzyme activity correlated directly with both hypoxic and aerobic toxicity of <b>tirapazamine,</b> and metabolism of the drug under hypoxic conditions. No metabolism was detected under aerobic conditions. For RSU 1069, toxicity was also correlated with P 450 reductase activity, but only under hypoxic conditions. Measurable activity of P 450 reductase was found in a selection of 14 primary human breast tumours. Activity covered an 18 -fold range, which was generally higher than that seen in cell lines but within the range of activity measured in the transfected clones. These results suggest that if breast tumours have significant areas of low oxygen tension, then they are likely to be highly sensitive to the cytotoxic action of <b>tirapazamine</b> and RSU 1069...|$|E
