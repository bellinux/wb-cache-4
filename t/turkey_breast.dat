25|$|Mezcal {{is highly}} varied, {{depending}} on the species of agave used, the fruits and herbs added during fermentation and the distillation process employed, creating subtypes with names such as de gusano, tobalá, pechuga, blanco, minero, cedrón, de alacran, creme de café and more. A special recipe for a specific mezcal type known as pechuga uses cinnamon, apple, plums, cloves, and other spices that is then distilled through chicken, duck, or <b>turkey</b> <b>breast.</b> It is made when the specific fruits used in the recipe are available, usually during November or December. Other variations flavor the mash with cinnamon, pineapple slices, red bananas, and sugar, each imparting a particular character to the mezcal. Most mezcal, however, is left untouched, allowing the flavors of the agave used to come forward.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Lactic acid {{bacteria}} (LAB) {{have been}} shown to be inhibitory toward various pathogenic bac-teria during refrigerated storage of ground beef samples and in subprimals. In this study, the effectiveness of a combination of 4 strains of Lactobacillus at reduc-ing Salmonella in turkey products was evaluated to im-prove the final safety of the product. <b>Turkey</b> <b>breasts</b> (hot and chilled) were inoculated with a 3 -strain Sal-monella cocktail (Typhimurium ATCC 14028, Enter-itidis PT 13 NVSL 96 – 18535, and Heidelberg 3347 - 1 Sheldon) and then treated with 1 × 106 cfu/cm 2 of a Lactobacillus-based intervention comprising NP 51, NP 35, NP 3, and NP 7 (Lactiguard, Nutrition Physiol-ogy Corp., kansas City, MO). The <b>turkey</b> <b>breasts</b> were stored at either 5 °C to simulate refrigerated storage and sampled on d 0, 1, 2, and 3 or at 37 °C to simulate hot carcass applications and sampled at h 0, 2, and 4. Ad-ditionally, ground turkey was inoculated with a 3 -strain Salmonella cocktail, treated with 1 × 106 cfu/g of the LAB intervention, and stored at 5 °C with sampling on d 0, 1, 2, and 3. The reduction of Salmonella in the <b>turkey</b> <b>breasts</b> stored at 5 °C treated with Lactobacillus was 2 log (P < 0. 05) compared with the control <b>turkey</b> <b>breasts</b> after d 2. Salmonella in the <b>turkey</b> <b>breasts</b> held at 37 °C was reduced by 1. 5 log (P < 0. 05) by h 2 and 2 log (P < 0. 05) by h 4. The Salmonella in the ground turkey held at 5 °C using the LAB exhibited a 2 log (P < 0. 05) reduction compared with the control after d 1. These results show that the addition of a Lactoba-cillus-based treatment in turkey products significantly reduces Salmonella during storage.

2500|$|There is {{a saying}} in Oaxaca, [...] "Para todo mal, mezcal, para todo bien, también" [...] (For {{everything}} bad, mezcal; for everything good, too.) Alcoholic and non alcoholic drinks (as well as food items) {{based on the}} maguey plant have been consumed {{in many parts of}} Mexico since early in the pre-Hispanic period. The tradition of the making of the distilled liquor called mezcal has been a strong tradition in the Oaxacan highlands since the colonial period. One reason for this is the quality and varieties of maguey grown here. Some varieties, such as espadín and arroquense are cultivated but one variety called tobalá is still made with wild maguey plants. It is made with the heart of the plant which is roasted in pits (giving the final product a smokey flavor) and is sometimes flavored with a chicken or <b>turkey</b> <b>breast</b> added to the mash. It is mezcal, not tequila, and may contain a [...] "worm," [...] which is really a larva that infests maguey plants.

A second study investigated the effect of tumbling time (1, 2, 4, 8, and 24 h) on the composition of extracted exudate. In Experi-ment 1, four thawed and halved <b>turkey</b> <b>breasts</b> were tumbled without vacuum at 15 rpm and 4. 4 C for 2 hr in an 11. 5 % salt solution at a brine to meat ratio of. 15 : 1 (w/w). Nontumbled halves served as controls. Three-inch (7. 6 -cm) cross-sectional samples were removed from the anterior lobe of each halved breast, individually ground, and analyzed in duplicate for vitamins using automated analytical methods. Losses were calculated as the difference between tumbled and nontumbled paired breast halves. Niacin concentrations in tissue were significantly affected by tumbling whereas no significant losses were found for B, and B 2. On a dry weight basis, tumbling caused vitamin tissue losses that averaged 2. 0, 5. 0, and 12 % for B,, B 2, and N, respectively. In extracted exudates, average dry weight vitamin levels were 3. 8, 1. 3, and 301 ug/g for B t, B 2, and N, respectively. The results of Experiment 2 demonstrate that maximum rate losses of vitamins and proteins from tissues occur during the first hour of tumbling...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Restriction {{of dietary}} {{phosphorus}} {{is a major}} aspect of patient care in those with renal disease. Restriction of dietary phosphorus is necessary to control for phosphate balance during both conservative therapy and dialysis treatment. The extra amount of phosphorus which is consumed {{as a result of}} phosphate-containing food additives is a real challenge for patients with renal disease and for dieticians because it represents a "hidden" phosphate load. The objective {{of this study was to}} measure phosphorus content in foods, common protein sources in particular, and comprised both those which included a listing of phosphate additives and those which did not. METHODS: Determinations of dry matter, nitrogen, total and soluble phosphate ions were carried out in 60 samples of foods, namely cooked ham, roast <b>breast</b> <b>turkey,</b> and roast <b>breast</b> chicken, of which, 30 were with declared phosphate additives and the other 30 similar items were without additives. RESULTS: Total phosphorus (290 ± 40 mg/ 100 g vs. 185 ± 23 mg/ 100 g, P <. 001) and soluble phosphorus (164 ± 25 mg/ 100 g vs. 100 ± 19 mg/ 100 g, P <. 001) content were higher in products containing additives than in foods without additives. No difference was detected between the 2 groups regarding dry matter (27. 2 ± 2. 0 g/ 100 g vs. 26. 7 ± 1. 9 g/ 100 g) or total nitrogen (3. 15 ± 0. 40 g/ 100 g vs. 3. 19 ± 0. 40 g/ 100 g). Consequently, phosphorus intake per gram of protein was much greater in the foods containing phosphorus additives (15. 0 ± 3. 1 mg/g vs. 9. 3 ± 0. 7 mg/g, P <. 001).

40|$|Background The second {{leading cause}} of death due to cancer in <b>Turkey</b> is <b>breast</b> cancer, which {{accounts}} for 24 &#x 0025; of female cancers. Aims: To determine the practices of nurses and midwives and their attitude toward breast self-examination (BSE). Setting and Design: The descriptive survey was conducted to determine the practices of nurses and midwives and their attitude toward BSE. It tried to cover the total population rather than sampling part of it. However, 15 nurses and midwives, where there were errors detected in their data coding papers, and who did not accept to join the study, were excluded from the study. A total of 80 nurses and midwives were included in the study group. Materials and Methods: This survey was carried out at the State Hospital, all Public Health Cabins, and Family Health Centers, in the rural area of Izmir, a city located in the western region of Turkey. The data was collected between 15 March and 1 April 2004. Statistical Analysis: The analysis included descriptive statistics, to examine the association between BSE and medical history, knowledge of BSE, and attitude toward BSE. Results: The results of the study indicated that 52 &#x 0025; of the sample performed BSE. Approximately 35 &#x 0025; of those who performed BSE reported that they acquired information regarding BSE during their work experience. A significant relationship was found between higher levels of work experience and BSE practice. Except for age, no significant relation was found between the sociodemographic factors and BSE practice. The sample showed a strong belief in the breast lump being the cause of breast cancer and it had a significant correlation with BSE practice. Conclusion: A positive correlation was found between nursing work experience and their practice alongside BSE medical professionals.
