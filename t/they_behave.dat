5|$|Kohlberg's {{scale is}} about how people justify {{behaviors}} and his stages are not a method of ranking how moral someone's behavior is. There should, however, be a correlation between how someone scores on the scale and how <b>they</b> <b>behave,</b> and the general hypothesis is that moral behaviour is more responsible, consistent and predictable from people at higher levels.|$|E
5|$|Many organosodium {{compounds}} {{have been}} prepared. Because {{of the high}} polarity of the C-Na bonds, <b>they</b> <b>behave</b> like sources of carbanions (salts with organic anions). Some well known derivatives include sodium cyclopentadienide (NaC5H5) and trityl sodium ((C6H5)3CNa). Because of the large size and very low polarising power of the Na+ cation, it can stabilize large, aromatic, polarisable radical anions, such as in sodium naphthalenide, Na+−, a strong reducing agent.|$|E
5|$|Under Lorentz boosts <b>they</b> <b>behave</b> differently, {{showing that}} the two vectors aren't {{separate}} physical objects. The electric and magnetic components mix. See the illustration on the right. The electromagnetic field tensor displays the manifestly covariant mathematical structure of the electromagnetic field. It has six independent components at an event.|$|E
25|$|Gas {{particle}} identity {{played no}} role in determining final pressure (<b>they</b> <b>behaved</b> as if their size was negligible).|$|R

5|$|Harmless watersnakes of {{the genus}} Nerodia are often mistaken for it. These are also semiaquatic, thick-bodied snakes with large heads that can be {{aggressive}} when provoked, but <b>they</b> <b>behave</b> differently. For example, watersnakes usually flee quickly into the water, while A. piscivorus often stands its ground with its threat display. In addition, watersnakes do not vibrate their tails when excited. A. piscivorus usually holds its head at an angle around 45° when swimming or crawling.|$|E
5|$|In other tables, {{lutetium}} and lawrencium {{are classified}} as the remaining members of group 3. In these tables, lutetium and lawrencium end (or sometimes succeed) the lanthanide and actinide series, respectively. Since the f-shell is nominally full in the ground state electron configuration for both of these metals, <b>they</b> <b>behave</b> most similarly to other period 6 and period 7 transition metals {{compared to the other}} lanthanides and actinides, and thus logically exhibit properties similar to those of scandium and yttrium. However, this resemblance in not unique to lutetium and lawrencium, but is common among all the late lanthanides and actinides.|$|E
5|$|Neptunocene, Np(C8H8)2, was {{synthesized}} in 1970 by reacting neptunium(IV) chloride with K2(C8H8). It is isomorphous to uranocene and plutonocene, and <b>they</b> <b>behave</b> chemically identically: {{all three}} compounds are insensitive to water or dilute bases but {{are sensitive to}} air, reacting quickly to form oxides, and are only slightly soluble in benzene and toluene. Other known neptunium cyclooctatetraenyl derivatives include Np(RC8H7)2 (R = ethanol, butanol) and KNp(C8H8)·2THF, which is isostructural to the corresponding plutonium compound. In addition, neptunium hydrocarbyls have been prepared, and solvated triiodide complexes of neptunium are a precursor to many organoneptunium and inorganic neptunium compounds.|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes, I {{heard that}} <b>they</b> <b>behaved</b> shamefully, O'Grady; still, I think a corporal's guard {{would hardly be}} {{sufficient}} to turn them, but I do believe that a regiment might answer the purpose." ...|$|R
5000|$|When {{interviewed by}} UK {{newspaper}} The Observer, Rinnan explained: [...] "A delegation of five men {{came up to}} the bridge. <b>They</b> <b>behaved</b> aggressively and told us to go to Australia. They said they had nothing to lose." ...|$|R
5|$|Other organothorium {{compounds}} are not well-studied. Tetrabenzylthorium, Th(CH2C6H5), and tetraallylthorium, Th(C3H5)4, are known, {{but their}} structures {{have not been}} determined and they decompose slowly at room temperature. Thorium forms the monocapped trigonal prismatic anion 3−, heptamethylthorate, which forms the salt 3 (tmeda = Me2NCH2CH2NMe2). Although one methyl group is only attached to the thorium atom (Th–C distance 257.1pm) and the other six connect the lithium and thorium atoms (Th–C distances 265.5–276.5pm) <b>they</b> <b>behave</b> equivalently in solution. Tetramethylthorium, Th(CH3)4, is not known, but its adducts are stabilised by phosphine ligands.|$|E
5|$|Typical {{metalloids}} have {{a metallic}} appearance, {{but they are}} brittle and only fair conductors of electricity. Chemically, <b>they</b> <b>behave</b> mostly as nonmetals. They can form alloys with metals. Most of their other {{physical and chemical properties}} are intermediate in nature. Metalloids are usually too brittle to have any structural uses. They and their compounds are used in alloys, biological agents, catalysts, flame retardants, glasses, optical storage and optoelectronics, pyrotechnics, semiconductors, and electronics.|$|E
5|$|Irreversible {{competitive}} antagonists also involve {{competition between}} the agonist and antagonist of the receptor, but the rate of covalent bonding differs and depends on affinity and reactivity of the antagonist. For some antagonist, {{there may be a}} distinct period during which <b>they</b> <b>behave</b> competitively (regardless of basal efficacy), and freely associate to and dissociate from the receptor, determined by receptor-ligand kinetics. But, once irreversible bonding has taken place, the receptor is deactivated and degraded. As for non-competitive antagonists and irreversible antagonists in functional assays with irreversible competitive antagonist drugs, there may be a shift in the log concentration–effect curve to the right, but, in general, both a decrease in slope and a reduced maximum are obtained.|$|E

6000|$|... "And our allies," [...] she asked, and {{now that}} little catch in her throat was more marked, [...] "the British troops? [...] . . . We heard that <b>they</b> <b>behaved</b> like heroes, and bore the brunt of this awful battle." ...|$|R
60|$|As was Jim Scroggles, so {{were most}} of the other men. Hence they grumbled a good deal at their luckless condition. But upon the whole they were pretty cheerful--especially at meal-times--and, {{considering}} their circumstances, <b>they</b> <b>behaved</b> very well.|$|R
5|$|The way demons behave {{is based}} on their and the protagonist's {{respective}} alignments. Alignments come in two types, Light-Neutral-Dark, and Law-Neutral-Chaos. A demon's alignment can range across both alignments, resulting in nine possible stances that affect how <b>they</b> <b>behave</b> and what actions in battle or story progression pleases them. The protagonist's alignment changes depending on choices made during the story, and in response the attitudes of people and demons change; for instance, demons who are law-aligned will refuse to form an alliance with chaos-aligned players. Additionally, depending on their alignment, players will not be let into certain areas; for instance, the Order of Messiah will not let chaos-aligned players into their churches.|$|E

25|$|Unicode {{supports}} all {{of these}} types of writing systems through its numerous scripts. Unicode also adds further properties to characters to help differentiate the various characters and the ways <b>they</b> <b>behave</b> within Unicode text processing algorithms.|$|E

40|$|The {{immunological}} {{properties of}} the submandibular kallikrein, urinary kallikrein, pancreatic kallikrein and pancreatic prekallikrein of the rat were studied by immunodiffusion, immunoelectrophoresis and radioimmunoassay. Although <b>they</b> <b>behaved</b> differently electrophoretically, all the antigens showed identical immunological behaviour. The implications of this are discussed...|$|R

25|$|Adult {{stem cells}} can, however, be artificially reverted {{to a state}} where <b>they</b> <b>behave</b> like {{embryonic}} stem cells (including the associated DNA repair mechanisms). This was done with mice as early as 2006 with future prospects to slow down human aging substantially. Such cells {{are one of the}} various classes of induced stem cells.|$|E
25|$|Fugacity {{coefficients}} are dimensionless and can {{be obtained}} experimentally at specific temperature and pressure, from measurements of deviations from ideal gas behaviour. Equilibrium constants are {{defined in terms of}} fugacity. If the gases are at sufficiently low pressure that <b>they</b> <b>behave</b> as ideal gases, the equilibrium constant can be defined as a quotient of partial pressures.|$|E
25|$|The {{other point}} of view is geometrical. One can {{explicitly}} construct the spinors, and then examine how <b>they</b> <b>behave</b> under the action of the relevant Lie groups. This latter approach has the advantage of providing a concrete and elementary description of what a spinor is. However, such a description becomes unwieldy when complicated properties of spinors, such as Fierz identities, are needed.|$|E
50|$|Excepting the Greco-Iberian alphabet, and to {{a lesser}} extent the Tartessian (southwestern) script, Paleoiberian scripts shared a {{distinctive}} typology: <b>They</b> <b>behaved</b> as a syllabary for the plosives and as an alphabet for the rest of consonants. This unique writing system has been called a semi-syllabary.|$|R
5000|$|On {{the last}} day of the trial, the Crown and defence team made their closing {{arguments}} to the judge.

25|$|An {{important}} aspect {{is the relationship}} between the Schrödinger equation and wavefunction collapse. In the oldest Copenhagen interpretation, particles follow the Schrödinger equation except during wavefunction collapse, during which <b>they</b> <b>behave</b> entirely differently. The advent of quantum decoherence theory allowed alternative approaches (such as the Everett many-worlds interpretation and consistent histories), wherein the Schrödinger equation is always satisfied, and wavefunction collapse should be explained {{as a consequence of the}} Schrödinger equation.|$|E
25|$|Scholarly {{research}} on jury behavior in American non-capital criminal felony trials reveals that juror outcomes appear {{to track the}} opinions of the median juror, rather than {{the opinions of the}} extreme juror on the panel, although juries were required to render unanimous verdicts in the jurisdictions studied. Thus, although juries must render unanimous verdicts, in run-of-the-mill criminal trials <b>they</b> <b>behave</b> in practice as if they were operating using a majority rules voting system.|$|E
25|$|The {{theory of}} {{psychological}} pricing is controversial. Some {{studies show that}} buyers, even young children, have a very sophisticated understanding of true cost and relative value and that, {{to the limits of}} the accuracy of the test, <b>they</b> <b>behave</b> rationally. Other researchers claim that this ignores the non-rational nature of the phenomenon and that acceptance of the theory requires belief in a subconscious level of thought processes, a belief that economic models tend to deny or ignore. Results from research using modern scanner data are mixed.|$|E
