25|$|Early in 1934, three {{priests and}} two laypeople {{were taken out}} of their special regime Kolyma camp to the local OGPU administration.

25|$|When Benson was {{informed}} of the league's findings, he called in Payton and Loomis and ordered the program shut down immediately. However, <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>do</b> so. Loomis had been interviewed during the 2010 investigation as well, and had stated that he knew of no such scheme and would stop it immediately if it was taking place. The league also found that Vitt, whom Payton had assigned to monitor Williams (the two reportedly didn't get along very well), also knew about the broader lines of the scheme and even witnessed Williams handing out payments to players. However, Vitt failed to tell anyone about it.|$|E
25|$|Hoping {{to break}} a {{stalemate}} at Monte Cassino, the Allies landed {{on the coast of}} Italy at Nettuno, ancient Antium, which was midway between Ostia and Terracina. They found that the place was undefended. They intended to move along the line of the via Appia to take Rome, outflanking Monte Cassino, but <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>do</b> so quickly enough. The Germans occupied Mounts Laziali and Lepini along the track of the old Via Latina, from which they rained down shells on Anzio. Even though the Allies expanded into all the Pomptine region, they gained no ground. The Germans counterattacked down the via Appia from the Alban hills in a front four miles wide, but could not retake Anzio. The battle lasted for four months, one side being supplied by sea, the other by land through Rome. In May 1944, the Allies broke out of Anzio and took Rome. The German forces escaped to the north of Florence.|$|E

25|$|Shawn Layden {{formally}} reintroduced The Last Guardian at {{the beginning}} of Sony's E3 2015 conference. Sony affirmed that that game was now slated for release on the PlayStation 4 with a 2016 release date. Sony also assured fans that Ueda still remained a main developer of the game despite his prior departure from Sony. According to Chris Plante of Polygon, the gameplay presented shows the same gameplay from previous demos, where the young boy and the large creature work together to solve various platforming puzzles. The presentation at the 2015 E3 was based on the milestone of the game being fully playable, affirmed by selected members of the press, though Yoshida stated <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>do</b> a live gameplay demo as the artificial intelligence behavior of the animal creature could be sporadic and impact the demonstration. Ueda said that the fundamentals of the gameplay had not changed from the original PlayStation 3 version to the PlayStation 4, only that with the more-powerful PlayStation 4, they were able to put more detail into the characters and the environment.|$|E
25|$|Italian Prime Minister Benito Mussolini had {{imperial}} ambitions in Abyssinia. Italy {{was already}} in possession of neighboring Eritrea and Somalia. In December 1934 there was a clash between Italian and Abyssinian troops at Walwal, near the border between British and Italian Somaliland, in which Italian troops took possession of the disputed territory and in which 150 Abyssinians and 50 Italians were killed. When Italy demanded apologies and compensation from Abyssinia, Abyssinia appealed to the League, Emperor Haile Selassie famously appealing in person to the assembly in Geneva. The League persuaded both sides to seek a settlement under the Italo-Ethiopian Treaty of 1928 but Italy continued troop movements and Abyssinia appealed to the League again. In October 1935 Mussolini launched an attack on Abyssinia. The League declared Italy to be the aggressor and imposed sanctions, but coal and oil were not included; blocking these, it was thought, would provoke war. Albania, Austria and Hungary refused to apply sanctions; Germany and the United States {{were not in the}} League. Nevertheless, the Italian economy suffered. The League considered closing off the Suez Canal also, which would have stopped arms to Abyssinia, but, thinking it would be too harsh a measure, <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>do</b> so.|$|E

She pointed to later movies, such as Mamma Mia!, 27 Dresses (written by McKenna) and Me Before You, that appeared to her to be trying to replicate The Devil Wears Pradas success with that demographic. However, Gabler feels <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>do</b> so as well. [...] "Prada reminds me of movies that we don't have a lot of now—it harkens back to classic movies that had so much more than just one kind of plot line ...

500|$|In South Vietnam, {{where the}} Buddhist {{majority}} {{was estimated to}} comprise between 70 and 90 {{percent of the population}} in 1963, President Ngô Đình Diệm's pro-Catholic policies antagonized many Buddhists. A member of the Catholic minority, his government was biased towards Catholics in public service and military promotions, {{as well as in the}} allocation of land, business favors and tax concessions. Diệm once told a high-ranking officer, forgetting the man was from a Buddhist background, [...] "Put your Catholic officers in sensitive places. They can be trusted." [...] Many officers in the ARVN had converted to Catholicism in the belief that their career prospects depended on it, and many were refused promotion if <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>do</b> so. Additionally, the distribution of firearms to village self-defense militias intended to repel Việt Cộng guerrillas was done so that weapons were only given to Catholics. Some Catholic priests ran private armies, and in some areas forced conversions; looting, shelling and demolition of pagodas occurred. Some Buddhist villages converted en masse to receive aid or avoid being forcibly resettled by Diem's regime.|$|E

500|$|Goergen {{found the}} sound design unmemorable, {{saying that the}} music does not add much and that players {{would be likely to}} mute the game after hearing the [...] "beeping" [...] sound effect used for {{dialogue}} for too long. Meanwhile, Ponce and Petit liked it: Ponce called the score [...] "masterful" [...] and said that it [...] "gets under your skin at the right moments", while Petit said that she appreciated the sound, which she called atmospheric and [...] " [...] shivers up your spine". She was unimpressed with the environments, but said that they were clear and easy to look at. She liked the character portraits, calling them expressive and, paired with the dialogue, enough to make the player not care about the lack of voice acting. Ponce, too, felt that the game did not need voice acting. He felt that the way the game favored textual narration over animated cutscenes made it more immersive, allowing the player to imagine the scenes. Goergen said that the graphics were well done, but that <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>do</b> much for the atmosphere. Kaplan called the presentation [...] "awesome", saying that it looked great and that the artwork stood on its own despite the simplicity of the animations, and that the soundtrack was [...] "fantastic".|$|E
