25|$|The Reading Company {{was forced}} to file for {{bankruptcy}} protection in 1971.

25|$|Each MC firm {{independently}} {{sets the}} terms of exchange for its product. The firm gives no consideration to what effect its decision may have on competitors. The theory is that any action will have such a negligible effect on the overall market demand that an MC firm can act without fear of prompting heightened competition. In other words, each firm feels free <b>to</b> <b>set</b> <b>prices</b> {{as if it were}} a monopoly rather than an oligopoly.|$|E

25|$|After forming {{partnerships}} with multinational corporations such as Sprint, ITT and Telenor, these firms now offer the cheapest and clearest phone calls in Africa. These Somali telecommunication companies also {{provide services to}} every city, town and hamlet in Somalia. There are presently around 25 mainlines per 1,000 persons, and the local availability of telephone lines (tele-density) is higher than in neighbouring countries; three times greater than in adjacent Ethiopia. Prominent Somali telecommunications companies include Golis Telecom Group, Hormuud Telecom, Somafone, Nationlink, Netco, Telcom and Somali Telecom Group. Hormuud Telecom alone grosses about $40 million a year.

25|$|The Water and Sanitation Services Law No. 2029 of 1999, was revised in 2000 after Cochabamba’s water war into Law No. 2066. The new law {{includes}} {{provisions for}} protection of traditional water-sharing arrangements through {{a system of}} official licenses and increase local communities participation in decision making processes such as the establishment of water tariffs. The , (Superintendencia de Agua y Saneamiento Basico) which grants concessions and licenses and establishes the principles <b>to</b> <b>set</b> <b>prices,</b> tariffs, taxes, and quotas, was not modified by the new Law. The Government of Evo Morales considers passing a new water and sanitation services law called “Water for Life”. According to Vice-Minister Rene Orellana, this new legal framework would eliminate the SISAB and introduce a decentralized regulator in its place. Regulatory taxes would be eliminated along with the legal concept of the concession. A preferential electricity tariff would be introduced for EPSAs and community water rights would be strengthened.|$|E

2500|$|There {{are many}} firms in each MC product group and many firms {{on the side}} lines {{prepared}} to enter the market. A product group is a [...] "collection of similar products".

For example, a firm could cut prices and increase sales without fear that its actions will prompt retaliatory responses from competitors.|$|E
2500|$|In 1069, Wang Anshi, whose {{ideas were}} similar to the modern welfare state, became chancellor. Believing that the state must provide for the people, and pressed by the need for {{revenues}} to wage an irredentist war against the Xi Xia and Liao, he initiated a series of reforms. These reforms included nationalising industries such as tea, salt and liquor, and adopting a policy of directly transporting goods in abundance in one region to another, which Wang believed would {{eliminate the need for}} merchants. Other policies included a rural credit program for peasants, the replacement of corvee labour with a tax, lending peasants military horses for use in peacetime, compulsory military training for civilians, and a [...] "market exchange bureau" [...] <b>to</b> <b>set</b> <b>prices.</b> These policies were extremely controversial, especially to Orthodox Confucians who favoured laissez faire, and were largely repealed after Wang Anshi's death, except during the reign of Emperor Huizong.|$|E
