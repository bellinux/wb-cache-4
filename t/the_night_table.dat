The head chambermaid felt unequal to the perplexities of the spectacle and summoned her most convenient friend, the head chambermaid on the third floor, to her aid. The first-floor waiter joined their deliberations and several housemaids displayed a respectful interest in the matter. Finally they invoked the manager.

Bernheim discovered that if he gave a subject a suggestion to return to him at ten o'clock in 13 days while under hypnosis, the subject would show up at the exact time Bernheim had suggested. The subject showed no recollection of receiving a suggestion, and stated that the [...] "idea presented itself to his mind only at the moment at which he was required to execute it." [...] In Bernheim's Latent Memories and Long-Term Suggestions, he proposed that post-hypnotic suggestions were a result of his subjects periodically falling into a hypnotic state and remembering the suggestions they received from him while previously under hypnosis. Below is a description of one of his experiments on post-hypnotic suggestion."To one, I tell her during her sleep:—"Next Thursday (in five days) you will take the glass that is on <b>the</b> <b>night</b> <b>table</b> {{and put it in the}} suitcase that is at the foot of your bed." [...] Three days later, having put her back to sleep, I say to her: [...] "Do you remember what I ordered you to do?" [...] She answers: [...] "Yes, I must put the glass in my suitcase Thursday morning, at eight o'clock."—"Have you thought about it since I told you?"—"No"—"Think hard."—"I thought about it the following morning at eleven o'clock."—"Were you awake or asleep?"—"I was in a drowsy state." [...] (Bernheim, 1886a, pp. 109-110)"Bernheim theorized that memories of suggestions subjects received under hypnosis were not unconscious, instead they were latent, or dorminant until it is revived when the subject drifts into a hypnotic state.|$|E
5000|$|Unfortunately, Fay ends up kissing Muscles {{at the end}} of the song. Itchy has {{a jealous}} fight with Muscles over Fay. She breaks up the fight. Chick returns to {{apologize}} to Pinky though there still is a great deal of tension between the two of them. Fay passes drinks to around to the fighting men and tells them just to get along for tonight ("Everybody Love Everybody"). When Teddy's name is called over the P.A. to come and get her long distance call, Pinky convinces Chick to sing to Teddy. Swallowing his drink, he does ("Wish You Were Here" [...] ). Teddy enters the scene and sees Chick though the two don't speak. Gussie quickly laps up Chick when he finishes singing and Pinky tries to get Teddy drunk and take her back to his cabin. Before anything more happens, it starts raining and everyone runs for cover. Teddy stops by Pinky's cabin ostensibly to pick up an umbrella, but he has other ideas. He spikes Teddy's drink and attempts to take advantage of her ("Relax"). Itchy comes over to talk with Pinky and a panicked Teddy hides in the bathroom while Pinky attempts to get rid of Itchy. By the time Itchy leaves, Teddy has emerged from the bathroom with an empty glass wearing the sexy dress she won in the beauty contest. Chick enters the bunk with Teddy's engagement ring, and finding her there, attempts to force the ring on her finger. If she's engaged, she should act like it. She tells him to mind his own business. He puts the ring on <b>the</b> <b>night</b> <b>table</b> and leaves. Pinky prepares to take her to bed; unfortunately, while he's in the bathroom getting changed, she falls asleep. Pinky, not knowing what else to do, slips the engagement ring on Teddy's hand. The next morning outside the social hall, Herman has come to bring Teddy home. No one seems to know where Teddy is, and Herman is not too happy about this. Itchy and Marvin also bemoan the fact that their girlfriends are nowhere to be found. They then realize that the girls have spent the whole night dancing to Be-Bop records in the music library. Fay and some of the other kids enter dancing like [...] "cool cats" [...] ("Where Did the Night Go? - Be-bop Version"). Muscles takes the guests off to play basketball, and Teddy enters, finding Herman. It appears that even though nothing happened between Teddy and Pinky, Pinky is out accepting congratulations for his conquest. Even though Herman shouldn't accept Teddy's behavior, he is ready to forgive and forget. He wants to take Teddy back to New York where the two can get married. Her goes to get the car. Itchy returns to tell everyone that he's been fired form his job as Boat Boy, too. He forgot to tie up the boats last night during the storm and they all floated away. Teddy spots Chick escorting a new girl to her cabin and informs him that she's leaving. He's aloof, but polite. Itchy, overhearing the conversation, chastises Teddy for not putting up a fight. Chick doesn't even know the truth about what happened between her and Pinky. Itchy wants her to go over to the big camp basketball game and make Pinky, the referee, tell the truth. Teddy is flattered that Itchy cares so much. His kind words really give her a lift. And she returns the sentiment in kind ("Flattery"). She agrees to go to the game. In the game, the camp team (led by Muscles) plays the waiter team (led by Chick). Itchy arrives and disrupts the game so badly that Muscles declares the game officially over. Teddy confronts Pinky and asks him why he's telling everyone she succumbed to him last night. He claims that he did no such thing; however, the rest of the camp is having a great time insinuating that Teddy is now a loose woman. Pinky resists because he doesn't want to tarnish his reputation, but Fay gets him to tell the truth. Herman hears this and is relieved. Teddy gives a kiss to Chick and gets in the car and leaves with Herman. It's obvious that she doesn't want to go, but Chick does nothing to stop her. Muscles, frustrated with the interruption of his game, quits on the spot. Kandel panics! Who's going to run the camp? Itchy, of course! Itchy immediately organizes everyone to dance. Suddenly, Herman re-enters with two suitcases, which he lays down. Teddy runs to Chick and falls into his arms. Before Herman goes, however, he gives Chick the engagement ring, which Chick slips on Teddy's finger ("Wish You Were Here - Reprise").|$|E

40|$|Introduction: In 2016 NHS England’s {{specialised}} services {{announced that they}} will routinely commission sodium oxybate for symptom control in post-pubertal children with narcolepsy with cataplexy. In adults with narcolepsy, sodium oxybate {{has been shown to}} increase slow wave sleep (SWS) and delta power and subsequently improve daytime symptoms. As part of a larger descriptive study called ‘The Paediatric Narcolepsy Project’, we aimed to investigate the differences in sleep architecture between children with narcolepsy treated with sodium oxybate and healthy gender and aged matched controls. Methods: 23 children with narcolepsy (age: 8 - 15 years) and 23 healthy gender and age-matched controls were recruited. From this sample, four children with narcolepsy treated with sodium oxybate (age: 10 - 15 years) and their matched controls were selected. Children underwent home polysomnography (PSG) using a portable PSG system (Embla® Systems). A standard montage was used to measure sleep architecture with nine EEG channels (F 3, F 4, C 3, Cz, C 4, O 1, O 2, M 1, M 2), two electro-oculography and two electromyography channels. All children were set up in their own homes and medication was taken as usual. Results: All children with narcolepsy were taking sodium oxybate twice in <b>the</b> <b>night.</b> <b>Table</b> 1 displays the differences in SWS, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, total sleep time and arousal frequency between the children with narcolepsy and the controls. All of the children with narcolepsy spent more time in SWS than the controls. Three of the children with narcolepsy spent less time in REM sleep than the controls. The hypnograms visually look more disrupted in the children with narcolepsy vs the matched controls (Figure 1). Discussion: This research suggests that sodium oxybate has an effect on the normal cycling of sleep stages in children. Further work is needed to examine the impact of the changes to the sleep hypnogram in a larger sample size...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{increasing}} {{importance of}} aging at home opens new perspectives to technicians {{who are able}} to propose and implement adapted technical solutions which compensate the handicaps and delay the loss of autonomy. In this regional background, the Limousin's Chamber of Craft Trades has created the Innovation Pole for health, autonomy and trades (CNISAM). The CNISAM is an Innovation Pole (a label granted by the French government). It aims to be a resource centre capable of identifying solutions adapted to the needs of small enterprises, and of coaching them in their development process through technologies and innovation. The CNISAM helps the craftsmen to integrate sanitary, social and statutory environmental aspects in their professional practices, especially in the design of housing environment and installation of home automation equipments. One of its roles is also to work on the design of adaptable and intelligent assistive furniture through the use of ICT and home automation technologies. In this frame, three furniture projects are under consideration: a "smart" bedside table, a bed for child under three years suitable for parents with disabilities, and a closet/dressing increased with home automation functionalities. Both physical disabilities and their potential evolutions are considered. This furniture is meant to be prototypes which will inspire designers and carpenters in making furniture for people with disabilities. In addition, this furniture is designed for the public market and must not be based on the furniture that can be found in professional health institutes. As an example, the first project deals with the design of a bedside table which purpose is to make life easier for disabled people during the night. Compared to a conventional bedside table, the prototype will integrate a backlight that will illuminate <b>the</b> <b>night</b> <b>table</b> at the touch of the user to help him locate things on the table (water bottle, glasses [...] .) during the night. The prototype will also be able to communicate with different equipments (roller shutters, heating, lighting, light paths [...] .).

The bottom drawer is accessible for wheelchair users through a system of enhanced raised drawer. An integrated automated pillbox will guide the user in taking his medications and treatments...|$|E
