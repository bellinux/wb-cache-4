5|$|The {{poisonous}} pitohuis, {{including the}} hooded pitohui, are not thought {{to create the}} toxic compound themselves but instead sequester them from their diet. Phyllobates frogs kept in captivity do not develop <b>the</b> <b>toxins,</b> {{and the extent of}} the toxicity varies both in the pitohuis across their range and also across the range of the unrelated blue-capped ifrit, another New Guinean bird found with toxic skin and feathers. Both of these facts suggest that <b>the</b> <b>toxins</b> are obtained from the diet. The presence of <b>the</b> <b>toxins</b> in the internal organs as well as the skins and feathers rules out the possibility that <b>the</b> <b>toxins</b> are applied topically from an unknown source by the birds.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Lysosomotropic amines, such as {{ammonium}} chloride, {{are known}} to protect cells from the cytotoxic effects of diphtheria toxin.

The cytotoxic effects of diphtheria toxin were not inhibited by antitoxin when cells were preincubated at 37 °C with toxin and ammonium chloride, exposed to antitoxin at 4 ° C, washed to relieve the ammonium chloride inhibition, and finally warmed to 37 °C.

40|$|The {{effect of}} Helminthosporium maydis race T toxin on {{electron}} transport in susceptible cytoplasmic male-sterile Texas corn (Zea mays L.) mitochondria was investigated, using dichlorophenol indophenol and ferricyanide as electron acceptors. Succinate-dependent electron transport was stimulated by <b>the</b> <b>toxin,</b> consistent with <b>the</b> well described increase in membrane permeability induced by <b>the</b> <b>toxin.</b> Malate-dependent electron transport was inhibited. This inhibition of electron transport increased {{as a function}} of time of exposure to <b>the</b> <b>toxin.</b> Mitochondria from normal-fertile (N) corn were not affected by <b>the</b> <b>toxin.</b> Both <b>the</b> inhibition of electron transport and the increase in ion permeability, such as dissipation of membrane potential and Ca 2 + gradients, induced by <b>the</b> <b>toxin</b> in T corn was prevented by N,N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, a hydrophobic carbodiimide. A water-soluble carbodiimide, 1 -ethyl- 3 -(3 -dimethylaminopropyl) -carbodiimide, was ineffective in preventing dissipation of membrane potential by <b>the</b> <b>toxin.</b> These results suggest that <b>the</b> various <b>toxin</b> actions are mediated via interaction of <b>the</b> <b>toxin</b> with one target site, most probably a 13 kilodalton polypeptide unique to T mitochondria.

5|$|Amatoxins {{consist of}} at least eight {{compounds}} with a similar structure, that of eight amino-acid rings; of those found in A. ocreata, α-amanitin is the most prevalent and along with β-amanitin {{is likely to be}} responsible for the toxic effects. The major toxic mechanism is the inhibition of RNA polymerase II, a vital enzyme in the synthesis of messenger RNA (mRNA), microRNA, and small nuclear RNA (snRNA). Without mRNA, essential protein synthesis and hence cell metabolism stop and the cell dies.

5|$|Bacteria {{used for}} {{biological}} control infect insects via their digestive tracts, so they offer only limited options for controlling insects with sucking mouth parts such as aphids and scale insects. Bacillus thuringiensis {{is the most}} widely applied species of bacteria used for biological control, with at least four sub-species used against Lepidopteran (moth, butterfly), Coleopteran (beetle) and Dipteran (true fly) insect pests. The bacterium is available to organic farmers in sachets of dried spores which are mixed with water and sprayed onto vulnerable plants such as brassicas and fruit trees. Genes from B. thuringiensis have also been incorporated into transgenic crops, making the plants express some of the bacterium's toxins, which are proteins. These confer resistance to insect pests and thus reduce the necessity for pesticide use. If pests develop resistance to <b>the</b> <b>toxins</b> in these crops, B. thuringiensis will become useless in organic farming also.|$|E
5|$|Iridomyrmex {{primarily}} {{feeds on}} sweet {{foods such as}} nectar and honeydew. They hunt for insects and other ants to feed to their young, and workers are particularly attracted to seeds with elaiosomes. They collect these seeds, remove the elaiosomes, and then discard the seeds. The seedlings that sprout from these seeds benefit from proximity to the aggressive Iridomyrmex ants, giving them {{a better chance of}} survival. Colonies sometimes nest in termite mounds, and so the termites are regularly preyed on by Iridomyrmex; no evidence for any kind of relationship (other than a predatory one) is known. Juvenile cane toads are often preyed on, as certain Iridomyrmex species such as I. purpureus and I. ruburrus are immune to <b>the</b> <b>toxins</b> released by the cane toads. As a result, placing Iridomyrmex nests in habitats which house cane toads have been suggested as a method of controlling the cane toad population.

50|$|Botulinum toxin exerts {{its effect}} by {{cleaving}} key proteins required for nerve activation. First, <b>the</b> <b>toxin</b> binds specifically to nerves which use the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. Once {{bound to the}} nerve terminal, the neuron takes up <b>the</b> <b>toxin</b> into a vesicle. As the vesicle moves farther into the cell, it acidifies, activating a portion of <b>the</b> <b>toxin</b> which triggers it to push across the vesicle membrane and into the cell cytoplasm. Once inside <b>the</b> cytoplasm, <b>the</b> <b>toxin</b> cleaves SNARE proteins preventing the cell from releasing vesicles of neurotransmitter. This stops nerve signaling, leading to paralysis.|$|R
50|$|Botulinum toxin {{produced}} by Clostridium botulinum {{is the cause}} of botulism.

5|$|Meat ants {{are able}} to kill {{poisonous}} cane toads, an introduced pest, as <b>the</b> <b>toxins</b> exuded by toad, that usually kill the cane toad's predators, do not affect the meat ants. Due to this, scientists in Australia have considered using meat ants {{as a form of}} pest control to reduce the cane toad population. One way of doing this is by establishing meat ant nests in habitats where cane toad numbers are high. In rural Australia, meat ants are important to farmers, who place animal carcasses on ant nests to get rid of them. In a matter of weeks, the entire carcass is consumed and reduced to bones. Due to the meat ants aggression, workers will pour out of entrance holes to attack if a human or animal disturbs their nest.|$|E

None of the antidotes used have undergone prospective, randomized clinical trials, and only anecdotal support is available. Silibinin and N-acetylcysteine appear to be the therapies with the most potential benefit. Repeated doses of activated carbon may be helpful by absorbing any toxins returned to the gastrointestinal tract following enterohepatic circulation.

The German physician and naturalist Georg Heinrich von Langsdorff wrote the earliest published account on how to detoxify this mushroom in 1823. In the late 19th century, the French physician Félix Archimède Pouchet was a populariser and advocate of A.muscaria consumption, comparing it to manioc, an important food source in tropical South America that must be detoxified before consumption.|$|E

5|$|Meat ants {{are among}} the very few native species of Australia that are not harmed by <b>the</b> <b>toxins</b> of the cane toad, an {{invasive}} species. Most of the time, foraging workers target metamorph toads. Observations show that workers would forage around ponds and seize any toadlet. This normally starts with a single worker making contact with an individual and tracing its movements, followed by three or four workers capturing it. All the participating ants would grab a limb and sever the legs, returning the prey item back to their nest. Most of the time these tactics do not work. For example, most toadlets are able to escape the ants by displaying aversion-like behaviour; an individual may escape by struggling erratically or forcing the ants to release their grip by returning to the water. This aversion behaviour leads to most toadlets remaining in the water or staying on objects such as water lilies, pieces of bark that the ants cannot access, or moving around on moist substrates. It is unknown if meat ant predation on the toadlets affected the population, but based on the population density of the toadlets within the studied site and the foraging time and efficiency, approximately 2,700 toadlets could be removed per day. As the toadlet population density is extremely high, the impact of meat ant predation is minor. However, the survivability of the toadlets may be affected if the ants prevent the toadlets from foraging into many areas of moist substrate.|$|E
