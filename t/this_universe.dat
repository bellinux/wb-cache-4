5|$|Many of Poe's conclusions, however, are {{speculative}} {{due to his}} {{rejection of}} analytic logic and emphasis on intuition and inspiration. Further, Eureka contains many scientific errors. In particular, Poe's suggestions opposed Newtonian principles regarding the density and rotation of planets. He also says that Johannes Kepler came to his conclusions not through science but through guesswork. For this reason, {{it has been suggested}} that what Poe demands is true in Eureka is not actually about <b>this</b> <b>universe,</b> but a parallel fictitious one Poe creates. If this is the case, as interpreted by poet Richard Wilbur, Poe is criticizing this world, suggesting it has fallen away from God by elevating scientific reason above poetic intuition.|$|E
5|$|Single-sensed souls, however, called nigoda, and element-bodied souls pervade all {{tiers of}} <b>this</b> <b>universe.</b> Nigodas are souls {{at the bottom}} end of the existential hierarchy. They are so tiny and undifferentiated, that they lack even {{individual}} bodies, living in colonies. According to Jain texts, this infinity of nigodas {{can also be found}} in plant tissues, root vegetables and animal bodies. Depending on its karma, a soul transmigrates and reincarnates within the scope of this cosmology of destinies. The four main destinies are further divided into sub-categories and still smaller sub–sub categories. In all, Jain texts speak of a cycle of 8.4 million birth destinies in which souls find themselves again and again as they cycle within samsara.|$|E
5|$|The game {{takes place}} within the fictional {{universe}} in which prior Traveller releases are also set. The most significant power in <b>this</b> <b>universe</b> is the human-dominated Imperium which predominates across thousands of inhabited solar systems. Bordering the regions controlled by the Imperium are other interstellar powers including the Zhodani Consulate. The Imperium and the Zhodani {{have a long history}} of tense relations and, as the game begins, rumors of another frontier war are circulating. Against this backdrop, a security agent working for Sharushid, a large corporation active throughout the Imperium, discovers that a company sub-sector chief named Konrad Kiefer is secretly aiding the Zhodani by smuggling arms across the border into the hands of dissidents in preparation for an uprising within the Imperium to be coordinated with a Zhodani attack. This security agent encounters five experienced adventurers in a bar on the planet Efate and entrusts them with evidence of Kiefer's treachery. These adventurers are tasked with delivering the evidence to a second Sharushid agent located in another solar system and ultimately with stopping Kiefer and his conspiracy against the Imperium. The player assumes control over the party just after the security agent entrusts it with the evidence against Kiefer.|$|E

25|$|The anthropic {{principle}} is a philosophical consideration that {{observations of the}} Universe must be compatible with the conscious and sapient life that observes it. Some proponents of the {{anthropic principle}} reason that it explains why <b>this</b> <b>universe</b> has the age and the fundamental physical constants necessary to accommodate conscious life. As a result, they believe it is unremarkable that <b>this</b> <b>universe</b> has fundamental constants that happen to fall within the narrow range thought to be compatible with life.|$|E

Some of these worlds, such as Surebleak and Delgado, were settled by Terrans from <b>this</b> <b>universe's</b> Terra. Others, such as Sintia, were settled by ships from the same Crystal Dragon-era {{colonization}} waves as Liad and Terra.|$|R

25|$|A metaphorical {{interpretation}} {{suggests that}} Kolob may {{be construed as}} a metaphor for Jesus. The symbolic interpretation was explained by Hugh Nibley in The Temple and The Cosmos. Advocates of the symbolic interpretation believe it harmonizes better with other Mormon beliefs and with beliefs in the greater Christian community, as it does not require that God have a physical throne within <b>this</b> <b>universe.</b>|$|E
25|$|Bhagavata Purana {{depicts the}} birth of the narmad. According to the text, Lord Vishnu in one of his incarnations {{appeared}} as Vaman in the sacrificial arena of Asur King Mahabali. Then in order to measure the universe, he extended his left foot {{to the end of the}} universe and pierced a hole in its covering with the nail of his big toe. Through the hole, the pure water of the Causal Ocean (Divine Brahm-Water) entered <b>this</b> <b>universe</b> as the Ganges River. Having washed the lotus feet of the Lord, which are covered with reddish saffron, the water of the Ganges acquired a very beautiful pink colour. Because the Ganges directly touches the lotus feet of Lord Vishnu (Narayana) before descending within <b>this</b> <b>universe,</b> it is known as Bhagavat-Padi or Vishnupadi which means Emanating from the lotus feet of Bhagavan (God). It finally settles in Brahmaloka or Brahmapura, abode of Lord Brahma before descending to planet Earth at the request of Bhagiratha and held safely by Lord Shiva on his head to prevent destruction of Bhumi Devi (Mother Earth). Then, the Ganges was released from Lord Shiva's hair to meet the needs of the country according to Hindu mythology. In other legends, Himavan fathered Parvati and Ganga.|$|E
25|$|In such a scenario, Jains {{argue that}} the {{material}} cause of a living soul with cetana (conscious entity) is always the soul itself and cause of dead inert matter (non-cetana i.e. without any consciousness) is always the matter itself. If God is indeed the creator, then this is an impossible predication as the same cause {{will be responsible for}} two contradictory effects of cetana (life) and acetana (matter). This logically precludes an immaterial God (a conscious entity) from creating <b>this</b> <b>Universe,</b> which is made up of material substances.|$|E
50|$|Killer Moth {{appears in}} the prequel comic to Injustice 2. Following {{the events of the}} first game, Killer Moth is shown {{to be a member of}} <b>this</b> <b>universe's</b> Suicide Squad, but after the Impostor Batman {{surprisingly}} appears and take control of the Squad, he kills Killer Moth using the bomb implanted in his neck, considering him useless.|$|R

The Mutant X universe reimagines Mr. Fantastic, Nick Fury, and Professor X as villains and Doctor Doom and Apocalypse as heroes.|$|R
