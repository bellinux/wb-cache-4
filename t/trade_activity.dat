5|$|The Wenxian Tongkao {{describes}} the main religions of Nubia, including the Da Qin religion (i.e. Christianity, particularly Nestorian Christianity {{associated with the}} Eastern Roman Empire) and the day of rest occurring every seven days for those following {{the faith of the}} Da shi (i.e. the Muslim Arabs). These passages are ultimately derived from the Jingxingji of Du Huan (fl. 8th century), a travel writer during the Chinese Tang dynasty (618–907) who was captured by Abbasid forces in the 751 Battle of Talas, after which he visited parts of West Asia and northeast Africa. Historian Wolbert Smidt identified the territory of Molin in Du's Jingxingji (preserved in part by the Tongdian of Du You) as the Christian kingdom of Muqurra in Nubia. He also associated the territory of Laobosa (Lao-p'o-sa) depicted therein with Abyssinia, thereby making this the first Chinese text to describe Ethiopia. When Du Huan left the region to return home, he did so through the Aksumite port of Adulis. <b>Trade</b> <b>activity</b> between Ethiopia and China during the latter's Song dynasty (960–1279) seems to be confirmed by Song-Chinese coinage found in the medieval village of Harla, near Dire Dawa, Ethiopia. The Chinese Ming dynasty (1368–1644) sent diplomats to Ethiopia, which was also frequented by Chinese merchants. Although only private and indirect trade was conducted with African countries during the early Manchu-led Qing dynasty (1644–1911), the Chinese were able to refer to Chinese-written travel literature and histories about East Africa before diplomatic relations were restored with African countries in the 19th century.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} option <b>trading</b> <b>activity</b> and stock market volatility. Although the option market is uniquely suited for trading on volatility information, there is little analysis on how <b>trading</b> <b>activity</b> in this market is linked to stock price volatility. The bulk of the discussion tends to focus on whether <b>trading</b> <b>activity</b> {{in the stock market}} is informative about stock volatility. To analyze the information in option <b>trading</b> <b>activity</b> for stock market volatility, a sample of 15 stocks with the highest option trading volume is selected. For each stock, it is noted that the <b>trading</b> <b>activities</b> in the put and call option markets have significant explanatory power for stock market volatility. In addition, the results indicate that the call option <b>trading</b> <b>activity</b> has a stronger impact on stock volatility compared with that of the put options. Our results demonstrate that information and sentiment in the option market is useful for the estimation of stock market volatility. Also, the significance of the effects of option <b>trading</b> <b>activity</b> on stock price volatility is observed to be comparable to that of stock market <b>trading</b> <b>activity.</b> Furthermore, the persistence and asymmetric effects in the volatility of some stocks tend to disappear once option <b>trading</b> <b>activity</b> is taken into account...|$|R

40|$|In this thesis, a {{framework}} for the specification and execution of composite <b>trading</b> <b>activities</b> is presented. We begin by introducing the basic concepts and characteristics of elementary and composite <b>trading</b> <b>activities.</b> Based on these characteristics, we identify the issues associated with composite <b>trading</b> <b>activities</b> and argue the requirements of a frame- work for the specification and execution of those <b>trading</b> <b>activities.</b> In the second chapter, the most relevant work on negotiation protocols, software specification approaches, and recent work on <b>trading</b> <b>activity</b> specification is reviewed. In the third chapter, we analyse the characteristics of negotiation protocols and the information required to adequately represent composite <b>trading</b> <b>activities.</b> In the next two chapters, we introduce two alternative approaches (myopic and forward- looking) for specifying composite <b>trading</b> <b>activities</b> by means of constraints, such {{as the number of}} required successful negotiations, the limit price for the items to be traded, and the temporal constraints imposed by all trading parties. A special interface is also defined in each framework to homogenise <b>trading</b> <b>activities</b> with differing negotiation protocols. In myopic <b>trading,</b> composite <b>activities</b> are synchronised according to the information available on the constituent negotiation processes at any point in time. Myopic trading supports iterative negotiation in which <b>trading</b> <b>activities</b> can be renegotiated with new constraints. Myopic trading is suitable for situations in which finer control over the negotiation process is preferred by the trader, and information on previous negotiations as well as future negotiation opportunities are unavailable. Forward-looking trading is based on the generation of negotiation plans detailing the exact time and duration for which <b>trading</b> <b>activities</b> are going to be executed. These plans are generated based on the histories of previous negotiations and future negotiation opportunities. In forward-looking trading, a planning and execution model is designed to maximise the expected utility of the trader. Forward-looking trading is suitable for situations in which a well-planned negotiation process is possible. In the following chapter, two case studies are given to illustrate the applicability of the proposed framework. In the final chapter, we review our framework based on the set of requirements defined for the specification and execution of composite <b>trading</b> <b>activities.</b> In conclusion, we believe that composite <b>trading</b> <b>activities</b> can be effectively specified and executed based on the homogenisation of the various negotiation protocols involved and systematic planning of how these activities are going to be executed...|$|R
