40|$|Tests of three-blade, adjustable-pitch counterrotating tandem model propellers, {{adjusted}} to absorb equal power at maximum {{efficiency of the}} combination, were made at Stanford University. The aerodynamic characteristics, for blade-angle settings of 15, 25, 35, 45, 55, and 65 degrees at 0. 75 R of the forward propeller and for diameters spacings of 8 - 1 / 2, 15 and 30 % were {{compared with those of}} three-blade and six-blade propellers of the same blade form. It was found that, in order to realize the condition of equal power at maximum efficiency, the blade angles for the rear propeller must be generally less than for the forward propeller, the difference increasing the blade angle. The tests showed that, at maximum efficiency, the <b>tandem</b> <b>propellers</b> absorb about double the power of three-blade propellers and about 8 % more power than six-blade propellers having the pitch of the forward propeller of the tandem combination. The maximum efficiency of the <b>tandem</b> <b>propellers</b> was found to be from 2 - 15 % greater than for six-blade propellers, the difference varying directly with blade angle. It was also found that the maximum efficiency of the <b>tandem</b> <b>propellers</b> was greater than that of a three-blade propeller for blade angles at 0. 75 R of 25 degrees or more. The difference in maximum efficiency again varied directly with blade angle, being about 9 % for 65 degrees at 0. 75 R...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} paper, a {{numerical}} simulation based on KÏ‰-SST turbulence {{model has been}} carried out to determine the tandem propeller hydrodynamic characteristics in non-cavitating viscous flow by using the commercial code Fluent. As the first step, the numerical approach has been applied to the case of single propeller and the comparison with experiment results was in a good agreement. Next, the effects of axial and angular displacement as well as the diameter ratio between the <b>tandem</b> <b>propellers</b> have been investigated. This part of the study reveals that the tandem with idem propeller diameters is strongly recommended to assure more advantages. Furthermore, the tandem geometry corresponding to the axial displacement equal to 0. 6 D seems to be the best configuration and the open water performances remain almost unchanged with the variation of angular displacement. On the other hand, details of the mutual interaction between <b>tandem</b> <b>propellers</b> were also given by showing pressure contours, streamlines and thrust coefficient. Globally, this study illustrates the advantages of replacing single propellers by tandem solution...|$|E
40|$|Tests of 2 -blade, adjustable-pitch, counter {{rotating}} tandem model propellers, {{adjusted to}} absorb equal power at maximum efficiency, {{were made at}} Stanford University. The characteristics, for 15 degrees, 25 degrees, 35 degrees, and 45 degrees pitch settings at 0. 75 R of the forward propeller and for 8 - 1 / 2 percent, 15 percent, and 30 percent diameter spacings, were {{compared with those of}} 2 -blade and 4 -blade propellers of the same blade form. The tests showed that the efficiency of the <b>tandem</b> <b>propellers</b> was from 0. 5 percent to 4 percent greater than that of a 4 -blade propeller and, at the high blade-angle settings, not appreciably inferior to that of a 2 -blade propeller. It was found that the rear tandem propeller should be set at a blade angle slightly less than that of the forward propeller to realize the condition of equal power at maximum efficiency. Under this condition the total power absorbed by the <b>tandem</b> <b>propellers</b> was from 3 percent to 9 percent more than that absorbed by the 4 -blade propeller and about twice that absorbed by a 2 -blade propeller...|$|E

50|$|In 1916, Zeppelin moved {{development}} of large bombers to Staaken, Germany. The R.V was co-developed alongside the R.VI and R.VII. The R.V had two engine pods, each with two engines paired in <b>tandem,</b> driving single <b>propellers</b> through clutches, gearboxes and shafts. An additional tractor engine was also fitted {{in the nose}} of the fuselage. The pods were large enough for some inflight maintenance. The Model R.IV was selected for production, rather than the R.V, because the geared and clutched engines posed a higher developmental risk. Each R-series aircraft required a ground-crew of 50.|$|R
