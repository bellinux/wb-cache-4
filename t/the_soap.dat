40|$|Nigerian {{traditional}} soaps {{were prepared}} using two commercial samples of {{palm kernel oil}} (black and pale-orange oils) that were extracted locally using two different traditional methods. The effect of the oil extraction method on <b>the</b> conductance of <b>soaps</b> in alcohols was then investigated. The conductance of <b>the</b> <b>soaps</b> prepared from <b>the</b> pale-orange oil was higher than that prepared from the black type. The plots of concentration conductance vs. the square root of concentration for methanolic solutions of <b>the</b> pale-orange oil <b>soaps</b> were linear, whereas the plots obtained for <b>the</b> black oil <b>soaps</b> were nonlinear. <b>The</b> plots of log(10) k vs. 1 /T were linear for all <b>the</b> <b>soaps</b> in methanol and for potassium soaps in 1 -propanol, whereas they were nonlinear for sodium soaps in 1 -propanol. The activation energy terms for <b>the</b> <b>soaps</b> prepared from pale-orange oil generally decreased {{with an increase in}} concentration, whereas the activation energies for <b>the</b> black oil <b>soaps</b> were less sensitive to changes in concentration. These observations suggest that the purity of the palm kernel oil can {{have a significant effect on}} the properties and quality of <b>the</b> traditional <b>soaps</b> and that <b>the</b> pale-orange oil was probably purer than the black type...|$|R
