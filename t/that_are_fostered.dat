Were the offender confined to the society of able and virtuous men he would probably be more improved than in solitude. But is this practicable? Mr Godwin's ingenuity is more frequently employed in finding out evils than in suggesting practical remedies.|$|E

40|$|The {{article is}} the result of a {{research}} focused on the history of the University of Buenos Aires, particularly on the uncompleted project of university reform <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>fostered</b> from May 1973. I analyze the case of the Cátedras Nacionales (1967 - 1971) as one of the experiences that precede the university project partially institutionalized since 1973. Among those cases that we have called formative experiences, the Cátedras Nacionales are a paradigmatic one, and perhaps the most explored. However, not always they have been recognized as the basis of the institutional transformation project <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>fostered</b> a few years later. Through a variety of primary sources, this paper argues that the Cátedras Nacionales and the University Reform Project are two separate moments which should be differentiated, but at the same time it is crucial to analyze the historical continuity of their postulates and the trajectories of the actors which participated on those events in order to understand the ways in which the reform project was institutionalized...|$|R

The parent-child communication styles <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>fostered</b> in disrupted families due to depletion of tangible and intangible resources promote the importance of material possessions, while peer influences during adolescent years are positively associated with the impulse-control dimension of compulsive buying in early adulthood.

40|$|Background: Selectively bred rodent {{lines are}} {{valuable}} tools for investigating gene x environment interactions related to risk for alcoholism in humans. Early maternal environment is one particular factor known for critically influencing neural, hormonal, and behavioral outcomes in adulthood. Cross-fostering <b>is</b> a procedure <b>that</b> may <b>be</b> used {{to explore the}} role of genotype-dependent maternal influences on phenotypic variability in adulthood. The purpose of these experiments {{was to examine the}} effects of cross-fostering on free-choice alcohol drinking and correlated responses to selection for alcohol preference in mice selectively bred for high- (HAP 2) and low- (LAP 2) alcohol preference. Methods: Mice were assigned to one of the following treatments: SHAM (pups <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>fostered</b> to their original biological mother), IN (pups <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>fostered</b> to a different mother of the same line), and CROSS (pups <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>fostered</b> to a mother of a different line). Mice were tested in adulthood for (1) free 24 -hr access to alcohol for a period of 28 days; (2) expression of the acoustic startle response and fear-potentiated startle (FPS) and (3) handling-induced convulsions (HICs) during acute alcohol withdrawal. Results: Overall, the expression of the alcohol preference selection phenotype was robust in all groups (HAP 23 ̆eLAP 2). Cross-fostering produced a moderate but significant reduction in g/kg alcohol drinking and preference scores in HAP 2 mice (CROSSLAP 2), FPS (HAP 23 ̆eLAP 2), HICs (LAP 23 ̆eHAP 2). Conclusions: It appears that maternal environment can modify the expression of the high alcohol preference phenotype in HAP 2 selectively bred mice. These results suggest a gene x environment interaction with respect to the expression of the high alcohol preference selection phenotype but not correlated responses to selection...|$|R

40|$|This article {{reports on}} a {{small-scale}} research project that explored the class-consciousness and working-class identities {{of a small group}} of student teachers in a university in south-east England. It describes and uses classic Marxist perspectives and sociological theory as an analytical framework to interpret the views of eight student teachers who provide their perspectives in a series of in-depth interviews. It is argued that these student teachers' identities and class experiences have sculpted their motivations to become teachers and that the form of class-consciousness that they exhibit ultimately acts to mould attitudes and perspectives that suit the objectives of twenty-first-century primary education in a capitalist society. Power relations are played out through the struggle between the potential social power that working-class-conscious teachers possess and the forms of professional labour power <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>fostered</b> through initial teacher education courses and the habitus from which these students emerge...|$|E
40|$|Institutions can {{contribute}} to regulating interethnic conflict; however, {{in many cases they}} fail to bring about lasting peace. The paper argues that their negligence of intraethnic factors accounts for some of this failure. Ethnic groups are often treated as unitary actors even though most consist of various linguistic, tribal or religious subgroups. This internal heterogeneity is often obscured by overarching collective ethnic identities <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>fostered</b> by interethnic conflict. However, when such interethnic conflict is settled, these subgroup differences may come back to the fore. This resurgence can lead to subgroup conflict about the political and economic resources provided through intergroup institutional settlements. Such conflict can in turn undermine the peace-making effect of intergroup arrangements. Different subgroup identity constellations make such destructive effects more or less likely. The paper focuses on self-government provisions in the aftermath of violent interethnic conflict and argues that lasting intergroup arrangements are especially challenging when they involve contested ethnic groups...|$|E

40|$|Background: Poetry {{plays an}} age-old {{role in the}} art of healing. Although {{medicine}} today seems distant from the world of poetic expression, there are surprising commonalities between the two. Objectives: In this essay we reflect on three aspects of healing <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>fostered</b> by poetry. Observations: Practicing medicine with too many facts and not enough poetry leads to dissatisfaction, disappointment, and impaired healing, especially in the care of the terminally ill. Likewise, poetry deficiency cuts off an important avenue for physician self-awareness and reflectivity. Alternatively, three aspects of healing are fostered by poetry: the power of the word to heal (and also harm); the skill of “negative capability ” that enhances physician effectiveness; and empathic connection, or compassionate presence, a relationship that heals without words. Conclusion: Reading and writing poetry can help physicians, especially those who care for dying patients, become more reflective, creative, and compassionate practitioners.

40|$|Objectives The {{development}} of personal involvement and responsibility {{has become a}} strategic issue in health policy. The main goal {{of this study is}} to confirm the coexistence of three logics of personal empowerment through health information found on the Internet. Methods A theoretical framework was applied to analyze personal empowerment from the user's perspective. A well-established Canadian Web site that offers information on personal health was used as a case study. A close-ended questionnaire was completed online by 2275 visitors and members of the Web site. Results The findings confirm that the {{development of}} feelings of competence and control through Internet use is structured around three different logics. This implies three types of aptitudes <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>fostered</b> when the Internet is used to seek health information: doing what is prescribed (the professional logic), making choices based on personal judgment (the consumer logic), and mutual assistance (the community logic). Conclusions A recurring issue in three logics is the balance of roles and responsibilities required between the individual and the health provider. ...|$|E

Teachers manage students who attempt to challenge the boundaries of this community by utilizing and ethic of care which allows teachers to de-emphasize authority and to first consider the networks of relationships and how to mend and improve them. Students are able to experience governmentality and an opportunity to reassess their behaviors against the community norms. It also appears that students are socialized into gemeinschaft values by experiencing caring, loving, and nurturing relationships that are meaningful and significant. Students also experience their own independence and self-governance and are afforded opportunities to share authority in a bottom-up approach.
