5|$|The Metropolitan District Railway (commonly {{known as}} the District Railway) was a {{passenger}} railway that served London from 1868 to 1933. Established in 1864 to complete <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>circle,</b> an underground railway in London, {{the first part of}} the line opened using gas-lit wooden carriages hauled by steam locomotives. The Metropolitan Railway operated all services until the District introduced its own trains in 1871. The railway was soon extended westwards through Earl's Court to Fulham, Richmond, Ealing and Hounslow. After completing <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>circle</b> and reaching Whitechapel in 1884, it was extended to Upminster in Essex in 1902.|$|E

5|$|By the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, the DR had been extended to Richmond, Ealing Broadway, Hounslow West and Wimbledon in the west and to New Cross Gate in the east. The southern section of <b>the</b> <b>Inner</b> <b>Circle</b> was suffering considerable congestion between South Kensington and Mansion House, between which stations the DR was running an average of 20 trains per hour with more in the peak periods.|$|E

5|$|In December 1876, six trains {{per hour}} ran on <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>circle</b> between Mansion House and Aldgate. The District {{operated}} four trains per hour from Mansion House to Hammersmith. Also leaving every hour from Mansion House were two GWR middle circle services to Aldgate via Addison Road and two L services to Broad Street via Willesden Junction. Three services an hour travelled between West Brompton and Earl's Court.|$|E
5|$|In the 1920s, {{off-peak}} {{there was}} a train every 4–5minutes from Wembley Park to Baker Street. There were generally two services per hour from both Watford and Uxbridge that ran non-stop from Wembley Park and stopping services started from Rayners Lane, Wembley Park, and Neasden, although most did not stop at Marlborough Road and St John's Wood Road. Off-peak, stations north of Moor Park were generally served by Marylebone trains. During the peak trains approached Baker Street every 2.5–3minutes, half running through to Moorgate, Liverpool Street or Aldgate. On <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>circle</b> a train from Hammersmith ran through Baker Street every 6minutes, and Kensington (Addison Road) services terminated at Edgware Road. Maintaining a frequency of ten trains {{an hour on the}} circle was proving difficult and the solution chosen was for the District to extend its Putney to Kensington High Street service around the circle to Edgware Road, using the new platforms, and the Met to provide all <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>circle</b> trains at a frequency of eight trains an hour.|$|E

Max raids Lem's restaurant, killing several of his henchmen, and discovers that Winterson was Lem's mistress. He then races to Gognitti's hideout to save him from Lem, and the two flee to Mona's funhouse hoping that she can help them, but Lem ambushes them. He reveals that Mona is a hired gun for Woden, with orders to kill Lem and Max. Lem murders Gognitti, shoots Max and leaves him for dead. Mona rescues Max, and together, they go to Woden's mansion to save him from Lem.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} DR {{station was}} rebuilt {{at the beginning}} of the 20th century, initially as a single-storey structure. An office building was built above it later.

5|$|Before its takeover, the DR {{had carried}} out some joint {{electrification}} experiments with the Metropolitan Railway (MR), the other sub-surface line {{with which the}} DR shared <b>the</b> <b>Inner</b> <b>Circle.</b> A section of track between Earl's Court and High Street Kensington was electrified with a four-rail system and a jointly owned test train operated a shuttle service between February and November 1900. Having proven the practicality of electric traction, the two companies set up a joint committee to select a supplier of equipment for the electrification of their networks.|$|E
5|$|From 1 August 1872, the Middle Circle service {{also began}} {{operations}} through Gloucester Road, running from Moorgate along the MR's tracks {{on the north}} side of <b>the</b> <b>Inner</b> <b>Circle</b> to Paddington, then over the Hammersmith & City Railway (H) track to Latimer Road, then, via a now demolished link, on the WLEJR to Addison Road and the DR to Mansion House.

He is also favorable towards Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak), who {{he believes is}} the head of the customer service department, and Kelly Kapoor's (Mindy Kaling) direct supervisor. Kelly is initially irate at the situation, but Ryan agrees to be a more dutiful boyfriend in exchange for Kelly keeping up the charade. Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) desperately aspires to join <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>circle,</b> while Deangelo repeatedly attempts to win over Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson), who is still apathetic toward the new boss. Angela Martin (Angela Kinsey) sees his style as sexist, as every member of <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>circle</b> is male, which Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) agrees to, as Deangelo has repeatedly been acting coldly towards her. To prove to the staff that he's not sexist, Deangelo hires a woman named Jordan Garfield (Cody Horn), who turns out to have no business experience (having previously worked in Anthropologie) over other qualified candidates, including a friend of Pam's. Kelly later attempts to tell Deangelo the truth about Ryan's actual position as a temp worker, but Deangelo simply appoints Ryan as the department head rather than figuring out the truth.|$|E
5|$|On 1 July 1905, the Met and the District both {{introduced}} electric {{units on}} <b>the</b> <b>inner</b> <b>circle</b> until {{later that day}} a Met multiple unit overturned the positive current rail on the District and the Met service was withdrawn.

Full electric service started on 24 September, reducing the travel time around the circle from 70 to 50 minutes.|$|E
