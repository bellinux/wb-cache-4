5000|$|One {{example of}} {{chemical}} waste being exported from the Global North onto the Global South was {{the event of}} an Italian business man seeking to avoid European economic regulations. Allegedly exporting 4,000 tons of toxic waste, containing 150 tons of polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, the Italian businessman made $4.3 million in shipping hazardous waste to Nigeria. The Fordham Environmental Law Review published an article explaining the impacts of the toxic waste imposed on Nigeria in further detail:"Mislabelling the garbage as fertilizers, the Italian company deceived a retired/illiterate timber worker into agreeing to store the poison in his backyard at the Nigerian river port of Koko for as little as 100 dollars a month. These toxic chemicals were exposed to the hot sun and to children playing nearby. They leaked into the Koko water system resulting in the death of nineteen villagers who ate contaminated rice from a nearby farm."

40|$|In {{my first}} chapter, I {{investigate}} how local {{access to credit}} affects large-scale firm outcomes like exporting. I answer this question by modeling the relationship between finance-constrained exporters and bank entry decisions. This generates bilateral trade equations where local access to banking increases the intensive and extensive margin of exporting. I estimate this model with a panel of Brazilian municipal-level trade and banking data and show that commercial bank presence per person increases bilateral exports. In my second chapter, I analyze the geography of bank company branching decisions and their effect on access to finance. I focus on three essential aspects of this unit of analysis: financial products are largely homogeneous, yet banks still enjoy significant market power, many companies build multiple branches in a single market, and those markets are often geographically distant from the bank company 2 ̆ 7 s headquarters. I capture these effects by building a model of heterogeneously productive banks that compete for the share of monopolistic profits by building bank branches. This paper shows {{that the effects of}} within-country geography on bank company behavior can help explain endogenous financial development. For my final chapter, I look at economies of scale in shipping and patterns of subnational trade. I show that intranational trade between regions in goods destined for consumption in the U. S. is increasing in shipments destined for foreign markets. Ignoring this relationship means means that <b>traditional</b> <b>trade</b> <b>flow</b> estimates will overstate the effect of distance on trade...|$|E

40|$|Economists devote {{too much}} {{attention}} to international flows of goods and services and not enough to international <b>flows</b> of ideas. <b>Traditional</b> <b>trade</b> <b>flows</b> are an imperfect substitute for flows of the underlying ideas. The simplest textbook trade model shows that a welfare-enhancing move toward freer flows of ideas should be associated with a reduction in conventional trade. The large quantitative effect from the flow of ideas is evident {{in the second half of}} the 20 th century as the life expectancies in poor and rich countries began to converge. Another example comes from China, where authorities dramatically reduced accident rates by adopting rules of civil aviation that were developed in the United States. All economists, including trade economists, would be better equipped to talk about international flows of technologies and rules if they adopted a consistent vocabulary based on the concepts of nonrivalry and excludability. An analysis of the interaction between rules and technologies may help explain important puzzles such as why private firms have successfully diffused some technologies (mobile telephony) but not others (safe municipal water.) ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} impact of {{vertical}} specialization on world trade {{within the framework of}} the O-ring theory of production. Within such a framework there is little scope for substituting quantity for quality or for gaining market shares by undercutting established suppliers purely on cost. Furthermore, quality requirements will increase as lead firms in the supply chain invest in technology that reduces inventory and speeds up the production process. It is shown that potential suppliers in low-cost countries will only have an incentive to upgrade quality if adequately efficient infrastructure, logistics and customs procedures are in place. Changing trade patterns between USA and Mexico and China suggests that proximity and low trade barriers are important determinants of the extent and nature of vertical specialization. Thus, a larger share of Mexico's trade with USA is driven by vertical specialization than China's trade with USA. Nevertheless, China has caught up with Mexico as far as share in US total imports is concerned, and the market share gap has narrowed even in electronics, the sector in which vertical specialization is most prominent. It appears that vertical specialization adds to total world trade rather than replacing <b>traditional</b> <b>trade</b> <b>flows...</b>|$|R
40|$|Since the 1980 s, {{competitive}} pressure {{has increased in}} the world economy. In addition to <b>traditional</b> <b>trade</b> <b>flows,</b> the globalisation of production and markets has greatly enhanced {{the complexity of the}} international division of labour. Declining transaction and information costs have stimulated the fragmentation of production processes on a worldwide scale and the relocation of noncompetitive industries. As a result, in both industrialised and developing countries, newly emerging competitors have increasingly challenged established suppliers. The aim of this study is threefold. First, the authors portray the trend towards globalisation and assess by which means enterprises have gone global. Second, they discuss the adjustment needs of traditional producers by evaluating the consequences of globalisation on trade, production, employment and wages. Third, they analyse whether the economic policy reactions to globalisation in industrialised countries are adequate to deal efficiently with competitive challenges. It turns out that the scope of national policies has been significantly reduced by globalised production and markets, while corporate strategies have increasingly been less constrained. Consequently, major policy revisions are indispensable. Most importantly, governments in industrialised countries should focus their attention on human capital formation, rather than on defensive trade policies, whose effectiveness has been seriously eroded.

40|$|During {{the last}} decades the {{exchange}} trade in Spain overseas has experienced a major boost, firstly related to European market integration and, recently, to the worldwide globalization process, whereby huge exporters (i. e. China or India) have raised to the new international scene {{and the development of}} services’ international exchange both played a key role. These changes make the analysis of the conditioning main factors for explaining the evolution of exchange <b>trade</b> <b>flows</b> in Spain by means of econometric models especially hard, since they seldom may approach the special features of the long term under consideration. The aim of this paper is showing the results obtained once traditional demand functions for imports and exports of goods and services for the Spanish economy – quarterly series from National Accounts for the period 1980 - 2006 – were re-estimated. Besides, within goods’ flows based on home and host’s Euro Area exports and imports, on one hand, and worldwide, on the other, are taken into consideration in order to prove whether trade flows’ determinants may vary across host markets where goods are exchanged.

The preliminary results render a strong support for the relevance of certain supply-side factors in explaining international tourism flows such as both natural endowments and created assets associated with foreign investments, hotel capacity and level of development. ...|$|R
40|$|Transaction {{costs are}} a major reason why {{international}} <b>trade</b> <b>flows</b> are much smaller than <b>traditional</b> <b>trade</b> theory would suggest. Trust between trading partners lowers transaction costs and may therefore enhance trade. The empirical analysis of this paper shows that more trust leads to more trade so {{that part of the}} "mystery of missing trade" {{can be attributed to the}} lack of trust between trading partners, e. g. because of cultural differences and habits, or because of insufficient information on product quality and reliability. Our gravity equation estimates for 25 countries show that measures of both formal and of informal trust contribute to the explanation of bilateral <b>trade</b> <b>flows.</b> When we assume an increase in informal trust by one standard deviation, the combined effects of formal and informal trust may add up to a 90 to 150 percent change in bilateral trade, depending on the legal system.
