Morrison {{has said he}} prefers to perform at smaller venues or symphony halls noted for their good acoustics. His ban against alcoholic beverages, which made entertainment news during 2008, {{was an attempt to}} prevent the disruptive and distracting movement of audience members leaving their seats during the performances. In a 2009 interview, Morrison stated: [...] "I do not consciously aim to take the listener anywhere. If anything, I aim to take myself <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> music. If the listener catches the wavelength of what I am saying or singing, or gets whatever point whatever line means to them, then I guess as a writer I may have done a day's work." ...|$|E

Due to Spector's perfectionism in the studio, he made Turner sing the song {{over and over}} for several hours until {{he felt he had}} the perfect vocal take for the song. [...] Turner recalled, [...] "I must have sung that 500,000 times. I was drenched with sweat. I had to take my shirt off and stand <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> bra to sing." ...|$|E

2500|$|Spin {{wrote that}} Miller's {{influence}} as a songwriter outreached his fame. Miller was credited as an influential {{force in the}} 1980s- and 1990s-era music scenes, beginning in Northern California with bands associated with the Paisley Underground genre, and later influencing better-known independent pop artists. In 1996, Aimee Mann stated that [...] "Scott Miller is the best songwriter out <b>there,</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> opinion. I often think about that when I'm writing: 'Would Scott think this song is any good?'" [...] adding [...] "Scott's definitely better than me." [...] Mann confirmed {{more than a decade}} later, [...] "I was very influenced by Scott Miller's songwriting," [...] and [...] "musically, he was a really big influence." ...|$|E
2500|$|Following the Japanese {{military}} {{offensive against}} the Philippines, President Roosevelt ordered MacArthur {{to evacuate the}} islands. MacArthur reluctantly left, promising to send reinforcements that never came. In his autobiography, MacArthur recalled {{one of his last}} memories on leaving the Philippines was of Bunker:"On the dock I could see the men staring at me. I had lost 25 pounds living on the same diet as the soldiers, and I must have looked gaunt and ghastly standing <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> old war-stained clothes - no bemedaled commander of inspiring presence. ... Through the shattered ruins, my eyes sought 'Topside,' where the deep roar of heavy guns still growled defiance, with their red blasts tearing the growing darkness asunder. Up there, in command, was my classmate, Paul Bunker. Forty years had passed since Bunker had twice been selected by Walter Camp for the All American team. I could shut my eyes and see again that blond head racing, tearing, plunging - 210 pounds of irresistible power. I could almost hear Quarterback Charley Daly's shrill voice barking, 'Bunker back.' He and many others up there were old, old friends, bound by ties of deepest friendship." ...|$|E
