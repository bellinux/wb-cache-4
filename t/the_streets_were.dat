5|$|Ferdinando II died on 23 May 1670 of {{apoplexy}} and dropsy and was interred in the Basilica of San Lorenzo, the Medicean necropolis. At {{the time}} of his death, the population of the grand duchy was 720,594 souls; <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>were</b> lined with grass and the buildings {{on the verge of collapse}} in Pisa, while Siena was virtually abandoned.|$|E
5|$|A grand {{funeral was}} held for the Prince Imperial two days after his death. <b>The</b> <b>streets</b> <b>were</b> crowded with {{ordinary}} people who greatly mourned the prince's death. So remarkable was the event that tourists paid {{for the privilege of}} watching the funeral procession from a hotel in downtown Rio de Janeiro. Pedro Afonso was buried in the mausoleum of the Convento de Santo Antônio (Convent of Saint Anthony) in Rio de Janeiro.|$|E
5|$|Penn sent three commissioners to {{supervise}} the settlement and to set aside 10,000 acres (40km²) for the city. The commissioners bought land from Swedes at the settlement of Wicaco, and from there began {{to lay out the}} city toward the north. The area went about a mile along the Delaware River between modern South and Vine Streets. Penn's ship anchored off the coast of New Castle, Delaware, on October 27, 1682, and he arrived in Philadelphia a few days after that. He expanded the city west to the bank of the Schuylkill River, for a total of 1,200 acres (4.8km²). Streets were laid out in a gridiron system. Except for the two widest streets, High (now Market) and Broad, <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>were</b> named after prominent landowners who owned adjacent lots. <b>The</b> <b>streets</b> <b>were</b> renamed in 1684; the ones running east-west were named after local trees (Vine, Sassafras, Mulberry, Cherry, Chestnut, Walnut, Locust, Spruce, Pine, Lombard, and Cedar) and the north-south streets were numbered. Within the area, four squares (now named Rittenhouse, Logan, Washington and Franklin) were set aside as parks open for everyone. Penn designed a central square at the intersection of Broad and what is now Market Street to be surrounded by public buildings.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>street</b> <b>is</b> 500 {{meters in}} length with {{buildings}} along <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>were</b> built following <b>the</b> slope of <b>the</b> <b>street</b> which {{sits on a}} hill slope. <b>The</b> <b>street</b> <b>is</b> located 1,400 meters above sea level and filled with restaurants and souvenir shops.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>street</b> <b>was</b> {{laid out}} ca. 1710. It runs from Nevsky Prospekt to <b>the</b> Gorokhovaya <b>Street.</b> <b>The</b> <b>street</b> <b>was</b> filled with wealthy estates, with large gardens, from where <b>the</b> <b>street</b> got its name. Later on, ca. 1730, <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>was</b> being built {{on to the}} southwestern direction, and two squares were built; Hay Square and Turgenev Square.Later on, ca. 1820, <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>was</b> being built northwards on to the Field of Mars. Garden <b>Street</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> trading center of Saint Petersburg in the 18th to the 19th century.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> modern <b>street</b> <b>was</b> first {{built in}} the mid-19th century. <b>The</b> <b>street</b> <b>was</b> later paved. Streetcars and {{trolleys}} were added in the 20th century and <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>was</b> two-way. There {{are a number of}} apartment buildings and parks along the entire length of <b>the</b> <b>street</b> ...|$|R
5|$|Polish {{flags and}} other symbols were confiscated. The {{war on the}} Polish {{language}} included the tearing down of signs in Polish and the banning of Polish speech in public places. Persons who spoke Polish in <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>were</b> often insulted and even physically assaulted. The Germanization of place names prevailed. Many treasures of Polish culture – including memorials, plaques and monuments to national heroes (e.g., Kraków's Adam Mickiewicz monument) – were destroyed. In Toruń, all Polish monuments and plaques were torn down. Dozens of monuments were destroyed throughout Poland. The Nazis planned to level entire cities.|$|E
5|$|The Domesday {{survey of}} 1086 {{revealed}} 110 households which were mainly rural. In 1251, a survey showed an increase to 345 households with {{the start of}} urban living although still largely rural. By the 1416 survey there were 457 occupied premises {{in the city and}} many of <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>were</b> arranged much as they are today. See also the cartographer John Speed's plan of Ely, 1610. In 1563 there were 800 households and by 1753 the population was recorded as 3,000.|$|E
5|$|The {{explosion}} {{was caused}} by a gas leak in a 30-year-old building. It severely damaged a nearby nine-story apartment building, causing it to collapse. Mónica Fein, mayor of Rosario, asked residents to avoid the area because of the risk that more buildings might collapse, and to ease the work of disaster management personnel. <b>The</b> <b>streets</b> <b>were</b> covered with broken glass from damaged buildings. Gas and electricity were immediately disconnected, and the national government sent an Argentine Federal Police task force to the scene.|$|E
5000|$|In 1925, <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>was</b> renamed to Fizuli Street, {{in honour of}} Mahammad Fuzuli - great Azerbaijani poet of the 16th century, and {{was called}} so until 1962, with slight breaks from 1939 to 1940, when <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>was</b> renamed to Krasnopresnenskaya <b>Street.</b> Since 1962, <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>is</b> called Nizami <b>Street.</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>street</b> <b>was</b> {{first opened}} {{for the public}} on July 23, 1916. The first name given to <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>was</b> by Khalil Pasha who named <b>the</b> <b>street</b> [...] "Jadde Si". The name of <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>was</b> then inscribed on a ceramic plate and placed on the main wall of Sultan Ali Mosque. The sign lasted until the mid-1950s.|$|R
50|$|Only {{the east}} end of <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>is</b> open to all traffic. The bulk of <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>is</b> limited to trams, buses and taxis.|$|R
5|$|After {{the end of}} the Anarchy, {{the number}} of small towns in England began to {{increase}} sharply. By 1297, 120 new towns had been established, and in 1350 – by when the expansion had effectively ceased – there were around 500 towns in England. Many of these new towns were centrally planned: Richard I created Portsmouth, John founded Liverpool, and successive monarchs followed with Harwich, Stony Stratford, Dunstable, Royston, Baldock, Wokingham, Maidenhead and Reigate. The new towns were usually located with access to trade routes in mind, rather than defence, and <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>were</b> laid out to make access to the town's market convenient. A growing percentage of England's population lived in urban areas; estimates suggest that this rose from around 5.5% in 1086 to up to 10% in 1377.|$|E
5|$|As {{the number}} of clergy was {{severely}} limited, Soegijapranata roamed from church to church to attend to parishioners, actively preaching and serving as the de facto head of the Catholic Church in the country; this was in part to counteract rumours of his detention by the Japanese. He travelled by foot, bicycle, and carriage, as his car had been seized. He sent pastors to apostolic prefectures in Bandung, Surabaya, and Malang {{to deal with the}} lack of clergy there. Soegijapranata worked to ensure that the seminary would continue to produce new pastors and appointed the recently ordained Father Hardjawasita as its rector. He also granted native priests the authority to perform marriages. To calm the Catholic populace, he visited their homes and convinced them that <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>were</b> safe.|$|E
5|$|Baltimore Avenue and Philadelphia Avenue {{date back}} to the {{founding}} of Ocean City in 1875. Both avenues originally extended from South Division Street to North Division Street. <b>The</b> <b>streets</b> <b>were</b> later extended north as far as 15th Street. Baltimore Avenue served as the main thoroughfare of Ocean City until Philadelphia Avenue and Coastal Highway assumed predominance in the 1950s. MD 378 was assigned to Baltimore Avenue, which was paved from US 213 (Worcester Street) to 15th Street by 1927. MD 528 was assigned to Philadelphia Avenue when that street was rebuilt between US 213 and 15th Street in 1933. MD 528 was extended north to the Delaware state line when Coastal Highway was completed in 1939.|$|E
50|$|Torstenssonsgatan, Östermalm, Stockholm, Sweden, {{stretches}} between Strandvägen and Storgatan. <b>The</b> <b>street</b> <b>is</b> crossed by Riddargatan. Torstenssonsgatan is a {{wide and}} short avenue (about 200 meter) with linden trees. In the extension of <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>is</b> <b>The</b> Museum of National Antiquities (Historiska Museet). <b>The</b> <b>street</b> <b>is</b> a not a through street to Strandvägen.|$|R
50|$|In 1647 <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>was</b> first {{referred}} to as Sancti Påwels gathun. It is unclear where the name came from, but possibly the Maria Magdalena Church, which is close by, giving rise to the name of <b>the</b> <b>street.</b> <b>The</b> Methodist St. Paul Church which lies along <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>is</b> named after <b>the</b> <b>street.</b> Also found on <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>are</b> Mariatorget (Maria Square) and Van der Nootska Palace.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>street</b> <b>was</b> {{destroyed}} {{both in the}} Copenhagen Fire of 1728 and in the Fire of 1795. The {{houses in}} <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>were</b> subsequently rebuilt.|$|R
5|$|Early {{housing in}} the village {{consisted}} of groups of thatched cottages clustered around and near the parish church. The influx of workers from areas around the village accompanied an increased demand for extra housing. Even after {{the establishment of the}} local board of health new properties were often built in the gardens of existing dwellings, leading to severe overcrowding. In 1852 <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>were</b> paved with boulders, sewerage was non-existent, and water supply was a local well. During {{the latter half of the}} 19th century new housing was erected alongside the railway, and large areas of open land were soon occupied with new housing estates built for the area's more wealthy residents.|$|E
5|$|In Tampico, {{near the}} {{location}} of the storm's second landfall, <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>were</b> littered with fallen trees branches, utility poles, and billboards. Additionally, many roads were inundated with water, leaving some impassable. Nearby, over 700people fled their homes for shelter due to flooding in Ciudad Madero. One death occurred in Pueblo Viejo when a woman was crushed by a tree that fell on her house. Six other deaths occurred in Veracruz, five from a ship capsizing near Boca del Río and another after a person was caught in an undertow offshore Úrsulo Galván. Two landslides in northern Puebla left roads impassable, isolating some communities such as Tlatlauquitepec. Hundreds of homes were destroyed leaving 35,000people homeless and there was severe damage in Tuxpan, Tamiahua, Pueblo Viejo, Platon, Pánuco, Tampico Alto, and elsewhere along the coast of northeast Mexico.|$|E
5|$|The Mumbai slum set in {{the season}} finale was {{constructed}} on {{the parking lot of}} the studio, which took two to three weeks to complete. The finale was filmed during one of the hottest heatwaves to hit British Columbia; Tapping found that the set was hotter than the average temperature of the actual Mumbai. Three main cameras were used, one of which was crane-operated. 60 extras were used, the highest number used in an Sanctuary episode. For the extras to be used in more than one scene, they wore many different costumes. The streeting area was also limited in size, so <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>were</b> recycled frequently with every scene. The practical sets of the Sanctuary offices and corridors were also redesigned to look like the Mumbai Sanctuary.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>street</b> <b>is</b> {{named for}} Holy Cross Church, which stands on Krakowskie Przedmieście. Named after <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>are</b> a Warsaw Metro {{station and the}} Świętokrzyski Bridge.|$|R
50|$|During its history, the Sonnenallee {{has been}} known under various other names. At <b>the</b> {{beginning}} <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>was</b> known simply as Straße 84 (Street No. 84). In 1893, {{five years after the}} death of Kaiser Friedrich Wilhelm <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>was</b> renamed in his honour. In <b>the</b> 1920s <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>was</b> extended to <b>the</b> south east and named Sonnenallee.|$|R
50|$|Just {{past the}} western end of <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> Irish Hunger Memorial. This end of <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>is</b> in <b>the</b> {{northern}} part of Battery Park City.|$|R
5|$|By {{the time}} the advance units of the Leningrad Front arrived at Tallinn early on 22 September, German troops had {{practically}} abandoned the city and <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>were</b> empty. The last German unit to leave Tallinn that morning was the 531st Navy Artillery Battalion. Before embarkation, all stationary artillery and armaments, special equipment, guns {{that could not be}} evacuated, ammunition, the telephone exchange, the radio broadcast house, locomotives and railroad cars, and the railway were destroyed. The Tallinn power plant was fired upon from the sea and the Old City Harbour was destroyed. The retreating German units had no combat contact with the Red Army in Tallinn. The Government of Estonia had failed to concentrate the Estonian soldiers retreating from the Narva and Emajõgi fronts, as the units were scattered and mixed with the German detachments withdrawing towards Latvia. Therefore, the government lacked significant military forces to repulse the Soviet forces concentrated around Tallinn. The units securing the national capital and the government were led by Rear Admiral Johan Pitka. Troops of the Leningrad Front seized Tallinn on 22 September. Jüri Uluots, acting President of Estonia, evacuated to Sweden. In the following days, several pro-independence Estonian battle groups attacked the Soviet troops in Harju and Lääne counties without success.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} days, houses were wooden boards fronted by a four-board-high fence which was fronted with a boardwalk. Most of <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>were</b> dirt roads. Winters were bitterly cold, and teams of horses {{dragging}} V-shaped wooden plows cleared the streets. In {{the center of}} town was the community pump, from which the village would draw water at stipulated hours. Water was pumped from the mine twice a day through a big open pipe. Everyone had to carry water home during pumping time. There was no shutoff valve, so buckets, tubs and barrels were used for water storage. Later, a water tower was built to hold water drawn from a deep well. St. Bernard dogs helped carry the water from the well to the homes. Running water and bathtubs came only after ditches were dug for pipes to provide water from Gilbert around 1916. Kerosene lamps provided the means of lighting until 1916, when power lines were installed. Initially, the only telephone was at the Elba mine office.|$|E
5|$|The Village {{was almost}} {{completely}} self-contained, {{with its own}} shops, public hall, post office, police station, school, social club, and sports facilities. Three corrugated iron churches were built: a Methodist chapel in 1901, St Cuthberts (Church of England) in 1902, and the Roman Catholic St Antony's in 1904. St Cuthbert's was subsequently replaced by a brick building, but closed in 1982. Only St Antony's remains open; it contains the altar and a stained glass window from the chapel at Trafford Hall, donated by Lady Annette de Trafford. The Village's design attracted criticism from the start; <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>were</b> narrow, with few gardens, and the whole development {{was close to the}} pollution of the neighbouring industries. In that respect it resembled the terraced properties in the surrounding areas, many of which were condemned as slums in later years. By the 1970s The Village was also considered by Stretford Council to be a slum area, and unsuitable for residential housing. In the first phase of clearance, during the mid-1970s, 298houses were demolished. A further 325 houses were demolished in the early 1980s, leaving only the largest 84 houses remaining.|$|E
50|$|In Marley Pots, <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>are</b> all {{associated}} with trees, e.g. Maplewood, Elmwood etc.In Millfield, <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>are</b> all {{associated with}} plants, e.g. Chester, Fern, Rose, Hyacinth etc.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>street</b> <b>was</b> {{opened in}} 1650 on the rue du Bœuf, then called rue Tramassac. The No. 6 of <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>was</b> sold to <b>the</b> {{hospitals}} of Lyon.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>street</b> <b>was</b> built when Lord Berkeley's {{estate was}} developed. Most terrace houses along <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>were</b> built in <b>the</b> 1750s. Many {{of them are}} now listed by Historic England.|$|R
5|$|There is also {{an older}} {{downtown}} grid system {{that was designed to}} be parallel to the confluence of the South Platte River and Cherry Creek. Most of the streets downtown and in LoDo run northeast–southwest and northwest–southeast. This system has an unplanned benefit for snow removal; if <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>were</b> in a normal N–S/E–W grid, only the N–S streets would receive sunlight. With the grid oriented to the diagonal directions, the NW–SE streets receive sunlight to melt snow in the morning and the NE–SW streets receive it in the afternoon. This idea was from Henry Brown the founder of the Brown Palace Hotel. There is now a plaque {{across the street from the}} Brown Palace Hotel which honors this idea. The NW–SE streets are numbered, while the NE–SW streets are named. The named streets start at the intersection of Colfax Avenue and Broadway with the block-long Cheyenne Place. The numbered streets start underneath the Colfax and I-25 viaducts. There are 27 named and 44 numbered streets on this grid. There are also a few vestiges of the old grid system in the normal grid, such as Park Avenue, Morrison Road, and Speer Boulevard. Larimer Street, named after William Larimer, Jr., the founder of Denver, which is in the heart of LoDo, is the oldest street in Denver.|$|E
25|$|The United States Congress {{passed the}} Embargo Act of 1807, and {{prohibited}} {{the importation of}} slaves in 1808. That same year Fernandina was declared a free port; it began to ship great quantities of Florida cotton and lumber, and became a resort for the smuggling business and contraband slave trade. The town entered a boom period of extraordinary growth, with finer residences and crude shacks springing up next to each other. Vegetable gardens were planted haphazardly about, and <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>were</b> little more than crooked paths. The unsightly and unsanitary condition of Fernandina disturbed Governor White, and on May 10, 1811, two days after Clarke's appointment as surveyor general, he instructed him to plat the town so that <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>were</b> properly aligned and the lots were uniform.|$|E
25|$|In the westward {{development}} of the United States, {{the use of the}} grid plan was nearly universal in the construction of new settlements, such as in Salt Lake City (1870), Dodge City (1872) and Oklahoma City (1890). In these western cities <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>were</b> numbered even more carefully than in the east to suggest future prosperity and metropolitan status.|$|E
5000|$|... 3 Maja Street in Katowice (3 May <b>Street)</b> <b>is</b> a <b>street</b> in <b>the</b> {{centre of}} Katowice. <b>The</b> <b>street</b> <b>was</b> built in <b>the</b> 19th century.
