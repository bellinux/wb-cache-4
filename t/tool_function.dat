50|$|AIPS++ is {{structured}} as {{a library of}} tools at the lower levels, designed to replace AIPS of more monolithic applications. In general, the counterpart of an AIPS task is an AIPS++ <b>tool</b> <b>function,</b> although the toolkit structure of AIPS++ will generally mean that these functions are more fine-grained, except for the more integrated tools at the higher levels (such as map). The counterparts of AIPS adverbs are the parameters of AIPS++tool functions. The command-line interpreter in AIPS is POPS, while the counterpart in AIPS++ is Glish. The code used as standard in most astronomical institutes is still AIPS, as AIPS++ is usually not yet considered sufficiently reliable and usable.|$|E

40|$|Preschool {{children}} (M age = 4 years, 7 months) verbally judged {{whether a}} spoon would function to transport a target object (small versus large candy) and whether a stick would function to stir a target substance (sugar versus gravel). The spoons varied in bowl size, and sticks varied in rigidity. Children’s judgments were sensitive to task goals (transport versus mixing), to tool properties (size and rigidity), and to target properties (size to be transported; resistance to mixing). Moreover, children used appropriate perceptual exploration to determine <b>tool</b> <b>function.</b> Judgments about transport were made after visual {{inspection of the}} spoon, and judgments about rigidity were made after haptic exploration of the stick. Children did not directly perform the task in order to judge whether the tool would be adequate. Differential visual and haptic object exploration during a perceptual-comparison task additionally confirmed the role of perceptual exploration in determining <b>tool</b> <b>function.</b> © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|The Middle Stone Age (MSA) is {{associated}} with early evidence for symbolic material culture and complex technological innovations. However, {{one of the most}} visible aspects of MSA technologies are unretouched triangular stone points that appear in the archaeological record as early as 500, 000 years ago in Africa and persist throughout the MSA. How these tools were being used and discarded across a changing Pleistocene landscape can provide insight into how MSA populations prioritized technological and foraging decisions. Creating inferential links between experimental and archaeological tool use helps to establish prehistoric <b>tool</b> <b>function,</b> but is complicated by the overlaying of post-depositional damage onto behaviorally worn tools. Taphonomic damage patterning can provide insight into site formation history, but may preclude behavioral interpretations of <b>tool</b> <b>function.</b> Here, multiple experimental processes that form edge damage on unretouched lithic points from taphonomic and behavioral processes are presented. These provide experimental distributions of wear on tool edges from known processes that are then quantitatively compared to the archaeological patterning of stone point edge damage from three MSA lithic assemblages [...] Kathu Pan 1, Pinnacle Point Cave 13 B, and Die Kelders Cave 1. By using a model-fitting approach, the results presented here provide evidence for variable MSA behavioral strategies of stone point utilization on the landscape consistent with armature tips at KP 1, and cutting tools at PP 13 B and DK 1, as well as damage contributions from post-depositional sources across assemblages. This study provides a method with which landscape-scale questions of early modern human tool-use and site-use can be addressed...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the model of the static <b>tool</b> influence <b>function</b> (sTIF) of bonnet polishing (BP). Three kinds of sTIF are mathematically modeled, which are static <b>tool</b> influence <b>function</b> of tilted polishing (sTIFt), static <b>tool</b> influence <b>function</b> of discrete precession polishing (sTIFd), and static <b>tool</b> influence <b>function</b> of continuous precession (sTIFc), respectively. Pressure distribution in the contact area is confirmed based on finite element analysis (FEA) technology. A group of experiments to extract the polishing spots have been conducted to verify the accuracy of the sTIF model. Meanwhile, the difference between sTIFd and sTIFc is studied. It turns out that the removal depths of sTIFd and sTIFc are almost the same, and the continuous precession polishing can be replaced by discrete precession polishing to ease control in practical polishing process especially for the aspheric surfaces polishing. ? 2014 Springer-Verlag London...|$|R

40|$|When {{performing}} a goal-directed action with a tool, {{it is generally}} assumed that the point of control of the action system is displaced from the hand to the tool, implying that body and <b>tool</b> <b>function</b> as one system. Studies of how actions with tools are performed have been limited to studying either end-effector kinematics or joint-angle coordination patterns. Because joint-angle coordination patterns affect end-effector kinematics, the current study examined them together, {{with the aim of}} revealing how body and <b>tool</b> <b>function</b> as one system. Seated participants made point-to-point movements with their index finger, and with rods of 10, 20, and 30 cm attached to their index finger. Start point and target were presented on a table in front of them, and in half of the conditions a participant displacement compensated for rod length. Results revealed that the kinematics of the rod’s tip showed higher peak velocity, longer deceleration time, and more curvature with longer rods. End-effector movements were more curved in the horizontal plane when participants were not displaced. Joint-angle trajectories were similar across rod lengths when participants were displaced, whereas more extreme joint-angles were used with longer rods when participants were not displaced. Furthermore, in every condition the end-effector was stabilized to a similar extent; both variability in joint-angle coordination patterns that affected end-effector position and variability that did not affect end-effector position increased in a similar way vis-à-vis rod length. Moreover, the increase was higher in those conditions, in which participants were not displaced. This suggests that during tool use, body and tool are united in a single system so as to stabilize the end-effector kinematics in a similar way that is independent of tool length. In addition, the properties of the actual trajectory of the end-effector, as well as the actual joint-angles used, depend on the length of the tool and the specifics of the task...|$|E
40|$|Plant {{residues}} {{recovered from}} prehistoric stone artifacts {{can be used}} to help explain <b>tool</b> <b>function</b> and plant use. At the Changning site in Qinghai Province, Northwest China, dating from 4000 yr BP, we examined starch granules extracted from three slate stone knives. A total of 153 starch grains were retrieved from three stone knives, from which we identified starches from legumes, the Triticeae tribe, foxtail millet (Setaria italica), broomcorn millet (Panicum miliaceum), roots and tubers. These results indicate that the stone knives may have been used for a variety of activities that included reaping grasses and food processing. The species of starch grains retrieved from the study sample reveal that diverse crops were cultivated at the Changning site 4000 years ago. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|Based on Fogg’s Functional Triad, {{we develop}} {{a model to}} explain how a feature of persuasive {{technologies}} can influence usage intention by shaping an individual’s beliefs {{in regard to the}} Functional Triad. Specifically, we operationalize the Functional Triad by adopting the constructs of perceived usefulness, perceived medium function, and perceived social presence, respectively. We investigate the trade-off transparency of an online decision aid as a persuasive feature of a computing technology. Through an experimental study, the results show that 1) perceived <b>tool</b> <b>function,</b> perceived medium function, and perceived social actor function all significantly influence intention to use a computing technology; 2) trade-off transparency influences the perceptions of these three functions; and 3) the three functions fully mediate the effect of trade-off transparency on usage intention.

40|$|Archaeologists are {{commonly}} interested in material signatures {{that can be}} used to identify past population groups. In the Palaeolithic such population groups are often identified at large spatial scales, yet the material expressions of smaller groups comparable to those documented ethnographically have proved more difficult to isolate. The present paper considers differences in silcrete backed artefacts recovered from two nearby sites. These sites, both of which were occupied during the Howiesons Poort period, are situated in different ecological contexts with variable access to stone resources. Site context does not, however, explain observed differences in technology, nor do potential differences in <b>tool</b> <b>function.</b> Variation is instead inferred to be stylistic, or at least to be adaptively neutral. The results imply occupation of the study area by two different groups maintaining different technological traditions some time around 60, 000 years before present...|$|E
40|$|Inferences of site {{function}} from stone <b>tool</b> <b>function</b> {{based upon}} tool typologies are {{very common in}} the contemporary archaeological literature. A brief review of some ethnographic and archaeological studies confirms the long standing proposition that stone tool shape does not always correlate to the particular function and that some stone tool shapes may have been effective for multiple functions. It is shown that processes such as tool production and tool use as well as situational constraints encountered by tool makers are responsible {{for much of the}} variability in stone tool shape and that these processes and constraints should be accounted for when building stone tool typologies. As a result, it is argued that site functions can not be inferred from artifact functions based upon morphological typologies in all cases. Andrefsky, Jr., William. (1997).
