Through his Princeton classmates, {{he was hired by}} Wall Street insurance firm Johnson & Higgins upon his return to the United States. Soon after, another Princeton graduate offered him a job at J.P. Morgan Bank. Hired onto a two-year trainee program, Baker earned about $20 per week. Baker befriended a rich New York socialite, Percy R. Pyne II, who had also attended St. Paul's and Princeton. Though <b>ten</b> <b>years</b> <b>older</b> <b>than</b> Baker, they quickly became friends and Pyne allowed Baker to stay at his house at 263 Madison Avenue. Pyne later introduced Baker to Jeanne Marie Scott, a socialite known as Mimi, to whom Baker was briefly engaged late in 1918. A quiet individual, Baker was embarrassed when bank executives brought important clients by his office to see him. He quickly tired of working in an office job, and looked for ways to alleviate his boredom.|$|E

40|$|Federal Rule of Evidence (FRE) 609 governs {{admission}} of prior conviction evidence. Under this rule, {{it is easier}} to admit evidence of a prior conviction that is less <b>than</b> <b>ten</b> <b>years</b> <b>old</b> <b>than</b> to admit evidence of <b>older</b> convictions. The <b>ten</b> <b>year</b> period is measured from the later of either the date of conviction or the date of release from confinement. Calculating the <b>ten</b> <b>year</b> period is fairly straightforward in most cases but becomes confusing when the witness has been confined for violating the terms of probation, parole, or some other period of conditional release. Does the confinement for violation of conditional release (VOCR) constitute confinement for the original crime? Should the nature of the violation affect whether the VOCR confinement constitutes confinement for the original crime? Should the <b>ten</b> <b>year</b> clock start over upon release from VOCR confinement? FRE 609 does not answer these questions. This article proposes treating the <b>ten</b> <b>year</b> time period as a statute of limitations which should be tolled for any periods of VOCR confinement. Part I traces the history of FRE 609. Part II evaluates different approaches that have been used to calculate the time period. Part III proposes the statute of limitations approach, illustrating how it avoids the harsh results and inconsistencies that occur with the other approaches. This article concludes that the statute of limitations approach will be easier for courts to apply and is more consistent with the policies underlying the rule than other approaches...|$|R

He eventually secured an assignment with the Intelligence Corps and additional training.

25|$|By {{the spring}} of 1907 {{when he began to}} paint Les Demoiselles d'Avignon, until its {{completion}} later in the year, Picasso was vying with Matisse for the preeminent position of being the perceived new leader of Modern painting. Upon its completion the shock and the impact of the painting propelled Picasso into the center of controversy and all but knocked Matisse and Fauvism off the map, virtually ending the movement by the following year. In 1907 Picasso joined the art gallery that had recently been opened in Paris by Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler (1884–1979). Kahnweiler was a German art historian, art collector who became one of the premier French art dealers of the 20th century. He became prominent in Paris beginning in 1907 for being among the first champions of Pablo Picasso, and especially his painting Les Demoiselles d'Avignon. Before 1910 Picasso was already being {{recognized as one of the}} important leaders of Modern art alongside Henri Matisse who had been the undisputed leader of Fauvism and who was more than <b>ten</b> <b>years</b> <b>older</b> <b>than</b> he was and his contemporaries the Fauvist André Derain and the former Fauvist and fellow Cubist, Georges Braque.|$|E

They lived with great luxury appearing together in Parisian society events and spending time in Biarritz, Deauville and on the French Riviera. Rumors of a possible marriage between them spread in 1925, but Patou, a consummated bachelor, was reluctant to change his lifestyle. In 1926, Kitmirs business began to decline.

Having suffered a defeat, but not surrendering, the grand duchess moved to London in the spring 1928 where she started selling her own perfume, Prince Igor, {{following in the footsteps of}} Chanel No. 5 and Patou's perfume Joy.

40|$|Echinoids, or sea urchins, {{are rare}} in the Palaeozoic fossil record, and thus the details {{regarding}} the early diversification of crown group echinoids are unclear. Here {{we report on the}} earliest probable crown group echinoid from the fossil record, recovered from Permian (Roadian-Capitanian) rocks of west Texas, which has important implications for the timing of the divergence of crown group echinoids. The presence of apophyses and rigidly sutured interambulacral areas with two columns of plates indicates this species is a cidaroid echinoid. The species, Eotiaris guadalupensis, n. sp. is therefore the earliest stem group cidaroid. The occurrence of this species in Roadian strata pushes back the divergence of cidaroids and euechinoids, the clades that comprise all living echinoids, to at least 268. 8 [*]Ma, <b>ten</b> million <b>years</b> <b>older</b> <b>than</b> the previously <b>oldest</b> known cidaroid. Furthermore, the genomic regulation of development in echinoids is amongst the best known, and this new species informs the timing of large-scale reorganization in echinoid gene regulatory networks that occurred at the cidaroid-euechinoid divergence, indicating that these changes took place by the Roadian stage of the Permian...|$|R

500|$|Brigitte François-Sappey {{points out}} the {{frequency}} with which Alkan has been compared to Berlioz, both by his contemporaries and later. She mentions that Hans von Bülow called him [...] "the Berlioz of the piano", while Schumann, in criticising the Op. 15 Romances, claimed that Alkan merely [...] "imitated Berlioz on the piano." [...] She further notes that Ferruccio Busoni repeated the comparison with Berlioz in a draft (but unpublished) monograph, while Kaikhosru Sorabji commented that Alkan's Op. 61 Sonatine was like [...] "a Beethoven sonata written by Berlioz". Berlioz was <b>ten</b> <b>years</b> <b>older</b> <b>than</b> Alkan, but did not attend the Conservatoire until 1826. The two were acquainted, and were perhaps both influenced by the unusual ideas and style of Anton Reicha who taught at the Conservatoire from 1818 to 1836, and by the sonorities of the composers of the period of the French Revolution. They both created individual, indeed, idiosyncratic sound-worlds in their music; there are, however, major differences between them. Alkan, unlike Berlioz, remained closely dedicated to the German musical tradition; his style and composition were heavily determined by his pianism, whereas Berlioz could hardly play at the keyboard and wrote nothing for piano solo. Alkan's works therefore also include miniatures and (among his early works) salon music, genres which Berlioz avoided.|$|E
