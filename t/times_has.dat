A more thorough assessment could not be made because she was dangerously radioactive. Her list gradually increased over the next five days and she capsized during the night of 29/30 July.

They found that living in India, amidst a cosmopolitan community consisting of Hindus, Buddhists, Jains, and, much later, Muslims, was a very cordial environment, totally free of anti-Semitic feelings.|$|E

5|$|When {{the great}} bell rings out every full hour, {{struck by a}} large clockwork-operated hammer, passers-by see a gilded figure in full harness moving its arm to strike it. The larger-than-life figure of bearded Chronos, the Greek {{personification}} of time, is traditionally nicknamed Hans von Thann by the Bernese. The wooden bell-striker, which has been replaced several <b>times,</b> <b>has</b> been a fixture of the Zytglogge since the renewal of the astronomical clock in 1530, whose clockwork also controls the figure's motions. The original wooden Chronos might have been created by master craftsman Albrecht von Nürnberg, while the current and most recent Hans is a 1930 reconstruction of a Baroque original. The bell-striker has been gilded, just like the bells, since 1770.|$|E

5|$|The line {{score is}} {{displayed}} on the guitar's neck, while the ball/strike/out count, the batter's uniform number, and the hit/error indicator are all situated on the headstock. Six small advertising signs represent the tuning keys. The body of the guitar currently features only an LED display board for displaying messages. Initially, the scoreboard featured two matrix message boards: a low-resolution RGB color board on the left which featured advertising and animations, and a white-light monochromatic board on the right, which primarily featured statistical information and other text-based messages. The monochrome board was replaced by an orange-tinted LED display board in 2009 which served both purposes, while the color board was deactivated and covered with advertising signage. The Greer Stadium scoreboard has never {{had the ability to}} display video or any kind of high-resolution images. Between the two boards are an analog clock and a current temperature display. As of 2014, the temperature display is no longer active. Around the boards are four large spaces for advertising; the two on top are static, and the two on bottom rotate between three images each (the rotating spaces have been covered with static signage since 2009). High-tension nets cover the electronic sections to protect them from home run balls. Above the board is a circular advertising space. This space originally displayed the team's guitar-swinger logo, and at <b>times</b> <b>has</b> displayed other Sounds logos. Originally, when a home run was hit, the guitar-swinger logo would light up and perimeter lights around the entire scoreboard would begin flashing; it was also capable of shooting fireworks after each Sounds home run. By the mid-2000s, the scoreboard had fallen into a state of disrepair and obsolescence, and was only marginally functional. Many of the lights were no longer able to be lit, and replacement parts were becoming hard to find. When MFP Baseball purchased the team in late 2008, the organization made minor renovations to the scoreboard, rendering it once again fully functional, although not to its original specifications. It was also repainted black, red, yellow, and white over its original red, white, and blue color scheme to reflect the team's present colors.|$|E
