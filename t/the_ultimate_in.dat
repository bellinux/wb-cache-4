500|$|A {{fighting}} game sequel, Persona 4 Arena, {{known in}} Japan as Persona 4: <b>The</b> <b>Ultimate</b> <b>in</b> Mayonaka Arena, {{was developed by}} Arc System Works, the company known for creating the Guilty Gear and BlazBlue series, and released in 2012 for arcades, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

500|$|Considerable {{work was}} needed to fully develop the design but, by early 1933, {{the two men had}} moved the project through the pre-project, basic {{aerodynamic}} and evaluation stages, including the building of a wooden scale model that Ilić took to Paris to test in the Eiffel-built wind tunnel. Up to this point, the two men had received no outside help, and had been forced to borrow from family to keep the project going. They then decided to approach the head of the technical department of the VVKJ, Potpukovnik (Lieutenant Colonel) Srbobran Stanojević with their design. Stanojević was surprised but impressed with their work and an official report proposing to build the design was presented on 22 September 1933. Some senior VVKJ officers opposed the concept, as did Kapetan (Captain) Leonid Bajdak, an [...] "acknowledged outstanding exponent of fighter tactics", who considered that a biplane with a [...] engine was <b>the</b> <b>ultimate</b> <b>in</b> fighter design.|$|E
500|$|The {{class in}} both {{as-built}} and modified forms has {{been subject to}} a range of divergent opinions. The utilisation of welded steel construction and the various innovations that had not previously been seen in British locomotive design meant that the class earned Bulleid the title [...] "Last Giant of Steam". The constant concern for ease of maintenance and utility had not previously been seen on locomotives of older design, whilst their highly efficient boilers represented <b>the</b> <b>ultimate</b> <b>in</b> British steam technology, the hallmark of a successful locomotive design. Despite this, the number of innovations introduced at the same time made the class unreliable and difficult to maintain during {{the first few years of}} service. Many of these difficulties were overcome during the rebuilding, leading to D.L. Bradley's statement that the modified locomotives were [...] "the finest express locomotives to work in the country". Overall, the class was largely successful, with half of the locomotives completing more than 1 million miles in revenue-earning service.|$|E

500|$|The {{titles of}} games {{have also been}} altered. The banner title for Persona was changed from Megami Ibunroku to Revelations, principally because the team thought the latter title sounded [...] "cool". The Revelations title was removed for Innocent Sin and Eternal Punishment. After the {{successful}} release of Nocturne, the [...] "Shin Megami Tensei" [...] moniker {{was added to the}} series title to help with Western marketing. This has not been the case for some titles: Persona 4 Arenas original title, Persona 4: <b>The</b> <b>Ultimate</b> <b>in</b> Mayonaka Arena, was shortened as it sounded awkward, and the [...] "Shin Megami Tensei" [...] moniker was dropped as it would have made the title too long. The same change was made for Persona 4 Golden, with the team also dropping [...] "The" [...] that was in the Japanese title because it would have looked and sounded odd in Western territories. Persona 5 was also released in the West without the moniker.|$|E

[...] Charlotte Robinson of PopMatters praised {{the inclusion of the}} recording and other Orbit tracks on Madonna's 2001 compilation album, GHV2, for representing [...] "a testament to [...] ability to use gadgets and electronic wizardry not to alienate listeners, but to draw them in". Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine gave an A– grade to the song for its composition, writing that it was [...] "tructured like your average adult contemporary ballad with enough electronic sheen to sound edgy, 'The Power of Goodbye' was <b>the</b> <b>ultimate</b> <b>in</b> electronica-lite." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{family moved}} to Moscow in spring 1943. At {{the time of the}} Eighth Symphony's premiere, the tide had turned for the Red Army. As a consequence, the public, and most {{importantly}} the authorities, wanted another triumphant piece from the composer. Instead, they got the Eighth Symphony, perhaps <b>the</b> <b>ultimate</b> <b>in</b> sombre and violent expression within Shostakovich's output. In order to preserve the image of Shostakovich (a vital bridge {{to the people of the}} Union and to the West), the government assigned the name [...] "Stalingrad" [...] to the symphony, giving it the appearance of a mourning of the dead in the bloody Battle of Stalingrad. However, the symphony did not escape criticism. Its composer is reported to have said: [...] "When the Eighth was performed, it was openly declared counter-revolutionary and anti-Soviet. They said, 'Why did Shostakovich write an optimistic symphony at the beginning of the war and a tragic one now? At the beginning we were retreating and now we're attacking, destroying the Fascists. And Shostakovich is acting tragic, that means he's on the side of the fascists.'" [...] The work was unofficially but effectively banned until 1956.|$|E

500|$|Atlus's senior {{project manager}} Masaru Nanba commented {{it was decided}} that [...] "Shin Megami Tensei" [...] was to be kept in the title of Persona 3 and Persona 4, as it was {{believed}} that {{they were part of the}} same series as however, the [...] "Shin Megami Tensei" [...] title was omitted from both Persona 4 Golden and Persona 4 Arena, as it would have been much too long. Similarly, Persona 4: <b>The</b> <b>Ultimate</b> <b>in</b> Mayonaka Arena and Persona 4: The Golden were shortened to the previously stated titles. As with Persona 3, the honorifics used in the Japanese voice track were retained in the English dub, despite proving contentions among series fans. This was done as part of an intended trend to remain faithful to the original source material. The pronunciations of honorifics, along with the sounds of names, were a point that was carefully considered by the localization team and it took a while for the English cast to get used to them. A member of the English dub that also appeared in Persona 3 was Yuri Lowenthal. Though he had dubbed characters in Persona 3, Namba wanted him to have a larger part. His role as Yosuke ended up featuring 1000 more lines of dialogue than the other major characters. Important roles for the localization team were Teddie and Rise, as they would be the party's supports. Another element in the English script was that the use of swear words was increased over Persona 3: the first draft featured very strong language which was cut as it did not seem suited. The character Kanji was given a lot of swearing in his dialogue, due to his volatile nature. The use of swearing was carefully considered depending on the emotional situation.|$|E

But he did manage to show them as human beings (more than the courtesy they extend to us sinners)." [...] Hilary Fannin of The Irish Times commented that the airing of the documentary, [...] "saw Louis Theroux, in The Most Hated Family in America, shatter another redneck American target, the Westboro Baptist Church". In a review of the documentary for The Sunday Times, Roland White discussed Theroux's stylistic technique, [...] "Theroux's usual technique [...] the friendly ingenue [...] made absolutely no impact on these people. It was like watching a youngster from a village cricket team trying to bowl out Geoff Boycott, and I began to wonder what Theroux was hoping to achieve. It is impossible to outargue the religious bigot. They have impeccable logic on their side: the word of God is the righteous truth; only they understand the true word of the Lord; therefore, they are right and everybody else is wrong." [...] Liverpool Daily Post recommended the film in its column, [...] "Sunday: What to Watch". Writing for the Birmingham Mail, Graham Young observed, [...] "The Most Hated Family in America is the best documentary from Louis since long before his Michael Jackson fiasco." [...] John Dugdale of The Sunday Times highlighted the film as his [...] "Pick of the day". Dugdale wrote favorably of the film, [...] "There are echoes of Theroux's film about a woman raising her daughters as neo-Nazis as he watches Phelps' daughter, Shirley, handing out placards to kids as young as seven. While tangling with her and her dad is pointless, the family's younger women are less inflexible, and his encounters with them are more rewarding." [...] A review in the Leicester Mercury noted of Theroux's interview techniques, [...] "His subtle interviewing style was perfect for showing off the crazy views of the members." ...|$|E
