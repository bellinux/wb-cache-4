5|$|A 2004 {{study by}} Kathryn Thomas and Sandra Carlson used teeth {{from the upper}} jaw of three {{individuals}} interpreted as a juvenile, a subadult, and an adult, recovered from a bone bed in the Hell Creek Formation of Corson County, South Dakota. In this study, successive teeth in columns in the edmontosaurs' dental batteries were sampled from multiple locations along each tooth using a microdrilling system. This sampling method <b>takes</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> organization of hadrosaurid dental batteries to find variation in tooth isotopes {{over a period of}} time. From their work, it appears that edmontosaur teeth took less than about 0.65years to form, slightly faster in younger edmontosaurs. The teeth of all three individuals appeared to show variation in oxygen isotope ratios that could correspond to warm/dry and cool/wet periods; Thomas and Carlson considered the possibility that the animals were migrating instead, but favored local seasonal variations because migration would have more likely led to ratio homogenization, as many animals migrate to stay within specific temperature ranges or near particular food sources.|$|E

5|$|A popular lakon named Irawan Rabi ("Irawan's wedding") {{tells about}} {{the love of}} Irawan and Titisari, a {{daughter}} of Kresna (Krishna). While Titisari is engaged to Irawan, Baladewa (Baladeva), Kresna's brother and an ally of the Kurawas (Kauravas), wants her to marry Lesmana Mandrakumara, the son of Durjudana (Duryodhana), initiating a dramatic conflict.

The Braves discover that Ivy is Raubahn's trusted advisor Eline Roaille, who is captured at the gates of a Garlean Castrum. A new Scion, Moenbryda, arrives from Sharlayan and provides critical advice for locating Iceheart. Using her body as a vessel, Iceheart summons Shiva into herself and challenges the Warrior of Light. Though the adventurer's band defeats Shiva, Iceheart escapes, bidding the meddler to consult with Midgardsormr. Based on the player's encounters with Lahabrea and Shiva, Moenbryda hypothesizes that Ascians may be permanently destroyed by trapping their souls within white auracite and cleaving them with a blast of pure aether, much like Hydaelyn's blade of light. Lucia of the Temple Knights requests that the Warrior of Light investigate suspicious activity at the Keeper of the Lake. At its apex, the adventurer discovers that Midgardsormr lives on, slowly regenerating from his apparent death. He divulges that Nidhogg, one of his seven children, has rallied the Dravanian horde to renew their attack on Ishgard. Sensing the hero's connection to Hydaelyn, Midgardsormr invokes an ancient pact with the Mothercrystal and seals away her blessing as a test of the player's worth.
