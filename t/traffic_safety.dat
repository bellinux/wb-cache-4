5|$|The U.S. National Highway <b>Traffic</b> <b>Safety</b> Administration (NHTSA) is {{conducting}} a study due in 2014 to establish whether lithium-ion batteries in plug-electric vehicles pose a potential fire hazard. The research is looking at whether the high-voltage batteries can cause fires when they are being charged and when the vehicles are involved in an accident. Both General Motors and Nissan have published a guide for firefighters and first responders to properly handle a crashed plug-in electric-drive vehicle and safely disable its battery and other high voltage systems.|$|E
5|$|Things slowly took a {{turn for}} the worse when former Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich's {{decision}} to move a division of I-DOT to Southern Illinois was overturned by his successor Pat Quinn.

Matters were exacerbated when videos of the new home for the IDOT <b>traffic</b> <b>safety</b> division being surrounded by water surfaced on YouTube in late 2007.|$|E

From 1990 to 2009, this number {{has also been}} improving: from 1 death per 3,745 driver's licenses in 1990 to 1 per 6,200 driver's licenses in 2009. Crowded, traffic-choked Northeastern cities including Washington, D.C., Baltimore, Boston, Providence, Philadelphia, Newark, Hartford, New Haven, Springfield and Worcester, Massachusetts, {{were most likely to}} have car accidents.

Controversies regarding the Volt include {{the extent to}} which the U.S. federal government may have participated in the Volt’s development, which continued through General Motors' 2009 government-led bankruptcy, and concerns about the battery pack fire risk following a crash test that the National Highway <b>Traffic</b> <b>Safety</b> Administration (NHTSA) performed on a Volt in 2011. At the completion of its investigation NHTSA concluded that no discernible defect trend exists.|$|E

5|$|A 2009 study {{conducted}} by the U.S. National Highway <b>Traffic</b> <b>Safety</b> Administration found that crashes involving pedestrians and bicyclists have higher incidence rates for hybrid electric vehicles than internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles in low-speed vehicle maneuvers such as reversing or leaving a parking zone. These accidents commonly occurred in zones with low speed limits, during daytime and in clear weather. The study found that a HEV was two {{times more likely to be}} involved in a pedestrian crash than was a conventional ICE vehicle when a vehicle is slowing or stopping, backing up, or entering or leaving a parking space. Vehicle maneuvers were grouped in one category considering those maneuvers that might have occurred at very low speeds where the difference between the sound levels produced by the hybrid versus ICE vehicle is the greatest. Also the study found that the incidence rate of pedestrian crashes in scenarios when vehicles make a turn was significantly higher for HEVs when compared to ICE vehicles. Similarly, The NHTSA study also concluded that the incidence rate of bicyclist crashes involving HEVs for the same kind of maneuvers was significantly higher when compared to conventional vehicles.|$|E
5|$|Occupational {{health and}} safety {{presented}} a challenge, because workers were handling a variety of toxic chemicals, using hazardous liquids and gases under high pressures, and working with high voltages, {{not to mention the}} largely unknown dangers presented by radioactivity and handling fissile materials. Accidents represented unacceptable numbers of work days lost, and a vigorous safety program was instituted. Since it did not matter where accidents occurred, this included safety off the job, in homes and in the schools. Safety indoctrination was included in job training, and safety training courses were held. Safety posters, manuals and films were distributed. In December 1945, the National Safety Council presented the Manhattan Project with the Award of Honor for Distinguished Service to Safety in recognition of its safety record. The Clinton Engineer Works also received an award of merit in the National <b>Traffic</b> <b>Safety</b> Contest. Many workers had to drive long distances over poorly built and inadequately maintained roads. There were 21 deaths from motor vehicles at the Clinton Engineer Works: two in 1943, nine in 1944, eight in 1945 and two in 1946. This represented a better road safety record than other towns of comparable size.|$|E
