5|$|A {{wide range}} of concentrating {{technologies}} exists: among the best known are the parabolic trough, the compact linear Fresnel reflector, the Stirling dish and the solar power tower. Various techniques are used to track the sun and focus light. In all of these systems a working fluid is heated by the concentrated sunlight, and is then used for power generation or energy storage. <b>Thermal</b> <b>storage</b> efficiently allows up to 24-hour electricity generation.|$|E

In this paper, a structure optimization model for large-scale, commercialization solar <b>thermal</b> energy <b>storage</b> system is proposed according to life cycle analysis. Based on the analysis of <b>thermal</b> energy <b>storage</b> medium, <b>thermal</b> energy <b>storage</b> tanks, insulation, bottom bearing structure, pump energy and land use, the optimization of <b>thermal</b> energy <b>storage</b> system is realized.

25|$|Heat storage enables {{solar thermal}} plants to produce {{electricity}} during hours without sunlight. Heat {{is transferred to}} a <b>thermal</b> <b>storage</b> medium in an insulated reservoir during hours with sunlight, and is withdrawn for power generation during hours lacking sunlight. <b>Thermal</b> <b>storage</b> mediums {{will be discussed in}} a heat storage section. Rate of heat transfer is related to the conductive and convection medium as well as the temperature differences. Bodies with large temperature differences transfer heat faster than bodies with lower temperature differences.|$|E
25|$|The {{principal}} {{advantage of}} CSP {{is the ability}} to efficiently add <b>thermal</b> <b>storage,</b> allowing the dispatching of electricity over up to a 24-hour period. Since peak electricity demand typically occurs at about 5pm, many CSP power plants use 3 to 5hours of <b>thermal</b> <b>storage.</b> With current technology, storage of heat is much cheaper and more efficient than storage of electricity. In this way, the CSP plant can produce electricity day and night. If the CSP site has predictable solar radiation, then the CSP plant becomes a reliable power plant. Reliability can further be improved by installing a back-up combustion system. The back-up system can use most of the CSP plant, which decreases the cost of the back-up system.|$|E

40|$|AbstractLatent heat <b>thermal</b> energy <b>storage</b> in {{metallic}} {{phase change}} materials offers a <b>thermal</b> energy <b>storage</b> concept that can store energy at higher temperatures than with sensible <b>thermal</b> energy <b>storage.</b> This may enable {{the use of}} high efficiency thermodynamic cycles in CSP applications, which {{may lead to a}} reduction in levelised cost of electricity. Eutectic aluminum silicon alloy, AlSi 12, is an attractive phase change material because of its moderate melting temperature, high thermal conductivity, and high heat of fusion. A prototype <b>thermal</b> energy <b>storage</b> test rig has been built and tested as to better understand the behavior of latent heat <b>thermal</b> energy <b>storage.</b> A mathematical model was developed to predict the behavior of such a heat storage unit. The model was compared with the behavior of the test rig during discharge. The model proved to simulate the latent heat <b>thermal</b> energy <b>storage</b> with reasonable accuracy.

25|$|Another {{method to}} store {{heat in a}} {{hot water storage tank}} has many names: Stratified hot water storage tank with closed water circuit, {{stratified}} <b>thermal</b> <b>storage,</b> thermocline tank and water stratified tank storage but in all cases the significant difference is that pains are taken to maintain the vertical stratification of the water column, in other words to keep the hot water {{at the top of the}} tank while the water at the bottom is at a distinctly lower temperature.|$|E
25|$|The {{extent to}} which the intermittency of solar-generated {{electricity}} is an issue will depend on {{the degree to which the}} generation profile of solar corresponds to demand. For example, solar thermal power plants such as Nevada Solar One are somewhat matched to summer peak loads in areas with significant cooling demands, such as the south-western United States. Thermal energy storage systems like the small Spanish Gemasolar Thermosolar Plant can improve the match between solar supply and local consumption. The improved capacity factor using <b>thermal</b> <b>storage</b> represents a decrease in maximum capacity, and extends the total time the system generates power.|$|E
