5|$|A {{few months}} after the Nazi seizure of power in Germany in January 1933, Eichmann lost his job due to {{staffing}} cutbacks at Vacuum Oil. The Nazi Party was banned in Austria around the same time. <b>These</b> <b>events</b> were factors in Eichmann's decision to return to Germany.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} events {{had taken place in}} and around Jena in the months before the Barker assault, which the media have {{associated}} with an alleged escalation of local racial tensions. <b>These</b> <b>events</b> included the hanging of rope nooses from a tree in the high school courtyard, two violent confrontations between white and black youths, and the destruction by fire of the main building of Jena High School. Extensive news coverage related to the Jena Six often reported <b>these</b> <b>events</b> as linked. Federal and parish attorneys concluded from their investigations that assessment was inaccurate for some of the events; for instance, the burning of the high school was an attempt to destroy grade records.|$|E

5|$|Controversy {{has emerged}} during the {{funerals}} and weddings {{of members of the}} Japanese Imperial Family, as they present a merging of Shinto and state functions. The Japanese treasury does not pay for <b>these</b> <b>events,</b> which preserves the distinction between state and shrine functions.|$|E
5|$|Despite <b>these</b> <b>events,</b> Pisander and {{the other}} envoys of the conspirators arrived at Athens and made a speech before the people. Pisander won the argument, putting Alcibiades and his {{promises}} at the center. The Ecclesia deposed Phrynichus and elected Pisander and ten other envoys to negotiate with Tissaphernes and Alcibiades.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the wide}} range of astrophysical {{consequences}} of <b>these</b> <b>events,</b> astronomers now deem supernovae research, across the fields of stellar and galactic evolution, as an especially important area for investigation.|$|E
50|$|The {{brains of}} EEM are <b>event</b> {{detectors}}. <b>These</b> <b>event</b> detectors are built-in capabilities {{to watch for}} specific situations or conditions. Newer versions of EEM have more event detectors than older ones.|$|R

During <b>these</b> <b>events,</b> the structural components of the nucleus — the envelope and lamina — can be systematically degraded.|$|E
5|$|During the 1994 Winter Olympics, Hamar Olympic Amphitheatre {{was used}} for figure skating and short track speed skating. It hosted 13 events, drawing an average of 5,554 spectators. Storhamar Ishall {{was used for}} warming up and {{training}} to <b>these</b> <b>events.</b>|$|E
5|$|Host nation Canada won {{all four}} of the {{exhibition}} events. Jenna Marks won three of <b>these</b> <b>events</b> (C-1 200 m, C-2 200 m, C-2 500 m). Other nations with top three finishes included Brazil, Ecuador, Great Britain and the United States.|$|E

50|$|Stina Cronholm (later Onsö, born 18 April 1936) is {{a retired}} Swedish athlete who won {{national}} titles in the 80 m hurdles (1953-57) and pentathlon (1953-58). She competed in <b>these</b> <b>event</b> at the 1954 and 1958 European Athletics Championships and placed 16th-18th.|$|R
5|$|In 1940, Gifu {{absorbed the}} former post town of Kanō, greatly {{increasing}} its land area. Kanō had many traditional industries, which helped improve Gifu's overall industrial strength. With the neighboring city of Kakamigahara {{serving as an}} aeronautics center for Japan, Gifu was a large industrial center during World War II, including a downtown manufacturing sector. As a result, Gifu {{was the target of}} heavy firebombing by the United States Army Air Forces, culminating in the Gifu Air Raid of July 9, 1945, which resulted in 1,383 casualties (863 dead, 520 injured) and 20,426 buildings affected. Gifu commemorates <b>these</b> <b>events</b> each year on July 9, with the ringing of the Peace Bell at each temple within the city. Its sister cities also take part in <b>these</b> <b>events.</b>|$|E

500|$|<b>These</b> two <b>events</b> were contested {{only at the}} 1900 Summer Games. The IOC website {{currently}} has affirmed a total of 95 medal events, after accepting, as it appears, the recommendation of Olympic historian Bill Mallon regarding events {{that should be considered}} [...] "Olympic". <b>These</b> additional <b>events</b> include the hacks and hunter combined event and the mail coach event.

50|$|The latest {{research}} {{concludes that the}} Jökulsárgljúfur canyon was formed by three flooding <b>events.</b> <b>These</b> key <b>events</b> occurred two, five and nine thousand years ago, separated by millennia of relative stability.|$|R
5|$|It {{was common}} for Christie to greet a {{returning}} submarine at the pier, and to award decorations {{to the crew}} on the spot. This bypassed naval award boards, and annoyed Kinkaid and Lockwood, possibly because confirmation of sinkings was accomplished by Ultra, the reading of coded Japanese radio traffic, and news of awards given so quickly could constitute a security breach. Complicating the matter was the fact MacArthur awarded army decorations to naval personnel; like Christie, he {{took it upon himself}} to authorize the decorations rather than to go through the standard review procedures. <b>These</b> <b>events</b> compelled Kinkaid to forbid Christie to give pierside awards, and to keep Christie from recommending the award of army medals to navy personnel. <b>These</b> <b>events</b> would ultimately contribute to Christie's dismissal as Commander of Submarines in Fremantle.|$|E
5|$|Research {{focused on}} four {{individual}} days that accumulated more than 5.9 inches (15cm) of hail in 30 {{minutes on the}} Colorado front range has shown that <b>these</b> <b>events</b> share similar patterns in observed synoptic weather, radar, and lightning characteristics, suggesting the possibility of predicting <b>these</b> <b>events</b> prior to their occurrence. A fundamental problem in continuing {{research in this area}} is that, unlike hail diameter, hail depth is not commonly reported. The lack of data leaves researchers and forecasters in the dark when trying to verify operational methods. A cooperative effort between the University of Colorado and the National Weather Service is in progress. The joint project's goal is to enlist the help of the general public to develop a database of hail accumulation depths.|$|E
5|$|Since <b>these</b> <b>events,</b> Glacier Peak has {{produced}} several lahars. The largest events were 5,900 and 1,800 {{years ago and}} were associated with dome-building eruptions. In both cases, the lahars traveled down the Skagit River to Puget Sound.|$|E
