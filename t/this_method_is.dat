5|$|Finally some sharks {{maintain}} a placental {{link to the}} developing young, <b>this</b> <b>method</b> <b>is</b> called viviparity. This is more analogous to mammalian gestation than that of other fishes. The young are born alive and fully functional. Hammerheads, the requiem sharks (such as the bull and blue sharks), and smoothhounds are viviparous.|$|E

5|$|If oral {{medications}} and mechanical treatments fail, the second choice is local injections: medications such as papaverine and prostaglandin that alter the blood flow and trigger erection are {{injected into the}} penis. <b>This</b> <b>method</b> <b>is</b> preferred for its effectiveness, but can cause pain and scarring.|$|E
5|$|It {{can also}} be {{produced}} by oxidising the ephedrine analogue 4-methylephedrine using potassium permanganate dissolved in sulfuric acid. Because 4-methylephedrine can be obtained in a specific enantiomeric form, mephedrone consisting of only one enantiomer can be produced. The danger associated with <b>this</b> <b>method</b> <b>is</b> it may cause manganese poisoning if the product is not correctly purified.|$|E
5|$|Re-wilding cattle, which {{involves}} increasing the natural protective tendencies of cattle, {{is a method}} for controlling coyotes discussed by Temple Grandin of Colorado State University. <b>This</b> <b>method</b> <b>is</b> gaining popularity among producers who allow their herds to calve on the range and whose cattle graze open pastures throughout the year.|$|E

5|$|Another popular {{method of}} growing {{synthetic}} diamond is {{chemical vapor deposition}} (CVD). The growth occurs under low pressure (below atmospheric pressure). It involves feeding a mixture of gases (typically 1 to 99 methane to hydrogen) into a chamber and splitting them to chemically active radicals in a plasma ignited by microwaves, hot filament, arc discharge, welding torch or laser. <b>This</b> <b>method</b> <b>is</b> mostly used for coatings, but can also produce single crystals several millimeters in size (see picture).|$|E

5|$|Gas {{tungsten}} {{arc welding}} (GTAW), or {{tungsten inert gas}} (TIG) welding, is a manual welding process that uses a nonconsumable tungsten electrode, an inert or semi-inert gas mixture, and a separate filler material. Especially useful for welding thin materials, <b>this</b> <b>method</b> <b>is</b> characterized by a stable arc and high quality welds, but it requires significant operator skill and can only be accomplished at relatively low speeds.|$|E
5|$|Gliders {{are often}} {{launched}} using a stationary ground-based winch {{mounted on a}} heavy vehicle. <b>This</b> <b>method</b> <b>is</b> widely used at many European clubs, often {{in addition to an}} aerotow service. The engine is usually powered by LPG, petrol or diesel, though hydraulic fluid engines and electrical motors are also used. The winch pulls in a 1,000 to 2,500-metre (3,000 to 7,500ft) cable, made of high-tensile steel wire or a synthetic fiber, attached to the glider. The cable is released at a height of about 35% of the cable length after a short, steep ride. A strong headwind will result in higher launches.|$|E
5|$|Invasive {{measures}} include electrocorticography, {{which uses}} electrodes placed {{directly on the}} exposed surface of the brain. <b>This</b> <b>method</b> <b>is</b> used in cortical stimulation mapping, {{used in the study}} of the relationship between cortical areas and their systemic function. By using much smaller microelectrodes, single-unit recordings can be made from a single neuron that give a high spatial resolution and high temporal resolution. This has enabled the linking of brain activity to behaviour, and the creation of neuronal maps.|$|E

5|$|Nowadays, using {{oscilloscopes}} {{with time}} resolutions {{of less than}} one nanosecond, {{the speed of light}} can be directly measured by timing the delay of a light pulse from a laser or an LED reflected from a mirror. <b>This</b> <b>method</b> <b>is</b> less precise (with errors of the order of 1%) than other modern techniques, but it is sometimes used as a laboratory experiment in college physics classes.|$|E
5|$|Ports use Makefile to {{automatically}} fetch the desired application's source code, either {{from a local}} or remote repository, unpack it on the system, apply patches to it and compile it. Depending {{on the size of}} the source code, compiling can take a long time, but it gives the user more control over the process and its result. Most ports also have package counterparts (i.e. pre-compiled binaries), giving the user a choice. Although <b>this</b> <b>method</b> <b>is</b> faster, the user has fewer customisation options.|$|E
5|$|Sodium is now {{produced}} commercially {{through the}} electrolysis of molten sodium chloride, {{based on a}} process patented in 1924. This is done in a Downs cell in which the NaCl is mixed with calcium chloride to lower the melting point below 700°C.

5|$|The {{synthesis}} of aspirin {{is classified as}} an esterification reaction. Salicylic acid is treated with acetic anhydride, an acid derivative, causing a chemical reaction that turns salicylic acid's hydroxyl group into an ester group (R-OH → R-OCOCH3).

Small amounts of sulfuric acid (and occasionally phosphoric acid) are almost always used as a catalyst. <b>This</b> <b>method</b> <b>is</b> commonly employed in undergraduate teaching labs.|$|E
