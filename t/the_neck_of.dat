5|$|In {{order to}} support the robust head, <b>the</b> <b>neck</b> <b>of</b> Hatzegopteryx was likely {{strongly}} muscled. On the occipital bones, the nuchal lines, which serve as muscular attachments, are very well-developed and bear prominent scars. These conceivably supported the transversospinalis muscles, which aid in extension and flexion {{of the head and}} neck. Likewise, the opisthotic process, neural spines, and zygapophyses all appeared to have been large and robust (with the latter bearing many pits and edges that likely represent muscle scars), and the basioccipital tuberosities were long; these all serve as points of attachment for various muscles of the head and neck. Although not entirely unmuscled, <b>the</b> <b>neck</b> <b>of</b> Arambourgiania probably would not have been as extensively muscled as that of Hatzegopteryx.|$|E
5|$|Matthew Cobley et al. (2013) dispute this, {{finding that}} large muscles and {{cartilage}} would have limited {{movement of the}} neck. They state the feeding ranges for sauropods like Diplodocus were smaller than previously believed, and the animals may have had to move their whole bodies around to better access areas where they could browse vegetation. As such, they might have spent more time foraging to meet their minimum energy needs. The conclusions of Cobley etal. are disputed by Taylor, who analyzed the amount and positioning of intervertebral cartilage to determine the flexibility of <b>the</b> <b>neck</b> <b>of</b> Apatosaurus and Diplodocus. He found that <b>the</b> <b>neck</b> <b>of</b> Apatosaurus was very flexible.|$|E

5|$|Parathyroid glands {{are small}} {{endocrine}} glands in <b>the</b> <b>neck</b> <b>of</b> humans and other tetrapods that produce parathyroid hormone.

5|$|A new guitar {{controller}} {{was developed}} for Guitar Hero 5, sold with bundles with the game though the option for standalone versions {{has not yet been}} determined. Like other Guitar Hero controllers, the guitar-shaped unit features five colored fret buttons on <b>the</b> <b>neck</b> <b>of</b> the guitar, a strum bar to mimic the act of strumming, a whammy bar to alter the pitch of a note, and additional buttons specific to the game console for maneuvering through the game's menus. The unit is mostly a redesign of the World Tour model with a new red finish and includes the touchpad that is farther up <b>the</b> <b>neck</b> <b>of</b> the controller, allowing the player to play notes via tapping or to slide along its surface for specially marked sections on the note track. The Guitar Hero 5 unit features a more accurate and responsive touchpad due to it being tracked digitally and with added tactile responses, a more accurate strum bar, and a controller finish that makes it easier to handle with sweaty hands. The game remains compatible with previous Guitar Hero game controllers as well as those from Rock Band and selected other rhythm games.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>neck</b> <b>of</b> Tyrannosaurus rex {{formed a}} natural S-shaped curve {{like that of}} other theropods, but was short and muscular to support the massive head. The forelimbs had only two clawed fingers, along with an {{additional}} small metacarpal representing the remnant of a third digit. In contrast the hind limbs were among the longest in proportion to body size of any theropod. The tail was heavy and long, sometimes containing over forty vertebrae, in order to balance the massive head and torso. To compensate for the immense bulk of the animal, many bones throughout the skeleton were hollow, reducing its weight without significant loss of strength.|$|E

5|$|The pillars {{that support}} {{the roof of the}} mantapa are {{monolithic}} shafts from the base up to <b>the</b> <b>neck</b> <b>of</b> the capital. Therefore, the height of the mantapa and the overall size of the temple were limited by the length of the stone shafts that the architects were able to obtain from the quarries. The height of the temple was also constrained by the weight of the superstructure on the walls and, since Chalukyan architects did not use mortar, by the use of dry masonry and bonding stones without clamps or cementing material.|$|E
5|$|Few {{other details}} are {{known about the}} singer's childhood. At some point he met another blind musician, Madkin Butler, who had a {{powerful}} singing and preaching style that influenced Johnson's own vocal delivery and repertoire. Adam Booker, a blind minister interviewed by the blues historian Samuel Charters in the 1950s, recalled that while visiting his father in Hearne, Johnson would perform religious songs on street corners with a tin cup tied to <b>the</b> <b>neck</b> <b>of</b> his Stella guitar to collect money. Occasionally, Johnson would play on the same street as Blind Lemon Jefferson, but {{the extent of the}} two songsters' involvement with each other is unknown. In 1926 or early 1927, Johnson established an unregistered marriage with Willie B. Harris, who occasionally sang on the street with him and at benefits for the Marlin Church of God in Christ with Johnson accompanied on piano. From the relationship, Johnson had a daughter, Sam Faye Johnson Kelly, in 1931. The blues guitarist L. C. Robinson recalled that his sister Anne also claimed to have been married to Johnson in the late 1920s.|$|E
5|$|If a {{cerebral}} aneurysm is identified on angiography, two measures {{are available to}} reduce the risk of further bleeding from the same aneurysm: clipping and coiling. Clipping requires a craniotomy (opening of the skull) to locate the aneurysm, followed by the placement of clips around <b>the</b> <b>neck</b> <b>of</b> the aneurysm. Coiling is performed through the large blood vessels (endovascularly): a catheter is inserted into the femoral artery in the groin and advanced through the aorta to the arteries (both carotid arteries and both vertebral arteries) that supply the brain. When the aneurysm has been located, platinum coils are deployed that cause a blood clot to form in the aneurysm, obliterating it. The decision as to which treatment is undertaken is typically made by a multidisciplinary team consisting of a neurosurgeon, neuroradiologist, and often other health professionals.|$|E

5|$|A 2015 study <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>necks</b> <b>of</b> Apatosaurus and Brontosaurus {{found many}} {{differences}} between them and other diplodocids, and that these variations may have shown that <b>the</b> <b>necks</b> <b>of</b> Apatosaurus and Brontosaurus were used for intraspecific combat. Various uses for the single claw on the forelimb of sauropods have been proposed. One suggestion {{is that they were}} used for defense, but their shape and size make this unlikely. It was also possible they were for feeding, but the most probable use for the claw was grasping objects such as tree trunks when rearing.|$|R
50|$|In 2013, a study led by Matthew J. Cobley and {{published}} in PLOS ONE focused on <b>the</b> flexibility <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>necks</b> <b>of</b> sauropods. They compared <b>the</b> <b>necks</b> <b>of</b> ostriches with sauropod genera {{to find out how}} flexible <b>the</b> <b>necks</b> really were. <b>The</b> study noted that previous biomechanics studies found <b>the</b> <b>necks</b> to have been positioned between the extremes of a vertical, and a downward slanted <b>neck.</b> In conclusion, <b>the</b> study found that sauropod neck flexibility should not be based on osteology alone, and if it is, the results should be used with caution. Even though {{there is a lack of}} preserved muscle tissue that would determine flexibility, sauropod necks were probably less flexible than previously thought.|$|R
5|$|In 1984 he was {{nominated}} for an Olivier Award and was joint Best Newcomer in the Plays and Players Awards for his performance as Lennie in Of Mice and Men.

5|$|In 1994 {{the general}} {{design of the}} {{banknotes}} was reviewed {{to keep up with}} advancing technologies against counterfeiting, which resulted in the release of two new denominations ($50 and $100) between 1994 and 1995, also to counter the effects of consumer price inflation, which peaked at 41.6% in 1992. Although the Chiremba Balancing Rocks were retained, other features including latent imaging in which the letters RBZ can be seen when the banknote is tilted horizontally at the eye level and identification marks for the visually impaired were added to the design, and <b>the</b> <b>neck</b> <b>of</b> the Zimbabwe Bird watermark was longer. The $5, $10 and $20 banknotes were also revised with the new designs in 1997, whilst the $2 banknote was and replaced by a coin in the same year with the $5 denomination undergoing the same process in August 2001.|$|E
5|$|Males {{are sexually}} mature {{by the time}} they are a year old, though {{successful}} mating generally occurs only after four years. Mature males start establishing territories and try to gain access to females. Females can conceive after they are {{a year and a half}} old; oestrus lasts for 24 to 48 hours, and occurs every 12–29 days in non-pregnant females. The annual three-week-long rut (breeding season) begins toward the end of the wet season, typically in May. Gonadal growth and hormone production in males begin a few months before the breeding season, resulting in greater aggressiveness and territoriality. The bulbourethral glands are heavier, testosterone levels are nearly twice as high in territorial males as in bachelors, and <b>the</b> <b>neck</b> <b>of</b> a territorial male tends to be thicker than that of a bachelor during the rut. Mating tends to take place between full moons.|$|E
