5|$|The Glen Yards {{project has}} been {{controversial}} due to local opposition to the project, environmental issues, {{and the cost of}} the project itself.

5|$|A {{more ambitious}} plan by Butlin was thought up {{on a trip}} to the Bahamas in 1946. Seeing {{potential}} for a camp in warmer climes, he formed a company under the chairmanship of Sir Bede Edmund Hugh Clifford and bought land in Grand Bahama. Butlin also purchased the Princess hotel in Bermuda and the Fort Montagu beach hotel in Nassau. The camp was intended <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>complete</b> and open on New Years Day of 1950. After an investment of US$5 million (2011:£) the camp opened, still only partially complete, in the winter of 1949. To celebrate its opening, Butlin ran a mystery flight, where guests, who had paid $129 (2011:£) each, were taken on a flight to the resort without being informed in advance.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in March 2013, the {{majority}} of the airline's fleet will be retrofitted with new Business and Economy Class seats. The seats are nearly identical to the new Regional Business Class and new Long-haul Economy Class products offered by parent company Cathay Pacific. Seats in both classes will be fitted with StudioKA (a rebranded version of the StudioCX inflight entertainment system on board Cathay Pacific aircraft), which features a 12.1-inch (Business Class) or 9-inch (Economy Class) touchscreen display, Audio/Video on Demand (AVOD), support for iOS devices, and a USB port for connectivity to other devices. In-seat power outlets will be available to all passengers. The new Business Class will feature a 21-inch wide recliner seat with 45 inches (narrowbody aircraft) or 47 inches (widebody aircraft) of pitch, while the new Economy Class will be 18.1 inches wide with 30 inches (narrowbody aircraft) or 32 inches (widebody aircraft) of pitch.

5|$|By {{the end of}} the year, {{plans were}} being made for {{construction}} of the freeway between Flume Drive east of El Cajon and Laguna Junction, and the portion of the freeway from Fairmount Avenue to Lake Murray Boulevard was contracted for $2.6 million. In January 1960, the Taylor Street to Cabrillo Freeway portions were under construction, including the interchange at the latter, and were scheduled <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>complete</b> by October, while the Cabrillo Freeway to Fairmout Avenue portion was up for bid; the next month, the contract was awarded for $4.6 million, with interchanges to be constructed at Texas Street and Ward Road to replace traffic signals. In July, the new I-8 designation for the road was announced, and plans to post signs were made. Another contract for the portion from Grossmont Summit near Chase Avenue to Ballantyne Avenue was awarded for $2.7 million in November.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) {{officials}} announced their long-term plan {{to prevent further}} traffic jams. They will create a series of loops and overpasses allowing traffic to go directly from southbound Route32 to the Thruway and remove some traffic lights {{in front of the}} mall. The changes were expected <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>complete</b> by 2011, as part of improvements to convert the Route17 expressway into I-86. However, in 2009 they were postponed due to funding constraints. Work was slated to begin in 2013, but just before it could start Governor Andrew Cuomo redirected the money to repair projects elsewhere in the state. The project was put on indefinite hold in 2014 until it could be funded.|$|E
5|$|In the 1953 New Jersey {{state highway}} renumbering, which {{eliminated}} several concurrencies between U.S. and state routes, the designations of routes 25, 43, and 56 {{were removed from}} US30. Prior to the completion of I-676 across the Ben Franklin Bridge in the 1970s, US30 used Penn Street eastbound and Linden Street westbound to travel between the bridge and Admiral Wilson Boulevard. In the late 1960s, a freeway was proposed for US30 in Camden County by the Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission. The freeway, which was to cost $40million, was to run from the Ben Franklin Bridge to I-295 in Barrington with a $16million extension to the planned Route90 freeway in Berlin. The segment between Camden and Barrington was <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>complete</b> by 1975 while the extension to Berlin was to be finished by 1985. However, the NJDOT did not build this US30 freeway. In 2009, the Collingswood Circle at {{the eastern end of}} the US130 concurrency was replaced with an at-grade intersection with jughandles.|$|E

5|$|Just {{two and a}} {{half months}} later, though, the MTA stated that it was unable to open the subway {{extension}} for service until April to July 2015, due to the failure to get the inclined elevators to work properly. Problems with the security and fire alarm systems were also blamed for the delays. A December 2014 New York Post article attributed the delay to Hudson Yards' developer, The Related Companies', need to dig caissons for the foundations, just above the subway station, and the foundation work needed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>complete</b> before the MTA could open the station. Continuing trouble with the fire and security alarms in March 2015 would delay the opening until summer.|$|E
5|$|The New York State Department of Transportation has {{scheduled}} for NY28N to undergo construction in spring 2013, to rehabilitate the {{bridge over the}} Upper Hudson River Railroad. The $5.9million project is projected <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>complete</b> in fall of 2015, and is to be supported by state and federal funds. New York State Department of Transportation has also planned for NY28N's bridge over Stillwater Brook in Minerva to be replaced with a stronger structure. The development of the project {{is expected to take}} place 2014, with bids and construction starting in 2016. The project has been set to end in 2017, and is predicted to cost $1.1million of federal and state funds.|$|E
5|$|The {{cost was}} $490 million (equivalent to $ million today) to build , 40 times {{the average cost}} per mile {{predicted}} by the planners of the Interstate Highway system. This figure exceeded that of Interstate 15 through the Virgin River Gorge, which was previously proclaimed the most expensive rural freeway in the United States. The construction of I-70 through Glenwood Canyon earned 30 awards for the Colorado Department of Transportation, including the 1993 Outstanding Civil Engineering Achievement Award from the American Society of Civil Engineers. At the dedication it was claimed that I-70 through Glenwood Canyon was the final piece of the Interstate Highway System to open to traffic. For this reason, the system was proclaimed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>complete.</b> However, as of 2009, at least two sections of the original Interstate Highway System have not been constructed: a section of Interstate 95 in central New Jersey, and a section of I-70 in Breezewood, Pennsylvania.|$|E
