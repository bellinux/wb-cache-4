2500|$|The {{completion}} of the screenplay, concerned Sparks that Cyrus {{would not be able}} to successfully execute the role: [...] "The first thing I thought when I finished the screenplay was, wow, I hope she can do this, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>tough</b> role because I'm bringing you through a whole gamut of emotion and you're just a 16-year-old girl who's done the Disney Channel. Are you able to do this as an actress?", After visiting the set and watching Cyrus film, Sparks' worries abated. To play the New York teen, Cyrus worked with a dialect coach to lose her Southern accent and learned to play classical piano. After she completed filming, Cyrus said that in a case of life imitating art, she had matured and [...] "changed a lot" [...] over the course of her summer in Georgia, similar to the way Ronnie does in the film.

After she began penning tracks for the likes of Cher Lloyd, Susan Boyle, Alexandra Burke and Leona Lewis who are all signed to Cowell's record label, Syco Music. She also revealed that it was never an option to go out and sing other artists' songs which they had written for her. She wanted the whole album to be her own, and every song to be written by herself. She said [...] "For me to feel empowered by music, it has to be my own. The message that the lyric carries is as important to me as singing in tune. Not everyone is a writer or wants to be, so shows like that can be a great way of getting exposure – and as we're all aware, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>tough</b> industry to break into. I just know I'd have found it very difficult to go out and sing other people's songs week after week, though. It simply wouldn't have felt truthful." ...|$|E

In a stark contrast, the Reserves side, captained by Brett [...] "Billy" [...] Stevens, won the Premiership. The side included many players still playing junior football, such as Tim Plummer, Greg Stirling and Brendan Stirling.

50|$|Liquidation is {{the hardest}} {{strategy}} to perform by a company because it means that it went into bankruptcy.

In this case, the unique solution is to sell all the company's assets in small parts to shareholders, stakeholders or other companies that are economically solvent. Although <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>tough</b> decision, it is better to stop the operational chaos instead of continuing losing more money.|$|E

Then, white-reds faced amateurs from Great Britain. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>tougher</b> opponent, but again - no players from English or Scottish {{professional}} teams were fielded. The only athlete who eventually turned pro was Bernard Joy, later representing Arsenal London. This game, which took place on August 8, <b>was</b> <b>a</b> show of two players - Gerard Wodarz (who scored 3 goals, with additional strikes by Hubert Gad and Ryszard Piec) and Joy, who netted twice. Poland won 5-4, but the match was very nail-biting. It is {{enough to say that}} at some point the Poles were winning 5-1, only then to let 3 goals. Fortunately, the British did not have enough time to tie.|$|R
25|$|At the {{commencement}} of the Second World War in 1939, Collishaw was promoted to Air Commodore and took over as Air Officer Commanding, No. 204 Group ("Egypt Group") in North Africa.

Soon after the war started Collishaw's men were off the mark quickly, striking at an Italian airbase destroying 18 aircraft within two days of {{the commencement}} of hostilities with only three aircraft losses. He then turned their efforts to bombing harbours, ships and troops {{to hold up the}} reinforcement of North Africa. They sunk the Italian cruiser San Giorgio and blew up an ammo dump.|$|R

50|$|Hughes was upbeat at the {{beginning}} of the tour:We are not going to win Tests against their pace attack by just playing shots - we must physically defend our wickets right from one to 11. The experienced ones know the need - and newcomers like Steve Smith and Dean Jones have learned quickly. You only have to recall Dean Jones, without a helmet, advancing down the wicket to confront Michael Holding to see the spirit in the side... A big factor is that I think we are a fitter line-up than the Windies after their Australian tour. And how much longer can Clive Lloyd keep going too?... We go as underdogs - I think that's an advantage... We haven't won a series overseas since 1975 and <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>tough</b> challenge for us. But there is no doubting the cricket ability in the squad - but we must cope with conditions arising out of living away from home. They know they have to consider a total of 350 to 400 runs every time we go to the crease.|$|E

[...] With a handful of gigs already scheduled for the next few months (including the Stingray Body Art fifth anniversary party, also at Harpers Ferry, and the 2010 Boston Freedom Rally), Matalon scrambled to seal up a lot of the gaps left by Gardner's absence and power on, with the intention of eventually finding a replacement for Jay. To this day, Matalon remains a three-piece with Eskola on bass, Scott on guitar and vocals, and Craig on drums.
