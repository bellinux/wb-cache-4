The design repetition rate is 20 s. The switch is composed of ten Fast High Current Thyristors (FHCTs), which are modified symmetric 4. 5 kV GTO thyristors of WESTCODE. Recent studies aiming at improving the <b>turn-on</b> <b>delay,</b> switching speed and at decreasing the switch losses, have led to test an asymmetric not fully optimised GTO thyristor of WESTCODE and an optimised device of GEC PLESSEY Semiconductor (GPS), GB. The GPS FHCT, which gave the best results, is a non irradiated device of 64 mm diameter with a hold-off voltage of 4. 5 kV like the symmetric FHCT. Tests results of the GPS FHCT show a reduction in <b>turn-on</b> <b>delay</b> of 40 % and in switching losses of almost 50 % {{with respect to the}} symmetric FHCT of WESTCODE.

The optical technology is an excellent candidate for on-board systems due to the potential weight saving and EMC immunity. According to the short length of the link and a cost saving, Vertical Cavity Surface Emitting Laser (VCSEL) and multimode fiber are the best solution for gigabit systems. In this context, we propose a modeling of 850 nm VCSEL based on the rate equations analysis to predict the optical interconnect performances (jitter, bit error rate). Our aim is to define the operation conditions of VCSEL under large signal modulation {{in order to maximize}} the Extinction Ratio (current IOFF below threshold) without affecting link performances. The VCSEL model is developed to provide large signal modulation response. Biasing below threshold causes stochastic <b>turn-on</b> <b>delay.</b> Fluctuations of this delay occur, due to the spontaneous emission. This leads to additional turn-on jitter. These stochastic effects are included in the model by adding the Langevin photon and electron noise sources. The VCSEL behavior under high-speed modulation is studied to observe the transient response and extract the resonance frequency, overshoot and <b>turn-on</b> <b>delay.</b> The associated jitter is evaluated with the standard deviation of the <b>turn-on</b> <b>delay</b> probability density function.

Weight saving and Electromagnetic Interference withstanding requirements {{have led to}} the need of a reliable solution to improve existing avionics high speed buses (e. g.

First, a theoretical study is performed through the rate equations adapted to VCSEL in large signal modulation. Averaged turn-on delays and oscillation effects are analytically computed and analyzed for different values of the on - and off state currents. This will affect the eye pattern, timing jitter and Bit Error Rate (BER) of the signal that must remain within IEEE 802. 3 standard limits. In particular, the off-state current is minimized below the threshold to allow the highest possible Extinction Ratio. At this level, the spontaneous emission is dominating and leads to significant <b>turn-on</b> <b>delay,</b> turn-on jitter and bit pattern effects.

40|$|The {{tangential}} {{component of}} electromagnetic force in switched reluctance motors (SRM) produces the desired torque which fluctuates with rotor position {{due to the}} doubly saliency in physical structure of SRM. The conventional methods are insufficient to completely compensate for the intrinsic behavior due to double saliency. This dissertation proposes a novel method of eliminating the torque ripple in the instantaneous torque profile of SRM and a method to generate the precise reference phase current waveforms for even open loop operational design through global optimization. For the purpose of implementation of the proposed method, a non-sinusoidal DC matrix converter is also proposed to generate such waveforms without using multiple source voltages {{and to be able}} to use the drive in electric vehicle applications where a battery system is available for DC voltage sources. The experimentally-obtained characteristics are used for finding the optimal solution for torque ripple reduction. FEA is used to investigate the accurate EM force and its radial and tangential components using volume integration method. The proposed global optimization method can give a precise solution for this non-linear problem. Therefore a modified fast-filled method is proposed to balance out the crests and troughs of the torque ripples throughout the operation of SRMs. A set of novel reference current waveforms are generated for feed-forward torque control. Comparative analyses with the torque and current profiles of conventional methods are performed to prove the elimination of ripple up to less than 1 % by using the proposed method. Therefore, it is concluded that the advanced <b>turn-on</b> and <b>delayed</b> turn-off angles with gradual rise and fall significantly eliminate the ripple. Inverter topology requirement for SRM is geometry-dependent. A multi-level converter is more suitable to generate the required position-dependent phase current. Matrix converters can be used for finer control on flexible current profiling. Therefore, a non-sinusoidal DC matrix converter is proposed to generate the required phase current waveforms from a single DC source and to accommodate the changes if required accurately. Three reduced-switching states schemes were tested with matrix converter resulting in the ripple elimination between 0. 9 % - 2 % where 0. 45 % reduction is possible...|$|R
