30|$|The Nisyros- 1 {{wildcat well}} was drilled in 1982 on the Greek island of Nisyros {{to the final}} depth of 1816  m. A {{temperature}} of approximately 400  °C was measured directly on the wellhead assembly. Production from Nisyros- 1 was carried out from two zones, with a deeper one containing brines of very high salinity of approximately 100  g/kg of total dissolved solids. Casing design process was performed assuming formation temperatures being equal to boiling curves of 10 – 25 % NaCl brines. After performing the first production tests, the 9 5 / 8 ″ production casing was seriously damaged at six different intervals between a depth of approximately 150 and 1240  m and plugged with scale deposits. It is worth to mention that no treatment other than circulating drilling fluid was done, before placing and cementing to mitigate circulation losses. Due to the buckled sections of the casing, collapsed areas were re-drilled with a milling assembly and a remedial 7 ″ <b>tie-back</b> <b>casing</b> was placed {{to a depth of}} 1258  m. During the next production tests, the newly installed 7 ″ <b>tie-back</b> <b>casing</b> also experienced casing collapse and buckling (Chiotis and Vrellis 1995). These two cases of casing failure can be explained by fast heating during initial production tests and fast cooling during well killing operations with cold water exerting extremely high thermal loads upon cemented casing strings. The casing failures are also likely to be associated with bad primary cementing operations which might have been caused by rock fracturing and corrosion resulted from highly saline reservoir fluids (personal communication with Dimitrios Mendrinos). It was concluded from the chemical composition of the productive horizons that high overpressures exist at shallow as well as greater depths, resulting in a high probability of a blow-out. The Nisyros- 2 well, drilled in the close vicinity to the Nisyros- 1 well, did not experienced casing collapse, which {{can be explained by the}} experience gained in this area and changes to the well design including implemention of steel with higher yield strength (Geothermica Italiana 1983, 1984; Mendrinos et al. 2010).|$|E
40|$|Production of {{oil on the}} Norwegian {{continental}} shelf started in the early 70 ’s. Many of these fields are now reaching {{the end of their}} production time. The industry is now awaiting a “plug wave” in the not too distant future. Decommission is a time-consuming procedure, and the cost of P&A can end up being 25 % of the total cost of the well. The task given from Wintershall was to plan P&A operation by setting a dual barrier plug against the creeping clay in the Hordaland formation. The Hordaland green clay will creep in and seal around the casing and create a bonding with the casing. This method has saved operators on the Norwegian {{continental shelf}} for millions of NOK, by avoiding milling or squeeze cement job. All the wells at Brage require permanent P&A in order to control subsurface pressure and prevent the free flow of pore fluids to the seabed. The wells at Brage was categorized depending on the different casing design. The objective was to determine the time for P&A for every category. There were three different casing designs that stood out: pre-drilled wells, production liner with <b>tie-back</b> <b>casing</b> and simplified casing design. The most likely time for plugging the 40 wells at Brage is estimated to be around 3 years. The time estimate is done with the technology available today. In the future there might be new technology that will enable the operator to P&A the field in a more cost-effective way. Many service companies are working on developing tomorrows P&A solution. Some of the new technologies will be presented and discussed in this thesis, together with the use of formation as a barrier...|$|E
