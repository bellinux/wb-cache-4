25|$|In early 1793, Watts began {{rotating}} large war parties {{back and}} forth between the Lower Towns and the North at the behest of his allies in the Western Confederacy, which was beginning to lose the ground to the Legion of the United States that had been created in the aftermath of the Battle of the Wabash. With the exception of the 1793 campaign against the Holston, his attention was more focused on the north than on the Southwest Territory and its environs during <b>these</b> <b>next</b> two years.|$|E
25|$|In physics one {{separates}} {{the laws of}} motion, called kinematics, from the laws of force, called dynamics. Following the classical kinematics of Newton's laws of motion, the kinematics of quantum mechanics is built {{in such a way}} that it presupposes nothing about the time reversal symmetry of the dynamics. In other words, if the dynamics are invariant, then the kinematics will allow it to remain invariant; if the dynamics is not, then the kinematics will also show this. The structure of the quantum laws of motion are richer, and we examine <b>these</b> <b>next.</b>|$|E
25|$|A few {{kilometers}} to {{the north}} of Alcobaça is another wondrous building constructed in memory of a different important battle, that of Aljubarrota in 1385, when Dom João I of Portugal defeated the Castilians and ensuring two hundred years of independence from the Castilian invaders. The construction of the Abbey at Batalha commenced in 1388 and was added to by various Portuguese Kings over <b>these</b> <b>next</b> two centuries. To the east of Batalha is the world-famous location of Fátima and a point of pilgrimage for the Roman Catholic religion due to the vision of the Virgin Mary in 1917 by three young children whilst tending their flock. To the west of Alcobaça is the well-known fishing village of Nazaré. Today, the village is now a small town and a popular holiday resort with most of its past and traditions having rapidly evaporated in the course of time. A very successful Portuguese feature film was made in the early 20th century that dramatically captured the primitive and dangerous life of these fishermen. Stoutly Catholic, the inhabitants have retained some of their past as can be still seen in their own particular style of costume. To the south is Caldas da Rainha and the quaint medieval town of Óbidos that is an attraction for any tourists that enjoys a true glimpse of the past. Also to the south is the town of Porto de Mós with its fanciful rebuilt castle. This town borders the Nature Reserve Parque Natural das Serras de Aire e Candeeiros. These 390 square kilometres of limestone-covered landscape is also known for its underground caverns. The best known being the Grutas de Mira de Aire can be visited and consists of tunnels, caverns with stalactites, stalagmites, lakes, and a music and light finale.|$|E

500|$|A {{period of}} hard work for Verdi—with the {{creation}} of twenty operas (excluding revisions and translations)—followed over the next sixteen years, culminating in Un ballo in maschera. This period was not without its frustrations and setbacks for the young composer, and he was frequently demoralised. In April 1845, in connection with I due Foscari, he wrote: [...] "I am happy, no matter what reception it gets, and I am utterly indifferent to everything. I cannot wait for <b>these</b> <b>next</b> three years to pass. I have to write six operas, then addio to everything." [...] In 1858 Verdi complained: [...] "Since Nabucco, you may say, I have never had one hour of peace. Sixteen years in the galleys." ...|$|E

[...] Cornet praised the full-use of the ensemble, particularly the [...] "Phyllis and Stanley Lil' Romeo mini-debate" [...] and Creed's confused mimicking of Dwight's declaration. Cornet also called the Dwight storyline [...] "perfectly executed", as well as the Jim-Pam-Dwight dynamic featured throughout the episode, calling their companionship to be [...] "entirely earned". She also praised Kinsey's performance during her character's storyline, and said her final scenes with Oscar [...] " [...] at my heart-string". She gave the episode an 8.5 out of 10, calling it [...] "Great". M. Giant of Television Without Pity awarded the episode an [...] "A–" [...] and wrote that [...] "almost everybody is having their best day in a long time, in the best episode of The Office in an even longer time".|$|E

Both wanted to explore fun ways for Spears to be inappropriate in the video, who had several ideas, such as a cop frisking her. Having seen Spears on How I Met Your Mother and Saturday Night Live, Piliero felt that none of her videos had really taken advantage of her comedic timing, saying, [...] "She never had a music video where she could show her acting chops and have fun with comedy while being super badass. That was my goal from day one: I wanted her to be funny, badass and super cool.". During {{the first day of the}} shoot, he requested Spears to [...] "have as much fun as possible over <b>these</b> <b>next</b> two days". Pilliero also stated that the Crossroads (2002) reference [...] "s a fun Easter egg for fans. Plus, [...] is the most ridiculously awesome way to title a sequel.
