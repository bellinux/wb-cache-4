50|$|The {{finishing}} stages consisted of cold-hammering to unevenly harden the metal, then <b>turning</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>lathe</b> {{to reduce the}} thickness, and then often a final cold hammering.|$|R
50|$|Wooden Staunton chess {{sets were}} often <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>lathe,</b> then non-circular details were added by hand; the knights {{were made in}} two parts (head and base) which were stuck {{together}} with adhesive.|$|R
50|$|Segmented <b>turning</b> is <b>turning</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>lathe</b> {{where the}} initial {{workpiece}} {{is composed of}} multiple glued-together parts. The process involves gluing up several pieces of wood to create patterns and visual effects in turned projects.|$|R
50|$|Threading : Both {{standard}} and non-standard screw threads can be <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>lathe</b> using <b>an</b> appropriate cutting tool. (Usually having a 60, or 55° nose angle) Either externally, or within a bore. Generally {{referred to as}} single-point threading.|$|R
50|$|Slope {{parameters}} describe {{characteristics of}} {{the slope of the}} roughness profile. Spacing and counting parameters describe how often the profile crosses certain thresholds. These parameters are often used to describe repetitive roughness profiles, such as those produced by <b>turning</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>lathe.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In 2012 and 2013 {{a limited}} run 1/300 scale (6" [...] in diameter) {{reproduction}} was {{offered for sale}} through eBay; it was <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>lathe</b> from <b>a</b> solid piece of billet aluminum; it came with no display stand, gangway, conveyor ramps, or central landing pedestal.|$|R

This slide comes from a {{collection}} created by missionaries from Regions Beyond Missionary Union, an interdenominational Protestant evangelical mission working in northeast India (Bihar and Orissa) and Nepal...|$|R
50|$|Alabaster is mined {{and then}} sold in blocks to {{alabaster}} workshops. There they are {{cut to the}} needed size ("squaring"), and then are processed in different techniques: <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>lathe</b> for round shapes, carved into three-dimensional sculptures, chiselled to produce low relief figures or decoration; and then given an elaborate finish that reveals its transparency, colour, and texture.|$|R
50|$|Turned, Ground, and Polished (TGP) is a {{classification}} of finishing processes {{often used for}} metal shafting. <b>Turning</b> (<b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>lathe)</b> creates straight round bars without the strain induced by cold drawing, while grinding and polishing improves the surface finish and roundness for high dimensional accuracy. Extreme straightness is critical in high-speed applications to prevent vibration and reduce wear on bearings.|$|R
50|$|Other {{innovations}} {{included in}} the instrument were the triangular section Hohl Flute 8’ on the Great division {{and the use of}} wooden harmonic flutes. Stop names and characteristics unfamiliar in this country included the Quintaten, Lieblich Gedackt, Gemshorn, Dolce, Terpodian and of course the famed wide mouthed ‘Schulze’ diapason. The Flauto Traverso 8’ and the Flauto Traverso 4’, as noted by Hopkins, consist of cylindrical open flute pipes, made from Beech, bored and <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>lathe.</b>|$|R
50|$|The column, {{unearthed}} in 1973, {{was carved}} out of a single block of stone (a monolith). With the capital and the abacus, it measures some 2 m tall. It tapers slightly towards the top and has a diameter of roughly 36 cm. The column’s surface is, given sandstone’s characteristics, rough. In two places, just above the base and also just below the necking, is <b>a</b> fine groove <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>lathe.</b> <b>On</b> the whole, {{it could be an}} example of the Tuscan style.|$|R
5000|$|Newels are {{sometimes}} called solid newels in distinction from hollow newels due to varying techniques of construction. Newel posts <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>lathe</b> are solid pieces {{that can be}} highly decorative, they typically need to be fixed to a square newel base for installation. [...] Hollow newels are known more accurately as box newel posts. In historic homes, {{it is believed that}} the house plans were placed in the newel upon completion of the house before the newel was capped.|$|R
50|$|Rough-outs are {{glued to}} a metal chuck and <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>lathe,</b> {{sometimes}} using pieces of broken grinding wheels. The chuck is removed by heating the glue, or — if the operator is inclined — <b>a</b> sharp tap <b>on</b> the chuck with a spanner. A further resining stage may take place, before {{the piece is}} returned to the lathe and polished with wet abrasive paper. A final high polish is added using putty powder (finely crushed tin dioxide) applied with a moist piece of felt.|$|R
25|$|The force {{accelerating}} a pinewood derby car is gravity; {{the opposing}} forces are friction and air drag. Therefore, car modifications {{are aimed at}} maximizing the potential energy in the car design and minimizing the air drag and the friction that occurs when the wheel spins on the axle, contacts the axle head or car body, or contacts the track guide rail. Friction due to air drag is a minor, although not insignificant, factor. The wheel tread can be sanded or <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>lathe</b> and the inner surface of the hub can be tapered to minimize the contact area between the hub and body. Polishing the wheel, especially the inner hub, with a plastic polish can also reduce friction. Often one front wheel is raised slightly {{so that it does}} not contact the track and add to the rolling resistance. Axles are filed or <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>lathe</b> to remove the burr and crimp marks and polished smooth. More extensive modifications involve tapering the axle head and cutting a notch to minimize the wheel-to-axle contact area. Packs can establish additional rules for what, if any, modifications are allowed. In some areas, no changes can be made to the axles or wheels.|$|R
500|$|There {{are three}} {{distinct}} classes of cues produced during different time periods related to what [...] Balabushka was using in cue construction: The Titlist blank era (1959–1966), the Burton Spain blank era (1966–1971) and the Gus Szamboti blank era (1971–1975). The [...] "blanks" [...] referred to are the bottom (...) {{portion of a}} cue where the splicing of various hardwoods has been completed but the cue {{has not yet been}} <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>lathe</b> to produce the final shape, and certain features have not yet been added such as a , , , [...] and any inlays.|$|R
2500|$|First {{developed}} in Italy, the stiletto {{dates from the}} late 15th century, and {{is thought to be}} a development of the rondel dagger or misericordia, a needle-pointed weapon with a narrow blade designed primarily for thrusting, though possessing cutting edges. [...] Early stilettos normally used a one-piece cast-metal handle which was shaped and <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>lathe.</b> [...] The stiletto blade was usually hammer-forged into a dense rod with a narrow, triangular cross section, without any sharpened edges. However, other examples of the period have emerged bearing round, square, or diamond cross sections.|$|R
40|$|Time {{series of}} cutting forces under two {{different}} regimes of <b>turning</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>lathe</b> are analyzed. With {{an increase of}} cutting depth the cutting regime is changed from chatterfree cutting to chatter. Using three different surrogate data tests, the dynamics of chatterfree cutting {{were found to be}} consistent with a linearly correlated random process, whereas the dynamics of chatter can be explained by a low-dimensional, presumably weakly chaotic process. The differences in the dynamics of the two cutting regimes are successfully exploited for the purpose of chatter detection...|$|R
50|$|Bowling pins are {{constructed}} by gluing blocks of rock maple wood into the approximate shape, and then <b>turning</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>lathe.</b> After the lathe shapes the pin, it is {{coated with a}} plastic material, painted, {{and covered with a}} glossy finish. Because of the scarcity of suitable wood, bowling pins can be made from approved synthetics. Currently there are synthetic pins sanctioned for play in five-pin, duckpin, and candlepin. There is one synthetic ten pin model approved by the USBC. When hit by the ball, synthetic pins usually sound different from wooden pins.|$|R
50|$|Sariputra's box {{contained}} a large flat casket of white steatite, {{more than six}} inches wide and three inches in height. The surface was polished and hard, and the box, which {{is believed to have}} been <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>lathe,</b> was <b>an</b> elaborate piece of workmanship. Surrounding the casket were some fragments of sandalwood believed to have been from the funeral pyre, while inside it, in addition to the relics, were various precious stones. The casket also {{contained a}} single bone relic of Sariputra, shorter than one inch in length.|$|R

5000|$|Designed {{for rapid}} {{production}} using {{a minimum of}} strategic metals and machine processes, the M3 trench knife used a relatively narrow 6.75-inch bayonet-style spear-point blade with a sharpened 3.5-inch secondary edge. [...] The blade was made of carbon steel, and was either blued or parkerized. [...] Production of the grooved leather handle was later simplified by forming the grip of stacked leather washers that were shaped by <b>turning</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>lathe,</b> then polished and lacquered. [...] The steel crossguard had an angular bend at one end to facilitate a thumb rest.|$|R
50|$|Strikers are {{basically}} spring-loaded firing pins, generally of a one- or two-piece construction. In the one-piece striker, the striker is <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>lathe</b> out of <b>a</b> round bar of metal, much larger in diameter than a firing pin, {{to provide the}} mass required to detonate the primer. Two-piece strikers generally consist of a firing pin attached to a heavier rear section—in essence a hammer attached {{to the base of}} a firing pin. Two-piece strikers are commonly found on bolt-action rifles, while single-piece strikers are found on pistols, such as the Glock.|$|R

5000|$|Unlike {{the regular}} curved cornett, cornettino and tenor cornett, the mute cornett {{is made from}} {{a single piece of}} wood that has been <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>lathe,</b> bored out and given finger holes. The non-detachable {{mouthpiece}} forms a smooth cup shape at the top. The cross section of the mouthpiece shows that it is similar in structure to that of a French horn. It eliminates the slight brassiness of the regular cornett and imparts the characteristic timbre associated with the instrument. Unlike other forms of cornett, mute cornetts were not covered in leather.|$|R
50|$|After cooling the gun the {{machining}} process began. The bore was bored out to proper size, the exterior was turned smooth, the trunnions were <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> trunnion <b>lathe,</b> and <b>a</b> vent was drilled.|$|R
50|$|Albright {{and others}} {{identified}} Hizma with the biblical town of Azmawt of the Israelite tribe of Benjamin. However, Gibson more recently questioned this identification, citing {{the lack of}} archaeological remains from the necessary time period. Towards {{the end of the}} Second Temple period, there was an industry here making fine stoneware from the local limestone. Products included vases and bowls <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>lathe,</b> and mugs carved by hand. Examples of stoneware that may have originated here have been found in many places in the Jerusalem region, mostly dating from the first and second centuries CE.|$|R
5000|$|The {{earliest}} screws {{tended to}} be made of wood, and they were whittled by hand, with or without the help of <b>turning</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>lathe</b> with hand-controlled <b>turning</b> tools (chisels, knives, gouges), as accurately as the whittler could manage. It is likely that sometimes the wood blanks that they started from were tree branches (or juvenile trunks) that had been shaped by a vine wrapped helically around them while they grew. (In fact, various Romance words for [...] "screw" [...] come from the word root referring to vines.) Walking sticks twisted by vines show how suggestive such sticks are of a screw.|$|R
25|$|Large drawknives {{can be used}} {{to dress}} logs, and small sizes for carving and shaving. A common use of a {{drawknife}} is to create a roughly cylindrical billet of wood for <b>turning</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> pole <b>lathe.</b>|$|R
50|$|Spin welding is a {{friction}} welding technique used on thermoplastic materials, {{in which the}} parts to be welded are heated by friction. The heat may be generated by <b>turning</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>lathe,</b> <b>a</b> drill press, or a milling machine, where one part {{is driven by the}} chuck, and the other is held stationary with the spinning part driven against it. This is continued until the heat of friction between the parts reaches a sufficient level for the parts to weld. The stationary part is then released to spin as well, while pressure is applied along the axis of rotation, holding the parts together as they cool.|$|R
50|$|Jenison becomes {{convinced}} that {{he is able to}} reproduce The Music Lesson as a painting with this technique, and plans to physically recreate the original scene; first he models the entire painting in LightWave, then proceeds with a painstaking process of re-creating the objects and setting within the original scene, which includes him doing woodworking, <b>turning</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>lathe,</b> and almost <b>an</b> entire year of handiwork. Jenison also insists on using only techniques available to Vermeer in the 17th century, mixing his own paint and polishing his own lens. Once the scene is set and is visually identical to the original painting, Jenison sits down and meticulously begins to paint.|$|R
50|$|Thin CA glue has {{application}} in woodworking. It {{can be used}} as a fast-drying, glossy finish. The use of oil (such as boiled linseed oil) may be used to control the rate at which the CA cures. CA glue is also used in combination with sawdust (from a saw or sanding) to fill voids and cracks. These repair methods are used on piano soundboards, wood instruments, and wood furniture. CA glue is also used in the finishing of pen blanks that have been <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>lathe</b> by applying multiple thin layers to build up a hard, clear finish that can then be sanded and polished to a glossy finish.|$|R
25|$|The Vienna amber factories, {{which use}} pale amber to {{manufacture}} pipes and other smoking tools, <b>turn</b> it <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>lathe</b> and polish it with whitening and water or with rotten stone and oil. The final luster {{is given by}} friction with flannel.|$|R
50|$|There {{were three}} types in existence, all differing in quality of workmanship. The {{first was the}} well crafted {{military}} type used by professional soldiers, made in series by expert weaponsmiths for stocking in town arsenals. The second and much simpler type would have been hand cut by peasant militia men, rather than <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>lathe,</b> from wood they had gathered themselves and fitted with nails and spikes by the local blacksmith. The shaft and head were usually of one piece but sometimes reinforced at the top with an iron band. The third type was decorative in nature, usually short hafted and made of metal, one sixteenth century example being of steel and damascened with inlaid gold and silver, in the Wallace Collection of London.|$|R
40|$|M. Eng. (Mechanical Engineering) High speed {{machining}} (HSM) has {{the potential}} to greatly increase productivity and to lower manufacturing costs if workpiece surface integrity can be controlled. The surface fmish of a biomaterial is vitally important for proper implant functioning, and is the focus of this study. Grade 4 titanium was <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>lathe</b> with cutting speeds increasing from the conventional to the high speed range. The surface finish was assessed using profilometry, atomic force microscopy, and contact angle measurement. The ability of the material to bond directly with bone was predicted by cell adhesion studies. Results indicate that there is a general relationship between cutting speed, surface roughness, contact angle, and cell adhesion. Turning grade 4 titanium at cutting speeds between 150 m/min and 200 m/min may provide an optimal surface for osseointegration...|$|R
5000|$|The family {{business}} {{was founded by}} Abraham Rudhall (1657-1736) who developed a method of tuning bells by <b>turning</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>lathe</b> rather than the traditional chipping method with a chisel.One of the earliest ring of bells he cast was for St Nicholas' Church, Oddington in 1684. [...] He came to {{be described as the}} greatest bell-founder of his age. The business was continued by his eldest son, also called Abraham (1680-1735), his son Abel (1714-60), and three of Abel's sons, Thomas (?1740-83), Charles (1746-1815) and John (1760-1835). In 1815 John Rudhall was declared bankrupt and the bell foundry bought by Mears & Stainbank who owned the Whitechapel Bell Foundry. The business formally closed in 1828 but bells bearing John's name have been found with dates up to 1835.|$|R
