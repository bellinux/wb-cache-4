Located on the Bowery, it {{exhibited a}} Grim Reaper riding a bumper car in circles to an elaborate light show, fog machine and Blue Öyster Cult's (Don't Fear) The Reaper. The accompanying audio guide offered a self-mockery interpretation, with Banksy stating that often [...] "the role {{of art is}} <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> <b>us</b> <b>of</b> our mortality," [...] implying that with this mounted art show that goes on [...] "for so long we wish we were dead already." [...] The site of the exhibit was once that of an antique shop, some remains of which were placed in a coffin that occupied the lot for months.

It also arrived {{in the midst of}} the campaign for the 2008 U.S. presidential elections and during the week the 2008 Republican National Convention was scheduled to start. The federal and state administrations, as well as the candidates for the 2008 presidential election were sensitive that Gustav was likely <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> <b>U.S.</b> voters <b>of</b> the [...] "botched response" [...] by state and local municipalities and subsequent federal aid authorities to the earlier storm.|$|R
500|$|The [...] lament [...] "Rheingold! Rheingold! Reines Gold!..." [...] (Das Rheingold Scene 4) is sung by the maidens {{at the end}} of Das Rheingold, as {{the gods}} begin to cross the Rainbow Bridge into Valhalla. It begins with the music from the greeting, but {{develops}} into what Ernest Newman describes as a [...] "haunting song of loss", which becomes increasingly poignant before it is drowned by the orchestral fortissimo [...] that ends the opera. [...] A slow version of the lament is played on the horns in Siegfried, Act 2, as Siegfried enters Fafner's cave to claim the gold—the lament, says Cooke, serves <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> <b>us</b> <b>of</b> the gold's true ownership. The lament is played spiritedly during the Götterdämmerung prologue, as part of the orchestral interlude known as Siegfried's Rhine Journey, [...] before a shadow falls across the music as it descends into the minor key of the [...] "servitude" [...] motive.|$|E

In the UK, {{an audience of}} 1.30 million watched the episode. For his work on [...] "Episode 6188", Dutton earned a nomination for Best Direction in a TV Drama at the 2012 Australian Directors' Guild Awards. A TV Week website writer called the episode [...] "an edge-of-your-seat special", which was [...] "unmissable". The Sydney Morning Herald's readers gave the episode three out of five stars, while the paper's television critic, Andrew Murfett, commented [...] "The clock is omnipresent in tonight's 'real-time' Neighbours episode. The gimmick of the formatting – the episode unfolds in real time over an action-packed 30 minutes on Ramsay Street – means the clock appears almost every minute <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> <b>us</b> <b>of</b> what is a pressing deadline. It's a clever device for fans who have perhaps fallen {{out of touch with}} the folks at Erinsborough.

500|$|When {{asked what}} sets Gravity {{apart from his}} {{previous}} releases, Lecrae stated that [...] "Obviously, there's more risk involved in terms of just making more mature music that's not as straight [...] explicit. it's dealing with bigger issues. People may have to think a little bit more. The production is a lot bigger and more advanced than it's been. Lyrically, as an artist, I think I've written {{some of the best}} lyrics I've ever written." [...] Lecrae provided insight into the album's concept during an interview with Family Christian, stating that [...] "Gravity is loosely based on Ecclesiastes and I think what Solomon was trying to do was bring some weight to life and that’s really what I want to do, to paint some sober pictures." [...] He described that [...] "there’s a sober picture of how it’s only {{for a short period of}} time, it’s short-lived, or that we still have Jesus. So that’s what I would call a weighty part, a gravitational pull <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> <b>us</b> <b>of</b> who we are in Jesus." [...] Billboard stated that Lecrae increased his level of production for Gravity and [...] "mixed reggae and soul influences with his signature brash sound." [...] AllHipHop described the album as opening with [...] "an influx of instruments like violin, drums, guitars". [...] "I Know" [...] was described as having one of the hardest beats on the album, while [...] "Mayday" [...] was considered one of the most [...] "organic" [...] sounding tracks. [...] "Violence" [...] was considered one of the most energetic tracks, and was described as [...] "caribbean-esque" [...] with a dancehall vibe. After the music video for [...] "Lord Have Mercy" [...] was released, an article in The Christian Post article compared the song to the Kanye West single [...] "Mercy", both in its title and musical style. The article elaborated that [...] "like Kanye West's song, [...] "'Lord Have Mercy' features slowed down sampled vocals for its chorus along with heavy bass and an overall dark tone." [...] It noted the appearance of No Malice in the video, stating that [...] "the chorus seems to sample his voice." ...|$|E

60|$|While {{they were}} conversing thus two tall and slim but broad-shouldered youths were seen {{climbing}} the hill towards them, engaged in very earnest conversation. And this reference <b>to</b> conversation <b>reminds</b> <b>us</b> <b>of</b> the curious {{fact that the}} language of the young Pitcairners had greatly improved of late. As they had no other living model to improve upon than John Adams, this must have been entirely the result of reading. Although the books they had were few, they proved to be sufficient not only to fill their minds with higher thoughts, but their mouths with purer English than that nautical type which had been peculiar to the mutineers.|$|R

2500|$|By {{the mid-nineteenth}} century, {{less than a}} fifth of the pits on the Tyne and Wear were using keels to load coal. The {{introduction}} of coal staithes and steam tugs had already severely diminished the number of keelmen. The new docks with their efficient coal loading facilities brought the final demise of the keels and the men who worked them. The {{second half of the nineteenth}} century was a time of rapid industrial growth on Tyneside and Wearside, so that the keelmen would be readily absorbed within other industries.

2500|$|The New Yorker {{describes}} {{what it calls}} this [...] "strangely but tellingly misbegotten" [...] cover design thusly: [...] "The image is a photograph, taken from a French fashion shoot, of a glassy-eyed, heavily made-up little girl. Behind her sits, a mother figure, stiff and coiffed, casting an ominous shadow. The girl, with her long, perfectly waved platinum-blond hair and her pink feather boa, looks like a pretty and inert doll—" [...] The article continues: [...] "And if the Stepford daughter on the cover is meant <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> <b>us</b> <b>of</b> Veruca Salt or Violet Beauregarde, she doesn't: those badly behaved squirts are bubbling over with rude life." [...] Moreover, writes Talbot, [...] "The Modern Classics cover has not a whiff of this validation of childish imagination; instead, it seems to imply a deviant adult audience." ...|$|E

2500|$|We {{have now}} {{reached the point}} where the old city, which had grown up haphazard, with crooked streets, wooded hills, and fertile valleys traversed by streams and winding country roads, begins to be absorbed into a new city, in which antiquity and mature are no longer respected, with streets laid out in {{accordance}} with a carefully considered symmetrical plan. ... Unfortunately, this plan, although possessing the merits of simplicity and directness, lacked entirely the equally essential elements of variety of picturesqueness, which demand a large degree of respect for the natural conformation of the land. The new plan was entirely deficient in sentiment and charm, and with its gradual development, little by little, the individuality, the interest, and the beauty of one choice spot after another have been swept away [...] scarcely anything remains <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> <b>us</b> <b>of</b> the primitive beauty and the fascinating diversity of natural charms we know Manhattan once possessed.

2500|$|The episode {{received}} generally mixed reviews. Reuters writer Daniel Carlson {{said the}} show was [...] "exactly {{as bad as you}} would fear". Carlson said the jokes were bad and that delivery from the actors is too exaggerated; although he praised Matt Lucas, he said Maguire and Lucas were inappropriately over-the-top. Matthew Gilbert of The Boston Globe called the show a [...] "relentless, mediocre spoofery that so desperately wants <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> <b>us</b> <b>of</b> Monty Python and the Holy Grail". However, Gilbert said the show might work better in half-hour increments, rather than in the one-hour premiere with [...] "Wench Trouble" [...] and [...] "Golden Powers". Kate Ward of Entertainment Weekly said although the show's premise had promise, she did not particularly like the execution. Ward said Matt Lucas's character [...] "came off as Dr. Evil light", but said Sean Maguire was charming and that she laughed at some of the [...] "juvenile jokes", including Horst Draper, the name of a prisoner accused of raping horses. Boston Herald reviewer Mark A. Perigard complimented the show's high production values, but said, [...] "What was spent on sets didn't go into the script." [...] He also said the concept of a comedy swords-and-fantasy show is redundant because even serious shows, like [...] and , are comedies to an extent.|$|E

[...] Curt Wagner of RedEye said he did not enjoy or appreciate the gay jokes: [...] "Do the writers really think being gay is funny?"

Plato finds ways <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> <b>us</b> constantly <b>of</b> his favorite teachings, and recollection would be particularly relevant at important moments in Symposium and Republic, which offer different models of innate ideas instead: {{in place of the}} non-dispositional model of recollection, which implies the innate possession of the content of the knowledge to be acquired, these dialogues offer dispositional models such as mental pregnancy, in which the actual content of knowledge is not innately present but the product of a specialized innate potentiality being actualized through specific kinds of experience and mental activity...|$|R

5000|$|The finale, {{although}} having {{switched to}} the key of E-flat major (a supposedly [...] "happy" [...] key), is actually ambiguous in character: the lively main theme, initially carried by the violins, is answered by pounding timpani and brass, as if to threaten it back. A subsidiary theme follows on woodwinds and {{is accompanied by a}} chugging rhythm on strings. The two themes are subsequently developed and eventually combined. However, a mournful bassoon then winds down the previous activity and there is a thought-provoking reappearance of the melancholic oboe theme from the first movement, as if <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> <b>us</b> again <b>of</b> the pains of war. After the meditation, there is a resumption of the threatening poundings of timpani and brass, this time accentuated with [...] "wrong notes", and the symphony ends with a sardonic cry from high brass, juxtaposing F major with D major before the ultimate E-flat major chord.|$|R
