The sliver of nitride is non-conductive but contains a large number of charge <b>trapping</b> <b>sites</b> able to hold an electrostatic charge. The nitride layer is electrically isolated from the surrounding transistor, although charges stored on the nitride directly affect the conductivity of the underlying transistor channel.

50|$|The method {{makes use}} of {{electrons}} trapped between the valence and conduction bands in the crystalline structure of certain minerals (most commonly quartz and feldspar). The <b>trapping</b> <b>sites</b> are imperfections of the lattice — impurities or defects. The ionizing radiation produces electron-hole pairs: Electrons are in the conduction band and holes in the valence band. The electrons that have been excited to the conduction band may become entrapped in the electron or hole traps. Under stimulation of light the electrons may free themselves from the trap {{and get into the}} conduction band. From the conduction band they may recombine with holes trapped in hole traps. If the centre with the hole is a luminescence center (radiative recombination centre) emission of light will occur. The photons are detected using a photomultiplier tube. The signal from the tube is then used to calculate the dose that the material had absorbed.|$|E

By adding 2, 4, 6 -trichlorophenol (TCP) and then methanol to P 25 to act as hole scavengers, the resultant EPR signal should show electrons populating surface <b>trapping</b> <b>sites.</b> Upon illumination with fluorescent light, at room temperature, the EPR signal for anatase surface electron <b>trapping</b> <b>sites</b> is observed to be very broad, indicating that {{a wide variety of}} both surface and lattice sites, with varying geometries and therefore energies, have been populated. Also observed is a signal attributed to distorted four-coordinated interfacial sites, as previously observed between silica and anatase coatings. Following illumination of the sample, this time at 10  K, more electron-hole pairs were created because of the lower temperature impeding charge carrier mobility. Subsequently any recombination of trapped species will occur where the electron-hole pair was formed. The resultant EPR signal showed there to be a decrease in both the number of populated surface electron <b>trapping</b> <b>sites</b> and interfacial electron <b>trapping</b> <b>sites,</b> which coincided with an increase in the signal for the anatase and rutile lattice electron <b>trapping</b> <b>sites.</b> These two observations indicate that recombination of electron-hole pairs is dominantly a surface process with photoexcited holes within TiO 2 particles generated on the particle surface and photoexcited electrons quickly trapped at lattice sites.

The effect of <b>trap</b> <b>sites</b> of absorbed hydrogen on the hydrogen embrittlement behavior of Ni-Ti superelastic alloy was not sufficiently taken into consideration in the present study. Gamaoun et al.

Analysis of the data as a function of deposition temperature, from 127 K to 300 K, reveals that island density is constant, while at higher temperature it decreases.
