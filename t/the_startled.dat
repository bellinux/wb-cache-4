25|$|Towards {{the end of}} the Han dynasty, Xu Chu rallied {{thousands}} of his clan members and they constructed a fortress to fend off the Yellow Turban rebels. An army of rebels from Runan (汝南; present-day Runan County, Zhumadian, Henan), numbering more than 10,000, once attacked Xu Chu's fortress. The defenders were outnumbered and worn out as the battle dragged on. When the arrows were used up, Xu Chu told all the men and women within the fortress to gather stones the size of chess pieces and place them in the four corners of the fortress. He then hurled the stones at the enemies, crushing the bones of all those who were hit. The rebels then kept a distance away and did not dare to come close. When the food supply was exhausted, Xu Chu pretended to negotiate a truce with the rebels and discuss a deal to exchange an ox for food. When the rebels came to collect the ox, the animal would always run back. Then Xu Chu, holding on to the ox's tail, pulled it along for more than a hundred steps. Seeing this, <b>the</b> <b>startled</b> rebels took off without the ox. The rebels in the surrounding areas heard of this incident and became fearful of Xu Chu.|$|E
25|$|Prazina {{played an}} {{integral}} role in defending Sarajevo {{during the early}} days of the siege. His forces cleared the streets of Serb paramilitaries and the areas under his control (most notably Alipašino polje) were considered impenetrable to the enemy. On a number of occasions he participated in actions orchestrated by the leaders of other military units more closely affiliated with the central government (such as Dragan Vikić), many of whom he had good relations with. He was proclaimed a hero by the Bosnian press while the Western media frequently portrayed him as a sort of Robin Hood figure. He was widely admired among the besieged Sarajevo populace, even appearing in contemporary patriotic songs. Prazina’s own actions helped enhance the myth that was being built around him. At a time when many Sarajevans had to risk their lives for humanitarian food provisions, Prazina handed out candy to children on the street (albeit usually accompanied by the cameras of foreign news services).

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>startle</b> eye-blink {{is part of}} a non-voluntary {{response}} that typically occurs when an individual encounters a sudden and unexpected stimulus, such as a loud noise or increase in light. Modulations of <b>the</b> <b>startle</b> reflex can be used to infer affective processing in players. The response can be elicited using simple auditory, visual, electric, or mechanical stimuli. The magnitude of <b>the</b> <b>startle</b> eye-blink is used to infer the unconscious positive (pleasant) or negative (unpleasant) emotional state of the player. It is frequently used in psychology where variations in the magnitude, latency, and duration of <b>the</b> <b>startle</b> response are used to understand attention, workload, affective processing, and psychopathologies such as schizophrenia. By comparison, there has been limited use of this objective measure for studying games. As such, there are opportunities to adapt this measure to studies of player affect in the context of game design. We provide a review of the concepts of “affect” and “affective computing” as they relate to game design and also explain in detail the use of <b>the</b> <b>startle</b> eye-blink for objectively measuring player affect. Finally, the use of the approach is illustrated in a case study for evaluating a serious game design...|$|R
40|$|Prepulse {{inhibition}} (PPI) of <b>the</b> <b>startle</b> {{response to}} a sudden noise is <b>the</b> reduction in <b>startle</b> observed when <b>the</b> noise is preceded shortly by a mild sensory event, which is often a tone.

The model is based on the commonly accepted observation that the neuronal circuit of PPI differs from that of startle.

But, how can we interpret the numerous experimental data showing PPI to be independent of <b>the</b> <b>startle</b> level?

40|$|Anger and {{aggression}} are frequent problems in deployed military personnel. A lowered threshold of perceiving {{and responding to}} threat can trigger impulsive aggression. This can be indicated by an exaggerated startle response. Fifty-two veterans with anger {{and aggression}} problems (Anger group) and 50 control veterans were tested using a startle experiment with 10 startle probes and 10 prepulse trials, presented in a random order and with a random interval between the trials. Predictors (demographics, Trait Anger, State Anger, Harm Avoidance and Anxious Arousal) for <b>the</b> <b>startle</b> response within <b>the</b> Anger group were tested. Increased EMG responses were found to <b>the</b> <b>startle</b> probes in <b>the</b> Anger Group compared to the Control group, {{but not to the}} prepulse trials. Furthermore, Harm Avoidance and State Anger predicted <b>the</b> increased <b>startle</b> reflex within <b>the</b> Anger group, whereas Trait Anger was negatively related to <b>the</b> <b>startle</b> reflex.

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>startle</b> reflex is {{an innate}} {{defensive}} reaction (Lang, 1995; Yeomans, Li, Scott, & Frankland, 2002), {{delegate to the}} instantaneous reaction following an unexpected and intense stimulus. <b>The</b> <b>startle</b> widely satisfies <b>the</b> requirements essential {{to be used as}} a research tool, since it is modified by the experience, it is easily and universally elicitable (Landis & Hunt, 1939), and its physical and temporal characteristics are well known and highly controllable (Costa & Ricci Bitti, 1998; Davis, Hitchcock, & Rosen, 1987). Yet, despite the importance of the study of this reflex in various research fields (from the study of motivational, emotional and attentive phenomena, to the investigation of neurological, neurophysiological and neuropsychological diseases; Balaban, 1996; Lang, 1995; Richards, 1998; Prechtl & Beintema, 1964), <b>the</b> <b>startle</b> modification is still relatively unexplored in early infancy. This lack in developmental psychological research is mainly due to two problems: the difficulty to identify and develop new methodologies suitable to explore <b>the</b> <b>startle</b> modification in early infancy; the intrusiveness and invasiveness of the commonly used measurement methodology, that is the eyeblink electromyography. Two experimental studies are presented in this dissertation. They were designed to explore <b>the</b> <b>startle</b> modification by using a new non-invasive methodology (AIMMSS) and a new experimental paradigm based on the use of infants facial expressions. In particular, the main indexes of positive (smile) and negative (distress) facial expressions were analysed using the most known anatomically based systems to coding the infants’ facial behaviour (Baby FACS, Oster, in press; AFFEX, Izard, Dougherty, & Hembree, 1983; MAX, Izard, 1979). The first study (N = 12) was aimed at analysing the affective modulation of <b>the</b> <b>startle</b> response elicited during the 5 -month-old infants’ spontaneous exhibition of positive facial expressions (smile) and negative facial expressions (distress). The data obtained induce to hypothesize that the facial expressions act like a sort of motivational priming able to diversify, depending on their negative (distress) or positive (smile) nature, the intensity of <b>the</b> <b>startle</b> response elicited immediately after their exhibition. The second study (N = 26) was designed to analyse the modulatory influences exerted on <b>the</b> <b>startle</b> response by both the attentive state and the emotional state displayed by 3 - and 5 -month-old infants.
