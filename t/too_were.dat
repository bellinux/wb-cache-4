5|$|All four ships {{spent the}} {{majority}} of their time in service with the main Italian fleet, alternating between active duty for training exercises and reserve status. In 1897, Goito was converted into a minelayer and Montebello became a training ship for engine room personnel. Monzambano and Confienza were simply sold for scrap in 1901. Goito laid defensive minefields after Italy entered World War I in 1915, but otherwise did not see action during the war. The two surviving vessels remained in the Italian fleet until 1920, when they <b>too</b> <b>were</b> broken up for scrap.|$|E
5|$|As {{the militia}} fell back, {{the three men}} who had set out in search of their horses {{returned}} and they <b>too</b> <b>were</b> killed by the Native American forces. The natives continued to assault the barn and cabin; their attacks did not cease and during the battle about 25 horses were killed. Finally, the native forces withdrew, leaving nine of their own dead behind. The June 25 battle {{was the last of}} the Black Hawk War on Illinois soil. Dement's company lost five men with another three were wounded, many horses were killed as well.|$|E
5|$|Even {{in areas}} where {{mortality}} was low, so many were incapacitated that much of everyday life was hampered. Some communities closed all stores or required customers to leave orders outside. There were reports that the health-care workers could not tend the sick nor the gravediggers bury the dead because they <b>too</b> <b>were</b> ill. Mass graves were dug by steam shovel and bodies buried without coffins in many places.|$|E

5|$|Howe {{launched}} his attack on November 16. He led an assault from three sides: the north, east and south. Tides in the Harlem River prevented some troops from landing and delayed the attack. When the British moved against the defenses, the southern and western American defenses fell quickly. Patriot {{forces on the}} north side offered stiff resistance to the Hessian attack, but they <b>too</b> <b>were</b> eventually overwhelmed. With the fort surrounded by land and sea, Colonel Magaw chose to surrender. A total of 59 Americans were killed and 2,837 were taken as prisoners of war.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after his}} arrival in Australia, it was {{reported}} in the British media that Fowler would be making a swift return to his homeland and sign for League One side Tranmere Rovers, who had just appointed Fowler's former Liverpool teammate John Barnes as manager. However, Fowler was quick to dismiss talk of a quick return to England. When Barnes was dismissed three months later, it was reported that Tranmere had approached Fowler about becoming player-manager, but these reports <b>too</b> <b>were</b> dismissed.|$|E
5|$|The Japanese {{units in}} the area also defended strongly, but they <b>too</b> <b>were</b> short on {{supplies}} {{and in the end}} they were forced to withdraw further north. Wareo subsequently fell to the Allies on 8 December, who then established a line east from Wareo to Gusika on the coast. From there they carried out further advances north later in the month and into early January 1944.|$|E
50|$|Cartoon Network <b>Too</b> <b>was</b> a British TV network {{created by}} Turner Broadcasting. CN <b>Too</b> <b>is</b> the sister station of Cartoon Network, and it often aired {{programmes}} {{a while after}} they are shown on the main Cartoon Network. During the daytime, it usually aired some action-adventure programming such as Ben 10: Alien Force and Star Wars: The Clone Wars. During overnight hours, usually between midnight and 06:00, it also aired some shows which are no longer being produced, and {{are no longer in}} high demand (i.e. Skatoony). Cartoon Network <b>Too</b> <b>was</b> closed on 1 April 2014.|$|R

5|$|The conspirators {{first told}} Justin, Germanus's eldest son, of their intentions. He, in turn, {{informed}} his father, who then held counsel with the comes excubitorum, Marcellus. In {{order to find}} out more of their intentions, Germanus met the conspirators in person, while a trusted aide of Marcellus, named Leontius, was concealed nearby and listened in. Marcellus then informed Emperor Justinian, and the conspirators were arrested, but treated with remarkable leniency. At first, Germanus and his sons <b>too</b> <b>were</b> suspected, until the testimony of Marcellus and the commanders Constantianus and Bouzes cleared them.|$|E
5|$|The fall of Huế and Da Nang did not {{spell the}} end of the misery {{suffered}} by the Army of the Republic of Vietnam. On March 31, ARVN General Phạm Văn Phú—commander of II Corps Tactical Zone—attempted to form a new defensive line from Qui Nhơn to cover the retreat of the ARVN 22nd Infantry Division into the Mekong Delta, but they <b>too</b> <b>were</b> destroyed by the North Vietnamese. By April 2, South Vietnam had lost control of the northern provinces, as well as two army corps.|$|E
5|$|The libel trial {{became a}} cause célèbre as salacious details of Wilde's private life with Taylor and Douglas {{began to appear}} in the press. A team of private detectives had {{directed}} Queensberry's lawyers, led by Edward Carson QC, {{to the world of the}} Victorian underground. Wilde's association with blackmailers and male prostitutes, cross-dressers and homosexual brothels was recorded, and various persons involved were interviewed, some being coerced to appear as witnesses since they <b>too</b> <b>were</b> accomplices to the crimes of which Wilde was accused.|$|E

5|$|The second version, with blue-green filters {{over the}} projectors, was trialled {{on board the}} {{corvette}} HMCS Chambly in May 1941. This gave better results as the filters removed the reddish bias to the lamps when at low intensity (lower colour temperature). The supports <b>too</b> <b>were</b> retractable, so the delicate projectors could be stowed away for protection when not in use. This second version reduced Chambly's visibility by 50% in most conditions, and sometimes {{by as much as}} 75%. This was enough to justify development of a more robust version.|$|E
5|$|Zoroastrians had {{difficult}} {{time during the}} Safavid period and faced repeated persecution and forced conversion. Safavid kings sought to compel them to accept Shia Islam, Sunnis <b>too</b> <b>were</b> forced to convert to Shia or were killed. Zoroastrians were also branded as impure, {{in addition to being}} infidels. As earlier in the century, so this period also witnessed sporadic campaigns for the conversion of Armenians and Zoroastrians, focusing blame for economic and other ills on these and other minorities whose involvement in the spice export, for example, was well known.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{teenagers}} who {{were interested in}} Wicca had begun hanging around at the Warlock Shop, and they <b>too</b> <b>were</b> initiated into the Traditionalist Gwyddoniaid, after gaining parental permission. Proceeding through the outer court of Buczynski's coven, they eventually hived off to form their own coven, the Children of Branwen, in December 1972, with prominent members including Robert Carey, Denny Sargent, and Karen and Eddie Chiecho. Buczynski initially attended some of the group's meetings, in order to instruct these students in the Craft, but soon found his time preoccupied with his own primary coven, leaving the coven under the control of high priestess Kay Smith. She would subsequently go on to found a Welsh Traditionalist coven for adults, leaving the position of high priestess to Melda Tamarack.|$|E

5|$|A special {{group was}} {{established}} under Teller in March 1944 {{to investigate the}} mathematics of an implosion-type nuclear weapon. It too ran into difficulties. Because of {{his interest in the}} Super, Teller did not work as hard on the implosion calculations as Bethe wanted. These <b>too</b> <b>were</b> originally low-priority tasks, but the discovery of spontaneous fission in plutonium by Emilio Segrè's group gave the Super increased importance. In June 1944, at Bethe's request, Oppenheimer moved Teller out of T Division, and placed him in charge of a special group responsible for the Super, reporting directly to Oppenheimer. He was replaced by Rudolf Peierls from the British Mission, who in turn brought in Klaus Fuchs, who was later revealed to be a Soviet spy. Teller's Super group became part of Fermi's F Division when he joined the Los Alamos Laboratory in September 1944. It included Stanislaw Ulam, Jane Roberg, Geoffrey Chew, Harold and Mary Argo, and Maria Goeppert-Mayer.|$|E
5|$|As Jupiter {{migrated}} inward {{following its}} formation (see Planetary migration below), resonances would have {{swept across the}} asteroid belt, dynamically exciting the region's population and increasing their velocities relative to each other. The cumulative action of the resonances and the embryos either scattered the planetesimals away from the asteroid belt or excited their orbital inclinations and eccentricities. Some of those massive embryos <b>too</b> <b>were</b> ejected by Jupiter, while others may have migrated to the inner Solar System and {{played a role in}} the final accretion of the terrestrial planets. During this primary depletion period, the effects of the giant planets and planetary embryos left the asteroid belt with a total mass equivalent to less than 1% that of the Earth, composed mainly of small planetesimals.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} hostilities, No. 6 Commando {{remained}} in Germany to undertake various occupation duties {{along with the rest}} of the 1st Commando Brigade. These duties included searching for German personnel and officials that were wanted for questioning or to be tried for war crimes, distributing food to the populace and helping to restore law and order as part of the reconstruction process. In early 1946, the unit returned to the United Kingdom and it was eventually disbanded. At this time the decision was made to disband all the Army commando units and demobilise or return their personnel to their original regiments or branches of service. Consequently, the commando role was maintained solely by the Royal Marines Commandos, although they <b>too</b> <b>were</b> subjected to cut backs, being reduced from eight wartime units to just three.|$|E
