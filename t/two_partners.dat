5|$|The game {{is played}} online {{in the same way}} as over the board, but some aspects are unique to online bughouse. In games over the board, {{communication}} is heard by all players, while in online bughouse it is usually done via private messages between <b>two</b> <b>partners.</b> This makes communication a more powerful weapon. It is also easier to coordinate as the second board is more visible on the screen than over the board. The time aspect is altered due to existence of premove and lag. The latter can influence the diagonal time difference significantly, and it is good sportsmanship to restart the game when this difference gets too large.|$|E

The <b>two</b> <b>partners</b> are pursued by the Nazis who seek to use the power of Atlantis for warfare, and serve as the adventure's antagonists. The story was written by Hal Barwood and Noah Falstein, the game's designers, who had rejected the original plan to base it on an unused movie script. They came up with the final concept while researching real-world sources for a suitable plot device.|$|E

5|$|In 1926, Lai Ah Koon (黎亚坤) {{emigrated from}} Hainan to Singapore, {{where he worked}} as a coffee-stall assistant. He later went on to start his own {{business}} with two other immigrants. They sold coffee, crackers and toast at Telok Ayer Basin, however, his <b>two</b> <b>partners</b> later dropped out, leaving him to run the stall alone. He married while visiting relatives in Hainan, his wife later settled down with him in Singapore. She worked alongside him and later suggested cutting each slice of bread into half and combining the toast with her homemade kaya, this became their signature kaya toast. Registered in 1944 as Ya Kun Coffeestall (Ya Kun being Ah Koon in Hanyu Pinyin), the stall gradually developed a reputation for delicious kaya toast and friendly service. The couple, their eight children and seven other families lived together in a three-storey shophouse across the road, where the Hong Leong Building now stands. As the children grew up, they began to help stir the kaya, run errands, charcoal-grill the bread and eventually, manage the stall.|$|E
5|$|Sherman moved {{north to}} Cleveland in 1853 and {{established}} a law office there with <b>two</b> <b>partners.</b> Events soon interrupted Sherman's {{plans for a new}} law firm, as the passage of the Kansas–Nebraska Act in 1854 inspired him (and many other anti-slavery Northerners) to take a more involved role in politics. That Act, the brainchild of Illinois Democrat Stephen A. Douglas, opened the two named territories to slavery, an implicit repeal of the Missouri Compromise of 1820. Intended to quiet national agitation over slavery by shifting the decision to local settlers, Douglas's Act instead inflamed anti-slavery sentiment in the North by allowing the possibility of slavery's expansion to territories held as free soil for three decades. Two months after the Act's passage, Sherman became a candidate for Ohio's 13th congressional district. A local convention nominated Sherman over two other candidates to represent what was then called the Opposition Party (later to become the Republican Party). The new party, a fusion of Free Soilers, Whigs, and anti-slavery Democrats, had many discordant elements, and some among the former group thought Sherman too conservative on the slavery question. Nevertheless, they supported him against the incumbent Democrat, William D. Lindsley. Democrats were defeated across Ohio that year, and Sherman was elected by 2,823 votes.|$|E
5|$|The backstory of {{the game}} is {{described}} in the fourth case, Turnabout Reminiscence. Ten years prior to the game's present, the secretariat of the Cohdopian Embassy was accused of murdering Cece Yew, a witness to a smuggling ring's connection to the embassy. Prosecutor Byrne Faraday and detective Tyrell Badd attempted to convict the secretariat, but he went free after key evidence was stolen. Feeling that the justice system was powerless to those who stand above the law, Faraday, Badd, and Yew's sister Calisto, started stealing corporate files detailing illegal or unethical activities and exposed them to the media, under the name Yatagarasu. Three years later, another murder occurred at the embassy. During the trial, in which Faraday was the prosecutor, the suspect, Mack Rell, claimed that he had been told by Faraday to commit the murder, and said that Faraday was the Yatagarasu. A recess was held to replace Faraday with another prosecutor, Miles Edgeworth; before court was reconvened, both Rell and Faraday were found dead. Edgeworth discovered that Calisto had murdered Faraday with help from Rell, then killed Rell and made it look like Faraday and Rell had killed each other. When confronted, Calisto says that she is Yatagarasu, not mentioning her <b>two</b> <b>partners,</b> and that she is part of the smuggling ring. Faraday's daughter Kay is comforted over Faraday's death by Edgeworth, Badd, and detective Gumshoe; she believes her father to be the true Yatagarasu, and vows to catch the fake.|$|E

5|$|Still, Finley & Figg {{remains in}} bad shape. The Krayoxx affair has left them deep in debt {{instead of the}} {{expected}} big profit, their office building – the firm's sole asset – heavily mortgaged and the <b>two</b> <b>partners</b> ailing, in bad shape physically and mentally. Meanwhile, David manages to complete his lead poisoning product liability case, finding that the destructive toys were imported from China by a subsidiary of Sonesta Games, the third-largest toy producer in the U.S. Unlike the Krayoxx case, this provides David with an air-tight case. A jury seeing the poor child, completely disabled as a direct provable result of using the toy, would be certain to grant a high sum in compensations. Knowing this, the Sonesta CEO and his senior executives hasten to meet with David, seeming to show genuine remorse, aside from being aware of the grave damage which the publicity around such a case could cause their corporation. They readily agree to give David's clients, the child's Burmese immigrant parents $5 million in out-of-court compensation, provided that the case remain secret. David insists, however, that $1.5 million in legal fees would not {{come out of his}} clients' compensation but be paid separately by Sonesta; knowing himself to have the upper hand, Zinc is a tough negotiator and the Sonesta directors {{have no choice but to}} agree to pay a total of $6.5 million. In parting, a Sonesta executive discreetly slips Zinc an unmarked envelope with information on lead poisoning caused by the products of Sonesta's competitors.|$|E
