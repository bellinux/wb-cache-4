5|$|One of {{the major}} {{legacies}} of colonial rule in Kasai was the arbitrary redivision of the population into new ethnic groups. Despite <b>the</b> <b>shared</b> language (Tshiluba) {{and culture of the}} two groups, colonial administrators believed the inhabitants of the Lulua river area to be ethnically different from the Baluba and dubbed them the Bena Lulua. The colonists believed the Baluba to be more intelligent, hardworking and open to new ideas than the Bena Lulua who were believed to be more reactionary and stupid. As a result, from the 1930s, the state began to treat the two groups differently and applied different policies to each and promoted the Baluba to positions above other ethnicities.|$|E

5|$|Red foxes may kill small mustelids like weasels, stone martens, pine martens, stoats, kolonoks, polecats {{and young}} sables.

5|$|Research by Chandler, Griffin, and Sorensen into a {{link between}} letter names and {{donations}} has been widely accepted.

5|$|Strepsirrhines are {{traditionally}} characterized by several symplesiomorphic (ancestral) traits not {{shared with the}} simians, particularly the rhinarium. Other symplesiomorphies include long snouts, convoluted maxilloturbinals, relatively large olfactory bulbs, and smaller brains. The toothcomb is a synapomorphy (shared, derived trait) seen among lemuriforms, although it is frequently and incorrectly used to define the strepsirrhine clade. Strepsirrhine primates are also united in possessing an epitheliochorial placenta. Unlike the tarsiers and simians, strepsirrhines are capable of producing their own vitamin C and do not need it supplied in their diet. Further genetic evidence {{for the relationship between}} tarsiers and simians as a haplorhine clade is <b>the</b> <b>shared</b> possession of three SINE markers.|$|E
50|$|Because {{investment}} firms offering nominee services are the legal owners of <b>the</b> <b>shares,</b> {{there remains a}} risk of improper behavior causing <b>the</b> <b>shares</b> to be lost.

The UK Financial Services Compensation Scheme http://www.fscs.org.uk/what-we-cover/eligibility-rules/when-is-fscs-cover-triggered/ compensates investors on the failure of an investment firm. However the limit in June 2015 stood at only £50,000 per person per investment firm http://www.fscs.org.uk/what-we-cover/eligibility-rules/compensation-limits/investment-limits and losses above this amount would not be covered.
