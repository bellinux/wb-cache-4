5|$|On August 23, 1954, a D train {{relaying}} east of {{the station}} overshot the bumper blocks {{at the end of}} the track, crashing into the wall at <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line.</b> The train motorman was trapped in the tunnel for seven hours, and when he was freed, his left foot had to be amputated.|$|E
5|$|Debates ensued {{over the}} fate of the Marysvale branch line. The mines at <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> had long closed; the last train to {{traverse}} {{the entire length of the}} line passed through in 1970. Still, farmers and industry in the Sevier and Sanpete Valleys generated enough traffic that the line broke even most years. However, this line was severely damaged, with several washed-out bridges and railroad tracks draping over the sides of newly created cliffs. The railroad determined that at best it would take years to recover the cost of rebuilding the line.|$|E
5|$|The Chicago Transit Authority {{displaced}} the Carlton Midway Inn {{to open a}} new CTA terminal at {{the airport}} on October 31, 1993, for the new Chicago 'L' Orange Line that connected Midway to Chicago's Loop. Midway Airport is <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line,</b> which crosses the southwest part of the city before ending at the Loop. The Orange Line does not run 24 hours a day (unlike the Blue Line, which has 24-hour service to O'Hare), but does operate from about 4:00am to 1:00am, at an average of 8-minute intervals. The trip from Midway to the Loop takes 25 minutes.|$|E

5|$|The line {{judge is}} {{positioned}} on <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> of scrimmage, opposite the head linesman. He or she supervises player substitutions, {{the line of}} scrimmage during punts, and game timing. He notifies the referee when time has expired {{at the end of a}} quarter and notifies the head coach of the home team when five minutes remain for halftime. In the NFL, the line judge also alerts the referee when two minutes remain in the half. If the clock malfunctions or becomes inoperable, the line judge becomes the official timekeeper.|$|E
5|$|An {{event on}} July 6, 1944 derailed Robinson's {{military}} career. While awaiting results of hospital {{tests on the}} ankle he had injured in junior college, Robinson boarded an Army bus with a fellow officer's wife; although the Army had commissioned its own unsegregated bus line, the bus driver ordered Robinson {{to move to the}} back of the bus. Robinson refused. The driver backed down, but after reaching <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line,</b> summoned the military police, who took Robinson into custody. When Robinson later confronted the investigating duty officer about racist questioning by the officer and his assistant, the officer recommended Robinson be court-martialed. After Robinson's commander in the 761st, Paul L. Bates, refused to authorize the legal action, Robinson was summarily transferred to the 758th Battalion—where the commander quickly consented to charge Robinson with multiple offenses, including, among other charges, public drunkenness, even though Robinson did not drink.|$|E
5|$|On 5 February 2015, Network Rail's tracklaying machine reached <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> at Tweedbank {{station where}} {{a large crowd}} had gathered. As {{there was not enough}} track for the train to {{complete}} tracklaying into the second platform, it had to return the next day. The formal completion took place on 12 February when Keith Brown clipped the final length of rail into place. During the period of construction, more than 1,000 rails were laid across 90,000 sleepers. With the infrastructure complete, attention was turned to the installation of signalling and communications equipment as well as finalising the stations. A GSM-R system controlled from the IECC next to Edinburgh Waverley was in place by April 2015.|$|E

5|$|Since the application, {{there had}} been a {{technological}} development within tramways. Barth started working with the plans, and proposed that the line be built as a light rail in its own right-of-way, {{similar to that of the}} Holmenkollen Line and the Røa Line on the west side of town. This would allow higher speeds. The plans called for the line to run on the east side of Kongsvien until Holtet, after which it would cross the road and continue on the west side Ekebergveien, until it reached Nordstrandsveien. <b>The</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> would have a balloon loop. After the revised plans were approved by the authorities, construction started in August 1914. Most of the works were finished in 1917. The original line consisted of double track from Oslo Hospital to Sjømannsskolen, and single track from Sjømannsskolen to Sæter. Holtet received a passing loop, in addition to the line's depot. The parish hall at Sæter was bought and made a combined station and office.|$|E
5|$|In general appearance, {{the current}} {{operating}} line of SIR looks somewhat like an outdoor {{line of the}} New York City Subway. Since the 1960s, it has been grade separated from all roads, but it runs more or less at street level for a brief stretch north of Clifton, between the Grasmere and Old Town stations, and from south of the Pleasant Plains station to Tottenville, <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>line.</b> It uses NYC Transit-standard 600 V DC third rail power. Its equipment are R44 subway type cars that are specially modified with headlight dimmers, electric windshield defrosters, FRA Compliant cab signals and horns, and FRA regulation 223 required shatterproof glazing, and exterior mounted grab rails near the side doors. The cars were built in early 1973, {{at the tail end}} of the R44 order of subway cars for New York City Transit (the Staten Island R44s being the last cars built by the St. Louis Car Company). Heavy maintenance of the equipment is performed at NYCT's Clifton Shops. Any work that cannot be performed at Clifton requires the cars to be trucked over the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge to the subway's Coney Island Complex shops in Brooklyn. The right-of-way also includes elevated, embankment and open-cut portions, and a tunnel near St. George.|$|E
