5|$|An {{individuals}} {{right to}} privacy is one area of digital forensics which is still largely undecided by courts. The US Electronic Communications Privacy Act places limitations {{on the ability of}} law enforcement or civil investigators to intercept and access evidence. The act makes a distinction between stored communication (e.g. email archives) and transmitted communication (such as VOIP). The latter, being considered more of a privacy invasion, is harder to obtain a warrant for. The ECPA also affects the ability of companies to investigate the computers and communications of their employees, an aspect that is still under debate as <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>to</b> which a company can perform such monitoring.|$|E
5|$|The royal {{prerogative}} is in much {{use in the}} realm of foreign affairs. It is the monarch who recognises foreign states (although several statutes regulate the immunities enjoyed by their heads and diplomatic representatives), issues declarations of war and peace, and forms international treaties. The monarch also has the power to annexe territory, as was done in 1955 with the island of Rockall. Once territory has been annexed, the monarch has complete discretion as <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>to</b> which the government will take over the former government's liabilities; this was confirmed in West Rand Central Gold Mining Company v The King. The monarch also has the power to alter British territorial waters and cede territory. Her freedom to do these things in practice is doubtful, in that they might deprive British citizens of their nationality and rights. When the island of Heligoland was ceded to Germany in 1890, Parliamentary approval was first sought. The monarch can also regulate colonies and dependent territories by exercising the prerogative through Orders in Council. The courts have long fought against the monarch's use of this power: in R (Bancoult) v Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (No 2), the Court of Appeal ruled that using Orders-in-Council to frustrate judicial rulings was an unlawful abuse of power, although this ruling was later overturned.|$|E

25|$|Bull Durham Smoking Tobacco {{advertising}} {{had success}} due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>to</b> which {{the product was}} branded. Green and later the Blackwell Company established the bull as the logo for “Genuine Durham Smoking Tobacco” {{in order to help}} do this. The logo of the bull evidently comes from “Durham Mustard” containers from Durham, England. With the establishment of the logo, the Blackwell Company extended the branding idea, putting the bull logo on all advertisements and labels. This logo would eventually be “one of most recognizable product advertisements around the country.” Beyond the creation of the trademark icon, the “Established 1865” phrase appeared in association with Bull Durham. This helped to protect against trademark infringements, a very common occurrence due to the wild success of “Genuine Bull Durham Smoking Tobacco.” The repetition of advertisements with the bull and an established line helped to brand the name and make Bull Durham familiar to people of all ages.|$|E
25|$|Galbraith's main ideas focused {{around the}} {{influence}} of the market power of large corporations. He believed that this market power weakened the widely accepted principle of consumer sovereignty, allowing corporations to be price makers, rather than price takers, allowing corporations with the strongest market power to increase the production of their goods beyond an efficient amount. He further believed that market power {{played a major role in}} inflation. He argued that corporations and trade unions could only increase prices <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>to</b> which that their market power allowed. He argued that in situations of excessive market power, price controls effectively controlled inflation, but cautioned against using them in markets that were basically efficient such as agricultural goods and housing. He noted that price controls were much easier to enforce in industries with relatively few buyers and sellers. Galbraith's view of market power was not entirely negative; he also noted that the power of U.S. firms played a part in the success of the U.S. economy.|$|E

25|$|Close {{air support}} was {{provided}} {{in the form of}} the dive bomber and medium bomber. They would support the focal point of attack from the air. German successes are closely related <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>to</b> which the German Luftwaffe was able to control the air war in early campaigns in Western and Central Europe, and the Soviet Union. However, the Luftwaffe was a broadly based force with no constricting central doctrine, other than its resources should be used generally to support national strategy. It was flexible and it was able to carry out both operational-tactical, and strategic bombing. Flexibility was the Luftwaffe's strength in 1939–1941. Paradoxically, from that period onward it became its weakness. While Allied Air Forces were tied to the support of the Army, the Luftwaffe deployed its resources in a more general, operational way. It switched from air superiority missions, to medium-range interdiction, to strategic strikes, to close support duties depending on the need of the ground forces. In fact, far from it being a specialist panzer spearhead arm, fewer than 15 percent of the Luftwaffe was intended for close support of the army in 1939.|$|E
25|$|Regarding {{the extent}} of trust they had in {{different}} societal groups, the children indicated that they most trusted their mother (85% totally; 7% quite) and their father (71% totally; 15% quite). They also asserted that they least trusted the police (3% not very much; 7% not at all) and the mass media (3% not very much; 5% not at all). Additionally, the majority of children reported being aware of their rights (78%), with their right to education (72%), right not to be hurt or mistreated (63%), and right to health (62%) most widely recognized. With regard <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>to</b> which various rights are respected in Somalia, most children felt that their main rights were respected, {{including the right to}} education (58% totally; 19% quite; 3% not quite; 1% not at all; 11% don't know; 7% no response), right not to be mistreated (46% totally; 24% quite; 4% not quite; 5% not at all; 14% don't know; 8% no response), and right to health (52% totally; 22% quite; 3% not quite; 3% not at all; 12% don't know; 7% no response). Regarding their general state of happiness, 86% of children reported feeling happy, 10% were neither happy nor unhappy, and 3% were unhappy. A majority of the children also indicated that the quality of their relationship with their parents was very good (72%), followed by good (17%).|$|E
500|$|The Donegal {{style of}} {{fiddling}} is a label often applied to music from this area, though one also might plausibly identify several different, but related, styles within the county. <b>To</b> <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>to</b> {{which there is}} one common style in the county, {{it is characterised by}} a rapid pace; a tendency to be more un-swung in the playing of the fast dance tune types (reel and jigs); short (non-slurred), aggressive bowing, sparse ornamentation, the use of bowed triplets more often than trills as ornaments, the use of double stops and droning; and the occurrence of [...] "playing the octave", with one player playing the melody and the other playing the melody an octave lower. None of these characteristics are universal, and there is some disagreement as <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>to</b> which there is a common style at all.
