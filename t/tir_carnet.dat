50|$|Truckers {{making use}} of the TIR {{procedure}} must first obtain an internationally harmonised customs document, {{referred to as a}} <b>TIR</b> <b>carnet.</b> TIR carnets are issued by national road transport associations. This customs document is valid internationally and as well as describing the goods, their shipper and their destination, represents a financial guarantee. When a truck arrives at a border customs post it need not pay import duties and taxes on goods at that time. Instead the payments are suspended. If the vehicle transits the country without delivering any goods, no taxes are due. If it fails to leave the country with all the goods, then the taxes are billed to the importer and the financial guarantee backstops the importer's obligation to pay the taxes. TIR transits are carried out in bond, i.e. the lorry must be sealed as well as bearing the carnet. The security payment system is administered by the International Road Transport Union (IRU).|$|E
40|$|Master's {{thesis is}} {{dedicated}} {{to one of the}} most effective international treaties, which attends to facilitating and liberalization of international handling with goods, functioning for almost 40 years. This paper mainly describes the situation, which appeared in 2013, when the barriers for its application emerged. It tells about the crisis of <b>TIR</b> <b>Carnet</b> on the Russian territory, caused by some intern factors as well as factors on the international level. Affairs and changes, arisen in the beginning of the 21 st century (expanding of the EU, new goods transportation methods, Customs Union, etc.) drove to the loss of TIR treaty's significance, and to the necessity of creating new international cooperation principles. Situation then changed due to the civil war in Ukraine, sanctions against Russia and Russian response. That is why the ground, reasons and consequences of <b>TIR</b> <b>Carnet</b> crisis on the Russian territory were in detail described in the master's thesis. Main conclusion is that this crisis only predicts the beginning of serious changes in international transport of goods, which can be faced in the nearest future...|$|E
