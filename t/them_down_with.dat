5|$|Moe is {{impressed}} by Homer's ability to absorb severe punishment and suggests he take up boxing, with Moe – a former boxer himself – as his trainer and manager. Marge is annoyed by the idea, but a medical test diagnoses Homer {{with a rare}} genetic abnormality effectively rendering him near-invulnerable to knockout punches. While training, it is discovered that Homer is a weak puncher, and is extremely out of shape. Moe strategizes that Homer should stand still in the ring and let his opponents exhaust themselves trying to knock him out, and then knock <b>them</b> <b>down</b> <b>with</b> a tap.|$|E
5|$|BioShock is a first-person shooter with {{role-playing}} game customization and stealth elements, and {{is similar}} to System Shock 2. The player takes the role of Jack as he is guided through Rapture towards various objectives. The player collects various weapons and plasmids as they work their way through enemy forces. The player can switch between one active weapon and one active plasmid at any time, allowing them to find combination attacks that can be effective against certain enemies, such as first shocking a Splicer then striking <b>them</b> <b>down</b> <b>with</b> a wrench. Weapons are limited by ammunition that the player collects; many weapons have secondary ammo types {{that can be used}} instead for additional benefits, such as bullets that inflict fire damage. Plasmid use consumes a serum called EVE which can be restored using EVE syringes collected by the player. The player has a health meter that decreases when they take damage. The player can restore their health with medical packs found throughout Rapture. If the player's health reduces to zero, they will be regenerated at the last Vita-Chamber that they passed with limited amounts of health and EVE. A patch for the game allows players to disable these Vita-Chambers, requiring players to restart a saved game if the character dies.|$|E
5|$|David Adler's book {{contains}} {{a detailed account}} of the event that made the Fool's Gold Loaf sandwich famous. On the night of February 1, 1976, Elvis Presley was at his home at Graceland in Memphis, entertaining Capt. Jerry Kennedy of the Denver, Colorado police force, and Ron Pietrafeso of Colorado's Strike Force Against Crime. The three men began discussing the sandwich, and Presley decided he wanted one right then. Presley had been to the restaurant before, while in Denver. Kennedy and Pietrafeso were friends of the owners and hung out there often, so they were driven to the Memphis airport and boarded Presley's private jet, the Lisa Marie, and flew the two hours to Denver. When they arrived at Stapleton International Airport at 1:40 AM, the plane taxied to a special hangar where the passengers were greeted by Buck Scott, the owner of the Colorado Mine Company, and his wife Cindy who had brought 30 fresh Fool's Gold Loaves for the men. They spent two hours in the hangar eating the sandwiches, washing <b>them</b> <b>down</b> <b>with</b> Perrier and champagne. Presley invited the pilots of the plane, Milo High and Elwood Davis, to join them. When they were done, they flew back to Memphis without ever having left the Denver airport.|$|E

25|$|The Liars team up {{with their}} {{significant}} others to prove Alison killed Mona. Through the clues Mona left for them, {{they were able to}} prove that not only she was responsible for Mona's murder, but for Bethany's murder as well, clearing Spencer of the charges in the process. However, the girls realize someone is still helping Alison, who they now believe was trying to drag <b>them</b> <b>down</b> <b>with</b> her in jail. Their initial suspect was Detective Holbrook, but Holbrook reveals to Hanna that Alison cut him off. They later discover that Mike, Aria's brother, has been secretly visiting Alison in jail, leading the girls to suspect that he was helping Ali.

25|$|On November 14, 2010, Electroshock officially {{announced}} that he was not part of La Sociedad and urged his stablemates Silver King and Último Gladiador to leave the group. At the November 18 event in Naucalpan Electroshock once again turned down an offer to join La Sociedad and was as a result beaten down by Silver King, Último Gladiador and La Milicia. On November 28 the man who had attacked Octagón prior to Héroes Inmortales IV was revealed as Super Fly, when he attacked Octagón and his fellow Real Fuerza Aérea co–leader Aero Star and beat <b>them</b> <b>down</b> <b>with</b> help from La Milicia. On December 5 at Guerra de Titanes El Zorro defeated Dr. Wagner Jr., with help from his La Sociedad stable mates, to win the AAA Mega Championship. In the main event of the evening Damián 666, Halloween and X-Fly of Los Perros del Mal faced Los Psycho Circus (Monster Clown, Murder Clown and Psycho Clown), a trio, who hadn't lost a single match since their debut in December 2007, in an elimination steel cage weapons match. In the end of the match, someone wearing a Monster Clown mask climbed up the cage and prevented Murder Clown from escaping. After the man had dropped Murder Clown back into the cage, Halloween climbed out of the cage to win the match and end Los Psycho Circus long undefeated streak. Afterwards, the man who had interfered in the match was revealed as El Hijo del Perro Aguayo, who had suffered a knee injury after his match with El Mesías and was supposed to be out of action {{for the rest of the}} year.|$|E
500|$|From {{numerous}} {{visits to}} radar stations before his flights, Overton memorized {{where and how}} the Soviet pilots landed {{as well as how}} long they stayed airborne. He then told radar men at Cho-do Airport to inform him when Soviet pilots took off, allowing him to ambush them. Using this information, Overton would fly in a racetrack pattern between the MiGs landing zones and the sun, preventing them from spotting him as they made their landing approaches. Overton would then fall in behind the formations of Soviet fighters as they began their landings, shooting <b>them</b> <b>down</b> <b>with</b> minimal resistance. All of his subsequent victories were described as [...] "parallel intercepts, non-deflection shots from close range without using the radar ranging feature on the Sabre's gunsight." ...|$|E

500|$|Despite the new programme, some of Quisling's circle still favoured {{a cabinet}} coup. He later {{said he had}} even {{considered}} {{the use of force}} to overthrow the government but, in late February, it was the Liberal Party that brought <b>them</b> <b>down.</b> <b>With</b> the assistance of Hjort and Prytz, Nordisk folkereisning i Norge quickly became a political party, Nasjonal Samling, or NS, literally [...] "National Unity," [...] ready to contest the forthcoming October election. Quisling was mildly disappointed and would have preferred to head a national movement, not just one of seven political parties. Nasjonal Samling soon afterwards announced it would support candidates from other parties if they supported its key aim of [...] "establishing a strong and stable national government independent of ordinary party politics." [...] Although not an overnight success in the already crowded political spectrum, the party slowly gained support. With its Nazi-inspired belief in the central authority of a strong Führer, as well as its powerful propaganda elements, it gained support from many among the Oslo upper classes, and began {{to give the impression that}} [...] "big money" [...] lay behind it.|$|E
500|$|The Boer commander, Commandant Cornelius Wessels, {{presented}} Kekewich with {{an ultimatum}} on 4 November, demanding the town's surrender. [...] Kekewich replied the same day, stating: [...] "...you are hereby invited {{to effect the}} occupation of this town as an operation of war by the employment of the military forces under your command." [...] When the siege of Kimberley itself began in earnest on 6November, the situation favoured an attack. The Boers were {{in control of the}} railway from the Orange River to Mafeking, while arms and ammunition were in short supply in Kimberley. [...] On 7November, the Boers started shelling the town. [...] Communication with the outside world was not seriously impeded however. [...] The Boer strategy was not to attack the town in a full battle, but rather to wait for the defenders to capitulate, all the time wearing <b>them</b> <b>down</b> <b>with</b> shelling. [...] The defenders tried to send the large contingent of migrant native labourers that was working in the mines home, but twice the Boers drove them back into the town in an apparent attempt to put pressure on the limited food and water supply.|$|E

500|$|On 25 May, 3 RAR began local {{defensive}} and familiarisation patrols. Four Centurion tanks from 2 Troop, C Squadron {{were ordered to}} redeploy to FSB Balmoral to bolster the defences, escorted by two infantry platoons from B Company, 1 RAR under Captain Bob Hennessy. En route, the North Vietnamese contacted the Australian infantry {{from a series of}} bunkers, pinning <b>them</b> <b>down</b> <b>with</b> machine-gun fire at close range. In response the Australian tanks moved forward, suppressing the bunkers with canister rounds while the infantry was extracted. The Australians had struck the edge of a large, defended base camp estimated at company-size, however under orders to continue to Balmoral before nightfall, they broke contact. The column subsequently arrived at FSB Balmoral without further incident at 15:30 and B Company, 1 RAR then returned to FSB Coral by helicopter. At least two North Vietnamese were killed in the encounter, while one Australian was wounded. Although a relatively minor action, the tanks had been decisive and the engagement was early proof of their effectiveness in co-operation with the infantry. Meanwhile, the North Vietnamese commander was no longer able to tolerate the Australian encroachment into his base areas, and with FSB Balmoral located just [...] away, he subsequently tasked the 165st Regiment—commanded by Phan Viet Dong—to attack Balmoral. That evening tracer rounds, shots and lights again alerted the defenders of an impending attack.|$|E
500|$|During {{the night}} of 27/28 March, patrols of the 47th Battalion had {{observed}} German troops on the Albert–Dernancourt road, on the open flats just [...] across the railway line, but the night passed without obvious signs of attack. Early in the morning, the German artillery fell heavily on the support lines and rear area, but initially was very light along the railway line. In the thick mist of early dawn, the commander of a small post of the 47th Battalion, stationed behind the embankment immediately north of the level crossing, {{heard the sound of}} bayonet scabbards flapping on the thighs of marching troops. Sergeant Stanley McDougall woke his comrades and they ran to alert nearby elements of the battalion. McDougall, running {{along the top of the}} embankment, saw German troops of II/229 RIR advancing along the whole front through the mist. Returning with a handful of men, he planned to deploy them behind the ungarrisoned bank to the south. By this time, Germans were throwing hand grenades over the embankment, and one exploded near a Lewis machine gun team in front of McDougall, badly wounding the two man crew. McDougall, who had previously been a Lewis gunner, grabbed the gun and began to fire it from the hip as he went. First he shot down two German light machine gun teams as they tried to cross the rails, then, running along the enemy edge of the embankment, saw about 20 Germans waiting for the signal to assault. He hosed <b>them</b> <b>down</b> <b>with</b> the gun, then as they ran, followed them with its fire. By this time, several of his comrades had been killed or wounded.|$|E

He commanded the left wing of the Polish-Lithuanian army in the victorious Battle of Berestechko on 28–30 June [...] The Polish-Lithuanian army advanced after the retreating Cossacks, but on July 17 the King [...] "left the whole army to Potocki... and having given the order that the army march into Ukraine, the King himself parted... to Warsaw to celebrate his victories over the Cossacks."

His cause of death was never known, while some (even contemporaries) speculated he was poisoned, but no conclusive evidence to support such a claim have ever been found. Based on sparse descriptions of his illness and subsequent investigations, some medical historians suggest the cause of death might have been a disease related to cholera. [...] However, one account states, [...] "following a cheerful conversation with other officers who had congregated for a military council in his tent on Sunday, 13 August N.S. he had eaten some cucumbers with zest and washed <b>them</b> <b>down</b> <b>with</b> mead, and from that contracted dysentery.
