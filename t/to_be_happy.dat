5|$|It's not literal {{about the}} drug for me, I've never taken lithium before. It's sort of a metaphor about {{numbness}} and happiness... it's me looking at happiness {{in a negative way}} because I've always been... kind of afraid <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>happy.</b> Like with the band and the art and everything else, it's always like I'm never letting myself break through into the happiness it seems like, because it's not cool or something. And describing happiness is lithium, it's like saying 'that's numbness, I won't be able to be an artist anymore if I'm happy', which is hilarious because that's just not true, I'm happy. So it's... this fight within the song of... 'do I do this and get out of here and get happy or do I wallow in it like I always do?' and it's cool because {{at the end of the}} song I say 'I'm going to let it go', like I am going <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>happy.</b>|$|E
5|$|Published {{commentators}} on the Roseberys {{claim their}} marriage was happy, {{and there is}} no known evidence that Hannah was anything other than happy in her marriage, and quite a lot to suggest she was indeed blissfully happy. However, much evidence suggests that Rosebery, while professing <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>happy,</b> was at times irritated and bored by Hannah, who was always keen to accommodate his every whim.|$|E
5|$|The {{doctrine}} {{emphasizes the}} importance of personal empowerment, proposing that it is God's will for his people <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>happy.</b> The atonement (reconciliation with God) is interpreted to include the alleviation of sickness and poverty, which are viewed as curses to be broken by faith. This is believed to be achieved through donations of money, visualization, and positive confession.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{know what}} you want with marrying at all, Fred. You ought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> very <b>happy</b> as you <b>are.</b> By heavens, I don't know any one who ought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>happier.</b> If I <b>were</b> you, I know--" ...|$|R

5|$|In late 1903, a {{baseball}} column {{suggested that the}} Detroit Tigers were interested in Shay, but he was said <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>happy</b> playing in California. During Shay's tenure in San Francisco, he got married. Shay went to spring training with the St. Louis Cardinals before the 1904 season. He impressed the team, prompting speculation that shortstop Dave Brain would move to third base and third baseman Jimmy Burke {{would serve as a}} utility infielder. Shay played 99 games for the Cardinals in 1904.|$|E
5|$|To {{help her}} escape this awkward {{domestic}} situation, Harriet's maternal aunt Henrietta arranged for her niece {{to marry her}} lover of seventeen years, Granville Leveson-Gower, 1st Earl Granville. The couple's marriage proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>happy,</b> and it produced five children. Granville served as his country's ambassador to France intermittently from 1824 to 1841, and he was awarded an earldom in 1833. With her position, Harriet acted as hostess to Parisian society, writing detailed accounts that were later published. She died in 1862 of a stroke, having been widowed fifteen years.|$|E
25|$|In general, {{conscientiousness}} has {{a positive}} relationship with subjective well-being, particularly satisfaction with life, so highly conscientious people tend <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>happier</b> with their lives than those who score low on this trait.|$|R
5000|$|Aglaus (Gr. [...] ) was a semi-mythological poor {{citizen of}} Psophis in Arcadia. When King Gyges, king of Lydia asked the Delphic oracle whether any man <b>was</b> <b>happier</b> than he <b>was,</b> the oracle {{pronounced}} Aglaus <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>happier</b> {{on account of}} his contentedness. Pausanias places Aglaus in the time of Croesus.|$|R

5|$|As a spouse, surgeon, and mother, Meredith has cited {{a number}} times {{that she did}} not want to be like either of her parents: her father had {{followed}} her mother around pathetically before leaving <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>happy,</b> while her mother valued her career over her family. Meredith is frequently conflicted trying to balance between the two, and fears her family are hindering her medical aspirations, as much as she fears becoming like her mother whenever she's tempted to choose surgery over family. Meredith and Cristina have a huge rift when Cristina confirms Meredith's fears by stating that Meredith's skills have fallen behind Cristina's due to her familial obligations taking her away from OR time.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the day, Erin {{tries to}} break up with Andy, saying she no longer loves him and is angry that he left and barely communicated with her. Andy vehemently protests the breakup and says their {{relationship}} can work out if she just pretends to still love him. Erin walks outside to Pete, saying she could not do it. Pete tells her he is okay with this, since all he wants is for her <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>happy.</b> Emboldened by this, she gives him a kiss, runs back up to Andy's office, and breaks up with him. In her brief breakup speech she repeats her complaints about his three-month absence, not realizing that he is talking to David Wallace on speakerphone.|$|E
5|$|Zombiepowder. began {{serialization}} in Shueisha's Weekly Shōnen Jump in 1999, {{and ran a}} brief 27 chapters {{before being}} canceled in 2000. According to the author's commentary in the cover leaf of the third volume, Tite Kubo {{was in a state}} of severe emotional trauma when he wrote it, and only began <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>happy</b> with the quality of the series as it neared its ending. Speaking retrospectively 12 years later, Kubo stated that he was not yet used to the scheduling pressures of weekly serialization when he wrote Zombiepowder., and that at the time he paid too much attention to his editor's comments rather than trusting his own ideas. Other than Tite Kubo, Zombiepowder. had five credited staff, though their specific roles in its production were never specified.|$|E
6000|$|Her husband answered: [...] "She's the {{potentiality}} {{of several}} kinds of fanatic. She's very unhappy, and I don't see how she's <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>happier</b> about that poor fellow. I shouldn't be surprised if she did inspire him to attempt something of that kind." ...|$|R
40|$|Using {{information}} from the US General Social Survey (GSS) between 1972 and 2006, we {{examine the effects of}} political affiliation on happiness. Regression results show that Republicans <b>are</b> always <b>happier</b> than Democrats, but members of both parties tend <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>happier</b> during a Democratic presidential administration. We do not find compelling evidence that Americans <b>are</b> <b>happier</b> when their own political party is in power. ...|$|R

"My Dear Old Mason--I {{have just}} heard from {{a friend of mine}} who has been staying in your neighbourhood, that you <b>are</b> well and <b>happy,</b> and that you have been making {{inquiries}} after your young scapegrace, Tom Newcome, who <b>is</b> well and <b>happy</b> too, and who proposes <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>happier</b> still before any very long time is over.|$|R

60|$|The {{old times}} at Trevorsham {{seem to me}} so remote, that I can hardly {{believe that we are}} the same who <b>were</b> so <b>happy</b> then. Nay, Jaquetta laughs, and {{declares}} that it <b>is</b> not possible <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>happier</b> than we have been since, and Fulk would have me remember that all was not always smooth even in those days.|$|R

The ball has fewer seams, reducing air resistance and thus altering flight patterns.|$|E

30|$|Layard {{writes about}} 'rampant individualism', but {{research}} shows people <b>are</b> <b>happier</b> in individualistic society (Veenhoven 1999) {{and one of}} the probable reasons is that individualism enhances the chance that one leads a life that fits one's preferences and capacities. How about the modern time stress? Research shows that people tend <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>happier</b> in countries where the pace of life is high (Garhammer 2002) {{and one of the}} reasons seems <b>to</b> <b>be</b> that such societies appeal more to the human need for challenge.|$|R
