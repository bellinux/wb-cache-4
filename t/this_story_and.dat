5|$|On the 60th {{anniversary of}} the sinking, 60 Minutes ran a story demonstrating that the wreck was not Centaur. It was {{revealed}} that nobody at the Queensland Maritime Museum had yet seen Dennis' footage, {{and when it was}} shown to Museum president Rod McLeod and maritime historian John Foley, they stated that the shipwreck could not be Centaur due to physical inconsistencies, such as an incorrect rudder. Following <b>this</b> <b>story,</b> <b>and</b> others published around the same time in newspapers, the Navy sent three ships to inspect the site over a two-month period; HMA Ships , , and , before concluding that the shipwreck was incorrectly identified as Centaur. An amendment was made to the gazettal, and the Hydrographic Office began to remove the mark from charts.|$|E

She says to {{him that}} a boy has agreed to marry her, but she is reluctant. She asks Yogesh to give her time {{to decide what to do}} about her boyfriend. He agrees, telling her about his {{problems}} with Jitu. Sanjana, touched that Yogesh will help her despite his own problems, hugs him. Devu walks in, and thinks he has interrupted them; Sanjana chases him, trying to explain. Tailing Devu, the detective is unaware that he had been with Anila at a hotel and sees him with Sanjana.

Devu thinks Yogesh betrayed him, and Yogesh thinks Devu is having an affair with Sanjana.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{begins with}} Peggy's {{day and a}} heated {{argument}} with her boyfriend Abe, over her preoccupation with work and the effect this has on their sex life. The argument ends with Abe's leaving in a huff. After Don pulls Megan away for an impromptu trip to a Howard Johnson's hotel in upstate New York, Peggy has to pitch to the Heinz executives without them and unsuccessfully tries to sell the Heinz executives on her concept. Frustrated, she leaves work, {{has a couple of}} drinks, and goes to see the film Born Free (1966). She sees a young man smoking marijuana behind her, partakes herself, and eventually gives him a hand job. She returns to her office to see Ginsberg arguing with his father. After being told off by Ginsberg for eavesdropping, she falls asleep in Don's office. She awakens to a call from Don, who seems alarmed for incomprehensible reasons.

25|$|The key to {{the early}} renown of the raintree stemmed from the {{apocryphal}} story {{that it was a}} panacea for drought stricken districts through the ability of its leaves to condense moisture out of the air, retain it in large quantities and then expel it through its leaves and trunk. <b>This</b> <b>story,</b> <b>and</b> how it had been disproved, was discussed in two 1911 articles from the Port Douglas and Mossman Record. Otherwise it was seriously considered as a useful crop for the fodder its large seed pods provided for cattle.|$|E
25|$|Travers {{followed}} The Dippers {{with another}} farcical novel, A Cuckoo in the Nest, published in 1922. Again reviewers praised its humour, and again Travers {{turned it into}} a playscript. The actor Lawrence Grossmith spotted the dramatic possibilities of <b>this</b> <b>story,</b> <b>and</b> he acquired the performing rights to the play. Before Grossmith had time to produce the piece, he had an offer from the actor-manager Tom Walls to buy the rights.

500|$|Reviewers of {{the short}} story {{collection}} highlighted this tale, one calling it [...] "the most striking story" [...] of the volume and [...] "a staunchly feminist take on power relations".

500|$|It {{has been}} widely recounted in {{histories}} of this battle that General Arnold was on the field, directing some of the action.

Arnold biographer James Kirby Martin, however, disagrees with Luzader, arguing that Arnold played {{a more active role}} at Freeman's Farm by directing patriot troops into position and possibly leading some charges before being ordered back to headquarters by Gates.|$|E
500|$|In [...] "The Wife of His Youth", Charles Chesnutt {{does not}} explore the {{relationship}} between whites and mulattoes; instead, the story is concerned with race consciousness among those of mixed race, both from the North and South. Scholar William L. Andrews notes that <b>this</b> <b>story,</b> <b>and</b> others like it including [...] "A Matter of Principle", were unprecedented. Chesnutt [...] "broke the ice in the American fiction of manners." [...] Like the other Blue Veins, Ryder has idealized whiteness and dreams of becoming white or, as Chesnutt writes it, [...] " [...] absorption by the white race." [...] This is symbolized by his reading [...] "A Dream of Fair Women" [...] by Alfred, Lord Tennyson when his wife first appears in the story.|$|E
500|$|Several {{scholars}} {{have attempted to}} find a real-world correspondence for Gawain's journey to the Green Chapel. The Anglesey islands, for example, are mentioned in the poem. They exist today as a single {{island off the coast}} of Wales. In line 700, Gawain is said to pass the [...] "Holy Head", believed by many scholars to be either Holywell or the Cistercian abbey of Poulton in Pulford. Holywell is associated with the beheading of Saint Winifred. As the story goes, Winifred was a virgin who was beheaded by a local leader after she refused his sexual advances. Her uncle, another saint, put her head back in place and healed the wound, leaving only a white scar. The parallels between <b>this</b> <b>story</b> <b>and</b> Gawain's make this area a likely candidate for the journey.|$|E
