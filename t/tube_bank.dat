25|$|The Woolnough {{design was}} used by Sentinel for their larger railway locomotives. It resembled most other three-drum designs, having almost-straight tubes. Its {{distinguishing}} feature was a firebrick wall {{two-thirds of the way}} down the furnace. The furnace grate was on the longer side of this, with the combustion gases passing out through the <b>tube</b> <b>bank,</b> along inside a steel outer casing, then back within the shorter <b>tube</b> <b>bank.</b> Coiled tube superheaters were placed in the gas flow outside the tubes. The combustion gases thus passed through the <b>tube</b> <b>bank</b> twice, once outwards and then again inwards. A single central chimney exhausted from the centre of the far end, not as usual from outside the tubes. The relative temperature difference between gas passage through the two sections of the bank led to a circulation current that was upwards through the first, hotter, part of the bank and downwards through the further, less hot, bank. Circulation was also controlled by an internal weir plate within the upper water drum, so as to keep a depth of water above the ends of the hotter tubes, thus avoiding overheating of dry tubes.|$|E
25|$|Separate {{downcomers}} {{were used}} by most designs, even after Yarrow's experiments had demonstrated that circulation could still take place amongst the heated tubes alone.

25|$|The Thornycroft boiler is {{a variant}} that splits the usual central furnace into two. There are four drums: two main drums {{vertically}} in the centre – a steam and a water drum – also two wing drums {{at the outside}} edges of the furnace. The design was notable for its early use of the water-wall furnace. The outer bank of tubes was shallow, consisting of only two rows of tubes. These rows were spaced closely, so that the tubes formed a solid wall, without gasflow between them. The inner bank of tubes was similar: the two rows of tubes closest to the furnace formed a similar water wall. These tubes were splayed apart at their base, so as to provide space for gasflow between them. Within the <b>tube</b> <b>bank,</b> gas flow is mostly parallel to the tubes, similar to some early designs, but contrary to the crossflow design of later three-drum boilers. The exhaust gas emerged into the heart-shaped space below the upper central drum, exiting to the funnel through the rear wall.|$|E

2500|$|Firing {{was with}} coal, at just one end through a {{conventional}} locomotive single firedoor, {{and a single}} manual fireman. Owing to the single-ended firing and the predominantly longitudinal gasflow, compared to the Yarrow's normal through-bank gasflow, there was a pronounced temperature difference between {{the front and back}} of the boiler. This led to the water circulation currents, especially in the second section, to be longitudinal through the water drums, like the Woolnough, rather than the usual Yarrow. [...] The first section, which included some water-tubes to the rear wall, was radiant heated and effectively a water-wall furnace, without any gas flow through the <b>tube</b> <b>bank.</b> Despite this, it still used four rows of tubes. The second section had its gasflow arranged by steel and firebrick baffles so that the combustion gases entered through the centre and passed through the tube banks into the side flues, giving better convective heat transfer.|$|E
2500|$|The White-Forster was {{of simple}} construction, with tubes that {{had only a}} gentle {{curvature}} to them. This was sufficient {{to allow them to}} be replaced in-situ, working through the manhole {{at the end of the}} large steam drum. Each tube was sufficiently curved to allow it to be extracted through the steam drum, but sufficiently straight that a single tube could be replaced from a <b>tube</b> <b>bank,</b> without requiring other tubes to be removed so as to permit access. This was one of many features of the White-Forster intended to make it reliable in naval service and easy to maintain. These tubes were of particularly small diameter, only [...] and especially numerous, a total of 3,744 being used in some boilers. The tubes were arranged in 24 rows to a bank, each requiring a different length of tube, and 78 rows per drum. All tubes were curved to the same radius, facilitating repair and replacement on board, but requiring the tube holes in the drums to be reamed to precise angles on a jig during manufacture. This small tube diameter gave a high heating surface, but probably too much: the ratio of surface to volume became excessive and gas flow through the tube banks was affected, giving the boiler furnaces something of a reputation as poor burners.|$|E

For example in the power generation field, as the thermal power generation occupied 60 % of the power generation demand, the improvement of the thermal efficiency is required considerably. To attain this purpose, heat transfer tubes used for a heat exchanger for recovering exhaust heat from gas turbine in combined cycle type power generation must exhibit high heat transfer and low pressure drop. A spiral finned tube with an extended fin has recently been used for this purpose.
