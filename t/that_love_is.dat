25|$|In her book, Love's Rite, Ruth Vanita {{examines}} the phenomena of same-sex weddings, many by Hindu rites, {{which have been}} reported by the Indian press over {{the last thirty years}} and with increasing frequency. In the same period, same-sex joint suicides have also been reported. Most of these marriages and suicides are by lower middle-class female couples from small towns and rural areas across the country; these women have no contact with any LGBT movements. Both cross-sex and same-sex couples, when faced with family opposition, tend to resort to either elopement and marriage or to joint suicide in the hope of reunion in the next life. Vanita examines how Hindu doctrines such as rebirth and the genderlessness of the soul are often interpreted to legitimize socially disapproved relationships, including same-sex ones. In a 2004 survey, most — though not all — swamis said they opposed the concept of a Hindu-sanctified gay marriage. But several Hindu priests have performed same-sex marriages, arguing <b>that</b> <b>love</b> <b>is</b> the result of attachments from previous births and that marriage, as a union of spirit, is transcendental to gender.|$|E
