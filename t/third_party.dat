40|$|<b>Third</b> <b>parties</b> play a {{prominent}} role in network-based explanations for successful knowledge transfer. <b>Third</b> <b>parties</b> can be either shared or unshared. Shared <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> signal insider status and have a predictable positive effect on knowledge transfer. Unshared <b>third</b> <b>parties,</b> however, signal outsider status and are believed to undermine knowledge transfer. Surprisingly, unshared <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> have been ignored in empirical analysis, and so we do not know if or how much unshared <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> contribute to the process. Using knowledge transfer data from an online technical forum, we illustrate how unshared <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> affect the rate at which individuals initiate and sustain knowledge transfer relationships. Empirical results indicate that unshared <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> undermine knowledge sharing, and they also indicate that the magnitude of the negative unshared-third-party effect declines the more unshared <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> overlap in what they know. Our results provide a more complete view of how <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> contribute to knowledge sharing. The results also advance our understanding of network-based dynamics defined more broadly. By documenting how knowledge overlap among unshared <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> moderates their negative influence, our results show when the benefits provided by <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> and by bridges (i. e., relationships with outsiders) will be opposed versus when both can be enjoyed...|$|R
40|$|This article {{systematically}} {{examines the}} varying effectiveness of African and non-African <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> in mediating civil wars in Africa. Drawing {{on data from}} the Uppsala Conflict Data Program, supplemented with unique data on mediation efforts, which together cover all mediation efforts in civil wars in Africa between 1960 and 2012, this article presents quantitative evidence supporting the effectiveness of African <b>third</b> <b>parties.</b> Compared to non-African <b>third</b> <b>parties,</b> African <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> {{are far more likely}} to conclude peace agreements and these peace agreements are more likely to be durable. Most effective, however, are mixed mediation efforts in which there is coordination between African and non-African <b>third</b> <b>parties,</b> but in which African <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> take the lead. The phrase, ‘African solutions to African challenges’ should thus be understood as a division of labour and responsibilities, rather than an excuse for non-African <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> to ignore Africa’s problems or African <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> acting on their own. Indeed, whilst African <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> should take the lead in mediation processes in African civil wars, non-African <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> should support these processes by lending additional strength. Through supplementing each other’s comparative advantages, African and non-African <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> can more effectively resolve civil wars in Africa...|$|R

5|$|An agency {{relationship}} is between three parties - a principal, who authorises an agent {{to make a}} contract on his behalf with a <b>third</b> <b>party.</b> In agency situations an agent can make a contract with a <b>third</b> <b>party</b> that is binding on the principal, even though he was not privy to the original contract. The right of an agent to make this sort of agreement is found in statute, such as the Consumer Credit Act 1974 which allows a dealer for a financial company to set up credit agreements as a representative of that company.|$|E

5|$|The second rule of privity, that a <b>third</b> <b>party</b> cannot claim {{benefits}} from a contract, was widely criticised by academics, {{members of the}} judiciary and legal professionals.

Two studies support these predictions by demonstrating that unilaterally affiliated <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> engage in ingroup favoritism during arbitration, whereas non-affiliated third-parties (Study 1 & 2) and <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> affiliated to both disputants (Study 2) imposed balanced settlements. In addition to this, both studies identify third parties’ decision control, inherent to the two phases of mediation-arbitration as a relevant moderating variable for the emergence of this effect...|$|R
5|$|In November 1995 the Princess Royal Class Locomotive Trust {{purchased}} the locomotive for £200,000 (through a <b>third</b> <b>party)</b> {{and the following}} February it {{was transferred to the}} Trust's premises at the Midland Railway in Butterley,Derbyshire. In 1998, funded by public donation and the Heritage Lottery Fund, the <b>third</b> <b>party</b> purchaser was paid off and the money was now available to restore the locomotive. The work was carried out at the railway workshops at Swanwick Junction and in July 2001 the restored locomotive was allowed a trial run on the national rail network, where it promptly broke down and had to be towed home. With the fault fixed, No. 46233 now started to generate income by hauling enthusiasts' trains, as well as the Royal Train on two occasions. Following another overhaul commencing in 2010, the locomotive resumed its steaming duties in 2012. As at October 2016, it is still owned by the Princess Royal Class Locomotive Trust and still pulling enthusiasts' specials.|$|E
