5|$|As the autobodies {{are found}} mainly in {{patients}} that have characteristics of several different autoimmune diseases, the clinical symptoms of <b>these</b> <b>patients</b> can vary widely. The symptoms that are seen most often are the typical {{symptoms of the}} individual autoimmune diseases and include Raynaud's phenomenon, arthritis, myositis and scleroderma. Treatment of <b>these</b> <b>patients</b> is symptomatic and is similar to treatment for the individual autoimmune disease, often involving either immunosuppressive or immunomodulating drugs.|$|E

5|$|Roughly 20% of {{patients}} with SCSFLS exhibit features of Marfan syndrome, including tall stature, hollowed chest (pectus excavatum), joint hypermobility and arched palate. However <b>these</b> <b>patients</b> do not exhibit any other Marfan syndrome presentations.|$|E
40|$|This grant {{proposal}} identifies new paradigms regarding {{quality of}} life, patient satisfaction and a 'good death' {{relating to the}} use of an End-of-Life Suite during the last few days of a terminally ill inpatient's life. By providing <b>these</b> <b>patient's</b> with a choice of where to die, <b>these</b> <b>patient's</b> will experience a 'good death', thus improving quality of life and patient satisfaction.

30|$|These {{previous}} studies introduced the ASP as a promising novel parameter for the non-invasive characterization of tumors. Additionally, the ASP could represent a strong predictive parameter regarding the overall survival in <b>these</b> <b>patient</b> collectives [15, 19].|$|R

5|$|Traumatic {{brain injury}} may cause {{a range of}} serious {{coincidental}} complications that include cardiac arrhythmias and neurogenic pulmonary edema. These conditions must be adequately treated and stabilised {{as part of the}} core care for <b>these</b> <b>patients.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{prognosis}} of <b>these</b> <b>patients</b> is grim with untreated patients {{having an}} extremely short survival. The severity of liver disease (as {{evidenced by the}} MELD score) {{has been shown to}} be a determinant of outcome. Some patients without cirrhosis develop HRS, with an incidence of about 20% seen in one study of ill patients with alcoholic hepatitis.|$|E
5|$|Tuberculosis {{is closely}} linked to both {{overcrowding}} and malnutrition, {{making it one of}} the principal diseases of poverty. Those at high risk thus include: people who inject illicit drugs, inhabitants and employees of locales where vulnerable people gather (e.g. prisons and homeless shelters), medically underprivileged and resource-poor communities, high-risk ethnic minorities, children in close contact with high-risk category patients, and health-care providers serving <b>these</b> <b>patients.</b>|$|E
5|$|Motorcycle – In {{developed}} areas, {{these are}} used for rapid response in an emergency as they can travel through heavy traffic much faster than a car or van. Trailers or sidecars can make <b>these</b> <b>patient</b> transporting units. See also motorcycle ambulance.|$|R
50|$|Multicultural Health Clinics: In {{response}} {{to the fact that}} Latinos and Asian Americans develop diabetes at a much higher rate than the general population, Joslin established clinics for both of <b>these</b> <b>patient</b> populations. They offer culturally appropriate care and bilingual staff.|$|R
30|$|The {{fact that}} our patient has had {{multiple}} admissions and treatment for NTM underlines {{the fact that such}} infections tend to be recurrent in <b>these</b> <b>patient</b> populations. Close ophthalmic follow-up is imperative to detect future recurrences of ocular involvement and treatment to prevent any sequelae.|$|R

30|$|NPPV non-indication was proved by esophageal {{pressure}} measurement in two <b>patients.</b> In <b>these</b> two <b>patients,</b> despite the physiological findings, NPPV was continued in one patient after esophageal pressure and gastric {{pressure measurement}}s {{because of an}} important clinical improvement.

40|$|Background: Loss {{of insight}} is a core {{diagnostic}} criterion for frontotemporal dementia (FTD), whereas failure to recognise cognitive deficits and unawareness of disease (anosognosia) are well established findings in Alzheimer's disease (AD).

25|$|Turner {{syndrome}} {{is characterized by}} primary amenorrhoea, premature ovarian failure, streak gonads and infertility. However, technology (especially oocyte donation) provides the opportunity of pregnancy in <b>these</b> <b>patients.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{probability}} of resistance {{is higher in}} those patients who relapse and every effort {{must be made to}} obtain a specimen that can be cultured for sensitivities. That said, most patients who relapse do so with a fully sensitive strain and it is possible that <b>these</b> <b>patients</b> have not relapsed, but have instead been re-infected; <b>these</b> <b>patients</b> can be re-treated with the same regimen as before (no drugs need {{to be added to the}} regimen and the duration need not be any longer).|$|E
25|$|Patients with {{renal disease}} should receive {{flucytosine}} cautiously and in reduced doses. Guidelines for proper dosing exist. Serum level determinations are mandatory for <b>these</b> <b>patients.</b>|$|E

40|$|We present 9 {{patients}} with community acquired Staphylococcus aureus meningitis. Foci of infection outside {{the central nervous}} system were present in 8 (89 %) patients, mostly endocarditis and pneumonia. Cardiorespiratory complications occurred frequently and 6 patients died (67 %).

25|$|People with SARS must be isolated, preferably in {{negative}} pressure rooms, with complete barrier nursing precautions taken for any necessary contact with <b>these</b> <b>patients.</b>|$|E

25|$|A large {{survey in}} {{patients}} with tetraplegia demonstrated that <b>these</b> <b>patients</b> give preference to improving upper extremity function above other lost functions like being able to walk or sexual function.|$|E
50|$|Capnocytophaga canimorsus {{transmission}} {{following a}} dog bite can cause overwhelming sepsis in asplenic patients, the elderly, and the immunocompromised. Empiric treatment for these bacteria following a dog bite, {{consisting of a}} third-generation cephalosporin early in the infection, should be instituted in <b>these</b> <b>patient</b> populations, or following deep bites or dog bites to the hand.|$|R

50|$|Additionally, plans may be {{structured}} {{to respond to}} the ‘catastrophic’ impact of drug expenses incurred by those with serious diseases or high drug spending relative to income. <b>These</b> <b>patient</b> populations, often called ‘medically needy,’ may have all or part of their drug costs covered by ‘plans of last resort,’ (typically government-sponsored). One such plan is Ontario’s Trillium Drug Program.|$|R

25|$|Expressive aphasia: Patients {{who suffer}} from this {{condition}} typically have lesions on their left inferior frontal cortex. <b>These</b> <b>patients</b> are described with having severe syntactical deficits, {{which means that they}} have extreme difficulty in forming sentences correctly. Expressive aphasic patients suffer from more regular rule governed principles in forming sentences, which is closely related to Alzheimer patients. For instance instead of saying the red ball bounced, both of <b>these</b> <b>patients</b> would say bounced ball the red. This is just one example of what a person might say; there are of course many possibilities.|$|E
25|$|In many CKD patients, {{previous}} {{kidney disease}} or other underlying diseases are already known. A significant number present with CKD of unknown cause. In <b>these</b> <b>patients,</b> a cause is occasionally identified retrospectively.|$|E

25|$|The {{hospital}} {{was not just}} a place to treat patients: it also served as a medical school to educate and train students. Basic science preparation was learned through private tutors, self-study and lectures. Islamic hospitals were the first to keep written records of patients and their medical treatment. Students were responsible in keeping <b>these</b> <b>patient</b> records, which were later edited by doctors and referenced in future treatments.|$|R
