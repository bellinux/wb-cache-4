50|$|A small {{transmission}} line carries a <b>twin</b> <b>conductor</b> electrode circuit from the Benmore converter station site to the South Island land electrode at Bog Roy, which {{in conjunction with}} the shore electrode in the North Island, allows one pole to operate using earth return when the other pole is out of service.|$|E
5000|$|In Australia and New Zealand Single {{conductor}} and <b>Twin</b> <b>conductor</b> TPS cables also exist.These {{are required}} {{because it is}} not permitted in Australia and New Zealand for the Neutral conductor in a [...] "Twin and Earth" [...] cable to be [...] "re-purposed" [...] as a [...] "Switched Line" [...] conductor, as is done the UK and in North America.|$|E
5000|$|In 1960, {{the company}} {{branched}} out into electric car racing toys similar to Scalextric but whereas Scalextric adopted the popular 1/32 scale, Wrenn produced their [...] "Formula 152 model racing system" [...] to 1/52, {{and with a}} <b>twin</b> <b>conductor</b> rail {{on each side of}} the 'slot' the system was capable of running three cars at a time on each lane. The smaller scale meant that quite comprehensive circuits could be fitted on to an 8' x 4' baseboard, but generally, electrical conductivity was quite fragile, so many users adopted a practice of a second conductor track piece on the far side of the circuit.|$|E
5000|$|In Australia and New Zealand, {{the colour}} of the {{external}} sheath is usually white but several other colours are available. Wire sizes of from 1 mm² to 6 mm² Cross Sectional Area (CSA) are available with the outer sheath covering a [...] "core" [...] of either a single <b>conductor,</b> <b>twin</b> <b>conductors,</b> <b>twin</b> and earth <b>conductors,</b> or three and earth conductors. Although available in the larger sizes, solid conductors are rarely used with wire sizes greater than 1 mm² CSA, since the small extra expense of multi-stranded conductors is far outweighed by the relative ease of working with them, especially at the points of termination.|$|R
50|$|The scheme {{consists}} of three overhead line sections: one on the Italian mainland with a length of 22 km, one on Corsica with a length of 156 km and one on Sardinia with a length of 86 km. The overhead line sections use <b>twin</b> <b>conductors</b> (each rated at 1000 Adc) connected in parallel. Each conductor has an aluminium conductor cross section of 628 mm2 in Sardinia and Italy, and 755 mm2 on Corsica.|$|R

40|$|Under {{the certain}} rain-wind conditions, bundled {{conductors}} exhibit a rain-wind induced large-amplitude vibration. This type of vibration {{can cause the}} fatigue fractures of conductors and fatigue failures of spacers, which threaten the safety operation and serviceability of high-voltage transmission line. To reveal the mechanism of rain-wind induced vibration of bundled conductors, a series of 2 -dimensional CFD models about the <b>twin</b> bundled <b>conductors</b> with rivulets are developed to obtain the curves of aerodynamic coefficients with the upper rivulet angle. The influences of the forward conductor’s aerodynamic shielding and the upper rivulet’s aerodynamic characteristics on the leeward conductor are discussed. Furthermore, a 2 -dimensional 3 DOF model for the rain-wind induced vibration of the leeward conductor is established. The model is solved by finite element method and Newmark method, {{and the effects of}} the wind velocity and the upper rivulet’s motion on vibration amplitude of the leeward conductor are analyzed. By contrast with the wake-induced vibration, it can easily find that the characteristics of rain-wind vibration are obviously {{different from those of the}} wake-induced vibration, and the main reason of the rain-induced vibration may be due to the upper rivulet’s motion...|$|R
50|$|The {{transmission}} line to evacuate power from Uch II {{will be developed}} by a separate entity called National Transmission and Dispatch Company (“NTDC”), a sub-division of WAPDA which is government owned. Based on the available information, NTDC is considering to develop (i) a 220 kV {{transmission line}} of about 125 km from Uch II to Sibi, (ii) a 220 kV transmission line of about 0.5 km for looping {{in and out of}} the existing Uch I Power Plant - Shikarpur New 220 kV S/C transmission line at Uch II Power Plant, and (iii) reconductoring of 220 kV line section, about 1 km long between Uch I Power Plant and Uch II power Plant from single rail to <b>twin</b> bundled rail <b>conductor.</b>|$|R
40|$|Results are {{presented}} {{of a study}} of a proposed 1, 600 km inter-connector through central Australia to reinforce the existing 5, 000 km long HVAC grid of Australia 2 ̆ 7 s National Electricity Market (NEM). Alternative technologies are compared and HVDC-VSC (Voltage Sourced Converters) selected for this application. Preliminary optimization selected a capacity of 700 MW, operating voltage up to 350 kV, <b>twin</b> Sulphur AAAC <b>conductors</b> and full-load current of 1, 000 A per bi-pole. Preliminary estimates of interconnector costs and benefits justify adopting a Strategic route for the interconnector via undeveloped renewable energy resources in central Australia. Further studies are proposed including investigating innovations to reduce project costs. Non-traditional benefits are identified such as enabling the development of low-cost, remote renewable energy resources; improved capacity, robustness and efficiency of the existing NEM grid; lower and less volatile electricity market prices. The study demonstrates the value of collaboration between researchers, industry and global HVDC experts to investigate the lowest cost interconnector solutions...|$|R
