40|$|In recent years, various {{broadcasting}} services and services using videocontents on the Internet have been provided. For this reason, a large amountof TV type video content, which has constant quality, {{and a new}} service usingvideo content have been required. However, {{it is difficult for}} traditional TVprogram production method to supply a large amount of <b>TV</b> <b>programs</b> whichhave constant quality and develop a new service. Because TV programproduction requires many special equipments and experts who have specialskills and knowledge for <b>TV</b> <b>program</b> production, though their resources arelimited. This situation is similar to CG based <b>TV</b> <b>program</b> production,though it enables to create <b>TV</b> <b>programs</b> with less equipments thanlive-action based <b>TV</b> <b>programs.</b> I realize new supporting methods for CG based <b>TV</b> <b>program</b> production,which enable non-experts of <b>TV</b> <b>program</b> production to create constantquality <b>TV</b> <b>programs</b> easily, and invest a new service using video content. Both of them use TVML(TV program Making Language) as base technologyfor CG based <b>TV</b> <b>program</b> generation. Because TVML has realized moreefficient CG based <b>TV</b> <b>program</b> production than conventional one. In this study, I have invented and realized the following TV programproduction supporting methods. (1) An automatic <b>TV</b> <b>program</b> productionmethod modeled actual <b>TV</b> <b>program</b> production framework. (2) AutomaticTV program production methods using presentation units calling “ProgramBlocks” and “APE(Automatic Production Engine) ” which are based on TVprogram structure. (3) An automatic high-quality presentation style addingmethod, which based on post-recording process, to <b>TV</b> <b>programs.</b> And also Iexamine the effectiveness of these methods by program productionexperiments. For developing a new service using video contents, I have invested aninteractive type <b>TV</b> <b>program</b> production method calling “SeamlessInteraction” based on conversation between a TV viewer and a programperformer. On Seamless Interaction, the <b>TV</b> <b>program</b> creator can describe TVprogram scripts and conversation content easily by using advanced APE forthe Seamless Interaction. And also Seamless Interaction gives new programviewing style to viewers. I confirm the effectiveness by a subjectiveevaluation experiment. 電気通信大学 200...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel method of measuring {{the similarity between}} <b>TV</b> <b>programs</b> by using summaries of the Electronic Program Guide (EPG). Most previous methods use statistics such as the TFIDF based cosine measure of word vectors, whose elements are words appearing in the summaries. However, these approaches are not effective because <b>TV</b> <b>program</b> summaries, especially short ones, do not necessarily share many words even when they have similar meanings. The proposed method generates a graph structure whose nodes are <b>TV</b> <b>programs</b> and nouns. These nouns are connected by semantic relations that are extracted from the Web automatically. The similarity between two <b>TV</b> <b>programs</b> is {{measured in terms of}} the relativeness of two <b>TV</b> <b>program’s</b> nodes in the graph structure by using a random walk algorithm. Experiments showed that our method is better at measuring similarities between two <b>TV</b> <b>programs</b> compared with baseline methods...|$|R

40|$|Few {{studies have}} {{examined}} direct effects of food cues presented within television (<b>TV)</b> <b>programs</b> on eating behavior in adults. This research experimentally determined whether exposure to food cues in <b>TV</b> <b>programs</b> affects energy intake during TV viewing among young women, independently from food cues presented in TV advertisements. The experiment involved a 2 (<b>TV</b> <b>program</b> with or without food cues) by 2 (TV advertisements with or without food cues) between-participants design. While watching TV, participants could freely eat peanut chocolate candies and crisps (potato chips). Participants were 121 young women (mean age =  19. 6 years; mean BMI =  22. 5). Participants who watched a <b>TV</b> <b>program</b> with food cues tended to have a lower total energy intake and ate significantly less peanut chocolate candies than participants who watched the same <b>TV</b> <b>program</b> without food cues. This effect was particularly pronounced among participants with a higher BMI. Food advertisements did not affect energy intake. Findings may indicate that subtle continuous food cues during <b>TV</b> <b>programs</b> could make young females more aware of their own eating and/or weight, leading to reduced intake of particularly sweet snack foods during TV viewing. Considering the non-significant trend for {{the effect of the}} <b>TV</b> <b>program</b> with food cues on total energy intake, findings should be replicated to provide possible tools for prevention campaigns using food cue reminders to watch one's intake...|$|R
