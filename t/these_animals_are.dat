5|$|Although Nepenthes rajah is {{most famous}} for {{trapping}} and digesting animals, its pitchers are also host {{to a large}} number of other organisms, which are thought to form a mutually beneficial (symbiotic) association with the plant. Many of <b>these</b> <b>animals</b> <b>are</b> so specialised that they cannot survive anywhere else, and are referred to as nepenthebionts. N. rajah has two such mosquito taxa named after it: Culex rajah and Toxorhynchites rajah.|$|E
5|$|Elephants {{have been}} working animals {{since at least the}} Indus Valley Civilization and {{continue}} to be used in modern times. There were 13,000–16,500 working elephants employed in Asia in 2000. <b>These</b> <b>animals</b> <b>are</b> typically captured from the wild when they are 10–20 years old when they can be trained quickly and easily, and will have a longer working life. They were traditionally captured with traps and lassos, but since 1950, tranquillisers have been used.|$|E
5|$|The kingdom Animalia or metazoa, {{contains}} multicellular {{organisms that}} are heterotrophic and motile (although some have secondarily adopted a sessile lifestyle). Most animals have bodies differentiated into separate tissues and <b>these</b> <b>animals</b> <b>are</b> {{also known as}} eumetazoans. They have an internal digestive chamber, {{with one or two}} openings; the gametes are produced in multicellular sex organs, and the zygotes include a blastula stage in their embryonic development. Metazoans do not include the sponges, which have undifferentiated cells.|$|E

50|$|The five {{domestic}} animals {{most important in}} the Mongol Empire were horses (most important), cattle, camels, sheep, and goats. All of <b>these</b> <b>animals</b> <b>were</b> valued for their milk {{and all of the}} animals’ hides were used for clothing and shelter. Though often considered unattractive by other cultures, Mongolian domestic <b>animals</b> <b>were</b> well adapted to cold weather as well as shortages of food and water. <b>These</b> <b>animals</b> <b>were</b> and still are known to survive under <b>these</b> conditions while <b>animals</b> from other regions perish.|$|R
5|$|In humans, body {{temperature}} is typically highest during {{the mid to}} late afternoon. However, human athletes being tested for physical vigor on exercise machines showed no statistically significant difference after lunch. Owners of factory farms are advised to use buildings with an east–west (as opposed to north–south) orientation to house their livestock, because an east–west orientation generally means thicker walls on the east and west to accommodate the sun's acute angle and intense glare during late afternoon. When <b>these</b> <b>animals</b> <b>are</b> too hot, {{they are more likely to}} become belligerent and unproductive.|$|E
5|$|Many fungi {{can serve}} as source of food for insect larvae, whereas most insects eat fungi only occasionally. Still, {{a whole range of}} insect species {{specialize}} on fungi. <b>These</b> <b>animals</b> <b>are</b> mainly beetle larvae, especially hairy fungus beetles (Mycetophagidae), rove beetles (Staphylinidae), and true flies (Diptera). Milk caps are especially attractive for true flies, while beetle larvae are comparatively rarer. The most common insects found on the fungus are Mycetophilidae and Phoridae larvae, which populate even the youngest fruit bodies. Also relatively common on mature or overaged fruit bodies are Drosophilidae and Psychodidae. Species from the section Deliciosi are often infested by Diptera larvae.|$|E
5|$|Of {{most vital}} {{importance}} to marshes are invertebrate animals, {{the foundation of}} food webs. Amphibious invertebrates such as apple snails (Pomacea paludosa), crayfish, and grass shrimp consume plant material, hastening its decomposition and acting as a food source for fish and birds. Insect larvae use water for breeding, feeding upon smaller copepods and amphipods that live in microscopic algae and periphyton formations. Mosquitos, born in water, are in turn the favorite food of 112 species of dragonflies and 44 species of damselflies in Florida. <b>These</b> <b>animals</b> <b>are</b> water hardy and adaptable to dry conditions when water levels fluctuate from one season to the next or through drought and flood cycles.|$|E
50|$|While {{the origin}} of <b>these</b> <b>animals</b> <b>is</b> unknown, cougar experts believe some <b>are</b> captive <b>animals</b> that have <b>been</b> {{released}} or escaped.|$|R
50|$|The ancient Cantabrians {{believed}} <b>these</b> <b>animals</b> <b>were</b> sacred. Some link {{this ritual}} {{closely with the}} Celtic variant of the god Mars and that <b>these</b> <b>animals</b> represented his reincarnation.|$|R
50|$|<b>These</b> <b>animals</b> should <b>be</b> {{housed in}} pairs and need a dry terrarium. <b>These</b> <b>animals</b> can <b>be</b> fed with crickets, wax moth, fruits flies, mealworms, houseflies and fruit baby food.|$|R
5|$|The addax mainly eats {{grasses and}} leaves of any {{available}} shrubs, leguminous herbs and bushes. <b>These</b> <b>animals</b> <b>are</b> well-adapted {{to exist in}} their desert habitat, as they can live without water {{for long periods of}} time. Addax form herds of five to 20 members, consisting of both males and females. They are led by the oldest female. Due to its slow movements, the antelope is an easy target for its predators: lions, humans, African wild dogs, cheetahs, and leopards. Breeding season is at its peak during winter and early spring. The natural habitat of the addax are arid regions, semideserts and sandy and stony deserts.|$|E
5|$|The chewing of cud by {{animals such as}} cows, goats, and giraffes is {{considered}} normal behavior. <b>These</b> <b>animals</b> <b>are</b> known as ruminants. Such behavior, though termed rumination, {{is not related to}} human rumination syndrome, but is ordinary. Involuntary rumination, similar to what is seen in humans, has been described in gorillas and other primates. True merycism, as opposed to the cud-chewing process in ruminants, is also a normal part of the digestive process in some other animals, such as kangaroos.|$|E
5|$|The inflorescences {{are highly}} {{attractive}} to insects. The rare bee species Hylaeus globuliferus is a recorded visitor. Large numbers of ladybirds {{have been reported}} drinking the nectar of this species, while ignoring nearby Banksia attenuata inflorescences. The white-tailed dunnart (Sminthopsis granulipes) has been observed visiting flower spikes. Pollen has been found on the snouts and in the scat of several species of dasyurid marsupials, which suggests <b>these</b> <b>animals</b> <b>are</b> likely pollinators of Banksia species in general. No pollinators of this species were recorded in The Banksia Atlas survey.|$|E
50|$|Recent {{studies in}} the bone {{histology}} of many specimens of Trirachodon have led to an increased understanding of the ontogeny and lifestyle of <b>these</b> <b>animals.</b> There <b>is</b> evidence in the growth rings of bones that growth rates in <b>these</b> <b>animals</b> <b>was</b> strongly influenced by the fluctuation in seasonal conditions in their environment.|$|R

5|$|Dinosaurs diverged {{from their}} archosaur {{ancestors}} {{during the middle}} to late Triassic period, roughly 20million years after the Permian–Triassic extinction event wiped out an estimated 95% of all life on Earth. Radiometric dating of the rock formation that contained fossils from the early dinosaur genus Eoraptor at 231.4 million years old establishes its presence in the fossil record at this time. Paleontologists think that Eoraptor resembles the common ancestor of all dinosaurs; if this is true, its traits suggest that the first dinosaurs were small, bipedal predators. The discovery of primitive, dinosaur-like ornithodirans such as Marasuchus and Lagerpeton in Argentinian Middle Triassic strata supports this view; analysis of recovered fossils suggests that these animals were indeed small, bipedal predators. Dinosaurs may have appeared as early as 243 million years ago, as evidenced by remains of the genus Nyasasaurus from that period, though known fossils of <b>these</b> <b>animals</b> <b>are</b> too fragmentary to tell if they are dinosaurs or very close dinosaurian relatives.|$|E
5|$|Of vertebrates, {{numerous}} {{species of}} frog, salamander, snake, turtle, and alligator (Alligator mississippiensis) proliferate in marsh waters. Most of <b>these</b> <b>animals</b> <b>are</b> active at night. Frog choruses are overwhelming; during alligator mating season the grunts of bulls join in. The marshes around the St. Johns River upper basin teem with birds. A recent study counted 60,000 birds in one month, nesting or feeding {{in the upper}} basin. Wading and water birds like the white ibis (Eudocimus albus), wood stork (Mycteria americana), and purple gallinule (Porphyrio martinicus) depend on the water for raising their young: they prey upon small fish and tadpoles in shallow water and puddles in the dry season. In successful seasons, their colonies can number in the thousands, creating a cacophony of calls and fertilizing trees with their droppings.|$|E
5|$|Other {{members of}} the clade may include Eoraptor from the same Ischigualasto Formation of Argentina as Herrerasaurus, Chindesaurus from the Upper Petrified Forest (Chinle Formation) of Arizona, and {{possibly}} Caseosaurus from the Tecovas Formation of the Dockum Group in Texas, although the relationships of <b>these</b> <b>animals</b> <b>are</b> not fully understood, and not all paleontologists agree. Other possible basal theropods, Alwalkeria from the Late Triassic Maleri Formation of India, and Teyuwasu, known from very fragmentary remains from the Late Triassic of Brazil, might be related. Paul (1988) noted {{that it had been}} incorrectly suggested that Staurikosaurus pricei was a juvenile Herrerasaurus. This claim was refuted when pelvic bones from a juvenile Herrerasaurus were discovered, which upon examination did not resemble the pelvic bones of Staurikosaurus.|$|E

5|$|With {{the advent}} of {{cladistic}} analyses, Iguanodontidae as traditionally construed was shown to be paraphyletic, and <b>these</b> <b>animals</b> <b>are</b> recognised to fall {{at different points in}} relation to hadrosaurs on a cladogram, instead of in a single distinct clade. Essentially, the modern concept of Iguanodontidae currently includes only Iguanodon. Groups like Iguanodontoidea are still used as unranked clades in the scientific literature, though many traditional iguanodontids are now included in the superfamily Hadrosauroidea. Iguanodon lies between Camptosaurus and Ouranosaurus in cladograms, and is probably descended from a camptosaur-like animal. At one point, Jack Horner suggested, based mostly on skull features, that hadrosaurids actually formed two more distantly related groups, with Iguanodon on the line to the flat-headed hadrosaurines, and Ouranosaurus on the line to the crested lambeosaurines, but his proposal has been rejected.|$|E
5|$|Several {{groups of}} temnospondyls have large bony plates on their backs. One temnospondyl, Peltobatrachus, has armour-like plating that covers both its back and underside. The temnospondyl Laidleria also has {{extensive}} plating on its back. Most {{members of the}} family Dissorophidae also have armor, although it only covers the midline of the back with two narrow rows of plates. Other temnospondyls, such as Eryops, have been found with small, disc-like bony scutes that were in life probably embedded in the skin. All of these temnospondyls were adapted to a terrestrial lifestyle. Armor may have offered protection from predators in the case of Peltobatrachus. The scutes may have provided stability for the spine, as they would have limited flexibility and may have been connected by strong ligaments. Temnospondyls, such as Sclerothorax and Eryops, that may have been at least partly terrestrial also have long neural spines on top of their vertebrae that would have stabilized the spine. Bony scutes are also seen in plagiosaurs, but unlike Peltobatrachus, Laidleria, Eryops, and dissorophids, <b>these</b> <b>animals</b> <b>are</b> thought to have been fully aquatic. Plagiosaurs may have inherited their armor from a terrestrial ancestor, as both Peltobatrachus and Laidleria have been considered close relatives of the group.|$|E
