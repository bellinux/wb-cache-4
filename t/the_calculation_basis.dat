40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was {{to find out which}} impacts of the {{parametric}} changes, linked to the change of law no. 155 / 1995 Sb. about pension insurance, as amended, affected the number of applications for early retirement in the Jindřichův Hradec district. The need to solve this problem arose from the questioning of Section 15 of act no. 155 / 1995 Sb., as amended, regarding social insurance, which governs the assignment of <b>the</b> <b>calculation</b> <b>basis</b> used to work out the percentual pension allowance. The Constitutional Court concluded that the defined rules generate significant differences between the amount paid into the insurance system and the amount of the old-age benefit received. On this basis the MPSV (Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs) compiled the rule changes for calculation of old-age benefit and together with the other parametric changes prepared, this was proposed as the so-called ?minor pension reform?. The proposal passed through the legislative process and with effect from 30 th September 2011 the rules for the calculation of the old-age benefit changed according to the new Act (no. 220 / 2011 Sb.) that amends Act no. 155 / 1995 Sb. on social insurance, as amended by subsequent rules, and several other Acts. The new regulations favour citizens with higher incomes. For persons with a lower income the change resulted in lower pensions received, as a result of which some have chosen to apply for early retirement. The {{aim of this}} thesis was to survey applications for all types of retirement in the years 2010 and 2011 with emphasis on the number of applications for early retirement in the district of J. Hradec and to analyse the length of prematurity at the time the application for early retirement was submitted. The comparison periods were the months from March to September of the respective years. Based on the given aims, quantitative research was chosen as the method of standardised research and two hypotheses were tested: 1. As a consequence of the changes in the regulations for the benefit calculation the number of early retirement applications has risen. 2. The highest interest in allowance of early retirement was shown by citizens with a maximum of 1 year left before reaching the age limit at which they were entitled to old-age pension benefits. The research was carried out by content and secondary analysis of data contained in the official statistics of ČSSZ (Czech Social Security Administration) and OSSZ (District Social Security Administration) and other available materials for the years 2010 and 2011. After analysis and evaluation of the required information the first defined hypothesis was confirmed; citizens were choosing early retirement regardless {{of the fact that the}} percentual assessment of <b>the</b> <b>calculation</b> <b>basis</b> would be reduced for every 90 days before retirement age, but were able to retain their original pension calculation basis. They were making this decision despite the fact that by reduction of the received old-age benefit their pension was lowered by approximately 12 %. In this case, providing they satisfied the legal condition of insurance duration, they used the opportunity to retire before reaching the age limit for old-age pension, which meant 3 years early. In the final phase it was confirmed that in the tracked period applications from citizens with up to 1 year left to reach the retirement age did not predominate. The number of applicants retiring 3 years earlier was approximately the same as those with one year left. There were slightly fewer citizens with two years left to satisfy the legal condition of the insurance duration. In the conclusion of the results section, data are also mentioned which evidence the number of state pensions being paid and the expenses used for these benefits from the national budget. This is quite a considerable amount and it continues to rise with the number of pensions being paid...|$|E
40|$|Italian) REIT managers’ {{compensation}} structure typically {{provides a}} payment based alternatively on (i) “gross asset value” [GAV] or (ii) “net asset value” [NAV]. In addition, managers also gain a performance fee when REIT total return exceeds some minimum level. In this respect, the paper analyses {{how the two}} alternative compensation schemes influence REITs’ investment decisions and capital structure and, consequently, REITs’ share performance at the investor level. The final issue addressed is whether one compensation scheme is superior to the other, i. e. if REITs having a fee-structure based on net asset values outperform REITs with a compensation indexed on gross asset value. Due to the severe market price discount on net asset values and the inability to issue new shares, both fee structures incentive managers to leverage – even in a tax-free environment – {{in order to maximize}} <b>the</b> <b>calculation</b> <b>basis</b> of management fees. However, it will be shown that leverage motivation is stronger for GAV-based REITs than for NAV-based REITs, which are also expected to be more selective in investment decisions because only positive net present value investment projects increase their compensation basis. Overall, considering initial fee percentage, GAV-based REITs are expected to pay higher management fees than NAV-based REITs due to the leverage effect. Moreover, debt recourse produces different effects on share value if measured upon market price or net asset value due to the different implicit valuation methodologies. The empirical analysis supports the theoretical expectations. GAV-based REITs have higher debt trends and levels than NAV-based REITs. At the same time, GAV-REITs generally experience lower real estate asset returns net of management fees for both current and growth yields. Differences in net real estate returns seem to lead to permanent higher performance over total return indexes of NAV-based REITs compared to GAV-based REITs. While the focus of the paper is largely on Italian REITs compensation, the issue addressed seems to be of broader interest {{due to the fact that}} similar compensation structures are also typical of other European REITs...|$|E
