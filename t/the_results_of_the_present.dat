"With {{the aid of}} {{the methods}} of Kleene (American Journal of Mathematics, 1935), the {{considerations}} of the present paper could, with comparatively slight modification be carried through entirely in terms of λ-definability, without making use of the notion of recursiveness. On the other hand, since <b>the</b> <b>results</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>present</b> paper were obtained, it has been shown by Kleene (see his forthcoming paper, [...] "General recursive functions of natural numbers") that analogous results can be obtained entirely in terms of recursiveness, without making use of λ-definability. The fact, however, that two such widely different and (in the opinion of the author) equally natural definitions of effective calculability turn out to be equivalent adds to the strength of the reasons adduced below for believing that they constitute as general a characterization of this notion as is consistent with the usual intuitive understanding of it." ...|$|E
5000|$|Earlier (2001) {{research}} {{indicated that}} Altaians have maintained their native identity and only begun, very recently, {{to mix with}} groups (mostly Russians and Kazakhs) who do not show mtDNA haplogroup X. Genetic studies and researchers show, [...] "the analysis of the tribal structure of Southern Altaians {{has shown that the}} present-day Altaians have retained their native language and ethnic identity. They have begun to mix with other ethnic groups (mostly Russians and Kazakhs) only recently, so the interethnic admixture is estimated to be <5% (Luzina 1987; Osipova et al. 1997). The haplogroup X mtDNAs have not been found in populations of central Asia, including Kazakhs, Uighurs, and Kirghizs (Comas et al. 1998). Since the frequency of haplogroup X in Russians is extremely low (3 of 336; Orekhov et al. 1999; Malyarchuk and Derenko 2000; authors’ unpublished data), the recent European admixture cannot explain the presence of haplogroup X in the Altaians. Hence, <b>the</b> <b>results</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>present</b> study allow us to suggest that haplogroup X was the part of the ancestral gene pool for Altaian populations, being found both in northern and southern Altaians." ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{majority}} of complementarian and some egalitarian scholars agreed with Köstenberger, many considering {{that he has}} determined conclusively the contextual meaning of authenteo in 1 Timothy 2:12. Peter O'Brien, in a review published in Australia, concurred {{with the findings of}} this study, as did Helge Stadelmann in an extensive review that appeared in the German [...] "Jahrbuch für evangelikale Theologie". Both reviewers accepted <b>the</b> <b>results</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>present</b> study as valid. Köstenberger notes a range of egalitarians agreeing with his syntactical analysis. Kevin Giles [...] "finds himself in essential agreement with the present syntactical analysis of 1 Tim 2:12", Craig Blomberg is quoted as saying [...] "Decisively supporting the more positive sense of assuming appropriate authority is Andreas Köstenberger's study". Esther Ng [...] "continues, [...] "However, since a negative connotation of didaskein is unlikely in this verse, the neutral meaning for authentein (to have authority over) seems to fit the oude construction better". Egalitarian Craig Keener, in a review appearing in the Journal of the Evangelical Theological Society, states that while in his view the principle is not clear in all instances cited in Köstenberger's study, [...] "the pattern seems to hold in general, and this is what matters most". Keener concurs that the contention of the present essay is [...] "probably correct that [...] "have authority" [...] should be read as coordinate with [...] "teach" [...] rather than as subordinate ("teach in a domineering way)".|$|E
