40|$|This annexe {{provides}} {{supplementary information}} on the methodology used in Chapter 1, ‘Emerging from Obscurity’, to calculate the average value estimate of USD 4. 3 billion for annual authorized international <b>transfers</b> <b>of</b> <b>ammunition</b> for small arms and light weapons between 2006 and 2009. The estimate, and {{the process by which}} it was derived, is part of a multi-year effort to reassess the Small Arms Survey’s current estimate of USD 4 billion for the annual authorized international trade in small arms and light weapons, and their parts, accessories, and ammunition. Estimating annual light weapons ammunition transfers Basic methodology Because of the almost complete absence of data on transfers of light weapons ammunition in the public domain, 1 the study makes use of the slightly more plentiful data on public procurement 2 of ammunition. Publicly available records were used to build a fairly complete picture of government procurement of light weapons ammunition for a sample of countries. By analysing the identity and location of the contractor supplying the ammunition, the authors categorized purchases as either imports or domestic procurement for each of these countries. They then identified a number of factors (‘independent variables’) believed to predict levels of light weapons ammunition procurement by states. These variables were used in conjunction with the data on imports by the sample countries to generate an estimated level of light weapons ammunition procurement for every country outside the sample. The USD 2. 5 billion estimate of average annual authorized transfers of light weapons ammunition is the sum of the data on imports for the sample countries and the import estimates for every other country in the world. Sample The authors were able to compile what they believe to be fairly complete data on government procurement (including imports) of light weapons ammunition for te...|$|E

They also provided ordnance supplies for the defensive fortifications of the Dockyard itself, and secure storage space for ships in port (Royal Naval ships returning from duties at sea were obliged to unload their stores of powder and ammunition; if a ship was to spend time 'in ordinary' (i.e. out of commission) it had its guns removed as well).|$|R
50|$|With the {{outbreak}} of the Korean War, Chara was transferred to Service Force, Pacific Fleet, for duty as an ammunition ship, transporting and <b>transferring</b> all types <b>of</b> <b>ammunition</b> at sea to fleet units. She cleared San Francisco on 16 September 1950 to replenish TF 77 and support the evacuations of Hungnam and Wonsan before returning to San Francisco for overhaul on 26 March 1951. In her second Korean tour, 19 July 1951 to 18 May 1952, she joined the Mobile Logistics Support Force in operations in the Wonsan-Songjin bomb-line triangle, and in emergency lifts of Korean POWs from Koje-do to Ulsan. Another tour of providing at-sea replenishment <b>of</b> <b>ammunition</b> preceded the end of hostilities.|$|R
50|$|Upon {{returning}} to the western Caroline Islands on 23 February 1945, the Lassen, along with her sister ammunition ships, worked out techniques for <b>transferring</b> large quantities <b>of</b> <b>ammunition</b> to warships while underway at sea. The Lassen exhibited this new ability and mobility by accompanying aircraft carrier Task Group 50.8 in raids from 13 March to 14 June 1945, while supporting the conquest of Okinawa campaign. The Lassen's third battle star was earned while accompanying carrier Task Group 30.8 from 8 July to 6 August off the coasts of Japan itself.|$|R

5000|$|Soon {{after his}} {{move to the}} UK in 1984, Jamshid Hashemi {{developed}} {{a relationship with the}} UK's Secret Intelligence Service (MI6) which would last nine years. Hashemi broke off the relationship in 1993 after the UK Government refused to issue him a British passport. At one time Hashemi gave the UK Conservative Party [...] "£55,000 after meeting Margaret Thatcher at the home of the then foreign secretary, Geoffrey Howe." [...] Hashemi deals that MI6 approved of included the supply of £350 million worth of Silkworm missiles from China to Iran in 1987 (the agency had supported this by sending an agent to China in 1985 to help arrange the deal) and the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> Portuguese 155mm <b>ammunition.</b>|$|R

After leaving Bremerton, the ship headed south to Concord to onload ammunition. On 5 March, she sailed for San Diego for refresher training. Shortly after arrival, a 26-inch crack {{in one of}} her hull plates was discovered. She promptly began <b>transferring</b> her load <b>of</b> <b>ammunition</b> to other ships. By 26 March, the ammunition had been successfully offloaded; and, on 28 April 1966, Vesuvius proceeded to the Bethlehem Steel Shipyard in San Francisco. On 14 May, Vesuvius deployed for the western Pacific. From 13 June through 27 November 1966, Vesuvius conducted replenishment operations between the Philippines and the South China Sea. In December, she stopped at Pearl Harbor on her way home, where an unusual cargo was embarked — $9,700,000 was brought on board for a special currency lift back to the United States. Shortly before Christmas, Vesuvius reached Concord.|$|R
25|$|Proposition H {{sought to}} {{restrict}} handgun possession among San Francisco residents within city limits to police and certain security professionals, and {{to ban the}} manufacture, distribution, sale and <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> firearms and <b>ammunition</b> within the city. Limited exceptions to the proposition would have allowed residents to possess handguns only if required for specific professional purposes. For example, San Francisco residents who are security guards, peace officers, or active members of the U.S. armed forces would be permitted to possess handguns while on duty. The San Francisco Board of Supervisors enacted penalties for violation of this ordinance, including mandatory jail time. Until April 1, 2006, residents {{would have been able}} to surrender their handguns to any district station of the San Francisco Police Department or the San Francisco Sheriff's Department without penalty (no refund of buying cost was planned).|$|R
50|$|Yankee {{arrived in}} Key West on 27 June and began taking on coal. She {{completed}} her refueling operation and departed Key West on 3 July, bound for New York, where she arrived two days later. She remained at New York until the 12 July, taking on ammunition for transportation to the Eastern Squadron on the Cuban blockade. On 13 July, she reached Norfolk, where she spent another four days taking on additional ammunition for the ships of the blockading squadron. Yankee left Hampton Roads on 17 July and arrived in Guantanamo Bay four days later. There, she began the tedious but dangerous job <b>of</b> <b>transferring</b> her cargo <b>of</b> <b>ammunition</b> {{to the various}} warships in the anchorage. The ship remained at Guantanamo Bay until 11 August, when she resumed blockade duty, patrolling initially {{in search of the}} armed merchant ship Montserrat. Three days later, while she cruised the northern coast of Cuba, Yankee received word of the cessation of hostilities in response to Spain's suit for peace. She reentered Guantanamo Bay on the afternoon of 15 August and remained there until the 24 August when she headed home.|$|R

He became the chief of staff of the Yanya Corps and on November 10 he {{was appointed to the}} deputy commander of the 23rd Division (Yirmi Üçüncü Fırka), replacing Mirliva Cevat Pasha. On December 12, when the Greek offensive commanded by Konstantinos Sapountzakis was launched, he planned to retreat in an orderly fashion, but panic amongst the ranks led to the defeat of his division. In the defense line of Bizani he was severely wounded in the thigh, but continued to direct artillery fire whilst on a stretcher. On March 6, 1913, he and his forces surrendered following the instruction of Esad Pasha (Battle of Bizani). He was then transferred to a hospital in Kifissia, a suburb of Athens, to receive medical treatment.|$|R

40|$|Diversion is the {{unauthorized}} <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> {{arms and}} <b>ammunition</b> from {{the stocks of}} legal users to the illicit market. Throughout the world, it sustains the activities of non-state armed groups, terrorist organizations, and armed crim-inality. It {{is one of the}} principal sources of illicit weaponry and represents a grave threat to the safety of civilian populations, {{as well as to the}} security of the state itself. Diversion takes many forms, ranging from large international transfers organized by corrupt military officials to low-level, localized theft and resale of munitions by military and police forces. Diversion affects all countries, and it occurs at all points in the national stockpile chain. This chapter systematizes types of diversion from national stockpiles. In each case, it highlights relevant stockpile management and physical se-curity measures that can be taken to curtail diversion. It concludes that di-version is largely a self-inflicted problem that stems from poor stockpile management by national authorities. However, many of the factors that fa-cilitate diversion can often be made less problematic by relatively simple, low-cost measures. Diversion in context Diversion poses a risk to any legally held quantity <b>of</b> arms and <b>ammunition.</b> It is a threat to operational ammunition stocks (used to support routine opera-tions), reserve ammunition, training ammunition, experimental ammuni-tion, 2 ammunition at the point <b>of</b> manufacture, and <b>ammunition</b> awaiting 146 Conventional Ammunition in Surplus disposal (Wilkinson, 2006, p. 232). Certain types <b>of</b> <b>ammunition,</b> however, pose a greater and more widespread risk than others. This is particularly so of small, portable munitions, such as small arms, light weapons, and their ammunition. These weapons are not only distributed throughout the na-tional stockpile, but are often deployed outside of secured facilities and un-der little centralized control. That said, it would be wrong to focus only on the smallest of conventional munitions. As the following sections outline, when conditions are permissive, almost any munitions can be (and are) sub-ject to diversion...|$|R
