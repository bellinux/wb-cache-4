50|$|Erwin Chargaff {{proposed}} {{two main}} rules {{in his lifetime}} which were appropriately named Chargaff's rules. The first and best known achievement was to show that in natural DNA the number of guanine units equals the number of cytosine units {{and the number of}} adenine units equals the number of thymine units. In human DNA, for example, the four bases are present in these percentages: A=30.9% and T=29.4%; G=19.9% and C=19.8%. This strongly hinted towards the base pair makeup of the DNA, although Chargaff did not explicitly state this connection himself. For this research, Chargaff is credited with disproving the <b>tetranucleotide</b> hypothesis (Phoebus Levene's widely accepted hypothesis that DNA was composed {{of a large number of}} repeats of GACT). Most researchers had previously assumed that deviations from equimolar base ratios (G = A = C = T) were due to experimental error, but Chargaff documented that the variation was real, with + G typically being slightly less abundant. He was able to do this with the newly developed paper chromatography and ultraviolet spectrophotometer. Chargaff met Francis Crick and James D.

Ancillary markers may help to resolve such cases and clarify the reported malignant potential of some IPs. METHODS: Eighty-nine urothelial lesions initially diagnosed as IP were reviewed by 4 experienced urologic pathologists and studied immunohistochemically (Ki 67, p 53, CK 20, MSH 2, MLH 1, and MSH 6). Mutations of the FGFR 3 gene, deletions (loss of heterozygosity) of 9 p, 9 q, and 17 p, microsatellite instability, and elevated microsatellite instability at selected <b>tetranucleotides</b> were also analyzed. RESULTS: Considerable interobserver variability in histopathologic diagnoses was noticed. Only 62 (69. 7 %) initial diagnoses were confirmed by the review pathologists whereas 23 tumors (25. 8 %) were redefined as invNIUC. Molecular analyses revealed infrequent alterations in IPs, including microsatellite instability (1. 8 %), elevated microsatellite instability at selected <b>tetranucleotides</b> (13. 2 %), FGFR 3 mutations (9. 8 %), 9 p deletions (3. 9 %), 9 q deletions (13. 2 %), 17 p deletions (5. 1 %), nuclear p 53 accumulation (18. 9 %), and aberrant immunostaining for MSH 2 (5. 8 %), MLH 1 (11. 8 %), and MSH 6 (3. 8 %). IP and invNIUC differed in FGFR 3 mutations and Ki- 67 labeling index (P< 0. 001 each), and 9 q loss of heterozygosity (P= 0. 03). There were fewer recurrences in IP (5. 4 %) compared with invNIUC (40. 9 %; P< 0. 0001). CONCLUSIONS: IP is a benign lesion that lacks specific genetic alterations found in exophytic noninvasive papillary urothelial tumors. These lesions could be reactive in nature, perhaps secondary to chronic inflammation or a neoplastic process that lack specific genetic alterations.
