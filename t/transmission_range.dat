5|$|Lithium fluoride, artificially {{grown as}} crystal, {{is clear and}} {{transparent}} and often used in specialist optics for IR, UV and VUV (vacuum UV) applications. It {{has one of the}} lowest refractive indexes and the furthest <b>transmission</b> <b>range</b> in the deep UV of most common materials. Finely divided lithium fluoride powder has been used for thermoluminescent radiation dosimetry (TLD): when a sample of such is exposed to radiation, it accumulates crystal defects which, when heated, resolve via a release of bluish light whose intensity is proportional to the absorbed dose, thus allowing this to be quantified. Lithium fluoride is sometimes used in focal lenses of telescopes.|$|E

Modern handheld cellphones which must have the transmission antenna held inches from the user's skull are limited to a maximum transmission power of 0.6 watts ERP. Regardless of the potential biological effects, the reduced <b>transmission</b> <b>range</b> of modern handheld phones limits their usefulness in rural locations as compared to car/bag phones, and handhelds require that cell towers are spaced much closer together to compensate for their lack of transmission power.|$|E

40|$|In a {{wireless}} sensor network (WSN), the unbalanced distribution of communication loads often causes the problem of energy hole, which means {{the energy of the}} nodes in the hole region will be exhausted sooner than the nodes in other regions. This is a key factor which affects the lifetime of the networks. In this paper we propose an improved corona model with levels for analyzing sensors with adjustable <b>transmission</b> <b>ranges</b> in a WSN with circular multi-hop deployment (modeled as concentric coronas). Based on the model we consider that the right <b>transmission</b> <b>ranges</b> of sensors in each corona is the decision factor for optimizing the network lifetime after nodes deployment. We prove that searching optimal <b>transmission</b> <b>ranges</b> of sensors among all coronas is a multi-objective optimization problem (MOP), which is NP hard. Therefore, we propose a centralized algorithm and a distributed algorithm for assigning the <b>transmission</b> <b>ranges</b> of sensors in each corona for different node distributions. The two algorithms can not only reduce the searching complexity but also obtain results approximated to the optimal solution. Furthermore, the simulation results of our solutions indicate that the network lifetime approximates to that ensured by the optimal under both uniform and non-uniform node distribution.

While investigating transmitter [...] "harmonics" [...] – unwanted additional radio signals produced at higher frequencies than a station's normal transmission frequency – Westinghouse's Frank Conrad unexpectedly found {{that in some cases}} the harmonics could be heard farther than the primary signal, something previously thought impossible, as high-frequency shortwave signals, which had poor groundwave coverage, were thought to have a very limited <b>transmission</b> <b>range.</b> In 1924, Conrad demonstrated to Sarnoff that a low-powered shortwave station in East Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania could be readily received in London by a simple receiver using a curtain rod as an antenna, matching, at {{a small fraction of the}} cost, the performance of the massive alternator transmitters. In 1926 Dr. Harold H.
