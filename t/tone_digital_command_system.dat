50|$|<b>Digital</b> <b>Command</b> <b>System</b> (DCS) is an {{electronic}} system developed by MTH Electric Trains and released in April 2002. DCS controls locomotives equipped with Protosound 2, Protosound 3, or Protosound 3E+ decoders. Protosound 3 locomotives {{are compatible with}} both DCS and DCC <b>command</b> <b>systems.</b> Protosound 3E+ locomotives are compatible with DCS and Märklin <b>Digital</b> <b>command</b> <b>systems.</b> All DCS compatible decoders are manufactured by MTH. Factory installed decoders have been offered in H0 scale, two-rail 0 scale, 3-rail 0 gauge, Gauge 1, and three-rail Standard Gauge models. MTH has announced their intention to install DCS compatible decoders in S scale trains beginning in 2013. Separate sale decoder kits have been offered for installation {{in all of the}} above noted scales except H0 and S. DCS is predominantly used in three-rail O gauge. Its chief competitors in three-rail O are Lionel's TMCC and Legacy systems.|$|R

40|$|The various {{segments}} of the Apollo Soyuz Test Project (ASTP) flight program were verified. This included checks on the following: general verification, reference systems and transformations, launch preparations, boost navigation and guidance, orbital navigation and guidance, time bases, discretes, and interrupts, launch vehicle attitude control, switch selector processing, <b>digital</b> <b>command</b> <b>system,</b> real time telemetry and data compression, and algorithms...|$|R
5000|$|Unlike {{most other}} O scale manufacturers, Williams never added {{electronics}} such as Trainmaster <b>Command</b> Control or <b>Digital</b> <b>Command</b> <b>System</b> to its locomotives. This decision gained Williams {{a small but}} devoted following among those hobbyists who want a more [...] "traditional" [...] train layout reminiscent of the 1950s but who want to buy modern equipment. However, this decision has also allowed companies such as MTH and K-Line to eclipse it in size in spite of being an older company.|$|R
50|$|MTH and Lionel {{developed}} a rivalry {{similar to that}} between Lionel and Ives in the 1930s and Lionel and American Flyer in the 1940s and 1950s. Although their train cars are {{the same size and}} can operate as part of the same train, the two companies' locomotives use their own proprietary electronic control systems. MTH uses a <b>system</b> called <b>Digital</b> <b>Command</b> <b>System</b> (DCS), which is capable of operating MTH engines as well as engines using Lionel's Trainmaster Command Control (TMCC), used by many other O gauge manufacturers, and <b>Digital</b> <b>Command</b> Control (DCC), which is an open industry standard used by most two-rail scales.|$|R

The functions of propellant loading, umbilical ejection, holddown arm release, service arm retraction, liftoff, and inflight separation are simulated. An external power source supplies transfer power to internal, and instrument unit commands are simulated by the <b>digital</b> <b>command</b> <b>system.</b> The test outline is presented {{along with a}} list of references, intercommunications information, radio frequency matrix, and interface control chart...|$|R
5000|$|In 1985, RCA {{released}} the <b>Digital</b> <b>Command</b> Component <b>System,</b> an all audio {{system that was}} compatible with all Dimensia audio components, which also used the <b>Digital</b> <b>Command</b> Center remote. The idea of this system {{was to have the}} full functionality of the Dimensia's sound system without the need of a Dimensia monitor.|$|R
50|$|The SPK400 and SPK500, {{released}} in 1987, were second generation three-way speaker systems. Also {{released in}} 1987 {{for the second}} generation Dimensia system and for the <b>Digital</b> <b>Command</b> Component <b>System</b> were the MPA-100 and MPA-120 amplifiers; released to replace the MSA-100 and MSA-200, respectively.|$|R
50|$|The {{zero-crossing}} {{is important}} for systems which send digital data over AC circuits, such as modems, X10 home automation control <b>systems,</b> and <b>Digital</b> <b>Command</b> Control type <b>systems</b> for Lionel and other AC model trains.|$|R
50|$|Although Dolby Surround was {{introduced}} as an analog format, all Dolby Digital decoders incorporate a digitally implemented Dolby Surround Pro Logic decoder for digital stereo signals that carry matrix-encoded Dolby Surround. One {{of the first}} was the MSP400 surround sound receiver and amplifier by RCA for their high-end Dimensia brand. It was released in 1987 for the <b>Digital</b> <b>Command</b> Component <b>System.</b>|$|R
40|$|A {{multi-rate}} <b>digital</b> <b>command</b> <b>system</b> is disclosed {{which uses}} the composite signal of a mu-type ranging {{system as a}} subcarrier to transmit range codes and data from a station to a receiver where the range codes are sequentially phase modulated on a subcarrier of frequency by {{one of its own}} subharmonics and data is phase modulated on a selected ranging component. A range cleanup loop in a spacecraft locks the phase of a locally generated reference component to a received ranging component and retransmits the component to a ground station. When the inverse phase of a ranging component is received and detected, the cleanup loop is modified to demodulate phase modulated command symbols while continuing tracking the same ranging component. The command symbol rate is coherently related to the ranging signal component bit rate...|$|R
40|$|The correct {{processing}} of the <b>Digital</b> <b>Command</b> <b>System</b> (DCS), {{which provides a}} limited real-time means of controlling specific flight program functions, was verified. The ability of the flight program to correctly read and process DCS commands was verified. Tests made by the flight program after reading {{the contents of the}} command decoder register to establish the validity of the received data were verified through the following: DCS mode command verification, DCS data command verification, DCS data validation, and DCS error message. The operation of the following DCS commands accepted and processed by the flight program was tested: time base update, navigation update, generalized switch selector, memory dump, terminate, execute generalized maneuver, return to nominal timeline, ECS water control valve logic inhibit, execute maneuver, execute alternate sequence, targeting load, ladder magnitude limit, S-IVB/IU de-orbit, compressed data dump, and remove inhibit on the extraction maneuver...|$|R
50|$|Colortrak 2000 {{was one of}} RCA's {{brand names}} for their {{high-end}} television models produced from the mid-1980s to the early 1990s, the other being Dimensia. The RCA Colortrak, however, was not a high-end model. As opposed to ColorTrak, ColorTrak 2000 models incorporated a comb filter, which provided a sharper picture. The Colortrak 2000 chassis was identical to the Dimensia tabletop model. Colortrak 2000s with BNC connectors were given the designation of Lyceum TVs. This TV set was also used with RCA's <b>Digital</b> <b>Command</b> Component <b>System</b> released in 1985.|$|R
50|$|<b>Digital</b> <b>Command</b> Control (DCC) <b>systems</b> {{are used}} to operate {{locomotives}} on a model railroad (railway). Equipped with DCC, locomotives on the same electrical section of track can be independently controlled. While DCC {{is only one of}} several alternative systems for digital model train control, it is often misinterpreted to be a generic term for such systems. Several major manufacturers offer DCC systems.|$|R
50|$|Since 2006 Bachmann {{has been}} concentrating on {{implementing}} a <b>Digital</b> <b>Command</b> Control ("DCC") <b>system</b> and products in its product lines, {{with the help}} and partnership of the German company, Lenz Elektronik, GmbH. Bachmann released its Dynamis DCC system in 2007 which enabled Bachmann to catch up technologically with other DCC companies. Currently Bachmann HO Spectrum lines are DCC on board, while {{the vast majority of}} its N Spectrum lines are DCC-ready.|$|R
50|$|After {{their return}} to Fort Hood, 1st Battalion 8th Cavalry was placed back into the 2nd Brigade Combat Team. Once both 1st and 2nd Brigades were {{situated}} they began the process of transitioning to the Force XXI turning in their tanks for the new M1A2 SEP version, which provides better optics along with a <b>digital</b> <b>command</b> and control <b>system.</b> Also part of the transition was that the Delta companies were deactivated and the headquarters were restructured, the remaining troops were integrated throughout the brigade and the division.|$|R
50|$|Static diorama models or 'push along' {{scale models}} are {{a branch of}} model {{railways}} for unpowered locomotives, examples are Lone Star and Airfix models. Powered model railways are now generally operated by low voltage direct current (DC) electricity supplied via the tracks, but there are exceptions, such as Märklin and Lionel Corporation, which use alternating current (AC). Modern <b>Digital</b> <b>Command</b> Control (DCC) <b>systems</b> use alternating current. Other locomotives, particularly large models can use steam. Steam and clockwork driven engines are still sought by collectors.|$|R
50|$|In the 1990s, {{computer}} {{design and}} methods of printing on 3-D objects helped create much more detailed and authentic models than the simple shapes and rudimentary graphics of the slot car boom. In addition, newly manufactured replicas of Aurora's HO slot cars of the 1960s and 1970s appeared {{on the market and}} consumers gained the option of racing either the modern high-tech wondercars or the more basic designs of an earlier time. In 2004, the <b>Digital</b> <b>Command</b> Control (DCC) <b>systems,</b> which had revolutionized model railroading in the 1990s, began to appear in 1:32 slot cars, offering the ability to race multiple cars per lane with more realistic passing.|$|R
25|$|A 16 channel <b>command</b> control <b>system</b> named Zero 1 was {{introduced}} in late 1979. Zero 1 was based on digital, not analog, technology, and as such was a forerunner to the NMRA <b>Digital</b> <b>Command</b> Control (DCC) <b>system,</b> {{which appeared in the}} 1990s. Advertisements claimed that 16 locomotives could be operated independently at the same time. Though an important milestone, Zero 1 was not widely successful; the controller units and decoder modules required for the locomotives were expensive, but with clean track and well serviced locos the system worked well. Control of points and other accessories was available in a very simple manner. Locomotives equipped with a Zero 1 decoder could not be used on conventional direct current systems, making it difficult to run one's locomotives on friends' layouts or club layouts. This was a common issue with <b>command</b> control <b>systems</b> in that time period. Locomotives with no decoder could not be used on a Zero 1 layout either.|$|R
5000|$|Formed in Glens Falls, New York, they {{originally}} played local venues around Lake George. Various lineups included Bobby Dick, Dominick DeMieri, Eddie Placidi, Eddie Brick, Kerim Capli, Clutch Reiser, Jimmy Wilcox, and Chris Schempp. Although {{they continued}} to tour and perform through 2010, their most popular period came in the late 1960s when they toured with The Monkees (1967) and Jimi Hendrix (1968). They recorded and released various tunes including the 1967 single [...] "Always You" [...] which was released by the Decca label. The band's most ambitious recording, an album entitled Captain Nemo, was recorded during that same period and released in 1968. Their work included appearances on the television shows The Flying Nun and It Takes a Thief. They also appeared in the film, Don't Make Waves, which starred Tony Curtis.Their sound man (and occasional keyboard player), Jim Scorse, went on to form the very successful North Coast Engineering (NCE), a <b>digital</b> <b>command</b> control <b>system</b> for model railroads.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>digital</b> <b>command</b> control <b>system</b> was {{developed}} (under contract by Lenz Elektronik GmbH of Germany) in the 1980s for two German model railway manufacturers, Märklin and Arnold. The first digital decoders that Lenz produced {{appeared on the}} market early 1989 for Arnold (N) and mid 1990 for Märklin (Z, H0 and 1; Digital=). Märklin and Arnold exited the agreement over patent issues, but Lenz has continued to develop the system. In 1992 Stan Ames, who later chaired the NMRA/DCC Working Group, investigated the Märklin/Lenz system as possible candidate for the NMRA/DCC standards. When the NMRA Command Control committee requested submissions from manufacturers for its proposed command control standard in the 1990s, Märklin and Keller Engineering submitted their systems for evaluation. [...] The committee {{was impressed by the}} Märklin/Lenz system and had settled on digital early in the process. The NMRA eventually licensed the protocol from Lenz and extended it. The system was later named <b>Digital</b> <b>Command</b> Control. The proposed standard was published in the October 1993 issue of Model Railroader magazine prior to its adoption. The DCC protocol is the subject of two standards published by the NMRA: S-9.1 specifies the electrical standard, and S-9.2 specifies the communications standard. Several recommended practices documents are also available.|$|R

2500|$|Stewart is a {{model railway}} enthusiast. His 23 × 124 foot (≈7 × 37m) HO scale layout in his Los Angeles home is {{modelled}} after the New York Central and the Pennsylvania Railroads during the 1940s. Called the Three Rivers City, the layout was featured in the cover story of the December 2007, December 2010, February 2014, and June 2017 issues of Model Railroader magazine. In the 2007 article, Stewart said that it meant more to {{him to be in}} a model railroad magazine than a music magazine. On his Los Angeles railroad, Rod used code 70 flextrack and a DCC (<b>Digital</b> <b>Command</b> Control) <b>system</b> made by Digitrax. The layout has a mainline run of 900 feet. He has a smaller second layout at his UK home, based on Britain's East Coast Main Line. In a sidebar to the 2014 Model Railroader article, Stewart admitted (in an anecdote about his having unwittingly mixed red scenery texturing material into a [...] "turf" [...] mix he used around the bases of buildings) that he is colour-blind.|$|R
5000|$|Dimensia was RCA's {{brand name}} for their {{high-end}} models of television systems and their components (Tuner, VCR, CD Player, etc.) produced from 1984 to 1989, with variations continuing {{into the early}} 1990s, superseded by the ProScan model line. After RCA was acquired by General Electric in 1986, GE sold the RCA consumer electronics line to Thomson SA which continued the Dimensia line. They are significant for their wide array of advanced features and for being the first television receiver systems to feature a built in computer, somewhat of an early incarnation of a smart TV, but without internet access (see Technological convergence). In 1985, RCA released the <b>Digital</b> <b>Command</b> Component <b>System,</b> a fully integrated audio system that permitted the full functionality of Dimensia audio components without a Dimensia monitor. The name [...] "Dimensia" [...] actually {{dates back to the}} early 1970s when RCA used the term for an enhanced spatial stereo effect which they called [...] "Dimensia IV". The tagline for the Dimensia was The Next Dimension in Sight and Sound.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Safety {{systems in}} nuclear {{industry}} must conform to an increasing set of regulatory requirements. These requirements are scattered throughout multiple documents expressing {{different levels of}} requirements or different kinds of requirements. Consequently, when licensees want to extract the set of regulations related to a specific concern, they lack explicit traces between all regulation documents and mostly get lost while attempting to compare two different regulatory corpora. This paper presents the regulatory landscape {{in the context of}} <b>digital</b> Instrumentation and <b>Command</b> <b>systems</b> in nuclear power plants. To cope with this complexity, we define and discuss challenges toward an approach based on information retrieval techniques to first narrow the regulatory research space into themes and then assist the recovery of these traceability links...|$|R
40|$|International audiencehis paper {{proposed}} {{the design of}} a novel harmonic rejection <b>system</b> of <b>digital</b> control <b>command.</b> The <b>system</b> is based on integrated active inductors with the QUBiC 4 Xi library which is a 0. 25 mu m BiCMOS process of NXP. It is dedicated to the dense aperture array for the radio astronomy project SKA (Square Kilometre Array). The proposed system allows protecting the radio frequency (RF) signals against harmonics coming from the digital signals in [300 - 1500] MHz frequency band. In this work, the Advanced Design System (ADS) is used for the design and the simulations, and Cadence for the layout. The simulation results show that the harmonics rejection is better than 105 dB from 300 MHz with a digital clock signal of 1 MHz...|$|R
50|$|Three {{telemetry}} channels {{were available}} for telecommunications. Channel A carried engineering data at 8⅓ or 33⅓ bit/s, channel B carried scientific data at 66⅔ or 270 bit/s and channel C carried science data at 16,200 bit/s. Communications were accomplished through the high- and low-gain antennas, via dual S-band traveling wave tube amplifiers, operating at 10 or 20 watts, for transmission. The design also included a single receiver. An analog tape recorder, with a capacity of 195 million bits, could store television images for subsequent transmission. Other science data was stored on a <b>digital</b> recorder. The <b>command</b> <b>system,</b> consisting of a central computer and sequencer (CC&S), was designed to actuate specific events at precise times. The CC&S was programmed with both a standard mission and a conservative backup mission before launch, but could be commanded and reprogrammed in flight. It could perform 53 direct commands, 5 control commands, and 4 quantitative commands.|$|R
50|$|TMCC {{utilizes}} {{the same}} <b>command</b> codes as <b>Digital</b> <b>Command</b> Control (DCC). However, unlike DCC, {{it uses a}} 455 kHz radio transmission to carry the command codes separate from track power. The locomotive decoders are dependent on AC track power (50 or 60 Hz) to synchronize the command receiver. Thus, TMCC can only operate on AC track power. Because TMCC utilizes the DCC command codes, {{it is possible to}} control TMCC with DCC compatible software. MTH Electric Trains included support to interface and control TMCC with its DCS system. Unlike DCC, TMCC-equipped locomotives can run simultaneously with non-TMCC locomotives. Lionel ceased the sale of TMCC <b>command</b> <b>systems</b> in 2010, but continues to introduce models equipped with TMCC decoders. TMCC has been superseded by Lionel's Legacy <b>command</b> <b>system.</b>|$|R
40|$|Interface {{problems}} have been cited as critical factor in the suboptimal performance of a large-scale <b>digital</b> <b>command</b> and control <b>system.</b> A live field study involving fully functioning Brigade and Battlegroup headquarters was observed. More than 3, 000 communications events were extracted and analyzed {{in terms of their}} quantity, direction, and content. The effect of the interface problem was pronounced. Voice mediated communications (conducted by radio and avoiding the interface entirely) were superior at converting “data” into “information. ” In cases where the interface was relied upon, users seized on a highly simplistic comms. facility and put it to use in ways that were not anticipated. The findings added significant value in terms of the phased, real-world delivery of this system. Very little human factors analysis had been performed previously. The current analysis, therefore, was able to provide a considerable amount of insight and justification for further design iterations. The take-away message: Neither networked technology nor the large quantities of raw data carried by it are sufficient to guarantee successful naturalistic decision making...|$|R
