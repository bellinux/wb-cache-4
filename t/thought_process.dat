5|$|<b>Thought</b> <b>process</b> in the MSE {{refers to}} the quantity, tempo (rate of flow) and form (or logical coherence) of thought. <b>Thought</b> <b>process</b> cannot be {{directly}} observed but {{can only be described}} by the patient, or inferred from a patient's speech. Regarding the tempo of thought, some people may experience flight of ideas, when their thoughts are so rapid that their speech seems incoherent, although a careful observer can discern a chain of poetic associations in the patient's speech. Alternatively an individual may be described as having retarded or inhibited thinking, in which thoughts seem to progress slowly with few associations. Poverty of thought is a global reduction in the quantity of thought and thought perseveration refers to a pattern where a person keeps returning to the same limited set of ideas. A pattern of interruption or disorganization of thought processes is broadly referred to as formal thought disorder, and might be described more specifically as thought blocking, fusion, loosening of associations, tangential thinking, derailment of thought, or knight's move thinking. Thought may be described as circumstantial when a patient includes a great deal of irrelevant detail and makes frequent diversions, but remains focused on the broad topic.|$|E
5|$|Director Mitsuo Fukuda {{stated that}} {{initially}} {{the story of}} Gundam SEED was written from Kira's point of view. Kira's personality and <b>thought</b> <b>process</b> were derived from what Fukuda considered to be Japanese people's thoughts. He said that his story was about his forced wish to fight, in contrast to Shinn Asuka who was not reluctant to fight in Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny. In retrospective, Fukuda emphasized a contrast between both Kira's and Shinn's characters to the point both were the opposite of each other regarding their opinions; Kira's development was easier to script. Fukuda said that as both Kira's and Shinn's characters as were similar, they were easy to voice. An official guidebook to the series made an official count {{of the number of}} times Kira cried in Gundam SEED by the time the book was released. He was said to have cried over ten times, and thus a comical message of support was made towards him.|$|E
5|$|Long before {{working on}} Charlotte, Maeda had thought up a concept {{for a story}} with {{characters}} who have imperfect superpowers that must cooperate {{with each other to}} resolve any incidents that arise. Maeda originally submitted three separate ideas for a story to Toba, and he asked him which one he liked best. However, after Toba pointed out one of the other two, Maeda {{made it clear that he}} wanted to do the story that would become Charlotte. When writing the story, Maeda also reconsidered how he had done certain things with Angel Beats!. In particular, he attempted to put more of a focus on the behavior of the characters. Maeda also narrowed down the number of main characters in Charlotte compared to Angel Beats!, which could not put a focus on each and every character. Toba felt that Maeda was influenced by his work on Angel Beats!, which changed his <b>thought</b> <b>process</b> and what he wanted to depict in Charlotte.|$|E

40|$|As {{part of a}} {{large scale}} {{evaluation}} of the state gifted program in Illinois, the systematic collection and processing of low inference student judgments about their classes was used to describe and evaluate classroom tran'actions. Profiles of 62 gifted classes were compared to 69 average classes on the Class Activity Questionnaire. This questionnaire consists of paired items comprising seven cognitive factors based on Bloom's Taxonomy and nine affective factors (such as discussion opportunity, test/grade stress) which yield a profile in instructional climate. Four subscores show emphasis on Lower <b>Thought</b> <b>Processes,</b> Higher <b>Thought</b> <b>Processes,</b> Classroom Focus, and Classroom Climate. It was found that gifted classes were superior in emphasizing higher <b>thought</b> <b>processes,</b> classroom focus, and classroom climate but not lower <b>thought</b> <b>processes.</b> In addition, factor analysis suggested two distinc...|$|R

40|$|People {{can engage}} in {{prolonged}} <b>thought</b> <b>processes,</b> such as when they are facing an important decision or when {{they are working on}} a scientific discovery. Such <b>thought</b> <b>processes</b> can take months or even years. We argue that while people engage in such thinking, they make progress not only when they consciously think but also sometimes when they are consciously thinking about something elsethat is, while they think unconsciously. We review the literature on unconscious <b>thought</b> (UT) <b>processes</b> and conclude that there is indeed quite some evidence for UT. Conceptualized as a form of unconscious goal pursuit, UT is likely to be especially fruitful for <b>thought</b> <b>processes</b> that are complex, important, or interesting to the thinker. In addition, we discuss other characteristics of the UT process. We end with proposing Type 3 processes, in addition to Type 1 and Type 2 (or Systems 1 and 2) processes, to accommodate prolonged <b>thought</b> <b>processes</b> in models on thought...|$|R

Patients with TMA have impaired writing skills, difficulty speaking and difficulty maintaining a clear <b>thought</b> <b>process.</b> Furthermore, TMA is caused by lesions in cortical motor areas of the brain as well as lesions in the anterior portion of the basal ganglia, and can be seen in patients with expressive aphasia.|$|E

25|$|Hamlet's soliloquies have {{captured}} the attention of scholars as well. Early critics viewed such speeches as To be, or not to be as Shakespeare's expressions of his own personal beliefs. Later scholars, such as Charney, have rejected this theory saying the soliloquies are expressions of Hamlet's <b>thought</b> <b>process.</b> During his speeches, Hamlet interrupts himself, expressing disgust in agreement with himself, and embellishing his own words. He has difficulty expressing himself directly, and instead skirts around the basic idea of his thought. Not until late in the play, after his experience with the pirates, is Hamlet really able to be direct and sure in his speech.|$|E

She stated in an NPR Fresh Air interview that she was asked to repeat the joke on Politically Incorrect, among other places, but eventually dropped it from her act because she felt it was becoming stale.|$|E
