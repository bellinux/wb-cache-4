PURPOSE: To assess the accuracy of 6 popular activity trackers at measuring steps while walking on a treadmill. METHODS: Twenty-six college students (Mean±SD; 22. 1 ± 3. 7 yrs; 25. 1 ± 4. 0 kg/m 2; 13 male) walked 500 steps at 3 mph on a treadmill while wearing 6 different activity trackers (Pedometer, Fitbit Blaze, Charge HR, Alta, Flex, Zip, One). The Charge HR was placed two fingers above the right wrist while the Flex was next to the wrist bone. The Blaze was placed two fingers above the left wrist while the Alta was next to the wrist bone. The Fitbit Zip and the One were aligned with the hipbone on the left and right waistband respectively. Steps were counted by a trained researcher using a hand <b>tally</b> <b>counter.</b> Missing values were replaced with the mean value for that device. Step counts were correlated between Fitbit devices and the pedometer and <b>tally</b> <b>counter</b> using Pearson correlations. Significance was set at p 3 ̆c 0. 05. Mean bias scores were calculated between the step counts for each device and the <b>tally</b> <b>counter.</b> Mean Absolute Percent Error (MAPE) values were also calculated for each device relative to the <b>tally</b> <b>counter.</b> RESULTS: Fitbit Zip and One were significantly correlated with the <b>tally</b> <b>counter</b> (r= 0. 50, p 3 ̆c 0. 05; r= 0. 68, p 3 ̆c 0. 01, respectively) while the other devices were not significantly correlated. Mean bias and MAPE values were as follows: Device (Mean Bias/MAPE) Pedometer (- 0. 2 ± 39. 2 / 3. 8 ± 6. 8), Blaze (34. 5 ± 67. 1 / 9. 9 ± 11. 3), Charge HR (- 12. 6 ± 61. 5 / 7. 0 ± 10. 3), Alta (- 85. 0 ± 70. 8 / 17. 1 ± 14. 1), Flex (49. 5 ± 242. 4 / 19. 7 ± 45. 3), Zip (1. 8 ± 3. 4 / 0. 4 ± 0. 6), One (0. 2 ± 2. 1 / 0. 3 ± 0. 3).

40|$|Abstract Background The manual {{counting}} {{of cells}} by microscopy is a commonly used technique across biological disciplines. Traditionally, hand tally counters {{have been used}} to track event counts. Although this method is adequate, {{there are a number of}} inefficiencies which arise when managing large numbers of samples or large sample sizes. Results We describe software that mimics a traditional multi-register <b>tally</b> <b>counter.</b> Full customizability allows operation on any computer with minimal hardware requirements. The efficiency of counting large numbers of samples and/or large sample sizes is improved through the use of a "multi-count" register that allows single keystrokes to correspond to multiple events. Automatically updated multi-parameter values are implemented as user-specified equations, reducing errors and time required for manual calculations. The user interface was optimized for use with a touch screen and numeric keypad, eliminating the need for a full keyboard and mouse. Conclusions Our software provides an inexpensive, flexible, and productivity-enhancing alternative to manual hand tally counters. </p...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{determine}} {{the merits of}} a robot at the community pharmacy in a quasi-experiment. Method: The applied methods for data-collection were barcode-time measurements, direct observations, time-interval studies, and tally at a Dutch community pharmacy. The topics consisted of workload, waiting times, congestion, slack, general work, counter work, and work at the consultation room. The topics were studied in pre-test and post-test stages, each stage during six weeks. By using these topics and some additional data from the pharmacy, {{the economics of the}} robot were also assessed. Results: The workload decreased with 15 prescriptions per person per day. The waiting times decreased with one minute and 18 seconds per dispensing process, reducing the wait until counter contact. The day congestion decreased with one hour 27 minutes and 36 seconds, and the day slack increased with 28 minutes. The analysis of the general work showed no appreciable difference in the bulk of the care-related activities and the other activities. However, some work was re-shuffled: 7 % increase at counter work and 7 % decrease at logistics. Moreover, statistically significant increases were observed at counter work (5 %) and robot work (4 %), and significant decreases at telephone (3 %) and filling work in presence of the patient (4 %). The <b>counter</b> <b>tally</b> study showed a rise in care-related activities with 8 %. Moreover, it also illuminated a statistically significant decrease at no information (11 %) and an increase at only social (2 %). The consultation room was never used during the study. The pharmacy economics of the robot showed that the robot had high estimated costs for purchase, depreciation, and maintenance: EUR 187, 024 in the first year. Moreover, the robot had positive impact on waiting times, congestion, staffing, logistics, and care-related work, which was estimated on EUR 91, 198 in the first year. The estimated payback time of the robot was three years. Conclusions: An introduction of the robot may indeed have the often supposed positive effects on pharmaceutical care. Even though the costs are high and the technical problems are present, the robot seems to be financial beneficial after three years.

Methods: To {{examine the effect of}} speed, 60 subjects walked on a treadmill at 2, 3, and 4 mph. Twenty subjects also ran at 6, 7, and 8 mph. To test lifestyle activities, 60 subjects performed front-back-side-side stepping, elliptical machine and stair climbing/descending. Twenty others performed ballroom dancing. Sixty participants completed 5 100 -step trials while wearing 5 different sets of the devices tested device reliability. Actual steps were determined using a hand <b>tally</b> <b>counter.</b> Results: Significant differences existed among pedometers (P 3 ̆c. 05). For walking, the Omron pedometers were the most valid. The Sportline overestimated and the Yamax underestimated steps (P 3 ̆c. 05). Worn on the waist or in the backpack, the Omron device and Sportline were valid for running. The Omron was valid for 3 activities (elliptical machine, ascending and descending stairs). The Sportline overestimated all of these activities, and Yamax was only valid for descending stairs.

In addition, to obtain accurate results, {{it was also}} necessary to position them in a certain way. By contrast, newer models can be placed anywhere on the body; however, their accuracy is unknown when they are placed at different body sites. We determined the accuracy of various newer pedometers under controlled laboratory and free walking conditions. A total of 40 participants, who varied widely in age and body mass index, were recruited for the study. The numbers of steps recorded using five different pedometers placed at the waist, the chest, in a pocket, and on an armband were compared against those counted with a hand <b>tally</b> <b>counter.</b> With the exception of one, all the pedometers were accurate at moderate walking speeds, irrespective of their placement on the body. However, the accuracy tended to decrease at slower and faster walking speeds, especially when the pedometers were worn in the pockets or kept in the purse (p <  0. 05).

One of the most popular and objective methods of assessing physical activity is using motion sensors such as pedometers and accelerometers. The {{purpose of this study was}} to assess the accuracy and reliability of step counting and energy expenditure estimation of two popular electronic pedometers and one accelerometer during running. In all step-counting trials, actual step counts were determined using a hand <b>tally</b> <b>counter.</b> Twenty subjects (18 - 40 years) were asked to volunteer to participate in the study. During the initial assessment subjects ran at five, six, seven, and eight miles per hour on a motor driven treadmill for ten minutes at each speed. While running they wore two pedometers and an accelerometer while oxygen consumption was measured. In the second assessment, all subjects ran a timed, self-paced mile around a 200 -meter track while wearing all three activity monitors. In the third assessment, thirteen subjects ran at five, six, seven and eight miles per hour on a motor driven treadmill for three minutes at each speed to assess the step counting reliability of the devices. The three devices were accurate to within 1 % at all speeds on the treadmill and on the self-paced track run. In addition, all three devices were reliable (r = 0. 80). Caloric expenditure estimation accuracy the NL- 2000 was ± 21 % when expressed in both net and gross kcals. The Digi-walker was f 22 % when assumed to be net kcals and ± 45 % when assumed to be gross kcals. The Actigraph was accurate to ± 49 % in terms of net calories. The results of the current study have shown that these devices are accurate and reliable for step counting at speeds between five and eight mph. However, their ability to assess caloric expenditure is not accurate at the same speeds.

40|$|Introduction The {{transition}} from intrauterine to extrauterine life requires a complex physiological process, nevertheless most neonates manage {{to go through}} it on their own. Only 10 % need respiratory assistance. Neonatal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) including chest compressions (CC) is with < 1 % a rare event in the delivery room. However medical staff needs to be proficient in neonatal CPR and in handling the different devices. Training, based on international resuscitation guidelines, helps to be skilled for these infrequent events. The aim of this thesis is to assess the effect of different medical devices on manual ventilation during neonatal resuscitation and to evaluate strategys to improve simulated neonatal resuscitation training. Methods We studied practical handling of different devices for manual ventilation and simulated neonatal resuscitation trainung, while visualising generated parameters and using a musical prompt. We used a 1000 g preterm neonate manikin to measure positive inspiratory pressures (PIP), tidal volume (Vt) and manual inflations (MI) with a respiratory function monitor (RFM) and CC using a <b>tally</b> <b>counter.</b> Results Regarding handling the different devices for PIP adjustment, there was less time needed when using SIB (PIP from 20 to 25 cmH 2 O TPR 1 (F&P) 7. 5 s; TPR 2 (GE) 6. 5 s; SIB 3. 9 s, SIBM(SIB with manometer) 3. 4 s, from 25 to 40 cmH 2 O TPR 1 18. 8 s, TPR 2 12. 7 s, SIB 4. 4 s, SIBM 3. 4 s). When using TPR staff could stay closer to target PIPs. With regard to training PIP and Vt-values could significantly be reduced (from 32. 3 cm H 2 O / 6. 7 ml to 17. 8 cm H 2 O / 3. 5 ml to 18. 7 cm H 2 O / 4. 1 ml). 3 : 1 Coordination of CC (115 to 96 /min) and MI (38 to 32 /min) during CPR was significantly better with use of a musical prompt. Apart from that interindividual variability could be reduced about 86 % regarding CC and 60 % regarding MI. Take home points For every day use: Staff can adjust PIP faster with SIBM (SIB+maonometer) PIP were closer to target values using TPR. Routine training and a musical prompt can help to feel more confident performing neonatal CPR...|$|E
