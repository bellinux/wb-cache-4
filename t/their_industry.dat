40|$|Swedish firms {{acquired}} by foreigners were considerably {{larger than the}} average firms in <b>their</b> <b>industries.</b> They were relatively low in value added per employee {{at the time of}} takeover and before, a characteristic we take to indicate relatively low profitability, capital intensity, or efficiency,or some combination of these. However, they had been growing at least as fast as <b>their</b> <b>industries</b> over the longest periods we can measure. The takeovers tended to take place in years when the acquired firms did poorly relative to <b>their</b> <b>industries</b> and also relative to their own past performance with respect to the growth of employment, value of production,and value added. Thus the acquired firms seem to have been weak relative to others in <b>their</b> <b>industries</b> and had particularly suffered during the year in which the takeovers occurred. There were short-term recoveries after takeover from the misfortunes of the takeover year and a return to higher growth rates of employment and output, particularly the former. Over the longer run the acquired firms did not show the same relative employment gains as in the first year or two after takeover but seem to have increased their profitability or efficiency relative to <b>their</b> <b>industries.</b> The industries in which takeovers took place grew more rapidly after the takeovers than total manufacturing although they had grown less rapidly in the years before takeover. ...|$|R

25|$|The name {{industrial}} and organizational psychology (I–O) {{arose in the}} 1960s and became enshrined as the Society for Industrial and Organizational Psychology, Division 14 of the American Psychological Association, in 1973. The goal is to optimize human potential in the workplace. Personnel psychology, a subfield of I–O psychology, applies the methods and principles of psychology in selecting and evaluating workers. I–O psychology's other subfield, organizational psychology, examines the effects of work environments and management styles on worker motivation, job satisfaction, and productivity. The majority of I–O psychologists work outside of academia, for private and public organizations and as consultants. A psychology consultant working in business today might expect to provide executives with information and ideas about <b>their</b> <b>industry,</b> their target markets, {{and the organization of}} their company.|$|E

This was followed by two further by-elections in Rhondda West in 1967 and Caerphilly in 1968 in which the party achieved massive swings of 30% and 40% respectively, coming within a whisker of victory. The results were caused partly by an anti-Labour backlash.

Harvey Weinstein— co-chairman of Miramax, along with his brother, Bob— was instantly enthralled by the script and the company picked it up. Pulp Fiction, the first Miramax project to get a green light after the Disney acquisition, was budgeted at $8.5 million. It became the first movie that Miramax completely financed. Helping hold costs down was the plan Bender executed to pay all the main actors the same amount per week, regardless of <b>their</b> <b>industry</b> status. The biggest star {{to sign on to}} the project was Bruce Willis. Though he had recently appeared in several big-budget flops, he was still a major overseas draw.

25|$|The {{primary goal}} of {{financial}} management is to maximize or to continually increase shareholder value. Maximizing shareholder value requires managers {{to be able to}} balance capital funding between investments in projects that increase the firm's long term profitability and sustainability, along with paying excess cash in the form of dividends to shareholders. Managers of growth companies (i.e. firms that earn high rates of return on invested capital) will use most of the firm's capital resources and surplus cash on investments and projects so the company can continue to expand its business operations into the future. When companies reach maturity levels within <b>their</b> <b>industry</b> (i.e. companies that earn approximately average or lower returns on invested capital), managers of these companies will use surplus cash to payout dividends to shareholders. Managers must do an analysis to determine the appropriate allocation of the firm's capital resources and cash surplus between projects and payouts of dividends to shareholders, as well as paying back creditor related debt.|$|E
