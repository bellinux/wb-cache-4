It has been questioned whether this was actually the <b>type</b> <b>specimen,</b> but in 1969, the Dutch zoologists Antonius M.

5|$|A new species, Podoserpula miranda, was {{proposed}} in 2009 {{by a group}} of New Caledonian mycologists for a species of that South Pacific archipelago. The name was provisional (not validly published), however, as the description was in French (the code of nomenclature mandates Latin) and lacked a required designation of a <b>type</b> <b>specimen.</b> It was validly published in 2013.|$|E
5|$|Also synonymised {{with this}} species is Adenanthos crenata, {{published}} by Carl Ludwig Willdenow's in Kurt Polycarp Joachim Sprengel's 1825 16th edition of Systema Vegetabilium.

5|$|German naturalist Ernst Friedrich Germar {{described}} the floury baker in 1834 as Cicada curvicosta.

5|$|He thought {{its closest}} {{relative}} was clearly Banksia serrata and then B.ornata, {{and that the}} three formed a link with western species.

5|$|The {{issue of}} {{synonyms}} {{is complicated by}} the <b>type</b> <b>specimen</b> of Allosaurus fragillis (catalogue number YPM 1930) being extremely fragmentary, consisting of a few incomplete vertebrae, limb bone fragments, rib fragments, and a tooth. Because of this, several scientists have noted that the <b>type</b> <b>specimen,</b> and thus the genus Allosaurus itself or at least the species A. fragillis, is technically a nomen dubium ("dubious name", based on a specimen too incomplete to compare to other specimens or to classify). In an attempt to fix this situation, Gregory S. Paul and Kenneth Carpenter (2010) submitted a petition to the ICZN to have the name A. fragillis officially transferred to the more complete specimen USNM4734 (as a neotype). This request is currently pending review.|$|E

40|$|Species {{diversity}} {{is one of}} the central topics of biodiversity. <b>Type</b> <b>specimens</b> are the permanent vouchers of taxonomic names, and are irreplaceable as a means to safeguard the stability of the nomenclatural system. Holdings of common <b>specimens</b> and <b>type</b> <b>specimens</b> are indices reflecting historical accumulation of botanical studies for a certain country or region. This paper reviews holdings of common <b>specimens</b> and <b>type</b> <b>specimens</b> in herbaria worldwide and those native to China. Overall, we conclude that type collections in herbaria of China are relatively less than the world on average, because plants from China were studied by western botanists for over 400 years before Chinese botanists started to collect specimens and study plants in the early twentieth century. Based on digitization of <b>type</b> <b>specimens</b> housed in native herbaria, it is now urgent to digitize not only <b>type</b> <b>specimens</b> of Chinese herbaria, but also those held in herbaria abroad. In addition, the number of collections per species in Chinese herbaria is much less than the world average. For Chinese botanical researchers, it is important to conduct investigations in poorly studied areas in China and overseas, and to enhance the overall number and representation of specimens for each species...|$|R

5|$|Apatosaurus louisae {{was named}} by Holland in 1916, being first known from a partial {{skeleton}} {{that was found}} in Utah. The holotype is CM3018, with referred specimens including CM3378, CM11162, and LACM52844. The former two consist of a vertebral column; the latter two consist of a skull and a nearly complete skeleton, respectively. Apatosaurus louisae specimens all come from the late Kimmeridgian of Dinosaur National Monument. In 2015 Tschopp etal. found the <b>type</b> <b>specimen</b> of Apatosaurus laticollis to nest closely with CM3018, meaning the former is likely a junior synonym of A.louisae.|$|E
5|$|At the time, no <b>type</b> <b>specimen</b> was specified, as the {{practice}} only arose later, in the 19th century. When a lectotype (type selected amongst original material) was designated, it {{was assigned to}} specimen 242.1 of Linnaeus' herbarium, the only V.thapsus specimen. The species had previously been designated as type species for Verbascum. European plants exhibit considerable phenotypical variation, {{which has led to}} the plant acquiring many synonyms over the years. Introduced American populations show much less variation.|$|E
