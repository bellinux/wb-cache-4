5|$|Following the cliffhanger of the {{previous}} episode, alien time traveller the Doctor (Matt Smith), his companion Amy Pond (Karen Gillan), River Song, and Father Octavian (Iain Glen) and his militarised clerics have escaped entrapment by the Weeping Angels, creatures who only move when unobserved by others. They take refuge inside the crashed starship Byzantium, but the Angels pursue them and Amy is {{on the brink of}} dying from <b>the</b> <b>imprint</b> <b>of</b> an Angel in her eye. Both the Angels and the Doctor's team face danger from a widening crack in space and time which has the power to erase persons from history.|$|E
5|$|Platform E6 is {{situated}} {{on the west side}} of the Group E plaza. It is roughly built from irregularly sized, poorly cut stones. The platform faces east towards Pyramid E1 and has four access stairways. The platform once supported perishable residences; these were built from maize stalks bound together with clay, as evidenced by <b>the</b> <b>imprint</b> <b>of</b> the maize stalks in the fragments of clay wall recovered during excavations. The platform itself was once covered with stucco.|$|E
5|$|When {{attempting}} {{to visit the}} San 'Shyuum home world, the four are captured by Builders, commanded by the Master Builder. The Didact and humans are held prisoner, but Bornstellar is returned {{to the care of}} his father because of his family's status and power. On his family's home world, he uses the time and peace to reflect on recent events, and allow <b>the</b> <b>imprint</b> <b>of</b> the Didact to fully assimilate into his thoughts. He overhears an argument between his father and another Builder, from which he learns that his father was one of the chief builders of the Halos. The Didact opposed the Builders' decision to construct such a weapon, hence his exile. It is soon revealed that the Master Builder is being brought up on charges and that the Halo weapons had been recalled, but one of the rings had gone missing. Bornstellar is called to a Forerunner core planet to testify against the Master Builder, who has been put on trial for crimes against The Mantle, a Forerunner philosophy that values the preservation of life over all else. Just as the trial is about to begin, an AI, Mendicant Bias, betrays the Forerunners and intends to use the combined power of the Halos to begin wiping out the Forerunner race.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> {{grouping}} <b>of</b> <b>imprinted</b> genes within clusters {{allows them}} to share common regulatory elements, such as non-coding RNAs and differentially methylated regions (DMRs). When these regulatory elements control <b>the</b> <b>imprinting</b> <b>of</b> one or more genes, they are known as imprinting control regions (ICR). The expression of non-coding RNAs, such as Air on mouse chromosome 17 and KCNQ1OT1 on human chromosome 11p15.5, {{have been shown to}} be essential for <b>the</b> <b>imprinting</b> <b>of</b> genes in their corresponding regions.|$|R

40|$|Molecular {{imprinting}} is {{now recognized}} as one of the most rapid and powerful methods for creating tailor-made synthetic receptors with strong, yet selective, affinities for a diverse selection <b>of</b> analytes. <b>The</b> <b>imprinting</b> <b>of</b> small organic compounds, metal ions and peptides is well developed and almost routine, and <b>the</b> <b>imprinting</b> <b>of</b> much larger analytes, such as proteins and cells, has also now been demonstrated. The impressive molecular recognition characteristics <b>of</b> molecularity <b>imprinted</b> materials, allied to their highly robust physical nature, makes them ideally suited for numerous application in affinity separation. This article will outline the general principles behind molecular <b>imprinting</b> and <b>the</b> generic approaches to <b>the</b> preparation <b>of</b> <b>imprinted</b> materials.

40|$|Molecularly {{imprinted}} polymers (MIPs) are synthetic receptors with tailor-made recognition {{sites for}} the target molecules. Their high molecular recognition ability, good stability, easy preparation, and low cost make them highly promising substitutes for biological receptors. Recent years have witnessed rapidly increasing interest in <b>the</b> <b>imprinting</b> <b>of</b> biomacromolecules and especially proteins because of the great potential of these MIPs in such applications as proteome analysis, clinical diagnostics, and biomedicine. So far, some useful strategies {{have been developed for}} <b>the</b> <b>imprinting</b> <b>of</b> proteins and controlled radical polymerization techniques have proven highly versatile for such purpose. This mini-review describes recent developments in the controlled preparation of proteins-imprinted polymers via such advanced polymerization techniques...|$|R

25|$|Some {{asserted}} that Rachmaninoff's music was derivative, {{perhaps because he}} was a Romantic at heart and eschewed much of the contemporary revolution in musical thought which was emerging in the early 20th century. Music critic Paul Rosenfeld’s remark that Rachmaninoff's music ‘wants <b>the</b> <b>imprint</b> <b>of</b> a decided and important individuality,’ can have done nothing to alleviate the composer's writer's block.|$|E

25|$|Zamfirescu's creations were {{original}} in style, blending {{a series}} of contrasting influences. One of the most enduring of these was the prose of Nicolae Gane. After parting with Parnassianism and Romanticism, Duiliu Zamfirescu adopted some of Gane's themes (including his compassionate perspective on the decay of low-ranking boyars as a social class) and, in part, his storytelling techniques. The writer was also known for the frequent comparisons he drew between his novels and those of Leo Tolstoy. Most of his later works bear <b>the</b> <b>imprint</b> <b>of</b> Neoclassicism.|$|E

25|$|Gutenberg is also {{credited}} {{with the introduction of}} an oil-based ink which was more durable than the previously used water-based inks. As printing material he used both paper and vellum (high-quality parchment). In the Gutenberg Bible, Gutenberg made a trial of coloured printing for a few of the page headings, present only in some copies. A later work, the Mainz Psalter of 1453, presumably designed by Gutenberg but published under <b>the</b> <b>imprint</b> <b>of</b> his successors Johann Fust and Peter Schöffer, had elaborate red and blue printed initials.|$|E
25|$|Some {{political}} analysts, {{particularly in}} Taiwanese newspapers, {{have speculated that}} the moderate approach that the Central Government has presented toward Hong Kong bears <b>the</b> <b>imprint</b> <b>of</b> more reformist thinking in the new fourth generation of leadership led by paramount leader Hu Jintao and premier Wen Jiabao. It has also been suggested that {{a major influence on}} Beijing's reaction to the demonstrations is the strong desire to put on a good face before the Presidential election in Taiwan in March 2004 and generally make Taiwanese public opinion more amenable to the cause of Chinese reunification.|$|E
25|$|Many {{scholars}} {{believe the}} individual Psalms were redacted {{into a single}} collection in Second-Temple times. It had long been recognized that the collection bore <b>the</b> <b>imprint</b> <b>of</b> an underlying message or metanarrative, but that this message remained concealed, as Augustine of Hippo said, 'The sequence of the Psalms {{seems to me to}} contain the secret of a mighty mystery, but its meaning has not been revealed to me.' (Enarr. on Ps. 150.1) Others pointed out the presence of concatenation, that is, adjacent Psalms sharing similar words and themes. In time, this approach developed into recognizing overarching themes shared by whole groups of psalms.|$|E
