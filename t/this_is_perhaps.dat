5|$|Building {{a castle}} {{sometimes}} required {{the permission of}} the king or other high authority. In 864 the King of West Francia, Charles the Bald, prohibited the construction of castella without his permission and ordered them all to be destroyed. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>perhaps</b> the earliest reference to castles, though military historian R. Allen Brown points out that the word castella may have applied to any fortification at the time.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{their legal}} {{privileges}} over that of merchants, {{the work of}} artisans was considered by Han Confucian scholars to be of secondary importance to that of farmers. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>perhaps</b> largely because scholars and officials could not survive without the farmer's product and taxes paid in grain. The government relied on taxed grain to fund its military campaigns and stored surplus grain to mitigate widespread famine during times of poor harvest. Despite the prominence given to farmers, Confucian scholars did accept that artisans performed a vital economic role. This view was only rejected by {{a small minority of}} Legalists, who advocated a society of only soldiers and farmers, and certain Daoists who wanted everyone to live in self-sufficient villages and without commercial interests.|$|E
5|$|In close {{proximity}} is the burial of Tutankhamun. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>perhaps</b> {{the most famous}} discovery of modern Western archaeology. It was discovered here by Howard Carter on November 4, 1922, with clearance and conservation work continuing until 1932. This was the first royal tomb to be discovered that was still largely intact, although tomb robbers had entered. And until the excavation of KV63 on 10 March 2005, it considered the last major discovery in the valley. The opulence of his grave goods notwithstanding, Tutankhamun was a relatively minor king, and other burials probably had more numerous treasures.|$|E

5|$|The {{entrance}} to the keep was located in an avant-corps on the northern side, with a vaulted passageway between two gates leading from the outer courtyard to the inner rooms of the keep. The keep itself features just two round towers of 5m diameter with square bases, both located {{on the western side}} and within the outer ward. The more southern of the two is almost totally ruined, probably as a result of Ibrahim Pasha's destruction. The more exposed eastern and southern sides featured no towers. According to the historian Kevin Andrews, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>perhaps</b> because they were judged to be adequately protected by the steep terrain.|$|E
5|$|As {{the title}} suggests, {{one of the}} major themes of the film {{involves}} the temptations Father John faces to sin and stray from his priestly calling. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>perhaps</b> most strongly manifested in his apparent ambivalence regarding the vow of celibacy required of Catholic priests. As Father John goes deeper into the red-light district and the seedier aspects of Minneapolis, he appears to face temptations from the prostitution and overt sexuality surrounding him. Additionally, it can be interpreted that his interest in Linda is one of physical attraction, as well as a desire to help her. This is further manifested through the sudden reappearance of his former girlfriend, for whom Father John admits to still harboring romantic feelings. The priest demonstrates conflicting emotions when it comes to maintaining his priestly vows and his relationship with Nadine.|$|E
25|$|Eclogue VII is {{entitled}} Templum in some editions. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>perhaps</b> {{a mistake for}} Theatrum.|$|E
60|$|<b>This</b> <b>was,</b> <b>perhaps,</b> {{a greater}} {{tribute to the}} speaker's loyalty than to his {{knowledge}} of human nature, though Carsluith Maxwell was usually accounted a shrewd man.|$|R

25|$|As a corollary, tomb S9 likely {{belongs to}} Sobekhotep IV's {{predecessor}} and brother, Neferhotep I. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>perhaps</b> indirectly {{confirmed by the}} observation that both Sobekhotep IV and Neferhotep I {{are known to have}} been particularly active in Abydos.|$|E
25|$|The {{rejection}} of The Third Policeman by publishers {{in his lifetime}} {{had a profound effect}} on O'Nolan. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>perhaps</b> reflected in The Dalkey Archive, in which sections of The Third Policeman are recycled almost word for word, namely the atomic theory and the character De Selby.|$|E
25|$|Pictish {{is thought}} to have {{influenced}} the development of modern Scottish Gaelic. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>perhaps</b> most obvious in the contribution of loan words, but more importantly it is thought that Pictish influenced the syntax of Scottish Gaelic, which bears greater similarity to Brittonic languages than does Irish.|$|E

40|$|This study {{explored}} the antecedents of enjoyment and intention {{to continue in}} youth sports using the social-cognitive model of achievement motivation with the 2 x 2 achievement goal modification. Participants were 327 sports participants aged between 11 and 15 years. Individuals high in incremental beliefs reported greater enjoyment and intention to continue. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>perhaps</b> due to endorsing mastery-approach goals. Individuals relatively high in entity beliefs reported relatively less enjoyment. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>perhaps</b> due to endorsing performance-avoidance goals. These individuals also reported relatively less intention to continue regardless of their achievement goals. Findings could have implications for preventing dropout from youth sports...|$|R
25|$|A {{stand-alone}} executable of {{compact size}} is required that must execute without recourse to the run-time components or libraries {{associated with a}} high-level language; <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>perhaps</b> the most common situation. For example, firmware for telephones, automobile fuel and ignition systems, air-conditioning control systems, security systems, and sensors.|$|E
25|$|<b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>perhaps</b> best {{evidenced}} in that Victoria (i.e. the VFL representative team) had {{by far the}} best record in interstate games for a long time. But in 1977, when the first proper State of Origin match was played, it saw Western Australia inflict its biggest defeat on a Victorian team.|$|E
25|$|Springfield Mill: The oldest {{part was}} {{built as a}} {{warehouse}} about 1830.

50|$|Trevor Leggett, a {{frequent}} visitor to the Kodokan over many years, remarked that judo was much 'rougher' at the Kodokan prior to World War II than afterward; <b>this</b> <b>was,</b> <b>perhaps,</b> the influence of Mifune.|$|R
60|$|It {{struck him}} that <b>this</b> <b>was,</b> <b>perhaps,</b> imprudent, as it implied {{that they had}} been {{discussing}} her; but, on the other hand, he fancied that the candor of the statement was in his favor.|$|R

25|$|By {{comparison}} with , {{this is a}} current algebra in two spacetime dimensions, including a Schwinger term, with the space dimension curled up into a circle. In the classical setting of quantum field theory, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>perhaps</b> of little use, but {{with the advent of}} string theory where fields live on world sheets of strings, and spatial dimensions are curled up, there may be relevant applications.|$|E

25|$|Ashton's choreography {{has so far}} {{had only}} one full {{production}} outside The Royal Ballet, by the Ballet of the Teatro alla Scala, Milan on 21 April 2000. Some commentators have noted that <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>perhaps</b> a consequence of its length (around 100 minutes) which does not compare with other twentieth century ballets. The ballet has also been staged at Sadler's Wells, London and the Metropolitan Opera House, New York.|$|E
5000|$|A {{news article}} in the English-language China Post in Taiwan {{described}} the vice-presidential candidate in the upcoming January 2012 national elections as the incumbent president's [...] "sidekick", but <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>perhaps</b> a poor translation from the original Chinese.|$|R
50|$|Other {{styles in}} the Julio-Claudian era were {{designed}} to be simple, with hair parted in two and tied in a bun at the back. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>perhaps</b> done in order to juxtapose Roman modesty against Cleopatra and her flamboyance.|$|R
50|$|<b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>perhaps</b> surprising, as <b>was</b> press disinterest in the publication. Despite its {{acknowledged}} importance among senior {{politicians and}} business leaders, {{publication of the}} Action Plan received only one national newspaper report, and that was markedly flippant in tone.|$|R
25|$|Sometimes the {{restoration}} of the cover is a matter of surgically strengthening the original cover by lifting the original materials and applying new materials for strength. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>perhaps</b> a more common method for covers made with book-cloth although leather books can be approached this way as well. Materials such as Japanese tissues of various weights may be used. Colors may be matched using acrylic paints or simple colored pencils.|$|E
25|$|Year collections: Rather {{than being}} {{satisfied}} {{with a single}} specimen of a type, a great many collectors collect type by year; for example, one Memorial Lincoln Cent for every year from 1959 (the year it was first minted) to 2008 (the {{last year it was}} minted). <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>perhaps</b> one of the most practical ways to collect a national currency since probably the majority of coin reference books and coin albums catalogue in the same manner.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{its small}} size, CataÃ±o {{has a large}} {{population}} when compared to municipalities of similar areas. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>perhaps</b> due to its location near the capital of San Juan. The population, according to the 2000 census, was 30,071 with a population density of 6,014.2 people per square mile (2,313.1/kmÂ²). Although the current population is almost the double {{of what it was}} in the 1950 census, the current census reflects a small decrease of inhabitants.|$|E

50|$|Klein often {{initially}} sold {{these new}} gourmet foods, such as white truffles, {{at a loss}} {{in order to attract}} new customers. <b>This</b> <b>was,</b> <b>perhaps,</b> one of the first major instances that the concept of loss leader was introduced into the gourmet food market.|$|R
