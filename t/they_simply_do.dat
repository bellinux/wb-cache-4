2500|$|Gould {{is deeply}} {{influenced}} by Thomas Kuhn's The Structure of Scientific Revolutions. [...] Kuhn argued, in part, {{that science is}} a social activity and that theories are intellectual constructions imposed on data, not demanded by them. [...] Along with Kuhn and other philosophers and sociologists of science, Gould has recognized that mental constructs (metaphors, analogies, personal philosophies, imaginative leaps)—not empirical discoveries—are what bring about scientific advance. [...] "Facts" [...] are so embedded in a paradigm that <b>they</b> <b>simply</b> <b>do</b> not {{have the kind of}} independent probative power they were once thought to possess.|$|E
2500|$|Ayaan Hirsi Ali {{called on}} Western leaders {{to wake up}} to the reality of the situation. She stated [...] "For the {{majority}} of Muslims in the world the Holocaust is not a major historical event they deny; <b>they</b> <b>simply</b> <b>do</b> not know because they were never informed. Worse, most of us are groomed to wish for a Holocaust of Jews." [...] She says that she never learned anything about the Holocaust while she was studying in Saudi Arabia and Kenya. She called for action from charities: [...] "Western and Christian charities in the third world should take it upon themselves to inform Muslims and non-Muslims alike, in the areas where they are active, about the Holocaust." ...|$|E
50|$|Most NCEs fail during drug development, {{either because}} they have {{unacceptable}} toxicity or because <b>they</b> <b>simply</b> <b>do</b> not have the intended effect on the targeted disease as shown in clinical trials.|$|E
50|$|I think submariners fared {{very well}} indeed in the peacetime years; {{not because they}} were submariners, nor in spite of it. <b>They</b> <b>simply</b> <b>did</b> a good job in other assignments.|$|R
50|$|For {{the fifth}} season in 1961-1962, the studio dropped Colbert without notifying him; <b>they</b> <b>simply</b> <b>did</b> not call him back. New Kelly episodes alternated with Garner reruns until {{the series was}} cancelled. The studio {{reversed}} the actors' billing {{at the beginning of}} the show for that last season, with Kelly ahead of Garner.|$|R
50|$|Like {{many cities}} in the early 1960s, {{downtown}} Richmond, Virginia was segregated. In department stores African Americans were allowed to buy clothes, but {{were not allowed to}} try them on or return them. The lunch counters at these department stores were either segregated or <b>they</b> <b>simply</b> <b>did</b> not serve African Americans at all.|$|R
50|$|Researchers {{practicing}} {{non disclosure}} {{are generally not}} concerned with improving security or protecting networks. However, some proponents argue that <b>they</b> <b>simply</b> <b>do</b> not want to assist vendors, and claim no intent to harm others.|$|E
50|$|With {{most of the}} {{community}} and its services either inside of or connected to the building, residents are able to remain inside the building {{for long periods of time}} if the weather is inclement, or <b>they</b> <b>simply</b> <b>do</b> not want to leave.|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} {{broadcasters}} have less airtime, {{due to the}} fact that they are smaller in membership size, or that <b>they</b> <b>simply</b> <b>do</b> not have much interest in broadcasting on 3FM. These are PowNed (Friday afternoons and evenings), EO (Sunday evenings). TROS divides its programming between Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays.|$|E
50|$|At-large berths are not {{necessarily}} lesser teams than automatic berths. <b>They</b> <b>simply</b> <b>did</b> not play well enough {{at the time of}} their conference tournaments. Often, at-large berths will get higher seeds than the teams that beat them in the conference tourney, because the Selection Committee judges base their judgment on the entire season.|$|R
5000|$|Authors such as Raymond Brown {{point out}} that the Gospels {{contradict}} each other in various important respects and on various important details. W. D. Davies and E. P. Sanders state that: [...] "on many points, especially about Jesus’ early life, the evangelists were ignorant … <b>they</b> <b>simply</b> <b>did</b> not know and, guided by rumour, hope or supposition, did the best they could".|$|R
50|$|With {{the advent}} of the Cenozoic, dryolestoids {{declined}} drastically in diversity, with only Peligrotherium being known from the Palaeocene. The exact reasons for this decline aren't clear; most likely <b>they</b> <b>simply</b> <b>did</b> not recover from the K-Pg event. Nonetheless, dryolestoids would continue to survive until the Miocene, from when Necrolestes is known; a gap of 50 million years exists between it and Peligrotherium.|$|R
50|$|The {{history of}} Manchu family names is quite long. Fundamentally, it succeeds the Jurchen family {{name of the}} Jin dynasty. However, after the Mongols {{extinguished}} the Jin dynasty, the Manchus started to adopt Mongol culture, including their custom of using only their given name {{until the end of}} the Qing dynasty, a practice confounding non-Manchus, leading them to conclude, erroneously, that <b>they</b> <b>simply</b> <b>do</b> not have family names.|$|E
5000|$|Will is {{something}} that determines human acts, thoughts etc. It is will what makes man reluctant to toss a coin for something (cf. The Antichrist about Christians: [...] "in point of fact, <b>they</b> <b>simply</b> <b>do</b> what they cannot help doing"). The problem is, whether it is itself ruled? And here two terms which complicate the picture appear: the term [...] "me" [...] and [...] "chance" [...] (i.e. something independent from anything, beyond control).|$|E
5000|$|In {{this case}} the {{adjustment}} is a [...] "sit out". This involves setting up the movement {{as if there were}} an odd number of tables and then running a straight Mitchell. In an 8-1/2 table game, set up 9 tables with boards and assign North-South players to tables 1-8; East-West pairs are assigned to tables 1-9. The movement proceeds exactly as in a straight Mitchell, when East-West pairs arrive at table 9 <b>they</b> <b>simply</b> <b>do</b> not play that round.|$|E
5|$|A {{significant}} number of non-Jewish Poles also did not trust the Germans and decided not to leave the city. Many wounded Home Army soldiers became stranded during the uprising and were simply not able to evacuate in time. For others, the choice to remain resulted from feelings of despair and hopelessness brought {{by the fall of}} the uprising; at least initially, <b>they</b> <b>simply</b> <b>did</b> not have the motivation to leave.|$|R
50|$|Parker J 1981 1 Lloyd’s Rep 476 {{held that}} what was sold was not seed at all and {{did not look at}} the statute. On the basis that clause 1 said 'any seeds or plants sold', he held {{that what was}} sold could not be {{considered}} seeds (because <b>they</b> <b>simply</b> <b>did</b> not work) and therefore the exclusion in clause 2, which was attached to what was sold in clause 1 had no effect.|$|R
5000|$|... 2009 - With 9 seconds remaining, down by 2 (25-23) on 4th and 26, LSU completes a 40-yard {{pass to the}} Ole Miss 6, {{and left}} one second on the clock. However, with no timeouts, <b>they</b> <b>simply</b> <b>did</b> not {{have enough time to}} execute any sort of play as time expired before LSU could even get off a snap. Oddly enough, LSU was {{attempting}} to spike the ball. Ole Miss prevailed for their first win at home against LSU since 1998.|$|R
5000|$|In an {{interview}} in 2012, Chris Rea denied those claims and noted {{that this was a}} classic example of how dangerous the internet can be, while criticising the politicians and government of the UK and EU as remote from the common people. He is sceptical about the idea of unification of Europe because with a common European market [...] "you cannot force different people to live together when <b>they</b> <b>simply</b> <b>do</b> not want to", recalling the downfall of Yugoslavia.|$|E
5000|$|Virtual Iron {{has decided}} against paravirtualization {{in favor of}} [...] "native virtualization." [...] With {{hardware}} advances coming out of Intel and AMD, we see native virtualization capable of matching physical hardware performance {{without any of the}} complexity and engineering efforts involved in paravirtualizing an OS. From our discussions with a broad range of users, <b>they</b> <b>simply</b> <b>do</b> not want to roll out modified OSs unless the trade-off is heavily in their favor. This Faustian trade-off is no longer necessary.|$|E
5000|$|Their {{single state}} is a {{deliberate}} choice on their part, and men are at their feet. Single women have caught up with, and passed, old bachelors {{in the last half}} of the century. I don't think Mr. Howells recognizes this. He is thinking of the time when women of thirty put on caps, and renounced the world. That was because they married at fifteen and sixteen, and at thirty had about a dozen children. Now <b>they</b> <b>simply</b> <b>do</b> not do it.|$|E
25|$|Of {{those who}} accept {{that there are}} inconsistencies, {{scholars}} such as Raymond Brown have examined contradictions in the Gospels, particularly in the infancy narratives of Christ. W. D. Davies and E. P. Sanders claim that: “on many points, especially about Jesus’ early life, the evangelists were ignorant … <b>they</b> <b>simply</b> <b>did</b> not know, and, guided by rumour, hope or supposition, did the best they could”. More critical scholars see the nativity stories either as completely fictional accounts, or at least constructed from traditions that predate the Gospels.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the soldiers who were actually in Glencoe that night, two other detachments, each of four hundred men were, according to the plan, to have converged on the escape routes. Both were late in taking up their positions. It is possible that a snowstorm made arrival on time quite difficult—especially for those approaching over the Devil's Staircase from Kinlochleven; it is equally possible that <b>they</b> <b>simply</b> <b>did</b> not want to play any part in what they knew to be a heinous crime.|$|R

50|$|The {{project will}} take more than 50 years of debates from the Upper Chamber of the Parliament of Northern Ireland from 1921 to 1972, the, and make it {{available}} online. The debates are wide-ranging in nature concerning the socio-economic and political development of a sometimes troubled part of the United Kingdom over a period of dramatic change. The project meets a clear demand amongst scholars in England and Wales for research material relating to the Northern Ireland that <b>they</b> <b>simply</b> <b>do</b> not have access to.|$|E
5000|$|Among {{those who}} do not take the evil eye literally, either by reason of the culture in which they were raised or because <b>they</b> <b>simply</b> <b>do</b> not believe it, the phrase, [...] "to give someone the evil eye" [...] usually means simply to glare at the person in anger or disgust. The term has entered into common usage within the English language. Within the {{broadcasting}} industry it refers to when a presenter signals to the interviewee or co-presenter to stop talking due to a shortage of time.|$|E
5000|$|Epping Forest Constables do not {{routinely}} exercise such {{powers and}} there is nothing to suggest that it is within the scope of their current role to do so. Whilst the Epping Forest Act does not give a specific power to stop and search individuals, it does provide the power to 'examine' (presumably to mean to 'search') vehicles in relation to suspected byelaw offences. [...] As Keepers are neither trained nor equipped to detain individuals, <b>they</b> <b>simply</b> <b>do</b> not exercise that power. The same applies to stop and search.|$|E
5000|$|However, authors such as Raymond Brown have {{presented}} arguments that the Gospels actually contradict {{each other in}} various important respects and on various important details. W. D.

50|$|Historically, the {{statements}} from 6.4 onward were {{ignored by the}} Vienna Circle and the other proponents of logical empiricism, as <b>they</b> <b>simply</b> <b>did</b> {{not know what to}} make of them. Wittgenstein was not present to bolster his case, as he was a schoolteacher and gardener at the moment that Tractatus was published. Afterward, he did not help his case by reciting the pacifist poems of Rabindranath Tagore to them, in place of analytic discussion. Indeed, 6.41 below seems to have a different character from the chain of thought stated above.|$|R
50|$|They {{entered the}} season under new {{management}} with Paul Le Guen having replaced Alex McLeish. The wave of expectation {{that was created}} by Le Guen’s appointment was immense and he quickly went about building his own team. In the summer of 2006 he made eleven signings (of them only Saša Papac would be playing for the club the following season). Le Guen's signings including Filip Šebo, Karl Svensson, Libor Sionko and Lionel Letizi but <b>they</b> <b>simply</b> <b>did</b> not perform, while Jérémy Clément was to be in Glasgow for only six months.|$|R
50|$|This {{does not}} mean that voters make poor and biased decisions: rather that in {{carrying}} out their everyday responsibilities (like working and taking care of a family), many people do not have the time to devote to researching every aspect of a candidate's policies. So many people find themselves making rational decisions meaning they let others who are more versed in the subject do the research and they form their opinion based on the evidence provided. They are being rationally ignorant not because they don't care but because <b>they</b> <b>simply</b> <b>do</b> not have the time.|$|E
50|$|Those {{lymphocytes}} {{that have}} receptors that bind strongly to self-antigens are removed by induction of apoptosis of the autoreactive cells, or by induction of anergy, {{a state of}} non-activity. Weakly autoreactive B cells may also remain {{in a state of}} immunological ignorance where <b>they</b> <b>simply</b> <b>do</b> not respond to stimulation of their B cell receptor. Some weakly self-recognizing T cells are alternatively differentiated into natural regulatory T cells (nTreg cells), which act as sentinels in the periphery to calm down potential instances of T cell autoreactivity (see peripheral tolerance below).|$|E

50|$|Toyota won {{the first}} two {{conferences}} in 1975, beating Crispa both times. Crispa finally sneaked in and clinched the Third Conference in a battle so fierce it got marred by a free-for-all. Once the Redmanizers {{got a taste of}} the championship, however, <b>they</b> <b>simply</b> <b>did</b> not let go. They won all three conferences in 1976, being the first PBA team to win a “grand slam”. They won another two championships in 1977, despite the loss of leading scorer and reigning MVP Adornado to a knee injury {{at the start of the}} year.|$|R
40|$|Are they safe? Many {{employers}} {{are reluctant to}} give job references for fear they will be sued for defamation based upon the information provided. This is because an employer who makes false statements about current or former employees to a prospective employer is subject to potential liability under a defamation theory for the damage caused to the employee by the false statements.

50|$|In January 1984, the Blitz {{tendered}} {{an offer}} {{that would have}} been the largest contract in football ($2 million a year for 3 years) to Bears star running back Walter Payton. Payton promised to consider the offer, but would not be rushed. The Blitz 1984 season was scheduled to start on February 27 and the new ownership had little success selling season tickets. The Blitz needed Payton quickly to help sales, so they put a deadline on the offer of 2/9/84. Before he made up his mind, the Blitz withdrew the offer realizing <b>they</b> <b>simply</b> <b>did</b> not have the finances.|$|R
