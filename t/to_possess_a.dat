5|$|A C-terminal domain (489-561 {{amino acids}} in human EFS) is highly conserved between family members at both primary amino acid {{sequence}} and predicted fold. All CAS proteins except CASS4 contain a YDYVHL motif within this domain, which is an important binding site for the Src SH2 domain. This region is considered <b>to</b> <b>possess</b> <b>a</b> homo- or heterodimerization ability.|$|E
5|$|It {{is thought}} that the vulcanoids would be very rich in {{elements}} with a high melting point, such as iron and nickel. They are unlikely <b>to</b> <b>possess</b> <b>a</b> regolith because such fragmented material heats and cools more rapidly, and is affected more strongly by the Yarkovsky effect, than solid rock. Vulcanoids are probably similar to Mercury in colour and albedo, and may contain material {{left over from the}} earliest stages of the Solar System's formation.|$|E

5|$|Every {{galaxy of}} {{sufficient}} {{mass in the}} Local Group has an associated group of globular clusters, and almost every large galaxy surveyed has been found <b>to</b> <b>possess</b> <b>a</b> system of globular clusters. The Sagittarius Dwarf galaxy and the disputed Canis Major Dwarf galaxy {{appear to be in}} the process of donating their associated globular clusters (such as Palomar 12) to the Milky Way. This demonstrates how many of this galaxy's globular clusters might have been acquired in the past.|$|E
5|$|Ganymede (Jupiter III), {{the third}} Galilean moon {{is named after}} the mythological Ganymede, cupbearer of the Greek gods and Zeus's beloved. Ganymede is the largest natural {{satellite}} in the Solar System at 5262.4 kilometers in diameter, which makes it larger than the planet Mercury – although only at about half of its mass since Ganymede is an icy world. It is the only satellite in the Solar System known <b>to</b> <b>possess</b> <b>a</b> magnetosphere, likely created through convection within the liquid iron core.|$|E
5|$|Like all primates, strepsirrhine orbits (eye sockets) have a postorbital bar, a {{protective}} ring of bone {{created by a}} connection between the frontal and zygomatic bones. Both living and extinct strepsirrhines lack a thin wall of bone behind the eye, referred to as postorbital closure, which is only seen in haplorhine primates. Although the eyes of strepsirrhines point forward, giving stereoscopic vision, the orbits do not face fully forward. Among living strepsirrhines, most or all species are thought <b>to</b> <b>possess</b> <b>a</b> reflective layer behind the retina of the eye, called a tapetum lucidum (consisting of riboflavin crystals), which improves vision in low light, but they lack a fovea, which improves day vision. This differs from tarsiers, which lack a tapetum lucidum but possess a fovea.|$|E

5|$|On 13 July 1965, the {{specification}} for the AFVG {{feasibility study}} was issued; according to Wood, the specification greatly resembled that {{which had been}} earlier issued for the cancelled TSR-2. The AFVG {{was to have a}} maximum speed of 800 knots at sea level and Mach 2.5 at altitude. It was required <b>to</b> <b>possess</b> <b>a</b> minimum combat radium of 500 nautical miles, a ferry range of 3,500 nautical miles, and the nose-mounted airborne interception radar was to have a minimum range of 60 nautical miles. Armanment was to include a pair of 30 mm cannons and a 2,500lb tactical nuclear bomb. However, the specification would be repeatedly re-drafted, the issuing of a definitive specification by Whitehall was delayed until April 1966.|$|E
5|$|One of Morgan's stated {{interests}} was to lead {{a program}} of research into household practices; {{she did not want}} to teach traditional home economics principles if they could not be supported by science. This meant that her students were required <b>to</b> <b>possess</b> <b>a</b> science background that was more stringent than other U.S. home economics programs. Consequently, her graduates found themselves prepared for roles that had not usually been open to traditional home economics graduates, such as hospital nutrition management and teaching in the basic sciences.|$|E
5|$|SCE Cambridge {{wanted the}} game <b>to</b> <b>possess</b> <b>a</b> unique lead character, thus Sorrell worked with script doctor Martin Pond whilst {{creating}} an expansive backstory {{for the lead}} protagonist, Sir Daniel Fortesque. Pond {{came up with the}} idea that Sir Daniel could have been a pompous failure in life whose reincarnation was his one shot at redemption. This idea, along with the player-character's unusual appearance, turned appealing to some sectors of the gaming community, as lead designer Wilson later recalled that female gamers considered Sir Daniel to be endearing, and was considered a sex symbol in France.|$|E

5|$|The babies {{discover}} a tiny lizard in Tommy Pickles' backyard {{that they are}} convinced is the offspring of Reptar, a fictitious green dinosaur and main character of many action movies of which the Rugrats are fond. After learning about the extinction of the dinosaurs, Tommy decides to return the lizard to Reptar just as his family has purchased tickets for a musical ice show based on the character. After Tommy's parents and grandfather have fallen asleep, the babies sneak into the ice rink and present the lizard to Leo, the actor portraying Reptar, who coincidentally happens <b>to</b> <b>possess</b> <b>a</b> phobia of lizards. Stu Pickles, Tommy's father, sees the rugrats and must retrieve them from the ice rink.|$|E
5|$|The {{evolution}} of TBR1 {{has been studied}} in amphioxi, also known as lancelets. A T-box-containing cDNA was isolated in the lancelet Branchiostoma belcheri and found <b>to</b> <b>possess</b> <b>a</b> T-domain orthologous {{to that of the}} T-Brain subfamily of T-box genes, specifically TBR1. However, lancelets lack a true brain and no TBR1 transcripts were found in the neural tissue of the lancelet. This suggests that the neuronal role of TBR1 evolved in vertebrates after the lancelet lineage had already diverged from that of vertebrates.|$|E

5|$|A {{new system}} of {{controlling}} {{the movement of the}} First Nations was introduced by the government after the rebellion. Known as the pass system, this required any individual leaving a reserve <b>to</b> <b>possess</b> <b>a</b> pass signed by a government agent, or to face arrest by the police. The police received advice that the new policy was illegal, as it contravened Treaty 7, which had given guarantees of free movement, but they continued to enforce it for several years. Eventually the force turned to the vagrancy laws as an alternative approach for removing First Nations from selected areas. Police used agents employed to collect intelligence from within First Nation and Métis communities, and, from 1887, they also employed members of the First Nations as special constables, typically deploying them as scouts and trackers. These scouts wore an informal uniform and were empowered to arrest other members of their communities, but not whites.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{detailed}} analysis of KBOs was impossible, and so astronomers were only able to determine the most basic facts about their makeup, primarily their color. These first data showed {{a broad range of}} colors among KBOs, ranging from neutral grey to deep red. This suggested that their surfaces were composed {{of a wide range of}} compounds, from dirty ices to hydrocarbons. This diversity was startling, as astronomers had expected KBOs to be uniformly dark, having lost most of the volatile ices from their surfaces to the effects of cosmic rays. Various solutions were suggested for this discrepancy, including resurfacing by impacts or outgassing. Jewitt and Luu's spectral analysis of the known Kuiper belt objects in 2001 found that the variation in color was too extreme to be easily explained by random impacts. The radiation from the Sun is thought to have chemically altered methane on the surface of KBOs, producing products such as tholins. Makemake has been shown <b>to</b> <b>possess</b> <b>a</b> number of hydrocarbons derived from the radiation-processing of methane, including ethane, ethylene and acetylene.|$|E
5|$|Sedna has a V-band {{absolute}} magnitude (H) of about 1.8, {{and it is}} estimated to have an albedo of about 0.32, thus giving it a diameter of approximately 1,000km. At {{the time of its}} discovery it was the intrinsically brightest object found in the Solar System since Pluto in 1930. In 2004, the discoverers placed an upper limit of 1,800km on its diameter, but by 2007 this was revised downward to less than 1,600km after observation by the Spitzer Space Telescope. In 2012, measurements from the Herschel Space Observatory suggested that Sedna's diameter was , which would make it smaller than Pluto's moon Charon. Because Sedna has no known moons, determining its mass is currently impossible without sending a space probe. Sedna is currently the largest trans-Neptunian Sun-orbiting object not known <b>to</b> <b>possess</b> <b>a</b> satellite.|$|E

5|$|The newly {{appointed}} commander of this troubled fleet was Villaret de Joyeuse; although formerly in a junior position, {{he was known}} <b>to</b> <b>possess</b> <b>a</b> high degree of tactical ability; he had trained under Admiral Pierre André de Suffren in the Indian Ocean during the American war. However, Villaret's attempts to mould his new officer corps into an effective fighting unit were hampered by another new appointee, a deputy of the National Convention named Jean-Bon Saint-André. Saint-André's job was to report directly to the National Convention on the revolutionary ardour of both the fleet and its admiral. He frequently intervened in strategic planning and tactical operations. Shortly after his arrival, Saint-André proposed issuing a decree ordering that any officer deemed to have shown insufficient zeal in defending his ship in action should {{be put to death}} on his return to France, although this highly controversial legislation {{does not appear to have}} ever been acted upon. Although his interference was a source of frustration for Villaret, Saint-André's dispatches to Paris were published regularly in Le Moniteur, and did much to popularise the Navy in France.|$|E
5|$|The poorer {{people were}} also {{alarmed by the}} {{contagion}} and some left the city, {{but it was not}} easy for them to abandon their accommodation and livelihoods for an uncertain future elsewhere. Before exiting through the city gates, they were required <b>to</b> <b>possess</b> <b>a</b> certificate of good health signed by the Lord Mayor and these became increasingly difficult to obtain. As time went by and the numbers of plague victims rose, people living in the villages outside London began to resent this exodus and were no longer prepared to accept townsfolk from London, with or without a certificate. The refugees were turned back, were not allowed to pass through towns and had to travel across country, and were forced to live rough on what they could steal or scavenge from the fields. Many died in wretched circumstances of starvation and thirst in the hot summer that was to follow.|$|E
5|$|This {{article focuses}} on {{matrices}} whose entries are real or complex numbers. However, matrices can be considered with much more general types of entries than real or complex numbers. As a first step of generalization, any field, that is, a set where addition, subtraction, multiplication and division operations are defined and well-behaved, may be used instead of R or C, for example rational numbers or finite fields. For example, coding theory makes use of matrices over finite fields. Wherever eigenvalues are considered, as these are roots of a polynomial they may exist only in a larger field {{than that of the}} entries of the matrix; for instance they may be complex in case of a matrix with real entries. The possibility to reinterpret the entries of a matrix as elements of a larger field (for example, to view a real matrix as a complex matrix whose entries happen to be all real) then allows considering each square matrix <b>to</b> <b>possess</b> <b>a</b> full set of eigenvalues. Alternatively one can consider only matrices with entries in an algebraically closed field, such as C, from the outset.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIt {{is known}} that a graded lattice of rank n is supersolvable {{if and only if}} it has an EL-{{labelling}} where the labels along any maximal chain are exactly the numbers 1, 2,…,n without repetition. These labellings are called Sn EL-labellings, and having such a labelling is also equivalent <b>to</b> <b>possessing</b> <b>a</b> maximal chain of left modular elements. In the case of an ungraded lattice, there is a natural extension of Sn EL-labellings, called interpolating labellings. We show that admitting an interpolating labelling is again equivalent <b>to</b> <b>possessing</b> <b>a</b> maximal chain of left modular elements. Furthermore, we work in the setting of an arbitrary bounded poset as all the above results generalize to this case...|$|R
