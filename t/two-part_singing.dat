Music critic Richie Unterberger views it as [...] "a love lament for a grieving girl that was perhaps more morose than any previous Beatles song".

McCartney recalled: [...] "'Baby's in Black' we did because we liked waltz-time... And I think also John and I {{wanted to do something}} bluesy, a bit darker, more grown-up, rather than just straight pop." [...] Beatles historian Mark Lewisohn cites the band's dedication to achieving a discordant twanging sound for Harrison's lead guitar part, and Martin's objection to the song opening with this sound, {{as an example of the}} Beatles breaking free of their producer's control for the first time. To achieve the desired swelling effect, Lennon knelt on the studio floor and altered the volume control on Harrison's Gretsch as he played.|$|R
50|$|After his Third Symphony of 1976, Górecki was {{to embrace}} smaller-scale musical forms, such as short unaccompanied choral works (e.g. Broad Waters, Op. 39, his Five Marian songs, Op. 54) and chamber works; Miserere {{was to be}} the only {{large-scale}} work within the 1980s, reminiscent of his 2nd and 3rd symphonies in compositional scale and performer numbers. At the same time, his music became both harmonically and melodically simpler in his writing than his previous serial compositions. Three primary musical influences also became apparent in his compositional style: Polish folksong, Catholic chant and the Polish music of the past, primarily the works of Karol Szymanowski. Out of these influences evolved two compositional kernels in Górecki’s music: Górecki’s “motto” motif (a rise of a minor third, usually on the first three pitches of the Aeolian or Dorian scales); and the “Skierkowski turn” (the Górecki motto followed by a descending half-step) named for the Polish folk music collector who influenced the music of Karol Szymanowski. Górecki’s motto and turn are essential motivic elements in the Miserere. In fact, the very first notes of the work are the motto and turn in A Aeolian (pitches A-B-C-B) sung in unison by the Bass II’s. There is also an abundance of sacred musical influence at play in the Miserere. The monodic opening is based on traditional Polish chant. The following two-part section with the added Bass I reflects the <b>two-part</b> sacred <b>singing</b> common in Polish religious services. The repetitive nature of each of the simple melodies is yet another example of chant influence. Finally, Górecki’s indication for a minimum of 120 singers in the chorus evokes the sound of congregational singing.|$|R

Further along the Dalmatian hinterland there are various traditional vocal styles of Ojkanje singing. In Ravni Kotari and Bukovica, the local style of singing is called orzenje (the Serbian Orthodox population calls it orcenje, orcanje or groktanje). Furthermore, when performed by men, the singing is known as treskavica, or starovinsko ("old-style") today, and when performed by women it is known as vojkavica. Treskavica is also used in the hinterlands of Trogir and Kaštela, but is called grgešanje in , a village north of Primošten. In northern Poljice the locals continue to perform the kiridžijsko style of singing.|$|E
40|$|This {{study focused}} on the {{functions}} of Igoru music in Okpe land. It also examined the compositional techniques of the music typology. The primary source for data collection was oral interview. Secondary sources include publications, and records. Unstructured research questions formed basis for the study. The texts of eighty seven (87) songs were transcribed and translated for this study. Fifty songs from this sample were further transcribed in staff notation, for analysis and discussion. At {{the end of the}} study, the following findings were made: Igoru musicians, in their foresight, investigate, evaluate, probe, counsel, warn, and foretell future events in Okpe, to avoid painful experiences, since in traditional Okpe society, life experiences are shared. Most of the themes in Igoru music are derived from the sense of realism than idealism. The songs being quite topical had to be realistic than idealistic in tendency. Various sound and speech elements are put together to make communication effective. Igoru music praises and commends deserving members, in order to encourage those who are doing well in the society to continue in their good deeds, as well as stimulate others to emulate them. The musicians defend their political system, their territorial land mass, traditional religion and themselves from various attacks. Igoru music represents the Okpe identity, thus it was selected amongst other music typologies of the culture to represent it, both in social and political-oriented activities in Lagos and elsewhere. Igoru music uses the hexatonic scale system. Almost all the songs were found to be composed in compound quadruple metre. The performers involve in <b>two-part</b> polyphonic <b>singing.</b> Consecutive parallel 3 rds, 4 ths, and 5 ths are prevalent and melodic cadences resolve upwards than downwards.

40|$|Located at {{the southernmost}} part of Kosovo and Metohija, {{on the slopes}} of the Sharr Mountains, Gora {{represents}} a place once inhabited by the Serbian Orthodox population, who converted to Islam under the Turkish occupation of the Balkans. The faith conversion began in the 16 th and ended in the 19 th century, at which point there had still been some remains of Orthodox churches left on the territory of Gora. The acceptance of the new religion and other values passed on by the Ottoman Empire brought about changes in terms of identity, so, nowadays, inhabitants identify themselves as the Goranci/Gorani people. To this very day, their cultural matrix reflects a combination of musical creations which probably preceded the change of religion as well as those variations established by the Turkish domination. These phenomena can be tracked on the level of both their context and the musical text. The Gorani celebrate Christian holidays (Christmas and St George’s Day), and keep those holidays that are part of Islamic practice (Sunnah and Bayram). As an example of an older, traditional manner of musical expression, the two-part “aloud” (na glas) singing has a dominant second interval in a narrow tonal ambitus and a free metro-rhythmical organization. This form of singing is usually shaped into octosyllable and it is characterized by text improvisation which happens simultaneously with a certain action. Its interpretation is associated with St George’s Day, wedding, Sunnah, and other holidays. Songs that accompany the dance are sung in a heterophonic manner or in unison, accompanied by the tambourine (emic term: daire or def). Unlike the <b>two-part</b> “aloud” <b>singing,</b> performing the songs in unison with the tambourine and dance has wider tonal systems with a periodical case of an excessive second. However, the very emergence of numerous instruments such as the tambourine, kaval, tambura and zurla, shows a considerable Turkish-Eastern influence. This influence is especially noticeable in the Romani “musicking” using zurla, which typically involves a combination of traditional music of different nations, predominantly Turkish and Albanian. Turkish influence tied to instrumental music was conveyed to the vocal singing, particularly to singing songs together with using the tambourine while dancing, as well as to singing to the accompaniment of the tambura. Within these modes of musical performance, asymmetrical rhythms are used, along with the augmented second, which ethnomusicological literature often cites as an element of Oriental culture. By overviewing the Gorani musical practice and the “otherness” in diachrony, it is evident that what was known as otherness in the past now represents {{an integral part of the}} identity. The practices established before Islam, as well as those brought by this religion, are manifested in terms of context and text. It is obvious that the Gorani people have created their own musical uniqueness throughout the centuries of cultural turmoil. [Projekat Ministarstva nauke Republike Srbije, br. 177024...|$|R
40|$|Folk music, as {{understood}} by the present author, includes all those musical phenomena which circulate {{among the members of}} relatively small human communities in direct communication. They are musical phenomena which people freely choose, adopt, perform and transmit to others. This approach defines folk music primarily in terms of its existence and only secondarily in terms of its musical and extramusical characteristics and contents. Three researchers worked with the author in collecting materials for this study. Dušan Dean of Zlarin recorded the texts of many songs and various other data about music (all kinds, not just folk music) on Zlarin. Ivo Furčić of Šibenik gave his permission for 17 of his folk music recordings (published in his book Narodno stvaralaštvo šibenskog područja, I - Šibensko otočje/The Folklore of the Šibenlk Region, I - The Šibenik Islands /, Šibenik, 1980) to be Included in the present study. Such recordings are marked »Furčić« here, while all the other recordings have been transcribed by the author and these remain unmarked. Zorica Rajković, Research Assistant at the Institute for Folklore Studies in Zagreb, gave her permission to the author to transcribe nine examples of children 2 ̆ 7 s metro rhythmic rhymes and songs from her material. The collected and transcribed material (6 Gc, or 72, musical examples) is grouped according to three main criteria: (a) place and role of singing, and music generally {{in the life of the}} Zlarinians, (b) textual content of the songs, (c) musical characteristics of the tape-recorded material. The first group includes lullabies (examples 1 - 8, two of them Italian for purposes of comparison - one from Zlarin, ex. 7, and one from Buje in Istria, ex. 8). The lullabies are transcribed in full, that is, as much as the women whose singing was recorded actually sang. This approach clearly reveals examples of quite a free musical form (ex. 1) and those with formally fixed melody-stanzas (ex. 5). The tonal relations of the narrow intervals and tones with the changing pitch are found in ex. 1; ex. 6 shows a clear diatonic scale. The metrorhythmic foundation of the rockmg of the cradle may be quite different and totally independent of the metrorhythmic foundation of the text which is being sung (ex. 2). Examples 9 - 13 are wedding songs. Memories of small-range tunes with the refrain on the lengthened syllables oj, e - e - oj are still alive (ex. 9). The wedding songs from the mid-twentieth century, including the seventies, are mainly performed as two-part songs in the major key (ex. 13). Over the last twenty years, funeral dirges and wailing songs have all but disappeared. The transcribed examples (14 - 17) al 2 ̆ 7 e given in full, so that the interested readers can clearly see the intonational and formal freedom in the performance of wailing songs. It used to be the custom among the Zlarin women to wail for a deceased person in the house or in the field, sometimes even several years after his death. This fact made the recording for the present study all the more realistic, as it was not necessary to ask them to sing without being in the right mood. As soon as the conversation turned towards their departed members of the family, the bereaved women would begin to wail spontaneously. In example 17, the wailer 2 ̆ 7 s frequent sobs (marked with asterisks) ended in her crying when the wailing song was over, and the women who had listened to her song also burst into tears. As for other types of songs, only carolers 2 ̆ 7 songs (exx. 18 a- 22) still survive as part of a folk custom. Carolers (known as kolojani) visit houses in the village round Christmas and the New Year 2 ̆ 7 s Day and <b>sing</b> <b>two-part,</b> sometimes three-part, songs of more recent origin. One-part and two-part tunes of narrative songs are divided into two groups according to their musical characteristics: (a) in tonal relations of diatonic tetra- and pentachordal sequences - 148 exx. 23 - 28, such as a long narrative poem about Prince Marko (ex. 23), or a more recent and shorter narrative poem (ex. 28); (b) In the major key - exx. 29 - 32. The examples of love songs are also divided into two groups, based on the same musical characteristics as the narrative songs - diatonic tonal relations (exx. 35 a- 36) and the major key (exx. 37 - 42). There are considerable differences in tonal relations among the selected examples. Examples 33 a and 33 b illustrate the so-called clucking sounds made in tunes known as kocavice in Zlarin. In the second group of love songs, three-part tunes in the major key are found alongside two-part tunes, with the chords clearly marking the functions of the tonic, the dominant and the subdominant (ex. 40). One of the songs in this group is »Ponoć bije, ja nemam sna« (Midnight is Striking, and I Cannot Sleep, ex. 42), which the Zlarin girls sang as one of their popular songs. It was only later that the author learned that this was in fact a composed song (»Puste su kale« by Duško Šarac, F avorit - Note popularnih melodija, Zagreb, 1975, pp. 22 - 23; also on the gramophone record, SUZY, Zagreb, SP 1106). There are very few differences between the song of the Zlarin girls and Šarac 2 ̆ 7 s song (ex. 42 is the transcription of the song sung by the Zlarin girls). Songs that accompany dancing are more recent two-part tunes, parallel thirds in the major key (exx. 45 and 46). This group includes also an adopted and subsequently adapted tune from northern Croatia (ex. 43), as well as an unadapted tune from northern and eastern Croatia (ex. 44). Of the two Partizan tunes, the first is a three-part tune (ex. 47) accompanying the well-known Kozara reel-dance with couplets describing events from the 1941 - 1945 Liberation War and from the period of postwar reconstruction. Quite a number of examples are children 2 ̆ 7 s metro rhythmic songs and rhymes. Songs which accompany children 2 ̆ 7 s games are given in examples 49 - 53. It Is noteworthy that there are some narrow intervals and tones of changing pitch in these songs. Examples 54 - 61 are counting-out rhymes, known as razbrajalice in Zlarin. The last group includes the following songs: a narrative legend (ex. 62), a partly sung prayer for protection against lightning (ex. 63), then church songs, two songs in connection with the custom of evening prayer for three consecutive days in the house of a deceased person (exx. 66 a, 66 b; 66 c compares these songs with the well-known Latin Dies irae), and four tunes for two paraliturgical songs (the first is the well-known Our Lady 2 ̆ 7 s Lament, exx. 64 a and G 4 b). The examples are supplemented by summary tables of metrorhythmic patterns of musical sequences and metrorhythmic patterns of children 2 ̆ 7 s game songs and counting-out rhymes. As for instrumental music, only textual data are given without musical examples...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} two {{different}} styles of rural folk singing in Southeastern Serbia which coexisted in the repertoire of a particular folk group.

40|$|Instruments and {{instrumental}} music {{are not only}} a significant area of the people’s musical art but are also artifacts of the material culture of the nation. That {{is why it is}} impossible to study folk musical instruments without taking into consideration the common cultural-historical processes. Development of instrumental polyphony is mainly connected with vocal cul-ture; hence it is impossible to discuss it without vocal traditions. This interrelation-ship is sometimes paradoxical. In a number of polyphonic cultures little is known about instrumental polyphony and vice versa. In some countries with a highly devel-oped instrumental polyphonic culture there is no trace even of elements of <b>two-part</b> <b>singing.</b> What is this? Could this be a kind of compensation?

40|$|A {{substantial}} part of the Slovenian ethnic territory belongs to the alpine geographic region and part singing, namely in the homophonic manner, is characteristic {{for most of the}} area. Subsequently, distinctive soundscapes have formed in the regions of Carinthia, Styria and in central Slovenia. Within these regions different numbers of parts, different ways of leading, singing and different singing colours occur 1. In a group of singers the singing can be in three-part, or also in four-, five- or six-part. <b>Two-part</b> <b>singing</b> is typical only of groups in the eastern parts of Slovenia bordering on Hungary and in this way Slovenian alpine tradition blends with the Pannonian. The most general and widespread example of folk part singing is represented by the part which takes the lead (naprej), the higher accompanying voice (èez) in the parallel thirds (or sixths), beneath both of these parts there is the bass (bas), which accompanies the melody with the base note of tonic and dominant chords, some-times also with the subdominant chord, however, in cadence the bass interval steps are mostly filled by passing and changing notes (ex. 1, audio ex. 1).
