5|$|Yoshiki's songwriting {{process is}} unusual in that he writes scores for everything, {{including}} guitar and drums, before beginning to play it with the band. Although changes are made if necessary. His composing style <b>tends</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> use of chords in sequences of eights or more with riff-based motifs or call-and-response style phrasing. He has maintained this style {{for the majority of}} his career as a composer. Having played classical piano since he was four years old, Yoshiki claims to be as influenced by classical music as he is by rock. While also serving as the main songwriter Yoshiki has production credit on much of X Japan's later material. During live performances the band relies, for the most part, on its members (with drummer and pianist Yoshiki and guitarist and violinist Sugizo switching between their instruments) and prerecorded tracks for orchestrated strings, spoken word passages, and more recently, some of hide's guitar parts.|$|E
5|$|In a {{prototype}} from the series, Alphonse's soul was sealed in a flying squirrel instead of armor {{as a result}} of human transmutation. He appeared as the father to the other protagonist, Edward, in their searching for a way to recover their bodies. To match the designs from the manga magazine Monthly Shōnen Gangan, the two characters were redesigned. Alphonse was given a huge suit of armor to contrast him with Edward's short stature. Since Alphonse mostly appears with his armor, Arakawa <b>tends</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> sketches of his human form so that she would not forget how to draw him. Some events from the Elrics' lives are social problems she integrated into the plot. Their journey across the country to help people is meant to gain an understanding of the meaning of family. As Alphonse is mostly seen with his armor, during various chapters from the manga Arakawa was unable to draw him crying. During Chapter 40, Arakawa saw his conversation with Edward as a way to let him express his feeling and to make him appear as though he is crying. When comparing the two brothers during the time Alphonse obtained the ability to use alchemy without a circle like Edward, Arakawa stated nobody was better at alchemy as the two had different preferences {{in the same way as}} other alchemists appearing in the series. When making omakes, Arakawa tends to draw Alphonse doing something comical to contrast him with the other characters. She states that she does it because Alphonse may enjoy making fun of other people.|$|E

Finally, symmetry makes possible the interpretation of whole scenes.|$|E
25|$|In {{terms of}} tennis {{strategy}} Halep is an aggressive counterpuncher.

Ohno portrayed Shinigami-kun (Shinigami No.413) {{whose job is to}} pronounce death to expected people and take their souls to the spiritual world. As a rookie reaper, he <b>tends</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> biased decisions towards the human side which always causes him to be reprimanded by his boss.|$|E
25|$|The {{cost factor}} <b>tends</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> {{cremation}} attractive. Generally speaking, cremation is cheaper than a traditional burial service, especially if direct cremation is chosen, {{in which the}} body is cremated as soon as legally possible without any sort of services. However, for some even cremation is still relatively expensive, especially {{as a lot of}} fuel is required to perform it. Methods to reduce fuel consumption/fuel cost include the use of different fuels (i.e. natural gas or propane, compared to wood) and by using an incinerator (retort) (closed cabin) rather than an open fire.|$|E
25|$|Darin Barney {{has written}} about technology's impact on {{practices}} of citizenship and democratic culture, suggesting that technology can be construed as (1) an object of political debate, (2) a means or medium of discussion, and (3) a setting for democratic deliberation and citizenship. As a setting for democratic culture, Barney suggests that technology <b>tends</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> ethical questions, including {{the question of what}} a good life consists in, nearly impossible, because they already give an answer to the question: a good life is one that includes the use of more and more technology.|$|E

25|$|For {{very large}} heat sinks, {{there is no}} {{substitute}} for the threaded standoff and compression spring attachment method. A threaded standoff is essentially a hollow metal tube with internal threads. One end is secured with a screw through a hole in the PCB. The other end accepts a screw which compresses the spring, completing the assembly. A typical heat sink assembly uses two to four standoffs, which <b>tends</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> this the most costly heat sink attachment design. Another disadvantage is the need for holes in the PCB.|$|E
25|$|There are no clearly Classic Mississippian culture pottery {{found in}} West Virginia. The nearest pure Mississippian archeological site is located near Evansville, Indiana, {{just below the}} Louisville Falls, {{according}} to several regional societies, particularly referencing the Ohio Historical Society observations. These refined definitions {{are based on the}} latest modern tools and field science within the region, which <b>tends</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> obsolete the publications of earlier decades, based on older work from neighboring regions. Within the greater Mississippi Culture, the Plaquemine culture used shell for tempering on their round vessels with some having narrow necks that were engraved after firing as early as 700 CE.|$|E
25|$|This {{is not to}} {{say that}} common law is better in every situation. For example, civil law can be clearer than case law when the {{legislature}} has had the foresight and diligence to address the precise set of facts applicable to a particular situation. For that reason, civil law statutes tend to be somewhat more detailed than statutes written by common law legislatures—but, conversely, that <b>tends</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the statute more difficult to read (the United States tax code is an example). Nonetheless, as a practical matter, no civil law legislature can ever address the full spectrum of factual possibilities in the breadth, depth and detail of the case law of the common law courts of even a smaller jurisdiction, and that deeper, more complete body of law provides additional predictability that promotes commerce.|$|E

25|$|Generally {{speaking}} partial dentures {{tend to be}} held {{in place}} by the presence of the remaining natural teeth and complete dentures tend to rely on muscular co-ordination and suction to stay in place. The maxilla very commonly has more favorable denture bearing anatomy as the ridge tends to be well formed and there is a larger area on the palate for suction to retain the denture. Conversely, the mandible <b>tends</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> lower dentures less retentive due to the displacing presence of the tongue and the higher rate of resorption, frequently leading to significantly resorbed lower ridges. Disto-lingual regions tend to offer retention even in highly resorbed mandibles, and extension of the flange into these regions tends to produce a more retentive lower denture. An implant supported lower denture is another option.|$|E
25|$|Noelle is a brown-haired {{young woman}} who {{initially}} serves as 'leader' of the girls in Billings House. Fiercely loyal to her friends, she is the implied counterpart to Reed, being similarly skilled in lacrosse and soccer, and apparently coming from a shaken family of her own. However, her privileged upbringing <b>tends</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> her blunt and sometimes insensitive, as she enjoys intimidating other {{students as well as}} the Easton staff. She is shown to be overly self-confident to the point of arrogance, but very intelligent. According to some of her peers, she cannot live without drama in her life. Noelle possesses a long, red scar along her stomach, just above her hipbone from a childhood horseback riding accident. She has an unstable longtime romantic relationship with another senior named Dash McCafferty. As the series progresses, Noelle becomes Reed's best friend and ally. Later in the series, facts about Noelle's family are revealed and it is discovered that Noelle is Reed's paternal half-sister.|$|E
25|$|Mechanical inertia is {{the basis}} of this storage method. When the {{electric}} power flows into the device, an electric motor accelerates a heavy rotating disc. The motor acts as a generator when the flow of power is reversed, slowing down the disc and producing electricity. Electricity is stored as the kinetic energy of the disc. Friction must be kept to a minimum to prolong the storage time. This is often achieved by placing the flywheel in a vacuum and using magnetic bearings, tending to make the method expensive. Greater flywheel speeds allow greater storage capacity but require strong materials such as steel or composite materials to resist the centrifugal forces. The ranges of power and energy storage technology that make this method economic, however, <b>tends</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> flywheels unsuitable for general power system application; they are probably best suited to load-leveling applications on railway power systems and for improving power quality in renewable energy systems such as the 20MW system in Ireland.|$|E
