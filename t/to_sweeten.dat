5|$|Sugar cubes (sometimes called sugar lumps) {{are white}} or brown {{granulated}} sugars lightly steamed and pressed together in block shape. They are used <b>to</b> <b>sweeten</b> drinks.|$|E
5|$|Granulated sugars {{are used}} at the table, to {{sprinkle}} on foods and <b>to</b> <b>sweeten</b> hot drinks (coffee and tea), and in home baking to add sweetness and texture to baked products (cookies and cakes) and desserts (pudding and ice cream). They are also used as a preservative to prevent micro-organisms from growing and perishable food from spoiling, as in candied fruits, jams, and marmalades.|$|E
5|$|Władysław's second wife, Anna of Celje, {{had died}} in 1416, leaving a daughter, Jadwiga. In 1417, Władysław married Elisabeth of Pilica, who died in 1420 without bearing him a child, and two years later, Sophia of Halshany, who bore him two {{surviving}} sons. The death in 1431 of his daughter Jadwiga, the last heir of Piast blood, released Władysław to make his sons by Sophia of Halshany his heirs, though he had <b>to</b> <b>sweeten</b> the Polish nobles with concessions to ensure their agreement, since the monarchy was elective.|$|E

5000|$|In the Philippines, the youtiao {{is called}} bicho (pl. bicho-bicho) {{although}} this name can also refer <b>to</b> <b>sweetened,</b> fried dough balls {{similar to the}} buñuelo, also called cascaron.

5|$|The {{stems and}} fleshy {{rhizomes}} of C.australis {{are high in}} natural sugars and were steam-cooked in earth ovens (umu tī, a large type of hāngi) to produce kāuru, a carbohydrate-rich food used <b>to</b> <b>sweeten</b> other foods. The growing tips or leaf hearts were stripped of leaves and eaten raw or cooked as a vegetable, when they were called kōuka—the origin of the Māori name of the tree. The southern limit of kūmara (sweet potato) cultivation was at Banks Peninsula at 43°S, and south of there a culture developed around C.australis. Natural and planted groves of the cabbage tree were harvested.|$|E

50|$|In Thailand, most commonly, roselle is {{prepared}} {{as a cold}} beverage, heavily sweetened and poured over ice, similar <b>to</b> <b>sweetened</b> fruit juices. Plastic bags filled with ice and sweetened 'grajeab' can be found outside of most schools and in local markets. Roselle is also drunk as a tea, believed to reduce cholesterol.|$|R
5000|$|The Chantilly cake is a {{delicacy}} in Hawaii, {{dating back}} to the 1950s. Usually, Chantilly cakes are chocolate cakes with a Chantilly frosting, which is essentially the coconut frosting from a German chocolate cake without the coconut. [...] This is in contrast to the typical usage of creme Chantilly, which refers <b>to</b> <b>sweetened</b> whipped cream.|$|R
50|$|Fried flower cakes are {{soaked in}} honey <b>to</b> be <b>sweetened,</b> and {{sprinkled}} with cinnamon powder.|$|R
25|$|James Mease {{published}} another recipe in 1812. In 1824, a ketchup recipe using tomatoes {{appeared in}} The Virginia Housewife (an influential 19th-century cookbook written by Mary Randolph, Thomas Jefferson's cousin). American cooks also began <b>to</b> <b>sweeten</b> ketchup in the 19th century.|$|E
25|$|Most of the time, kiriya, kurakkan kenda, sawu kenda, pol kiri kenda and kitul piti kenda {{are used}} as sweets. Sugar, candy, dates, raisins, cashew nut, jaggery, and treacle are among the {{ingredients}} that may be added <b>to</b> <b>sweeten</b> these congees.|$|E

50|$|To refer <b>to</b> a <b>sweetened,</b> flavored, carbonated soft drink, {{the term}} soda is {{preferred}} (rather than pop or the generic coke).|$|R
25|$|The flavour of {{the final}} product may be {{adjusted}} by adding honey <b>to</b> <b>sweeten</b> the mead, addition of herbs and spices or ethanol of agricultural origin. Bottling takes place at a temperature of 18–25 °C. Traditional carboys, ceramic bottles or oak barrels are typically used.|$|E
25|$|In the 19th century Champagne was noticeably {{sweeter than}} the Champagnes of today. The trend towards drier Champagne began when Perrier-Jouët decided not <b>to</b> <b>sweeten</b> his 1846 vintage prior to {{exporting}} it to London. The designation Brut Champagne {{was created for}} the British in 1876.|$|E
25|$|From {{the early}} stages, the cocoa was {{sweetened}} with sugar cane, which the Spanish {{were the first to}} popularise in Europe. In pre-Columbus America chocolate was flavored with peppers and was a mixture of both bitter and spicy flavours. This made it an acquired taste and limited its appeal to the Spanish conquistadors, who were soon encouraged <b>to</b> <b>sweeten</b> it with sugar brought from the Iberian Peninsula in addition to heating it.|$|E
50|$|Sprite Green: Announced December 17, 2008, Sprite Green was <b>to</b> be <b>sweetened</b> with Truvia (a natural zero-calorie {{sweetener}} {{made from}} stevia).|$|R
50|$|An unusual {{side effect}} of the rural purge was the {{diminution}} of the laugh track. Most of the rural-oriented programs were filmed in the single-camera setup without a studio audience, with the canned laughter added by laugh-track proprietor Charley Douglass. The newer shows that came to television in the early 1970s were multiple-camera setups with live studio audiences, a trend that would become the norm throughout the 1970s and 1980s, with Douglass's laugh track mostly limited <b>to</b> <b>sweetening.</b>|$|R
50|$|Wine yeast {{is added}} <b>to</b> cooled, <b>sweetened</b> banana juice {{and placed in}} plastic {{fermentation}} tanks for 15 to 20 days, depending on product.|$|R
25|$|The city of Cádiz {{was first}} founded {{sometime}} between 1104 BC and the 9th century BC as a trading post by the Canaanite tribe of the Phoenicians. The Phoenicians {{shared in the}} winemaking traditions of the Ancient Middle East and likely brought grapevines with them as they established their settlement. The Greeks soon followed and brought with them the tradition of making arrope, a dark colored sweet syrup made from unfermented grape juice {{that could be used}} <b>to</b> <b>sweeten</b> wine.|$|E
25|$|The first {{squadron}} of 20 F-35 jets {{from the first}} production series would only include a few Israeli-made systems. The United States, meanwhile, has agreed that if Israel buys more F-35 squadrons from later production series, the installation of more Israeli-made systems will be allowed. <b>To</b> <b>sweeten</b> the deal, Lockheed Martin said it would buy parts and systems for the F-35 from Israeli companies {{at a cost of}} $4 billion. The aircraft will be designated F-35I, as there will be unique Israeli features installed in them.|$|E
25|$|Heavy metal {{contamination}} {{is thought}} to be a contributing factor in Beethoven's death as these were commonly used in medicines of the time. It has also been theorized that he consumed large amounts of lead from illegally fortified wine. Putting lead sugar into wine was a very common practice <b>to</b> <b>sweeten</b> cheap wines, and despite being outlawed in most European countries during the 18th century, the prohibition was difficult to enforce and production of lead-fortified wine (which originated in Roman times) continued unabated. There is no indication the composer had syphilis beyond a mercury treatment prescribed to him around 1815, but these were used for various other ailments as well.|$|E

6000|$|... "Swept! Brooms and Van Tromp! Thou hast {{swept the}} {{pavilion}} of my niece of its mistress, {{no less than}} my purse of its johannes. This is carrying a little innocent barter into a most forbidden commerce, and I hope the joke is to end, before the affair gets <b>to</b> be <b>sweetening</b> <b>to</b> the tea of the Province gossips. Such a tale would affect the autumn importation of sugars!" ...|$|R
5000|$|Because sugar {{was yet to}} come to the Americas, xocolatl {{was said}} to be an {{acquired}} taste. What the Spaniards then called xocolatl was said to be a beverage consisting of a chocolate base flavored with vanilla and other spices that was served cold. The drink tasted spicy and bitter as opposed <b>to</b> <b>sweetened</b> modern hot chocolate. As to when xocolatl was first served hot, sources conflict on when and by whom. However, Jose de Acosta, a Spanish Jesuit missionary who lived in Peru and then Mexico in the later 16th century, described xocolatl as: ...|$|R
25|$|In the Argonautica, a 3rd-century BCE Alexandrian epic {{based on}} early material, Jason placates Hecate in a ritual {{prescribed}} by Medea, her priestess: bathed at midnight {{in a stream}} of flowing water, and dressed in dark robes, Jason is to dig a round pit and over it cut the throat of an ewe, sacrificing it and then burning it whole on a pyre next to the pit as a holocaust. He is told <b>to</b> <b>sweeten</b> the offering with a libation of honey, then to retreat from the site without looking back, even if he hears the sound of footsteps or barking dogs. All these elements betoken the rites owed to a chthonic deity.|$|E
25|$|The {{new product}} {{continued}} to be sold and retained the name Coca-Cola (until 1992, when it was renamed Coke II), so the old product was renamed Coca-Cola Classic (also called Coke Classic, later just Coke), and {{for a short period}} it was referred to by the public as Old Coke. Many who tasted the reintroduced formula were not convinced that the first batches really were the same formula that had supposedly been retired that spring. This was true for some regions because Coca-Cola Classic differed from the original formula in that all bottlers who hadn't already done so were using high fructose corn syrup instead of cane sugar <b>to</b> <b>sweeten</b> the drink.|$|E
25|$|Many {{flavourings}} {{are added}} to varieties of tea during processing. Among the best known are Chinese jasmine tea, with jasmine oil or flowers, the spices in Indian masala chai, and Earl Grey tea, which contains oil of bergamot. A great range of modern flavours {{have been added to}} these traditional ones. In eastern India, people also drink lemon tea or lemon masala tea. Lemon tea simply contains hot tea with lemon juice and sugar. Masala lemon tea contains hot tea with roasted cumin seed powder, lemon juice, black salt and sugar, which gives it a tangy, spicy taste. Adding a piece of ginger when brewing tea is a popular habit of Sri Lankans, who also use other types of spices such as cinnamon <b>to</b> <b>sweeten</b> the aroma.|$|E
50|$|In 1998, South College {{acquired}} Cecil's College, {{a former}} business school in Asheville, North Carolina. In 2002, it was renamed South College - Asheville, and relocated <b>to</b> 140 <b>Sweeten</b> Creek Road.|$|R
