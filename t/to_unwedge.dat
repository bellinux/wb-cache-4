It is drawn by grasping the scabbard near the top and pressing the guard with the thumb to emerge the blade just enough <b>to</b> <b>unwedge</b> the habaki from inside the scabbard in a process called [...] (extra2="cutting the koiguchi"). The blade, being freed, can be drawn out very quickly. This is known as [...] (koiguchi o kiru), [...] (nukitsuke), or [...] (extra2="clearing the tanka"). This is obviously an extremely aggressive gesture, since a fatal cut can be given in {{a fraction of a}} second thereafter (see iaid≈ç). It is similar in connotation and effect as drawing back the hammer of a handgun, chambering a round on a pump-action shotgun, or pulling back and releasing the charging handle on other firearms.|$|E
