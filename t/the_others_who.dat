5|$|CNN cited {{a senior}} U.S. {{official}} as saying {{three sets of}} photographs of bin Laden's body exist: Photos taken at an aircraft hangar in Afghanistan, described as the most recognizable and gruesome; photos taken from the burial at sea on the USS Carl Vinson before a shroud was placed around his body; and photos from the raid itself, which include shots of {{the interior of the}} compound as well as three of <b>the</b> <b>others</b> <b>who</b> died in the raid.|$|E
5|$|Crowley {{decided to}} climb Kangchenjunga in the Himalayas of Nepal, widely {{recognised}} as the world's most treacherous mountain. Assembling a team consisting of Jacot-Guillarmod, Charles Adolphe Reymond, Alexis Pache, and Alcesti C. Rigo de Righi, the expedition {{was marred by}} much argument between Crowley and <b>the</b> <b>others,</b> <b>who</b> {{thought that he was}} reckless. They eventually mutinied against Crowley's control, with the other climbers heading back down the mountain as nightfall approached despite Crowley's warnings that it was too dangerous. Subsequently, Pache and several porters were killed in an accident, something for which Crowley was widely blamed by the mountaineering community.|$|E

5|$|Sakic {{recorded}} his 1,000th career point on December 27, 1999, against the St. Louis Blues. He became the 11th player to reach 1,500 points, doing so on October 25, 2006, with an assist against the Washington Capitals, and the sixth {{to do so}} with one franchise. Gordie Howe, Wayne Gretzky, Mario Lemieux, Raymond Bourque and Steve Yzerman are <b>the</b> <b>others</b> <b>who</b> have achieved this feat. On March 22, 2008, Sakic notched his 1,000th career assist against the Edmonton Oilers on a second period goal scored by Tyler Arnason.|$|E
5|$|Nicholas Gleaves as Dr. James Whitaker. Whitaker {{serves as}} the main {{antagonist}} of the second series. He is a biochemist leading the research into a cure for the virus {{from the safety of}} a biologically secure research and development facility. As the research begins to require increasingly unethical practices, he lies and rationalises in the struggle to maintain the loyalty of his colleagues. Unbeknownst to the other workers (all of whom had lost loved ones in the pandemic), he had secreted his wife (portrayed by Alisa Arnah) and young son within the facility, violating protocol. His true motives are suspect, as he answers to someone called Mr. Landry, with whom he communicates over a satellite video link. Until his death he was using stolen anti-virus produced from Abby's blood for himself, keeping it from <b>the</b> <b>others,</b> <b>who</b> died when the virus got into the lab after Abby infected his wife. At {{the end of the second}} series, he is accidentally shot and killed by a sniper in Landry's employ.|$|E
5|$|The poem's {{focus on}} France {{served as a}} way for Southey to discuss his {{feelings}} about the French Revolution. In particular, Southey was upset that the British were calling men from their farms to serve as a militia during the time. In terms of the French, Southey did not support Robespierre and <b>the</b> <b>others</b> <b>who</b> followed him in France. However, he did support the idea of the French Republic. When he heard of Marie Antoinette's execution in October 1793, Southey told his friend Bedford that he condemned the action although he held to his Republican beliefs. However, he was further upset when word came that Brissot, the Girondin leader, was executed. This caused him to believe that all of the countries were equally bad, except the Republican United States, which he hoped to make his home. In 1794, many of Southey's feelings on Robespierre's involvement in these actions were included in both Joan of Arc and the Fall of Robbespierre, which followed after Robespierre's own execution. However, Southey had by then become very radical and believed that Robespierre was a great man who only helped mankind in his actions.|$|E

5|$|Writing {{at the end}} of the 19th century, the Brazilian {{abolitionist}} leader Joaquim Nabuco {{said that}} Rio Branco was—of all the politicians who held the office during PedroII's reign—the most fitted to the post of President of the Council of Ministers. Nabuco considered him one of the greatest statesmen of the Empire. However, he also argued that as a leader, a lawmaker, and a creator of doctrines, there were many other politicians far better than Rio Branco. But unlike all <b>the</b> <b>others,</b> <b>who</b> were brilliantly accomplished in one or a few skills, but lacking in many others, Rio Branco was good—though unexceptional—in all. In other words, he was a competent generalist. Nabuco's view was that due to Rio Branco's lack of first-rate abilities, he would not have been the best leader in troubled times—such as the anarchy which existed during PedroII's minority, or {{at the end of}} a period of chaos when strong action was needed to rebuild. Rio Branco was, however, the perfect choice in a time of peace and stability where his multiple skills could shine. His ability exactly fit the situation in Brazil when he became President of the Council of Ministers in 1871.|$|E
25|$|On {{receiving}} the negative response of Polycrates, Victor attempted {{to cut off}} Polycrates and <b>the</b> <b>others</b> <b>who</b> took this stance from the common unity, but reversed his decision after bishops who included Saint Irenaeus, bishop of Lugdunum in Gaul, interceded, recommending that Victor follow the more peaceful attitude of his predecessors.|$|E
25|$|After the war, rockets {{were used}} to study high-altitude conditions, by radio {{telemetry}} of temperature and pressure of the atmosphere, detection of cosmic rays, and further research; notably the Bell X-1, the first manned vehicle to break the sound barrier.

25|$|Dragon's Claws - {{a team of}} government-sponsored enforcers who twice {{clashed with}} Death's Head. The first instance, interceding when he was battling one of their targets, The Jones Boys, {{resulted}} in Death's Head being heavily defeated. On the second occasion, a newly-rebuilt Death's Head captured one of the Claws, Scavenger, and defeated <b>the</b> <b>others</b> <b>who</b> came to rescue him, but chose to spare them on a technicality.|$|E
25|$|Many of {{the warriors}} {{specifically}} attacked Magellan. In the struggle, {{he was wounded}} in the arm with a spear and in the leg by a kampilan. Those who stood beside him were easily overpowered and killed, while <b>the</b> <b>others</b> <b>who</b> tried to help him were hacked by spears and swords. With this advantage, Lapu-Lapu's troops finally overwhelmed and killed Magellan. Pigafetta and a few others managed to escape.|$|E
25|$|In {{the same}} year, Polycrates {{presided over a}} council at Ephesus {{attended}} by several bishops throughout that province, which rejected Victor's authority and kept the province's paschal tradition. Thereupon, Victor attempted to cut off Polycrates and <b>the</b> <b>others</b> <b>who</b> took this stance from the common unity, but later reversed his decision after bishops, that included Irenaeus of Lyon in Gaul, interceded and recommended that Victor adopt the more tolerant stance of his predecessor, Anicetus.|$|E

25|$|The next morning, some {{of those}} who had fled {{returned}} to the smoking ruins of their village. None of the bodies in the houses could be identified; many of <b>the</b> <b>others</b> <b>who</b> had fallen in the yards adjacent to the houses had bullet holes in their heads, chests, and backs, but identification of these victims was made difficult because many of the charred corpses had already been partially devoured by dogs and other animals.|$|E
25|$|Julia, Claire, Harry, and Edna {{are portrayed}} as invaders {{in the lives of}} Agnes and Tobias.

She has little empathy for <b>the</b> <b>others</b> <b>who</b> are also seeking comfort in the same house.|$|E
25|$|Mohnke (and {{what was}} left of his group) could not break through the Soviet rings. Most were taken {{prisoner}} and some committed suicide. General Mohnke and <b>the</b> <b>others</b> <b>who</b> had been in the Führerbunker were interrogated by SMERSH. Only a handful of survivors reached the Elbe and surrendered to the Western Allies. The majority were killed or captured by the Soviets. The number of German soldiers and civilians killed attempting the breakout is unknown.|$|E

25|$|In {{their first}} season after promotion, Forest won the League Cup, beating Liverpool 1–0 in a replay at Old Trafford, and were also crowned champions of Division One, {{finishing}} seven points clear of nearest challengers Liverpool.

(Tom Watson (from 1891 to 1906) and Kenny Dalglish (1985-1995) are <b>the</b> <b>others</b> <b>who</b> have achieved the same feat).|$|E
25|$|Several later {{incidents}} of self-immolation {{may have been}} influenced by the example of Palach and his media popularity. In the spring of 2003, a total of six young Czechs burned themselves to death, notably Zdeněk Adamec, a 19-year-old student from Humpolec who burned himself on 6 March 2003 on almost the same spot in front of the National Museum where Palach burnt himself, leaving a suicide note explicitly referring to Palach and <b>the</b> <b>others</b> <b>who</b> killed themselves in the 1969 Prague Spring.|$|E
25|$|A Song of Ice and Fire {{takes place}} in a fictional world, {{primarily}} on a continent called Westeros, and additionally on a large landmass to the east, known as Essos. Three main story lines become increasingly interwoven: a dynastic civil war for control of Westeros among several competing families; the rising threat of <b>the</b> <b>Others,</b> <b>who</b> dwell beyond the immense wall of ice that forms Westeros's northern border; and the ambitions of Daenerys Targaryen, exiled daughter of the deposed king, to return to Westeros and claim her throne.|$|E
