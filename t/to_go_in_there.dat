500|$|... "Tea Leaves" [...] {{was written}} by Matthew Weiner and Erin Levy and {{directed}} by series star Jon Hamm. This is the first episode of the series that Jon Hamm had directed, with Hamm saying that he owes thanks to John Slattery for paving the way. As preparation for directing the Rolling Stones concert, Hamm looked over archival photographs of the original concert. [...] "They were kids. The Rolling Stones. It was them and The Beatles. These huge pop explosions. People were really excited about {{it and it was}} a really big deal. And, in a larger sense, gave us a sense of where advertising is going." [...] Reflecting on his directing job, Hamm noted that he tried not to put much distracting style into the show, explaining that [...] "My job was not <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> and muck it up and say, [...] "I'm gonna put my stamp on this." [...] My job was <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> and keep the train on the tracks, basically. We have a very firmly established tone and look to our show that people respond to, and that I love." [...] Although the third episode of the season, it was actually the first episode produced for season, prior to the two-part season premiere, [...] "A Little Kiss".|$|E
500|$|British-Tamil {{recording}} artist M.I.A. {{was one of}} the songwriters of [...] "Elastic Love". According to her, [...] "Elastic Love" [...] was the first track that she recorded, even before she started working on her debut album. She added, [...] "It's the one I made in-between taking time out and having a baby and starting mine". When was asked about why she agreed to work with Aguilera, M.I.A. revealed, [...] "Other people were involved who I respect like Peaches and it was like a sea of women coming together to write this new thing. Christina had also had a baby, you know, so it was kind of an interesting situation". Aguilera's decision not to perform her [...] "trademark warbling" [...] while recording the song disappointed M.I.A., as she detailed in an interview with MTV News UK:I really thought I {{was going to be able}} <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> and get her vocals on to the next level and she didn't want to do it. She was like 'You might think that's great because it's not what you do, but to me I'm really bored of it'. It's interesting getting to work with people who can do things vocally that you can't... but yeah I only heard the song for the first time when everyone else did.|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Don Imus, Paul was asked for {{his view of the}} Gaza flotilla raid. He responded, [...] "... I think it's absolutely wrong to prevent people that are starving and having problems, that are almost like in concentration camps, and saying yes we endorse this whole concept that we can't allow ships <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> in a humanitarian way..." ...|$|E

60|$|Here we had quilts laid very commodiously {{for me and}} {{my three}} comrades, and we lodged very comfortably; but, before we <b>went</b> <b>to</b> rest, we had the third tent <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to,</b> <b>in</b> which <b>there</b> was a very {{handsome}} table, covered with a cold treat of roasted mutton and beef, very well dressed, some potted or baked venison, with pickles, conserves, and fine sweetmeats of various sorts.|$|R
40|$|AbstractTurkey, is {{undergoing}} a fast modernization process on one hand; but people still cling to traditional ways, on the other hand. This dual character {{makes it difficult for}} the formal and informal aspects of social life <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> parallel. <b>There</b> is a gap between anything officially on paper and the actual social reality of the real world out there...|$|R
2500|$|While Governor, Palin vetoed {{public funding}} for private, Christian schools, saying after the fact, [...] "I'm a Christian.... unconstitutional. It's illegal. You can't do that. I had <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> and veto those things and, of course, was accused then of being, 'Oh, you're {{not a real}} {{conservative}} or a real Republican. Otherwise, you would have fought for that.' No, illegal is illegal." ...|$|E
2500|$|He wrote briefly for {{publishing}} house Robbins Music and producer Mickie Most in 1967, and then shifted base to the Kennedy Street Enterprises show business management offices in Manchester. He remained there for four years, recalling: [...] "It {{was like an}} office. I used <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> every morning at 10 o'clock and stay there, working on my songs, until I finished every evening at six o'clock. It was self-discipline and I need that." ...|$|E
2500|$|Project 86 has {{sometimes}} been labeled a [...] "Christian band", although the band itself eschewed the label. The band considers its art {{to be the best}} conveyance of their message. Frontman Andrew Schwab has offered several statements on the topic. [...] "We're not going <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> and say 'Hey we're the Christian band. We're going to carry ourselves like a normal band. Hopefully people will like our music and investigate into the band [...] and they will learn our beliefs." [...] "If we're playing at Ozzfest or on Family Values...," [...] the band told 7ball after the release of their second album, [...] "there is a greater level of tact necessary in order to reach that sort of audience." [...] In a 2007 interview, Schwab further opined [...] "We always tell people that the goal has been to just write music that we love, and write music hopefully that is challenging and inspiring to people and doesn't sound like everything else out there." ...|$|E

2500|$|When casting for the film, Iliadis {{wanted to}} find actors who would not portray these {{characters}} in a stereotypical way. As Craven explains, they wanted someone who would take these characters {{in a direction that}} most actors would not—they wanted originality. Craven states, [...] "You need an actor who can bring a complete sense of commitment to that character without making it silly and not be afraid <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> to the point where someone might say, 'Oh, you got bad in you?' You have to be brave enough and mature enough to know we've all got it, and you're not afraid of putting it out there and if you've got a problem with seeing that, tough." [...] For instance, Iliadis wanted to avoid casting some superficially sexy actress in the role of Mari, because he did not want the rape sequence to appear enjoyable to the viewers in any possible way. Iliadis notes that when Sara Paxton came in her audition was [...] "good", but it was this sense of intelligence and intensity that Paxton brought with her. The actress also had the [...] "innocent face" [...] the director was looking for, someone who had this [...] "wholesomely American look" [...] that would not allow anyone to enjoy watching her go through these intense events.|$|E

6000|$|He sought his wife, in the pantry, and exploded, [...] "I'd like <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> {{and throw}} {{some of those}} young pups out of the house! They talk down to me like I was the butler! I'd like to--" ...|$|E
6000|$|The captain smiled. [...] "I don't {{think we}} will give up the caves just yet. I, for one, most {{certainly}} want <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> again." [...] And then he {{told the story of}} the stone mound which he had discovered.|$|E

6000|$|... "Then {{it must be}} my sins {{that are}} helping to lure me too at the present moment," [...] said Marguerite lightly.

6000|$|A {{week ago}} he had invented {{a system of}} leaving his {{cigar-case}} and cigarette-box in an unused drawer {{at the bottom of}} the correspondence-file, in the outer office. [...] "I'll just naturally be ashamed <b>to</b> <b>go</b> poking <b>in</b> <b>there</b> all day long, making a fool of myself before my own employees!" [...] he reasoned. By the end of three days he was trained to leave his desk, walk to the file, take out and light a cigar, without knowing that he was doing it.|$|R
