40|$|Information {{analysis}} {{and decision making}} are complex processes given that the sources of information are diverse and distributed, the acquired information is noisy, dynamic, incomplete and uncertain. The key issues include: identifying and sharing valuable information in a timely and efficient manner; integrating large volumes of disparate information to support better decisions; suggesting effective and robust courses of action (COA) for the <b>targeted</b> <b>mission</b> based on partial information; optimizing a team decision in a noisy and distributed environment. ^ In this thesis, we utilize multiple graphical models, including static Bayesian networks (BNs), dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs), hidden Markov models (HMMs) and influence diagrams (IDs), {{to address the problems}} of stochastic planning, information integration (fusion), and distributed decision making. A new methodology, which combines DBN and genetic algorithms, is introduced to obtain a near-optimal robust strategy for planning in a stochastic environment. The problem is formulated as a DBN-based stochastic mission model, while a genetic algorithm is utilized in an outer loop to search for a near-optimal strategy with DBN inference serving as a fitness evaluator. A collaboration scheme which constructs BNs and HMMs in a hierarchical fashion is discussed for fusing uncertain and diverse information from multiple agencies. HMMs function in the bottom observation layer to process the dynamic transactions and detect suspicious activities, if any. BNs act in the top layer to integrate local information and obtain a global assessment for the scenario being monitored. Influence diagrams are widely accepted for problems, where a single decision maker is making sequential decisions under uncertainty. However, real world situations are very likely to involve parallel decisions, where multiple decision makers cooperate to arrive at a team decision. Iterated influence diagrams, which extend traditional influence diagrams, employing a person-by-person optimization scheme, are developed and are used to solve a parallel distributed hypothesis testing problem. ...|$|E
40|$|Satellite {{design has}} always been {{considered}} as an extremely expensive and high risk business which not only requires vast knowledge and expertise but also extensive budget. Primarily, this concept was based on initial development and launching cost. Secondly, {{it was impossible to}} repair and substitute parts in space (this was true up to 1993 : the first Hubble Space Telescope servicing mission), which made the design more tough because it required advanced fault tolerance solutions and extreme reliability. With the passage of time academic entities and small companies have also entered this market. Low cost design techniques have {{played an important role in}} the aerospace market growth over the recent years, but they can still play an important role in future developments. At present, several private companies are also providing an affordable launch services which lowers the accumulative cost. Many universities and Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) worldwide are trying to further reduce the satellite costs. One recent example of these efforts is the CubeSat concept: a really small satellite, built using commercial components. This thesis work also proceeds in the same direction: the novel AraMiS (Italian acronym for Modular Architecture for Satellites) architecture and its different tiles (main subsystem) will be described. The goal of AraMiS is to progress beyond the concept of CubeSats and create a true modular architecture. The main idea of the AraMiS is modularity at mechanical, electronic and testing levels. These modules can then be assembled together to get desired requirements for the <b>targeted</b> <b>mission,</b> which allows for an effective cost sharing between multiple missions. This thesis deals with the design and development of telecommunication subsystems for AraMiS Project and in particular for AraMiS-C 1 satellite on a single CubeSat standard module called tile. The implementation of S-band transceiver over the half of telecommunication tile is not a trivial task. Several techniques were employed to make possible such a reduction interms of size, weight and power consumption while still achieving desirable performance for communication link. COTS components have been used for 1 B 9 _CubeTCT sub modules implementation. COTS particularly for RF Front End design were selected on the basis of performance in harsh LEO environment, power losses, dimension and space occupied onboard 1 B 9 _CubeTCT. In order to cope with such anomalies on the 1 B 9 _CubeTCT Subsystem; different housekeeping sensors have been employed at various point of the tile. This thesis work also elaborates on the S-band antennas design for both versions of AraMiS satellites with uses innovative technique to enhance performance while keep the size, weight and cost within acceptable margins. The first couple of chapter presents an introduction to AraMiS project and AraMiS-C 1 satellite. In chapter 3 there is a discussion of different satellite design flow configurations. The chapter 4 comprehensively discusses the 1 B 9 _CubeTCT, which is the CubeSat standard telecommunication tile developed for AraMiS-C 1 and other CubeSat standard nano-satellites. It consists of S-band and UHF OBRF modules which provide radio communication link between satellite and the earth. It also gives an indepth explanation on the design and development of each sub-module onboard 1 B 9 _CubeTCT that includes CubeTCT S-band transceiver, RF front end, Housekeeping Sensors, Tile Regulators, anti-latchup protection circuit and RF matching network. Chapter 5 deals with the S-band antenna design, fabrication and testing for conventional AraMiS architecture and AraMiS C- 1 satellite. It explains in detail, the design, implementation and testing of single patch antenna and AraMiS patch array that are used for AraMiS C- 1 and Conventional AraMiS satellites respectively. The chapter 6 provides link budget estimation for different scenarios, ranging for worst to the best possible case. A brief description on the Polito ground station and its key attributes is also provided. The Link budget estimates for other ground stations (GENSO members) are also performed and feasibility of developed 1 B 9 CubeTCT hardware is verified. Chapter 7 introduces the AraMiS protocol, developed in compliance with GENSO project which aims for providing an extended communication link for a satellite (remotely via internet), by using a GENSO member ground station around the World. A new frame format is defined which makes AraMiS satellite compatible with GENSO. Later in the chapter are presented different possible scenarios of AraMiS Protocol mechanism during normal operation case and also in case of packet loss (in both uplink and downlink communication. ...|$|E

Primarily, this concept was based on initial development and launching cost. Secondly, it was also impossible to repair and substitute parts (this was true up to 1993 : the first Hubble Space Telescope servicing mission), which makes design more tough because it requires advanced fault tolerance solutions and extreme reliability. But {{with the passage of}} time many space actors entered in this market. Low cost design techniques played an important role in the aerospace market growth in the past years, but they can still play a major part in future developments. At present, several private companies are also providing launch services which further lower the accumulative cost. Many universities and SMEs (Small Medium Enterprises) worldwide are also trying to reduce satellite costs. The Department of Electronics and Telecommunication (DET) at Politecnico di Torino has been working on NanoSatellites since 2002 and developed their first NanoSatellite called PiCPoT, which was intended to be launched together with other university satellites by a DNEPR LV rocket in July 2006. Unfortunately a problem in the first stage of the carrier led to the destruction of all satellites. After that DET started work on a comprehensive NanoSatellite project called AraMiS (Italian acronym for Modular Architecture of Satellites). The main idea of the AraMiS is modularity at mechanical, electronic and testing levels using Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) components. These modules can be assembled together to get the <b>targeted</b> <b>mission,</b> which allows an effective cost sharing between multiple missions. AraMiS satellites have mass up to 5 kg with different shapes and dimensions. AraMiS-C 1 is a CubeSat Standard satellite developed on the AraMiS approach. Four sides of the AraMiS-C 1 are equipped with identical tiles called 1 B 8 _CubePMT that mount solar panels on the exterior and a combined power management, attitude control and computing subsystem on the interior. The other two sides are devoted to the telecommunication tiles called 1 B 9 _CubeTCT which carry a commercial deployable UHF antenna (one side) and a patch type SHF antenna (the other side). Thesis discusses in detail the design, implementation and testing of the 1 B 8 _CubePMT module. It is developed on the design approach of AraMiS architecture with dimension 98 × 82. 5 × 1. 6 mm 3. 1 B 8 _CubePMT module contains electric power supply (EPS) and attitude determination & control subsystems (ADCS) of AraMiS-C 1 satellite. The integration of such a large number of systems in a small area was not a trivial job. Several techniques were employed for reduction of size, weight and power consumption of the different subsystems while still achieving best performances. COTS components were selected for the EPS subsystems, on the basis of power loss analysis and minimum dimensions which helped in efficiency enhancement and also miniaturization of the subsystems. ADCS subsystems components were also selected on the basis of minimum dimensions and lower power consumptions while still achieving targeted performances. The most interesting feature of the 1 B 8 _CubePMT module is the design and integration of a reconfigurable magnetorquer coil within four internal layers occupying no excess space. Coils in each layer are treated separately and can be attached/detached through straps. Changing the arrangement of these straps make the magnetorquer reconfigurable. Different housekeeping sensors have been employed at various points of the 1 B 8 _CubePMT module. Thesis also discusses thermal modeling of CubeSat, AraMiS-C 1 satellite and 1 B 8 _CubePMT module. Thermal resistance and temperature differences between different sides of the satellites and individual tiles have been found. At the end, preliminary thermal and spin analysis of NanoSatellites have been presented. Chapter 1 gives an introduction to the problem and proposed solutions which will be discussed in this thesis. Chapter 2 presents an introduction to AraMiS project and AraMiS-C 1 satellite. Chapter 3 discusses different satellite design flow configurations and their comparison. Chapter 4 discusses 1 B 8 _CubePMT module which is a CubeSat standard power management tile, developed on the AraMiS concept, for AraMiS-C 1 satellite. It has EPS and ADCS subsystems which are the most essential elements of any aerospace mission. Chapter 5 deals with the design and development of the EPS system of AraMiS-C 1 satellite. This chapter discusses how to reduce the size, weight and power consumption of the EPS subsystems while achieving better efficiency and fulfilling satellite power requirements. The selection of COTS components on the basis of power loss analysis and minimum dimensions is discussed in detail. Housekeeping sensors such as current, voltage and temperature sensors which are employed at different points of the 1 B 8 _CubePMT module to cope with anomalies, have been discussed in detail in this chapter. At the end of the chapter, the designed EPS is evaluated on the basis of AraMiS-C 1 power budget. Chapter 6 discusses design and implementation of attitude determination sensors (ADS) of the AraMiS-C 1 satellite. 1 B 8 _CubePMT has three types of attitude determination sensors: sun sensor, magnetometer and gyroscope. This chapter discusses in detail the design and operation of these sensors. Chapter 7 discusses the attitude control (ADC) system of AraMiS-C 1 satellite. The design and implementation of a reconfigurable magnetorquer coil which is embedded inside the 1 B 8 _CubePMT module, is discussed in detail. The designed magnetorquer has been evaluated on different parameters and compared with the magnetic actuator already available in the market. In chapter 8 testing procedure and results of 1 B 8 _CubePMT subsystems are discussed in detail. Chapter 9 presents thermal modelling of NanoSatellites. Detailed and simplified thermal models of CubeSat panel have been discussed. Thermal resistances measured through both models are compared. Generic thermal model of a CubeSat is presented. Utilizing the proposed models, thermal resistance of 1 B 8 _CubePMT and AraMiS-C 1 are measured. In order to verify the theoretical results, the thermal resistance of the AraMiS-C 1 is measured through an experimental setup. Chapter 10 discusses preliminary thermal and spin analysis of NanoSatellites in space environment. All the heat sources and their effects on the satellite have been discussed. A thermal balance equation has been established and satellite temperature for different structures and various conditions has been found. At the end a satellite spin analysis on the basis of different absorption coefficient related with colors, has been discusse...|$|E
