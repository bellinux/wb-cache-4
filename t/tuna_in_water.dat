TDS Se data collected from 2003 – 2010 was evaluated by comparing these data to Se concentration data in USDA's Standard Reference 26 (SR 26) Database. We also evaluated trends in Se concentrations over time and differences in Se concentrations by Market Basket (MB). Comparable SR 26 foods were identified for most TDS foods; however, for many TDS foods, {{there was more than}} one match in SR 26. TDS was found to be a unique source of analytical Se concentration data for four food mixtures and for several SR 26 foods with imputed Se concentrations. Se concentrations in TDS foods were similar to analyzed Se concentrations in most corresponding SR 26 foods. Se concentrations in whole wheat bread were significantly higher in MB 2 (U. S. West Region, collected in the winter) than in MB 1 (U. S. North Central Region, collected in the fall), 3 (U. S. South Region, collected in the spring), and 4 (U. S. North East Region, collected in the summer). Se concentrations in whole wheat bread were also significantly higher in MB 4 than in MB 3. Se concentrations in boiled eggs were significantly higher in MB 2 than in other market baskets. The U. S.

Results of this study demonstrate the potential value of TDS concentration data for Se and other nutrients to the U. S. nutrition community. However, it is clear that TDS data on generic foods (e. g. <b>tuna,</b> canned <b>in</b> <b>water)</b> are less useful than TDS data on more specifically defined foods (e. g. <b>tuna,</b> white, canned <b>in</b> <b>water).</b> Potential geographical and/or seasonal differences in Se contents of some foods may warrant additional investigation...|$|R
40|$|In this report, the {{significant}} oceanographic factors influencing spatial-distributions for bigeye <b>tuna</b> species <b>in</b> the Indian Ocean were investigated {{on the basis}} of the data collected and accumulated in the past years. The results show that bigeye <b>tuna</b> are distributed <b>in</b> <b>water</b> with the optimum temperature in a range of 10 ? C- 16 ? C irrespective of their sexual maturity and water mass. Accordingly, the vertical distribution of tuna is predicted by the temperature profile; the tunas are only found in the deeper layer in the tropical region while they are distributed up to the shallower layer in the middle latitude. On the other hand, the bigeye tuna reaching the maturity is found only beneath the layer between 0 and 50 m where the sea water temperature exceeds 26 ?C. The size of fishing ground in the tropical region decreases during the period between June and September. This decrease coincides with the decrease in sea area where the <b>water</b> temperature <b>in</b> the layer above 50 m is warmer than 26 ?

30|$|Tuna fishes, Scombridae family, {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{economically}} important marine resources for industrial fishing activities in the Persian Gulf and Oman Sea (Kamrani et al. 2010). The Scombridae is a family of 15 genera and about 50 species of epipelagic marine fishes (Block and Stevens 2001). The main <b>tuna</b> species caught <b>in</b> the Iranian <b>waters</b> of Persian Gulf and Oman Sea are: longtail tuna (Thunnus tonggol Bleeker, 1851), yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares Bonnaterre, 1788), skipjack tuna (Katsuwonus pelamis Linnaeus, 1758), kawakawa (Euthynnus affinis Cantor, 1849), frigate tuna (Auxis thazard Lacepede, 1800), Narrow-barred Spanish mackerel (Scomberomorus commerson Lacepede, 1800) and Indo-Pacific king mackerel (Scomberomorus guttatus Bloch & Schneider, 1801). Tuna fishes constitute around 50 % of total landings of the Hormozgan province and total annual commercial landings of <b>tuna</b> fishes <b>in</b> Iranian <b>waters</b> of Persian Gulf and Oman Sea were around 175, 000 tonnes. Longtail tuna represented 46 % of total catch (Iran Fishery Organization 2013).|$|R
40|$|Abstract Longtail tuna (Thunnus tonggol) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{economically}} important <b>tuna</b> species <b>in</b> Iranian <b>waters</b> of Persian Gulf and Oman Sea. Some population dynamics parameters of this species were investigated <b>in</b> coastal <b>waters</b> of the northern Persian Gulf and Oman Sea from January to December 2014. The fork length (FL) of all specimens ranged from 27 to 107  cm, and total weight (TW) was between 200 and 12, 000  g. Among the length frequencies examined, specimens with fork length in the range of 62 – 65  cm were the dominant group. The equation of length–weight relationship was estimated as TW =  0. 00003  × FL 2. 82 (R 2  =  0. 84) and isometric growth model was determined for longtail <b>tuna</b> <b>in</b> study area. The parameters of Von Bertalanffy growth function were obtained as: L ∞ =  111. 23  cm, k =  0. 3  year− 1 and t 0  = − 0. 38  years and ϕ′ =  3. 6. The annual instantaneous rate of total mortality (Z), natural mortality (M) and fishing mortality (F) was estimated to be 1. 15, 0. 43 and 0. 72  year− 1, respectively. The exploitation rate (E) was calculated as 0. 63 indicating that longtail tuna was fully exploited in the study region...|$|R
30|$|Gulland and Rosenberg (1992) {{noted that}} {{sampling}} from {{large number of}} smaller samples than sampling from {{a limited number of}} larger samples will always give more information, while providing estimates with smaller variance. In this regard, two samples of 150 fish will always give more information than one of 300 fish, but will take more time. Furthermore, a sample of 50 – 150 fish/month and an annual sample of 1000 – 1500 fish provide the most reliable image on the biological characteristics of a specific species. To have most reliable understanding on the biology of longtail <b>tuna</b> distributed <b>in</b> coastal <b>waters</b> of the northern Persian Gulf and Oman Sea, sampling was done in five different landing sites and covered 12  months (180 fish/month).|$|R
40|$|The present {{status of}} the oceanic <b>tuna</b> fishery <b>in</b> Indian <b>waters</b> is discussed. The fishery is {{exclusively}} by long lining, mainly foreign vessels operating under charter, with some Indian flag vessels. Under the char-ter scheme longliners started fishing <b>in</b> Indian <b>waters</b> <b>in</b> 1985. Maximum fleet size and effort (58 vessels, 19. 8 million hooks) was in 1990. Consequent to the government policy of phasing out the charter scheme in favour of Indian ownership and joint-venture schemes, the number of vessels dropped to 17 and annual effort to about 3. 9 million hooks in 1994. Under the Indian ownership and joint-venture schemes, 6 vessels of 42 - 55 m OAL are in operation. Average annual production from the longline fishery in 1993 - 1994 was about 4114 t, 65 % of which is con-tributed by the chartered vessels, 33. 5 % by Indian flag vessels and 1. 5 % by the survey vessels of the Gov-ernment of India. Yellowfin tuna formed 46. 5 % of the catch, bigeye tuna 26. 3 %, billfishes 18. 6 % and other fishes (mainly sharks) 8. 6 %. Research and development support for tuna fishing has been stepped up in recent years. Longline surveys yielded encouraging results indicating relatively high levels of abundance of yellowfin <b>tuna</b> <b>in</b> Indian wa-ters. Biological research and environmental interaction studies of tuna distribution have been initiated, and preliminary results are available...|$|R
