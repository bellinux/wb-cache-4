5|$|Amanita onusta, {{commonly}} known as the loaded Lepidella or the gunpowder Lepidella, is a species of fungus in the Amanitaceae family of mushrooms. It is characterized by its small to medium-sized fruit bodies that have white to pale gray caps crowded with roughly conical, pyramidal, or irregular gray warts. The stipe is whitish-gray with woolly or wart-like veil remnants, and at <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>is</b> a spindle- or turnip-shaped base that is rooted somewhat deeply in the soil. The species is distributed in eastern North America, from Nova Scotia to Mexico, and may be found growing on the ground in deciduous forests, particularly those with oak, hickory and chestnut. Fruit bodies smell somewhat like bleaching powder, and their edibility is unknown, but possibly toxic.|$|E
5|$|At {{the lowest}} level of the façade is a plain base, {{contrasting}} with and stabilising the ornate arcades that rise above it. <b>The</b> <b>base</b> <b>is</b> penetrated by three doors, which are {{in stark contrast to the}} often imposing portals of French Gothic cathedrals. The outer two are of domestic proportion and the central door is ornamented only by a central post, quatrefoil and the fine mouldings of the arch.|$|E
5|$|CFB Winnipeg is a Canadian Forces Base at the Winnipeg International Airport. <b>The</b> <b>base</b> <b>is</b> home {{to flight}} {{operations}} support divisions and several training schools, {{as well as}} the 1 Canadian Air Division and Canadian NORAD Region Headquarters. 17 Wing of the Canadian Forces is based at CFB Winnipeg; the Wing has three squadrons and six schools. It supports 113 units from Thunder Bay to the Saskatchewan/Alberta border, and from the 49th parallel north to the high Arctic. 17 Wing acts as a deployed operating base for CF-18 Hornet fighter–bombers assigned to the Canadian NORAD Region.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>base</b> <b>was</b> {{originally}} named FOB Armadillo {{after the}} mascot of a Danish company commander, Major Anders Stæhr Storrud, {{who was killed}} three months before <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>was</b> established. <b>The</b> <b>base</b> <b>was</b> then renamed to FOB Budwan in 2010.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>base</b> <b>was</b> {{evacuated}} in <b>the</b> {{face of the}} Chinese Third Phase Campaign on 5 January 1951 and <b>the</b> <b>base's</b> buildings <b>were</b> destroyed. <b>The</b> <b>base</b> <b>was</b> recaptured on 28 January as part of Operation Thunderbolt and by 6 March, {{despite its}} poor condition, <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>was</b> used for <b>the</b> staging of F-86 patrols along the Yalu River and Mig Alley.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>base</b> <b>was</b> {{originally}} intended to be an air defense fighter <b>base</b> for <b>the</b> Chicago and Milwaukee areas. It was conceived in the early 1950s and construction began in the mid-1950s. Construction had barely begun when <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>was</b> transferred to <b>the</b> Strategic Air Command. Eventually, <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>was</b> considered obsolete as it had become apparent to Air Force officials that <b>the</b> <b>base</b> would <b>be</b> rather redundant with installations nearby that would soon have space for more units. <b>The</b> <b>base</b> <b>was</b> abandoned in 1959 and disposed of the following year.|$|R
5|$|Forward Operating Base Chapman {{is located}} at the site of a former Afghan army {{installation}} with an airstrip. <b>The</b> <b>base</b> <b>is</b> named for Sergeant First Class Nathan Chapman, the first U.S. soldier killed by enemy fire during the Afghanistan war. Chapman was killed while fighting alongside the CIA in 2002. FOB Chapman is located near Forward Operating Base Salerno, a military base used by U.S. special operations forces.|$|E
5|$|Males have a long, {{straight}} penis with a notch {{between the}} shaft and the narrow, egg-shaped glans penis. Near the top, the penis is haired, but <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>is</b> almost naked. In the baculum (penis bone), the shaft {{is long and}} narrow and slightly curved. The length of the penis and baculum distinguish P.raceyi from all comparably sized African and Malagasy vespertilionids. P.endoi, P.paterculus, and P.abramus have more similar bacula, but that of P.abramus is more curved, the shaft and the tip are more robust in P.paterculus, and the proximal (near) end is more robust in P.endoi. In males, penis length is 9.6 to 11.8mm (0.38 to 0.46in) and baculum length is 8.8 to 10.0mm (0.35 to 0.39in).|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>base</b> <b>is</b> most {{commonly}} histidine since its pKa allows for effective base catalysis, hydrogen bonding to the acid residue, and deprotonation of the nucleophile residue. β-lactamases such as TEM-1 use a lysine residue as the base. Because lysine's pKa {{is so high}} (pKa=11), a glutamate and several other residues act as the acid to stabilise its deprotonated state during the catalytic cycle. Threonine proteases use their N-terminal amide as the base, since steric crowding by the catalytic threonine's methyl prevents other residues from being close enough.|$|E
50|$|The 4750th Air Defense Wing was inactivated at Vincent AFB on 15 June 1959 {{and control}} of <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>was</b> passed over to the United States Navy. Nine days later <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>was</b> {{turned over to the}} United States Marine Corps. <b>The</b> <b>base</b> <b>was</b> renamed Marine Corps Air Station Yuma (Vincent Field) on July 20, 1962.|$|R
50|$|Construction and the {{subsequent}} operations from <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>were</b> conducted under total secrecy {{and the existence of}} <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>was</b> never formally acknowledged until after the war.|$|R
50|$|The Defence Reform Program (DRP) {{determined}} <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>was</b> {{no longer}} required and on 28 May 1998 the lease on <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>was</b> sold to Canberra International Airport Pty Ltd. Part of <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>was</b> sub-leased {{back to the}} Australian Department of Defence on a five-year lease to allow the progressive wind up of operations. <b>The</b> <b>base</b> <b>was</b> decommissioned on 27 June 2003 and the domestic area became known as Defence Establishment Fairbairn, with Canberra International Airport and the Capital Airport Group having full control of the airfield and the site.|$|R
5|$|The inner {{peridium}} {{is a thin}} shiny {{tissue that}} is depressed into areas demarcated by the pyramidal plates. The puffball base, which occupies about a third to {{a quarter of the}} bottom of the fruit body, consists of moderately-sized chambers that persist even after the gleba has matured and the spores have dispersed. The base can assume a purplish hue after weathering. <b>The</b> <b>base</b> <b>is</b> rooted into the soil with rhizomorphs. Initially white, the gleba turns color from yellow to golden brown to dark brown as the spores mature. As the gleba dries, the inner peridium dries and cracks, exposing the spore mass in cracks between the scales. The gleba is supported by a yellowish-brown to light brown subgleba.|$|E
5|$|With the plane, {{they land}} {{on an island}} which has the source for every dirty joke ever made, the base looks similar to a temple-compound from the 1979 film Apocalypse Now. <b>The</b> <b>base</b> <b>is</b> {{inhabited}} with many great minds including Warren Buffett (who was in a deleted scene on the DVD), Bill Gates, and Stephen Hawking where they pass their time writing the world's dirty jokes. It is shown that the first dead baby joke {{was written in the}} era of Ancient Egypt.|$|E
5|$|After {{becoming}} {{familiar with}} their new shadows, the party travels to Talta village, befriending Marumaro on the way, who also possesses a magical shadow. Finding that the villagers from Talta have started to head towards {{the capital city of}} Jibral, the party takes off after them. Just outside Jibral, the party finds the villagers attacked by Steel-Eating Tigers. They are saved by the arrival of King Jibral and his forces, including Zola. Once the villagers are brought to Jibral, the King decides to implement a plan to destroy one of Nene's bases near Jibral using Shu and his friends along with Zola. Together, the party works with the warriors of Talta Village the Jibral Kingdom to besiege Nene's Mechat base. After <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>is</b> destroyed, the party heads north in search of Nene. Nene captures Kluke, and places a collar around her neck which Nene alleges will explode. After reaching Nene, Zola separates from the party to buy them time to attack Nene. When the party attempts to remove Kluke's collar, Nene absorbs the party's shadows by placing collars on all of them. After taking their powers and placing them in himself, he removes their collars and attempts to kill them before they recover. Shu, despite being drained of magical ability, unconsciously teleports the party to the distant Devour village.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>base</b> <b>was</b> {{reactivated}} on 15 July 1961, but <b>the</b> only personnel <b>based</b> there <b>were</b> a fifteen-man firefighting detachment. By 1962, when <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>was</b> again deactivated, only 128 of {{the original}} 668 buildings remained. The General Services Administration (GSA) wanted to sell <b>the</b> <b>base</b> to <b>the</b> town of Wendover, leaving only the bombing ranges and radar site with the Air Force. <b>The</b> <b>base</b> <b>was</b> renamed Decker Field, and again declared surplus in 1972. <b>The</b> <b>base</b> continued to <b>be</b> used occasionally for training by Air National Guard units, and the firefighting detachment remained until 1977.|$|R
50|$|When <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>was</b> {{deactivated}} it {{was transferred}} to a civilian operation. Ownership of <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>was</b> transferred to <b>the</b> Army Corps of Engineers and ultimately to the Smyrna/Rutherford County Airport Authority.|$|R
50|$|During the First World War a {{seaplane}} <b>base</b> <b>was</b> {{constructed on}} Hornsea Mere, named RNAS Hornsea Mere, <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>was</b> used to operate submarine patrols in the North Sea. <b>The</b> <b>base</b> <b>was</b> abandoned after <b>the</b> {{end of the}} war.|$|R
5|$|At the top-secret Icarus Base, {{the group}} is {{introduced}} to Colonel Everett Young (Louis Ferreira), Colonel David Telford (Lou Diamond Phillips), and First Lieutenant Matthew Scott (Brian J. Smith). Wallace's solution is tested but fails to establish a lock. During dinner, three Ha'tak vessels, believed {{to be under the}} control of the Lucian Alliance, attack the planet. An evacuation is begun while the Hammond which is manned by Colonel Samantha Carter (Amanda Tapping) and a squadron of F-302s led by Colonel Telford battle the enemy. Rush, desperate to see his project succeed, enlists Wallace's aid in figuring out what went wrong. Wallace suggests that the final symbol of the address is wrong, and that they should use the symbol for Earth. Rush aborts the dialing sequence to Earth, arguing that the energy release from the exploding planet could follow them through the Gate, and tests the theory, which succeeds. With the planet's unstable core about to go critical and lacking any other means of escape, the remaining survivors in the base (roughly 80 people) are forced to risk heading to an unknown destination. The planet explodes shortly after everyone is evacuated, destroying the three Ha'tak vessels. The Hammond survives, but the fate of those in <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>is</b> a mystery to Stargate Command.|$|E
5|$|Gameplay itself {{requires}} Jetman {{to locate}} and destroy a series of alien bases {{on the surface of}} the moon. Each new base appears with the destruction of the previous one. To accomplish this task, Jetman must take the bomb to the alien base—either in his space suit or using the rover—and then fly over the base and drop the bomb. After several bases have been destroyed in succession, new and increasingly hazardous varieties of flying aliens assault the player. Each base must be destroyed within a strict time limit. If this limit expires before <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>is</b> destroyed, two missiles are launched from the base—one for Earth, the other for Jetman's rover. The player will be given a limited time to intercept and destroy the missiles whilst still in flight, thus preventing a game over.|$|E
5|$|Lacquerware is {{produced}} in a three-step process: first <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>is</b> prepared. Most often the base consists of wood, {{but it can also}} be of paper or leather. Next is the application of lacquer, which hardens while drying, thereby sealing the base. Generally several layers of lacquer are applied. The lacquer is then decorated with a variety of methods. In the maki-e technique, a powdered metal (usually gold or silver) is sprinkled on the lacquer before completely hardened. This technique was developed and popular in the Heian period but continued to be used with refinements into the early modern period. Over the next centuries various other methods that employ precious metals were developed, such as the ikakeji technique originating in the Kamakura period in which a finely ground gold powder was spread in sufficient quantities to mimic solid gold. The use of metallic powders was complemented with other techniques such as polished shell inlay or gold leaf (kirikane). The former was used in the Heian and Kamakura periods and popular motifs included water, rocks, trees or flowers. Starting in the Kamakura period, larger and more solid objects such as toiletry chests were decorated with realistic images. Towards the end of the medieval period (late-16th century), simpler designs were favoured in decorations. Honami Kōetsu who lived around this time is the earliest lacquer artist known by name.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>base</b> <b>was</b> {{evacuated}} on <b>the</b> {{night of}} 30 June 1950 {{in the face}} of the Korean People's Army (KPA) attack, but <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>was</b> not occupied by the KPA until 2 July 1950.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>base</b> <b>was</b> {{formerly}} used by Task Force Helmand HQ until 9 August 2013 and {{was controlled}} under Operation Herrick (OP H). <b>The</b> <b>base</b> <b>was</b> {{handed over to}} the ANSF on 24 February 2014.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>base</b> <b>was</b> first {{established}} in October 1965 by the 1st Brigade, 1st Cavalry Division {{to support the}} relief of the Siege of Plei Me. <b>The</b> <b>base</b> <b>was</b> beside QL-19 next to the Catecka Tea Plantation and approximately 12 km southwest of Pleiku. <b>The</b> <b>base</b> <b>was</b> originally called <b>the</b> Stadium but by November 1965 when it {{was taken over by}} the 3rd Brigade, 1st Cavalry it was called Catecka.|$|R
5|$|Miniopterus aelleni is a small, brown Miniopterus species. The head may be {{slightly}} lighter in color than the body. Some {{hairs on the}} underparts have buff tips. Miniopterus griveaudi is similar in color, but M.manavi is darker and M.brachytragos and M.mahafaliensis are lighter. The tragus (a projection {{on the inner side}} of the outer ear) is long and has a broad base with a crest at the side, and ends in a blunt to slightly rounded tip. In M.manavi and M.griveaudi, in contrast, <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>is</b> narrower, in M.mahafaliensis, the sides of the tragus are parallel, and M.brachytragus has a short, blunt tragus sparsely covered with hair. The wing membrane is also brown, but the uropatagium is lighter. The wing membrane and uropatagium are attached to the upper leg at the same level, above the ankle. The uropatagium is sparsely covered with thin, but clearly visible hairs. In contrast, M.manavi, M.mahafaliensis, and M.brachytragos have densely covered uropatagia and that of M.griveaudi is almost naked. Individuals from Anjouan have significantly shorter hindfeet than those from Madagascar, but otherwise the two populations cannot be distinguished on the basis of external characteristics.|$|E
5|$|On 26 April 2012, Secretary of the Army John M. McHugh {{announced}} the 7th Infantry Division headquarters would be reactivated at Joint Base Lewis-McChord in October 2012. The headquarters element of about 250 would not activate any subordinate brigades. Instead, it filled an administrative {{role as a}} non-deployable unit. In the announcement, McHugh noted <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>is</b> home to I Corps, which until then had directly overseen 10 subordinate brigades on the base, while other bases with similar corps headquarters had active division commands for intermediate oversight. The unit oversees the 2nd and 3rd Brigade Combat Teams of the 2nd Infantry Division, {{as well as the}} 17th Field Artillery Brigade, 201st Battlefield Surveillance Brigade, 16th Combat Aviation Brigade, and 555th Engineer Brigade, about 21,000 personnel. The mission of the headquarters primarily focuses on making sure soldiers are properly trained and equipped, and that order and discipline is maintained in its subordinate brigades.|$|E
5|$|The area is {{also served}} by two {{military}} facilities, Naval Air Station Meridian and Key Field, which supply over 4,000 jobs to {{residents of the}} surrounding area. NAS Meridian provides training for naval carrier pilots and other enlisted personnel. Also housed at <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>is</b> the Regional Counter-Drug Training Academy (RCTA), which provides narcotics training for law enforcement in many southeastern states. Containing the first local Department of Homeland Security in the state, the city is the leader in a nine county regional response team and a twenty-nine county regional response task force. Key Field {{is the site of}} the famous flight by brothers Fred and Al Key, who set a world endurance flight record in 1935. Key Field is now home to the 186th Air Refueling Wing of the Air National Guard and a support facility for the 185th Aviation Brigade of the Army National Guard. The site also contains an exhibit reviewing the history of aviation, and is the home of Meridian's Aviation Museum.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>base</b> <b>was</b> {{established}} overlooking <b>the</b> Đa Krông Valley 38 km {{southeast of}} Vandegrift Combat Base 1 km north of Route 922. <b>The</b> <b>base</b> <b>was</b> named after Alfred A. Cunningham, the first Marine Corps aviator.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> naval <b>base</b> <b>was</b> {{opened in}} 1932 as HMAS Penguin IV and on 1 August 1940 it was renamed as HMAS Brisbane. <b>The</b> <b>base</b> <b>was</b> again renamed HMAS Moreton in 1942. <b>The</b> <b>base</b> <b>was</b> located at <b>the</b> corner of Merthyr Road and Gray Street, in New Farm, Brisbane and {{had its own}} wharves, {{warehouse}} buildings and assembly areas.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>base</b> <b>was</b> {{located on}} <b>the</b> {{south side of}} the estuary {{opposite}} the town of Milford Haven. <b>The</b> <b>base</b> <b>was</b> on a promontory which restricted space for buildings due to the local housing in the area.|$|R
5|$|The spire can {{be divided}} into three sections. The lower section, which is <b>the</b> <b>base,</b> <b>is</b> formed of seven {{superimposed}} layers, each layer representing a level of heaven in accordance with the Traiphum Buddhist cosmology. The middle section is {{in the shape of a}} bell; however the roundness has been flattened to create a four sided shape. This represents the stupa in which the Buddha's ashes have been interred. The top section is similar to the top of chedis, depicting a tapered lotus bud or the crystal dew drop signifying the escape from the Saṃsāra or cycle of rebirths. The spire is supported by garudas on its four sides; as well as being the symbol of kingship, the garuda represents the mythical creatures of the Himavanta forest surrounding Mount Meru.|$|E
5|$|The two copper statues, each {{standing}} 6 feet (1.8 m) tall, flank the obelisk which {{rises to}} a masonry soldier statue, {{instead of the}} typical apex of an obelisk. The figure atop the granite obelisk is a mustached American Civil War soldier dressed in a long coat, a cape, and a cap. In the figure's right hand he holds the handle of his sword and the sword's tip rests {{in front of his}} right foot. In the soldier's left hand is a flag. Below the apex of the obelisk, on the memorial's base, are two additional sculpted figures, a Union infantry soldier and a Union cavalry soldier. The Union infantryman is dressed in a cap, long coat, and a cape, much like the figure atop the obelisk. The Union cavalryman, standing {{on the east side of}} <b>the</b> <b>base,</b> <b>is</b> dressed in a brimmed hat and short jacket.|$|E
5|$|The Karma Society {{was founded}} to study God, who was losing {{his faith in}} {{humanity}} due to their behavior. Sera was the only survivor {{of a group of}} children with the ability to communicate with God. To hide from the pain of the experiments, Sera created an artificial environment that would become the Junkyard, populating it with benign versions of Karma Society staff: these artificial beings would become the Junkyard's five tribes. The original Serph manipulated Sera and his team for his own ends while the original Heat attempted to protect her: when Sera saw Serph killing Heat while linked to the EGG, God felt her pain and attacked Earth. The original Serph was overwhelmed by a flood of data and became a demon before being killed. Now knowing the truth, Serph escapes from the EGG, killing Heat in the process. Sera then decides to head for a secondary Karma facility to communicate with God: on the way, Gale dies defeating Angel, and Cielo sacrifices himself so Sera and Serph can reach the transmission site. As Sera begins transmission, <b>the</b> <b>base</b> <b>is</b> destroyed, killing her and Serph. Their data travels to the sun—the physical manifestation of God—and merges into a new being called Seraph. Aided by the data avatars of the Embryon, Seraph confronts God, fighting an avatar of him to prove humanity's worth. Upon victory, Seraph achieves enlightenment and travels with Schrödinger to new worlds, while God restores the sun and Earth. At the game's end, it is shown that the Embryon, Angel, and aspects of Sera and Serph have reincarnated, with a grown Fred acting as their caretaker.|$|E
