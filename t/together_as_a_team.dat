Martin first came on the curling scene in 1985 when his Alberta team of Richard Feeney, Dan Petryk and Michael Berger won the Canadian Junior Championships in their first year <b>together</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>team.</b> The rink (a group of players) finished the round robin in second place, with a win-loss record of 7–4, behind Prince Edward Island's Kent Scales. This forced them into a semifinal against the third place Quebec rink, skipped by Steve Gagnon. They beat Quebec 5–4, earning a spot in the final against Prince Edward Island which they won with a score of 6–3.

25|$|Fetal alcohol {{syndrome}} (FAS) is {{the first}} diagnosable condition of FASD that was discovered. FAS is the only expression of FASD that has garnered consensus among experts to become an official ICD-9 and ICD-10 diagnosis. To make this diagnosis or determine any FASD condition, a multi-disciplinary evaluation is necessary to assess {{each of the four}} key features for assessment. Generally, a trained physician will determine growth deficiency and FAS facial features. While a qualified physician may also assess central nervous system structural abnormalities and/or neurological problems, usually central nervous system damage is determined through psychological, speech-language, and occupational therapy assessments to ascertain clinically significant impairments in three or more of the Ten Brain Domains. Prenatal alcohol exposure risk may be assessed by a qualified physician, psychologist, social worker, or chemical health counselor. These professionals work <b>together</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>team</b> to assess and interpret data of each key feature for assessment and develop an integrative, multi-disciplinary report to diagnose FAS (or other FASD conditions) in an individual.|$|E

Roddenberry was immediately concerned about the series' low ratings and wrote to Harlan Ellison {{to ask if he}} could use his name in letters to the network to save the show. Not wanting to lose a potential source of income, Ellison agreed and also sought the help of other writers who also wanted to avoid losing potential income. Roddenberry corresponded with science fiction writer Isaac Asimov about how {{to address the issue of}} Spock's growing popularity and the possibility that his character would overshadow Kirk. Asimov suggested having Kirk and Spock work <b>together</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>team</b> [...] "to get people to think of Kirk when they think of Spock."

500|$|Each main {{cast member}} auditioned for Friends having had {{some degree of}} prior sitcom experience. Before finally being cast in Friends, Cox's burgeoning success as an actress had heavily relied on her {{physical}} appearance. Unlike her previous roles in projects such as Family Ties and Ace Ventura: Pet Detective, the Los Angeles Times Steve Weinstein believes that Monica {{was the first major}} role in which Cox was cast based on her abilities as a comedic actress as opposed to her beauty. Cox believes that she owes winning the role to her brief stint as Gabriella Easden on the short-lived sitcom The Trouble With Larry, which she considers to be the first time she played a character who [...] "was the funny one", which in turn earned the actress a recommendation for Friends following its cancellation. When Friends premiered, Cox was the show's most famous main cast member among a cast of young, relatively unknown actors, and was thus initially perceived by critics and audiences as the show's star, despite Crane and Kauffman's efforts to promote Friends as an ensemble comedy. According to actress Lisa Kudrow, who portrays Phoebe, Cox is responsible for suggesting that the entire cast work <b>together</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>team.</b> As the most experienced cast member at the time, Cox advised her co-stars to remain open to each other's ideas, notes and suggestions, while giving them permission to tell her [...] "If I could do anything funnier". Cox was originally the highest-paid cast member. Preferring to be treated as equals, the entire cast negotiated for universal salaries, demanding that Warner Bros. accommodate their request of $100,000 per episode in season three, increased from their original inaugural season salary of $22,000 per episode. At one point, the actors went as far as threatening to boycott their own show should their demands be denied, temporarily refusing to renew their expired contracts. The studio eventually complied, and by season 10 each actor was being paid $1 million per episode, making Cox and her female co-stars the highest-paid television actresses of all time.|$|E

A promotional video released by Starz provided background information on Esther including her college education—the character introduces herself by stating that she has a BA in Linguistics and a Masters in Cognitive science. Series four writer Jane Espenson enjoyed writing for Esther as she felt the character to be most similar to herself. She notes that when devising Esther's backstory the writer's [...] "ended up just putting my college experience down." [...] Esther's introduction invites parallels that of lead female character Gwen Cooper (Eve Myles) in the series' 2006 premiere episode [...] "Everything Changes"; she represents an audience surrogate for new American viewers. Havins refers to Esther as the [...] "tour guide" [...] for new viewers coming to Torchwood for the first time, one who is [...] "digging deeper and deeper into the rabbit hole". Despite similarities to their introduction, Havins comments that Esther as a character has a less action-orientated role than Gwen, being more the [...] "techie" [...] of the team who uses her intellect and technology as her weapons. The actress feels that Esther's desk-bound analyst position is [...] "her safe little world". Head writer and executive producer Russell T Davies described Esther as [...] "a very healing force" [...] in helping the other more outspoken characters gel <b>together</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>team</b> because she is [...] "much more able to empathise with people." [...] The character's sister, Sarah Drummond (Candace Brown), recurs throughout Miracle Day, Havins feels that her presence helps [...] "humanise the situation" [...] as including family members helps the audience [...] "understand why people react a certain way." [...] Espenson notes that the first scene between Esther and Sarah was discussed at length at the writer's room—the writers chose to make Esther's choice whether or not to refer her ill sister to social services [...] "as difficult as possible" [...] to heighten the pain felt by the character.|$|E

Winners team won the match, keeping him from having to defend his mask in a match. Eight days later at Triplemanía III-B, Winners' mask was on the line in a match against Marabunta; Winners defeated Marabunta in a Luchas de Apuestas, Mask vs. Mask match. On June 30, 1995, at Triplemanía III-C, Winners participated in another [...] "mask vs. mask" [...] match, his third in three weeks. This time, Winners was not successful, as he lost to Super Caló and was forced to unmask. The loss of the mask did not hurt Winners' popularity, on the contrary it intensified as the hansome Palomeque became even more popular with the female fans. Despite losing his mask to Super Caló the two continued to work <b>together</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>team.</b> On June 15, 1996, Winners and Caló teamed up with Rey Misterio, Jr. and Oro, Jr. to defeat the team of Perro Silva, Halloween, Kraken, and Mosco de la Merced at Triplemanía IV-B.
