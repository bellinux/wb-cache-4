5|$|In September 2009, Đuric {{agreed to}} join Sriwijaya of the Indonesian Super League for a {{reported}} US$110,000 a season contract. However, a month later, he told the press that he declined the offer in the end because Sriwijaya tried to change the <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>contract</b> which was mutually agreed upon.|$|E
5|$|In February 1998, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Ricardo Torres {{dismissed}} Coppola's claim. Although Torres {{agreed that}} Sagan violated some <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>contract,</b> {{he explained that}} Coppola waited too long to file his lawsuit, and that the contract might not be enforceable as it was written. Coppola then appealed his suit, {{taking it to the}} California Courts of Appeal (CCA). In April 2000, the CCA dismissed his suit, finding that Coppola’s claims were barred because they were brought too late. The court noted that it was not until 1994 that the filmmaker thought about suing over Contact.|$|E
5|$|In September 2000, Tillingbourne {{controversially}} {{reduced the}} number of journeys on contracted route 516, which linked Dorking, Leatherhead and Epsom. Although this was within the <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>contract,</b> it was criticised by residents of intermediate villages, who claimed the communities relied in particular on a cancelled morning journey. Operations were moved to a new larger site, still located in Cranleigh, in February 2001. The company believed this would reduce operating costs and allow for future expansion.|$|E

Under the <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>contract,</b> his salary was donated to support the youth club of the team. Having not played a competitive match since 21 June of the previous year, he played his first match of the season on 23 February, coming on as a substitute in the 0–0 home draw with Dynamo České Budějovice. He scored a hat-trick in Ostrava's 3–0 league victory against Hradec Králové on 9 March 2013, his first hat-trick in the top flight of Czech football.|$|E
5|$|On April 8, 2010, Stevens {{signed a}} {{long-term}} deal with Butler, extending his contract through the 2021–22 season. Financial <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>contract</b> were not disclosed; however, Butler president Bobby Fong had publicly {{stated that the}} university could afford to increase Stevens' base salary to approximately US $1,000,000 a few days prior. Stevens had previously made US$395,000 plus benefits in base salary, a relatively low figure for a successful Division I head basketball coach. His total compensation for 2009–10 was estimated at US$750,000. Stevens had received a raise after each of his three seasons at Butler and his contract contains a buyout clause estimated in the high six or low seven figures.|$|E
5|$|Allardyce was {{appointed}} manager of Bolton Wanderers following Colin Todd's departure, who had resigned in protest at {{the sale of}} Per Frandsen as the club attempted {{to raise funds for}} the new Reebok Stadium. He inherited a talented squad, which included Eiður Guðjohnsen, Jussi Jääskeläinen, Mark Fish, Claus Jensen, Dean Holdsworth, Bo Hansen, Michael Johansen, and Ricardo Gardner. However he was forced to sell Andy Todd, son of Colin Todd, after he broke assistant manager Phil Brown's jaw in a team bonding session. Despite being in {{the bottom half of the}} table when he took over, Bolton reached the 1999–2000 Division One play-offs, losing to Ipswich Town, and had an eventful run to the League Cup and FA Cup semi-finals, only missing out on the 2000 FA Cup Final after a penalty shoot-out defeat to Aston Villa. He blamed referee Barry Knight for the play-off defeat, who he accused of being biased against Bolton. Allardyce was rewarded for turning the club around with a ten-year contract, though the <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>contract</b> only entitled him to a one year's compensation pay if he was sacked.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of Burger King's actions, Hungry Jack's owner Jack Cowin and his private holding company Competitive Foods Australia began legal {{proceedings}} in 2001 against Burger King's parent Burger King Corporation with a counter-claim {{that the company had}} violated the conditions of the master franchising agreement and was in breach of the contract. In a decision handed down by the Supreme Court of New South Wales that affirmed Cowin's claims, Burger King was determined to have violated the <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>contract</b> and as a result was required to pay Cowin and Hungry Jack's a $46.9million (Aus, $41.6million USD 2001) award. The court's decision {{was one of the first}} major cases in Australia that implied that the American legal concept of good faith negotiations existed with the framework of the Australian legal system, which until that verdict, had rarely been seen in the country's courts. In its decision, the Court stated that Burger King had failed to act in good faith during contract negotiations by seeking to include standards and clauses that would engineer a default of the franchise agreement, allowing the company to limit the number of new Hungry Jack’s branded restaurants and ultimately claim the Australian market as its own, a purpose that was extraneous to the agreement.|$|E
5|$|Davis was not re-signed by the Eagles {{following}} the 1995 season {{and became an}} unrestricted free agent. He worked out for the Atlanta Falcons on April 25, 1996. After disagreeing on the <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>contract,</b> Davis signed with the Falcons on May 13 and agreed to a two-year contract worth $1.9 million. The contract contained a $200,000 signing bonus and a $300,000 workout bonus {{to go along with}} a $1.4 million base salary, and up to $300,000 in incentives based on playing time. He began the 1996 season as a backup behind David Richards at right tackle. Davis started in place of the injured Richards for a week five game against the San Francisco 49ers on September 29. Richards came back from his injury in week six, but he and Davis split playing time in weeks seven and eight against the Houston Oilers and Dallas Cowboys, respectively. Richards was waived on October 23 by the Falcons, who decided to go with Davis at right tackle {{for the remainder of the}} year. Davis suffered a right ankle sprain in a week sixteen game against the St. Louis Rams on December 15.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{questions}} on the later years of Cairano's career {{is that of the}} completion of the Martinengo mausoleum, the largest funereal monument of the Brescian renaissance. The commission to the jeweller and sculptor Bernardino delle Croci by the brothers Francesco and Antonio Il Martinengo of Padernello dated to 1503, with a term of three years for completion. The tomb was to house the remains of Bernardino Martinengo, the father of the two, who had left a bequest towards the work on his death in 1501 or 1502. However, it was still unfinished in 1516, when delle Croci was commissioned per a new contract to finish it by January 1518. The causes for the delay appear to have been, firstly, a commercial dispute between the jeweller and the clients, and secondly the war of 1512, which surely slowed the work, even if not entirely stopping it. It was not until 1516, following the reconquest of Brescia by the Venetian republic, that a new definitive agreement was made. The documents are incomplete but in fact the monument was completed and installed within the Corpus Christi church, probably within the <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>contract.</b>|$|E

5|$|Since 1863, Verne {{had been}} under {{contract}} with the publisher Pierre-Jules Hetzel, who published each of his novels, beginning with Five Weeks in a Balloon (1863) and Journey to the Center of the Earth (1864) and continuing {{through the rest of}} his books to form the novel sequence Hetzel called the Voyages Extraordinaires. The arrangement gave Verne prominence as a novelist and a certain amount of financial stability, but under the <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>contract</b> Verne's profits barely earned him a living wage. Verne's fortunes changed markedly in 1874, when the stage adaptation of his novel Around the World in Eighty Days was a smash hit, running for 415 performances in its original production and quickly making Verne wealthy as well as famous as a playwright. Adapted with the collaboration of the showman d'Ennery, the play invented and codified the pièce de grand spectacle, an extravagant theatrical genre that became intensely popular in Paris throughout {{the last quarter of the}} nineteenth century. Verne and d'Ennery went on to adapt two other Verne novels, The Children of Captain Grant and Michael Strogoff, as similarly spectacular plays.|$|E

25|$|This {{raises the}} {{question}} why does an employer ever do {{more than it is}} legally obliged to do ?

50|$|Through a {{wholesale}} contract a property owner {{is able to}} receive a guaranteed sum over <b>the</b> <b>term</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>contract.</b> This takes <b>the</b> risk out <b>of</b> trying to rent the property him or herself, often with financial discount.
