Each of these programs has its own unique reporting requirements, so the school system needs a method to separately identify the related revenues and expenditures.

25|$|The Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale, {{sometimes}} shortened to the CMAS, {{was created}} in 1956. This scale was closely modeled after the Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale. It was developed so that the TMAS {{could be applied to}} a broader range of people, specifically children. Kitano tested the validity of the CMAS by comparing students who were placed in special education classes versus those placed in regular classrooms. Kitano proposed the idea that children who were in special education classes {{were more likely to have}} higher anxiety than those in regular classrooms. Using the CMAS, Kitano found boys tested in <b>the</b> <b>special</b> <b>education</b> classes had higher anxiety scores than their regular classroom counterparts. Hafner tested the reliability of the CMAS with the knowledge that the TMAS had a feminine bias. Hafner found that the CMAS did not have a female bias. He only found two questions that females always scored higher on than their male counterparts. As the test stands now, the suggestion is to compare the female and male participants separately. Castaneda found significant differences across different grade levels, indicating that as students develop they are affected differentially by various stressors.|$|E
25|$|Oftentimes, schools simply {{lack the}} {{resources}} to create an optimal classroom setting for those in need of special education.

In some cases, the extra cost required to educate a child with autism nearly doubles the average cost to educate the average public school student. As the range of those with autism can widely vary, {{it is very difficult to}} create an autism program that is well suited to the entire population of autistics as well as those with other disabilities. In the United States, many school districts are requiring schools to meet the needs of disabled students, regardless of the number of children with disabilities there are in the school.
