5|$|The 1969 {{tour was}} a three Test series. <b>The</b> <b>captains</b> were Ray Illingworth for England and Sobers for the West Indies. The West Indies had an ageing team and, with Sobers {{suffering}} {{a loss of}} form, were always the weaker side.|$|E
5|$|About 815 emigrants {{from the}} first two ships were {{organized}} into the first three handcart companies, headed by captains Edmund Ellsworth, Daniel D.

5|$|At 06:00 on 26 April 1797, the 74-gun ship of {{the line}} HMS Irresistible under Captain George Martin and the 36-gun frigate HMS Emerald under Captain Velterers Cornewall Berkeley were sailing at the {{southern}} edge of Jervis' (now known as Earl St. Vincent) fleet. While cruising close to the Spanish coast two unknown ships were sighted. Martin immediately ordered his ships to give chase and the strangers fled with Martin's vessels in pursuit. The new arrivals were two Spanish 34-gun frigates, the Santa Elena and Ninfa, bound to Cádiz from Havana with a cargo of silver specie. <b>The</b> <b>captains</b> of these Spanish ships had unwittingly sailed into the midst of the blockade fleet the previous night, but had had a fortunate encounter with a Spanish fishing vessel which had warned them of the danger. Acting quickly, <b>the</b> <b>captains</b> off-loaded their treasure into the fishing boat with instructions to carry it safely into Cádiz.|$|E

25|$|As the {{aircraft}} approached Kaimana, <b>the</b> <b>Captain</b> gave several {{instructions to the}} First Officer related to the direction, speed, altitude and power setting of {{the aircraft}}. This type of interaction between <b>the</b> <b>Captain</b> and <b>the</b> First Officer suggested a steep trans-cockpit authority gradient in which the First Officer may not challenge the decisions and actions of <b>the</b> <b>Captain.</b> <b>The</b> <b>Captain</b> may have lack of trust to the First Officer, as indicated by giving the First Officer handling instructions and took over the control during {{the final phase of}} the approach.

5|$|The Campbells {{continued}} {{to add to}} the castle, building a new house over the old west range in 1725. However, the rest of the castle was already decaying. In 1810 an accidental fire gutted the castle, and <b>the</b> <b>Captains</b> ceased to live here, moving to Dunstaffnage House, some 2km to the south-east, until this too burned down in 1940. Tenants lived in the 1725 house within the castle until 1888.|$|E
5|$|Benbow's {{fame and}} success earned him both public notoriety and a {{promotion}} to admiral. He was then {{involved in an}} incident during the Action of August 1702, where {{a number of his}} captains refused to support him while commanding a squadron of ships. Benbow instigated the trial and later imprisonment or execution of a number of <b>the</b> <b>captains</b> involved, though he did not live to see these results. These events contributed to his notoriety, and led to several references to him in subsequent popular culture.|$|E
5|$|Lejoille's {{published}} {{account of}} the action greatly exaggerated the scale of his success, and, although he was highly praised in the French press, he was castigated in Britain for his conduct. Thompson, Berry {{and most of the}} British officers were exchanged and acquitted at court martial, and <b>the</b> <b>captains</b> were knighted for their services, while Leander and many of the crew were recaptured in March 1799 by a Russian squadron that seized Corfu, and returned to British control by order of Tsar Paul. Généreux survived another year in the Mediterranean, but was eventually captured off Malta in 1800 by a British squadron under Lord Nelson.|$|E

50|$|The two way {{communication}} between Kaimana AFIS {{and the crew}} was conducted normally and also did {{not contribute to the}} accident. However, limited communications were noted, only few conversation between <b>the</b> <b>Captain</b> and <b>the</b> First Officer. When <b>the</b> <b>Captain</b> gave important commands to the First Officer, he did not use standard phraseology as stated in the Company Operation Manual. The CVR revealed limited conversation between <b>the</b> <b>Captain</b> and <b>the</b> First Officer. This situation is uncommon in a good cockpit environment. It was known that <b>the</b> <b>Captain</b> had served <b>the</b> company for more than 30 years while the First Officer was a newly recruited pilot.As the aircraft approached Kaimana, <b>the</b> <b>Captain</b> gave several instructions to the First Officer related to the direction, speed, altitude and power setting of the aircraft.

5|$|On 15 February 1500, Cabral was {{appointed}} Capitão-mor (literally Major-Captain, or commander-in-chief) of a fleet sailing for India. It {{was then the}} custom for the Portuguese Crown to appoint nobles to naval and military commands, regardless of experience or professional competence. This {{was the case for}} <b>the</b> <b>captains</b> of the ships under Cabral's command—most were nobles like himself. The practice had obvious pitfalls, since authority could as easily be given to highly incompetent and unfit people as it could fall to talented leaders such as Afonso de Albuquerque or Dom João de Castro.|$|E
5|$|Renown {{collided}} with Hood on 23 January 1935 while on exercises {{off the coast}} of Spain. The damage to her bow was temporarily repaired at Gibraltar and the ship sailed to Portsmouth for permanent repairs between February and May. <b>The</b> <b>captains</b> of both ships were court-martialled, as was the squadron commander, Rear Admiral Sidney Bailey. Bailey and Hoods Captain Tower were acquitted, but Renowns Captain Sawbridge was relieved of command. The Admiralty dissented from the verdict, reinstated Sawbridge, and criticised Bailey for ambiguous signals during the manoeuvre.|$|E
5|$|The Killigrews {{controlled}} the castle for several decades, with John Killigrew's son and grandson continuing in turn as the captain there until 1605. <b>The</b> <b>captains</b> of Pendennis frequently argued {{with those of}} St Mawes and in 1630 a legal dispute broke out about the rights to search and detain incoming shipping: both castles argued {{that they had a}} traditional right to do so. The Admiralty eventually issued a compromise, proposing that the castles share the searching of the traffic.|$|E
60|$|But {{it did not}} go off {{so easily}} with me, for now, in a word, the clouds began to thicken about me, and I had alarms on every side.

5|$|While Hopkins was {{initially}} lauded {{for the success}} at Nassau, the failure to capture the Glasgow and crew complaints about some of <b>the</b> <b>captains</b> led {{to a variety of}} investigations and courts martial. As a result of these, the Providence captain was relieved of his command, which was given to Jones. Jones, who had performed well in the Glasgow encounter in spite of a crew reduced by disease, thereafter received a captain's commission in the Continental Navy.|$|E
5|$|While his {{subordinates}} were on constant patrol, the Bearer of the Mace personally inspected the city three times each month.

The Bearer of the Mace had a large staff of subordinates during Western Han, whose posts were abolished or transferred elsewhere during Eastern Han. This included the abolition of <b>the</b> <b>Captains</b> of the Standard Bearers, and the emperor's entourage became responsible for clearing the roadways when the emperor left the palace and hoisting colored standards to signal his return.|$|E
5|$|A {{court of}} enquiry was held the {{following}} month in Liverpool by the Board of Trade, and focused particularly on the roles of <b>the</b> <b>captains</b> in the tragedy {{as well as the}} design of the Liverpool lifeboat. The court found that no-one was to blame for the loss of either Ellen Southard or the Liverpool lifeboat. Captain James Martin and his crew were praised for their gallantry in getting everyone off the ship, and absolved of any blame with respect to the capsizing of the lifeboat. The lifeboat was furthermore found to be of sound design and suitably adapted to her role, but debate continued for many years about the merits of the tubular design vs the self-righting one, as well as the requirement for lifeboats to be powered.|$|E

5|$|Although {{his career}} was over, Rotheram {{continued}} to request sea service and honours from the Admiralty, becoming increasingly irate and intemperate in his demands. At the reorganising of the knightly orders in 1815, a number of senior naval officers were given knighthoods, but Rotheram was only made a Companion of the Order of the Bath, a step below knighthood. He retired to Bildeston in Suffolk and from there continued to request appointments, finally being made one of <b>the</b> <b>captains</b> of the Greenwich Naval Hospital in 1828. Rotheram died at Bildeston in 1830 and {{was buried in the}} churchyard of St Mary Magdelene just outside the village, where his grave and a memorial plaque are still legible today.

In 2010, the son of Kosta Hadži, the chief of Yugoslav delegation at the 1930 World Cup and the vice-president of the Football Association of Yugoslavia at the time, claimed that Yugoslavia, as a team, has been awarded one bronze medal, which has been kept by Hadži himself and his family for the following 80 years.

Among the goods removed from the ships were the £500,000 worth of silk, which was stored in warehouses near the docks. In the British raid on Saint Paul on 21 September 1809, these warehouses and their contents were burnt and Caroline, Streatham and Europe all captured by the raiding force. Despite these subsequent losses, Féretier was highly commended for his leadership in the action and received a promotion from Governor Charles Decaen.
