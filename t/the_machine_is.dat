5|$|Princess Bubblegum {{demonstrates}} {{to company}} a device capable of time travel. Lumpy Space Princess {{comes in and}} demands Bubblegum transport Lumpy back to {{when she and her}} ex were still in love. Bubblegum explains that <b>the</b> <b>machine</b> <b>is</b> only capable of logging molecules of a given entity. Lumpy attacks her, and Bubblegum forces her to leave.|$|E
5|$|The game {{features}} amplified monaural {{sound and}} pixel graphics on a CRT monitor. A Motorola 6809 {{central processing unit}} handles the graphics and gameplay, while a Motorola 6800 microprocessor handles the audio. A pack of three AA batteries provide power to save the game's settings and high scores when <b>the</b> <b>machine</b> <b>is</b> unplugged from an electrical outlet. The cabinet artwork is stenciled on the wooden frame.|$|E
5|$|Joust was {{developed}} by Williams Electronics, with John Newcomer as the lead designer. Programmer Bill Pfutzenrueter and artists Jan Hendricks and Python Anghelo assisted him. Tim Murphy and John Kotlarik handled the audio design. The game features amplified monaural sound and raster graphics on a 19-inch color CRT monitor. Like other Williams arcade games, Joust was programmed in assembly language. A pack of three AA batteries provide power to save the game's settings and high scores when <b>the</b> <b>machine</b> <b>is</b> unplugged from an electrical outlet. The cabinet artwork, by Anghelo, is stenciled on a wooden frame. Anghelo also designed artwork for promotional materials; one such flyer featured archaic English, which was also incorporated into the game's onscreen instructions and game-over message.|$|E
50|$|Venn built rare <b>machines.</b> <b>The</b> {{function}} of <b>the</b> <b>machine</b> <b>was</b> to bowl cricket balls. <b>The</b> <b>machine</b> <b>was</b> so fascinating {{that when the}} Australians <b>were</b> visiting Cambridge, <b>the</b> <b>machines</b> <b>were</b> used to entertain them. The bowl cricket ball that Venn built actually bowled out the top ranked player of the team four times consecutively.|$|R
5000|$|The project lost {{funding in}} 1978. <b>The</b> <b>machine</b> <b>was</b> {{disassembled}} and {{remained at the}} University of Miami until 1997. At that time, <b>the</b> <b>machine</b> <b>was</b> moved to Lanham Md and reassembled for the CMTX project ( [...] see reference [...] ). The current status {{of the project and}} <b>the</b> <b>machine</b> <b>are</b> unknown.|$|R
50|$|Interest in <b>the</b> <b>machine</b> <b>was</b> revived in <b>the</b> 1990s, {{as it was}} {{realised}} {{that many}} of its developers were aging and history was being lost forever. A conference about <b>the</b> <b>machine</b> <b>was</b> held in 1996.|$|R
5|$|Meanwhile, Perry the Platypus {{arrives at}} an {{abandoned}} cake factory, {{where he is}} trapped in a vat of cake mix. His nemesis, Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz, appears and explains that today is his birthday. All throughout his life, his parents never showed up to his birthday parties (even his own birth); now, he plans on using a hypnotic device to force everyone to celebrate his birthday. He then rides off with the invention on a flying machine. Perry escapes from the mix and follows after him. In the air, Perry and Doofenshmirtz fight and <b>the</b> <b>machine</b> <b>is</b> activated, but while trying to get Perry {{to let go of}} the wall of the flying machine he accidentally makes the machine malfunction, causing the people below to still not want to celebrate his birthday. Doofenshmirtz, defeated, drops the ice cream cone he is eating in the fight and it falls to the ground below.|$|E
5|$|The {{nations of}} the world fund the {{construction}} of the machine at Cape Canaveral. An international panel is assembled to choose a candidate to travel in the machine. Although Arroway is a frontrunner to go, her hopes are scuppered by Christian philosopher Palmer Joss, a panel member whom Arroway met and briefly became romantically involved with in Puerto Rico. When he brings attention to her atheism, the panel selects Drumlin instead on the belief he would be more representative of humanity. However, on the day <b>the</b> <b>machine</b> <b>is</b> tested, a religious fanatic destroys the machine in a suicide bombing, killing Drumlin and many others.|$|E
5|$|There is some {{spiraling}} of {{the tool}} as it cuts, so the form {{at the bottom of}} the workpiece may be rotated with respect to the form at the top of the hole or profile. Spiraling may be undesirable because it binds the body {{of the tool}} and prevents it from cutting sharply. One solution to this is to reverse the rotation in mid cut, causing the tool to spiral in the opposite direction. If reversing <b>the</b> <b>machine</b> <b>is</b> not practical, then interrupting the cut is another possible solution.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> wool combing <b>machine</b> <b>was</b> {{invented by}} Edmund Cartwright, the {{inventor}} of the power loom, in Doncaster. It was patented on 1790. This <b>machine</b> <b>was</b> used to arrange and lay parallel by length the fibers of wool, prior to further treatment. <b>The</b> <b>machine</b> <b>was</b> important in <b>the</b> mechanization of the textile industry. <b>The</b> <b>machine</b> <b>was</b> refined by many later inventors.|$|R
40|$|The {{design and}} {{fabrication}} of a centrifugal casting <b>machine</b> <b>was</b> successfully carried out. The operation of <b>the</b> <b>machine</b> <b>was</b> based on <b>the</b> principle of centrifugal force. Suitable design theory, analysis and calculation were adopted {{carried out in}} the course of the work. The mold is bolted to the base plate which can rotate at moderatespeeds thereby forcing the molten metal against the inner walls of <b>the</b> mold. This <b>machine</b> could <b>be</b> used to cast small engineering components. The centrifugal force on <b>the</b> <b>machine</b> <b>was</b> determined to be 3207. 3 N, while the required power on <b>the</b> <b>machine</b> <b>was</b> 854. 7 W. A test was carried out on the fabricated centrifugal casting machine with aluminum alloy and <b>the</b> <b>machine</b> <b>was</b> able to cast 6 kg of aluminum alloy and the casting was successful...|$|R
50|$|In May 1928, <b>the</b> <b>machine</b> <b>was</b> {{modified}} as a racer, with equi-span {{wings of}} 28 ft (8.53 m) and revised struts and ailerons; it was {{fitted with a}} 553 hp (412 kW) Lion. <b>The</b> <b>machine</b> <b>was</b> subsequently redesignated Avro 567 Avenger II.|$|R
5|$|Walter and Walternate (Noble) {{start the}} Machine {{equipment}} to overload, {{which will take}} several minutes, after which they can pull the power and deactivate the Machine. Lee states to Peter (Joshua Jackson) {{that he will be}} staying in the parallel universe, where he feels at home, reflecting a previous conversation Peter had with Lee about staying with Olivia in the prime universe. Walter and Walternate have a heartfelt discussion over Peter, and Walter expresses concern that if the bridge disappears, so will Peter. The other Fringe members say their goodbyes to their counterparts. Eventually, <b>the</b> <b>Machine</b> <b>is</b> overloaded and deactivated, and the parallel universe aspects of the room disappear; Walter is pleased to see Peter remains.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the two new cups, {{it is also possible}} to create custom cups. The disk can save up to a hundred tracks and up to three ghost racers per course. IGN singled out the track creator as the F-Zero X Expansion Kits strongest feature since it is virtually the same tool the designers of F-Zero X used for themselves to create the original circuits. The Car Editor offers a variety of options when creating a vehicle. Using a set of pre-existing parts, the player must balance their creations' settings and performance abilities before <b>the</b> <b>machine</b> <b>is</b> finished and named. The Track Editor is a detailed track creator that allows the player to design their own racing circuits. Using a cursor, the player can determine the basic layout of the track and also add points to it to create track elements such as curves and hills. Furthermore, numerous different properties like half pipes and cylinders, as well as numerous road surfaces, such as slip zones, can be added. The player can test the creation at any time and run practice laps.|$|E
5|$|With Max Capricorn dead, the Heavenly Host divert to {{the next}} highest authority, the Doctor, and aid him in quickly {{reaching}} the bridge. Together with Midshipman Frame, he uses {{the heat from the}} entry into the Earth's atmosphere to restart the ship's auxiliary engines. The ship stabilises and narrowly avoids a collision with Buckingham Palace. The Doctor then realizes that Astrid was wearing a teleport bracelet when she fell into the engine. In an emergency, the teleport bracelets were programmed to hold a person's molecular pattern in stasis until it can be recovered. The Doctor frantically attempts to retrieve Astrid's pattern, but <b>the</b> <b>machine</b> <b>is</b> too badly damaged. The Doctor reluctantly allows the ghostly remains of Astrid's atoms to dissipate into space. As the surviving passengers wait for rescue, the Doctor and Mr. Copper, who would otherwise be sent to prison for committing fraud {{in order to get a}} job with the company, teleport to Earth and find that the TARDIS has landed unharmed in an snowy field, thrown from the ship after the collision. Mr. Copper is left to live on Earth with a credit card preloaded with Â£1,000,000, thanks to the Doctor.|$|E
5000|$|The {{design for}} this <b>machine,</b> which <b>was</b> {{designated}} <b>the</b> Converter M-228, or SIGCUM, {{was given to}} the Teletype Corporation, who were also producing SIGABA. Rowlett recommended that the adoption of <b>the</b> <b>machine</b> <b>be</b> postponed until after a study of its cryptographic security, but SIGCUM was urgently needed by the Army, and <b>the</b> <b>machine</b> <b>was</b> put into production. Rowlett then proposed that <b>the</b> <b>machine</b> used in <b>the</b> Pentagon code room be monitored by connecting a page-printing [...] "spy machine". The output could be then studied to establish whether <b>the</b> <b>machine</b> <b>was</b> resistant to attack. Rowlett's suggestion was implemented at the same time <b>the</b> first M-228 <b>machines</b> <b>were</b> installed at <b>the</b> Pentagon in January 1943, used for the Washington-Algiers link.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Chi <b>Machine</b> <b>is</b> {{a passive}} aerobic {{exercise}} device, developed and first manufactured in Japan by Skylite Industry company president and engineer, Keiichi Ohashi, in 1988. <b>The</b> Chi <b>Machine</b> <b>was</b> granted a patent by the Japanese Patent Office December 18, 1990. <b>The</b> <b>machine</b> <b>was</b> originally known as Sun Harmony and later changed to Sun Ancon.|$|R

25|$|Set-up reduction: {{typically}} {{necessary to}} achieve mixed model production, a key distinction can be made between internal and external setup. Internal setups (e.g. removing a die) refers to tasks when <b>the</b> <b>machine</b> <b>is</b> not working, while external setups can be completed while <b>the</b> <b>machine</b> <b>is</b> running (ex:transporting dies).|$|E
25|$|And so, by this construction, <b>the</b> <b>machine</b> <b>is</b> equally {{fitted to}} show either the real {{motion of the}} earth, or the {{apparent}} motion of the heaven.|$|E
25|$|A four-slide {{is quite}} {{different}} from most other presses. The key of <b>the</b> <b>machine</b> <b>is</b> its moving slides that have tools attached, which strike the workpiece together or in sequence to form it. These slides are driven by four shafts that outline the machine. The shafts are connected by bevel gears so that one shaft is driven by an electric motor, and then that shaft's motion drives the other three shafts. Each shaft then has cams which drive the slides, usually of a split-type. This shafting arrangement allows the workpiece to be worked for four sides, which makes this machine extremely versatile. A hole near the center of <b>the</b> <b>machine</b> <b>is</b> provided to expel the completed workpiece.|$|E
30|$|All <b>the</b> <b>machines</b> <b>are</b> {{available}} at time zero.|$|R

50|$|Developed by Nicola Sabbatini, <b>the</b> <b>machine</b> <b>was</b> an {{effective}} way to give the appearance of a wave-filled sea. It was used to great effect through the following centuries. <b>The</b> <b>machine</b> <b>was</b> documented in Practica di Fabricar Scene e Machine ne' Teatri as the third method of showing a sea.|$|R
25|$|What Parkinson's {{contribution}} {{to the development of}} the modern roller printing machine really was is not known with certainty, but it was possibly the invention of the delicate adjustment known as the box wheel, whereby the rollers can be turned, whilst <b>the</b> <b>machine</b> <b>is</b> in motion, either in or against the direction of their rotation.|$|E
25|$|A four-slide, {{also known}} as a multislide, multi-slide, or four-way, is a {{metalworking}} machine tool used in the high-volume manufacture of small stamped components from bar or wire stock. The press is most simply described as a horizontal stamping press that uses cams to control tools. <b>The</b> <b>machine</b> <b>is</b> used for progressive or transfer stamping operations.|$|E
25|$|A finite {{state machine}} {{can be used as}} a {{representation}} of a Markov chain. Assuming a sequence of independent and identically distributed input signals (for example, symbols from a binary alphabet chosen by coin tosses), if <b>the</b> <b>machine</b> <b>is</b> in state y at time n, then the probability that it moves to state x at time n+1 depends only on the current state.|$|E
50|$|In 1962, the Philco 2000 Model 212 {{computer}} {{was chosen for}} use in the North American Aerospace Defense Command's famous Cheyenne Mountain Complex. Three of <b>the</b> <b>machines</b> <b>were</b> installed that year and ran until 1980. <b>The</b> <b>machines</b> <b>were</b> also used by research labs at Westinghouse Electric and General Electric.|$|R
50|$|This {{redesigned}} {{version of}} the M-228 was put into service by April 1943. However, <b>the</b> <b>machine</b> <b>was</b> judged to be secure enough to handle traffic only up to SECRET by landline, and to CONFIDENTIAL by radio. <b>The</b> <b>machine</b> <b>was</b> also shared with the United Kingdom for joint communications.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>machine</b> <b>was</b> {{purchased}} in early 1952 and arrived in early 1952, before Worsley rejoined the Centre. She <b>was</b> aware of <b>the</b> <b>machine's</b> arrival, and christened it FERUT for [...] "Ferranti Electronic computer at the University of Toronto". <b>The</b> <b>machine</b> <b>was</b> operational by <b>the</b> summer, providing the UofT {{with one of}} the most powerful computers in the world.|$|R
25|$|The {{difference}} engine {{consists of}} a number of columns, numbered from 1 to N. <b>The</b> <b>machine</b> <b>is</b> able to store one decimal number in each column. The machine can only add the value of a column n+1 to column n to produce the new value of n. Column N can only store a , column 1 displays (and possibly prints) the value of the calculation on the current iteration.|$|E
25|$|The {{workpieces}} {{are brought}} {{together and the}} user marks the location for the biscuits. Precise measurement is not required, as the biscuits are hidden when the pieces are assembled, so a quick pencil stroke that marks both pieces where they align {{is all that is}} required. The parts are separated and <b>the</b> <b>machine</b> <b>is</b> used to cut the slots in each piece. The machine has reference marks on the center line of the blade for easy alignment to the marks on the materials being joined.|$|E
25|$|The iron lung, {{also known}} as the Drinker and Shaw tank, was {{developed}} in 1929 {{and was one of the}} first negative-pressure machines used for long-term ventilation. It was refined and used in the 20th century largely as a result of the polio epidemic that struck the world in the 1940s. <b>The</b> <b>machine</b> <b>is,</b> in effect, a large elongated tank, which encases the patient up to the neck. The neck is sealed with a rubber gasket so that the patient's face (and airway) are exposed to the room air.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>machines</b> <b>were</b> {{taken to}} <b>the</b> Ynares Center where losing presidential {{candidates}} John Carlos de los Reyes, Jamby Madrigal and Nicanor Perlas opened <b>the</b> <b>machines,</b> an act {{in which the}} commission described as [...] "illegal" [...] {{and said that they}} will press charges against <b>the</b> three. <b>The</b> <b>machines</b> <b>were</b> later transferred to the custody of the Senate President.|$|R
