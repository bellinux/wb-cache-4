40|$|RNA {{structure}} {{is at the}} forefront of our understanding of the origin of life, and the mechanisms of life regulation and control. RNA plays a primordial role in some viruses. Our knowledge of the importance of RNA in cellular regulation is relatively new, and this knowledge, along with the detailed structural elucidation of the <b>transcription</b> <b>machine,</b> the ribosome, has propelled interest in understanding RNA to a level which starts to closely resemble that given to proteins and DNA. In the process of progressively understanding the landscape of functionality of such a com-plex polymer as RNA, one practical task left to the structural chemist is to understand the details of how structure relates to large-scale polymer processes. With this in mind the fundamental problems which fuel the work described in this thesis are those of the conformations which RNA’s assume in nature, and the aim to understand how RNA folds. The RNA folding problem can be understood as a mechanical problem. Therefore efforts to determine its solution are not foreign to the use of statistical mechanical methods combined with detailed knowledge of atomic level structure. Such methodology is mainly used in this work in a long-term effort to understand the intrinsic structural features of RNA, and how they migh...|$|E

This study investigated the effect of light levels on client self-disclosure. The sample consisted of 30 women clients ranging in age from 18 - 29 who were students enrolled at Northern Illinois University in DeKalb, IL. These clients were self-referred or recruited from courses in the field of human services, and received counseling at the Counseling Laboratory located in Graham Hall. Counselors who participated in the study were part of a master's level practicum class. Counseling sessions were conducted in low or high light levels. The effect of light levels was examined by the number of client "I" statements, number of words spoken by the client, and number of client affective words. A semantic differential that measured client attitude of the counseling session was completed by clients {{at the end of the}} second counseling session. To obtain the necessary client self-disclosure, a 10 -minute segment of the second counseling session was audio taped. The 10 -minute segment corresponded to the 20 - 30 minute segment of an hour-long session. The audio tape was then transcribed by the experimenter using a <b>transcription</b> <b>machine</b> and computer. Tabulation of the client self-disclosure measures was accomplished using the "search to count words" function that was part of the 1986 computer software program IBM Writing Assistant Version 2. 0. Client self-disclosure data was analyzed using Analysis of Co-Variance, while semantic differential data was analyzed using t-tests. Results indicated that light levels had no effect on number of client "I" statements, number of client words, and number of client affective words.

40|$|One of the {{important}} issues in computational linguistics is to design systems for speech recognition and <b>machine</b> <b>transcription</b> {{which can be used}} for various types of spoken data. In manual as well as in <b>machine</b> <b>transcription</b> in particular, names as such are of great importance when addressing people, locations, and objects. In order to communicate names between language communities with different writing systems we have to transcribe or romanise the names into the corresponding writing systems. Names tend to show a certain intrinsic grade of variation, and this is even more the case for their transliterated or transcribed forms. Correct transcription and transliteration of names {{is one of the major}} problems in cross-cultural communication. Available standard manual transcription systems are often used inconsistently, or simply not used at all. Many computer-based transcription systems use orthographic forms or pronunciation, rule based and statistical approaches. In this paper the authors propose an automatic transcription model for multilingual transcription systems. This model uses four advanced methods or tools: (1) a syllable pronunciation and segmentation model with rule based multi-lingual pronunciation, (2) a rule based approach with IPA (International Phonetic Alphabet) representation that is converted to different writing systems, (3) an ontology of phonemes to capture the phonetic qualities of characters for different languages, and (4) a phonetic based name matching algorithm called Meta-Sound (a combination of Metaphone and Soundex algorithms) for constructing the thesaurus of transcriptions to get different name variations of a specific name dynamically. This algorithm is designed for different language specific naming conventions, and it helps to produce highly accurate matches. The model is not only used for romanisation but also for the transcription into other writing systems, e. g. the Thai writing system. 1...|$|R

With FORM we explore new ways of exploiting musical repetition for structural segmentation, yielding a flexible and practical algorithm, and a better understanding of musical repetition...|$|R

40|$|The {{physical}} and functional links between <b>transcription</b> and processing <b>machines</b> of tRNA {{in the cell}} remain essentially unknown.

However, transcription can be restored {{by the addition of}} a purified holoenzyme. Targeted cleavage of the H 1 RNA moiety of RNase P alters enzyme specificity and diminishes Pol III transcription. Moreover, inactivation of RNase P by targeting its protein subunits for destruction using small interfering RNAs inhibits Pol III function and Pol III-directed promoter activity in the cell. RNase P exerts its role in transcription through association with Pol III and chromatin of active tRNA and 5 S rRNA genes. The results demonstrate a role for RNase P in Pol III transcription and suggest that transcription and early processing of tRNA may be coordinated...|$|R

We explore densely connected LSTMs, inspired by the densely connected convolutional networks recently introduced for image classification tasks. We also propose an acoustic model adaptation scheme that simply averages the parameters of a seed neural network acoustic model and its adapted version. This method was applied with the CallHome training corpus and improved individual system performances by on average 6. 1 % (relative) against the CallHome portion of the evaluation set with no performance loss on the Switchboard portion.

40|$|Recent work in {{automatic}} {{recognition of}} conversational telephone speech (CTS) has achieved accuracy levels comparable to human transcribers, {{although there is}} some debate how to precisely quantify human performance on this task, using the NIST 2000 CTS evaluation set. This raises the question what systematic differences, if any, may be found differentiating human from <b>machine</b> <b>transcription</b> errors. In this paper we approach this question by comparing the output of our most accurate CTS recognition system {{to that of a}} standard speech transcription vendor pipeline. We find that the most frequent substitution, deletion and insertion error types of both outputs show a high degree of overlap. The only notable exception is that the automatic recognizer tends to confuse filled pauses ("uh") and backchannel acknowledgments ("uhhuh"). Humans tend not to make this error, presumably due to the distinctive and opposing pragmatic functions attached to these words. Furthermore, we quantify the correlation between human and machine errors at the speaker level, and investigate the effect of speaker overlap between training and test data. Finally, we report on an informal "Turing test" asking humans to discriminate between automatic and human transcription error cases...|$|R

40|$|According to the Royal National Institute for Deaf {{people there}} are nearly 7. 5 million hearing-impaired people in Great Britain. Human-operated <b>machine</b> <b>transcription</b> systems, such as Palantype, achieve low word error rates in real-time. The {{disadvantage}} {{is that they are}} very expensive to use because of the difficulty in training operators, making them impractical for everyday use in higher education. Existing automatic speech recognition systems also achieve low word error rates, the disadvantages being that they work for read speech in a restricted domain. Moving a system to a new domain requires a large amount of relevant data, for training acoustic and language models. The adopted solution makes use of an existing continuous speech phoneme recognition system as a front-end to a word recognition sub-system. The subsystem generates a lattice of word hypotheses using dynamic programming with robust parameter estimation obtained using evolutionary programming. Sentence hypotheses are obtained by parsing the word lattice using a beam search and contributing knowledge consisting of anti-grammar rules, that check the syntactic incorrectness’ of word sequences, and word frequency information. On an unseen spontaneous lecture taken from the Lund Corpus and using a dictionary containing " 2637 words, the system achieved 815 % words correct with 15 % simulated phoneme error, and 73. 1 % words correct with 25 % simulated phoneme error. The system was also evaluated on 113 Wall Street Journal sentences. The achievements of the work are a domain independent method, using the anti- grammar, to reduce the word lattice search space whilst allowing normal spontaneous English to be spoken; a system designed to allow integration with new sources of knowledge, such as semantics or prosody, providing a test-bench for determining the impact of different knowledge upon word lattice parsing without the need for the underlying speech recognition hardware; the robustness of the word lattice generation using parameters that withstand changes in vocabulary and domain...|$|R
