5|$|Following {{the winter}} 2014 Sochi Olympics the Russian Federation annexed Crimea. The West responded with {{sanctions}} targeted at Putin's immediate entourage, and Bukovsky expressed the hope <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>would</b> prove {{the end of}} his regime.|$|E
5|$|He was {{not only}} {{concerned}} with higher education, but also with primary education, and promoted the creation of free schools for poor children. In those schools, students would learn to read and learn basic maths and the catechism. He thought <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>would</b> help to raise people willing to work, and reduce laziness.|$|E
5|$|It was {{initially}} thought that Tillingbourne would {{be sold to}} another operator, with four companies reported to be interested. However, by early April 2001, it became clear <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>would</b> not take place, as the offers submitted were lower than {{the value of the}} vehicles owned by the company.|$|E

5|$|One {{section of}} the M11 {{extension}} was due to tunnel under George Green in Wanstead. Residents had believed <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>would</b> save their green, and a 250-year-old sweet chestnut tree that grew upon it, but {{because this was a}} cut and cover tunnel, this required the tree to be cut down.|$|E
5|$|The United States {{ultimately}} {{ratified the}} U.N.'s Genocide Convention in 1986. The Convention was signed with reservations, which prevented the law being enacted if it contradicted the Constitution. Several states expressed concern <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>would</b> undermine {{the provisions of}} the convention.|$|E
5|$|After a {{preliminary}} investigation, Geetha calls Georgekutty and family for questioning. Georgekutty, who had predicted <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>would</b> happen, had already taught his family {{how to change}} their alibi {{at the time of}} murder. When questioned individually, they give the same replies. Georgekutty also presents the bill of the restaurant, the movie ticket and the bus tickets as proof of their alibi. Geetha questions the owners of the establishments they have been to and their statements prove Georgekutty's alibi. However, Geetha realizes later that Georgekutty had faked the evidence and established his alibi on the owners by going on a trip with his family to the same establishments later.|$|E

5|$|After his release, Kenyatta {{set about}} trying to ensure {{that he was the}} only {{realistic}} option as Kenya's future leader. In August he met with the Governor of Kenya, Patrick Muir Renison, at Kiambu, and he was interviewed by the BBC's Face to Face program. In August he also attended a KANU-KADU meeting, where the two parties disagreed on the question of federalism: KANU wanted a centralised state while KADU feared <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>would</b> result in Kikuyu dominance of an independent Kenya.|$|E
5|$|Although an {{air-cooled}} {{design was}} chosen for the reactor at Oak Ridge to facilitate rapid construction, it was recognized <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>would</b> be impractical for the much larger production reactors. Initial designs by the Metallurgical Laboratory and DuPont used helium for cooling, before they determined that a water-cooled reactor would be simpler, cheaper and quicker to build. The design did not become available until 4 October 1943; in the meantime, Matthias concentrated on improving the Hanford Site by erecting accommodations, improving the roads, building a railway switch line, and upgrading the electricity, water and telephone lines.|$|E
5|$|Announcing <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>would</b> be {{his final}} season before retirement, Shearer's {{form in the}} 2004–05 season was patchy; {{alongside}} new signing Patrick Kluivert, he scored only sevengoals in his 28games as the club finished the season in 14th place. The club fared better in the cup competitions, however, eventually losing out to Sporting CP in the UEFA Cup quarter-finals and Manchester United in the FA Cup semi-finals. Shearer scored a hat-trick {{in the first round}} win against Hapoel Bnei Sakhnin, and ended the season with a haul of 11 European goals, in addition to his one goal in domestic cups.|$|E

5|$|Bennett {{pulled his}} first {{selection}} surprise of 2007, experimenting with Hunt at halfback {{for the opening}} game of the season. At the time Bennett maintained <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>would</b> be a long term switch, but due to the Broncos' poor form, Hunt returned to fullback for Round 3. Hunt was selected {{to play for the}} Australian national team at fullback in the 2007 ANZAC Test match against New Zealand, scoring a try in the Kangaroos' 30-6 victory.|$|E
5|$|By {{the fall}} of his junior season, the Illinois class of 2014 was being {{mentioned}} {{as one of the}} all-time great statewide classes of basketball players. Chicago Sun-Times writer Joe Henricksen noted that there was a high chance <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>would</b> be the fifth Illinois class and first since 2002 to include three McDonald's All-Americans. He also noted that the class has a chance to rival if not surpass the classes of 1998 and 2011 which each had nine top 100 players.|$|E
5|$|Chamberlin jealously guarded his position. In late 1943, Chamberlin {{differed}} {{with one}} of his planners, Brigadier General Bonner Fellers, over a proposed landing at Hansa Bay. Fellers thought that Hansa Bay could be bypassed, but Chamberlin felt <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>would</b> be too risky. While Fellers was a newcomer to GHQ, he had known MacArthur for many years, and Fellers took his proposal directly to MacArthur, who approved it. A furious Chamberlin had Fellers fired from G-3. MacArthur made him his military secretary.|$|E

5|$|Dealing with sanitation, Espejo {{observed}} that the hospital (Hospital de la Misericordia) of the city, the monasteries and the places of worship were filthy and <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>would</b> certainly contribute to future epidemics. He disapproved of the custom of burying the dead inside churches; instead, he suggested burying the dead outside the city limits in a graveyard chosen by the Church and owned by the town council. Finally, he condemned {{the management of the}} hospital by the Bethlehemites. He said their methods were outdated and that they provided poor service. The staff of the hospital reacted badly to this, and Espejo lost the friendship of his mentor, José del Rosario.|$|E
5|$|Diệm's {{victory was}} seen as a blow to French stature in Vietnam, as the former colonial power had helped to set up Bảo Đại's State of Vietnam in 1949. They {{consistently}} opposed Diệm and his policies, and unsuccessfully tried to impede him. The U.S. media regarded Diệm's victory as a signal that the United States would be the only Western power in South Vietnam. Some felt <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>would</b> enable Diệm to rule effectively without French hindrance, while others felt <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>would</b> leave too much of a burden on the American government. The French media and diplomatic corps viewed the result as a humiliation. Before the poll, French officials had privately predicted Diệm would dissolve the French High Command and use any victory as justification for scrapping the national reunification elections. The French media viewed the poll as undemocratic and a plot by the Americans to sabotage any prospect of national reunification, but France recognised the Republic of Vietnam soon after.|$|E
5|$|Early in his reign, {{there were}} plans {{regarding}} {{a marriage of}} Władysław and Princess Elisabeth of Bohemia, Princess Palatine (daughter of Frederick V, Elector Palatine). This was however unpopular, both with Catholic nobles and the Catholic Church, and {{when it became clear}} to Władysław <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>would</b> not convince the Swedes to elect him to their throne, this plan, with quiet support from Władysław himself, was dropped.|$|E

5|$|Four years later, with Drumlin {{seeking to}} close SETI, Arroway discovers a signal repeating a {{sequence}} of prime numbers, apparently sent from the star system Vega some 26 light-years away. This announcement causes Drumlin and the National Security Council led by Michael Kitz to attempt {{to take control of}} the facility. Arroway's team then discover a video buried in the signal: Adolf Hitler's opening address at the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin. Arroway and her team postulate <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>would</b> have been the first television signal strong enough to leave Earth's atmosphere, taking 26 years to reach Vega and then being transmitted back from there.|$|E
5|$|Girl Pat left Grimsby on 1 April 1936. According to Stone's later account, {{when they}} entered the open sea, Orsborne {{assembled}} the crew—except for Jefferson—in the wheelhouse and told them <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>would</b> not be a normal fishing trip. Instead, he proposed to take the boat south, first calling at Dover where he would get rid of Jefferson, who {{was not included in}} his further plans. At this stage Orsborne was apparently undecided as to his longer-term intentions, but indicated that they would be sailing into southern waters and might go fishing for pearls.|$|E
5|$|Göring {{ordered that}} no more {{transport}} flights be made. Albert Kesselring complained <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>would</b> deny the Axis forces vital supplies, and Göring once again permitted flights. This time they were to travel via Sardinia, {{but no more than}} 60–70 flights would be allowed per night; some 250 had been mounted daily before Flax. The transports also had to run the gauntlet of radar-equipped Bristol Beaufighters but these rarely were successful at intercepting them.|$|E
