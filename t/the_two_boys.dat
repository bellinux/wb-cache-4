5|$|Like Caroline herself (who {{was created}} Baroness Vaughan upon {{the birth of}} their first son), <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>boys</b> were granted {{courtesy}} titles, but no official royal decrees were ever issued by Leopold, the Belgian government, or any other foreign state, causing them to be merely honorary. Because of their parents' legally invalid marriage, their two sons were still deemed illegitimate. Upon each of their births, they had been registered in France under Caroline's name; no mention of Leopold or another potential father was made. Despite these facts, there were fears in Belgium that Leopold would recognize his eldest son as heir to the throne. Had Leopold married in a legal civil ceremony, the boy could have indeed inherited the throne, because all classes were equal under the Belgian constitution, and thus their marriage would not have been considered morganatic. In 1910, <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>boys</b> were adopted by Antoine Durrieux, whom Caroline married soon after Leopold's death.|$|E
5|$|The {{remainder}} of the Woodruffs returned to London, and <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>boys</b> lived with their mother and paternal grandmother in the latter's residence in Finchley. However, Michael and his brother went back to Australia in 1917 after their mother, Margaret, died of a staphylococcal septicaemia. The two then spent a short time {{under the care of}} an aunt before being rejoined by their father in 1917.|$|E
5|$|Ernest, Hereditary Prince of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld, {{was born}} at Ehrenburg Palace in Coburg on 21 June 1818. He was the elder son of Ernest III, Duke of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld and his first wife Princess Louise of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg. He was soon joined by a brother, Prince Albert, who would later become the husband of Queen Victoria. Though Duke Ernest fathered {{numerous}} children in various affairs, <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>boys</b> would have no other legitimate siblings. In 1826, their father succeeded as Ernest I, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha through an exchange of territories {{after the death of}} the duke's uncle, Frederick IV, Duke of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg.|$|E

5|$|In his Bibliotheca, written {{around the}} 1st century B.C. Apollodorus tells of three {{possible}} parentages for Adonis. In the first {{he states that}} Cinyras arrived in Cyprus with a few followers and founded Paphos, and that he married Metharme, eventually becoming king of Cyprus through her family. Cinyras had five children by Metharme: <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>boys,</b> Oxyporos and Adonis, and three daughters, Orsedice, Laogore, and Braisia. The daughters at some point became victims of Aphrodite's wrath and had intercourse with foreigners, ultimately dying in Egypt.|$|E
5|$|Mambo {{was born}} in Jakarta on 11November 1980 to Yoke F. Mambo and his wife Deetje Syarif. She was the eldest, and only girl, of three {{children}} born to the couple. When she was five years old, her parents divorced. Not long afterwards, Mambo was sent {{to live with her}} grandmother because her mother, who received custody, could not afford to send Mambo to school. <b>The</b> <b>two</b> <b>boys</b> stayed with their mother.|$|E
5|$|Mulder and Scully then {{interview}} Curt Brunjes (Jonathan Whittaker), {{the racist}} {{owner of a}} copy shop {{across the street from}} the market where Isaac worked. Mulder tells Brunjes that the other two boys, who work for Brunjes, are in danger. Scully mentions that there is a rumor spreading that Isaac has risen from the grave to avenge his death. <b>The</b> <b>two</b> <b>boys,</b> who are eavesdropping on the conversation, are terrified at this prospect.|$|E

5|$|The game {{begins as}} Eric Harris' mother wakes him on April 20, 1999. Harris phones Dylan Klebold, and the pair meet in Harris' {{basement}} to plot {{a series of}} bombings that will precede their planned shooting. The two reminisce about the bullying they experienced at Columbine High and express rage at those they perceive to be their tormentors. Harris and Klebold make a video, apologizing to their parents and asking them not to blame themselves for what will follow. <b>The</b> <b>two</b> <b>boys</b> collect their guns and bombs, pack a duffel bag with weapons, and leave home.|$|E
5|$|Arthur Gordon Pym {{was born}} {{on the island of}} Nantucket, famous for its fishing harbor and whaling. His best friend, Augustus Barnard, is the son of the captain of a whaling ship. One night, <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>boys</b> become drunk and decide, on Augustus's whim, to take {{advantage}} of the breeze and sail out on Pym's sailboat, the Ariel. The breeze, however, turns out to be the beginnings of a violent storm. The situation gets critical when Augustus passes out drunk, and the inexperienced Pym must take control of the dinghy. The Ariel is overtaken by the Penguin, a returning whaling ship. Against the captain's wishes, the crew of the Penguin turns back to search for and rescue both Augustus and Pym. After they are safely back on land, they decide to keep this episode a secret from their parents.|$|E
5|$|Born in the New South Wales bush town of Cobar on 8 December 1914, Toshack {{was one of}} five {{children}} born to a stationmaster. Orphaned {{at the age of}} six, he was raised by relatives in Lyndhurst in the northwest of the state, and played his early cricket and rugby league for Cowra. At this time, Toshack's ambition was to play rugby league for Australia. One of his childhood friends, Edgar Newham, also played both sports and wanted to play Test cricket. However, the town's doctor, a local community leader, advised that they were targeting the wrong sport, and <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>boys</b> followed his recommendation. Newham later played rugby league for Australia.|$|E

5|$|Both Ravel's {{parents were}} Roman Catholics; Marie was also {{something}} of a free-thinker, a trait inherited by her elder son, who was always politically and socially progressive in outlook in adult life. He was baptised in the Ciboure parish church six days after he was born. The family moved to Paris three months later, and there a younger son, Édouard, was born. (He was close to his father, whom he eventually followed into the engineering profession.) Maurice was particularly devoted to their mother; her Basque heritage was a strong influence on his life and music. Among his earliest memories were folk songs she sang to him. The household was not rich, but the family was comfortable, and <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>boys</b> had happy childhoods.|$|E
5|$|Bánáthy later {{traded for}} milk to give two-year-old Béla and one-year-old László enough protein. As {{extremely}} little food {{was available in}} the camps, in early 1947 his wife's twin sister came from Hungary to take their older two sons back {{to live with the}} older sister. The Pallendal family, Bánáthy's in-laws, was well-educated and relatively wealthy, so they had access to more food than what was available in the camps. They intended to return the Banathy boys to their parents within a year. Beginning in early 1948, when the Cold War ensued, it became virtually impossible for refugees or displaced persons to cross from the border of one country into another, or even from one Occupation Zone to another. The Pallendal family could not return <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>boys</b> from behind the Iron Curtain.|$|E
5|$|Edwin's {{defeat and}} death caused his kingdom to {{fragment}} into {{at least two}} parts. It also led to {{a sharp decline in}} Christianity in Northumbria when Edwin's immediate successors reverted to paganism. Although Paulinus' deacon, James, remained in the north and struggled to rebuild the Roman mission, Edwin's widow decided to return to Kent. Paulinus went with her, taking Edwin and Æthelburg's son and daughter, as well as one of Edwin's grandsons. <b>The</b> <b>two</b> <b>boys</b> went to the continent for safety, to the court of King Dagobert I. Æthelburg, Eanflæd, and Paulinus remained in Kent, where Paulinus was offered the see, or bishopric, of Rochester, which he held until his death. Because the pallium did not reach Paulinus until after he had left York, it was of no use to him.|$|E

5|$|Ernest's {{position}} was often linked {{to his brother}} Prince Albert, husband of Queen Victoria. <b>The</b> <b>two</b> <b>boys</b> were raised as though twins, and became closer upon the separation and divorce of their parents, {{as well as the}} eventual death of their mother. The princes' relationship experienced phases of closeness as well as minor arguments as they grew older; after Albert's death in 1861, Ernest became gradually more antagonistic to Victoria and her children, as well as increasingly bitter toward the United Kingdom, publishing anonymous pamphlets against various members of the British royal family. Despite their increasingly differing political views and opinions however, Ernest accepted his second eldest nephew Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh, as his heir-presumptive. Upon Ernest's death on 22 August 1893 at Reinhardsbrunn, Alfred succeeded to the ducal throne.|$|E
5|$|Evelyn is a {{character}} that appears in flashback sequences in Uncharted 4: A Thief's End. She is voiced and motion captured by Merle Dandridge. She is a celebrated historian and knew and worked with Cassandra Morgan, Nate and Sam's mother. One night, she caught <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>boys</b> breaking into her house {{when they went to}} retrieve their mother's belongings, but decided to share with them what their mother found. Just as the police arrive at the scene, Evelyn tells the boys that she will buy them some time, but suddenly collapses. She was a heavy smoker, and died from a lung disease and the boys are associated with her death.|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} year of his life, George was the only heir to the German territories of his father and three childless uncles. George's brother, Frederick Augustus, was born in 1661, and <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>boys</b> (known as Görgen and Gustchen by the family) were brought up together. Their mother was absent for almost a year (1664–65) during a long convalescent holiday in Italy, but corresponded {{regularly}} with her sons' governess and took a great interest in their upbringing, even more so upon her return. Sophia bore Ernest Augustus another four sons and a daughter. In her letters, Sophia describes George as a responsible, conscientious child who set an example to his younger brothers and sisters.|$|E

5|$|Hemlock Hoax is {{a detective}} who has little respect {{in the small}} {{tropical}} town where he lives, {{despite the fact that}} he thinks he is a better sleuth than Sherlock Holmes. A pair of boys decide to play a trick on Hoax and tell him about a murder. Hoax rushes to scene of the crime where he discovers a shred of cloth, later finding that a tramp is wearing the same type of clothes that he found. The tramp runs away and Hoax gives chase, with other people helping the pursuit. Eventually, Hoax captures the tramp with the aid of a police officer, and returns to the victim's body with the man. Hoax then comes to a realization that the body was just a dummy that had been stuffed with the leaves. The crowd has a laugh at Hoax's expense while <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>boys</b> are punished.|$|E
5|$|In 1974 Jacques' {{sons were}} arrested for {{possession}} of cannabis, and her house was searched by police. In the same week that <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>boys</b> appeared in court, she received official notification of the intention to appoint her as an OBE. In order to protect her sons from further press intrusion she declined the honour. Later that year, while filming the third series of Sykes, she suffered a cancer scare and lost {{a considerable amount of}} weight. Despite this she refused to interrupt the busy production schedule; when filming was completed on 5 December she underwent surgery at Charing Cross Hospital for what proved to be benign tumours on her kidneys.|$|E
5|$|Kurt is menaced {{by school}} bully Dave Karofsky (Max Adler) and badly shaken; while Sue sympathizes with Kurt's plight, she can only punish Karofsky if he {{physically}} attacks Kurt. Glee club co-captain Rachel Berry (Lea Michele) convinces the glee club girls {{to have their}} football-playing boyfriends defend Kurt, but her own boyfriend, Finn, refuses, concerned that it may jeopardize his position as quarterback. Artie Abrams (Kevin McHale), Noah Puckerman (Mark Salling) and Mike Chang (Harry Shum, Jr.) do confront Karofsky, and demand that he leave Kurt alone. Karofsky retaliates, and Sam defends them by fighting with him. Quinn is impressed by Sam's actions, and decides to accept his promise ring. Karofsky later sees Kurt and Finn practicing a wedding dance and taunts {{them in front of}} Burt. Burt is angered by this, but becomes livid when Kurt admits that Karofsky has threatened to kill him. He instigates a meeting with Sue, Karofsky's father (Daniel Roebuck) and <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>boys,</b> at which Sue expels Karofsky.|$|E

Their songs typically featured Evans' laid-back vocals, with a musical approach based on “beautifully matched guitar and mandolin accompaniment”.
