5|$|The {{intersection}} of Route 14 with Via Princessa in Santa Clarita {{is an unusual}} design, with long flyover ramps for the connections. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> of a freeway revolt by the residents of Santa Clarita, that canceled plans for a freeway extension of Route 126. While the Via Princessa alignment of Route 126 was canceled, a different alignment is being constructed with proposed connections to Route 14.|$|E
5|$|About 0.3–0.7% {{of people}} are {{affected}} by schizophrenia during their lifetimes. In 2013 there were an estimated 23.6 million cases globally. Males are more often affected than females. About 20% of people do well and a few recover completely. Social problems, such as long-term unemployment, poverty and homelessness are common. The average life expectancy of people with the disorder is ten to twenty-five years less than for the general population. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> of increased physical health problems and a higher suicide rate (about 5%). In 2015 an estimated 17,000 people worldwide died from behavior related to, or caused by, schizophrenia.|$|E
5|$|Adaptation occurs {{through the}} gradual {{modification}} of existing structures. Consequently, structures with similar internal organisation {{may have different}} functions in related organisms. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> of a single ancestral structure being adapted to function in different ways. The bones within bat wings, for example, {{are very similar to}} those in mice feet and primate hands, due to the descent of all these structures from a common mammalian ancestor. However, since all living organisms are related to some extent, even organs that appear to have little or no structural similarity, such as arthropod, squid and vertebrate eyes, or the limbs and wings of arthropods and vertebrates, can depend on a common set of homologous genes that control their assembly and function; this is called deep homology.|$|E

5|$|Certain {{patterns}} of reflectivity are important clues for the meteorologist as well. The three body scatter spike is an example. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> of {{energy from the}} radar hitting hail and being deflected to the ground, where they deflect back to the hail {{and then to the}} radar. The energy took more time to go from the hail to the ground and back, as opposed to the energy that went direct from the hail to the radar, and the echo is further away from the radar than the actual location of the hail on the same radial path, forming a cone of weaker reflectivities.|$|E
5|$|Cortisol is {{the main}} {{glucocorticoid}} in humans. In species that do not create cortisol, this role is played by corticosterone instead. Glucocorticoids have many effects on metabolism. As their name suggests, they increase the circulating level of glucose. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> {{of an increase in}} the mobilization of amino acids from protein and the stimulation of synthesis of glucose from these amino acids in the liver. In addition, they increase the levels of free fatty acids, which cells can use as an alternative to glucose to obtain energy. Glucocorticoids also have effects unrelated to the regulation of blood sugar levels, including the suppression of the immune system and a potent anti-inflammatory effect. Cortisol reduces the capacity of osteoblasts to produce new bone tissue and decreases the absorption of calcium in the gastrointestinal tract.|$|E
5|$|Famine {{is shaped}} by {{generally}} two theories. The first is FAD, Food Availability Decline. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> of a drought, a war, or some other drastic change to the agricultural system. This is the natural cause for famine. The other theory deals primarily with the population’s ability to access or become entitled to food. In this case, food power makes itself known on a small scale, as opposing political forces in Sudan compete for the votes of the people by instigating or encouraging the famine.|$|E

5|$|The vocal {{production}} system {{is controlled by}} the cranial nerve nucleus in the brain, and supplied by the recurrent laryngeal nerve and the superior laryngeal nerve, branches of the vagus nerve. The vocal tract is supplied by the hypoglossal nerve and facial nerves. Electrical stimulation of the periaqueductal gray (PEG) region of the mammalian midbrain elicit vocalizations. The ability to learn new vocalizations is only exemplified in humans, seals, cetaceans, and possibly bats; in humans, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> of a direct connection between the motor cortex, which controls movement, and the motor neurons in the spinal cord.|$|E
5|$|In the spring, mature birds {{return to}} land, usually to the colony {{at which they}} were hatched. Birds that were removed as chicks and {{released}} elsewhere were found to show fidelity to their point of liberation. They congregate {{for a few days}} on the sea in small groups offshore before returning to the cliff top nesting sites. Each large puffin colony is subdivided into sub-colonies by physical boundaries such as stands of bracken or gorse. Early arrivals take control of the best locations, the most desirable nesting sites being the densely packed burrows on grassy slopes just above the cliff edge where take-off is most easily accomplished. The birds are usually monogamous, but <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> of their fidelity to their nesting sites rather than to their mates and they often return to the same burrows year after year. Later arrivals at the colony may find that all the best nesting sites have already been taken and be pushed towards the periphery where they are in greater danger of predation. Younger birds may come ashore a month or more after the mature birds and find no remaining nesting sites. They will not breed till the following year although it has been found that if the ground cover surrounding the colony is cut back before these sub-adults arrive, the number of successfully nesting pairs may be increased.|$|E
5|$|The {{estimate}} of $74 million financial impact {{over three years}} to the county includes approximately $37 million in lost property taxes, $32 million in lessened worker income and $5 million in reduced federal royalties. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> of the region’s {{oil and gas industry}} being heavily dependent on Lines 901 and 903. Prior to the spill, Exxon, which was the region’s biggest oil operator at the time, was on pace to generate approximately $636 million in revenue in Santa Barbara County during 2015 but as of November 5, 2015 had only generated an estimated $216.6 million. The offshore oil platforms that rely on the lines were forced to shut down when onshore storage tanks were filled. , no timetable had been established to restart the rigs. Truck transport of continuing production from the offshore platforms was not allowed by local agencies. Exceptions have been closely scrutinized by local officials such as allowing Venoco in August 2015 to transport crude oil that was already onshore by truck for a limited period. The oil had been evacuated from tanks and pipelines to allow maintenance of the onshore Ellwood facility in Goleta that serves Platform Holly.|$|E

5|$|The reactivities of the {{alkali metals}} {{increase}} {{going down the}} group. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> {{of a combination of}} two factors: the first ionisation energies and atomisation energies of the alkali metals. Because the first ionisation energy of the alkali metals decreases down the group, it is easier for the outermost electron to be removed from the atom and participate in chemical reactions, thus increasing reactivity down the group. The atomisation energy measures the strength of the metallic bond of an element, which falls down the group as the atoms increase in radius and thus the metallic bond must increase in length, making the delocalised electrons further away from the attraction of the nuclei of the heavier alkali metals. Adding the atomisation and first ionisation energies gives a quantity closely related to (but not equal to) the activation energy of the reaction of an alkali metal with another substance. This quantity decreases going down the group, and so does the activation energy; thus, chemical reactions can occur faster and the reactivity increases down the group.|$|E
