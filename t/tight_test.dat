Many of these methods, including the category-partition method and the classification-tree method, follow the approach of partition testing, in which the input domain is partitioned into subdomains according to {{important aspects of the}} specification, and test cases are then derived from the subdomains. Though comprehensive in terms of these important aspects, execution of all the test cases so generated may not be feasible under the constraint of <b>tight</b> <b>testing</b> resources. In such circumstances, {{there is a need to}} select a smaller subset of test cases from the original test suite for execution.

For design-for-test purposes (DFT), this is important in order to select the best test measurements but this must {{be done at the}} design stage, before production test data is made available. In the analogue domain, previous works have considered the {{estimation of}} these metrics for the case of single faults, either catastrophic or parametric. The consideration of single parametric faults is sensible for a production test technique if the design is robust.

In addition, aging mechanisms result in field failures that are often caused by multiple parametric deviations. In this paper, we will consider the estimation of analogue test metrics under the presence of multiple parametric deviations (or process deviations) and under the presence of faults. A statistical model of a circuit is used for setting test limits under process deviations as a trade-off between test metrics calculated at the design stage. This model is obtained from a Monte Carlo circuit simulation, assuming Gaussian Probability Density Functions (PDFs) for the parameter and performance deviations. After setting the test limits considering process deviations, the test metrics are calculated under the presence of catastrophic and parametric single faults for different potential test measurements.

40|$|Big-bang {{nucleosynthesis}} (BBN) {{describes the}} production of the lightest nuclides via a dynamic interplay among the four fundamental forces during the first seconds of cosmic time. We briefly overview the essentials of this physics, and present new calculations of light element abundances through li 6 and li 7, with updated nuclear reactions and uncertainties including those in the neutron lifetime. We provide fits to these results as a function of baryon density and of the number of neutrino flavors, N_nu. We review recent developments in BBN, particularly new, precision Planck cosmic microwave background (CMB) measurements that now probe the baryon density, helium content, and the effective number of degrees of freedom, n_eff. These measurements allow for a <b>tight</b> <b>test</b> of BBN and of cosmology using CMB data alone. Our likelihood analysis convolves the 2015 Planck data chains with our BBN output and observational data. Adding astronomical measurements of light elements strengthens the power of BBN. We include a new determination of the primordial helium abundance in our likelihood analysis. New D/H observations are now more precise than the corresponding theoretical predictions, and are consistent with the Standard Model and the Planck baryon density. Moreover, D/H now provides a tight measurement of N_nu when combined with the CMB baryon density, and provides a 2 sigma upper limit N_nu < 3. 2. The new precision of the CMB and of D/H observations together leave D/H predictions as the largest source of uncertainties. Future improvement in BBN calculations will therefore rely on improved nuclear cross section data. In contrast with D/H and he 4, li 7 predictions continue to disagree with observations, perhaps pointing to new physics. Comment: 50 pages, 14 figure...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Load {{testing is}} an {{important}} phase in the software development process. It is very time consuming but there is usually little time for it. As {{a solution to the}} <b>tight</b> <b>testing</b> schedule, software companies automate their testing procedures. However, existing automation only reduces the time required to run load tests. The analysis of the test results is still performed manually. A typical load test outputs thousands of performance counters. Analyzing these counters manually requires time and tacit knowledge of the system-under-test from the performance engineers. The goal {{of this study is to}} derive an approach to automatically verify load tests results. We propose an approach based on a statistical quality control technique called control charts. Our approach can a) automatically determine if a test run passes or fails and b) identify the subsystem where performance problem originated. We conduct two case studies on a large commer-cial telecommunication software and an open-source software system to evaluate our approach. Our results warrant further development of control chart based techniques in performance verification...|$|R

40|$|In {{two recent}} papers, {{the author has}} {{developed}} a theory of graded annihilators of left modules over the Frobenius skew polynomial ring over a commutative Noetherian ring $R$ of prime characteristic $p$, and has shown that this theory is relevant {{to the theory of}} <b>test</b> elements in <b>tight</b> closure theory. One result of that work was that, if $R$ is local and the $R$-module structure on the injective envelope $E$ of the simple $R$-module can be extended to a structure as a torsion-free left module over the Frobenius skew polynomial ring, then $R$ is $F$-pure and has a <b>tight</b> closure <b>test</b> element. One of the central results of this paper is the converse, namely that, if $R$ is $F$-pure, then $E$ has a structure as a torsion-free left module over the Frobenius skew polynomial ring; a corollary is that every $F$-pure local ring of prime characteristic, even if it is not excellent, has a <b>tight</b> closure <b>test</b> element. These results are then used, along with embedding theorems for modules over the Frobenius skew polynomial ring, to show that every excellent (not necessarily local) $F$-pure ring of characteristic $p$ must have a so-called `big' test element.
