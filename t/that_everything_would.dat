5|$|In 1910 Theodore Roosevelt {{visited the}} province. Before his arrival, Governor R.C.R. Owen {{informed}} Governor General Sir Reginald Wingate <b>that</b> <b>everything</b> <b>would</b> {{be done for}} {{the former president of}} the United States, but also pointed out that his troops had not even one donkey.|$|E
5|$|During the {{two weeks}} leading up to the Grand Prix, Räikkönen and Felipe Massa {{released}} statements to the press saying they believed <b>that</b> <b>everything</b> <b>would</b> be different in Canada because of the very different conditions—as shown at Paul Ricard. Fernando Alonso believed McLaren had momentum from their win in Monaco, and Martin Whitmarsh said that they were realistic about dominating the race.|$|E
5|$|An {{undertaking}} of {{the restoration}} team was <b>that</b> <b>everything</b> <b>would</b> be handled in a transparent fashion, that reporters, art historians {{and others with}} a bona fide interest should have ready access to information and to view the work. However, a single company, Nippon Television Network Corporation, had sole photography rights. Michael Kimmelman, chief art critic of The New York Times, wrote, in 1991, that the criticism of {{the restoration of the}} ceiling and lunettes was in part fuelled by the Nippon Television Network's reluctance to make public those photographs that they had taken by exclusive right, which had recorded every stage of the process and which were the only solid evidence that the work was being done appropriately.|$|E

50|$|On 31 December, however, {{a witness}} in the Yadlin affair sent the police a {{statement}} which raised more questions for investigation, and various rumors were published about possible charges. On 2 January, Prime Minister Rabin and Justice Minister Zadok assured Ofer <b>that</b> <b>everything</b> possible <b>would</b> be done to expedite the inquiry.|$|R
5|$|Gierek, like Gomułka in 1956, came {{to power}} on a raft of {{promises}} <b>that</b> <b>everything</b> <b>would</b> be different from now on: wages would rise, prices would remain stable, there would be freedom of speech, and {{those responsible for the}} violence at Gdynia and elsewhere would be punished. Although Poles were much more skeptical than they had been in 1956, Gierek was believed to be an honest and well-intentioned man, and his promises bought him some time. He used this time to create a new economic program, one based on large-scale borrowing from banks in the West — mainly from the United States and West Germany — to buy technology that would upgrade Poland's production of export goods. This massive borrowing, estimated to have totaled over 24 billion US (1970s) dollars during Gierek's years, was used to re-equip and modernize Polish industry, and to import consumer goods to give the workers more incentive to work.|$|E
5|$|At 3pm, the Cabildo {{began its}} routine work, but was {{interrupted}} by 600armed men named the Infernal Legion, who occupied the Plaza de la Victoria and loudly demanded the convening of an open cabildo and the resignation of Viceroy Cisneros. They carried a portrait of FerdinandVII and the lapels of their jackets bore a white ribbon that symbolized criollo–Spanish unity. Domingo French, the mail carrier of the city, and Antonio Beruti, {{an employee of the}} treasury, led the rioters. It was rumored that Cisneros had been killed, and that Saavedra would take control of the government. Saavedra was at the barracks at that moment, concerned about the demonstration. He thought the violence should be stopped and that radical measures such as the assassination of Cisneros should be prevented, but he also thought that the troops would mutiny if the demonstrations were suppressed. The people in the Plaza did not believe that Cisneros would allow the open cabildo the next day. Leiva left the Cabildo, and Belgrano, who was representing the crowd, requested a definitive commitment. Leiva explained <b>that</b> <b>everything</b> <b>would</b> go ahead as planned, but the Cabildo needed time to prepare. He asked Belgrano to help the Cabildo with the work, as his intervention would be seen by the crowd as a guarantee that their demands would not be ignored. The crowd left the main hall but stayed in the Plaza. Belgrano protested about the guest list, which consisted of the wealthiest citizens, and thought that if the poor people were left outside there would be further unrest. The members of the Cabildo tried to convince him to give his support, but he left.|$|E
25|$|On November 15, 2000, Wojcicki {{failed to}} make payroll for the first pay period of the season, and as such {{defaulted}} ownership of the club to the league. This news was greeted bitterly by the players, who just days early had been repeatedly ensured by the owner himself <b>that</b> <b>everything</b> <b>would</b> be fine.|$|E
50|$|Currey's {{photographic}} skills {{documented the}} plight of Kaziranga National Park and illustrated the problems faced in Assam in a hard-hitting article in the UK's Daily Telegraph Magazine. EIA launched an appeal guaranteeing <b>that</b> <b>everything</b> raised <b>would</b> be spent on the park. Through this appeal EIA spent over £80,000 on essentials and boosted staff morale.|$|R

50|$|Equipment {{was moved}} to Camp Hero at the Montauk base in the late 1960s, and {{installed}} in an underground bunker beneath the base. According to conspiracy theorists, to mask {{the nature of the}} project the site was closed in 1969 and donated as a wildlife refuge/park, with the provision <b>that</b> <b>everything</b> underground <b>would</b> remain the property of the Air Force (although, in reality, the base remained in operation until the 1980s).|$|R
25|$|The actions Claudius took to {{preserve}} his rule in the short-term were not easily undone as Britannicus approached manhood. In late 54, Britannicus was within 6 months of reaching manhood by Roman tradition, and had matured early. According to the historian Suetonius, Claudius began to mention divorcing Agrippina and dismissing Nero {{now that he was}} no longer needed. In preparation, Claudius commended both his son and adopted son to the Senate as equals in his last Senate address. Suetonius reports that Claudius now admonished his son to grow up quickly, implying <b>that</b> <b>everything</b> <b>would</b> be righted when he assumed the toga virilis.|$|E
25|$|Later, Nicholas, who {{requires}} {{his family}} signet ring {{as proof of}} his identity, tells Jo that the container of toxic waste is safe, as he has hidden it in the well. Jo is horrified at this and now considers Nicholas {{to be the person}} responsible for the harm which had befallen her friends at the school. Nicholas promises her <b>that</b> <b>everything</b> <b>would</b> be okay. With the help of Tama, and the technology of 1995, a neutralising agent for the toxic waste is discovered, and a sufficient quantity is manufactured to render the waste in the container safe.|$|E
25|$|Minister of the Interior Otar Khetsia stated on 21 November that {{criminal}} cases had been opened {{by law enforcement}} agencies in Gagra and Aradu. He noted that Azhiba's car had stood along the road at a far distance from his home, and while he confirmed that fire had broken out, he cautioned that {{it was up to}} the investigation to establish whether the car had exploded or been set fire to. Khetsia also confirmed that a warehouse for kiwifruit had burned down in Aradu, and <b>that</b> <b>everything</b> <b>would</b> be done to find the perpetrators, but he expressed his surprise at the fact that reporters from Abaza TV (owned by Butba) had been at the crime scene before officers from the Ochamchira police department.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the revolt}} was also fuelled by a general feeling of discontent and humiliation at the {{failures}} of the Angeloi, especially in terms of foreign policy. This much is evident from the— albeit embellished— account of the eyewitness Nicholas Mesarites, whereby John Komnenos's supporters proclaimed <b>that</b> henceforth <b>everything</b> <b>would</b> go well for Romania, that her enemies would be vanquished, and that the kings of all the earth would come to pay homage to Constantinople.|$|R
2500|$|Iranian then-Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi {{told the}} press in 1973, [...] "I want to say quite emphatically ... <b>that</b> <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> weaken or {{jeopardize}} the President's power to make decisions in split seconds would represent grave danger for the whole world." [...] An unnamed Kenyan senior official of Foreign Affairs Ministry accused Nixon of lacking interest in Africa and its politics and then said, [...] "American President is so enmeshed in domestic problems created by Watergate that foreign policy seems suddenly to have taken a [...]" [...] Cuban then-leader Fidel Castro said in his December 1974 interview that, of the crimes committed by the Cuban exiles, like killings, attacks on Cuban ports, and spying, the Watergate burglaries and wiretappings were [...] "probably the least of [...]" ...|$|R
5000|$|As shadow Environment minister, Gardiner criticised {{the lack}} of prosecutions of leading players ten months after David Cameron promised <b>that</b> <b>everything</b> {{possible}} <b>would</b> be done to deal with crime relating to the horse meat scandal.

25|$|At this point, {{the growing}} tide of {{revolution}} was becoming discernible, giving Hoveyda {{ample opportunity to}} leave the country before revolutionary forces could {{have had a chance to}} overthrow the 2500-year-old monarchy. Aside from persistent efforts by family and friends {{to leave the country}} as quickly as possible, the Shah himself proposed Hoveida with an ambassadorial position to Belgium. His refusal to leave the country can be judged as being a result of naïveté or blind optimism, but Hoveida's decision can also be assessed from alternate angles. For one, he did not want to abandon his mother who was incapable of traveling at the time. On a more personal level, Hoveyda came to the conclusion that after years of self-exile, he would do all he could to remain in Iran. With all these points of rationale being considered, Hoveida actually came to believe that revolutionary fervour was capable of being contained and <b>that</b> <b>everything</b> <b>would</b> eventually straighten out, allowing the country to resume its present course.|$|E
500|$|Robert Kirkman {{claimed that}} he had {{considered}} {{the idea of a}} television series, but never actively pursued it. When Darabont became interested, Kirkman called it [...] "extremely flattering" [...] and {{went on to say that}} [...] "he definitely cares about the original source material, and you can tell that in the way he's adapting it." [...] In his interview, Kirkman exclaimed that it was [...] "an extreme validation of the work", and continued by expressing that [...] "never in a million years could [...] have thought that if Walking Dead were to ever be adapted <b>that</b> <b>everything</b> <b>would</b> be going this well." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{development}} {{was carried out}} by a 40- to 50-person group that would later be part of Capcom Production Studio 4. Director Hideki Kamiya led the team, which was composed of newer Capcom employees and over half of the staff from the original Resident Evil. In the initial stages of development, producer Mikami often had creative disagreements with Kamiya, and tried to influence the team with his own direction. He eventually stepped back to an overseeing role as producer, and only demanded to be shown the current build once a month. Believing the game's assets to be good individually, but not yet satisfactory as a whole, Mikami expected <b>that</b> <b>everything</b> <b>would</b> coalesce in the three {{months leading up to the}} projected May 1997 release date. Shortly thereafter, however, Resident Evil 1.5 was scrapped at a development stage of 60–80 percent. Mikami later explained that the game would not have reached the desired quality in the aforementioned period, and especially frowned upon the gameplay and locations for being [...] "dull and boring".|$|E
50|$|Prior {{to their}} first match against Canada, the Australian team had their first and only {{training}} session at the Olympic Park basketball stadium, where they replicated <b>everything</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> take place the following day except for the sell-out crowd.|$|R

2500|$|After the {{discovery}} of the bodies, the police opened a murder investigation. Despite having received about 150 tips in the case, they were practically without leads. Kristiansand Police however stated that they were [...] "optimistic and confident that this case, {{we will be able to}} resolve fairly quickly". Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg and Minister of Justice Hanne Harlem both stated <b>that</b> <b>everything</b> <b>would</b> be done to get the murders solved.|$|E
2500|$|In 2014, the {{magazine}} withdrew a harshly-criticised {{review of a}} book by Edward Baptist on slavery and American capitalism; The Economist had complained that [...] "lmost all the blacks in his book are victims, almost all the whites villains." [...] Baptist attributed the harsh review to {{the magazine}}'s adherence to [...] "free-market fundamentalist" [...] theories, [...] "the idea <b>that</b> <b>everything</b> <b>would</b> be better if measured first and last by its efficiency at producing profit." ...|$|E
2500|$|The phrase gained {{popularity}} as {{a feeling}} of nuclear optimism emerged in the 1950s {{in which it was}} believed that all power generators in the future would be atomic in nature. The atomic bomb would render all conventional explosives obsolete and nuclear power plants would do the same for power sources such as coal and oil. There was a general feeling <b>that</b> <b>everything</b> <b>would</b> use a nuclear power source of some sort, in a positive and productive way, from irradiating food to preserve it, to the development of nuclear medicine. There would be an age of peace and plenty in which atomic energy would [...] "provide the power needed to desalinate water for the thirsty, irrigate the deserts for the hungry, and fuel interstellar travel deep into outer space". This use would render the Atomic Age as significant a step in technological progress as the first smelting of Bronze, of Iron, or the commencement of the Industrial Revolution.|$|E
25|$|Everything Everywhere {{announced}} on 22 August 2012 {{that it would}} introduce a third brand {{as part of a}} future 4G launch to sit alongside Orange and T-Mobile, and <b>that</b> <b>Everything</b> Everywhere <b>would</b> continue as the company's legal name. Further speculation commenced on 7 September 2012 when the company announced details of a press conference on the morning of 11 September 2012, the earliest date set by Ofcom to launch 4G services. It was also noted that this date was only 24 hours earlier than the expected launch of the latest generation of iPhone (the iPhone 5), thereby arousing suspicion that the new iPhone would support 4G and <b>that</b> <b>Everything</b> Everywhere <b>would</b> launch its service on this widely anticipated handset. Other commentators suggested that the HTC One XL would be the first handset to launch utilising Everything Everywhere's 4G network. The handsets that the company initially launched on EE are the iPhone 5 (iOS), HTC One XL (Android), Samsung Galaxy S III (Android), Samsung Galaxy NoteII (Android), Huawei Ascend P1 (Android), Nokia Lumia 920 (Windows Phone), Nokia Lumia 820 (Windows Phone). The company also announced that they would be using two 4G mobile broadband devices manufactured by Huawei - the E589 Mobile Wi-Fi device and E392 mobile broadband dongle.|$|R

2500|$|The film's music {{coordinator}} and sound designer Bones Howe worked with musician Michael Boddicker, who wrote and performed the score, {{on the theme}} music and sound effects. Howe selected the source music for the club scene and put together a special arrangement of [...] "Since I Don't Have You" [...] that Buckaroo sings to Penny Priddy. Weller, an accomplished musician, played the guitar and pocket trumpet, did his own vocals, and learned to mime piano playing. Howe and the filmmakers {{decided not to go}} with a rock music score and opted for an electronic one instead. He wanted to [...] "integrate music and sound effects so <b>that</b> <b>everything</b> <b>would</b> merge on the soundtrack with no distinction between music and sound". Boddicker was Howe's first choice for composer. They had worked together on the soundtrack for Get Crazy. Boddicker had just won a Grammy for his song, [...] "Imagination", on the Flashdance soundtrack. In addition to composing the score, he also produced alien sound effects while Alan Howarth was hired to create the sounds of the 8th Dimension.|$|E
2500|$|After all of this, Kelli {{claimed that}} the [...] "dark entity" [...] was worse after the PRS team left.

Kelli also learned that the PRS crew had arrived in town {{at the beginning of}} the shoot and, immediately, hit the town to try and [...] "dig up dirt" [...] on Kelly and Riley Ryan. According to townsfolk who had called Kelli, the producer had arrived the beginning of the week and all the other A and PRS crew had gotten there shortly after Coffey and Belanger. The cast and crew began to scour the town looking to [...] "uncover anything" [...] about the couple such as information that was [...] "unsavory" [...] or a [...] "provocative secret". Director Ben Wolf admitted that they had [...] "asked everywhere" [...] and they could not find a single person in town who said anything other than something favorable about the Ryans. Of this, blogger Kirby Robinson stated, [...] "PRS offers themselves up as help with experts and clergy and after they dramatize, fictionalize, and sensationalize some household's problem they walk away and leave these people with whatever haunting, demonic presence or troubling spirit and, in some cases, worsen the problem", Kelli later claimed that she and her [...] "credibility" [...] were being attacked by Buell and Coffey for telling her story and also claimed that Chip Coffey had [...] "threatened to sue" [...] her.|$|E
