25|$|He {{makes the}} analogy of the plot twist in The War of the Worlds, by H.G. Wells, where Earth {{pathogens}} made the Martian invaders of Earth sick and then die. Perhaps, he suggests, the same could happen <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>on</b> Earth if we return samples containing micro-organisms from Mars. On the one hand, he points out, this possibility seems unlikely {{because of the lack}} of contact between the two planets and because pathogens adapt to their host. On the other hand, the lack of contact also means that we would have never evolved any defences against any pathogens.|$|E

2500|$|GamesRadar's Brent Goodsmith {{scored the}} game 4 out of 5. He {{felt it was}} a button masher, arguing that attacking [...] "is {{executed}} via the trusted medium of button bashing.

[...] However, he didn't see this as an inherent problem; [...] "regardless of how it is achieved, the result is much the same: oodles of rapid-fire killing and the satisfaction of hacking up enemies more numerous than in any console action game that has gone before." [...] He concluded [...] "Spartan does things {{right out of the box}} that the première hack-and-slash series Dynasty Warriors, about to release its tenth PS2 entry, has yet to achieve." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Justice Kennedy, [...] "The cases {{here were}} argued upon the assumption, and come <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>on</b> the premise, that the {{discrimination}} in question {{did not result}} from de jure actions." [...] This point was challenged in Justice Breyer's dissent (joined by Stevens, Souter and Ginsberg). Justice Breyer questioned the utility [...] "of looking simply to whether earlier school segregation was de jure or de facto in order to draw firm lines separating the constitutionally permissible from the constitutionally forbidden use of 'race-conscious' criteria." [...] Justice Breyer notes, [...] "No one here disputes that Louisville's segregation was de jure" [...] and cites a 1956 memo where the Seattle School Board admitted its schools were de jure segregated as well. All of the dissenting Justices acknowledged that [...] "the Constitution does not impose a duty to desegregate upon districts," [...] if the districts have not practiced racial discrimination. [...] However, the dissenters argued that the Constitution permits such desegregation, even though {{it does not require}} it.|$|E

I think if it had continued it would have gotten really ugly. No fistfights or bloody noses or anything like that, but the music would have been substandard. So the line must be drawn there." [...] In another interview from 2001, he similarly stated that the band had broken up [...] "because we were starting to make bad music." [...] However, Gould did not share the same sentiment as Patton {{on the quality of the}} band's late material, stating in 1998 [...] "However many records we sold or didn't, we maintained over a long [...] period of time a high standard of music that we're proud of, and we never sucked.
