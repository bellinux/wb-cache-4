5|$|The {{conquest of}} the Danelaw by West Saxon kings had united England in a single kingdom for the first time, {{enabling}} kings from Æthelstan onwards {{to see themselves as}} heirs of the Carolingian emperors; the regulation of monasteries by a uniform Benedictine rule was designed to unite the kingdom ideologically and enhance royal prestige. The monks depended on the king {{in a way that the}} local ealdormen did not, so their loyalty could be trusted and they could act as a counterbalance to powerful local families. The Regularis Concordia required that psalms be said for the king and the queen in monasteries several <b>times</b> <b>a</b> <b>day,</b> <b>and</b> specified that royal consent must be obtained for the election of abbots. The reformers aimed to enhance the Christian character of kingship, and one aspect of this was to raise the status of the queen; Edgar's last wife, Ælfthryth, was the first king's consort to regularly witness charters as regina.|$|E
5|$|Three main {{modalities}} of RRT are available: hemodialysis, continuous hemofiltration and peritoneal dialysis. The former two require {{access to}} the bloodstream (a dialysis catheter), while peritoneal dialysis is achieved by instilling fluid into the abdominal cavity and later draining it. Hemodialysis, which is normally done {{several times a week}} in chronic kidney disease, is often required on a daily basis in rhabdomyolysis. Its advantage over continuous hemofiltration is that one machine can be used multiple <b>times</b> <b>a</b> <b>day,</b> <b>and</b> that continuous administration of anticoagulant drugs is not necessary. Hemofiltration is more effective at removing large molecules from the bloodstream, such as myoglobin, but this does not seem to confer any particular benefit. Peritoneal dialysis may be difficult to administer in someone with severe abdominal injury, and it may be less effective than the other modalities.|$|E
5|$|The {{requirements}} for the priesthood differed over time and among the cults of different gods. Although detailed theological knowledge was involved in priestly offices, {{little is known about}} what knowledge or training may have been required of the officeholders. Priests were required to observe strict standards of ritual purity in the sacred space. They shaved their heads and bodies, washed several <b>times</b> <b>a</b> <b>day,</b> <b>and</b> wore only clean linen clothing. They were not required to be celibate, but sexual intercourse rendered them unclean until they underwent further purification. The cults of specific gods might impose further restrictions related to that god's mythology, such as rules against eating the meat of an animal that represented the god. The acceptance of women into the priesthood was variable. In the Old Kingdom many women served as priests, but their presence in clergies declined drastically in the Middle Kingdom before increasing in the Third Intermediate Period. Lesser positions, such as that of musician in ceremonies, remained open to women in even the most restrictive periods, as did the special role of ceremonial consort of the god. This latter role was highly influential, and {{the most important of these}} consorts, the God's Wife of Amun, even supplanted the High Priest of Amun during the Late Period.|$|E

On November 1, 2010, Lovato withdrew from the Jonas Brothers Live in Concert tour, entering a treatment facility for [...] "physical and emotional issues". It was reported that she decided to enter treatment after punching female dancer Alex Welch, her management and family convinced her she needed help. Lovato said she took [...] "100 percent, full responsibility" [...] for the incident. On January 28, 2011, Lovato completed inpatient treatment at Timberline Knolls and returned home. She acknowledged that she had had bulimia, had harmed herself, and had been [...] "self-medicating" [...] with drugs and alcohol [...] "like a lot of teens do to numb their pain".

In a February 1967 review, Hit Parader declared: [...] "Revolver represents the pinnacle of pop music. No group has been as consistently creative as the Beatles, though the [...] Spoonful and Beach Boys are coming closer all the time... Rather than analyze the music we just suggest that you listen to Revolver three or four <b>times</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> <b>and</b> marvel..." [...] Later that year, in Esquire, Robert Christgau called the album [...] "twice as good and four times as startling as Rubber Soul, with sound effects, Oriental drones, jazz bands, transcendentalist lyrics, all kinds of rhythmic and harmonic surprises, and a filter that made John Lennon sound like God singing through a foghorn".|$|E
500|$|At {{the end of}} {{the ninth}} century, Æthelred and Æthelflæd {{fortified}} Worcester, with the permission of King Alfred and at the request of Bishop Werferth, described in the charter as [...] "their friend". They granted the church of Worcester a half share of the rights of lordship over the city, covering land rents and the proceeds of justice, and in return the cathedral community agreed in perpetuity to dedicate a psalm to them three <b>times</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> <b>and</b> a mass and thirty psalms every Saturday. As the rights of lordship had previously belonged fully to the church, this represented the beginning of transfer from episcopal to secular control of the city. In 904 Bishop Werferth granted a lease of land in the city to Æthelred and Æthelflæd, to be held for the duration of their lives and that of their daughter Ælfwynn. The land was valuable, including most of the city's usable river frontage, and control of it enabled the Mercian rulers to dominate over and profit from the city.|$|E

500|$|Mandela {{was widely}} {{considered}} a charismatic leader, described by biographer Mary Benson as [...] "a born mass leader {{who could not}} help magnetizing people". He was highly image conscious and throughout his life always sought out fine quality clothes, with many commentators believing that he carried himself in a regal manner. His aristocratic heritage was repeatedly emphasised by supporters, thus contributing to his [...] "charismatic power". While living in Johannesburg in the 1950s, he cultivated {{the image of the}} [...] "African gentleman", having [...] "the pressed clothes, correct manners, and modulated public speech" [...] associated with such a position. In doing so, Lodge argued that Mandela became [...] "one of the first media politicians [...] embodying a glamour and a style that projected visually a brave new African world of modernity and freedom".

500|$|Briarcliff Farms {{intended}} {{to prove that}} optimal farming practices could be profitable. Law believed that kind treatment would produce better cattle, and was intolerant of animal abuse: [...] "Cruelty to a cow {{is the same as}} cruelty to me, and shall never be permitted on this farm." [...] He knew everyone who lived at the farms, and the farm workers knew the name of each cow (which was on a brass plate {{at the front of the}} cow's stall). The cows were sponged several <b>times</b> <b>a</b> <b>day,</b> <b>and</b> workers wore white cotton suits which were sterilized daily by boiling. Law treated his workers as intelligent co-workers, rather than laborers. Each cow was groomed before milking, and a pail of warm water and a brush would then be used on her sides, flanks and udders. The flank and udder were washed again with a one-percent creolin solution, rinsed and dried. Workers would milk into a fine wire strainer placed over a pail; during milking no talking, laughing, smoking or spitting was permitted, since such behavior was claimed to have a [...] "perceptible effect upon their milk". The workers were required to wash their hands thoroughly after cleaning the udders and before milking each cow. Each worker had a set of towels and washed, cared for and milked 15 or 16 cows. The cattle grazed from early spring until late autumn, and were in the barns only for milking. In 1901, The Trained Nurse and Hospital Review said it doubted that any other large New York-area dairy did this.|$|E
