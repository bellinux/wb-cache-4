25|$|In the 21st century, {{questions}} about the environment have become increasingly politicized, with the Left generally accepting the findings of environmental scientists about global warming and many on the Right disputing or rejecting <b>those</b> <b>findings.</b> However, the left is divided over how to effectively and equitably reduce carbon emissions: the center-left often advocates a reliance on market measures such as emissions trading or a carbon tax, while those further to the left tend to support direct government regulation and intervention either alongside or instead of market mechanisms.|$|E
25|$|A 2012 International Monetary Fund study {{concluded}} that the US financial sector has grown so large that it is slowing economic growth. New York University economist Thomas Philippon supported <b>those</b> <b>findings,</b> estimating that the US spends $300 billion too much on financial services per year, and that the sector needs to shrink by 20%. Harvard University and University of Chicago economists agreed, calculating in 2014 that workers {{in research and development}} add $5 to the GDP for each dollar they earn, but finance industry workers cause the GDP to shrink by $0.60 for every dollar they are paid. A study by the Bank for International Settlements reached similar conclusions, saying the finance industry impedes economic growth and research and development based industries.|$|E
25|$|It is {{generally}} accepted that the Bar Kokhba revolt encompassed all of Judea, namely {{the villages of}} Judean hills, the Judean desert and northern parts of the Negev desert. The minimalistic approach limits {{the borders of the}} war to these areas, but there are also significant findings which may support a wider view of the extent of the revolt. Among <b>those</b> <b>findings</b> are the rebel hideout systems in the Galilee, which greatly resemble the Bar Kokhba hideouts in Judea, and though are less numerous, are nevertheless important. Several historians theorize that the Tel Shalem arch depicted a major battle between Roman armies and Bar Kokhba's rebels in Bet Shean valley, thus extending the battle areas some 50km northwards from Judea. The 2013 discovery of the military camp of Legio VI Ferrata near Tel Megiddo, and ongoing excavations there may shed light to extension of the rebellion to the northern valleys. A 2015 archaeological survey in Samaria identified some 40 hideout cave systems from the period, some containing Bar Kokhba's minted coins, suggesting that the war raged in Samaria at high intensity. There is also evidence to support war operations on the coastal plain and as far as Transjordan.|$|E

500|$|The silky sifaka was {{initially}} described in 1871 by French naturalist Alfred Grandidier in a formally published letter to French zoologist Alphonse Milne-Edwards. [...] Grandidier's description {{was based on}} his own observations north of Antongil Bay {{in the last few}} months of 1870. [...] He then named the species Propithecus candidus due to its white color, which he likened to that of Verreaux's sifaka (Propithecus verreauxi), but without the dark fur on its head or the ash-colored spot on the back. [...] The first specimen was obtained in 1872 and provided by a [...] "Monsieur Guinet", a planter from Sambava. [...] The specimen allowed both Grandidier and Milne-Edwards to more thoroughly describe the species based on its skin, coat, and skull.

Upon further review in 1875, Grandidier demoted the silky sifaka to a variety or [...] "race" [...] of the diademed sifaka.

40|$|Previous {{research}} efforts {{have sought to}} determine whether violent video games cause increases in aggressive behavior. The resulting literature is controversial. <b>Those</b> <b>finding</b> the effect {{may not have the}} desired degree of experimental control, while <b>those</b> not <b>finding</b> the effect may not always have the required statistical precision. Game difficulty is also thought to potentially cause changes in aggression. Finally, prenatal testosterone exposure, as measured by the ratio of lengths of the index and ring fingers (2 D: 4 D digit ratio), is thought to cause dispositional increases in aggressive behavior. In the present research, game violence and game difficulty were manipulated in a tightly-controlled modified-game paradigm. Participants played a game, were provoked, and then had an opportunity to aggress against another participant in the study. Neither game violence nor game difficulty was found to influence aggressive behavior in a theory-consistent way, and Bayesian model comparison techniques favored the null hypothesis over all theory-derived alternative hypotheses. Similarly, 2 D: 4 D ratio did not predict aggressive behavior, either alone or in interaction with the other study variables. The results suggest that brief exposure to violent or difficult games does not influence aggressive behavior when game stimuli are closely matched, and furthermore, that 2 D: 4 D digit ratio does not predict aggression...|$|R

2500|$|However, many of {{the aspects}} of the social-democratic welfare state {{continued}} to function at a high level, due {{in no small part}} to the high rate of unionization in Sweden, the independence of unions in wage-setting, and the exemplary competency of the feminized public sector workforce, as well as widespread public support.
