5|$|The main <b>title</b> <b>music,</b> a tense, hurtling piece, {{sets the}} tone of {{impending}} violence, and returns three times on the soundtrack. Though nothing shocking occurs during the first 15–20 minutes of the film, the <b>title</b> <b>music</b> remains in the audience's mind, lending tension to these early scenes. Herrmann also maintains tension through the slower moments in the film {{through the use of}} ostinato.|$|E
5|$|In {{the context}} of Anglophone music, the term Antillean music most {{commonly}} refers to Trinidad and Tobago, home to the well-known calypso style. Music author Peter Manuel, for example, treats all the Anglophone islands as a subject of Trinidadian calypso traditions, while using the <b>title</b> <b>Music</b> of the Lesser Antilles for Francophone Antillean music. Manuel also, like many authors, treats Suriname and Guyana as integral aspects of Caribbean music; due to the Dutch colonial history of both countries, they are often grouped with Aruba and the Netherlands Antilles.|$|E

5|$|The series' title {{sequence}} {{was created}} by production studio Elastic for HBO. Creative director Angus Wall and his collaborators received the 2011 Primetime Emmy Award for Main Title Design for the sequence, which depicts a three-dimensional map of the series' fictional world. The map is projected {{on the inside of}} a sphere which is centrally lit by a small sun in an armillary sphere. As the camera moves across the map, focusing on the locations of the episode's events, clockwork mechanisms intertwine and allow buildings and other structures to emerge from the map. Accompanied by the <b>title</b> <b>music,</b> the names of the principal cast and creative staff appear. The sequence concludes after about 90 seconds with the title card and brief opening credits indicating the episode's writer(s) and director. Its composition changes as the story progresses, with new locations replacing those featuring less prominently or not at all.|$|E

25|$|A {{title for}} the series had not been decided when {{production}} began. Names including Dimension 4, The Edge of Tomorrow and From the Unknown were considered before settling on Out of the Unknown. The <b>title</b> <b>music</b> was composed by Norman Kay and the title sequence was created by Bernard Lodge. It was intended from an early stage that, as with Boris Karloff on Out of this World, each story would be introduced by a regular host. Christopher Lee and Vincent Price were approached but were not available and the idea was dropped. The episode “Some Lapse of Time” is notable for having Ridley Scott, future director of such films as Alien, Blade Runner and Gladiator, as designer.|$|E
500|$|Djawadi {{said that}} he was {{inspired}} to write the main <b>title</b> <b>music</b> by an early version of the series's computer-animated title sequence. [...] The theme would be repeated all through the series, particularly at important scenes. Many of the recordings were done by solo musicians, while the larger pieces are recorded with a full orchestra and a choir in Prague. [...] The recordings were done with Djawadi communicating with the musicians in Prague over the internet.|$|E

500|$|In it, Jerry Seinfeld {{tries to}} avoid meeting an old {{childhood}} friend, Joel Horneck (Kevin Dunn). Jerry's neighbor, Kramer, conceptualizes [...] "a pizza {{place where you}} make your own pie". The episode was written by Larry David and Jerry Seinfeld, and was the first filmed episode directed by Tom Cherones. This was the first episode produced with Elaine Benes (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) as a character. It also was the first episode to use Jonathan Wolff's <b>title</b> <b>music.</b> This is the only Seinfeld episode whose title does not begin with the definite article [...] "The".|$|E
500|$|... "Long John Peter" [...] {{contained}} several {{pop culture}} references. When Chris sees Anna {{for the first}} time, he starts singing the song [...] "Crazy for You", which was originally performed by Madonna in the film Vision Quest (1985). When Peter is fighting a British man, the <b>title</b> <b>music</b> from The Sea Hawk (1940), composed by Erich Wolfgang Korngold, is used. The episode imagines {{what it would be}} like if Michael J. Fox, who has [...] Parkinson's disease, would star as Zorro. In a trailer for a film, the tune from Coldplay's [...] "Clocks" [...] is played.|$|E
500|$|This episode {{features}} different <b>title</b> <b>music</b> {{from the}} pilot; this music, composed by Jonathan Wolff, is {{used throughout the}} rest of the series. The standup interstitials for this episode were recorded twice. Originally, the set for the interstitials was brightly lit and was designed to look like that of a church basement, but then it was remade to look like a nightclub and the material was performed again. The scene that was set in the bank was originally set in a dry cleaner's. However, this was moved and some of the material was moved to a later episode called [...] "The Stock Tip".|$|E

500|$|The theme melody was a {{variation}} on the Blackadder theme by Howard Goodall over opening title images of Blackadder and George parading their men past Melchett and Darling, while Baldrick plays the triangle. The <b>title</b> <b>music</b> starts with the opening bars of [...] "The British Grenadiers" [...] before segueing into the familiar Blackadder theme. In the closing credits, the full Blackadder theme plays over visuals of armed men marching on a parade ground. The sequences were filmed and recorded on location at the former Colchester Cavalry Barracks, with the production using fifty members of the 3rd Battalion, the Royal Anglian Regiment to represent Blackadder's men, attired in reproduction First World War uniforms, with the battalion's band providing the music.|$|E
500|$|Composer James Horner {{returned}} to score The Search for Spock, fulfilling a promise {{he had made}} to Bennett on The Wrath of Khan. While Nimoy considered hiring his friend Leonard Rosenman for the score, he was persuaded that Horner's return would grant continuity between The Wrath of Khan and the new film. Much like {{the content of the}} film, Horner's music was a direct continuation of the score he wrote for the previous film. When writing music for The Wrath of Khan, Horner was aware he would reuse certain cues for an impending sequel; two major themes he reworked were for Genesis and Spock. While the Genesis theme supplants the <b>title</b> <b>music</b> Horner wrote for The Wrath of Khan, the end credits were quoted [...] "almost verbatim".|$|E
500|$|James Horner, {{composer}} for The Wrath of Khan and The Search for Spock, {{declined to}} return for The Voyage Home. Nimoy turned to his friend Leonard Rosenman, who had written the music to Fantastic Voyage, Ralph Bakshi's The Lord of the Rings, and two Planet of the Apes sequels. Rosenman wrote an arrangement of Alexander Courage's Star Trek television theme as the <b>title</b> <b>music</b> for The Voyage Home, but Nimoy requested an original composition. Music critic Jeff Bond writes, [...] "The final result {{was one of the}} most unusual Star Trek movie themes," [...] consisting of a six-note theme and variations set against a repetitious four-note brass motif; the theme's bridge borrows content from Rosenman's [...] "Frodo March" [...] for The Lord of the Rings. The melody is played in the beginning of the film on Vulcan and the scenes of Taylor's search for Kirk to help find her whales.|$|E

500|$|Barry Gray {{considered}} the musical score for Thunderbird 6 superior {{to that of}} Thunderbirds Are Go since its depiction of round-the-world travel provided scope for {{a large number of}} musical themes. Music was recorded in six sessions at the Olympic Studios at Barnes, London, between 1 and 5 February [...] 1968, with an orchestra of 56 members. The main <b>title</b> <b>music,</b> described as [...] "jaunty" [...] in Gerry Anderson's biography, accompanies opening credits superimposed on shots of Skyship One as it sits on the NWAC airfield. The soundtrack was released in a limited edition in 2005. A rendition of the 19th-century song [...] "The Daring Young Man on the Flying Trapeze" [...] accompanies the aerial shots which chart Alan and Tin-Tin's departure from Tracy Island {{at the start of the}} film. Director David Lane wanted the movements of the Tiger Moth to simulate a dance in mid-air, and to this end played the song on loudspeakers from the shooting helicopter to inspire the stunt pilot.|$|E
500|$|Commodore 64 {{magazine}} Zzap!64 reviewers were mixed. Jaz Rignall said it {{was among}} the best arcade adventures on the Commodore 64 since it had the right balance of frustration and addiction to keep him playing the ZX Spectrum version for weeks. Gary Penn, however, considered the game average when it first released for the ZX Spectrum and thought that the port of the year-old game had out-of-date sounds, out-of-tune <b>title</b> <b>music,</b> and was overall not among the Commodore 64's best adventure games. Gary Liddon thought that the Commodore 64 version appeared [...] "crude" [...] compared to other releases for the platform, though perhaps par for the ZX Spectrum. The magazine noted the difficulty of traversing the vertical caverns and found the eagles annoying, especially when they dropped Sabreman to his death. Zzap!64 critics felt that the game presented well, but was less accessible, overpriced for its age, and poorly animated. Ultimately, they considered the game better than the developer's previous two 1985 releases, but {{not as good as}} it could have been. The Computer and Video Games review of the Commodore 64 release judged otherwise: that the version was up to the developer's standards and worth the yearlong wait. The magazine praised Firebird's work on the port.|$|E
