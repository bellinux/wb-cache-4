5|$|No Lifeguard on Duty: The Accidental Life of the World's First Supermodel is an {{autobiography}} by fashion model, photographer, author and talent agent Janice Dickinson. It {{was published in}} hardcover format in 2002 by ReganBooks, an imprint of HarperCollins. The author's friend make-up artist Way Bandy advised her to begin putting her past experiences down on paper {{as a form of}} therapy from prior trauma in her life. After gaining sobriety, she started compiling her notes into book format. She contacted book publisher Judith Regan who agreed to help her publish her book after hearing her tale on the phone, without first seeing a writing sample. In November 2014, Dickinson asserted in an interview with Entertainment <b>Tonight</b> <b>that</b> pressure from Bill Cosby and his lawyers resulted in the removal of an account of sexual assault and rape by Cosby when she visited him at a hotel in Lake Tahoe, California in 1982. After Cosby's attorney disputed this account, she reappeared on the program to proclaim she was telling the truth and explained she was speaking out publicly because of a need to be heard and to represent other women who stated they experienced a similar trauma.|$|E

The divorce became final in 2004, with a judge ruling that Roan should remain primarily with Bronstein, with Stone receiving visitation rights. In 2011, Stone stated on Piers Morgan <b>Tonight</b> <b>that</b> she was never married to George Howe Englund, Jr., despite rumors to the contrary, particularly on the Internet.|$|E

500|$|In late March, viewers started {{noticing that}} Jennings' voice sounded uncharacteristically gravelly and {{unhealthy}} during evening newscasts. On April 1, 2005, he anchored World News Tonight {{for the last}} time; his failing health also prevented him from covering the death and funeral of Pope John Paul II. On April 5, 2005, Jennings informed viewers through a taped message on World News <b>Tonight</b> <b>that</b> he {{had been diagnosed with}} lung cancer, and was starting chemotherapy treatment the following week. [...] "As some of you now know, I have learned {{in the last couple of}} days that I have lung cancer," [...] he said. [...] "Yes, I was a smoker until about 20 years ago, and I was weak and I smoked over 9/11. But whatever the reason, the news does slow you down a bit." [...] Although he stated his intention to continue anchoring whenever possible, the message was to be his last appearance on television.|$|E

500|$|Robert Bianco for USA Today noted {{after the}} episode [...] "Showmance": [...] "Jessalyn Gilsig's self-centered, ridiculously strident Terri {{just needs to}} go, period." [...] Shawna Malcom for the Los Angeles Times deemed Terri [...] "beyond annoying" [...] in the {{following}} episode, [...] "Acafellas", but wrote: [...] "I have confidence that creator Ryan Murphy will flesh out Jessalyn Gilsig’s character over time. Her seemingly sincere apology to Will for not being more supportive of his boy band was a nice first step." [...] Eric Goldman for IGN commented after the episode [...] "Preggers": [...] "So far, Terri has been an incredibly unlikable character. More firmly establishing her as this devilish type of schemer at least pushes her far {{enough to make her}} actions entertaining, even as we root against her." [...] Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly noted of the episode [...] "Throwdown": [...] "the pregnancy subplot is dragging down the show, and <b>tonight</b> <b>that</b> subplot nearly derailed an otherwise-excellent episode. Terri's fake pregnancy and Quinn’s real one started out a few weeks ago as an interesting way to insert some realism and tension into a delightfully surreal musical-comedy universe. By now, however, I watch Glee and feel sorry for Jessalyn Gilsig. I’ll bet the actress didn’t initially sign on to have her character Terri become a shrill, lying nag whose main function is to bring husband Will — and by extension, us — down." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{pictures}} of Spears and Trawick carrying replica guns on set surfaced online, the Hackney London Borough Council criticized her for [...] "promoting gun violence", since {{the area had}} been badly affected by the 2011 England riots.

Councillor Ian Rathbone added that Spears should apologize and make a sizeable donation to a Hackney charity [...] "for the rudeness and damage she's done to this community." [...] When asked if she thought the council was overreacting, Hackney MP Diane Abbott insisted: [...] "It is only a music video but it's images like this, with popstars glamorising gangs, which means that some young people... get drawn in. Britney should really know better." [...] Rae Alexandra of the SF Weekly explained that the United Kingdom [...] "is not a place that readily embraces guns. Rather, it's a place where guns are rare, gun licensing is tightly controlled, and the entire establishment has been in a panic about gun use on its streets for the last three years." [...] On September 26, 2011, Spears' representatives released a statement to MTV News saying, [...] "The video is a fantasy story featuring Britney's boyfriend, Jason Trawick, which literally plays out the lyrics of a song written three years before the riots ever happened."
