5|$|As {{a result}} of {{infestation}} by this aphid, leaves of sugar beet become swollen, roll, and cease developing. The roots grow poorly and the sugar content is reduced. In some other plants the leaves do not become distorted but growth is affected and flowers abort due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>action</b> of the toxic saliva injected by the aphid to improve the flow of sap.|$|E

5|$|In many vertebrates, the {{esophagus}} is lined by stratified squamous epithelium without glands. In fish, {{the esophagus}} is often lined with columnar epithelium, and in amphibians, sharks and rays, the esophageal epithelium is ciliated, helping to wash food along, in addition <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>action</b> of muscular peristalsis. In addition, in the bat Plecotus auritus, fish and some amphibians, glands secreting pepsinogen or hydrochloric acid have been found.|$|E
5|$|Nuclear Strike is a helicopter-based game, with {{strategy}} elements added <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>action</b> gameplay. The plot concerns {{an elite}} special force - the player's allies - pursuing a nuclear-armed rogue spy through a fictionalised Asian setting. It retained the earlier game's engine but added several modifications to improve graphical performance {{and make the}} game more accessible. The game features 15 playable vehicles, a large increase from previous games. In addition to the main fictionalised Apache, there are secondary helicopters, jets, armour and a hovercraft. The player also commands ground troops in occasional real-time strategy sections.|$|E

5|$|The Moon crosses {{from south}} to {{north of the}} {{ecliptic}} at its ascending node, and vice versa at its descending node. However, the nodes of the Moon's orbit are gradually moving in a retrograde motion, due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>action</b> of the Sun's gravity on the Moon's motion, and they make a complete circuit every 18.6 years. This regression means that the time between each passage of the Moon through the ascending node is slightly shorter than the sidereal month. This period is called the nodical or draconic month.|$|E
5|$|A 3km {{protection}} zone, 10km {{surveillance zone}} and a restricted zone encompassing 2000km2 were set up. Another 159,000 turkeys were slaughtered with the cull being completed {{on the evening}} of 5 February. Also on 5 February there was criticism that nearby farmers had not been advised as <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>action</b> to be taken. Around 320 workers at the plant were given anti-viral drugs. Although a vet from the site was admitted into hospital, suffering from a 'mild respiratory illness' during the evening of 6 February, it was found not to be bird flu. The plant was thoroughly disinfected, with cleaning complete on 12 February, and permission being given for production to resume.|$|E
5|$|Dinocephalosaurus {{may also}} have used its neck to capture its prey via suction feeding. After flexing its neck to the side (which would have been {{facilitated}} by the slenderness of the cervical ribs), the act of straightening the neck would have caused the cervical ribs to splay outwards due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>action</b> of the neck muscles attached to the ribs. As the head lunged forward, {{the volume of the}} esophagus would have increased, creating suction. Once the prey was caught, the fang-like teeth would have secured the prey in the mouth. Like other aquatic amniotes, Dinocephalosaurus would have swallowed and digested its prey head-first, as evinced by the preservation of a perleidid fish in the abdominal region of LPV 30280 from Luoping.|$|E

5|$|General {{relativity}} is a metric {{theory of}} gravitation. At its core are Einstein's equations, which describe {{the relation between}} the geometry of a four-dimensional, pseudo-Riemannian manifold representing spacetime, and the energy–momentum contained in that spacetime. Phenomena that in classical mechanics are ascribed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>action</b> of the force of gravity (such as free-fall, orbital motion, and spacecraft trajectories), correspond to inertial motion within a curved geometry of spacetime in general relativity; there is no gravitational force deflecting objects from their natural, straight paths. Instead, gravity corresponds to changes in the properties of space and time, which in turn changes the straightest-possible paths that objects will naturally follow. The curvature is, in turn, caused by the energy–momentum of matter. Paraphrasing the relativist John Archibald Wheeler, spacetime tells matter how to move; matter tells spacetime how to curve.|$|E
5|$|In early 1943, an {{underground}} Jewish resistance organisation was formed at Treblinka {{with the goal}} of seizing control of the camp and escaping to freedom. The planned revolt was preceded by a long period of secret preparations. The clandestine unit was first organised by a former Jewish captain of the Polish Army, Dr. Julian Chorążycki, who was described by fellow plotter Samuel Rajzman as noble and essential <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>action.</b> His organising committee included Zelomir Bloch (leadership), Rudolf Masaryk, Marceli Galewski, Samuel Rajzman, Dr. Irena Lewkowska ("Irka", from the sick bay for the Hiwis), Leon Haberman, Hershl (Henry) Sperling from Częstochowa, and several others. Chorążycki (who treated the German patients) killed himself with poison on 19 April 1943 when faced with imminent capture, so that the Germans could not discover the plot by torturing him. The next leader was another former Polish Army officer, Dr. Berek Lajcher, who arrived on 1 May. Born in Częstochowa, he had practised medicine in Wyszków and was expelled by the Nazis to Wegrów in 1939.|$|E
5|$|Jagdgeschwader 3 (JG 3) and Kampfgeschwader 51 (KG 51) were {{tasked with}} {{eliminating}} the Allied units at the Eindhoven base and Gilze-Rijen airfield.

Some 22 Bf 109s of I./JG 3 took off, along with four from Stab./JG 3, 15 from III./JG 3 and 19 Fw 190s from IV./JG 3. KG 51 contributed some 21 of their 30 Messerschmitt Me 262 jets <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>action.</b> Some histories mistakenly include Kampfgeschwader 76 (KG 76) {{on the order of}} battle, but KG 76 did not take part in the mission.|$|E

5|$|Józef Piłsudski, Polish commander-in-chief, {{determined}} that regaining control of Vilnius, whose population consisted mostly of Poles and Jews, {{should be a}} priority of the renascent Polish state. He {{had been working on}} plans to take control of Vilnius since at least March; he gave preliminary orders to prepare a push in that direction—and counter an expected Soviet westward push—on March 26. One of Piłsudski's objectives was to take control of Vilnius before Western diplomats at the Paris Peace Conference could rule on whom the city, demanded by various factions, should be given <b>to.</b> <b>The</b> <b>action</b> was not discussed with Polish politicians or the government, who at that time were more concerned with the situation on the southern Polish–Ukrainian front. By early April, when members of the Kresy Defence Committee (Komitet Obrony Kresów) Michał Pius Römer, Aleksander Prystor, Witold Abramowicz, and Kazimierz Świtalski met with Pilsudski, stressing the plight of occupied Vilnius and its inhabitants' need for self-government, Piłsudski was ready to move.|$|E
5|$|More {{disturbing}} to Lord Howe were {{the actions of}} HMS Russell and HMS Caesar. Russell's captain John Willett Payne was criticised at the time for failing to get {{to grips with the}} enemy more closely and allowing her opponent Téméraire to badly damage her rigging in the early stages, although later commentators blamed damage received on 29 May for her poor start <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>action.</b> There were no such excuses, however, for Captain Anthony Molloy of Caesar, who totally failed in his duty to engage the enemy. Molloy completely ignored Howe's signal and continued ahead as if the British battleline was following him rather than engaging the French fleet directly. Caesar did participate in a desultory exchange of fire with the leading French ship Trajan but her fire had little effect, while Trajan inflicted much damage to Caesar's rigging and was subsequently able to attack Bellerophon as well, roaming unchecked through the melee developing {{at the head of the}} line.|$|E
5|$|Pouring mercury onto a {{horizontal}} flat sheet of glass {{results in a}} puddle that has a perceptible thickness. The puddle will spread out only {{to the point where}} it is a little under half a centimetre thick, and no thinner. Again this is due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>action</b> of mercury's strong surface tension. The liquid mass flattens out because that brings as much of the mercury to as low a level as possible, but the surface tension, at the same time, is acting to reduce the total surface area. The result of the compromise is a puddle of a nearly fixed thickness.|$|E

The invasion never occurred since hostilities between Japan and the United States came to an end. The 2nd Battalion, 9th Marines was sent to Camp Pendelton where, in December 1945, it was once again disbanded.|$|E
5|$|The {{gameplay}} of Kingdom Hearts II {{is similar}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>action</b> RPG and hack and slash gameplay {{of the first}} Kingdom Hearts game, though developers {{made an effort to}} address some of the complaints with the previous game.

Most of the gameplay occurs on interconnected field maps where battles take place. The game is driven by a linear progression from one story event to the next, usually told via cutscenes, though there are numerous side-quests available that provide bonuses to characters.|$|E
