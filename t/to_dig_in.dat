5|$|On December 11, General Walter M. Robertson, {{commander}} of the battle-hardened 2nd Infantry Division, was ordered to attack and seize the Roer River dams. In case he had to pull back, he chose Elsenborn Ridge as his defensive line. General Walter E. Lauer, commanding the 99th Infantry Division, was charged with building up the defenses around Elsenborn Ridge. Lauer knew his front was extremely long and very thinly manned; he gave instructions to his division's soldiers <b>to</b> <b>dig</b> <b>in</b> and build cover for their foxholes.|$|E
5|$|The 6th Airlanding Brigade, {{with the}} Belgians and Dutch under its command, {{had to contend}} with German delaying tactics. The lead battalions {{advanced}} under heavy mortar and machine gun fire, until stopped by a strong defensive position at Cabourg. The 1st Battalion, Royal Ulster Rifles, unable to outflank the position, were ordered <b>to</b> <b>dig</b> <b>in.</b> The next day, the battalion was relieved by the Belgians and moved to a brigade concentration point, first at Le Plein and then at Troan, which they reached by the morning of 21August. The 6th Airlanding Brigade advance continued from here with the 12th Battalion, Devonshire Regiment in the lead. The battalion was unopposed until that afternoon, when they had several casualties from German mortar and machine-gun fire. With night approaching the battalion had <b>to</b> <b>dig</b> <b>in,</b> and prepared to continue the advance the next day. At 03:00 on 22August, the battalion started an outflanking attack on Branville, which they occupied by 08:00, and later the same day they liberated Vauville and Deauville, where they secured the high ground {{to the north of the}} town.|$|E
5|$|Acting on Almond's instruction, Smith {{ordered the}} 5th Marines to attack west toward Mupyong-ni on 27 November. The attack was soon stalled by the PVA 89th Division {{and forced the}} Marines <b>to</b> <b>dig</b> <b>in</b> on the ridges {{surrounding}} Yudam-ni. As night came, three Chinese regiments of the 79th Division attacked the ridges on the north and northwest of Yudam-ni, hoping to annihilate the garrison in one stroke. Close range fighting soon developed as the attackers infiltrated Marine positions, but the 5th and 7th Marines held the line while inflicting heavy casualties to the Chinese. As day broke on 28 November, the Chinese forces and the American defenders were locked in a stalemate around the Yudam-ni perimeter.|$|E

5|$|After the 2/48th Battalion {{completed}} its training with the 9th Division at Cyrenaica, they were moved further {{along the coast}} to Gazala. Then, just as they began <b>to</b> <b>dig</b> <b>in,</b> the battalion was abruptly withdrawn to Tobruk {{in response to the}} German Afrika Korps' advance. They entered Tobruk on 9 April 1941, and spent the following eight months besieged by Axis forces. While there, Derrick acquired an Italian Breda machine gun and regularly led fighting patrols against both German and Italian troops. Although Derrick's bravery was noted during the siege, he wrote in his diary about his constant fear of dying.|$|E
5|$|At 01:30 on 7 June, the 9th Parachute Battalion, {{with only}} around ninety {{men at the}} time, marched through the unoccupied Bréville. Upon arrival at the 3rd Parachute Brigade's position, the {{parachute}} battalion was ordered <b>to</b> <b>dig</b> <b>in</b> at {{the northern end of}} the brigade line. They would be responsible for defending an area from the Château Saint Come, across a clearing in the woods, to a house known as the Bois de Mont. To their front was a stretch of open land leading to Bréville-les-Monts and the road from Amfreville to Le Mesnil-les-Monts. A shortage in their numbers left a large gap between the 9th Parachute Battalion and No. 6 Commando, the most southern unit in the commando defensive position, to their north.|$|E
5|$|At 15:30 on 21 August the Battle for Hill 60 began. Charging {{straight}} at the hill, the regiment suffered sixty per cent casualties, among them Hutton in command. He was replaced by Major Hurst, from the 1st Squadron, and they succeeded in capturing the Turkish trench within fifteen minutes of going over the top. But {{on either side of}} them the rest of the attack had failed, leaving the regiment and the Otago Mounted Rifles isolated {{from the rest of the}} force. Not having the manpower to continue the assault, they were ordered <b>to</b> <b>dig</b> <b>in</b> and hold the position. They held on until 23 August when they were relieved by the Auckland and Wellington Mounted Rifles.|$|E

50|$|Tanks {{became more}} {{effective}} as {{the lesson of}} the early tanks was absorbed. The British produced the Mark IV in 1917. Similar to the early Marks in appearance, its construction was considered to produce a more reliable machine, the long-barrelled naval guns were shortened (the barrels of the earlier, longer guns were prone <b>to</b> <b>digging</b> <b>in</b> the mud when negotiating obstacles) and armour was increased just enough to defeat the standard German armour-piercing bullet.|$|R
5|$|Gum-digging was {{the major}} source of income for {{settlers}} in Northland, and farmers often worked the gumfields in the winter months to subsidise the poor income from their unbroken land. By the 1890s, 20,000 people were engaged in gum-digging, of which 7000 worked full-time. Gum-digging was not restricted to settlers or workers in the rural areas; Auckland families would cross the Waitematā Harbour by ferry at weekends <b>to</b> <b>dig</b> <b>in</b> the fields around Birkenhead, causing damage to public roads and private farms, and leading to local council management of the problem.|$|E
5|$|In a {{follow-up}} to Operation Goodwood on 19 July, the Calgary Highlanders attempted to take the northern spur of Verrières Ridge but German mortar fire limited their progress. Tanks from the Sherbrooke Fusiliers were sent to support the battalion and eliminated several machine-gun positions {{on either side of}} Point67. The Highlanders eventually managed <b>to</b> <b>dig</b> <b>in,</b> despite accurate return fire. Over the next few hours, they strengthened their position and the 5th and 6th Canadian Infantry Brigades made repeated attempts to exploit the gains. Against a tenacious German defense and minor infantry and tank counterattacks, the Canadians were broadly repulsed with heavy casualties. Simonds rapidly prepared a new offensive for the following day, with the goals of capturing both {{the eastern side of the}} Orne river and the main slopes of Verrières Ridge.|$|E

The small French force repelled several direct attacks and endured a series of artillery bombardments. Two of the three strong points of the outpost eventually fell {{in the early morning}} of May 18, and by midday the French force lay defeated.|$|E

5|$|On {{the morning}} of 1 December, 3rd Battalion, 7th Marines (3/7) engaged the PVA 175th Regiment of the 59th Division at Hill 1542 and Hill 1419. The {{tenacious}} Chinese defenders soon forced the Marines <b>to</b> <b>dig</b> <b>in</b> on the slopes between {{the road and the}} peaks when the convoy passed 3/7's position by the afternoon. With Hagaru-ri still not captured, the PVA High Command scrambled the 79th Division to resume attacks on Yudam-ni while the 89th Division rushed south towards Koto-ri. The Chinese struck at night, and the ferocious fighting forced the rear covering forces to call in night fighters to suppress the attacks. The fighting lasted well into {{the morning of}} 2 December until all the Marines managed to withdraw from Yudam-ni.|$|E

This force was headed by the battalion commander's deputy, who was killed in action in the battle. On May 13, the battalion commander {{declared a state of emergency}} in the area from May 15 until further notice. He authorized his men to seize all necessary arms from the settlements and urged them <b>to</b> <b>dig</b> <b>in</b> and build fortifications as fast as possible, and to mobilize all the necessary work force to do so.|$|E

Juveniles primarily subsist on benthic invertebrates such as polychaetes, copepods, amphipods, isopods, crangon shrimp, and euphausiids. Individuals {{have been found}} with the denticles on the snout worn smooth, indicating that the snout is used <b>to</b> <b>dig</b> <b>in</b> the mud or sand to obtain bivalve mollusks.|$|E
5|$|A Company {{attacked}} the ridgeline {{to the north}} of the road to Chonju just prior to dusk, this time without the support of the Sherman tanks. The Australians again came under heavy fire from the North Koreans, however they quickly overcame the defenders and the ridge was secured by 17:30. During the fighting for the northern position, three North Korean T-34 tanks dug-in on the ridgeline had been destroyed by the Australians at short range with new M20 3.5-inch bazookas, which now proved to be effective anti-armour weapons despite difficulties experienced in their use at Kujin several days before. During the day's fighting, a total of 11 T-34 tanks and two SU-76 self-propelled guns had been destroyed by the Australian infantry and American tanks, contrary to the reports of their destruction by USAF airstrikes earlier in the day. Expecting a counter-attack, Green then ordered B Company forward to occupy positions along the road in between the positions held by D and A Companies, while Battalion headquarters moved in behind B Company, with C Company held in reserve at the rear with Support Company. After conducting a limited resupply of the forward companies, the Australians hastily began <b>to</b> <b>dig</b> <b>in.</b>|$|E
5|$|A large {{force of}} Israeli {{infantry}} and armor went east {{to block the}} road from Salt to the Allenby bridge, and they encountered the Jordanian 60th Armored Brigade trying to join the defense of Karameh. In the resulting battle, the Jordanians lost eight Patton tanks without destroying any Israeli tanks, then withdrew to the hills <b>to</b> <b>dig</b> <b>in</b> and continue firing down on the Israelis. The Israeli Air Force launched airstrikes against Jordanian armor and artillery positions, {{but was unable to}} stop the firing. Within the next two hours, Israeli artillery fire and airstrikes were launched against Jordanian defenses on the Musri-Karameh road, the Salt road, and east of Abdullah Bridge. The Israelis also consolidated their hold on Karameh with airstrikes and artillery, and began demolishing the camp. A total of 175 houses were blown up.|$|E

5|$|After {{the failure}} of the 26th Corps at Hagaru-ri, the PVA High Command ordered the 26th and the 27th Corps to chase the {{escaping}} UN force with the 20th Corps blocking the escape route. But with most of the 20th Corps destroyed at Yudam-ni and Hagaru-ri, the only forces between Koto-ri and Hungnam were the remnants of the 58th and the 60th Divisions. In desperation, Song Shi-Lun ordered these troops <b>to</b> <b>dig</b> <b>in</b> at Funchilin Pass while blowing up the vital treadway bridge, hoping the terrain and obstacles would allow the 26th and the 27th Corps {{to catch up with the}} retreating UN forces. The PVA 180th Regiment that occupied Hill 1081 blew up the original concrete bridge and two improvised replacements in succession, believing the bridge was rendered irreparable. In response, 1st Battalion, 1st Marines (1/1) attacked Hill 1081 from the south, and the hill was captured on 9 December after the defenders fought to the last man. At the same time, the 7th Marines and RCT-31 attacked the treadway bridge from the north, only to encounter defenders that were already frozen in their foxholes.|$|E
5|$|In December, Longstreet's First Corps {{played the}} decisive {{role in the}} Battle of Fredericksburg. Since Lee moved Longstreet to Fredericksburg early, it allowed Longstreet {{to take the time}} <b>to</b> <b>dig</b> <b>in</b> {{portions}} of his line, methodically site artillery, and set up a kill zone over the axis of advance he thought the Union attack would follow. Remembering the slaughter at Antietam, in which the Confederates did not construct defensive works, Longstreet ordered trenches, abatis, and fieldworks to be constructed, which would set a precedent for future defensive battles by the Army of Northern Virginia. Subsequently, Longstreet positioned his men behind a stone wall at the foot of Marye's Heights and held off fourteen assaults by Union forces. The Union army suffered almost 8,000 casualties at Marye's Heights, Longstreet only 1,000. His great defensive success was not based entirely on the advantage of terrain; this time it was the combination of terrain, defensive works, and a centralized coordination of artillery.|$|E
5|$|In cold, wet weather, the 3rd Guards Brigade made a short advance {{behind a}} ragged barrage, took the higher {{ground on the}} edge of Houthoulst Forest and cut off the rest of the spur running {{north-east}} from Veldhoek. Contact with the 17th Division on the right flank was lost, after the left flank formation of the 17th Division veered south and the crew of a contact patrol aircraft observing the advance, failed to see the loss of direction. Two platoons detailed to meet the attacking brigade of the 17th Division, had <b>to</b> <b>dig</b> <b>in</b> near the Angle Point pillbox under machine-gun fire. After dark, the Guards and the 17th Division closed the gap, by capturing the blockhouses at Angle Point and Aden House. Next day, conditions were so bad that the attacking brigade was relieved by the 1st Guards Brigade. The fresh troops patrolled vigorously to the southern edge of Houthoulst Forest, against little organised German resistance, except for extensive sniping around the Colbert cross-roads and Colombo House.|$|E
