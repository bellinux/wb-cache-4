25|$|The two {{wings of}} the army {{attempted}} to confuse and deceive the enemy about their destinations; the Confederates could not <b>tell</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> initial movements whether Sherman would march on Macon, Augusta, or Savannah. Howard's wing, led by Kilpatrick's cavalry, marched south along the railroad to Lovejoy's Station, which caused the defenders there to conduct a fighting retreat to Macon. The cavalry captured two Confederate guns at Lovejoy's Station, and then two more and 50 prisoners at Bear Creek Station. Howard's infantry marched through Jonesboro to Gordon, southwest of the state capital, Milledgeville. Slocum's wing, accompanied by Sherman, moved to the east, {{in the direction of}} Augusta. They destroyed the bridge across the Oconee River and then turned south.|$|E
25|$|The planet Venus has {{a surface}} that is 90% basalt, {{indicating}} that volcanism {{played a major}} role in shaping its surface. The planet may have had a major global resurfacing event about 500 million years ago, from what scientists can <b>tell</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> density of impact craters on the surface. Lava flows are widespread and forms of volcanism not present on Earth occur as well. Changes in the planet's atmosphere and observations of lightning have been attributed to ongoing volcanic eruptions, although there is no confirmation of whether or not Venus is still volcanically active. However, radar sounding by the Magellan probe revealed evidence for comparatively recent volcanic activity at Venus's highest volcano Maat Mons, in the form of ash flows near the summit and on the northern flank.|$|E

25|$|Cycling in Melbourne is {{a popular}} pastime, as one can <b>tell</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> bevy of cyclists and paths that lie all {{throughout}} the city, {{as well as a}} spectator sport. Melbourne's flat terrain and extensive off-road paths in green wedges are conducive to riding. Beach Road combines with the Nepean Highway to form a 90-kilometre stretch from Port Melbourne to Sorrento, incorporating the Bayside Trail. It is the city's most popular training route and attracts cyclists from around the world. Thousands of commuters cycle the roads, bike lanes and bike paths daily. Bicycle Victoria's annual events, Around the Bay in a Day and Ride to Work Day, attract tens of thousands of Melburnians. Other events such as the Herald Sun Tour begin and end in the Melbourne area and there are many local cycling events of varying grades all year round.|$|E

[...] The following year, in 1935, both of these were reprinted by Postmaster General James A. Farley as special issues given to officials and friends.

500|$|Sun {{dogs were}} {{apparently}} well known during the Middle Ages, {{as they are}} mentioned in the Old Farmer's Almanac (Bondepraktikan) which states that the phenomenon forecasts strong winds, and also rain if the sun dogs are more pale than red. According to the passage in the Vasa Chronicle, however, both Petri and {{the master of the}} mint Anders Hansson were sincerely troubled by the appearance of these sun dogs. [...] Petri interpreted the signs over Stockholm as a warning from God and had the Vädersolstavlan painting produced and hung in front of his congregation. [...] Notwithstanding this devotion, he was far from certain on how to interpret these signs and in a sermon delivered in late summer 1535, he explained {{there are two kinds of}} omens: one produced by the Devil to allure mankind away from God, and another produced by God to attract mankind away from the Devil — one being hopelessly difficult to <b>tell</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> other. He therefore saw it as his duty to warn both his congregation, mostly composed of German burghers united by their conspiracy against the king, and the king himself.|$|E

500|$|In June 2003, Gravel gave {{a speech}} on direct {{democracy}} at a conference hosted by the American Free Press. The event was cosponsored by the Barnes Review, a journal that endorses Holocaust denial. In the wake of criticism for his appearance, Gravel has said repeatedly {{that he does not}} share such a view, stating, [...] "You better believe I know that six million Jews were killed. I've been to the Holocaust Museum. I've seen the footage of General Eisenhower touring one of the camps. They're [...] nutty as loons if they don't think it happened". The newspaper had intended to interview Gravel about the National Initiative. Gravel later recounted the background to the event:"He [...] liked the idea of the National Initiative. I figured it was an opportunity to discuss it. Whether it is the far right, far left, whatever, I'll make my pitch to them. They gave me a free subscription to American Free Press. They still send it to me today. I flip through it sometimes. It has some extreme views, {{and a lot of the}} ads in it are even more extreme and make me want to upchuck. Anyways, sometime later, Carto contacted me to speak at that Barnes Review Conference. I had never heard of the Barnes Review, didn't know anything about it or what they stood for. I was just coming to give a presentation about the National Initiative. I was there maybe 30 minutes. I could <b>tell</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> people in the room (mainly some very old men) that they were pretty extreme. I gave my speech, answered some questions and left.

500|$|Joshua Rothkopf of Time Out New York {{referred}} {{to being a}} [...] "must-see danceumentary."

Rothkopf stated that: [...] "But the true value of this raw rehearsal footage is its emphasis, less known, on MJ's laserlike attention to detail, as he works his band and troupe up to speed. A firm floor manager himself, he's often exposed — and probably wouldn't have approved of this film. (One on one, High School Musicals Kenny Ortega, meanwhile, treats him with kid gloves: [...] "I agree, Michael.") But to see him sweetly lose himself in [...] "Human Nature" [...] ("I like living this way...") is to feel a creature of the stage finally returned home, and possibly on the cusp of redemption." [...] Peter Paras, of E! Online felt that watching Jackson and his performances in a positive aspect is the [...] "genius and the sadness of the entire film." [...] He did note that Jackson's performance of [...] "Earth Song," [...] which consists of using Jackson's voiceover to emphasize his environmental concerns while a bulldozer threatens to eat him, was well-intentioned — because it brought attention to environmental concerns — but felt it was a little over the top. Paras felt the film showed an [...] "exacting and refreshingly funny side of Jackson to be revealed" [...] and [...] "had Jackson lived, we never would have seen those moments" [...] and felt the film was a proper way to [...] "finally say goodbye" [...] to Jackson.|$|E
500|$|Live from Paris {{received}} generally favourable {{reviews from}} critics.

He concluded by calling the audio CD of Live from Paris a [...] "compilation [...] covers in a good way her musical spectrum" [...] and the DVD [...] "fantastic" [...] due to [...] "the high quality of the sound and the video"; he also commented that the live album [...] "offers a good overview of Shakira's musical career". Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic complimented the energy of the audio CD and Shakira's versatility, commenting she [...] "leans heavily on glitzy electro-dance crossovers but finds room for quieter moments, whether it’s a stripped-down cover of Metallica's [...] "Nothing Else Matters" [...] or her own [...] "Gypsy", keeping the momentum running throughout a lengthy set, then bringing down the house with [...] "Waka Waka". He, however, found the video versions much more impressive, opining that they [...] "give a greater indication {{of the size of the}} spectacle" [...] and [...] "emphasize Shakira's intense charisma". Adam Markovitz from Entertainment Weekly gave the live album a mixed review; he praised the visual show Shakira put up, but was critical of her vocals, saying [...] "she writhes and dry-humps through her catalog like the world's highest-paid strip-aerobics instructor, showing off plenty of skin — but sadly, not much musicianship". He also felt that Shakira's performance was too sexual, commenting that she [...] "sometimes comes off more stripper than superstar".
