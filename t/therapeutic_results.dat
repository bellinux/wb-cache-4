Kalinowsky {{demonstrated}} Cerletti’s technique at the Burden Neurological Institute (BNI) and wrote an article about ECT which appeared in the Lancet in December 1939. He said that electrically induced seizures were cheaper and easier to administer than cardiazol seizures. The first paper on ECT by British authors appeared three weeks later in the same journal. Gerald Fleming, the medical superintendent of Barnwood House Hospital in Gloucester and editor of the Journal of Mental Science, psychiatrist Frederic Golla and neurophysiologist William Grey Walter (both from the BNI) described how they had tested the new method of convulsion therapy on five chronic schizophrenic patients from Barnwood House. Electrical parameters, technique of administration, seizures and electroencephalograms, but not <b>therapeutic</b> <b>results,</b> were discussed. An accompanying editorial entitled [...] "More shocks" [...] said that ECT [...] "may well turn out to be a valuable step forward" [...] but criticised Fleming’s claim that the use of ECT required only minimal training, expertise and patient preparation.

60|$|But {{whichever}} way Lydgate {{began to}} incline, {{there was something}} to make him wince; and being a proud man, he was a little exasperated at being obliged to wince. He did not like frustrating his own best purposes by getting on bad terms with Bulstrode; he did not like voting against Farebrother, and helping to deprive him of function and salary; and the question occurred whether the additional forty pounds might not leave the Vicar free from that ignoble care about winning at cards. Moreover, Lydgate did not like the consciousness that in voting for Tyke he should be voting on the side obviously convenient for himself. But would the end really be his own convenience? Other people would say so, and would allege that he was currying favor with Bulstrode for the sake of making himself important and getting on in the world. What then? He for his own part knew that if his personal prospects simply had been concerned, he would not have cared a rotten nut for the banker's friendship or enmity. What he really cared for was a medium for his work, a vehicle for his ideas; and after all, was he not bound to prefer the object of getting a good hospital, where he could demonstrate the specific distinctions of fever and test <b>therapeutic</b> <b>results,</b> before anything else connected with this chaplaincy? For the first time Lydgate was feeling the hampering threadlike pressure of small social conditions, and their frustrating complexity. At the end of his inward debate, when he set out for the hospital, his hope was really in the chance that discussion might somehow give a new aspect to the question, and make the scale dip so as to exclude the necessity for voting. I think he trusted a little also to the energy which is begotten by circumstances--some feeling rushing warmly and making resolve easy, while debate in cool blood had only made it more difficult. However it was, he did not distinctly say to himself on which side he would vote; and all the while he was inwardly resenting the subjection which had been forced upon him. It would have seemed beforehand like a ridiculous piece of bad logic that he, with his unmixed resolutions of independence and his select purposes, would find himself at the very outset in the grasp of petty alternatives, each of which was repugnant to him. In his student's chambers, he had prearranged his social action quite differently.|$|E

40|$|AIMS [...] To {{determine}} whether immunohistochemical {{evaluation of the}} abatement of proliferating cells after a first course of radiotherapy could predict the final response to treatment in oral squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). METHODS [...] Frozen sections from 31 cases of histologically confirmed oral SCC were stained with the monoclonal antibody Ki 67 at diagnosis and after 10 Gy of radiotherapy. The percentage difference of Ki 67 positive cells among the biopsy specimens taken {{at the beginning and}} after 10 Gy was correlated with the clinical response obtained {{at the end of the}} treatment and its significance determined. RESULTS [...] The percentage of Ki 67 positive cells at diagnosis had no significant correlation with the final <b>therapeutic</b> <b>result</b> of radiotherapy. By contrast, the 32 % difference of proliferating cells after 10 Gy of radiotherapy significantly differentiated responders from non-responders (p < 0. 05). Furthermore, the abatement of the growth fraction after 10 Gy of radiotherapy was significantly correlated with the complete response (p < 0. 01). CONCLUSIONS [...] These data show that the immunohistochemical evaluation of the abatement of Ki 67 positive cells after 10 Gy of radiotherapy provides an independent variable of responsiveness to radiotherapy, allowing a reliable prediction of the final <b>therapeutic</b> <b>result</b> to be made...|$|R

50|$|Physicians {{sometimes}} use finasteride for {{the treatment}} of BPH, informally known as an enlarged prostate. Finasteride may improve the symptoms associated with BPH such as difficulty urinating, getting up during the night to urinate, hesitation at the start of urination, and decreased urinary flow. It provides less symptomatic relief than alpha-1 blockers such as tamsulosin and symptomatic relief is slower in onset (six months or more of treatment with finasteride may be required to determine the <b>therapeutic</b> <b>results</b> of treatment). Symptomatic benefits are mainly seen in those with prostate volume > 40 cm3. In long-term studies finasteride but not alpha-1 inhibitors reduce the risk of acute urinary retention (−57% at 4 years) and the need for surgery (−54% at 4 years).

5000|$|There is a {{positive}} correlation for {{a higher level of}} AGR2 expression with poor <b>therapeutic</b> <b>results</b> in ERα-positive breast cancer patients. Agr2 mRNA expression is elevated in in vitro and in vivo studies responding to tamoxifen adjuvant therapy, so AGR2 is likely provides an agonistic effect on tamoxifen. [...] Therefore, AGR2 is a possible predictive biomarker when selecting patients with ER-positive breast cancer to participate this therapy. Although Agr2 mRNA levels are correlated with the tamoxifen therapy response, AGR2 protein levels have yet to be statistically associated with the therapy. A combinatorial therapy using the anastrozole and fulvestrant has been shown to prevent binding of the ER to the Agr2 promoter, and there has been improved prognosis in the patients receiving it, possibly because AGR2 expression in the tumors have been reduced.|$|E

Periodontitis manifests as progressive loss of the alveolar bone around the teeth, and if left untreated, can cause loosening and subsequent loss of teeth. Periodontitis is initiated by microorganisms that adhere to and grow on the tooth's surfaces, besides an over-aggressive immune response against these microorganisms. The primary goal of periodontal therapy is to preserve the natural dentition by accomplishing and preserving a healthy functional periodontium.

40|$|Osteoporosis is {{considered}} to be a major public health issue worldwide. Despite the large number of effective medication regimens available, patients’ non-compliance in treatment is one of the most common obstacles when attempting to achieve best <b>therapeutic</b> <b>results</b> against osteoporosis. The purpose of this review is to analyze the parameters concerning compliance of osteoporotic patients and to highlight health professionals’ role. Many studies are shown that the compliance in long-term anti-osteoporotic therapeutic schemes is low in developed countries, while it is estimated to be even less in developing countries. Compliance rates are usually lower when the disease is asymptomatic or when the therapy has side effects. There are many factors which lead to non – compliance to treatment regimens, and various techniques that a health professional could utilize in order to improve anti-osteoporotic <b>therapeutic</b> <b>results</b> are presented in this paper. Early identification of potential non-compliant patients is an important first step for health professionals, when aiming at resolving the issue of non-compliance and achieving better <b>therapeutic</b> <b>results.</b> A multi-factor model such as Fracture Liaison Service (FLS), which includes specialized nurses, could optimize the chances of better education, monitoring and achieving treatment compliance for the patient...|$|E
