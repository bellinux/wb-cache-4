40|$|Bacteriocins {{are natural}} {{antibacterial}} peptides ribosomally biosynthesized by bacteria. Gassericin T {{which is a}} bacteriocin produced by many strains of Lactobacillus gasseri has a broad antibacterial spectrum against food spoilage and pathogenic Gram-positive bacteria; therefore, the bacteriocin and its producers are predicted for use as safe food preservatives. However, probiotic Lb. gasseri strains show poor growth and minimally produce gassericin T in food-grade natural media such as reconstituted cheese whey, unlike in MRS broth. The growth of Lb. gasseri in reconstituted cheese whey was improved by adding proteose peptone as a nutrient factor. The production of gassericin T in MRS broth was specifically inhibited by adding divalent metal cations, and then the inhibition was removed using a chelator of divalent cations, trisodium <b>citrate</b> <b>dihydrate.</b> The production of gassericin T in reconstituted cheese whey was also restored by adding trisodium <b>citrate</b> <b>dihydrate,</b> and the activity was enhanced by a surfactant, Tween 80.

40|$|Abstract — In {{this study}} Aluminum Antimonide (AlSb) thin films were {{synthesized}} by electro-deposition technique using <b>tri-sodium</b> <b>citrate</b> as complexing agent. X-Ray studies {{were performed on}} both as-grown {{as well as on}} annealed films. The depositon potential was kept at- 0. 7 V and- 0. 8 V for a period of 15 minutes. The analysis of X-Ray diffraction spectra of the as-grown and annealed samples shows that the films are of AlSb material and are polycrystalline in the as-grown form. The hot probe analysis indicates that the grown film is of P-type in nature. In order to confirm the results we also used UV-VIS spectroscopy to determine the indirect and direct band gaps and the calculated values are in close agreement with the reported values in the literature.

40|$|The {{urgent need}} for {{nanoporous}} metal oxides with highly crystallized frameworks is motivating scientists to try to discover new preparation methods, because of their wide use in practical applications. Recent work has demonstrated that two-dimensional (2 D) cyanide-bridged coordination polymers (CPs) are promising materials and appropriate for this purpose (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. ­ 2013, 52, 1235). After calcination, 2 D CPs can be transformed into nanoporous metal oxides with a highly accessible surface area. Here, this strategy is adopted in order to form 2 D nanoporous nickel oxide (NiO) with tunable porosity and crystallinity, using trisodium <b>citrate</b> <b>dihydrate</b> as a controlling agent. The presence of trisodium <b>citrate</b> <b>dihydrate</b> {{plays a key role}} in the formation of 2 D nanoflakes by controlling the nucleation rate and the crystal growth. The size of the nanoflakes gradually increases by augmenting the amount of trisodium <b>citrate</b> <b>dihydrate</b> in the reaction. After heating the as-prepared CPs in air at different temperatures, nanoporous NiO can be obtained. During this thermal treatment, organic units (carbon and nitrogen) are completely removed and only the metal content remains to take part in the formation of nanoporous NiO. In the case of large-sized 2 D CP nanoflakes, the original 2 D flake-shapes are almost retained, even after thermal treatment at low temperature, but they are completely destroyed at high temperature because of further crystallization in the framework. Nanoporous NiO with high surface area shows significant efficiency and interesting results for supercapacitor application...|$|R
