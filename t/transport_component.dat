40|$|The {{kinetics}} of l-aspartate transport into pea chloroplasts was {{studied in}} the presence and absence of transport inhibitors to determine whether multiple aspartate carriers exist. Transport {{was measured by the}} silicone oil centrifugation technique. Reciprocal plots of concentration-dependent transport rates were biphasic, indicating the presence of two <b>transport</b> <b>components,</b> distinguishable {{on the basis of their}} affinity for aspartate. These <b>transport</b> <b>components,</b> called high affinity and low affinity transport could also be distinguished on the basis of their apparent substrate saturability and their sensitivity to media pH. The apparent Km for high affinity transport was 30 micromolar. The Km for low affinity transport was not determined. To test whether these <b>transport</b> <b>components</b> could also be distinguished on the basis of inhibitor sensitivity and to assess the value of inhibitors for distinguishing multiple aspartate translocators, a survey of several classes of potential inhibitors was conducted. High affinity aspartate transport was inhibited by p-chloromercuribenzenesulfonate and mersalyl, both sulfhydryl-reactive reagents; diethyl pyrocarbonate, a histidine-reactive reagent; and nigericin and carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone, both ionophores. Low affinity aspartate transport was not inhibited by p-chloromercuribenzenesulfonate or nigericin, but preliminary results suggest it was sensitive to diethyl pyrocarbonate. Because the high and low affinity <b>transport</b> <b>components</b> could be distinguished not only by their sensitivity to media pH and substrate saturability, but also by their sensitivity to various inhibitors, we concluded that they may represent different transport systems or carriers...|$|R

V(V) reduction is mediated by an electron transport chain which includes cytoplasmic membrane components (menaquinone and the tetraheme cytochrome CymA) and the outer membrane (OM) cytochrome OmcB. A partial role for the OM cytochrome OmcA was evident. Electron spin resonance spectroscopy demonstrated that V(V) was reduced to V(IV). V(V) reduction did not support anaerobic growth.

5000|$|This enzyme {{belongs to}} the family of oxidoreductases, {{specifically}} those acting on NADH or NADPH with other acceptors. The systematic name of this enzyme class is NADH:(quinone-acceptor) oxidoreductase. Other names in common use include reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (quinone) dehydrogenase, NADH-quinone oxidoreductase, NADH ubiquinone oxidoreductase, DPNH-menadione reductase, D-diaphorase, and NADH2 dehydrogenase (quinone), and mitochondrial (mt) complex I. This enzyme participates in oxidative phosphorylation. Several compounds are known to inhibit this enzyme, including AMP, and 2,4-dinitrophenol. NADH dehydrogenase is involved in the first step of the electron transport chain of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Any change in the electron <b>transport</b> <b>component</b> caused by a mutation might effect the normal electron flow.

50|$|In 1994, a {{comprehensive}} transport plan was prepared by MMRDA to arrest {{and improve the}} deteriorating transport condition in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region. The study recommended that the existing 2-lane wide JVLR be widened to a 6-lane carriageway, {{as well as other}} improvements. The widening and improvement of the JVLR was later taken up under the Mumbai Urban Transport Project (MUTP). The MUTP identified a number of subprojects to strengthen the suburban rail and road transport in Greater Mumbai and the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) as a whole. As a part of the MUTP Road <b>Transport</b> <b>Component</b> programme, the existing 2-lane JVLR from the Western Express Highway (WEH) to the Eastern Express Highway (EEH), would be widened to a 6-lane road with a central median. The JVLR, along with the Santa Cruz - Chembur Link Road (SCLR), was one of the two east-west road corridor projects implemented under {{the first phase of the}} MUTP, and were intended to ease commutation problems and act as links between Mumbai's Eastern and Western Suburbs.|$|E

50|$|The modern US Army {{long-range}} {{reconnaissance patrol}} concept {{was created in}} 1956 by the 11th Airborne Division in Augsburg, Germany. They patrolled near the Czechoslovakian and East German borders, then members of the Communist Warsaw Pact states, and in event of war in Europe would be inserted behind enemy lines to provide surveillance and to select targets of opportunity. The LRRP concept was well known throughout the Army though concentrated in 7th Army in Germany. Provisional LRRP Companies made up of both trained LRRPs and regular soldiers were put together {{for a series of}} exercises called Wintershield and proved themselves in the field. After the 11th Airborne Division returned to the US, the Department of the Army authorized two Airborne LRRP companies in 1961, Company D and C in the Wildflecken and Nellingen Barracks (near Stuttgart), and were respectively assigned to V Corps and VII Corps. In 1963, V Corps LRRPs (Company D) transferred to the Gibbs Kaserne in Frankfurt near Corps HQ. In 1965, these companies developed the first LRRP Table of Organization and Equipment and in doing so increased their strength to 208 men, team size from 4 to 5 men, as well as adding an organic <b>transport</b> <b>component.</b> All LRRPs from team leader and above were to be Ranger qualified. The experiences of these two companies formed the basis of the first US Army LRRP manual. Both companies used carrier wave (Morse Code) radios including the AN/TRC-77 for long-range communications to their respective Corps G2 (Intelligence) center. In 1968, both companies were transferred to the United States, but neither were sent to Vietnam because they retained their status as LRRP units for V and VII Corps in the event of war in Europe.|$|E
40|$|The CMS {{collaboration}} is currently investigating various networking technologies that may {{meet the requirements}} of the CMS Data Acquisition System (DAQ). During this study, a peer <b>transport</b> <b>component</b> based on TCP/IP has been developed using object-oriented techniques for the distributed DAQ framework named XDAQ. This framework has been designed to facilitate the development of distributed data acquisition systems within the CMS Experiment. The peer <b>transport</b> <b>component</b> has to meet 3 main requirements. Firstly, it had to provide fair access to the communication medium for competing applications. Secondly, it had to provide as much of the available bandwidth to the application layer as possible. Finally, it had to hide the complexity of using non-blocking TCP/IP connections from the application layer. This paper describes the development of the peer <b>transport</b> <b>component</b> and then presents and draws conclusions on the measurements made during tests. The major topics investigated include: blocking versus non-blocking communication, TCP/IP configuration options, multi-rail connections...|$|E
40|$|The main aim of {{the present}} study was to clarify whether {{different}} types of grasping may affect the <b>transport</b> <b>component</b> of prehension movements. To this purpose two experiments were carried out. In the first experiment the kinematics of arm movements (transport and manipulation components) were studied in eight normal subjects instructed to reach and grasp different objects located either 20 or 30 cm from their hand. The objects employed required two different types of grip: prehension with the whole hand and prehension with the index finger and the thumb (precision grip). In the second experiment subjects were instructed to point to the same objects employed in the first experiment. This experiment served as a control for the precision requirements related to the object size. The results showed that, once the precision requirements were taken into account, the <b>transport</b> <b>component</b> remained unmodified with the different types of grip. The time course of the manipulation component and its temporal relations with the <b>transport</b> <b>component</b> changed with the type of grasping. The maximal hand aperture was reached earlier in the precision grip than in the whole hand prehension and the temporal coupling with the <b>transport</b> <b>component</b> was weaker in the former condition than in the latter. The data are interpreted as further evidence in favour of independence between the transport and the manipulation "channels"...|$|E

40|$|Methomyl (Lannate) is a {{pesticide}} {{widely used}} to control of insects in grape gardens. Methomyl treatment induces significant alteration in mixed function oxidase system. The present work was designed to study the inhibitory effect of methomyl on different forms of cytochrome P 450 induced by phenobarbital (CYP 2 B 1, 2 B 2 and 3 A) and benzo[a]pyrene induced (CYP 1 A 1). Adult male rats were divided into 8 groups of 6 animals each. Microsomes were isolated by calcium precipitation. The levels of electron <b>transport</b> <b>components,</b> CYP 450, cytochrome b 5, and cytochrome c-reductase were determined using extinction coefficients. Activities of drug-metabolizing enzymes were assayed. Inducers like phenobarbital, benzo[a]pyrene, showed significant induction of mixed function oxidase in rat. The methomyl treatment (4 mg/kg) of inducer-(Phenobarbital, benzop [a] pyrene) pretreated rat caused {{a significant decrease in}} electron <b>transport</b> <b>components</b> and activities of drug-metabolizing enzymes when compared with treatment of inducer alone. Induction of mixed function oxidase enzymes due to phenobarbital was also altered by the pretreatment of methomyl. Benzo[a]pyrene treatment of methomyl pretreated rats showed significant decreased levels of electron <b>transport</b> <b>components</b> and drug metabolizing enzymes as compared to benzo[a]pyrene treatment alone. These results indicate that the susceptibility of phenobarbital and benzo[a]pyrene induced cytochrome P 450 isoform (CYP 2 B 1, 2 B 2, 3 A; and CYP 1 A 1) to methomyl and also affected in the induction pattern of some of the inducers with respect to CYP 450 isoforms...|$|R
40|$|Picking up a cup {{requires}} transporting the {{arm to the}} cup (<b>transport</b> <b>component)</b> and preshaping {{the hand}} appropriately to grasp the handle (grip component). Here, we used {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} to examine the human neural substrates of the <b>transport</b> <b>component</b> and its relationship with the grip component. Participants were shown three-dimensional objects placed either at a near location, adjacent to the hand, or at a far location, within reach but not adjacent to the hand. Participants performed three tasks at each location as follows: (1) touching the object with the knuckles of the right hand; (2) grasping the object with the right hand; or (3) passively viewing the object. The <b>transport</b> <b>component</b> was manipulated by positioning the object in the far versus the near location. The grip component was manipulated by asking participants to grasp the object versus touching it. For the first time, we have identified the neural substrates of the <b>transport</b> <b>component,</b> which include the superior parieto-occipital cortex and the rostral superior parietal lobule. Consistent with past studies, we found specialization for the grip component in bilateral anterior intraparietal sulcus and left ventral premotor cortex; now, however, we also find activity for the grasp even when no transport is involved. In addition to finding areas specialized for the transport and grip components in parietal cortex, we found an integration of the two components in dorsal premotor cortex and supplementary motor areas, two regions that may be important for the coordination of reach and grasp...|$|E

40|$|A {{theory of}} {{thermohydrodynamics}} in two-dimensional electron systems in quantizing magnetic fields is developed including a nonlinear transport regime. Spatio-temporal {{variations of the}} electron temperature and the chemical potential in the local equilibrium are described by the equations of conservation with the number and thermal-energy flux densities. A model of these flux densities due to hopping and drift processes is introduced for a random potential varying slowly compared to both the magnetic length and the phase coherence length.

40|$|We {{present a}} second-order {{accurate}} adaptive algorithm for solving reactive transport flow in geochemical systems. A Strang-splitting approach {{is used to}} numerically decouple the <b>transport</b> <b>component</b> and the reaction component of the problem. The <b>transport</b> <b>component</b> is solved using a second-order accurate IMPES-like algorithm that exhibits excellent control of numerical dispersion. The numerical scheme for the reaction component uses reaction network details from the chemistry module of TOUGHREACT, COREREACT, and VODE, a high-order ODE integrator, to maintain second-order accuracy of the algorithm. The algorithm is implemented within an adaptive refinement framework that uses a nested hierarchy of logically rectangular grids with simultaneous refinement of the grids in both space and time. The integration algorithm on the grid hierarchy is a recursive procedure in which coarse grids are advanced in time, fine grids are advanced multiple steps to reach {{the same time as}} the coarse grids, and the data at different levels are then synchronized. Numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the algorithm's accuracy and convergence properties. We conclude with a simulation of a reactive salt dome problem...|$|E

40|$|The {{repression}} and derepression of leucine, isoleucine, and valine transport in Escherichia coli K- 12 was examined by using strains auxotrophic for leucine, isoleucine, valine, and methionine. In experiments designed to limit {{each of these}} amino acids separately, we demonstrate that leucine limitation alone derepressed the leucine-binding protein, the high-affinity branched-chain amino acid transport system (LIV-I), and the membrane-bound, low-affinity system (LIV-II). This regulation {{did not seem to}} involve inactivation of <b>transport</b> <b>components,</b> but represented an increase in the differential rate of synthesis of <b>transport</b> <b>components</b> relative to total cellular proteins. The apparent regulation of transport by isoleucine, valine, and methionine reported elsewhere was shown to require an intact leucine, biosynthetic operon and to result from changes in the level of leucine biosynthetic enzymes.

Transport regulation was shown to be essentially independent of ilvA or its gene product, threonine deaminase.
