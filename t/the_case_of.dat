5|$|An {{important}} aspect of entertainment is the audience, which turns a private recreation or leisure activity into entertainment. The audience may have a passive role, as in <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> persons watching a play, opera, television show, or film; or the audience role may be active, as in <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> games, where the participant/audience roles may be routinely reversed. Entertainment can be public or private, involving formal, scripted performance, as in <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> theatre or concerts; or unscripted and spontaneous, as in <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> children's games. Most forms of entertainment have persisted over many centuries, evolving due to changes in culture, technology, and fashion for example with stage magic. Films and video games, for example, although they use newer media, continue to tell stories, present drama, and play music. Festivals devoted to music, film, or dance allow audiences to be entertained {{over a number of}} consecutive days.|$|E

In few <b>cases,</b> changes in <b>the</b> gut flora ecosystem allow pathogens to proliferate. Clostridium difficile is responsible for approximately 10 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cases</b> <b>of</b> antibiotic-associated diarrhea in the community, most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cases</b> <b>of</b> antibiotic-associated colitis, and almost all <b>the</b> <b>cases</b> <b>of</b> pseudomembranous colitis. According to anatomoclinical increasing severity of the disease, C. difficile infections should be treated with metronidazole, vancomycin, intravenous immunoglobulins or colectomy. Klebsiella oxytoca is naturally resistant to bela-lactamins and causes occasionally heamorrhagic colitis, mimicking in some cases ischemic colitis...|$|R
40|$|Aim: {{to define}} {{clinical}} and etiological, radiation and neurophysiological parameters determining {{the transformation of}} disseminated leukoencephalitis to multiple sclerosis in children. Materials and methods: clinical and etiological analysis of leukoencephalitis in 229 children aged 1 - 17 years old and their catamnesis for 5, 5 ± 1, 8 years were performed. Morphostructural characteristic was made by brain and spinal cord MRI and multimodal provoked potentials. Results: The development of multiple sclerosis in children was observed {{in the outcome of}} leukoencephalitis chronic course in 44, 4 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cases</b> and in 73, 3 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cases</b> <b>of</b> mixed herpes viral infection (Epstein-Barr virus and 6 type herpes virus). Morphostructural features in <b>the</b> <b>cases</b> <b>of</b> leukoencephalitis in children depending on the disease course characterized by the prevalence of edematous and inflammatory character of CNS changes in <b>the</b> <b>cases</b> <b>of</b> an acute course, by demyelinating changes in <b>the</b> <b>cases</b> <b>of</b> a prolonged course, and by degenerative and demyelinating ones in <b>the</b> <b>cases</b> <b>of</b> a chronic course were determined. Administration of etiopathogenetic therapy for leukoencephalitis allows to achieve either a complete recovery or with the deficiency up to 2, 5 points by EDSS in 96, 6 % in <b>the</b> <b>cases</b> <b>of</b> acute and prolonged course, and clinical and radiation remission in 50, 1 % and recovery in 5, 5 % in <b>the</b> <b>cases</b> <b>of</b> chronic course...|$|R
