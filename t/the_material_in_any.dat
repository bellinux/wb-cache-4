Traditionally the size is stated by the mass of the system, but sometimes it is stated by the entropy, or by the volume. For a given such system , scaled by the real number [...] to yield a new one , a state function, , such that , is said to be extensive. Such a function as [...] is called a homogeneous function of degree 1. There are two different concepts mentioned here, sharing the same name: (a) the mathematical concept of degree-1 homogeneity in the scaling function; and (b) the physical concept of the spatial homogeneity of the system. It happens that the two agree here, but that is not because they are tautologous. It is a contingent fact of thermodynamics.|$|E

5000|$|One {{important}} candoluminescence {{mechanism is}} that <b>the</b> candoluminescent <b>material</b> catalyzes <b>the</b> recombination, enhancing {{the intensity of}} the emission.

40|$|The use of {{functional}} materials, such as ferroelectrics, as platforms for tissue growth in situ or ex situ, {{is new and}} holds great promise. But <b>the</b> usage of <b>materials</b> <b>in</b> <b>any</b> bioapplication requires information on biocompatibility and desirably on bioactive behavior when bone tissue engineering is envisaged.

The formation of apatite-like structures {{on the surface of}} LiNbO 3 and LiTaO 3 powders after immersion in simulated body fluid (SBF) for different soaking periods indicates their bioactive potential. The mechanism of apatite formation is suggested.

In this chapter I investigate how the staff members of a mental health Therapeutic Community in Italy avoid displays of affiliation in response to residents’ indirect (or third party) complaints. I show how this restriction can be embodied in different practices: ignoring a resident’s turn carrying a possible complaint, avoiding attending the complaint-components of a resident’s turn, and disaffiliating with a resident’s complaint. I also discuss a deviant case in which affiliation is produced and is later treated by the staff members as a problematic stance to be produced following a resident’s complaint. I argue that through a restriction on affiliation the staff members implement the institutionally-relevant identity of intermediaries, whose task is to encourage the residents’ compliance to the decisions of absent third parties...|$|E

In this study I analyse Therapeutic Community (TC) group meetings for persons with drug addiction problems. Using the method of Conversation Analysis, I specifically focus on practices of knowledge management and sharing between the educators and clients of a TC in Italy. As part of their institutional remit, the educators encourage the clients to report information on their activities and to disclose aspects of their inner experience. This can lead to epistemic struggles, in which the clients resist providing information and the educators seek to overcome such resistance by making claims of pre-existing knowledge about the clients’ experience. After describing the design and sequential positioning of such claims, I argue that their use is functional to manage one of the dilemmas that characterise the educators’ professional practice...|$|E

2500|$|While <b>the</b> bulk of <b>material</b> <b>in</b> <b>any</b> star is {{hydrogen}} and helium, {{there is a}} significant variation in the amount of heavier elements (metals). A high proportion of metals in a star correlates to the amount of heavy <b>material</b> initially available <b>in</b> <b>the</b> protoplanetary disk. A smaller amount of metal makes the formation of planets much less likely, under the solar nebula theory of planetary system formation. Any planets that did form around a metal-poor star would probably be low in mass, and thus unfavorable for life. Spectroscopic studies of systems where exoplanets have been found to date confirm the relationship between high metal content and planet formation: [...] "Stars with planets, or at least with planets similar to the ones we are finding today, are clearly more metal rich than stars without planetary companions." [...] This relationship between high metallicity and planet formation also means that habitable systems {{are more likely to be}} found around stars of younger generations, since stars that formed early in the universe's history have low metal content.|$|R
40|$|Abstract = Purpose: This study {{analyzed}} {{the effectiveness of}} poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) as a tissue recovery agent and determines the in vivo safety and efficacy of microparticle-based PLGA. Materials and Methods: Fifteen 3 -month-old male white rabbits were used. Allogenic adipose tissue derived stromal vascular fraction (SVF) was cultured and labeled with the fluorescent dye PKH 26. The rabbits were divided into 4 groups: the SVF group, the PLGA group, the normal control group, and the disease control group. The right corpus cavernosal tissue of the rabbits was surgically removed in the selected portion, except in the normal control group. The defect space of each rabbit was replaced with 106 SVF cells in the SVF group and 0. 1 g of biodegradable polymer solution in the PLGA group. Microscopic confirmation and analysis of tissue regeneration were performed after 8 weeks. Using confocal microscopy, the nuclei of the smooth muscle cells and SVF migration were examined. The composition of smooth muscle and fibrosis of the injured corpus cavernosum were compared and analyzed by Masson’s trichrome stain. Results: There were no signs of migration or rejection of <b>the</b> injected <b>materials</b> <b>in</b> <b>any</b> of <b>the</b> experimental groups.
