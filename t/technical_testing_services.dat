A sample of 18 basic commodes, divided into four categories, was evaluated by 40 users, a questionnaire being administered to determine user views.

The results showed that the preferred commodes as indicated by the users did not necessarily perform well in the <b>technical</b> <b>tests,</b> with {{at least one of the}} products having potentially serious design faults.

40|$|Purpose. Kicking, {{jumping and}} agility are {{important}} skills in football. These activities require adequate lower limb strength, {{which can be}} enhanced with resistance training. The objective {{of the study was}} to evaluate the effect of resistance tube exercises on kicking accuracy, vertical jump performance and 40 -yard <b>technical</b> <b>test</b> results in competitive football players. Methods. The study involved 23 competitive football players (11 males, 12 females) aged from 18 - 20 years recruited from three different universities in Belgaum, Karnataka, India. Back heel kick accuracy, vertical jump height and 40 -yard <b>technical</b> <b>test</b> time were evaluated before and after a 2 -week resistance tube exercise program. Results. Significant improvements in post-intervention kicking accuracy were found when males and females were treated as a single group (p = 0. 01). Vertical jump height also showed a highly significant post-intervention improvement in the males and for the combined group of males and females (p = 0. 001). The 40 -yard <b>technical</b> <b>test</b> values significantly improved in the females and in the combined results for males and females (p = 0. 001). Conclusions. The two-week resistance tube exercise program was found to have an effect on kicking accuracy, vertical jump height and 40 -yard <b>technical</b> <b>test</b> performance in competitive football players. Resistance tube exercises can thus be included as a component of a regular strength training program for such athletes...|$|R
