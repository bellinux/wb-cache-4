Lawrie formed the band as an evening class for amateur wind players and it was then known as the Brighton Hill Centre Band. In <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>immediately</b> after World War II the Basingstoke Symphony Orchestra was being conducted by D. Cecil Williams.|$|E
5|$|Beginning January 17, 1848, {{the eight}} {{founders of the}} Misericorde Sisters, {{including}} Cadron-Jetté, commenced practical training in midwifery under Dr Eugène-Hercule Trudele, a young obstetrician. The objective of the training was to better prepare the sisters to meet the obligations of their fourth vow. The training lasted for 18 months and concluded with an examination before {{two members of the}} College of Physicians and Surgeons of Lower Canada, with the result that on July 12, 1849, the women received formal certificates of midwifery. It is most likely during this period or <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>immediately</b> following that Cadron-Jetté learned to read and write.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} migration, residential location, and commute distance within Toronto‟s commuter shed. The study utilizes data from the master file of the 2006 Canadian Census. This master file contains the previous residential locations of recent migrants, thus allowing migrants to be disaggregated by duration of residence. Multivariate regressions indicate that living in the most accessible rural areas and being a recent migrant are significantly associated with longer commutes. Furthermore, the Canadian Census distinguishes between those who migrated in <b>the</b> <b>year</b> <b>immediately</b> prior to <b>the</b> Census, and those who migrated one to five-years prior to the Census date. Findings demonstrate that the commute distance of very recent migrants (those who migrated in <b>the</b> <b>year</b> <b>immediately</b> prior to <b>the</b> census) have the longest commute distances. As residential duration increases, commute distanc...|$|R
5|$|Buddhist {{scholars}} living {{during the}} time of the Liao dynasty predicted that the mofa (末法), an age in which the three treasures of Buddhism would be destroyed, was to begin in the year 1052. Previous dynasties, including the Sui and Tang, were also concerned with the mofa, although their predictions for when the mofa would start were different from the one selected by the Liao. As early as the Sui dynasty, efforts were made to preserve Buddhist teachings by carving them into stone or burying them. These efforts continued into the Liao dynasty, with Emperor Xingzong funding several projects in <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>immediately</b> preceding 1052.|$|E
5|$|Cædwalla's {{departure}} in 688 {{appears to}} have led to instability {{in the south of}} England. Ine, Cædwalla's successor, abdicated in 726, and the West Saxon Genealogical Regnal List says that he reigned for thirty-seven years, implying his reign began in 689 instead of 688. This could indicate an unsettled period between Cædwalla's abdication and Ine's accession. The kingship also changed in Kent in 688, with Oswine, who was apparently a Mercian client, taking the throne; and there is evidence of East Saxon influence in Kent in <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>immediately</b> following Cædwalla's abdication.|$|E
5|$|Fire-control {{technology}} advanced quickly during <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>immediately</b> preceding World War I, and {{the development}} of the director firing system was a major advance. This consisted of a fire-control director mounted high in the ship which electrically provided elevation and training angles to the turrets via pointers, which the turret crewmen only had to follow. The guns were fired simultaneously, which aided in spotting the shell splashes and minimized the effects of the roll on the dispersion of the shells. Queen Mary received her director before the Battle of Jutland.|$|E

5|$|For {{many years}} Odontogriphus ("toothed riddle") was known from only one specimen, an almost featureless oval smear on a slab, with hints of tiny conical teeth.

It {{had a pair of}} slightly V-shaped tooth-rows just ahead of the mouth, very like Wiwaxia′s.

5|$|In <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>immediately</b> after World War I, Britain, Japan and the US {{all began}} design {{work on a}} new {{generation}} of ever more powerful battleships and battlecruisers. The new burst of shipbuilding that each nation's navy desired was politically controversial and potentially economically crippling. This nascent arms race was prevented by the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922, where the major naval powers agreed to limits on capital ship numbers. The German navy was not represented at the talks; {{under the terms of the}} Treaty of Versailles, Germany was not allowed any modern capital ships at all.|$|E

5|$|In <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>immediately</b> {{following}} {{the end of}} the Great War, the United States, Britain, and Japan all launched huge naval construction programs. All three countries decided that a new naval arms race would be ill-advised, and so convened the Washington Naval Conference to discuss arms limitations, which produced the Washington Naval Treaty, signed in February 1922. Under the terms of Article II of the treaty, South Carolina and her sister Michigan were to be scrapped. The ship was decommissioned on 15 December, but was not formally stricken from the Naval Vessel Register until 10 November 1923. She was sold for scrap on 24 April 1924 and subsequently dismantled.|$|E

He raised a large peasant army and battled both the French and the communist Viet Minh independence movement, before being killed by the latter.
