The settlers encompassed a range of socioeconomic strata, ranging from peasants to large landowners, the latter of whom were referred to as grands colons.|$|R
50|$|There is no similar {{institution}} to the mortgage {{in the civil}} law, however a hypothec is a device to secure real rights against property. These real rights follow the property along with the ownership. In the common law a lien also remains on the property {{and it is not}} extinguished <b>by</b> <b>alienation</b> of the property; liens may be real or equitable.|$|R
40|$|Research {{indicates}} {{that there is a}} relation between social rejection and aggressive behavior during childhood. A distinction between direct and displaced aggression is never investigated so far. The current study aimed to investigate whether there is a relation between social rejection and direct or displaced aggression, and if so, whether these relations are moderated <b>by</b> <b>alienation</b> or callousness. Also the moderating effect of gender on this relation was investigated. Participants were children between 10 and 15 years old in the Netherlands. They filled out questionnaires and participated in a computer game in which they received fictive peer feedback. The children could display direct aggression (against a provocator who expressed negative feedback, N = 375) or displaced aggression (against an innocent peer, N = 380). Results indicated that there is a relation between social rejection and direct as well as displaced aggression. For direct aggression, this relation is moderated <b>by</b> <b>alienation.</b> For displaced aggression no moderating effects were found. Future research should address which protective factors influence the relation between social rejection and aggression...|$|R
5000|$|Rousseau saw the {{evolution}} of modern society as the replacement of natural egalitarianism <b>by</b> <b>alienation</b> and class distinction enforced by institutions of power. Thus The Social Contract opens with the famous phrase [...] "Man is born free, and everywhere he is in chains." [...] Even the ruling classes are not free, in fact for Rousseau they are [...] "greater slaves" [...] because they require more esteem from others to rule and must therefore constantly live [...] "outside themselves".|$|R
50|$|While {{confined}} in the psychiatric hospital in Mandeville, Long kept his political machine running via telephone. His staff discovered that nothing in Louisiana law {{required him to}} relinquish power because he was confined to the hospital. Long ordered Jesse Bankston, {{the head of the}} state hospital system, fired and replaced him with a supporter, who had Long released. Bill Dodd, who had periods of positive association with Long followed <b>by</b> <b>alienation,</b> defended Long over the hospital confinement. So too did long-time State Senator Sixty Rayburn of Bogalusa, a personal and philosophical ally of Long's.|$|R

25|$|The Spanish Inquisition (Inquisición Española) {{can be seen}} as {{an answer}} to the multi-religious nature of Spanish society {{following}} the reconquest of the Iberian Peninsula from the Muslim Moors. After invading in 711, large areas of the Iberian Peninsula were ruled by Muslims until 1250, when they were restricted to Granada, which fell in 1492. However, the Reconquista did not result in the total expulsion of Muslims from Spain, since they, along with Jews, were tolerated by the ruling Christian elite. Large cities, especially Seville, Valladolid and Barcelona, had significant Jewish populations centered in Juderia, but in the coming years the Muslims were increasingly subjugated <b>by</b> <b>alienation</b> and torture.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the political involvement and relationships that influenced {{the progress of}} a tourist heritage site in Korea. It explores the dynamics of collaboration and shows how initial advantages can become conflict and inertia over time. It outlines the continuing discord among interested groups, investigates the relationships that surround the developmental process, and demonstrates how perceptual differences became embedded. The paper illustrates that a structure dominated by power relations leads to conflict and inertia caused <b>by</b> <b>alienation,</b> and emphasizes the need for collaborative structures in cultural heritage tourism development.

40|$|This essay {{grew out}} of an {{empirical}} study of a village in Southern England which, from its inception, was a fraught and emotionally entangled undertaking. I was born in this place and have retained a strong connection to it through my family. I soon found, however, that my attempts to think analytically were blocked by my own contradictory feelings: an umbilical pull to house and land tempered <b>by</b> <b>alienation</b> from what was becoming, in my lifetime, an increasingly homogenous and suburbanized enclave. Childhood memories of people, events and spaces provided a reservoir from which I could draw selectively, but having shaken the dust off my shoes so long ago I had lost any {{sense of belonging to}} a community. ...|$|R
50|$|In {{his book}} Traité médico-philosophique sur l'aliénation mentale; ou la manie, {{published}} in 1801, Pinel discusses his psychologically oriented approach. This book {{was translated into}} English by D. D. Davis as a Treatise on Insanity in 1806, although Davis substituted Pinel's introduction for his own, leaving out among other things Pinel's strong praise for Alexander Crichton. Pinel's book had an enormous influence on both French and Anglo-American psychiatrists during the nineteenth century. He meant <b>by</b> <b>alienation</b> that the patient feels like a stranger (alienus) {{to the world of}} the 'sane'. A sympathetic therapist living in that world might be able to journey into the patient's experience, understand the 'alienated', their language, and possibly lead them back into society.|$|R

40|$|In this research, nonengagement is {{conceived}} {{as a manifestation of}} spiritual emptiness characterized <b>by</b> <b>alienation</b> and despair. Three scales with satisfactory reliabilities, alienation, despair and hope, were developed and used as predictors of health, coping, and social and family nonengagement among 428 nonengaged youths (309 males and 119 females) aged 15 – 24 years in Hong Kong. The results show that alienation and despair are associated with (a) poorer health, (b) more frequent use of negative coping, especially by hiding oneself and, to a lesser extent, (c) nonengagement. Hope is associated with better health and more frequent use of positive coping. These results support the contention that nonengagement is a loss of hope, meaning and purpose in life.

40|$|Soils {{vulnerability}} of the Catchment Almas geomorphologic processes. Almas Basin, signed lower lithologic Miocene soils deposits, shows six classes: Cernisols, Cambisols, Luvisols, Hydrosols, Pelisols, Protosols (after SRTS, 2003). The largest share is attributed to Luvisols class (60 %), followed by undeveloped soil represented by Protosols and Antrisols (15 %), followed by the remaining classes with lower weights: Cambisols (13 %), Cernisols (7 %), Pelisols (4 %), Hydrosols (1 %). Contemporary geomorphological processes (surface and deep erosion, mass movements) change agricultural areas and forest ratio or flow out of economic network tens of hectares annually. Soil vulnerability to the manifestation of these processes is expressed by disturbing soil horizons, coastal springs appearance and growth of the adjoining excess moisture, soil sealing productive by dropping or <b>by</b> <b>alienation...</b>|$|R
