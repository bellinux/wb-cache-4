5|$|After its {{unexpected}} redevelopment over Oklahoma, widespread {{damage was}} also reported there. Several communities in central Oklahoma were flooded due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>heavy</b> rainfall. Watonga, Kingfisher and Geary were the hardest-hit communities, where many houses and buildings were inundated. The weather forced {{the cancellation of}} the Hydro Fair as the carnival rides were not safe in heavy rain and high wind. Winds in Watonga gusted as high as 82mph (131km/h), which damaged numerous trees and power lines and heavily damaged mobile homes. The entire community lost power, as did about 15,000 customers in total in the Oklahoma City metropolitan area. A section of Interstate 40 was also closed for a while.|$|E
5|$|Born in Mühlheim am Main in the German Empire, Weissenberger, who {{had been}} a glider pilot in his youth, volunteered for service in the Luftwaffe of the Third Reich in 1936.

5|$|Christ Illusion was {{released}} on August 8, 2006, and debuted at number 5 on the Billboard 200, selling over 62,000 copies in its first week.

Hall of Fame for their influence <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>heavy</b> metal scene.|$|E
5|$|Flooding was {{reported}} throughout the Outer Banks in relation <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>heavy</b> rains and storm surge of the storm. The storm required the shutdown of North Carolina Highway 12, the only highway connecting {{the area to}} the mainland, isolating those who decided to stay behind. Many residents lost power as numerous power lines fell from strong winds. Six brief tornadoes, ranging between F0 and F1 on the Fujita scale, struck the state within squall lines in the outer rainbands of Hurricane Bob. Four tornadoes in Dare County, North Carolina, caused $256,000 in damage. Near Cape Hatteras, wind severely damaged one structure, which lost its roof and some siding.|$|E
5|$|Following the storm, {{officials}} in Honduras requested international assistance, which totaled $2.8billion over a several year period. Despite this, {{the gross domestic}} product began decreasing at the end of 1998, and contracted by 1.9% in 1999. Officials enacted a widespread curfew following the storm, and for 15days temporarily restricted constitutional rights to maintain order. There were outbreaks in various diseases, and many residents faced food and water shortages. Due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>heavy</b> damage, the name Mitch was retired from the Atlantic hurricane naming list.|$|E

5|$|Haakon {{enters his}} ship, the fleet rows {{forward for the}} attack, and battle ensues.

The Jomvikings fleet fights facing the storm and cold, and they have trouble standing due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>heavy</b> wind. The Jomsvikings throw weapons, missiles, and stones at Haakon's fleet but the winds turn their projectiles back at them.|$|E
5|$|Harvey caused minor {{flooding}} in south Florida because {{of light to}} relatively heavy rainfall in {{that portion of the}} state and at least 34houses and businesses in southern Florida were flooded. There were sporadic reports of tropical storm-force winds throughout the state, as well as two tornadoes. Damage estimates in Florida reached about $15million (1999USD). Throughout the rest of the United States, impact was limited, confined to light rainfall in Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina. Heavy rainfall was reported in Atlantic Canada and Harvey became the wettest tropical cyclone on record in that country. Significant flooding, especially to roads and houses, was reported due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>heavy</b> rainfall and damage throughout Atlantic Canada totalled several million dollars.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fifteenth}} century under the Stewart Dynasty, despite a {{turbulent}} political history, the crown gained greater political control {{at the expense of}} independent lords and regained most of its lost territory to approximately the modern borders of the country. However, the Auld Alliance with France led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>heavy</b> defeat of a Scottish army at the Battle of Flodden in 1513 and the death of the king James IV, which would be followed by a long minority and a period of political instability.|$|E

5|$|In {{the mid-19th}} century brass bands had a poor {{relationship}} with the Nonconformist chapels, mainly due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>heavy</b> social drinking that came {{hand in hand with}} being a member of a band. This changed {{towards the end of the}} 19th century, and as well as becoming more respectable, many bands had actually joined the temperance movement. Two of the more well known brass bands from the Rhondda both started as temperance bands. The more famous, Cory Band from Ton Pentre, started life as Ton Temperance in 1884; while local rivals The Parc and Dare Band were the Cwmparc Drum and Fife Temperance Band.|$|E
5|$|It rained for {{the next}} day and a half, {{preventing}} battle. During this time, Baum's men constructed a small redoubt at {{the crest of the hill}} and hoped that the weather would prevent the Americans from attacking before reinforcements arrived. Stark sent out skirmishers to probe the German lines, and managed to kill thirty Indians in spite of the difficulties of keeping their gunpowder dry. Reinforcements for both sides marched out on the 15th; travel was quite difficult due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>heavy</b> rains. Burgoyne sent 550 men under Heinrich von Breymann, while Warner's company of about 350 Green Mountain Boys came south from Manchester under Lieutenant Samuel Safford's command.|$|E
5|$|Offshore, {{eight people}} were injured on the U.S. Naval ship Kirk when a large wave crashed over the bow. Another boat, USB Oldendorf, {{sustained}} significant damage due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>heavy</b> seas, and 22of its occupants required rescue. Many of the rescued received minor injuries. A total of 13people were rescued from the imperiled ship Offshore Patrick. Following the passage of Typhoon Hal in the Philippines, 4,000bags of food, 200bags of clothes, and 400bags of medicine were provided via airlift. A few days after Hal, the nation was later affected by Typhoon Irma.|$|E
