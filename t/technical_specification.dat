[...] An elevated control house was built for the sole use of operational staff, but in recent years a freestanding low level standard control console has been built for the use of boaters when the bridge is not staffed. [...] Sykehouse Lift Bridge (downstream of Barnby Dun) was built to the same <b>technical</b> <b>specification.</b> [...] Although the bridge carries an unclassified road linking Barnby Dun and Bentley, the bridge also provided the only access for heavy loads to the nearby Thorpe Marsh power station, so the bridge was designed to carry abnormal loads of up to 180 tons gross weight. [...] Although Thorpe Marsh Power Station has now been demolished, the bridge is still busy with road traffic.

2500|$|Further {{specifications}} of {{the national}} flag were detailed in the Presidential Decree [...] "On the National Flag of the Republic of Azerbaijan" [...] issued on February 5, 1991. The ratio was kept at 1:2, which {{was used in the}} Soviet era. Each stripe is one-third of the total height of the flag and extends the full length. The star and crescent were placed in a box that has a ratio of 3:4; the crescent is shifted one-sixtieth from the center. The outside diameter of both the crescent and the red inside circle intersects with the diameter of the star. The diameter of the star is one-sixth the height of the flag; the inscribed circle in this star is one-twelfth the height of the flag. The flag is also described in the <b>technical</b> <b>specification</b> [...] "AZS 001-2006. Azərbaycan Respublikasının Dövlət Bayrağı. Texniki şərtlər." [...] published by the State Committee on Standardization, Metrology and Patents of the Republic of Azerbaijan in 2006.|$|E
2500|$|An updated {{variant of}} the {{broadcast}} flag has been developed in the Content Protection and Copy Management group under DVB (DVB-CPCM). Upon publication by DVB, the <b>technical</b> <b>specification</b> was submitted to European governments in March 2007. As with much DRM, the CPCM system is intended to control use of copyrighted material by the end-user, {{at the direction of}} the copyright holder. According to Ren Bucholz of the EFF, which paid {{to be a member of}} the consortium, [...] "You won't even know ahead of time whether and how you will be able to record and make use of particular programs or devices". The DVB claims that the system will harmonize copyright holders' control across different technologies, thereby making things easier for end users. The normative sections have now all been approved for publication by the DVB Steering Board, and will be published by ETSI as a formal European Standard as ETSI TS 102 825-X where X refers to the Part number of specification. Nobody has yet stepped forward to provide a Compliance and Robustness regime for the standard (though several are rumoured to be in development), so it is not presently possible to fully implement a system, as there is nowhere to obtain the necessary device certificates.|$|E
2500|$|The {{cause of}} the {{difference}} in production volume is the complexity of the molecular structure of the chemical. Bulk chemicals are usually much less complex. While fine chemicals may be more complex, many of them are simple enough to be sold as [...] "building blocks" [...] in the synthesis of more complex molecules targeted for single use, as named above. The production of a chemical includes not only its synthesis but also its purification to eliminate by-products and impurities involved in the synthesis. The last step in production should be the analysis of batch lots of chemicals in order to identify and quantify the percentages of impurities for the buyer of the chemicals. The required purity and analysis depends on the application, but higher tolerance of impurities is usually expected in the production of bulk chemicals. Thus, the user of the chemical in the US might choose between the bulk or [...] "technical grade" [...] with higher amounts of impurities or a much purer [...] "pharmaceutical grade" [...] (labeled [...] "USP", United States Pharmacopeia). [...] "Chemicals" [...] in the commercial and legal sense may also include mixtures of highly variable composition, as they are products made to a <b>technical</b> <b>specification</b> instead of particular chemical substances. For example, gasoline is not a single chemical compound or even a particular mixture: different gasolines can have very different chemical compositionsl, as [...] "gasoline" [...] is primarily defined through source, properties and octane rating.|$|E
