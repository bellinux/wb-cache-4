5|$|The early 20th {{century was}} the era of <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Migration</b> of blacks from the Southern United States to the Northeast, Midwest and West.

5|$|African Americans are {{the largest}} racial {{minority}} in Texas. Their proportion of population has declined since the early 20th century, after many left the state in <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Migration.</b> Blacks of both Hispanic and non-Hispanic origin make up 11.5 percent of the population; blacks of non-Hispanic origin form 11.3 percent of the populace. African Americans of both Hispanic and non-Hispanic origin number at roughly 2.7 million individuals.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of heavy industry attracted thousands of European {{immigrants in the}} late 19th and early 20th centuries, as well as internal migrants, both black and white, from the rural and small town South. These developments dramatically altered {{the demographics of the}} state. Indiana industrial cities were among the destinations of <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Migration.</b> After World War II, industrial restructuring and the shifts in heavy industry resulted in Indiana's becoming part of the Rust Belt.|$|E

5|$|Between 1815 and 1850, some 800,000 {{immigrants}} came to {{the colonies}} of British North America, mainly from the British Isles as part of <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Migration</b> of Canada. These new arrivals included some Gaelic-speaking Highland Scots displaced by the Highland Clearances to Nova Scotia. The Irish Potato Famine of the 1840s significantly increased the pace of Irish immigration to Prince Edward Island and the Province of Canada, with over 35,000 distressed individuals landing in Toronto in 1847 and 1848. Descendants of Francophone and Anglophone northern Europeans who arrived in the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries are {{often referred to as}} old stock Canadians.|$|E
5|$|By 1910, {{thousands}} of African Americans were {{moving from the}} South to Chicago, as a major destination in <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Migration</b> to northern and midwestern cities, fleeing lynchings, segregation and disenfranchisement in the Deep South. The revived Ku Klux Klan committed 64 lynchings in 1918 and 83 in 1919 in southern states. With industrial jobs in the stockyards and meatpacking industry opening as European immigration was cut off by World War I, from 1916 to 1919 the African-American population in Chicago increased from 44,000 to 109,000, a 148 percent increase during the decade.|$|E
5|$|Postwar {{social unrest}} was {{also related to}} the {{difficulties}} of absorbing the veterans {{from the war in}} the job market. Competition among groups for work heightened tensions. In the 1920s there was growing anti-Semitism in the United States related to economic competition and the fears of social change from decades of changed immigration, a lingering anti-German sentiment left over from World War I, and anti-black violence erupted in numerous locations as well. In this period African Americans were leaving the South by the tens of thousands, to escape oppressive social conditions and find work in the North and Midwestern industrial cities, in what came to be called <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Migration.</b>|$|E

5|$|Sylvester James {{was born}} on September 6, 1947 in the Watts {{district}} of Los Angeles, California, into a middle-class family. His mother, Letha Weaver, had been raised near Palestine, Arkansas into a relatively wealthy African-American family who owned their own farmland. Letha's biological mother, Gertha Weaver, was unmarried and too sickly {{to care for her}} child, so Gertha's sister Julia, known to the family as JuJu, became Letha's adoptive mother. In the late 1930s, Julia and her husband took part in <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Migration</b> of African-Americans out of the Southern United States, relocating to Watts.|$|E
5|$|The Great Depression and the Dust Bowl dealt {{a double}} {{blow to the}} state's economy, which had {{significantly}} improved since the Civil War. Migrants abandoned the worst hit sections of Texas during the Dust Bowl years. Especially from this period on, blacks left Texas in <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Migration</b> to get work in the Northern United States or California and to escape the oppression of segregation. In 1940, Texas was 74 percent Anglo, 14.4 percent black, and 11.5 percent Hispanic.|$|E

5|$|The {{construction}} of the New York City Subway, which opened in 1904, helped bind the new city together, as did additional bridges to Brooklyn. In the 1920s Manhattan experienced large arrivals of African-Americans as part of <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Migration</b> from the southern United States, and the Harlem Renaissance, {{part of a larger}} boom time in the Prohibition era that included new skyscrapers competing for the skyline. New York City became the most populous city in the world in 1925, overtaking London, which had reigned for a century. Manhattan's majority white ethnic group declined from 98.7% in 1900 to 58.3% by 1990.|$|E
5|$|Despite segregationist {{and racist}} attitudes, St. Louis {{acted as a}} haven during the 1917 East St. Louis Riot, as St. Louis police shepherded fleeing blacks across the Eads Bridge to shelter and food {{provided}} by the city government and the American Red Cross. Leonidas C. Dyer, who represented part of St. Louis in the U.S. House, led a Congressional investigation into the events and eventually sponsored an anti-lynching bill in response. Due to an influx of refugees from East St. Louis and the general effects of <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Migration</b> of blacks from the rural South to industrial cities, the black population of St. Louis increased more rapidly than the whole during the decade of 1910 to 1920.|$|E
5|$|In 1920, the women's rights {{movement}} won {{passage of a}} constitutional amendment granting women's suffrage.

Roosevelt responded with the New Deal, which included the establishment of the Social Security system. <b>The</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Migration</b> of millions of African Americans out of the American South began before World War I and extended through the 1960s; whereas the Dust Bowl of the mid-1930s impoverished many farming communities and spurred a new wave of western migration.|$|E

5|$|In this period, while <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Migration</b> of African Americans {{out of the}} South to the North was beginning, {{blacks in}} the two regions dealt with {{different}} conditions. The {{vast majority of the}} millions of African Americans still lived in the South, many in rural areas where they were the majority population. But they were effectively disfranchised by new electoral rules and state constitutions, utterly closed out of the political process. This situation would continue, despite some temporarily effective court challenges, through the 1960s. Washington believed he had to help this population within the constraints of their environment. At the same time, he secretly funded legal challenges against the voter registration and electoral restrictions. Trotter and other radicals tended to come from the North, where African Americans exercised more rights in daily life, including the suffrage, were more urbanized, and had achieved more in work and education, but were still subject to discrimination.|$|E
5|$|The {{economic}} situation improved {{with the arrival}} of cattle in the colony. It is unknown when the first cattle arrived, but the division of land for the grazing of cattle in 1627 represented one of the first moves towards private land ownership in the colony. Cattle became an important source of wealth in the colony; the average cow could sell for £28 in 1638 (£ in 2010, or $ at PPP). However, the flood of immigrants during <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Migration</b> drove the price of cattle down. The same cows sold at £28 in 1638 were valued in 1640 at only £5 (£ in 2010, or $ at PPP). Besides cattle, there were also pigs, sheep, and goats raised in the colony.|$|E
5|$|The sociopolitical {{atmosphere}} of Chicago {{was one of}} ethnic tension caused by competition among many new groups. With <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Migration,</b> thousands of African Americans from the South had settled next to neighborhoods of European immigrants on Chicago's South Side, near jobs in the stockyards and meatpacking plants. The Irish had been established first, and fiercely defended their territory and political power against all newcomers. Post World War I tensions caused frictions between the races, especially in the competitive labor and housing markets. Overcrowding and increased African American militancy by veterans contributed to the visible racial frictions. Also, a combination of ethnic gangs and police neglect strained the racial relationships. According to official reports, the turmoil came to a boil {{after the death of}} an African American youth who had accidentally drifted into a swimming area at an informally segregated beach. Tensions between groups arose in a melee that blew up into days of unrest.|$|E

5|$|Elected {{officials}} in Florida represented the voting white majority. Governor Napoleon Bonaparte Broward (1905–1909) suggested finding a location {{out of state}} for black people to live separately. Tens {{of thousands of people}} moved to the North during and after World War I in <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Migration,</b> unsettling labor markets and introducing more rapid changes into cities. They were recruited by many expanding northern industries, such as the Pennsylvania Railroad, the steel industry, and meatpacking. Florida governors Park Trammell (1913–1917) and Sidney Catts (1917–1921) generally ignored the emigration of blacks to the North and its causes. While Trammell was state attorney general, none of the 29 lynchings committed during his term were prosecuted, nor were any of the 21 that occurred while he was governor. Catts ran on a platform of white supremacy and anti-Catholic sentiment; he openly criticized the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) when they complained he did nothing to investigate two lynchings in Florida. Catts changed his message when the turpentine and lumber industries claimed labor was scarce; he began to plead with black workers to stay in the state. By 1940, 40,000 black people had left Florida to find employment, but also to escape the oppression of segregation, underfunded education and facilities, violence, and disenfranchisement.|$|E
5|$|In 1917, {{two summers}} before the Chicago riot, {{extensive}} and deadly race riots {{broke out in}} the expanding, war-time cities of East St. Louis, Illinois, and Houston, Texas, influencing the violent events of Red Summer across the nation and in Chicago. The postwar period also found tensions rising in numerous cities where populations were increasing rapidly. People from different cultures jostled against each other and competed for space. In 1917, the Chicago Real Estate Board established a policy of block by block segregation. New arrivals in <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Migration</b> generally joined old neighbors on the South Side. By 1920, the area held 85% of Chicago's African Americans--middle and upper class and poor. In the postwar period, veterans of all groups were looking to re-enter the work force. Some whites resented African-American veterans. At the same time, African-American veterans exhibited greater militancy and pride as a result of having served to protect their country. They expected to be treated as full citizens after fighting for the nation. Meanwhile, younger black men rejected the passivity traditional of the South and promoted armed self-defense and control of their neighborhoods.|$|E
5|$|In September 1623, another ship arrived {{carrying}} settlers {{destined to}} refound the failed colony at Weymouth, and they stayed temporarily in Plymouth. In March 1624, a ship arrived bearing a few additional settlers {{and the first}} cattle. A 1627 division of cattle lists 156 colonists divided into twelve lots of thirteen colonists each. Another ship arrived in August 1629, also named the Mayflower, with 35 additional members of the Leiden congregation. Ships arrived throughout the period between 1629 and 1630 carrying new settlers, though the exact number is unknown; contemporaneous documents claimed that, by January 1630, the colony had almost 300 people. In 1643, the colony had an estimated 600 males fit for military service, implying a total population of about 2,000. By 1690, {{on the eve of}} the dissolution of the colony, the estimated total population of Plymouth County, the most populous, was 3,055 people. It is estimated that the entire population of the colony at the point of its dissolution was around 7,000. For comparison, it is estimated that more than 20,000 settlers had arrived in Massachusetts Bay Colony between 1630 and 1640 (a period known as <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Migration),</b> and the English population of all New England was estimated to be about 60,000 by 1678. Plymouth was the first colony in the region but, by the time of its annexation, it was much smaller than Massachusetts Bay Colony.|$|E
