5|$|In September 1765, Adams {{was once}} again {{appointed}} by the Boston Town Meeting to write the instructions for Boston's delegation to the Massachusetts House of Representatives. As it <b>turned</b> <b>out,</b> <b>he</b> wrote his own instructions; on September 27, the town meeting selected him to replace the recently deceased Oxenbridge Thacher as one of Boston's four representatives in the assembly. James Otis was attending the Stamp Act Congress in New York City, so Adams was the primary author {{of a series of}} House resolutions against the Stamp Act, which were more radical than those passed by the Stamp Act Congress. Adams {{was one of the first}} colonial leaders to argue that mankind possessed certain natural rights that governments could not violate.|$|E
5|$|Pandro Berman—who {{had filled}} in on three {{previous}} occasions—accepted {{the position of}} production chief on a noninterim basis. As it <b>turned</b> <b>out,</b> <b>he</b> would leave the job before the decade's turn, but his brief tenure resulted {{in some of the}} most notable films in studio history, including Gunga Din, with Grant and McLaglen; Love Affair, starring Dunne and Charles Boyer; and The Hunchback of Notre Dame (all 1939). Charles Laughton, who gave a now fabled performance as Quasimodo in the latter, returned periodically to the studio, headlining six more RKO features. For Maureen O'Hara, who made her American screen debut in the film, it was the first of ten pictures she would make for RKO through 1952. After co-starring with Ginger Rogers for the ninth time in The Story of Vernon and Irene Castle (1939), Fred Astaire departed the studio.|$|E

25|$|On March 16, 1998, it {{was exposed}} that the Drillers {{management}} had forgone getting medical insurance for their players, {{leading to a}} substantial controversy as the players had not been {{made aware of the}} situation and it was against league regulations. The situation only came to ahead after the Vancouver Whitecaps inquired over the insurance situation for a player they had loaned to the Drillers, and it <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>he</b> was uninsured. The club quickly put together an insurance package before the next night's game in Cincinnati.|$|E
25|$|Boyce {{thereafter}} switched {{parties and}} became the campaign treasurer for the Lyons gubernatorial bid. He would serve as state party chairman from 1972 to 1976. In that campaign, McKeithen had accused Lyons of being pre-committed to the 1964 Republican presidential candidate, and he incorrectly predicted that the nominee would be, not Senator Goldwater, but then Governor Nelson Aldrich Rockefeller of New York, considered the liberal, internationalist candidate. McKeithen {{said that he would}} keep his options open for the 1964 presidential election. As it <b>turned</b> <b>out,</b> <b>he</b> remained neutral in that race, but the state's two popular Democratic senators, Allen Ellender and Russell B. Long, both supported the Johnson-Humphrey ticket.|$|E
25|$|Kelly was {{extremely}} disturbed {{that the media}} had identified {{his role in the}} matter and arranged with a family friend to leave his home and visit Cornwall with his wife. He was asked to appear as a witness before two committees of the House of Commons that were investigating the situation in Iraq and was further upset by the news that one of the appearances would be in public.

25|$|Petrosian was {{partially}} deaf {{and wore a}} hearing aid during his matches, which sometimes led to strange situations. On one occasion he offered a draw to Svetozar Gligorić, which Gligorić initially refused in surprise, but then changed his mind {{in a few seconds}} and re-offered the draw. However, Petrosian did not even respond, instead went ahead and won the game. As it later <b>turned</b> <b>out,</b> <b>he</b> switched off his hearing aid, and did not hear when Gligorić re-offered the draw. In 1971, he played a candidates match against Robert Hübner in a noisy area in Seville, which did not disturb him, but frustrated Hübner so much that he finally withdrew from the match.|$|E
25|$|In 2012 Nicole visited Leanne {{after her}} brother Eric (Mick Andrews) had a severe {{schizophrenic}} episode. In 2014 Nicole and Vinnie Kruse (Pua Magasiva) returned to Tauranga after Leanne requested help with Eric once again. However, when Nicole suggested Leanne was the issue, she kicked her out only {{to show up}} in Ferndale with Eric. Following Eric being sent into care, Leanne made it clear that she thought Nicole should date Vinnie over girlfriend Harper Whitley (Ria Vandervis). She returned to her role as receptionist at the hospital having sold her house in Tauranga. Leanne had a brief flirtation with Murray Cooper (Matthew Chamberlain) after mistakingly believing he and his wife Wendy (Jacqueline Nairn) were swingers. She began to date Nev Carlson (Stuart Devenie) much to the angst of Nicole, but he left her for one of his five ex-wives. Leanne soon found herself becoming a burden to her family but this changed when she began to date Howard Black (Michael Saccente) who lavished her in expensive gifts. Though it soon <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>he</b> had a potentially terminal illness and he returned to America, with Leanne nearly joining him on the day of Nicole's wedding. In 2016 Leanne began to feel elderly and underwent plastic surgery only for the anaesthetic not to work, leading to her being awake during the aborted procedure. Feeling increasingly unwanted at work, Leanne was overjoyed when Howard returned to Ferndale. The two decided to marry and after realising how much she needed to move on, she left Ferndale. 3 months later, Leanne returned to Ferndale temporarily after her honeymoon with Howard although it soon <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>he</b> had fallen overboard of the cruise ship and had drowned.|$|E
25|$|The film had {{its roots}} in an earlier concept for a new King Kong feature {{developed}} by Willis O'Brien, animator of the original stop-motion Kong. Around 1960, O'Brien {{came up with a}} proposed treatment, King Kong meets Frankenstein, where Kong would fight against a giant version of Frankenstein's monster in San Francisco. O'Brien took the project (which consisted of some concept art and a screenplay treatment) to RKO to secure permission to use the King Kong character. During this time the story was renamed King Kong vs. the Ginko when it was believed that Universal had the rights to the Frankenstein name (it actually only had the rights to the monster's makeup design). O'Brien was introduced to producer John Beck, who promised to find a studio to make the film (at this point in time, RKO was no longer a production company). Beck took the story treatment and had George Worthing Yates flesh it out into a screenplay. The story was slightly altered and the title changed to King Kong vs. Prometheus, returning the name to the original Frankenstein concept (The Modern Prometheus was the alternate name of Frankenstein in the original novel). Unfortunately, the cost of stop-motion animation discouraged potential studios from putting the film into production. After shopping the script around overseas, Beck eventually attracted the interest of the Japanese studio Toho, which had long wanted to make a King Kong film and was also planning for Godzilla to make a comeback around the same time. After purchasing the script, they decided to replace the Frankenstein creature with Godzilla to be King Kong's opponent and would have Shinichi Sekizawa rewrite Yates's script. The studio thought that it would be the perfect way to celebrate its thirtieth year in production. It was one of 5 big banner releases for the company to celebrate the anniversary alongside Sanjuro, , Lonely Lane, and Born in Sin. John Beck's dealings with Willis O'Brien's project were done behind his back and O'Brien was never credited for his idea. In 1963, Merian C. Cooper attempted to file a lawsuit against John Beck claiming that he outright owned the King Kong character, but the lawsuit never went through as it <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>he</b> was not Kong's sole legal owner as he had previously believed.|$|E

500|$|The {{song that}} plays during Bart's {{training}} montage is [...] "Winner Takes It All" [...] by American rock singer Sammy Hagar. Selman decided {{to include the}} song after hearing it in the 1987 action drama film Over the Top. According to Doyle, the scene was originally much longer, almost seven minutes in length. The song that plays during the episode's end credits is [...] "Highway to Hell" [...] by Australian hard rock band AC/DC. According to Scully, the staff could not use the song on The Simpsons at first, since AC/DC's record company refused to sell it. However, when Scully called the band's manager directly, it <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>he</b> had not been told about the request. Scully said that when they {{asked if they could}} use [...] "Highway to Hell", the band's manager [...] "signed on right away" [...] and gave the Simpsons staff a [...] "huge discount." ...|$|E
500|$|On {{the morning}} of 2 July, St. Clair decided to {{withdraw}} the men occupying the defence post at Mount Hope, which was exposed and subject to capture. [...] The detachment there {{set fire to the}} works and retreated to the old French lines (so called because they were the site of the French defence in the 1758 Battle of Carillon), getting away not long before the arrival of Burgoyne's advance guard. [...] That afternoon, a company of British soldiers and Indians came toward those lines, but not near enough to do significant damage, and opened fire. [...] St. Clair ordered his men to hold their fire until the enemy was closer, but James Wilkinson fired at a British soldier, spurring the untrained defenders to follow suit. [...] The soldier Wilkinson fired at fell, and the British troops fled. [...] When the man was captured, it <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>he</b> was uninjured, and that he had fallen down because he was drunk. [...] Through the deception of placing him with a man posing as a captured Loyalist, St. Clair learned the nature of the opposing forces.|$|E
500|$|In 1902, Edson S. Jones, a {{descendant}} of Thomas Arnold of Watertown and Providence mentioned earlier, visited England in search of records pertaining to his family. [...] Thinking that Thomas Arnold was connected with William Arnold (which, it <b>turned</b> <b>out,</b> <b>he</b> was not), he visited Northover and Ilchester, finding the original parish registers, {{as well as other}} important source documents. [...] He discovered that every entry in the Arnold record that could be compared with entries in the parish registers matched perfectly. [...] He also discovered that the Somerby pedigree of the Arnold family had serious discrepancies with original documents. [...] As he checked the source documents from which Somerby supposedly compiled the pedigree, he found that some of the generations in the Somerby pedigree had been shuffled from the original documents, some members of the lineage came from unrelated families, and some place names seemed to have been totally made up. [...] It had earlier been believed that a Thomas Arnold was the father of William Arnold, and Somerby stated that this Thomas Arnold came from a place called Northover near Cheselbourne in County Dorset. [...] No such place exists. [...] The Somerby pedigree of the Arnold family published in 1879 was riddled with misinformation, and it had been accepted as fact for over three decades by even prominent genealogists such as John Osborne Austin. [...] Fred Arnold wrote in 1921, [...] "The most regrettable feature in Somerby's work is, that {{in the absence of any}} English record, known here to disprove it, so reliable a genealogist as Mr. John O. Austin was led to accept and use it in his dictionary, although neither give any record evidence. [...] Very rarely has Mr. Austin accepted another's statement, unless he has himself seen evidence to support it." [...] This fabricated research was not an isolated incident; Mr. Somerby had also been implicated in other fraudulent research and was out to please his clients regardless of the veracity of his work.|$|E

500|$|In January 2011, Eastwood {{told the}} UK's Daily Mail that [...] "I loved {{the fact that}} Obama is multi-racial. I thought that was terrific, as my wife is the same racial make-up. But I felt he was a greenhorn, and it <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>he</b> didn't have {{experience}} in decision-making." [...] As for McCain, Eastwood reflected, [...] "I voted for McCain, {{not because he was}} a Republican, but because he had been through war (in Vietnam) and I thought he might understand the war in Iraq better than somebody who hadn't. I didn't agree with him on a lot of stuff." [...] On August 3, 2012, he attended a fundraiser for Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, suggesting that Romney would boost the country and [...] "restore a decent tax system... so that there's a fairness and people are not pitted against one another as [...] who's paying taxes and who isn't." [...] During a speech at the 2012 Republican National Convention, Eastwood talked to an empty chair as if President Barack Obama were sitting in it. The speech was met with a huge response by the media with both praise and criticism. Eastwood, who said he came up with the speech 5 seconds before he gave it, said that if he could do it again he would say something different. [...] "My only message was [...] I wanted people to take the idolizing factor out of every contestant out there. Just look at the work, look at the background, and then make a judgment on that. I was just trying to say that, and did it in kind of a roundabout way which took a lot more time, I suppose, than they would have liked. I'd probably say something else but I'd try to get the same message across so that people don't have to kiss up to politicians. No matter what party they're in, you should evaluate their work and make your judgments accordingly. That's {{the way to do it}} in life and every other subject, but sometimes in America we get gaga, we look at the wrong values." ...|$|E
