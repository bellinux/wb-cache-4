50|$|The solar humidification-dehumidification method (HDH) is a <b>thermal</b> water <b>desalination</b> method. It {{is based}} on {{evaporation}} of sea water or brackish water and consecutive condensation of the generated humid air, mostly at ambient pressure. This process mimics the natural water cycle, but over a much shorter time frame.|$|R
2500|$|Originally {{stemming}} from {{ocean thermal energy}} conversion research, low-temperature <b>thermal</b> <b>desalination</b> (LTTD) takes advantage of water boiling at low pressure, even at ambient temperature. The system uses pumps to create a low-pressure, low-temperature environment in which water boils at a temperature gradient of [...] between two volumes of water. Cool ocean water is supplied from depths of up to [...] This water is pumped through coils to condense the water vapor. The resulting condensate is purified water. LTTD may {{take advantage of the}} temperature gradient available at power plants, where large quantities of warm wastewater are discharged from the plant, reducing the energy input needed to create a temperature gradient.|$|E
2500|$|The {{principal}} competing process uses membranes to desalt saline water, principally applying {{reverse osmosis}} (RO). The RO membrane processes use semipermeable membranes and applied [...] pressure (on the membrane feed side) to preferentially induce water permeation through the membrane while rejecting salts. Reverse osmosis plant membrane systems typically use less energy than <b>thermal</b> <b>desalination</b> processes. Desalination processes {{are driven by}} either thermal (e.g., distillation) or electrical (e.g., RO) as the primary energy types. Energy cost in desalination processes varies considerably depending on water salinity, plant size and process type. At present the cost of seawater desalination, for example, is higher than traditional water sources, but {{it is expected that}} costs will continue to decrease with technology improvements that include, but are not limited to, reduction in plants footprint, improvements to plant operation and optimization, more effective feed pretreatment, and lower cost energy sources.|$|E

This prototype made possible the study of the operarational parameters that influence the desalinated water production in the tower, namely, the height of the water column in the storage tank, the type of burner, the gas natural gas flow, the number of desalination stages, and the use of a nano film of the condensations surface. Additionally,it was possible to thermally characterize the dessalination tower by determining the experimental overall heat transfer coeddicient (K 1) of the simultaneous evaporation, radiation, and the convection processes between {{the surface of the water}} in the tank and the condensation walls of the first stage immediately above. The desalination system consisted of a gas natural burning equipment, a tank of storage, and a tower with six desalination stages.
