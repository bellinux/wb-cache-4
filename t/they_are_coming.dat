5|$|Torchwoods third series (2009) is a five-part serial {{entitled}} Children of Earth. Aliens {{known as}} the 4-5-6 announce <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>coming</b> to Earth. Civil servant John Frobisher (Peter Capaldi) orders the destruction of Torchwood to cover a conspiracy; in 1965, the British government had authorized Jack to sacrifice twelve children to the 4-5-6, which is shown in flashbacks. Jack is blown apart in an explosion, but painfully reconstitutes from an incomplete pile of body parts; Gwen and Ianto escape and later rescue Jack from a concrete grave. Jack's daughter Alice (Lucy Cohu) and grandson Steven (Bear McCausland) are taken into custody by the assassins. The 4-5-6 demand {{ten percent of the}} world's children. Although he handed over twelve children in 1965, Jack refuses to give up any this time around. The 4-5-6 release a fatal virus; Ianto dies in Jack's arms. To create the signal that will destroy the 4-5-6, Jack sacrifices Steven. Six months later, having lost his lover, his grandson and his daughter, he bids farewell to Gwen and is transported aboard an alien ship to leave Earth for parts unknown. In the closing scenes of 2010 Doctor Who special The End of Time, the critically injured Doctor gives each companion a farewell before his impending regeneration. Finding Jack in an exotic alien bar, he leaves him a note containing the name of Titanic crew member Alonso Frame (Russell Tovey), sitting on Jack's left side; the two proceed to flirt.|$|E

Some of the parts were not yet cast, and without a finalized title, the series was known only as The Untitled Amy Poehler Project or TUAPP. Alan Sepinwall, television writer for The Star-Ledger, said he found the script very funny even though he normally hates reading comedy scripts [...] "because they're rarely as funny on the page as <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>coming</b> out of an actor's mouth".|$|E

He {{talks about the}} party and claims that he cannot get the phone number of the woman from Elaine {{because he does not}} talk about other women with her; additionally, she is still angry with him. Morty suggests that Jerry [...] "stake out" [...] the woman by waiting outside her office, an idea which Jerry likes. The following day, Jerry and George Costanza perform the stake out, pretending that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>coming</b> to see someone else in the building named [...] "Art Corvelay", but under pressure, George insists that they make it [...] "Art Vandelay".

500|$|The visual {{style of}} The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari is dark, twisted and bizarre; radical and {{deliberate}} distortions in perspective, form, dimension and scale create a chaotic and unhinged appearance. The sets {{are dominated by}} sharp-pointed forms and oblique and curving lines, with narrow and spiraling streets, [...] and structures and landscapes that lean and twist in unusual angles, giving the impression they could collapse or explode at any given moment. Film critic Roger Ebert described it as [...] "a jagged landscape of sharp angles and tilted walls and windows, staircases climbing crazy diagonals, trees with spiky leaves, grass that looks like knives". The sets are characterized by strokes of bold, black paint. The landscape of Holstenwall is painted on canvas, {{as opposed to a}} constructed set, and shadows and streaks of light are painted directly onto the sets, further distorting the viewer's sense of perspective and three-dimensionality. Buildings are clustered and interconnected in a cubist-like architecture, surrounded by dark and twisted back alleys. Lotte Eisner, author of The Haunted Screen, writes that objects in the film appear as if <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>coming</b> alive and [...] "seem to vibrate with an extraordinary spirituality". Likewise, Expressionismus und Film writer Rudolf Kurtz wrote [...] "the dynamic force of objects howls their desire to be created". The rooms have radically offset windows with distorted frames, doors that are not squared, and chairs that are too tall. Strange designs and figures are painted on the walls of corridors and rooms, and trees outside have twisted branches that sometimes resemble tentacles.|$|E

2500|$|Trains move on fixed rails, {{making them}} uniquely {{susceptible}} to collision. [...] This susceptibility {{is exacerbated by}} the enormous weight and inertia of a train, which {{make it difficult to}} quickly stop when encountering an obstacle. [...] Also, trains generally do not stop at grade crossings (level crossings), instead relying upon pedestrians and vehicles to clear the tracks when they pass. [...] Therefore, from their beginnings locomotives have been equipped with loud horns or bells to warn vehicles or pedestrians that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>coming.</b> [...] Steam locomotives had steam whistles, operated from steam produced by their boilers.|$|E
2500|$|Prince of Wales raised {{anchor and}} {{returned}} to sea, sailing aimlessly north and east {{in the hope of}} finding a more hospitable village from which to seek a guide. Shortly after midnight on 22 January she collided with a Chinese ship, striking the Chinese vessel amidships and crushing her under Prince of Wales bow. The English vessel suffered damage to her hull and the loss of her jib-boom, which fell over the side into the Chinese vessel. The smaller Chinese craft was more heavily damaged and began to sink, her crew scrambling overboard to avoid being dragged down with her. Several Chinese sailors sought to climb aboard Prince of Wales, panicking Milner's crew. Paine recorded in his journal that [...] "the Alarm caused me to jump from my cot and run to the arms chest, but such was the call for cutlasses that {{it was not until the}} third or fourth attempt I could reach the deck, being accosted each time in the companionway with [...] "O give me that cutlass sir, and get another for <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>coming</b> on board." ...|$|E
2500|$|Elana Sztokman notes {{it would}} be [...] "difficult to claim that women are equals in the IDF". [...] "And tellingly, {{there is only one}} female general in the entire IDF," [...] she adds. In 2012 {{religious}} soldiers claimed they were promised they would not have to listen to women sing or lecture, but IAF Chief Rabbi Moshe Raved resigned because male religious soldiers were being required to do so. In January 2015 three women IDF singers performed in one of the IDF's units. The performance was first disrupted by fifteen religious soldiers, who left in protest and then the Master Sergeant forced the women to end the performance because it was disturbing the religious soldiers. An IDF spokesperson announced an investigation of the incident: [...] "We are aware of the incident and already began examining it. The exclusion of woman is not consistent with the values of the IDF." [...] Defense Minister Moshe Ya'alon has also arranged for women to be excluded from recruitment centers catering to religious males. As the IDF recruits more religious soldiers, the rights of male religious soldiers and of women in the IDF come into conflict. Brig. Gen. Zeev Lehrer, who served on the chief of staff's panel of the integration of women, noted [...] "There is a clear process of 'religionization' in the army, and the story of the women is a central piece of it. There are very strong pressures at work to halt the process of integrating women into the army, and <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>coming</b> from the direction of religion." [...] Sex segregation is allowed in the IDF, which reached what it considers a [...] "new milestone" [...] in 2006, creating the first company of soldiers segregated in an all female unit, the Nachshol (Hebrew for [...] "giant wave") Reconnaissance Company. [...] "We are the only unit in the world made up entirely of female combat soldiers," [...] said Nachshol Company Commander Cpt. Dana Ben-Ezra. [...] "Our effectiveness and the dividends we earn are the factors by which we are measured, not our gender." ...|$|E
