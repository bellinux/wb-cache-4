50|$|Like {{many modern}} roller coasters, mind bender {{operates}} {{on the block}} system featuring 5 blocks: station, transfer <b>table,</b> <b>lift</b> hill, reduction brake, and ready brake. These blocks are controlled by a program running on a programmable logic controller to ensure trains do not collide with one another. To assist in the movement of trains through the brakes, station, and transfer table, a series of feed motors can move a train at slow speeds from a full stop.|$|E
50|$|A {{computerized}} {{block system}} {{is used to}} prevent trains from contacting each other. GASM has 5 blocks: Station, Transfer <b>Table,</b> <b>Lift,</b> Main Brake, and Ready Brake. Normal operation uses two trains; however, it can be operated with only one. During two-train operation, if the train in the station has not fully exited the loading platform, the inbound train will stop abruptly in the Main Brakes. A combination of proximity switches, mechanical switches, photoelectric sensors, and timers are all used by the controller to track train movements.|$|E

50|$|<b>Lift</b> <b>tables</b> {{can come}} in {{a vast array of}} {{configurations}} and can be built to suit various highly specialized industrial processes. The most common <b>lift</b> <b>table</b> design incorporates hydraulic cylinders and an electrically powered pump to actuate the scissor <b>lifting</b> mechanism. <b>Lift</b> <b>tables</b> can also be driven by pneumatic sources, trapezoidal-threaded screw drives, push chains or by hydraulic foot pump when the load is not heavy. <b>Lift</b> <b>tables</b> can be mounted in a pit for floor-level loading, especially useful for access by manual pallet-pump trucks and the mobility impaired or wheelchair users.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>lift</b> <b>table</b> is {{a device}} that employs a {{scissors}} mechanism to raise or lower goods and/or persons. Typically <b>lift</b> <b>tables</b> are used to raise large, heavy loads through relatively small distances. Common applications include pallet handling, vehicle loading and work positioning. <b>Lift</b> <b>tables</b> are a recommended way to help reduce incidents of musculoskeletal disorders [...] by correctly re-positioning work at a suitable height for operators. <b>Lift</b> <b>tables</b> lend themselves to being easily adapted to a specific use. They can work in hostile environments, be manufactured in stainless steel and have equipment like conveyors, turn-tables, barriers and gates easily added to their deckplates.|$|R

50|$|In Europe {{there is}} a {{published}} standard BS EN 1570: 1998 + A2: 2009 Safety requirements for <b>lifting</b> <b>tables.</b> Standard EN 1570-1 is now EN 15701-1:2011+A1:2014. It is a Type C standard and compliance with this standard confers conformity with the Machinery Directive, 2006/42/EC. Work is already being undertaken to revise this standard and possibly split it into 3 parts. It specifies the criteria for the raising and lowering of goods and/or persons associated with the movement of goods carried by <b>lifting</b> <b>tables.</b> When using <b>lift</b> <b>tables</b> for uses not covered by International / Regional standards e.g. EN1570 then further consideration {{may need to be}} given to the associated Risks and hazards.|$|R

American cinematographer Harold Rosson, whom MGM frequently loaned out for British productions, has fun with what were still novelty special effects in 1936, using locked-down cameras to create chairs and tables that moved by themselves and appear and disappear at whim.|$|R

50|$|Bales may {{be picked}} up {{from the field and}} stacked using a {{self-powered}} machine called a bale stacker, bale wagon or harobed. There are several designs and sizes. One type picks up square bales are dropped by the baler with the strings facing upward. The stacker will drive up to each bale, pick it up and set it on a three-bale-wide table (the strings are now facing upwards). Once three bales are on the <b>table,</b> the <b>table</b> <b>lifts</b> up and back, causing the three bales to face strings to the side again; this happens three more times until there are 16 bales on the main table. This <b>table</b> will <b>lift</b> like the smaller one, and the bales will be up against a vertical table. The machine will hold 160 bales (ten tiers); usually there will be cross-tiers near the center to keep the stack from swaying or collapsing if any weight is applied {{to the top of the}} stack. The full load will be transported to a barn; the whole rear of the stacker will tilt upwards until it is vertical. There will be two pushers that will extend through the machine and hold the bottom of the stack from being pulled out from the stacker while it is driven out of the barn.|$|R
