25|$|The {{main body}} of the book appears to be written for {{consolation}} in a period of great distress (one scholarly hypothesis is that it dates to Titus' destruction of the Second Temple in AD 70). The author seeks answers, similar to Job's quest for understanding the meaning of suffering, but the author doesn't like or desire only <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>that</b> was given to Job.|$|E
25|$|A multinomial discrete-choice {{model can}} examine the {{responses}} to these questions (model G, model H, model I). However, these models are derived under the concept that the respondent obtains some utility for each possible answer and gives <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>that</b> provides the greatest utility. It might be more natural {{to think that the}} respondent has some latent measure or index associated with the question and answers in response to how high this measure is. Ordered logit and ordered probit models are derived under this concept.|$|E

25|$|Obtaining precise {{number is}} {{difficult}} {{for a variety of}} reasons. One of the major reasons for the difference in statistical findings regarding homosexuality and bisexuality {{has to do with the}} nature of the research questions. Major research studies on sexual orientation are discussed. Most of the studies listed below rely on self-report data, which poses challenges to researchers inquiring into sensitive subject matter. More importantly, the studies tend to pose two sets of questions. One set examines self-report data of same-sex sexual experiences and attractions while the other set examines self-report data of personal identification as homosexual or bisexual. Fewer research subjects identify as homosexual or bisexual than report having had sexual experiences or attraction to a person of the same sex. Several studies of sexual orientation in countries provide comparative perspectives. Tables comparing several U.S. cities' population numbers are also included. However, since many individuals may fail to report outside the heterosexual norm or define their sexuality in their own unique terms, it is difficult to fully grasp the size of the LGBT population. The type of survey being used and the type of setting a subject is in while being surveyed may also affect <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>that</b> the subject gives.|$|E
500|$|Another of Gestumblindi's riddles asks, [...] "What is that beast all girded with iron, which {{kills the}} flocks? [...] He has eight horns but no head, and runs as he pleases." [...] Here, it is <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>that</b> is controversial, as the {{response}} has been variously translated as: [...] "It is the húnn in hnefatafl. He has {{the name of a}} bear and runs when he is thrown;" [...] or, [...] "It is the húnn in hnefatafl. He has the name of a bear and escapes when he is attacked." [...] The first problem is in translating the word húnn, which may refer to a die (as suggested by the former translation), the [...] "eight horns" [...] referring to the eight corners of a six-sided die and [...] "the flocks" [...] that he kills referring to the stakes the players lose. [...] Alternatively, húnn may refer to the king, his [...] "eight horns" [...] referring to the eight defenders, which is more consistent with the latter translation, [...] "He has the name of a bear and escapes when he is attacked." [...] Ultimately, the literary references prove inconclusive on the use of dice in Hnefatafl.|$|E
500|$|... (Acheson) {{insisted on}} having, {{as a legal}} adviser, a lawyer whose ability as a lawyer and whose {{judgment}} in politics and statesmanship could be greatly respected. He got Adrian Fisher for that, and he involved him {{in all of the}} political and other activities that he himself was involved in. The Secretary of State always is involved in a lot of controversial things, and here we had the McCarthy era, the attack on the whole concept of Foreign Service and the State Department, and a terrific controversy over what to do about China, who had [...] "lost China." [...] Fisher was always at Acheson's right hand when he was dealing with other people about these things. Wherever he went, Fisher's office was backstopping him, getting all the necessary background information so he'd be prepared for any kind of question that came up. Of course, Acheson's own approach to being Secretary of State was such that when you took an agreement to him to be signed, his chief question was [...] "By what authority do I sign this?" [...] And whoever brought it to him to get it signed, had to be ready with <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>that</b> would satisfy a lawyer -- [...] "by what legal authority" [...] -- as well as what it provides and so forth.|$|E

2500|$|Emperor Gaozu was sailing {{on a lake}} {{inside the}} Palace City {{during the time of}} the coup. [...] speculates that the emperor was alarmed by the {{impending}} crisis, thus he withdrew himself from the situation. He also surrounded himself with senior officials who were friendly to Li Shimin, because he possibly realized that Li Shimin was the cause of this and had better military connections that provided him with the advantage. The officials were Pei Ji, Xiao Yu, Chen Shuda, Feng Lun, Yan Shigu, Dou Dan (竇誕), and Yuwen Shiji. During the ongoing battle, Li Shimin sent Yuchi Jingde—who was still fully armed—into the Palace City to announce the news of the situation to Emperor Gaozu. Emperor Gaozu asked what was disturbing the peace and why he came. Yuchi Jingde replied: [...] "The Crown Prince and the Prince of Qi committed treason. The Prince of Qin mobilized his troops and executed them. He feared that Your Imperial Majesty would be shocked and he sent me to protect you." [...] Emperor Gaozu accepted <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>that</b> he received from Yuchi Jingde. Subsequently, as the Zizhi Tongjian states, Emperor Gaozu turned to his officials and asked them: [...] "I did not anticipate that today I should see such a thing as this. What ought to be done about it?" [...] Two of them spoke highly meritoriously of Li Shimin and said that the killings of the two princely brothers served as a punishment. They also recommended Emperor Gaozu to appoint Li Shimin as the heir apparent.|$|E
