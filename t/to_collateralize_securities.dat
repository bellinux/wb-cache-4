Thus loan contracts must be structured to enhance the lender's incentives to monitor.

Thus both covenants and collateral can be motivated as contractual devices that increase a lender's incentive to monitor.

In the cross section, more constrained firms lease more and engage in less risk management and may completely abstain, contrary to extant theory and consistent with the evidence.

40|$|The recent US {{liquidity}} crisis, {{triggered by}} the failure of mortgage-related securities, produced long-lasting ramifications inside and outside of the US. International financial indicators and the housing markets demonstrate that the mortgage-related liquidity problems keep reverberating throughout the US and the global economy. In the US, even such giants as Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, which were expected to inject market liquidity, have declared considerable losses from subprime MBS. The ongoing crisis provided a fertile ground for a number of publications and research. However, a range of fundamental issues regarding legislative responses to the US MBS crisis and its international corollaries remain ambiguous. This research aspires to shed light on the momentous lessons of the crisis in a way assisting foreign lawmakers who seek to commence securitization in their jurisdictions. First, the paper is premised on the argument that securitization is a profitable evolving phenomenon despite the present crisis and criticism in the scholarship of recent years. Secondly, the author discusses the consequences and possible methods of increasing the incentives of the parties, such as, inter alia, lenders and rating agencies, to ensure more responsible pricing of the underlying mortgages and <b>collateralized</b> <b>securities.</b> It is furthermore important to scrutinize the agenda of the US regulators and financial industries as their approaches are oftentimes transplanted abroad in some way. The third point in question is the impact of the US, as a model securitization jurisdiction, on other countries.

40|$|This paper {{attempts}} {{to assess the}} economic significance and implications of collateralization in different financial markets, which is essentially a matter of theoretical justification and empirical verification. We present a comprehensive theoretical framework that allows for collateralization adhering to bankruptcy laws. As such, the model can back out differences in asset prices due <b>to</b> <b>collateralized</b> counterparty risk. This framework is very useful for pricing outstanding defaultable financial contracts. By using a unique data set, {{we are able to}} achieve a clean decomposition of prices into their credit risk factors. We find empirical evidence that counterparty risk is not overly important in credit-related spreads. Only the joint effects of collateralization and credit risk can sufficiently explain unsecured credit costs. This finding suggests that failure to properly account for collateralization may result in significant mispricing of financial contracts. We also analyze the difference between cleared and OTC markets. ...|$|R
