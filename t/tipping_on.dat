They found that P. cerviniventris showed distinct morphological and plumage variation when compared to P. superciliosa, including larger size, rich tawny-rufous flanks, white <b>tipping</b> <b>on</b> all retrices and duskier grey-brown upper dorsum. Schodde and Mason also note that {{there is no evidence of}} recent genetic flow between the two taxa across the Gulf of Carpentaria and morphological differences are most extreme for populations that are closest in terms of distribution.|$|E
50|$|In 1989, Regan founded Scallywag {{magazine}} in South Dorset when {{the lure of}} journalism drew him back from his retirement in Butterfly World on Lodmoor Park, Weymouth. Initially Scallywag was a local magazine seeking to expose local issues. A recurrent theme was illegal <b>tipping</b> <b>on</b> the nearby Lodmoor refuse deport where he accused council staff of taking bribes to allow dangerous chemicals to be tipped. He also claimed widespread police corruption associated with Freemasonry in Dorset and {{claimed to have been}} beaten up by two off-duty policemen in College Lane, Weymouth. He also 'named and shamed' people he perceived as being paedophiles. However, like so many of his campaigns, no substantial legally acceptable evidence was ever produced.|$|E

5000|$|Because {{of their}} double coat, Keeshonden need regular brushing; {{an hour a}} week will keep the dog {{comfortable}} and handsome. The Keeshond's coat sheds dirt when dry, and the breed is not prone to doggy odor, [...] so frequent bathing is unnecessary and undesirable. The coat acts as insulation and protects the dog from sunburn and insects, so shaving is not desirable, however some owners find it beneficial to clip their dogs coats in hotter weather. The coat also loses its distinct color as the black <b>tipping</b> <b>on</b> the hairs will be shorn off. If frequent brushing is too much effort, {{it is better to}} choose another breed rather than clip the Keeshond short.|$|E
50|$|Instability {{is caused}} by the centre of mass of the ship rising above the {{metacenter}} resulting in the ship <b>tipping</b> <b>on</b> its side or capsizing, which {{is often referred to as}} foundered or foundering. This can lead to a sinking if the openings on the upper side are not watertight at the time of the capsize. To remain buoyant, the hull of a vessel must prevent water entering the large air spaces of the vessel (known as downflooding). Clearly for the ship to float, the submerged parts of the hull will be watertight, but the upper parts of the hull must have openings to allow ventilation to compartments, including the engine room, for crew access, and to load and unload cargo. Large ships are designed with Compartments to help avoid foundering.|$|E
5000|$|Due to {{its history}} as a working dog (i.e., being bred for {{function}} over form), the Malinois can vary greatly in appearance. The acceptable colors of pure-bred Malinois are a base color fawn to mahogany and tan with a black mask and black ears {{with some degree of}} black <b>tipping</b> <b>on</b> the hairs, giving an overlay appearance. The color tends to be lighter with less black agouti or overlay on the dog's underside, breeching, and inner leg. White markings are also allowed on the tips of the toes and the chest, as long as the white on the chest does not extend up to the neck. A Belgian malinois may have a longer and darker hair coat then the typical malinois but may still be referred to as a malinois.|$|E

On 17 April 1838 two men, George Lloyd and George Morgan, appeared before the Supreme Court of Calcutta. The court found them guilty as charged: of having assaulted a man named William <b>Tipping</b> <b>on</b> the public street and of stealing his musical snuffbox valued at fourteen rupees. The judge sentenced both men to seven years’ transportation, but while Lloyd was ordered to Van Diemen’s Land, one of Britain’s penal settlements in Australia, Morgan’s destination {{was to be the}} East India Company’s Indian penal settlement in the Tenasserim Provinces of Burma. The newspaper reporting the trial, The Calcutta Courier, noted that Morgan’s ‘demeanour had all along been very contemptuous’. On leaving the courtroom he had, apparently, ‘thanked his lordship’.

40|$|Plectranthus edulis (Vatke) Agnew {{is one of}} the tuber crops of {{the genus}} Plectranthus that is widely {{cultivated}} in Africa and Asia. P. edulis produces below-ground tubers on stolons originating from the stems, comparable to the potato (Solanum tuberosum L.). Farmers apply several laborious cultural practices to enhance shoot growth and yield, among which shoot tipping is very common. Tipping (pinching) is the removal of the shoot apex with one or two pairs of leaves from the main stems and branches. The rationale of this practice, especially when repeated more than once during one cropping season, is not fully understood. One similar experiment with two cultivars was carried out at two locations (Awassa and Wondogenet) in Ethiopia to assess and analyse the effects of shoot tipping and its frequency on crop development and tuber production. Tipping treatments included zero tipping, tipping once, tipping twice and tipping thrice, with the first tipping taking place 68 days after planting (DAP), a stage at which most of the stems reached a height of about 0 · 15 m, and the remainder following at intervals of 44 – 46 days. Tipping stimulated stem branching; it significantly increased the number of primary, secondary and tertiary stems in both experiments. Soil cover increased with an increase in the frequency of the tipping in Awassa, because of the tipping effects on the different canopy development variables. Tipping also enhanced the soil cover in Wondogenet, but the crop did not gain any extra benefit from a third tipping. Tipping enhanced early stolon formation, but did not consistently affect the number of stolons per hole later in the growing season. The number of tubers increased with an increase in the frequency of tipping in both cultivars in Wondogenet and in one cultivar in Awassa. Tuber dry matter yield increased with an increase in the frequency of tipping at both sites. Fresh tuber yield in the final harvest at 208 DAP was c. 1 · 9 kg/m 2. <b>Tipping</b> <b>on</b> average increased fresh tuber yield by 17 % in Wondogenet, whereas the difference was not detectable in Awassa. Because senescence was delayed slightly by tipping, yield effects of tipping might be larger when harvesting later. In general, there was a positive effect of <b>tipping</b> <b>on</b> canopy development and tuber yield...|$|E

30|$|Kravitz’s 2009 study [14] {{repeated}} a mean {{accuracy of}} 41 % for mesiodistal tipping, which was most accurate {{at both the}} upper (43 %) and lower (49 %) lateral incisors; mesiodistal tipping of the upper (35 %) and lower (27 %) canines and the upper central incisors (39 %) was the least accurate. Our F 22 results {{are in line with}} these findings, in that the least predictable movements achieved in the anterior sector were the upper canines and incisors, although once again, our accuracy scores were markedly higher. Indeed, the mesiodistal tip achieved at neither the upper canines (0.78, SD =  0.5), nor the upper premolars (0.7, SD =  0.78), upper molars (0.93, SD =  1.02), lower incisors (0.88, SD =  0.86), lower canines (0.87, SD =  0.82), lower premolars (0.97, SD =  0.97) or lower molars (0.62, SD =  0.82) was significantly different from 1, considered full achievement of the outcomes predicted by the setup. As regards vestibulolingual <b>tipping,</b> <b>on</b> the other hand, neither the lower incisors (0.86, SD =  0.64), nor the lower premolars (0.9, SD =  0.81) or lower molars (0.86, SD =  0.5) exhibited an accuracy index not significantly different from 1.|$|E
40|$|Surgically-assisted rapid maxillary {{expansion}} in adults {{has been proved}} effective in overcoming the strong resistance of the maxillary complex after growth is completed, particularly after the second decade of life. The {{aim of this study}} was to describe the dental and the skeletal expansion and relapse, as well as the amount of tipping of the two maxillary bones and first permanent molars, during a rapid maxillary expansion procedure combined with unilateral and bilateral corticotomies. The sample consisted of four adult patients, two presenting with bilateral and two with unilateral cross-bite. Records were taken before and after rapid maxillary expansion, at the end of retention and at least 12 months post-retention. In the cases of bilateral cross-bite the same amount of skeletal expansion was observed on both sides. The angular changes measured at the upper first molars indicated important <b>tipping</b> <b>on</b> both sides, which tended to relapse moderately during the retention and post-retention period. Following unilateral surgery, the operated side showed more than twice the amount of skeletal expansion than the non-operated side. The angular changes presented twice as much tipping and relapse on the operated side. The results of this study demonstrate that unilateral cross-bites in adults can be corrected with unilateral corticotomy and rapid maxillary expansion using the contralateral non-operated side as anchorage. Stability appeared satisfactory in all case...|$|E
40|$|The {{possibility}} {{of using the}} Pendulum in a modular version, with removable arms, springs, arches and other components, makes it a first-choice appliance in the lingual aesthetic treatment of most class II malocclusions. The Pendulum, due to its design characteristics, is an intra-oral fixed and purely lingual device. As a result of this, it has achieved a position of superiority in lingual technique therapy. The use of the Pendulum appliance in its standard form, or with some technical modifications {{to make it more}} versatile, has extended its therapeutic use to the field of lingual orthodontics. As in interceptive treatment, it can be seen how the Pendulum successfully achieves its established aim regarding correct molar relationship, while also solving crowding of the incisors thanks to the front area of anchorage (F Pendulum). In adult treatment the F Pendulum is just as valid and appreciated. However, particular care should be taken regarding the biomechanics of distalization {{in order to avoid the}} undesirable effects of extrusions and <b>tipping.</b> <b>On</b> the other hand, distalization tends to be mostly bodily. In adult treatment the insertion of superstructures in the acrylic part has made it possible to introduce various techniques such as implant anchorage, distalization of mid-anterior modular areas and alignment and contraction of the incisors. The multi-bracket lingual technique can be used in on-going treatment immediately after molar distalization or in later advanced phases of treatment, where the functions of the Pendulum are extended...|$|E
