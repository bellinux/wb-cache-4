5|$|Network {{forensics}} {{is concerned}} with <b>the</b> <b>monitoring</b> and analysis of computer network traffic, both local and WAN/internet, {{for the purposes of}} information gathering, evidence collection, or intrusion detection.

5|$|Eruptions on Mauna Loa {{are almost}} always preceded and {{accompanied}} by prolonged episodes of seismic activity, <b>the</b> <b>monitoring</b> {{of which was the}} primary and often only warning mechanism in the past and which remains viable today. Seismic stations have been maintained on Hawaiʻi since the Observatory's inception, but these were concentrated primarily on Kīlauea, with coverage on Mauna Loa improving only slowly through the 20th century. Following the invention of modern monitoring equipment, the backbone of the present-day monitoring system was installed on the volcano in the 1970s. Mauna Loa's July 1975 eruption was forewarned by {{more than a year of}} seismic unrest, with the HVO issuing warnings to the general public from late 1974; the 1984 eruption was similarly preceded by as much as three years of unusually high seismic activity, with volcanologists predicting an eruption within two years in 1983.|$|E
5000|$|His {{words for}} the public came from other sources than the pulpit, {{appearing}} in Omaha and National newspapers. He frequently wrote {{letters to the editor}} of Omaha's main papers, the Omaha World-Herald and the Omaha Bee. He also worked in the black press, particularly for Omaha's The Enterprise edited by George F. Franklin and later by Thomas P. Mahammitt. In 1915 he founded what would become Omaha's biggest black paper, <b>The</b> <b>Monitor.</b> <b>The</b> <b>Monitor</b> started as a church paper and branched out as a general black newspaper. <b>The</b> <b>Monitor</b> was an important organ of black thought of the time, occasionally taking outspoken positions. Its pages, for example, asserted that The Bee and another Omaha paper, The Daily News, contributed significantly to racial tension in Omaha around the riots of 1919 with their [...] "biased treatment of blacks". Also, <b>The</b> <b>Monitor</b> supported Marcus Garvey's Universal Negro Improvement Association. Generally, <b>The</b> <b>Monitor</b> was more moderate. George Wells Parker worked for several years for <b>the</b> <b>Monitor</b> before splitting to form the New Era, feeling <b>the</b> <b>Monitor</b> was too moderate and advocating more Pan-Africanist views. Another journalist who wrote for <b>the</b> <b>Monitor</b> was Lucille Skaggs Edwards. The paper ceased publishing in 1929.|$|R

5|$|Interferometric {{synthetic}} aperture radar (InSAR) is a radar technique used in geodesy and remote sensing. Satellite {{synthetic aperture}} radar images of a geographic feature are taken on separate days, and changes {{that have taken place}} between radar images taken on the separate days are recorded as fringes similar to those obtained in holographic interferometry. The technique can monitor centimeter- to millimeter-scale deformation resulting from earthquakes, volcanoes and landslides, and also has uses in structural engineering, in particular for <b>the</b> <b>monitoring</b> of subsidence and structural stability. Fig20 shows Kilauea, an active volcano in Hawaii. Data acquired using the space shuttle Endeavour's X-band Synthetic Aperture Radar on April 13, 1994 and October 4, 1994 were used to generate interferometric fringes, which were overlaid on the X-SAR image of Kilauea.|$|E
5|$|Malaria {{has been}} {{successfully}} eliminated or greatly reduced in certain areas. Malaria was once common in the United States and southern Europe, but vector control programs, in conjunction with <b>the</b> <b>monitoring</b> and treatment of infected humans, eliminated it from those regions. Several factors contributed, such as the draining of wetland breeding grounds for agriculture and other changes in water management practices, and advances in sanitation, including greater use of glass windows and screens in dwellings. Malaria was eliminated from {{most parts of the}} USA in the early 20th century by such methods, {{and the use of the}} pesticide DDT and other means eliminated it from the remaining pockets in the South in the 1950s as part of the National Malaria Eradication Program. Bill Gates has said that he thinks global eradication is possible by 2040.|$|E

50|$|DDC/CI {{monitors}} {{are sometimes}} supplied with an external color sensor to allow automatic calibration of <b>the</b> <b>monitor's</b> color balance.

25|$|A triple-blind {{study is}} an {{extension}} of the double-blind design; <b>the</b> <b>monitoring</b> committee response variables is not told the identity of the groups.

A triple-blind study has the theoretical advantage of allowing <b>the</b> <b>monitoring</b> committee to evaluate the response variable results more objectively. This assumes that appraisal of efficacy and harm, as well as requests for special analyses, may be biased if group identity is known. However, in a trial where <b>the</b> <b>monitoring</b> committee has an ethical responsibility to ensure participant safety, such a design may be counterproductive since in this case monitoring is often guided by the constellation of trends and their directions. In addition, by the time many monitoring committees receive data, often any emergency situation has long passed.|$|E
