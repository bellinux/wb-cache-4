5|$|By then, Brown had put {{his system}} into place: a strict, {{systematic}} approach to coaching combined with a well-organized recruitment network that drew promising young players from Massillon's junior high school football program. He {{paid no attention to}} race, and brought several African-American players onto the team at a <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>many</b> northern schools excluded them.|$|E
5|$|During {{his brief}} term as mayor, Gallagher oversaw the town during a <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>many</b> prospectors {{headed to the}} Klondike Gold Rush saw Edmonton as a {{stopover}} point.

5|$|Garrow {{made much}} use of jury nullification {{to limit the}} {{punishment}} for his convicted clients, in a <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>many</b> crimes carried the death penalty (the so-called Bloody Code). In 1784 a pair of women were arrested for stealing fans worth 15 shillings, meaning a conviction {{would result in the}} death penalty; Garrow convinced the jury to convict the women of stealing 4 shillings worth of fans, therefore changing the sentence to twelve months of hard labour.|$|E

It was offered for sale in 1929, and at a <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>many</b> country houses were being demolished was given a scrap value of £5,882. With {{the exception of the}} Phelips family portraits, the historic contents and furnishing were disposed of, and the house, an empty shell, remained on the market for two years.|$|E

The Zulu began some years earlier and ran for at least 16 seasons.

50|$|It {{has always}} been the belief that Richard's first wife, Hildegardis Hyde, was a close kinswoman of Lord Clarendon; if this is correct it might help to explain how Richard's life and lands were spared during these troubled <b>times</b> <b>when</b> <b>many</b> of his friends and acquaintances fared very badly. The surname of Richard's second wife cannot be {{confirmed}} but there are good reasons to believe it to be Kingston; the Kingston family were settled near Bandon and Richard named his fifth son Kingston.|$|R

5|$|As a critic, Willis did {{not believe}} in {{including}} discussions of personalities of writers when reviewing their works. He also believed that, though publications should discuss political topics, they should not express party opinions or choose sides. The Mirror flourished at a <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>many</b> publications were discontinuing. Its success was due to the shrewd management of Willis and Morris and the two demonstrated that the American public could support literary endeavors. Willis was becoming an expert in American literature and so, in 1845, Willis and Morris issued an anthology, The Prose and Poetry of America.|$|E
5|$|Gillom {{played for}} the Massillon Tigers between 1938 and 1940, a period during which the team won all of its games and two High School Football National Championships. Gillom, who also played {{basketball}} and other sports, earned All-Ohio honors at Massillon {{and was one of}} several black players on the team at a <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>many</b> northern high schools excluded them. Brown's policy was to use his best players, regardless of race. Gillom set school records for points scored in a season and touchdown passes caught in a season. His record of 108 points in a season still stands.|$|E
5|$|In the Browns' biggest {{trade of}} the offseason, Brown sent end John Harrington to the Chicago Rockets for Bill Boedeker, a halfback. Perhaps the most {{significant}} signing, however, was punter Horace Gillom, who had played for Brown at Massillon Washington High School and who Brown had recruited to Ohio State before World War II. Gillom could kick the ball further than most punters of his era. He changed the way teams approached punting by lining up 15 yards behind the center instead of the customary 10 yards to give himself more space and time to make his kicks. Gillom was also the third black player to sign with the Browns at a <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>many</b> teams did not employ African-Americans. Cleveland chose fullback Dick Hoerner in the AAFC draft, but he signed instead with the Los Angeles Rams of the National Football League.|$|E

The findings align with some of the tenets of social exchange theory, and have important implications for the future of wine and food festivals.

5|$|Within the {{recording}} industry, Martin {{was known for}} having become independent at a <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>many</b> producers were still salaried. However, EMI refused his pleas for royalties on his own work. By 1965, the Beatles' success had given Martin the leverage to start Associated Independent Recording (AIR), which enabled him to hire out his services to other artists. Martin also took EMI’s best producers and staff along with him to AIR. AIR demonstrated how important Martin's talents were to his artists, and it allowed him a share in record royalties on his hits. To this day, AIR {{remains one of the}} world's pre-eminent recording studios. In 1979, Martin opened a studio on the Caribbean island of Montserrat. This studio was destroyed by Hurricane Hugo ten years later.|$|E
5|$|Safety overall has {{steadily}} improved in the United States for many decades. Between 1920 and 2000, {{the rate of}} fatal automobile accidents per vehicle-mile decreased {{by a factor of}} about 17. Except for a pause during the youth bulge of the 1960s (a <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>many</b> young, inexperienced drivers were on the road), progress in reducing fatal accidents has been steady. Safety for other types of U.S. passenger transportation has also improved substantially, but long-term statistical data are not as readily available. While the fatality rate roughly leveled off around 2000–2005 at around 1.5 fatalities per 100 million miles traveled, it has resumed a downward trend and reached 1.27 in 2008. The National Safety Council (whose data methodology differs slightly from the NHTSA) reports a rate (including deaths of pedestrians and cyclists killed in motor vehicle accidents) of 1.25 deaths per 100 million vehicle miles (or 12.5 deaths per billion vehicle miles) traveled in 2016.|$|E

We build an experimental prototype of the tunnel and carry out an extensive performance evaluation that demonstrates its effectiveness under a range of network conditions and real web page fetches...|$|R

5000|$|The Course of Empire is a five-part {{series of}} {{paintings}} created by Thomas Cole in the years 1833-36.

The theme of cycles is also one that Cole returned to frequently, such as in his The Voyage of Life series.

5|$|The {{conductor}} of the combined choir was John Larkin Hopkins, who was also organist of Trinity College. He became ill, and handed over the conductorship to Stanford in 1873. Stanford was also appointed Hopkins's deputy organist at Trinity, and moved from Queens' to Trinity in April 1873. In the summer of that year Stanford made {{his first trip to}} continental Europe. He went to Bonn for the Schumann Festival held there, where he met Joachim and Brahms. His growing love of the music of Schumann and Brahms marked him as a classicist at a <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>many</b> music-lovers were divided into the classical or the modernist camps, the latter represented by the music of Liszt and Wagner. Stanford was not constrained by the fashion for belonging to one camp or the other; he immensely admired Die Meistersinger though he was unenthusiastic about some of Wagner's other works. After leaving Bonn he returned home by way of Switzerland and then Paris, where he saw Meyerbeer's Le prophète.|$|E
