5|$|In {{an effort}} to cut costs, the Kentucky State Police {{announced}} in May 2009 that it would only offer the state driving test in English beginning June 1, 2009. The test had previously been offered in 22 foreign languages, but the state police said that the foreign language versions of the test had not been updated to reflect recent changes to driving laws. Two days later, Beshear announced the reversal of the state police's new policy, saying he was not informed of it and believed it was <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>thing</b> to do.

In accepting the skull, Colbung made comments that were interpreted as linking Yagan's death with the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, earlier that day: That is how nature goes... Nature is a carrier of all good things and all bad things. And because the Poms did <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>thing,</b> they now have to suffer. Colbung's comments prompted a media furore throughout Australia, with newspapers receiving many letters from the public expressing shock and anger at the comments. Colbung later claimed that his comments had been misinterpreted.|$|E
5|$|The series {{focuses on}} the adventures of the dark-haired Valérian, a spatio-temporal agent, and his redheaded female colleague, Laureline, as they travel the {{universe}} through space and time. Valérian is a classical hero, kind, strong and brave who follows the orders of his superiors even if he feels, deep down, that it is <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>thing</b> to do. On the other hand, his partner Laureline combines her superior intelligence, determination and independence with sex-appeal. Influenced by classic literary science fiction, the series mixes space opera with time travel plots. Christin's scripts are noted for their humour, complexity and strongly humanist and left-wing liberal political ideas while Mézières' art is characterized by its vivid depictions of the alien worlds and species Valérian and Laureline encounter on their adventures. The series is considered a landmark in European comics and pop culture, and influenced other media as well: traces of its concepts, storylines and designs {{can be found in}} science fiction films such as Star Wars and The Fifth Element.|$|E

5|$|In {{his paper}} The Schizophrenia of Modern Ethical Theories, philosopher Michael Stocker {{challenges}} Kantian ethics (and all modern ethical theories) {{by arguing that}} actions from duty lack certain moral value. He gives the example of Smith, who visits his friend in hospital out of duty, rather than because of the friendship; he argues that this visit seems morally lacking because it is motivated by <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>thing.</b> Marcia Baron has attempted to defend Kantian ethics on this point. After presenting {{a number of reasons}} that we might find acting out of duty objectionable, she argues that these problems only arise when people misconstrue what their duty is. Acting out of duty is not intrinsically wrong, but immoral consequences can occur when people misunderstand what they are duty-bound to do. Duty need not be seen as cold and impersonal: one may have a duty to cultivate their character or improve their personal relationships. Baron further argues that duty should be construed as a secondary motive—that is, a motive that regulates and sets conditions on what may be done, rather than prompt specific actions. She argues that, seen this way, duty neither reveals a deficiency in one's natural inclinations to act, nor undermines the motives and feelings that are essential to friendship. For Baron, being governed by duty does not mean that duty is always the primary motivation to act; rather, it entails that considerations of duty are always action-guiding. A responsible moral agent should take an interest in moral questions, such as questions of character. These should guide moral agents to act from duty.|$|E
25|$|Danforth and Hale summon Elizabeth {{and ask her}} {{to persuade}} John to confess. She is bitter towards Hale, both for doubting her earlier and for wanting John to give in and ruin his good name, but agrees to speak with her husband, if only to say goodbye. She and John have a lengthy discussion, during which she commends him for holding out and not confessing. John says he is refusing to confess not out of {{religious}} conviction but through contempt for his accusers and the court. The two finally reconcile, with Elizabeth forgiving John and saddened {{by the thought that}} he cannot forgive himself and see his own goodness. Knowing in his heart that it is <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>thing</b> for him to do, John agrees to falsely confess to engaging in witchcraft, deciding that he has no desire or right to be a martyr.|$|E

The {{evidence}} collected by the prosecution did not allow to establish a direct or indirect role of the accused in the crime. The Court concluded, however, that De Mauro most likely had been killed because he knew the secrets of Enrico Mattei's death, rather than the Borghese coup attempt. De Mauro’s disappearance and likely death {{remains one of the}} unsolved mysteries in Italian history.

[...] On his Keating Five experience, McCain has said: [...] "The appearance of it was wrong. It's a wrong appearance when a group of senators appear in a meeting with a group of regulators, because it conveys the impression of undue and improper influence.

The incident made Johnson want to exert his anger physically. Johnson later said, [...] "I lost something, a huge part of me....Fighting was my way of not dealing with my dad's passing.

To executive producers Mark Verheiden and Greg Beeman, making Ethan the villain in [...] "Suspect" [...] was the ultimate [...] "red herring" [...] for audiences. Sheriff Ethan was originally going to take a nurse hostage, but the ending was rewritten to leave Ethan as more of a sympathetic character. Mitchell prefers the filmed ending, as he could not see any reason why his character would suddenly become evil.

Later, she appeared as Rachel in the 2002 American comedy-drama film Igby Goes Down.

500|$|The Cubs hired Leo Durocher {{as manager}} in 1966, hoping he could inspire renewed {{interest}} in the team's fan base. Banks hit only 15 home runs; Cubs finished the 1966 season in last place with a 59–103 win-loss record, the worst season of Durocher's career. From the time Durocher arrived in Chicago, he was frustrated at his inability to trade or bench the aging Banks. In Durocher's autobiography, he says:... was a great player in his time. Unfortunately, his time wasn't my time. Even more unfortunately, {{there was not a}} thing I could do about it. He couldn't run, he couldn't field; toward the end, he couldn't even hit.

500|$|On September 14, 2008, Hochuli officiated a {{game between}} the San Diego Chargers and the Denver Broncos. He made an {{incorrect}} call with 1:17 left in the game, while Denver was in possession of the ball at the San Diego one-yard line and they were trailing the Chargers by seven points. On a second-down play, Denver quarterback Jay Cutler fumbled the ball, and it was recovered by San Diego linebacker Tim Dobbins. Ed Hochuli blew his whistle during the play, signaling that the play was dead and ruling an incomplete pass. Hochuli later wrote, [...] "Affecting {{the outcome of a}} game is a devastating feeling. Officials strive for perfection – I failed miserably." [...] The NFL passed a rule the following offseason allowing such plays to be reviewable under the instant replay rule for the 2009 NFL season. Speaking to Referee in November 2009, Hochuli told the magazine, [...] "It was really an easy play. I’ve thought many times why I did what I did. The best explanation is it was almost like dyslexia.

500|$|In the end, {{none of the}} {{senators}} was charged with any crime. Instead, the Senate Ethics Committee investigated them. [...] Robert S. Bennett, who was the special investigator for the committee, wanted to drop any action against McCain and Senator John Glenn, {{on the grounds of}} insufficient evidence, but the committee disagreed.

500|$|McCain became {{embroiled in}} a scandal during the 1980s, as one of five United States {{senators}} comprising the so-called Keating Five. Between 1982 and 1987, McCain had received $112,000 in lawful political contributions from Charles Keating Jr. and his associates at Lincoln Savings and Loan Association, along with trips on Keating's jets that McCain belatedly repaid, in 1989. In 1987, McCain {{was one of the}} five senators whom Keating contacted in order to prevent the government's seizure of Lincoln, and McCain met twice with federal regulators to discuss the government's investigation of Lincoln. In 1999, McCain said: [...] "The appearance of it was wrong.
