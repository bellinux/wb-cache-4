5|$|Green <b>today</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> {{commonly}} associated in Europe and the United States {{with love and}} sexuality, but in stories of the medieval period it sometimes represented love and the base, natural desires of man. It {{was the color of}} the serpent in the Garden of Eden who caused the downfall of Adam and Eve. However, for the troubadours, green was the color of growing love, and light green clothing was reserved for young women who were not yet married.|$|E
5|$|The name {{by which}} the series is known <b>today</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> Goya's own. His {{handwritten}} title on an album of proofs given to a friend reads: Fatal consequences of Spain's bloody war with Bonaparte, and other emphatic caprices (Spanish: Fatales consequencias de la sangrienta guerra en España con Buonaparte, Y otros caprichos enfáticos). Aside from the titles or captions given to each print, these are Goya's only known words on the series. With these works, he breaks {{from a number of}} painterly traditions. He rejects the bombastic heroics of most previous Spanish war art to show the effect of conflict on individuals. In addition he abandons colour in favour of a more direct truth he found in shadow and shade.|$|E

25|$|Jean Buridan (1300–58) was a French {{philosopher and}} priest. Although {{he was one}} of the most famous and {{influent}} philosophers of the late Middle Ages, his work <b>today</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> renowned by people other than philosophers and historians. One of his most significant contributions to science was the development of the theory of impetus, that explained the movement of projectiles and objects in free-fall. This theory gave way to the dynamics of Galileo Galilei and for Isaac Newton's famous principle of Inertia.|$|E

25|$|The {{original}} {{title of this}} pas was Les Aventures Amourouse de Diane or simply the Pas de Diane and was originally a pas de trois danced by Diana the Roman Goddess of the Hunt, Endymion the shepherd and a satyr, reflecting {{the myth of the}} passion between Diana and Endymion. It is believed that Petipa's inspiration for this pas was a painting by the Russian painter, Karl Bryullov. The traditional version that is danced <b>today</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> by Petipa, but by Agrippina Vaganova, who staged her own version of the Pas de Diane when she transferred it into a revival of La Esmeralda in 1935. She altered the scheme by removing the role of the satyr and changing the lead male role to the hunter, Actaeon, with whom Diana dances in the company of twelve of her nymphs. This was a very strange change on Vaganova's part since Diana and Actaeon were not lovers, but had one association when he stumbled upon her bathing naked with her nymphs, after which, she transformed him into a stag and he was hunted down and killed by his own hunting dogs.|$|E

[...] Several songs on Zappa's 1988 album Broadway the Hard Way ridicule Reagan, notably [...] "Promiscuous," [...] which jabs at the Reagans' attempts to reduce sex education in public schools and replace it with abstinence-only propaganda as well as his slow response to the AIDS pandemic.|$|E

However, the golden eagle, averaging [...] and [...] in wing chord length in its American race (A. c. canadensis), is merely [...] lighter in mean body mass and exceeds the bald eagle in mean wing chord length by around [...] Additionally, the bald eagle's close cousins, the relatively longer-winged but shorter-tailed white-tailed eagle and the overall larger Steller's sea eagle (H. pelagicus), may, rarely, wander to coastal Alaska from Asia.|$|E

500|$|Percheron, Boulonnais and Thoroughbred blood {{were also}} added, {{although}} they had little impact. In the 19th century, Belgian draft blood was added to give the breed the heavier conformation it has today. The extra weight and size was desired to turn the breed into a very heavy draft breed, after their role as an artillery horse had diminished through the advent of mechanization, {{as well as a}} desire for a meat animal. The breed increased in size from an average of [...] to their current weight, which at the same time had the consequence of reducing their vigor and endurance. Breed registries have been in existence since 1929. Today there are three separate studbooks in France, Belgium and Luxembourg, although there is extensive interbreeding between the three. The Ardennes Horse Society of Great Britain was also formed in the late 20th century to preserve and promote Ardennes horses in Great Britain, but <b>today</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> recognized as a studbook or passport issuing organization by the British government and may not exist in any form.|$|E

As David Frith pointed out, the nostalgia [...] "needed someone to put a perspective on it". In his 1939 autobiography, Fry wrote: [...] "I have a notion that the cricket of the nineties and early nineteen hundreds was more amusing to watch, but I am not at all sure that the game of <b>today</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> more difficult to play".|$|E
