5|$|The University Educational Trust (UET) is a 501 (c)(3) tax-exempt {{organization}} {{serving as}} a source of external fund-raising, funds-management and revenue-distribution at Cal Poly Pomona. With diminishing state support in recent years, the university has become not fully state-supported, but rather, state-assisted. UET oversees Cal Poly's endowment and generates resources with help of public and private partners to complement state-support and is recognized by the CSU Board of Trustees as a <b>Title</b> <b>V</b> auxiliary organization. It has a total capacity for up to 35 members and currently includes 4 officers, 18 community representatives, and 5 university representatives. The board of directors is composed of the university president who acts as an ex officio voting director and who appoints one ex officio executive director, one faculty member, one student member, and either the vice president for administrative affairs or the chief financial officer. All of the appointed voting directors serve one-, two-, or three-year terms and one-year terms thereafter, as determined by the university president. Other voting directors are elected by majority votes of present voting directors and serve three-year terms and may be re-elected for as many additional three-year terms as possible.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the most}} {{controversial}} aspects of the USA PATRIOT Act is in <b>title</b> <b>V,</b> and relates to National Security Letters (NSLs). An NSL is a form of administrative subpoena used by the FBI, and reportedly by other U.S. government agencies including the CIA and the Department of Defense (DoD). It is a demand letter issued to a particular entity or organization to turn over various records and data pertaining to individuals. They require no probable cause or judicial oversight and also contain a gag order, preventing the recipient of the letter from disclosing that the letter was ever issued. <b>Title</b> <b>V</b> allowed the use of NSLs to be made by a Special Agent in charge of a Bureau field office, where previously only the Director or the Deputy Assistant Director of the FBI were able to certify such requests.|$|E

25|$|FATCA was the revenue-raising {{portion of}} the 2010 {{domestic}} jobs stimulus bill, the Hiring Incentives to Restore Employment (HIRE) Act, and was enacted as Subtitle A (sections 501 through 541) of <b>Title</b> <b>V</b> of that law. FATCA is controversial because foreign banks {{have been forced to}} comply under threat of a 30% withholding penalty on all their U.S. transactions. The U.S. has yet to comply with FATCA itself, because as of 2017, it has not yet provided the promised reciprocity to its partner countries and it has failed to sign up to the Common Reporting Standard (CRS). FATCA has also been criticised for its impacts on Americans living overseas, and implicated in record-breaking numbers of U.S. citizenship renunciations throughout the 2010s. Bills to repeal FATCA have been introduced in the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives, citing its unconstitutionality, particularly its breach of 4th amendment rights, as well as its high implementation costs and lack of revenue generation. A hearing on the unintended consequences of FATCA was held by the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform on 26 April 2017.|$|E

2500|$|De Veau had further {{argued that}} the passage in 1959 of the Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act (LMRDA) also preempted the interstate compact. <b>Title</b> <b>V</b> of the LMRDA {{specifically}} imposed restrictions on union officers, clearly preempting any state action in this area, De Veau said. [...] The majority disagreed. [...] Passage of <b>Title</b> <b>V</b> of the LMRDA, Frankfurter wrote, shows just the opposite—that Congress did not find state restrictions {{on the right to}} hold union office incompatible with pre-1959 federal labor policies. Furthermore, Frunkfurter interpreted Section 504(a) and Section 603(a) of the LMRDA as specifically disclaiming of preemption of state laws regulating union officials (which only a few, limited, express exceptions).|$|E
