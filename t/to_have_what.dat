5|$|Computer science {{concerns}} {{itself with}} the automatic processing of information (or at least with physical systems of symbols to which information is assigned) by means of such things as computers. From the beginning, computer programmers {{have been able to}} develop programs that permit computers to carry out tasks for which organic beings need a mind. A simple example is multiplication. It is not clear whether computers could be said to have a mind. Could they, someday, come <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>what</b> we call a mind? This question has been propelled into the forefront of much philosophical debate because of investigations in the field of artificial intelligence (AI).|$|E

What I do see is a historical coming together of forces, and the sixties changed how human beings endured things in this society and what they refused to endure... Certainly something special happened on that night in 1969, and we've made it more special in our need <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>what</b> I call a point of origin... it's more complex than saying that {{it all started with}} Stonewall.|$|E

These SBNRs find their {{constant}} search for novel spiritual practices to be a byproduct of their [...] "unsatisfied curiosity", their desire for journey and change, as well as feelings of disappointment. Explorers are best understood as [...] "spiritual tourists" [...] who take comfort in the destination-less journey of their spirituality and have no intentions of ultimately committing to a spiritual home.|$|E
2500|$|Pietersen {{was born}} to an English mother, Penny, and an Afrikaner father, Jannie. Pietersen had a strict and well-disciplined childhood, along with his three {{brothers}} Tony, Greg and Bryan; he learned valuable lessons from this [...] "fantastic" [...] approach to parenting, and said: [...] "Discipline is good. It taught me that I didn't always have <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>what</b> I wanted; that what I needed was different from what I wanted." [...] Bryan plays club and second XI cricket in England.|$|E
2500|$|As well as altars in the {{structural}} sense, it became customary in the West <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>what</b> in Latin {{were referred to}} as altaria portatilia (portable altars), more commonly referred to in English as [...] "altar stones". When travelling, a priest could take one with him {{and place it on}} an ordinary table for saying Mass. They were also inserted into the centre of structural altars especially those made of wood. In that case, it was the altar stone that was considered liturgically to be the altar. The Pontificale Romanum contained a rite for blessing at the same time several of these altar stones. In the East the antimension served and continues to serve the same purpose.|$|E

2500|$|Many reformers – Galbraith is {{not alone}} in this – have as their basic {{objection}} to a free market that it frustrates them in achieving their reforms, because it enables people <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>what</b> they want, not what the reformers want. Hence every reformer has a strong tendency to be averse to a free market.Nobel Prize-winning economist Robert Solow, in a review of The New Industrial State, points at Galbraith's lack for empiricism and selectiveness in the his use of evidence. He points out that [...] "It may be unjust and pointless to consider the degree of literal truth of each of the assertions that make up this argument. One would hardly discuss Gulliver's Travels by debating whether there really are any little people, or criticize the Grande Jatte because objects aren't made up of tiny dots. Nevertheless, it may help to judge the truth of Galbraith's." ...|$|E
2500|$|Microkernel (also {{abbreviated}} μK or uK) is {{the term}} describing an approach to operating system design by which the functionality {{of the system is}} moved out of the traditional [...] "kernel", into a set of [...] "servers" [...] that communicate through a [...] "minimal" [...] kernel, leaving as little as possible in [...] "system space" [...] and as much as possible in [...] "user space". A microkernel that is designed for a specific platform or device is only ever going <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>what</b> it needs to operate. The microkernel approach consists of defining a simple abstraction over the hardware, with a set of primitives or system calls to implement minimal OS services such as memory management, multitasking, and inter-process communication. Other services, including those normally provided by the kernel, such as networking, are implemented in user-space programs, referred to as servers. Microkernels are easier to maintain than monolithic kernels, but the large number of system calls and context switches might slow down the system because they typically generate more overhead than plain function calls.|$|E
2500|$|In December1941, Puyi {{followed}} Japan in declaring {{war on the}} United States and Great Britain, but as neither {{nation had}} recognized Manchukuo there were no reciprocal declarations of war in return. During the war, Puyi was an example and role model {{for at least some}} in Asia who believed in the Japanese Pan-Asian propaganda. U Saw, the Prime Minister of Burma, was secretly in communication with the Japanese, declaring that as an Asian his sympathies were completely with Japan against the West. USaw further added that he hoped that when Japan won the war that he would enjoy exactly the same status in Burma that Puyi enjoyed in Manchukuo as part of the Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere, saying that as an Asian it was his fondest wish that Japan would do everything that it had done in Manchukuo in Burma. The American historian Gerhard Weinberg sarcastically wrote that USaw and the rest of Barmar nationalists who saw the Japanese as liberators from the British were not endowed with [...] "great intelligence" [...] as USaw enjoyed far more power as Prime Minister under the British than Puyi did as Emperor under the Japanese, but they got their wish <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>what</b> was done to people of Manchukuo done to their own people, observing: [...] "The use of military and civilian prisoners for bayonet practice and assorted other cruelties provided the people of Southeast Asia with a dramatic lesson on the new meaning of Bushido, the code of the Japanese warrior." ...|$|E

2500|$|Sonnet 64 is {{very similar}} to Shakespeare's Sonnet 60 where both sonnets focus on a central idolizing of [...] "time as the destroyer". In Helen Vendler's, The Art of Shakespeare's Sonnets, Vendler {{describes}} Sonnet 64 to be written in a state of horror and [...] "unprotected vulnerability". The speaker's horror is manifested in the line, Increasing store with loss, and loss with store. Vendler argues that in this line [...] "Loss wins in both cases. It is of course impossible to increase abundance with loss, and equally impossible to increase loss by adding abundance to it." [...] Atkins is also in agreement that sonnet 64 especially in line 12, the speaker expresses a state of fear: That Time will come and take my love away. In [...] "Shakespeare's Sonnets" [...] Atkins argues the meaning of this line is clear that [...] "after seeing all these other ruins, I think about your eventual ruin". Vendler calls line 12 a [...] "collapse into monosyllabic truth", [...] "and its dismayed adolescent simplicity of rhythm, this line feels like a death." [...] Booth claims that in line 13 is unclear: [...] "death, the nearest potential antecedent, cannot choose, but it cannot weep or fear either; thought makes better sense, but it is the thinker who does the weeping and fearing." [...] Vendler argues that in the last three lines of the sonnet a [...] "'natural' pattern of unreversed ruin 'defeats' the intellectual mastery-by-chiasmus, as the concept of gradual leakage comes to represent personal loss. Time takes love away, a thought is like a death, one weeps <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>what</b> one fears to lose.... Having while fearing to lose is already a form of losing." [...] Overall, both Booth and Vendler agree in the last three lines of the sonnet the speaker weeps at the fear of losing his love, ultimately realizing that he cannot escape time and time will come and take his love away.|$|E
