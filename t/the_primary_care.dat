5|$|There are {{different}} {{opinions on the}} significance of these principles. Some note that the osteopathic medical philosophy is akin to the tenets of holistic medicine, suggestive of a kind of social movement within the field of medicine, one that promotes a more patient-centered, holistic approach to medicine, and emphasizes the role of <b>the</b> <b>primary</b> <b>care</b> physician within the health care system. Others point out that {{there is nothing in the}} principles that would distinguish D.O. from M.D. training in any fundamental way. One study, published in The Journal of the American Osteopathic Association found a majority of M.D. medical school administrators and faculty saw nothing objectionable in the core principles listed above, and some endorse them generally as broad medical principles.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, recent studies show an {{increasingly}} positive attitude {{of patients and}} physicians (M.D. and D.O.) towards the use of manual therapy as a valid, safe and effective treatment modality. One survey, published in the Journal of Continuing Medical Education, found {{that a majority of}} physicians (81%) and patients (76%) felt that manual manipulation (MM) was safe, and over half (56% of physicians and 59% of patients) felt that manipulation should be available in <b>the</b> <b>primary</b> <b>care</b> setting. Although less than half (40%) of the physicians reported any educational exposure to MM and less than one-quarter (20%) have administered MM in their practice, most (71%) respondents endorsed desiring more instruction in MM. Another small study examined the interest and ability of M.D. residents in learning osteopathic principles and skills, including OMT. It showed that after a 1-month elective rotation, the M.D. residents responded favorably to the experience.|$|E

5|$|In the Soviet times, mental {{hospitals}} were frequently created in former monasteries, barracks, and even concentration camps. Sofia Dorinskaya, {{a human rights}} activist and psychiatrist, says she saw former convicts who {{have been living in}} a Russian mental hospital for ten years and will have been staying there until their dying day because of having no home. Deinstitutionalization has not touched many of the hospitals, and persons still die inside them. In 2013, 70 persons died in a fire just outside Novgorod and Moscow. Living conditions are often insufficient and sometimes horrible: 12 to 15 patients in a big room with bars on the windows, no bedside tables, often no partitions, not enough toilets. The number of outpatient clinics designed for <b>the</b> <b>primary</b> <b>care</b> of the mentally disordered stopped increasing in 2005 and was reduced to 277 in 2012 as against 318 in 2005. Stigma linked to mental disease is at the level of xenophobia. The Russian public perceive the mentally sick as harmful, useless, incurable, and dangerous. The social stigma is maintained not only by the general public but also by psychiatrists.|$|E
5|$|Registered Nurses: Registered {{nurses are}} {{responsible}} for coordinating {{all aspects of the}} patient's care and insuring symptoms (physical or otherwise) are being addressed and managed. <b>The</b> <b>primary</b> <b>care</b> nurse visits a minimum of twice weekly, and the content of the visit can vary greatly. When patients are experiencing few symptoms and/or are early in their diseases, the RN visit may just be a short check up. If a patient's symptoms worsen, the nurse will visit more often, make recommendations for increasing or changing the medication intervention and provide support and education regarding the disease/dying process. Many patients on hospice may require complex treatments: respiratory care, wound care or even IV therapy at home. In most cases, the hospice nurse is trained to handle these unique needs as well.|$|E

40|$|While {{the vision}} for {{restructuring}} {{health care in}} South Africa {{is based on a}} comprehensive <b>primary</b> health <b>care</b> system, <b>care</b> at <b>the</b> <b>primary</b> level remains largely biomedical in orientation. Given this, I argue that whilst adding mental health <b>care</b> to <b>primary</b> level <b>care</b> may increase accessibility of psychiatric care, it will not, however, provide for comprehensive integrated <b>primary</b> mental health <b>care</b> as planned. This would require a paradigm shift towards a comprehensive discourse of care which includes mental health care. While efforts towards reorienting health care personnel in South Africa towards <b>the</b> <b>primary</b> health <b>care</b> approach have been initiated, an examination of <b>the</b> <b>primary</b> health <b>care</b> system in one sub-district in South Africa, reveals that the delivery of biomedical care is sustained by a number of factors within <b>the</b> <b>primary</b> health <b>care</b> system as well as within the macro-context. A shift in the paradigm of care provided would therefore require the transformation of the system on many fronts. Of central importance would be the restructuring of <b>the</b> <b>primary</b> health <b>care</b> system to be supportive of emotional labour, health promotion, empowerment of service users and of care which takes the subjectivity of the illness experience for the patient into account.
