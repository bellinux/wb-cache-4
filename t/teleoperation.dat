25|$|Animatronics is a multi-disciplinary field which {{integrates}} anatomy, robots, mechatronics, and puppetry {{resulting in}} lifelike animation. Animatronic figures are often powered by pneumatics, hydraulics, and/or by electrical means, {{and can be}} implemented using both computer control and human control, including <b>teleoperation.</b> Motion actuators are often used to imitate muscle movements and create realistic motions in limbs. Figures are covered with body shells and flexible skins made of hard and soft plastic materials and finished with details like colors, hair and feathers and other components to make the figure more life like.|$|E
40|$|Ground {{controlled}} <b>teleoperations</b> {{are expected}} to be used to augment Space Station manned extravehicular activities (EVA) and Intravehicular activities (IVA). However, ground controlled <b>teleoperations</b> will encounter communications time delays of from 3 to 8 secs. Time delays greater than 1 sec {{have been shown to be}} detrimental to safe and efficient <b>teleoperations.</b> Therefore, concepts must be developed to overcome the hazards and limitations of time delays when performing <b>teleoperations</b> using robots. The concept for robot motion primitives incorporate force/torque and tactile sensor feedback to implement the degree of autonomy required for interactive, ground controlled telerobotics. Several primitives are studied that augment human initiated actions by providing rapid response interaction with the physical environment of a telerobot. These primitives are detailed. They constitute a level of intelligent sensing and reaction required to augment human actions through autonomous interaction with the physical environment...|$|R
40|$|The {{question}} of how computer assists can improve teleoperator trajectory tracking during both free and force-constrained motions is addressed. Computer graphics techniques which enable the human operator to both visualize and predict detailed 3 D trajectories in real-time are reported. Man-machine interactive control procedures for better management of manipulator contact forces and positioning are also described. It is found that collectively, these novel advanced <b>teleoperations</b> techniques both enhance system performance and significantly reduce control problems long associated with <b>teleoperations</b> under time delay.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} human control {{performance by}} means of a telemanipulation system and measurements of muscular activity during <b>teleoperations.</b> The task is performed with the aid of different types of interfaces. The control loop of a telerobotic manipulation system includes the human motion program. The control strategy for human motion is closely dependent on the type of interface available, that is, on the way the performance knowledge is presented to the operator. The analysis here proposed concerns the sensory and logical evaluation of this dependence in a telerobotic application, {{by means of}} EMG signal acquisition during <b>teleoperations</b> both in real and virtual environments. The experiments have been performed with a new paradigm for the evaluation of human feedback during the telemanipulation performance of a touch task...|$|R

40|$|NASA {{has been}} {{analyzing}} {{a number of}} mission concepts and activities that involve low-latency telerobotic (LLT) operations. One mission concept that will be covered in this presentation is Crew-Assisted Sample Return which involves the crew acquiring samples (1) {{that have already been}} delivered to space, and or acquiring samples via LLT from orbit to a planetary surface and then launching the samples to space to be captured in space and then returned to the earth with the crew.
