40|$|Despite current media {{reporting}} that assumes <b>new</b> <b>orders</b> for durable goods (NDOG) are {{an indicator of}} future economic activity, <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>orders</b> series does not improve forecasts of durable goods shipments. This result is true for both aggregate and industry-level measures of <b>new</b> <b>orders,</b> using several econometric techniques. <b>New</b> <b>orders</b> {{may have been a}} more useful measure of future shipments in the 1960 s than today. This failure may be caused by changes in manufacturing methods. In addition, the structure of the economy may have made <b>new</b> <b>orders</b> less relevant. Also, <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>orders</b> series may suffer from measurement problems. Moreover, parameter uncertainty and instability may overwhelm any available information in <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>orders</b> series. Analysts should consider reducing the emphasis placed on NDOG as a measure of future economic activity. ...|$|R

In their judgment, issued on 22 October 2008, the Lords decided by a 3-2 majority to uphold <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>Order</b> in Council, stating that it was valid and, although judicial review actions could look at Orders in Council, the national security and foreign relations issues in the case barred them from doing so. In addition, Cook's statement had not been clear and unambiguous enough to provide legitimate expectation.|$|E
5|$|Wolfenstein: <b>The</b> <b>New</b> <b>Order</b> is an action-adventure and first-person shooter {{video game}} played from a first-person perspective. To {{progress}} through the story, players battle enemies throughout levels. The game utilizes a health system in which players' health is divided into separate sections that regenerate; if an entire section is lost, players must use a health pack to replenish the missing health.|$|E
5|$|Wolfenstein: <b>The</b> <b>New</b> <b>Order</b> was {{released}} to mostly positive reviews. Metacritic calculated an average score of 81 out of 100 based on 23 reviews for the Windows version, 79 out of 100 based on 18 reviews for the Xbox One version and 73 reviews for the PlayStation 4 version. Reviewers liked the game's concept, narrative and combat mechanics.|$|E

5|$|A {{military}} operation {{plan for the}} invasion of Ireland in support of Operation Sea Lion was drawn up by the Germans in August 1940. Occupied Ireland was to be ruled along with Britain in a temporary administrative system divided into six military-economic commands, {{with one of the}} headquarters being situated in Dublin. Ireland's future position in <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Order</b> is unclear, but it is known that Hitler would have united Ulster with the Irish state.|$|E
5|$|After {{developer}} MachineGames was founded, {{the employees}} all began brainstorming ideas, and pitching them to publishers. In June 2009, MachineGames owner ZeniMax Media acquired id Software {{and all of}} its property, including Doom, Quake and Wolfenstein. Bethesda Softworks, who had previously declined a pitch from MachineGames, suggested that they develop a new game from a franchise acquired by ZeniMax. MachineGames inquired about developing a new game in the Wolfenstein series; the studio visited id Software, who approved of MachineGames' request for a new Wolfenstein game. By November 2010, paperwork was signed, allowing MachineGames to develop Wolfenstein: <b>The</b> <b>New</b> <b>Order.</b> Preliminary development lasted approximately three years.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1984 <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Order</b> {{government}} used Pengkhianatan G30S/PKI as {{a propaganda}} vehicle, showing it annually on 30 September. The film was broadcast by the state-owned network TVRI, {{and later on}} private television stations after they were established. It was also shown at schools and government institutions; students would be taken to open fields to view the film in a group. Because of this use, Sen and Hill suggest that Pengkhianatan G30S/PKI is the most-broadcast and most-watched Indonesian film of all time. A 2000 survey by the Indonesian magazine Tempo found 97percent of the 1,101 students surveyed had seen the film; 87percent of them had seen it more than once.|$|E

5000|$|When <b>The</b> <b>New</b> <b>Order's</b> first singer Jeff Spry {{was forced}} to quit the band (due to jail time {{incurred}} from a drinking/quaalude related DUI coupled with failure to perform community service), <b>The</b> <b>New</b> <b>Order's</b> first drummer, K.J. Knight, recommended Dave Gilbert as a replacement. K.J. and Gilbert had both been veterans of the 1971/1972 incarnations of Ted Nugent's Amboy Dukes. After keyboardist Scott Thurston quit, his position was filled by a second guitarist, Ray Gunn, another Detroit veteran who was recommended by Dennis Thompson.|$|R
5|$|Development {{began in}} 2010, soon after id Software gave MachineGames the {{rights for the}} franchise. The {{development}} team envisioned Wolfenstein: <b>The</b> <b>New</b> <b>Order</b> as a first-person action-adventure game, taking inspiration from previous games in the series and particularly focusing on the combat and adventure elements. The game attempts to delve into character development of Blazkowicz, unlike its predecessors—a choice from the developers to interest players in the story. They also aimed to portray him in a heroic fashion.|$|E
5|$|Production of Pengkhianatan G30S/PKI, {{originally}} titled Sejarah Orde Baru (History of <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Order),</b> {{took nearly}} two years, spending {{four months in}} pre-production and a year and half in filming. It cost Rp.800million, receiving funding from the government. Cinematography was handled by Hasan Basri, with music by Arifin's brother Embie C. Noer. Editing was done by Supandi. Parts of the film, particularly the final ten minutes, reused archival footage and newspaper clippings contemporaneous to the events.|$|E
5|$|Results {{showed that}} Golkar, the former ruling party of <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Order</b> era led by People's Representative Council Speaker Akbar Tanjung, {{had won the}} largest number of seats, {{defeating}} President Megawati Sukarnoputri's Indonesian Democratic Party – Struggle (PDI–P). Golkar received more votes than other parties in twenty-six out of thirty-two provinces. However, these results occurred because of declining PDI–P popularity rather than an increase in Golkar's popularity. Golkar's support in its traditional stronghold of Sulawesi declined due to the performance of medium and small parties in the region. Despite winning the largest share of vote once again in Bali, PDI–P performance there suffered the greatest after the 2002 bombings by terrorist group Jemaah Islamiyah devastated the island province's economy.|$|E

5|$|Stephen was a well {{established}} figure in Anglo-Norman society by 1135. He was extremely wealthy, well-mannered and liked by his peers; {{he was also}} considered a man capable of firm action. Chroniclers recorded that despite his wealth and power he was a modest and easy-going leader, happy to sit with his men and servants, casually laughing and eating with them. He was very pious, {{both in terms of}} his observance of religious rituals and his personal generosity to the church. Stephen also had a personal Augustinian confessor appointed to him by the Archbishop of Canterbury, who implemented a penitential regime for him, and Stephen encouraged <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>order</b> of Cistercians to form abbeys on his estates, winning him additional allies within the church.|$|E
5|$|The first commercially {{released}} domestic {{feature film}} {{to deal with}} the events of 1965, Pengkhianatan G30S/PKI was a commercial and critical success. It was nominated for seven awards at the 1984 Indonesian Film Festival, winning one, and reached record viewership numbers– although in many cases audiences were required to see the film. The film was used as a propaganda vehicle by <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Order</b> government until its collapse; televised annually on 30 September and became mandatory viewing for students. Since the fall of Suharto in 1998, such use of the film has become less common. Although the film's artistic aspects remain well-received, its misrepresentation of history has been criticised.|$|E
5|$|The five Gefion {{passages}} seem {{to highlight}} the championing of a new order antagonistic to goddess worship. In light of {{what appears to be}} an elaborate thematic statement about patrilineage in the poem, <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>order</b> may also have entailed a change in kinship systems. Grendel and his mother may stand as types of earlier, matrilineal tribes. Further the hall which is the object of struggle between Beowulf and the first two monsters may symbolize the consolidation of new hierarchical social organization among the northern Germanic peoples.|$|E

5|$|The second {{adaptation}} of the Ronggeng Dukuh Paruk trilogy, Sang Penari required two years of research to better present the historical context, including the 30 September Movement and ensuing anti-communist actions; these details, censored in the original trilogy by <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Order</b> government, were more explicit than in the novels. Although the film was set and shot in Purwokerto, Central Java, neither of the leads was ethnic Javanese. Nasution, cast in her debut role, is Batak, while Antara is Balinese.|$|E
5|$|With {{a lack of}} {{domestic}} capital that was required for economic growth, <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Order</b> reversed Sukarno's economic self-sufficiency policies and opened selected economic sectors {{of the country to}} foreign investment though the 1967 Foreign Investment Law. Suharto travelled to Western Europe and Japan to promote investment in Indonesia. The first foreign investors to re-enter Indonesia included mining companies Freeport Sulphur Company / International Nickel Company. Following government regulatory frameworks, domestic entrepreneurs (mostly Chinese-Indonesians) emerged in the late 1960s and early 1970s in the import-substitution light-manufacturing sector such as Astra Group and Salim Group.|$|E
5|$|With the {{commencement}} of <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Order</b> in 1965, Indonesia's economy developed and opened to foreign investment. In Toraja, a coffee plantation and factory was established by Key Coffee of Japan, and Torajan coffee regained a reputation for quality within the growing international specialty coffee sector Multinational oil and mining companies opened new operations in Indonesia during the 1970s and 1980s. Torajans, particularly younger ones, relocated {{to work for the}} foreign companies—to Kalimantan for timber and oil, to Papua for mining, to the cities of Sulawesi and Java, and many went to Malaysia. The out-migration of Torajans was steady until 1985. and has continued since, with remittances sent back by emigre Torajans performing an important role within the contemporary economy.|$|E
