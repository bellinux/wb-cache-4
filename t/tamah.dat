50|$|The tumdak is a hand-struck double-headed membranophone of the Santal {{people of}} India. The Santal {{typically}} use the Tumdak {{in combination with}} the <b>Tamah</b> for religious ceremonies and Santal festivals. Both drums are almost universally played by men rather than women. The body of the drum is cylindrical and made from clay. The two heads of the drum are usually cowhide, the right one being slightly smaller than the left. Like many similar Indian drums, each head has a round patch of tuning paste in the center which enhances the sound. When played for dancing, the Tumdah player suspends the drum around his neck with a cord or leather strap. The Tumdah falls within the larger category of double-headed hand-struck Indian drums, which have various names: Dholak, Nal, Mridangam. The player strikes the Tumdak with full hand and fingers as required by the musical pattern. The rhythm of the Tamak and Tumdak set the basic metric/rhythmic pattern for Santal dances and are essential for traditional Santal music.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to connect local {{prospects}} with global processes by considering these as dynamic cyclical co-movements allowing grassroots-movements to create. My approach is three-fold. First, it is my aim to compare spiritual knowledge with scientific knowledge as an alternative way to explain globalization and creation. Secondly, I seek to explore different scale-making projects of the grassroots-movement as motive to create and to provide a better understanding of global processes. Lastly, I attempt to find the logic behind ‘grassroots globalization’. To denote on the cyclical co-movements in each chapter, I will discuss the three dynamic forces Sattva, Rajah, <b>Tamah,</b> which are focused on each outlined chapter. According to Ananda Marga these three forces are essential for procreation and movement...|$|E
