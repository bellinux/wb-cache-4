5|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, the French Army began {{to accept the}} new Leclerc main battle <b>tank</b> <b>to</b> replace the antiquated AMX-30. The first units to be {{outfitted}} with the new tank were the 501st and 503rd tank regiments, followed by the 6th and 12th Cuirassier Regiments.|$|E
5|$|The Lone Gunmen {{find that}} Wormus had been {{receiving}} data from Roland McFarland, the drowned reclamation worker. Doggett breaks into McFarland's office with Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) and finds files on chloramine, a mutation-inducing chemical, but Follmer arrives. Doggett slips into a filtration <b>tank</b> <b>to</b> hide, but is pulled deep underwater by McMahon.|$|E
5|$|While {{the force}} {{waited for the}} rest of the {{division}} to land, and for the 7th Parachute Battalion to arrive to reinforce their position, they had to repel several spontaneous attempts by the Germans to re-take the bridges.

5|$|Arriving in 1986, {{the crew}} finds their ship's power drained. Hiding their ship in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park using its {{cloaking}} device, the crew split up to accomplish several tasks: Admiral James T. Kirk and Spock attempt to locate humpback whales, while Montgomery Scott, Leonard McCoy, and Hikaru Sulu construct a <b>tank</b> <b>to</b> hold the whales {{they need for}} a return to the 23rd century. Uhura and Pavel Chekov are tasked to find a nuclear reactor, whose energy leakage will enable their ship's power to be restored.|$|E
5|$|On 10 April, Rane got {{up early}} and resumed work on an {{obstacle}} {{that had not been}} cleared the previous night. Within a span of two hours, he cleared the roadblock of five large pine trees in the midst of mines and machine-gun fire. This allowed the 4th Dogra Battalion to advance another thirteen kilometers until it encountered another major roadblock. The Pakistani forces were situated on the adjoining hills and able to fire on all approaches to the block, making its destruction problematic. Rane drove a <b>tank</b> <b>to</b> the roadblock and took cover behind the tank while blasting open the roadblock with mines, opening the road {{before the end of the}} night.|$|E
5|$|The Panzer IV saw {{service in}} all combat theaters {{involving}} Germany {{and was the}} only German <b>tank</b> <b>to</b> remain in continuous production throughout the war. Upgrades and design modifications, intended to counter new threats, extended its service life. Generally, these involved increasing the Panzer IV's armor protection or upgrading its weapons, although during {{the last months of}} the war, with Germany's pressing need for rapid replacement of losses, design changes also included simplifications to speed up the manufacturing process.|$|E

5|$|The Panzer IV was {{the only}} German <b>tank</b> <b>to</b> remain in both {{production}} and combat throughout World War II, and measured over the entire war it comprised 30% of the Wehrmacht's total tank strength. Although in service by early 1939, {{in time for the}} occupation of Czechoslovakia, {{at the start of the}} war the majority of German armor was made up of obsolete Panzer Is and Panzer IIs. The Panzer I in particular had already proved inferior to Soviet tanks, such as the T-26, during the Spanish Civil War.|$|E
5|$|The {{first and}} second stages of the Black Arrow were fuelled by RP-1 {{paraffin}} (kerosene), burnt using high test peroxide as an oxidiser. Due to the optimum mixture ratio being about 7, a larger oxidiser tank was required compared to many contemporary launch systems. The oxidiser tanks were located below the fuel tanks, following the practice of putting the more dense propellent at bottom in order to lower the centre of gravity and make the rocket easier to control. This arrangement had been pioneered by Germany and the United States, whereas the Soviet Union had placed oxidiser tanks above fuel tanks, {{making it easier for}} the lower <b>tank</b> <b>to</b> be filled first.|$|E
5|$|The {{girls and}} the Rippers sneak into W, {{where they are}} ambushed. Kesslee, whose body had been reconstructed by the cybernetic surgeon Che'tsai (James Hong), reveals that Tank Girl has unknowingly been bugged. Deetee is killed. While the Rippers turn the tide of the battle, Jet Girl kills Sergeant Small (Don Harvey), who had earlier sexually harassed her. Kesslee reveals that Sam is in the pipe, her life {{endangered}} by rising water. Tank Girl uses her <b>tank</b> <b>to</b> kill Kesslee, then pulls Sam out of the pipe. The film ends with an animated sequence showing water starting to flow freely. Tank Girl drives down rapids, pulling Booga behind on water-skis, then takes them over a waterfall, shouting for joy.|$|E

They are now upgrading the Type 59 <b>tanks</b> <b>to</b> Type 59G Durjoy standard. To increase the mobility of the infantry forces, many Armoured personnel carriers such as BTR-80, Otokar Cobra and BOV M11 have been procured.|$|R
5|$|The {{program was}} headed by major Félix Verdeja Bardales {{and led to}} the {{development}} of four prototype vehicles, including a self-propelled howitzer armed with a 75millimeter (3in) gun. It was designed as an advanced light tank and was one of the first development programs which took into account survivability of the crew as opposed to the protection of the tank itself. The tank was influenced by several of the light tanks which it was intended to replace, including the Panzer I and T-26, both of which were originally used during the Spanish Civil War. The Verdeja was considered a superior <b>tank</b> <b>to</b> the T-26 after a lengthy testing period, yet was never put into mass production.|$|E
5|$|The rocket {{lands in}} the Hipparchus Crater, with Tintin being the first human {{to step on the}} Moon. Three days later, Haddock, Wolff and Tintin take the {{battery-powered}} <b>tank</b> <b>to</b> explore some stalactite caves {{in the direction of the}} Ptolemaeus Crater; inside a cave Snowy slips into an ice-covered chasm, but Tintin rescues him. Later aboard the ship, Tintin is overwhelmed by a third stowaway, Colonel Jorgen, a spy who had been smuggled aboard by Wolff, who has been blackmailed by a foreign power for which Jorgen works. With Wolff's help, Jorgen seeks to hijack the ship and return it to Earth, but is foiled by Tintin through emergency sabotage that cuts power to the engine.|$|E
5|$|A second variant on the Tetrarch {{design was}} the Tetrarch Duplex Drive ("Tetrarch DD"). The Duplex Drive system {{was invented by}} Nicholas Straussler, and was {{designed}} to allow a <b>tank</b> <b>to</b> 'swim' through water and participate in amphibious operations. The system functioned by erecting a large waterproof canvas screen around the tank above its tracks, which was supported by thirty-six inflatable tubes and steel struts; this gave the tank sufficient buoyancy to float, and was then propelled along by a small propeller powered by the tank's engine. The screen could be collapsed by using a small explosive charge once the tank reached land. The system was fitted during June 1941, as the Tetrarch was the lightest light tank available at the time; the converted tank was successfully tested {{on a number of}} lakes and reservoirs, allowing the Duplex Drive system to be tested on heavier tanks, such as the Valentine. The system would be used during Operation Overlord, when M4 Sherman medium tanks would land on the invasion beaches.|$|E

5|$|Design of the PanzerI {{began in}} 1932 and mass {{production}} began in 1934. Intended {{only as a}} training <b>tank</b> <b>to</b> introduce the concept of armored warfare to the German Army, the PanzerI saw combat in Spain during the Spanish Civil War, in Poland, France, the Soviet Union and North Africa during the Second World War, and in China during the Second Sino-Japanese War. Experiences with the PanzerI during the Spanish Civil War helped shape the German Panzerwaffes' invasion of Poland in 1939 and France in 1940. By 1941, the PanzerI chassis design {{was used as the}} basis of tank destroyers and assault guns. There were attempts to upgrade the PanzerI throughout its service history, including by foreign nations, to extend the design's lifespan. It continued to serve in the Spanish Armed Forces until 1954.|$|E
5|$|During 1973, B Squadron, 1st Armoured Regiment—designated the Medium Tank Trials Unit (MTTU)—evaluated the German Leopard 1 {{against the}} American M60A1 Patton as a {{replacement}} for the obsolete Centurions. The Leopard was judged the superior tank, and 90 gun tanks, eight Leopard 1 Armoured Recovery Vehicles Medium and five Leopard 1 bridge layer tanks were ordered. The Australian tanks were designated the Leopard AS1, and were based on the Leopard 1A3 which had been built for the German Army. The main difference between the Australian and German tanks was the inclusion of a SABCA fire control system, equipment to allow the <b>tank</b> <b>to</b> better operate in the tropics, additional storage boxes {{on the sides of the}} tank as well as improved trunnion bearings and combustion cleaners. These tanks were delivered to Australia in batches between 1976 and 1978. During the Leopard's service very little in the way of upgrades were undertaken, and by the 1990s they had become obsolete.|$|E
5|$|Rejecting {{this turn}} of events, Rin travels {{back into the}} {{artificial}} world again (this time created by Riki and Rin) and helps Riki overcome his weakness. Afterwards, {{the two of them}} go back to waking up at the crash site. This time, Riki and Rin work together to save everyone at the crash scene. Kyousuke, who sneaked onto the bus (as a third year he was not allowed to go), managed to block the leak hole on the gas <b>tank</b> <b>to</b> delay the explosion, despite his injuries being far greater than anyone else. Everyone in the bus recovers from their injuries, although Kyousuke's recovery takes longer due to extensive injuries. Finally, after Kyousuke returns, he rents a minibus, {{and the members of the}} Little Busters set out for a trip to the ocean.|$|E
