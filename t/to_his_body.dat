5|$|As Bryan spoke {{his final}} sentence, recalling the Crucifixion of Jesus, {{he placed his}} hands to his temples, fingers {{extended}}; with the final words, he extended his arms to his sides straight out <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>body</b> and held that pose for about five seconds as if offering himself as sacrifice for the cause, as the audience watched in dead silence. He then lowered them, descended from the podium, and began to head back to his seat as the stillness held.|$|E

5|$|Harry learns from Snape's memories, {{that while}} Snape despised Harry's late father, James, who had bullied him, {{he loved his}} late mother, Lily. Following her death, Snape worked {{secretly}} with Dumbledore to protect Harry from Voldemort because of his love for Lily. Harry also learns Dumbledore was dying and wanted Snape to kill him, and that the Patronus doe {{he saw in the}} woods that led him to the sword had been conjured by Snape.

5|$|However, Osborn had {{no control}} over his Super-Adaptoid abilities; he would {{automatically}} absorb the powers of any superhuman he touched, even if he did not consciously want to. He was also limited in how many powers his body could hold, as the A.I.M. scientists warned him that absorbing too many powers at once could overload his systems. In the end, he inadvertently absorbed the abilities of all the Avengers and New Avengers when they all touched him at once, and the unstable combination of their multiple different powers caused significant damage <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>body</b> chemistry, resulting in him going into a coma. After he regained consciousness, these powers were apparently burnt out, returning him to his Goblin-level strength instead.|$|E
5|$|Nevill {{was found}} in the kitchen, dressed in pyjamas, lying over an {{overturned}} chair next to the fireplace, amid a scene suggestive of a struggle. He had been shot eight times, six times to the head and face, fired when the rifle was a few inches from his skin. The remaining shots <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>body</b> had occurred from at least two feet away. Based on where the empty cartridges were found—three in the kitchen and one on the stairs—the police concluded that he had been shot four times upstairs, but had managed to get downstairs where a struggle took place, and during which he was hit several times with the rifle and shot again, this time fatally.|$|E

25|$|On 12 August 2004, Azad {{was found}} dead in his {{apartment}} in Munich, Germany, where he had arrived a week earlier to conduct research on the nineteenth century German romantic poet Heinrich Heine, several months after the Islamists' machete attack on him at a book fair, which had left him grievously injured. His family demanded an investigation, alleging that the extremists who had attempted the earlier assassination had a role in this death. While alive, Azad had expressed <b>his</b> wish <b>to</b> donate <b>his</b> <b>body</b> <b>to</b> medical college after his death. But he was buried in Rarhikhal, his village home in Bangladesh as doctors denied <b>to</b> take <b>his</b> <b>body</b> for medical research, as several days had passed <b>to</b> reach <b>his</b> <b>body</b> <b>to</b> Bangladesh from Germany.|$|R
5|$|On December9, 1964, Clarence13X {{was shot}} {{twice in the}} torso while at a popular {{gathering}} place {{in the basement of}} a Harlem tenement. He was brought to Harlem Hospital, where he was treated and released. He later claimed that he died and returned <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>body</b> a short time later. In a 2007 study of the Five Percent movement, American journalist Michael Muhammad Knight speculates that this caused his followers to see him as a Christ figure. The identity and motivation of the shooter are unknown; Knight notes that law enforcement and rival Muslim groups both had a motive to attack Clarence13X. Some Five Percenters have speculated that the attack was part of a robbery attempt or retaliation for unpaid gambling debts. Clarence13X's companions reported that he instructed them not to seek revenge on the shooter and to forswear violence. While recuperating from his wounds, Clarence13X sought to distinguish his movement from other Islamic movements, abandoning Arabic greetings for English expressions.|$|E
5|$|South African {{track and}} field athletes won a {{combined}} 17 medals at the Games, four gold, seven silver and six bronze.

In the 200 metres event Pistorius set a new world record in his heat, but he was defeated in the final by Brazilian Alan Oliveira. After the race Pistorius raised an issue {{about the length of}} Oliveira's blades, he later apologised for the timing of his remarks, but not the content of his complaint. The IPC confirmed the length of Oliveira’s blades were proportional <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>body</b> and legal, but expressed willingness to engage with Pistorius about the issue.|$|E

Alphonse, who is visiting Liore, fights off the armored soldiers and merges parts of his soul to three of their suits to aid him in combat. Meanwhile, Edward breaks into the Thule Society headquarters and accidentally reopens the portal, returning the dead armored soldiers to Earth and allowing Alphonse's armored form to briefly reunite with his brother before his soul returns <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>body,</b> increasing Edward's determination to return to his world.|$|E

5|$|As a junior, Watts {{played in}} the forward line as a strong-marking tall and was an {{accurate}} shot on goal. Regarded as an incredibly quick player for his height, especially over the first twenty metres, his speed and athleticism saw him dominate in the forward line as a junior. After struggling to replicate his form from the juniors in the AFL, he was trialled as a defender in 2011 by then senior-coach, Dean Bailey, playing primarily as the loose man in defence. Bailey intended on using him as both a defender and forward; he recognised Watts {{would not be the}} main key forward at the club, which was intended when he was drafted, but when playing in the forward line, he would instead be used as a floating forward. He played a new role in 2012 under Mark Neeld in defence, where he was highly praised for his ability to read the play and take intercept marks. He played in defence for the duration of Neeld's tenure, until Neeld was sacked and replaced by Neil Craig in the middle of 2013 with Craig electing to return Watts to the forward line. After playing in the forward line and in defence, incoming coach in 2014, Paul Roos, saw an opportunity for Watts to play in the midfield due <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>body</b> size and elite kicking, in addition to the club needing an influx of midfielders. After the desperate need for midfielders dissipated, Watts returned to a half-forward role in the middle of 2014; he played as a half-forward throughout Roos' coaching term and was used as a back-up ruckman in 2016.|$|E
5|$|Batman, Robin and Batgirl {{decide to}} go after Freeze together. By {{the time they get}} to the {{observatory}} where Freeze and Bane are, Gotham is completely frozen. Batgirl and Robin are attacked by Bane. They eventually defeat him by kicking apart his venom tubes, stopping the flow of venom <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>body.</b> Bane collapses before transforming back to his original diminutive size of Antonio Diego and is left helpless on the ground. Meanwhile Batman and Freeze begin to fight each other, with Batman defeating Freeze. Batgirl and Robin manage to unfreeze Gotham; and Batman shows Freeze a recording of Ivy during her fight with Batgirl. Freeze learns that Ivy has betrayed him over the death of wife. Ivy blamed Batman for Nora's death, but she informs Batgirl that it was her idea. Freeze is angered by the betrayal and is informed by Batman that his wife is not dead; she is restored in cryogenic slumber and has been moved to Arkham waiting for him to finish his research. Batman proceeds to ask Freeze for the cure Freeze has created for the first stage of MacGregor's Syndrome to administer to Alfred. Freeze atones for his misunderstanding by giving him medicine he had developed. Ivy is detained in Arkham alongside Freeze, who promises to torment Ivy during their sentence. After Alfred is cured, everyone agrees to let Barbara stay at Wayne Manor.|$|E
5|$|BoxBoy! is {{a puzzle}} {{platform}} video {{game in which}} players control a square-shaped character named Qbby. The goal {{of the game is}} to guide Qbby through a series of obstacle-filled stages that are divided into sets called worlds. Each world is focussed on a particular gameplay theme; for example one world introduces stages that contain deadly lasers, and another introduces cranes for transporting Qbby around. The central gameplay mechanic is Qbby's ability to create boxes and make use of them to clear the obstacles. Boxes are created one at a time as a connected string and the maximum number of boxes in a string varies between each stage. Qbby can detach the string of boxes then push it to different positions. The boxes can be used to overcome obstacles, such as creating a bridge to pass bottomless pits or building staircases to reach higher platforms. Additionally, Qbby can keep the string of boxes attached <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>body.</b> He may then use the boxes as a shield to block hazards such as deadly lasers. He is also able to grapple onto ledges and pull himself up by retracting through the boxes. Creating a new string of boxes causes the previous string to disappear. If Qbby dies, he will respawn at a nearby checkpoint.|$|E
