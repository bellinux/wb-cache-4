In {{a series of}} fierce engagements, Commonwealth forces gradually overran the Russian field fortifications, and the siege reached its final stages by late September. On 28 September 1633, Commonwealth forces took the main Russian supply points, and by 4 October the siege had broken.|$|E
5|$|Following the raids, {{tensions}} {{were high}} {{in the streets of}} the cities. Police were ordered to shoot those who defied the 21:00 to 05:00 curfew, and troops in full camouflage battle dress guarded every major intersection and bridge with automatic weapons bearing fixed bayonets. The empty pagodas were ringed by troops and armored cars. All outgoing news was censored, forcing reporters to smuggle their copy out with travelers flying to foreign countries. The telephone lines in the homes and offices of all U.S. military and embassy staff were disconnected. The head of the USAID mission, Joe Brant, was stopped and searched while commuting to work, and other American officials had their meetings with Vietnamese officials and applications for permits to travel after the curfew hours delayed. The 14,000 U.S. military advisers in the country were given orders <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> homes, and all leave was canceled.|$|E
5|$|In 2011 American {{intelligence}} analyst Raelynn Hillhouse {{wrote that}} according to U.S. intelligence sources, the U.S. had been tipped-off to bin Laden's location by an unnamed Pakistani intelligence insider collecting the $25 million reward. According to the sources, Pakistan purposely stood-down its armed forces to allow the U.S. raid, and the original plan was to kill – not capture – bin Laden. Hillhouse's sources stated that the Pakistanis had been keeping bin Laden under house arrest near their military headquarters in Abbottabad with money provided by the Saudis. According to The Telegraph, Hillhouse's account might explain why U.S. forces encountered no resistance {{on their way to}} and in Abbottabad, and why some residents in Abbottabad were warned <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> houses the day before the raid.|$|E

Relocations to the United States are motivated by economic conditions {{as well as an}} improvement in the laws of the country in which the entrepreneurial firm is based. Relocations to the United States yield much greater returns to Asia-Pacific VCs than investing in companies already based in the United States at the time of VC investment. Further, more experienced Asia-Pacific VCs have greater success with their investee relocations to the United States, and these relocations yield higher returns relative <b>to</b> <b>staying</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> country of origin...|$|R
5|$|It is {{not known}} whether the English pursuit was ordered by Harold {{or if it was}} spontaneous. Wace relates that Harold ordered his men <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> {{formations}} but no other account gives this detail. The Bayeux Tapestry depicts the death of Harold's brothers Gyrth and Leofwine occurring just before the fight around the hillock. This may mean that the two brothers led the pursuit. The Carmen de Hastingae Proelio relates a different story for the death of Gyrth, stating that the duke slew Harold's brother in combat, perhaps thinking that Gyrth was Harold. William of Poitiers states that the bodies of Gyrth and Leofwine were found near Harold's, implying that they died late in the battle. It is possible that if the two brothers died early in the fighting their bodies were taken to Harold, thus accounting for their being found near his body after the battle. The military historian Peter Marren speculates that if Gyrth and Leofwine died early in the battle, that may have influenced Harold to stand and fight to the end.|$|E
5|$|The {{best of the}} few Welsh {{artists of}} the 16th–18th centuries tended {{to leave the country}} to work, many of them moving to London or Italy. Richard Wilson (1714–82) is arguably the first major British landscapist. Although more notable for his Italian scenes, he painted several Welsh scenes on visits from London. By the late 18th century, the {{popularity}} of landscape art grew and clients were found in the larger Welsh towns, allowing more Welsh artists <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> homeland. Artists from outside Wales were also drawn to paint Welsh scenery, at first because of the Celtic Revival. Then in the early 19th century, the Napoleonic Wars preventing the Grand Tour to continental Europe, travel through Wales came to be considered more accessible.|$|E
5|$|Before Alma struck Florida, {{officials}} issued hurricane {{warnings from}} the Florida Keys through Apalachicola. A hurricane watch and gale warning were issued for the state's eastern coastline, extending to Savannah, Georgia. In Key West, residents boarded up houses, and about 1,000people {{fled to the}} region's 11shelters. The MIM-23 Hawk antiaircraft missiles in the city were moved to higher ground, having been in place since the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis. Further north, officials ordered the evacuation of Captiva Island and Sanibel Island. The causeways to Sanibel Island were closed, isolating residents who had not evacuated. Ten emergency shelters were opened in Fort Myers and two in Naples. Overall, about 100,000people were advised to seek shelter, though many of them chose <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> homes. All Phantom jet fighters at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa were transported to Columbus Air Force Base in Mississippi, while aircraft were also evacuated from Homestead Air Reserve Base. Because Alma was initially forecast to cross the central portion of the state, residents along the Florida panhandle were not adequately prepared for the hurricane. Just hours before the storm moved ashore, officials ordered evacuations for residents in low-lying areas around Apalachicola.|$|E

50|$|Furthermore, {{there are}} many {{differences}} in earning between high school graduates and college graduates. This difference is especially pertinent {{between male and female}} individuals searching for a job. If unemployed, the differences between the rates of high school graduates and college graduates may even be similar. However, women tend to find more opportunities in unpaid care work if they are unable to get into the paid work force. If individuals are unable to achieve a degree, they will not meet the threshold of what many jobs require. This inevitability is felt by much of the world population who are unable to attend school due <b>to</b> <b>staying</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> household <b>to</b> take care of elderly or sick family members.|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} differences between family-owned and non-family-owned small and medium tourism enterprises (SMTEs) operating in regional tourism destinations. The {{research focuses on}} SMTE owners' commitment <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> the town {{in which they are}} embedded. Based on samples of family (N[*]=[*] 157) and non-family (N[*]=[*] 141) businesses in regional South Australia, was used to test the construct validity of SMTE owners' “commitment to stay”. Multigroup invariance was used to test the factorial equivalence of scores from the commitment model across family and non-family businesses. Results support the validity of the “commitment to stay” CFA model. Multigroup invariance analysis suggests family business owners have a greater commitment <b>to</b> <b>staying</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> town. These results contribute {{to our understanding of the}} unique objectives and behaviours of family businesses in tourism as well as present important implications to destination managers aiming to support sustainable entrepreneurial development.

25|$|The government's role as {{the primary}} {{investor}} allows a systematic loan refinancing process to be implemented.

40|$|As Canada’s {{population}} ages, policy {{analysts are}} increasingly concerned with {{issues related to}} housing the elderly. Addressing some of these concerns, this thesis provides evidence {{of the characteristics of}} the elderly who choose to move to Senior Citizens’ Apartments (SCAs), as opposed <b>to</b> <b>staying</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> own homes. Choice based sampling and binary logit analysis are used to investigate the connection between the choice made and the characteristics of the elderly. The results indicate that being married and owning a car increase the odds of elderly persons <b>staying</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> own homes as opposed to moving to an SCA, while renting a home decreases them. Analysis indicates that marital status is strongly related to age, while owning a car is an indicator of independence and perhaps higher income. Renting a home, on the other hand, is related to relatively low income. Thus, those who move to SCA’s are expected to be older, widowed females with reduced personal independence and relatively low income...|$|R
