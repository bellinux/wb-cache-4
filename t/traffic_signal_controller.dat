Pre-timed traffic signals provide each intersection approach a fixed amount of time on a round robin basis, serving each approach consecutively, and repeating the pattern. No movements are skipped. An actuated traffic signal relies on some mechanism for detecting vehicles as they approach the intersection. Where detection has occurred, green time is provided to that approach.

50|$|Vehicle {{detection}} loops, called inductive-loop traffic detectors, {{can detect}} vehicles passing or {{arriving at a}} certain point, for instance approaching a traffic light or in motorway traffic. An insulated, electrically conducting loop is installed in the pavement. The electronics unit transmits energy into the wire loops at frequencies between 10 kHz to 200 kHz, depending on the model. The inductive-loop system behaves as a tuned electrical circuit in which the loop wire and lead-in cable are the inductive elements. When a vehicle passes over the loop or is stopped within the loop, the vehicle induces eddy currents in the wire loops, which decrease their inductance. The decreased inductance actuates the electronics unit output relay or solid-state optically isolated output, which sends a pulse to the <b>traffic</b> <b>signal</b> <b>controller</b> signifying the passage or presence of a vehicle. Parking structures for automobiles may use inductive loops to track traffic (occupancy) in and out or may be used by access gates or ticketing systems to detect vehicles while others use Parking guidance and information systems.

One of the major performance measures of <b>traffic</b> <b>signal</b> <b>controller</b> is the average waiting time of vehicles. To compare different kinds of traffic signal controllers, a discrete event simulation model of <b>traffic</b> <b>signal</b> <b>controller</b> on a single intersection is developed using Matlab/Simulink/Simevents. In this paper, three algorithms are proposed to reduce the average waiting time at intersections. The proposed algorithms are compared to the base-line fixed-time controller through extensive simulation experiments.

One of the proposed algorithms that adapts both green intervals and cycle length, AW VariableC, outperforms other algorithms, including base-line, under all conditions, but this is on the expense of more computational overhead and more input parameters.

An advanced system, in which traffic signals at junctions at a close proximity are coordinated, enables a more efficient method of traffic control. This thesis presents the development of hardware and software for the Uniroad <b>traffic</b> <b>signal</b> <b>controller,</b> for interfacing it to the proposed Advanced Traffic Control System (A TCS) for Sri Lanka, and a technique to calculate traffic plans based on the Genetic Algorithm for the coordinated system. In hardware development, a communication interface and a general purpose input interface (GPIT) are designed and implemented for the <b>traffic</b> <b>signal</b> <b>controller</b> (TSC). These are used to monitor the performance and change traffic plans manually or through computer control. The GPII is also used to interface vehicle detectors, pedestrian pushbutton etc. to the TSC. The firmware platform of the TSC is developed to accommodate the requirements of both coordinated as well as individual systems. Synchronizing routines, temporary overrides and online time plan adjustments as well as error detecting and logging routines are introduced. A control and monitoring (C&M) software package is developed for the control center. Using this package, the operation of each <b>traffic</b> <b>signal</b> <b>controller</b> can be monitored or optimally adjusted as needed. A traffic plan calculator (TPC) is developed to calculate traffic plans needed for a set of coordinated traffic signal controllers.

ANFIS <b>traffic</b> <b>signal</b> <b>controller</b> with its fuzzy rule base {{and its ability}} to learn from a set of sample data could improve the performance of Existing traffic signal controlling system to reduce traffic congestions at most of the busy traffic intersections in city such as Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The aim of this research is to develop an ANFIS traffic signals controller for multilane-isolated four approaches intersections in order to ease traffic congestions at traffic intersections.

40|$|Due to {{that the}} {{existing}} traffic facilities can hardly be extended, developing traffic signal control methods {{is the most important}} way to improve the traffic efficiency of modern roundabouts. This paper proposes a novel <b>traffic</b> <b>signal</b> <b>controller</b> with two fuzzy layers for signalizing the roundabout. The outer layer of the controller computes urgency degrees of all the phase subsets and then activates the most urgent subset. This mechanism helps to instantly respond to the current traffic condition of the roundabout so as to improve real-timeness. The inner layer of the controller computes extension time of the current phase. If the extension value is larger than a threshold value, the current phase is maintained; otherwise the next phase in the running phase subset (selected by the outer layer) is activated. The inner layer adopts well-designed phase sequences, which helps to smooth the traffic flows and to avoid traffic jam. In general, the proposed <b>traffic</b> <b>signal</b> <b>controller</b> is capable of improving real-timeness as well as reducing traffic congestion. Moreover, an offline particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is developed to optimize the membership functions adopted in the proposed controller.

40|$|<b>Traffic</b> <b>signal</b> timing has {{traditionally}} been designed and updated by modeling intersection operations. However, recent technological developments have introduced event logging capability within modern <b>traffic</b> <b>signal</b> <b>controllers,</b> which has shifted the process of retiming from modeling operations to measuring real performance. This allows signal engineers to retime signals on a proactive basis instead of reacting to complaint calls. Various performance measures and applications have been discussed in literature, but there {{has not yet been}} a comprehensive study of the process of deploying required infrastructure and conducting corridor retiming using signal performance measures. ^ To develop guidance on deployment and use of signal performance measures for retiming, a case study was performed on State Road 9 (SR- 9) in Anderson, Indiana. After completing an inventory of existing equipment on the corridor, <b>traffic</b> <b>signal</b> <b>controllers</b> and communication infrastructure were upgraded to enable the analysis of operations using high-resolution <b>controller</b> data. Using <b>signal</b> performance measures, a synchronized set of time-of-day plans was deployed, which decreased or held constant chronic split failures at most intersections on the corridor and improved travel time reliability. Next, local capacity was modified to improve service to over-utilized side-street and left turn movements, reducing localized split failures from 41. 3 to 34. 5 split failures per intersection per day. Finally, offsets were optimized to improve progression on the corridor during each time-of-day plan. The average percent of vehicles arriving on green increased or remained constant for all analysis periods, including an increase from 62 % to 69 % for the southbound PM period, which led to a 1 -minute decrease in travel time during this analysis phase. ^ As a result of the upgrade and retiming, travel time and corridor reliability were improved throughout the day, most notably decreasing travel time by 2 minutes from the existing conditions for the southbound PM plan. There were also opportunities to utilize the high-resolution controller data to monitor construction projects on the corridor. This document can serve as a blueprint for an agency or consultant to develop a new timing plan using <b>traffic</b> <b>signal</b> performance measures. ...|$|R
