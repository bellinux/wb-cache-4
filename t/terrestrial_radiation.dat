The SSA tends to unity if scattering dominates, with relatively little absorption, and decreases as absorption increases, becoming zero for infinite absorption.

25|$|<b>Terrestrial</b> <b>radiation,</b> for {{the purpose}} of the table above, only {{includes}} sources that remain external to the body. The major radionuclides of concern are potassium, uranium and thorium and their decay products, some of which, like radium and radon are intensely radioactive but occur in low concentrations. Most of these sources have been decreasing, due to radioactive decay since the formation of the Earth, because there is no significant amount currently transported to the Earth. Thus, the present activity on earth from uranium-238 is only half as much as it originally was because of its 4.5 billion year half-life, and potassium-40 (half-life 1.25 billion years) is only at about 8% of original activity. The effects on humans of the actual diminishment (due to decay) of these isotopes is, however, minimal. This is because humans evolved too recently for the difference in activity over a fraction of a half-life to be significant. Put another way, human history is so short in comparison to a half-life of a billion years, that the activity of these long-lived isotopes has been effectively constant throughout our time on this planet.|$|E

60|$|Other {{phenomena}} of no less importance than {{the distribution of}} vapour, and more or less depending on it, are the duration and amount of solar and <b>terrestrial</b> <b>radiation.</b> Towards D the sun is rarely seen during the rainy season, as well from the constant presence of nimbi aloft, as from fog {{on the surface of}} the ground. An absence of both light and heat is the result south of the parallel of Kinchin; and at C low fogs prevail at the same season, but do not intercept either the same amount of light or heat; whilst at T there is much sunshine and bright light. During the night, again, there is no <b>terrestrial</b> <b>radiation</b> between S and P; the rain either continues to pour--in some months with increased violence--or the saturated atmosphere is condensed into a thick white mist, which hangs over the redundant vegetation. A bright starlight night is almost unknown in the summer months at 6000 to 10,000 feet, but is frequent in December and January, and at intervals between October and May, when, however, vegetation is little affected by the cold of nocturnal radiation. In the regions north of Kinchin, starlight nights are more frequent, and the cold produced by radiation, at 14,000 feet, is often severe towards the end of the rains in September. Still the amount of clear weather during the night is small; the fog clears off for an hour or two at sunset as the wind falls, but the returning cold north current again chills the air soon afterwards, and rolling masses of vapour are hence flying overhead, or sweeping the surface of the earth, throughout the summer nights. In the Tibetan regions, on the other hand, bright nights and even sharp frosts prevail throughout the warmest months.|$|E

40|$|Naturally {{occurring}} radioactive noble gas, radon (222 Rn) is {{a valuable}} tracer to study atmospheric processes and to validate global chemical transport models. However, the use of radon as a proxy in atmospheric and climate research {{is limited by the}} uncertainties in the magnitude and distribution of the radon flux density over the Earth’s surface. <b>Terrestrial</b> gamma <b>radiation</b> is a useful proxy for generating radon flux maps. A previously reported radon flux map of Europe used <b>terrestrial</b> gamma <b>radiation</b> extracted from automated radiation monitoring networks. This approach failed to account for the influence of local artificial radiation sources around the detector, leading to under/over estimation of the reported radon flux values at different locations. We present an alternative approach based on soil radionuclides which enables us to generate accurate radon flux maps with good confidence. Firstly, we present a detailed comparison between the <b>terrestrial</b> gamma <b>radiation</b> obtained from the National Radiation Monitoring network of the Netherlands and the <b>terrestrial</b> gamma <b>radiation</b> calculated from soil radionuclides. Extending further, we generated radon flux maps of the Netherlands and Europe using our proposed approach. The modelled flux values for the Netherlands agree reasonably well with the two observed direct radon flux measurements (within 2 σ level). On the European scale, we find that the observed radon flux values are higher than our modelled values and we introduce a correction factor to account for this difference. Our approach discussed in this paper enables us to develop reliable and accurate radon flux maps in countries with little or no information on radon flux values. ...|$|R
60|$|Nocturnal and <b>terrestrial</b> <b>radiation</b> {{are even}} more {{difficult}} phenomena for the traveller to estimate than solar radiation, the danger of exposing instruments at night being always great in wild countries.

I have frequently made this observation, and always with a similar result; it may account for the great injury plants sustain from a thin covering of ice on their foliage, even when the temperature is but little below the freezing-point.] and found no material difference in the mean of many observations of each, though often 1 degree to 2 degrees in individual ones. Avoiding radiation from surrounding objects is very difficult, especially in wooded countries.

60|$|At {{considerable}} elevations {{these effects}} are so greatly increased, {{that it is}} extremely probable that at certain localities the mean temperature of the soil may be even 10 degrees warmer {{than that of the}} air; thus, at Jongri, elevation 13,194 feet, the soil in January was 34.5 degrees, or 19.2 degrees above the mean temperature of the month, immediately before the ground became covered with snow {{for the remainder of the}} winter; during the three succeeding months, therefore, the temperature of the soil probably does not fall below that of the snow, whilst the mean temperature of the air in January may be estimated at about 20 degrees, February 22 degrees, March 30 degrees, and April 35 degrees. If, again, we assume the temperature of the soil of Jongri to be that of other Sikkim localities between 10,000 and 14,000 feet, we may assume the soil to be warmer by 10 degrees in July (see Tungu observations), by 8 degrees or 9 degrees in September (see Yeumtong); by l0 degrees in October (see Tungu); and by 7 degrees to l0 degrees in November (see Wallanchoon and Nanki). These temperatures, however, vary extremely according to exposure and amount of sunshine; and I should expect that the greatest differences would be found in the sunny climate of Tibet, where the sun's heat is most powerful. Were nocturnal or <b>terrestrial</b> <b>radiation</b> as constant and powerful as solar, the effects of the latter would be neutralised; but such is not the case at any elevation in Sikkim.|$|E
