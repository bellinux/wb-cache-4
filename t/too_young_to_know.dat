500|$|Jaws was {{the first}} major motion picture to be shot on the ocean, {{resulting}} in a troubled shoot that went far over budget. David Brown said that the budget [...] "was $4million and the picture wound up costing $9million"; the effects outlays alone grew to $3 million due to the problems with the mechanical sharks. Disgruntled crew members gave the film the nickname [...] "Flaws". Spielberg attributed many problems to his perfectionism and his inexperience. The former was epitomized by his insistence on shooting at sea with a life-sized shark; [...] "I could have shot the movie in the tank or even in a protected lake somewhere, but it would not have looked the same," [...] he said. As for his lack of experience: [...] "I was naive about the ocean, basically. I was pretty naive about mother nature and the hubris of a filmmaker who thinks he can conquer the elements was foolhardy, but I was <b>too</b> <b>young</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> I was being foolhardy when I demanded that we shoot the film in the Atlantic Ocean and not in a North Hollywood tank." [...] Gottlieb said that [...] "there was nothing to do except make the movie", so everyone kept overworking, and while as a writer {{he did not have to}} attend the ocean set every day, once the crewmen returned they arrived [...] "ravaged and sunburnt, windblown and covered with salt water".|$|E
2500|$|The concerto is respected, even feared, by many pianists. Josef Hofmann, {{the pianist}} {{to whom the}} work is dedicated, never {{publicly}} performed it, saying that it [...] "wasn't for" [...] him. Gary Graffman lamented he had not learned this concerto as a student, when he was [...] "still <b>too</b> <b>young</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> fear".|$|E
2500|$|In a 2003 {{interview}} with The A.V. Club, Berkeley Breathed, {{the creator of}} the Opus comic strip, revealed that [...] "Opus was named after a Kansas song." [...] From the band's 1976 album Leftoverture, the songs [...] "Opus Insert" [...] and the epic [...] "Magnum Opus" [...] could both be the inspiration for the name. He also added, [...] "If you're <b>too</b> <b>young</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> who Kansas was, to hell with you." ...|$|E

For her father has been bewitched, and her {{brothers}} bound by a spell that only Sorcha can lift.|$|R
2500|$|While still a student, Ashcroft {{made her}} {{professional}} stage debut at the Birmingham Repertory Theatre in {{a revival of}} J. M. Barrie's Dear Brutus opposite Ralph Richardson, {{with whom she had}} been greatly impressed when she saw him in Charles Doran's touring company while she was still a schoolgirl. She graduated from the Central School in 1927 with London University's Diploma in Dramatic Art. Never much drawn to the West End or stardom, she learned her craft with mostly small companies in fringe theatres. Her first notable West End role was Naemi in Jew Süss in 1929, an extravagantly theatrical production, in which she won praise for the naturalism and truth of her playing. In the same year she married Rupert Hart-Davis, then an aspiring actor, later a well-known publisher. He later described the marriage as [...] "a sad failure: we were much <b>too</b> <b>young</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> what we wanted... after much agony we parted and were duly divorced. Nowadays Peggy and I lunch together perhaps {{once or twice a year}} in a Soho restaurant and have a lovely nostalgic-romantic talk of shared memories of long ago. She is a lovely person and the best actress living." ...|$|E
2500|$|Several critics {{compared}} The Clone Wars to a Saturday morning cartoon {{and described}} it {{as little more than}} a plug for the upcoming animated series. Linda Barnard, of the Toronto Star, said the movie [...] "pretty much drives a stake into the heart of every loyal fan of the movies. And now [...] out to stick it to those <b>too</b> <b>young</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> about Jar Jar Binks." [...] Variety magazine reviewer Todd McCarthy said, [...] "This isn't the Star Wars we've always known and at least sometimes loved." [...] Joe Neumiar, of the New York Daily News, wrote, [...] "If this were a true Star Wars film, right about now somebody would say, '...I've got a bad feeling about this.'" [...] In his review for Entertainment Weekly, critic Owen Gleiberman gave the film an F grade and wrote, [...] "George Lucas is turning into the enemy of fun." [...] Carrie Rickey, of The Philadelphia Inquirer, said, [...] "The best that can be said about the movie is that it's harmless and mostly charmless. The Clone Wars is to Star Wars what karaoke is to pop music." ...|$|E
2500|$|Cole has cited several hip-hop {{artists as}} {{influencing}} his rapping style, including Tupac Shakur, Nas, Jay Z, and Eminem. He described {{in an interview}} with Steve Lobel, [...] "Jay was a mentor before I ever signed to him." [...] "I studied his moves that much...I got to go on tour with him and steal a lot of gems. That's how you supposed to do it. You're supposed to learn and take pieces from the greatest. So, Jay was my mentor before I ever signed to him. And now that I signed to him it's just a blessing to be able to hit him for advice and get that real 20 years of experience or however long he been in the game. It's priceless.""My favorite rapper was Pac," [...] he said. [...] "He was my favorite rapper before I even started rapping. Before I even thought of-It went from Michael Jackson, Bobby Brown as a kid and artists like that. Even Kool Moe Dee. Just the cool dude that I looked up to. And then one day my stepfather came home from-I don't know if he was back from Desert Storm...I remember him coming home with that first Pac album. With [...] "Brenda's Got A Baby". It was 2Pacalypse Now. And since then-When I was <b>too</b> <b>young</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> what he was talking about, but it connected. Cause that's the thing about art. It's just truth. It's straight-Whatever you feel. So, even as a seven-year-old kid, eight-year-old kid I could hear Pac's early albums and feel the truth." [...] Cole drew comparisons to Nas following the release of Friday Night Lights, stating that Nas served as the primary inspiration behind the creation of the mixtape. Cole later addressed their musical similarities on [...] "Let Nas Down", a song written and composed due to his disparaging comments towards [...] "Work Out".|$|E
5000|$|Charles E. Cobb, {{formerly}} SNCC field {{secretary in}} Mississippi, {{has said that}} SNCC's grassroots and autonomous community work was undercut and co-opted by Lyndon Johnson's War on Poverty: [...] "After we got the Civil Rights Act in 1964 and the Voting Rights Act in 1965, a lot of groups that we had cultivated were absorbed into the Democratic Party...a lot more money came into the states we were working in. A {{lot of the people}} we were working with became a part of Head Start and various kinds of poverty programs. We were <b>too</b> <b>young</b> <b>to</b> really <b>know</b> how <b>to</b> respond effectively. How could we tell poor sharecroppers or maids making a few dollars a day to walk away from poverty program salaries or stipends?" ...|$|R
50|$|Ten-year-old Jamie Mathews and his family, {{consisting}} of his sister, Jas, who is 15, and his father, an alcoholic, {{moves to the}} country from London after Jamie's mother has an affair and leaves. Sitting on the Mantelpiece in their new home is the ashes of Rose, Jas's twin sister, who was killed on September 9th in the London Bombings, five years earlier. Jas has been deeply troubled {{by the death of}} her sister, yet it doesn't bother Jamie since he was <b>too</b> <b>young</b> <b>to</b> really <b>know</b> Rose. At his new school, a catholic school, Jamie befriends Sunya, who is a Muslim. Jamie knows his father wouldn't approve of their friendship, as he hates Muslims and blames Rose's death on the entire Muslim population.|$|R

Marian is nothing to me: she does not even like me; but I dont {{want to see her}} ruin herself merely because she is too inexperienced <b>to</b> <b>know</b> when she is well off. I have had to fight my way in London: and I know what it is, and what the world is. She is not fit to take charge of herself. Good-bye, Mr. Conolly: you are a great deal <b>too</b> <b>young</b> {{yourself}} <b>to</b> <b>know</b> the danger, for all your cleverness.

50|$|The stories {{recount the}} fate of a small West African boy. After he and his elder brother are {{abandoned}} by his family, they flee as armed slave traders approach their village. On becoming separated from his brother, who has likely been captured by the slave traders, he unwittingly enters the bush, or wilderness. He is <b>too</b> <b>young</b> and inexperienced <b>to</b> <b>know,</b> as every hunter and traveler does, that ghosts or spirits live there, and mortals risk great peril by entering the area.|$|R
50|$|Nunziato d'Antonio di Domenico, {{known as}} Nunziata (1468-1525) was an Italian painter, {{fireworks}} artist, and bombardier of Renaissance Florence. None of Nunziata’s works {{can be identified}} today. Most {{of what we know}} about him comes from a single passage by Giorgio Vasari, in the 1568 edition of the Vite, within the Life of Ridolfo, David, and Benedetto Ghirlandaio. <b>Too</b> <b>young</b> <b>to</b> have <b>known</b> Nunziata personally, Vasari shaped him into a literary character: the joking painter in the tradition of Franco Sacchetti's novelle about Giotto and the fabled Buffalmacco. Nunziata belonged to the class of plebeian artists, and Vasari generally omitted their works. His story represents a part of Florentine art outside Vasari's canon, that became art history’s. His son Antonio, also a painter, left to work in England in 1519, and as Anthony Toto became court artist or Serjeant Painter to Henry VIII and Edward VI.|$|R
5000|$|To {{escape the}} guilt of his crime, Dorian goes to an opium den, where James Vane is unknowingly present. James had been seeking vengeance upon Dorian ever since Sibyl killed herself, but had no leads to pursue: {{the only thing he}} knew about Dorian was the name Sibyl called him, [...] "Prince Charming". In the opium den however he hears someone refer to Dorian as [...] "Prince Charming", and he accosts Dorian. Dorian deceives James into believing that he is <b>too</b> <b>young</b> <b>to</b> have <b>known</b> Sibyl, who killed herself 18 years earlier, as his face is still that of a young man. James relents and {{releases}} Dorian, but is then approached by a woman from the opium den who reproaches James for not killing Dorian. She confirms that the man was Dorian Gray and explains that he has not aged in 18 years. James runs after Dorian, but he has gone.|$|R

50|$|The story {{starts with}} Mr Capulet {{deciding}} {{to take his}} family to Australia for good. In the meantime, Jess, who is getting in shape for the London Marathon, convinced Juliet to join the online platform Twitter. On {{the other side of}} the town Mercutio, Romeo's best friend wakes up with a hangover and a missing mobile and tweets away the events of the night. As the 10th anniversary of the accident is nearing everybody is reminded and thinks about the events in the past in a different way. Juliet remembers her mother but is also thinking about her birthday coming up. Jess begins to feel depressed about their mother's death and feels that Montague Sr. should have been prosecuted for murder. Mercutio remembers the big fight where Montague Sr. was beat up by 'Crapulet'/Mr. Capulet and announces his hate on Twitter. He was <b>too</b> <b>young</b> <b>to</b> have <b>known</b> about the real events going on but he has grown so close to the Montagues that he knows on which side he belongs to. Romeo has not been convinced to join Twitter yet.|$|R

[...] were the first questions Rose asked herself {{as soon as she}} woke from the brief sleep which followed a long, sad vigil. It seemed as if the whole world must be changed because a trouble darkened it for her. She was <b>too</b> <b>young</b> yet <b>to</b> <b>know</b> how possible it is to forgive much greater sins than this, forget far heavier disappointments, outlive higher hopes, and bury loves compared to which hers was but a girlish fancy. She wished it had not been so bright a day, wondered how her birds could sing with such shrill gaiety, put no ribbon in her hair, and said, as she looked at the reflection of her own tired face in the glass, [...] "Poor thing! You thought the new leaf would have something pleasant on it. The story has been very sweet and easy to read so far, but the sad and sober part is coming now." ...|$|R

2500|$|The use of {{the highly}} {{controversial}} Doors song [...] "The End", from their debut album, in the popular Vietnam War film, Apocalypse Now in 1979 {{and the release of}} the first compilation album in seven years, Greatest Hits, released in the fall of 1980, created a resurgence in The Doors. Due to those two events, an entirely new audience, <b>too</b> <b>young</b> <b>to</b> have <b>known</b> of the band earlier, began listening and purchasing the band's music. The group's popularity continued to increase. In the 80's, the band released concert films, and live and compilation albums to much commercial success. In 1991, The Doors, a feature film about the band, directed by Academy Award winning director Oliver Stone, that starred Val Kilmer as Morrison was released, which helped to expand The Doors' popularity even more, and a new audience had been born. When You're Strange (2009), is a documentary about The Doors written and directed by Tom DiCillo and narrated by Johnny Depp. It was nominated for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Nonfiction Series and won a Grammy Award for Best Long Form Video. The band continues to release compilations through Rhino Records and new live material through both Rhino and their Bright Midnight Archives label.|$|R
5000|$|Sue {{attended}} school first at Madame Talvande’s French School for Young Ladies in Charleston, along with classmate Mary Boykin Chesnut, and later at Madame Binsse’s in Philadelphia. At Talvande’s in particular {{she received a}} heavy dosage of French, the required language for both instructional and social dialogues, but she also studied chemistry, botany, astronomy, literature, rhetoric, German, art, dancing and music. Academic tutelage, however, was only one component of these programs. The young women attended social gatherings amongst their Madame’s acquaintances, during which {{they were expected to}} learn and practice their grace and etiquette. Sue, expecting the urban North to contain a world of excitement and adventure, was frequently discouraged by the social restrictions created by her father’s unwillingness to produce appropriate financing. She frequently wrote back complaining of malaise and depression, which her father claimed was feigned. Years later, Sue wrote that “it is so long since I have left {{this part of the country}} nine years; and when I was at the North, I was <b>too</b> <b>young</b> <b>to</b> appreciate or <b>know</b> its advantages.” ...|$|R
60|$|In the Middle Ages {{and in the}} Renaissance (which was, {{in certain}} times and respects, a much gloomier period) this idea of the {{skeleton}} had a vast influence in freezing the pride out of all earthly pomps and the fragrance out of all fleeting pleasures. But it was not, surely, the mere dread of death that did this, for these were ages in which men went to meet death singing; it {{was the idea of}} the degradation of man in the grinning ugliness of his structure that withered the juvenile insolence of beauty and pride. And in this it almost assuredly did more good than harm. There is nothing so cold or so pitiless as youth, and youth in aristocratic stations and ages tended to an impeccable dignity, an endless summer of success which needed to be very sharply reminded of the scorn of the stars. It was well that such flamboyant prigs should be convinced that one practical joke, at least, would bowl them over, that they would fall into one grinning man-trap, and not rise again. That the whole structure of their existence was as wholesomely ridiculous as that of a pig or a parrot they could not be expected to realize; that birth was humorous, coming of age humorous, drinking and fighting humorous, they were far <b>too</b> <b>young</b> and solemn <b>to</b> <b>know.</b> But at least they were taught that death was humorous.|$|R
