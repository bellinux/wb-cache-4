Although Karabulut et al. (2006) found only strike-slip events in their analysis, we identified normal fault events {{both before and after}} the 2014 event. These normal fault events, which are indicative of a transtensional stress regime in the AS, would be related to the formation of the topographic depression along the NAF.|$|E
