5|$|The final list mixes {{well-known}} landmarks {{with relatively}} obscure locations. <b>There</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> specific motivation {{for how they}} were chosen; when the travel writer Tim Moore searched the Waddingtons' company archives he did not uncover any relevant documentation.|$|E
5|$|Regardless, K'inich Yat Ahk II took up {{the throne}} on May 31, 781 AD (9.17.10.9.4 1 K'an 7 Yaxk'in), almost a year {{following}} the end of Ha' K'in Xook's reign. Despite this lengthy gap, <b>there</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> evidence of anyone ruling Piedras Negras between the two kings.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} the dish are unclear. The name most likely derives from the French anges à cheval, and <b>there</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> {{significance}} in the oyster/angel and bacon/horse links. Its first occurrence, according to the Oxford English Dictionary and other sources, is in 1888, in Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management. However, there is a reference in an Australian newspaper to the dish, which includes a brief recipe, from 1882.|$|E

5|$|Like other requiem sharks, the {{dusky shark}} is viviparous: the {{developing}} embryos are initially nourished by a yolk sac, which is {{converted into a}} placental connection to the mother once the yolk supply is exhausted. Mating occurs during spring in the northwestern Atlantic, while <b>there</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> reproductive seasonality in other regions such as off South Africa. Females are capable of storing masses of sperm, possibly from multiple males, for months to years within their nidamental glands (an organ that secretes egg cases). This would be advantageous given the sharks' itinerant natures and low natural abundance, which would make encounters with suitable mates infrequent and unpredictable.|$|E
5|$|Other {{authors have}} {{suggested}} that competition was limited by geographical separation. Unlike some other groups of dinosaurs, <b>there</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> correlation with distance from the sea. Neither Daspletosaurus nor Gorgosaurus was more common at higher or lower elevations than the other. However, while there is some overlap, Gorgosaurus {{appears to be more}} common at northern latitudes, with species of Daspletosaurus more abundant to the south. The same pattern is seen in other groups of dinosaurs. Chasmosaurine ceratopsians and hadrosaurine hadrosaurs are also more common in the Two Medicine Formation and in southwestern North America during the Campanian. Thomas Holtz has suggested that this pattern indicates shared ecological preferences between tyrannosaurines, chasmosaurines and hadrosaurines. Holtz notes that, {{at the end of the}} later Maastrichtian stage, tyrannosaurines like Tyrannosaurus rex, hadrosaurines and chasmosaurines like Triceratops were widespread throughout western North America, while albertosaurines and centrosaurines became extinct, and lambeosaurines were very rare.|$|E
5|$|There {{are other}} missing B {{vitamins}} which were reclassified or {{determined not to}} be vitamins. For example, B9 is folic acid and five of the folates {{are in the range}} B11 through B16, forms of other vitamins already discovered, not required as a nutrient by the entire population (like B10, PABA for internal use), biologically inactive, toxic, or with unclassifiable effects in humans, or not generally recognised as vitamins by science, such as the highest-numbered, which some naturopath practitioners call B21 and B22. There are also nine lettered B complex vitamins (e.g. Bm). There are other D vitamins now recognised as other substances, which some sources of the same type number up to D7. The controversial cancer treatment laetrile was at one point lettered as vitamin B17. <b>There</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> consensus on any vitamins Q, R, T, V, W, X, Y or Z, nor are there substances officially designated as Vitamins N or I, although the latter may have been another form of one of the other vitamins or a known and named nutrient of another type.|$|E

25|$|In males {{previously}} having undergone radiotherapy, <b>there</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> {{increase in}} genetic defects or congenital malformations {{in their children}} conceived after therapy. However, the use of assisted reproductive technologies and micromanipulation techniques might increase this risk.|$|E
25|$|Another {{discovery}} of shells {{at a second}} locality was published in 2010. Those shells are stored in the Netherlands Centre for Biodiversity Naturalis, Leiden. <b>There</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> other museum or collection that holds material of this species.|$|E
25|$|Dobson's “” {{depicts the}} horror of being imprisoned in an animal body in this way with the human {{consciousness}} unchanged. <b>There</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> relief, for only in the final line is it revealed that Odysseus has arrived to free them.|$|E
40|$|<b>There</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> an {{increasing}} interest {{in public health}} among veterinarians. Also or possibly because of this interest <b>there</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{an increasing}} interest in cities in having veterinarians in public health work. Because of this interest {{it was thought that}} the following might <b>be</b> of interest <b>to</b> the readers of this publication...|$|R

25|$|Compared to the Avestan {{alphabet}} Old Persian notably lacks voiced fricatives, but {{includes the}} sign ç (of uncertain pronunciation) {{and a sign}} for the non-native l. Notably, {{in common with the}} Brahmic scripts, <b>there</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> distinction between a consonant followed by an a and a consonant followed by nothing.|$|E
25|$|There is no genetic {{differentiation}} between the migratory populations of {{eastern and western}} North America. Recent research has identified the specific areas in the genome of the monarch that regulate migration. <b>There</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> genetic difference between a migrating and nonmigrating monarch but the gene is expressed in migrating monarchs but not expressed in nonmigrating monarchs.|$|E

25|$|There {{is always}} a dominant-subordinate {{relationship}} between chicks in a brood. Although dominant A-chicks grow faster and survive past infancy more often than the subordinate B-chick, there is actually no difference in reproductive success between {{the two types of}} siblings during adulthood. In one longitudinal study, <b>there</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> long-term effects of dominance hierarchies; in fact, subordinate chicks were often observed producing nests of their own before their dominant siblings.|$|E
25|$|An {{alternate}} tradition {{holds that}} Poirot {{was born in}} the village of Ellezelles (province of Hainaut, Belgium). A few memorials dedicated to Hercule Poirot {{can be seen in the}} centre of this village. <b>There</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> reference to this in Christie's writings, but the town of Ellezelles cherishes a copy of Poirot's birth certificate in a local memorial 'attesting' Poirot's birth, naming his father and mother as Jules-Louis Poirot and Godelieve Poirot.|$|E
25|$|The wh-word who is {{the direct}} object of the verb likes {{in each of these}} sentences. <b>There</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> limit on the {{distance}} that can separate the fronted expression from its canonical position. In more technical terms, we can say that the dependency relation between the gap (the canonical, empty position) and its filler (the wh-expression) is unbounded in the sense that there is no upper bound on how deeply embedded within the given sentence the gap may appear.|$|E

25|$|Monongahela-style stemmed stone pipes {{have been}} found among a few {{southeast}} Fort Ancient sites, including Orchard and Man, and Mount Carbon, although <b>there</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> Monongahelan Monyock Cord-impressed ceramic pipes at Fort Ancient sites. Shell-tempered pipes are probably not Iroquoian, as found at the Clover site {{and one of the}} two fragments from the Buffalo site. A pipe found at the Hardin site near the Big Sandy has an etching of a lizard. These sites are in the southwest part of the state.|$|E
25|$|In males {{previously}} having undergone chemotherapy or radiotherapy, <b>there</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> {{increase in}} genetic defects or congenital malformations {{in their children}} conceived after therapy. The use of assisted reproductive technologies and micromanipulation techniques might increase this risk. In females previously having undergone chemotherapy, miscarriage and congenital malformations are not increased in subsequent conceptions. However, when in vitro fertilization and embryo cryopreservationis practised between or shortly after treatment, possible genetic risks to the growing oocytes exist, and hence it has been recommended that the babies be screened.|$|E
25|$|Scrooge's age {{has never}} been specified, {{although}} according to Don Rosa, Scrooge was born in Scotland in 1867, and earned his Number One Dime exactly ten years later. The DuckTales episodes (and many European comics) show a Scrooge who hailed from Scotland in the 19th century, yet was clearly familiar with all the technology and amenities of the 1980s. Despite this extremely advanced age, Scrooge {{does not appear to}} be on the verge of dotage, and is vigorous enough to keep up with his nephews in adventures; with rare exception <b>there</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> sign of him slowing down.|$|E
