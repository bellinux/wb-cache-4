5|$|A cheap, {{cost-effective}} {{and practical}} alternative in poorer countries is visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA). Instituting and sustaining cytology-based programs {{in these regions}} can be difficult, due {{to the need for}} trained personnel, equipment and facilities and difficulties in follow-up. With VIA, results and <b>treatment</b> <b>can</b> be available on the same day. As a screening test, VIA is comparable to cervical cytology in accurately identifying precancerous lesions.|$|E
5|$|Evidence {{of attack}} {{may be found}} in the form of tiny piles of book-dust and specks of frass. Damage may be {{concentrated}} in the spine, the projecting edges of pages and the cover. Prevention of attack relies on keeping books in cool, clean, dry positions with low humidity, and occasional inspections should be made. <b>Treatment</b> <b>can</b> be by freezing for lengthy periods, but some insect eggs are very resistant and can survive for long periods at low temperatures.|$|E

5|$|Most {{cases of}} COPD can be {{prevented}} by reducing exposure to risk factors. This includes decreasing rates of smoking and improving indoor and outdoor air quality. While <b>treatment</b> <b>can</b> slow worsening, there is no cure. COPD treatments include stopping smoking, vaccinations, respiratory rehabilitation, and often inhaled bronchodilators and steroids. Some people may benefit from long-term oxygen therapy or lung transplantation. In those who have periods of acute worsening, increased use of medications and hospitalization may be needed.|$|E
5|$|Pharmacological <b>treatment</b> <b>can</b> help {{to manage}} {{psychiatric}} or behavioral problems. Medication {{is also used}} to control post-traumatic epilepsy; however the preventive use of anti-epileptics is not recommended. In those cases where the person is bedridden due to a reduction of consciousness, has to remain in a wheelchair because of mobility problems, or has any other problem heavily impacting self-caring capacities, caregiving and nursing are critical.|$|E

5|$|Zinc {{serves as}} a simple, inexpensive, and {{critical}} tool for treating diarrheal episodes among children in the developing world. Zinc becomes depleted in the body during diarrhea, but recent studies suggest that replenishing zinc with a 10- to 14-day course of <b>treatment</b> <b>can</b> reduce the duration and severity of diarrheal episodes and may also prevent future episodes {{for as long as}} three months.|$|E
5|$|Allergic symptoms, {{including}} rhinitis, conjunctivitis, and asthma, {{have been}} documented in laboratory animal workers who {{come into contact with}} guinea pigs. Allergic reactions following direct exposure to guinea pigs in domestic settings have also been reported. Two major guinea pig allergens, Cav p I and Cav p II, have been identified in guinea pig fluids (urine and saliva) and guinea pig dander. People who are allergic to guinea pigs are usually allergic to hamsters and gerbils, as well. Allergy shots can successfully treat an allergy to guinea pigs, although <b>treatment</b> <b>can</b> take up to 18 months.|$|E
5|$|HIV {{is spread}} {{primarily}} by unprotected sex (including anal and oral sex), contaminated blood transfusions, hypodermic needles, and from mother to child during pregnancy, delivery, or breastfeeding. Some bodily fluids, such as saliva and tears, do not transmit HIV. Methods of prevention include safe sex, needle exchange programs, treating {{those who are}} infected, and male circumcision. Disease in a baby can often be prevented by giving both the mother and child antiretroviral medication. There is no cure or vaccine; however, antiretroviral <b>treatment</b> <b>can</b> slow {{the course of the}} disease and may lead to a near-normal life expectancy. Treatment is recommended as soon as the diagnosis is made. Without treatment, the average survival time after infection is 11years.|$|E
30|$|The {{inherent}} FR fibers are hydrophobic in nature. The hydrophilic behaviour can {{be increased}} by surface functionalization. γ-ray-, UV- or ozone irradiation {{can be used to}} improve the surface wettability of the aramid fibers. Recently, plasma treatment is becoming popular for surface modification of fibres. Various chemical- and ultrasound <b>treatments</b> <b>can</b> be used for improving the dyeabiity of the FR fibers. However, the ageing of these <b>treatments</b> <b>can</b> reduce the surface functionality.|$|R

5|$|In a large PSP (>50%), or in a PSP {{associated}} with breathlessness, some guidelines recommend that reducing the size by aspiration is equally effective as {{the insertion of}} a chest tube. This involves the administration of local anesthetic and inserting a needle connected to a three-way tap; up to 2.5liters of air (in adults) are removed. If there has been significant reduction {{in the size of}} the pneumothorax on subsequent X-ray, the remainder of the <b>treatment</b> <b>can</b> be conservative. This approach has been shown to be effective in over 50% of cases. Compared to tube drainage, first-line aspiration in PSP reduces the number of people requiring hospital admission, without increasing the risk of complications.|$|E
5|$|The cooling {{properties}} of the leaves were used in Britain {{as a treatment for}} trench foot in World War I, and as compresses for ulcers and breast abscesses. Accumulated scientific evidence corroborates that cabbage leaf <b>treatment</b> <b>can</b> reduce the pain and hardness of engorged breasts, and increase the duration of breast feeding. Other medicinal uses recorded in European folk medicine include treatments for rheumatism, sore throat, hoarseness, colic, and melancholy. In the United States, cabbage {{has been used as a}} hangover cure, to treat abscesses, to prevent sunstroke, or to cool body parts affected by fevers. The leaves have also been used to soothe sore feet and, when tied around a child's neck, to relieve croup. Both mashed cabbage and cabbage juice have been used in poultices to remove boils and treat warts, pneumonia, appendicitis, and ulcers.|$|E
5|$|Based on {{preclinical}} {{research with}} animal and human proteins, bupropion {{has been characterized}} as a weak norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NDRI). It has also been found {{to act as a}} releasing agent of dopamine and norepinephrine (NDRA), similarly to other cathinones. However, when ingested orally by humans, bupropion is extensively converted in the body into several active metabolites with differing activities and influences on the effects of the drug during first-pass metabolism. These metabolites are present in much higher concentrations in the body compared to bupropion itself. The most important example is the major metabolite of bupropion, hydroxybupropion, a selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (and likely releasing agent) and nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) antagonist that lacks significant dopaminergic actions, and which, with oral bupropion <b>treatment,</b> <b>can</b> reach area under the curve (AUC) plasma concentrations that are as much as 16–20times greater than those of bupropion itself. Hence, the effects of bupropion cannot be understood unless its metabolism is also considered.|$|E

5|$|Most beekeepers {{affected}} by CCD {{report that they}} use antibiotics and miticides in their colonies, though the lack of uniformity as to which particular chemicals they use makes it unlikely that any single such chemical is involved. However, {{it is possible that}} not all such chemicals in use have been tested for possible effects on honey bees, and could therefore potentially be contributing to the CCD phenomenon. Beekeepers use miticides to rid colonies of Varroa infestations; however, <b>treatment</b> <b>can</b> lead to higher levels of viral infections in colonies. High doses of treatment or the use of miticides {{for an extended period of}} time can lead to immune-suppression in honey bees, making them more susceptible to viruses. A widespread occurrence of viral infections within a beehive can lead to colony collapse. Although miticides are not a direct cause of CCD they do play a role in it.|$|E
5|$|Narrow/closed angle {{glaucoma}} is an {{autosomal dominant}} inheritable trait in the breed. It {{is a leading}} cause of blindness in dogs, and is where there is increased fluid pressure within the eye. If the fluid is not reduced, the pressure causes permanent damage to the retina and optic nerve. Loss of eyesight can happen as quickly as within 24 hours if the pressure if elevated enough, or slowly over time if it is only a mild elevation. The sudden, rapid elevation of pressure is more common with narrow/closed angle glaucoma which is more common to the breed than the slower open angle glaucoma. Symptoms can include redness in the eye, the eye itself looking cloudy, sensitivity to light and the dog may rub at their eye, or even rub it along other objects and carpet as the condition is moderate to extremely painful. <b>Treatment</b> <b>can</b> vary depending on the severity of the condition but if inherited glaucoma appears in one eye then it usually occurs in the other eye eventually.|$|E
