5|$|After the Angolan War of Independence of 1975, the Soviet Union's role in Third World {{politics}} increased dramatically. Some of {{the regions}} were important for national security, while other regions were important <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>expansion</b> <b>of</b> Soviet socialism to other countries. According to an anonymous Soviet writer, the national liberation struggle was {{the cornerstone of}} Soviet ideology, and therefore became a cornerstone for Soviet diplomatic activity in the Third World.|$|E

5|$|In 1890, the railway's {{arrival in}} Skagen not only led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>expansion</b> <b>of</b> the village but also brought in {{considerable}} numbers of tourists. It was {{largely responsible for}} breaking up the regular summer meetings of the artists as {{they could no longer}} find suitable accommodation or venues for their meetings. However, some of them purchased homes in Skagen: P.S. Krøyer in 1894, Laurits Tuxen in 1901 and Holger Drachmann in 1903.|$|E
5|$|In {{models of}} the {{expanding}} universe, the farther galaxies are from each other, the faster they drift apart. This receding is not due to motion through space, but rather <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>expansion</b> <b>of</b> space itself. For example, galaxies far away from Earth appear to be {{moving away from the}} Earth with a speed proportional to their distances. Beyond a boundary called the Hubble sphere, the rate at which their distance from Earth increases becomes greater than the speed of light.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} years of the 20th century, the North London Line {{suffered}} a reduction in passengers and, especially, revenue, owing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>expansion</b> <b>of</b> the bus, tram and Underground networks. In 1909, the NLR passed general handing of trains to the LNWR. By 1913, numbers had dropped to 44.6 per cent compared to 1900, and by 1921 to only 23.3 percent and the patronage of Broad Street station declined accordingly. On 8 September 1915, the station was damaged by a Zeppelin attack.|$|E

5|$|More recently, the Verrazano–Narrows Bridge, {{built from}} 1959 to 1964, had been {{proposed}} {{to serve as}} the rail link. The 95th Street station was slated to be connected to the bridge, one of the world's longest suspension bridges, because it followed the route of the planned tunnel. However, no space for any tracks was ever built because of Moses's opposition <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>expansion</b> <b>of</b> New York City public transportation.|$|E
5|$|St. John's {{economy is}} {{connected}} to both its role as the provincial capital of Newfoundland and Labrador and to the ocean.

5|$|After Colonel Brigg's {{death in}} 1900, the castle {{passed into the}} hands of the Wearmouth Coal Company about 1908, and from there to the National Coal Board. Due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>expansion</b> <b>of</b> Sunderland in the 1940s, the castle became {{surrounded}} by housing estates including those of Castletown and Hylton Castle. The castle was vandalised and had the lead from its roof stolen. In 1950, due to local pressure and the threat of demolition, the castle and chapel were taken into the care of the Ministry of Works. Due to the advanced decay of the 19th-century alterations, the ministry removed all internal partitions and consolidated the shell to reveal the remaining medieval masonry. The ministry also appointed a full-time custodian and replaced the missing lead roof with roofing felt to make the site waterproof.|$|E

5|$|In Dalmatia, {{the golden}} jackal's diet {{consists}} of mammals, fruits, vegetables, insects, birds and their eggs, grasses and leaves. Jackals change their diet to {{more readily available}} foods. In Serbia, their diet is primarily livestock carcasses that are increasingly prevalent {{due to a lack}} of removal, and this may have led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>expansion</b> <b>of</b> their population. In Hungary, 55% of their diet is composed of common voles and bank voles, and 41% is composed of wild boar carcasses. Information on the diet of the golden jackal in northeastern Italy is scant, but it is known to prey on small roe deer and hares. In Israel, golden jackals are significant predators of snakes; during a poisoning campaign against golden jackals there was an increase in human snakebite reports, but a decrease when the poisoning ceased.|$|E
5|$|Justin Ferrell explores three moral {{sensibilities}} {{that motivated}} activists {{in dealing with}} Yellowstone. First came the utilitarian vision of maximum exploitation of natural resources, characteristic of developers in the late 19th century. Second was the spiritual vision of nature inspired by the Romanticism and the transcendentalists the mid-19th century. The twentieth century saw the biocentric moral vision {{that focuses on the}} health of the ecosystem as theorized by Aldo Leopold, which led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>expansion</b> <b>of</b> federally protected areas and to the surrounding ecosystems.|$|E
5|$|Some redshifts are {{an example}} of the Doppler effect, {{familiar}} in the change of apparent pitches of sirens and frequency of the sound waves emitted by speeding vehicles. A redshift occurs whenever a light source moves away from an observer. A special instance of this is the cosmological redshift, which is due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>expansion</b> <b>of</b> the universe, and sufficiently distant light sources (generally more than a few million light years away) show redshift corresponding to the rate of increase in their distance from Earth. Finally, gravitational redshift is a relativistic effect observed in electromagnetic radiation moving out of gravitational fields. Conversely, a decrease in wavelength is called blueshift and is generally seen when a light-emitting object moves toward an observer or when electromagnetic radiation moves into a gravitational field. However, redshift is a more common term and sometimes blueshift is referred to as negative redshift.|$|E

5|$|Some {{species of}} thrips create galls, almost always in leaf tissue. These may occur as curls, rolls or folds, or as {{alterations}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>expansion</b> <b>of</b> tissues causing distortion to leaf blades. More complex examples cause rosettes, pouches and horns. Most {{of these species}} occur in the tropics and sub-tropics, and the structures of the galls are diagnostic of the species involved. A radiation of thrips species {{seems to have taken}} place on Acacia trees in Australia; some of these species cause galls in the petioles, sometimes fixing two leaf stalks together, while other species live in every available crevice in the bark. In Casuarina in the same country, some species have invaded stems, creating long-lasting woody galls.|$|E
5|$|The British {{demand for}} {{electricity}} increased after the Second World War. In the North East of England this led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>expansion</b> <b>of</b> existing power stations at Dunston and Billingham {{in the late}} 1940s, the two new Stella power stations, {{and the construction of}} two more large stations built at Blyth later in the 1960s. This new generating capacity quickly met the demand for power. The British Electricity Authority were granted permission to construct the Stella North and Stella South power stations in 1951. The two stations were originally projected to cost around £15,000,000.|$|E
5|$|The Cold War led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>expansion</b> <b>of</b> {{national}} defense government programs housed in offices in Northern Virginia near Washington, D.C., and correlative population growth.

5|$|The French Revolution was {{integral}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>expansion</b> <b>of</b> French cuisine, {{because it}} abolished the guild system. This meant anyone could now produce and sell any culinary item he wished. Marie-Antoine Carême {{was born in}} 1784, five years before the Revolution. He spent his younger years working at a pâtisserie until he was discovered by Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord, who would later cook for Napoleon Bonaparte. Prior to his employment with Talleyrand, Carême had become known for his pièces montées, which were extravagant constructions of pastry and sugar architecture.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of the Seattle independent record label Sub Pop is tied closely to Soundgarden, since Sub Pop co-founder Jonathan Poneman funded Soundgarden's early releases, and the band's success led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>expansion</b> <b>of</b> Sub Pop as a serious record label. Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain was a fan of Soundgarden's music, and reportedly Soundgarden's involvement with Sub Pop influenced Cobain to sign Nirvana with the label. Cobain also stated that Soundgarden {{was one of the}} only Seattle bands that he liked along with Tad and Mudhoney. In rare footage in the 2015 documentary , Cobain can be seen impersonating Chris Cornell singing Outshined.|$|E
5|$|The initial accretional heating {{together}} with continued decay of radioactive elements and likely tidal heating {{may have led}} to melting of the ice if an antifreeze like ammonia (in the form of ammonia hydrate) or some salt was present. The melting {{may have led to}} the separation of ice from rocks and formation of a rocky core surrounded by an icy mantle. A layer of liquid water (ocean) rich in dissolved ammonia may have formed at the core–mantle boundary. The eutectic temperature of this mixture is 176K. The ocean, however, is likely to have frozen long ago. The freezing of the water likely led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>expansion</b> <b>of</b> the interior, which may have been responsible for the formation of the canyons and obliteration of the ancient surface. The liquids from the ocean may have been able to erupt to the surface, flooding floors of canyons in the process known as cryovolcanism.|$|E
