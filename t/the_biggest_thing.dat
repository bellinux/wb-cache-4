That's the main thing we were looking for." [...] Podeswa also compared how he shot the scene to The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp by Rembrandt, continuing, [...] "It had a very rich, textual, moody, atmospheric quality. I think we were all in that space for a long time for this scene — while we were shooting all the scenes involving Jon Snow's body, really, but particularly the one where he's resurrected." [...] In another interview Podeswa described how the resurrection would play out on screen, noting [...] "There was much discussion about what that actually was: There's this sense of rebirth and whether it should be a big moment or a small moment. We tried a lot of different things, but it really felt to me, and I think we all agreed, this first gasp of life, like what a baby has when it's born, is kind of what it needed to be. And I just thought he did that so great." ...|$|E
500|$|During a {{press conference}} in Athens after the final, Kalomoira said that [...] "it was an honor... to {{represent}} Greece in this contest" [...] and thanked Greece because they supported her from the first moment she said she would compete. However, she reported later that she had returned to the United States because she felt mistreated by her record label and was not paid for several arrangements she had made with Heaven during her stay in Belgrade and had to pay for many things herself. In an interview with Downtown Magazine, Kalomoira's father stated that she was treated [...] "like dirt" [...] by Heaven Music and that she may or may not continue her singing career, but that it was up to her. In response, Makis Pounetzis, the new CEO of Heaven Music, claimed that he was [...] "surprised" [...] by Kalomoira's remarks and couldn't offer an explanation, though he did say that her contract would be honored should she choose to go back and sing again. Kalomoira returned to Greece in January 2009, and in an interview with Eleni Menegaki, she said that her Eurovision participation was <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> <b>thing</b> that she has done in her career, and that it {{was also one of the}} most personal events in her life that will always be remembered with good memories. [...] When asked if she expected to do so well in the competition, she stated that she had always wanted to do well, but above all she wanted the Greek people to be proud of the performance regardless of how well it did. [...] In the same interview, host Eleni Menegaki stated that many, including herself, viewed Eurovision as a defining point in Kalomoira's career to date: her mature professional performance distanced her from the innocent little girl image associated with her participation in Fame Story.|$|E

I got a lot of great songs on my album. I got songs for women who wanna feel special. I got songs for dudes — if you ever thought my music was too soft, this is one you will enjoy. I got a lot of variety on there, but <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> <b>thing</b> was that opening line on the hook: 'I know way too many people here right now that I didn't know last year'." [...] He went on to explain that the record sums up where he is in his career right now, and called it a [...] "great first impression". Drake did a lot of work for the song and also the album in Jamaica, during which he called the [...] "calm before the storm", and called [...] "Over" [...] the storm. He said, [...] "It's the moment.

[...] He then went to explain that after the album people will be like [...] "he's still human" [...] or [...] "he's still thinking the same way", and said he wanted people to [...] "understand I could have lost it. He said, [...] "'Over' could have been my entire album. Just 'cause that's what this industry and game will do to you if you lose yourself." [...] Drake later said that the song was a [...] "warm-up record". He went on to say, [...] "I love the song. I love the message in the song. It's funny, because 'Over' is the fourth song on the album and it's the turning point in the album. It's like, you get three songs of me sort of trying to paint the picture of what the last year has been like for me — trying to fill you in, almost let you into my world as much as I can. 'Over' is that moment where you're almost worried on the album. 'Is this kid about to ... ? What's happening? Is he changing?' I wanted that to come out first. I wanted people to be a little nervous. This whole journey could have changed me drastically. Fortunately I'm able to step out of my shoes and reflect on it and give you some great music. 'Over' is a great alter-ego moment.
