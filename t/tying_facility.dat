Part of the technology maturation was to test the TDU- 1 thruster in several ground based electrical configurations to assess the thruster robustness and suitability to successful in-space operation. The ground based electrical configuration testing has recently been demonstrated as an important step in understanding and assessing how a Hall thruster may operate differently in space compared to ground based testing, and to determine the best configuration to conduct development and qualification testing. This presentation will cover the electrical configuration testing of the TDU- 1 HERMeS Hall thruster in NASA Glenn Research Centers Vacuum Facility 5.

30|$|Farmers receive indemnity/compensation {{whenever}} relative evapotranspiration falls below 5 % {{of historical}} long-running decadal relative evapotranspiration data. The threshold for full payment is adjusted depending on areas and crop development period. The payouts {{are dependent on}} three specific periods that mimics the different stages of maize production. That is, the first stage that covers 30  days after seeding (1 st of July), the second stage that covers 20  days thereafter, and the last stage covering the last 40  days of maize production (in total 90  days). Thus, the payouts that are proportional to the total covered amount for the three subsequent stages are 30 %, 20 %, and 40 %, respectively (van Asseldonk et al. 2013). Insurance premiums are usually <b>tied</b> to credit <b>facilities</b> but, on the average, farmers {{pay as much as}} 10.8 % of the value of insured inputs plus an insurance tax of 8 % (taking it to 18.8 %).

25|$|Studies {{show that}} this group is shaped by several forces. A major {{influence}} is the fact of frequent moves, as the family follows the military member-parent (or in some cases, both parents who are military members) who is transferred from military base to military base, each move usually being {{hundreds or thousands of}} miles in distance. Other shaping forces include a culture of resilience and adaptivity, constant loss of friendship <b>ties,</b> a <b>facility</b> or knack for making new friends, never having a hometown, and extensive exposure to foreign cultures and languages while living overseas or {{to a wide range of}} regional cultural differences due to living in a variety of different American regions. Additional influences include living in a series of military bases serving as community centers, the pervasive military culture on those bases, the absence of a parent due to deployments, the threat of parental loss in war, stresses associated with the psychological aftermath of war (living with war-affected returning veteran parents) and the militarization of the family unit (children being treated to some degree like soldiers and being subjected to military regimentation, inculcation into a warrior code of honor and service, frequent exposure to patriotic ideas and symbols, experience of free medical care, and military discipline). Military brats receive completely free medical care until their soldier-parent leaves the service (without a full combat related disability) or they reach the age of 21 or age 23 (depending on the parent's branch of service) if enrolled in college full-time.|$|R
5|$|In November 2011, Kaye {{announced}} that particles of pure (unalloyed) titanium {{had also been}} found on the tie.

The findings suggested that Cooper may have been a chemist or a metallurgist, or possibly an engineer or manager (the only employees who wore <b>ties</b> in such <b>facilities</b> at that time) in a metal or chemical manufacturing plant, or at a company that recovered scrap metal from those types of factories. In January 2017, Kaye reported that rare earth minerals such as cerium and strontium sulfide had also been identified among particles from the tie. One of the rare applications for such elements in the 1970s was Boeing's supersonic transport development project, suggesting the possibility that Cooper was a Boeing employee. Other possible sources of the material included plants that manufactured cathode ray tubes, such as the Portland firms Teledyne and Tektronix.|$|R

50|$|SCADA {{systems that}} <b>tie</b> {{together}} decentralized <b>facilities</b> such as power, oil, gas pipelines, water distribution and wastewater collection systems {{were designed to}} be open, robust, and easily operated and repaired, but not necessarily secure. The move from proprietary technologies to more standardized and open solutions together with the increased number of connections between SCADA systems, office networks and the Internet has made them more vulnerable to types of network attacks that are relatively common in computer security. For example, United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT) released a vulnerability advisory warning that unauthenticated users could download sensitive configuration information including password hashes from an Inductive Automation Ignition system utilizing a standard attack type leveraging access to the Tomcat Embedded Web server. Security researcher Jerry Brown submitted a similar advisory regarding a buffer overflow vulnerability in a Wonderware InBatchClient ActiveX control. Both vendors made updates available prior to public vulnerability release. Mitigation recommendations were standard patching practices and requiring VPN access for secure connectivity. Consequently, the security of some SCADA-based systems has come into question as they are seen as potentially vulnerable to cyber attacks.|$|R
40|$|Food {{processing}} {{facilities are}} unique environments with varying {{temporal and spatial}} distributions of food resources. Stored product insects can quickly monopolize available resources and disperse readily to find new ones. Proper sanitation and removal of these food sources {{is an integral part}} of controlling infestations, but the application of sanitation in the food processing industry can be inconsistent. Stronger evidence is needed if facility operators are to incorporate sanitation as a central facet of pest control. This research addressed two fundamental questions. The first focused on the impact that different levels of sanitation, using food abundance as a proxy, have on the movement and distribution patterns of a model insect. Optimal Foraging Theory was used as a framework for interpreting these behaviors, focusing on the impact food abundance had on insect dispersal along a narrow corridor and on population distribution behavior at different temporal and spatial scales. The second question focused on the application of sanitation practices in food processing <b>facilities,</b> <b>tying</b> sanitation level with pest management effectiveness and cost. Optimal Foraging Theory provided a useful framework for interpreting behaviors with increasing food abundance negatively affecting overall dispersal and how widely pest populations distribute themselves. Spatial scale and beetle age also proved to be significant, influencing factors. The relationship between sanitation and pest management in food processing facilities was more complex than expected and may require better employee knowledge to apply properly. A stronger argument can now be made for how significantly sanitation practices impact pest control in food processing facilities, requiring higher levels of sanitation in order to ensure effectiveness of pest management programs. ...|$|R
