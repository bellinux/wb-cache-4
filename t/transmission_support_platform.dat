40|$|With multiple-input, multiple-output (MIMO) transmission, {{impressive}} capacity or diversity gains can {{be achieved}} compared to single antenna systems. We have conceived and implemented a generic platform that enables real-time wireless MIMO <b>transmission.</b> The <b>platform</b> <b>supports</b> the integration and the evaluation of transmit and receive spatial multiplexing and spatial diversity processing techniques for MIMO-OFDM systems in a wireless environment. The platform is based on modular multi-FPGA and multi-board designs with support for high-speed serial connection links between the boards. This paper describes the platform integration of a 2 -antenna base station using MIMO transmit processing including special front-end techniques for the exploitation of channel reciprocity in time division duplex (TDD) schemes. 1...|$|R

Contrary to {{existing}} heterogeneous data integration systems which {{need to be}} fully integrated before using, a Dataspace <b>Support</b> <b>Platform</b> is a self-sustained system which automatically provides for the user its best endeavor results regardless of how integrated its sources are. Therefore, a Dataspace <b>Support</b> <b>Platform</b> needs to <b>support</b> uncertainty in mediated schema and in schema mappings. This paper proposes a novel approach to automatically providing reliable mediated schemas and reliable semantic mappings in Dataspace <b>Support</b> <b>Platforms.</b> Our aim {{is to increase the}} system’s endeavor results by leading it to considering as much as pos-∗ correspondence autho...|$|R

40|$|The survey methodological paper {{addresses}} a glance {{to a general}} decision <b>support</b> <b>platform</b> technology for modular systems (modular/composite alterantives/solutions) in various applied domains. The decision <b>support</b> <b>platform</b> consists of seven basic combinatorial engineering frameworks (system synthesis, system modeling, evaluation, detection of bottleneck, improvement/extension, multistage design, combinatorial evolution and forecasting). The decision <b>support</b> <b>platform</b> is based on decision support procedures (e. g., multicriteria selection/sorting, clustering), combinatorial optimization problems (e. g., knapsack, multiple choice problem, clique, assignment/allocation, covering, spanning trees), and their combinations. The following is described: (1) general scheme of the decision <b>support</b> <b>platform</b> technology; (2) brief descriptions of modular (composite) systems (or composite alternatives); (3) trends in moving from chocie/selection of alternatives to processing of composite alternatives which correspond to hierarchical modular products/systems; (4) scheme of resource requirements (i. e., human, information-computer); and (5) basic combinatorial engineering frameworks and their applications in various domains.

The method can be used not only for static, but also for dynamic leveling systems, such as active suspension. The method assumes identification and dynamics testing of reference units.
