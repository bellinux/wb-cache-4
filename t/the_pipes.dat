5|$|A {{pipe organ}} {{contains}} {{one or more}} sets of pipes, a wind system, and one or more keyboards. <b>The</b> <b>pipes</b> produce sound when pressurized air produced by the wind system passes through them. An action connects the keyboards to <b>the</b> <b>pipes.</b> Stops allow the organist to control which ranks of pipes sound at a given time. The organist operates the stops and the keyboards from the console.|$|E
5|$|However, recent {{research}} {{supports the idea}} that the lead found in the water came from the supply pipes, rather than another source of contamination. It was not unknown for locals to punch holes in <b>the</b> <b>pipes</b> to draw water off, increasing the number of people exposed to the lead.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of pneumatic and electro-pneumatic key {{actions in the}} late 19th century {{made it possible to}} locate the console independently of <b>the</b> <b>pipes,</b> greatly expanding the possibilities in organ design. Electric stop actions were also developed, which allowed sophisticated combination actions to be created.|$|E
30|$|<b>The</b> <b>pipe</b> has two {{open ends}} with a hole near the top. This hole is placed intentionally, {{so that when the}} water enters from the bottom end of <b>the</b> <b>pipe,</b> there is no {{pressure}} due to the compressed air column inside <b>the</b> <b>pipe.</b> This hole helps the water to enter <b>the</b> <b>pipe</b> without any obstruction, and the water stops entering <b>the</b> <b>pipe</b> when <b>the</b> level of water inside <b>the</b> <b>pipe</b> is as <b>the</b> same as what is the outside of <b>the</b> <b>pipe</b> [29].|$|R
50|$|The method uses {{pneumatic}} percussive {{blows to}} drive <b>the</b> <b>pipe</b> through <b>the</b> ground. The {{leading edge of}} <b>the</b> <b>pipe</b> is almost always open, and is typically closed only when smaller pipes are being installed. The shape allows a small overcut (to reduce friction between <b>the</b> <b>pipe</b> and soil and improve load conditions on <b>the</b> <b>pipe),</b> and directs <b>the</b> soil into <b>the</b> <b>pipe</b> interior instead of compacting it outside <b>the</b> <b>pipe.</b> These objectives are usually achieved by attaching a soil-cutting shoe or special bands to <b>the</b> <b>pipe.</b>|$|R

5|$|The girls {{found the}} school's {{distinctive}} Beret difficult to wear, {{so it was}} phased out in 1995. It {{was replaced by the}} current Panama hat, but the Beret was reintroduced in 2003 as an addition to <b>the</b> <b>Pipes</b> and Drums uniform.|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} of the building contains several innovative elements. The partitions between the offices are soundproofed and divided into interchangeable sections, so that the layout of any could be changed quickly and comfortably. <b>The</b> <b>pipes</b> under the floors carry both telephone and electricity cables.|$|E
5|$|The organ {{has four}} manuals, 88speaking stops and 4565pipes. It works {{by way of}} air pressure, {{controlled}} by an electric current and operated by the keys of the organ console; this opens and closes valves within the wind chests, allowing <b>the</b> <b>pipes</b> to speak. This type of motion is called electro-pneumatic action.|$|E
5000|$|Away {{from the}} ends of <b>the</b> <b>pipe,</b> <b>the</b> {{characteristics}} of the flow are independent of the position along <b>the</b> <b>pipe.</b> <b>The</b> key quantities are then the pressure drop along <b>the</b> <b>pipe</b> per unit length, , and the volumetric flow rate. The flow rate {{can be converted to}} a mean flow velocity [...] by dividing by the wetted area of the flow (which equals the cross-sectional area of <b>the</b> <b>pipe</b> if <b>the</b> <b>pipe</b> is full of fluid).|$|R

5|$|The use of {{lead for}} water pipes is {{problematic}} {{in areas with}} soft or acidic water. Hard water forms insoluble layers in <b>the</b> <b>pipes</b> whereas soft and acidic water dissolves the lead pipes. Dissolved {{carbon dioxide in the}} carried water may result in the formation of soluble lead bicarbonate; oxygenated water may similarly dissolve lead as lead(II) hydroxide. Drinking such water, over time, can cause health problems due to the toxicity of the dissolved lead. The harder the water the more calcium bicarbonate and sulfate it will contain, and the more the inside of <b>the</b> <b>pipes</b> will be coated with a protective layer of lead carbonate or lead sulfate.|$|E
5|$|Because {{most of the}} {{pipeline}} was built above permafrost, each of <b>the</b> <b>pipes</b> holding up the raised sections of pipeline contained a sealed tube of ammonia. As the permafrost below {{the pipeline}} warms, the ammonia absorbs the heat and rises to a radiator {{on top of each}} stanchion. The ammonia is cooled by the outside air, condenses, and falls back {{to the bottom of the}} tube, where the process repeats.|$|E
5|$|Built by J.W.Walker and Sons, {{the organ}} was {{completed}} {{only two days}} before the opening of the cathedral in 1967. Made {{as an integral part of}} the new cathedral, the architect, Frederick Gibberd, saw the casework as part of his brief and so designed the striking front to the organ. Using decorative woodwork, Gibberd was inspired by the innovative use of <b>the</b> <b>pipes</b> at Coventry Cathedral and the Royal Festival Hall and so arranged the shiny zinc pipes and brass trumpets en chamade to contrast strikingly with concrete pillars which surround the organ.|$|E
5000|$|The {{resistance}} to the flow of heat by <b>the</b> material of <b>pipe</b> wall can be expressed as a [...] "heat transfer coefficient of <b>the</b> <b>pipe</b> wall". However, one needs to select if the heat flux is based on <b>the</b> <b>pipe</b> inner or <b>the</b> outer diameter.Selecting to base the heat flux on <b>the</b> <b>pipe</b> inner diameter, and assuming that <b>the</b> <b>pipe</b> wall thickness is small in comparison with <b>the</b> <b>pipe</b> inner diameter, then the heat transfer coefficient for <b>the</b> <b>pipe</b> wall can be calculated as if the wall were not curved:where k is the effective thermal conductivity of the wall material and x is the wall thickness.|$|R
40|$|The {{behaviour}} of <b>the</b> buried <b>pipe</b> {{during an}} earthquake was studied in vibrating tests used the shaking table. <b>The</b> buried <b>pipe</b> used was acrylic resins {{and it was}} set to the shaking box filled with dry sand. It is shown that the seismic earth pressure acts on <b>the</b> <b>pipe</b> increases remarkably with increase in depth of sand layer below <b>the</b> <b>pipe,</b> and decreases with increase in sand density. From this experimental result, it is concluded that, when <b>the</b> <b>pipe</b> is buried nearly on the base rock and soil arround <b>the</b> <b>pipe</b> is sufficiently compacted, a damage of <b>the</b> <b>pipe</b> due to seismic force is small. And this conclusion is in excellent agreement with observation made on a damage of <b>the</b> <b>pipe</b> due to an earthquake...|$|R
50|$|Shear rams are {{designed}} to shear <b>the</b> <b>pipe</b> in <b>the</b> well and seal the wellbore simultaneously. It has steel blades to shear <b>the</b> <b>pipe</b> and seals to seal the annulus after shearing <b>the</b> <b>pipe.</b>|$|R
5|$|In Valdez, where Fluor had supervision, {{the work}} also was divided among several contractors. Site {{preparation}} {{work was done}} by Morrison-Knudsen. Chicago Bridge & Iron Company built the tank farms, the tanker berths were built by Kiewest (a venture of Peter Kiewit Sons and Willamette-Western Corporation), and General Electric insulated <b>the</b> <b>pipes.</b> Fluor also had supervision {{of the construction of}} the pumping stations, which were generally built by the contractors working on a specific section of the pipeline.|$|E
5|$|November 2010 saw {{the first}} {{performances}} on the organ after an 18-month renovation by its original builders Harrison & Harrison, costing around £800,000. The organ had been disassembled {{and some of it}} taken away to the builders' workshop in Durham. <b>The</b> <b>pipes</b> were cleaned and the leather of the bellows was replaced. The manuals were also fitted with an electronic panel for storing combinations of stop settings.|$|E
5|$|Octave couplers, which add <b>the</b> <b>pipes</b> {{an octave}} above (super-octave) or below (sub-octave) each note that is played, may operate on one {{division}} only (for example, the Swell super octave, which adds the octave above {{what is being}} played on the Swell to itself), or act as a coupler to another keyboard (for example, the Swell super-octave to Great, which adds to the Great manual {{the ranks of the}} Swell division an octave above what is being played).|$|E
40|$|Discuss {{the motion}} of a zig-zag-shaped pipe that can roll (or slide) without {{friction}} on a horizontal surface, supposing that <b>the</b> <b>pipe</b> is initially filled with water to height h 0 above the horizontal segment (of length L) of <b>the</b> <b>pipe.</b> <b>The</b> water exits <b>the</b> <b>pipe</b> from a vertical segment of height H below the horizontal segment, where H is large enough that the exit velocity of the water from <b>the</b> <b>pipe</b> is vertical in the rest frame of <b>the</b> <b>pipe.</b> This variant of the leaky-tank-car problem [1] was suggested by Johann Otto. ...|$|R
30|$|The {{influence}} of <b>the</b> <b>pipe’s</b> material on ultrasound attenuation is also significant. The received signals {{are more or}} less interfered by the ultrasound waves propagated from <b>the</b> <b>pipe</b> wall—especially when <b>the</b> speed of sound in <b>the</b> <b>pipe</b> wall is greater than the direct wave propagated across the sensing area. The usual way to solve this problem is to place the transducers in <b>the</b> <b>pipe</b> and make full contact with the internal media so that the {{influence of}} <b>the</b> <b>pipe</b> can be eliminated. However, these arrangements are not allowed in some cases. Therefore, a method to suppress the effect of <b>the</b> <b>pipe</b> on <b>the</b> received signal is necessary.|$|R
50|$|Currents bound {{inside the}} atoms of strong magnets can create {{counter-rotating}} currents in a copper or aluminum pipe. This {{is shown by}} dropping the magnet through <b>the</b> <b>pipe.</b> <b>The</b> descent of the magnet inside <b>the</b> <b>pipe</b> is observably slower than when dropped outside <b>the</b> <b>pipe.</b>|$|R
5|$|The first {{crude oil}} arrived at Phoenixville via the Big Inch on August 14, 1943, {{and the first}} refined product in the Little Big Inch arrived on March 2, 1944. The Big Inch carried up to 334,456 barrels of crude oil a day, the Little Big Inch 239,844 barrels of gasoline; the lines were among the largest {{industrial}} consumers of electricity in the US, requiring 3.89 million kilowatt {{hours a day to}} pump the oil along <b>the</b> <b>pipes.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{northern}} {{winter of}} 1962–1963 {{was one of}} the coldest in 100 years; <b>the</b> <b>pipes</b> froze, the children—now two years old and nine months—were often sick, and the house had no telephone. Her depression returned but she completed the rest of her poetry collection which would be published after her death (1965 in the UK, 1966 in the US). Her only novel, The Bell Jar, was released in January 1963, published under the pen name Victoria Lucas, and was met with critical indifference.|$|E
5|$|The {{pipe organ}} is a musical {{instrument}} that produces sound by driving pressurized air (called wind) through organ pipes selected via a keyboard. Because each pipe produces a single pitch, <b>the</b> <b>pipes</b> are provided in sets called ranks, {{each of which has}} a common timbre and volume throughout the keyboard compass. Most organs have multiple ranks of pipes of differing timbre, pitch, and volume that the player can employ singly or in combination through the use of controls called stops.|$|E
5000|$|V.B. Gandhi {{was a huge}} {{admirer of}} <b>the</b> <b>pipe</b> and was well versed on the subject. Vithal {{developed}} a great liking for <b>the</b> <b>pipe</b> {{as he saw it}} as a symbol of [...] "democracy". He opined that <b>the</b> <b>pipe</b> was not only for the affluent but for all, as <b>the</b> <b>pipe</b> would pass from hand to hand without discriminating on any basis.|$|R
50|$|The Clerk of <b>the</b> <b>Pipe</b> was a post in <b>the</b> <b>Pipe</b> Office of <b>the</b> English Exchequer and its successors. The {{incumbent}} {{was responsible}} for <b>the</b> <b>pipe</b> rolls on which the government income and expenditure was recorded as credits and debits.|$|R
5000|$|Ice Pigging uses {{less water}} than {{traditional}} <b>pipe</b> cleaning methods. <b>The</b> Pig is pushed through <b>the</b> <b>pipe</b> using just one pipe volume {{of water and}} then <b>the</b> <b>pipe</b> is flushed {{for a short period}} returning the water quality to its usual limits typically using 1/4 to 1/2 of <b>the</b> <b>pipe</b> volume, Total water usage is therefore typically 1.5 times the volume of <b>the</b> <b>pipe</b> to be cleaned.|$|R
5|$|A serious {{accident}} with radioactivity release {{occurred in the}} 3026-D facility at about 5 pm on 29 April 1954. After {{the dissolution of the}} third batch of uranium slugs, the liquid in the dissolver tank did not completely cover the slugs for about 29 hours, which overheated due to decay heat. When the acid was added for the fourth batch, the violent reaction with the hot metal produced gases and forced the solution up the slug loading chute and <b>the</b> <b>pipes.</b> The building staff donned their gas masks and evacuated the building. Radiation levels {{on the third floor of}} the building reached 100roentgen per hour (R/h), and were reduced to 100mR/h by 7 am the next day. The highest exposure to a person was 1.25R of hard radiation and 4.7roentgen equivalent physical of soft radiation.|$|E
5|$|Despite Peter's {{insistence that}} he is fit to {{continue}} to be the leader of the new community, the townspeople run him out of New Quahog, and his family follows him. Meanwhile, the eggs that stewie laid up hatch, revealing the octopus-Stewies. The citizens proceeds to burn the guns Peter had made with <b>the</b> <b>pipes</b> {{in the middle of the}} town square, but as the final gun in thrown onto the pile, hundreds of newly spawned Octopus-Stewies begin to destroy the city, with the townspeople unable to protect themselves from the mutants. As the family walks away, oblivious to the town's destruction, they decide to continue to a Carvel factory in Framingham.|$|E
5|$|In total, 36% of all {{materials}} and labour costs were spent in Wales, with approximately 1,000tonnes (157,500 stone) of Welsh slate used. The environmental {{features of the}} building have allowed energy savings of between 30% and 50% compared to buildings without these features. The features include 27 pipes that were drilled 100m below ground, so that during cold spells, water is pumped through <b>the</b> <b>pipes</b> and heated to 14°C by geothermal energy. The hot water is then pumped {{back up to the}} slate floor to warm the building to a constant temperature. In warm spells, the same system helps to keep the building cool. A biomass boiler was installed to use wood chips from recycled waste wood to heat the building, and rainwater is collected from the roof to flush the toilets in the building.|$|E
50|$|Probably will be {{the first}} bending process used on cold pipes and tubing. In this process a die {{in the shape of the}} bend is pressed against <b>the</b> <b>pipe</b> forcing <b>the</b> <b>pipe</b> to fit <b>the</b> shape of the bend. Because <b>the</b> <b>pipe</b> is not {{supported}} internally there is some deformation of the shape of <b>the</b> <b>pipe</b> giving an oval cross section. This process is used where a consistent cross section of <b>the</b> <b>pipe</b> is not required. Although a single die can produce various shapes, it only works for one size tube and radius.|$|R
30|$|Ground {{movement}} {{induced by}} slope instability {{can be classified}} as shallow or deep-seated depending on the geometry and geotechnical conditions of the slope [7]. The interaction between a buried pipe and a moving slope {{is a function of}} <b>the</b> <b>pipe</b> orientation with respect to the slope. When <b>the</b> <b>pipe</b> axis is normal to the direction of soil movement, <b>the</b> <b>pipe</b> is subjected to lateral forces resulting in bending stresses and shear forces in <b>the</b> <b>pipe</b> wall. When <b>the</b> <b>pipe</b> is parallel to the slope, tensile or compressive stresses are induced in <b>the</b> <b>pipe</b> due to <b>the</b> slope movement. This study focuses on estimating the axial load on a pipe subjected to relative axial soil movement.|$|R
50|$|The {{spring is}} pushed into <b>the</b> <b>pipe</b> until its center is roughly where the bend is to be. A length of {{flexible}} wire can {{be attached to}} the end of the spring to facilitate its removal. <b>The</b> <b>pipe</b> is generally held against the flexed knee, and the ends of <b>the</b> <b>pipe</b> are pulled up to create the bend. To make it easier to retrieve the spring from <b>the</b> <b>pipe,</b> it is a good idea to bend <b>the</b> <b>pipe</b> slightly more than required, and then slacken it off a little. They are less cumbersome than rotary benders, but are not suitable for bending short lengths of piping when it is difficult to get the required leverage on <b>the</b> <b>pipe</b> ends.|$|R
