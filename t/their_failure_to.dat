5|$|CENIPA {{concluded}} that the ExcelAire pilots {{also contributed to the}} accident with, among others, <b>their</b> <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> recognize that their transponder was inadvertently switched off, thereby disabling the collision avoidance system on both aircraft, as well as their overall insufficient training and preparation.|$|E

5|$|The {{discovery}} of Gliese 3634 b {{was reported in}} the journal Astronomy and Astrophysics on February 8, 2011. Gliese 3634 b was the first planet discovered by the astronomers after adopting their new strategy, despite <b>their</b> <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> find a transit event for the planet.|$|E

50|$|In Week 1, {{there was}} no elimination. Subsequently, Mawi and Marsha were chosen by the Principal to be re-entered into the {{competition}} through 'AFSERAP', after <b>their</b> <b>failures</b> <b>to</b> be chosen in Prelude Concert.|$|R
5000|$|... {{describes}} {{whether the}} cause is perceived as static or dynamic over time. It {{is closely related to}} expectations and goals, in that when people attribute <b>their</b> <b>failures</b> <b>to</b> stable factors such as the difficulty of a task, they will expect to fail in that task in the future.|$|R
5|$|Classical Athenian girls {{probably}} reached menarche {{at about}} age fourteen, {{when they would}} have married. Girls who died before marriage were mourned for <b>their</b> <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> reach maturity. Memorial vases for dead girls in classical Athens often portrayed them dressed as brides, and were sometimes shaped like loutrophoroi (vases which held water used to bathe before the wedding day).|$|E
5|$|Terry Pratchett {{was pleased}} with the 1986 {{interactive}} fiction game The Colour of Magic, but criticised its poor marketing. He was reluctant to grant Discworld licences due to concern for the series, and wanted a reputable company who cared about the property. Other video game companies had previously approached Pratchett seeking a licence. One such company was AdventureSoft, and <b>their</b> <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> obtain a Discworld licence {{led to the creation of}} Simon the Sorcerer, which took inspiration from the Discworld series of books.|$|E
5|$|The Pirates {{have failed}} once in signing a draft pick. This {{occurred}} in 2012, when the Pirates selected RHP Mark Appel from Stanford University, who sought a significant bonus which, {{according to new}} MLB rules, would have cost the Pirates a future draft pick. The Pirates will receive the 9th overall pick in the 2013 draft for <b>their</b> <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> sign Appel.|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} <b>to</b> <b>their</b> <b>failures</b> <b>to</b> {{prevent the}} Osirak attack (and the earlier H-3 attack), Saddam Hussein ordered {{the execution of}} the head of Iraq's Western Air Defense Zone, Colonel Fakhri Hussein Jaber and all officers under his command above the rank of major. In addition, 23 other Iraqi pilots and officers were imprisoned.|$|R
5|$|In the novel, Miranda {{has many}} {{similarities}} to Wintour—among them, she is British, has two children, and {{is described as}} a major contributor to the Met. Priestly is a tyrant who makes impossible demands of her subordinates, gives them almost none of the information or time necessary to comply and then berates them for <b>their</b> <b>failures</b> <b>to</b> do so.|$|R
50|$|Ernst Kretschmer {{emphasized}} the sensitive inner {{core of the}} paranoia-prone personality: they feel shy and inadequate {{but at the same}} time they have an attitude of entitlement. They attribute <b>their</b> <b>failures</b> <b>to</b> the machinations of others but secretly to their own inadequacy. They experience constant tension between feelings of self-importance and experiencing the environment as unappreciative and humiliating.|$|R
5|$|Although a {{state of}} {{hostilities}} existed between the Mam and the K'iche' of Q'umarkaj after the rebellion of the Kaqchikel against their former K'iche' allies prior to European contact, when the conquistadors arrived there was {{a shift in the}} political landscape. Pedro de Alvarado described how the Mam king Kayb'il B'alam was received with great honour in Q'umarkaj while he was there. The expedition against Zaculeu was apparently initiated after K'iche' bitterness at <b>their</b> <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> contain the Spanish at Q'umarkaj, with the plan to trap the conquistadors in the city having been suggested to them by the Mam king, Kayb'il B'alam; the resulting execution of the K'iche' kings was viewed as unjust. The K'iche' suggestion of marching on the Mam was quickly taken up by the Spanish.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from the}} cordite handling, {{the battle was}} mostly inconclusive, though both the British {{flagship}} Lion and Seydlitz were severely damaged. Lion lost speed, causing her to fall behind {{the rest of the}} battleline, and Beatty was unable to effectively command his ships {{for the remainder of the}} engagement. A British signalling error allowed the German battlecruisers to withdraw, as most of Beatty's squadron mistakenly concentrated on the crippled armoured cruiser Blücher, sinking her with great loss of life. The British blamed <b>their</b> <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> win a decisive victory on their poor gunnery and attempted to increase their rate of fire by stockpiling unprotected cordite charges in their ammunition hoists and barbettes.|$|E
5|$|Despite <b>their</b> <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> score any hits, the American torpedo attacks {{achieved}} {{three important}} results. First, {{they kept the}} Japanese carriers off balance and unable to prepare and launch their own counterstrike. Second, the poor control of the Japanese combat air patrol (CAP) meant {{they were out of}} position for subsequent attacks. Third, many of the Zeros ran low on ammunition and fuel. The appearance of a third torpedo plane attack from the southeast by VT-3 from Yorktown at 10:00 very quickly drew the majority of the Japanese CAP to the southeast quadrant of the fleet. Better discipline, and the employment of a greater number of Zeroes for the CAP might have enabled Nagumo to prevent (or at least mitigate) the damage caused by the coming American attacks.|$|E

50|$|Success and Failure {{states the}} fact that all {{students}} need to be successful if they are to build the confidence and capacity to take risks and meet increasingly difficult challenges.

5|$|Following Australia's {{unlikely}} win at Headingley, the England selectors {{were widely}} condemned for <b>their</b> <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> choose a specialist wrist spinner {{to exploit the}} turning pitch. This was cited {{as a reason for}} the hosts' loss, as the part-timer Compton was able to trouble the batsmen and generate opportunities for wickets, only to see them foregone because of missed catches and stumpings. In response, the English selectors made four changes to the team for the Fifth Test, one of these being the inclusion of leg spinner Eric Hollies. Their frequent changes to the team meant the hosts used a total of 21 players for the five Tests, and the repeated changes to personnel resulted in heavy criticism.|$|E
5|$|In {{the course}} of the war, the camp was staffed by 7,000 members of the German Schutzstaffel (SS), {{approximately}} 12 percent of whom were later convicted of war crimes. Some, including camp commandant Rudolf Höss, were executed. The Allied Powers refused to believe early reports of the atrocities at the camp, and <b>their</b> <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> bomb the camp or its railways remains controversial. One hundred forty-four prisoners are known to have escaped from Auschwitz successfully, and on 7 October 1944, two Sonderkommando units—prisoners assigned to staff the gas chambers—launched a brief, unsuccessful uprising.|$|E
5|$|Mickl {{remained}} {{in charge of}} the 42nd Panzerjäger Battalion during the invasion. He got along well with Rommel, and his battalion fought well but suffered serious casualties during the Battle of Arras on 21 May while trying to stop the heavily armoured tanks of the British 1st Army Tank Brigade with its 37 mm anti-tank guns. His soldiers derided their guns as Panzeranklopfgerät (tank-door knocker), due to <b>their</b> <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> penetrate the British Matilda I and Matilda II tanks. Mickl's battalion tried to protect the exposed flank of the division, but was overrun. The situation was saved by anti-aircraft guns and field artillery which were able to knock out the British tanks with direct fire.|$|E
5000|$|Prior {{state court}} rulings had {{overturned}} racial zoning ordinances {{on grounds of}} the [...] "takings clause" [...] because of <b>their</b> <b>failures</b> <b>to</b> grandfather land that had been owned prior to enactment. The Court, in Buchanan, ruled that the motive for the Louisville ordinance, separation of races for purported reasons, was an inappropriate exercise of police power, and its insufficient purpose also made it unconstitutional.|$|R
50|$|Emperor Taizong ordered another retreat {{following}} the Song armies' defeats by Yelü Xiuge and Yelü Xiezhen. The {{failure of the}} second campaign was attributed to the miscommunication between the three armies and <b>their</b> <b>failures</b> <b>to</b> operate together. Besides, Emperor Taizong had also restricted the decisions of his generals as he had arbitrarily planned the whole campaign against Liao and his generals had to adhere to his orders strictly. These <b>failures</b> led <b>to</b> internal rebellions which were crushed swiftly.|$|R
2500|$|Prominent {{blacks in}} Duluth {{complained that the}} city had not {{protected}} the circus workers. The mayor, Commissioner of Public Safety and police chief were criticized for <b>their</b> <b>failures</b> <b>to</b> break up the mob before it had gotten so powerful. A special grand jury was called to investigate the lynchings. It said that Murnian was [...] "not competent" [...] and the police department {{was in need of}} a [...] "thorough overhauling".|$|R
5|$|Ranko Marijan, the Justice Minister {{in a new}} government, criticised his {{predecessors}} and the police for <b>their</b> <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> pursue the case, but the authorities failed to protect Levar, who was murdered by car bomb on 30 August 2000. The investigation of the killings in Gospić was a contributing factor in the criticism of the government's efforts by seven active duty and five retired Croatian generals who issued the Twelve Generals' Letter making their grievance public. That led to sacking of the seven active duty officers, including by President Stjepan Mesić. The group included Norac, who had held the rank of major general since September 1995.|$|E
5|$|Section 4 of the Act {{includes}} new {{provisions to}} cover this sort of situation. Section 4(1) establishes a general duty to repair and maintain the property, owed by the landlord to anyone who could reasonably {{be expected to be}} harmed by a breach; this includes tenants, their friends and family and also trespassers. This duty applies when a landlord ought to have known of a defect, not just when he has been informed of a defect. Additionally, a landlord who merely has the right to repair property rather than an obligation to do so may still be found liable, if one of the groups described in Section 4 was harmed by <b>their</b> <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> repair.|$|E
5|$|She and Leopold {{married in}} a {{religious}} ceremony five days before his death, though <b>their</b> <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> perform a civil ceremony rendered the marriage void under Belgian law. After the king's death, it was soon discovered that he had left Caroline numerous properties, items of high material value, Congolese bonds, and other valuable sources of income – all of which turned her into a multimillionaire. For years the Belgian government and Leopold's three estranged daughters attempted to recover some of this wealth, with their success varying depending on the case. Caroline died on 12 February 1948 in Cambo-les-Bains, France.|$|E

5000|$|A self-serving bias {{refers to}} people's {{tendency}} to attribute their successes to internal factors but attribute <b>their</b> <b>failures</b> <b>to</b> external. This bias {{helps to explain}} why we tend {{to take credit for}} our successes while often denying any responsibility for failures. For example, a tennis player who wins his match might say, [...] "I won because I'm a good athlete," [...] whereas the loser might say, [...] "I lost because the referee was unfair." ...|$|R
5|$|The National Transportation Safety Board {{determines that}} the {{probable}} {{cause of this}} accident was the flight crew members' failure to use available cues and aids to identify the airplane's location on the airport surface during taxi and <b>their</b> <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> cross-check and verify that the airplane was on the correct runway before takeoff. Contributing to the accident were the flight crew's nonpertinent conversations during taxi, {{which resulted in a}} loss of positional awareness and the Federal Aviation Administration's failure to require that all runway crossings be authorized only by specific air traffic control clearances.|$|E
5|$|There is {{a general}} rule that a {{landlord}} who leases a property is not liable for nuisances created after the occupier takes control of the land. There is an exception where the lease is granted for a purpose which constitutes a nuisance, as in Tetley v Chitty, or where the nuisance is caused by <b>their</b> <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> repair the premises, as in Wringe v Cohen. The landlord is also liable were the nuisance existed before the land was let, and he knew or ought to have known about it. Under the principle of vicarious liability, an occupier of land can also be liable {{for the actions of}} their employees; in Matania v National Provincial Bank, it was also established that they could be liable for the activities of independent contractors under certain circumstances.|$|E
5|$|Ulrezaj reappears {{several years}} later, {{residing}} on Aiur {{where he is}} manipulating a faction of Protoss survivors who were not evacuated. Ulrezaj uses these Protoss to attempt to capture a Terran archaeologist, Jacob Ramsey, who has the powerful mind of a Protoss archivist, Zamara, residing in his own mind; <b>their</b> <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> do so leads to Ulrezaj personally trying to take Ramsey, but the archaeologist escapes through a warp gate while both Zerg and Valerian Mengsk's forces also attempt to capture him. Ulrezaj traces Ramsey to Ehlna, breaking through the defenses of both the Protoss and the Dominion. However, Zamara uses her last energy to lock Ulrezaj's mind into a storage crystal, sacrificing herself to keep Ulrezaj trapped.|$|E
