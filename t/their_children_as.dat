40|$|BACKGROUND: There is {{a plethora}} of cross {{sectional}} work on maternal perceptions of child weight status showing that mothers typically do not classify <b>their</b> overweight <b>child</b> <b>as</b> being overweight according to commonly used clinical criteria. Awareness of overweight in <b>their</b> <b>child</b> is regarded <b>as</b> an important prerequisite for mothers to initiate appropriate action. The {{gap in the literature}} is determining whether, if mothers do classify <b>their</b> overweight <b>child's</b> weight status correctly, this is associated with a positive outcome for the child's body mass index (BMI) at a later stage. OBJECTIVE: To explore longitudinal perceptions of child weight status from mothers of a contemporary population-based birth cohort (Gateshead Millennium Study) and relationships of these perceptions with future child weight gain. METHODS: Data collected in the same cohort at 7, 12 and 15 years of age: mothers' responses to two items concerning <b>their</b> <b>child's</b> body size; child's and mother's BMI; pubertal maturation; demographic information. RESULTS: Mothers' perceptions of whether <b>their</b> <b>child</b> was overweight did not change markedly over time. Child BMI was the only significant predictor of mothers' classification of overweight status, and it was only at the extreme end of the overweight range and in the obese range that mothers reliably described <b>their</b> <b>child</b> <b>as</b> overweight. Even when mothers did appropriately classify <b>their</b> <b>child</b> <b>as</b> overweight at an earlier stage, this was not related to relatively lower child BMI a few years later. CONCLUSIONS: Mothers tend to classify <b>their</b> <b>child</b> <b>as</b> overweight in only more extreme cases. It is an important finding that no beneficial impact was shown on later child BMI in overweight children whose mothers classified <b>their</b> <b>child's</b> weight status <b>as</b> overweight at an earlier stage.

40|$|This {{investigation}} explored how parent personality, {{division of}} labor, maternal gatekeeping, and child temperament predicted undermining coparenting. Parent characteristics were assessed {{during the third}} trimester of pregnancy. Parent and child characteristics were assessed at 3 months and at 1 year. Undermining coparenting was observed at 3 years. Couples in which fathers were higher on negative affect or higher on positive affect displayed more undermining coparenting. Families showed greater undermining coparenting if they divided household and child care tasks unevenly and perceived <b>their</b> <b>child</b> <b>as</b> difficult. Mothers??? encouragement of father involvement was associated with less undermining coparenting if parents perceived <b>their</b> <b>child</b> <b>as</b> difficult. There was a significant interaction between fathers??? depressive symptoms and child difficult temperament; couples who perceived <b>their</b> <b>child</b> <b>as</b> more difficult and in which fathers reported experiencing more depressive symptoms later exhibited higher levels of undermining coparenting. In general, child difficult temperament was {{not directly related to}} undermining coparenting, but moderated the association between other predictors and undermining coparenting. This study points to the need for further research into the role parents??? and children???s characteristic play in influencing coparenting quality...|$|R

25|$|According to Statistics Finland, Swedish is {{the mother}} tongue of about 270,000 people in {{mainland}} Finland and of about 25,000 people in Åland, a self-governing archipelago of islands off {{the west coast of}} Finland, where Swedish speakers constitute a majority. Swedish-speakers comprise 5.4% of the total Finnish population or about 4.9% without Åland. The proportion has been steadily diminishing since the early 19th century, when Swedish was the mother tongue of approximately 15% of the population and considered a prestige language. According to a statistical analysis made by Fjalar Finnäs, the population of the minority group is today stable and may even be increasing slightly in total numbers since more parents from bilingual families tend to register <b>their</b> <b>children</b> <b>as</b> Swedish speakers. It is estimated that 70% of bilingual families—that is, ones with one parent Finnish-speaking and the other Swedish-speaking—register <b>their</b> <b>children</b> <b>as</b> Swedish-speaking.|$|E

25|$|During {{most of the}} 20th century, marriages across {{language}} borders {{tended to}} result in children becoming Finnish speakers, and knowledge of Swedish declined. During the last decades the trend has been reversed: many bilingual families chose to register <b>their</b> <b>children</b> <b>as</b> Swedish speakers and put their children in Swedish schools. One motive is the language skills needed during their professional lives. Population statistics do not recognize bilingualism.|$|E

Christian parents were taught to regard <b>their</b> <b>children</b> <b>as</b> gifts from God, and were required to educate them. Arranged child marriages and the neglect of daughters (who were often regarded as less desirable than sons in Asian culture) were prohibited.|$|E

25|$|Socioeconomic {{status of}} mothers likely has a larger {{influence}} on breastfeeding adherence than race or ethnicity, {{as many women}} {{who are members of}} groups with low breastfeeding rates also have a low socioeconomic status. Among women born in the United States, women who are wealthier are more likely to breastfeed. In addition, employment can influence the decision to breastfeed. When either parent was unemployed or held a lower-status occupation (such as labor or sales), their children were more likely to never have been breastfed. In addition, women with public insurance or with no health insurance are more likely to never have breastfed <b>their</b> <b>children,</b> <b>as</b> are women who receive WIC.|$|E
