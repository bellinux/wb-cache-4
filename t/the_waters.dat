5|$|<b>The</b> <b>waters</b> of Buffalo Creek are {{slightly}} acidic, with a pH ranging between 5.0 and 6.7. Metals such as magnesium {{have been observed}} in <b>the</b> <b>waters.</b> Nonmetals in the water include dissolved oxygen, calcium carbonate, suspended solids, and phosphorus.|$|E
5|$|There {{are large}} {{quantities}} of dissolved iron and aluminum in <b>the</b> <b>waters</b> of Mahanoy Creek.

5|$|Anions in <b>the</b> <b>waters</b> of the Black Creek {{drainage}} basin include sulfate and bicarbonate. The concentrations of aluminum {{in the mine}} pools {{in the area are}} typically very low or nonexistent. However, some mine waters in the watershed can have aluminum ion concentrations of over 70 milligrams per liter, forming 6 percent of total dissolved solids in the water, as measured by weight. The concentration of manganese ions in <b>the</b> <b>waters</b> can be over 100 milligrams per liter and calcium also occurs in groundwater in the watershed. Magnesium occurs in the non-polluted groundwater in the watershed in concentrations of 1 to 5 milligrams per liter and occurs in polluted groundwater at concentrations of 4 to 440 milligrams per liter.|$|E
30|$|For a five spot well pattern at {{the early}} stage of development, the non-producing {{reserves}} area exists between <b>the</b> <b>water</b> wells, and high speed and low potential area is first formed near <b>the</b> <b>water</b> wells.

When <b>the</b> <b>water</b> cut reaches 95 %, <b>the</b> invalid <b>water</b> circulation area forms near <b>the</b> <b>water</b> wells.|$|R
2500|$|If {{there is}} no pore water flow {{occurring}} in the soil, <b>the</b> pore <b>water</b> pressures will be hydrostatic. <b>The</b> <b>water</b> table {{is located at the}} depth where <b>the</b> <b>water</b> pressure is equal to the atmospheric pressure.

50|$|When {{water in}} a {{circular}} bowl or cup is moving in circular motion <b>the</b> <b>water</b> displays vortex flow - <b>the</b> <b>water</b> at <b>the</b> center of the bowl or cup spins at relatively high speed, and <b>the</b> <b>water</b> at <b>the</b> perimeter spins more slowly. <b>The</b> <b>water</b> is a little deeper at the perimeter {{and a little more}} shallow at the center, and the surface of <b>the</b> <b>water</b> is not flat but displays the characteristic depression toward the axis of the spinning fluid. At any elevation within <b>the</b> <b>water</b> <b>the</b> pressure is a little greater near the perimeter of the bowl or cup where <b>the</b> <b>water</b> is a little deeper, than near <b>the</b> center. <b>The</b> <b>water</b> pressure is a little greater where <b>the</b> <b>water</b> speed is a little slower, and the pressure is a little less where the speed is faster, and this is consistent with Bernoulli's principle.|$|R

25|$|Under certain conditions, {{the height}} of <b>the</b> <b>water</b> table {{influences}} <b>the</b> <b>water</b> balance components.

40|$|This {{paper will}} mainly talk about best scheme for <b>the</b> <b>water</b> {{purification}} {{project of the}} Lake. The engineering used <b>the</b> <b>water</b> diversion metabolism method to purify <b>the</b> <b>water.</b> If <b>the</b> lake area and <b>the</b> <b>water</b> volume are small, the metabolic cycle is relatively short; if the lake area and <b>the</b> <b>water</b> volume are large, the metabolic cycle is relatively long. Simultaneously, <b>the</b> larger <b>the</b> <b>water</b> flow is, <b>the</b> shorter the metabolic cycle period is and the higher the average metabolic rate is. The process of <b>the</b> <b>water</b> metabolism is {{in agreement with the}} direction of <b>the</b> <b>water</b> flow movement.

5|$|Soon {{after the}} island's formation, seals were seen around the island. They soon began basking there, {{particularly}} on the northern spit, which grew as the waves eroded the island. Seals {{were found to be}} breeding on the island in 1983, and a group of up to 70 made the island their breeding spot. Grey seals are more common on the island than harbour seals, but both are now well established. The presence of seals attracts orcas, which are frequently seen in <b>the</b> <b>waters</b> around the Vestmannaeyjar archipelago and now frequent <b>the</b> <b>waters</b> around Surtsey.|$|E
2500|$|In <b>the</b> {{adjacent}} diagram, <b>water</b> pumped from <b>the</b> tower basin is <b>the</b> cooling <b>water</b> {{routed through}} <b>the</b> process coolers and condensers {{in an industrial}} facility. [...] <b>The</b> cool <b>water</b> absorbs heat from the hot process streams which need to be cooled or condensed, and the absorbed heat warms <b>the</b> circulating <b>water</b> (C). <b>The</b> warm <b>water</b> returns to <b>the</b> top of the cooling tower and trickles downward over the fill material inside the tower. [...] As it trickles down, it contacts ambient air rising up through the tower either by natural draft or by forced draft using large fans in the tower. That contact causes {{a small amount of}} <b>the</b> <b>water</b> to be lost as windage/drift (W) and some of <b>the</b> <b>water</b> (E) to evaporate. The heat required to evaporate <b>the</b> <b>water</b> is derived from <b>the</b> <b>water</b> itself, which cools <b>the</b> <b>water</b> back to <b>the</b> original basin <b>water</b> temperature and <b>the</b> <b>water</b> is then ready to recirculate. <b>The</b> evaporated <b>water</b> leaves its dissolved salts behind in the bulk of <b>the</b> <b>water</b> which has not been evaporated, thus raising the salt concentration in <b>the</b> circulating cooling <b>water.</b> To prevent <b>the</b> salt concentration of <b>the</b> <b>water</b> from becoming too high, a portion of <b>the</b> <b>water</b> is drawn off/blown down (D) for disposal. Fresh water make-up (M) is supplied to the tower basin to compensate for the loss of evaporated <b>water,</b> <b>the</b> windage loss <b>water</b> and <b>the</b> draw-off <b>water.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Influence of <b>the</b> <b>water</b> table When a {{soil layer}} is above <b>the</b> <b>water</b> table, {{it is not}} {{saturated}} and does {{not contribute to the}} transmissivity. When the soil layer is entirely below <b>the</b> <b>water</b> table, its saturated thickness corresponds to the thickness of the soil layer itself. When <b>the</b> <b>water</b> table is inside a soil layer, the saturated thickness corresponds to the distance of <b>the</b> <b>water</b> table to <b>the</b> bottom of the layer. As <b>the</b> <b>water</b> table may behave dynamically, this thickness may change from place to place or from time to time, so that the transmissivity may vary accordingly. In a semi-confined aquifer, <b>the</b> <b>water</b> table is found within a soil layer with a negligibly small transmissivity, so that changes of the total transmissivity (...) resulting from changes in the level of <b>the</b> <b>water</b> table are negligibly small. When pumping water from an unconfined aquifer, where <b>the</b> <b>water</b> table is inside a soil layer with a significant transmissivity, <b>the</b> <b>water</b> table may be drawn down whereby the transmissivity reduces and <b>the</b> flow of <b>water</b> to <b>the</b> well diminishes.|$|R
