25|$|The 2002-2003 renovation, by Rothschild Doyno Collaborative of Pittsburgh's Strip District, showcased an {{existing}} two-story arched window that is visible at night for miles around. The four-leaf medieval quatrefoil medallion {{at the top}} of the Cathedral is a central motif in the design of the Honors College. Stained glass behind <b>the</b> <b>reception</b> <b>desk</b> at the center of the space was designed by Glenn Greene Glass of Regent Square and centers on a design representing the four seasons, done in polished agate.

50|$|The museum {{consisted}} of galleries rising around a central, skylighted atrium. Its external structure featured a central 130 ft tall cylinder, and a stepped-back stone facade. Botta's interior design {{was marked by}} alternating bands of polished and flame-finished black granite on the floor, ground-level walls, and column bases; and bands of natural and black-stained wood on <b>the</b> <b>reception</b> <b>desks</b> and coat-check desk.|$|R

Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) [...] "dies" [...] of boredom, and Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer) revives him by calling him to <b>the</b> <b>reception</b> <b>desk</b> and {{throwing}} objects into Dwight's coffee mug. Jim discovers that his co-workers have their own office games, such as Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) [...] "Dunderball", and Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) and Oscar Martinez's (Oscar Nunez) [...] "paper football flicking and hitting" [...] game. Jim and Pam organize the Games of the First Dunder-Mifflin Olympiad, competing for hand-made medals constructed from yogurt lids and paper clips.|$|E
500|$|The porte-cochère of {{the hotel}} {{featured}} three great sharp-edged pillars jutting {{out in front of}} the glass-fronted building, angling down into the ground, which resembled fins. The two-story glass walled entry was bordered by a wall of imported Italian marble, and above the entrance area was a horizontal plane with copper lights suspended from the beams. [...] Rather than being polished, the marble was unusual in that it was rough and grained. Natural and stained cork was used throughout the building. A.J. Leibling of The New Yorker described the hotel in 1953: [...] "The main building of the Sands is a great rectangular hall, with <b>the</b> <b>reception</b> <b>desk</b> in one corner, slot machines along one long wall and a bar and cocktail lounge, complete with Latin trio, along the opposite wall. In the middle is a jumble of roulette and craps tables and 21 layouts." [...] The casino, of substantial size, was accessed by three sets of terrazzo stairs, and was lit by low-hanging chandeliers. The bar featured bas-reliefs with a Western theme, including cowboys, racing wagons and Joshua trees, designed by Allan Stewart of Claremont College, California. The Garden Room restaurant overlooked the hotel's pool and landscaped grounds.|$|E

500|$|The FBI {{already had}} the lodge under {{investigation}} at the time due to the connection to Joseph P. Kennedy, Sr., who was staying {{there at the time}} that Sinatra's deal was finalized. There were concerns that Kennedy was involved in the arrangement of a casino for use by the American mafia. [...] The FBI suspected that the expansion was made using funds borrowed from Jimmy Hoffa. Following a request by Robert Kennedy, who had concerns over the press coverage of his and his brother's relationships with Marilyn Monroe, Sinatra made accommodation available for her for a weekend prior to her death on August 4, 1962. During this period she was not allowed to leave and only Giancana was allowed to visit her. Even her former husband, Joe DiMaggio, was turned away. She attempted suicide through an overdose, but contacted <b>the</b> <b>reception</b> <b>desk</b> and was rushed to hospital where she had her stomach pumped. The cabin, known as Monroe's, and another, known as Sinatra's, are still part of the guest accommodation. Also in that year, a federal investigation took place into a prostitution ring being run from the foyer of the Cal Neva.|$|E

Reporter Laurent Léger said they were interrupted by {{what they thought was}} the sound of a firecracker—the gunfire from the lobby—and recalled, [...] "We still thought it was a joke. The atmosphere was still joyous." ...|$|E

The {{location}} of the honors college {{near the top of}} the Cathedral of Learning affords students and visitors with large vistas of the campus and surrounding city. In 2002-2003, a renovation to the Honors College's space was completed by Rothschild Doyno Collaborative of Pittsburgh's Strip District. [...] The four-leaf medieval quatrefoil medallion at the top of the Cathedral is a central motif in the design of Honors College. [...] Stained glass behind <b>the</b> <b>reception</b> <b>desk</b> at the center of the space was designed by Glenn Greene Glass of Regent Square and centers on a design representing the four seasons, done in polished agate.

Sixty staff and guests searched until 04:30, at first assuming that Madeleine had wandered off.

2500|$|In 1975, a twin-screen {{movie theater}} owned and {{operated}} by General Cinema Corporation was added to the northeast corner of the mall. The theater, formally known as Valley View Cinema 1 & 2, closed in 1991. The facade of the movie theater was then boarded up and the interior furnishings were stripped out. The [...] space remained empty until it was renovated in late 2001 by Radio One to house radio stations KBFB and KSOC. Renovation included leveling the sloping floors in the theater and installing new air-conditioning and heating units. Officially opened in January 2002, the broadcast studios, located on the mall's second level, are in what were originally the former theater's projection rooms. The area that originally housed the box office counters became <b>the</b> <b>reception</b> <b>desk</b> and part of one movie theater was retained as a 150-seat auditorium. The facility also includes a small basketball court, two production studios, a mix room, a newsroom, and office space.|$|E
2500|$|The {{character}} of Leanne was created {{as the mother}} of established character Nicole Miller (Sally Martin) in a storyline that saw her come out as bisexual to her family and reveal her relationship with Maia Jeffries (Anna Jullienne). Jennifer Ludlam was offered the role due to what she believed as, [...] "being a certain age, and looking like I could pass for Nicole's mother." [...] Leanne debuted onscreen in April 2010 and Ludlam enjoyed shooting the show due to the outspoken nature of her character. Ludlam was offered a reprisal of the role the following year and she appeared for 5 weeks in recurring role. She made her last appearance on 25 February 2011. Ludlam was offered to reprise the role 3 years later and agreed upon learning she was going to have, [...] "my own arc and be a person." [...] Leanne returned in March 2014, in a more central role that saw her become the receptionist at the hospital. Ludlam found it daunting filming at <b>the</b> <b>reception</b> <b>desk</b> due to its [...] "iconic" [...] nature and having worked with several former actors who played the receptionist role such as Elizabeth McRae (Marj Brasch), Geraldine Brophy (Moira Crombie) and Alison Quigan (Yvonne Jeffries).|$|E
2500|$|A 1915 {{article in}} Overland Monthly {{magazine}} made {{note of the}} birds' annual habit of nesting beneath the Mission's eaves and archways from spring through fall, and made the swallows the [...] "signature icon" [...] of the Mission; O'Sullivan utilized interest in the phenomenon to generate public interest in restoration efforts during his two decades in residence. One of bell ringer Acú's most colorful tales was that the swallows (or las golondrinas, as he called them) flew over the Atlantic Ocean to Jerusalem each winter, carrying small twigs on which they could rest atop the water along the way. On March 13, 1939, a popular radio program was broadcast live from the Mission grounds, announcing the swallows' arrival. Composer Leon René was so inspired by the event that he penned the song [...] "When the Swallows Come Back to Capistrano" [...] in tribute. During its initial release the song spent several weeks atop the Your Hit Parade charts. The song has been recorded by such musicians as The Ink Spots, Fred Waring, Guy Lombardo, Glenn Miller, The Five Satins and Pat Boone. A glassed-off room in the Mission has been designated in René's honor and displays the upright piano on which he composed the tune, <b>the</b> <b>reception</b> <b>desk</b> from his office and several copies of the song's sheet music and other pieces of furniture, all donated by René's family.|$|E

50|$|Reflecting {{the overall}} {{shape of the}} building, the lobby {{features}} a metal ceiling with eight-sided truncated metal 'stalactites.' This {{is accompanied by a}} floor-to-ceiling metallic sculpted mural. <b>The</b> <b>reception</b> (security) <b>desk</b> is a solid 5-ton slab of granite. The lobby design won for Rebanks an honourable mention, in 1976, from the American Institute of Business Designers.|$|R

50|$|In 1890, two {{brothers}} with a brewing company opened Café Metropole {{as a place}} in the city to sell their beer. The café was a huge success and the Weilemans-Ceuppens family then purchased the building next-door, a former bank, which would become the Hotel Metropole, inaugurated in 1895.

50|$|At {{the end of}} March 1983 the Greater London Council {{purchased}} Wesley House and Kingsway Hall for the women's committee. Kingsway Hall {{was rapidly}} deteriorating, and an archaeological survey in August 1996 found that nothing significant about it was still present. Despite pleas from some musicians and record magazines, Kingsway was demolished in 1998 {{to make way for}} a hotel of the same name, which opened in 2000. <b>The</b> hotel's <b>reception</b> <b>desk</b> is on <b>the</b> approximate location where orchestra members once recorded.|$|R

2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>reception</b> {{pavilion}} {{received a}} complete overhaul. Its exterior metal façade of bronzed aluminum was removed {{and replaced with}} beige limestone. The glass curtain wall received new mechanical louvers. The interior wall coverings of dark wood paneling and bronzed aluminum were replaced with a cream-colored travertine wainscoting topped by a band of polished stone. Fabric covered the walls above the band, and white wooden grills were used to help break up the space. A new terrazzo floor in pastel colors was also installed. <b>The</b> old <b>reception</b> <b>desk</b> was removed, and a new, curvilinear <b>reception</b> <b>desk</b> was emplaced. Displays about where to eat, drink, and shop in downtown Cleveland {{were added to the}} lobby, as were several kiosks where airlines could assist convention-goers in making plane reservations. Six [...] trees were planted inside the lobby to make it more inviting, and new paving and exterior lighting were installed outside the pavilion.|$|R
