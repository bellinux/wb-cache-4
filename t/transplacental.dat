5|$|Many {{mammalian}} serpins {{have been}} identified that share no obvious orthology with a human serpin counterpart. Examples include numerous rodent serpins (particularly some of the murine intracellular serpins) {{as well as the}} uterine serpins. The term uterine serpin refers to members of the serpin A clade that are encoded by the SERPINA14 gene. Uterine serpins are produced by the endometrium of a restricted group of mammals in the Laurasiatheria clade under the influence of progesterone or estrogen. They are probably not functional proteinase inhibitors and may function during pregnancy to inhibit maternal immune responses against the conceptus or to participate in <b>transplacental</b> transport.|$|E
25|$|Mortality of {{this disease}} varies but is {{generally}} much higher in children. <b>Transplacental</b> spread has been noted. Lifelong neurological defects such as deafness, emotional lability and hemiparesis may occur in those who have had central nervous system involvement. In known cases, some effects also include nausea, headache, fever, vomiting and sometimes swelling of the testicles.|$|E
25|$|Five species infect horses: S. asinus, S. bertrami, S. equicanis, S. fayeri and S. neurona (S. falcatula). All utilize canids as {{definitive}} hosts: <b>transplacental</b> infection {{has also}} been reported. S. neurona causes equine protozoal myeloencephalitis. Exposure to this parasite appears to be common in the United States with serological surveys indicating that 50-60% percent of all horses in the Midwest United States {{have been exposed to}} it. Clinical signs include gait abnormalities including ataxia, knuckling and crossing over. Muscle atrophy, usually unilateral, may occur. The lesions are typically focal. Brain-stem involvement is common. Depression, weakness, head tilt and dysphagia also occur.|$|E
25|$|DES gained notoriety when it {{was shown}} to cause a rare vaginal tumor in girls and young {{women who had been}} exposed to this drug in utero. In 1971, the New England Journal of Medicine {{published}} a report showing that seven of eight girls and young women (ages 14 to 22) who had been diagnosed with vaginal clear cell adenocarcinoma had been exposed prenatally to DES. Subsequent studies have shown an approximate 40-fold increased risk of vaginal/cervical clear cell adenocarcinoma in women exposed in utero to DES. As a consequence of this evidence, DES is considered an established human carcinogen. DES {{was one of the first}} <b>transplacental</b> carcinogens discovered in humans, meaning a toxin could cross the placenta and harm the fetus. It had originally been believed that the placenta protected the developing fetus but it is now known that is not true. Daughters exposed to DES in utero may also have an increased risk of moderate to severe cervical squamous cell dysplasia and an increased risk of breast cancer.|$|E

2500|$|In general {{individuals}} {{are exposed to}} PCBs overwhelmingly through food, much less so by breathing contaminated air, and least by skin contact. Once exposed, some PCBs may change to other chemicals inside the body. These chemicals or unchanged PCBs can be excreted in feces or may remain in a person's body for years, with half lives estimated at 10–15 years. PCBs collect in body fat and milk fat. PCBs biomagnify up the food web and are present in fish and waterfowl of contaminated aquifers. Infants are exposed to PCBs through breast milk or by intrauterine exposure through <b>transplacental</b> transfer of PCBs [...] and {{are at the top}} of the food chain.|$|E

50|$|Uncontrolled and inadequately treated {{maternal}} hyperthyroidism {{may also}} result in fetal and neonatal hyperthyroidism {{due to the}} <b>transplacental</b> transfer of stimulatory TSH receptor antibodies (TRAbs). Clinical neonatal hyperthyroidism occurs in about 1% of infants born to mothers with Graves’ disease. Rarely neonatal hypothyroidism may also be observed in the infants of mothers with Graves’ hyperthyroidism. This may result from <b>transplacental</b> transfer of circulating maternal anti-thyroid drugs, pituitary-thyroid axis suppression from transfer of maternal thyroxine.|$|E
50|$|The {{main routes}} of {{transmission}} of vertically transmitted infections are across the placenta (<b>transplacental)</b> {{and across the}} female reproductive tract during childbirth.|$|E

50|$|<b>Transplacental</b> {{carcinogenesis}} is {{a series}} of genotypic and/or phenotypic changes in the cells of a fetus due to in utero exposure to carcinogens. Specifically, these changes are identified as malignant by virtue of their metastatic potential.|$|E
50|$|The immune {{response}} of animals could {{be unable to}} eliminate trypanosomes completely, and the animals could become inapparent carriers. These inapparent infections can be reactivated if the animal is stressed. Also, the <b>transplacental</b> transmission can also occur.|$|E
5000|$|Numerous {{possible}} {{risk factors}} have been identified, including gestational diabetes, <b>transplacental</b> infections (the [...] "TORCH complex"), first trimester bleeding, {{and a history of}} miscarriage. As well, the disorder is found twice as often in female babies. However, {{there appears to be no}} correlation between HPE and maternal age.|$|E
50|$|The {{mechanism}} of <b>transplacental</b> infection {{has been investigated}} by using IF microscopy to identify infected cells in maternal and fetal tissues at progressively longer intervals after maternal oronasal exposure. Examination of tissues contiguous with the maternal-fetal junction revealed viral antigen in endothelial and mesenchymal cells of the chorion, with increasing involvement of these tissues at progressively later stages of gestation. Viral antigen was never detected unequivocally in either uterine epithelium or trophectoderm. Consequently, {{there was no evidence}} for maternalfetal transfer of the virus by replicating through these tissues. However, this route cannot be excluded, since {{only a small part of}} the total area of contact was examined. Transfer of the virus within macrophages has been considered. Whatever the route, maternal viremia seems a likely prerequisite for <b>transplacental</b> infection.|$|E
50|$|Mortality of {{this disease}} varies but is {{generally}} much higher in children. <b>Transplacental</b> spread has been noted. Lifelong neurological defects such as deafness, emotional lability and hemiparesis may occur in those who have had central nervous system involvement. In known cases, some effects also include nausea, headache, fever, vomiting and sometimes swelling of the testicles.|$|E
50|$|For vaginal yeast {{infection}} in pregnancy, topical imidazole or triazole antifungals are considered the therapy of choice owing to available safety data. Systemic absorption of these topical formulations is minimal, posing little risk of <b>transplacental</b> transfer. In vaginal {{yeast infection}} in pregnancy, treatment with topical azole antifungals is recommended for 7 days instead of a shorter duration.|$|E
50|$|Enteroviruses {{commonly}} infect neonates and infants {{younger than}} 12 months. Coxsackie b viruses are usually spread to infants through perinatal transmission. However, more severe cases of coxsackie B viruses are spread through <b>transplacental</b> transmission. Common symptoms of neonatal coxsackie B virus infection in children include meningitis and/or encephalitis. Coxsackie B4 virus {{is able to}} infect the brain and spinal cord and cause inflammation.|$|E
50|$|CB4 {{virus has}} caused <b>transplacental</b> infections in mice. Infection {{in the first}} couple weeks of {{gestation}} {{has been shown to}} be harmful for dams as well as the fetus, causing reduced litter sizes, abortion, or stillbirth. Pups that were born from dams infected on days 4 and 17 of gestation had significantly (p < 0.05) greater pancreatic abnormalities leading to symptoms similar to diabetes.|$|E
50|$|Uterine serpins {{are members}} of the A clade of the serine {{protease}} inhibitor (serpin) superfamily of proteins and are encoded by the SERPINA14 gene. Uterine serpins are produced by the endometrium of a restricted group of mammals under the influence of progesterone or estrogen. These proteins appear to be inactive protease inhibitors and may function during pregnancy to regulate immune function or participate in <b>transplacental</b> transport.|$|E
50|$|Zoonosis {{affecting}} {{domestic animals}} {{is caused by}} contact with milk, urine, and genital organs, which concentrate the causative organisms. Some reservoirs include buffalo and other animals, but mostly cattle. In humans, the disease is acquired from unpasteurised milk and products or undercooked meat (consumers), laboratory inhalation (lab workers), accidental skin penetration or abrasion (farmers, slaughterhouse workers, and veterinarians) and (rarely) conjunctival contact, blood transfusion, <b>transplacental,</b> and person-to-person.|$|E
50|$|Dams are {{susceptible}} to PPV-induced reproductive failure if infected anytime during about {{the first half of}} gestation. This interval of maternal susceptibility is indicated by the collective results of several experimental studies, by in-depth epidemiological investigations, and by estimates of the time of death of fetuses collected during epidemiological surveys. Consequences of maternal infection during this interval are embryonic and fetal death followed by resorption and mummification respectively. <b>Transplacental</b> infection also follows maternal exposure after midgestation, but fetuses usually survive without obvious clinical effects in utero. The likely reason is that <b>transplacental</b> infection often requires 10-14 days or longer, and by 70 days of gestation most fetuses are able to develop a protective immunologic response to the virus. In general, fetuses experimentally infected by transuterine inoculation of the virus have died when infected before day 70 of gestation, but they have survived and produced antibody when infected later in gestation. A strain of PPV of slightly greater virulence also has been reported. The usual consequences of infection at different stages of gestation are summarized in Table 1.|$|E
5000|$|The primary {{effect on}} the fetus from <b>transplacental</b> passage of PTU is the {{production}} of a mild hypothyroidism when the drug is used close to term. This usually resolves within a few days without treatment. The hypothyroid state may be observed as a goiter in the newborn, and is the result of increased levels of fetal pituitary thyrotropin. [...] The incidence of fetal goiter after PTU treatment in reported cases is approximately 12%.|$|E
50|$|Chorioretinitis {{is often}} caused by {{toxoplasmosis}} and cytomegalovirus infections (mostly seen in immunodeficient {{subjects such as}} people with HIV or on immunosuppressant drugs). Congenital toxoplasmosis via <b>transplacental</b> transmission {{can also lead to}} sequelae such as chorioretinitis along with hydrocephalus and cerebral calcifications. Other possible causes of chorioretinitis are syphilis, sarcoidosis, tuberculosis, Behcet's disease, onchocerciasis, or West Nile virus. Chorioretinitis may also occur in presumed ocular histoplasmosis syndrome (POHS); despite its name, the relationship of POHS to Histoplasma is controversial.|$|E
50|$|Neonatal {{infections are}} infections of the neonate (newborn) during the {{neonatal}} period or first {{four weeks after}} birth. Neonatal infections may be contracted by <b>transplacental</b> transfer in utero, in the birth canal during delivery (perinatal), or by other means after birth. Some neonatal infections are apparent soon after delivery, while others may develop postpartum within the first week or month. Some infections acquired in the neonatal period do not become apparent until much later such as HIV, hepatitis B and malaria.|$|E
50|$|Vaginal {{bleeding}} {{not associated}} with menarche may be cause for concern in a child. In {{the first few days}} of life, some amount of vaginal bleeding is normal, prompted by the drop in <b>transplacental</b> hormones. Causes of vaginal bleeding in children include trauma, condyloma acuminata, lichen sclerosus, vulvovaginitis, tumors, urethral prolapse, precocious puberty, exogenous hormone exposure, and retained foreign body. Most causes can be diagnosed with a visual examination of the vulva and a careful medical history, but some may require vaginoscopy or a speculum exam.|$|E
50|$|In {{about ten}} percent of cases, AGS {{presents}} at or soon after birth (i.e. in the neonatal period). This presentation of the disease is characterized by microcephaly, neonatal seizures, poor feeding, jitteriness, cerebral calcifications (accumulation of calcium deposits in the brain), white matter abnormalities, and cerebral atrophy; thus indicating that the disease process became active before birth i.e. in utero. These infants can have hepatosplenomegaly and thrombocytopaenia, very much like cases of <b>transplacental</b> viral infection. About one third of such early presenting cases, most frequently in association with mutations in TREX1, die in early childhood.|$|E
50|$|An {{abnormal}} mass in a child's developing breast {{or early}} development of breast tissue may prompt concern. Neonates can have small breast buds at birth or white discharge (witches' milk), caused {{by exposure to}} <b>transplacental</b> hormones in utero. These phenomena are not pathological and typically disappear over the first weeks to months of life. Accessory nipples (polythelia) occur in 1% of children along the embryonic milk line and are benign in most cases. They may be removed surgically if they develop glandular tissue and cause pain, have discharge, or develop fibroadenomas.|$|E
50|$|Vaccines {{should be}} {{administered}} {{several weeks before}} conception to provide immunity throughout the susceptible period of gestation but after the disappearance of passively acquired colostral antibody, which could interfere {{with the development of}} active immunity. These limits may define a very brief interval for effective vaccination of gilts that are bred before 7 months of age. Although inactivated vaccine provides maximum safety, there is experimental evidence that PPV can be sufficiently attenuated so that it is unlikely to cause reproductive failure even if inadvertently administered during gestation. The apparent safety of MLV vaccine may be due to its reduced ability to replicate in tissues of the intact host and cause the level of viremia needed for <b>transplacental</b> infection. Moreover, it has been shown by transuterine inoculation of both virulent and attenuated virus that a much larger dose of attenuated virus is required to establish infection of fetuses. Duration of immunity following vaccination is unknown; however, in one study antibody titers were maintained for at least 4 months after administration of an inactivated vaccine. Low levels of antibody found to be protective allow speculation that, once the immune system has been primed with PPV, subsequent exposure to virulent virus during gestation is unlikely to result in <b>transplacental</b> infection even if antibody from vaccination is no longer detected.|$|E
50|$|A {{similar study}} was {{conducted}} by Roze et al. 2009 in The Netherlands on 62 mothers and children to estimate associations between 12 Organohalogen compounds (OHCs), including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and brominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) flame retardants, measured in maternal serum during the 35th week of pregnancy and motor performance (coordination, fine motor skills), cognition (intelligence, visual perception, visuomotor integration, inhibitory control, verbal memory, and attention), and behavior scores at 5-6 years of age. Authors demonstrated {{for the first time}} that <b>transplacental</b> transfer of polybrominated flame retardants was associated with the development of children at school age.|$|E
50|$|Evidence that viral {{infection}} {{may play a}} role as a cause or trigger of EFE was greatly reinforced by the study directed by Towbin in the virus laboratory of Texas Children's Hospital. They applied the methods of today's genetics to old preserved specimens from autopsies of patients with EFE done well before mumps immunization began and found mumps genome in the tissues of over 80% of these patients. It seems undeniable that <b>transplacental</b> mumps infection had been in the past the major cause of EFE, and that immunization was indeed the cause of EFE having become rare.|$|E
