5000|$|OCSP {{stapling}} resolves both {{problems in}} a fashion reminiscent of the Kerberos ticket. In a stapling scenario, the certificate holder queries the OCSP server themselves at regular intervals, obtaining a signed time-stamped OCSP response. When the site's visitors attempt to connect to the site, this response is included ("stapled") with the TLS/SSL handshake via <b>the</b> Certificate <b>Status</b> <b>Request</b> extension response (note: the TLS client must explicitly include a Certificate <b>Status</b> <b>Request</b> extension in its ClientHello TLS/SSL handshake message). [...] While it may appear that allowing the site operator to control verification responses would allow a fraudulent site to issue false verification for a revoked certificate, the stapled responses can't be forged as {{they need to be}} directly signed by the certificate authority, not the server. If the client does not receive a stapled response, it will just contact the OCSP server by itself. [...] However, if the client receives an invalid stapled response, it will abort the connection. The only increased risk of OCSP stapling is that the notification of revocation for a certificate may be delayed until the last-signed OCSP response expires.|$|R

Since the analysis is not an absolute objective one, we can conclude that most of the students expressed their requests in a polite, formal and indirect way through long sentences as an attempt to save the negative face.  </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} investigates {{similarities}} and differences of a speech act of refusal in English as realized by Malay Speakers of English (MSE) and Native Speakers of English (NSE). The study examined the types and also {{the contents of the}} strategies used by the two groups when refusing a request made by a higher status interlocutor. An Enhanced Open Role-play was utilized to obtain data on the types and content of refusal strategies. Participants of the study comprised 12 MSE undergraduate students from a local university and 12 NSE who were IGSCE and Diploma Baccalaureate students from an international school who had refused to <b>the</b> higher <b>status</b> interlocutor’s <b>request.</b> Qualitative data analytic methods were used to analyse the data which were classified into semantic refusal strategies and politeness strategies. Brown’s and Levinson’s politeness theory, Hofstede’s cultural dimensions and Hall’s high- and low-context cultures were used to guide the study. The findings revealed that the two groups shared many similarities in terms of types and contents of the strategies when refusing to <b>the</b> higher <b>status</b> interlocutor’s <b>requests.</b> Nevertheless, <b>the</b> NSE demonstrated a higher use of direct strategies and the content of their indirect strategies and adjuncts to refusal strategies reflect the western individualistic values.
