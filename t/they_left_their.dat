The club play at Fetcham Grove in Leatherhead having moved out of Kingsmeadow {{at the end of}} the 2016–17 season which had been their home since 1989, when <b>they</b> <b>left</b> <b>their</b> original Richmond Road ground. They shared Kingsmeadow with AFC Wimbledon since 2002, who purchased the lease of Kingsmeadow in 2003 before selling the ground to Chelsea F.C. in 2016.|$|E
5|$|On Ralph's death a second-cousin of dramatist William Congreve {{inherited}} the manor. The Congreve Family owned the estate {{at the time}} of the 1830 Swing Riots. The rioters marched across Aldermaston, wrecking twenty-three agricultural machines. Workers were so frightened by the riots that <b>they</b> <b>left</b> <b>their</b> machinery in the open in an attempt to limit additional damage. Around the same time, the River Kennet (along the north side of the estate) was made navigable between Reading and Newbury.|$|E
5|$|Several {{other factors}} {{complicated}} {{the rise of}} nationalism in the German states. The man-made factors included political rivalries between members of the German confederation, particularly between the Austrians and the Prussians, and socio-economic competition among the commercial and merchant interests and the old land-owning and aristocratic interests. Natural factors included widespread drought in the early 1830s, {{and again in the}} 1840s, and a food crisis in the 1840s. Further complications emerged {{as a result of a}} shift in industrialization and manufacturing; as people sought jobs, <b>they</b> <b>left</b> <b>their</b> villages and small towns to work during the week in the cities, returning for a day and a half on weekends.|$|E

5|$|After some {{discussion}} he was persuaded to disembark {{so that the}} Helmuth could continue operations. Leaving demolition parties aboard the cargo vessels, Ritchie then took the Helmuth further downriver to check for other shipping, but the small ship grounded on a sandbar. Assuming the route was blocked, {{he returned to the}} two cargo ships on one of the expedition's small launches. It was at this stage, whilst conducting a final inspection, that he made the discovery {{of a large number of}} empty ammunition cases and discarded bullets in the holds of the cargo ships. Deducing that the German crew had armed themselves before <b>they</b> <b>left</b> <b>their</b> vessels, he suspected preparations were underway to ambush his force when it attempted to leave the harbour.|$|E
5|$|Born to {{a wealthy}} family, Workman was {{educated in the}} finest schools {{available}} to women and traveled in Europe. Her marriage to William Hunter Workman cemented these advantages, and, after being introduced to climbing in New Hampshire, Fanny Workman traveled the world with him. They were able to capitalize on their wealth and connections to voyage around Europe, North Africa, and Asia. The couple had two children, but Fanny Workman was not a motherly type; <b>they</b> <b>left</b> <b>their</b> children in schools and with nurses, and Workman saw herself as a New Woman who could equal any man. The Workmans began their travels with bicycle tours of Switzerland, France, Italy, Spain, Algeria and India. They cycled thousands of miles, sleeping wherever they could find shelter. They wrote books about each trip and Fanny frequently commented {{on the state of}} the lives of women that she saw. Their early bicycle tour narratives were better received than their mountaineering books.|$|E
5|$|The party spent a {{total of}} 11days {{traversing}} the North China Plain via the Grand Canal before reaching Tongzhou District, {{where there was a}} large warehouse depot adjunct to the capital city. From there <b>they</b> <b>left</b> <b>their</b> courier ships and traveled by donkey and foot towards the capital Beijing, where they lodged at the Central Courier Hostel. The Ming court granted the Korean party gifts of fine clothes during their stay. On June 3, the officer in charge of Choe's escort notified the transport office in Beijing that three carriages plus horses and donkeys would be needed in the journey to the Korean border; when these were granted in the morning, the party swiftly departed from Beijing. Choe was not sad to leave the sights of Beijing behind, as he found the people there to be obsessed with business and cared little for agriculture or farming, a clear indication of his Confucian-oriented values.|$|E

5|$|Despite the orders, a {{relatively}} small number of people evacuated for the hurricane. According to a telephone survey conducted by the United States Department of Commerce, the highest participation rate was for residents in the Northern Neck in areas potentially affected by the storm surge from a Category2 hurricane, of which 41% in the survey stated <b>they</b> <b>left</b> <b>their</b> houses for a safer location. In Surry, only 9% of those in a Category2 hurricane storm surge zone left. 30% who participated in the survey along the Eastern Shore left. The primary reasons for the choice whether to evacuate or not were due to the track of Isabel, its strength, or influence from the media. Most participants in the survey stated they did not hear any sort of evacuation notice from public officials in their location, however. Of those who evacuated, about 64% left for the house of a friend or a relative, with about 24% evacuating to a hotel or a motel. Most of those in Hampton and Norfolk left for elsewhere in the state, while the majority of those in the Northern Neck evacuated to destinations in their own neighborhood or community. The evacuation destinations on the Eastern Shore of Virginia were varied, with 23% leaving for Maryland and 46% staying in their own neighborhood or community. The length of the evacuation process varied between a few hours to two days, with the worst evacuation problems being closed or flooded roads. The Virginia Army National Guard and State Police troopers assisted in the evacuations. In all, more than 160,000 residents in southeastern Virginia were told to evacuate, including 11,000 in vulnerable locations along the Chesapeake Bay and all residents in mobile home parks in Chesapeake and Newport News. A total of about 16,325people evacuated to 67 shelters. Some of the reported problems were shortages of supplies, unanticipated medical issues, overcrowding, and lack of security.|$|E

25|$|The Jewish {{presence}} in Harlem was ephemeral, and by 1930, only 5,000 Jews remained. As <b>they</b> <b>left,</b> <b>their</b> apartments in East Harlem were increasingly filled by Puerto Ricans, who were arriving {{in large numbers}} by 1913. Italian Harlem lasted longer, and traces of the community lasted into the 1970s {{in the area around}} Pleasant Avenue.|$|E

Together, <b>they</b> <b>left</b> <b>their</b> jobs to join a kibbutz in Palestine in 1921.|$|E
25|$|In the 19th {{and early}} 20th century Broken Hill {{was home to}} a {{community}} of Afghans.

25|$|German and Ottoman forces amply {{supported}} by field artillery and machine guns were moving to converge on Es Salt; reinforcements travelled quickly {{from the north}} and south of the Ottoman Empire on the Hejaz railway to Amman (as they had done during the first Transjordan attack in March).

25|$|During a {{nighttime}} truce announced Tuesday, about 2,000 {{inhabitants of the}} Nahr al-Bared camp {{had been able to}} flee. Some refugees left on foot while others were in cars and vans. The Red Crescent helped the refugees relocate to the nearby Beddawi camp, where they spent the night at schools. Other refugees left for the nearby city of Tripoli. Reports suggest that snipers fired at the fleeing crowd of refugees as <b>they</b> <b>left</b> <b>their</b> homes. The truce seemed to have ended when a UN aid convoy was attacked later that night.|$|E

The initial plan {{to get her out}} of the country following their escape failed and it wasn't until 20years later that they could meet again, when Ivana also first met her sister Sandy, Kevin Dahlgren's mother, who had been born in the USA. Veronika's and Sandy's families were in contact and started visiting each other after the fall of communism in Czechoslovakia in 1989.|$|E
25|$|In 1616, Governor Dale joined John Rolfe and Pocahontas {{and their}} young son Thomas as <b>they</b> <b>left</b> <b>their</b> Varina Farms {{plantation}} {{for a public}} relations mission to England, where Pocahontas was received and treated {{as a form of}} visiting royalty by Queen Anne. This stimulated more interest in investments in the Virginia Company, the desired effect. However, as the couple prepared to return to Virginia, Pocahontas died of an illness at Gravesend on March 17, 1617, where she was buried. John Rolfe returned to Virginia alone once again, leaving their son Thomas Rolfe, then a small child, in England to obtain an education.|$|E
25|$|Under the 1961 Immigration Amendment Act, British and Irish immigrants, {{along with}} other non-New Zealand {{citizens}} (except Australians, who could enter freely) were required to have a permit before entering New Zealand. In practice, the permit was only a formality for Britons and Irish; they were issued with permits on arrival. Nevertheless, for the first time, the 1961 act put British and non-British people on the same footing when they sought to enter New Zealand. After the immigration policy review of 1974, British migrants, like all others, were required to obtain a permit before <b>they</b> <b>left</b> <b>their</b> homelands. The British and Irish were now on the same footing as the nationals of other countries.|$|E
