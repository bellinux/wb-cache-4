5|$|A {{result of}} its reef, the <b>tourist</b> <b>industry</b> is taking off in Msambweni {{attracting}} snorkelers. Holiday cottages and hotels have sprung up. Club Green Oasis caters mainly to German tourists. Although supplied with electricity, in the 1990s the government expressed concerns about access to an ample clean water supply in the division.|$|E
5|$|Although {{adequate}} for the town's residents the new stations were {{a long way}} from the seafront attractions, which were at the foot of a steep hill. The day-trippers on whom Ramsgate's <b>tourist</b> <b>industry</b> depended were therefore increasingly attracted to Margate, where the station was next to the beach.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{years have}} seen a radical {{transformation}} of conventional tourist marketing and experience. The use of exotic locations in Hollywood films has allowed global audiences to enjoy distant places. Simultaneously, Hollywood screening of potential 'tourist paradises' has generated new <b>tourist</b> <b>industries</b> around the world. This book takes {{a closer look at}} this new phenomenon of 'cinematic tourism', combining theory with case studies drawn from four continents: America, Europe, Asia and Australasia. The author explores audiences' perceptions of film and their covert relationship with tourist advertising campaigns, alongside the nature of newly-born <b>tourist</b> <b>industries</b> and the reaction of native populations and nation-states faced with the commodification of their histories, identities and environments...|$|R
5|$|Tourism {{dominates the}} Croatian service sector and {{accounts}} {{for up to}} 20% of Croatian GDP. Annual <b>tourist</b> <b>industry</b> income for 2014 was estimated at €7.4billion. Its positive effects are felt throughout the economy of Croatia in terms of increased business volume observed in retail business, processing industry orders and summer seasonal employment. The industry is considered an export business, because it significantly reduces the country's external trade imbalance. Since {{the conclusion of the}} Croatian War of Independence, the <b>tourist</b> <b>industry</b> has grown rapidly, recording a fourfold rise in tourist numbers, with more than 11million tourists each year. The most numerous are tourists from Germany, Slovenia, Austria, Italy and the Czech Republic as well as Croatia itself. Length of a tourist stay in Croatia averages 4.9 days.|$|E
5|$|Tourism was an {{important}} industry for the country, but has been failing in recent years. The Zimbabwe Conservation Task Force released a report in June 2007, estimating 60% of Zimbabwe's wildlife has died since 2000 due to poaching and deforestation. The report warns {{that the loss of}} life combined with widespread deforestation is potentially disastrous for the <b>tourist</b> <b>industry.</b>|$|E
5|$|During his 1904campaign to {{be elected}} governor, Napoleon Bonaparte Broward promised to drain the Everglades, and his later {{projects}} were more effective than Disston's. Broward's promises sparked a land boom facilitated by blatant errors in an engineer's report, pressure from real estate developers, and the burgeoning <b>tourist</b> <b>industry</b> throughout south Florida. The increased population brought hunters who went unchecked and had a devastating impact on the numbers of wading birds (hunted for their plumes), alligators, and other Everglades animals.|$|E

5|$|Rivington Hall, {{a former}} manor house with an {{imposing}} red brick Georgian frontage, {{is a short}} distance from the village centre. Its barn, and the barn at Great House Farm were renovated and converted by the architect Jonathan Simpson for William Lever in 1904. The barns were used for catering for the early <b>tourist</b> <b>industry,</b> a function they retain today. Farmhouses and their barns scattered outside the village centre, also built in local gritstone, are also listed.|$|E
5|$|The E751 is {{considered}} to be of great importance for the economy and <b>tourist</b> <b>industry</b> of the region, as it links a large number of resorts to motorway systems in Slovenia and Croatia, providing a significant access route for thousands of motoring tourists. Furthermore, two endpoints of the E751 are located {{in the vicinity of the}} two major Adriatic seaports of Rijeka and Koper.|$|E
5|$|The town {{came into}} being as a spa in the Restoration and had its heyday as a tourist resort under Beau Nash when the Pantiles and its chalybeate spring {{attracted}} visitors who wished to take the waters. Though its popularity waned {{with the advent of}} sea bathing, the town remains popular and derives some 30 percent of its income from the <b>tourist</b> <b>industry.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{thriving}} textile, {{food and}} <b>tourist</b> <b>industries</b> and its development {{into the most}} popular holiday destination in northern Portugal, led to a major growth between the 1930s and 1960s. In December 16, 1948, the Anteplano de Urbanização da Póvoa de Varzim (Urbanization Pre-plan) {{was approved by the}} national government.|$|R

5|$|Castles remain highly popular attractions: in 2009 nearly 2.4million people {{visited the}} Tower of London, 1.2 million visited Edinburgh Castle, 559,000 visited Leeds Castle and 349,000 visited Dover Castle. Ireland, which {{for many years}} had not {{exploited}} the tourist potential of its castle heritage, began to encourage more tourists in the 1960s and 1970s and Irish castles are now a core part of the Irish <b>tourist</b> <b>industry.</b> British and Irish castles are today also {{closely linked to the}} international film industry, with tourist visits to castles now often involving not simply a visit to an historic site, but also a visit to the location of a popular film.|$|E
5|$|Much of {{this period}} {{represented}} a high point in Galveston's economy. It is {{sometimes referred to as}} the open era or the wide-open era because the business owners and the community made little effort to hide the illegal vice activities. The <b>tourist</b> <b>industry</b> spawned by the illegal businesses helped to offset Galveston's decline as a commercial and shipping center following a devastating hurricane in 1900. However, crackdowns against gambling and prostitution in Texas during the mid-20th century made these businesses increasingly difficult to sustain. By the 1950s, this era of Galveston's history had ended.|$|E
5|$|Ratanakiri's <b>tourist</b> <b>industry</b> has rapidly {{expanded}} in recent years: {{visits to the}} province increased from 6,000 in 2002 to 105,000 in 2008 and 118,000 in 2011. The region's tourism development strategy focuses on encouraging ecotourism. Increasing tourism in Ratanakiri has been problematic because local communities receive very little income from tourism and because guides sometimes bring tourists to villages without residents' consent, disrupting traditional ways of life. A few initiatives have sought to address these issues: a provincial tourism steering committee aims to ensure that tourism is non-destructive, and some programs provide English and tourism skills to indigenous people.|$|E

5|$|The E751 {{route is}} of great {{importance}} for economy and <b>tourist</b> <b>industry</b> of Istria and Slovenian Littoral, as it links {{a large number of}} resorts to motorway systems in Slovenia and Croatia, providing a significant access route for thousands of motoring tourists. These resorts include Brijuni National Park, Fažana, Rovinj, Poreč, Novigrad, Umag, Piran and Portorož {{on either side of the}} Croatian–Slovenian border. Furthermore, two endpoints of the E751 are located in vicinity of two major Adriatic seaports: the Port of Rijeka and the Port of Koper.|$|E
5|$|The Norwegian Telecommunications Administration {{established}} a coast radio station, Svalbard Radio, at Finneset in 1911, which {{was moved to}} Longyearbyen in 1930. The town's <b>tourist</b> <b>industry</b> started in 1935, when SS Lyngen started calling regularly during the summer season. In 1937, SNSK established Sverdrupbyen to house workers for Mine 1b and operation of the mine started in 1939. In 1938, Longyearbyen's first road was completed, between the town center and Sverdrupbyen. Operations at Mine 2b, a different entrance to Mine 2a, started in 1939.|$|E
5|$|The {{damage from}} Rosita made a large {{impact on the}} <b>tourist</b> <b>industry.</b> The time of impact {{happened}} just before the Easter and ANZAC Day Holiday period. Easter {{is considered to be}} the beginning of the tourist season, so it is usually expected that there will be an increase of visitors into Broome at this time. Many visitors delayed or cancelled their trips, and some cut short their holiday. Car hire companies that had been booked out for the holiday period had people returning vehicles early.|$|E
5000|$|Service {{industries}} play a {{big part}} in adding environmental burdens, especially in terms of greenhouse gas emissions generated by travel and <b>tourist</b> <b>industries.</b> The service industry is expected to play a larger part in the modern economy as [...] "dematerialization", or the replacement of manufactured goods by services in many firms, plays a bigger role in the economy.|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} cost {{structure}} and economic {{implications of the}} Taiwanese international <b>tourist</b> hotel <b>industry.</b> A multi-product translog cost function with three inputs and three outputs is estimated using seemingly unrelated regression estimation (SURE) and three-stage-least-squares (3 SLS). A balanced panel dataset consisting of 47 international tourist hotels in Taiwan over the period 1997 - 2001 was obtained from Taiwanese Tourism Bureau and used to estimate the cost function. The results show that both scale and scope economies exist in the Taiwanese international <b>tourist</b> hotel <b>industry.</b> In addition, productivity growth is positive over the study period. Managerial and policy implications for the Taiwanese international <b>tourist</b> hotel <b>industry</b> are also discussed...|$|R
50|$|Although {{suffering}} a devastating cyclone in 1918, Mackay enjoyed {{a period of}} substantial growth through the 1920s and 1930s, when it was the fastest growing town in Queensland. This was largely because its connection to the railway system in 1924 improved access to markets and reduced transport costs, thus boosting not only the sugar industry but also the developing dairy and <b>tourist</b> <b>industries.</b>|$|R
5|$|The shark <b>tourist</b> <b>industry</b> {{has some}} {{financial}} leverage in conserving this animal. A single set of great white jaws can fetch up to £20,000. That is {{a fraction of}} the tourism value of a live shark; tourism is a more sustainable economic activity than shark fishing. For example, the dive industry in Gansbaai, South Africa consists of six boat operators with each boat guiding 30 people each day. With fees between £50 and £150 per person, a single live shark that visits each boat can create anywhere between £9,000 and £27,000 of revenue daily.|$|E
5|$|Cage diving is {{most common}} at sites where great whites are {{frequent}} including {{the coast of}} South Africa, the Neptune Islands in South Australia, and Guadalupe Island in Baja California. The popularity of cage diving and swimming with sharks is at {{the focus of a}} booming <b>tourist</b> <b>industry.</b> A common practice is to chum the water with pieces of fish to attract the sharks. These practices may make sharks more accustomed to people in their environment and to associate human activity with food; a potentially dangerous situation. By drawing bait on a wire towards the cage, tour operators lure the shark to the cage, possibly striking it, exacerbating this problem. Other operators draw the bait away from the cage, causing the shark to swim past the divers.|$|E
5|$|Other {{sectors of}} society were {{negatively}} affected too. By 2005, an estimated 80% of Zimbabwe's population were unemployed, and by 2008 only 20% of children were in schooling. The breakdown of water supplies and sewage systems resulted in a cholera outbreak in late 2008, with over 98,000 cholera cases in Zimbabwe between August 2008 and mid-July 2009. The ruined economy also impacted the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the country; by 2008 the HIV/AIDS rate for individuals aged between 15 and 49 was 15.3%. In 2007, the World Health Organisation declared the average life expectancy in Zimbabwe to be 34 for women and 36 for men, down from 63 and 54 respectively in 1997. The country's lucrative <b>tourist</b> <b>industry</b> was decimated, {{and there was a}} rise in poaching, including of endangered species. Mugabe directly exacerbated this problem; he ordered the killing of 100 elephants to provide meat for an April 2007 feast.|$|E
