5|$|To avert {{a republican}} backlash, the {{government}} exploited the credit {{readily available to}} Brazil {{as a result of}} its prosperity to fuel further development. The government extended massive loans at favorable interest rates to plantation owners and lavishly granted titles and lesser honors <b>to</b> <b>curry</b> <b>favor</b> with influential political figures who had become disaffected. The government also indirectly began to address the problem of the recalcitrant military by revitalizing the moribund National Guard, by then an entity which existed mostly only on paper.|$|E
5|$|While imprisoned and {{awaiting}} execution, Beauchamp wrote a confession. He accused Patrick Darby {{of perjury}} {{with regard to}} the alleged 1824 meeting between them. Many believed Beauchamp's accusation was meant <b>to</b> <b>curry</b> <b>favor</b> with New Court governor Joseph Desha – who considered Darby a political enemy – and to secure a pardon from him. When Beauchamp finished the confession in mid-June 1826, his uncle, Senator Beauchamp, took it to the state printer for immediate publication. An Old Court supporter, the printer refused to publish it.|$|E
5|$|During this time, Zhou Tong {{also has}} an {{additional}} disciple named Wu Song. Wu Song becomes famous for killing a man-eating tiger {{with his bare hands}} and is appointed as a constable in his native Shandong. The county magistrate Sun Guoqin later sends Wu on a mission to Kaifeng with precious tiger bone balm in order <b>to</b> <b>curry</b> <b>favor</b> with influential personages. During his stay in the capital, he makes the acquaintance of Zhou. Zhou finds Wu to be a man of great strength, but feels that he lacks refinement in his martial technique and, therefore, offers guidance for Wu's training. Unfortunately, these two men only interact for a brief two months before Wu has to return home, never to see Zhou again.|$|E
50|$|On January 24, 2011, {{a federal}} judge in McAllen, Texas sentenced the former {{president}} of the Board of Trustees of Donna ISD, George Hernandez, to five months in prison, five months of house arrest, three years of probation, and a $3,000 fine for paying thousands of dollars in kickbacks <b>to</b> <b>curry</b> <b>favors</b> from the PSJA school board. Mr. Hernandez had previously pleaded guilty to the criminal charges.|$|R

2500|$|Following Alexander the Great's {{death in}} 323 BC, Thebes was re-established in 315BC by Alexander's successor, Cassander. In {{restoring}} Thebes, Cassander sought {{to rectify the}} perceived wrongs of Alexander - a gesture of generosity that earned Cassander much goodwill throughout Greece. In addition <b>to</b> <b>currying</b> <b>favor</b> with the Athenians {{and many of the}} Peloponnesian states, Cassander's restoration of Thebes provided him with loyal allies in the Theban exiles who returned to resettle the site.|$|R
25|$|The Spanish {{now held}} East Florida and West Florida in {{addition}} to Louisiana, Tejas, Nuevo Mexico, and Nueva California.

25|$|The raid on Babylon {{could not}} have been {{intended}} to exercise sovereignty over the region; it was simply too far from Anatolia and the Hittites' center of power. It is thought, however, that the raid on Babylon brought an end to the Amorite dynasty of Hammurabi and allowed the Kassites to take power, and so might have arisen from an alliance with the Kassites or an attempt <b>to</b> <b>curry</b> <b>favor</b> with them. It might also be that Mursili undertook the long-distance attack for personal motives, namely as a way to outdo the military exploits of his predecessor, Hattusili I.|$|E
50|$|The {{location}} of the temple was near the Canopic branch of the Nile River, in the eastern Nile Delta of Lower Egypt. Accordingly, steles were erected at two locations as statements <b>to</b> <b>curry</b> political <b>favor</b> with the priesthood, and possibly the populace.|$|R
50|$|Royalists {{established}} {{first the}} short-lived Club des Impartiaux {{and later the}} Club Monarchique.

5000|$|Some [...] "errors" [...] {{were later}} {{thought to be}} intentional. Lake Superior's Isles Phelipeaux and Pontchartrain, which {{appeared}} on explorers' maps for many years, were named for Louis Phélypeaux, marquis de La Vrilliere, comte de Pontchartrain, perhaps <b>to</b> <b>curry</b> his <b>favor.</b> Phélypeaux was a government minister influential in allocating funds for additional voyages of exploration.|$|R
25|$|In September 1943 {{semi-autonomous}} militarized squads of Fascist fanatics sprouted up {{throughout the}} Republic of Salò. These squads spread terror among Jews and anti-Fascists {{for a year}} and a half. In the power vacuum that existed during the first three or four months of the occupation, the semi-autonomous bands were virtually uncontrollable. Many were linked to individual high-ranking Fascist politicians. Italian Fascists, sometimes government employees but more often fanatic civilians or paramilitary volunteers, hastened <b>to</b> <b>curry</b> <b>favor</b> with the Nazis. Informers betrayed their neighbors, squadristi seized Jews and delivered them to the German SS, and Italian journalists seemed to compete in the virulence of their anti-Semitic diatribes.|$|E
25|$|Though {{cautiously}} {{watched by}} the international community, the coup came to be generally accepted, with the military junta organizing elections within a promised two-year timeline. In a referendum on 26 June 2006, Mauritanians overwhelmingly (97%) approved a new constitution which limited the duration of a president's stay in office. The leader of the junta, Col. Vall, promised {{to abide by the}} referendum and relinquish power peacefully. Mauritania's establishment of relations with Israelit is one of only three Arab states to recognize Israelwas maintained by the new regime, despite widespread criticism from the opposition. They considered that position as a legacy of the Taya regime's attempts <b>to</b> <b>curry</b> <b>favor</b> with the West.|$|E
25|$|Cassatt {{saw that}} works by female artists were often {{dismissed}} with contempt unless {{the artist had}} a friend or protector on the jury, {{and she would not}} flirt with jurors <b>to</b> <b>curry</b> <b>favor.</b> Her cynicism grew when one of the two pictures she submitted in 1875 was refused by the jury, only to be accepted the following year after she darkened the background. She had quarrels with Sartain, who thought Cassatt too outspoken and self-centered, and eventually they parted. Out of her distress and self-criticism, Cassatt decided that she needed to move away from genre paintings and onto more fashionable subjects, in order to attract portrait commissions from American socialites abroad, but that attempt bore little fruit at first.|$|E

25|$|The {{bargaining}} atmosphere deteriorated {{throughout the}} remainder of 1992. The state's chief negotiator said he would wait for the legislative fact-finding panel's recommendation, Shafer implied he might oppose a proposed bond measure which would help fund state jobs, and Shafer accused the governor of releasing private confidential negotiating information to PEF members without the union's consent. At PEF's convention in October 1992, Members United for a Responsible Union leafletted against Shafer, accused him of neglecting members' needs and trying <b>to</b> <b>curry</b> <b>favor</b> with the AFT. Although the legislature passed a mandatory binding arbitration bill, the governor vetoed the legislation. Now looking at two years without a new contract, Shafer hired Theodore W. Kheel, a well-known labor negotiator, to help the union win a new pact.|$|E
25|$|Obama and Zapatero met {{face-to-face}} for {{the first}} time on April 2, 2009, at the G20 London Summit. Both leaders participated in the NATO Summit in Strasbourg-Kehl, where Spain committed an additional 450 troops to its previous military contingent of 778 in Afghanistan. Commentators said the decision may have been partially motivated by the Zapatero government's desire <b>to</b> <b>curry</b> <b>favor</b> with the new administration in Washington. Days later at the EU-U.S. Summit in Prague the two held a 45-minute meeting, and afterwards shared a photo-op for the press, where Obama called Zapatero a friend, and said he thinks that the two nations would establish an even stronger relationship in the years to come. This was the first formal meeting between heads of government of Spain and the United States since 2004.|$|E
25|$|The movement's main {{political}} and military backers were originally Algeria and Libya, with Cuba coming a very distant third. Mauritania also attempts to avoid involvement and to balance between Morocco and Polisario's backers in Algeria, although it formally recognizes the SADR as Western Sahara's government since 1984 and has a substantial Sahrawi refugee population (around 30,000) on its territory. Support from Algeria remains strong, despite the country's preoccupation with its own civil war. The Polisario is practically dependent on its bases and refugee camps, located on Algerian soil. While Algeria recognizes the Sahrawis' right to wage an armed struggle against Morocco, and has helped to equip the SPLA, the government also seems to have barred Polisario from returning to armed struggle after 1991, attempting <b>to</b> <b>curry</b> <b>favor</b> from the US and France and to avoid inflaming its already poor relations with Morocco.|$|E

50|$|Factions can be {{manipulated}} both positively and negatively mainly through edicts and buildings. For example, the player may choose to bribe the leaders of factions <b>to</b> attempt <b>to</b> <b>curry</b> their <b>favor</b> or, if the factions' leaders become {{too much of a}} threat, he can have them assassinated or imprisoned. The island's media outlets can be directed to distribute propaganda for a particular faction, and schools can be either parochial or military in nature.|$|R
500|$|Connotations was {{received}} negatively upon its premiere for its harmonic assertiveness and compositional style. The overall impression {{at the time}} was that, as critic Alex Ross later phrased it, [...] "Copland was no longer in an ingratiating mood." [...] The composer was accused by some critics of betraying his role as a tonal, populist composer <b>to</b> <b>curry</b> <b>favor</b> with younger composers and give the impression that his music still held contemporary relevance. Copland denied this accusation; he asserted that he had written Connotations as a twelve-tone work to give himself compositional options not available had he written it as a tonal one.|$|E
500|$|Comprehensive reports {{filed by}} the Einsatzgruppen have been {{analyzed}} by historian Ronald Headland as [...] "historical 'Messages of Murder'" [...] that provide insights into the worldview of its leadership. Headland writes that the reports [...] "bear witness to the fanatic commitment of the Einsatzgruppen leaders to their mission of extermination"; their ideology and racism {{are evident in the}} [...] "constant debasement of the victims" [...] and [...] "ever present racial conceptions concerning Jew, Communists, Gypsies and other 'inferior' elements". Headland concludes that Nebe was an ambitious man who may have volunteered to lead an Einsatzgruppe unit for careerist reasons, to get a [...] "military decoration", and <b>to</b> <b>curry</b> <b>favor</b> with Heydrich. Any misgivings he may have entertained as to the feasibility of the undertaking failed to prevent him from overseeing the murder of close to 50,000 people in the five months he spent as commander of his unit.|$|E
500|$|Phát {{has been}} {{described}} as a [...] "political Catholic", a term for those who practiced or converted to the religion <b>to</b> <b>curry</b> <b>favor</b> with Diệm, who made most military and political appointments and promotions on the basis of religion. Phát's habit of customarily being seen in public with a swagger stick and his reputation for autocratic leadership alienated most of his subordinate officers. He grew his pinky fingernail to great length, a practice observed by mandarins during Vietnam's imperial era to denote their status. Some observers claimed that the mandarin style of his fingernail spread to his general behavior, decrying him as [...] "haughty" [...] and [...] "hawklike". U.S. military advisors regarded Phát as [...] "mediocre". As a colonel, he served as the commander of 2nd Division, located in central Vietnam from 8 June 1961 until 18 June 1963, when he was replaced by Colonel Trương Văn Chương.|$|E
50|$|The correct {{practice}} of rituals, or orthopraxis was essential <b>to</b> <b>currying</b> <b>favor</b> of the gods. Public ceremonies were {{presided over by}} some sort of authority from the higher social class over public affairs, and in some rare cases specifically women. The presider would begin the ceremony {{at the start of}} the day and bathe himself or herself thoroughly beforehand. Any civilians in attendance would wear togas with a hood over their heads while the presider was bareheaded, often with a laurel wreath on his head for distinction. In live sacrifices, only domestic religion in ancient Rome were used. These animals were cleaned and often decorated with ribbons or garlands with colors dependent on the god or goddess for whom they were intended. The Romans would also use fruit and grains in public ceremonies as well as libations or drinks. These inanimate sacrifices were not less significant than live animal sacrifices, but rather they all served different purposes and went to different deities.|$|R
5000|$|Lee denied he had {{anything}} to do with BBK. Korean Prosecutor offices are known to trump-up charges against innocent and cover up crimes of powerful in order <b>to</b> <b>curry</b> <b>favors.</b> With Lee being the most likely winner in the upcoming 2007 presidential election, the [...] "highly political" [...] Kim Hong-il of the Seoul Central District Prosecutors Office cleared Lee of any wrong-doing. Kim Hong-il and rest of the prosecutors who manipulated the BBK case to clear Lee but trumped-up charges against Kim, were all promoted to prestigious positions in the prosecutor's office after Lee was elected. However, after prosecutors declaring that Lee had nothing to do with BBK and just three days before the election, a video of a speech Lee gave to students at Kwangwoon University in October 2000 surfaced, in which Lee admitted that he had founded and managed BBK's activities. Two days before the election, the National Assembly appointed a prosecutor to investigate.|$|R

He also aided Moon Knight by providing information that terrified a SHIELD psychologist into approving Spector's registration as a superhero, but later he bailed one of the Whyos out of jail and the gang member was soon seen in the employ of Norman Osborn.|$|R
500|$|To avert {{a republican}} backlash, Ouro Preto {{exploited}} the ready credit available to Brazil {{as a result}} of its prosperity. He made available massive loans at favorable interest rates to plantation owners and lavishly granted titles and lesser honors <b>to</b> <b>curry</b> <b>favor</b> with influential political figures who had become disaffected. He also indirectly began to address the problem of the recalcitrant military by revitalizing the moribund National Guard, by then an entity which existed mostly only on paper. As the Count of Nioac, a noted politician, remarked: [...] "I call your attention especially to the reorganization of the National Guard, in order to possess this force with which in past times the government suppressed military revolts. If we had had the National Guard reorganized, the Deodoros and other ignorant military men would have been quiet." [...] Pedro II also asked Salvador Mendonça, who was leaving to the U.S. to represent Brazil at the First International Conference of American States, to carefully study the U.S. Supreme Court with the goal of creating a similar tribunal in Brazil and transferring his constitutional prerogatives to it. This would have made the monarch a mere figurehead. It is not known if he intended to constrain his daughter's powers as empress and make her thus more palatable to the politicians, or whether he had something else in mind.|$|E
500|$|On November 22, 1858, General William Larimer, a land {{speculator}} {{from eastern}} Kansas Territory, placed cottonwood logs to stake a {{claim on the}} bluff overlooking {{the confluence of the}} South Platte River and Cherry Creek, across the creek from the existing mining settlement of Auraria, and {{on the site of the}} existing townsite of St. Charles. Larimer named the townsite Denver City <b>to</b> <b>curry</b> <b>favor</b> with Kansas Territorial Governor James W. Denver. Larimer hoped the town's name would help make it the county seat of Arapaho County but, unbeknownst to him, Governor Denver had already resigned from office. The location was accessible to existing trails and was across the South Platte River from the site of seasonal encampments of the Cheyenne and Arapaho. The site of these first towns is now the site of Confluence Park near downtown Denver. Larimer, along with associates in the St. Charles City Land Company, sold parcels in the town to merchants and miners, with the intention of creating a major city that would cater to new immigrants. Denver City was a frontier town, with an economy based on servicing local miners with gambling, saloons, livestock and goods trading. In the early years, land parcels were often traded for grubstakes or gambled away by miners in Auraria. In May 1859, Denver City residents donated 53 lots to the Leavenworth & Pike's Peak Express in order to secure the region's first overland wagon route. Offering daily service for [...] "passengers, mail, freight, and gold," [...] the Express reached Denver on a trail that trimmed westward travel time from twelve days to six. In 1863, Western Union furthered Denver's dominance of the region by choosing the city for its regional terminus.|$|E

2500|$|According {{to legal}} {{historian}} Scott Powe, {{much of the}} opposition to Brandeis' appointment also stemmed from [...] "blatant anti-semitism." [...] Taft would accuse Brandeis of using his Judaism <b>to</b> <b>curry</b> political <b>favor,</b> and Wickersham would refer to Brandeis' supporters (and Taft's critics) as [...] "a bunch of Hebrew uplifters." [...] Senator Henry Cabot Lodge privately complained that [...] "If it were not that Brandeis is a Jew, and a German Jew, {{he would never have}} been appointed" ...|$|R

50|$|Around 52, Pharasmanes instigated Rhadamistus, whose {{ambitious and}} {{aspiring}} character began {{to give him}} umbrage, to make war upon his uncle Mithridates, and supported him in his enterprise. After a short reign, Rhadamistus was in turn expelled by the Parthians in 55, and took refuge again in his father's dominions. The Romans had expressed their displeasure at the proceedings of Rhadamistus, and in order <b>to</b> <b>curry</b> their <b>favor,</b> Pharasmanes put his son to death.
