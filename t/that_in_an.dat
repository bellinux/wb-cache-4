5|$|At {{the time}} of the premiere, Italy had {{experienced}} political and social unrest for several years. The start of the Holy Year in December 1899 attracted the religious to the city, but also brought threats from anarchists and other anticlericals. Police received warnings of an anarchist bombing of the theatre, and instructed Mugnone (who had survived a theatre bombing in Barcelona), <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> emergency he was to strike up the royal march. The unrest caused the premiere to be postponed by one day, to 14January.|$|E

5|$|Jan Wiley {{was cast}} as Scott's wife, Virginia. Although Wiley had {{appeared}} in several movies throughout the 1930s and 1940s, The Brute Man marked one of her final film performances. It was also recalled {{as one of her}} most memorable film appearances along with another Universal Pictures B horror film, She-Wolf of London. However, her performance in The Brute Man proved to be a less than memorable one for her, so much so <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> interview shortly before Wiley's death in 1993, she could barely remember even having appeared in the film. Donald MacBride and Peter Whitney portray the police officers Captain M.J. Donelly and Lieutenant Gates, respectively. Their roles serve as comic relief for the film. Their characters portray the incompetence of the police force in their inability to find and arrest the Creeper and their focus on passing blame for their failures rather than diverting resources toward his arrest.|$|E
5|$|On February 3, 1969, Eduardo Mondlane {{was killed}} by {{explosives}} smuggled into his locale.

5|$|The {{university}} has {{been regarded as}} being elitist by some commentators, taking 41% of its undergraduate students from non-state schools, {{according to the most}} recent 2009/2010 figures, despite the fact that such pupils make up just 7% of the population and 18% of 16+ year old pupils across the UK. The intake of state school pupils at Bristol is lower than many Oxbridge colleges. The high ratio of undergraduates from non-state school has led to some tension at the university. In late February and early March 2003, Bristol became embroiled in a row about admissions policies, with some private schools threatening a boycott based on their claims <b>that,</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> effort to improve equality of access, the university was discriminating against their students. These claims were hotly denied by the university.|$|E
