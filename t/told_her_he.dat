5|$|The {{day before}} Jamila's execution, Ibrahim meets with Susi, who tells him about Jamila's romantic {{involvement}} with Nurdin. Jamila became pregnant with Nurdin's child {{and insisted that}} he take responsibility, but instead Nurdin <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>he</b> was marrying someone else and humiliated her in public. When the two met in a hotel, Nurdin threatened Jamila with a pistol; in self-defence, Jamila killed him with the pistol. In the modern day, Jamila walks towards her execution; {{the president has not}} responded to the request for stay. The screen fades to black as a gunshot goes off, and afterwards, statistics about child trafficking and prostitution are shown.|$|E

5|$|Ezra Meeker {{married his}} {{childhood}} sweetheart, Eliza Jane Sumner, in May 1851. The Sumners lived about four miles from Indianapolis, {{and like the}} Meekers were family farmers who did not hire help. When he asked her for her hand, he <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>he</b> wanted to farm, which she accepted {{as long as it}} was on their own property. In October 1851, the couple set out for Eddyville, Iowa, where they rented a farm. They had heard that land in Eddyville would be free, but this was not the case. Ezra, working in a surveyor's camp, decided that he did not like Iowa's wintersâ€”a prejudice shared by his pregnant wife. Reports were circulating through the prairies about the Oregon Territory's free land and mild climate. Also influencing the decision was the urging of Oliver Meeker who, with friends, had outfitted for the trip to Oregon near Indianapolis, and had come to Eddyville to recruit his brother. Ezra and Eliza Jane Meeker vacillated on the decision, and it was not until early April 1852, more than a month after the birth of their son Marion, that they decided to travel the Oregon Trail.|$|E
5|$|Later, Judge Donnelly {{is nearly}} killed when {{she sits on}} a needle filled with {{potassium}} chloride at her home; she is saved when Stabler and Benson rush her to the hospital. O'Halloran tells Stabler and Benson that a mosquito sucked the blood from the killer {{as he or she}} was rigging Zimmer's car, and that the DNA from the blood will likely implicate Harrison. As the DNA is later being processed, however, O'Halloran is stabbed and killed by someone in the forensics lab. Stabler arrives and sees on the computer screen that the DNA matches Stuckey just before Stuckey knocks him out from behind. Stuckey then answers Elliot's phone when Benson calls to say that Stabler went out for lunch and forgot his phone. He then ties Stabler to a chair and starts torturing him. Stuckey admits he killed the woman at Coney Island in order to frame Harrison, and that he attacked Zimmer and Donnelly for embarrassing him. Benson arrives and is held at gunpoint by Stuckey, but she convinces Stuckey that she, too, hates Stabler and is in love with Stuckey. While Benson kisses Stuckey to distract him, Stabler kicks him from behind, allowing Benson to knock Stuckey out and free Stabler. When Stabler asks how Benson knew he was in trouble, Benson says that Stuckey <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>he</b> went out for sushi, which she knows that Stabler hates.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) and Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) {{decide not}} to get {{together}} officially until he breaks up with Jessica (Eleanor Seigler). On {{their way back to}} Scranton, they stop at Jessica's family's log cabin, where they encounter a bunch of Jessica's friends having a bachelorette party and drinking. Andy and Erin decide to bail, but Jessica returns from her morning run. After staying a while, Andy asks Jessica into the kitchen where she deduces that he is breaking up with her. Erin is surprised however when Jessica said that Andy <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>he</b> did not think Erin was relationship material. Andy does not deny saying that, instead opting to claim that he is gay and leaves awkwardly with Erin. In the car, Andy says he made those comments about Erin because he was with Jessica before Erin falls asleep. Andy decides to head back to the cabin to tell Jessica and her party that he broke up with her because he wanted to be with Erin and that she is relationship material, while Erin overhears. Jessica and her party chase Andy and Erin back to the car. Erin passionately kisses Andy inside the car while the party throws cake at them, prompting a quick getaway.|$|E

25|$|After {{taking her}} to dinner on December 10, Kosova said Acremant pulled out a gun and a stun gun as they sat in her truck and <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>he</b> had killed three people; two just that week. He {{unscrewed}} the silencer on the gun and showed her the blood inside.|$|E
25|$|The first {{contract}} writer {{she hired}} {{was not a}} writer but a movie producer whom she met {{at a dinner party}} hosted by the writer Marie Brenner. The producer <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>he</b> was going to California for the trial of the strangler of his daughter. As solace, Brown suggested for him to keep a diary and his report (headlined Justice) proved the launch of the long magazine career of Dominick Dunne.|$|E
60|$|Vassili <b>told</b> <b>her</b> why <b>he</b> had come, {{and all he}} {{had seen}} and heard on the way.|$|R

From 1840 to 1841, she {{received}} three letters from him, though in his third letter he <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>he</b> had sent five. Peter said he also never received any of her letters. When the ship returned to port in 1842, Peter was not on board and Truth never heard from him again.|$|E
25|$|During their separation, Tierney met John F. Kennedy, a young World War II veteran, who {{was visiting}} {{the set of}} Dragonwyck in 1946. They began a romance that she ended the {{following}} year after Kennedy <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>he</b> could never marry her because of his political ambitions. In 1960, Tierney sent Kennedy a note of congratulations on his victory in the presidential election. During this time, newspapers documented Tierney's other romantic relationships, including Kirk Douglas.|$|E
25|$|At about 3:00p.m., {{shortly after}} forcing {{a group of}} police {{officers}} to take cover in a ditch, Bryant rang the local police station. The wife {{of one of the}} police officers answered the phone. Bryant asked who she was and if she knew where her husband was. He again called himself Jamie. He asked if she knew whether or not her husband was okay, and when she did not answer, Bryant then <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>he</b> was okay and that he knew where her husband was.|$|E

50|$|He {{tries to}} make up his mind. He felt {{slightly}} stronger for DeAnna. But in the end, when DeAnna really thought that they'll be in a monogamous relationship because she's the last one standing, <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> that <b>he</b> couldn't marry <b>her.</b> <b>He</b> had a reason that he sent Jenni home but he couldn't find a reason for DeAnna. <b>He</b> only <b>told</b> <b>her</b> that <b>he</b> wasn't sure if their relationship was going to last, he's not fully there with <b>her.</b> <b>He</b> was not that deeply into either of them.|$|R
25|$|In 1947, Columbia Pictures offered Hellman a multi-year {{contract}}, {{which she}} refused because the contract included a loyalty clause that she {{viewed as an}} infringement on her rights of free speech and association. It required her to sign a statement {{that she had never}} {{been a member of the}} Communist Party and would not associate with radicals or subversives, which would have required her to end her life with Hammett. Shortly thereafter, William Wyler <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>he</b> was unable to hire her to work on a film because she was blacklisted.|$|E
25|$|On 4 March 1995, {{an eight-year-old}} girl was {{abducted}} and sexually assaulted in the Langley Green area of Crawley. Whiting was arrested {{a few weeks}} later after a man who knew Whiting came forward after hearing that the abductor's car had been a red Ford Sierra, which matched the description of the car that Whiting had just sold. The vehicle was then traced by police to its new owner and a knife was found hidden in it; the victim had claimed that her abductor had <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>he</b> had a knife in his possession.|$|E
25|$|In a {{biography}} published in 2011, William M. Adler concludes that Hill was probably innocent of murder, but {{also suggests that}} Hill came to see himself as worth more to the labor movement as a dead martyr than he was alive, and that this understanding may have influenced his decisions not to testify at the trial and subsequently to spurn all chances of a pardon. Adler reports that evidence pointed to early police suspect Frank Z. Wilson, and cites Hilda Erickson's letter, which states that Hill had <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>he</b> had been shot by her former fiance.|$|E
50|$|Ayyappa also <b>told</b> <b>her</b> that <b>He</b> {{will marry}} <b>her</b> when no first timer (kanni Ayyappa) comes to Sabarimala Ayyappa temple.|$|R

25|$|Israeli emigrants {{working in}} low status {{immigrant}} occupations that the diaspora Jewish population tends {{not to engage}} in or has long-ago abandoned such as taxi driving, auto repair, security guards, mall cart sales and other tasks. Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir told of a waiter who once came over to her at a New York luncheon and whispered in Hebrew that there was ham in the dish she had been served. When she asked him how he knew Hebrew, he <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>he</b> was an Israeli. And what work had he done in Israel, she asked. He had been a waiter, he responded.|$|E
25|$|A women's shelter, Sojourn, {{received}} a call from Brown four days prior to the murders; she said that she was afraid of her ex-husband, whom she believed was stalking her. The prosecution did not present this information in court because they thought that Judge Ito would rule the evidence to be hearsay. In addition, friends and family indicated that Brown had consistently said that Simpson had been stalking her. She claimed that everywhere she went, she noticed Simpson would be there, watching her. Her friends Faye Resnick and Cynthia Shahian said she was afraid because Simpson had <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>he</b> would kill her if he ever found her with another man.|$|E
25|$|On June 30, Cherilyn Lee, a {{nurse who}} had worked as Jackson's nutritionist, {{said that he had}} asked her in May to provide {{propofol}} to help him sleep, but she refused. He <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>he</b> had been given the drug before for persistent insomnia, and that a doctor had said it was safe. Lee said she received a telephone call from an aide to Jackson on June 21 to say that Jackson was ill, although she no longer worked for him. She reported overhearing Jackson complain that one side of his body was hot, the other side cold. She advised the aide to send Jackson to a hospital.|$|E

60|$|And when <b>he</b> answered, <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> {{recklessly}} that <b>he</b> had {{not been}} to see her because his best clothes were in pawn. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>her</b> that <b>he</b> had been sick, but was once more nearly well, and that inside ten days or two weeks (as soon as a letter could travel to New York City and return) he would redeem his clothes and be with her.|$|R
