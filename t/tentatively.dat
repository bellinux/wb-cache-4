5|$|Traces of Klaphake's {{condensers}} {{have been}} <b>tentatively</b> identified.|$|E
5|$|Hard Target was <b>tentatively</b> {{scheduled}} to open in July 1993. Hard Target was released August 20, 1993 in the United States making it the first film by an Asian director to be released by a Hollywood studio.|$|E
5|$|In May 2017, IndiGo has <b>tentatively</b> {{signed for}} 50 ATR 72-600 for the UDAN {{regional}} connectivity scheme, {{to be delivered}} from the year end for up to 20 {{by the end of}} 2018.|$|E
5|$|Some eggs <b>tentatively</b> {{assigned}} to Macroolithus are {{known from the}} Wangshi Group in Laiyang, Shandong. The formations of the Wangshi group were deposited in alluvial fans, braided channels and shallow lakes. Common fossils include hadrosaurids and dinosaur eggs.|$|E
5|$|The SMP range 1CA80–1CDBF {{has been}} <b>tentatively</b> {{allocated}} for encoding the Rongorongo script. An encoding proposal {{has been written}} by Michael Everson.|$|E
5|$|The hoard is now {{on display}} at the Craven Museum & Gallery. An Iron Age or Romano-British {{settlement}} has been <b>tentatively</b> identified on the banks of Gate Up Gill on the moors to the north-west of the village.|$|E
5|$|A novel {{adaptation}} of The Fifth Element, written by Terry Bisson, {{was published by}} HarperPrism in 1997. There were rumors after the film's release {{that it would be}} followed by a sequel, <b>tentatively</b> titled Mr. Shadow. In 2011, Besson stated that a sequel was never planned, and that he has no desire to make one.|$|E
5|$|Ammonia was <b>tentatively</b> {{detected}} on Mars by the Mars Express satellite, {{but with}} its relatively short lifetime, {{it is not}} clear what produced it. Ammonia is not stable in the Martian atmosphere and breaks down after a few hours. One possible source is volcanic activity.|$|E
5|$|Chris Meledandri, CEO of Illumination Entertainment, said in July 2010 that {{a sequel}} {{was in the}} works. Release was <b>tentatively</b> {{scheduled}} for July 3, 2013. Miranda Cosgrove stated on her official Facebook and Twitter page on October 14, 2011 that she had recorded her first lines, while Meledandri confirmed in February 2012 that they had started working on the film.|$|E
5|$|Daniel Anlezark has <b>tentatively</b> {{suggested}} that Dunstan {{may be the}} medieval author of Solomon and Saturn citing the style, word choice, and Hiberno-Latin used in the texts. However, Clive Tolley examines this claim from a linguistic point-of-view and disagrees with Anlezark's claim.|$|E
5|$|DuPont's {{withdrawal}} {{also came}} months after John DuPont, {{heir to the}} Du Pont family fortune, {{had been arrested for}} the murder of Olympic wrestler Dave Schultz. At the time of the announcement of DuPont's discontinuation of sponsorship, Mike Plant reported that a 1997 event was <b>tentatively</b> scheduled for May 1–11, and that he had been in discussions with ten companies about potential title sponsorship of the race.|$|E
5|$|In late July, the {{presiding}} judge, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Craig Karlan, {{reported that a}} preliminary ruling that could have affected the game's release would have been given on August 6, 2009, with Karlan <b>tentatively</b> ready to deny Activision's motion to delay the game. However, prior to the ruling, the companies announced they had reached an out-of-court settlement on the lawsuits, though details were not available.|$|E
5|$|In {{the audio}} {{commentary}} for Alien: Covenant, Scott confirmed that {{a sequel to}} Alien: Covenant, <b>tentatively</b> referred to as Alien: Covenant 2, is being written by John Logan, with Michael Fassbender, Katherine Waterston and Danny McBride reprising their roles. Scott also confirmed that the film will cap his prequel series, leading directly into the events of Alien.|$|E
5|$|Jackson edited unused {{material}} from the Division Bell sessions, described by Mason as ambient music, into an hour-long composition <b>tentatively</b> titled The Big Spliff, but Pink Floyd decided not to release it. Some of The Big Spliff was used to create the band's final album, The Endless River (2014).|$|E
5|$|La Trinidad de Nosotros {{has been}} <b>tentatively</b> {{identified}} as Xililchi, a settlement visited by conquistador Martín de Ursúa after Spanish Conquest of the Itza capital Noj Petén in 1697, but no Late Postclassic remains have yet been securely identified.|$|E
5|$|Marketplaces are {{difficult}} to identify archaeologically. However, the Spanish reported a thriving market economy when they arrived in the region. At some Classic period cities, archaeologists have <b>tentatively</b> identified formal arcade-style masonry architecture and parallel alignments of scattered stones as the permanent foundations of market stalls. A 2007 study analysed soils from a modern Guatemalan market and compared the results with those obtained from analysis at a proposed ancient market at Chunchucmil. Unusually high levels of zinc and phosphorus at both sites indicated similar food production and vegetable sales activity. The calculated density of market stalls at Chunchucmil strongly suggests that a thriving market economy already existed in the Early Classic. Archaeologists have <b>tentatively</b> identified marketplaces at {{an increasing number of}} Maya cities by means of a combination of archaeology and soil analysis. When the Spanish arrived, Postclassic cities in the highlands had markets in permanent plazas, with officials on hand to settle disputes, enforce rules, and collect taxes.|$|E
5|$|Of {{particular}} {{interest is the}} fact that the Schechter Letter account of Oleg's death (namely, that he fled to and raided FRS, <b>tentatively</b> identified with Persia, and was slain there) bears remarkable parallels to the account of Arab historians such as Ibn Miskawayh, who described a similar Rus' attack on the Muslim state of Arran in the year 944/5.|$|E
5|$|One author {{regarded}} C.dentatus as {{a synonym}} of Coccomyces coronatus, although later authors have treated them separately. In 1923, Carlos Luigi Spegazzini <b>tentatively</b> reported {{the presence of}} C.dentatus on fallen Nothofagus leaves in Tierra del Fuego (southern South America); this species was later identified as a distinct species, C.australis.|$|E
5|$|Paali Nala, {{where the}} M2 <b>tentatively</b> {{assigned}} to Dermotherium chimaera was found, {{is in the}} Bugti Hills of Balochistan, western Pakistan. The fossil locality, placed stratigraphically in the Bugti Member of the Chitarwata Formation, {{is thought to be}} Early Oligocene in age. The Paali Nala fauna also contains a diverse array of mammals, including many rodents, some primates, and rhinos.|$|E
5|$|Ronnie Rocket was {{to feature}} {{many of the}} {{elements}} which have since come {{to be seen as}} Lynch's hallmarks; including industrial art direction, 1950s popular culture and physical deformity. The script featured a three-foot tall man with control over electricity; Lynch first met Michael J. Anderson when <b>tentatively</b> casting for this role, and later cast him in Twin Peaks and Mulholland Drive as a result.|$|E
5|$|The {{evolutionary}} {{relationships of}} the Pondicherry shark are uncertain. In a 1988 study based on morphological data, Compagno <b>tentatively</b> grouped {{it with the}} smalltail shark (C. porosus), blackspot shark (C. sealei), spottail shark (C. sorrah), creek whaler (C. fitzroyensis), whitecheek shark (C. dussumieri), Borneo shark (C. borneensis), and hardnose shark (C. macloti).|$|E
5|$|The {{final version}} was {{exhibited}} {{where it was}} intended to be in June 1915. In the following year, it was shown at the art gallery Liljevalchs konsthall as its first exhibit was dedicated to Carl Larsson, Bruno Liljefors and Anders Zorn. It was <b>tentatively</b> shown again in Nationalmuseum during the period 1925–1933. In 1942, the painting was stored in the Museum of Sketches in Lund.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} several engine {{failures}} in the early service of the CFM56 family which were serious enough to either ground the fleet or require aspects of the engine to be redesigned. The engines have also suffered, periodically, from thrust instability events <b>tentatively</b> traced to Honeywell's hydromechanical unit.|$|E
5|$|There is {{also the}} presumed site of a chapel near MacLean's Point (just east of the landing place) where an incised cross, <b>tentatively</b> dated to between the sixth and ninth centuries was found. Archaeological {{evidence}} of the Norse presence in the Hebrides is scant, but boat shaped stone settings found {{not far from the}} chapel may be graves from this period of occupation.|$|E
5|$|Waptia fieldensis is {{the only}} species {{classified}} under the genus Waptia. Although it bears a remarkable resemblance to modern crustaceans, its taxonomic affinities remain unclear. It is currently classified as a stem group crustacean and <b>tentatively</b> included in the clade Crustaceomorpha.|$|E
5|$|A. tendagurensis {{was named}} in 1925 by Werner Janensch for a partial shin (MB.R.3620) {{found in the}} Kimmeridgian-age Tendaguru Formation in Mtwara, Tanzania. Although {{tabulated}} as a <b>tentatively</b> valid species of Allosaurus in the second edition of the Dinosauria, subsequent studies place it as indeterminate beyond Tetanurae, either a carcharodontosaurian or megalosaurid. Although obscure, {{it was a large}} theropod, possibly around 10meters long (33ft) and 2.5metric tons (2.8short tons) in weight.|$|E
5|$|According to Tchernov's 1962 paper, Passer predomesticus {{was found}} in the middle Acheulean (middle Pleistocene, {{probably}} more than 400,000 years old) layer E1 of the Oumm-Qatafa cave in Wadi Khareitoun near Bethlehem. In 1984, however, Tchernov wrote that P.predomesticus was about 140,000 years old, from the Yabrudian. Layer E1 contained remains of about 40bird species, including a premaxilla Tchernov described as a precursor of the Dead Sea sparrow (Passer moabiticus) and a tarsometatarsus and humerus <b>tentatively</b> allied with the house sparrow. An undetermined Acheulean layer of the same cave also contained fossils Tchernov described as precursors of both the house and Spanish sparrows.|$|E
5|$|After Dutch forces massacred 10,000 ethnic Chinese in Batavia (now Jakarta), a {{group of}} {{survivors}} led by Khe Pandjang headed east for Semarang. Despite being warned of the impending uprising, {{the head of the}} Dutch East India Company's military Bartholomeus Visscher ignored his advisers and did not prepare reinforcements. As the situation developed, the court of , Sunan of Mataram, decided to <b>tentatively</b> support the Chinese while seemingly helping the Dutch.|$|E
5|$|After the 1919 season, {{representatives of}} four Ohio League teams—the Canton Bulldogs, the Cleveland Tigers, the Dayton Triangles, and the Akron Pros—called {{a meeting on}} August 20, 1920, to discuss the {{formation}} of a new league. At the meeting, they <b>tentatively</b> agreed on a salary cap and pledged not to sign college players or players already under contract with other teams. They also agreed on a name for the circuit: the American Professional Football Conference. They then invited other professional teams to a second meeting on September 17.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the time}} of the disappearances, Gui Minhai was rumoured to have been working on a book {{regarding}} current CPC general secretary Xi Jinping's personal history, <b>tentatively</b> named Xi and His Six Women (習近平和他的六個女人). The project was suggested to be linked to the disappearances. The publishing house had also already gone to press with a book entitled 2017: Upheaval in China, but it was withdrawn by the author before publication.|$|E
5|$|As {{the regular}} sacrifices {{continue}} the islanders approach the king for help, {{as they are}} worried there will soon be no young girls left. The king again asks {{the advice of the}} spaeman, who <b>tentatively</b> suggests that the king's only daughter, Princess Gem-de-lovely, his most prized possession, will have to be offered to the stoor worm to encourage it to leave. During the ten-week period of grace before the princess has to be sacrificed, messengers are despatched to every corner of the realm offering the kingdom, marriage to the princess, and the magic sword the king had inherited from the god Odin.|$|E
5|$|Based on morphology, Jack Garrick {{suggested}} in 1982 that the nervous shark {{is closely related}} to the blacktip reef shark (C. melanopterus). Leonard Compagno in 1988 <b>tentatively</b> grouped these two species with the blacknose shark (C. acronotus), the copper shark (C. brachyurus), the silky shark (C. falciformis), and the night shark (C. signatus). The close relationship between the nervous and blacktip reef sharks was upheld in a 1992 phylogenetic study by Shane Lavery, based on allozymes, and again in a 2011 study by Ximena Vélez-Zuazoa and Ingi Agnarsson, based on nuclear and mitochondrial genes.|$|E
5|$|Based on morphology, Leonard Compagno in 1988 <b>tentatively</b> grouped the smoothtooth blacktip shark {{with the}} spinner shark (C. brevipinna), the blacktip shark (C. limbatus), the graceful shark (C. amblyrhynchoides), and the finetooth shark (C. isodon). Using {{molecular}} phylogenetic techniques on mitochondrial DNA sequences, Alec Moore and colleagues reported in 2011 that this species {{is closely related}} to the graceful shark, the blacktip shark, and the Australian blacktip shark (C. tilstoni).|$|E
5|$|Before leaving office, Mahathir had {{condemned}} Malays who {{relied on}} their privileges. Abdullah continued this, warning Malays {{to learn to}} live without crutches or end up in wheelchairs. His administration began the practice of meritocracy, which Mahathir had <b>tentatively</b> proposed, and university admissions quotas were eliminated. However, some charged that this did not eliminate discrimination in education. The pre-university stream was divided into two; one course prepared students for the Sijil Tinggi Persekolahan Malaysia (STPM) standardised examination, lasting two years, while the other comprised various matriculation courses graded by individual lecturers, typically lasting a year.|$|E
5|$|Compositional mapping and Io's {{high density}} suggest that Io {{contains}} {{little to no}} water, though small pockets of water ice or hydrated minerals have been <b>tentatively</b> identified, most notably on the northwest flank of the mountain Gish Bar Mons. Io has {{the least amount of}} water of any known body in the Solar System. This lack of water is likely due to Jupiter being hot enough early {{in the evolution of the}} Solar System to drive off volatile materials like water in the vicinity of Io, but not hot enough to do so farther out.|$|E
5|$|Economic {{authority}} {{would have}} {{rested on the}} control of cotton and edible plants and associated trade relationships, with power centered on the inland sites. Haas <b>tentatively</b> suggests that {{the scope of this}} economic power base may have extended widely: there are only two confirmed shore sites in the Norte Chico (Aspero and Bandurria) and possibly two more, but cotton fishing nets and domesticated plants have been found up and down the Peruvian coast. It is possible that the major inland centers of Norte Chico were {{at the center of a}} broad regional trade network centered on these resources.|$|E
