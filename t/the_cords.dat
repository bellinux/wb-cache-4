5|$|Several {{observers}} (including Plait and Tyson) {{said that}} in the scene in which Kowalski unclips his tether and floats away to his death to save Stone from being pulled away from the ISS, Stone would simply need to tug the tether gently to pull Kowalski toward her. According to the film's science adviser Kevin Grazier and NASA engineer Robert Frost, however, the pair are still decelerating with Stone's leg caught in the parachute cords from the Soyuz. <b>The</b> <b>cords</b> stretch as they absorb her kinetic energy. Kowalski thinks that <b>the</b> <b>cords</b> are not strong enough to absorb his kinetic energy as well as hers, and that he must release the tether to give Stone a chance of stopping before <b>the</b> <b>cords</b> fail and doom both of them.|$|E
5|$|For {{protection}} and preservation, a polished Japanese sword needs a scabbard. A fully mounted scabbard (koshirae) may {{consist of a}} lacquered body, a taped hilt, a sword guard (tsuba) and decorative metal fittings. Though the original purpose was to protect a sword from damage, from early times on Japanese sword mountings became a status symbol and were used to add dignity. Starting in the Heian period, a sharp distinction was made between swords designed for use in battle and those for ceremonial use. Tachi long swords were worn edge down suspended by two cords or chains from the waist belt. <b>The</b> <b>cords</b> were attached to two eyelets on the scabbard.|$|E
5|$|The {{central nervous}} system {{consists}} of a brain and paired ventral nerve cords that connect to the brain and run {{along the length of}} the body. The brain is a ring of four ganglia, masses of nerve cells, positioned round the rhynchocoel near its front end – while the brains of most protostome invertebrates encircle the foregut. Most nemertean species have just one pair of nerve cords, many species have additional paired cords, and some species also have a dorsal cord. In some species <b>the</b> <b>cords</b> lie within the skin, but in most they are deeper, inside the muscle layers. The {{central nervous system}} is often red or pink because it contains hemoglobin. This stores oxygen for peak activity or when the animal experiences anoxia, for example while burrowing in oxygen-free sediments.|$|E
50|$|Campaign cords are {{generally}} {{made up of}} three components; <b>the</b> <b>cord</b> itself, <b>the</b> keeper and <b>the</b> acorns. <b>The</b> <b>cord</b> may wrap around the hat twice, while the keeper keeps <b>the</b> <b>cord</b> together, and allows {{for it to be}} adjusted for a different size hat. The acorns are at the end of <b>the</b> <b>cord</b> and are mainly decoration, though obviously serve to stop <b>the</b> <b>cord</b> coming slipping out of the keeper.|$|R
5000|$|In some animals, {{the mother}} will gnaw through <b>the</b> <b>cord,</b> thus {{separating}} <b>the</b> placenta from <b>the</b> offspring. <b>The</b> <b>cord</b> along with <b>the</b> placenta is often eaten by the mother, to provide nourishment and {{to dispose of}} tissues that would otherwise attract scavengers or predators. In chimpanzees, the mother leaves <b>the</b> <b>cord</b> in place and nurses her young with <b>the</b> <b>cord</b> and placenta attached until <b>the</b> <b>cord</b> dries out and separates naturally, within a day of birth, at which time <b>the</b> <b>cord</b> is discarded. (This was first documented by zoologists in the wild in 1974.) ...|$|R
2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>cord</b> can be clamped at {{different}} times; however delaying the clamping of <b>the</b> umbilical <b>cord</b> until one minute after birth improves outcomes {{as long as}} there is the ability to treat jaundice if it occurs. Clamping is followed by cutting of <b>the</b> <b>cord,</b> which is painless due to the absence of nerves. [...] <b>The</b> <b>cord</b> is extremely tough, like thick sinew, and so cutting it requires a suitably sharp instrument. [...] While umbilical severance may be delayed until after <b>the</b> <b>cord</b> has stopped pulsing (5–20 minutes after birth), there is ordinarily no significant loss of either venous or arterial blood while cutting <b>the</b> <b>cord.</b> Current evidence neither supports, nor refutes, delayed cutting of <b>the</b> <b>cord,</b> according to <b>the</b> American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) guidelines.|$|R
25|$|Another Egyptian sling was {{excavated}} in El-Lahun in Al Fayyum Egypt in 1914 by William Matthew Flinders Petrie, and now {{resides in}} the Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology—Petrie dated it to about 800 BC. It was found alongside an iron spearhead. The remains are broken into three sections. Although fragile, the construction is clear: it is made of bast fibre (almost certainly flax) twine; <b>the</b> <b>cords</b> are braided in a 10-strand elliptical sennit and the cradle {{seems to have been}} woven from the same lengths of twine used to form <b>the</b> <b>cords.</b>|$|E
25|$|Modern slings are {{begun by}} {{plaiting}} the cord for the finger loop {{in the center}} of a double-length set of cords. <b>The</b> <b>cords</b> are then folded to form the finger-loop. <b>The</b> <b>cords</b> are plaited as a single cord to the pocket. The pocket is then plaited, most simply as another pair of cords, or with flat braids or a woven net. The remainder of the sling is plaited as a single cord, and then finished with a knot. Braided construction resists stretching, and therefore produces an accurate sling.|$|E
25|$|At {{the centre}} of the sling, a cradle or pouch is constructed. This may be formed by making a wide braid from the same {{material}} as <b>the</b> <b>cords</b> or by inserting a piece of a different material such as leather. The cradle is typically diamond shaped (although some {{take the form of a}} net,) and will fold around the projectile in use. Some cradles have a hole or slit that allows the material to wrap around the projectile slightly, thereby holding it more securely.|$|E

25|$|Though Cabell is {{best known}} as a fantasist, the plots and {{characters}} of his first few novels, The Eagle's Shadow (1904), <b>The</b> <b>Cords</b> of Vanity (1909), and The Rivet in Grandfather's Neck (1915) (later all adapted for inclusion into the Biography), do not wander out of the everyday society of Virginia's beleaguered gentry. But Cabell's signature droll style is clearly in evidence, and in later printings each book would bear a characteristically Cabellian subtitle: A Comedy of Purse-Strings, A Comedy of Shirking, and A Comedy of Limitations, respectively.|$|E
25|$|Seals {{are used}} {{primarily}} to authenticate documents, specifically those which carry some legal import. There {{are two main}} ways in which a seal may be attached to a document. It may be applied directly to {{the face of the}} paper or parchment (an applied seal); or it may hang loose from it (a pendent seal). A pendent seal may be attached to cords or ribbons (sometimes in the owner's livery colors), or to the two ends of a strip (or tag) of parchment, threaded through holes or slots cut in the lower edge of the document: the document is often folded double at this point (a plica) to provide extra strength. Alternatively, the seal may be attached to a narrow strip of the material of the document (again, in this case, usually parchment), sliced and folded down, as a tail or tongue, but not detached. The object in all cases is to help ensure authenticity by maintaining the integrity of the relationship between document and seal, and to prevent the seal's reuse. If a forger tries to remove an applied seal from its document, it will almost certainly break. A pendent seal is easily detached by cutting <b>the</b> <b>cords</b> or strips of parchment, but the forger would then have great difficulty in attaching it to another document (not least because <b>the</b> <b>cords</b> or parchment are normally knotted inside the seal), and would again almost certainly break it.|$|E

After casually revealing his shooter was his brother, he gathers everyone in the emergency room for the revelation of Cartman's father: his mother Liane. Mephesto explains that Liane is a hermaphrodite, someone with both male and female genitalia. He also reveals that hermaphrodites cannot have children, so Liane must have impregnated another woman on her intercourse spree. An angered Cartman, however, refuses to pursue the issue further.|$|E

The SS bodyguards demanded that the tape be immediately destroyed; but YLE was allowed to keep the reel, after promising to keep it in a sealed container. It was given to Kustaa Vilkuna, head of the state censors' office, and in 1957 returned to YLE. It was made available to the public a few years later. It is the only known recording of Hitler speaking in an unofficial tone.|$|E
25|$|I {{should be}} bitter, but I am not. Disappointed, yes, because {{after so many}} heartbreaks this was a rather {{ruthless}} end. I was the fall guy, the player who carried the ACB flag all summer against all the odds. I had to cop it sweet then, and I had to cop my dismissal the same way... We were lambs to the slaughter anyway. Besides or own cricketing shortcomings, we were forced o play on wickets that suited the Englishmen and were alien to us; we copped the bad end of umpiring decisions to a damning degree throughout the Ashes series and we were crucified by media in many quarters from beginning to end. All this, combined with the talented opposition which was expected to whitewash us anyway, was just too much. The hurt that remains is that I tried so hard, {{and so did the}} young, raw team that took on so much despite all the ods.

50|$|Management of a {{presenting}} nuchal cord {{should be}} tailored to prevent umbilical cord compression whenever possible. Techniques to preserve an intact nuchal cord depend on how tightly <b>the</b> <b>cord</b> is wrapped around the infant’s neck. If <b>the</b> <b>cord</b> is loose, it can easily be slipped over the infant’s head. The infant can be delivered normally and placed on maternal abdomen as desired. If <b>the</b> <b>cord</b> is too tight {{to go over the}} infant’s head, the provider may be able to slip it over the infant’s shoulders and deliver the body through <b>the</b> <b>cord.</b> <b>The</b> <b>cord</b> can then be unwrapped from around the baby after birth. Finally, if <b>the</b> <b>cord</b> is too tight to slip back over the shoulders, one may use the somersault maneuver to allow the body to be delivered. The birth attendant may also choose to clamp and cut <b>the</b> umbilical <b>cord</b> to allow for vaginal delivery if other methods of nuchal cord management are not feasible.|$|R
50|$|Cord {{blood cells}} are {{obtained}} from <b>the</b> umbilical <b>cord</b> and placenta of {{a newborn baby}} after <b>the</b> <b>cord</b> is clamped and cut as in a normal delivery. <b>The</b> <b>cord</b> blood is then stored frozen in a bank until needed for a transplant.

50|$|An {{alternate}} V-shaped form of {{the death}} triangle involves clipping a single loop of webbing or cord to both anchors, then clipping the third carabiner over the loop rather than through it, allowing the latter to slip off the loop if either anchor fails. Two better methods are (a) putting a half twist in <b>the</b> <b>cord</b> and clipping <b>the</b> free carabiner through it. If either anchor fails, the free carabiner will remain attached to <b>the</b> <b>cord</b> but if <b>the</b> <b>cord</b> fails, <b>the</b> entire anchor still fails or (b) tying off both strands of <b>the</b> <b>cord</b> with e.g. an overhand knot achieving redundancy by sacrificing perfect equalization, since the length of <b>the</b> <b>cord</b> to each anchor is now fixed.|$|R
25|$|The chariots of Yan Su and Wu Deren {{appear to}} have used this type of mechanism. (See {{descriptions}} quoted from the Song Shi, above.) Apart from the presence of components in Wu Deren's vehicle to make it function as an odometer, there were only minor differences between them. In each chariot, the two main road wheels were attached to vertical gear wheels. A large horizontal gear wheel was linked (possibly via intermediate gearing) to the pointing doll, and was positioned so a diameter almost spanned {{the space between the}} uppermost points of the vertical gear wheels. When the chariot was moving straight ahead, there was no connection between these gears, but when the chariot turned, a small gear wheel was lowered into contact with the horizontal gear and one of the vertical gears, thus linking the doll to one of the road wheels. Two small gear wheels were available, one to connect the horizontal gear to each of the vertical ones. Of course, they were not used simultaneously. The small gear wheels were raised and lowered by an arrangement of weights, pulleys and cords which were attached to the pole to which the horses that pulled the chariot were harnessed. When the horses moved to one side or the other, in order to turn the chariot, the pole moved and <b>the</b> <b>cords</b> lowered the appropriate small gear wheel into its working position. When the horses returned to walking straight ahead, the small gear wheel was raised out of contact with the main horizontal and vertical gears. Thus the system functioned automatically. The mirror-symmetry of the vertical gears being linked by the small gears to the horizontal gear at diametrically opposite points caused the horizontal gear to rotate in opposite directions depending on which road wheel was linked to it, thus rotating the pointing doll in opposite directions when the chariot turned left and right.|$|E
500|$|The {{stitching}} of {{the binding}} uses [...] "Coptic sewing", that is [...] "flexible unsupported sewing (produced by two needles and thread looping round {{one another in}} a figure-of-eight sewing pattern)" [...] Coptic sewing uses small threads both to attach the leaves together and, knotted together, to attach the pages to the cover boards. Normal Western binding uses thread for the former and thicker cord running across the spine of the book for the latter, with the thread knotted onto <b>the</b> <b>cords.</b> [...] Coptic sewing is also found in the earliest surviving leather bookbindings, which are from Coptic libraries in Egypt from the 7th and 8th centuries; in particular the design of the cover of one in the Morgan Library (MS M.569) has been compared to the St Cuthbert Gospel. [...] In the techniques used in the binding, apart from the raised decoration, the closest resemblance is to an even smaller Irish pocket gospel book from some 50 years later, the Cadmug Gospels at Fulda, which is believed to have belonged to Saint Boniface. [...] This is also in red goatskin, with coloured incised lines, and uses a similar unsupported or cordless stitching technique. [...] The first appearance of <b>the</b> <b>cords</b> or supports that these [...] "unsupported" [...] bindings lack is found in two other books at Fulda, and they soon became universal in, and characteristic of, Western bookbinding until the arrival of modern machine techniques. [...] <b>The</b> <b>cords</b> run horizontally across the spine, and are thicker than the threads that hold the pages together. [...] They are attached, typically by lacing through holes or glue, to the two boards of the cover, and the threads holding the gatherings are knotted to them, resulting in a stronger binding.|$|E
