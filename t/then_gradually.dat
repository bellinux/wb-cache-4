5|$|In late September, three {{tropical}} disturbances moved westward {{across the}} eastern Pacific Ocean. One of them organized into a tropical depression on September28. The {{next day the}} depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Monica. The tropical storm initially headed west-northwestward and gradually curved towards the north. It reached its peak intensity of 50mph (85km/h) on September29. Monica <b>then</b> <b>gradually</b> weakened. It became a tropical depression on October1. The cyclone dissipated shortly thereafter. No impact was reported in association with Tropical Storm Monica.|$|E
5|$|Remnants of many supernovae {{consist of}} a compact object and a rapidly {{expanding}} shock wave of material. This cloud of material sweeps up the surrounding interstellar medium during a free expansion phase, which can last {{for up to two}} centuries. The wave <b>then</b> <b>gradually</b> undergoes a period of adiabatic expansion, and will slowly cool and mix with the surrounding interstellar medium over a period of about 10,000years.|$|E
5|$|Similar {{things happen}} in other brain areas: an initial {{synaptic}} matrix is generated {{as a result of}} genetically determined chemical guidance, but <b>then</b> <b>gradually</b> refined by activity-dependent mechanisms, partly driven by internal dynamics, partly by external sensory inputs. In some cases, as with the retina-midbrain system, activity patterns depend on mechanisms that operate only in the developing brain, and apparently exist solely to guide development.|$|E

5|$|The Olympic Games {{reached their}} zenith in the 6th and 5thcenturiesBC, but <b>then</b> <b>gradually</b> {{declined}} in importance as the Romans gained {{power and influence}} in Greece. While there is no scholarly consensus as to when the Games officially ended, the most commonly held date is 393AD, when the emperor Theodosius I decreed that all pagan cults and practices be eliminated. Another date commonly cited is 426AD, when his successor, Theodosius II, ordered the destruction of all Greek temples.|$|E
5|$|This {{concurrency}} ends {{after another}} mile, when US44 diverges {{along the route}} of the former NY44A, going around the village of Millbrook past the Mary Flagler Cary Arboretum, home to the Institute of Ecosystem Studies. The highway returns to a more due-east orientation as it passes north of the village, <b>then</b> <b>gradually</b> curves to the northeast again as it passes through a heavily farmed area.|$|E
5|$|East of Bronte Creek, Highway407 enters an {{agricultural}} area, interspersed with woodlots. It enters Oakville at the Tremaine Road (Halton Regional Road22) overpass, <b>then</b> <b>gradually</b> swerves {{to the north}} as it encounters an interchange with Bronte Road (Halton Regional Road25 and former Highway25). The route crosses Sixteen Mile Creek just north of Glenarchy Conservation Area, then travels parallel to the creek for several kilometres. It swerves north after an interchange with Neyagawa Boulevard, near the hamlet of Glenarchy. After diverging from the creek, it curves northeast, parallel to and north of Burnhamthorpe Road, where it interchanges with Trafalgar Road (Halton Regional Road3). Highway407 then encounters Highway403 at a large interchange where curves sharply to the northwest; Highway403, meanwhile, curves from the southeast to the northeast.|$|E

5|$|The {{dust in the}} gossamer rings {{originates}} in essentially {{the same way as}} that in the main ring and halo. Its sources are the inner Jovian moons Amalthea and Thebe respectively. High velocity impacts by projectiles coming from outside the Jovian system eject dust particles from their surfaces. These particles initially retain the same orbits as their moons but <b>then</b> <b>gradually</b> spiral inward by Poynting–Robertson drag. The thickness of the gossamer rings is determined by vertical excursions of the moons due to their nonzero orbital inclinations. This hypothesis naturally explains almost all observable properties of the rings: rectangular cross-section, decrease of thickness in the direction of Jupiter and brightening of the top and bottom edges of the rings.|$|E
5|$|The highway {{begins to}} curve north, interchanging with Bridgeport Road. The highway crosses the Conestoga Creek as it {{interchanges}} with University Avenue, <b>then</b> <b>gradually</b> curves to the west. After an interchange with King Street, once the original routing of Highway85, the route curves {{back to the}} north and interchanges with Northfield Drive. As it approaches the rural–urban fringe of the tri-city area, the freeway interchanges with King Street a second time. Highway85 ends {{at the north end of}} the ramps from King Street, as does the Conestoga Parkway. The divided freeway ends and the route become Waterloo Regional Road85, which continues north to St. Jacobs and Elmira.|$|E
5|$|The {{scales are}} highly curved, which creates inter-scale reflection. This {{mechanism}} is unusual among Lepidoptera. The proximal {{part of each}} scale is almost flat; the scale <b>then</b> <b>gradually</b> curves up and then steeply bends down at the distal end, covering the proximal part of the next row of scales. Because of this shape, adjacent rows of scales have valley-like grooves between them. This allows light to strike one scale, reflect at a roughly 90° angle, strike the next scale, and be reflected away from the wing. Because the angle of each reflection is far from normal incidence, the interference effect favours reflection of different colours of light than are seen when light strikes {{near the top of}} the curved part of the scale.|$|E

5|$|While most jumping spiders prey {{mainly on}} insects and by active hunting, females of Portia also build webs to catch prey directly. These capture webs are funnel-shaped and widest {{at the top}} and are about 4,000cubic {{centimetres}} in volume. The web is initially built in about 2hours, and <b>then</b> <b>gradually</b> made stronger. A Portia often joins her own web on to one of a web-based non-salticid spider. When not joined to another spiders', a P. labiata female's capture web may be suspended from rigid foundations such as boughs and rocks, or from pliant bases such as stems of shrubs.|$|E
5|$|Once {{posted to}} France in December 1914, the Rhodesian Platoon almost {{immediately}} began suffering regular heavy casualties. Southern Rhodesian volunteers continued to arrive piecemeal in England throughout the conflict, so Rhodesian formations on the Western Front received regular reinforcements in small batches, but because casualties were usually concentrated in far larger groups it often {{took a few}} months for a depleted Southern Rhodesian unit to return to full numerical strength. A cycle developed whereby Rhodesian platoons in Belgium and France were abruptly decimated and <b>then</b> <b>gradually</b> built up again only to suffer the same fate on returning to action. When the KRRC's Rhodesian platoons took part in British offensives, they were easily recognised by a distinctive battle cry that their men shouted as they went over the top. Sometimes the British and German positions were so close that troopers on each front line could hear what was said in the opposite trench; one group of Southern Rhodesians avoided being understood in this situation by speaking a mixture of Shona and Sindebele (two African languages) instead of English.|$|E
5|$|The {{mortality}} rate from paracetamol overdose increases {{two days after}} the ingestion, reaches a maximum on day four, and <b>then</b> <b>gradually</b> decreases. Acidosis is the most important single indicator of probable mortality and the need for transplantation. A {{mortality rate}} of 95% without transplant was reported in patients who had a documented pH less than 7.30. Other indicators of poor prognosis include renal insufficiency (stage3 or worse), hepatic encephalopathy, a markedly elevated prothrombin time, or an elevated blood lactic acid level (lactic acidosis). One study has shown that a factor V level less than 10% of normal indicated a poor prognosis (91% mortality), whereas a ratio of factor VIII to factor V of less than 30 indicated a good prognosis (100% survival). Patients with a poor prognosis are usually identified for likely liver transplantation. Patients that do not die are expected to fully recover and have a normal life expectancy and quality of life.|$|E

5|$|Raising the Mary Rose meant {{overcoming}} {{a number}} of delicate problems {{that had never been}} encountered before. The raising of the Swedish warship Vasa 1959–61 was the only comparable precedent, but it had been a relatively straightforward operation since the hull was completely intact and rested upright on the seabed. It had been raised with basically the same methods as were in use in Tudor England: cables were slung under the hull and attached to two pontoons {{on either side of the}} ship which was <b>then</b> <b>gradually</b> raised and towed into shallower waters. Only one third of the Mary Rose was intact and she lay deeply embedded in mud. If the hull were raised in the traditional way, there was no guarantee that it would have enough structural strength to hold together out of water. Many suggestions for raising the ship were discarded, including the construction of a cofferdam around the wreck site, filling the ship with small buoyant objects (such as ping pong balls) or even pumping brine into the seabed and freezing it so that it would float and take the hull with it. After lengthy discussions it was decided in February 1980 that the hull would first be emptied of all its contents and strengthened with steel braces and frames. It would then be lifted to the surface with floating sheerlegs attached to nylon strops passing under the hull and transferred to a cradle. It was also decided that the ship would be recovered before the end of the diving season in 1982. If the wreck stayed uncovered any longer it risked irreversible damage from biological decay and tidal scouring.|$|E
5|$|Typhoon Karen was {{the most}} {{powerful}} tropical cyclone to strike the island of Guam, and has been {{regarded as one of}} the most destructive events in the island's history. It was first identified as a tropical disturbance on November 6, 1962, well to the southeast of Truk. Over the following two days, the system tracked generally northward and quickly intensified. Karen became a tropical storm late on November 7, and within two days it explosively intensified into a Category 5-equivalent super typhoon on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane scale. Turning westward, the typhoon maintained its intensity and struck Guam with winds of 280 km/h (175 mph) on November 11. Once clear of the island, it strengthened slightly and reached its peak intensity on November 13 with winds of 295 km/h (185 mph) and a barometric pressure of 894 mb (hPa; 26.40 inHg). The storm <b>then</b> <b>gradually</b> turned northward as it weakened, brushing the Ryukyu Islands on November 15, before moving east-northeastward over the open waters of the Pacific. Karen continued to weaken and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on November 17 before losing its identity the following day between Alaska and Hawaii.|$|E
