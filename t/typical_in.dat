5|$|Horn used pre-dated {{technology}} for the album to have sounds unlike what was <b>typical</b> <b>in</b> records that were released at the time. The songs were written by The Buggles between 1977 and 1979, with contributions on several tracks from Bruce Woolley. The backing tracks were recorded at Virgin's Town House in West London, while the vocals were recorded and mixed at Sarm East Studios. Mixing was completed before Christmas 1979.|$|E
5|$|In 1894, after Smith {{returned}} from Germany, she published her second volume Songs for Little Children, Part 2. As in her previous work, {{most of the}} songs were in major keys with the most common being A-flat major and E-flat major. Second, third, fourth and fifth intervals were <b>typical</b> <b>in</b> her voice scores with the piano accompaniment creating interest through varied rhythm patterns. In this volume, most of the compositions were Smith's own work, {{though some of the}} pieces were adaptations of German folk songs.|$|E

5|$|Postural {{instability}} is <b>typical</b> <b>in</b> {{the later}} {{stages of the}} disease, leading to impaired balance and frequent falls, and secondarily to bone fractures, loss of confidence, and reduced mobility. Instability is often absent in the initial stages, especially in younger people, especially prior {{to the development of}} bilateral symptoms. Up to 40% of people diagnosed with PD may experience falls and around 10% may have falls weekly, with the number of falls being related to the severity of PD.|$|E
5|$|The Eurasian {{sparrowhawk}} {{is a small}} bird of prey with short, broad {{wings and}} a long tail, both adaptations to manoeuvring through trees. Females can be up to 25% larger than males and weigh up to twice as much. Marked size difference in this direction is unusual in higher vertebrates but <b>typical</b> <b>in</b> birds of prey, and most marked in birds of prey which hunt birds.|$|E
5|$|When {{a colony}} is dying, for {{whatever}} cause, and other healthy colonies are nearby (as is <b>typical</b> <b>in</b> a bee yard), those healthy colonies often enter the dying colony and rob its provisions {{for their own}} use. If the dying colony's provisions were contaminated (by natural or man-made toxins), the resulting pattern (of healthy colonies becoming sick when in proximity to a dying colony) might suggest to an observer that a contagious disease is involved. However, it is <b>typical</b> <b>in</b> CCD cases that provisions of dying colonies are not being robbed, suggesting that at least this particular mechanism (toxins being spread via robbing, thereby mimicking a disease) {{is not involved in}} CCD. Additional evidence that CCD is an infectious disease came from the following observations: the hives of colonies that had died from CCD could be reused with a healthy colony only if they were first treated with DNA-destroying radiation, and the CCD Working Group report in 2010 indicated that CCD-exhibiting hives tended to occur in proximity to one another within apiaries.|$|E

5|$|By far most {{information}} on toxicity of dioxin-like chemicals {{is based on}} animal studies utilizing TCDD. Almost all organs are affected by high doses of TCDD. In short-term toxicity studies in animals the typical effects are anorexia and wasting, and even after a huge dose animals die only 1 to 6 weeks after the TCDD administration. Seemingly similar species have varying sensitivities to acute effects: lethal dose for a guinea pig is about 1µg/kg, but to a hamster {{it is more than}} 1,000µg/kg. A similar difference can be seen even between two different rat strains. Various hyperplastic (overgrowth) or atrophic (wasting away) responses are seen in different organs, thymus atrophy is very <b>typical</b> <b>in</b> several animal species. TCDD also affects the balance of several hormones. In some species, but not in all, severe liver toxicity is seen. Taking into account the low doses of dioxins in the present human population, only two types of toxic effects have been considered to cause a relevant risk to humans: developmental effects and cancer.|$|E
5|$|Lundy {{is home to}} {{an unusual}} range of mammals, almost all introduced, {{including}} a distinct breed of wild pony, the Lundy pony. Until recently, Lundy and the Shiant Isles in the Hebrides {{were the only two}} places in the UK where the black rat (Rattus rattus) could be found regularly. In the rest of the United Kingdom they have largely been replaced by brown rats except for occasional sightings in port towns and the Thames Estuary. It has since been eradicated on the island, {{in order to protect the}} nesting seabirds. Other species which have made the island their home include the grey seal (Halichoerus grypus), Sika deer (Cervus nippon), pygmy shrew (Sorex minutus) and feral goats (Capra aegagrus hircus). Unusually, 20% of the rabbits (Leporidae) on the island are melanistic compared with 4% which is <b>typical</b> <b>in</b> the UK. In mid-2006 the rabbit population was devastated by myxomatosis, leaving only 60 pairs from the previous 15–20,000 individuals. Soay sheep (Ovis aries) on the island have been shown to vary their behaviours according to nutritional requirements, the distribution of food and the risk of predation.|$|E
5|$|On Late Registration, West drew {{inspiration}} from English trip hop band Portishead and collaborated with film score composer Jon Brion. The album's music blends West's primary soulful hip hop production with Brion's elaborate chamber pop orchestration, and experimentally delves into {{a wide array of}} different genres, including jazz, blues, rock, R, spoken word, funk, turntablism, western classical, and psychedelic soul. With the presence of Brion, who conducts a twenty-piece orchestra and plays instruments individually selected by West, the album is largely orchestral in nature, brandishing a euphony of string arrangements, piano chords, brass flecks, and horn riffs among other symphonic instrumentation. They also incorporated a myriad of foreign and vintage instruments not <b>typical</b> <b>in</b> popular music, let alone hip hop, such as a celesta, harpsichord, Chamberlin, CS-80 analog synthesizer, Chinese bells and berimbau, vibraphones, and marimba.|$|E

5|$|Other {{developmental}} and reproductive variations include haplodiploidy, polymorphism, paedomorphosis or peramorphosis, sexual dimorphism, parthenogenesis and more rarely hermaphroditism. In haplodiploidy, {{which is a}} type of sex-determination system, the offspring's sex is determined by the number of sets of chromosomes an individual receives. This system is <b>typical</b> <b>in</b> bees and wasps. Polymorphism is where a species may have different morphs or forms, as in the oblong winged katydid, which has four different varieties: green, pink and yellow or tan. Some insects may retain phenotypes that are normally only seen in juveniles; this is called paedomorphosis. In peramorphosis, an opposite sort of phenomenon, insects take on previously unseen traits after they have matured into adults. Many insects display sexual dimorphism, in which males and females have notably different appearances, such as the moth Orgyia recens as an exemplar of sexual dimorphism in insects.|$|E
5|$|Parallel {{computing}} {{is closely}} related to concurrent computing—they are frequently used together, and often conflated, though the two are distinct: it is possible to have parallelism without concurrency (such as bit-level parallelism), and concurrency without parallelism (such as multitasking by time-sharing on a single-core CPU). In parallel computing, a computational task is typically broken down in several, often many, very similar subtasks that can be processed independently and whose results are combined afterwards, upon completion. In contrast, in concurrent computing, the various processes often do not address related tasks; when they do, as is <b>typical</b> <b>in</b> distributed computing, the separate tasks may have a varied nature and often require some inter-process communication during execution.|$|E
5|$|Sledd had not {{anticipated}} that the Lake City campus would be abandoned, and had assumed {{that it would be}} selected as the location of the newly consolidated men's university, placing him in a strong position to become the first president of the new institution. The selection of Gainesville for the campus of the new men's university put Sledd's future as its first president in question. The University of Florida in Lake City {{was just one of the}} four existing institutions that were to be merged to form the new university, and there were other possible candidates for the presidency. Albert A. Murphree, president of Florida State College in Tallahassee, was the favorite of several prominent members of the legislature. But Sledd had Governor Broward's backing, and the Board of Control ultimately selected him to be the first president on June 7, 1905; Sledd's appointment was for a single year, but renewable on an annual basis, as was <b>typical</b> <b>in</b> the university's early years when the Board of Control appointed or re-appointed the presidents of the state's public colleges for each academic year. Murphree remained the president of the newly consolidated women's college in Tallahassee until 1909.|$|E

5|$|That same year, {{he joined}} the Schutzstaffel (SS) as an SS-Führer (SS-Leader); his SS number was 168. The SS, {{initially}} part of the much larger SA, was formed in 1923 for Hitler's personal protection, and was re-formed in 1925 as an elite unit of the SA. Himmler's first leadership position in the SS was that of SS-Gauführer (district leader) in Lower Bavaria from 1926. Strasser appointed Himmler deputy propaganda chief in January 1927. As was <b>typical</b> <b>in</b> the NSDAP, he had considerable freedom of action in his post, which increased over time. He began to collect statistics {{on the number of}} Jews, Freemasons, and enemies of the party, and following his strong need for control, he developed an elaborate bureaucracy. In September 1927, Himmler told Hitler of his vision to transform the SS into a loyal, powerful, racially pure elite unit. Convinced that Himmler was the man for the job, Hitler appointed him Deputy Reichsführer-SS, with the rank of SS-Oberführer.|$|E
5|$|The city {{is built}} on the slope {{surrounding}} the citadel, located on a dominating plateau. Although the city's walls {{were built in the}} third century and the city itself was first mentioned in the 12th century, the majority of the existing buildings date from 17th and 18th centuries. Typical houses consist of a tall stone block structure which can be up to five stories high. There are external and internal staircases that surround the house. It is thought that such design stems from fortified country houses <b>typical</b> <b>in</b> southern Albania. The lower storey of the building contains a cistern and the stable. The upper storey is composed of a guest room and a family room containing a fireplace. Further upper stories are to accommodate extended families and are connected by internal stairs. Since Gjirokastër's membership to UNESCO, a number of houses have been restored, though others continue to degrade.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} idea was based around {{the premise of}} creating a town like those found in a role-playing game. The team chose the design elements of a fractured, floating world due to their wish to portray a sky in the game, which is usually not possible with an isometric camera, as it always points down. They also wanted to forgo a map system, and felt that having the ground {{come up to the}} Kid allowed the player to easily see without a map where they had already been in a level. The story of the Calamity was created as a way to explain this game mechanic. Jen Zee developed the art style of the game to express beauty in a post-apocalyptic landscape. The hand-painted style was intended to soften the sharpness she saw as <b>typical</b> <b>in</b> isometric games and the colorless, harsh depictions of most devastated landscapes. Zee was inspired by the pixel art landscapes of earlier Japanese isometric games.|$|E

5|$|The spores are {{smooth and}} cylindrical, {{sometimes}} {{with a slight}} swelling in the middle, and sometimes slightly curved; they measure 59–65 by 4–5µm. G.glutinosum spores have between two and seven septa, although three is most <b>typical</b> <b>in</b> mature specimens. The thin-walled asci (spore-bearing cells) are cylindrical to narrowly club-shaped, eight-spored, and typically measure 200–265µm long by 12–16µm wide. Ascospores occupy about the upper two-thirds to three-quarters of the ascus, leaving a hyaline (transparent) base. The paraphyses, hyaline at the base and brown in the upper regions, are 4–11µm wide, and longer than the asci. Cells {{at the end of}} the paraphyses are pear-shaped (piriform) or spherical, brownish, and measure 8–10µm wide. The sticky material on the stipe is a gelatinous matrix made of a layer of paraphyses.|$|E
5|$|The {{survey showed}} that the breeds suffer from similar rates of ongoing health conditions, with one exception. Whereas {{more than a quarter}} of Pembroke Welsh Corgis {{surveyed}} suffered from some type of eye condition, only 6.1% of the Cardigan Corgis did. Eye conditions <b>typical</b> <b>in</b> the Corgi breeds include progressive retinal atrophy, which occurs more often in dogs over six years of age, and canine glaucoma, which again is more common in older dogs. Similar percentages in the survey were seen in both breeds for issues relating to reproduction, such as requiring caesarian sections and having false pregnancies. Further similarities were also seen related to musculoskelatal issues, including arthritis. However, Hip dysplasia, common in some types of dogs, is rare in the Corgi breeds.|$|E
5|$|Thirty-nine Native American tribal {{governments are}} based in Oklahoma, each holding limited powers within {{designated}} areas.

Tribal governments are recognized by the United States as quasi-sovereign entities with executive, judicial, and legislative powers over tribal members and functions, but {{are subject to the}} authority of the United States Congress to revoke or withhold certain powers. The tribal governments are required to submit a constitution and any subsequent amendments to the United States Congress for approval.|$|E
