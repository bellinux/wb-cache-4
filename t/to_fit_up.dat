2500|$|... 1997: An upscale, [...] "fully loaded" [...] {{version of}} the Eighty-Eight was {{introduced}} as the Oldsmobile Regency to satisfy previous Ninety-Eight buyers. All Oldsmobile Eighty Eight and LSS models (except for the Regency) changed badges from the '80s Oldsmobile [...] "Rocket" [...] logo to the 1997–2004 Oldsmobile [...] "Rocket Oval" [...] logo, inspired by the Aurora's logo. The center console on bucket seat cars was also redesigned <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> <b>up</b> against {{the lower part of}} the dash, allowed for rear passenger vents, and 2 cupholders for front the occupants.|$|E
60|$|So that, in short, {{here was}} a trade which might be carried on for about £30 or £40 stock, {{required}} £300 expenses <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> <b>up</b> the shop, and make a show to invite customers.|$|E
6000|$|She {{continued}} the conversation. [...] "If it's sea water she wants {{it would be}} quite easy <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> <b>up</b> a tank wherever they lived, and she could easily have a bath chair like a sitz bath on wheels.... Really, Mr. Milvain----" ...|$|E
60|$|Although {{disgusted with}} their parsimony on so momentous an occasion, Gianobelli {{set to work}} with the aid of two skilful {{artisans}} of Antwerp <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> them <b>up.</b>|$|R
60|$|When a {{tradesman}} {{has thus}} conquered all his passions, and can {{stand before the}} storm of impertinence, he is said <b>to</b> be <b>fitted</b> <b>up</b> for the main article, namely, {{the inside of the}} counter.|$|R
60|$|So {{the father}} ordered a {{beautiful}} ship <b>to</b> be <b>fitted</b> <b>up,</b> {{and the young}} man sailed away in it. After some weeks the vessel cast anchor before a large town, and the merchant's son went on shore.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{are more}} than mean!" [...] he cried. [...] "We have worked hard <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> <b>up</b> this spot, as you can see. But your meanness is nothing but what I should expect from one who would act as you did about that Spur Road tract of lumber." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There is room on {{the rear}} platform, for all the farm {{machinery}} I now have on hand. All right, Mr. Merrick; I'll move the truck out and give you possession. It won't make a bad newspaper office. But {{of course you are}} <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> <b>up</b> the place at your own expense." ...|$|E
60|$|To further aid American exhibitors at the Vienna Exposition, I would recommend, in {{addition}} to an appropriation of money, that the Secretary of the Navy be authorized <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> <b>up</b> two naval vessels to transport between our Atlantic cities and Trieste, or the most convenient port to Vienna, and back, their articles for exhibition.|$|E
5000|$|Orbital welding is {{typically}} only performed on TUBING and not pipe {{for several reasons}} most important being that the production of tubing yields very consistent outside diameters which is critical <b>to</b> proper <b>fit</b> <b>up</b> in the weld head.|$|R
5000|$|... "The seminary {{itself is}} {{situated}} in the most elevated and healthy part of the city, and no expense has been spared <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> it <b>up</b> {{in the best possible}} manner, for the reception of day pupils and boarders".|$|R
6000|$|... "That reminds me, Gabriel, I'm afraid I spoke rather cavalierly to Kitty, last night, {{about the}} {{arrangements}} of the room. The fact is, I've taken a fancy to it, and should like <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> it <b>up</b> myself. Have I your permission?" ...|$|R
60|$|As {{to paper}} hangings, {{we are proud}} to say that our American {{manufacturers}} now furnish all that can be desired. There are some branches of design where artistic, ingenious France must still excel us; but whoso has a house <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> <b>up,</b> let him first look at what his own country has to show, {{and he will be}} astonished.|$|E
60|$|Grinder {{brought the}} writing {{materials}} and retired. His employer wrote several letters; among them {{one to the}} doctor, apprising him of his intention to go to Jamaica, and another to {{the captain of the}} Ocean Queen, giving him the same information, and directing him <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> <b>up</b> the two best berths in the cabin for the reception of himself and his daughter, with a berth for an old female servant.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Francis Watt commenced, {{with five}} joiners, <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> <b>up</b> a {{temporary}} platform upon the beacon, about twenty-five {{feet above the}} highest part of the rock. This platform was {{to be used as}} the site of the smith's forge, after the beacon should be fitted up as a barrack; and here also the mortar was to be mixed and prepared for the building, and it was accordingly termed the Mortar Gallery.|$|E
6000|$|... "George," [...] {{continues}} Mr. Bucket, [...] "wait a bit!" [...] With his upholsterer manner, as if {{the trooper}} were a window <b>to</b> be <b>fitted</b> <b>up,</b> he takes from his pocket a pair of handcuffs. [...] "This is a serious charge, George, and such is my duty." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "It is {{stated in}} this morning's Tribune that the Sons of Malta, of Jersey City, have {{concluded}} a {{purchase of the}} English ship Great Eastern, which is <b>to</b> be <b>fitted</b> <b>up</b> as soon as possible, to make regular trips between the island of St. Helena and Parts Unknown." ...|$|R
50|$|The new court {{house was}} {{finished}} in April 1876. The Brisbane Courier's Gympie correspondent reported that {{to celebrate a}} grand calico ball would be held there on 19 April. The building {{was described as a}} substantial, commodious brick edifice which appeared <b>to</b> be <b>fitted</b> <b>up</b> with every convenience suitable to the purpose for which it was designed.|$|R
60|$|By fitting up, I do {{not mean}} {{furnishing}} their shops with wares and goods to sell--for in that they came up to us in every particular, and perhaps went beyond us too--but in painting and gilding, fine shelves, shutters, boxes, glass-doors, sashes, and the like, in which, they tell us now, {{it is a small}} matter to lay out two or three hundred pounds, nay, five hundred pounds, <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> <b>up</b> a pastry-cook's, or a toy-shop.|$|E
60|$|Then, as {{everybody}} knows, about April, Captain Joshua Barney was ordered <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> <b>up</b> {{a fleet of}} small boats to protect the towns of the bay, for by this time we were having mighty good proof that the United States was at war with England, and {{it stands to reason}} that we lads were eager to know all that was possible concerning this officer, who had been the most successful of the privateers sailing out of Baltimore.|$|E
60|$|The Fulkersons {{spent the}} summer at a seaside hotel in easy reach of the city; but they {{returned}} early to Mrs. Leighton's, with whom they are to board till spring, when they are going <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> <b>up</b> Fulkerson's bachelor apartment for housekeeping. Mrs. March, with her Boston scruple, thinks it will be odd, living over the 'Every Other Week' offices; {{but there will be}} a separate street entrance to the apartment; and besides, in New York you may do anything.|$|E
6000|$|Temporary {{barriers}} form a wide passage up the midst, {{leading to}} the [...] Salon-Carre, which is seen through the opening <b>to</b> be <b>fitted</b> <b>up</b> as [...] a chapel, with a gorgeous altar, tall candles, and cross. In front [...] of the altar is a platform with a canopy over it. On the platform [...] are two gilt chairs and a prie-dieu.|$|R
2500|$|... "We {{walked into}} the {{partially}} walled compound or court representing the slave-market a bona fide affair, not like the caravanserai which used <b>to</b> be <b>fitted</b> <b>up</b> and furnished by the Cairene Dragoman for the inspection of curious tourists. A wooden cage, about twenty feet square, often contained some {{one hundred and fifty}} men, women, and children, who every day were 'knocked down' to the highest bidder in the public place." ...|$|R
50|$|In November, 1871, a tax of $5,000 was voted, <b>to</b> {{purchase}} and <b>fit</b> <b>up</b> a poor-farm. On February 12, 1872, a {{tract of land}} comprising 175 acre was purchased of David Funkhouser, for $26 per acre, and J.W. Driscoll was appointed keeper of the poor-farm.|$|R
6000|$|... "Couldn't {{offer you}} such swell {{quarters}} in New York, March," [...] Fulkerson said, {{as he went}} tack-tacking down the steps with his small boot-heels. [...] "But I've got my eye on a little house round in West Eleventh Street that I'm going <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> <b>up</b> for my bachelor's hall in the third story, and adapt for 'The Lone Hand' {{in the first and}} second, if this thing goes through; and I guess we'll be pretty comfortable. It's right on the Sand Strip--no malaria of any kind." ...|$|E
6000|$|Margaret next drew {{attention}} to St. Andrew with his cross--Meta's gift. [...] "And, besides," [...] she said, [...] "George Rivers made us a beautiful present, which Meta hunted up. Old Mr. Rivers, knowing no better, once bought all the beautiful carved fittings of a chapel in France, meaning <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> <b>up</b> a library with them; but, happily, he never did, and a happy notion came into Meta's head, so she found them out, and Dr. Spencer has adapted them, and set them all to rights; and they are most exquisite. You never saw such foliage." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{offering}} was so pointed that I {{could do}} no less than to raise it to my nose, and as he sat down noiselessly he breathed out the opinion that a few flowers improved notably {{the appearance of a}} ship's saloon. He wondered why I did not have a shelf fitted all round the skylight for flowers in pots to take with me to sea. He had a skilled workman able <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> <b>up</b> shelves in a day, and he could procure me two or three dozen good plants-- ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>To</b> <b>fit</b> this <b>up</b> {{after the}} fashion of the old place was a {{comparatively}} short and easy work for two such handy labourers. Before they left that night it was so like its predecessor in all respects, except dirt, that both declared {{it to be the}} [...] "identical same craft, in shape and rig, even to the little bed and curtains." [...] Next afternoon Mrs Roby was brought to it by Captain Wopper, in a specially easy carriage hired for the purpose.|$|R
2500|$|Two Caterpillar D343 [...] {{diesel engines}} were <b>fitted</b> <b>to</b> boats <b>up</b> 52-14, {{subsequent}} boats being fitted with two Caterpillar 3408TA [...] Fuel tanks have 620 gallon capacity which gives an operating range of [...]|$|R
5000|$|With the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War, Heißmeyer now saw <b>fit</b> <b>to</b> set <b>up</b> the [...] "Dienststelle SS-Obergruppenführer Heissmeyer" [...] - his own bureau - and was thereby responsible for NPEA students' military training.|$|R
60|$|The {{next day}} we were all hard at work. Corny and her mother {{went down to the}} queen's house, and planned what they could get <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> <b>up</b> the place so {{that it would be a}} little more comfortable. Mrs. Chipperton must have added {{something}} to our eight dollars, for she and Corny came up into the town, and bought a lot of things, which made Poqua-dilla's best room look like another place. The rocking-chair was fixed up quite royally. Mrs. Chipperton turned out to be a better kind of a woman than I thought she was at first.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{was married}} in London by a pastor {{who was a}} stranger; and we settled in London with fair prospects. I had a little fortune of my own--my share of some money left to us girls by our aunt Hester, whom I was named after. It was three hundred pounds. Nearly one hundred of this I spent in buying {{furniture}} <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> <b>up</b> the little house we took to live in. The rest I gave to my husband to put into the bank against {{the time when he}} wanted it to set up in business for himself.|$|E
60|$|We propose <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> <b>up</b> comfortable, {{and even}} luxurious, {{accommodations}} in the comet {{for as many}} persons as will honor us with their patronage, and make an extended excursion among the heavenly bodies. We shall prepare 1,000,000 state-rooms in {{the tail of the}} comet (with hot and cold water, gas, looking-glass, parachute, umbrella, etc., in each), and shall construct more if we meet with a sufficiently generous encouragement. We shall have billiard-rooms, card-rooms, music-rooms, bowling-alleys and many spacious theaters and free libraries; and on the main deck we propose to have a driving park, with upward of 100,000 miles of roadway in it. We shall publish daily newspapers also.|$|E
5000|$|Two Caterpillar D343 [...] {{diesel engines}} were <b>fitted</b> <b>to</b> boats <b>up</b> 52-14, {{subsequent}} boats being fitted with two Caterpillar 3408TA [...] Fuel tanks have 620 gallon capacity which gives an operating range of 250 nmi km.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nothing, {{excepting}} that Private Tubbs {{has seen}} <b>fit</b> <b>to</b> black <b>up</b> as a negro and call upon me," [...] answered {{the master of}} the academy, with a faint smile playing around the corners of his mouth.|$|R
60|$|It was {{two weeks}} later before he paid {{his first visit to}} Mr. Merton; for the pretty little house which the latter had taken a mile out of the town had been {{in the hands of the}} workmen and furnishers, Mr. Merton having drawn on his little capital <b>to</b> {{decorate}} and <b>fit</b> <b>up</b> the house, so as to be a pretty home for his daughter.|$|R
