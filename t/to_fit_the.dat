5|$|Day of the Tentacle {{was one of}} {{the first}} games {{concurrently}} released on CD-ROM and floppy disk. A floppy disk version was created to accommodate consumers that had yet to purchase CD-ROM drives. The CD-ROM format afforded the addition of audible dialog. The capacity difference between the two formats necessitated alterations to the floppy disk version. Grossman spent several weeks reducing files sizes and removing files such as the audio dialog <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> <b>the</b> game onto six diskettes.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the launch}} ceremony, the {{builders}} {{had planned to}} have Great Britain towed to the Thames for her final fitting out. Unfortunately, the harbour authorities had failed {{to carry out the}} necessary modifications to their facilities in a timely manner. Exacerbating the problem, the ship had been widened beyond the original plans to accommodate the propeller engines, and her designers had made a belated decision <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> <b>the</b> engines prior to launch, which resulted in a deeper draught.|$|E
5|$|Furthermore, {{the title}} Cakravarti {{seem to have}} been {{commonly}} used in the Pandyan kingdom as a caste or job title. Compound titles exist, such as Maravacakravarti that belonged to a Maravar chief as well as Malavacakravarti that belonged to a Malava chief. Ariyar in Tamil could denote a noble or a learned person, a Brahmin or alternatively a person from Aryavarta. Thus the title Arayacakravarti seems <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> <b>the</b> structure of similarly used titles across the Pandyan kingdom.|$|E

During its premiere in Japan, Conqueror of Shamballa remained {{as one of the}} most popular films in the year.

5|$|The {{constitutional}} amendment gave autonomy {{to the city}} of Buenos Aires, allowing it to sanction local laws and elect its own mayor, who was previously appointed {{by the president of the}} nation.

5|$|Absent Miyamoto's direction, the {{development}} team used elements new and {{inconsistent with the}} series as Super Mario Land shrunk elements of the series <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> <b>the</b> portable device's small screen.

They had previously developed Metroid (1986) and Kid Icarus (1986) together, and the two subsequently designed the Game Boy—Yokoi on its industrial design, and Okada on its engineering. Their Super Mario Land was planned as the portable console's showcase title until Henk Rogers brought Tetris to Nintendo of America and convinced Minoru Arakawa that the addictive computer game would help Nintendo reach the largest audience. The company subsequently chose to bundle Tetris with every Game Boy purchase.|$|E

To make Chinese Nü Yr, Malliagh first designed the cover art and then developed songs with structures and sound <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> <b>the</b> artwork. Upon release, the EP garnered generally favorable reviews from critics, a common praise being its unique style.|$|E
5|$|Destiny 2 {{was later}} ported to the PSP. Development began in 2005, after the {{commercial}} success of Eternias PSP port. The port {{was developed by}} Alfa System, a frequent collaborator with the Tales team on spin-off titles. The project was directed by Yoshito Higuchi, who had worked on Destiny 2 and became {{the director of the}} GameCube port of Tales of Symphonia. While the earlier port of Destiny made significant changes, the Destiny 2 port was meant to preserve and add onto the content of the original. Some of the adjustments included minor tweaks to gameplay, adjustments <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> <b>the</b> PSP's control layout, and adjusting the graphics from 4:3 to 16:9 screen ratio. A new dungeon featuring added story elements was also created. It was released on February 15, 2007.|$|E
5|$|Fabula Nova Crystallis Final Fantasy is {{a series}} of games within the Final Fantasy video game franchise. It was {{primarily}} developed by series creator and developer Square Enix, which also acted as publisher for all titles. While featuring various worlds and different characters, each Fabula Nova Crystallis game is ultimately based on and expands upon a common mythos focusing on important crystals tied to deities. The level of connection to the mythos varies between each title. The series title translates from Latin as 'The New Tale of the Crystal'. Each development team was given the freedom to adapt the mythos <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> <b>the</b> context of a game's story.|$|E
