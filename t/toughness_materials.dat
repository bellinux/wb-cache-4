40|$|In {{the last}} decade, ultra-high {{temperature}} ceramics raised renewed interest {{after the first}} studies in the 602 ̆ 7 s. Thanks to their high melting point, superior to any group of materials, and to their set of interesting physical and engineering properties, they find application in aerospace industry, propulsion field, as cladding materials in generation IV nuclear reactors and solar absorbers in novel HT CSP systems. Recent efforts were devoted to the achievement of high strength and <b>toughness</b> <b>materials,</b> or to the optimization of high temperature stability under oxidative environment. Critical issues rose during the study of each property and are still under continuous investigation. However, to fully exploit the potential of UHTCs in the widest possible range of applications, effective processes for joining these materials to themselves, other ceramics, or metals must be developed. Conventional solid-state diffusion bonding and brazing approaches have complementary strengths and weaknesses, the major drawbacks being high processing temperatures and pressures, long processing times {{and the need for}} meticulous surface preparation. Considerations of these issues and the desire to exploit the high-temperature capabilities of UHTCs encouraged exploration of transient-liquid-phase (TLP) bonding methods. In this work, for the first time, joining tests are conducted on pure and doped carbides and borides using transient-liquid-phase (TLP) joining. Bonding is performed under controlled atmosphere using refractory-metal based multilayer metallic interlayers. These interlayers are designed to develop transient-liquid &# 64257;lms that enable rapid, reliable, and low-temperature bonding {{of a wide range of}} ceramics.

40|$|Crack {{arrest of}} fast running cracks is an {{important}} issue for the safety of steel structures. Crack arrest design can prevent fatal damage of large structures by restricting the influence of the incidents. Therefore crack arrest design is important especially for very large structure, where accidents may cause huge economical and social losses. Propagating shear fracture, long running ductile crack propagation in pipelines and brittle crack propagation in heavy thick shipbuilding steels have been investigated. For the propagating shear fracture issue, a new HLP simulation model, applicable to various backfill conditions, including underwater backfill, was developed. The proposed backfill model {{can be applied to the}} prediction of the crack arrest of propagating shear fracture under various backfill conditions. The new HLP simulation was successful in estimating full-scale burst tests with various backfill depths. The new HLP simulation for underwater pipelines indicated that propagating shear cracks are easily arrested in offshore pipelines compared to onshore pipeline. The toughness requirement of the line pipe for preventing propagating shear fracture can be significantly smaller in underwater pipelines compared to onshore pipelines. The margin of the underwater pipeline for propagating shear fracture was clarified by the new model developed in this thesis. For brittle crack arrest, an empirical approach for long crack propagation has been conducted. Several large-scale crack arrest tests were carried out in order to investigate the long crack arrestability of heavy-thick shipbuilding steel plates. All plates and their welded joints used in this study satisfied the Charpy toughness requirement for EH-grade shipbuilding steels and welded joints. A brittle crack ran along a welded joint and penetrated through the test plate under a stress exceeding 200 MPa, despite the presence of longitudinal stiffeners across the test weld. A brittle crack in a base plate model test with longitudinal stiffeners propagated through the specimen under the maximum design stress. These results suggest that EH-grade cannot ensure arrestability even in the base plate, in case of heavy thick shipbuilding steel. Two crack arrest tests were conducted in order to demonstrate the possibility of long crack arrest using high arrestability steels. The test results indicated that the crack arrest concept could be achieved by a combination of high arrest <b>toughness</b> <b>materials</b> and a special fabrication method which can derive a brittle crack into the base plate of high arrestability plate. The crack arrest design can be used in practice even for large-scale structures using heavy thick steel plates. The effective K concept, as proposed by Machida, et al. 31), provides the boundary of the “arrest” and “propagate” data in the large-scale tests conducted in this work. The effective K concept was found to be valid even for long crack propagation of such a heavy thick steel plate as investigated in this paper.

40|$|The {{development}} of tough a-SiAlON with elongated grains {{in the last}} five years is summarized. This progress has been guided by the improved understanding of phase relations and nucleation/growth kinetics in SiAlON ceramics. Although most a-SiAlON compositions can be processed to contain some elongated grains, their microstructure, fracture toughness and R-curve behavior vary greatly. Such variability is due to the different phase stability of a-SiAlONs and the varying physical chemistry of the competing phases, including the transient/residual liquid. For this reason, microstructure control of a-SiAlON must pay close attention to the composition, starting powder and heating schedule. Seeding with single crystals of an appropriate a-SiAlON composition provides an attractive alternative that simplifies the task of microstructure control, since such seeds are thermodynamically stable and they completely dominate the nucleation statistics. Tough and hard a-SiAlON ceramics containing Ca, Y, Nd, and Yb stabilizers have been obtained using this method, some with toughness exceeding 10 MPam 1 / 2.

Two different types of specimens C(T) and M(T) specimens made from stainless steel {{have been used for}} fracture toughness testing at the room temperature by the principles of the ASTM 1820 - 05 standard procedure. Stable crack initiation and crack propagation occurred for the C(T) specimens at lower values of crack driving force than for the M(T) specimens.

Comparison between the CTOD-R curves of both types of specimens shows some difference between the C(T) and the M(T) specimens, but a more significant difference appeared in the crack driving force, as consequence of different constraint (triaxiality) of the C(T) versus the M(T) specimens.
