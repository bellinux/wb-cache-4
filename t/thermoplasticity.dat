40|$|Whereas {{the change}} of {{material}} properties due {{to change in the}} temperature can easily be realized, the coupling of the different energy sources is less obvious at a first glance.

Here focused is on thematerialmodel required for describing cyclic loading, which combines isotropic and kinematic hardening. During cyclic loading and in particular when large plastic strains develop, i. e., dissipation, a large temperature increase can usually be detected, in some cases around hundred of degrees.

40|$|Peptides {{have the}} {{potential}} to serve as an alternative for petroleum-based polymers to support a sustainable society. However, they lack <b>thermoplasticity,</b> owing to their strong intermolecular interactions. In contrast, nylon is famous for its <b>thermoplasticity</b> and chemical resistance. Here, we synthesized peptides containing a nylon unit to modify their thermal properties by using papain-catalyzed chemoenzymatic polymerization. We used l-glutamic acid alkyl ester as the amino acid monomer and nylon 1, 3, 4, and 6 alkyl esters as the nylon unit. Papain catalyzed the copolymerization of glutamic acid with nylon 3, 4, and 6 alkyl esters, whereas the nylon 1 unit could not be copolymerized. Other proteases used in this study, namely, bromelain, proteinase K, and Candida antarctica lipase (CALB), were not able to copolymerize with any nylon units. The broad substrate specificity of papain enabled the copolymerization of l-glutamic acid with a nylon unit. The peptides with nylon units demonstrated different thermal profiles from that of oligo(l-glutamic acid). Therefore, the resultant peptides with various nylon units are expected to form fewer intermolecular hydrogen bonds, thus altering their thermal properties.

40|$|Eight Australian {{coking coal}} samples (R vMax from 0. 8 to 1. 6) from six {{different}} basins {{were employed to}} investigate the effect of coal maceral compositions and rank on thermo-swelling behavior. Coal pyrolysis experiments were conducted at a heating rate of 5 °C/min from room temperature (25 °C) to 1000 °C with a top coal particle size of 212 μm. <b>Thermoplasticity</b> of coal was evaluated {{on the basis of}} the change of permeability of coal pellets, plastic range, swelling factor (defined by maximum swelling %/vitrinite %), and heat of exothermic reactions during the primary devolatilization. The endothermic and exothermic processes were identified by the estimate of the apparent specific heat using the computer-aided thermal analysis (CATA) technique, while swelling and permeability of gas flowing through coal pellets were simultaneously investigated with extended volumetric measurement downstream and pressure sensor upstream, respectively. Volatile evolution profiles of heating coal samples with temperature were obtained using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Overall, the low-rank coals with high vitrinite contents showed larger exothermic heats, higher volatile evolution rates, and higher swelling factors than the high-rank coals with low vitrinite contents. These lower rank coals also initiated a decrease in permeability at lower temperatures, showed large plastic ranges, and resulted in a larger pore size of semi-coke. When we account for total fusible maceral (vitrinite plus fusible semi-inert) rather than vitrinite content alone, the trend of the swelling factor decreasing with the coal rank became clearer. However, it was found that coals from basin III showed a significantly lower swelling factor than the comparative rank coals and the heat of exothermic reactions showed a similar trend, despite these coals having a similar volatile evolution rate with the comparative rank coals. The reasons for this have been discussed {{on the basis of the}} <b>thermoplasticity,</b> which suggests that not only the rank and maceral compositions but also the origin and chemistry of the coal may affect <b>thermoplasticity</b> of coking coal...|$|E

40|$|The {{energy balance}} {{equation}} for elastoplastic solids includes heat source terms {{that govern the}} conversion {{of some of the}} plastic work into heat. The remainder contributes to the stored energy of cold work due to the creation of crystal defects. This paper is concerned with the fraction β of the rate of plastic work converted into heating. We examine the status of the common assumption that β is a constant with regard to the thermodynamic foundations of <b>thermoplasticity</b> and experiments. A general internal-variable theory is introduced and restricted to abide by the second law of thermodynamics. Experimentally motivated assumptions reduce this theory to a special model of classical <b>thermoplasticity.</b> The only part of the internal energy not determined from the isothermal response is the stored energy of cold work, a function only of the internal variables. We show that this function can be inferred from stress and temperature data from a single adiabatic straining experiment. Experimental data from dynamic Kolsky-bar tests at various strain rates yield a unique stored energy function. Its knowledge is crucial for the determination of the thermomechanical response in non-isothermal processes. Such a prediction agrees well with results from dynamic tests at different rates. In these experiments, β is found to depend strongly on both strain and strain rate for various engineering materials. The model is successful in predicting this dependence. Requiring β to be constant is thus an approximation of dubious validity...|$|E

In the steel industry, biomass is also seen as a potential additive to coal blends in the production of coke used to feed blast furnaces. Within this framework, the present study aims to shed light on the effect of several woody biomasses on the thermoplastic properties of coking coals, due to the relevance of <b>thermoplasticity</b> {{to the development of the}} structure of coke and, consequently, to its physical and chemical behaviour in a blast furnace. As the ratio of the three main components in a biomass (cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin) differs with the source of the biomass in quantity and thermal behaviour, model biopolymers were also studied. An attempt was then made to explain the different degrees of reduction of <b>thermoplasticity</b> in a medium-fluid coal as being due to the type of wood species and to relate it to the thermal behaviour of the model lignocellulosic polymers. Multiple linear regression analysis was applied to a set of woody biomasses with different thermogravimetric patterns and composition in order to assess the contribution of the quantity and source of the volatiles evolved during pyrolysis to the fluidity of blends of coal and biomass.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that a {{metallic}} specimen changes its temperature when it is subjected to cyclic stresses. If the strain is elastic, the temperature change is produced by two main effects: elastoplasticity and thermoelasticity. The ﬁrst phenomenon is due to microplasticity and energy dissipation inside a material that causes the conversion of mechanical energy into heat. Thermoelasticity can be explained through the ﬁrst thermodynamic law, according to which volume increase is associated to temperature decrease in adiabatic conditions, and vice versa. Thermoelasticity and elastoplasticity produce very different temperature patterns. The ﬁrst one induces a periodic temperature change, synchronous with loading history and proportional to the actual load amplitude. 1 The <b>thermoplasticity</b> produces a continuous temperature increment, related to both load amplitude and the number off performed cycles until thermal equilibrium is reached...|$|E
