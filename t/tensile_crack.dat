5000|$|A {{fracture}} is {{the separation}} of an object or material into two or more pieces under the action of stress. The fracture of a solid usually occurs due {{to the development of}} certain displacement discontinuity surfaces within the solid. If a displacement develops perpendicular to the surface of displacement, it is called a normal <b>tensile</b> <b>crack</b> or simply a crack; if a displacement develops tangentially to the surface of displacement, it is called a shear crack, slip band, or dislocation. [...] Fracture strength or breaking strength is the stress when a specimen fails or fractures.|$|E
50|$|Most widely {{tensile test}} method {{is used to}} {{characterize}} the mechanical properties of materials. From any complete tensile test record, one can obtain important informations about the material’s elastic properties, the character and extent of plastic deformation, yield and tensile strengths and toughness. These informations which {{can be obtained from}} one test justifies the extensive use of tensile test in engineering materials research. Therefore, investigations of EMR emissions are mainly based on the tensile test of the specimens.From experiments, it can be shown that <b>tensile</b> <b>crack</b> formation excites more intensive EMR than shear cracking, increasing the elasticity, strength and loading rate during uniaxial loading increases amplitude. Poissons ratio is a key parameter for EMR characterization during triaxial compression. If the poissions ratio is lower, it is harder for the material to strain transversally and hence higher is the probability of new fractures. Mechanism of plastic deformation is very important for safe operation of any component under dynamic conditions.|$|E
30|$|For {{modeling}} {{the period between}} 2006 and 2014, the geometry of a shallow crack and spherical source {{was assumed to be}} {{the same as that of}} the 2009 – 2014 models. For the other models (spherical source with <b>tensile</b> <b>crack,</b> and two tensile cracks), the shallow spherical source or shallow <b>tensile</b> <b>crack</b> assumed the same geometry as in the 2009 – 2014 models, and all parameters of the deep <b>tensile</b> <b>crack</b> were estimated.|$|E
30|$|For {{the control}} {{specimen}} without any corrosion, three <b>tensile</b> <b>cracks</b> developed, {{and the number}} of <b>tensile</b> <b>cracks</b> tended to decrease with an increase in the corrosion weight loss percentage of the rebar. The reason for this outcome is that the corrosion of the rebar resulted in reducing the distribution capacity of the cracks, whereas the length of 80  cm is relatively short such that previously developed transverse corrosion cracks mainly affected the formation of <b>tensile</b> <b>cracks.</b>|$|R
30|$|All {{concrete}} specimens exhibit both <b>tensile</b> and shear <b>cracks.</b> The {{proportion of}} shear crack in PFRC {{is larger than}} that in plain concrete.

30|$|Next, {{we assumed}} a <b>tensile</b> <b>crack</b> source (Fig.  2 b). During the 2007 activity, some {{baselines}} connecting {{eastern and western}} GNSS observation points across the volcano were extended. Therefore, assuming a <b>tensile</b> <b>crack</b> with north–south strike we stacked data of baselines oriented nearly east–west (Fig.  3 d). Baselines crossing the volcano in a direction normal to the opening direction of the crack {{would be expected to}} show contractional changes, but such baseline data were not available for either the 2007 or 2014 events, so we did not use any north–south baselines. Note that if any contractional data had been used for stacking, it would have been necessary to reverse their polarity. We call the data produced by stacking the data of the east–west baselines across the <b>tensile</b> <b>crack</b> Dike stacked data.|$|E
30|$|While {{a number}} of models have been {{proposed}} to explain the deformation observed in GNSS data from 2006 to 2007, a unified model has not been developed. Based on previous studies and leveling results, we hypothesized that the magma intruded the shallow system from 2006 to 2009 but that the 2014 eruption and aftermath were characterized by deflation. In this study, we considered four models (spherical source, <b>tensile</b> <b>crack,</b> spherical source with <b>tensile</b> <b>crack,</b> and two tensile cracks) as candidates for the source model.|$|E
30|$|Unlike the VLP source {{described}} in Jolly et al. (2017), the moment tensor obtained here cannot {{be explained by}} a single tensile-shear crack: the inversion for {{the orientation of the}} crack, the direction of the crack opening and the Poisson’s ratio (see Vavryčuk 2001) results in the non-physical values of the Poisson’s ratio for any mode of a <b>tensile</b> <b>crack</b> opening (from a pure shear to a pure <b>tensile</b> <b>crack).</b> Instead, the solution can be explained by a non-planar source with the main tension axis in the NNE direction.|$|E

30|$|Above the {{magma chamber}} is a {{hydrothermal}} system characterized by low Vp and low Vp/Vs (≤[*] 10  km in depth). The hydrothermal system extends to {{near the surface}} where steaming activity takes place (e.g., at Owakudani). Above the hydrothermal system is a fractured region where volcano tectonic earthquakes take place (≤[*] 6  km in depth). This is the region where earthquake swarms during volcanic unrest occurred and could be partly overlapped with the hydrothermal system. This region could form a mesh structure (Sibson 1996), which is a network composed of <b>tensile</b> <b>cracks</b> and faults around the <b>cracks.</b> The <b>tensile</b> <b>cracks</b> and faults beneath the volcano were observed in previous studies (Yukutake et al. 2010; Daita et al. 2009; Honda et al. 2014).|$|R

30|$|A <b>tensile</b> <b>crack</b> {{model has}} already been {{estimated}} as a magma source at Mount Asama volcano, Japan (Murakami 2005). A <b>tensile</b> <b>crack</b> with a depth of about 2  km below the surface was estimated by continuous GNSS measurements around Mount Asama volcano from 1996 to 2004. Murakami (2005) proposed that buoyant bubble-rich magma surges episodically into the crack-shaped magma reservoir, then it loses the buoyancy through degassing process, and it finally drains back to the further depth. Such activity has a strong resemblance to that occurring at Mount Ontake volcano.|$|E

40|$|Various crack types {{have been}} {{reported}} to initiate from a pre-existing flaw in rocks under compression. In addition to the most commonly observed <b>tensile</b> wing <b>cracks,</b> anti-wing cracks propagating in an opposite direction to that of the <b>tensile</b> wing <b>cracks</b> are also observed in the field and in the laboratory testing. Although {{a substantial portion of the}} anti-wing crack path was observed to be associated with <b>tensile</b> <b>cracking,</b> signs of shearing such as the production of shearing dust were identified adjacent to the flaw tip in experimental studies. The objective of this paper is to numerically study the cracking processes involved in the anti-wing crack formation and compare it with those in the <b>tensile</b> wing <b>crack</b> formation. The numerical analysis was performed by a dynamic analysis software by incorporating the static damping technique to achieve a quasi-static loading condition. The numerical study revealed that for the anti-wing crack, the initiated crack segment adjacent to the flaw tip is "shear" in nature, while the remaining segment is "tensile" in nature. © 2012 Taylor & Francis Group, London.

40|$|Experimental {{uniaxial}} compression loading {{tests were conducted}} on molded gypsum and Carrara marble prismatic specimens to study the cracking and coalescence processes between pre-existing artificial flaws. The study showed that material had an influence on the cracking and coalescence processes (see the companion paper in this issue). As reported in the companion paper, one of the pronounced features as observed in the high-speed video recordings was the development of macroscopic white patches prior {{to the development of}} observable cracks in marble, but not in gypsum. This paper (part 2) deals with the microscopic aspects of the study. Specifically, the scanning electron microscope (SEM) and the environmental scanning electron microscope (ESEM) imaging techniques were used to study the microscopic development of white patches and their evolution into macroscopic <b>tensile</b> <b>cracks</b> and shear cracks in marble, and the microscopic initiation of hair-line <b>tensile</b> <b>cracks</b> and their evolution into macroscopic <b>tensile</b> <b>cracks</b> in gypsum. The microscopic imaging study in marble showed that the white patches were associated with extensive microcracking zones (process zones), while the extent of process zone development in gypsum was limited.

30|$|Preparatory {{activity}} {{preceding the}} 2014 eruption of Mount Ontake volcano was estimated from vertical deformation detected using a precise leveling survey. Notable uplift (2006 – 2009) and subsidence (2009 – 2014) were detected {{on the eastern}} flank of the volcano. We estimated pressure source models based on the vertical deformation and used these to infer preparatory process preceding the 2014 eruption. Our {{results suggest that the}} subsidence experienced between 2009 and 2014 (including the period of the 2014 eruption) occurred {{as a result of a}} sill-like <b>tensile</b> <b>crack</b> with a depth of 2.5  km. This <b>tensile</b> <b>crack</b> might inflate prior to the eruption and deflate during the 2014 activity. A two-tensile-crack model was used to explain uplift from 2006 to 2009. The geometry of the shallow crack was assumed to be the same as the sill-like <b>tensile</b> <b>crack.</b> The deep crack was estimated to be 2  km in length, 4.5  km in width, and 3  km in depth. Distinct uplifts began on the volcano flanks in 2006 and were followed by seismic activities and a small phreatic eruption in 2007. From the partially surveyed leveling data in August 2013, uplift might continue until August 2013 without seismic activity in the summit area. Based on the uplift from 2006 to 2013, magma ascended rapidly beneath the summit area in December 2006, and deep and shallow tensile cracks were expanded between 2006 and 2013. The presence of expanded cracks between 2007 and 2013 has not been inferred by previous studies. A phreatic eruption occurred on 27 September 2014, and, following this activity, the shallow crack may have deflated.|$|E
30|$|The phreatic {{eruption}} occurred on 27 September 2014, and the shallow <b>tensile</b> <b>crack</b> may have deflated at this activity (Fig.  11 c).

From the leveling result, clear deformation caused by volume change of the deep crack was not detected. The deep crack may not change during this time.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThere {{has been}} {{considerable}} interest {{in recent years}} in theoretical formulae providing, for various crack configurations, the local variation of the stress intensity factors resulting from some small but otherwise arbitrary coplanar perturbation of the crack front. In this work, we establish the expression of the variation of the mode I stress intensity factor up to second order in the perturbation, in the specific case of a semi-infinite <b>tensile</b> <b>crack</b> embedded in some infinite body. The treatment is basically simple and uses earlier results of Rice (1989). Formulae are given in both the physical space and Fourier's space. They differ from earlier ones established by Adda-Bedia et al. (2006) for the same problem, using a more complex method of solution. Finite element computations performed for sinusoidal perturbations support the new formulae, rather than the older ones. As an application, it is finally shown that the mean value of the energy-release-rate along the front of a perturbed semi-infinite <b>tensile</b> <b>crack</b> is exactly the same, up to second order in the perturbation, as if the front were straight...|$|E
30|$|The PEF {{resistance}} {{of a building}} is dependent on various factors, including the deformed geometry and the degradation in stiffness resulting from earthquake (Zaharia and Pintea 2009). In reinforced concrete structures, {{in addition to the}} aforementioned factors, the effects of the level of damage, including <b>tensile</b> <b>cracking,</b> removal of rebars cover and compressive crushing have to be considered as well. Assuming ductile behavior of RC elements which is often intended in design, a typical moment–curvature relation can be idealized to separate stages of pre-cracking of concrete, post cracking, yielding of steel reinforcement and concrete crushing in compression (Kwak and Kim 2002). While it seems that <b>tensile</b> <b>cracking,</b> as the first stage of cracking, has no significant effect on the PEF resistance, major cracking resulting in removal of rebars cover or crushing of concrete in compression drastically reduces the PEF resistance (Ervine et al. 2011).|$|R
30|$|In the ‘A’ (all) {{corrosion}} case, {{the initial}} stiffness for specimens A- 5 and A- 6 with transverse <b>cracks</b> decreased until <b>tensile</b> <b>cracks</b> formed, {{and the initial}} peak indicates when the cracking point of the concrete was no longer observed. Moreover, the remaining stress of the concrete at the strain of 0.002 decreased as the corrosion level increased, but the difference is insignificant. In short, when the corrosion level was high, the number of cracks due to stress increased, {{and the amount of}} slip that occurred around the transverse cracks increased. Therefore, less displacement in the tensile stress was observed at the time new cracks appeared. However, slip between the rebar and concrete that was caused by longitudinal <b>cracks</b> followed by <b>tensile</b> <b>cracks</b> led to higher average strain values under the same level of stress with an increase in the corrosion level of the rebar.|$|R
40|$|We used optical {{experiments}} and high-speed photography {{to interpret the}} origins of tensile fractures that form during dynamic shear rupture in laboratory experiments.
