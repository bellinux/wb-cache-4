40|$|One of {{the major}} design issues in {{heterogeneous}} wireless networks is the support of vertical handover. Vertical handover occurs when a mobile <b>terminal</b> <b>switches</b> from one network to another (e. g., from WLAN to CDMA 1 xRTT). Seamless handover between different access technologies is a great challenge as it needs to obey different performance of QoS and security constraints. Vertical handover decision (VHD) algorithms are essential components of {{the architecture of the}} forthcoming Fourth Generation (4 G) heterogeneous wireless networks. These algorithms need to be designed to provide the required Quality of Service (QoS) {{to a wide range of}} applications while allowing seamless roaming among a multitude of access network technologies. This paper is about the comprehensive survey of the VHD algorithms designed to satisfy these requirements...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — One of {{the major}} design issues in {{heterogeneous}} wireless networks is the support of vertical handoff. Vertical handoff occurs when a mobile <b>terminal</b> <b>switches</b> from one network to another (e. g., from WLAN to CDMA 1 xRTT). The objective {{of this paper is}} to determine the conditions under which vertical handoff should be performed. The problem is formulated as a Markov decision process. A link reward function and a signaling cost function are introduced to capture the tradeoff between the network resources utilized by the connection and the signaling and processing load incurred on the network. A stationary deterministic policy is obtained when the connection termination time is geometrically distributed. Numerical results show good performance of our proposed scheme over two other vertical handoff decision algorithms, namely: SAW (Simple Additive Weighting) and GRA (Grey Relational Analysis).

40|$|Abstract − This paper {{proposes a}} {{networking}} scheme {{to operate in}} wireless networks enhanced with ad hoc networking for emergency communications. The access protocol aims to maintain connections between a base station (BS) and terminals by way of multihopping in natural disaster or emergencies, and to provide accessibility to subscribers. In the event that a link between BS and a terminal operating in cellular mode is disconnected, the <b>terminal</b> <b>switches</b> to ad hoc mode to build a route to BS via multihopping. The proposed route discovery scheme is capable of building the route without route request used by other ad hoc protocols. A Markov model is employed to analyze the performances of the network. The simulation results show that 90 % of terminals in a cell can retrieve access to BS within three hops, where only 20 % of terminals can reach the BS directly. The average throughput of the networks is improved from 20 % to 40 % within three hops.

40|$|In mobile {{telecommunications}} the network needs {{to monitor the}} terminal status, i. e., switched on, switched off, busy, idle. Once a mobile <b>terminal</b> is <b>switched</b> on, it automatically informs the network accordingly (attachment action). Regarding {{the way that the}} network identifies that a <b>terminal</b> is <b>switched</b> off (detachment), a procedure called Periodic Attachment is proposed: The <b>terminal</b> (when <b>switched</b> on) periodically reports to the network its active status. If the network detects silence for more than an agreed time period it considers the <b>terminal</b> <b>switched</b> off. Paging signalling savings can be achieved if the network is informed early that a mobile <b>terminal</b> is <b>switched</b> off. However, periodic attachment requires access to the network database system, which might cause a bottleneck. In this paper the performance characteristics of periodic attachment and the induced signalling load are evaluated as influenced by the selection of the time-out period. A constant time-out period for the whole day can cause a large amount of database transactions especially during low traffic hours. A method for dynamic time-out period selection to fit the varying conditions during the day is proposed and evaluated...|$|R

40|$|In mobile {{telecommunications}} the network should monitor the terminal status, i. e., switched on, switched off, busy. Once a mobile <b>terminal</b> is <b>switched</b> on, it automatically informs the network about its status (attachment action). However, regarding {{the way that}} the network can identify that a <b>terminal</b> is <b>switched</b> off (detachment), there are three alternatives: (a) Periodic detachment scenario. The <b>terminal</b> (when <b>switched</b> on) periodically informs the network about its state. If the network detects that there is no contact with the terminal for more than the agreed time period, it detaches the terminal, (b) Detach on unsuccessful paging. At the instance of a call terminating to a mobile terminal and after a number of unanswered paging messages, the terminal is detached. (c) Detachment action scenario. The moment that the mobile <b>terminal</b> is <b>switched</b> off, it informs the network about its status. Scenarios (a) and (c) claim that paging signaling savings can be achieved when the network is early informed that a mobile <b>terminal</b> is <b>switched</b> off. However, these scenarios require access to the network database, which {{is expected to be a}} bottleneck. On the other hand, scenario (b) requires no access to the database but does not guarantee paging signaling savings.
