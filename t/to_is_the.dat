5|$|Kay County is {{the next}} county US-60 passes through, and the first {{settlement}} US-60 comes <b>to</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> city of Tonkawa. Here, US-60 has an interchange {{with one of the}} two interstate highways it will meet in Oklahoma, Interstate 35 (I-35). East of I-35, US-60 begins a concurrency with US-77; this interchange is also the western terminus of US-60 Business, which serves downtown Tonkawa. US-177 joins the concurrency at the next interchange, which is also {{the other end of the}} Tonkawa business loop. Further east is an interchange with SH-156, the northern terminus of that route. US-60/US-77/US-177 then reach the outskirts of Ponca City, Kay County's largest city. Ponca City, too, has a business loop from US-60, which begins at the next interchange east. The three U.S. routes mostly bypass the city to the south, only actually entering the city limits at its far southern extent. In Ponca City, US-60 Business reunites with mainline US-60 and ends. This intersection is also where the three-way concurrency between the U.S. routes breaks; US-77 heads north along US-60 Business, deeper into Ponca City, US-177 heads south toward Stillwater, and US-60 heads east to cross the Arkansas River.|$|E

5|$|The {{commutativity}} and associativity of real addition <b>are</b> immediate; defining <b>the</b> {{real number}} 0 <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> set of negative rationals, it <b>is</b> easily seen <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> additive identity.

25|$|Problematic point(s): it {{is often}} unclear whether a common name is {{actually}} part of an official geographical name, e.g. many people believe Fertő <b>tó</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> actual name of Fertő Lake so they write it with a hyphen, while the name is only Fertő, thus a space must be used before tó. In addition, names like Szahara sivatag (‘Sahara Desert’) or Urál hegység ‘Ural Mountains’ don’t contain the common name, so no hyphen must be used, {{as opposed to the}} Kaszpi-tenger type.|$|E

The price for annual passes, set at NZ$1199, was not released until {{the day of the}} opening party. Passes for day entry (NZ$75) and single chairlift rides (NZ$19.75) are also available. Entry to the park itself is free, including riding the tracks, and what passes give access <b>to</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> chairlift. Access to the zip-line is available via separate passes.

25|$|One {{consequence}} of these positions that Unger points <b>to</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> {{revision of the}} concept and function of mathematics. If {{there is only one}} world drenched in time through and through, then mathematics cannot be a timeless expression of multiple universes that captures reality. Rather, Unger argues that mathematics is a means of analyzing the world removed of time and phenomenal distinction. By emptying the world of time and space it is able to better focus on one aspect of reality: the recurrence of certain ways in which pieces of the world relate to other pieces. Its subject matter are the structured wholes and bundles of relations, which we see outside mathematics only as embodied in the time-bound particulars of the manifest world. In this way, mathematics extends our problem solving powers as an extension of human insight, {{but it is not a}} part of the world.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to ecological considerations, decisions regarding {{the future of}} the fisheries were also influenced by social and economic factors. Throughout Atlantic Canada, however most pronounced in Newfoundland, the cod fishery was a source of social and cultural identity. For many families, it also represented their livelihood: most families were connected either directly or indirectly with the fishery as fishers, fish plant workers, fish sellers, fish transporters, or as employees in related businesses. Additionally, many companies, both foreign and domestic, as well as individuals, had invested heavily in the boats, equipment and the infrastructure of the fishery, and therefore felt it was in their best interest to maintain an open-access policy to the ocean and its resources. What this alludes <b>to</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> unfortunate paradox that often accompanies open-access resources and is known by most as the Tragedy of the Commons: what is in the individual's best interest is not always {{in the best interest of}} a society at whole. In the case of Newfoundland and the Northern Cod fishery this meant that from the perspective of the individual participating in the fishing industry, maximizing their catch was in their best interest; however when the government failed to intervene – due largely to the highly sensitive nature of the political discourse created by the expansive group of stakeholders – the ecosystem was brought past its threshold and collapsed, leaving everyone worse-off.|$|E
