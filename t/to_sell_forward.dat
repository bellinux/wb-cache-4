40|$|Building on a {{model of}} the {{interaction}} of risk-averse firms that compete in forward and spot markets, we develop an empirical strategy to test whether oligopolistic firms use forward contracts for strategic motives, for risk-hedging, or for both. An {{increase in the number of}} players weakens the incentives <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> <b>forward</b> for risk-hedging reasons. However, if strategic motives are also relevant, then an increase in the number of players strengthens the incentives <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> <b>forward.</b> This difference provides the analyst with a way to identify whether strategic considerations are important at motivating firms <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> <b>forward.</b> Using data from the Dutch wholesale market for natural gas where we observe the number of players, spot and forward sales, and churn rates, we find evidence that strategic reasons play an important role at explaining the observed firms' (inverse) hedge ratios.

Using data from the Dutch wholesale market for natural gas where we observe the number of players, spot and forward sales, churn rates and prices, this paper presents evidence that strategic reasons {{play an important role}} at explaining the observed firms' hedging activity. Our test for strategic behavior is based on the theoretical relationship between the number of sellers and the incentives to sell forward: if risk-hedging is the only motive behind firms' decision <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> <b>forward,</b> then hedging activity ought to {{decrease in the number of}} firms; otherwise, if strategic reasons are relevant, then firms incentives <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> <b>forward</b> should increase in the number of competitors.

The strategic motive <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> <b>forward</b> is seldom observed for a duopoly as once experienced subjects seldom use forward markets.

We find that the initial "collusive hypothesis" is not ratified, and that outcomes are nearly competitive. Sales take place mostly in the first few openings of futures markets.

However, Allaz and Vila (1993) show that duopolists can also have a strategic motive <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> <b>forward,</b> irrespective of exogenous uncertainties. Moreover, in their model the possibility of forward trading increases competitiveness between the two firms, raising consumer surplus and welfare. In this study we analyze the case of an n firm oligopoly in Allaz ’ and Vila’s framework and derive comparative static predictions with regard to the market institution and the number of competitors. We then test the theoretical hypotheses in a laboratory experiment. Our findings support the main comparative-static predictions of the model but also suggest that, when compared to the increase in competitive pressure due to entry, the competition-enhancing effect of a forward market is weaker than predicted...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the strategic use of forward contracts {{in an industry}} where downstream firms must buy an essential input from imperfectly competitive upstream suppliers. When a single large firm and a fringe of firms exist downstream, the large firm buys forward contracts from the fringe, i. e. there is horizontal subcontracting from the large firm to the firms on the fringe, {{in order to make}} the spot market less competitive. Hence our paper argues that horizontal subcontracting becomes an anti-competitive device. We also compare the strategies of buying forward contracts and purchasing productive capacity and we find that both are equivalent tools. When the downstream industry has instead several large firms, they have a "horizontal" incentive <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> <b>forward</b> contracts in order to gain market share, but the former "vertical" incentive to buy them persists. In this case, forward contracting may then lead to less competition in the spot market. Intermediate markets, buyer power, forward contracts, horizontal subcontracting...|$|E
40|$|We {{test the}} {{strategic}} motive <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> <b>forward</b> in experimental Cournot duopoly and quadropoly environments {{with either a}} finite (exogenous close) or an infinite (endogenous close) number of forward markets. In the exogenous close case experienced subjects do not avail themselves of the forward markets and production mostly occurs in the spot market phase. In a forward market duopoly experienced subjects achieve nearly the monopoly output level. For the quadropoly output levels are more competitive and are near the Cournot Nash equilibrium. In both cases output produced is {{much less than the}} Allaz-Vila (1993) prediction. The results with inexperienced subjects, however, are in line with theory and as reported in Le-Coq and Orzen (2006). We implement the case of infinitely many forward periods using the endogenous close rule. In this case the results both for a forward market duopoly and quadropoly are much more competitive both with inexperienced and experienced subjects. Unlike the exogenous stopping rule, under the endogenous rule subjects sell forward in the forward markets and find it hard to coordinate their actions. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reports the}} results of a {{laboratory}} experiment that examines the strategic effect of forward trading on market power in infinitely repeated duopoly games. Two competing theories motivate the experimental design. In their seminal paper, Allaz and Vila (1993) argue that forward trading increases market efficiency as quantity-setting sellers will find themselves in a prisoner's dilemma which limits their ability to exercise market power. Their model predicts that introducing a forward market is analogous to squaring the number of firms. Conversely, Liski and Montero (2006) argue that forward sales can soften competition as sellers can sustain collusive profits that could not be achieved in duopolies without forward sales. By strictly imposing forward-spot price parity and by limiting sales choices to pure strategies, the experiment provides a first simultaneous test of these rival theories. Contrary to previous experimental studies, the results do not support the pro-competitive prediction: introducing a forward market does not increase market efficiency. Further, in accordance with Liski and Montero, the findings provide evidence that allowing firms <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> <b>forward</b> can facilitate collusion...|$|E

40|$|The {{focus of}} this case is a Canadian company with mostly US dollar sales and Canadian dollar costs {{operating}} in a flexible exchange rate environment. It is also undergoing a major expansion of its facilities. The operating and foreign exchange risk induce the firm <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> <b>forward</b> almost US$ 1 billion in order to hedge anticipated US revenues. The company also engages in extensive US dollar debt financing. Subsequently, Great Lakes' revenues are affected by both price effects and very large volume effects that effectively both reverse its exposure and call into question {{whether or not there}} would be sufficient foreign revenues to fulfil the contracted forward sales of foreign currency. The pedagogic value of the case is to lead the student through the critical issues involved in ‘hedge’ accounting. The company actually deferred all gains and losses on its medium-term forward contracts, even though its revenue decline called into question its ability to meet its forward commitments from actual sales. The student is thus brought {{face to face with the}} critical question of ‘when is a hedge a hedge?’, and 'when should hedge accounting be used?' The case also includes enough material on the company and the hedging instruments to enable the student to understand the business situation that generates the accounting problems. The case is appropriate for any instructor who wishes to bring out the issues involved in hedge accounting. For Great Lakes, hedge accounting was the most important accounting principle, so the underlying issues are easy to motivate. However, the issues are broader than the actual case context; they are important for any firm where hedging instruments are available to manage the price exposure in its revenues. For example, the case can also be used to discuss a gas or oil produced who hedges price risk by selling oil and gas futures. The critical accounting issues is the definition and treatment of a hedge. Foreign exchange risk, hedge accounting, financial risk management, exposure management, revenue hedge,...|$|E

We are using a formal economic model to analyse the choices facing a small generator, who must choose whether <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> in the <b>forward</b> markets, or the balancing mechanism run by NGC. We extend our earlier analysis of the balancing mechanism to the decision whether to trade in it or the forward market, and also to the corresponding supplier’s decision. Generators who have been scheduled because they have sold output in the forward market have the opportunity to earn additional profits by buying back their output for a price below their avoidable costs of generation, if demand is low. Similarly, generators who have not been scheduled in the forward market may still be able to earn profits by selling their output in the balancing mechanism, if demand is high. Taking account of these opportunities, we derive the price at which a generator will just be willing to trade in the forward market as a function of its costs and the volume of trade in that market. The higher the generator’s costs, the higher the price it requires. We can calculate the expected price paid by buyers in the balancing mechanism as a functio...|$|R
