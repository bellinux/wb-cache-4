When investigations revealed large gaps in the collection, Malden turned her inquiries to the National Film and Television Archive – which promptly returned three full Second Doctor serials– The Dominators, The Krotons, and The War Games, adding seven more episodes and completing two of those serials. These all were standard 16mm film telerecordings with the exception of The Dominators Episode 3, which was a 35mm print.|$|E
5|$|Under the 1951 City Charter, Philadelphia elects a City Controller {{to sit at}} {{the head}} of an {{independent}} auditing department. The Controller approves all payments made out of the city treasury and audits the executive departments. As an independently elected official, the Controller is not responsible to the mayor or the city council. The office was created as one of the good-government reforms intended to reduce the corruption that had previously plagued city government and led to the Democratic-led reform coalition of 1951. The Controller is required <b>to</b> <b>audit</b> the city finances annually and to have his work verified by a private accounting firm every three years.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{teething}} {{problems with the}} Ju 87, the RLM ordered 216 Ju 87 A-1s into production and wanted to receive delivery of all machines between January 1936 and 1938. The Junkers production capacity was fully occupied and licensing to other production facilities became necessary. The first 35 Ju 87 A-1s were therefore produced by the Weser Flugzeugbau (WFG). By 1 September 1939, 360 Ju 87 As and Bs had been built by the Junkers factories at Dessau and Weserflug factory in Lemwerder near Bremen. By 30 September 1939, Junkers had received 2,365,196 Reichsmark (RM) for Ju 87 construction orders. The RLM paid another 243,646 RM for development orders. According <b>to</b> <b>audit</b> records in Berlin, {{by the end of}} the financial year on 30 September 1941, 3,059,000 RM had been spent on Ju 87 airframes. By 30 June 1940, 697 Ju 87 B-1s and 129 B-2s alone had been produced. Another 105 R-1s and seven R-2s had been built.|$|E

5|$|Many {{executives}} at Enron were indicted {{for a variety}} of charges and some were later sentenced to prison. Enron's auditor, Arthur Andersen, was found guilty in a United States District Court of illegally destroying documents relevant to the SEC investigation which voided its license <b>to</b> <b>audit</b> public companies, effectively closing the business. By the time the ruling was overturned at the U.S. Supreme Court, the company had lost the majority of its customers and had ceased operating. Enron employees and shareholders received limited returns in lawsuits, despite losing billions in pensions and stock prices. As a consequence of the scandal, new regulations and legislation were enacted to expand the accuracy of financial reporting for public companies. One piece of legislation, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, increased penalties for destroying, altering, or fabricating records in federal investigations or for attempting to defraud shareholders. The act also increased the accountability of auditing firms to remain unbiased and independent of their clients.|$|E
5|$|The {{avalanche}} of editorial opinion continued the following day, Sunday, September 21, but Eisenhower continued to withhold judgment. The general considered asking retired Supreme Court Justice Owen Roberts {{to evaluate the}} legality of the Fund, but time constraints ruled him out. Eisenhower decided to ask the Los Angeles law firm Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher for a legal opinion, while asking the accounting firm Price Waterhouse <b>to</b> <b>audit</b> the Fund's records. Nixon, meanwhile, was encouraged by a supportive telegram from his mother and discouraged by one from former Minnesota governor Harold Stassen urging him to resign from the ticket. New York Governor Thomas E. Dewey, a Nixon supporter, called to tell the senator that most Eisenhower aides favored his removal, and that if Nixon made the telecast, he should call for people to write to express their opinions. Dewey added that if the response was not strongly pro-Nixon, the senator should leave the ticket.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine whether {{external}} auditor traits influenced the reporting of internal control deficiencies (ICDs) prior <b>to</b> SOX-mandated <b>audits,</b> holding constant the existence of a control weakness. Design/methodology/approach – Data are collected from publicly available sources such as Securities and Exchange Commission filings and Audit Analytics database. Findings – Companies that were audited by industry leading auditors were more likely to disclose ICDs prior <b>to</b> SOX-mandated <b>audits</b> and that companies with longer client-auditor tenure were less likely to disclose ICDs prior <b>to</b> SOX-mandated <b>audits.</b> Originality/value – These findings suggest that while external auditors were not required to participate in internal control evaluation and certifications prior <b>to</b> their <b>audit</b> of internal control for the 2004 fiscal year, they nevertheless influence the likelihood of ICD disclosure prior <b>to</b> their initial <b>audit.</b> External auditing, Internal control, Legislation, United States of America...|$|R
