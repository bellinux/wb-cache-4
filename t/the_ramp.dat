5|$|A {{collaboration}} between the Welland Rivers Trust, the Wild Trout Trust and the Environment Agency {{has resulted in the}} construction of a rock ramp, to allow migrating sea trout to pass up the river beyond the weir on the Maxey Cut, which was acting as a barrier. Some 300 tons of rock, with 50 tons of finer material forming a top layer, were used to create <b>the</b> <b>ramp.</b> The finer material ensures that water mainly flows over <b>the</b> <b>ramp,</b> rather than through it. <b>The</b> <b>ramp</b> also enables young eels or elvers to move up the river, and provides habitat for stone loach and bullheads.|$|E
5|$|An {{inclined}} tramway, <b>the</b> <b>ramp,</b> {{was built}} {{from the front}} of the terrace, on the axis of the gatehouse, down towards the port area of Fremantle. <b>The</b> <b>ramp,</b> constructed between 1852 and 1853, is of limestone rubble from the cut and fill activities required to create the prison site and the terrace. <b>The</b> <b>ramp</b> is an integral part of the original design of the prison complex and is of exceptional heritage significance. It is now cut at its western end by a modern road which severs the historic visual link with Fremantle. On each side of the alignment of <b>the</b> <b>ramp,</b> where it intersects with Henderson Street, are three terrace houses for the accommodation of prison warders. These were erected between 1851 and 1858 and mark the boundary of the Convict Establishment at this point. The limestone used for the early prison and its associated housing was quarried on the site.|$|E
5|$|At Exit 33 (I-95/John F. Kennedy Memorial Highway), both {{highways}} {{had crossed}} over themselves {{so that all}} through traffic was {{on the left side}} of the road with left-hand entrance/exit ramps connecting the crossover sections. This interchange is currently being replaced by a more conventional flyover ramp interchange, as part of the I-95 expansion project under construction since 2007, eliminating the left-turn ramps and I-95's double crossovers. So far, several ramps have been completed, with <b>the</b> <b>ramp</b> from northbound I-95 to eastbound I-695 completed in September 2008, <b>the</b> <b>ramp</b> from westbound I-695 to northbound I-95 completed in October 2008, <b>the</b> <b>ramp</b> from northbound I-95 to westbound I-695 completed in November 2008 (eliminating the left-hand exit), and <b>the</b> <b>ramp</b> from eastbound I-695 to southbound I-95 was completed in May 2009. The ramps from southbound I-95 to both westbound and eastbound I-695 were completed in June 2009 and <b>the</b> <b>ramp</b> from westbound I-695 to southbound I-695 was completed in July 2009 and <b>the</b> <b>ramp</b> from eastbound I-695 to northbound I-95 opened in August 2009. In addition to rebuilding these ramps, the project will also add four ramps to service the high-occupancy toll lanes being added to I-95.|$|E
50|$|In 2013 the Washington State Department of Transportation {{announced}} plans to dismantle <b>the</b> ghost <b>ramps.</b> To commemorate <b>the</b> <b>ramps</b> and protest their demolition, a local art collective created an installation, Gate to Nowhere, on one of <b>the</b> <b>ramps</b> in 2014. <b>The</b> piece consists of a layer of reflective acrylic wrapping a pair of support columns.|$|R
5000|$|At three {{locations}} along <b>the</b> Greenway, <b>ramps</b> to {{and from}} the underground highway occupy some of the surface. The Big Dig's 1991 environmental approval certificate committed the state to cover <b>the</b> <b>ramps.</b> Nonprofit organizations were designated to develop buildings on the three sites, and the Massachusetts Legislature authorized $31 million to help pay the costs of building on top of <b>the</b> <b>ramps.</b> However, all three proposals were abandoned due to high costs between 2009 and 2011. [...] In 2014, the Boston Redevelopment Authority initiated a review of the three parcels. Preliminary studies have proposed landscaping and partial coverage of some of <b>the</b> <b>ramps.</b>|$|R
40|$|In the Cambrian–Ordovician {{sandstones}} of south-west Jordan, {{the spectacular}} scenery {{that has developed}} under arid conditions includes the presence of low-angle (< 10 °) ramp slopes lying beneath vertical cliffs and running down to adjacent wadi beds or playas. <b>The</b> <b>ramps</b> are depositional features built of fine debris with occasional larger clasts and may be mantled by weathered boulders in their upper parts. These ramps are especially well displayed in the Ishrin Sandstone, but {{seem to be the}} landforms rarely, if ever reported from desert environments. <b>The</b> analysis of <b>ramp</b> geomorphology and sedimentology, and of rock slopes above <b>the</b> <b>ramps,</b> strongly suggests that most of the material that makes up <b>the</b> <b>ramps</b> is provided by catastrophic rockfalls. Rockfall debris is subjected to efficient salt weathering and quickly disintegrates into easily transported fine-grained material which, redistributed by surface wash, builds <b>the</b> <b>ramps.</b> <b>The</b> uniqueness of <b>the</b> <b>ramps</b> arises from a combination of lithological and environmental factors, the former accounting for the high frequency of rockfalls in the Ishrin sandstone, the latter being responsible for the efficacy of salt weathering and surface wash...|$|R

40|$|Intra Beam Scattering (IBS) is {{expected}} to be the main performance limitation of the Extra Low Energy Antiproton ring (ELENA), a small synchrotron equipped with electron cooling under construction at CERN to decelerate antiprotons from 5. 3 MeV to 100 keV. Thus, the duration of <b>the</b> <b>ramps</b> must not be too long to avoid excessive blow up due to IBS. On the other hand, the bending magnets are C-shaped and the vacuum chambers are without insulated junctions, which are difficult for fully baked machines; thus, <b>the</b> <b>ramps</b> must not be too short. The evolution of transverse and longitudinal emittances along <b>the</b> <b>ramps</b> have been estimated assuming that IBS is the main phenomenon leading to blow-up. The blow-up due to IBS found along <b>the</b> <b>ramps</b> have been found to be acceptable...|$|R

5|$|The {{original}} {{plans for}} the I-94 overlap in downtown Saint Paul {{did not include the}} right-side ramps that eliminate weaving. <b>The</b> <b>ramp</b> from I-35E northbound to I-94 eastbound was added when I-35E was finally completed in 1990, and a five-year construction project that was completed in 1992 added <b>the</b> <b>ramp</b> from I-35E southbound to I-94 westbound, as well as a direct ramp from I-35E southbound to the Lafayette Freeway (US52) to avoid weaving across I-94 east. This project was done because the old Spaghetti Junction at the east split of I-35E and I-94 {{would not be able to}} handle the extra load from the completed I-35E parkway.|$|E

50|$|The {{architraves}} on top {{of these}} columns are estimated to weigh 70 tons. These architraves may have been lifted to these heights using levers. This would be an extremely time-consuming process and also would require great balance to get to such great heights. A common alternative theory regarding how they were moved is that large ramps were constructed of sand, mud, brick or stone and that the stones were then towed up <b>the</b> <b>ramps.</b> If stone had been used for <b>the</b> <b>ramps,</b> {{they would have been}} able to use much less material. The top of <b>the</b> <b>ramps</b> presumably would have employed either wooden tracks or cobblestones for towing the megaliths.|$|R

5|$|Groundbreaking on the Culver Ramp, also {{referred}} to as the Culver Line Connection, between the Church Avenue and Ditmas Avenue stations began in June 1941, and was expected to be completed {{by the end of the}} year. <b>The</b> <b>ramp</b> was expected to cost $2 million, and along with new signals, and rehabilitation of the Culver elevated and lengthening of its stations to IND standards, the total cost of the project was estimated at over $11 million. 170 subway cars were purchased for $8,500,000 for the extension of IND service. Two substations, a signal tower, a fourth track at Ditmas Avenue, and an additional stairway at Ditmas Avenue were all completed as part of the project. McDonald Avenue was also widened between Avenue C and Cortelyou Road to facilitate <b>the</b> <b>ramp.</b> Though <b>the</b> <b>ramp</b> was nearly complete, including rails and signal work, construction was halted later that year because of America's entrance into World War II. When the project was restarted in 1946, completion was delayed further due to continued material shortages and a lack of rolling stock to facilitate the new service. On October 30, 1954, the connection between the IND Brooklyn Line at Church Avenue and the BMT Culver Line at Ditmas Avenue opened. This allowed IND trains to operate all the way to the Coney Island–Stillwell Avenue terminal.|$|E

5|$|The tour {{featured}} a 360-degree configuration, with the stage being placed {{closer to the}} center of the stadium's field than usual. The stage design {{featured a}} large four-legged steel structure that held the speaker system and cylindrical video screen and hovered above the performance area. The stage was surrounded by a circular ramp, which connected to the stage by rotating bridges. Fans with general admission tickets could be placed both outside <b>the</b> <b>ramp</b> as well as between <b>the</b> <b>ramp</b> and stage. The stage had no defined front or back and was surrounded by the audience. The stage design was able to increase the venues' capacities by about 15–20%. Tiered football stadiums were preferred venues in this scheme, compared to flat fields or baseball stadiums, although a few of the latter added to the routing. As with many large-scale tours of its era, the U2 360° Tour had both the workforce and the revenues associated with a medium-sized company.|$|E
