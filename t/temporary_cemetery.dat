After meeting with representatives of the Traditions Council, Student Senate, and E-2, the athletic department decided to create a <b>temporary</b> <b>cemetery</b> across the street in Cain Park. Upon completion of the stadium addition in 1999, the graves were relocated to a permanent cemetery at the new, tree-lined Richardson Zone Plaza. Since the recent additions blocked the gravesites' view of Kyle Field, a miniature scoreboard was constructed on the outside of the stadium so that the dead mascots can still watch the Aggies play.|$|E

50|$|The Korean War {{began when}} North Korean People's Army forces {{attacked}} south in June 1950. As the fighting progressed, <b>temporary</b> military <b>cemeteries</b> for battle casualties were established by United Nations forces near {{the towns of}} Taejon (July 9, 1950), Kwan-ui (Kwan-ni), Kum-chon, and Sindong. When the North Korean forces pushed towards Pusan, these cemeteries had to be abandoned. Later, as the Battle of Pusan Perimeter developed, <b>temporary</b> <b>cemeteries</b> were established at Masan, Miryang, and Taegu, with a Pusan cemetery being established on July 11, 1950. As the fighting pushed into North Korea, <b>temporary</b> <b>cemeteries</b> were established {{in or near the}} towns of Kaesong, Sukehon, Wonsan, Pupchong (Pukchong County), Yudarn-ni and Koto-ri. Some 11 division-level cemeteries were established in the first two months of fighting and later 5 UN military cemeteries were established in North Korea.|$|R

5000|$|The Army removed Lechner as {{superintendent}} of the cemetery in early August 2015 after a performance review [...] "called into question his ability to serve successfully as a senior leader".

[...] After the war, it {{was selected as the}} only permanent American World War II military cemetery in the British Isles, and about 42% of those temporarily interred in England and Northern Ireland during the war were reinterred at Cambridge Cemetery. It was dedicated on 16 July 1956.|$|E
50|$|The {{developers}} received {{permission to}} build the cemetery a month later, but disagreements between the various burial societies delayed the first burial until the fall of 1951.

50|$|Following the Battle of Gettysburg, Biggs {{was hired}} to disinter bodies from <b>temporary</b> <b>cemeteries,</b> place them in coffins, and rebury them. The work started on October 1863 and ended in March 1864. He was paid $1.25 per body and worked with a crew of laborers. Gettysburg's Unknown Soldier, Amos Humiston, was among the disinterred.|$|R
50|$|Because of {{confusion}} during {{the movement of}} remains from <b>temporary</b> <b>cemeteries,</b> the remains of one Canadian soldier were misplaced; his tombstone is set apart from the others, and bears an inscription stating that {{it is known that}} his remains are in the Bény-sur-Mer cemetery.

Originally used by the {{hospital}} as farmland for grazing milk cows, the area was converted into a <b>temporary</b> <b>cemetery</b> during the Arab siege of Jerusalem in 1948. Approximately 200 burials were conducted here between March and October of that year. Most graves were transferred to permanent cemeteries after the war, but a handful remain, notably those of several prominent Jerusalem rabbis and the founding director of Shaare Zedek Hospital, Dr. Moshe Wallach.|$|E
50|$|The {{site of the}} {{cemetery}} was liberated from Nazi control by the U.S. 1st Infantry Division on 8 September 1944. A <b>temporary</b> <b>cemetery</b> was established on the site on 8 February 1945. After the war, the Ardennes site was designated a permanent cemetery, becoming one of fourteen permanent cemeteries for American World War II dead on foreign soil. All temporary cemeteries were disestablished by the U.S. Army, and the bodies of those whose next of kin requested permanent interment overseas were moved {{to one of the}} fourteen permanent cemeteries.|$|E
50|$|Starting on Christmas Day in 1950, the United States made a {{sweeping}} change in its policies regarding {{the handling of}} soldiers {{who had been killed}} in action. Rather than burying them in <b>temporary</b> <b>cemeteries</b> for return at a future date after the conclusion of the war, soldiers killed in action were immediately returned to the United States. This policy, known as concurrent return, remains in effect to this day.|$|R
50|$|Most of the 6,012 {{soldiers}} and support personnel honorably interred {{at this site}} died fighting during the Second Battle of the Marne and the Oise-Aisne campaign. The site also includes American servicemen who were buried in <b>temporary</b> <b>cemeteries</b> and were moved to this site when their families requested that they be buried overseas. All forty-eight of the states that existed at the time, {{as well as the}} District of Columbia, are represented. Stars of David mark graves of Jewish soldiers, all others have a Latin Cross. The headstones are made from white marble quarried in Carrara, Italy.|$|R
50|$|Until 1948, Jewish burials in Jerusalem were {{conducted}} in the centuries-old Jewish cemetery on the Mount of Olives. In 1948, the Arab siege of Jerusalem cut off access to the Mount of Olives, and this remained the status quo after the 1949 Armistice Agreements. In 1948 several <b>temporary</b> <b>cemeteries</b> opened to handle wartime deaths in Jerusalem, including the Sanhedria cemetery, Sheikh Badr Cemetery, and the Shaare Zedek Cemetery (on {{the grounds of the}} old Shaare Zedek Hospital on Jaffa Road). After the establishment of the state, however, these were deemed inadequate for the needs of a growing city.|$|R

50|$|At the {{beginning}} of the war, the nearest U.S. Army mortuary affairs unit was the 108th Graves Registration Platoon in Yokohama, Japan, which was searching for the remains of missing World War II American airmen. The 108th was reconfigured as the 114th Graves Registration Company and deployed to establish <b>temporary</b> <b>cemeteries</b> at Hungnam, Pyongyang, and Suchon as the fighting continued. Supporting the 2nd Infantry Division was the Graves Registration Section of the 2nd Quartermaster Company, which collected the remains of Allied and American soldiers to be further processed by the 148th Graves Registration Company. When UN forces launched the Inchon Invasion in September 1950, a platoon from the 565th Graves Registration Company accompanied them. Other mortuary affairs units included the 293rd Graves Registration Company, activated in April 1951. It was difficult to recover remains and conduct burials in Korea, due to the rugged geography and harsh climate, and the threat of unexploded ordnance and booby-traps.|$|R
50|$|It is the {{resting place}} of 3,651 Commonwealth {{servicemen}} {{who were killed}} or died during the fighting in the area during World War II, 2,676 {{of whom have been}} identified. Many had been buried in <b>temporary</b> battlefield <b>cemeteries</b> or individual graves and their remains were relocated to Knightsbridge while those who lie without graves are commemorated at the Alamein Memorial. There are also 18 non-Commonwealth burials at Knightsbridge including one Polish soldier and one non-combatant.|$|R
50|$|Today, {{the museum}} grounds are spread across both {{the north and}} south sides of Route 25A.

50|$|Sheikh Badr (شيخ بدر, שייח' באדר) was a Palestinian Arab {{village on}} a hilltop in west Jerusalem. It was {{depopulated}} during the 1947-1948 Civil War in Mandatory Palestine {{on the order}} of the Haganah. From 1948 to 1951, a <b>temporary</b> Jewish <b>cemetery</b> was established here; a few hundred graves still remain from that time. After 1949, the area was incorporated into a new area called Givat Ram. The Hebrew University of Jerusalem at Givat Ram, the Supreme Court of Israel, and the Jerusalem International Convention Center were built on land formerly belonging to the village.|$|R
5|$|During the {{conflict}} itself, monuments were erected near the battlefields and the <b>temporary</b> <b>cemeteries</b> {{being used to}} store the dead. It had been hoped in Britain to repatriate the war dead, but this rapidly proved entirely impractical, leading to haphazard, improvised arrangements around the battlefields. By 1916 over 200 war cemeteries had been commissioned in France and Belgium, prompting debate about what longer term memorials might be appropriate at these sites. The government was concerned that unsuitable, even distasteful memorials might be erected by relatives at the cemeteries and the decision was taken that the cemeteries would be controlled by the state, and that a uniform design would {{be applied to the}} memorials at the graves. French cemeteries were used for as memorial sites for ceremonies by injured soldiers during the war and many towns began to name streets and squares after Verdun. In Belgium, where the movement of the war and losses of territory had meant that the Flemish elements of the population were increasingly forming a disproportionate percentage of the army, the language on the memorial headstone gradually became an issue, leading to calls for the creation of heldenhuldezerkjes, headstones inscribed in Flemish, rather than the usual French. In Imperial Russia, the Moscow City Fraternal Cemetery was constructed for the war dead in 1915 by the Imperial royal family and senior Moscow political leaders, who hoped that its inspiring architecture would ensure patriotism in future generations of Russians.|$|R
5000|$|Established in Nettuno, Lazio, as a <b>temporary</b> wartime <b>cemetery</b> on 24 January 1944, {{two days}} after the landing at Anzio and Nettuno codenamed Operation Shingle the site covers 77 acre, rising in a gentle slope from a broad pool with an island and cenotaph flanked by groups of Italian cypress trees. Beyond the pool is the immense field of headstones of 7,861 of American {{military}} war dead, arranged in gentle arcs on broad green lawns beneath rows of Roman pines. The majority of these men died in the liberation of Sicily, codenamed Operation Husky (10 July to 17 August 1943); in the landings in the Salerno Area, codenamed Operation Avalanche (9 September 1943) and the heavy fighting northward; in the landings, codenamed Operation Shingle, at Anzio and Nettuno and expansion of the beachhead (22 January 1944 to May 1944); and in air and naval support in the regions.|$|R
50|$|For eight days, {{from the}} morning of the Thursday before Remembrance Sunday until the evening of {{following}} Thursday, the lawn of St Margaret's Church, Westminster, between Westminster Abbey and the Houses of Parliament, is marked out with 250 plots for regimental and armed services associations. Participants are able to buy a wooden token of remembrance (originally remembrance crosses, now a variety of shapes for different religions, including for 'no faith') decorated with a remembrance poppy. The token is generally marked with the name of a member of the armed forces who was killed in action and planted in the appropriate plot. The packed lines of remembrance symbols in the separate plots can resemble a <b>temporary</b> military <b>cemetery.</b> After the Field of Remembrance closes, the crosses are collected and burnt, and the ashes are scattered at the First World War battlefields in northern France and Belgium. Any money raised at the event is traditionally donated by The Poppy Factory to The Royal British Legion.|$|R
5000|$|After their {{retreat in}} 1950, dead Soldiers and Marines were buried at a <b>temporary</b> {{military}} <b>cemetery</b> near Hungnam, North Korea. During Operation Glory, which occurred from July to November 1954, {{the dead of}} each side were exchanged; remains of 4,167 US soldiers/Marines were exchanged for 13,528 North Korean/Chinese dead. In addition 546 civilians who died in United Nations prisoner of war camps were {{turned over to the}} South Korean Government. After [...] "Operation Glory" [...] 416 Korean War [...] "unknowns" [...] were buried in the Punchbowl Cemetery.
