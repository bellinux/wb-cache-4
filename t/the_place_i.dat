500|$|After {{the failure}} of Cooper's endeavor, Priestley {{attempted}} to convince other friends to move to Northumberland, particularly those he had made in America, but to no avail. Priestley wrote in his Memoirs that [...] "the settlement was given up, but being here, {{and my wife and}} myself liking <b>the</b> <b>place,</b> <b>I</b> have determined to take up my residence here, though subject to many disadvantages. Philadelphia was excessively expensive, and this a comparatively cheap place; and my sons, settling in the neighborhood, will be less exposed to temptation, and more likely to form habits of sobriety and industry." ...|$|E
500|$|Harrison {{included}} a rough mix of [...] "Ding Dong" [...] on a tape {{he sent to}} Asylum Records boss David Geffen in January 1974, shortly before travelling to India to visit Shankar and escape his unhappy domestic situation with Boyd. The purpose of the tape {{was to find a}} distributor for albums by Harrison's future Dark Horse Records acts – Shankar Family & Friends by Shankar, and Splinter's <b>The</b> <b>Place</b> <b>I</b> Love – both of which had started off as Harrison productions for the Beatles' Apple record label. He added two songs of his own on the tape, with introductory comments about [...] "Ding Dong".|$|E
500|$|After the {{shooting}} of the film, Leto quickly went on a liquid diet. He explained, [...] "I've been fasting ever since. I've been doing this very strange, like, lemon and cayenne pepper and water fast. I didn't eat any food for 10 days straight; I think I lost 20 pounds that first 10 days." [...] Losing the excess weight after Chapter 27 proved a challenge. [...] "It took about {{a year to get}} back to a place that felt semi-normal," [...] he said; [...] "I don't know if I'll ever be back to <b>the</b> <b>place</b> <b>I</b> was physically. I'd never do it again; it definitely gave me some problems." ...|$|E

500|$|Harrison {{returned}} to England in March 1974 and recorded [...] "Simply Shady" [...] {{the following month}} for his new album, Dark Horse. Unlike his two previous studio albums, All Things Must Pass and Material World, Harrison worked on Dark Horse in stages, over a year-long period. During this time, he focused instead on projects such as setting up Dark Horse Records and producing albums by the record label's first two signings: Shankar's Shankar Family & Friends, and <b>The</b> <b>Place</b> <b>I</b> Love by the group Splinter. Leng cites the recording of [...] "Simply Shady" [...] – an impromptu session with the L.A. Express, who were touring the UK as Joni Mitchell's backing group – {{as an example of}} the unpredictable approach that Harrison adopted when making Dark Horse.|$|E
500|$|Of more {{profound}} consequence, and the inspiration behind the Hindu bhajan [...] "It Is 'He' (Jai Sri Krishna)", was {{his trip to}} India, in January and February 1974. In Benares, Harrison forged a plan with longtime mentor Shankar to sponsor an Indian classical-music concert tour later in the year, featuring as many as eighteen musicians and an unprecedented (in the West) range of traditional Indian instruments. An album would be recorded just beforehand, at Harrison's home studio at Friar Park, in Oxfordshire. Ravi Shankar's Music Festival from India was the realisation of a long-held dream for the ex-Beatle, but, as with his dedication to Splinter's <b>The</b> <b>Place</b> <b>I</b> Love, the project would impact {{on the quality of}} his own album.|$|E

Well, just because you are young doesn't mean that you haven't had a hard life. It's been difficult for me, moving around so much, having to grow up by myself, basically on my own, my parents divorced. And I always felt kind of different from everyone else in my neighborhoods. I was a different person – ethnically. And sometimes {{that can be a}} problem. If you look a certain way everybody goes, 'White girl,' and I'd go, 'No, that's not what I am.'" ...|$|E

I {{think that it was}} really nice for them to invite Astrid into the importance of that instead of keeping her in the dark. At least she knows that she's a part of this family and this affects her. I think she serves as a really important character in these later episodes because Astrid is kind of the only person that isn't directly involved with everything that is still on his side. She has {{to step up to the}} plate and be that comfort for him because if he doesn't have anyone there, he's basically going to regress and go back to <b>the</b> <b>place,</b> <b>I</b> think mentally, that he was in when he was in the mental institution. And of course we don't want that." ...|$|E
500|$|Lowell {{returned}} to the United States and began his duties at Harvard {{in the summer of}} 1856. Still grieving the loss of his wife, however, he avoided Elmwood, lodging instead in an area known as Professors' Row on Kirkland Street in Cambridge along with his daughter Mabel and her governess Frances Dunlap. Lowell and Dunlap married in 1857. After the death of Lowell's father in January 1861 due to a heart attack, he moved back to Elmwood with his family. Despite avoiding the home for so long, he was pleased to be back. He wrote to his friend Charles Frederick Briggs: [...] "I am back again to <b>the</b> <b>place</b> <b>I</b> love best. I am sitting in my old garret, at my old desk, smoking my old pipe... I begin to feel more like my old self than I have these ten years". However, Elmwood's expenses drained him, with taxes at $1,000 a year. As early as 1867, he considered renting out Elmwood and moving into a smaller home elsewhere but never did. Instead, to ease his financial plight, he began to sell off land in 1870 until only two and a half acres remained.|$|E
500|$|Kiedis' {{feelings}} of alienation from his bandmates {{led him to}} feel that the city of Los Angeles was his only companion: [...] "I felt an unspoken bond between me and my city. I'd spent so much time wandering through the streets of L.A. and hiking through the Hollywood Hills that I sensed there was a nonhuman entity, maybe the spirit of the hills and the city, who had me in her sights and was looking after me." [...] The lines [...] "Sometimes I feel like / My only friend / Is the city I live in / The City of Angels / Lonely as I am / Together we cry" [...] show a direct link to Kiedis' isolation and sense of susceptibility. Despite these emotions, Kiedis believed that his life was better without drugs, telling Rolling Stone that [...] "no matter how sad or lonely I got, things were a million percent better than they were two years earlier when I was using drugs all the time. There was no comparison." [...] The optimistic ideology gave birth to the chorus of the song: [...] "I don't ever want to feel / Like I did that day / Take me to <b>the</b> <b>place</b> <b>I</b> love", [...] "the place" [...] meaning his bandmates, friends, and family.|$|E

500|$|Much of the {{discussion}} after the match centred around referee Terje Hauge's decision to send off Lehmann. Football pundit Mark Lawrenson stated: [...] "The game changed when Arsenal goalkeeper Jens Lehmann was sent off". Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger agreed: [...] "When Jens Lehmann got sent off, that left us with 70 minutes to play with ten against eleven, against a team that retains the ball very well". He refused to openly criticise this decision, although he did criticise the decision to award Barcelona's first goal, as he felt that Samuel Eto'o was offside. Wenger was also adamant that his young side would bounce back from the defeat. One person who did criticise the referee was Thierry Henry, stating: [...] "I was kicked all over <b>the</b> <b>place.</b> <b>I</b> expected the referee to do his job. I don't think he did". There was much discussion after the match over whether Henry would remain with Arsenal or move to Barcelona, whom he had been linked with a move to over the past months. Arsène Wenger was asked post match if Henry would leave, to which the Arsenal manager replied: [...] "I don't know. I don't think so". However, on 19 May, Henry signed a new four-year contract with Arsenal, ending the speculation about a possible move to Barcelona.|$|E
500|$|George Harrison's third studio album {{since the}} Beatles' {{break-up}} {{came at the}} end of [...] "a bad domestic year", as he describes it in his 1980 autobiography. From the middle of 1973, with his marriage to Pattie Boyd all but over, Harrison had immersed himself in his work, particularly on developing the acts he would eventually sign to his new record label, Dark Horse Records − Ravi Shankar and a hitherto unknown group called Splinter. Business issues related to the Beatles' company Apple Corps were also coming to a head during 1973–74, as Harrison, John Lennon and Ringo Starr launched legal proceedings against Allen Klein, their former manager and ally against Paul McCartney (who had served the original lawsuit in December 1970 seeking to dissolve the band's partnership). The simultaneous winding down of Apple Corps' subsidiaries left a number of music and film projects in jeopardy, which resulted in Harrison having to make regular trips to Los Angeles in order to find a distributor for the Shankar Family & Friends album, most of which was recorded in California in April 1973, and Splinter's debut, <b>The</b> <b>Place</b> <b>I</b> Love. Another venture that was affected was the movie Little Malcolm, an Apple Films project for which Harrison was executive producer and working to seal a distribution deal in Europe.|$|E
500|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1857, The Atlantic Monthly was established, and Lowell was its first editor. With its first issue in November of that year, he at once gave the {{magazine}} the stamp of high literature and of bold speech on public affairs. In January 1861, Lowell's father {{died of a heart}} attack, inspiring Lowell to move his family back to Elmwood. As he wrote to his friend Briggs, [...] "I am back again to <b>the</b> <b>place</b> <b>I</b> love best. I am sitting in my old garret, at my old desk, smoking my old pipe... I begin to feel more like my old self than I have these ten years." [...] Shortly thereafter, in May, he left The Atlantic Monthly when James Thomas Fields took over as editor; the magazine had been purchased by Ticknor and Fields for $10,000 two years before. Lowell returned to Elmwood by January 1861 but maintained an amicable relationship with the new owners of the journal, continuing to submit his poetry and prose {{for the rest of his}} life. His prose, however, was more abundantly presented in the pages of the North American Review during the years 1862–1872. For the Review, he served as a coeditor along with Charles Eliot Norton. Lowell's reviews for the journal covered a wide variety of literary releases of the day, though he was writing fewer poems.|$|E

While McKeon had previously told Herzog that Smith was untouchable in any trade, the Padres were now so angry at Smith's agent Gottlieb that McKeon was willing to deal. [...] McKeon and Herzog agreed in principle to a six-player trade, with Templeton for Smith as the centerpiece. It was then that Padres manager Dick Williams informed Herzog that a no-trade clause had been included in Smith's 1981 contract. Upon learning of the trade, Smith's initial reaction was to invoke the clause and stay in San Diego, {{but he was still}} interested to hear what the Cardinals had to say. While the deal for the players beside Templeton and Smith went through, Herzog flew to San Diego to meet with Smith and Gottlieb over the Christmas holiday. Smith later recalled that, [...] "Whitey told me that with me playing shortstop for the St. Louis Cardinals, we could win the pennant. He made me feel wanted, which was a feeling I was quickly losing from the Padres. The mere fact that Whitey would come all the way out there to talk to us was more than enough to convince me that St. Louis was <b>the</b> <b>place</b> <b>I</b> wanted to be." ...|$|E

He wrote to his friend John Vaughan: [...] "We know but little more than we did when we left you of European affairs." [...] In the winter of 1794–95, Priestley wrote to friends that his situation was very [...] "distant from my original views" [...] and [...] "my time here is far from passing so agreeably as it did in England", yet he was [...] "very thankful for such an asylum" [...] and he attempted [...] "to make the best of my situation". In his letters to friends back in Britain, Priestley consistently referred to himself as an exile and to England as his real home. Mary was happier with the couple's situation and wrote to William Vaughan: [...] "I am happy and thankful to meet with so sweet a situation and so peaceful a retreat as <b>the</b> <b>place</b> <b>I</b> now write from. Dr. Priestley also likes it and of his own choice intends to settle here, which is more than I hoped for at the time we came up...This country is very delightful, the prospects of wood and water more beautiful than I have ever seen before and the people plain and decent in their manners." ...|$|E

As on Living in the Material World, Harrison produced the sessions himself and Phil McDonald again served as recording engineer. Using the same line-up of musicians as on Material World – Ringo Starr, Jim Keltner, Klaus Voormann, and Gary Wright and Nicky Hopkins alternating on keyboards – Harrison taped basic tracks for his hoped-for Christmas/New Year [...] "classic", [...] "Ding Dong, Ding Dong", {{an early version of}} [...] "Dark Horse", and [...] "So Sad". Harrison had originally given the latter song to near-neighbour Alvin Lee to record, in August, and had guested on the session along with Ron Wood. Harrison, Lee and Wood all subsequently added lead-guitar parts to [...] "Ding Dong", in the first of Harrison's attempts to build up the song's layers of instrumentation, and so re-create his former collaborator Phil Spector's celebrated Wall of Sound. This overdubbing session took place sometime after Harrison's return from India in early March 1974, judging by the pre-overdubbed version of [...] "Ding Dong" [...] that Harrison included on a tape for David Geffen shortly before leaving. [...] "So Sad" [...] would similarly receive a significant amount of overdubbing, creating a [...] "harrowing encounter", as Harrison stated his [...] "great despair" [...] {{at the end of his}} relationship with Boyd.|$|E
