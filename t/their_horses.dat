5|$|In April 1915 the New Zealand and Australian forces, {{except the}} mounted troops, {{were sent to}} serve in the Gallipoli Campaign. Heavy {{casualties}} during the landings provided a need for reinforcements, so the regiment and other mounted troops, without <b>their</b> <b>horses,</b> were ordered to Gallipoli.|$|E
5|$|In Fáfnismál, {{the dying}} wyrm Fafnir tells the hero Sigurd that, during {{the events of}} Ragnarok, bearing spears, gods will meet at Óskópnir. From there, the gods will cross Bilröst, which will break apart as they cross over it, causing <b>their</b> <b>horses</b> to dredge through an immense river.|$|E
5|$|Motor {{vehicles}} were restricted {{at the end}} of the 19th century because of concerns for the health and safety of the island's residents and horses after local carriage drivers complained that automobiles startled <b>their</b> <b>horses.</b> This ban continues to the present with exceptions only for emergency and construction vehicles.|$|E

5|$|Tobacco smoke enemas {{were also}} {{reportedly}} used by 19th-century Danish farmers, for horses that needed laxatives, and the US anthropologist Frank Speck reported that contemporary Catawba Native Americans also treated <b>their</b> <b>horses</b> using the technique.|$|E
5|$|Broader {{tensions}} in American society surfaced in Yosemite {{when a large}} number of youths gathered in the park over the summer of 1970, triggering a riot on July4 after rangers tried to evict visitors from camping illegally in Stoneman Meadow. Rioters attacked the rangers with rocks, and pulled mounted rangers from <b>their</b> <b>horses.</b> The National Guard was brought in to restore order.|$|E
5|$|Burnham and Armstrong leapt {{over the}} dead Mlimo {{and ran down}} a trail toward <b>their</b> <b>horses.</b> The warriors in the village nearby picked up their arms and searched for the attackers; to {{distract}} them, Burnham set fire to some of their huts. The two men escaped and rode back to Bulawayo. Shortly after, Cecil Rhodes walked unarmed into the Matabele stronghold and made peace with the rebels, ending the Second Matabele War.|$|E

5|$|Chaytor's Anzac Mounted Division {{moved off}} across the {{maritime}} plain towards the coast soon after daylight on 9 November, having watered <b>their</b> <b>horses</b> the previous evening. The advance was led by two brigades—on the left the 1st Light Horse Brigade and on the right the 2nd Light Horse Brigade rode in line, each {{responsible for their own}} front and outer flanks; the attached 7th Mounted Brigade formed a reserve.|$|E
5|$|Horse rings, {{often made}} of iron or brass, are {{remnants}} from the 1800s, when horses, and horse-drawn vehicles, provided the primary mode of transportation. In 1978, The Register-Guard {{suggested that the}} rings might only be {{as old as the}} early 1900s. The rings allowed residents to tether <b>their</b> <b>horses</b> to sidewalks.|$|E
5|$|Horses were {{specially}} bred for the joust, {{and heavier}} armour developed. However, {{this did not}} necessarily lead to significantly larger horses. Interpreters at the Royal Armouries, Leeds, re-created the joust, using specially bred horses and replica armour. <b>Their</b> <b>horses</b> accurately represented the medieval mount, being compactly built and not particularly tall.|$|E

5|$|In 1911, the French society {{restricted}} registration to horses {{with both}} parents already {{registered with the}} society. In the early 20th century, the Percheron {{was one of the}} four major draft horse breeds, along with the Belgian, the Clydesdale and the Shire. Breeders could sell <b>their</b> <b>horses</b> for significant amounts of money, especially in the United States and Canada, where breeding stock brought a premium price.|$|E
5|$|In Egypt the {{regiment}} continued its training programme, working from reveille at 05:00 to 17:30 when they stabled <b>their</b> <b>horses</b> {{at the end}} of the working day. Every third or fourth night the soldiers performed guard duty or looked after the horses. It was in Egypt that {{the regiment}}, and brigade, came under command of the newly formed New Zealand and Australian Division which, along with the 1st Division, made up the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC). In April 1915, the division's infantry units left Egypt for an undisclosed destination, and it was not until 1 May that the regiment learned about the Gallipoli landings. Four days later the regiment received news that it would also deploy to Gallipoli, but in a dismounted role without <b>their</b> <b>horses.</b> On 7 May, twenty-six officers and 482 other ranks (some men remaining behind to look after <b>their</b> <b>horses)</b> boarded trains for Alexandria to board their transports. They arrived off the Gallipoli peninsula on 12 May, and started to disembark, landing at Anzac Cove. By now the troops had been re-equipped for their dismounted role, and carried a rifle with two hundred rounds of ammunition, a small pack, a haversack, mess tins, a bayonet, and an entrenching tool. Once ashore, the regiment camped that night behind the front line.|$|E
5|$|Ironically, some pure-blooded desert-bred Arabians in Syria had {{enormous}} difficulties being accepted as registrable purebred Arabians {{because many of}} the Bedouin who owned them saw no need to obtain a piece of paper to verify the purity of <b>their</b> <b>horses.</b> However, eventually the Syrians developed a stud book for their animals that was accepted by the World Arabian Horse Association (WAHO) in 2007.|$|E

5|$|Some of the {{earliest}} examples of horses being ridden in warfare were horse-mounted archers or spear-throwers, dating to the reigns of the Assyrian rulers Ashurnasirpal II and Shalmaneser III. However, these riders sat far back on <b>their</b> <b>horses,</b> a precarious position for moving quickly, and the horses were held by a handler on the ground, keeping the archer free to use the bow. Thus, these archers were more a type of mounted infantry than true cavalry. The Assyrians developed cavalry in response to invasions by nomadic people from the north, such as the Cimmerians, who entered Asia Minor in the 8th century BC and took over parts of Urartu {{during the reign of}} Sargon II, approximately 721 BC. Mounted warriors such as the Scythians also had an influence on the region in the 7th century BC. By the reign of Ashurbanipal in 669 BC, the Assyrians had learned to sit forward on <b>their</b> <b>horses</b> in the classic riding position still seen today and could be said to be true light cavalry. The ancient Greeks used both light horse scouts and heavy cavalry, although not extensively, possibly due to the cost of keeping horses.|$|E
5|$|The Iazyges wore heavy armor, such as Sugarloaf helms, {{and scale}} armor (made of iron, bronze, horn or horse hoof). They used long two-handed lances called Contus, which they wielded from horses, whom they barded. Their {{military}} was exclusively {{made up of}} cavalry. They {{are believed to have}} used saddle blankets on <b>their</b> <b>horses.</b>|$|E
5|$|The elite cavalry {{corps of}} the Persians was the Aswaran. The lance was {{probably}} their preferred weapon, having {{the power to}} skewer two men simultaneously. <b>Their</b> <b>horses</b> were covered in lamellar armor {{to protect them from}} enemy archers. Persian archers had a lethal range of about 175 meters and accurate range at about 50–60 meters.|$|E

Herein Baba Ji traveled on horseback along with two associates, and took rest here. The chain with which they tied <b>their</b> <b>horse</b> is still visible in Gurudwara Sahib.|$|R
5|$|The rebels, {{heading for}} Warminster {{got as far}} as Trowbridge, but royalist forces cut off the route and Monmouth turned back towards Somerset through Shepton Mallet, {{arriving}} in Wells on 1 July. The soldiers damaged the Bishop's Palace and west front of Wells Cathedral, tearing lead from the roof to make bullets, breaking the windows, smashing the organ and the furnishings, and for a time stabling <b>their</b> <b>horses</b> in the nave.|$|E
5|$|The {{remains of}} the Muslim army once again sought refuge in Mineo, where Theodotus {{blockaded}} them and soon reduced them {{to the point of}} eating <b>their</b> <b>horses</b> and even dogs. When they heard of this reversal, the Arab garrison of Agrigento abandoned the city and retreated to Mazara. Thus, by the autumn of 829, Sicily had almost been cleared of the Muslim invaders.|$|E
5|$|Thirteen horses {{entered the}} Derby, {{which could have}} at most twenty participants. Horse owners had to pay a final entry fee of $2,500 to have <b>their</b> <b>horses</b> officially entered.
