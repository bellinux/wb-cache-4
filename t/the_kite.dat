5|$|Riverhead Books {{published}} <b>The</b> <b>Kite</b> Runner, ordering {{an initial}} printing of 50,000 copies in hardback. It {{was released on}} May 29, 2003, and the paperback edition was released a year later. Hosseini took a year-long absence from practicing medicine to promote the book, signing copies, speaking at various events, and raising funds for Afghan causes. Originally published in English, <b>The</b> <b>Kite</b> Runner was later translated into 42 languages for publication in 38 countries. In 2013, Riverhead released the 10th anniversary edition with a new gold-rimmed cover and a foreword by Hosseini. That same year, on May 21, Khaled Hosseini published another book called And the Mountains Echoed.|$|E
5|$|A Thousand Splendid Suns is a 2007 {{novel by}} Afghan-American author Khaled Hosseini. It is his second, {{following}} his bestselling 2003 debut, <b>The</b> <b>Kite</b> Runner. Mariam is an illegitimate child, and suffers {{from both the}} stigma surrounding her birth along with the abuse she faces throughout her marriage. Laila, born a generation later, is comparatively privileged during her youth until their lives intersect and she is also forced to accept a marriage proposal from Rasheed, Mariam's husband.|$|E

5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>kites</b> pull up <b>the</b> {{long string}} {{on which they}} are tethered, and the {{resulting}} energy is then used to drive an electric generator. When {{the end of the}} string is reached the pull force of <b>the</b> <b>kites</b> is reduced by changing the angle of attack of <b>the</b> <b>kites</b> [...] "wing shape", and the string is then rewound with the electric generator acting as a motor, or by other means. If the string is reduced to its minimum length the next energy generating cycle is started by restoring the angle of attack of <b>the</b> <b>kites</b> to maximum lift.|$|R
5|$|Hosseini has {{commented that}} he {{considers}} <b>The</b> <b>Kite</b> Runner to be a father–son story, emphasizing the familial {{aspects of the}} narrative, an element that he continued to use in his later works. Themes of guilt and redemption feature prominently in the novel, with a pivotal scene depicting an act of violence against Hassan that Amir fails to prevent. The {{latter half of the}} book centers on Amir's attempts to atone for this transgression by rescuing Hassan's son over two decades later.|$|E
5|$|Hosseini stated his {{intentions}} {{to make the}} characters more complex and morally ambiguous. Continuing the familial theme established in his previous novels, <b>The</b> <b>Kite</b> Runner and A Thousand Splendid Suns, And the Mountains Echoed centers on the rapport between siblings. Besides Abdullah and Pari, Hosseini introduced two other sibling and sibling-like relationships—the children's stepmother Parwana and her disabled sister Masooma and an Afghan-American doctor named Idris and his cousin Timur.|$|E
5|$|Khaled Hosseini {{was born}} in Afghanistan but left the country in 1976 {{at the age of}} 11, {{eventually}} moving to the United States where he worked as a doctor. He wrote his first novel, <b>The</b> <b>Kite</b> Runner, in 2003 and became a full-time writer {{a year and a half}} later. He published his second book, A Thousand Splendid Suns, in 2007. Both novels were successful, and by the time of his third publication they had together sold over 38 million copies across 70 countries.|$|E
50|$|A kite is an orthodiagonal {{quadrilateral}} {{in which}} one diagonal is a line of symmetry. <b>The</b> <b>kites</b> are exactly <b>the</b> orthodiagonal quadrilaterals that contain a circle tangent to all four of their sides; that is, <b>the</b> <b>kites</b> are <b>the</b> tangential orthodiagonal quadrilaterals.|$|R

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Kite</b> Runner {{became a}} bestseller after being printed in {{paperback}} and was popularized in book clubs. It was a number one New York Times bestseller {{for over two}} years, with over seven million copies sold in the United States. Reviews were generally positive, though parts of the plot drew significant controversy in Afghanistan. A number of adaptations were created following publication, including a 2007 film of the same name, several stage performances, and a graphic novel.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Kite</b> Runner is {{the first}} novel by Afghan-American author Khaled Hosseini. Published in 2003 by Riverhead Books, it {{tells the story of}} Amir, a young boy from the Wazir Akbar Khan {{district}} of Kabul, whose closest friend is Hassan. The story is set against a backdrop of tumultuous events, from the fall of Afghanistan's monarchy through the Soviet military intervention, the exodus of refugees to Pakistan and the United States, {{and the rise of the}} Taliban regime.|$|E
5|$|The {{brothers}} {{flew the}} glider {{for only a}} few days in the early autumn of 1900 at Kitty Hawk. In the first tests, probably on October 3, Wilbur was aboard while the glider flew as a kite not far above the ground with men below holding tether ropes. Most of <b>the</b> <b>kite</b> tests were unpiloted, with sandbags or chains and even a local boy as ballast.|$|E

5|$|When a mouse {{or other}} prey is spotted, <b>the</b> <b>kite</b> drops silently onto it, feet-first with wings raised high; {{sometimes}} in one long drop to ground level, {{more often in}} two or more stages, with hovering pauses at intermediate heights. Prey is seized in the talons and about 75% of attacks are successful. Prey can either be eaten in flight or carried back to a perch. Birds will have a favoured feeding perch, beneath which accumulate piles of pellets or castings.|$|E
5|$|Further {{work was}} {{conducted}} by Otto von Guericke, Robert Boyle, Stephen Gray and C. F. du Fay. In the 18th century, Benjamin Franklin conducted extensive research in electricity, selling his possessions to fund his work. In June 1752 he is reputed to have attached a metal key {{to the bottom of}} a dampened kite string and flown <b>the</b> <b>kite</b> in a storm-threatened sky. A succession of sparks jumping from the key {{to the back of his}} hand showed that lightning was indeed electrical in nature. He also explained the apparently paradoxical behavior of the Leyden jar as a device for storing large amounts of electrical charge in terms of electricity consisting of both positive and negative charges.|$|E
5|$|Moveable sails: By {{the time}} of the Zhou Dynasty ship {{technologies}} such as stern mounted rudders were developed, and by the Han Dynasty, a well kept naval fleet {{was an integral part of}} the military. The Chinese used the complex moving technology behind <b>the</b> <b>kite</b> allowed then to develop the worlds first moving sails (in comparison with the mounted sails used in the West) around 200 AD. These moving sails allowed ships to sail into the wind for the first time in human history. Civilizations around the world soon emulated the Chinese technology and eventually moving sails became the standard on ships.|$|E
5000|$|Kites {{were also}} {{instrumental}} in the research of the Wright brothers as they developed the first airplane in the late 1800s. Over the next 70 years, many new kite designs were developed and often patented. These included Eddy's tail-less diamond <b>kite,</b> <b>the</b> tetrahedral <b>kite,</b> <b>the</b> flexible <b>kite,</b> <b>the</b> sled <b>kite,</b> and <b>the</b> parafoil <b>kite,</b> which helped to develop modern hang-gliders. [...] In fact, the period from 1860 to about 1910 became the [...] "golden age of kiting". Kites started {{to be used for}} scientific purposes, especially in meteorology, aeronautics, wireless communications and photography; many different designs of man-lifting kite were developed as well as power kites.|$|R

The Portsmouth International Kite Festival is organised annually by Portsmouth City Council and <b>The</b> <b>Kite</b> Society of Great Britain. It celebrated its 25th anniversary in 2016.|$|E
5|$|The film {{returns to}} the {{traditional}} gun barrel opening shot, which was altered into {{part of the story}} for Casino Royale where it was moved {{to the beginning of the}} title sequence. In this film the gun barrel sequence was moved to the end of the movie, which Wilson explained was done for a surprise, and to signify the conclusion of the story begun in the previous film. The opening credits sequence was created by MK12. Having worked on Forster's Stranger than Fiction and <b>The</b> <b>Kite</b> Runner, MK12 spontaneously began developing the sequence early on in production, and had a good idea of its appearance which meant it did not have to be redone when the title singer was changed. MK12 selected various twilight colours to represent Bond's mood and focused on a dot motif based on the gunbarrel shot. MK12 also worked on scenes with graphical user interface, including the electronic table MI6 use, and the Port-au-Prince, Haiti title cards.|$|E
25|$|In kitesurfing, {{the wind}} {{gradient}} {{is even more}} important, because the power kite is flown on 20-30m lines, and the kitesurfer can use <b>the</b> <b>kite</b> to jump off the water, bringing <b>the</b> <b>kite</b> to even greater heights above the sea surface.|$|E
25|$|Examples of {{tangential}} quadrilaterals are <b>the</b> <b>kites,</b> {{which include}} <b>the</b> rhombi, {{which in turn}} include <b>the</b> squares. <b>The</b> <b>kites</b> are exactly <b>the</b> tangential quadrilaterals that are also orthodiagonal. A right kite is a kite with a circumcircle. If a quadrilateral is both tangential and cyclic, it is called a bicentric quadrilateral, {{and if it is}} both tangential and a trapezoid, it is called a tangential trapezoid.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> letter-winged <b>kite</b> is <b>the</b> only fully nocturnal {{member of}} its family. Its {{principal}} prey is the Long-haired Rat, Rattus villosissimus. When population numbers of this rodent build up, following good rainfall, <b>the</b> <b>kites</b> {{are able to}} breed continuously and colonially so that their numbers increase in parallel. When the rodent populations decline, <b>the</b> now superabundant <b>kites</b> may disperse and appear in coastal areas far from their normal range in which, though they may occasionally breed, they do not persist and eventually disappear. One central Australian study over {{two and a half}} years found <b>the</b> <b>kites</b> had relocated to an area within six months of a rodent outbreak starting.|$|R

25|$|A kite is a {{tethered}} {{air foil}} that creates both lift and drag, {{in this case}} anchored to a vehicle with a tether, which guides the face of <b>the</b> <b>kite</b> to achieve the best angle of attack. The lift that sustains <b>the</b> <b>kite</b> in flight is generated when air flows around the kite's surface, producing low pressure above and high pressure below the wings. The interaction with the wind also generates horizontal drag along {{the direction of the}} wind. The resultant force vector from the lift and drag force components is opposed by the tension of {{one or more of the}} lines or tethers to which <b>the</b> <b>kite</b> is attached, thereby powering the vehicle.|$|E
