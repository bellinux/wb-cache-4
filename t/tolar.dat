There is a big difference in prosperity between the various regions. The economically most prosperous regions are the Central Slovenia region which includes the capital Ljubljana and the western Slovenian regions, as Goriška and Coastal–Karst.

25|$|Sisko angrily confronts Garak, {{who admits}} he planted a bomb on Vreenak's ship {{in case the}} forgery was not accepted. Garak also admits he killed <b>Tolar</b> {{in order to keep}} his work secret. Garak {{maintains}} that when the Romulans scan the wreckage and find the rod, any imperfections will be attributed to damage from the explosion, and thus the recording will implicate the Dominion as planned. Garak asserts that Sisko included him in the plan {{to do the things that}} Sisko was unwilling to do. Garak also states that Sisko can ease his conscience with the knowledge that the Alpha quadrant may have been saved at the cost of the life of one Romulan senator, one criminal and the self respect of one Starfleet officer, which he calls a bargain.|$|E
25|$|Prešeren's {{legacy in}} Slovene culture is enormous. He is {{generally}} regarded as the national poet. In 1905, his monument was placed at the central square in Ljubljana, now called Prešeren Square. By the early 1920s, all his surviving work had been catalogued and numerous critical editions of his works had been published. Several scholars were already dealing exclusively with the analysis of his work and little was left unknown about his life. In 1945, the anniversary of his death, called Prešeren Day, was declared as the Slovene cultural holiday. In 1989, his Zdravljica was declared the national anthem of Slovenia, replacing the old Naprej, zastava slave. In 1992, his effigy was portrayed on the Slovene 1000 <b>tolar</b> banknote, and since 2007, his image is on the Slovene two-euro coin. The highest Slovene prize for artistic achievements, the Prešeren Award, is named after him.|$|E
50|$|In 1612 Jan Lohelius {{became the}} {{archbishop}} of Prague, his work at Strahov then being continued by the new abbot, Kašpar Questenberg. He continued in the expensive work started by Lohelius, completed the lower cloisters and prelature, and even erected a new building {{in the form of}} St. Elizabeth's Hospital, as well as adding out-buildings and a brewery. Furthermore, he founded the Norbertine seminary in the New Town, which was intended for the theological studies of members of the order. All this was achieved during the Thirty Years' War, when Kašpar Questenberg himself was forced by the violence to flee from Prague. The financial account of the costs incurred by his building activities amounted to about 100,000 <b>tolars,</b> which at that time was a very respectable sum for any building work. In this respect, Kašpar Questenberg's expenditures were comparable with such builders as his contemporary Albrecht von Wallenstein.|$|R
50|$|Olimpija had {{a string}} of mixed results for the {{remainder}} of the season, getting knocked out in the round of 16 of the 2003-04 Slovenian Cup and finishing runners-up in the 2003-04 Slovenian PrvaLiga. However, most sponsors (including Schollmayer) decided to abandon the club at the end of the season which led to serious financial difficulties for the club. Following Schollmayer's exit, Olimpija were forced to sell almost all of their players. Although the club had started competing in the 2004-05 championship, the club had struggled on the pitch and failed to obtain competition licences issued by the Football Association of Slovenia, which led to its dissolution. Eventually the club, with a debt consisting of over 700 million Slovenian <b>tolars</b> (around three million euros in 2004 exchange rate), filed for bankruptcy and was dissolved by the end of year. However, the Football Association of Slovenia had exceptionally allowed the club to finish the 2004-05 season and, after finishing sixth in the national championship, Olimpija effectively ceased all operations.|$|R
40|$|Background. Osteoporosis {{becomes a}} serious illness {{when the patient}} breaks a bone. Osteoporotic {{fractures}} emerge in a larger number after the patients reach age 60 or above. The fracture of the wrist is the earliest osteoporotic fracture, vertebral fracture then follows {{and it is the}} most common fracture. The most serious and the most costly fracture is the hip fracture. The analysis of data on fractures of hips in General Hospital Maribor (GHM) between the years 1968 and 2000 has shown that the number of fractures has been steadily increasing from 76 in the year 1968 to 258 in the year 2000.  In 1968 the treatment was mainly conservative and the death rate was at 60 %. With the introduction of operative treatment, which is being used on 95 % of the patients nowadays, the death rate fell to 5 %. The cost of acute treatment, as assessed by the Health Insurrance {{at the end of the}} year 2000, amounted to 599, 360 <b>tolars</b> per case. The cost of the treatment of the vertebral fracture, which has been treated in outpatient’s department in 60 % of the cases, amounted to 113, 076 per case in the year 2000 in GHM. The cost of wrist fracture treatment, which has been handled in outpatient’s department in 90 % of the cases, added up to 30, 831 <b>tolars</b> per case. Conclusions. The osteoporotic fracture of the hip is caused by senile osteoporosis and it affects both men and women equally. That means that the menopausal osteoporosis does not have an important effect on the fracture of the hip. The number of hip fractures is increasing exponentially with the life span lengthening. With the introduction of operative treatment of hip fractures the early mortality decreased from 60 % to only 5 %. The cost of acute treatment of hip fracture has been three times lower in GHM compared to the same treatment in Great Britain in the year 2000.  In 85 % of the cases, the fracture of the wrist occurs in women shortly after the age of 60.  This confirms the thesis that the menopausal osteoporosis has an important impact on these fractures. The incidence of wrist fracture has been alike in all age groups, that is from 28 to 31 fractures per 1000 women and 3 to 5 fractures per 1000 men. The cost of wrist fracture treatment in GHM has been fourtimes lower than the cost of the same fracture treatment in Great Britain in the year 2000.  The incidence of vertebral fracture has been increasing with age and it occurs in 3 to 10 cases per 1000 women and 3 to 14 cases per 1000 men. The cost of vertebral fracture treatment has been two-times lower than the cost of the same injury treatment in Great Britain. </p...|$|R

50|$|In 1997, {{after the}} Supervisory Board of the Slovenian retail company Mercator deposed Kazimir Živko Pregelj as the chairman, due partly to the 2.5 billion <b>tolars</b> debt of the company, the board {{appointed}} Janković {{as the new}} director. In 2002, a recording by POP TV was published, in which Rop scolded at Janković that he himself had enabled Janković to enter Mercator. Both of them claimed later that the recording had been torn out of context, {{and that it had}} been about the entry into the supervisory board and not becoming the president of the company. According to Miran Goslar and Janković himself, the appointment was not politically motivated but made exclusively by influential managers in Mercator. Goslar stated that not even one of the then politicians supported the appointment of Janković.The entry of Janković transformed the company Mercator to the biggest retail company in Slovenia and one of the biggest in the region. The company took over numerous companies, starting with Klas in 1998, and numerous others, among them the most controversial being the take-over of Emona Merkur. In August 1999, the first Mercator hypermarket was opened in Šiška. Despite being a director, Janković actively helped his employees, for example with tidying shopping carts. In December 2000, Mercator opened its shops abroad for the first time, in Pula, Croatia, and Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and in 2002, the largest one in Belgrade, Serbia.|$|R
