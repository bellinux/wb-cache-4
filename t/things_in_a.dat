5|$|So much {{controversy}} has swirled around my career this past decade that very little attention ever gets paid to my music. The songs {{are all but}} forgotten. While I have no regrets regarding the choices I've made artistically, I've learned to appreciate {{the idea of doing}} <b>things</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> simpler way. So without a lot of fanfare, without any distractions, I present to you this collection of ballads. Some are old, some are new. All of them are from my heart.|$|E

Kea can solve logical puzzles, such as pushing and pulling <b>things</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> certain order to get to food, and will work together to achieve a certain objective. They have been filmed preparing and using tools.|$|E

6000|$|Whatever other {{objections}} {{have been}} made to this second proposition, arise, as far as I remember, merely from a confusion of the idea of essentialness or primariness with the idea of nobleness. The essential <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> building,--its first virtue,--is that it be strongly built, and fit for its uses. The noblest <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> building, and its highest virtue, is that it be nobly sculptured or painted.[22] ...|$|R
25|$|Earlier {{than the}} {{attestations}} {{in the full}} function as a numeral are a few instances where sampi was used in Athens as a mark to enumerate sequences of <b>things</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> set, along with the 24 other letters of the alphabet, without implying a specific decimal numeral value. For instance, there {{is a set of}} 25 metal tokens, each stamped with one of the letters from alpha to sampi, which are dated to the 4th century BC and were probably used as identification marks for judges in the courts of the Athenian democracy.|$|E
25|$|The {{southern}} part of the station consists of a superstructure which provides access from the overpass. Designed by Arne Henriksen, it has a unique shape and design, inspired by Aldo Rossi. Henriksen's superstructure is listed as a cultural heritage. The unique design of the station has made it a local landmark and it has been featured among other <b>things</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> borough logo. The northern part has an access superstructure made of steel and hardened glass, chosen to be resistant against vandalism. Both accesses have an elevator and stairs.|$|E
25|$|Even {{if there}} were {{exceedingly}} few <b>things</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> finite space in an infinite time, {{they would not have}} to repeat in the same configurations. Suppose there were three wheels of equal size, rotating on the same axis, one point marked on the circumference of each wheel, and these three points lined up in one straight line. If the second wheel rotated twice as fast as the first, and if the speed of the third wheel was 1/π of the speed of the first, the initial line-up would never recur.|$|E

25|$|The second volume, I Am Spock (1995), saw Nimoy {{communicating}} that {{he finally}} realized {{his years of}} portraying the Spock character had led to a much greater identification between the fictional character and himself. Nimoy had much input into how Spock would act in certain situations, and conversely, Nimoy's contemplation of how Spock acted gave him cause to think about <b>things</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> way that {{he never would have}} thought if he had not portrayed the character. As such, in this autobiography Nimoy maintains that in some meaningful sense he has merged with Spock {{while at the same time}} maintaining the distance between fact and fiction.|$|E
25|$|Facing the {{potential}} for military action, the Foreign Office sought some sort of compromise. Lord Carrington proposed to his counterpart, Nicanor Costa Méndez, to indulge the workers presence at Leith, given the proper documentation, which could include the stamping of temporary permissions instead of passports, a concession crucial to the Argentine position. The Argentine intention, however, was that the arrival of any of its citizens to South Georgia should follow the procedures agreed on the communications treaty of 1971. Governor Rex Hunt strongly rejected this extension of the agreement, valid only for the Falklands jurisdiction, and raised his concerns to the British government. Costa Mendez left <b>things</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> limbo; both countries were then {{on the brink of}} conflict.|$|E
25|$|However, {{the fourth}} state reform {{was not the}} end of the process of federalization. In 2001, a fifth state reform took place, under Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt, with the Lambermont and the Lombard Accords. In the course of that reform, more powers were {{transferred}} to the Communities and the Regions, with regard to agriculture, fisheries, foreign trade, development cooperation, auditing of electoral expenses and the supplementary financing of the political parties. The Regions became responsible for twelve regional taxes, and local and provincial government became a matter for the Regions. The first municipal and provincial elections under the supervision of the Regions were the 2006 municipal elections. The functioning of the Brussels institutions was also amended during the fifth state reform, which resulted among other <b>things</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> guaranteed representation of the Flemish inhabitants of Brussels in the Parliament of the Brussels-Capital Region.|$|E

25|$|On June 10, 2016, Eisley {{revealed}} {{that they had}} begun the process of recording their fifth studio record {{with the assistance of}} producer Will Yip at the band's own studio in Tyler {{at the beginning of the}} month. DuPree-Bemis spoke of the new album in the band's press release, mentioning that, “Musically, you could say it’s classic Eisley, in the sense that it’s melodic, moody pop and is written from the heart. Lyrically, it’s very whimsical; it has a vibe that will take you into its own world and let you escape your normal life for a few minutes. I like to cloak <b>things</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> little mystery and romance; I think it’s part of what makes all of Eisley’s songs sound like they’re from the same world. Every record is like opening and reading a book in a series.” Tracking for the album concluded in early July, with mention of plans to release the record in early 2017.|$|E
25|$|The next affective {{emotion in}} this {{beginning}} stage is incompetence. Feeling incompetent can spring from multiple <b>things</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> relationship, {{but during the}} initial stages of infidelity a person can experience this on an increased level. Meaning, they begin to notice when their partner does not say thank you for simple things, or they overthink any change made by the unfaithful partner. This can lead to a suspicious partner feeling like they cannot please their significant other and begin to feel incompetent in the relationship. When someone is having incompetent feelings due to someone else’s actions they begin to resent them creating a build-up and eventually an affective emotion outburst over something small. The faithful partner is not normally aware that their suspicion is the reason they feel incompetent in the relationship, and do not expect to be so irritated by the change of simple things; making it an affective response in this stage of infidelity (Miller, 2017). These unanticipated emotions could lead to more and multiple responses such as this one within the future of the initial stage of infidelity.|$|E
500|$|Another form of monistic Vedanta is Vishishtadvaita (Qualified Non-Dualism) as posited by the {{eleventh}} century philosopher Ramanuja. Ramanuja criticized Advaita Vedanta by arguing that consciousness is always intentional {{and that it is}} also always a property of something. Ramanuja's Brahman is defined by a multiplicity of qualities and properties in a single monistic entity. This doctrine is called [...] "samanadhikaranya" [...] (several <b>things</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> common substrate).|$|E

500|$|Unlike {{previous}} Converge releases, {{the songs}} on Axe to Fall {{do not have a}} central and consistent lyrical theme throughout the record. Each song {{was meant to be a}} [...] "standalone song" [...] about Bannon's life between this album and No Heroes. Bannon has said that he uses his lyrics and Converge to [...] "vent about <b>things</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> healthy way so I'm not a person that walks around with a lot of negative energy." [...] The opening track, [...] "Dark Horse," [...] was written about the passing of a close friend of Bannon, and how he died while trying to succeed as the [...] "underdog".|$|E
500|$|Brocklebank {{explained}} the dynamic {{between the two}} characters: Paul finds it [...] "extremely difficult" [...] {{to be in a}} secretive relationship because he wants different <b>things</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> relationship. When Paul does his drag act [...] "Thelma Louise" [...] in the local pub, he mentions that he is a secret relationship. This annoys Ivan and an argument ensues in the toilets. However, Paul has accidentally left his microphone on and Ivan is outed to the whole pub. Brocklebank said that Ivan feels [...] "upset and betrayed" [...] and [...] "deep down he knows he’s bisexual but isn’t sure if a relationship is going to work with Paul" [...] as he cannot conform to Paul's ideas about relationships.|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, Eva Spence {{credited}} {{on how the}} Astraea was a {{lot more}} positive than their previous material due to having time off between tours and being able to relax in the writing process. [...] "I feel happier than I {{have done in the past}} few years. I'm seeing <b>things</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> positive light and I hope the lyrics will be more uplifting" [...] In an interview with James Spence about the early writing process and how the lyrics have an essence of self-reflection as a common theme in the band's work, [...] "it's not something people normally look at or focus on; self-reflection as a theme, but if you ignore what's happening to you and how it's making you think about things then I don't think that's good." ...|$|E

500|$|S by Shakira Aquamarine was {{launched}} as a limited edition fragrance in early 2013.

The perfume bottle and the packaging follow a largely similar design to the original one but feature a [...] "metallic combination" [...] of gold and turquoise. The top notes include bergamot, mandarin orange, passion fruit chord and various ozonic substances; the heart notes capture the scents of different flowers like jasmine, plumeria, and tiaré; the base notes also consist of ozonic substances, as well as cedar wood. S by Shakira Aquamarine was made available in the following range: ...|$|E
500|$|Fonseca {{was drawn}} to Martinelli's [...] "funky personality", which {{differed}} from her much more serious previous role of Alexandra Udinov on Nikita. Fonseca and Atwell discussed keeping their characters as friends, rather than falling to [...] "jealousy or cattiness. There's nothing but just support and interest and friendship, {{because a lot of}} times it's more complicated than that on shows." [...] By July 2015, Fonseca was negotiating to return for the second season, and that December she was revealed to be returning for a dream sequence in [...] "A Little Song and Dance". Fazekas said that Angie's appearance in the sequence is her acting as Carter's conscience, [...] "speaking the things that Peggy maybe can’t say to herself. It ties things back together from the first season and it’s connecting all of these <b>things</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> way that only a dream can do." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{a chapter}} on teacher {{selection}} and training, the task of socializing students with obedience and discipline takes precedence over the task of teaching content. Students are under constant supervision to uphold a pledge to avoid outside activities such as theater, fashion, dances, and certain television shows. They also avoid some activities altogether, such as sexualized contact, drugs, alcohol, and smoking. This pledge is to be upheld at home as well, and {{students are encouraged to}} report errancies. Teachers too pledge to prioritize [...] "the pursuit of holiness" [...] over all <b>things</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> [...] "born again" [...] activity where they [...] "confess their sins and accept Jesus Christ as their personal savior". The school is unapologetic in its insistence on [...] "telling the kids what is right" [...] and its according preference for lecture over discussion. Teachers are also afforded the option of corporal punishment, though it is rarely used.|$|E
