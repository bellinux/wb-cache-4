5|$|After World War I, most battleships, {{dreadnought}} and pre-dreadnought alike, were disarmed {{under the}} terms of the Washington Naval Treaty. Largely this meant the ships being broken up for scrap; others were destroyed in <b>target</b> <b>practice</b> or relegated to training and supply duties. One, Mikasa, was given a special exemption to the Washington Treaty and was maintained as a museum and memorial ship.|$|E
5|$|After calling at Belfast Lough {{in early}} April, Samuel Huntington {{made her way}} to Liverpool to join Convoy ON 181 to New York. Departing on 30 April as one of 48 {{merchant}} ships in the convoy, the liberty ship made port at New York on 17 May. The convoy reported no submarine activity, and about two-thirds of the convoy were able to take <b>target</b> <b>practice</b> on icebergs during the voyage.|$|E
5|$|Arriving in Mexico on 20 March, {{the fleet}} {{underwent}} {{three weeks of}} <b>target</b> <b>practice.</b> Rear Admiral Evans was relieved of command during this time, as he was completely bedridden and in constant pain, so on 30 March, Connecticut set sail north at full speed.

5|$|Less {{successful}} at first were {{the efforts of}} the American battleships to match their British counterparts in excellence of gunnery. Having provided numerous veteran gun-crews to serve aboard armed merchantmen in the previous months, the gunnery complements of Division Nine were badly depleted and filled with inexperienced officers and recent recruits. The inevitable effect of this loss of talent became apparent when, on 17 December 1917, Battleship Division Nine conducted its first full-caliber <b>target</b> <b>practice</b> in nearby Pentland Firth.|$|E
5|$|The rifle had {{normally}} {{been used}} to shoot rabbits with the silencer and telescopic sight attached. The court heard that the telescopic sight {{had to be removed}} with a screwdriver, but it was usually left in place because it was time-consuming to realign it. Nevill's nephew visited the farmhouse on the weekend of 26–28 July 1985, and told the court that he had seen the rifle, in the gun cupboard in the ground-floor office, with the sight and silencer attached. He had taken the gun out and used it for <b>target</b> <b>practice.</b>|$|E
5|$|Following the Soviet {{capture of}} that city, the {{remaining}} crew detonated scuttling {{charges in the}} wreck on 21 March to further destroy the ship. After the war, the ship was raised during 1945–46 by the Soviet Navy and transferred to Tallinn. Although reference books long stated that she was scrapped there or in Marienburg, in actuality she was towed out in 1948 and beached for long-term use as a target in shallow water off the island of Osmussaar in the Gulf of Finland. Last used for <b>target</b> <b>practice</b> around 1966, the remains are now submerged.

5|$|Impero {{was laid}} down in May 1938 and {{launched}} in November 1939. The entrance of Italy into World War II forced the Regia Marina to refocus its construction priorities on escort warships, so Impero was left incomplete. After Italy surrendered to the Allies on 8 September 1943, {{the rest of the}} Italian Navy steamed to Sardinia to rendezvous with their American contemporaries. Still incomplete in Trieste, Impero was captured by the Germans, who used the hulk for <b>target</b> <b>practice.</b> Sunk by Allied bombers in February 1945, she was refloated in 1947 and scrapped in Venice from 1948 to 1950.|$|E
5|$|Kawachi {{rejoined the}} First Squadron after her refit {{commanded}} by Captain Yoshimoto Masaki and entered Tokuyama Bay {{on the evening}} of 11 July 1918. The following morning torpedo <b>target</b> <b>practice</b> was cancelled due to rough seas and the battleship remained at anchor {{for the rest of the}} day. That afternoon a loud explosion was heard at 15:51 in the vicinity of the starboard forward main-gun turret and large quantities of smoke erupted from the turret and between the first and second funnels. Two minutes later, she began to list to starboard and capsized at 15:55, only four minutes after the explosion. Over a thousand men were aboard Kawachi at the time of the explosion and over 600 were killed, with 433 survivors.|$|E
5|$|Missouri {{departed}} Piraeus on 26 April, touching at Algiers and Tangiers {{before arriving}} at Norfolk on 9 May.

5000|$|Israel says {{it takes}} {{precautions}} to avoid civilian casualties and collateral damage, making use if {{a variety of}} operational measures, including advance warnings and selective application of military force. Following the current conflict, U.S. military, General Martin Dempsey, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said that Israel went to [...] "extraordinary lengths" [...] to limit civilian casualties and collateral damage during its operation and that the Pentagon had sent a team to see what lessons could {{be learned from the}} operation. While a study into a Legal and operational assessment of Israel's <b>targeting</b> <b>practices,</b> found that Israeli <b>targeting</b> <b>practices</b> and positions on the application of the law of armed conflict (LOAC) are broadly within the mainstream of contemporary state practice, and their approach to targeting is consistent with the law and, in many cases, worthy of emulation. Example of advance warnings include phone messages and dropping leaflets, or by using the technique of roof knocking to warn citizens to evacuate their homes. However, this can also have the effect of worsening the humanitarian situation.|$|R
5|$|The year 1922 found Bridgeport {{continuing}} her {{service on}} the East Coast, mostly between Narragansett Bay and Hampton Roads, tending destroyers and assisting in destroyer <b>target</b> <b>practices</b> on the Southern Drill Grounds off the Virginia Capes.

Whipple and his men counted six hundred Mohave gathered near their camp, trading corn, beans, squash, and wheat for beads and calico. By {{the end of their}} commerce, the party had purchased six bushels of corn and two hundred pounds of flour. The Mohave played a traditional game played with a hoop and pole, and the two groups entertained themselves with <b>target</b> <b>practice,</b> the Mohave using bows and arrows and the whites firing pistols and rifles. When the expedition had difficulty crossing the Colorado on February 27, several Mohave jumped into the water and helped salvage the supplies.|$|E
5|$|The Domesday Book records ponies on Exmoor in 1086, and {{descendants}} of ponies {{removed from the}} moor in 1818 form the foundation bloodstock of today's Exmoor breed, although a breed society was not formed until 1921. The breed nearly became extinct after the Second World War, owing to soldiers using them for <b>target</b> <b>practice</b> and thieves killing them for their meat. After the war {{a small group of}} breeders worked to save the Exmoor, and during the 1950s ponies began to be exported to North America. The first stud book was published in 1963, and in 1981 publicity resulted in increased interest in the breed. As of 2010 there were an estimated 800 Exmoor ponies worldwide.|$|E
5|$|U-28 sank by {{accident}} on 17 March 1944, at the U-boat pier in Neustadt. During a training exercise, the boat had passed under a dummy freighter used for <b>target</b> <b>practice.</b> The commander-in-training failed {{to note the}} position of the stationary freighter, and the U-boat's conning tower was ripped off. Water flooded the control room, but the other compartments remained intact. The crew escaped by slowly equalizing the water pressure in the boat and swimming to the surface. The boat was raised in March 1944, but was stricken on 4 August. The submarine's crew suffered no casualties during her career.|$|E
40|$|This chapter {{examines}} the policy implications of behavioural sciences insights for {{the regulation of}} privacy on the Internet, by focusing in particular on behavioural targeting.

5|$|Wild Guns is a {{shooting}} gallery game with an American Wild West setting along with sci-fi and steampunk influences. The gameplay combines elements from third-person shooters and light gun {{games in a}} similar fashion to Blood Bros. and Cabal. There are six levels, each with two stages, followed by a mini-boss, and a third stage with a final boss. Single player and cooperative modes are available, as well as <b>target</b> <b>practice</b> allowing two players to compete to achieve the highest score. The story follows a young woman named Annie seeking revenge against the Kid family for abducting and killing her family. She seeks help from renowned space bounty hunter Clint. Although Clint says he doesn't need Annie's assistance, she insists, claiming she has a personal vendetta against the Kid family and is a skilled shooter.|$|E
5|$|Besides the patrols {{made during}} this {{deployment}} in northwestern waters, Yorktown conducted routine operations such as target practices. Among the officers {{assigned to the}} ship {{at that time was}} Lt. Bradley Fiske, a young officer who had invented and constructed a practical telescopic gunsight. Fiske's sight had been tested in Baltimore and had favorably impressed that ship's officers—including her commander, Captain Winfeld S. Schley. Evans, however, had not taken a liking to Fiske's newfangled gadget but nevertheless consented to allow a second test on board Yorktown (the first one had failed miserably). On the afternoon of 22 September 1892, during scheduled <b>target</b> <b>practice,</b> Fiske's invention worked as designed and elicited praise from Evans. As Fiske himself later wrote in the United States Naval Institute's magazine Proceedings, modern naval gunnery had its birth not in the British Navy but in the American—off Unalaska on 22 September 1892, in Yorktown.|$|E
5|$|During {{her second}} commission, Indiana {{spent most of}} her time laid up in the reserve fleet, {{occasionally}} participating in practice cruises. In January 1907 she helped provide relief {{in the aftermath of the}} 1907 Kingston earthquake. In 1908, the /40 caliber guns and most of the lighter guns were removed to compensate for the counterweights added to the main battery turrets and because the ammunition supply for the guns was considered problematic. A year later, twelve /50 caliber single-purpose guns were added midships and in the fighting tops. At the same time a cage mast was added. By 1913 it was speculated that the ship might soon be used for <b>target</b> <b>practice,</b> but instead, the ship was decommissioned on 23 May 1914. After the United States entered World War I, Indiana was commissioned for the third time and served as a training ship for gun crews near Tompkinsville, Staten Island and in the York River, and placed under the command of George Landenberger.|$|E
