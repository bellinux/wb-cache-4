5|$|The Satanic Bible is {{composed}} of four books: <b>The</b> <b>Book</b> of Satan, <b>The</b> <b>Book</b> of Lucifer, <b>The</b> <b>Book</b> of Belial, and <b>The</b> <b>Book</b> of Leviathan. <b>The</b> <b>Book</b> of Satan challenges the Ten Commandments and the Golden Rule, and promotes Epicureanism. <b>The</b> <b>Book</b> of Lucifer holds most of the philosophy in The Satanic Bible, with twelve chapters discussing topics such as indulgence, love, hate, and sex. LaVey also uses <b>the</b> <b>book</b> to dispel rumors surrounding the religion. In <b>The</b> <b>Book</b> of Belial, LaVey details rituals and magic. He discusses the required mindset and focus for performing a ritual, and provides instructions for three rituals: those for sex, compassion, or destruction. <b>The</b> <b>Book</b> of Leviathan provides four invocations for Satan, lust, compassion, and destruction. It also lists the nineteen Enochian Keys (adapted from John Dee's Enochian keys), provided in both Enochian and translated to English.|$|E

5|$|Although {{she was a}} {{previously}} published novelist and had a successful Broadway play, Rand had difficulty finding a publisher for The Fountainhead.

5|$|At least 20 {{publishers}} rejected <b>the</b> <b>book</b> before Geisel {{ran into}} an old college classmate, who had just become juvenile editor at Vanguard Press.

Geisel returned to fictionalized versions of Springfield in later books, and Marco appeared again in 1947 in the Dr. Seuss book McElligot's Pool.|$|E
