Now, one of you stand by to ease off the guy handsomely, and the rest come aft to the main-sheet. Look out for yourself, Mr. Drewett; {{we are about to}} haul in the boom, when it will be a small matter to get you in, upon the taffrail. Stand by to luff handsomely, so as to keep the boom as steady as possible." ...|$|E
60|$|Smoke {{felt the}} rope <b>tauten</b> in a futile effort, then the pace quickened, {{and as he}} went past his {{previous}} lodgment and over the bulge the last glimpse he caught of Carson he was turned over, with madly moving hands and feet striving to overcome the downward draw. To Smoke's surprise, as he went over the bulge, there was no sheer fall. The rope restrained him as he slid down a steeper pitch, which quickly eased until {{he came to a}} halt in another niche on the verge of another bulge. Carson was now out of sight, ensconced in the place previously occupied by Smoke.|$|E
6000|$|He {{made another}} trial and failed. Once more he was astonished; once more he was humiliated--and {{as for his}} anger, it rose to summer-heat. He {{arranged}} the balls again, grouping them carefully, {{and said he would}} win this time, or die. When a client reaches this condition, it {{is a good time to}} damage his nerve further, and this can always be done by saying some little mocking thing or other that has the outside appearance of a friendly remark--so I employed this art. I suggested that a bet might <b>tauten</b> his nerves, and that I would offer one, but that as I did not want it to be an expense to him, but only a help, I would make it small--a cigar, if he were willing--a cigar that he would fail again; not an expensive one, but a cheap native one, of the Crown Jewel breed, such as is manufactured in Hartford for the clergy. It set him afire all over! I could see the blue flame issue from his eyes. He said, ...|$|E
50|$|It {{was used}} as the {{covering}} for the de Havilland Mosquito a pioneer of wooden monocoque airframe construction in military aircraft, as well as in other aircraft, where it was <b>tautened</b> and stiffened with aircraft dope.|$|R
60|$|He stood {{upon the}} chairs, squatted, and bent his {{shoulders}} down till his hands {{closed on the}} rope. He shifted his feet slightly, <b>tautened</b> his muscles with a tentative pull, then relaxed again, questing for a perfect adjustment of all the levers of his body.|$|R
60|$|Daylight's muscles <b>tautened</b> {{a second}} time, {{and this time}} in earnest, until {{steadily}} all the energy of his splendid body was applied, and quite imperceptibly, without jerk or strain, the bulky nine hundred pounds rose from the door and swung back and forth, pendulum like, between his legs.|$|R
5000|$|Neither Irenaeus nor Origen {{indicates}} that he knew anything as {{to the meaning of}} this word; and we have no better information on this subject than a conjecture of Epiphanius (Epiph. Haer. xxv. 48). He says that the word means [...] "wanton" [...] or [...] "lascivious," [...] for that the Greeks had a phrase concerning a man who had debauched a girl, Eprounikeuse <b>tautēn.</b> One feels some hesitation in accepting this explanation. Epiphanius was deeply persuaded of the filthiness of Gnostic morals, and habitually put the worst interpretation on their language. If the phrase reported by Epiphanius had been common, it is strange that instances of its use should not have been quoted from the Greek comic writers. It need not be denied that Epiphanius had heard the phrase employed, but innocent words come to be used in an obscene sense, as well by those who think double entendre witty, as by those who modestly avoid the use of plainer language. The primary meaning of the word prouneikos seems to be a porter, or bearer of burdens, the derivation being from enenkein, the only derivation indeed that the word seems to admit of. Then, modifying its meaning like the word agoraios, it came {{to be used in the}} sense of a turbulent violent person. The only distinct confirmation of the explanation of Epiphanius is that Hesychius (s. v. Skitaloi) has the words aphrodisiōn kai tēs prounikias tēs nykterinēs. This would be decisive, if we could be sure that these words were earlier in date than Epiphanius.|$|E
60|$|The whistle shrieked again, {{the warp}} <b>tautened,</b> and tug and {{lifeboat}} {{made for the}} mouth of the harbour. As they passed out an inspiring cheer was given by the crowd, and a rocket streamed up from the pier-head to signal the lightship that assistance was on the way.|$|R
6000|$|Our rope had <b>tautened</b> {{over the}} coping {{of a high}} stone wall; and the {{straining}} Lunardi--a very large and handsome blossom, bending on a very thin stalk--overhung a gravelled yard; and lo! from the centre of it stared up at us, rigid with amazement, the faces of a squad of British red-coats! ...|$|R
60|$|Many times, in {{the course}} of the day, alertly and nonchalantly, almost with a quizzical knowingness, Jerry cocked his head at the {{mainsail}} when it made sudden swooping movements or slacked and <b>tautened</b> its crashing sheet-gear. But he no longer crouched to spring for it. That had been the first lesson, and quickly mastered.|$|R
5000|$|It is {{inserted}} {{between the two}} layers of the iliotibial band of the fascia lata about the junction of {{the middle and upper}} thirds of the thigh. The tensor fasciae latae <b>tautens</b> the iliotibial band and braces the knee, especially when the opposite foot is lifted. [...] The terminal insertion point lies on the lateral condyle of the tibia.|$|R
60|$|The tree, {{deeper in}} the water, was {{travelling}} faster, and the painter <b>tautened</b> as the boat took the tow. Then, with a last giddy look around, wherein he saw the banks tilting and swaying and the sun swinging in pendulum-sweep across the sky, Daylight wrapped himself in his rabbit-skin robe, lay down in the bottom, and fell asleep.|$|R

Eight women are {{standing}} around {{a piece of}} <b>tautened</b> skin. They are barefooted and dressed in dark cloths and shawls.

40|$|Three {{cases of}} severe mitral {{incompetence}} after heterograft aortic valve replacement are described. In all cases an early third heart sound was recorded on the phonocardiograms. In two cases a prominent early diastolic peak was also recorded on the apex cardiograms. These findings {{do not support}} the widely held view that the third heart sound is produced by sudden <b>tautening</b> of the mitral valve structures during the rapid filling phase of the left ventricle...|$|R
60|$|He put {{the wheel}} hard over, and the yacht whirled around obediently. The main-sheet slacked and dipped, then shot {{over our heads}} after the boom and <b>tautened</b> with a crash on the traveller. The yacht heeled over almost on her beam ends, and a great wail went up from the seasick {{passengers}} as they swept across the cabin floor in a tangled mass and piled into a heap in the starboard bunks.|$|R
60|$|The skiff was towing {{with too}} long a painter, and was {{behaving}} very badly. Every {{once in a}} while it would hold back till the tow-rope <b>tautened,</b> then come leaping ahead and sheering and dropping slack till it threatened to shove its nose under the huge whitecaps which roared so hungrily on every hand. Joe climbed over the cockpit-rail to the slippery after-deck, and {{made his way to the}} bitt to which the skiff was fastened.|$|R
60|$|The aërial {{battle was}} over, and Thomas Mugridge, whining and gibbering, his mouth flecked with bloody foam, was brought down to deck. Wolf Larsen rove a bowline {{in a piece}} of rope and slipped it under his shoulders. Then he was carried aft and flung into the sea. Forty,—fifty,—sixty feet of line ran out, when Wolf Larsen cried “Belay!” Oofty-Oofty took a turn on a bitt, the rope <b>tautened,</b> and the Ghost, lunging onward, jerked the cook to the surface.|$|R
60|$|She drew {{away from}} him and sat upon the bed, dark eyes questioning, suspicious. Yet she seemed fascinated. Pan caught a slight quivering of her frame. Where was the audacity, the boldness of this girl? But he did not know her, and he had her word that drink alone enabled her to carry on. He had {{surprised}} her. Yet could that account for something different, something quite beyond his power to grasp? Surely this girl could not fear him. Suddenly he remembered that Hardman had fled to this house--was hidden there now. Pan's nerves <b>tautened.</b>|$|R
60|$|Then {{the wind}} struck us. The main-sheet <b>tautened</b> with a brisk {{rattling}} of the blocks, the boom uplifted, the sail bellied out, and the Reindeer heeled over--over, and over, till the lee-rail went under, the cabin windows went under, and the bay began to pour {{in over the}} cockpit rail. So violently had she heeled over, that {{the men in the}} cabin had been thrown {{on top of one another}} into the lee bunk, where they squirmed and twisted and were washed about, those underneath being perilously near to drowning.|$|R
25|$|President Hoovers crew {{prepared}} to evacuate passengers. In {{order to keep}} boats on course between the ship and the shore in the monsoon wind, they put a wire cable ashore and <b>tautened</b> it with a winch aboard ship. In each boat two crewmen wearing strong gloves, one each in the bow and the stern, would slide their hands along the cable to guide boats from ship to shore. Some passengers alleged that President Hoovers crew were inexperienced, and that when {{trying to get the}} wire cable ashore to prepare for the evacuation they capsized two of the lifeboats in shallow water.|$|R
40|$|AasrRxcr: The general {{principles}} in coring with open barrel gravity corers are briefly discussed, and a gravity corer with a new, simple and efficient valve system is described. The coring tubes are rectangular and specially designed for scanning of the cores by x-radiography before extrusion. The closing {{mechanism of the}} valve system works in two steps: the valve is held in open position one when the lowering wire is taut, in open position two when the wire slackens and the corer penetrates the sediment, and closes automatically after sediment penetration when the wire <b>tautens</b> at the upheaval...|$|R

50|$|When {{the central}} nervous system sends out signals to alpha neurons to fire, signals are also sent to gamma motor neurons to do the same. This process {{maintains}} the tautness of muscle spindles and is called alpha gamma co-activation. The nuclei of spindle muscle cells are located in the middle of these spindles, but unlike extrafusal muscle fibers, the myofibril contractile apparati of spindle fibers are located only at both ends of spindle. Afferent stimulation of the spindle by gamma motor neurons contracts the myofibrils, <b>tautening</b> the central region of spindle -- which maintains its sensitivity to gamma motoneuron stimulation.|$|R
60|$|A breeze was coming. The {{ship that}} had been lying tide-rode swung to a heavier puff; and {{suddenly}} the slack of the chain cable between the windlass and the hawse-pipe clinked, slipped forward an inch, and rose gently off the deck with a startling suggestion as of unsuspected life {{that had been}} lurking stealthily in the iron. In the hawse-pipe the grinding links sent through the ship {{a sound like a}} low groan of a man sighing under a burden. The strain came on the windlass, the chain <b>tautened</b> like a string, vibrated--and the handle of the screw-brake moved in slight jerks. Singleton stepped forward.|$|R
60|$|His crew sullenly tailed {{on to the}} halyards, and the strange, outlandish sail, lateen in rig and dyed a warm brown, rose in the air. We were sailing on the wind, {{and when}} Yellow Handkerchief {{flattened}} down the sheet the junk forged ahead and the tow-line went slack. Fast as the Reindeer could sail, the junk outsailed her; and to avoid running her down I hauled a little closer on the wind. But the junk likewise outpointed, and {{in a couple of}} minutes I was abreast of the Reindeer and to windward. The tow-line had now <b>tautened,</b> at right angles to the two boats, and the predicament was laughable.|$|R
60|$|Now he held {{a single}} coil of the long rope in his right hand, and the balance in his left. The {{antelope}} was but a few paces from him. Silently Korak leaped from his hiding place swinging the rope free from the entangling shrubbery. The antelope sprang away almost instantly; but instantly, too, the coiled rope, with its sliding noose, flew through the air above him. With unerring precision it settled about the creature's neck. There was a quick wrist movement of the thrower, the noose tightened. The Killer braced himself with the rope across his hip, and as the antelope <b>tautened</b> the singing strands in a last frantic bound for liberty he was thrown over upon his back.|$|R
6000|$|As {{soon as this}} feat was accomplished, and it {{was done}} with {{sufficient}} readiness, though somewhat lubberly, twenty or thirty of the savages clapped on the warp, until they had <b>tautened</b> it to as great a strain as it would bear. After this they ceased pulling, and I observed a search around the galley in quest of the cook's axe, evidently with a design to cut the cables. I thought this a fact worth communicating to Marble, and I resolved to do so {{at the risk of}} my life. [...] "The Indians have run a line to the island, and are about to cut the cables, no doubt intending to warp the ship ashore; and that, too, at the very spot where they once had the Sea-Otter." ...|$|R
40|$|The initial low {{frequency}} {{component of the}} first heart sound, 'M', has been studied in normal subjects, and in patients with vario-s prosthetic mitral valves and with mitral stenosis, using simultaneous {{low frequency}} phonocardiography, echocardiography, and apex cardiography. The techniques showed 'M' to have a constant morphology in preisovolumic systole. In mitral stenosis, 'M' and the preisovolumic 'presystolic' murmur {{appear to be the}} same phonocardiographic phenomenon. While 'M' was present in sinus rhythm, augmentation of this normal vibration occurred particularly during the short cycles of atrial fibrillation. Leaflet coaption and movement of the ventricular wall as detected echocardiographically do not appear {{to play a role in}} its pathogenesis but the sound could emanate from the ventricular wall as it <b>tautens</b> and decreases its compliance at the onset of systole...|$|R
6000|$|The wind, {{as we have}} said, was light, {{so light}} {{that it did not}} distend the sails; the boom of the spanker-sail hung over the stern, and the spanker-braces lay slack along the seat on which Ailie and the doctor knelt. A little gust of wind came: it was not strong--a mere puff; but the man at the wheel was not {{attending}} to his duty: the puff, light as it was, caused the spanker to jibe--that is to fly over {{from one side of the}} ship to the other--the heavy boom passed close over the steersman's head as he cried, [...] "Look out!" [...] The braces <b>tautened,</b> and in so doing they hurled Dr Hopley violently to the deck, and tossed Ailie Dunning over the bulwarks into the sea.|$|R
2500|$|The Old Glory {{was first}} {{published}} by Farrar, Straus, and Giroux in 1965. A revised edition was published with minor changes in 1968. This edition included an introduction by Robert Brustein and a director's note by Jonathan Miller. Brustein called The Old Glory [...] "a dramatic history of the American character," [...] adding [...] "Mr. Lowell feels the past working in his very bones[...] [...]Adopting a style which is purposely chilling, measured, and remote, he has endowed his plays with flinty intelligence and <b>tautened</b> passion, making them work on the spectator with all the suggestive power of non-discursive poems." [...] Before the book's title page, Lowell officially noted, [...] "My sources have been Nathaniel Hawthorne's stories and sketches, Endecott and the Red Cross, The Maypole of Merry Mount, and My Kinsman, Major Molineux; Thomas Morton's New Canaan; and Herman Melville's Benito Cereno." ...|$|R
50|$|Traditional {{covering}} methods use organic materials, such as cotton. Once {{the aircraft}} structure is prepared by sanding {{the material is}} applied using dope as an adhesive. Rib-stitching is used on faster aircraft types and especially on undercambered airfoils {{to ensure that the}} fabric follows the aircraft structure. The distance between stitches is reduced in areas affected by the propeller wash. The covering would then be treated with <b>tautening</b> dope to remove wrinkles and increase structural strength, finish coats often containing aluminium powder would serve to protect the surface from ultra-violet light. Large fabric panels of the World War I era aircraft were often laced together through eyelets to ease access to the internal structure for maintenance. Some disadvantages compared to modern methods are the relatively short service life of the covering due to biological effects such as mildew and the labour required to achieve the end result.|$|R
60|$|As the {{clinging}} things {{upon his}} feet and face resisted his every effort to dislodge them, Numa became frantic. He rolled upon the ground, fighting, biting, scratching, and roaring; he leaped to {{his feet and}} sprang into the air; he charged Tarzan, only to be brought to a sudden stop as the rope securing him to the tree <b>tautened.</b> Then Tarzan stepped in and rapped him smartly on the head with the shaft of his spear. Numa reared upon his hind feet and struck at the are-man and in return received a cuff on one ear that sent him reeling sideways. When he returned to the attack he was again sent sprawling. After the fourth effort it appeared to dawn upon the king of beasts that he had met his master, his head and tail dropped and when Tarzan advanced upon him he backed away, though still growling.|$|R
5000|$|The Denis d’or was {{reported}} to have 14 registers, most of which were twofold, and its complex mechanism fitted in a symmetrical wooden cabinet equipped with a keyboard and a pedal. It was about 150 cm long, 90 cm wide, and 120 cm high. Basically, it was a chordophone not unlike a clavichord [...] - [...] in other words, the strings were struck, not plucked. The suspension and the <b>tautening</b> of the allegedly 790 metal strings was described as more elaborate than a clavichord. The mechanism which had been worked out by Diviš was such that the Denis d’or could imitate the sounds of a variety of other instruments, including chordophones such as harpsichords, harps, lutes and wind instruments. This was mainly owing to the responsiveness and combinability of the stops, which permitted the player to vary the sound in multiple ways, thereby generating far more than a hundred different tonal voices altogether.|$|R
60|$|Again {{he shook}} his head. This was his ordeal, to sit, nerveless and insecure, {{on the brink of}} the precipice. But Hazard, lying safely in his crevice, now had to face his own ordeal, but one of a {{different}} nature. When Gus began to slide--as he soon must--would he, Hazard, be able to take in the slack and then meet the shock as the other <b>tautened</b> the rope and darted toward the plunge? It seemed doubtful. And there he lay, apparently safe, but in reality harnessed to death. Then rose the temptation. Why not cast off the rope about his waist? He would be safe at all events. It was a simple way out of the difficulty. There was no need that two should perish. But it was impossible for such temptation to overcome his pride of race, and his own pride in himself and in his honor. So the rope remained about him.|$|R
60|$|And as we {{laid out}} on the next tack to wind-ward, I bent a piece of line to a small {{grappling}} hook I had seen lying in the bail-hole. The end of the line I made fast to the ring-bolt in the bow, and with the hook out of sight I waited for the next opportunity to use it. Once more they made their leeward pull down the port side of the Lancashire Queen, and once more we churned down after them before the wind. Nearer and nearer we drew, and I was making believe to reach for them as before. The stern of the skiff was not six feet away, and they were laughing at me derisively as they ducked under the ship's stern. At that instant I suddenly arose and threw the grappling iron. It caught fairly and squarely on the rail of the skiff, which was jerked backward out of safety as the rope <b>tautened</b> and the salmon boat ploughed on.|$|R
60|$|It {{is a funny}} thing, this hanging of a man. I {{have never}} seen a hanging, but I have been told by eye-witnesses the details of a dozen hangings so that I know what will happen to me. Standing on the trap, leg-manacled and arm-manacled, the knot against the neck, the black cap drawn, they will drop me down until the {{momentum}} of my descending weight is fetched up abruptly short by the <b>tautening</b> of the rope. Then the doctors will group around me, and one will relieve another in successive turns in standing on a stool, his arms passed around me to keep me from swinging like a pendulum, his ear pressed close to my chest, while he counts my fading heart-beats. Sometimes twenty minutes elapse after the trap is sprung ere the heart stops beating. Oh, trust me, they make most scientifically sure that a man is dead once they get him on a rope.|$|R
