5|$|Beginning in 1524, Bucer {{concentrated}} on <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>issue</b> dividing leading reformers, the eucharist. In this dispute, {{he attempted to}} mediate between Martin Luther and Huldrych Zwingli. The two theologians disagreed on whether the body and blood of Christ were physically present within the elements of bread and wine during {{the celebration of the}} Lord's Supper. Luther believed in a corporeal or physical real presence of Christ; and Zwingli believed Christ's body and blood where made present by the Holy Spirit. By late 1524, Bucer had abandoned the idea of corporeal real presence and, after some exegetical studies, accepted Zwingli's interpretation. However, he did not believe the Reformation depended on either position but on faith in Christ, other matters being secondary. In this respect he differed from Zwingli.|$|E

5|$|The Yorkshire {{captaincy}} {{affair of}} 1927 arose from a disagreement {{among members of}} Yorkshire County Cricket Club over {{the selection of a}} new captain to succeed the retired Major Arthur Lupton. <b>The</b> <b>main</b> <b>issue</b> was whether a professional cricketer should be appointed to the post. It was a tradition throughout English county cricket that captains should always be amateurs. At Yorkshire, a succession of amateur captains held office in the 1920s, on the grounds of their supposed leadership qualities, although they were not worth their place in the team as cricketers. None lasted long; after Lupton's departure some members felt it was time to appoint a more accomplished cricketer on a long-term basis.|$|E
5|$|Weaver {{believed}} that the Populists' embrace of free silver would be <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>issue</b> to attract new members to the party. After the election, he attended {{a meeting of the}} American Bimetallic League, a pro-silver group, and gave speeches advocating an inflationist monetary policy. In the meantime, the Panic of 1893 caused bank failures, factory closures, and general economic upheaval. As the federal gold reserves dwindled, President Cleveland convinced Congress to repeal the Sherman Silver Purchase Act, which ensured the government would purchase less silver for coining and which further disconcerted free silver supporters. While depletion of gold reserves slowed after the repeal, the country's economy still floundered.|$|E
