50|$|Because {{the vast}} {{majority}} of this research has been done on animals—and the majority of that on rodents—these findings must be taken with caution when applied to humans. One of the few studies that looked at the influence of hormones on human bonding compared participants who had recently fallen in love with a control group. There were no differences for most of the hormones measured, including LH, estradiol, progesterone, DHEAS, and androstenedione. Testosterone and FSH were lower in men who had recently fallen in love, and there was also a difference in blood cortisol for both sexes, with higher levels in the group that was in love. These differences disappeared after 12-28 months and may reflect the <b>temporary</b> <b>stress</b> and arousal of a new relationship.|$|E

40|$|Under stress conditions, {{obtained}} in the field or experimentally induced, changes occur in the nature and intensity of affective processes (emotions, motivations). Symmetrical changes occur under opposite (comfort) conditions. One of the first procedures for determining <b>temporary</b> <b>stress</b> states consists of administering difficult logical tasks (15 minutes), with erroneous or ambiguous feedback and social pressure. For example, some very difficult Raven Matrices were individually assigned to participants. The first two authors later found another procedure equally effective and even more advantageous for certain aspects: the "drawing recollection" of personal stressful experiences. The corresponding comfort treatments are, firstly, a progressive relaxation session in penumbra; or, in the second case, the "drawing recollection" of personal pleasant and positive experiences. To assess the emotional changes, we prepared seven-point bipolar scales centering on the main opposing emotions. As regards motivations, we used a list of nine motivational systems [1]. The whole set of items made up the so-called Self-Appraisal Scales, administered before and after a specific treatment, thereby obtaining a measure through {{the differences between the}} two successive assessments.

40|$|This study aims {{to examine}} (a) {{the time course of}} stress, fatigue, and sleep quality among PhD {{students}} awaiting a stressful event and (b) whether daily anticipation of this event influences day-level stress, fatigue, and sleep quality. Forty-four PhD students completed evening and morning questionnaires on eight days from 1 &#x 00 A 0;month before their dissertation defense until one month thereafter. Results showed increased stress leading up to the defense, while fatigue and sleep quality remained unchanged. Comparing the night before the defense with the night after, stress rapidly decreased, whereas fatigue and sleep quality increased. Following the defense, stress and sleep quality remained stable, whereas fatigue declined. Stress 1 &#x 00 A 0;month before the defense was higher than 1 &#x 00 A 0;month thereafter. Regarding day-level relations, stress was adversely affected by negative anticipation and favorably by positive outcome expectancy, whereas positive anticipation had no influence. Positive outcome expectancy was an important predictor of improved sleep quality. We conclude that stress may be elevated long before a stressful event takes place but that one can recover rather quickly from <b>temporary</b> <b>stress.</b> Positive outcome expectancy of a stressful event may be an important predictor of reduced day-level stress and improved day-level sleep quality leading up to a stressful event...|$|E

30|$|Tree {{growth stress}} {{refers to the}} {{mechanical}} stress permanently supported by wood in a living tree during tree growth. It results from the combined action of two mechanisms, i.e., cell wall maturation and the increase of dead weight [1]. The following scenario is commonly admitted to explain the contribution of maturation—here, the term “maturation” refers to the latest stage of cell wall formation, from the completion of polysaccharides deposition until cell death, and includes lignification. During secondary-wall maturation, the newly differentiated xylem fiber tends to deform in its axial and transverse directions. These dimensional changes are restricted by the already-formed xylem. The restraint induces a mechanical stress, or the so-called “maturation stress”, at the outermost surface of the secondary xylem, located beneath the layer of differentiating xylem. It provokes, in the older xylem, during each growth increment, a counteractive stress distribution which is superimposed on the pre-existing stress. In addition, the increasing tree weight {{is supported by the}} older part of the stem (this term is used in this paper in the botanical sense, referring either to trunk or branch). As a result, each stage of growth produces an additional stress distribution balancing the effect of gravity. A complex distribution of mechanical stress, called “growth stress”, is thus installed in the living stem. Growth stress does not include, in its definition, the effect of non-permanent loads, such as wind or snow, that impose <b>temporary</b> <b>stress</b> modification only. Growth stress measured at the outermost xylem surface, the “surface growth stress”, is {{more or less the same}} as the maturation stress.|$|E
40|$|A {{model of}} an elastic {{manifold}} driven through a random medium by an applied force F is studied focussing {{on the effects}} of inertia and elastic waves, in particular stress overshoots in which motion of one segment of the manifold causes a <b>temporary</b> <b>stress</b> on its neighboring segments in addition to the static stress. Such stress overshoots decrease the critical force for depinning and make the depinning transition hysteretic. We find that the steady state velocity of the moving phase is nevertheless history independent and the critical behavior as the force is decreased is in the same universality class as in the absence of stress overshoots: the dissipative limit which has been studied analytically. To reach this conclusion, finite-size scaling analyses of a variety of quantities have been supplemented by heuristic arguments. If the force is increased slowly from zero, the spectrum of avalanche sizes that occurs appears to be quite different from the dissipative limit. After stopping from the moving phase, the restarting involves both fractal and bubble-like nucleation. Hysteresis loops can be understood in terms of a depletion layer caused by the stress overshoots, but surprisingly, in the limit of very large samples the hysteresis loops vanish. We argue that, although there can be striking differences over a wide range of length scales, the universality class governing this pseudohysteresis is again that of the dissipative limit. Consequences of this picture for the statistics and dynamics of earthquakes on geological faults are briefly discussed.

40|$|Abstract Nutrition {{research}} {{is struggling to}} demonstrate beneficial health effects, since nutritional effects are often subtle and long term. Health has been redefined as the ability of our body to cope with daily-life challenges. Physiology acts as a well-orchestrated machinery {{to adapt to the}} continuously changing environment. We term this adaptive capacity ‘‘phenotypic flexibility. ’ ’ The phenotypic flexibility concept implies that health can be measured by the ability to adapt to conditions of <b>temporary</b> <b>stress,</b> such as physical exercise, infections or mental stress, in a healthy manner. This may offer a more sensitive way to assess changes in health status of healthy subjects. Here, we performed a systematic review of 61 studies applying different nutritional stress tests to quantify health and nu-tritional health effects, with the objective to define an op-timal nutritional stress test that {{has the potential to be}} adopted as the golden standard in nutrition research. To acknowledge the multi-target role of nutrition, a relevant subset of 50 processes that govern optimal health, with high relevance to diet, was used to define phenotypic flexibility. Subsequently, we assessed the response of biomarkers related to this subset of processes to the dif-ferent challenge tests. Based on the obtained insights, we propose a nutritional stress test composed of a high-fat, high-caloric drink, containing 60 g palm olein, 75 g glu-cose and 20 g dairy protein in a total volume of 400 ml. The use of such a standardized nutritional challenge test in intervention studies is expected to demonstrate subtle im-provements of phenotypic flexibility, thereby enabling substantiation of nutritional health effects...|$|E

40|$|Positive {{identification}} of small fatigue cracks presents a challenging problem during nondestructive testing of fatigue damaged structures. First, {{it is important}} to distinguish fatigue cracks from primary geometrical features (e. g., nearby holes, corners, and edges) and secondary irregularities (e. g., uneven machining, mechanical wear, corrosion, etc.). Second, {{it is important to}} distinguish small fatigue cracks as early as possible after crack nucleation from intrinsic material inhomogeneities such as coarse grains, anomalous microstructure, second phases, precipitates, porosity, various types of reinforcement, etc. Generally, linear acoustic characteristics (attenuation, velocity, backscattering, etc.) are not sufficiently sensitive to very small fatigue cracks. On the other hand, in a great variety of structural materials even very small fatigue damage can produce very significant excess nonlinearity, which can be orders of magnitude higher than the intrinsic nonlinearity of the intact material [1]. The excess nonlinearity is produced by the strong local nonlinearity of a microcrack whose opening is smaller than the particle displacement. Perhaps the simplest way to observe crack-closure under laboratory conditions is to ultrasonically monitor the opening and closing of fatigue cracks when subjecting the specimen to static or quasi-static external loading. The technical realization of the acousto-elastic method must incorporate two tasks. One is to find an effective way to generate crack-closure in the specimen, i. e., the “elastic” problem. The other is {{to find a way to}} monitor the resulting parametric modulation by ultrasonic means, i. e., the “acoustic” problem. The modulation stress may be generated through different ways such as external cyclic loading in a typical fatigue test [1] or exploiting the inherent vibration of the structure itself during operation [2]. The main disadvantage of using external mechanical loading is that usually the whole structure must be loaded, which requires very substantial forces and might cause additional damage in certain parts of the structure. More localized <b>temporary</b> <b>stresses</b> can be produced by simply cooling or warming the specimen to be tested [3]...|$|R

An 8 -day sucrose treatment following <b>temporary</b> water <b>stress</b> improved the quality of flowers and reduced the level of ABA in the petals. We conclude that the effect which sucrose has on the ABA content of rose petals is at least partly due to its effect on changes in water deficit in the petals.

Data were collected from 15 seismological broad band stations, deployed above flat subduction section and also above the transitional to normal section of the Nazca plate. Seismic events were located mostly in part of the Southern Precordillera and Cerrilladas Pedemontanas of Mendoza Province. Focal mechanism solutions were obtained, for selected data between 15 kmand 35 kmdepths, from P wave first motion using FOCMEC software. A band trending NW-NNW of normal focal mechanism earthquakes is located just by the thrust front towards West, and covers the Southern tip of the Southern Precordillera and the Western side of the Cerrilladas Pedemontanas, Mendoza Province, Argentina.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Assisted {{migration}} or translocation {{of species}} to ameliorate effects of habitat loss or changing environment is currently under scrutiny as a conservation tool. A large scale experiment of assisted migration {{over hundreds of}} kilometres was tested on a morph from a commercial fishery of southern rock lobster Jasus edwardsii, to enhance depleted populations, improve the yield and sustainability of the fishery, and test resilience to a changing climate. METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Approximately 10, 000 lower-valued, pale-coloured lobsters were moved from deep water to inshore sites (2 in Tasmania [TAS] and 2 in South Australia [SA]) where the high-value, red morph occurs. In TAS this was a northwards movement of 1 ° latitude. Growth was measured only in TAS lobsters, and reproductive status was recorded in lobsters from all locations. Pale females (TAS) grew 4 times faster than resident pale lobsters from the original site and {{twice as fast as}} red lobsters at their new location. Approximately 30 % of translocated pale lobsters deferred reproduction for one year after release (SA and TAS), and grew around 1 mm yr(- 1) less compared to translocated pale lobsters that did not defer reproduction. In spite of this stress response to translocation, females that deferred reproduction still grew 2 - 6 mm yr(- 1) more than lobsters at the source site. Lobsters have isometric growth whereby volume increases as a cube of length. Consequently despite the one-year hiatus in reproduction, increased growth increases fecundity of translocated lobsters, as the increase in size provided a larger volume for producing and incubating eggs in future years. CONCLUSIONS AND SIGNIFICANCE: Assisted migration improved egg production and growth, despite a <b>temporary</b> <b>stress</b> response, and offers a tool to improve the production, sustainability and resilience of the fishery...|$|E

40|$|Although {{alternating}} run/walk-periods {{are often}} recommended to novice runners, it is unclear, if this particular pacing strategy reduces the cardiovascular stress during prolonged exercise. Therefore, {{the aim of}} the study was to compare the effects of two different running strategies on selected cardiac biomarkers as well as marathon performance.; Randomized experimental trial in a repeated measure design.; Male (n= 22) and female subjects (n= 20) completed a marathon either with a run/walk strategy or running only. Immediately after crossing the finishing line cardiac biomarkers were assessed in blood taken from the cubital vein. Before (- 7 days) and after the marathon (+ 4 days) subjects also completed an incremental treadmill test.; Despite different pacing strategies, run/walk strategy and running only finished the marathon with similar times (04 : 14 : 25 ± 00 : 19 : 51 vs 04 : 07 : 40 ± 00 : 27 : 15 [hh:mm:ss]; p= 0. 377). In both groups, prolonged exercise led to increased B-type natriuretic peptide, creatine kinase MB isoenzyme and myoglobin levels (p< 0. 001), which returned to baseline 4 days after the marathon. Elevated cTnI concentrations were observable in only two subjects. B-type natriuretic peptide (r=- 0. 363; p= 0. 041) and myoglobin levels (r=- 0. 456; p= 0. 009) were inversely correlated with the velocity at the individual anaerobic threshold. Run/walk strategy compared to running only reported less muscle pain and fatigue (p= 0. 006) after the running event.; In conclusion, the increase in cardiac biomarkers is a reversible, physiological response to strenuous exercise, indicating <b>temporary</b> <b>stress</b> on the myocyte and skeletal muscle. Although a combined run/walk strategy does not reduce the load on the cardiovascular system, it allows non-elite runners to achieve similar finish times with less (muscle) discomfort...|$|E
40|$|A {{continuous}} culture experiment {{was conducted with}} the marine diatom Ditylum brighiwellii to assess the photo-oxidative effects of transition from dim light to high Light at three successive levels. The focus was on <b>temporary</b> <b>stress</b> by ambient WA at the water surface, via a simulation of the periodic ascent of diatoms caused by vertical mixing. Within a 14 h dim- light period, cells were exposed daily to 4 h of: (A) moderate PAR (100 mu mol photon m(- 2) s(- 1)), (B) high PAR (400 mu mol photon m(- 2) s(- 1)) and (C) high PAR (400 - 700 nm) plus 67 pmol photon m(- 2) s(- 1) (2. 2 W m(- 2)) UVA. Cell shape, life cycle and sinking rates were not affected by high PAR per se (mode B). The daily 4 h high-irradiance mode C, with additional UVA (WA:PAR = 0. 016), caused an increase in cell diameter, a decrease in length axes, and a production of vegetative resting stages. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities, oxidized glutathione (GSSG) pools and malondialdehyde (MDA) contents increased as well, which indicates that this biologically effective WA dose (0. 78 W m(- 2)) promoted active oxygen production, oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation. Sinking rates in WA-exposed D. brightwellii were higher than in those grown without UVA. A close correlation between sinking rates and MDA contents suggests that UVA-induced lipid peroxidation has altered the membrane functions which regulate buoyancy in D. brightwellii. Although UVA-induced formation of resting cells will contribute to accelerated sinking, it is not evident {{that this can be}} considered as a stress avoidance mechanism under adverse light (WA) conditions. D. brightwellii proved to be sensitive to transitions from shade to natural surface irradiance conditions. In coastal waters, such large diatom species may experience oxidative stress after a few hours' residence near the water surface at ambient UVA levels.

40|$|Introduction: Vaginismus {{is mostly}} unknown among clinicians and women. Vaginismus causes {{women to have}} fear, anxiety, and pain with {{penetration}} attempts. Aim: To present a large cohort of patients based on prior published studies approved by an institutional review board and the Food and Drug Administration using a comprehensive multimodal vaginismus treatment program to treat the physical and psychologic manifestations of women with vaginismus and to record successes, failures, and untoward effects of this treatment approach. Methods: Assessment of vaginismus included a comprehensive pretreatment questionnaire, the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI), and consultation. All patients signed a detailed informed consent. Treatment consisted of a multimodal approach including intravaginal injections of onabotulinumtoxinA (Botox) and bupivacaine, progressive dilation under conscious sedation, indwelling dilator, follow-up and support with office visits, phone calls, e-mails, dilation logs, and FSFI reports. Main Outcome Measures: Logs noting dilation progression, pain and anxiety scores, time to achieve intercourse, setbacks, and untoward effects. Post-treatment FSFI scores were compared with preprocedure scores. Results: One hundred seventy-one patients (71 %) reported having pain-free intercourse at a mean of 5. 1 weeks (median = 2. 5). Six patients (2. 5 %) were unable to achieve intercourse within a 1 -year period after treatment and 64 patients (26. 6 %) were lost to follow-up. The change in the overall FSFI score measured at baseline, 3  months, 6 months, and 1 year was statistically significant at the 0. 05 level. Three patients developed mild <b>temporary</b> <b>stress</b> incontinence, two patients developed {{a short period of}} temporary blurred vision, and one patient developed temporary excessive vaginal dryness. All adverse events resolved by approximately 4 months. One patient required retreatment followed by successful coitus. Conclusion: A multimodal program that treated the physical and psychologic aspects of vaginismus enabled women to achieve pain-free intercourse as noted by patient communications and serial female sexual function studies. Further studies are indicated to better understand the individual components of this multimodal treatment program. Pacik PT, Geletta S. Vaginismus Treatment: Clinical Trials Follow Up 241 Patients.

40|$|From the {{ecological}} and economic {{point of view}} Agropyron elongatum, among perennial grasses, has a special place. This {{study was conducted to}} determine the most appropriate seed priming treatment and whether after a <b>temporary</b> <b>stress</b> removal, primed seeds have a higher recovery efficiency compared with unprimed seeds? In this research, seed was treated with different osmo and hydro priming and evaluated their effect by conducting germination test under drought stress (- 1. 2 and - 1. 4 MPa PEG) and recovery test. Hydro-primed seeds at 10 °C at all times (12, 24, 36 and 48 h) during priming; most indices of germination significantly improved compared to unprimed seeds. Also, seeds treated with osmopriming at both temperatures (10 & 15 °C) and all times of priming compared to unprimed seeds in the stress level of - 1. 2 MPa, the germination characteristics were improved. However, by increasing the potential of stress, few priming treatments have been able to maintain their superiority. It appears that priming can partially be effective on stress resistance and if the stress threshold is slightly higher than expected (this threshold for the Agropyron seeds in this study was - 1. 2 MPa) cannot have a noticeable effect on resistance to drought stress and can even be harmful too. All treatments which were placed in stressful situations and then moved to fresh water, showed a variety of recovery responses. As we viewed, primed seeds with a solution of - 0. 6 MPa urea for 12 h at 15 °C and followed by PEG solutions (- 1. 2 and - 1. 4 MPa) for 5 days and subsequently moved to fresh water conditions, had higher performance compared to unprimed seeds (P< 0. 05). In many of priming treatments by increasing the potential of drought stress; on recovery of germination percentage, final germination and normal seedling percentage were added. It seems that high concentrations induce a state of quiescence, and this may suggest an important adaptation for growth in arid and semi-arid environments...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 125 - 136). The aim of {{this study}} was to investigate the current crystal methamphetamine problem and its trends of abuse as manifested in the local context of Cape Town, South Africa. Twelve individuals (four ex-users, five users in recovery and three current users) who were dependent on crystal methamphetamine took part in the study. They ranged between the age of seventeen and twenty eight years. Semi-structured interviews were conducted in order to gather participants' stories about their subjective understanding of their dependence on crystal methamphetamine. Onset of use was often driven by curiosity and/or peer pressure, as well as to avoid states of psychological discomfort. Crystal methamphetamine use was usually maintained due to the enjoyment of its rewarding effects. Smoking the substance became especially important with more regular use as it served as a powerful, albeit <b>temporary,</b> <b>stress</b> eliminator. Crystal methamphetamine ubiquity appeared to be highly influential in the onset as well as maintenance of the substance's consumption. A range of debilitating physiological and psychological symptoms comprised the state of dependence. The presence of psychotic symptoms was rife within the sample and was often indicative of severe and prolonged crystal methamphetamine use. An inability to function within the external 'drug-free reality' was characterised by participants not being able to fulfill responsibilities and thus was also suggestive of maladaptive patterns of use. Polydrug use was generally common among participants. Some female participants' narratives also pointed towards the association of crystal methamphetamine use and sexual risk-taking behaviours. Identifying an external motivating factor was important in encouraging cessation of use but internal motivation often appeared to be just as significant in attaining as well as sustaining abstinence. Sleeping was the most common strategy used in dealing with the state of severe withdrawal which followed post use. In general, most participants did not perceive treatment as being the most useful means of achieving sobriety. Identifying goals and a perceived sense of purpose appeared important in motivating the individual along the path towards recovery as well as in the maintenance of abstinence...|$|E

IAN McAULEY looks at the implications "WOTCHER gonna do 2 ̆ 7 bout 2 ̆ 7 ousin?" a lady screamed at Bob Menzies in a 1960 s town hall election rally. "I 2 ̆ 7 d put an 2 ̆ 7 h 2 ̆ 7 in front of it" was his prompt reply. In such situations a quick wit is a good substitute for considered policy. Forty years on, we are still groping for practical solutions to housing affordability. There are many factors driving the price of housing and therefore housing stress, including land servicing costs (which are now borne by the purchaser rather than the wider community), distortions in the taxation system which encourage housing speculation, immigration, geographic limits on urban expansion and demand fed by government grants and inheritances. In this article, however, I want to focus on one rarely-considered factor contributing to housing stress - the effect of behavioural changes in response to mortgage {{interest rates}}. Australians place a high value on housing. While we may, say, choose a 20, 000 car rather than a 30, 000 car, in housing we tend to go for what we can afford, using a decision rule such as what we can afford if mortgage servicing takes up 25 percent of our income. There {{is no question that the}} high mortgage interest rates of the late 1980 s limited housing affordability. In 1989, Peter Costello likes reminding us, variable mortgage rates peaked at 17. 0 percent. Let’s see what effect that high rate had on a couple, each earning the average adult wage at the time (26, 611), taking out a mortgage over 20 years. If they devoted 25 per cent of their combined income to their mortgage they could afford to commit 13, 306 a year, which would service a mortgage of 74, 880 in 1989 prices, or around 129, 000 in 2007 prices. If the same couple were buying a house now, their mortgage interest rate would be only 8. 05 percent, and the adult wage is now 55, 920. Applying the same “ 25 per cent of income” decision-rule, they could afford to spend 27, 960 a year on their mortgage, which can service a mortgage of 273, 000. In real terms, that’s more than twice the value of what they could have afforded in 1989. While some effect is due to higher real wages (which have risen by about 20 per cent over that period), most is due to lower interest rates. So far, this analysis confirms the conventional wisdom: lower interest rates result in greater housing affordability. Let’s look at that “ 25 percent of income” rule, however. It is based on our capacity to make immediate repayments. But a mortgage stretches out over many years and, if we were truly rational beings blessed with perfect foresight, we would weigh up our capacity for repayment over the period of the mortgage, taking into account our expected earnings over that period. The 1980 s were a time of high inflation, which was feeding into prices and wages. Interest rates (what economists call “nominal” interest rates because these are the rates “nominated” in loan documents and everyday language) may have been high, but so too was inflation. The mortgage may have imposed an immediate 25 percent burden, but if wages were rising at 8 per cent a year, while the mortgage stayed constant, that burden would fall to 23 per cent after a year, 21 percent after two years, 20 per cent after three years, and so on. (In fact, those who took variable-rate mortgages in the late 1980 s peak soon found not only their incomes rising but also the interest rates falling.) The burden of mortgage repayment was heavy initially, but it soon lightened. We have many means of coping with <b>temporary</b> <b>stress,</b> such as deferring replacement of cars, furnishing and appliances, deferring having children and extending credit card debt. Coming forward to the present time, inflation is low, and people cannot expect such automatic relief. Even if their employment is reasonably secure, they cannot expect their income to rise much higher than inflation, which is now running at only 2. 4 per cent a year. The burden of high mortgage repayments will hang around much longer than for their predecessors, thirty years earlier. The struggle lasts longer, and, for many, the prospect of falling back to one income is unthinkable. Economists will recognise that what is being referred to in this article is the effect of real, as opposed to nominal interest rates. Nominal rates are those we see everyday, in the advertisements of banks and other lenders. Real rates take into account inflation. The relationship is mathematically simple: 	Real rates = nominal rates minus inflation. So, in 1989, when nominal rates were 17 per cent, inflation was 8 per cent, real rates were around 9 per cent [see note 1]. Now, with nominal mortgage rates around 8 per cent, and inflation at around 2 per cent, the real rate is more like 6 per cent. There has been a fall, but not of the magnitude we hear in the political debates, and, unlike 1989, there is now no prospect of an immediate fall in rates. (By 1991 rates had fallen by 4 per cent; as inflation fell, nominal interest rates also fell.) For political reasons Peter Costello and others in the government don’t talk about real rates, which have moved in a band of about 2 to 10 per cent over the last thirty years - not a very exciting political story. And Labor seems to be reluctant to go forth with any messages with the slightest suggestion of economic complexity. Certainly no one would advocate a return to high inflation as a way of easing the burden of mortgage re-payments, even though it would be effective in the short run. Rather, we need some way to moderate those decision rules based on immediate repayment - which are being stretched beyond 25 percent to even more onerous figures such as 30 percent. Certainly, it would be useful to cover the concepts of real and nominal interest rates in school and financial literacy programs, but there are many parties, besides politicians, who want to keep us thinking in nominal terms. Employers wouldn’t want to see their offers of wage rises discounted to real terms, and neither would union officials, who want to be able to boast about the rises they negotiate for their members. [2] Research in behavioural economicsshows that education, in itself, only partially improves decision-making. Behavioural economists find that we are very myopic in our decisions to borrow. In the 1980 s such myopia didn’t matter much; it was compensated for, as rising nominal wages eroded the burden of a nominally fixed mortgage. That compensation is now very much attenuated, and the mortgage burden we bear this year will be with us for many years to come. Patterns of consumer behaviour are hard to change, particularly when people are surrounded by the din of financial institutions and “innovative” lenders selling mortgages, and when politicians are boasting about low interest rates. The reality is that Australia’s {{interest rates are}} now on a steep upward trajectory, and are close to the highest among all developed countries. It may be more fruitful to search for solutions on the supply side. Some have suggested fiscal reform, such as abolishing “negative gearing,” reverting to the previous neutral capital gains tax regime, extending the jurisdiction of the Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority to cover non-bank lenders, and abolishing the double counting of interest and depreciation in housing investment. Another possible area of reform is prohibition of the practice of commission-based selling, whereby the employees or agents of financial institutions are paid on a percentage of the loans they sell. This practice, as Louise Sylvan said when she was CEO of the Australian Consumers Association, is a form of “structural corruption”, resulting in over-commitment by borrowers, housing price inflation, and, as we are starting to see, concerns about the stability of our financial markets. • Ian McCauley lectures in public sector finance at the University of Canberra and is a Centre for Policy Development Fellow. Notes: 1. The actual formula is a little more complex. The real rate is (1 +nominal rate) /(1 +inflation) - 1, but that approximates to the simplified form nominal - inflation. In 1989 the nominal rate was 17. 0 percent and inflation was 8. 0 percent, giving a more precise real rate of 8. 3 percent. 2. Keynes’ solution to the stagnation of the Great Depression was to give a large nominal wage rise, but which was a cut in real terms. Seventy years later people have learned how to adjust wages for inflation, but they have not applied the same learning to interest rates. Photo: Andrew Jeffre...|$|E
40|$|The {{teratogenic}} effects of thermal stress were {{studied in the}} oviparous Italian wall lizard Podarcis sicula. To this purpose, the eggs were exposed to continuous or temporary cold (15 °C) or warm (30 °C) stresses and the effects were analysed at the cytological and molecular levels. The results demonstrated the lethality of the continuous regimes and of the warm temporary regime, no matter if given at early (5 days) or late (15 days) stages of development. <b>Temporary</b> cold <b>stress</b> also resulted in lethality, but only if given in the early stage; later, in fact, it resulted in an abnormal development, with marked alterations in the encephalic vesicles, {{in the eyes and}} the trunk organs. By in situ hybridization, it was demonstrated that these alterations were often correlated with changes in HSP 70 expression. In conclusion, our data indicate that Podarcis embryos have a limited potential to tolerate thermal changes, especially warm ones. The average predicted temperature increase of 2 – 4 °C in the next few decades could therefore represent a real threat for lizard populations living in temperate areas. © 2016 Académie des science...|$|R

30|$|The {{expression}} of genes involved {{directly or indirectly}} in Zn transport increases under Zn deficiency. Moreover, the genes involved in starch synthesis and transport were up-regulated by Zn deficiency. Both Zn-deficient roots and shoots accumulated starch (Figure 1), {{in line with the}} gene expression pattern (Table 2). Starch may be used as a carbon source; therefore, it is assumed that Zn-deficient plants synthesize starch to withstand <b>temporary</b> abiotic <b>stress.</b> However, {{it is also possible that}} disruption of glycolysis by Zn deficiency causes an over-accumulation of soluble sugar, which ultimately results in starch accumulation. It is already reported that the activity of FBP aldolase in the glycolysis pathway decreased under Zn-deficiency in the leaves of oat and clover, and suggested that one of the reasons for a growth defect in plants grown under Zn-deficient conditions is the breakdown of normal carbohydrate metabolism (Quinlan-Watson [1951]). The concentration of soluble sugar and starch increase in Zn-deficient bean shoots (Marschner & Cakmak [1989]). An increase in soluble sugar would cause osmotic stress. We speculate that the starch might be synthesized to avoid osmotic stress due to increased soluble sugar in cells under Zn deficiency. Up-regulation of the genes that encode soluble sugar transporters due to Zn-deficiency suggests that sugar transporters help distribute sugar to avoid osmotic stress (Table 2).|$|R
