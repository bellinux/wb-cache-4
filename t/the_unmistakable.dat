5|$|There was {{considerable}} debate whether pterosaurs ambulated as quadrupeds or as bipeds. In the 1980s, paleontologist Kevin Padian suggested that smaller pterosaurs with longer hindlimbs, such as Dimorphodon, might have walked or even run bipedally, {{in addition to}} flying, like road runners. However, {{a large number of}} pterosaur trackways were later found with a distinctive four-toed hind foot and three-toed front foot; these are <b>the</b> <b>unmistakable</b> prints of pterosaurs walking on all fours.|$|E

25|$|Since 2003, the {{politics}} of war have been characterized by partisanship as the Republican and Democratic parties struggled for power in Washington. National efforts to date have been corrupted by partisan politics that have prevented us from devising effective, executable, supportable solutions. At times, these partisan struggles have led to political decisions that endangered {{the lives of our}} sons and daughters on the battlefield. <b>The</b> <b>unmistakable</b> message was that political power had a greater priority than our national security objectives. Overcoming this strategic failure {{is the first step toward}} achieving victory in Iraq without bipartisan cooperation we are doomed to fail.

25|$|Japan {{would take}} {{advantage}} of Hitler's war in Europe to advance its own ambitions in the Far East. The Tripartite Pact guaranteed assistance if a signatory was attacked by any country not already involved {{in conflict with the}} signatory; this implicitly meant the U.S. By joining the pact, Japan gained geopolitical power and sent <b>the</b> <b>unmistakable</b> message that any U.S. military intervention risked war on both of her shores—with Germany and Italy on the Atlantic, and with Japan on the Pacific. The Roosevelt administration would not be dissuaded; believing the American way of life would be endangered if Europe and the Far East fell under military dictatorship, it committed to help the British and Chinese through loans of money and materiel, and pledged sufficient continuing aid to ensure their survival. Thus, the United States slowly moved from being a neutral power to one preparing for war.|$|E
25|$|Van 't Hoff's first work on {{returning}} from the United States was the Villa Verloop – a summer house in Huis ter Heide whose design bore <b>the</b> <b>unmistakable</b> influence of Wright's Prairie Houses. More remarkable however was his next work – the Villa Henny – which was a highly idealistic and experimental house in both design and execution. One of the earliest houses to be built entirely out of reinforced concrete, the Villa Henny made full use of the aesthetic freedom this presented with a flat roof, overhangs, receding walls and a highly geometrical outline that presented an unambiguously modern profile compared to the rustic naturalism of his earlier designs. The Villa Henny established van 't Hoff with the international avant-garde as a major figure in the emerging modern movement, gaining an influential and appreciative review from the architect Huib Hoste in De Telegraaf and attracting {{the attention of the}} emerging De Stijl group.|$|E
25|$|The central {{standing}} 'foreground' {{figure is}} shown affectionately holding {{in both hands}} a blue bird (thus {{the title of the}} painting). The reclining figure wearing a necklace shown in the lower center of the canvas is placed next to a pedestal fruit bowl and another bird with <b>the</b> <b>unmistakable</b> coloration of the rare Scarlet ibis (L'Ibis rouge), a rich symbol for both exoticism and fashion. Costume designers for Parisian cabarets such as Le Lido, Folies Bergère, the Moulin Rouge and haute couture houses in Paris during the 1910s used the feathers of the scarlet Ibis in their shows and collections. The Ibis is a bird to which the ancient Egyptians paid religious worship and attributed to it a 'virgin purity'. A mysterious pyramidal shape is seen as if through a porthole {{to the right of the}} reclining figure's head, though it remains a matter of speculation whether there exists any relation to the ibis or pyramids of ancient Egypt. In front of the pyramid appears a shape that resembles a sundial, perhaps meant as the element of time, or 'duration', as the clock placed in the upper right hand corner of his Nude of 1910.|$|E

500|$|At {{least some}} pterosaurs had hair-like {{filaments}} known as pycnofibers {{on the head}} and body, similar to, but not homologous (sharing a common origin) with, mammalian hair. A fuzzy integument was first reported from a specimen of Scaphognathus crassirostris in 1831 by Goldfuss, and recent pterosaur finds and the technology for histological and ultraviolet examination of pterosaur specimens have provided incontrovertible proof: pterosaurs had pycnofiber coats. Pycnofibers were not true hair as seen in mammals, but a unique structure that developed a similar appearance. Although, in some cases, actinofibrils (internal structural fibers) in the wing membrane have been mistaken for pycnofibers or true hair, some fossils, such as those of Sordes pilosus (which translates as [...] "hairy demon") and Jeholopterus ninchengensis, do show <b>the</b> <b>unmistakable</b> imprints of pycnofibers {{on the head and}} body, not unlike modern-day bats, another example of convergent evolution. The head-coats do not cover the pterosaur's large jaws in many of the specimens found so far.|$|E

This {{is reported to}} give the album a more nostalgic feel; the record is [...] "held together by tiny interludes named after 1990s video games in which <b>the</b> <b>unmistakable</b> sounds of a cassette player rewinding, fast-forwarding, and stopping are heard". On the track [...] "We All Try", Ocean speaks out against homophobia. According to The Guardian, [...] "Odd Future's frequent {{use of the word}} 'faggot' unsettled liberal stomachs", and that [...] "Ocean was brave enough to stand alone once more, declaring on 'We All Try': 'I believe that marriage isn't between a man and woman, but between love and love'. On the same song he reveals his opinion of the pro-choice debate: 'I believe a woman's temple, gives her the right to choose/ But baby don't abort.'" [...] He obliquely [...] "announces his support of a woman's right to choose and gay marriage", both of which are [...] "hardly typical r tropes." [...] The song contains [...] "smooth, bedroom-type grooves".|$|E

They'd always react the same way. There'd be a riot every time." [...] At the two concerts he performed in September at the Mississippi-Alabama Fair and Dairy Show, 50 National Guardsmen {{were added to the}} police security to prevent crowd trouble. Elvis, Presley's second album, was released in October and quickly rose to number one. The album includes [...] "Old Shep", which he sang at the talent show in 1945, and which now marked the first time he played piano on an RCA session. According to Guralnick, one can hear [...] "in the halting chords and the somewhat stumbling rhythm both <b>the</b> <b>unmistakable</b> emotion and the equally unmistakable valuing of emotion over technique." [...] Assessing the musical and cultural impact of Presley's recordings from [...] "That's All Right" [...] through Elvis, rock critic Dave Marsh wrote that [...] "these records, more than any others, contain the seeds of what rock & roll was, has been and most likely what it may foreseeably become." ...|$|E

40|$|Keeping {{with the}} theologians {{it is out}} of the {{question}} to limit the Divinity. On the contrary, Dimitrie Cantemir prouves that is possible. In his theolo – philosophans, Sacrosanctae Scientiae Indepingibilis Imago (translated Metafizica, in 1928), the prince, rhetor and artist too, reiterates the way of King Avgar and the example of the Old Fathers. After a tormenting effort to bring the Light of Divinity, he offers to us the most importants representations of the verticality (after the classification of Gilbert Durand) – <b>the</b> <b>unmistakables</b> tools to touch the Skies. The author conceives the visuals and verbals ways of representation and communication to the imaginary of sacred – a remarkable formula not only for his readers of the Middle Ages, but for those of today. The verb "ascendo", the nouns "sagitta" and "speculum" are the mains paradigms visuals and orals of sacred imagery...|$|R

500|$|The {{music of}} Il ritorno shows <b>the</b> <b>unmistakable</b> {{influence}} of the composer's earlier works. Penelope's lament, which opens Act I, is reminiscent both of Orfeo's Redentemi il mio ben and the lament from L'Arianna. The martial-sounding music which accompanies references to battles and {{the killing of the}} suitors, derives from Il combattimento di Tancredi e Clorinda, while for the song episodes in Il ritorno Monteverdi draws in part on the techniques which he developed in his 1632 vocal work Scherzi musicale. In typical Monteverdi fashion the opera's characters are vividly portrayed in their music. Penelope and Ulisse, with what is described by Ringer as [...] "honest musical and verbal declamation", overcome the suitors whose styles are [...] "exaggerated and ornamental". Iro, perhaps [...] "the first great comic character in opera", opens his Act 3 monologue with a wail of distress that stretches across eight bars of music. Penelope begins her lament with a reiteration of E flats that, according to Ringer, [...] "suggest a sense of motionless and emotional stasis" [...] that well represents her condition as the opera begins. At the work's end, her travails over, she unites with Ulisse in a duet of life-affirming confidence which, Ringer suggests, no other composer bar Verdi could have achieved.|$|E
500|$|At {{the same}} time Shakira's album evoked sharp {{criticism}} {{by a number of}} authors. David Browne from Entertainment Weekly, for instance, called the album a [...] "the ultimate in crossover nightmares" [...] and opined that Shakira's incorporation of different musical genres made it sound confusing, saying [...] "Its wan ska-pop, faux-country ballads, and generic rock barely betray a Spanish accent or any musical heritage. (She can't decide if she wants to sound like Alanis or Shania)". Matt Cibula from PopMatters gave a more mixed view in his review of Laundry Service; he complimented some of the lyrics of the songs but expressed disappointment in Shakira's production of the album, writing it off as [...] "generic". He felt that the album was [...] "extremely safe" [...] and speculated that the reason behind the album's [...] "generic" [...] sound was due to the Estefans' involvement, saying [...] "when I read that she's [...] helping you with lyrics and he's [...] 'executive producer', and I hear <b>the</b> <b>unmistakable</b> hum of 'moneymoneymoneymoney' in the background [...]" [...] Ernesto Lechner from Rolling Stone complimented the singer's voice as a [...] "wild and beautiful instrument [...] capable of delivering scorching moments of musical passion," [...] but commented that the involvement of a [...] "battalion of producers and songwriters" [...] led to Shakira sounding [...] "downright silly" [...] on Laundry Service and also criticised [...] "her efforts to spice things up with obvious touches of Latin American folklore." ...|$|E
