5|$|The {{first time}} a {{prisoner}} tried {{to escape from the}} Bain was in 1993, when a 38-year-old prisoner was able to escape while {{he was supposed to be}} cleaning ice from the parking lot in front of the ship. The guard who was responsible for <b>the</b> <b>inmate</b> was suspended without pay due to the incident.|$|E
5|$|The game's protagonist is Richard B. Riddick (reprised by Vin Diesel), {{a murderer}} {{recently}} confined in Butcher Bay. Riddick is resourceful, {{and seeks to}} break out of the prison by any means necessary. His capturer is the bounty hunter William J. Johns (Cole Hauser); the two have had previous encounters. Butcher Bay's warden is a man named Hoxie (Dwight Schultz), while Abbott (Xzibit) is a prison guard disliked by the inmates. <b>The</b> <b>inmate</b> Pope Joe (Willis Burks II) is an insane old man, who lives in the sewer tunnels beneath the prison.|$|E
5|$|The {{types of}} prisoners were {{distinguishable}} by triangular pieces of cloth, called Winkel, sewn onto on their jackets below their prisoner number. Political prisoners had a red triangle, Jehovah's Witnesses had purple, criminals had green, and so on. The nationality of <b>the</b> <b>inmate</b> was indicated by a letter stitched onto the Winkel. Jews had a yellow triangle, overlaid {{by a second}} Winkel if they also fit into a second category. Uniquely at Auschwitz, prisoners were tattooed with their prisoner number, on the chest for Soviet prisoners of war and on the left arm for civilians.|$|E
25|$|A {{complex social}} and {{political}} structure developed in the prison, amongst <b>the</b> <b>inmates</b> themselves, and between <b>the</b> <b>inmates</b> and <b>the</b> guards.|$|R
50|$|A European {{conference on}} Prison Education and Training {{was held in}} February 2010. Over 200 delegates from across Europe were in attendance. It was {{suggested}} to be widely accepted that prisons are damaging to <b>the</b> <b>inmates,</b> and therefore a method to decrease the potential damage is to provide <b>the</b> <b>inmates</b> an education during their incarceration. This would eventually contribute to <b>the</b> <b>inmate’s</b> successful reentry into society. The internet is a convenient study tool, and if used correctly would contribute to <b>the</b> <b>inmate’s</b> studies.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>inmates</b> in Frankenthal’s block were {{composed}} mainly of Jews, with several political prisoners as well. The prisoners {{were forced to}} work under horrendous conditions for long hours. <b>The</b> <b>inmates</b> also worked alongside civilian workers from the Polish and German populations who instructed <b>the</b> <b>inmates</b> inside <b>the</b> camp, but not inside the electric fence.|$|R
5|$|Three weeks later, some {{children}} {{playing in the}} street wandered into the yard of the now-vacant house. One of them fell into the cellar and discovered the tunnel. While the prison's Board of Inspectors was unable to identify <b>the</b> <b>inmate</b> involved in the escape attempt, the warden punished Berkman by sending him to solitary confinement for nearly a year. Days after {{he was released from}} solitary, Berkman tried to hang himself with a strip of his blanket.|$|E
5|$|In {{this new}} institution, Neto angers the nurse Ivan after {{reporting}} to the hospital's superior that the nurse overreacted while trying to calm a patient. The nurse has it out for him, and when Ivan sees Neto faking to take a pill, he injects the drug through a syringe. That night, Neto, after doping a nurse, goes to the hospital stockroom and asks <b>the</b> <b>inmate</b> Biu to set fire to a stack of drugs. When Ivan discovers this, Neto receives solitary confinement. After being released from solitary, Neto writes {{a letter to his}} father and silently gives it to him when he visits. After refusing to have his hair cut, Neto is locked in solitary once again. He sets fires to the cage and is rescued by the nurses. After reading the letter, Wilson takes him from the clinic. The films ends as Wilson cries while he and Neto are seem seated side by side curbside.|$|E
25|$|Explain to <b>the</b> <b>inmate,</b> {{every six}} months, what conduct would allow <b>the</b> <b>inmate</b> {{to be removed}} from OSP placement.|$|E
50|$|From 2005 to 2007, the Federal Antwerp Prison asked Ekkart to give dance {{lessons in}} the prison to <b>the</b> <b>inmates,</b> and to choreograph a show with <b>the</b> <b>inmates.</b>|$|R
50|$|During Rick's coma, due to {{the news}} broadcasts, <b>the</b> <b>inmates</b> and guards had a basic {{understanding}} of what was going on. Soon, many of the guards abandoned the Prison and <b>the</b> <b>inmates</b> to fend for themselves; at about the same time, a few walkers had somehow gotten inside and began to kill <b>the</b> <b>inmates.</b> Several of <b>the</b> guards freed <b>the</b> <b>inmates</b> and joined together to fight their way out, resulting in heavy casualties. By the time Rick and his group discovered the Prison, it was discovered that there were only four survivors left who were locked up inside the cafeteria.|$|R
50|$|Curt’s {{goal for}} the program {{is to create a}} family {{environment}} with <b>the</b> <b>inmates</b> involved in <b>the</b> play, providing them with education through the plays and giving them {{something to look forward to}} at a time when they have no one else. In many cases <b>the</b> <b>inmate’s</b> families have turned their backs on them; Curt’s compassion is a crucial contribution to <b>the</b> <b>inmate's</b> success both during the play’s rehearsals and during the process of rejoining society. Any anger expressed by <b>the</b> <b>inmates</b> at any point is redirected into solving the argument that has occurred instead of pointing fingers and placing blame.|$|R
25|$|From 2003 through 2008 Berenson {{worked in}} and co-managed the bakery at Huacariz Prison which served <b>the</b> <b>inmate</b> {{population}} and the Cajamarca community.|$|E
25|$|Opponents {{point to}} the fact that sodium thiopental is {{typically}} used as an induction agent and not used in the maintenance phase of surgery because of its short-acting nature. Following the administration of thiopental, pancuronium bromide is given. Opponents argue that pancuronium bromide not only dilutes the thiopental, but (since <b>the</b> <b>inmate</b> is paralyzed) also prevents <b>the</b> <b>inmate</b> from expressing pain. Additional concerns have been raised over whether inmates are administered an appropriate level of thiopental owing to the rapid redistribution of the drug out of the brain {{to other parts of the}} body.|$|E
25|$|In total, opponents {{argue that}} the effect of {{dilution}} or improper administration of thiopental is that <b>the</b> <b>inmate</b> dies an agonizing death through suffocation due to the paralytic effects of pancuronium bromide and the intense burning sensation caused by potassium chloride.|$|E
2500|$|The prison hired a {{physician}} to keep <b>the</b> <b>inmates</b> somewhat healthy but provided no pharmaceuticals; any drugs required to administer to <b>the</b> <b>inmates</b> {{had to be}} purchased using his own salary. Between May and November 1873, the overworked doctor reported 67 illnesses in a population of 21 inmates, or about three maladies per prisoner during a span of six months. These sicknesses can be mostly attributed to the crowded, unsanitary conditions of the prison itself and to the poor quality of food provided to <b>the</b> <b>inmates.</b> [...] Since <b>the</b> prison was operating on a shoestring budget, it had to feed <b>the</b> <b>inmates</b> with what <b>the</b> territory could provide. Therefore, few fruits and vegetables {{found their way into}} the diet, and <b>the</b> <b>inmates</b> made do with a menu heavy in proteins and starch.|$|R
5000|$|Once inside, <b>the</b> <b>inmates</b> {{had to give}} {{up their}} {{personal}} clothing and don the rough workhouse uniforms. Families were split up; males from females, children from their parents. <b>The</b> <b>inmates</b> were divided into seven different categories: ...|$|R
5000|$|... 53 {{percent of}} <b>the</b> <b>inmates</b> are imprisoned or {{detained}} due to drug sale or use and about 2,000 prisoners {{are accused of}} committing terrorists attacks while sixty percent of <b>the</b> <b>inmates</b> are waiting for trial sentences.|$|R
25|$|On September 1, {{he asked}} Osten {{to join him}} and request the Governor end <b>the</b> <b>inmate</b> early release program. “This {{is part of a}} {{continuing}} trend of being soft on violent criminals,” Coutu said. “This is a very dangerous slope.” He also mentioned as a convenience store clerk he was assaulted in 1994.|$|E
25|$|Prison medical {{facilities}} include primary care, mental health services, dental care, substance abuse treatment, {{and other forms}} of specialized care, depending on the needs of <b>the</b> <b>inmate</b> population. Health care services in many prisons have long been criticized as inadequate, underfunded, and understaffed, and many prisoners have experienced abuse and mistreatment at the hands of prison medical staff who are entrusted with their care.|$|E
25|$|Center for Council’s Inmate Council Program is {{a six-month}} {{intervention}} where prisoners {{are trained to}} facilitate Council sessions for other prisoners. This program is active in 17 California prisons. Through <b>the</b> <b>Inmate</b> Council Program, participants learn and teach Council-based convening and communication skills to support healthy and productive perspectives and behaviors. The program contributes to a shift of culture within the prison and provides inmates with tools for success upon release.|$|E
50|$|It {{was called}} Venda Sexy for {{the sexual abuse}} that <b>the</b> <b>inmates</b> {{suffered}} during <b>the</b> detention. Another name {{that was given to}} the estate was La Discothéque for the music that was played when <b>the</b> <b>inmates</b> were tortured.|$|R
50|$|The Adult Basic Education Program {{focuses on}} inmates who are {{insufficient}} readers, and well behind on their basic math skills. This program gives <b>the</b> <b>inmates</b> <b>the</b> {{reading and math}} knowledge necessary for <b>the</b> <b>inmates</b> survive in modern communities.|$|R
50|$|Today {{the camp}} {{contains}} a reconstruction of a triangular cabin as {{a testimony to}} the hundreds of identical cabins that were lived in by <b>the</b> <b>inmates.</b> Like <b>the</b> original cabins, the reconstruction was made from thin slabs of wood covered in tarred cardboard. A few monuments recall the camp of the Gursiens, a name that was first used by the inhabitants of nearby towns to refer to <b>the</b> <b>inmates</b> and that was ultimately adopted by <b>the</b> <b>inmates</b> themselves.|$|R
25|$|In 1931, over 600 BC Doukhobors {{were sentenced}} to three-year prison terms for public nudity. BC Penitentiary was unable to handle such a spike in <b>the</b> <b>inmate</b> population, so a {{satellite}} prison {{under the authority of}} the BC Penitentiary was constructed on Piers Island specifically to house these prisoners. When the majority of these sentences expired, the prison camp was closed and the remaining Doukhobor inmates were transferred to the main penitentiary.|$|E
25|$|Opponents of lethal injection, as {{currently}} practiced, {{argue that the}} procedure employed is designed to create the appearance of serenity and a painless death, rather than actually providing it. More specifically, opponents object {{to the use of}} pancuronium bromide, arguing that its use in lethal injection serves no useful purpose since <b>the</b> <b>inmate</b> is physically restrained. Therefore, the default function of pancuronium bromide would be to suppress the autonomic nervous system, specifically to stop breathing.|$|E
25|$|About to be {{sent away}} from Charenton {{for her role in}} {{assisting}} the Marquis, Madeleine begs a last story from him, which is to be relayed to her through the asylum patients. Bouchon, <b>the</b> <b>inmate</b> {{at the end of the}} relay, is excited by the story, breaks out of his cell, and attacks Madeleine. Royer-Collard hears Madeleine's screams but chooses to ignore them and she is killed by Bouchon. The asylum is set afire by the pyromaniac Dauphin and the inmates break out of their cells.|$|E
50|$|Amongst <b>the</b> <b>inmates,</b> Glynn is feared {{due to his}} {{toughened}} law {{and order}} based attitude. Glynn's preference for the isolation ward, week-long lock downs, and harsh interrogation style helps him empower this fear. Unlike Tim McManus, he does not try to build a working relationship with <b>the</b> <b>inmates</b> to help them better themselves; rather, he just cares that they are obedient of his command of the prison. Glynn seems {{to get along with}} <b>the</b> <b>inmates</b> who run <b>the</b> cafeteria {{as long as it is}} run in an efficient and respectable manner. In general though, Glynn treats <b>the</b> <b>inmates</b> as fairly as need be, assuming they have not done anything to cross his path.|$|R
50|$|The court {{unanimously}} {{ruled against}} <b>the</b> <b>inmates</b> due to prosecutorial discretion, but left {{open the possibility}} that prosecution could be compelled in another situation. The court also noted that the case had more merit than other similar cases, including the recent Supreme Court decision in Linda R. S. v. Richard D. Specifically, the court noted that <b>the</b> <b>inmates</b> had legitimate interest in the investigation and prosecution of those they accuse beyond a desire for punishment. This was because, if the allegations of <b>the</b> <b>inmates</b> proved correct but were not investigated, the crimes described would continue, leading to a direct link between the non-prosecution of the state representatives and risk of physical injury to <b>the</b> <b>inmates.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Today {{the camp}} {{contains}} a reconstruction of a triangular cabin as {{a testimony to}} the hundreds of identical cabins that were lived in by <b>the</b> <b>inmates.</b> [...] Like <b>the</b> original cabins, the reconstruction was made from thin slabs of wood covered in tarred cardboard.

25|$|This is {{a result}} of Ford v. Wainwright (1986). A Florida inmate on death row appealed his case to the United States Supreme Court, declaring he was not {{competent}} to be executed. The court ruled that a forensic professional must make that evaluation and, if <b>the</b> <b>inmate</b> is found incompetent, provide treatment to aid in his gaining competency so the execution can take place. Providing treatment to an individual to enable that person to become competent to be executed puts mental health professionals in an ethical dilemma.|$|E
25|$|Ravensbrück first housed {{prisoners in}} May 1939, when the SS moved 900 {{women from the}} Lichtenburg women's {{concentration}} camp in Saxony. Eight months {{after the start of}} World War II the camp's maximum capacity was already exceeded. It underwent major expansion following the invasion of Poland. By the summer of 1941 with the launch of Operation Barbarossa an estimated total of 5,000 women were imprisoned, who were fed gradually decreasing hunger rations. By the end of 1942, <b>the</b> <b>inmate</b> population of Ravensbrück had grown to about 10,000.|$|E
25|$|During his tenure, the {{department}} developed a Gang Intelligence Unit and gang tracking database, networking with local, state, and federal authorities across the country. Inmate violence—defined as inmate-on-inmate stabbing and slashing incidents—were reduced by 93 percent from FY 1995 to FY 1999. Similarly, overtime spending in FY 1999 decreased 45 percent from FY 1995 and the uniform sick rate dropped {{for the same}} period by 25 percent. These achievements occurred during a period when <b>the</b> <b>inmate</b> population rose to record levels, from 110,410 admissions in FY 1994 to 133,000 in FY 1999, a 25 percent increase.|$|E
50|$|Mobile {{devices were}} {{implemented}} and {{made available to}} prison officers {{to gain a better}} understanding of an inmate when they visit the various institutions. Mobile tablets were introduced in 2012 to allow prison officers to retrieve inmate information while on the ground. It also allowed the officers to instantly find out more about <b>the</b> <b>inmates</b> if they are new admissions. Observations of <b>the</b> <b>inmates</b> can also be recorded on the spot when they monitor certain behavioural changes in <b>the</b> <b>inmates.</b>|$|R
50|$|Despite {{the large}} amount of protests of <b>the</b> <b>inmates,</b> <b>the</b> strike {{received}} a small amount of media coverage.|$|R
5000|$|Five housemates {{from the}} reality show Pinoy Big Brother: Celebrity Edition 2 {{performed}} [...] "Rico Mambo" [...] with <b>the</b> <b>inmates.</b> <b>The</b> participants were: Victor Basa, Megan Young, Gaby Dela Merced, Riza Santos, and Mcoy Fundales.
