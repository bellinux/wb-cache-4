5|$|In 2008, it was {{announced}} SITA had plans to build another EfW plant adjacent to <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>one,</b> named the North East Energy Recovery Centre (NEERC). SITA UK began consulting key partners, stakeholders and local residents on these plans in April 2008, before submitting a formal planning application that summer. Permission for the plant's construction was granted on 15 October 2008. On 17 September 2010, it {{was announced}} that SITA had signed a contract with the South Tyne and Wear Waste Management Partnership for their waste to be burned at NEERC once the plant was completed. Construction is expected to begin in early 2011, in time for a 2013 completion date.|$|E
5|$|NEERC is {{expected}} to be capable of handling up to 190,000 tonnes of waste per year. This waste will be burned to generate electricity for the National Grid and cogenerate to provide heat for local industries in the form of steam. NEERC will have two processing lines, capable of generating 21MW of electricity, enough to provide for 37,500 homes. This means that over the two facilities, 640,000 tonnes of waste will be burned annually, and over 50MW of electricity generated. This would make Teesside the largest operational EfW centre in the UK outside London. The plant will be a mirror image of <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>one,</b> and will create 160 jobs; 25 in South Tyne and Wear, 100 {{in the construction of the}} plant, and the rest once the plant is operational.|$|E
5|$|Nokian Tyres {{produces}} 23,000 tyres per day at {{a factory}} in Nokia, Finland, and 200,000 tyres a year under the Bridgestone brand name. The original factory was built in 1904, <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>one</b> in 1945; it has expanded several times since then. Nokian Tyres has 27 assembly lines at its Finnish plant. The plant uses radio frequency devices to monitor the inventory of materials used to manufacture tyres, such as the 100-metre long strips of rubber tread. Shortages of rubber tread can halt production and so keeping an adequate supply of materials increases efficiency. Despite trade journals discussing this technique, Nokian declines to confirm its production methods.|$|E

5|$|The games chronicle {{the adventures}} of a new Pokémon trainer who strives to become the Pokémon League Champion by {{collecting}} and training Pokémon. Like most games in the series, Diamond and Pearl feature eight Pokémon gyms led by Gym Leaders, professional trainers whose expertise lies in a particular Pokémon type. Gym Leaders (Roark, Gardenia, Maylene, Crasher Wake, Fantina, Byron, Candice, and Volkner) serve as bosses and reward skilled trainers with Gym Badges, key {{to the advancement of}} the plot. As all core games, the protagonist must also thwart the schemes of a crime syndicate (and here, it is Team Galactic), who plans to use Pokémon to create a new universe just for themselves, while destroying <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>one.</b>|$|E

Prior and alternate names include Portrait of a Slav Prince, Portrait d'un Turc, and Man in Russian Costume. Its authenticity was supported by {{an analysis of the}} panel's wood, which showed that it was cut from a tree felled around 1635 that was also used in the painter's River Landscape with Ruins (1650). The painting underwent restoration in 1985 and has been X-rayed.|$|E

5|$|The {{species is}} Eurasian in origin, {{and may have}} evolved from either Vulpes alopecoides or the related Chinese V.chikushanensis, both of which lived during the Middle Villafranchian. The {{earliest}} fossil specimens of V.vulpes were uncovered in Baranya, Hungary dating from 3.4-1.8million years ago. The ancestral species was likely smaller than <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>one,</b> as the earliest red fox fossils are smaller than modern populations. The earliest fossil remains of the modern species {{date back to the}} mid-Pleistocene in association with the refuse of early human settlements. This has led to the theory that the red fox was hunted by primitive humans as both a source of food and pelts.|$|E

5|$|After the Nika Revolt {{destroyed}} much of {{the city}} of Constantinople in 532, including the churches of Hagia Sophia ("Holy Wisdom") and Hagia Irene ("Holy Peace"), Justinian had the opportunity to rebuild. Both had been basilica plan churches and both were rebuilt as domed basilicas, although the Hagia Sophia was rebuilt on a much grander scale. Built by Anthemius of Tralles and Isidore of Miletus in Constantinople between 532 and 537, the Hagia Sophia has been called the greatest building in the world. It is an original and innovative design with no known precedents in the way it covers a basilica plan with dome and semi-domes. Periodic earthquakes in the region have caused three partial collapses of the dome and necessitated repairs. The precise shape of the original central dome completed in 537 was significantly different from <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>one</b> and, according to contemporary accounts, much bolder.|$|E

5|$|In theses 67–80, Luther {{discusses}} {{further the}} problems with the way indulgences are being preached, as he had done in the letter to Archbishop Albert. The preachers have been promoting indulgences as the greatest of the graces available from the church, but they actually only promote greed. He points out that bishops have been commanded to offer reverence to indulgence preachers who enter their jurisdiction, but bishops are also charged with protecting their people from preachers who preach contrary to the pope's intention. He then attacks the belief allegedly propagated by the preachers that the indulgence could forgive one who had violated the Virgin Mary. Luther states that indulgences cannot take away the guilt of even the lightest of venial sins. He labels several other alleged statements of the indulgence preachers as blasphemy: that Saint Peter could not have granted a greater indulgence than <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>one,</b> and that the indulgence cross with the papal arms is as worthy as the cross of Christ.|$|E
5|$|The {{principal}} {{religion in}} Aalborg {{as in the}} rest of Denmark is Christianity. Aalborg is the seat of a bishop within the Lutheran State Church of Denmark. The cathedral of this bishopric is the Budolfi Church, originally built no later than 1132 by Viborg's Bishop Eskil. This church was considerably smaller than <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>one,</b> as it was merely a parish church. The existing structure was completed in the late 14th century, {{on the grounds of the}} former church, and was listed for the first time in the Atlas of Denmark in 1399. The church was named after St Botolph, an English abbot and saint. The church is constructed in the Gothic style. In 1554 Aalborg was made a diocese and, after consideration, St Budolfi Church was made the seat of the Bishop of Aalborg. Aalborg is also home to the former Catholic church, the Abbey of Our Lady, converted from a Benedictine nunnery.|$|E
