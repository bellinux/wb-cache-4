The protective panel includes an outer ceramic matrix composite (CMC) panel, and an insulative bag assembly coupled to the outer CMC panel for isolating the launch vehicle from elevated temperatures and moisture. A standoff attachment system attaches the outer CMC panel and the bag assembly to the primary structure of the launch vehicle.

Focusing on the three body forms of filling the sand, laying the <b>tubular</b> <b>bags</b> with sand and casting the sand-bags and two typical forms of section, the article has completed the indoor large-scale hydraulic model experiment of sand tank.
